You know he was the type that never left me alone.
Untill I really need to reach him on the telephone.
He was nowhere to be found he's hangin out with the boys.
Drivin over in the city in his pretty new toy.

Never gonna get it together (Uh huh, Uh huh)
Never gonna get any better (Uh huh, Huh)
Should I stay or should I go because I really need to know, or do I stick around and cry 'cuz now it's time to say goodbye? (please baby,
please baby. please baby)

I ain't got nobody that I can depend on, just me myself and I.
I ain't got nobody that I can depend on.

Then there was the one who couldn't make up his mind. 
He's always checkin every chickie at the checkout line. 
He told me baby I'm just lookin, but I never would touch. 
Then I catch him with Alicia at the back of the bus.

I ain't got nobody that I can depend on, just me myself and I.
I ain't got nobody that I can depend on, I said me myself and I.
I ain't got nobody that I can depend on.
