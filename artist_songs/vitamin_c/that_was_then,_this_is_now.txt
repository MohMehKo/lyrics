Some things I guess I won't forget
Like my first time on the night we met
I wish I could go back there tonight, tonight

Looking in your eyes the way you held me tight
Weeded all the wrong, when it felt so right
There's nowhere I'd rather be tonight, tonight
Tonight

Funny how you said people never change
Always be together 'til the very end
But that was then and this is now
Funny how I have to take you everywhere
Just to believe no matter what I had
But that was then and this is now

You and me were like a movie scene
Superstars playing in a teenage dream
(?) one left tonight

Guess you could've broken someone else's heart
I'm the big winner because I played the part
Don't wanna say goodbye tonight, tonight
Tonight

Funny how you said people never change
Always be together 'til the very end
But that was then and this is now
Funny how I have to take you everywhere
Just to believe no matter what I had
But that was then and this is now

I feel first my life
But never ever be another one
Don't wanna tell no one
You and me together was so much fun

I feel first my life
But never ever be another one
Don't wanna tell no one
You and me together was so much fun

Sometimes you gotta let things be
Even when the truth is that you lied to me
But I wanna keep those thoughts away, from me
From me

It's the little things that I dream about
That no one ever talks about
The little things I think about
That no one ever dreams about
The kisses that were promised
?As we whispered our plans?

Funny how you said people never change
Always be together 'til the very end
But that was then and this is now
Funny how I have to take you everywhere
Just to believe no matter what I had
But that was then and this is now

Funny how you said we would never change
Let me tell you something baby, life is strange
But that was then and this is now

Remember me, remember me
Remember me, remember me
Remember me, remember me
