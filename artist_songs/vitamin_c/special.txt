I been trying for so long
To get you where I stand
Feel like I been climbing all my life
Everybody told me
I'd never ever get this far
I know I can make it if I try

There's the special things that come your way
?I'll be praying? no matter what they say
Special things that somehow come to you

(come to you, you too, to you, do to, be do, you)
Special things come to you

There's no sense in trying to fight it
When I want something so bad
No, it's not as easy as it seems
Simple things are the hardest
Of the things we do for love
And I won't give up cause I'm not just what it means

The special things you dream about
And the special things you're all about
Special things that somehow come to you

And it's the simple things to just believe
And the special things that you want to see
Special things somehow come to you

(come to you, doo doo doo, to you, doo doo doo)
Special things (doo, doo ahh, you doo)
Do do doo, on you, do do doo, to you
Do doo, ahh, do do doo, too

There's the special things that come your way
?I'll be praying? no matter what they say
Special things that somehow come to you

The special things you dream about
And the special things you're all about
Special things that somehow come to you

There's the special things that come your way
?I'll be praying? no matter what they say
Special things that somehow come to you

And it's the simple things to just believe
And the special things that you want to see
Special things somehow come to you
