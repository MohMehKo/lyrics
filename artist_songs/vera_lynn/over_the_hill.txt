You will find me waiting there
Over the hill
All your troubles you can share
Over the hill
and at times when things go wrong
If they make the road seem long
There's a smile and there's a song
Over the hill
There's a welcome there for you
Over the hill
and the sky's are always blue
Over the hill
You will find content and rest
for you'll be a mothers guest
In the place that you love best
Over the hill
