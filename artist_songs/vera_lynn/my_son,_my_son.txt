(My son, my son)
My son, my son you're everything to me
My son, my son you're all I hoped you'd be
My son, my son my only pride and joy
God bless and keep you safe
My own, my precious boy

For all the care and heartache
Life has brought to me
One precious gift has made it all worthwhile
For heaven blessed and with great joy rewarded me
For I can look and see my own beloved son

My son, my son just do the best you can
Then in my heart I'm sure
You'll face life like a man

My pride and joy
My life, my boy
My son, my son
