Wishing will make it so
just keep on wishing and care will go
Dreamers tell us dreams come true
It's no mistake 
Wishing are the dreams we dream when we're awake
The curtain of night will pass
If you are certain within your heart
So if you wish long enough wish strong enough
You will come to know
Wishing will make it so

Just imagine that you are
Back in childhood days
Wishing on the evening star
For a load of hay
It worked wonders for you then
Who knows why or how
Though your older try again
It can help you now

Wishing will make it so
just keep on wishing and care will go
Dreamers tell us dreams come true
It's no mistake 
Wishing are the dreams we dream when we're awake
The curtain of night will pass
If you are certain within your heart
So if you wish long enough wish strong enough
You will come to know
Wishing will make it so
