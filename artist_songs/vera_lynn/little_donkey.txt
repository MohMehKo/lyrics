Little donkey,
Little donkey 
On the dusty road
Got to keep on plodding onwards with your precious load
Been a long time,
Little donkey,
Through the winter's night
Don't give up now,
Little donkey, 
Bethlehem's in sight
Ring out those bells tonight 

Bethlehem, Bethlehem
Follow that star tonight 
Bethlehem, Bethlehem
Little donkey, 
Little donkey
Had a heavy day
Little donkey, 
Carry Mary Safely on her way.
