I never cared much for moonlit skies,
I never knew love was such a prize.
But now that the stars are in your eyes,
I'm beginning to see the light.

I never went in for moonlight glow,
Or stealing a kiss by mistletoe.
But now when you turn the lamp down low,
I'm beginning to see the light.

Used to ramble through the park,
All alone there in the dark.
Then you came and caused a spark,
And my heart is on fire now.

I never made love by lantern-shine.
I never saw rainbows in my wine.
But now that your lips are burning mine,
I'm beginning to see the light.

Used to ramble through the park,
All alone there in the dark.
Then you came and caused a spark,
And my heart is on fire now.

I never made love by lantern-shine.
I never saw rainbows in my wine.
But now that your lips are burning mine,
I'm beginning to see,
Beginning to see the light.
