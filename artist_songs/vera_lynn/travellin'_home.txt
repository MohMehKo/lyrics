I'm travellin' home
Travellin' home
Far have I roamed from the faces I love
Winds that have blown me on my way
Blow me right back to harbour

Distant horizons so sweet from afar
Beckons to me like a shimmering star
When you're away, oh how swiftly you'll find
You long for the place far behind you

Travellin' home
Travellin' home
I'm like a stone that's been rolling too long
Winds that have blown me on my way
Blow me right back to harbour

I'm travellin' home
Travellin' home
Far have I roamed from the faces I love
Winds that have blown me on my way
Blow me right back to harbour

Distant horizons so sweet from afar
Beckons to me like a shimmering star
When you're away, oh how swiftly you'll find
You long for the place far behind you

Travellin' home
Travellin' home
I'm like a stone that's been rolling to long
Winds that have blown me on my way
Blow me right back to harbour

Travellin' home again
Travellin' home, my love, you
Travellin' home again
Home again to you
