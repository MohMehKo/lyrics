I'm looking for a star tonight
The star we looked for so long ago
I'm wondering how you are tonight
I hope that your alright
And want you to know dear
I shall be waiting as the days go slowly by
I shall be waiting though the poppies bloom and die
Each day at sunset and with every morning too
I wont forget to say a prayer for you
In the firelight gleaming your face I seem to see
My eyes grow dim with dreaming you are so near to me
I shall be waiting though the years may come and go
I shall be waiting dear I love you so

...

I shall be waiting though the years may come and go
I shall be waiting dear I love you so
