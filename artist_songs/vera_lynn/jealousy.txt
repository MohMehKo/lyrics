Jealousy, 'twas only through jealousy
Our hearts were broken, and angry words were spoken,
Now all I have is memory to cherish so tenderly
With every token you have given to me
I loved too well for I doubted you in my heart
My life was hell every moment we were apart
Why did I make that big mistake
I wronged you right from the start

'Twas all over my jealousy
My crime was my blind jealousy
My heart was afire with desire for you
But I never thought that your love was true
You gave all your kisses to me
But now, all too late, I can see
The heartaches I cost you, no wonder I lost you
'Twas all over my jealousy

You gave all your kisses to me
But now, all too late, I can see
The heartaches I cost you, no wonder I lost you
'Twas all over my jealousy
'Twas all over my jealousy
