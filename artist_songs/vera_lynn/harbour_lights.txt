One evening long ago
A big ship was leaving
One evening long ago
Lover's were greaving
A crimson sun went down
The lights began to glow
Across the harbour
One evening long ago
I saw the harbour lights
They only told me we were parting
The same old harbour lights
That once brought you to me
I watched the harbour lights
How could I help if tears were starting
Goodbye to tender nights
Beside the silver sea
I long to hold you near 
And kiss you just once more
But you were on the ship and I was on the shore
Now I know lonely life
While all the while my heart is whispering
Someother harbour lights
Will steal your love from me

Now I know lonely life
While all the while my heart is whispering
Someother harbour lights
Will steal your love from me
