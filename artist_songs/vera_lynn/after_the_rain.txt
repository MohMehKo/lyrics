After the rain,
The sun will dry all your tears
Blue skies appear
After the rain

Your window pane,
May show a world that is gray
Clouds drift away
After the rain

For the world is always brighter
When its weathered a heavy storm
And our hearts are always lighter
After teardrops have had to fall

Sunshine again
Will greet the world with a smile
Life seems worthwhile
After the rain

Thunder and falling rain
Are driving us all in the same
But when it's done
The sun will soon be shining
Again

After the rain...
Dry all your tears
Blue in the sky soon appears
After the rain...

Your window pane
May show a world that is gray
Clouds drift away
After the rain

For the world is always brighter
When its weathered a heavy storm
And our hearts are always lighter
After teardrops have had to fall

Sunshine again
Will greet the world with a smile
Life seems worthwhile
After the rain
