They met at a dance in a waltz of romance
Strangers, but strange as it seems
The girl's heart was thrilled, a dream was fulfilled
At these words from the boy of her dreams
Who's taking you home tonight
After the dance is through?
Who's going to hold you tight
And whisper, "I love you, I do"

Who's the lucky boy that's going your way
To kiss you goodnight at your doorway?
Who's taking you home tonight?
I'm pleading, please let it be me

Who's taking you home tonight?
Darling, it's plain to see
I'm pleading, please let it be me
