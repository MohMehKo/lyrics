Careless
Now that you've got me loving you
You're careless
Careless in everything you do

You break appointments and think you are smart
If you're not careful
You'll break my heart

Careless
Now that my bridges all are burned
You're careless
Careless in things where I'm concerned
Are you just careless as you seem to be
Or do you just care less for me?
