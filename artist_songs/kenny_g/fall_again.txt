It feels like a fire that burns in my heart
Every single moment that we spend apart.
I need you around for every day to start;
I haven't left you alone.

There's something about you, it's there in your eyes,
Everything I'm looking for I seem to find.
All this time away is killing me inside -
I need your love in my life.

I want to spend time 'til it ends,
I want to fall with you again.
Like we did when we first met,
I want to fall with you again.

We fought in a battle, but nobody won,
And left ourselves a mountain to be overcome.
You can't turn away: the past is said and done;
I need us to carry on.

I want to spend time 'til it ends,
I want to fall with you again.
Like we did when we first met,
I want to fall with you again.

You'll try everything
You never thought would work before.
When you live for, you love and you give 'em your all,
You can always give 'em some more.

Baby, nothin' means anything
Unless you're here to share with me.
I can breathe, I can bleed, I can die in my sleep
'Cause you're always there in my dreams.

I want to spend time 'til it ends,
I want to fall with you again.
Like we did when we first met,
I want to fall with you again.

I want to spend time till it ends,
I want to fall with you again.
Like we did when we first met,
I want to fall with you again.
