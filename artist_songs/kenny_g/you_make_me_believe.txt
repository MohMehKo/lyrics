Girl, now that you're here with me today.
So right. So right.
This feeling inside my heart
That I've waited so long to feel this way.
It's right, so right.
This time, I know it's meant to be.
Together forever.

Nobody ever could move me.
It took your sweet face to soothe me.

You make me believe in love.
You make me believe in love.

Girl, now that my deepest dreams became
So real, so real.
There is no doubt about your love.
I know I'll never be the same.
I feel, I feel,
This time, we're going all the way,
Together forever.

No one was ever so special, no, no.
I finally found the real thing.

You make me believe in love, oh.
You make me believe in love.
You make me believe in love. Yes, you do.
You make me believe in love.

Nobody ever could move me, oh no.
It took your sweet face to soothe me.

You make me believe in love, oh, girl.
You make me believe in love.
You make me believe in love, oh.
You make me believe in love, oooh oooh.

You make me believe in love.
Nobody could ever soothe me, oh.
You make me believe in love....
