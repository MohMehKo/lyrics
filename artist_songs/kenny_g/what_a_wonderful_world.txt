I see trees of green, red roses too
I see 'em bloom for me and you
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world!

I see skies of blue and clouds of white
The bright blessed days, the dark sacred nights
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world

The colors of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of people goin' by
I see friends shakin' hands sayin', "How do you do?"
Fairies sayin', I love you

I hear babies cry, I watch 'em grow
They'll learn much more than I'll ever know
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world!
Oh yes, I think to myself, what a wonderful world!
Oh yeah
