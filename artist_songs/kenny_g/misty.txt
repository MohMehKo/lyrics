Look at me, I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
And I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud
I can't understand, I get misty just holding your hand

Walk my way and a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear, I get misty the moment you're near

You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't you notice how hopelessly I'm lost?
That's why I'm following you

On my own, would I wander through this wonderland alone?
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove, I'm too misty and too much in love
Oh yes, I'm in, oh, what a feeling

Oh, you can say that you're leading me on
But it's just want I want you to do
Don't you notice I'm hopelessly so lost?
That's why I'm following you

On my own, would I wander through this wonderland alone?
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove, I'm too misty and too much in love

I'm too misty, too misty and too much in love
I'm too misty, too much in love
If that's possible, I don't know
