I took your love as a desperate measure
Seeking shelter from another lonely night
You took my love seeking only pleasure
But the feeling passes and the passion doesn't last

[Chorus:]
And I don't want to know why
I don't want no reasons
I just feel the seasons as they touch another year

And I don't want to know why
I don't want no reasons
I just want to know what is not and what could never be

Will the memories fade? Or will they linger?
Will we look forever for a moment we can keep?
Now we stand alone (why don't you do what you told me?)
Are we still together? (I only wanted you to hold me)
How did we ever let this dream slip through our hands?
