One more time saying goodbye to love. 
And wondering why, so I only 
Hope that I'm learning to make the right choices. 
I keep hearin' voices sayin'... 

I'll be alright; it's just another heartbreak baby. 
I'll be alright, soon as I forget your face. 
I'll be alright; I'll just write another love song. 
I'll be alright; Lord, just get me through the night. 

Some hearts get so used to feelin' this way, 
But that's not for me. 
Oh, I only know things do happen for all the right reasons. 
That's why I'm believin' ... 

I'll be alright; it's just another heartbreak baby. 
I'll be alright, soon as I forget your face. 
I'll be alright; I'll just write another love song. 
I'll be alright; Lord, just get me through the night. 


Can't say we didn't try to make it last. 
How we tried! 
Once the feelin' changes, it's just no use. 
'Cause love just turns into lies. 

Oh, my love is a love that you'll feel forever. 
So don't be afraid. 

I'll be alright; it's just another heartbreak baby. 
I'll be alright, I'll be alright, I'll be alright. 

I'll be alright; it's just another heartbreak baby. 
I'll be alright, soon I'll forget your face. 
I'll be alright; yeah, I'll write another love song. 
I'll be alright, ooh, ooh, yeah. 

I'll be alright, I'll be alright, I'll be alright....
