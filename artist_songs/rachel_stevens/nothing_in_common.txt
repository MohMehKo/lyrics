Take me in your arms again
so the whole world can take
a picture perfect photograph
but it's pure make believe

Keep no secrets, tell no lies
we don't want them to know
it's when your with me by my side
that I feel so alone

Dreaming of something
believing in nothing
lights going down
on a night full of stars
this isn't living
we're only pretending
it's falling apart

[Chorus:]
So we play to the crowd
every time we step out
we sit at opposite ends of the table
and we both take a bow
as the curtain comes down
we find two people
with nothing in common

Only we know

The story of a faded smile
it's a truth never told
all dressed up to be let down
when a warm heart beats cold

Dreaming of something
believing in nothing
lights going down
on a night full of stars
this isn't living
we're only pretending
it's falling apart

[Chorus]

Only we know

Who are we fooling?

[Chorus 2x]
