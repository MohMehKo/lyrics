You're solid, yeah
Like a rush that I don't wanna stop

Saw the signs in your eyes
What was up wasn't right
And none of us was innocent
Baby, still we played our games
Scared to win,
Left the mess we were in
On uneven ground,
Lost what we found

I had to put away my pride
To find a way that I could love you more
I couldn't keep away from you
Then you walk back in my life
And all at once we were just like before
No one does what you can do

You're solid, yeah
Like a rush that I don't wanna stop
Boy, your love goes on and on
You're solid, yeah
You and I thought that our thrill was gone
You were solid than a rock

Like a cool summer breeze
You're the fan for the heat
I feel lying next to you natur..ally
There's a switch in my heart
Only you can turn it on
You're the flame that lights late at night
Deep inside me

For so long I tried to fight
The way I felt the way you made me fall
But I couldn't keep away from you
But then you walk back in my life
And all at once we were just like before
'Cos no one knows what you can do

You're solid, yeah
Like a rush that I don't wanna stop
Boy, your love goes on and on
You're solid, yeah
You and I thought that our thrill was gone
You were solid than a rock

Surrender, when you do the things you do
Together, I cant get enough of you

You're the missing piece
The other half of me
To make me complete

You're solid, yeah
Like a rush that I don't wanna stop
I don't wanna stop, no no
You're solid, yeah
You and I thought that our thrill was gone
You're solid, you're solid

You're solid, yeah
Like a rush that I don't wanna stop
Boy, your love goes on and on
You're solid, yeah
You and I thought that our thrill was gone
You were solid than a rock

You're solid, yeah
Like a rush that I don't wanna stop
Boy, your love goes on and on
You're solid, yeah
You and I thought that our thrill was gone
You were solid than a rock
