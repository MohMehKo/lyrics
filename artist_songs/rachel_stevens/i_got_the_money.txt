Yeah

You got the time, I got the money
We'll have it all and just be happy

Oh-oh Yeah

You got the time, I got the money
We'll have it all and just be happy

Wishin' on a star's no good
Would it be said that we really could
Live out everything our hearts have dreamed of
waiting here's never gonna be enough
You know that we could be so much more
Cos we've only got one chance in this life
Don't you wanna do it right, baby

All my life, I wonder where you take me too
(All my life)
So I should take this chance, baby
All my love, I'd do anything for you
C'mon and we'll do something crazy

Let's run away, we've got nothin' to lose
We'll go anywhere, any place we choose
If you got the time, I got the money
We'll have it all and just be happy
Leave everything, start a life with me
We'll be anything that we wanna be
If you got the time, I got the money
We'll have it all and just be happy

Yeah, Yeah

You should never be afraid to fall
Don't you know nobody has it all
We can be closer than we've ever been
See all the things that we have never seen
Who knows what will become of me
But I'm sure that as long as you are by my side
We're gonna be alright, baby

All my life, I wonder where you take me too
(All my life)
So I should take this chance, baby
All my love, I'd do anything for you
C'mon and we'll do something crazy

Let's run away, we've got nothin' to lose
(Let's run away)
We'll go anywhere, any place we choose
If you got the time, I got the money
We'll have it all and just be happy
Leave everything, start a life with me
We'll be anything that we wanna be
If you got the time, I got the money
We'll have it all and just be happy

Oh, we'll be happy
If we get to places I see
Everyday the same house the same street
Wouldn't it be nice if you and me
Could forever be free
If we get to places I see
(We'll be free, baby)
Everyday the same house the same street
Wouldn't it be nice if you and me
Could forever be free

(Ooh, love the way baby)
Let's run away, we've got nothin' to lose
We'll go anywhere, any place we choose (any place we choose)
If you got the time, I got the money
We'll have it all and just be happy
Leave everything, start a life with me
We'll be anything that we wanna be (anything we wanna be)
If you got the time, I got the money (anything we wanna be)
We'll have it all and just be happy

Let's run away, we've got nothin' to lose
We'll go anywhere, any place we choose
If you got the time, I got the money (Mmmmmmhmmmm)
We'll have it all and just be happy
Leave everything, start a life with me
We'll be anything that we wanna be
If you got the time, I got the money
We'll have it all and just be happy
