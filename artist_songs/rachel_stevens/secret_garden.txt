Let's run and hide 

I know the stars like the dark 
Somewhere in this void of sky 
It feels like thousand eyes 
So baby, let's run and hide

Mm-mm-mm-mm
Oh, yeah

One single hole in the ice 
We dived in with 
One little glimpse, paradise 
I gave into you, ooh 
I knew heaven right there (right there)

One private kiss, stung my lips
Now I'm stuck on you, and who cares
I just want to do it, want to shoot
'Cause you're a trigger for me, I'm a sucker for you 
Nothing can stop this feeling (ooh)

Let's get carried away, lost in the dark

I know the stars like the dark 
Somewhere in this void of sky 
It feels like thousand eyes 
So baby, let's run and hide 
Find our own paradise 
A secret garden

Since it just keeps me confused 
My heart didn't choose 
God, can't feel, now all I want to do is shoot 
'Cause you're a trigger for me, I'm a sucker for you 
Nothing can stop this feeling (no it can't, yeah yeah, I know)

Let's get carried away, lost in the dark

I know the stars like the dark 
Somewhere in this void of sky 
It feels like thousand eyes 
So baby, let's run and hide
Find our own paradise
A secret garden

You're private invitation 
Into ecstacy 
Take cover, keep it locked in 
Let's swallow the key
(Let's swallow the key, yeah)

I know the stars like the dark 
Somewhere in this void of sky 
It feels like thousand eyes 
So baby, let's run and hide 
Find our own paradise 
A secret garden (noo)

I know the stars like the dark 
Somewhere in this void of sky 
It feels like thousand eyes
So baby, let's run and hide
Find our own paradise
A secret garden

I know the stars like the dark 
Somewhere in this void of sky 
It feels like thousand eyes 
So baby, let's run and hide 
Find our own paradise 
A secret garden

Let's run and hide
