Dangerous is you to me, addicted I sure am
Lock me up and keep me from this devil's master plan
It mystifies me how you drive me crazy with a kiss
Spellbound, boy, I still dream of this

I like the way you look at me
Every mornin' when I wake up
I can't deny sometimes I believe
Give me what I need

Your touch is like silk
Strokin' my body
Softer than skin
Bringin' my pleasure in
Your touch is like silk
Makin' me shiver
Makin' me sweat
I must get free of this boy I cant forget
Your touch is like
Your touch is like
Your touch is like
Silk

Fragile is this broken heart, can't take this pain no more
Inflammable is my whole life, yes, I've been burned before
Keep my distance, though I'm drawn to everything I miss
Tongue tied, I can still taste your kiss

I like the way you smile at me
In the evening 'cross a crowded room
I can't forget how good it feels
When you're close to me

Your touch is like silk
Strokin' my body
Softer than skin
Bringin' my pleasure in
Your touch is like silk
Makin' me shiver
Makin' me sweat
I must get free of this boy I cant forget
Your touch is like
Your touch is like
Your touch is like
Silk

Your touch is like silk
Strokin' my body
Softer than skin
Bringin' my pleasure in
Your touch is like silk
Makin' me shiver
Makin' me sweat...

Your touch is like silk
Strokin' my body
Softer than skin
Bringin' my pleasure in
Your touch is like silk
Makin' me shiver
Makin' me sweat
I must get free of this boy I cant forget
Your touch is like
Your touch is like
Your touch is like
Silk (Silk)
