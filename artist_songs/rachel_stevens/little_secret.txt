Oh yeah
Oh yeah

Down, shivers up and down
Wondering what we'll get up to
I'm feeling high I get excited
You know how I like it
I'm dying just to be with you

No need to tell a sole, keep it under control
Just tell me where to go
We'll be in privacy

I'll be your secret, your holy secret
Baby, no one need know what we'll get up to
I'll be your secret, your little secret
Don't you know I can't wait just to be with you
Oh

So tell me what's the plan
Your wish is my command
I'm longing just to please you, tease you, be my mystery man
You make me rude, got me in the mood
It's so exciting, hiding my secret rendezvous

We're on a role, keep it under control
Just tell me where to go
We'll be in privacy

I'll be your secret, your holy secret
Baby, no one need know what we'll get up to
I'll be your secret, your little secret
Yes, it's you that my heart is addicted to
Oh yeah

I said I like it when you do it like that
Slow moves knockin' boots in the back of your car
I like it when you do it like that
(like it when you do it like that)
Jumpin' hoops gettin' cute in the middle of the dark
(Wo-oh-oh-oh) 
I like it when you do it like that

I'll be your secret, your holy secret
Baby, no one need know what we'll get up to 
I'll be your secret, your little secret
Don't you know I can't wait just to be with you

I'll be your secret, your holy secret
I'll be your secret, baby
I'll be your secret, your little secret
Yes, it's you that my heart is addicted to

(I'll be your secret, holy secret)
I said I like it when you do it like that
(Yea, yea)

(I'll be your secret, holy secret)
I said I like it when you do it like that
(Yea, yea)

I'll be your secret, holy secret
