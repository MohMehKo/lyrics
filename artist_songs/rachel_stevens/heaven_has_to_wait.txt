I can't explain what I dont understand
Time slipping through my hands
As the seconds turn to yesterdays
I think that in my world it's so serene
I'm driven by a dream
One night when were alone again

Feeling's getting closer each day
This setting's now the right time to say

I just wanna lay down beside you, be naked where you sleep
Sing you a love song that makes your body weak
I can promise all of my tomorrows, my love for you today
I'll give you everything, but heaven has to wait

Oh yeah, Baby
Oooh

I already know that you're the one
The earth around my sun
But still there's things I need to hide
I know I see an angel fly above
This heart can't hurry love
The time's not right for you and I

Feeling's getting closer each day
This setting's now the right time to say

I just wanna lay down beside you, be naked where you sleep
Sing you a love song that makes your body weak
I can promise all of my tomorrows, my love for you today
I'll give you everything, but heaven has to...

I feel so tempted, here in this life
Sure would be easy, to love you tonight
Now is the right time, here in the dark
Finding my secrets, heaven has to wait
Heaven has to wait

I just wanna lay down beside you, be naked where you sleep (Naked where you sleep)
Sing you a love song that makes your body weak
I can promise all of my tomorrows, my love for you today
I'll give you everything, but heaven has to wait
