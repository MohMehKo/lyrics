I was brought among the least of you
And still I remain!
Forced by those who desire to crush me
Taking everything! I am, through the words above
I remember them well like they were living within me
I didn't understand at the time!
However now I know 
That you are right beside me

We are covered by your broken heart!
Salvation bleeding wide!
I will fight for you
This is my destiny!
You are mine forever!

Remember me! As these walls turn black!
I will return to you
You're my only hope! 

[Chorus:]
Remember me! 
As these walls turn black!
I will return to you!
You're my only hope! 

[?]
You take the darkest among us, awaiting waves as we end our storm[?]
We fight, clenching our fists, a breath of life that was never our own!
Save me from myself, falling from the path, landing among the thorns!

I will!
I will destroy you! 
I will!
I will destroy you! 

We are covered by your broken heart!
Salvation bleeding wide!
I will fight for you!
This is my destiny!
You are mine forever! 

Remember me! As these walls turn black!
I will return to you!
You're my only hope! 

[Chorus:]
Remember me! 
As these walls turn black!
I will return to you!
You're my only hope! 

Remember me! 
Remember me!
