Hold out your hands as you beg, relentless
If your don't deal with the faith that you have, you'll die again
Feeling this life that you praise being stripped away.
All that you are will be your final rest.

Bow your heads, renew our light
Unite, and stand as a flame of perfection, living our lives through you
Unite, we are leaving the world with a new heart, allowing truth to build you

Crawling around in the fate you made
Relying on the faith that was built by your company
Dancing, just dancing through life as you feel the pain 
Destroying every life that you felt that was in your path 

Bow your heads, renew our light
Unite, and stand as a flame of perfection, living our lives through you
Unite, we are leaving the world with a new heart, allowing truth to build you

Unite, and stand as a flame of perfection, living our lives through you
Unite, we are leaving the world with a new heart, allowing truth to build you
