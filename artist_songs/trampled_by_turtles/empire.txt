It's all that I remember a sober night alone
And it took all I had not to call you on the phone
Know that I was made for you
There is nothing I can do about it

I ran outside the bar
Ringing in my ears
And I don't understand
It's been that way for years
You know the world will fall apart
If you broke another heart

Coats are 'round in hiding
And up against the wall

Your guns were made of iron
And he came and saved us all
Pick it up and take it out
In a world of hell and doubt

Listen to the liars
As they run the world
Holiest empires
But nothing lasts for sure

Can you help me turn it off
Well it's all I could ever want
