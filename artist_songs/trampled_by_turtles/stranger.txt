It's all I can do to walk out of her alive
After all the Hell that I've been through
So I'm getting out of this town for a while
Spend the rest of my nights and days
Wishing I was back here with you

And you can see it all washing away
It's over right before the start
After I said all I wanted to say
I went through all the pieces
Just trying no to tear it apart

[CHORUS:]
And I'm a stranger now
Ain't no one else around
Can't forget about the sound of your alibi
I know you've been here before

We already gave the world to you, man
How can you make us beg on our knees?
For you might be the end of us all
I love so many people
That up and said good-bye

[CHORUS:]
And I'm a stranger now
Ain't no one else around
Can't forget about the sound of your alibi
I know you've been here before

You can cut me once and then I'd bleed all night
Still might make it back home alive
You can spread my name all over this town
'Cause you bought and sold the angels
And you're coming around back for more

[CHORUS:]
And I'm a stranger now
Ain't no one else around
Can't forget about the sound of your alibi
I know you've been here before
