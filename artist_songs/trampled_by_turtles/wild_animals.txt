Ooooooooooooo
Ooooooooooooo

There's another world, it's made for us
Trapped in bodies, they're made to rust
It's one that I can break right through
I am ready, how about you?

Ooooooooooooo
Ooooooooooooo
Ooooooooooooo
Ooooooooooooo

By the coming dark, we try to breathe
And this just can't be happening
We found everything we need
Buried deep beneath the leaves

Ooooooooooooo
Ooooooooooooo
Ooooooooooooo
Ooooooooooooo

I see the better part of you
I see the better part of you
But I'm a monster just like you
Wild animals it's true

Ooooooooooooo
Ooooooooooooo
Ooooooooooooo
Ooooooooooooo
