Are you behind the shining star?
Am I as hopeless as you are?
Well I’m sleepless in my better nights
You promised that you wouldn’t fight
Stay where we are

Busted paraded starve the band
You know I’m not that kind of man
But you were better when you couldn’t lie
Apparently we’re out of time
I’ve had all I can stand

I can’t hold on
I’m falling
Yeah I’m falling down

Are you behind the blinding light?
Strung out and stranded every night
There were places that I couldn’t find
And pieces that were out of line
Just tell me I’m alright

I can’t hold on
I’m falling
Yeah I’m falling
I can’t hold on
I’m falling
Yeah I’m falling down
