Drop me from the ceiling, baby
You're the one that can make it all okay
Maybe today

Filled with fatal flowers and praying 
For the sky to turn from black to grey 
Hear what I say

Never plain nor simple
It's breaking my heart
But I'm working hard 
To separate
war from beauty

Born of fire, earth and water 
All in all a current through a wire 
To know when it's hot

I'll survive on dirty paper 
Miracles that make me wanna die 
I wonder why

Oh my god, I'm sinking
It's breaking my heart
But I'm working hard 
To separate
War from beauty
