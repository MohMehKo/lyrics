Well, I ain't your baby, I ain't your baby now
Them holy rollers got kicked right out of town
It's dark where I've been stayin'
Don't you worry, come on in
Well, I've finally found a friend
I've found a friend

[CHORUS:]
Codeine, Codeine
You're the nicest thing I've seen
For a while
For a while

Well you hold my hand as I step into the room
And all these people, they'll all be fading soon
Well, it's whisper time remembered
Through armored thorns and knives
And it's all that I've got left
To hold onto.

[CHORUS:]
Codeine, Codeine
You're the nicest thing I've seen
For a while
For a while

Well you can keep your dusty bottle on your shelf
You can keep your words of wisdom to yourself
I love you darling so
Why can't you let me go
Before you find me hanging in my cell

[CHORUS (x2):]
Codeine, Codeine
You're the nicest thing I've seen
For a while
For a while

Codeine, Codeine
You're the nicest thing I've seen
For a while
For a while
