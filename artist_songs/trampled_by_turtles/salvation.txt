At the bottom of a bottle
I found my salvation
It came creeping slowly
Like a ghost in the dark
And if we were younger
I'd marry you, baby
We'd call it a good one
And we'd live out our days

We're older now
Made it somehow
And it comforts me
So patiently
Salvation is a good, good friend

Don't you sell me an ocean
Of holy forgiveness
When I'm broken and I'm buried
So far in the ground
And the echo surrounding
Calling your name out
Make marks in the dirt
Where I can't believe

We're older now
Made it somehow
And it comforts me
So patiently
Salvation is a good, good friend

It comforts me
So patiently
Salvation is a good, good friend
