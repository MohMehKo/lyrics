These two kids got a beautiful life
Oh, they work real hard
But that's alright
She gets up about a quarter to five
And he sleeps all day
'Cause he's out all night

But she don't want nobody else
Nobody else
Nobody else
And she don't want nobody else
Nobody else
Nobody else

Summertime comes and they get in the van
And they play their songs
The best they can
He looks around at the guys in the band
And they're rockin' out
Like nobody else can

They don't want nobody else
Nobody else
Nobody else
Yeah, they don't want nobody else
Nobody else
Nobody else

Well the tour's almost done
Yeah, it's time to go home
I miss my wife
I hate to leave her alone
No TV, disconnect the phone
If you've got someone who loves you
You're never alone

And I don't want nobody else
Nobody else
Nobody else
Yeah, I don't want nobody else
Nobody else
Nobody else

Yeah, I don't want nobody else
Nobody else
Nobody else
Yeah, I don't want nobody else
Nobody else
Nobody else
