Did you see the picture I was in
I called my Dad and all my friends
It was hazy but so is this
(Whoa oh oh)

I fell beneath the inbetween
It's best to just say just what you mean
Carpenter's in your mouth
(Whoa oh oh)

Oh oh.
Oh oh.

I came around and you were gone
Not just you everything was gone
Into the womb and out again
(Whoa oh oh)

So keep your pillow upon my mouth
Till I stop struggling then your out
Over and over again
(Whoa oh oh)

Over and over again
Over and over again
Over and over again
Over and over again
Over and over again
Over and over again
Over and over again
Over and over again
