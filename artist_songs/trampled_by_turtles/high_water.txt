It survives
I think it’s nice
To drive around till you’re blind

Young and old
Scared or bold
You’re what you want with your time

I wanna go sorry
Well I, I’m sorry too

Right or wrong
Which side I’m on
The earth won’t ever let it slide

Lonesome man
He’s got a plan
To end it all before his time

I wanna go sorry
Well I, I’m sorry too.
