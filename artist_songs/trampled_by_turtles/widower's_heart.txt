Can’t help it if I have a widower’s heart
Tried to get out of bed but I can’t seem to start
When I hit the road it was freezing and dark
I hope that it’s warmer wherever you are

I turned to say I’m sorry and I tried to explain
But the room it was empty and bitter and drained
No songs from the angels, no blood in my veins
Could ever replace you and here I remain

Oh, rain.
Come wash me and keep me and take my away.

New York was a rough place that suited me well
You bragged of religion and put me through hell
Maybe I’m better off, maybe it’s hard to tell
When I left you were sleeping through trumpets and bells

Oh, rain.
Come wash me and keep me and take my away.

Just one moment of peace, that would suit me so fine
But it’s echoes and glimpses of beautiful times
I’m sure it’s much harder on your end than mine
If you ever pass through here I’m not hard to find.

Oh, rain.
Come wash me and keep me and take my away.

Oh, rain.
Come wash me and keep me and take my away.
