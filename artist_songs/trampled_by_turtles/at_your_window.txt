I wake the mornin' wonder, and I'm all lost in the world
Of echoed situations and cursory illusion
I'm surrounded by forever, but I don't have any time
Left to wander in amusement, left to ride, my breath is dyin'

But I love you little darlin
and I'll love you till I die
Like sundown in the valley
Or the stars alone at night

Through empty bottle alleys
You come shinin' like the sun
And with your golden fingers
You save me from drowning

And I love you little darlin'
And I'll love you till I die
Like sundown in the valley
Or the stars alone at night

Well life goes on around me
Days are riding on the dawn
To infuse the world with words
It's just your way of talking

And I love you little darlin'
And I'll love you till I die
Like sundown in the valley
Or the stars alone at night

But I love you little darlin'
And I'll love you till I die
Like sundown in the valley
Or the stars alone at night
