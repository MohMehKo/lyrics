Houses like this we rejoin
It trembles like a voice
Hear the bells, they're calling
calling, calling, calling

Be careful what you say
'cause I remember everything
Climb the wall your way
and I remember everything

The walls around are made of stone
The air chills me to the bone
When all at once they're singing
singing, singing, singing

Be careful what you say
'cause I remember everything
I'm the tree and your the leaf
and I remember everything
