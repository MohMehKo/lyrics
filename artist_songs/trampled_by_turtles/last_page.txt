It was the last page of my little book
where I wrote down all my songs
It seemed like it would last forever
well I guess that we were wrong

Well I got depressed a bit but now
I seem to be alright 
And I could stay right here forever
And you know that I just might

Sometimes I think that I'd give it up
and maybe get a job
well it's never worked 
I hope it never does
There's truth in pain and love

And all the while you sit at home
Just wait for something to break
And as you curl up your barefoot mountain
let it slowly fade away
