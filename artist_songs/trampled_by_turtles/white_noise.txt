When the sun blows up and it’s just the cockroaches
I’ll blow kisses from my grave
When it’s all used up and I know you know it but the hour’s getting late
Who knew that we could melt so much ice?

And it’s never what it seems and I want more
Honey you’re the one for me and I’ll be the one for you

When the screen door slams and the fists start flying 
And you’re trying to forget
When the air is thin and our hope is dying man that’s even better yet
We like to run up that hill in the dark

But it’s never what it seems and I want more
Honey you’re the one for me and I’ll be the one for you

When you can’t explain how it is you got here
Why you even left your bed
And you can’t keep quiet, all the white noise static
or the voices in your head

Honey I’ve, I’ve been there too many times

But its never what it seems and I want more
Honey you’re the one for me and I’ll be the one for you
