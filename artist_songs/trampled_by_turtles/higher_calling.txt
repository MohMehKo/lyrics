I told her I would always love her
Sure I said I would meet her there
There's no price put on my head tonight

And all I got is all you left me
Nothing here is worth a dime
still seems better not to come around

She called my name
She called my name
Way up high in the air
and if I hear from that girl on the mountain
Know I'll meet her there

It's time like this I still remember
Fill my day and my lonely nights
Where the blue sky meets the cold hard ground

The door's broke down be calm and hurry
You'll never bring me back alive
There's no invitation left for me

She called my name
She called my name
Way up high in the air
and if I hear from that girl on the mountain
Know I'll meet her there

I tell you that I always love her
Sure I say I'll meet you there
Don't look for me when I'm gone

And all I got is all you left me
Nothing here is worth a dime
still seems better not to come around

She called my name
She called my name
Way up high in the air
and if I hear from that girl on the mountain
Know I'll meet her there
Yea you know I'll meet here there
