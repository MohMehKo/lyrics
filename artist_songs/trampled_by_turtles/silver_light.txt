See the light come
And surround you
Getting thin and alone
Silent forces
When they've found you
Can you just pick up the phone?

Silver light
Don't leave me lonely tonight
Silver light
Not a savior in sight

Crumbled and bleeding
In the corner
And i don't think of you at all
Nights are quiet
Cool and breezy
And I don't think of you at all

Silver light
Don't leave me lonely tonight
Silver light
Empty streets and traffic lights

Enter softly
Touching nothing
Slip away without a sound
There were the good days
Light and soaring
Days beneath the pitted ground

Silver light
Don't leave me lonely tonight
Silver light
Broken down and running light
