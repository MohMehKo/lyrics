Down by the wildwood water
you jumped right in
Swallowed the whole damn package
see you later friend
It's alright to remember
what you should of said
With all them angels dieing
in your cloudy head

There's peace in the Valley,
Just give it some time
and you do all you can
but you're just a man
so you walk away.

There's no use in fighting
you just lose your breath
she covered her weary eyes
gently wished for death

There's peace in the Valley,
just give it some time
and you do all you can
with your two good hands
Then you walk away

It's all dust and memories
I realized today
But its all we'll carry
as time slips away

There's peace in the Valley
just give it some time
and I do all I can
to try and understand
before its over and done.
