Well you mind rolling down your windows
Cause I'm a target too
Empty wisdom and empty pockets
Are all I got for you
You can't pretend to buy em
And you can't pretend to pay
I'm gonna spend my money
On the cost of livin
And walk the streets all day

Come on back Melinda
Come on back to your home
I ain't gonna be that way no more
I ain't gonna be that way

Well I wait for mornin'
To come and save me
And bring me back to life
Maybe sail on down the river
And get myself a wife
It's lonely here
Sittin down without you
Got too much time to think
My jealous thoughts
Are gonna kill relentless
And drive a man to drink

Come on back Melinda
Come On back to your home
I ain't gonna be that way no more
I ain't gonna be that way

Well you mind rolling down your windows
Honey I'm a target too
Empty wisdom and empty pockets
Are all I got for you
You can't pretend to buy em
And you can't pretend to pay
I'm gonna spend my money
On the cost of livin
And walk the streets all day

Come on back Melinda
Come On back to your home
I ain't gonna be that way no more
I ain't gonna be that way
