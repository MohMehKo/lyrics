Oh Shenandoah, I long to hear you
I look away, rolling river
Oh Shenandoah, I long to see you
Away, oh, bound away, across the wide Missouri

The chief disdained the trader's dollars
Look away, rolling river
My daughter, you shall never follow.
Away, oh, bound away, across the wide Missouri

For seven years, he put it sadly
I look away, rolling river
For seven more, he longed to have her
Away, oh, bound away, across the wide Missouri

She said she would not be my lover
Look away, rolling river
Because I was a dirty sailor
Away, oh, bound away, across the wide Missouri

It's "Fare thee well," I'm bound to leave you
I look away, rolling river
Oh Shenandoah, I would not deceive you
Away, oh, bound away, across the wide Missouri

At last, there came a Yankee skipper
Look away, rolling river
He winked his eye, and he tipped his flipper
Away, oh, bound away, across the wide Missouri

Oh Shenandoah, I love you daughter
I look away, rolling river
I take her across the open water
Away, oh, bound away, across the wide Missouri

Away, oh, bound away, across the wide Missouri
