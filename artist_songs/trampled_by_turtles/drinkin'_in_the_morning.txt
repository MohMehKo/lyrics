Well I work all day
Little darlin'
Work the night time too
And all the money I make
It's in my pocket
It's comin' home to you
But still you're gone
When I get home
You're runnin' down town again
And girl I'm lonesome
Like the whistle
On a Sunday mornin' train

Now you got me drinking in the morning
No need to wait for noon
Well I said boys you know that winter time
Will sure be comin' soon

Now I lost my job
I was workin'
Ain't got a friend left in the world
And it's all because
Of a no-good dirty cheatin' girl

Now you got me drinking in the morning
No need to wait for noon
Well I said boys you know that winter time
Will sure be comin' soon

Now I'm broke
Down and dirty
I waste my time over you
Leave me alone
Don't you come callin'
'Cause I ain't callin' you

Now you got me drinking in the morning
No need to wait for noon
Well I said boys you know that winter time
Will sure be comin' soon
Well I said boys you know that winter time
Will sure be comin' soon
