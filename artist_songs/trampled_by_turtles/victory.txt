All of us lonely; it ain't a sin
To want something better than the shape you're in
The rain came at the break of day
Your light in the windowpane 
Said "come on in"

It's a broken heart, babe; I know the sound
Feels like your hands are nailed to the ground
It'll pass just like everything else
You won't let it get ya, babe
The next time around

It's a hard-earned victory
The life that came from you to me
Could never be wrong

Grown from a moment in a million miles
Here lies the stardust, and it slowly dies
Borrowed from nothing, come back half-alive
And the stars, they whisper blessings, babe
As you walk by
