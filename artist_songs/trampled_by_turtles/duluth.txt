I can't love you baby
Like you need me to
You'll give up on me
I give up on you
In the lines and the shadows
Where my fear resides
I can't go out that door
It's so warm inside

We can lie like sinners
Breathe the air like children
And you could lead and I could follow
All those times are gone
Still I like the quiet
Of Duluth in the winter
In the sacred bond
There's no place like home
