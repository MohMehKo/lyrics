It's a war
Do what you're told
All the way in the back
I can see you attack 
And focus in starlight I would dine and be done
Cause I'm out of time
It's a whirl
The bastard son's and plates
Call at dawn for sack
It's time for being safe

Now we'll never
Blame it on the weather
More than ever, my friend
Don't forget to pretend
Don't forget to look pretty like you don't own a thing
Are you the last man around
Just a guess
But I think I'm getting more 
Wash your hands and pretend
That you keep me safe from harm
