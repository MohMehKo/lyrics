They came through town
And you conquered the world
And the last I saw was the smoke in the wind
Like an empty house
That's ready to burn
It's the end of the day let the night begin

Slow and trouble won't you come back to me
Cause I'm not the same anymore
Hallelujah I'm on my knees
Knockin' at your door

You show up late
With a handful of rust
The low sun winding the thread on the walls
And if you can't trust me
Then who can you trust
With a truce in the mirror and there's hope on the walls

Lonesome but friendly can't you see you're on your own
And your pockets don't need a thing
Hallelujah I'm on my knees
Won't you let me in

You wake me up
With a life on the line
And there's no chance of ever coming back
And if the world is flat
And there ain't no time
To pick up all of the nails and glass

Don't you tell me honey that your heart is mine
Just tell me how to make it last
Hallelujah I'm on my knees
Girl our time has passed
