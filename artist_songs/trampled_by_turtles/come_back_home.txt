Sorry
I was following another
Yeah, I heard it from your brother
Before you even called
Empty
Yeah, this house is empty
Like before you even met me
So I'll forget it all

I woke up
You were gone
Come back home
Come back home
Come back home to me

Good times
They were market in the sensor
Yeah I remember dealing records
Bringing it all back home
Power
Is comin through the shower
And the lightning marks the hours
And now I'm all alone

I woke up
You were gone
Come back home
Come back home
Come back home to me

Sorry
I was over you were under
And you know it makes me wonder
Why I'm still here at all
Silence
I was curled up beside her
Mostly following behind her
Trying not to fall

I woke up
You were gone
Come back home
Come back home
Come back home
Come back home
Come back home
Come back home to me
