It's cold enough to kill
But you're so near
That I can hear you breathing

And it's all in your head
I spent today
Pretending I can't see you
And I can't decide
I can't decide

It's trouble [x4]

I'd be the one who knocks
While the rest
They come in through the window
They're enemies of mine
Enemies of mine

It's trouble [x4]
