Well I wanna be a school bus driver
And drive all over the world
And if you would like
Well you could ride with me
And we could live on the road

We'd cruise by the banks
Of rivers deep and wide
Never have to think
About space or time

Well I wanna be a moonshine stiller
I'd make the best stuff around
And if you would like
Well you could drink with me
Until we fall to the ground

We could have our home
Out up in the hills
Never have to pay
No dues or bills

Well I wanna be a stardust chaser
And land on the face of the moon
If you would like
Well you could run with me
But I'll be runnin' soon

We could go forever
At least until we're done
Run circles 'round the moon
And circles 'round the sun

Well I wanna be a school bus driver
And drive all over the world
If you would like
Well you could ride with me
And we could live on the road

Well, we could live on the road
Yeah, we could live on the road
