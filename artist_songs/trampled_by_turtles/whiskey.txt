Whiskey, won't you come and take my troubles
'Cause I can't seem to do it on my own.
In the morning there is hours and infinity
The starlit evening's come to take me home.

I ain't got a dime in my pocket
And I just stepped on my last cigarette
But there's a bar downtown that'll give me credit
A home away from home, away I went.

Tomorrow there's a train to Carolina
Tomorrow that's where I'm gonna go
Feel the warm sunshine on my shoulders
And live my days a free and easy soul.

My home is with the hills and trees around me
My ceiling holds the moon and stars above
So I'll never be a lonely man a'walking
I'll never live one day without love.

So whiskey, won't you come and take my troubles
'Cause I can't seem to do it on my own.
In the morning there is hours and infinity
The starlit evening's come to take me home
The starlit evening's come to take me home.
