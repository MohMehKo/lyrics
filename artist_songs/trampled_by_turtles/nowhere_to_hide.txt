I'm just a poor boy I don't know how
I end up with a girl like you
Well there's a fire on the highway
And it's dark in town
Just like old songs I knew

There's a home in the valley
There's a home for me
Somewhere across the great divide
All of your words give me time to run
But there's nowhere to hide

Well, you're a sweet loving woman
In a dirty town
That emptied out my soul
It's a tear dropping memory of a holy man
Whose got nowhere to go

There's a home in the valley
There's a home for me
Somewhere across the great divide
Lamplit corners for everyone
But there's nowhere to hide

I guess I'll walk on forever
Never settle down
'Cause there's no time for me
You know, your words of redemption
Just slow me down
In my attempt to see

There's a home in the valley
There's a home for me
Somewhere across the great divide
It's a flat lonely desert of air and cloud
But there's nowhere to hide
No, there's nowhere to hide
