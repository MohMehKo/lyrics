Come into the world
Alone
And you go out of the world
Alone

But in between
It's you and me
Ohhh

Woahhh [x4]

The summer breezes blow
So tall
And the winter nights are cold
And so long

And in between
The falling leaves
Ohhh

Woahhh [x4]

The days and nights are killing me
The light and dark are still in me
But there's an anger on the beach
So let the wind blow hard
And wear the falling stars
Ohhh

Woahhh [x6]
