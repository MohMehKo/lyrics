I never meant to hurt you darlin’
I figured you would know all this by now
But I still think that I should say it

There’s more to life than dyeing early
It’s new to me so bear with me a while
And I promise that I’ll do better

When you leave me
Let me down easy
Won’t you?

And you’ll be sorry
And I’ll be sorry back

I never meant to hurt you darlin’
Looks that you’ll be holding too
I won’t be there when you’re calling

There’s more to life than broken windows
I know people that are just like you
And I promise that I’ll do better

When you leave me
Let me down easy
Won’t you?

And you’ll be sorry
And I’ll be sorry back
