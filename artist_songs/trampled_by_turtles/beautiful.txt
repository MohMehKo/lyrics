Weakened from the bottle
What are you fighting for?
Simple and subtle and lying
And too beautiful
Too beautiful
Too beautiful for me.

A massacre of timing
A shadow world at best
A life too short and blinding
And too beautiful
Too beautiful
Too beautiful for me.

No one saw it coming
And no one sees it still
Empty space and memories
Too beautiful
Too beautiful
Too beautiful for me.

And I'm scared that I... forget it.
I hate that life goes on.
The world so sweet and deadly
And too beautiful
Too beautiful
Too beautiful for me.
