Sometimes I wish I was dead and gone
That I walked this world no more
And all my troubles would pass away
As I walked through Heaven's door

As long as I can remember now
Been out here on my own
Oh how I wish I was in your arms
To rest my achin' bones

[CHORUS:]
And put me in the water
And put me in my grave
But no matter what you want from me
I ain't the one to save

It's lonely in a border town
Where no one knows your name
I'd spin this world right into the ground
'Til only life remains

When doors are shut for you my dear
You simply break them down
But I just sat there biding my time
Until the keys just came around

[CHORUS:]
And put me in the water
And put me in my grave
But no matter what you want from me
I ain't the one to save

There's holy ghosts and blinded eyes
They're fighting for my soul
I ain't the man that you thought you knew
I ain't that man no more

Remember when we owned it all
Those days went by so slow
But all those times are past and gone
And I've got nowhere to go

[CHORUS:]
And put me in the water
And put me in my grave
But no matter what you want from me
I ain't the one to save

And put me in the water
And put me in my grave
But no matter what you want from me
I ain't the one to save

But no matter what you want from me
I ain't the one to save
