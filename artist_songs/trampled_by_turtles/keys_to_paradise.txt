It’s the secret of the winners
That’s why I never got it
I come to find the savior, 
In your eyes

All my frozen winters
Face to blame for the garden
At least I couldn’t say that I tried

Fall apart at the softest setback of darkness
Dampened towers cry above to the 
Highest liar’s loving heart

All my partial poems come as painless fillers
I may never be as strong as you like
But the way you look at me
Is such a silent killer
Hold me a close and tell me I’m alright

Up all night just thinking of the ways to remain here
Mourn the silences that one time held 
the key to paradise

I kept running down from heights that I remember
Those were times that I treasured like a child
Pick this body up because I know I’m better
And I fell upon the ground with a sigh

Little bandages add up to a coffin baby
But I get hopeful every time I see you crack your little smile
