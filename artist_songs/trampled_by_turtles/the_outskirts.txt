Well I turned around in time to see the clouds fade,
running back could only make them stay.
Forward now I run down a winding road,
try to pay back everything that I have ever owed.

And when your money runs, will you buy a friend?
And when your guns don't fire, will that be the end?
With no land left to burn, and nowhere left to run,
where then can we stand when it's all said and done?

[Chorus:]
Well I hear the thunder roll, I feel the cold winds blowing,
but you won't find me there, 'cause I won't go back again.
While you're on smoky roads, I'll be out in the sun,
where the trees still grow, where they count by one [?]

Well you take from our schools to build a bigger bomb,
you tell us fiery lies about the course we're on.
And you'll kill all the world, and you'll reverse the sun,
and which would you sell first, your soul or your gun? 

[Chorus:]
But I hear the thunder roll, I feel the cold wind blowing,
but you won't find me there, 'cause I won't go back again.
While you're on smoky roads I'll be out in the sun,
where the trees still grow, where they count by one [?]
