You can call it what you want to, babe,
say it right or wrong, but it's all the same.
Why do you have to talk that way 
when I'm still in love with you?

And no matter what I should have done, 
it's cold outside, honey you're the one.
Give me time and I'll set things right,
'cause I'm still in love with you.

When I listen to the rain outside,
walking home in the pale moonlight.
Lord, this town is out of sight,
and I'm still in love with you.

But I lit them bridges and I watched them burn,
and oh my god you'd think I'd learn.
Still the same 'till my dying day,
and I'm still in love with you.

There's a whisper in the trees sometimes,
it comes and goes, baby that's alright.
Glass full of water and a glass full of wine,
and I'm still in love with you.

And you can haul it off to some town somewhere,
If I don't see it honey I don't care.
Pardon me if I tend to stare,
but I'm still in love with you.

And you can haul it off to some town somewhere,
If I don't see it honey I don't care.
Pardon me if I tend to stare,
but I'm still in love with you.
