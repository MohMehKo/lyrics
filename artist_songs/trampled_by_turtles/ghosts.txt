We never could shake it
Like there's nothing to lose
All the hearts that were breaking
We pretended we knew

There's blood on the hillside
The roots hold the landslide
Through pain and in young skies
I waited for you

There were ghosts in the forest
And they're calling to you
"Aw please just don't bore us
Whatever you do"

Never brighting by daylight
Never frighting by dark night
If I just keep it inside
I swear that it's true

Through breakers at low tide
Rough places and long rides
I'm constantly shaking
With the echoes of love
