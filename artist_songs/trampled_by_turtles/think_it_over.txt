Why don’t you help me, and I help you
You find a window, and I’ll see it through
Its all around, I can hear it calling
Even though I’m just a man

Stars are quiet but you’re on the phone
I'm singing thought babe, leave me alone
I hear your voice now, like a razor blade
and the books come off the wall

Turn on your light babe, its as dark as a cave
And we all got some time to think it over

Up on the hill top, their drinkin' blood, 
down in the gallows their on the run, 
up on the mountain, to the ever glades, 
all them angels have lost their wings

Turn on your light babe, its as dark as a cave
And we all got some time to think it over

Our faded memories of another world, 
captured and broken, hid in the grave
We got wisdom, we got many soul, 
I wouldn't go back and invent my life

Turn on your light babe, its as dark as a cave
And we all got some time to think it over

Oh give me love now, til' I fall down, burnin' destruction is all around
But on sunday mornin' I can see the sunrise upon this broken world

Turn on your light babe, its as dark as a cave
And we all got some time, yeah we all got some time
Baby we all need some time to think it over
