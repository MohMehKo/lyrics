Late night
Midnight on the interstate
And I didn't feel so great
Until I saw the city

And I was younger
And open like a child
Man, it's been a while
Since I felt that way

More and more I hesitate
'Cause I don't know

Happy Birthday
You didn't want to celebrate
And I was an hour late
And you fell apart

Mostly sober
Sometimes I change my mind
And I don't have the time
No, we never do

Love and love and nothing else
It's all I need
