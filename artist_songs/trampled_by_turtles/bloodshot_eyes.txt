It's empty where you were
Just a big gaping hole
now I tried every bottle
every pill that I know
but time baby time
works better than wine
and bloodshot eyes

I went to the mountains
I thought it might help
I wrote some songs
But they were shitty as hell
Only works when I'm broken
Four inches from dying
And at my best

If you know what I know
And I think that you do
You head to the country
For a minute or two
And lie on the earth
And for better or worse
Let it swallow you hole
