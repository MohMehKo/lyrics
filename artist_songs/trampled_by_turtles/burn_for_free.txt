Well my walls crumble down
As I stepped into this town
But its all over now
Lord it's past and gone

But it's calming to see
All the houses burn for free
Little darling of mine
Won't you please come home

Well you're my home you're my girl
All the years in all the world
Get handed down from up high
Upon the the mountain

But it's calming to see
All the cities burn for free
Little darling of mine
Won't you please come home

Well tell me now get away
Every hour of every day
It's these lonely times
That pass the worst

But it's calming to see
All the flags gonna burn for free
Little darling of mine
Won't you please come home
