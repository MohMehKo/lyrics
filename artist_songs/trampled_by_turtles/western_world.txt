The sun was high and good for travel
I don't mind when things unravel in the western world
A slave to the light in the cool dark shadow
I passed my time in the bracket shallow of the western world
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

We were in love in a wild desert memory
Now why does love get broken and heavy in the western world
The past is alive and I can't shake it
All you need to survive is to learn how to fake it in the western world
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

We are leaving, we are gone

We slept outside in a peaceful surrender
The secret lies, we tried to remember the western world
All the bad days, with blurry borders
We changed our clothes in the hidden corners of the western world
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

We are leaving, we are gone
