I'll never write another song again
'Cause they all sound the same
And I should be ashamed
And I'm breaking my guitar
As soon as I get home

I'll never have another drink again
Because I woke up on the floor
I can't remember anymore
And it's going down the drain
As soon as I get home

Never again
Never again

I'll never smoke another cigarette
'Cause it smells like shit
I can't afford to pay for it
And I'll break 'em all in half
As soon as I get home

I'm never gonna fall in love again
'Cause they'll break you in two
And there ain't nothing you can do
And I'm unplugging my phone
As soon as I get home

Never again
Never again

I'm never gonna vote for President
'Cause they're all the same
Close your eyes and pick a name
We should throw the bastards out
As soon as we get home

Never again
Never again
