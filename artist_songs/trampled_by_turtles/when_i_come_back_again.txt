[Chorus:]
When I come back, lord, when I come back again,
Annie [?] take me back to my home,
Annie take me back to my home, my home,
Ain't gonna roam no more.

Well Captain I don't want to kill another man,
He ain't done nothing to me.
He ain't done nothing to me, to me,
Ain't gonna roam no more.

Well son just do your duty for your countrymen,
don't ask no questions of me.
Don't ask no questions of me, of me,
Ain't gonna roam no more.

[Chorus:]
When I come back, lord, when I come back again,
Annie take me back to my home,
Annie take me back to my home, my home,
Ain't gonna roam no more.

There's a man behind a desk, a thousand miles away,
Gonna put me down in my grave.
Gonna put me down in my grave, my grave.
Ain't gonna roam no more.

[Chorus (x2):]
When I come back, lord, when I come back again,
Annie take me back to my home,
Annie take me back to my home, my home,
Ain't gonna roam no more.

No I ain't gonna roam no more.
