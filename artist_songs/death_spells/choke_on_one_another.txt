D.E.S.T.R.U.C.T.I.O.N. is my only god
Burn my love notes cause I’m off to heaven
Sell my lungs and bury my black eyes
Smoke signals marking where our trails end
I’m such a Xanax flavored waste of time
My pain is safe and sound. You’ll be the end of me
Forgiveness just brings me down
Hypnotizing, Paralyzing, Awe inspiring, Sterilizing, Annihilation of our lies
Fill our heads with the ashes of our empire
I’m not the type to ever compromise
Charred disciples stapled to the ceiling
Staring down makes you forget there’s sky
Genuflect before the king of the runaways
The clever kids left the stage behind
I never fell for the superficial noisefuck
Take my hand, let’s set this world on fire
Power, there’s so much power, in realizing that you’re going to die.
Solace, I’ll never find it. Until our lungs deflate for the very last time
Hey bright eyes heard you wanted to try on some death. I got a knife that looks just your size
Tick Tock Baby your time is up, Big Bad Baby no one gives a fuck
