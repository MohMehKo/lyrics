Let me speak, there’s some things I thought you should know
When you breathe, I feel a heart attack coming on
And I can’t wait to watch the world slip away
When I leave attach a piece of you to my ghost
Cause I can’t stray too far from the one that I love
If they grieve I’ll send a sign to let them know
That I was okay to watch it all disappear
I’m not afraid of the fight, I’m just afraid of the fall
When I look up at the sky, I see it all crashing down. On and on…
And it breaks you
And it aches to the bone
Time heals nothing it just buries the wound
Why should I learn to accept when I have nothing to prove?
So if time means nothing why do we still watch our clocks count down?
My chest is empty, and yet they want me to talk
This face holds nothing, there’s no emotion to grasp
I’ve lost my faith, and now I am shattered like glass
I need to feel something else, I need to feel something else.
I wanna to feel something, I wanna to feel something else. I wanna feel
When you leave, it’s like a heart attack letting go
