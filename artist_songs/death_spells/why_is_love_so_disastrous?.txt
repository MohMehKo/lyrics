(Love breeds war, our death defines us)

What if we try?
Why is love so disastrous?
What if we survive?
Would it change anything?
What if we try?
Why is love so disastrous?
What if we survive?
Would it change anything?

Most days we watch our best friends die
I try just to understand why but...
My machine gun interrupts any such questioning
It's hard to look to heaven when the bombs keep falling

What if we try?
Why is love so disastrous?
What if we survive?
Would it change anything?

Is God's will really murder flooding the streets?
Can we measure her love by the oil underneath?
All I ever wanted was what I was told I was owed
At what cost? I'll never know

(These young hearts rigged to explode)
Most days I watch my best friends die
(These young hearts do what they're told)
Sit back and watch the whole world burn
(These young hearts rigged to explode)
Most days I watch my best friends die
(These young hearts do what they're told)

What if we try?
Why is love so disastrous?
What if we survive?
Would it change anything?

I tried to say goodbye, but the bombs got louder
I thought I heard you cry, but the bombs got louder
I scream my prayers at the sky, but the bombs got louder
I lost my faith in faith
(These young hearts rigged to explode)
(These young hearts do what they're told)
Everything I ever knew is falling apart

What if we try?
Why is love so disastrous?
What if we survive?
Would it change anything?

It makes me sick these things we've done
In my heart I know we're all damned
It makes me sick these things we've done
In my heart I know we're all damned
