I want nothing more than to see your smile fade
Flood the hall with original sin
I know what it is to be in love with loneliness
I’ve come to grips with my malcontent and
Channeled rage is a cause I can stand behind
So mow ‘em down cause they don’t mean shit
Take my lead, just stay asleep, cause honesty is…
Such a let down
I took all the drugs that guaranteed my normalcy
I took a swim in their disappointment
Cause no one cares til your pain becomes lucrative
So give ‘em hell, cause ‘em pain, make ‘em hurt
Sell your soul for a piece of Hollywood
And listen close to a million hearts breaking
Your hopes and your dreams
Are ripped at the seams
They’re bought and they’re sold to the highest bidder
You’re soaked in regret
You’re taught to accept
That your world is in debt to the highest bidder
I can’t control what my heart tells my head,
if my heart tells my head that it needs to destroy everything in its path.
Cause my love will tear your pretty little head from it’s neck
You’re soaked in regret
You’re taught to accept
That your world is in debt to the highest bidder
Officer, no officer no…
Off with their heads
