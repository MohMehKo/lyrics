No matter what I do to you, it’s never enough to break you
The respect is gone, and the taste is lost
I brushed it off, when I felt you come
The things we knew, or thought we knew
The place we go, every time we’re pushed
Let’s grow old…
I’m empty. I feel nothing. Yet I feel everything
The times we had, the loves we lost
I needed more, than could be bought
In spite of me, in spite of you
I felt it all, coursing through…
Let’s grow old, and let the good die young
I unravel in waves of red
Full fledged and litmus tested
My carnage wears shades of blue
I’m forced to conceal this side of you
But it opened up both my eyes
To false gods and shameless pride
Let’s grow old, and let the good die young
There’s no sun here only false starts
Living free with robotic parts
Killing time with a heart of gold
Poor living until a dream I stole
I’m unscathed cause those dogs don’t bite
Fuck faith if hate gets paid
Let’s grow old, and let the good die young
I won’t give in to you
I unravel in waves of red
Full fledged and litmus tested
My carnage wears shades of brown
I’m forced to contain this side of you
But it opened up both my eyes
To false gods and shameless pride
Let’s grow old, and let the good die young
I burn bright in razor wire
I like to fuck but my love gets tired
They’re milky white but they smell like shit
Full framed and their numbers unlisted
The cross I bear is alkaline
The sleep I lost built a nice dream house
Let’s grow old, and let the good die young
