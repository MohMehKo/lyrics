Paranoid, so paranoid, shut it out, I'm on self-destruct
I can't deal with the pains in my head
Medicate the suffocation with bullshit arrogance
I'm in love with a suicide
In too deep is just a state of mind
Self-sedation is my fucking 9 to 5
With a death obsession working overtime
I can't get clean, some scars won't leave, I won't come clean
Paranoid, feed the void, running low, I'm so fucking weak
Shit gets real when your friends end up dead
Lying in a puddle on the side of the bed
But nothing says I love you like a capital crime
I'm praying for injection instead of 25
I can't take this fucking noose on my neck
Barbiturate, Percocet, caffeinated suspect
I'm in love with my suicide
Playing the victim is such a waste of time
Medicating to keep yourself alive
Autopilot drug sick kicks into overdrive
I won't come clean, I won't come clean
Paranoid, just feed the void, shut it out, this mic's set to stun
I can't deal with the pains in my head
Medicate the suffocation with bullshit arrogance
I'm in love with a suicide
In too deep is just a state of mind
But I can come clean
You can trust me
Rest your hopes on my lips and taste my venom
Let my sorrow weigh you down and feed upon you
