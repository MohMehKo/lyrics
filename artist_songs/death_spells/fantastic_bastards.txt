We're never good enough
Except when you've had too much to drink
To think, to care

These broken bones go nice
With that light you hate to see me in
'Cause it seems I'm a mess when you touch
(don't fucking touch me)

Take care of everyone
Except for those that care for you
But it's fine,
They don't mind
'Cause they know you're a fuck

I hate everything I do
'Cause I learnt it from you
I'm your bastard
But I'm not anything like you
'Cause I'm fantastic!
But I'm still not worth your time

So sick of covering up
These blacks and blues and cuts
'Cause they're mine
To look fine
But they don't
'Cause I'm more than your words

I've finally had enough
And I'm finally all grown up
So this time,
You're all mine
You look scared
'Cause' you know I'm a fuck

[2x]
I hate everything I do
'Cause I learnt it from you
I'm your bastard
But I'm not anything like you
'Cause I'm fantastic!
But I'm still not worth your time

Sirens, sirens, sirens come and take me away.
