In a few moments we begin self hypnoses
And naturally start to relax deeply
(I am on my way)

Learning how to go into hypnosis is a skill
And you'll be learning it each time you hear this recording
It's like a dance where my voice will lead you
And you will naturally follow
Allowing yourself to go along with the suggestions being made
If you're telling yourself this isn't working
Than that indeed is the reason that it isn't working
Convincing yourself that it is working
Is perhaps the very essence of hypnosis
So now sit comfortably in a chair with your legs uncrossed
Feet flat on the floor and your hands resting on your lap
Or on you legs, or on the arms of a chair
Or lie down and close your eyes
And begin to listen more closely to my voice
While there is no harm in falling asleep
And it indeed indicates that you did relax deeply
It's generally better to stay conscience
And absorb what is being said
In a few moments I'm going to ask you to look up above your head
And to naturally turn to the light
And this way your eyes will be turned strongly upward
And will start to feel strained and grow tired
And I'll begin to count down from five down to one
Until the eyes naturally close
So now open your eyes
And turn them upwards to gaze at a spot nearly directly above you
And imagine a point of light shining directly into your eyes
I'm going to count from five down to one
And as I do so your eyes will begin to feel tired and heavy
Like they want to close
...Simply let them close
And now
Five, four, three
Your eyes are are getting tired
Two
Eyes are getting very tired
One
I've been having overwhelming
Thoughts of sadness and self-harming
My depression's unimpressive
Stems from stress
Or so they tell me
I'm so fine yeah
Uninspired
Guess I'm preaching to the choir
Pessimistic, narcissistic, introspective
Hate required
My obsession with contrition
Leave me weak and feeling tired
I'm self-conscience
Have no conscience
Stay asleep
It's how I'm wired
Single serving
I'm self serving
Showing signs of drunk behavior
I'm so fucked up
Tired of feeling fine
Let go
I am on my way
Let go
