[Verse 1]
Yo, now ever since I was young, had a gift for the tongue
This shit might open the door
Fruit loop for the young, honeycomb for some
22 put piff in a bowl
And I was bent into corners, hot boxin' the sauna
I've been focused gettin' closer to ghosts
And I be sippin' the bit probably sippin a bitch
I ain't really into tippin the hoes
See my brother got weight, my sister at home
When I get straight my sister gettin flown
Couple nephews, my niggas gettin grown
Mikey D stay down, nigga gettin on
Can I get a glass cup and a lil' Henny
I'm, too cold but a little timid
I blow checks save a lil' penny
I'm too young for some big money
Ooh come girl get some dick from me
My job needs some piss from me
Uhn, lil bro can you fuck with me
Came through at the last minute
Lil' wasting my time, lacing with perks
Perks in a bind
Hazy oh baby I'm better when blind
I don't see nothin' this perfect can find

[Hook]
We are the young and Xanax
There's nowhere to go
To hide from your lows
We are the young and Xanax
There's nowhere to go
Stuck on the high

[Verse 2]
My son sleep, I'm rollin it up I don't sleep
I'm runnin' for bucks, don't tweet
You fuckin' with us I won't eat
Start stomping your feet, I need that
Depending on all of you feedback
Come out to my show and come feed that
Can't go back to sellin' that retail
My daddy left me with no details
Came back with a bitch and a stepson
I guess he forgot that he left somethin'
He must have been saving the best burn
She screaming out give me the rest hun
Pearl neckless I empty my left nut
Most niggas can't fuck with my worse shit
I'm scribing my living with curses
Just wait till I get this shit perfect
You niggas can't fuck with my verses
See they really don't think that I'm bout this
Don't make me come run in your houses
We know where your mamma your dad lives
Ooh baby [?]
My niggas got triggas and fast lit
Don't like how we living it lasts
You out of your trigger and backseat
Just looking at the shooter it's Mike D
Your rosary shining so nicely
We innocent kids if you ask me
I rode in the Benz in the backseat
Them vices they swarm and attack me
Got diamonds and niners upon me
That Juvie that Percy that Bun B
Sell track in this black while we dumping

[Hook]
