Hop on the road and say
That it was love last night
I know the world can wait

We don't usually take that long
I gotta, gotta new me, yeah
TV shows
We ain't that far from home
I used to could've, would've, should've
If I want it you be waitin' till the mornin' for real
Cause she told me I'm a light weight
This ain't love low tide
You love lo-los
In your eyes singing your song
Like

We don't usually take that long
The gallon, gallon of weed here
TV shows
We ain't that far from home
I used to could've, would've, should've
If I want it you be waitin' till the mornin' for real

Hop on the road and say
That it was love last night
I know the world can wait
I ain't been there in so long
You take me back to '99
I ain't been there in so long
You take me back to '99
I ain't been there in so long
You take me back to '99

I heard they boy ainâ€™t got no sandwich
But your mama got some cabbage
Tell me would you steal it from her?
I run away, I run away, it ain't nothin' on the TV
Baby tell me what you stealin' from
I tried to get to know you
Like lies and matrimony
I heard the moon ain't got no sandwich
But your mama got some cabbage
Tell me would you steal it from her?

Is it okay to come down sometimes?
Wow it's so good comin' down

We don't usually take that long
The gallon, gallon of weed here
We don't usually take that long
The gallon, gallon of weed here
