[Chorus:]
8 AM in the mornin' I be sippin' on the Henny (Henny, Henny)
You been lookin' for the wrong one, wrong one, wrong one
Ain't thinkin' bout your love I be shittin' on your feelings (feelings, feelings)
And you be lovin' on the wrong one, wrong one, wrong one

My daddy taught me how to drink my pain away (pain away)
My daddy taught me how to lease somebody (somebody)
My daddy taught me how to smoke my load and go (load and go)
My daddy taught me you don't need nobody (nobody)
So one time for the caged bird, caged bird, caged bird
And one time for the real niggas, real niggas, real niggas
And slow dance on the Jäger, Jäger, Jäger
And one time for the little niggas, little niggas, little niggas

[Chorus]
