I feel so dirty when I pitch it right, yeah
I make you nervous, how I get you right, yeah
I think my hoe might be the preacher wife, yeah
I mean my hoe might be the sneaky type, yeah

Yeah, I had a double with a donut, out in Dublin
Tell a bitch talk dirty to my other head
Yeah, the prison wall or water fountain with the liquor call
If them bitches call, I'm the rhetoric
Yeah, I got to quit fucking with that medicine
Guilt trips give me stiff lips and a pair of kids
This my enemy, this my bro, this my other bitch
What you want to do? On the real, this some gutter shit
So-Cal, cutter, I smile for the fuck of it
East side nigga, Chat-town with no funnel cake
Ink pen got me more Benz than my brother make
Resonate, put that Phen away, let me elevate
Thank God for my bank card and my get-a-way
That's a cool bitch, where's my dog, this the other day
That's a cool bitch, where's my dog, this the other day
Living dude, pimpin', are you down? Are you hungry?
Oh, say it loud, tell your friends I got 100 dick
Dudes who done had the worst time be the funniest
Back when they call me Akon, I was running shit
Vision is, 60-40 something, but I'm kickin' it
Wait, I was taught as to live, it's only pimpin' bitch
You just get it and live, and watch the chemistry
Look, now, found me a pill, I got another string
Blacked out, tripping again, and met another me

All by myself, I felt ashamed
Please bring me down
Please bring me down
All by myself, I felt ashamed
Please bring me down
Please bring me down

I need the white walls, white halls
Where it ain't that hard to be myself
Thank God, thank God
I'm here, I'm home
I need the white walls, the white halls
Where it ain't that hard to be myself
Thank God, thank God
I'm here, I'm home
I need the white walls, white walls
Where it...
Got me feelin like please bring me down
Please bring me down
I need the white walls, white walls
Please bring me down
