Bitch you know you can't parallel park anyway

We can't be no number one, but we can be the jam
Cause what these niggas on, is not my favorite song
I'm not no number one
Cause they gone do you wrong, and they gon' play you out
Alright, alright, alright
We can't be no number one, but we can be the jam
Cause what these niggas on, is not my favorite song
I'm not no number one
Cause they gone do you wrong, and they gon' play you out
Alright, alright, alright

Back when my brother sold crack and my sister was a real one
Always was a real one
Saw you workin' early, tell me how you feel, huh?
Baby what's your hurry, get it how you live, huh?
Baby what's your name?, I've been goin' through a lot
I can't do this on my own, got no place to go Rashad
And that's a long way
Hey they gone love you when you're hot
They won't miss you when you gone if you're looking for a spot
That's the wrong way

But we can be the jam
Cause what these niggas on, is not my favorite song
I'm not no number one
Cause they gone do you wrong, and they gon' play you out
Alright, alright, alright
We can't be no number one, but we can be the jam
Cause what these niggas on, is not my favorite song
I'm not no number one
Cause they gone do you wrong, and they gon' play you out
Alright, alright, alright

Back when my sister sold hair
Heard you lookin' for the deal huh, get it how you live huh
Damn you caught me splurgin', lookin' for the real ones
If I make it early, get it for the little ones
I can see your pain, hope my voice is helping out
Hope your momma workin' out, she won't even come out the house
Heard she had a surgery, granny died before the drop
I don't like to visit home, I don't like to see the drought
Call me when you steppin' out, I might bring the cup with me
I might play the "Back and Forth", on my '94 Aali
We can split a O or three, this is how it's supposed to be
Like we had a better trial, fuck the jury, fuck with me

We on our own huh, but we can be the jam
Cause what these niggas on, is not my favorite song
I'm not no number one
Cause they gone do you wrong, and they gone play you out
Alright
We can't be no number one, but we can be the jam
Cause what these niggas on, is not my favorite song
I'm not no number one
Cause they gone do you wrong, and they gone play you out
Alright, alright, alright
We can't be no number one, but we can be the jam
Cause what these niggas on, is not my favorite song
I'm not no number one
Cause they gone do you wrong, and they gone play you out
Alright
