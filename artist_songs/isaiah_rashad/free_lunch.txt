You know it's scrub
It's scrub, hahah
Meal, meal

Meal ticket, ticket, meal ticket, ticket, come up, uh
Still in my liver, real niggas in my condom, huh
Phil hit me back, filled this one with a powder pack
Pill bring me back, feel this one out in California

The flow is good, the hoe is good
The show is good, you know it's scrub
Cool as me out from the Kanku's store
Kinfolk you know it's love
Clean as Tide, Aveeno
Head and shoulders, hoe you know it's scrub
Shoutout to my kinfolk
Just got on that Coca-Cola scrub
Watch my pole vault and my go-kart
This might get awake as fuck
In my hood we call it buck
Fuck 'bout what you think of me
All my hoes be nines and dimes
All she want is chicken grease
All you know is what your mammy taught you
Bout the surface, get your...

Trunk was full of wrappers
Loanin' the cop was cool, we smoked in peace
Ain't we dem to move
An ATM might buy the atrium
Where you Zay? Highway 58 at my cousin house
Nowadays I like to bring my nephews and my budget out
I come from where you can't suck my dick
And leave my cousin out
In my hood we call it clout
Fuck 'bout what you think of me
All my hoes be nines and dimes
All she want is chicken grease
All you know is what your mammy taught you
Bout the surface, get your...

Away, way, way

Away, way, way
They gon' bring you down and burn you out and fade away
