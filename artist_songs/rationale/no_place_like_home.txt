When you're lonely
Do you think of me
And the way you used to love me?
And the way you used to love me?
When you're lonely
Do you toss and turn in the night?
Is the grass still as green as you thought it was?
Are you thinking in the back of your mind

There ain't no place like home
There ain't no place like home
Click your heels and go
There ain't no place like home

It's been a whole year
And I still feel the same for you
Baby, we had to away
To understand there ain't no substitute
For what we have is written
And we can fight it as much as we like
But at the end of the day
You cannot ignore the voice inside

There ain't no place like home
There ain't no place like home
Click your heels and go
There ain't no place like home

I will be waiting for you
I will be waiting for you
I will be waiting for you
Ain't no place like home

There ain't no place like home
There ain't no place like home
Click your heels and go
There ain't no place like home
