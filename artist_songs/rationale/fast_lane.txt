Everybody speeds in the fast lane truly now
Revving through the gears trying to keep ourselves from stressing out, out
Take a look in your heart and your soul
Is this really it? Is it all that you are?
We’re so caught up in the riddle and we suffer for so little, oh lord

Holding back the tears on the last train homeward bound
It’s been 27 years and you’ve only now just figured out, how
You can give him your heart and your soul
You can give him every ounce that you are
But when you’re caught up in the riddle
Man, your pride ain’t worth a nickel, no no
