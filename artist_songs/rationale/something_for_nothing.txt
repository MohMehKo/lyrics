Everybody wants something for nothing
Everybody wants a piece of your spark
I just want to be the one you call when things go worst
And I'll come running, yeah I'll come running

Everybody wants something for nothing
Everybody wants the key to your heart
I just want to be the one you call when things go worst
And I'll come running, yeah I'll come running

Cause you give me just a little glimpse
Of a joy that lies within the mist
I just want to be the one you call when things go worst
And I'll come running, yeah I'll come running

Everybody wants something for nothing
But nobody wants to love who you are
I just want to be the one you call when things go worst
And I'll come running, yeah I'll come running

Cause you give me just a little glimpse
Of a joy that lies within the mist
I just want to be the one you call when things go worst
And I'll come running, yeah I'll come running

They can try but they won't ever hold me back from
Those burning bridges keeping us apart
Let's turn this nothingness back into something
Calling, I'll come running to you

Cause you give me just a little glimspe
Of a joy that lies within the mist
I just want to be the one you call when things go worst
And I'll come running, yeah I'll come running
Cause you give me just a little glimpse
Of a joy that lies within the mist
I just want to be the one you call when things go worst
And I'll come running, yeah I'll come running
