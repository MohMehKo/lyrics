These hands
The story I could tell with these hands
Everything that I've done
Don't be told by trace and fingertips down my palms
Like you are right now, right now

I open up my palms to you
So I can let you in
This window to my soul
That I wear on my skin
Open up my palms for you
So I can let you in
This window to my soul
That I wear on my skin

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
They're an open book
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
They open up for you

These hands
The glory I've held with these hands
Every war that I've won
I fought them all so I could lay in bed in your arms
With no fear of no one

I open up my palms to you
So I can let you in
This window to my soul
That I wear on my skin
Open up my palms for you
So I can let you in
This window to my soul
That I wear on my skin

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
They are an open book
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
They open up for you

They're an open book
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
They open up for you
Everything of these heights left is mine
Each breath, every break they have
Everything of these heights left is mine
Each breath, every break they have

I open up my palms to you
So I can let you in
This window to my soul
That I wear on my skin
Said I open up my palms for you
So I can let you in
This window to my soul
That I wear on my skin

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
They're an open book
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
They open up for you
