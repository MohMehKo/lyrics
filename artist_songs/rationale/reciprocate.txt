Red light, I wanna be the one you owe tonight
It doesn't have to be so black and white
I want you all tonight
Don't shut me out, don't shut me out

Tell me that you want me
Tell me that you give as much as me, ohhh
I can't have you, promise
Everything is honest, oh please

Reciprocate my love
Take a chance and risk it all for me
Isn't it enough?
I've been holding on for you and me, you and me
You and me, you and me

I despair
There's something so I know that you care
You can always count on me to give you love and empathy yeah
But don't shut me out, don't shut me out

Tell me that you want me
Tell me that you give as much as me, ohhh
I can't have you, promise
Everything is honest, oh please

Reciprocate my love
Take a chance and risk it all for me
Isn't it enough?
I've been holding on for you and me, you and me
You and me, you and me

You keep making it hard for me
Heaven knows that I tried
I give all in, I keep waiting for you

Reciprocate my love, oh yeah
Take a chance and risk it all for me
Isn't it enough?
I've been holding on for you and me, you and me
You and me, you and me
Reciprocate my love
You and me, you and me
Reciprocate my love
