Imagine if we had a choice
Yeah I bet we'd add fuel to the fire
And yeah imagine if we had a voice
What would we say that'd just deny us?

Gone are the days of virtue and honor
Rights that we fought for, burn down the wall
Let it never be said that
We truly learned from darker days

Pressure, it keeps falling
On my shoulders, from high and low
Ain't no justice, in these moments
But we'll find comfort
When kingdom comes

They are bleeding you
Of every right we've ever earned
Until we have nowhere to turn
They add fuel to the fire

Upon other days of virtue and honor
Rights that we fought for, burn down the wall
Let it never be said that
We truly learned from darker days

Pressure, it keeps falling
On my shoulders, from high and low
Ain't no justice, in these moments
But we'll find comfort
When kingdom comes

They are bleeding you
Bleeding you
They are bleeding you
They are bleeding you
Bleeding you, bleeding you

They'll all take pleasure
If we go searching
For hand honed justice
That's what they want
So keep on fighting
Keep on striving
We'll all find comfort
When kingdom comes

Pressure, it keeps falling
On my shoulders, from high and low
Ain't no justice, in these moments
But we'll find comfort
When kingdom comes

Pressure, it keeps falling
On my shoulders, from high and low
Ain't no justice, in these moments
But we'll find comfort
When kingdom comes

(They are, they are bleeding you)
