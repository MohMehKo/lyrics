Fire in your heartbeat
A panic that you can't calm
A love that used to run deep
Has expired

There's, there's no need
To lie now, for me
And I, I won't see
A way to purge my soul of all of these regrets
I hope I get to feel again, that

Fire in your heartbeat
A panic that you can't calm
A love that used to run deep
Has expired
Fire in your heartbeat
A hesitance in your tongue
Tired but you don't sleep
You're sinking in the mire

This, misery
It reeks of cruel irony
You used to say we could have it all
If I just gave a little more hindsight
Cursed hindsight

I miss that

Fire in your heartbeat
A panic that you can't calm
A love that used to run deep
Has expired
Fire in your heartbeat
A hesitance in your tongue
Tired but you don't sleep
You're sinking in the mire

I wanna be, I wanna know
If I'm the one you still adore
Or is it time to let you go?

I wanna be, I wanna know
If I'm the one you still adore
If there's a chance, then let me know

I wanna see that

Fire in your heartbeat
A panic that you can't calm
A love that used to run deep
Has expired
Fire in your heartbeat
A hesitance in your tongue
Tired but you don't sleep
You're sinking in the mire

Fire in your heartbeat
A panic that you can't calm
A love that used to run deep
Has expired
