Throw me a rope
Oh, Marion
Cause I can't cope
In this hole
Without you
You sold me a dream
Now I'm hanging on
From my life
Out of sight
Out of mind

If deliverance from the bitterness means I'll have to let you go
Then I'll, I'll keep hanging on

I used to hope
An unbreakable
Willing mind
Driven on
By your lies
It's hard to believe
That I don't mean nothing to you
And I'll never
Back in your favour
I'm back in your arms

I hope you just carried on
Tell me how could this be
I hope that you're much, much happier
Without me

If deliverance from the bitterness means I'll have to let you go
Then I'll, I'll keep hanging on
And I know I should
For the greater good
And I already know
I need your love
You know, I need your love

You know, I need your love
You know, I need your
I need your love
