Ha hah, the remix.. five on it!
We creepin in too, baby
(We got five on ery'thang mayn)
We got uhh, Dru Down; we got the.. LUNIZ! (Shock G, whassup?)
(Know it's goin together man)	
Yeah, Richie Rich, E-40 (Spice 1)

[Verse 1: Dru Down]
You say you got five on my tender, you can bend her over the table
But be sure that you bring my stallion back to my stable
Say, bruh?  No elementary school ground playin
Not a five dollar bill, but five double zero on the real feel
I'm on the level, stayin mellow
No criticism from the fellows, hello
Being keyed durin a high-speed but still don't tap the B.B.'s
I'm D.D., Dru Down, baby

[Verse 2: Numskull]
Like Nyquil, I drop fever; so either put your five up
or ya gots to "Leave It" like "Beaver"
Cause see a, niggy perkin broke'll smoke your spliff all day
Go home and buy big drinky with his pretty then parlay
I got five on the Hennessey, Seagram's, or 40's
Cause "This is How We Do It" like Montell Jordan
I'm from the Oakland City, Frank Nitti is a goner
Knum' blowin it up like Oklahoma

[Verse 3: Richie Rich]
Put ya feev' with my fin, best believe we'll bend
Mo' corners than you thought, to somethin writers bought
Mo' C-zacks?  Believe that, tokin
Where you from?  Oakland, smokin
In attempts to crack the chest plate
The zips be so fluffy, the whole town loves me
At every event I'm sacked up
So if ya need me, scream "Double R" when ya see me

[Chorus: Michael Marshall]

I got five on it ("Got it good!")
Grab your fo', let's get keyed
I got five on it..
Messin with that endo weed!
I got five on it ("Got it good!")
It's got me stuck, cannot go back
I got five on it..
Potnah, let's go half on a sack!

[Verse 4: E-40]
E-40.. why ya treat me so bad? 40 makes it happen
Fives gets slapped and revenue grows
from just a little bit of lightweight flamboastin
Potent fumes lingerin mighty clouds and Northern Lights
You expect to vick the baron
and you'll be violatin my civil rights
I'm startin to feel my scrilla 
but perhaps today my scrilla ain't feelin me
For the simple fact that I'm off to the track with hella fools B
Pockets empty, pitchin five, man I'm dusted
Took off my hat, passed it around, man sprinkle me

[Verse 5: Yukmouth]
Me and E-40 to the head, comin fed plus, you let the lead bust
Ready to do a murda, mayn; perved off the Hurricane
Slurred again, witness what bein off two-fifths equal
Me killin people like Jason, facin death every sequel
(Insane in the membrane!) "Bring the Pain" like Method
Neglected, smokin kryptonite to the brain for breakfast
Guzzle the Hen-do, finsta do the evil that men do
Give me feev', I shall proceed to continue

[Chorus]

[Verse 6: Shock G]
Yeah, it's been a while since I've hollered from the town
Mess around and heard Yuk and Knum, said I gotta be down
Cause new styles is goin down, look around you
Tunes from the Lunz spreadin round and round you
Back to get my O on, they let me flow on
The thirty-five on it, yeah, I'm on it
Still bringin satin for them drawers
Velvet for the mic and got a pound for the cause

[Verse 7: Spice 1]
Rollin up cannabis seteva, hittin the Mary Jane
Smokin the five before it's tweleve o'clock, sippin on Hurricane
Ready to smoke on the endo; rollin up my window, fin' to go to the land
With a hand fulla broccoli, when it comes to the sticky I'm the man
Crush nasty I be hittin the J so hard I earl
Fall on the floor fittin to have a stroke T-H-C ain't no joke
I got five on ery'thing, let's get loaded and smoke
S-P-I-C-E about to hit it an' croaaaakkkkk

[Chorus]

Yeahhah, whassup baby?
It's me, your boy with the kick that's always tight
You a little short on some ends?
Don't worry, I'll take care of that, I got five on that
I got you
