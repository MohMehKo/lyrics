Creep on in.....
Woah, see I'm ridin high......woahoooh
Kinda rough to see em all so all I got is 5, I got 5

[Yukmouth:]
Player, give me some brew and I might just chill
You know Stoned Is The Way Of The Walk like Cypress Hill
But still groupie [BACKWARDS] hoochies wanna puff on it
I got some bucks on it but it ain't enough on it
Go get the S-T I-D-E-S, nevertheless
I'm hella fresh, no sweat, roll em like cigarettes
So pass it across the table like ping pong
I'm gone, beating my chest like King Kong
It's on, wrap my lips around a 40
And when it comes to get another stogie
fools all kick in like Shinobi
Homie you don't know me to begin with
There's too many heads to be poppin it at my friend hit bit'
Unless you pull out the fat crispy
five dollar bill on the real before it's history
Cos fools be havin them vacuum lungs
and if you let em hit it for free you hella dum-dum-dum-dum
I come to school with a vaga on my earlobe
Fave for players, stay away from haters and weirdos
that be blowin off the land like "Where the bomb at?"
Give me two bucks, you take a puff and pass my bomb back
Suck up the sack like a slurpy
I'm serious-ly toe-back, straight Delirious like Eddie Murphy
I got more Growin' Pains than Maggie
cos homies nag me, to take the broccoli out the baggy

[Chorus:]
I got 5 on it
Grab your 4 and let's get keyed
I got 5 on it
Messin with that indo weed
I got 5 on it
It's got me stuck and I'm toe-back
I got 5 on it
Potna let's go half on a sack

[Numskull:]
Check it out
I take sacks to the face whenever I can, don't need no crutch
I'm so keyed up, til the greenery's burnin my hand
Next time I roll it in a hamper
to burn slow, so the ashes won't be burnin at my hair, bra
Hoochies can hit it but they know they got to pitch in then
I roll stoge's longer than your extension
Cos I'll be damned if you get high off me for free
Hell no, you best to bring your own spliff chief
Wassup? Don't make me sip that, best ta pass the
CHRON-CHRON, stop hittin cos you know you got asthma
Crack the 40 open homey, and guzzle it
Cos I know the broccoli's in my system gettin lonely
I gots ta take a whiz test to my P-O
I know I'll fail cos I been gettin keyed bro
And everytime we with Chris that fool rollin up fatties
but the Tanqueray straight had me

[Chorus]

[Numskull:]
Eh, make this right mayn, stop at the light mayn
My yesternight thang got me hung off the night train
You fade, I face so let's head to the East
Hit the stroll to 9-0 so we can roll for cheap
I wish I could fade the eighth
but I'm low budget, still rollin the two-do' Cutlass, same ol' bucket
Foggy windows, drink in hand
In the land gettin smoked wit my kinfolk

[Yukmouth:]
you ain't know
Yuk'll spray ya, lay ya down
Up in the O-A-K the Town
Homies don't play around, we down to blaze a pound
Then eaze up, speed up thru the E-S-O
Drink the VSOP up with the lemon squeeze up
in your throat, we broke but we smoke like a chimney
cos it's the remedy like Hennessey
We fin' to be over mayn, I told ya
If you don't got 5 on it you can't get high on it

[Chorus]
