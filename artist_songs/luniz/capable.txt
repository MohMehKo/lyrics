[Yukmouth: talking w/Num in the background]
Southwest Ridas playboys (Ya highness!)
Fuckin wit tha Luniz (tha Luniz are here!)
We back in this mutha fucka
9-Scrillion, bout ta make a million bucks (E-40!, E-40 man!)
Ya Capable (B-Legit!)
Eh, here ye here ye (B-Legit!)
All the pimps, playas an hustlas, get ya bread on mayne (B-Legit!)

Ya Capable
Peep it.

[Verse 1: Yukmouth]
Eh, eh uh
Live an direct
4-5 an a Tech
niggas be bustin in disguise like why would you lie
when cops arrive on the set
dope fiends die over a check
ya niggas strive fo tha best
to get some seats to rest in peace
but funk don't die on tha set
you must lie fo yo set
an if you ride fo the set keep yo vest handy
Understands me?
Lace tha family wit candy like Willie Wonka
fiends pull up to my bumpa
infedamines, an green marijuana
whatever you want a nigga got it
slangin narcotics
I juss socked tha shit out a fiend fo runnin off wit a nigga product
heiron he shot it
into his veins
got it by sellin everythang
that's when he broke into his older son house mayne
it's strange to watch ya dad box
ya beat ta death talkin about, "All you had to do was ask me fo some cash pops!"
but it's too late wire his shit up
jaw stiched up lip bust
fo fuckin wit us
sick ass niggas.

[Chorus x2:]
Do I starve and do without
stay about your paper route
get yo cash
ya Capable.
Stay about your paper route
(Niggas!)
Ya Capable
Stay about your paper route
(Bitches!)
Ya Capable.
Ya Capable.

[Verse 2: Numskull]
For a nigga that make stacks
he got to pack Mac's
get off when shit hap's
shit off some stanky before
a nigga gets kidnapped
should'a have too late
put in halfs
been confiscated
now your whole domain is isolated
imprisoned
on the turf ya been on for long years nigga
Don't ya realize somethin is wrong here?
Should'a kept ya focus
know this shit is called
ya mail mammy
cuz mail holds together your whole family
Understand me?
Manny fuck Tony's sister
that's the reason he could come an get ya
if I snub ya
then nigga I get richer
picture this
bitch had a block
bitch slanged rocks
bitch sold glocks
an had ties wit the cops now I's
no dummy get yo bread on
but if you go the wrong route
then you will get your head gone
that's why I got capablity's
to stack some skrill
become maxin fat cats
wit the gats concealed so I.

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 3: Yukmouth]
Eh, eh
eh, eh, eh uh.
One time fo ya mind
here to represent the pimps, playas, hustlas, ballas
and my niggas on the grind
packin 9 milla-metas
9 lives like cheatas
but ya stealin reeta, drug
dealas peep tha shit that I kick
hustlin, bustin down zips makin kicks
if we ain't makin it we takin shit to the extreme
hit the scenery wit machine gun
get the creamery an ice cream ya Capable.

[Verse 4: Numskull]
That's why
greediness makes greedy dead niggas
not followin the plan makes bleedin from the head niggas
bit off a big chunk of the wrong battle that shit
fucked ya whole shit, so you scaddled
I done, did licks for kicks
went through battles an won wars dig
this rap shit is one more win he fucked wit me
loving to corrupt the city
Lord if it's my turn then please come an get me.

[Chorus x2]
