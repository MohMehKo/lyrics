11 o'clock News!

"Watch you're own back, son!"
My Dad always told me
But that wasn't in my mind
My electrical gate closing slowly!
I was thinking about my pussy upstairs
Waiting patiently
Not knowing that there's two niggas outside
What takes case of me!
Before I know it
The barrels facing me
I'm deadlocked
The pistol in my rear cage
Niggas in the headlock!
I kept the fuck quiet
So I could peep these niggas unidentified
It might [?]
They might as be some friends of me!
One shot to the cradle
My mind's kinda wonderous!
I been flossin' too much
It's about time
I got some of this
Hardcore haterism!
My time was up
When nigga called me by name I'm like:
"What the fuck?"
Stuck my head up
I heard a car in the garage
And that's when the whole fucking scene had a pause
I thank god
Cause [?] saved my fucking life
I caught eye contact
"Aw, shit! It's my wife!"
The nigga who had his hands free went straight for my honey
So I knew this robbery wasn't for no motherfucking money!
They took my pretty out in the car and put me in it!
Drove off and that's when I knew a nigga was finished!
They put me in the trunk of my own [?]
Smashed [?] bumpin'
My girl screaming
I can't do nothing!
We drove for like 20 minutes
And once we stopped
They took me outta the trunk
By your own ass [?]
And asked me:
"Who could we call to get some cash?
And if you don't do it quick
Then your punk ass won't last!"
I dialed 6-6-7-6-7-6-7-1-2-3-4-1-1-9-11
I got my ass whipped
While we was waiting for the call!
Kicked at my head and stomped on my balls
I just couldn't take no mo'
And stopped moving
I couldn't feel nothing
My whole shit was ruined
They put in the back of the trunk
Where I slept the whole day!
'til I got enough strength to kick the seat away
Drove myself home
Laid out on the couch
Drunk a whole fifth
A nigga passed out!
