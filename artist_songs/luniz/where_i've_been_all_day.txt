"Who's ass you speakin on nigga?"

I'm takin 'em all as long as they gone off the yak,

I come back from doin big thangs,
if it wasn't fo ginseng then yo pussy would be his thang,
but now.

[Chorus:]
My folks ask me where I've been all day, (all day)
an I don't think that I should say,
then they ask me again.
Tryin to hold back my smile, (big thangs, dig that)
but you can't tell that ain't my style.
then they ask me again.

[Chorus x2:]
Tryin to hold back my smile,

Then they ask me again.
Not my style. Not my style.
But you can't tell that ain't my style.
Not my style. Not my style.
But you can't tell that ain't my style.
