Remember when you had me
Wrapped around your fingers?
Trying to act all normal
Every time you'd see her
But I grew wise to your lies
Now you've lost control
Trying to find another boost for your ego
You can't help but feel me
Slipping through your fingers

You've been searching, calling my name
Left me in the dark, now you're trying to explain
You've realized your wrongs like it makes you alright
Good luck trying to find me cause I'm out of sight

Where have I gone?
Cause I've gone missing
Baby, so long
You should have listened
Where have I gone?
Cause I've gone missing
Baby, so long
You should have listened

Remember when you had me
With my heartbeat racing
Treated me so badly
Now my heart is breaking, yeah
Give enough, had enough now that you've lost control
Find another boost for your ego
Oh, you'll find yourself lonely
It's not my heart you're taking

You've been searching, calling my name
Left me in the dark, now you're trying to explain
You've realized your wrongs like it makes you alright
Good luck trying to find me cause I'm out of sight

Where have I gone?
Cause I've gone missing
Baby, so long
You should have listened
Where have I gone?
Cause I've gone missing
Baby, so long
You should have listened

Where have I gone?
Cause I've gone missing
Baby, so long
You should have listened
Where have I gone?
Cause I've gone missing
Baby, so long
You should have listened
