Breathe me deeper, I wanna feel human
Control me I hear you, don't let this disappear
It's simple, electric, and nothing can compare now
No, no one compares to you

So if you wanna stay around
Then I will never let down, down, down, down, down
You can have whatever you like (whatever you like)
Tell me what you're looking for
Say the word, I'll show you so much more
See there's no question you and I (no question you and I)

Question, question, no, no
Question, question, tell me what you think about
Question, question, no, no
Question, question, tell me what you think about
Question, question, no, no
Question, question, tell me what you think about me
Question, no, no
Question, question

Question, question
Question, question
Question, question
Question, question
Question, question
Question, question
Q-q-question, question

Closer together, now we love one another
Loving you better, it's nothing complicated
Now ain't forever, but I can guarantee
With you is where I wanna be

So if you wanna stay around (stay around)
Then I will never let you down, down, down, down, down (let you down)
You can have whatever you like (whatever you like)
Tell me what you're looking for
Say the word, I'll show you so much more (so much more)
See there's no question you and I (you and I)
