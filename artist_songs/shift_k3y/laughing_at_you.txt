[Verse 1: Ruby Francis]
What are you tryna be?
Standing there staring at me
With your hat on, jeans low, trying to impress me
Where are you gonna go?
When you no longer sleep in this home?
Cause I've found my lipstick-stained glass
Next to your phone

[Hook: Ruby Francis]
I should've been crying but I'm laughing
At what we used to be
We should've been something, now we're nothing
Now who'll I turn to?

[Verse 2: Ruby Francis]
Why are you looking my way?
When I have nothing left to say
Tryna take that trust back
Do you wanna play?
I'm not even gonna try
Listening to your lies
Wanna cut back trying
Yours then say goodbye?

[Hook]
