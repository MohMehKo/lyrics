[Hook x2:]
Yeah, now everything little thing that we do
Should be between me and you
I'll make you part of the crew
Now come and dance to my tune

[Verse 1:]
I always said I'd like to sing in choirs
Bring the noise and I'll bring the riots
I'm not into science but I'm into maths
Me + You, let's get into that
She's into me she's not into rap
She's hella soulful so I interact
Lowkey boy going internash
Imma bring the vibe, just bring the gash
Let's get it
Hello girl I'm ready
You might have seen my face on the telly
Little excited yeah I'm very
I know you've got Bearman on your BlackBerry
The way you move them hips it's scary
Me? Move the game like dairy
She? Kiss girls like Perry
Don't tell nobody not any
You get me?

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
Yeah, and I want a bad honey in the back
Put her in her jeans now she fucking with a [?]
Do it in a minute [?] I'm at my nan's
You don't care how I care you don't fucking understand
She tie me up and [?]
Anybody talking 'bout it tell 'em shut their mouth
The world need to pipe down I don't fuck around
Quiet, keep in quiet
Matter fact don't say anything keep it silent
Shhh
