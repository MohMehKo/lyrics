We used to dance together
The sky had a purple haze
Now, stops when we get up
and time just slips away

Can we get lost away from here?
Just one day, oh please say you'll do it
To be lost away, to be lost away from here
God, I'm scared if we don't dare, we'll lose
Lost awaaaaay
Lost awaaaay
Lost awaaaay
Lost awaaaay

Let's go rediscover
A world in the woods and trees
We can't be slaves to others
Lock your chains to me!

Can we get lost away from here?
Just one day, oh please say you'll do it, oh oh oh
To be lost away, to be lost away from here
God, I'm scared if we don't dare, we'll lose
Lost awaaaaay
Lost awaaaay
Lost awaaaay
Lost awaaaay
