You let go
You moved on
Was it easy?
If we're just friends
Why are you saying you need me?

You can say you're fine
But I know better
I'm still on your mind

Cause you're keep running
Stop fronting
Just keep running to me
And I like it,
Please don't fight it
Just keep running to me

Keep running
Keep running
Keep running to me
Keep running
Keep running
Keep running to me

Don't you dare
Think that I'm grow up an addicted
Cause it's you
Calling me
So who's the one who's still with me?

You can say you try
But I know better
It's my turn to play your mind

Cause you're keep running
Stop fronting
Just keep running to me
And I like it,
Please don't fight it
Just keep running to me

Keep running
Keep running
Keep running to me
Keep running
Keep running
Keep running to me, yeah

Give his hell
Give his hell
Give his hell
