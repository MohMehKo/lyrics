She beats her wings
Makes me wanna fly
The way she sings
My heart it comes alive
And everywhere she goes
Everybody knows
That I can't let her go
Lost in her fairytale

She sings uh lala
Just like a nightingale
She sings uh lala
Just like a nightingale
Lost in her fairytale

We can dream
We only have to try
Where have you been
You light my darkest night
And every day the feeling grows
And I just wanna let her know
I won't ever let her go

She sings uh lala
Just like a nightingale
She sings uh lala
Just like a nightingale
She sings uh lala
Just like a nightingale
She sings uh lala
Just like a nightingale
Lost in her fairytale

She sings uh lala
Uh lala
She sings uh lala
Just like a nightingale
Lost in her fairytale

She sings uh lala
Uh lala
She sings uh lala
Just like a nightingale
Lost in her fairytale
