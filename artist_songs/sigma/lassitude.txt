You and I are molded into one
And I can't get enough
The future is within your sights
And it's the hope you feel inside

It's gonna be alright
It's alright, alright, alright, alright
It's gonna be alright
It's alright, alright, alright, alright

I work hard every day that I'm given
Working all of your life, tell me there's no me or I
And I'm thankful every day that I'm living
Working all of your life, tell me there's no me or I

And sometimes it can get too hard standing
Working hard for your life, tell me it's gonna be alright
Baby, come on if you'd only hold my hand and

You and I are molded into one
And I can't get enough
The future is within your sights
And it's the hope you feel inside

It's gonna be alright
It's alright, alright, alright, alright
It's gonna be alright
It's alright, alright, alright, alright
[x2]
When times are hard we get together
Make the party what it is

Alright
It will be alright
