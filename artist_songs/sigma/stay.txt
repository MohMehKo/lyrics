Possible we break apart
Always been this way from the start
This energy like crashing stars
Blame it on our magnetic hearts

Gimme all of your love
I need all your love
Gimme all of your love
Stay for me, baby
Gimme all of your love
I need all your love
Gimme all of your love
Gimme all of your love
I need all your love
Gimme all of your love
Stay for me, baby
Gimme all of your love
I need all your love
Gimme all of your love
All your love
All your love
All your love

Never felt this way like I'm falling apart
Never felt this way like I'm falling apart
Something hard to explain it's been there from the start
There's a chemistry like an burning star
When we close I can't help it, babe, magnetic hearts

I, I, I, oh
Oh, oh, oh
I, I, I, oh
Oh, oh, oh
I, I, I, oh
Oh, oh, oh
I, I, I, oh

Gimme all of your love
I need all your love
Gimme all of your love
Stay for me, baby
Gimme all of your love
I need all your love
Gimme all of your love
All your love
All your love
All your love

Never felt this way like I'm falling apart
Something hard to explain it's been there from the start
There's an chemistry like a burning star
When we close I can't help it, babe, magnetic hearts
