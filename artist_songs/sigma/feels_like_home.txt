When I'm lost in the crowd
Standing in the rain
And the cost of my crown
Is a heavyweight
When I'm cold and alone
Smother by the night
You're the only one
Who can make it right

And I know how I'm supposed to feel
You're the one who keeps me real
Whenever you look at me

It feels like home
It feels like home
When I'm lost in the middle
All is forgiven
You shine a little light
And it feels like home

Nah ah ah ah ey oh oh
Nah ah ah ah ey oh oh
Nah ah ah ah ey oh oh
Nah ah ah ah ey oh oh
Nah ah ah ah ey oh oh
Nah ah ah ah ey oh oh
Nah ah ah ah ey oh oh
Nah ah ah ah ey oh oh

When I wait by myself
Envisioning your face
And when heaven and hell
Is the same place
When my feet are so far off the ground
I forget to breathe
When I need to get down
You're my gravity

And I know how I'm supposed to feel
You're the one who keeps me real
Whenever you look at me

It feels like home
It feels like home
When I'm lost in the middle
All is forgiven
You shine a little light
And it feels like home
