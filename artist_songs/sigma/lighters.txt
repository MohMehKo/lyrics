All I wanna see as the night is high
Flashing up the signal in the sky
We become a radius, we're all unites

Signal blows it up like dynamite
If you're with me in the place, put your hands up high
Let the energy roll when we blow it high
We don't need no worries and we dance tonight
People in the place, yeah we're all unites

From the front to the back, put your hands up
From the left to the right, put your hands up
If you're feeling what I'm feeling, put your hands up
Now here comes the bass, put your hands up
Go! Go!

Now here comes the bass, put your hands up
Go! Go!

All I wanna see as the night is high
Flashing up the signal in the sky
We become a radius, we're all unites
Signal blows it up like dynamite
If you're with me in the place, put your hands up high
Let the energy roll when we blow it high
We don't need no worries and we dance tonight
People in the place, yeah we're all unites

From the front to the back, put your hands up
From the left to the right, put your hands up
If you're feeling what I'm feeling, put your hands up
Now here comes the bass, put your hands up
Go! Go!
