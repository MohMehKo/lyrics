I'd make adjustments, but I'm just way too caught up in this cycle
I'll leave that all to you
They say growth is vital, does that mean that I can't pursue new heights
And still hold onto youth (life)

Lighten up, you're way too serious
You're way too caught up in what's right and what your [?]
So simmer down, simmer down, you're way too serious
You can't run away from life
You can't run away from life

Ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah
Live your life, live your life
Life
Ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah
Live your life, live your life

I see the patterns, yes I do see how your way is so secure
I'll leave that all to you
I'd rather find a balance and reach for things beyond my wildest dreams
And watch them dreams come true

Lighten up, you're way too serious
You're way too caught up in what's right and what your [?]
So simmer down, simmer down, you're way too serious
You can't run away from life
You can't run away from life

Ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah
Live your life, live your life
Life
Ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah
Live your life, live your life
