Shame that it took so long
Now we're.
We're back where we started
Loving ain't so strong
Your pulling me back
and I can't react is the reason why I can't move on!

You're the reason why I wake up
You're the meaning of my true love
It feels so good
It feels so good ooh
ooo, ooh, ooh

You're the reason why I wake up
You're the meaning of my true love
It feels so good
It feels so good ooh
ooo, ooh, ooh
Loving you!
Loving you!

Promises and endless hope
are all disreguarded
Tell me that you won't say no
Your pulling me back
and I can't react is the reason why I can't move on!

You're the reason why I wake up
You're the meaning of my true love
It feels so good
It feels so good ooh
ooo, ooh, ooh

You're the reason why I wake up
You're the meaning of my true love
It feels so good
It feels so good ooh
ooo, ooh, ooh
