Watch these times go by
Left my smile inside
There's no guarantee

That we can be alright
I know it's hard to keep
Keep believe it all, that
We can be so strong

Oh oh, wasted time on it
Broken promises
Nothing's worth of it
Watch me as I fly, with nothing on my mind
Send this sky run deep
Don't lose faith in me
Hold on, hold on

So, tell me how you feel now
Will you know what's real now?
Oh oh oh ooh ooh
Oh oh oh ooh ooh
So, tell me how you feel now
Will you know what's real now?
Oh oh oh ooh ooh
Hold on, hold on
Uuh uh uuh uh uuh uh
Watch me as I fly, with nothing on my mind
Uuh uh uuh uh uuh uh
Uuh uh uuh uh uuh uh

Won't you fly with me?
Let this love run free
'Cause moment's positive
To feel this summer breeze
Can't control this feeling
I need to hold my head up high
On I, oh I

Oh oh, wasted time it
Broken promises
Nothing's worth of it
Watch me as I fly, with nothing on my mind
Send this sky run deep
Don't lose faith in me
Hold on, hold on

So, tell me how you feel now
Will you know what's real now?
Oh oh oh ooh ooh
Oh oh oh ooh ooh
So, tell me how you feel now
Will you know what's real now?
Oh oh oh ooh ooh
Hold on, hold on
Uuh uh uuh uh uuh uh
Watch me as I fly, with nothing on my mind
Uuh uh uuh uh uuh uh
Uuh uh uuh uh uuh uh
