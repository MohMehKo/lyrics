This ain't about your love, 
This is about the life that we've been told. 
This ain't about your freedom, 
This is about the future that's unknown. 
This ain't about your forgiveness, 
This is about the life between my bones. 
This ain't about your sanity, 
This is about the thing you think you know. 
For every time I fell out to my knees, 
I know this is redemption. 
Oh, oh, for every time I said out loud my tears , 
I know this is redemption. 
Oh, oh, so Jericho is coming down, 
We're gonna burn it down, down, down, 
For every time I lost my voice, 
Oh, Lord, this is redemption. 
Oh, this is redemption, 
Oh, this is redemption, 
Oh, this is redemption, 
For every time I lost my voice, 
Oh, Lord, this is redemption. 

Oh, this is redemption, ay! 

This ain't about your history, 
This is for all our stories to be told. 
This ain't about your victory, 
This is about the place that we call home. 
So this is redemption, 
Oh, this is redemption. 
And I'd better tell â€˜em already, 
They will never stop me, 
They will never bring this down, 
If it's now, you know I'm ready. 
This fire in my belly, 
They will never bring this down. 

Oh, this is redemption, 
Oh, this is redemption, 
Oh, this is redemption, 
For every time I lost my voice, 
Oh, Lord, this is redemption. 

So we singing oh-oh-oh, 
Redemption! 
Redemption! 
Redemption! 
So we singing oh-oh-oh! 
Oh, this is redemption, 
Oh, this is redemption, 
For every time I lost my voice, 
Oh, Lord, this is redemption.
