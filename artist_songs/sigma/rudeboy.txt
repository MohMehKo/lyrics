Life, life, life. [x4]

Born as a soldier, born in the streets.
Born, we born as a rudeboy.
Born, we born as a rudeboy.
[x2]

Born in the ghettos, you have to fight for yourself.
Born in the street, you have to fend for your health.
Robbing and the rocks, trouble and the cops.
You have to fight for your freedom. ...trouble nonstop.

Young eso, only a gun shot I let go. In the ghetto, is a echo.
Police come quick so arrest so.
I like the trouble and I got, got, got rise up from amongst the rubble and the rock, rock, rock.
What I got, what you feel it got, got, got. ghetto and the trouble nonstop.

Born as a soldier, born in the streets.
Born, we born as a rudeboy.
Born, we born as a rudeboy.
