How come everything
Always has its way of turning
Right back around again
Like that night that she was leaving
And not believing that this time
Her fears were all just doubts

I'm never going back
I'm over feeling sorry so just deal with it
There's nothing wrong with that
Find comfort in yourself
I know that what you have's not what you are

What you have's not what you are
What you have's not what you are

I know this one felt right
But everytime I walk away I feel shut down inside
Today is no exception
And tomorrow breaks again
But I can see that this will soon be over

I'm never going back
I'm over feeling sorry so just deal with it
There's nothing wrong with that
Find comfort in yourself
I know that what you have's not what you are

What you have's not what you are
What you have's not what you are
What you have's not what you are
What you have's not what you are

I'm never going back
I'm over feeling sorry so just deal with it
There's nothing wrong with that
Find comfort in yourself
So you can deal with it

I'm never going back
There's nothing wrong with that
I'm never going back
Find comfort in yourself
I know that what you have's not what you are
