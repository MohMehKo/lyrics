All the times I've tried
I know they don't erase
The things that brought me down
Caused you to hurt, caused you to hate
But now I've figured out
All that we won't do
So I can see that there's no doubt
When you say I know

You're not looking
I'm still watching you
Can we forget those times
Can we move on

Please say that you
Can feel the same way that I do
Please say that I
Can be forgiven one last time

I'm lost without your sight
I can't think without your mind
There's comfort in the night
When I wake up by your side
I'm up here on my own
With nothing left to loose
I won't deny you anything
There's nothing I'll refuse

You're not looking
I'm still watching you
Can we forget those times
Can we move on

Please say that you
Can feel the same way that I do
Please say that I
Can be forgiven one last time

Can we move on

Please say that you
Can feel the same way that I do
Please say that I
Can be forgiven one last time

Please say that you
Can feel the same way that I do
Please say that I
Can be forgiven one last time

Forgiven one last time
