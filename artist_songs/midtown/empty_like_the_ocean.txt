Make my body motion, yeah the night is young
Open like the ocean, cold and numb
Dance until the sweat forms on your face
It won't take long to flush the poisons

I don't care where you come from
If it's awful there
All of us are alone
I forget where I come from
And I don't care

So what's wrong? I think too much
I don't want to fuck you, I don't want to touch
I just want to fill you with regret
I've said it all before, it's pointless

I don't care where you come from
If it's awful there
All of us are alone
I forget where I come from
What I'm doing here
It's so redundant

I don't care where you come from
If it's awful there
We are all alone
I forget where I come from
I don't care

Dance until the sweat forms on your face
