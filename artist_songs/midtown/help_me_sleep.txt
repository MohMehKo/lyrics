Shut this thing off
I can't take
Anymore
The weight is gone
Still I can't
Let it go

I can't take anymore
Is this all we are
Can you help me sleep again

My body's numb
What I touch
Turns to stone
The more I learn
The less I know
The more I'm lost

Make me forget all
Cause I can not remember anymore
Anymore
Any
