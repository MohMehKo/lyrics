I can't believe anything
Every year it's the same
Chew me up
Spit me out again

Oh, I've seen it all 
Winter, Summer, Fall
I love  you with my eyes
What's you're name

I can't believe how I'm living
Lost in Manhattan
I don't know where to go
There's no where left to go

I can't believe how I'm living
Lost in Manhattan
