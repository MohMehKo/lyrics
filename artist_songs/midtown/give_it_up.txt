This silence kills the calm
Of the night
I force an anxious patience
Counting every beat and waiting for my turn to die

Give it up, Give it up
Don't fall for the same things
Give it up, Give it up
Don't fall for mistakes that I've made
Don't turn away

I understand your ways
Won't give it up

It's not me you're waiting for
Alright, stop waiting
It's not me you're waiting for
It's time to let go, time to let it go

And when
You become
All you've lost
Wandering the streets and searching for a place to die

Give it up, Give it up
Don't fall for the same things
Give it up, Give it up
Don't fall for mistakes that I've made
Don't turn away

I understand your ways
Won't give it up

It's not me you're waiting for
Alright, stop waiting
It's not me you're waiting for
This is where it ends
It's not me you're waiting for
It's time to let go, time to let it go
This is where it ends
And if you promise to forget
I'll try to find a way to make mistakes
Make mistakes

Give it up, Give it up
Try to find a way
[x4]

It's not me you're waiting for
It's not me you're waiting for
Alright, stop waiting
It's not me you're waiting for
Alright, stop waiting
It's not me you're waiting for

Give it up, Give it up
Don't fall for the same things (Alright, stop waiting)
Give it up, Give it up
Don't fall for mistakes that I've made (Alright, don't give it up)
Don't turn away
Give it up, Give it up
Don't fall for the same things
Don't turn away
Give it up, Give it up
Don't fall for mistakes that I've made
Don't turn away
