I'm still waiting for the news dad,
That she's gone and never coming back.
I can't go on because the strength I had is gone
And I find it hard to get out of bed

Oh yeah, don't you know it's true son,
You can never know someone
Even though we sleep together we're alone
And I find it hard to get out of bed

And we operate but
I still feel alone
And I can't complain
Cause she's beautiful
Yes we all have made mistakes

Even though we sleep together we're alone
Yes we've all made mistakes
Even though we sleep together we're alone
And I find it hard to get out of bed
