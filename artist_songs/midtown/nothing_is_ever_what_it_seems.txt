O Tear it back, tear it slow
Lose-yourself, lose control
Listen close, there's something you need to hear
If just this once       

Everyday the same joke
I never think it's funny
Nothing's ever what it seems
The truth becomes a dream
And we reach for what we're missing in ourselves

I fought away this desperation
I've made attempts to quell temptation
I swear to God I tried
We could never compromise
You could never change me

'Cause we reach for what we're missing in:
We don't know how to let love in
Don't you cry for me
Because I'm already dead
