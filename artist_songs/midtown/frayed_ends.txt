Fraying all the ends
You are the last one who can recognize his friends
And nothing ever changes
You're always exchanging peace of mind
For everything you want
Everything.
You want it all
I can see it in your eyes
I can see right through you
There's nothing to you
You’re telling lies
And you'll surround yourself with
Everyone who says what you need to feel all right
Why can’t you be strong?
Fraying all the ends
You are the last one who can recognize his friends

You're always exchanging peace of mind
For everything you want
Everything.
You want it all
I can see it in your eyes
I can see right through you
There's nothing to you
You  conjure lies
And you'll surround yourself with
Everyone who says what you need to feel all right
Everyone who speaks the words
That make you perpetually contrived
They say what you want to hear
Say what you want to hear
What you want to
Why can't you be strong?
