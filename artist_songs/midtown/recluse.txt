I've heard advice
That anger soon subsides
And you go on with your life
And gain new insight
But inside
I'm thinking that just won’t suffice
Cause I'm sure I'd like to take it back
And kill it at the start

Yeah, it's from the heart
Yeah, we're taking care of every single one of us

Who do you trust?

If we could be recluse
And I could bring a lifetime of abuse
Anywhere, I'd be killing you
My anger still persists
And it will not desist until I manifest on you

Wouldn't it be life to test 
How thin I wear
When I remember you
