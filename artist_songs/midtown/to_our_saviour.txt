So hard to believe what you're looking for

You cry again
To save yourself
But you could
Never understand their pain

It's all a game 
You play yourself
And you will
Never understand the pain

I'll move on tomorrow
We can try again
And when their hope is gone
I'm waiting

I'll move on tomorrow
We can try again
And when their hope is gone
I'm waiting

I'll move on tomorrow
We can try again
You're my savior
You're my savior

You cry again
To save yourself
You feel ashamed
Never understand the pain

All you're missing
Is an honest
Presentation
I hope you understand this pain

You can pretend but I'm not buying it
Can pretend, but I'm not buying it
Can pretend, but I'm not buying it

You're my savior So hard to believe what you're looking for
You're my savior So hard to believe what you're looking for
You're my savior So hard to believe what you're looking for
Right.
Write.
