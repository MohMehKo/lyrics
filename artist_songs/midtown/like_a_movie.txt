She tries to erase
She tries to replace
How it feels, but I...
Know she can never go home
She tries to erase
She tries to replace
How it feels, but I...
Know she can never go home

Tried to forget about
Living a good life
Free of positions
Make her feel vulnerable
She's loved and she's lost
She failed in the call
She seeks to find the answer, now

Woke up today around 6 in the morning
Violently shaking, remembering what she once saw
She bared it alone
So she carried on
She seeks to find the answers for...

The reasons her life did not turn out...
More like a movie
She's trying to forget it all

She tries to erase
She tries to replace
How it feels, but I...
Know she can never go home
She tries to erase
She tries to replace
How it feels, but I...
Know she can never go home

The reasons her life did not turn out...
More like a movie
She's trying to forget it all
I don't believe in anything
But I believe in you
I never trusted anyone
But somehow I trust you
And if I fall away, someday you might find me
If I fall away, someday...

She tries to erase
She tries to replace
How it feels, but I...
Know she can never go home
She tries to erase

How it feels, but I...
