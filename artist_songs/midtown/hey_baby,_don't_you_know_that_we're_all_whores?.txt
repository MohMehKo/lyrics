Hey baby, spare me your pretension
I know you can't spread an infection

Yeah the drama never ends
The doctors say that
It's too late now
Suffocation
Suffocation
Leave it alone

Hey do we stand at revelation
JESUS FORGIVE MY CONGREGATION

Yeah the drama never ends
The doctors say that
It's too late but I'm still waiting
I love the way conquer style
I love how children lack your vision
I love the way you're smothered
Suffocation
Suffocation
Leave it alone

Yeah the drama never ends
But now it's time you learn:
Baby, We're whores
Nothing less and nothing more

I love the way you conquer style
I love how children lack your vision 
I love the way you're reaching for that gun

Leave it alone
