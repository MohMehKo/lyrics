God I wish I could hate you for the rest of my...

You can never tell me I shouldn't walk away
it's foolish to assume that I'll be coming back another day
you were never right and I was never wrong
does truth lie in sincerity of another sullen song

Cause you were right then I should have been the one to release it
it's coming back to tease me
But I was just born and you're pride was too strong
Can you change it? And are you willing to face it?

Yeah

You can tell your story and coat it any way
but you will never change who you trying to play now 
your friends are falling out
they know you just don't care
they know you never did

Cause you were right then I should have been the one to release it
it's coming back to tease me
But I was just born and you're pride was too strong
Can you change it? And are you willing to face it?

Cause they say always the first one 
is never as good as the next
hey, it's just rock and roll
even though you might think you lost it all.
Cause the times they are a changing
and who can predict what's next
hey, you lost control
even though you might have thought you had it all
and hey (hey, hey) it's just rock and roll
and I'll never change
I love it just the same
I'll never change
because I love it just the same
