Tearing pictures of the wall, you took the fall from truth so everyone could see that you don't live your life for me. You live for you and there's nothing I can do, but try to climb out the trenches I've dug cause I can't see underground. I'm not saying that I understand what it's like to be living in spite, but five years from now it'll all seem so trite. I'm sleeping today so I can wake in your arms tonight.
