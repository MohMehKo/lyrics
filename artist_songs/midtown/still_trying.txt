Everyone's just looking for
a reason to go on
But every time I turn around
I feel that you are gone

And I know from my mistake before
I should have seen the truth
Do it one more time
And it'll be my fault for trusting you
Could I ever trust the words you say?

Still trying to say
That I can't forget what you did-no way
You're wasting my time, trying my patience
Still I can't forget what you did-no way

Everyone's just looking for
A person whom to trust
But every time I turn around
I feel that you are lost

Ignored what felt so wrong
To just play the fool once again
Gave up on feelings strong
And buried them
It seems so pointless
