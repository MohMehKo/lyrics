Easy way out You said so yourself, I always took the easy way out, but you can't see me coming down when you're jumping ship. I thought we wanted more, I guess I was wrong. You can't take the easy way out, it's not that easy now. You can't take that easy way, and you'll think I'll stay, but like the years, I'm drifting away. You said so yourself, this time, I won't take the easy way out. The truth is what I'm all about. But I should have known, you're the same way you were before.
