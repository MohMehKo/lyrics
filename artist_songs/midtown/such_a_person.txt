This isn't about you or the life
She's lead through you
Just every passing day leaves me wondering
What is really true
Expecting to find you sleeping
Soundly through and through
Sadness comes misplaced
And ends are means
By which to uncover truth
Happiness will come
When you are with the one
Who can take you to places you never were
But always knew i'm coming for the ride
And you say it's too safe inside
You cannot realize
It's taking time
I'm taking it in stride
I'm sure it's safer inside
You just can't realize
But you're such a person
Wake up every morning
Every morning with her name in your head
You can survive
But you say i'm not half
What i wish-
I was so much back
Then there is no end
And no room for pretend
Feeling only this
I cannot fathom it
There's no escape from uncertain fate
There is no excuse
Why did this happen to you
Can our lives be made up from what's been left in time
You're feeling
Time crushing at the spine
And you're tired
And i'm tired
We're so tired
Yeah
You're tired inside
You just can't realize what's wrong
Or what it's like to be
Something on you've come a long way
And i know everything feels gone
Will you see this through
Or will you say it's through
Everything seems so gone to you
