Remember just two years ago
When our bands were playing house shows
Were fighting for
To make a change
To live our lives the way we dreamed
Despite what they might say

Remember how we struggled though
Remember nights we spent on hard wood floors
Were fighting for
To make a change
To live our lives the way we dreamed
Despite what they might say

You're there when I fall
You'd help me be strong
Even when I lost my faith
We're standing so tall
We made it through it all
We will keep it going strong
Cause I feel it in the songs

To all my friends from around the way
Much respect
We owe you dues
We've got your back
You've got our's too
We'll be there
Should you fall
And I just wanted you to know
You can always count on me

You're there when I fall
You'd help me be strong
Even when I lost my faith
We're standing so tall
We made it through it all
We will keep it going strong
Cause I feel it in the songs

You're there when I fall
You'd help me be strong
You're there when I fall
When we made it through it all

You're there when I fall
You'd help me be strong
Even when I lost my faith
We're standing so tall
We made it through it all
We will keep it going strong
Cause I feel it in the songs

In the songs
