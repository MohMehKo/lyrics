Step outside and listen.
As you cut through the tension
The world is crumbling down around you
It's found you

But when you woke up yesterday
There was nothing left for me to say to you
Because you wanted me to be true

When all you feel is pain
And somehow things have changed
I'll be coming
Coming home to you

When I forgot to call
And you knew it all
It was coming down on you

Will you still, be waiting?
That's something I can't ask you to be
Will you be, still waiting?
Yeah, waiting for me
I'm waiting for

When all you feel is pain
And somehow things have changed
I'll be coming
I'm coming home to you

And you when you live it all
And you finally fall
I'll be coming down with you

Will you still, be waiting?
That's something I can't ask you to be
Will you be, still waiting?
Yeah, waiting for me
I'm waiting for
I'm waiting for you and something is wrong
And I just can't put my finger on it.

You never listened
And you'll never listen now
You know what I'm about
But is that sufficient?
You never listened
And you'll never listen now
Do you hear the words I say?
It hurts when you talk that way

You say you'll listen cause you'd like
To live together lives
But come on
You could have any other boy
To take my place and hold when you're
Feeling all alone

How can you say
That I'm supposed to stay 
When you talk on to me that way?
Oh come on.
Now I can't see what I'm supposed to be
But if you trust me it might turn out ok

What you gonna say, what you gonna say? (Step outside and listen)
What you gonna say, what you gonna say? (Have you cut through the tension)
What you gonna say, what you gonna say? (The world is crumbling down around you)
What you gonna say, what you gonna say? (It's found you)
What you gonna?

What you gonna say, what you gonna say? (Step outside and listen)
What you gonna say, what you gonna say? (Have you cut through the tension)
What you gonna say, what you gonna say? (The world is crumbling down around you)
What you gonna say, what you gonna say? (It's found you) 
Soon I'm coming

What you gonna say, what you gonna say? (Soon you wont be missing)
What you gonna say, what you gonna say? (The days you never listened)
What you gonna say, what you gonna say? (I know I never lied)
What you gonna say, what you gonna say? (So I wont leave out the pain)
Because you wanted me to be true
