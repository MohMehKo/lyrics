She's rising
And I'm sinking
I'm losing sleep
She's resting
Sound in bed with such variety
I'm driving
And she's finding
That she'll survive
When I'm long gone
Do I stay in your mind at least?
There's so much time
And nowhere left to go
She's overcompensating
For what she can never let go of
There's so much time
And nowhere left to go
Am I just an escape
For time to pass through
She's lying
And I'm thinking
She's trying to forget it all
A memory of the past I'll be
I'm buying
That she's trying
The threat is clear
And growing strong
I dream to have such clarity
It's all I'm thinking about
I guess I'll figure it out
I'll think
I'll drink to each new lesson
Ignore the passing of days
Eventually I'll fade
And in the end
It's just a lesson
