Drain
Tarnished blood form bones
Let those poisons
Dry up
Tonight we'll cleanse our souls
Cause judgment day comes
One day sooner this year
One day sooner safe
We were never pure again

Keep them safe from what you'll discover
Keep them safe from harm
Keep them safe inside your home
If it kills you
