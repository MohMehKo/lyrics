I know you'll never lose
What's lost inside you
You're burning down the bridges you've crossed
And you're still around
So nothing's certain
Just let go
We deserve it
If i could chose
To start it over
I'd exercise more discretion
The lies are abound
So nothing's certain
Do you have good intentions?

Come on
Let go
Of those affectations
You don't fool anyone
Come on
Let go
If you want to take on
In years we'll say what happened to you

What gains have you earned
What friends have you trampled over
When you're around
Nothing's certain
Just let go
We deserve it

Come on
Let go
Of those affectations
You don't fool anyone
come on
Let go
If you want to take on
In years we'll say what happened to you

[Instrumental]

And you're still around
So nothing's certain
Just let go
We deserve it

You'll never lose
What's lost inside you
You're burning down the bridges you've crossed
And you're still around
So nothing's certain
Just let go
We deserve it

Come on
Let go
Of those affectations
Come on
Let go
Of those affectations
Come on
Let go
Of those affectations
Come on and let go
Come on and let go

Come on
Let go
Of those affectations
You don't fool anyone
Come on
Let go
Of those affectations
You don't fool anyone

Come on and let go
Come on and let go
Come on and let go
Come on and let go
Come on and let go
Come on and let go
Come on and let go
Come on and let go

Come on
Let go
Of those affectations
Come on
Let go
Of those affectations
Come on
Let go
Of those affectations

You don't fool anyone...
