Its the way of the world (oh..)

Who He is, Who I'am, how we move
It's a wild ride, a frenzy
I could catch my breath to stop and see
What, I feel inside - is this happy?
Whats going on all around me?
I just can't work it out, exactly
It all comes down so abstractly

[chorus]
It's the way of the world of you and me
It's every wish I ever made or ever thought I might
It's the way of the world of you and me
And all I know is I love the way I feel
It's the way of the world Oh....

What does it mean? Scattered, crazy, suddenly
I'm lost in you, I've got to be
Spinning and flashing and dashing
With every turn I'm taking
It's heaven in the making
The moments race right past me
Sometimes i just burst out laughing

[chorus]
It's the way of the world of you and me
It's every wish I ever made or ever thought I might
It's the way of the world of you and me
And all I know is I love the way I feel
It's the way of the world Oh....

I'm thinking to myself
Where did I go?
All I know is that 
I'm somewhere else
Lost in a mystery
In another world
There's nowhere else I'd rather be

It's the way of the world
It's wish I ever made or ever thought i might
It's the way of the world Oh...
And all I know is I love the way i feel
The way I feel........Oh.....
Its' the way of the world of you and me 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 

[chorus]
It's the way of the world of you and me
It's every wish I ever made or ever thought I might
It's the way of the world of you and me
And all I know is I love the way I feel
It's the way of the world Oh...

It's the way of the world of you and me
