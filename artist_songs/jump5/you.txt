I live, I learn 
Sometimes lessons aren't so fun 
I win, I lose 
Sometimes I try to miss the mark 

I may not know it all 
But the one thing that I found 
Is that Your love will be around 

[Chorus:]
And I hear You 
And I feel You 
Don't always have to see You 
Cause You've promised me 
You'll never let me down 
And I need You 
And I want You 
I love the way You want me to 
And Your love it seems to 
Lift me off the ground 

I don't know how 
But I don't have to explain 
I trust Your love 
I guess that's why they call it faith 

Just when I need You most 
Or when I'm at the end of hope 
Or at the end of my rope 

[Chorus]

So even when I don't recognize that You're right beside me 
You're with me I know 
I'm living and I'm learning and the lessons aren't so bad 
When You keep me, oh no 
I'll take the way of with the losing cause I know You love me 
You hold me always 
And You will never let me go 

[Chorus]
You hold me always 

[Chorus]
I live, I learn
