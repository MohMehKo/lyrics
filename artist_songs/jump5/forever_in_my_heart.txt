You are the hero, ill never be
But don't You know, I wanna be like You
And I'm so glad You're a part of me
Ill go with You wherever You want to

You came to save me from myself
You took the blame (shame)
You love me like nobody else
So I say..

[chorus]
Now and forever
I'm with You
Wherever You lead me, ill go too
We'll be together
I know its true
Now I know that You are
You are forever in my heart

And when I think about all You've done
You know its hard for me to believe it
And when I see all the love You give
I can't deny it, I gladly receive it

[chorus]
Who can do everything that You've done

Who can love in the way that You love
You are forever in my heart
