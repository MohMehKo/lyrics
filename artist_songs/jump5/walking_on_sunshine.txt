I used to think maybe you loved me
Now baby I'm sure and I just can't wait
Till the day when you knock on my door
Now everytime I go for the mailbox
Gotta hold myself down 'cause I just can't wait
Till you write me you're coming around.

[CHORUS:]
I'm walkin' on sunshine whoa! [3x]
And don't it feel good? Hey!
Oh right now!
And don't it feel good?

I'm walkin' on sunshine!

I used to think maybe you loved me
Now I know that it's true
But I just can't spend my whole life
Just awaiting for you
I don't want you back for the weekend
Not back for a day
'Cause baby I just want you back
And I want you to stay

[CHORUS]

Whoo!
And don't it feel good?
[echo] and don't it feel good?
I'm walkin' on sunshine!
[echo] I'm walkin' on sunshine!
I'm walkin' on sunshine!

[CHORUS]

And don't it feel good? [x2]

I'm walkin' on sunshine! [x8]
