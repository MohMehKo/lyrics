I couldn't sleep tonight 
'Cause you were on my mind 
We've been friends so long 
I treated you wrong, that's not right 
I said some crazy things 
Words I did not mean 
Can I take back the lies 
Can I apologize

[Chorus]
I love ya too much 
I love ya just the way you are 
And I love ya too much 
To ever let you down 
And I love ya too much 
You know I wanna wrap my heart around you 
Love ya too much 
To ever let you go 
I want you to know 
I've had good friends before 
But none have loved me more 
I can't remember who was ever as true as you are 
I get emotional 
'Cause I'm an ocean full 
Of dreams that we can share and hope to get us there 

[Chorus]

On and on and on 

Together we go on 
So far now from where we belong 
We won't slow down, won't stop now 
Givin' up won't do 
Take a chance on me 
I'll take my chances on you

[Chorus]
