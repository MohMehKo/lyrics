When you wish upon a star
Your dreams will take you very far
But, when you wish upon a dream
Life ain't always what it seems, oh yeah
What'd you see in night so clear
In the sky so very dear

You're a shining star
No matter who you are
Shining bright to see
What you could truly be

Shining star come in to view
Shine its watchful light on you
Gives you strength to carry on
Makes your body big and strong oh yeah

So, if you find yourself in need
Why don't you listen to these words of heed
Be a child that's free of sin
Words of wisdom
Yes I can

You're a shining star
No matter who you are
Shining bright to see
What you could truly be

Shining star for you to see
What your life could truly be
Shining star for you to see
What your life could truly be
