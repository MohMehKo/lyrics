(Na na na na na na na na)

[Verse 1:]
When I'm with you I feel a rush
'Cause I've never liked anyone so much
Everybody says that it's just a crush
But I think it's something more
Sunny skys or cloudy days
You always seem to make them great
Letting you know might be a mistake
But that's what being young is for

[Pre-chorus 1:]
It's not because I'm bored or lonely
I just wanna be you're one and only

[Chorus:]
Na na na na na na na na
Feels like falling
Na na na na na na na na
Feels like falling

[Verse 2:]
Who knows? This could be the one
It's way to good to be out-down
Now I don't really wanna jump the gun
But I can't help fallin' in

[Pre-chorus 2:]
It's not because I'm bored or lonely
I just wanna be you're one and only

[Chorus:]
Na na na na na na na na
Feels like falling
Na na na na na na na na
Feels like falling
Na na na na na na na na
Feels like falling
Na na na na na na na na
Feels like falling

[Bridge:]
Straight into the everafter
Of a story's ending chapter
Or this could be a huge disaster
If I start falling any faster

Na na na na na na na na
One, two, three, four!

[Chorus:]
Na na na na na na na na
Feels like falling
Na na na na na na na na
Feels like falling
Na na na na na na na na
Feels like falling
