You're my beautiful reality 
And everything about you speaks to me
You're a fragrance in my mind
Caught up in my thoughts time after time

You cay, come closer, look at the possibility
When I get closer you pull me in like gravity

[Chorus]
Every body looking for the way to everlasting love
Hoping to find a little piece of mine from anyone
But when they see what you mean to me,
Then they will know
That perfect love you've given
(Lord) You're wonderful, You're wonderful (yeah, yeah)

My thoughts inside and feelings, too
Will struggle till' my heart and mind are one with you, yeah
The answer is so plain to see
And now I know the way this love is supposed to be, yeah

[chorus once]
As I get closer a light is shining down on me 
When I get closer, can this be my destiny?

[chorus once]
I'll never have the words enough to tell you how I feel
Like when you kept my world from falling down
If there's any good in me, it must be plain to see
'Cause it's your fingerprints inside the very heart of me

[chorus once]
'Cause it's your fingerprints inside the very heart of me

[chorus once]

You are patient, you are kind
You are not easily angered
You keep no record of wrongs
You always protect and always trust
You never fail (Everybody's looking for that everlasting love)

[chorus twice]
