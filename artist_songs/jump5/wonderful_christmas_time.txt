The mood is right, the spirit's up
We're here tonight and that's enough
Simply having a wonderful christmastime
Simply having a wonderful christmastime

The party's on, the feeling's here
That only comes this time of year
Simply having a wonderful christmastime
Simply having a wonderful christmastime

The choir of children sing their song
They practiced all year long
Ding-dong, ding-dong, ding-dong, ding
Ooh...

Simply having a wonderful christmastime
Simply having a wonderful christmastime

The word is out, about the town
Oh don't look down
Simply having a wonderful christmastime

The choir of children sing their song
They practiced all year long
Ding-dong, ding-dong, ding-dong, ding
Ooh...

The party's on, the feeling's here
That only comes this time of year
Simply having a wonderful christmastime
We're simply having a wonderful christmastime
Simply having a wonderful christmastime

Simply having a wonderful christmastime
A wonderful christmastime
