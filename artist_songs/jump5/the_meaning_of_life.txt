I tried to find the meaning of life 
Somebody told me I was looking for you 
And now I know whatever I find 
There is nobody who can do what You do 
In so many ways, in so many days 
When I was looking for the way to Your heart 
But I wouldn't see 
The way I could be 
Somebody loving You for who You are, oh yeah 

[Chorus]

So why does the rain fall down 
Who causes the sun to rise each morning 
Why did it take so long 
To give you my heart 
When You gave me the meaning of life

And deep inside with all that I have 
I'm gonna love You more than ever before 
I didn't know the life that I had 
Would only show me how I needed You more 
In so many ways, in so many days 
When I was looking for the way to Your heart 
But I wouldn't see 
The way I could be 
Somebody loving You for who You are, oh yeah 

[Chorus]

You understand me 
You know that I need You 
Your love I'm feeling inside 
And I won't deny the feeling when I 
Begin to understand the way You feel 
For me

[Chorus]
