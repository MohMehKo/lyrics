It's like I've got nothing to do but think about you (all I can do, all I can do)

Everyday is a new day
And I don't have to pretend
All my friends think I'm crazy
But I don't want this to end

When I have the chance I wanna say to u
Wishing I could take back what I put u thru
I'll never do it again
We're like oil and water still we somehow mix
And what used to be broken is somehow fixed
It's hard to explain

I know some people say
That opposites attract
If that's the truth then we
We will be together forever

[chorus]
It's like I got nothing to do but think about u
I've got all the time in the world 
If you look in my heart
U'll know from the start
That's its all I can do
Not to think about u

I gave you good reason
To walk out that door
Let me tell you I've learned a thing or two

And I'm so amazed at the things u do
Now dont let me go oh no

I know some people say
That opposites attract
If that's the truth then we,
We're meant to be together forever

[chorus]

I know some people say
That opposites attract
If that's the truth then we,
We belong together forever 

[chorus]
