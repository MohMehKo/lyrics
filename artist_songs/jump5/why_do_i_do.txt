Why do I do the things I do
Sometimes I feel like I am so insecure
If I could learn a thing or two from you
Then popular opinion I could ignore

You are enough for me
I don't need anything but you (ya)
You are enough for me
And I don't need anything

[Chorus:]
Cause you have given me more that I can ask for
More that I can ever imagine
And you keep giving me love you keep on lifting me up
It doesn't get any better

Why do I do the things I do
Thought everyday is showing me something new
I need to slow down need to learn from you
Cause your the only one I should listen to

You are enough for me
I don't need anything but you (ya)
You are enough for me
And I don't need anything

[Chorus:]
Cause you have given me more that I can ask for
More that I can ever imagine
And you keep giving me love you keep on lifting me up
It doesn't get any better

Lord you show me how
To do it life as it comes around
Even when I'm down
I can count on you to help me stand my ground

Cause you have given me more that I could ask for 
More than I could ever imagine
And you keep giving me love you keep on lifting me up
It doesn't get any better

Cause you have given me more that I could ask for 
More than I could ever imagine
And you keep giving me love you keep on lifting me up
It doesn't get any better

You keep giving me love
You keep lifting me up
You keep giving me love 
You keep lifting me up
You keep giving me love 
You keep lifting me up
You keep giving me love 
You keep lifting me up [fades]
