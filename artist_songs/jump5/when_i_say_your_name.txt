The way You love me 

It's been changing me 
And now I know You are all I need 
You're everything that's right 
Here in my life 

[Chorus]

When I say Your name 

You know my heart feels lighter 
No matter what I'm going through 
When I say Your name 
You know the world gets brighter 
That's what Your love can do 
With all I have 

My heart, my soul, my mind 
I'll love You back until the end of time 
Now and forevermore 

I will be Yours 

[Chorus]

Oh, You opened up my heart 

And I walked right in 
Yeah 

[Chorus]
