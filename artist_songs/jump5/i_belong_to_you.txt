Maybe the time has come for me to believe 
The safest place for me to be is in Your arms 
When I draw near to You 
You meet me where I am 
You are my all and I realize 

[Chorus]
I am in love 
I belong to You 
You have chosen me 
I give my heart 
I give everything 
I belong to You 
Because I believe 
I have been set free so naturally 
And I belong to You 
Now I can feel You here with me, I believe 
Who else could change my heart 
My life belongs to You 
I stand before You now 
I surrender everything 
You are my all and I realize 

[Chorus]
What is patient? 
What is kind? 
What is willing to forgive and leave behind 
You are my all and I realize 
You are my all and I realize 

[Chorus]
