Sunlight on my windowpane
Something new running through my veins
Every day is like a new beginning
It's something about the way I'm feeling
When you say you love me

Your words are ringing over and over
Changing everything I thought I knew
I know a love that's true
And it's all because of you
(all because of you)

I'm always wallowing in my mistakes
It doesn't always seem to go my way
You come to me and everything's OK
It's something about the way I'm feeling
When you say you love me

I fall more in love with you
Everytime you say you love me
Your words are ringing 
I know, it's all changing
All because of you, of you.

[chorus 1x]
