[Lesley]
So many times I wondered what is enough?
It always happened with you
We're always up and down 
We've been through so much
I come out wanting you
I've always been the one who had to let go
When I can't take anymore
But when it comes to you 
I'll never say no
For all I've waited for
And now I know for sure

[Brittany]
Never Enough

[All]
Never enough

[Brittany]
This kind of love

[All]
This kind of love
I always wanted more and more 
No matter how much

[Chris]
No matter how much

[Brittany]
Thinkin' of you when it comes to this kind of love
It's never enough

All
Always be looking for somebody like you
Someone to open my eyes

All
Now that I found you the searching is though

[Lesley]
And still not satisfied
When I look into your eyes

[Brittany]
Never Enough

[All]
Never enough

[Brittany]
This kind of love

[All]
This kind of love
I always wanted more and more 
No matter how much

[Chris]
No matter how much

Brittany
Thinkin' of you 
When it comes to this kind of love

[All]
It's never a minute
A moment
I swear that I won't let 
Time just slip away
Even if we're together 
Every second till forever
It will never be enough

[Brittany]
This kind of love
Never Enough!

[Brittany]
Never Enough

[All]
Never enough

[Brittany]
This kind of love

[All]
This kind of love
I always wanted more and more 
no matter how much

[Chris]
No matter how much

[Brittany]
Thinkin' of you when it comes to this kind of love
It's never enough

[All]
Never enough

[Brittany]
This kind of love

[All]
This kind of love
I always wanted more and more 
No matter how much

[Chris]
No matter how much

[Brittany]
Thinkin' of you when it comes to this kind of love
It's never enough

[Lesley]
So many times I wondered what is enough
It always happens with you
