Dont try to make me make mistakes
I won't forget
I don't need you to tell me 
What i need to do
Just give it time, you'll see that I, I have a mind
And it's made up
And it's made up 

I wanna be friends with you 
Gonna do what i have to do
Cause its right, ya its right, thats all right

[chorus]
Don't pressure me
Dont push me too far
I wanna do right with all my heart
Don't pressure me
What about your self-respect?
Im not like that
Im not like that

Dont have to prove
Nothing to you 
There's no excuse
I've got a faith you 
Need to take a second look
My friend, you need to understand
I have a mind
And I'ts made up
And I'ts made up 

I wanna be friends with you 
Gonna do what i have to do
Cause its right, ya its right, thats all right

[chorus x2]
Don't pressure me
Dont push me too far
I wanna do right with all my heart
Don't pressure me
What about your self-respect?
Im not like that
Im not like that 

Don't have any doubt
What my life's about
I'm gonna show you
This is not my way
You can't take that away
Don't even try to

[chorus x2]
Don't pressure me
Dont push me too far
I wanna do right with all my heart
Don't pressure me
What about your self-respect?
Im not like that
Im not like that

Don't pressure me!
