[Lesley]
Seems like your fading
Wanna go in alone
Hear me out, 
One more song
Roll down the window 
You can say your piece
Every single word, 
Out on the breeze

[Lesley, Brittany]
Hold on, don't be in a hurry
Things can move so slowly
When you want to fly

[Brittany]
Call it up, keep it real
Let me show you how it feels
Live your life, 
Everyday is something new
See the light, find yourself
Get your feet up off the ground
Take the hand that you're given
And shoot the moon

[Lesley]
Don't get me wrong now
There's a battle ahead
Wounded hearts, 
Always mend

[Lesley, Brittany]
I know I can hear you crying
Things just move so slowly
When you want to fly

[All]
Call it up, keep it real
Let me show you how it feels
Live your life, 
Everyday is something new
See the light, find yourself
Get your feet up off the ground
Take the hand that you're given
And shoot the moon

[Lesley, Brittany]
Whoa whoa whoa 
Whoa whoa, yeah
Whoa whoa whoa, 
Yeah yeah

[Brittany, Lesley]
More than a million miles
More than the open sky
Big dreams can take you higher
Don't you stop trying 

[Brittany]
Call it up, keep it real
Let me show you how it feels
Live your life, 
Everyday is something new

[All]
See the light, find yourself
Get your feet up off the ground
Take the hand that you're given
And shoot the moon

Call it up, keep it real
Let me show you how it feels
Live your life, 
Everyday is something new

[Lesley]
Is somthing something new

[All]
See the light, find yourself
Get your feet up off the ground
Take the hand that you're given
And shoot the moon

[Lesley, Brittany]
Whoa whoa whoa, yeah
