It's nothing complicated
Bout' the way we live
We are here for each other
Happy to give
All we have we share
And all of us we care

[CHORUS]
So come on
Welcome to our family time
Welcome to our brotherly time
This is a festival
You know the best of all
We're here to share it all

If there's a bond between us
Nobody can explain
It's a celebration of life
We see friend again
I'll be there for you, i know you'd be there for me too

Welcome to our family time
Welcome to our brotherly time
This is a festival
You know the best of all
We're here to share it all

Remembering love was departed
Someone did to your heart
Finding love, planning a future
Telling stories and laughing with friends
Precious moments you'll never forget

This has to be
The most beatiful, the most peaceful place
I've ever been to 
Is nothing like i've ever seen

[CHORUS 2X]

We're here to share it alllllll
