Do ya like the freckles on my face?
Do ya like my teeth they're out of place?
I'd like to think so
Do ya like the funny way I speak?
I don't clean my room for weeks..sad weeks
I'd like to think so

[Chorus]
Do ya, do ya, do ya love me?
Do ya...d-d-do ya love me?
I...I'd like to think so
Do ya, do ya, do ya love me?
Do ya...d-d-do ya love me?
Anyway...I'd like to think so

Do ya like the way I go all shy?
I just can't look you in the eye?
I'd like to think so
Will you stay here for a while?
So I can watch you when you smile
I'd like to think so

[Chorus]

Well I hope I don't drive you insane
With my big right foot and my unkept mane
Well I know you love me the way I am
So I'll change my ways if I think that I can

[Chorus 2x]
