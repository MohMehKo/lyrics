[Brittany]
You still got me
Got me
Got me

[Brandon]
From here looking back
I still can't believe
Where we've been 
What we've did 
What we saw 
You and me
And now that we've come
To the end of our road
Can't believe 'round this bend
Our ride has to end 
But you don't have to worry
Cause you know
What ever you see

[All]
You still got me
Through the good bad or many
You got me forever
You still got me
And where ever you go
Just know you'll never be there alone

[Brandon]
So for me 
When it hurts
And life leaves its mark
It helps me to know 
That you're never that far
Just a call to a friend
And you're here to the end
Cause the memories wont fade
So you're with me always
So just know
Life can bring what it wants
You always got me

[All]
You still got me
Through the good bad or many
You got me forever
You still got me
And where ever you go

[Brittany]
Ooh oooh 
We could be near or far
Not passed the lonely star
So don't matter
No it don't
Across any sea
You're still with memories

[All]
You still got me
Through the good bad or many
You got me forever
You still got me
And where ever you go
Just know you'll never be there alone

You still got me
Through the good bad or many
You got me forever
You still got me
And where ever you go
Just know you'll never be there alone

[Brittany]
Oh oh oh 

[All]
And where ever you go 
Just know you'll never be there alone

[Brittany]
You still got me
Got me
Got me
