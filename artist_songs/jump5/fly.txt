[Lesley, Brittany]
Fly-y, fly-y, 
Fly-y, fly-y, fly

[Chris]
It's like I woke up and my day belongs
And nothing goes right hall of fame
It's like a simple song and 
I can't seem to get it straight

[Lesley]
But I'm in the world premier
And I just can't get through the lines
And everything I touch goes wrong, 
No matter what I try

[All]
Fly away above the clouds up in the sky 
Oh why, oh why
So I don't worry 'bout the little things in life
'Cause it's my time to fly
And I know they cannot hold me down 
Fly-y, fly-y, 
'Cause they cannot hold me down, 
Fly-y, fly-y, fly-y

[Brandon]
Some times are crazy in the world 
It's ever weirder than it sounds
The world is my missed time
Things are easier I've found

[Lesley]
All the world's stage
I've just got the starring role
The mountain mass in front of me 
Seems like a little stone

[All]
Fly away above the clouds up in the sky 
Oh why, oh why
So I don't worry 'bout the little things in life
Cause it's my time to fly tonight

[Lesley]
I know sometimes it's hard to walk
When being knocked around

[Brittany]
But circumstances, state of mind
Don't live life on the ground

[All]
I just want to
Fly away above the clouds up in the sky 
Oh why, oh why
So I don't worry 'bout the little things in life
Cause it's my time to fly tonight 

[Chris]
It's my time, my time to fly

[All]
Fly away above the clouds up in the sky 
Oh why, oh why
So I don't worry 'bout the little things in life
Cause it's my time to fly tonight and 
I know they cannot hold me down
Fly-y, fly-y, 
'Cause they cannot hold me down, 
Fly-y, fly-y, fly-y
