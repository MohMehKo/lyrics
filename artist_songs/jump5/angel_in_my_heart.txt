I heard a whisper that touched deep inside my soul
Like some familiar melody
A hidden chapter from a story left untold
I gotta feeling, I could believe in

[chorus]

There is an angel in my heart
Feels like I'm guided by a candle in the dark
Its taken all this time
To finally find out what I could never see
An angel in my heart
You were there 4 me
Now there is no doubt that there will always be
An angel in my heart

You were the friend, You were the one I could confide in
You gave me strength that I could never find
Deep emotions that's I've always been denying
I believe in, its so close now, its You that
I'm feeling

[chorus]

Finally found what I been searching for
(all my life)
It was right before my eyes
Oh u are my angel
I know You'll always be there
You are my one and only angel
To finally found find what I could never see
(You were there for me)
Now there is no doubt that there will always be
An angel in my heart
