Aloha ē, aloha ē
ʻAnoʻai ke aloha ē
Aloha ē, aloha ē
ʻAnoʻai ke aloha ē

There’s no place I’d rather be
Than on my surfboard out at sea
Lingering in the ocean blue
And if I had one wish come true
I’d surf 'til the sun sets beyond the horizon

ʻĀwikiwiki mai lohilohi
Lawe mai i ko papa heʻe nalu
Flyin' by on the Hawaiian roller coaster ride

ʻĀwikiwiki mai lohilohi
Lawe mai i ko papa heʻe nalu
Piʻi nā nalu lā lahalaha
ʻO ka moana hānupanupa
Lalala i ka lā hanahana
Me ke kai hoene i ka puʻe one
Hele, hele mai kākou ē

Flyin' by on the Hawaiian roller coaster ride

Hang loose, hang ten, howzit, shake a shaka
No worry, no fear, ain't no biggie braddah
Cuttin' in, cuttin' up, cuttin' back, cuttin' out
Frontside, backside, goofy footed, wipe out

Let's get jumpin', surf's up and pumpin'
Coastin' with the motion of the ocean
Whirlpools swirling, cascading, twirling
Hawaiian roller coaster ride
