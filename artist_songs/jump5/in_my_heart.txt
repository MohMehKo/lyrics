Oh ya, oh ya

[Verse 1:]
Pick up my dreams
That need a jump start
Give it all that I can
I crash and for what
You stick up for me when I fall hard
Take down all my fear
You're driving my thoughts around in my head
So I won't break down around each bend
With my foot on the pedal I'll race ahead
Drive this life with me

[Pre-chorus 1:]
I am I am aware
I can when You are here

[Chorus:]
You are
You are in my heart
You are
You are in my heart
When every little thing is falling apart
You're beating in my heart
You're beating in my heart

[Verse 2:]
When the clock strikes night and I'm in the dark
Lonely here and there You are
When the lines get cut and I feel far
Reaching out to me
When I feel like a freak
The words you say tell me to believe that I'm OK
When I don't make sense 'cause I'm this way
You see the best in me

[Pre-chorus 2:]
I am I am aware
I can when You are here

[Chorus:]
You are
You are in my heart
You are
You are in my heart
When every little thing is falling apart
You're beating in my heart
You are
You are in my heart
You are
You are in my heart
When every little thing is falling apart
You're beating in my heart
You're beating in my heart

[Bridge:]
There's a lot that I can be
There's a buzz around You and me
You're the sum of all I need
I count the number of things You do for me

You are (oh ya)

[Chorus:]
You are
You are in my heart
You are
You are in my heart
When every little thing is falling apart
You're beating in my heart
You are
You are in my heart
You are
You are in my heart
When every little thing is falling apart
You're beating in my heart
You're beating in my heart
You're beating in my heart

You are...
