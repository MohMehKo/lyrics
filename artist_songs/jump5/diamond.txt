Everytime I turn the TV on
See another pretty face on the screen
Feels like I'm not good enough
To be on the cover of a magazine
Turn around, I look in the mirror

And I wonder if ill ever measure up
All I want is someone to make it clearer
Am I ever gonna find the perfect love?

Then You break through the madness
And You tell me how it is..

[chorus]
You're a diamond that shines
One of a kind
A shimmering radiant star
You're a flower in the rain
Wonderfully made
To shine like the sun
You're a diamond

Friends try and tell me just to loosen up a little
You're gonna scare the good ones away
Get a look with a hook, its fundamental
Come on girl, u gotta get into the game
Something deep inside of me says

Are u sure that u really want to play?
Gotta trust ur heart and not ur head
Instead of buying into the masquerade
I'm not some decoration
So would u tell me how it is..

[chorus]

Doesn't matter if they tell u how to live

Doesn't matter if they try and mold u
Doesn't matter if they say what beautiful is
You're a diamond cause He already showed u

[chorus]
