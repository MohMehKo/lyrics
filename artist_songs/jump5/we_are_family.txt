Ladies and Gentlemen

Yea yea yea yea yea yea yea yea yea yea yea 

[Verse 1]
Everyone can see us together, as we walk on by. And we fly like birds of a feather
I won't tell no lie All the people around us they say, can they be that close
Just let me state for the record Were giving love like a family does

[chorus]
We are family, (we are family)
I got all my sisters with me
We are family 
Get up everybody sing
We are family (we are family)
I got all my sisters with me (i got all my sisters with me)
We are family (we are family) 
Get up everyboby sing 

[verse 2]
Living life is fun and we've just begun to get our share of this worlds delights
High hopes we have for teh future abd our goal's in sight no we don't
Get depressed Here's what we call te golden rule have faith in you and the things
You do and you won't go wrong oh no this is a family joint (yea yea).

WE are family (we are family)

We are family (we are family)
Get up everybody sing (it to me sing it now
