Who rocks the house 
We say that Jump5 rocks the house 
And when Jump5 rocks the house 
They rock it all the way down 
How do I describe the feeling 
How do I begin to show 
How Your love is always changin' 
Everything within my soul 
You have opened up my heart 
You have opened up my heart 
Now Your love is rushing in 

[Chorus]

All I want is You 
You're all I ever need 
All I want to do 
Is be with You forever 
Mercy flowing like a river 
Love is falling like the rain 
Pouring out Your grace upon me 
I will never be the same 
You have opened up my heart 
You have opened up my heart 
Now Your love is rushing in

[Chorus]
