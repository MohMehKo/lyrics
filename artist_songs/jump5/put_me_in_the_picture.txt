(suddenly my mind is photographic..)
You know that I, I'm the last thing You expected

You've seen my smile, took Your heart by surprise
Its like magic, suddenly Your mind is photographic
You can see me right by Your side 

Right out of nowhere You put me in the picture 
Its looking like we could belong this way 
Right from the moment You put me in the picture 
Everyday has been a, a blue sky kind of beautiful day 

You've got me, yeah, I'm right there in Your pocket 
And I hold You close to my heart 
Yeah, I admit there's been a little shift in the way I view things 
Now I see what Your true colors really are 

[chorus]

Every flash of inspiration 
Everything has changed inside my world 
As I always pictured it could be 
Taking my sweet time 
Keeping my heart mine 
Then You walked away 
And I heard You say 
Smile for the camera 

[chorus]
