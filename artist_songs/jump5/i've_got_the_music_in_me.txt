[Verse 1:]
I've go trouble in my life
No dreams to make me cry
I've never frightened a worry
You know it's always goodbye

[Pre-chorus 1:]
I heat up
I cool down
When something gets in my way I go around it
I don't let life get me down
I'm gonna take it the way that I found it

[Chorus:]
I got the music in me
I got the music in me
I got the music in me
Yeah yeah yeah
I got the music in me
I got the music in me
I got the music in me
I got the music in
I got the music in
I got the music in me
I got the music in
I got the music in
I got the music in me

[Verse 2:]
You say that life is a circle
But that's the way that I found it
You gotta move in a straight line
Keeping my feet firmly on the ground

[Pre-chorus 2:]
I heat up
I cool down
I got words in my head so I sing them
I don't let life get me down
Can't hold onto my blow so I play them

[Chorus:
I got the music in me
I got the music in me
I got the music in me
Ya, ya
I got the music in me
I got the music in me
I got the music in me

Feel funky
Feel good
Gonna fly like a bird
Hold on to your hat and sing sing sing
I got the music, oh oh oh

[Chorus:]
I got the music in me
I got the music in me
I got the music in me
Ya, ya, ya
I got the music in me
I got the music in me
I got the music in me
I got the music (in me)
I got the music in me
I got the music (in me)
I got the music (in me)
I got the music, they pretty music
I got the music in me
I got the music (in me)
I got the music (in me)
I got the music in me
I got the music (in me)
I got the music (in me)
I got the music in me
I got the music (in me)
I got the music (in me)
I got the music in me
I got the music
I got the music in me, ya
