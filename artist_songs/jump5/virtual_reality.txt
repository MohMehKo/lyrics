I may never get it right 
You might find I fall away 
I can't live the perfect life 
Every hour everyday 
I may stumble, You may see 
A side you never knew of me 
I don't want to let
You down 
But I cannot make the guarantee 
That I could love you like
You Love me 'til the end of time 
It drives me crazy thinking why
You want me by
Your side 

[Chorus]

I know that I'm not dreaming 
Is my mind playing tricks on me 
No,
Your love won't let me believe in virtual reality 
It's beyond imagination,
Your love changes everything 
I know in my heart this ain't no virtual reality

I may never understand 
Lord, my mind is so amazed 
I can't really comprehend 
I'm entranced, blown away 
But what I feel inside my heart 
Isn't always what I see 
Funny how your faith can change
Your virtual reality 
Seems too easy to believe
You'd love me as I am
But this reality will keep my heart here in Your
hands

[Chorus]
