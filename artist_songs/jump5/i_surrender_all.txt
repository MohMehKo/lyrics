All to Jesus I surrender 
All to Him I freely give
I will ever love and trust him 
In his presence daily live

I surrender all 
I surrender all 
All to Thee, my blessed Savior
I surrender all

Lord Jesus I surrender
Humbly at his feet I bow
Wordly pleasures all forsaken 
Take me, Jesus, take me now

I surrender all 
I surrender all 
All to Thee, my blessed Savior
I surrender all

All to Jesus I surender
Lord, I give myself to thee  
Fill me with Thy love and power 
Let Thy blessings fall on me

I surrender all 
I surrender all 
All to Thee, my blessed Savior
I surrender all
