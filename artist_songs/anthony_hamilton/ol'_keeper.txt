[Talk Intro:]
I I can't just keep watching you all the time and everything, I mean hey.
If you were mine, maaan... you'd change your ways.
Wouldn't be all that going out staying all night long, not letting a brotha know where you are when you coming home.
Things would change, things would surely change.

[Verse 1:]
You been working on the night shift
And ain't no telling who you with
And Every time that the phone rings
You be steady scrambling
Tryna go and do your thing
There's been talk all over the town
People tellin' how you putting it down
Girl when I need you-you're nowhere, nowhere to be found

[Hook:]
If I was yo keeper
I wouldn't never let em' run off with you
If I was yo keeper
I wouldn't never let him do the things he do
I would be up in yo spot all night
Making sure that you don't leave my sight
Making sure that we be getting it right
Until the night is through

[Verse 2:]
You're in and out of every fast car
Sometimes no telling where you are
I'm not trying to blow up yo thang
But you need and try to change your ways (change your ways)
Stop this silly masquerade
Settle down before it's too late
Before you make me up and blow
And not come around here no more

[Hook x2]

Now baby, Now baby

[Beat Break]

[Ad lib:]
Go on and change ways-yea, yea
If I was your keeper
[Alternate Ending Hook:]
If I was yo keeper
I wouldn't never let you do the things you do
I would be up in yo spot all night
Making sure that you don't leave my sight
Making sure that we be gettin' it right
Until the night is through
Adlib: If I was yo keeper (if I was yo keeper)

[Alternate Hook]

[Outro:]
If I was yo keeper
I'd never let you be alone no no
I would be up in you spot all night
Making sure that you be getting it right
Making sure that you don't leave my sight
Oh no, oh no

[Hook: until song fades out]
