[Verse 1]
You must be safe when you fall in love
People need, the time you and I share together, compromise, try and see eye to eye, cause loves not
blind, it knows when you care
Always kiss ya lady, tell her that you love her, prayin make a baby that was made in love, show her
she's important, bring flowers for her, and build on the truth -2x's

[Chorus]
if you take a little walk with me girl i'll lead you to the truth and if you never give up on
me, girl i'll share it all with you, show directions when I lost my way, I'll be around to stay, to show
you the truth truth 

[Verse 2]
If you trust me, I'll make sure to build you up, through all your dreams, you and I will grow
together, forget your past, the love you had that never last, God knew your heart and I was made for you

Girl I won't mistreat you, always make love to you, go to church together, even get baptised to, we can
read the bible, play mommas father, this marriage is true

[Chorus 2x]

girl i'll show you the truth (girl I'll show you)
I'll show you (it don't matter, cause I love you baby (and I love you back))
you wont have to worry (we can walk in the truth together [4x]) 
i'll compromise (this love is the truth [5x])
I'll see eye to eye
