[Verse 1]
You're 'bout the flyest thang that life could ever bring 
Like fresh air to me the blood I bleed sent to me 
And I want, wanna build with you 

[Chorus]
Since I seen't you, we've been peoples, your're my equal 
This love is see through I want to Keep you 
I want to be with you

[Verse 2] 
Your're like the softest cloud a virgin in my eye 
An angel just my size 
Wish that I could fall in love with you again 
And I wanna build with you 

[Chorus] 
Since I seen't you, we've been peoples, your're my equal 
This love is see through I want to Keep you 
I want to be with you

[Post Chorus] 
Your conversation is liberating, when we're relating it's a vacation. 
Like recreation, I want my way with you 

[Bridge] 
Ever since the day you walked into my life 
I've never been the same then and not again 
I hope and pray to God that you stay awhile 
..........with me and.... 

[Chorus]

[Ad lib out.......]
