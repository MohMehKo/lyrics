Home for the holidays
Thinking I'll stay away oh no
Can't wait to see your smiling face
Baby I'm on my way oh oh

We been together for a while now
And there is nothing more important
than being with you

I'll be home for the holidays
You was thinking I would stay away oh no
Can't wait to see your smiling face
Baby I'm on my way oh oh

We've made the most of not much at all
Survived on our faith and our love
Together families, so beautiful
And I can't wait to get home

I'll be home for the holidays
You was thinking I would stay away oh no
Can't wait to see your smiling face
Baby I'm on my way oh oh

I'll never leave you for long
You are the beat of my heart
Baby hold on we have memories of love

I'll be home for the holidays
You was thinking I would stay away oh no
Can't wait to see your smiling face
Baby I'm on my way oh oh
