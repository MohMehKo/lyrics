[Verse 1]
Now we've been through too much together 
And that's separate us from the rest 
Now we are approaching up on stormy weather 
Let's see what our love is made of 

I hate you were crying last night 
Said I should've been by your side 
Girl, please, don't you leave me 
And, girl, don't you say goodbye 

[Chorus]
Now, we've been through too much together 
And we're approaching stormy weather 
But girl, you're my first love 
And no matter what the people say 
I'm gonna love you anyway 
Girl, you're my first love 

[Verse 2]
Boy, I swear I think you're sacred 
And I'm so thankful that you're live 
If I could take back all of the sorrow 
Then I'd, I'd replace it with a kids 

You're the air that I breathe 
The perfect one for me 
And baby I, I refuse to let you go 
And I refuse to let you leave 

[Chorus]
Now, we've been through too much together 
And we're approaching stormy weather 
But boy, you're my first love 
And no matter what the people 
Say I'm gonna love you anyway 
Boy, you're my first love 

Now, we've been through too much together 
And we're approaching stormy weather 
You're my first love 
No matter what the people say (no matter) 
I'm gonna love you anyway 
You're my first love 
My first love 

[Ad Lib]

I will not let you go away 
I will not let you go away 
I will not let you go away 
I will not let you go away 

You're my first love 
You're my first love 
You're my baby 
You're my baby 

I love you 
My first love
