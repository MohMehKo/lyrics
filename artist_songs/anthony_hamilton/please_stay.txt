Its gotten too late 
And I’ve exceeded the moments 
To make you stay (Hey Baby) 
I must’ve been a fool to run around 
and not once Stop to check on you (Hey Babe) 
Now I lost my mind 
And I’ve given up the time 
That I could’ve shared with you 
And If I had my way 
I would go down on my knees and ask my God to make you stay 

[Chorus:]
I will make you stay baby, 
Ill Make you Stay, 
I will try everything, 
Ill go down on my knees, 
To Make you Stay, 
I will try everything 

Its gotten too late 
I got caught on the wrong side 
And lost my way (Hey Babe) 
I stayed gone too long 
And never once had the time to 
Just pick up the phone and call you girl 

You see 

See now I drunk a few 
I slept around on you 
I pity the fool who would do that to you 
Now I’ve lost your trust 
And I’ve embarrassed us 
I need somebody to pull me out this mess 

[Chorus]

Ill give up everything 
You see I need you baby 

[Chorus:]
I will make you stay baby, 
Ill Make you Stay, 
I will try everything, 
I'll go down on my knees, 
To Make you Stay, 
I will try everything
