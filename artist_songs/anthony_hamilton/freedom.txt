Ooh

Ooh

Felt like the weight of the world was on my shoulders…
Pressure to break or retreat at every turn;
Facing the fear that the truth I discovered;
No telling how all this will work out;
But I've come too far to go back now.

~I am looking for freedom, 
Looking for freedom…
And to find it cost me everything I have.
Well I am looking for freedom,
Looking for freedom...
And to find it may take everything I have!

I know all too well it don’t come easy;
The chains of the world they seem to move in tight;
I try to walk around it, 
But stumbling’s so familiar;
Try to get up but the doubt is so strong;
There’s gotta be a wind in my bones...

I'm looking for freedom,
Looking for freedom;
And to find it, cost me everything I have.
Well I’m looking for freedom, 
I’m looking for freedom...
And to find it may take everything I have!

Oh 
Not giving up has always been hard, 
So hard...
But if I do the things the easy way I won’t get far.
Hmm, life hasn't been very kind to me lately, 
Well,
But I suppose it’s a push for moving on, 
Oh yeah;
In time the sun’s gonna shine on me nicely, 
One day yeah,
Something tells me good things are coming and I ain't gonna not believe.

I'm looking for freedom,
Looking for freedom;
And to find it, cost me everything I have.
Well I’m looking for freedom, 
I’m looking for freedom...
And to find it may take everything I have!
