[Ad libs]

Why don’t we just find a place & time
No doubt in our minds
When nothing is as ever as it seems

[Background:] Oh, oh, oh, oh!
There is no need to be afraid
Through love that we made
When we were living in a world of dreams

[Chorus (Break):]
They said that’s it’s hard for a man to let it all go.
When we getting down on our thang you and I know
Whatever we try
We gonna go somewhere.
You take control baby I don’t care
I gotta keep on to pushing comes to shove
We keep on making
Better Love

Don’t believe a thang
What lovers say
We tried every way
They oughta look at you and me
For whatever heart
you take your time
You teach me and I’ll learn
About the way a man should be

[Chorus (Break):]
Gotta take control of yourself
swallow your pride
Every fella has what you call feelings inside
You got to grab hold of yourself (yourself) before you’re able to love somebody else 
I said baby I know what you’re thinkin’ of (heeey)
We keep on making
Better Love

I believe the love the kind we’re makin’
Gonna last forevermore 
Lovin’ you feels so fine
Girl we’ll be getting’ down this evenin’ like we never did before

[Falsetto ad libs & guitar / bass]

Better Love (we’ll be makin’)
Better Love [x4]

[Chorus (Break):]
They said that’s its hard (so hard) for a man to let it all go (to let a love go)
When we getting down on our thang you and I know
Whatever we try
We gonna go somewhere.
You take control baby I don’t care
I gotta keep on to pushing comes to shove
We keep on making
Better Love

Better Love [til faded out]
