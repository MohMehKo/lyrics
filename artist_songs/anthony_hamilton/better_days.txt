[Verse 1]
There was times I didn't want to bother you 
You were at work all night I didn't want to complain 
And I realize the compromise that love ones make 
I'm holding on for the future some more better days 
With you 

[Chorus]
Be without you 
Oh wouldn't be with out you 
Oh I live for your love 
For you 

[Verse 2]
Say word I'm there when you need me 
My job is to protect you although I know 
That women get emotional in need of love 
So I tried to learn your species and one day we'll grow 
Grow 

[Chorus]
Be without you 
Oh wouldn't be with out you 
Oh I live for your love 
For you 

[Bridge]
I live for ya.... live ya 
I live for ya lovin baby 
Without you..without your love 

[Chorus]
Be without you 
Oh wouldn't be with out you 
Oh I live for your love 
For you 

I wouldn't be without you 
I couldn't live without you 
Never gonna smile without you 
Won' be without you
