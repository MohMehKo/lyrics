Oh love you’re like heaven to my eyes
Each and every time I see you
Young love so powerful
It’s so intoxicating, 
I’m all in, got my tail steady spinning
Don’t know where I’m ending 
I found a heart that I believe in 
I found a heart that I was needing

Oh love, I love the way you pacify me
Keep me forever smiling
Heaven must have sent a better angel
It’s hard to take it all in 
We make love, and I feel that we are one
You are my completion
I found a heart that I believe in 
I found a heart that I was needing
I found a heart that I believed in 
And I’m never letting go – love

I found a heart (– yeah – yeah) that I believe in – yeah
Yeah – yeah – yeah 
I found a love that I was needing –
Yeah – yeah – yeah 
I found a heart that I believed in 
Yeah – yeah – yeah 
And I’m never letting go of my love
Yeah – yeah – yeah 
And I’m never letting go of my love  
Yeah – yeah – yeah 
Never letting go of my love   
Yeah – yeah – yeah 
Hey, yeah – yeah – yeah – yeah 
hey, hey, hey 
Yeah – yeah – yeah – yeah – yeah - yeah
