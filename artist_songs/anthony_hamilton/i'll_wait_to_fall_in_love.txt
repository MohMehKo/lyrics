I'll wait for you to fall in love
I'll hold myself for only you
You know I will baby
Along the way I've tried my hand in love
In hope that for one day it bring that unity
The one that feels natural and true like an olden day movie
Not pretentious both interest agree
That we belong in love
As of now I'm here to stay

I'll wait for you to fall in love
I'll wait I'll wait
I'll hold myself for only you
I'm gonna hold myself for you baby
I tried to settle down before
I tried I tried
But there's no other love that will do

Elated about you, overjoyed, a thrill to me
For once I can open my heart and share love freely
Come closer and make me your own
Create a lifetime for us baby
And shelter me close with your love
Cause there's no other love that can do

I'll wait for you to fall in love
Said I'll wait I'll wait
I'll hold myself for only you
I'm gonna hold myself for you baby
I tried to settle down before
Said I tried it before
There's no other love that will do

For your love I'll wait, I'll wait
Ooh I'll wait
Cause there's no love that will do
There's no love that makes me feel the way that you do my baby

I'll wait for you to fall in love
I'll hold myself for only you
I'm going to hold myself for you baby
I tried to settle down before
I've tried, I've tried
There's no other love that will do
I'll wait for you to fall in love
I'll hold myself for only you
There's no other love that will do
Make me feel like you do
Dooh, dooh, dooh, dooh dooh dooh
