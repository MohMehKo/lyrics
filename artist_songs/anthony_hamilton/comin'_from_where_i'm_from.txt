[Verse 1] 
Sittin here guess I didn't make bail 
Got time and a story to tell 
Started when I was nine years old 
Woke up my daddy was gone 
I started hustlin they couldn't tell me nothin 
Frontin in the hood tryin to be somebody 
My soul was on empty 
I was searchin for something 

[Pre-chorus] 
Tried to be good; Tried to keep from trouble 
Livin too fast; Tryin to make good on a hustle 

[Chorus] 
Sometimes it gets rough 
Comin from where I'm from, I'm from 
Times got hard 
Comin from where I'm from, I'm from 
Some times you gotta walk to work (yeah) 
Comin from where I'm from, I'm from 
Sometimes you gotta do a little dirt 

[Verse 2] 
Wasn't really lookin guess I found it 
Five foot three, light brown skin 
Comin from the university 
Nice style, lookin kinda lovely 
Didn't know she had much game 
Down to ride out, even take the train 
Even took her to a poker game 
She's top notch from fried chicken to sushi 

[Pre Chorus] 
Tried to be good, (I tried) tried to treat you like a lady 
Tried to be a friend, turned out that you were shady 

[Chorus]
Sometimes it gets lonely 
Comin from where I'm from, I'm from 
Thangs aint what they seem to be 
Comin from where I'm from, I'm from 
Sometimes you get a little angry 
Comin from where I'm from, I'm from 
Sometimes you get the best of me 

[Bridge] 
Well, tried to be good (I tried) 
Wanted nothing but to love somebody 
Didn't wanna die young 
Steady hustlin tryin to feed my family 
Too scared to have kids 
And do like daddy did 
Cuz I'm so scared of failin 
Sometimes it gets hard 
Comin from where I'm from 

[Chorus] 
Comin from where I'm, I'm from 
Sometimes you gotta moan 
Comin from where I'm from, I'm from 
Sometimes you gotta cry a little bit louder 
Comin from where I'm from, I'm from 
Sometimes you gotta fight the pain 
Comin from where I'm from, I'm from 
Sometimes you gotta walk alone 
Comin from where I'm from, I'm from 
Sometimes you get a little worried 
Comin from where I'm from, I'm from 
Sometimes you get lost outta touch 
Comin from where I'm from, I'm from 
Sometimes I think I pray a little bit too much 
Comin from where I'm from, I'm from 

Sometimes I get a little scared 
Comin from where I'm from, I'm from
