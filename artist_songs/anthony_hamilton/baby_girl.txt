She was just a teenager living in a grown woman's world,
Traded in her school books had herself a little baby girl,
Did it all with no father left there to care all on her own,
Got caught up in the street life damn near lost her soul,

[Chorus:]
Oh baby girl this is for you
Oh baby girl this love is for you
Ohh baby girl this is for you
Don't ever give up things are getting better yeah

Grew up in the broken home got tired of being all alone
Caught up in the strip club just to have some where to go
And money start coming in managed to get herself a home
Now she's back in school and she's moving right along

[Chorus:]
Oh baby girl this is for you
Oh baby girl this love is for you
Ohh baby girl this is for you
Don't ever give up things are getting better yeah

Oooooooooooooooh, Oh, Ooooooooooh, this love is for you
Oh baby girl this love is for you
Ohh baby girl this love is for you
Don't ever give up things are gettting better now

Oh baby girl right when you thought it was all going wrong
It started coming around, now it's back where it needs to be
Food on the table and a job over your head
Oh baby girl you looking good now
Baby girl this love is for you
