[Anthony Hamilton]
Last night I fell in love
Alright, alright, yea ummmm
yea,
It takes control of me when I see love in your eyes
Your like a spring time breezeU send chills through me 
A natural high
It's just the way you've been my best friend right by my side
And theirs no one else like u baby last night I realized thats why

[Chorus]
Last night I fell in lovem with u
(See I fell in love with u, again and again yea)
All over again, it's true, I fell in love with u

[Sunshine Anderson]
It was unbelievable, when u touched me so, tenderly
Your kiss was so sweet n though u will never know
It was like a dream
I hope that it will never end
Please do it again cuz it feels so right
I need someone to pinch me please
Cuz I cant believe it happened in one night

[Chorus]

[Dolo Pichino]
Last night it feeld just like (our very first time)
When u and I first made love (On that first night
It would be only right if we just lived our life (Side by side)
Cuz last night (Last night, last night) I feel in love with u again like  t first time

[Chorus]
