I can’t imagine my life without you baby, you taught me how to breathe 
Going in and out of relationships I was crazy send someone for me 
I thought I knew what love could do; you showed me things real love 
Without a doubt now I know all about, you showed me things real love 

[Chorus]
Right when I met you, the day that I met you, you turned my world around 
We fell in love 
Right there from the start, you came and stole my heart, you turned my world around 
We fell in love 

Now you and me, we got a jump on the future, girl we gotta plant a seed 
Have us a couple of babies as many as we can afford, come on do it for me yeah yeah 
I thought I knew what love could do; you showed me things real love 
Now I know all about, real love there’s no doubt, you showed me things real love 

[Chorus]

Funniest thing that you never know, it’s the funniest thing when you’re feeling low 
Funny how that true love just showed up (just showed up…) 

[Chorus x2]
