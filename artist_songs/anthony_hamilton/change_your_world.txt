[Verse 1]
I'd be in the hall of fame
the mere mentioning of your name
if they knew i loved you the way that I did
and kissin couldn't be a shame, when you love someone, and fallin in love there's no blame when it's all
said and done, and I never knew, about this thing, yeah, cause there were no clues, oh what a shame

[Chorus]
oh when you stop, and start falling in love, it changes your whole world, turns you upside
down, I never knew about real love, it changes your whole world, turns your world upside down

[Verse 2]
I must admit I stand accused of falling in love, long before you said hello, and I said I do,
it was all new to me, an unfamiliar world a beauty unknown to man and a cure for the blues
and I never knew about this thing yeah, and oh there were no clues, oh oh what a shame

[Chorus]
