Come over here
You know I've been waiting for you
To come on over here, girl
Stop playin'

Gonna take all that time
For you to come over and talk to me
Don't be afraid
Don't be afraid

Come over here, whisper in my ear
Tell me something sweet, my love
While I hold you close
I want you near, don't be afraid
All the plans I made, can I propose a toast?

Here's to you
Any and every little thing
And what you mean
I'm in love with you

I thank the Lord above
For sendin' me your precious love
You're what I want
I can't wait another day

Baby, I can't wait
For another day
Why don't you come on through?
I wanna be close to you

You're the icing on the cake
A special holiday
Since I laid eyes on you
I knew you were the one

It was alright
The very first time that we kissed
Off the coast of L.A.
On my way to North Carolina

You reminded me
Of a sweet serenade
As the music played
You sent me sailin' higher and higher

Here's to you
Any and every little thing
And what you mean
I'm in love with you

I thank the Lord above
For sendin' me your precious love
You're what I want
I can't wait another day

Baby, I can't wait
For another day
Why don't you come on through?
I wanna be close to you

You're the icing on the cake
A special holiday
Since I laid eyes on you
I knew you were the one

Baby, I can't wait
For another day
Why don't you come on through?
I wanna be close to you

You're the icing on the cake
A special holiday
Since I laid eyes on you
I knew you were the one

Baby, I can't wait
For another day
Why don't you come on through?
I knew you were the one

You're the icing on the cake
A special holiday
Since I laid eyes on you
I knew you were the one

You are everything I want and more
I'm in love
I never felt this way before, before
You are everything I ever wanted and more

Hey man, what's happenin'?
Ain't nothin'
