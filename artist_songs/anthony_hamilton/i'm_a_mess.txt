Can't believe Oh Oh no no no no whoaaa...

[Verse 1]
I'm so torn up now can't believe I lost you
Lost my best friend my soul mate can't believe it's true
We've invested in a set of twins a small house and the dog cried out
Knew I was suffering he was chained to my pain.
Me and you were meant to last forever
And empty walls can't hold this house together
We were born to live and die together
And now ya gone and I'm so alone
Baby come on home

[Chorus]
You could have called you could have wrote you could tried
I rather you slit me cross the throat so I can die
Instead of leaving no explanation  as to why
You don't want me no more
[Repeat]

[Verse 2]
I'm a mess right now I can't eat can't sleep
Bills are piling high ain't worked in three weeks
Ain't bathed can't shave cause my heart is so tender like living in a blender
I'm shaken and I'm stirred
You and me were meant to last forever
And empty walls can't hold this house together
We were meant to lie and die together
And now you're gone and I'm so alone
Baby come on home

[Chorus]
You could have called you could have wrote you could tried
I rather you slit me cross the throat so I can die
Instead of leaving no explanation as to why
You don't want me no more
[Repeat]

Call me write me love me come home
[Repeat]
[Ad lib out.......]
