Hello

Hello, hello, hello, hello

Hello (hello) it's been awhile since I've seen your smile,
I've had my eyes wide open for the longest time,
Hopefully I'd see you on TV,
Or a motion movie,

The strangest thing,
Happened to me just the other day,
I heard a voice and I called out your name,
As a speeding cab pulled off from me,
From me

Been awhile since I seen your smile,
And I don't know when,
I'll see you again,
Hopefully soon,
In old magnolia's room where I'll be waiting

The chances are,
You picked up packed up didn't go real far,
Maybe your resting on the other side of town,
hopefully waiting to be found,
be found,

The strangest thing,
Happened to me just the other day,
I heard a voice and I called out your name,
As a speeding cab pulled off from me,
From me

Been awhile since I seen your smile,
And I don't know when,
I'll see you again,
Hopefully soon,
In old magnolia's room where I'll be waiting

Been awhile since I seen your smile,
And I don't know when,
I'll see you again,
Hopefully soon,
In old magnolia's room where I'll be waiting

For you,
I would swim cross the ocean,
Fly cross the widest sea,
For you,
There ain't nothin in the world, 
I won't give to make you happy,
I gave up my nite life,
To be by your side,
Only if it will bring you home to me

Been awhile since I seen your smile,
And I don't know when,
I'll see you again,
Hopefully soon,
In old magnolia's room where I'll be waiting

I will be waiting baby,
I will be waiting

Been awhile since I seen your smile,
And I don't know when,
I'll see you again,
Hopefully soon,
In old magnolia's room where I'll be waiting

Been awhile since I seen your smile,
And I don't know when,
I'll see you again,
Hopefully soon,
In old magnolia's room where I'll be waiting

Been awhile since I seen your smile,
And I don't know when,
I'll see you again,
Hopefully soon,
In old magnolia's room where I'll be waiting

Ohhh magnolia's room is gettin kinda cold,
And you've been gone too long, too long,
And I'm goin crazy baby,
Yeahhh yeahh yeahhhh
