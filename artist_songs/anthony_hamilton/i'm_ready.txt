Follow follow follow

[Verse one]
Follow follow me I wanna play inside
Catch a game of love and let this go go high
We can do whatever let the time go by
As long as we're together

[Pre-chorus]
Sit in the room
Focus on you
Beautiful you
Show me your eyes
Heavenly eyes
Let's share our hearts tonight

[Chorus]
I'm ready - to be with you
I'm ready - to follow you
I'm ready - we can do whatever
Whatever - you wanna do
Whatever - I do it for you
I'm ready - let's follow our hearts tonight

[Verse 2]
Open open let's go take a chance on love
Follow in these footsteps like a child of love
It's alright the heavens open up for us
It's what wonderful means

[Pre-chorus]
Sit in the room
Focus on you
Beautiful you
Hand in hand
The harder than hard
With all of my heart

[Chorus]
I'm ready - to be with you
I'm ready - to follow you
I'm ready - we can do whatever
Whatever - you wanna do
Whatever - I do it for you
I'm ready - let's follow our hearts tonight

[Bridge]
Follow our hearts tonight
Oh oh oh
Love's alright - alright alright
Love's alright - alright

[Chorus]
I'm ready - to be with you
I'm ready - follow you
I'm ready - we can do whatever
Whatever - wanna do
Whatever - do it for you
I'm ready - we can do whatever
I'm ready - follow you
I'm ready - to follow you
I'm ready - to love you
Whatever - wanna do
Whatever - all that you wanna do
