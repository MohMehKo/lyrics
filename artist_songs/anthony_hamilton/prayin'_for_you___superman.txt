The whole world knows that your really special 
And every time you step in a room you impress them 
All I see is a traveling blessing 
All you are is a walk of perfection 
They don’t know how I feel about you 
They don’t know what I see in you I do, I do 
Get together you never met me 
Never got the letters I wrote for you for you 
Spend my time just thinking about you 
All my nights just dreaming about you 
Always just praying about you, praying about you, praying about you 
If I had one wish, I wish this dream was true 
And if I had somewhere to go, I hope it was with you 
I pack my bags up anyway ready for this travel 
Fill my truck with all our stuff and kicking up some gravel 
If I had one wish, I wish this dream was true 
I spend my time on my knees just praying for you [2x]

The whole world knows that your not ordinary 
Part woman rose the sweetest berries 
Woman like you so fine that its scary 
I name my daughter after you if you let me 
They don’t know how I feel about you 
They don’t know what I see in you I do, I do 
Get together you never met me 
Never got the letters I wrote for you for you 
Spend my time just thinking about you 
All my nights just dreaming about you 
Always just praying about you, praying about you, praying about you 
If I had one wish, I wish this dream was true 
And if I had somewhere to go, I hope it was with you 
I pack my bags up anyway ready for this travel 
Fill my truck with all our stuff and kicking up some gravel 
If I had one wish, I wish this dream was true 
I spend my time on my knees just praying for you [4x]
I’ll spend my time
