Sleigh bells are in the atmosphere
Keepin' the spirit alive
Sugar belles out on the shopping spree
Makin' sure them children get right
Could it be a major thing in movin' in
From the heavens above
A big plate of my mama's cookin'
Brings the feeling of love

Oh, how I wish I had my way
And I could stay here forever and a day

Feels just like Christmas
Many love is in the air
Everybody's headin' home
Baby, it's Christmas
Hear the bells are ring-a-ling
Everybody's singin' along

Everything the kids ever want is here
From the toys to the shoes
Santa Claus getting closer and closer
I heard some talk on the news
Baby, it's time to take a load off
Come in and take your coat off and chill, yeah
Sit on down, there's family and friends in here
I can't explains how it feels, yeah

Oh, how I wish I had my way
And I could stay forever and a day, day

Feels just like Christmas
Many love is in the air
Everybody's headin' home
Baby, it's Christmas
Hear the bells are ring-a-ling
Everybody's singin' along
Feels just like Christmas
Many love is in the air
Everybody's headin' home
Baby, it's Christmas
Hear the bells are ring-a-ling
Everybody's singin' along

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
And, and the spirit wants to take me higher
Oh, oh, and if I had my way
I, I'd give up all I own to stay and have my family close
'Cause nothing really matters, as long as I can feel this way

Feels just like Christmas
Many love is in the air
Everybody's headin' home
Baby, it's Christmas
Hear the bells are ring-a-ling
Everybody's singin' along
Feels just like Christmas
Many love is in the air
Everybody's headin' home
Baby, it's Christmas
Hear the bells are ring-a-ling
Everybody's singin' along
See, everybody's singing along

Hey, hey
Ooh, wee
Say ooh, wee, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, I can stay and have my way
If we do it like Christmas every day
It would be just like Christmas every day
Never want for nothin'
'Cause it would always be Christmas
Hey, ooh, hey
