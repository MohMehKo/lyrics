I had a habit of messing up 
Staying out late and getting drunk 
I let you down a thousand times 
Broken promises 
It's like I ran away from you 
My career was my excuse 
Until I saw you about to drown in your own tears 

And as you cried in my arms 
You woke up my heart 
And I saw again what I found in you 
Cuz her heart, her heart wont let me lose her 
No matter how I try 
I just cant say goodbye and lose her 

When all the folks were said and done 
You were there to welcome me home 
I was convicted cuz your love never wavered 
I know you love me more than me 
And you vowed to love through anything 
I never had a kind of love that was forever 

And as you cried in my arms 
You woke up my heart 
And I saw again what I found in you 
Cuz her love, her love wont let me lose her 
No matter how I try 
I just cant say goodbye and lose her 

Cuz her heart, her heart wont let me lose her 
No matter how hard I try 
I just cant say goodbye and lose her 
No matter how hard I try 
I just cant say goodbye and lose her 
No matter how I try 
I just cant say goodbye and lose her
