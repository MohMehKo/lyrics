[Anthony Hamilton]
Got my back against the wall now
Problems that I didnt see
We got caught up in a tangle
Then u tried to swing on me
How could I justify, mistreating the love of my life
I aint to proud to beg for better baby
Thats what I deserve
I tried to be good to u
Even stood their by u
And u ran out on me anyway
I must have been a fool
cuz

[Chorus]
All is fair in love and war
So when u fight with someone u love
U better be careful
Theirs no feeling,theirs no blows
Theirs just things u didnt know
Cuz in the morning it will be alright, alright, alright

[Macy Gray]
Here comes him again
sneaking in the backdoor
Blue heart torn from trippin from days of my past
Im ***** and Im angry no time to catch feeling
I've been done wrong so Im stone cold
And time to get even
Loves a gamble, and I aint winning
Torn up from my past
Love dont live here no more

[Chorus 2x]

[Anthony Hamilton (Macy Gray)]
Ooooh, yeah
All is fair in love and war
All is fair in love and war
Somebody wanna lay me
(I tried to hurt u cuz u tried to throw me out)
Somebody to crule to me
(U took my heart out and u tried to play it soft)
U took my heart and stoned it
(I didnt want to take and try to lead u on)
All I was was good to u
(I didnt want to take and try to lead u on)
Somebody wanna hurt me
(I tried to hurt u cuz u tried to play me out)
Now ur gonna ride wit me baby
(U took my heart out and u tried to play it soft)
How long did it last
(I didnt want to take and try to lead u on)
U took the best of me
(I took the best of u)
Aint to many more days Im gonna be treated this way
And it aint to many more lies, Im gonna listen to here baby
If u listen to me baby
(Why would I listen to u)
