[Verse I]
Chyna Black is like an open road 
Takes me places releases my soul 
Ain't it funny how life goes 
Takes a turn through a journey unknown 

No hesitation no tug no pulls 
Aint no need of fighting for what's yours 
A little smile releases old smoke 
Just take the ride read the signs and hold on. 

[Chorus]
You're what I want 
You're what I need 
Give me reason to just to breath 
You're everything I'm hoping for give me love and so much more 
You're what I want 
You're what I need 
You touch the deepest part of me 

[Verse II]
Chyna Black is like my old ford 
Picks me up helps carry the load 
I can depend on when times are cold 
Soothes my body like mom's old robe. 

No hesitation no tug no pull 
Ain't no need of fighting for what's yours 
A little smile release old smoke 
Just take the ride read the signs and hold on. 

[Chorus]
You're what I want 
You're what I need 
Give me reasons just to breath 
You're what I want 
You're what I need 
You touch the deepest part of me 
You're what I want 
You're what I need 

Give me everything
Give me everything 
Give me everything
That I need 
Give me everything
Give me everything 
What would I do without you 

Chyna Black is like an open road
