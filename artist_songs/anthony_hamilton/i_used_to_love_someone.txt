[Verse 1]
Ooh lord, oh lord
Oh Lord,Oh
Well, I remember when I used to love someone
That looked just like u
And also I can remember
The smell of her sweet perfume
She used to tell me things that I used to love
She had her way of getting the best of my heart
And also she had a way of
Keeping me smiling, but now she's gone

[Chorus]
I used to love someone
But now I'm on the run
She had a hold on me
Stripping the walls of my heart

[Verse 2]
Also I can remember the first day that u came in my life
It seemed then that u were a little more open
With all of your thoughts
And the days u used to talk to me
But now I don't know who u really are
It seems that the look of yours eyes
Is that your drifting off from afar
And u don't even seem the same
It's like you're playing a game with me

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Hmm...
The love I once knew (love that I once knew)
Still has a hold on me (hold on me)
I've tried, ooh I've tried
To love you

[Chorus]

But now I'm on the run
She has a hold on me
Stripping my heart, oh
And I don't know what made me do it
Something came along and blew it
Somewhere
I used to love someone
Now I'm on the run
From the love I once knew
Stripping the walls of my heart, used to love
She had a hold on me
Stripping, stripping my heart
