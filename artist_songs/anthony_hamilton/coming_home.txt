When I asked you what you wanted from me this year
Your tears came crashing down (oh...)
I know what I've been promising you my dear
This year won't let you down

Even if the snow falls
Even if the roads closed
You won't be alone no
Even if it's so cold
As far as the north pole
Just wait under the mistletoe

I'm coming home
That would be the best gift
Baby I promise 
I'm coming home
Baby this Christmas
Home is where the heart is
I'm coming home

So many nights you sleep alone in that bed
They asked where daddy is gone 
You keep a smile in your face but in your head
You miss me in your arms

So this year
Even if the snow falls 
Even if the roads closed
You won't be alone no
Even if it's so cold 
As far as the north pole 
Just wait under the mistletoe

I'm coming home
That would be the best gift
Baby I promise 
I'm coming home
Baby this Christmas
Home is where the heart is
I'm coming home

There's no other place I'd rather be
And gather around the Christmas tree
Sharing it all with my family (yeah...)

I'm coming home
That would be the best gift
Baby I promise 
I'm coming home
Baby this Christmas
Home is where the heart is
I'm coming home (yeah...)

Baby I promise
Home is where the heart is
I'm coming home (home...)
