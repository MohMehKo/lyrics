When you're lying in my open arms
Do you ever think forever
Get a glimpse of what I am dreaming of
Gold in heart will live forever

Ever seen heaven through me
Heaven through me
Ever seen heaven through me
Heaven through me
Ever seen heaven through me
Heaven through me
Ever seen heaven

Ever since my heart has been opened up
It's like I'm truly living
Forever is just not long enough
I dream of us never ending

Ever seen heaven through me
Heaven through me
Ever seen heaven through me
Heaven through me
Ever seen heaven through me
Heaven through me
Ever seen heaven

What time love would never ever end
Ever seen heaven
Sun will shine for days, walk all these streets forever
Ever seen heaven

Forever and a day
Ever seen heaven through me
Have you ever seen heaven
Ever seen heaven through me
Heaven through me
Ever seen heaven through me
Have you ever seen heaven
Ever seen heaven

Ohooooooooo
Ever seen heaven through me
Ever seen heaven through me
Have you ever seen heaven
Ever seen heaven through me
Have you ever seen heaven through me
Have you ever seen heaven yeah
