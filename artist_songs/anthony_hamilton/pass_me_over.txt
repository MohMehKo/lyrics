[Verse 1]
Another day chance to make another chance, a fragile place running on empty, a smile so faint
can barely even break his face, world is on shoulders now, don't be afraid, he who knows will make a way,
his word alone is what has kept me, born the son, king of eternal peace, lay your burdens down

[Chorus:]
If you catch me dreaming please don't wake me til I'm done, just leave me sleeping until the
morning come, just pass me over, make believe that I'm not there just leave me be until the saviour comes

[Verse 2]
Another night makes a way to the morn , sleeping peace joy come early, a covered child steps
away victorious, salvation holds joy for all of us

[Chorus 2x]

Pass me over
Pass me over
Pass me over
Til the saviour comes [repeat]
