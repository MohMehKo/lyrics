Hey, hey, yeah
Oh, we'll be, we'll be, yeah
Oh

I been seeking survival, it seems like my whole life long
And I been working so hard and it feels like it's all gone wrong
Time lonely, need someone to push me to help me through
And make my way through the clouds to the sun like that'll make do

(We'll be fine again)
I say we'll be
(We'll be fine again)
Fine again
(We'll be fine again)
Oh, we'll be fine again

I see, people waitin' for answers to questions no one knows
Drinking Joe's, only thinkin' "Oh Lord, whole life blown"
May we pass out hugs to the thugs to heal our souls
And blue collar suffering, oh Lord, heal us all

(We'll be fine again)
Oh, we'll be fine
(We'll be fine again)
Oh, we're gonna make it through, yeah
(We'll be fine again)
We'll be fine
(We'll be fine again)

Ay, hey
(We'll be alright)
I can't wait to see the brighter picture
(We'll be okay)
Everybody
(Sunlight will shine, past the storm)

Say every, every, everybody, we'll be fine
(We'll be fine again)
I know we will, I know it'll get better
(We'll be fine again)

You don't have to drink yourself to sleep at night
(We'll be fine again)
You don't have to stomp all over your problems, no
(We'll be fine again)

Everybody needs a hug
(We'll be fine again)
(We'll be alright)
The whole world, the whole world will be fine
(We'll be fine again)
(We'll be okay)

Oh, yeah
(We'll be fine again)
We'll be just fine
(We'll be fine again)
(We'll be alright)

We'll be alright, we'll be so fine
I know it gets better with time
Go on and let your hair down
Don't worry no more, no more
Don't worry no more, no more
I say we'll be fine again
I say we'll be fine again
