Ooh my babe
Ooh my love
Ooooooooooooooooohohohohohowoah

Early was the morn
Flowers filled with dew
I became somebody through loving you
Softly as a child
Born in natural rain
I predict the seasons
To go unchanged

[Chorus:]
Sometimes in life
You run across a love unknown
Without a reason
It seems like you belong
Hold on dear life
Don't go off running from whats new
I became somebody
Through loving you

Warm was the sun
That covered my body so
Reminded me of you
As I'd first known
Those were the days
A day that changed my life
And made me do
I became somebody through loving you

[Chorus]

As the sun shines
Down on me
I know with you in love is where I wanna be
Ooooh sometimes I go on through life
Thinking that love is something that's
Not meant for me

Woooooooooaaaaah
Somebody
Somebody
Hold on dear life
Don't go off running from whats new
I became somebody through loving you
I became somebody through loving you
Oh I became somebody through loving you

Oooh oooh ooooooooh
