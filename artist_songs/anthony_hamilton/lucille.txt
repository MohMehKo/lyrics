[Verse 1] 
My old lady's on the other side of town with her ex boyfriend 
Drinking again, drinking again. 
So you choose to lose someone who loves you and a real good friend 
For a bottle of gin, a bottle of sin 

[Chorus] 
You picked a fine time to leave me Lucille 
Now I'm sitting at the top of the hill. 
Now my heart is broken and I'm all alone and don't know what to feel 
Since you been gone, gone away. 

[Verse 2] 
I over heard somebody say they saw you crying in a bar last night 
With a blackend eye, blackend eye. 
I know mistakes I made but its time.....For another that will 
Treat you right, treat you right 

[Chorus] 
You picked a fine time to leave me Lucille 
Now I'm sitting at the top of the hill. 
Now my heart is broken and I'm all alone and don't know what to feel since you been gone, gone away. 

[Repeat]

[Bridge] 
Used to love me now you want to leave me right when I told you I love you 
Don't think you ever believe me when I said. 
Use to love me now you want to run away right when I told you I love you 
Don't think you ever believe me when I said 

Ohh..I love you...Ohh I love you...I love you 
You were my baby 
You were my love sugar darling 
I know he didn't love you the way I did 
Baby oh I love you 
Don't you know I cared 
Don't you know I love you 
And I always want to be there 
Ohh..you know I love you 
You know I love you baby 
And you know he really didn't care about you 
I never would have hit you baby no no 
Said I never would have hit you baby
