Yea I did it 
It was time 
Yea 
Why keep asking me 
Keep harassing me 
All those questions about who and what she means to me 
I’m a lucky guy 
I found someone that I 
Can paint the town 
Run around 
Someone to talk with 
Such a lucky fit 
Baby she be it 
You wanna know if I’ve fallen for her 
I tell you quickly 
Free up some energy 
Cause I don’t want to let her go 

[Chorus]
I did it for sho 
All the trips abroad (trips abroad) 
Max’d out credit cards (credit cards) 
Throwing down to Mr Chows (Mr Chows) 
I did it for sho 
Meant to let you see (let you see) 
You just can’t sleep on me (sleep on me) 
Another on will come around (around) 

I feel we had our chance 
And it’s come to an end 
Now you wanna come around 
Naw girl go with your friends 
We used to love them streets 
But now I need my sleep 
So I can dream of things 
That you couldn’t even see 
She’s got a vision 
So much she put me in it 
You wanna know if I’ve fallen for her 
I tell you quickly 
Free up some energy 
Cause I don’t want to do her wrong 

[Chorus]
I did it for sho 
All the trips abroad (trips abroad) 
Max’d out credit cards (credit cards) 
Throwing down to Mr Chows (Mr Chows) 
I did it for sho 
Meant to let you see (let you see) 
You just can’t sleep on me (sleep on me) 
Another on will come around (around) 

Ohhhhhhh 
Ohhhhhhh 
There comes a time 
When things have to change and 
People have to go their separate ways and 
You know all the talk Beyonce with “to the left, to the left”, there’s nothing left 
Not here, for you 
So I’m putting it all on the line 
I’m letting you know 
I’ve been spending time 
So I need you to spin wheels 
And I’ll see you when I see you 

[Chorus]
I did it for sho 
All the trips abroad (trips abroad) 
Max’d out credit cards (credit cards) 
Throwing down to Mr Chows (Mr Chows) 
I did it for sho 
Meant to let you see (let you see) 
You just can’t sleep on me (sleep on me) 
Another on will come around (around) 

I did it for sho 
All the love we had (love we had) 
You took for granted and (granted and) 
You thought I'd never write those vows (write those vows) 
I did it for sho 
Shouldn’t have slept on me (slept on me) 
Thought I’d be left lonely (I’d be left lonely) 
We just bought a place across town (town) 

Oooooh 
Oooooh 
Oooooooh 
Oh uh oh hoo ohhh 
Oooooh 
Oooooh 
Oooooooh 
Oh uh oh hoo ohhh 
Oooooh 
Oooooh 
Oooooooh 
Oh uh oh hoo ohhh
