Too much pride to back off of it 
I wear it well when no one can see 
I'm talking about pain 
Gonna take trials to be delivered 
Ya'll know that happiness ain't for free 
I'm heading down the wrong way 
Please somebody won't ya 
Oh please won't somebody please stop me 

My soul is on fire 
And I can't take this fight no way 
Got me running [5x]
My soul is on fire 
And I can't face another day 

I'm still hurting, bought to give up 
Done lost sleep, and lost weight, I'm doing bad 
Getting hard to keep my chin up 
I need somebody to kneel and pray for me 
I'm heading down the wrong way 
Getting hard for me to breathe 
Oh please won't somebody please stop me 

My soul is on fire 
And I can't take this fight no way 
Got me running [5x]
My soul is on fire 
And I can't face another day 
(I can't face another day, yeah) 

(Ooh, my soul) My soul got me burning, got me hurting, got me 
(Ooh, my soul) Won't you free, won't you help me, won't you listen to me 

[ad lib]

My soul is on fire and I can't take this fight no way 
Got me running [3x]
My soul is on fire 
And I can't face another day (I can't make it through another day) 

My soul is on fire (got me watching my back) 
And I can't take this fight no way (you got me giving up, and I gotta keep my chin up) 
My soul is on fire 
And I can't face another day 
(got me running, got me running got me) [2x]
