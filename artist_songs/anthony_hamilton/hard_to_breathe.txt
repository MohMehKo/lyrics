Made me change my plan 
Walk in a different space 
Loving you is all I seem to think about 
And 
Will u let me go if I 
Turn around and walk the other way 
Or would u haunt my heart 
For the rest of my life? 
I don't want to be caught up in you and 
I don't want to have to see your face 
I every other woman, 

It get's hard to breathe 
Only when I'm next to you 
I guess I got caught up in you 
I got to break these chains 
It's so hard to sleep 
I feel your love 
Is closing in 
Forcing me to play my hand 
And I don't want to win 

Loosing sleep for days 
The distraction that you made 
Keeping me from moving on 
Piecing back my life 
Would it be this way if I 
Had never fell in love with you 
I think it'd be quite alright 
If I never knew your name 
I don't wanna be caught up in you 
And I don't wanna see your face 
In every other woman 

It get's hard to breathe 
Only when I'm next to you 
I guess I got caught up in you 
I got to break these chains 
It's so hard to sleep 
I feel your love 
Is closing in 
Forcing me to play my hand 
And I don't want to win 

Moving just too much 
Think I'm giving up 
Ohhhhhhh 
Ohhhhhhhhhh 
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh 

It get's hard to breathe 
Only when I'm next to you 
I guess I got caught up in you 
I wanna break these chains 
It's so hard to sleep 
I feel your love 
Is closing in 
Feel your love 
Closing in on me:. 
It's gets hard to breathe 
Ohhhh :.. 

I'm up late at night 
I thought I saw you in my dreams 
Thought I saw you in my dreams
