Please don’t leave me here crying 
Don’t go, don’t go baby
Cause I’m tired, and I’m scared, and I’m lonely
Please don’t leave me here begging
Can’t make it through the night ‘til the morning

I never knew how to treat a love
Cause I never knew love before 
I never thought much of myself
Never thought that I’d amount to much 
Until you told me, I was something
And I never quite knew how to act, oh 
Now you’re gone and I’m all alone
How can I bring you on back 

Please don’t leave me here crying 
Don’t go baby
Cause I’m tired, and I’m scared, and I’m lonely, 
Don’t leave 
Please don’t leave me here begging
Can’t make it through the night ‘til the morning

All my friends think I’m crazy, they just tell him 
They said I’m better off being by myself 
But girl I love you more than I love myself
It’s like you’re kin to me, a friend to me
Oh yea, baby

Now I lay here all alone
And the walls all come tumbling down on me
I need you baby, 
Please don’t leave me here crying
Cause I’m tired, and I’m sad, and I’m lonely
Please don’t leave me here begging
Don’t you leave me 
Can’t make it through the night ‘til the morning
All by myself, thank you baby 
Don’t run away baby
Cause I need you
Cause I need you to stay with me 
Yes, ooh yes, ooh,

Please don’t leave me here crying
Don’t go, don’t leave 
Cause I’m tired, and I’m scared, and I’m lonely
I can’t make it on my own, I can’t make it on my own
Please don’t leave me here begging
Don’t go, don’t go baby
Can’t make it through the night ‘til the morning
I can’t make it on my own, no, no
Cause I can’t eat, said I can’t sleep 
No, no, no I can’t make it on my own, oh-oh-oh 
Please don’t leave me here begging
Don’t go, oh, oh 
Can’t make it, can’t make it
Without you, without you in my life, my life oh, oh oh 
Cause I’m tired, and I’m scared, and I’m lonely, I’m so lonely
I’m tired, I’m scared, I’m so lonely, I’m so lonely 

Please don’t leave me here begging
Don’t leave me begging
Can’t make it through the night, I can’t make it, I can’t make it baby ‘til the morning 
Cause I’m tired, and I’m sad, and I’m lonely
Please don’t leave me here begging
Don’t you leave me 
Can’t make it through the night ‘til the morning
I’m here baby, I’m so tired, I’m so lonely 
Please believe, I can’t make it on my own baby
Cause I, cause I need you in my life
You’re wrong, you’re so damn wrong baby
