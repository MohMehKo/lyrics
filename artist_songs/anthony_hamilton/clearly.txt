[Verse 1]
You've got me caught up in a daze 
And I, cant seem to understand
What I've been thinking
And although your coming clearly now
It's hard for me to turn around and keep from blinking
All that I can do is be their
And heaven knows that I swear u do something to me
That I'll never ever tell a lie
I'll always be their by your side
Your so soothing

[Chorus]
It's clearly understandable
That I'm not some type of animal 
I'm just in love with u
And heaven knows Im glad I found ya
Loving and u came around to do the things that u do

[Verse 2]
U dont even hardly speak to me
Tell me what could it be 
To let you walk away  so freely
But u still call from time to time
Tell me why u play with me mind
I know u wanna be here with me
All that I can do is be their
And heaven knows that I swear u do something to me
That I'll never ever tell a lie
I'll always be their by your side your so soothing

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I just dont know what I've been doing wrong
In your life baby
Baby if u give me one my time 
I will never ever leave yours side
Ooooh

[Chorus]
