[Verse I]
Could it be your nice silky tone 
Ohh..that makes me want you girl 
Distant nights spent love on the phone 
As I touch myself
How I want you more 
The mood evokes
Incense smoke and I'm burning up in temperature
Ready to explode 
Come take a toke
Let's float
Baby on higher ground 

[Chorus]
Baby come
Float with me 
Let me take
You to a place on higher honey 
Baby come
Float with me 
Face to face
Build a body of fire honey 
[Repeat]

[Verse II]
Could it be your sweet sweet moan 
While I'm inside your world your world 
A sudden glance that you give from across the room 
Come and take control yeah 
Open up my favorite bottle
Let the wind blow 
Create an atmosphere
Stay right here 
Listen to the rain
Your handprints on the window pane 
And its burning me up with the desire ohh.. 

[Bridge]
When I think about it
I don't want to be without it 
Baby grab a hold
Feel me in your soul 
Forever more climb on 
You beong to me 
[Repeat]

[Chorus]
Baby come
Float with me 
Let me take
You to a place on higher honey 
Baby come
Float with me 
Face to face
Build a body of fire honey 
[Repeat]

Call me
Write me
Love me
Come home 
[Repeat]
[Ad lib out.......]
