Love is an angry thing
It'll tear your heart to pieces
And love, such a crazy thing
It'll break you down when you least expect it

Though I knew about love
I've been decieved
Love don't love nobody
Certainly not me
You used to have your way with me
We fought all the time
Misunderstandings
Led me to being blinsided
You knocked the wind out of me
How could you be so cruel?
Love

Thought I knew it all
Yeah
Then you turned on me

Love is an angry thing
It'll tear your heart to pieces
And love, love such a crazy thing
It'll steal your heart when you least expect it

Thought I really knew love
Till you turned on me
Tellin' me lies
Putting the blame on me
I became your victim
Lost sight of what was right
Now I barely believe
You were ever really mine
You knocked the wind out of me
And I was good to you
Love

I found love
You see, I thought I knew it all
I found love
Until your turned on me

Love is an angry thing
It'll tear your heart to pieces
And love is a crazy thing
It'll tear you down when you least expect it

Love is an angry thing
It'll tear your heart to pieces
See, love, love is a crazy thing
It'll break you down when you least expect it

Say, oh love
Such an angry thing
