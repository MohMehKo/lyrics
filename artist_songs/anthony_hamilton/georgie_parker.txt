[Verse 1]
Mmmm, mmmmm, mmmmm
Mmmmm, mmmmm, yeah
OOooohh
Their used to be a little old boy
Riding my bus home from school yea
Introverted, kinda frail didn't think much of himself, noo
He used to see the petty
His mothers drunken boyfriend
Hanging out by the corner store
There was a very old lady
That used to call him baby
And in his mind this is what he heard

[Chorus]
Georgie Parker, get away
Georgie Parker, come with me
Georgie Parker, free your mind
Georgie Parker, let yourself be
Georgie Parker, come with me
Georgie Parker, oooh
Georgie Parker, George

[Verse 2]
Trying to be his only friend
He wasn't open to strangers then
He turned his head and walked away
As he turned around and started to cry, why me?
Stuck in the lions den
To scared to let help in
He had to make a sacrifice
He tried to cope with it
And couldn't find the strength
Could anybody tell me what Georgie did

[Chorus]

[bridge]
There'll be a better place for you and me
Free your mind
Get away, follow me
Follow me to a place
Free your mind lets go to, to a place
Where you can be free, oh Georgie (let yourself be free)
Free your mind, let yourself go the rest will follow
