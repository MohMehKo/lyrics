[Verse 1]
Aint nobody worryin, when the shots fly high and the sirens start to ring, aint nobody worryin,
when the kids die young and the mothers are suffering, aint nobody praying, when they neal down low all
they doin is tyin their shoe strings, aint nobody worryin no more, no more, no more, no more, 
The homeless have no where to turn when their stomachs start to burn cause they aint got food to eat,
and how the children gonna learn, when they gotta take turns cause they aint got books to read, then our
babies turn to crime, started gettin high cause the job trades kinda slow, cause aint nobody worryin no
more , no more, no more, no more

When the tears start to fall, and you can't see your way, the just will carry on come on judgement day,
you don't have to moan, helps on the way, cause aint nobody worryin no more no more no more

These are our precious times, deseases takin lives, medicaid ran out, showed me a weapon line, there's a
mother on her own, tryin to beat the drout, tell me when will this end, all the sufferin, my faith is
runnin low, aint nobody worryin no more, no more, no more, no more, no more
Aint nobody worryin no more no more no more no more no more

When the tears start to fall, and you can't see your way, the just will carry on come on judgement day,
you don't have to moan, helps on the way, cause aint nobody worryin no more no more no more

Aint nobody worryin, when the shots fly high and the sirens start to ring, aint nobody worryin, when the
kids die young and the mothers are suffering, the black man doin time and nobody cares for him, the
governments on the grind, and tryna fence him in, (our babies are gettin high) while drugs in the school
we need to pray again, when will it end will it end will it end, will it end

Cause Aint nobody worryin 
shots fly high and the sirens start to ring
Aint nobody worryin 
when the kids die young and the mothers are suffering
Aint nobody worryin (prayin) 
when they neal down low all they doin is tyin their shoe strings,
aint nobody worryin
no more no more no more no more no more no more
