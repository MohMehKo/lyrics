[Chorus]
Tried for so long
For you to hold on

But you won't be long
To anyone

Any thang, any love
At all

[Verse I]
I thought we had it all
Until things started to receed

Giving me no love at all
Not caring enough about my needs

Gave you my heart and all my soul
But not once did I let go

And I tried
To stick by you
And I tried to call
To let you know

That I'm here for you
And I'm give my all

[Chorus]
Tried for so long
For you to hold on

But you want belong
To anyone

Any thang, any love
At all

[Verse II]
You had the best love of you life

But you didn't treat it right
No you didn't
No you didn't girl

To busy running out all night long
Didn't even have the decency to just 
Pick up the telephone
And just call me
And let me know where you were

And that your alright
So I can sleep at night
Girl you showed out so

Had the nerve to break up our happy home
All I wanna do
Is do for you

[Chorus]
Tried for so long
For you to hold on

But you want be long
To anyone

Any thang, any love
At all

I stood by your side
Sheltered for you
When things were down

I help pull you through
Faithful and all
Trusting and warm
But you took heart by storm

[Chorus]
[Repeat]
