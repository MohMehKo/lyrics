Oh oh oh 
Oooooo baby oh oh oh

It’s so natural to fall in love with you 
Let me bring you joy whatever that’s plan
I’m willing and able to pick you up again
Whenever you falling I will be your best’s friend

Why feel like I fallin in love again
Why can’t I hide the way I fill inside

You’re so sensual the way you walk and smile
I think I should surrender to what I feel inside
I want to make love to you and let you know
I can’t live without you and I’m never gonna let you go

[2X]
Why feel like I fallin in love again
Why can’t I hide the way I fill inside

Ooooo baby

Hey there miss lady, you sure do have a pretty smile
Such a lovely dress hmm you from around here
From these parks so that means if I come back tomorrow
I can uh see you and maybe talk to you for a while you know and uh 

I can’t wait to see her and give her all my love
(I’m going be in love with you baby)
I know this feeling and give her all my love
(I’m going be in love with you baby)

Why feel like I fallin in love again
Why can’t I hide the way I fill inside
Then I love her baby

The way I feel inside
It must be her warm smile
Touch me deep inside
