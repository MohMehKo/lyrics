[Verse 1]
Well, oooh, heeey
Baby, baby
I can just feel it all in my bones
Thinking of your loveleness and when you'll be coming home
Babygiril I will intend in doing what I gotta do
To be their holding and loving u

[Chorus]
Day dreaming when I sleep
Caught up in the memories
I know love and it plays for keeps
to good to be real
Day dreaming when I sleep
Caught up in the memories
Of loving,loving baby 

[Verse 2]
Each and everytime the thought of u passed my mind
I dont know what else to do baby
I think I'm falling, falling, falling deeper in love baby 
But u just keep calling in my mind

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
All I know that it's so good
Feeling so, so baby please
This love is to good to be true
And yea I think of u

[Chorus]
