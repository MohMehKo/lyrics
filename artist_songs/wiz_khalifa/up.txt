Run it...

I don't know what's going on
About this feeling
You got me feeling
Cause every time I try to leave I'm right back again
And I ain't going nowhere
You got me walking on the ceiling

So when the times get hard
And the nights you're all alone
Oh...
I'll be the one you ca... a... all on
No telling where we might... go

Hold On...

And every time you look up
Baby I'm right there
Flying in the air
So let all of your fears go... o... o
You'll never spend a night... low

Keep both of those...

You go
Up... Up... Up... Up... Up... Up... Up... Up
We go
Up... Up... Up... Up... Up... Up... Up... Up
We go
Up... Up... Up... Up... Up... Up... Up... Up
We go
Up (Up)... Up (Up)... Up (Up)... Up (Up)... Up (Up)... Up (Up)... Up (Up)... Up...

So high I'm not coming down
You with me
You ain't comin down either

Let's write our names on a cloud
Bring some down
Roll it up and pass it all around
God Damn...
She a keeper

Ya...

So when the times get hard
And the nights you're all alone
Oh...
I'll be the one you ca... a... all on
No telling where we might... go

And every time you look up
Baby I'm right there
Flying in the air
So let all of your fears go... o... o
You'll never spend a night... low

You go
Up... Up... Up... Up... Up... Up... Up... Up
We go
Up... Up... Up... Up... Up... Up... Up... Up
We go
Up... Up... Up... Up... (Yeeeah)... Up... Up... Up... Up
We go
Up (Up)... Up (Up)... Up (Up)... Up (Up)... Up (Up)... Up (Up)... Up (Up)... Up...

Cause everything's better when you're high
Everything's better when you're high
Everything's better when you're high
Everything's better when you're high
If you don't smoke
I don't know why

Cause everything's better when you're high
Everything's better when you're high
Everything's better when you're high
Everything's better when you're high
If you don't smoke
I don't know why

Keep all that...
Even keep that...
And keep that too...
Just cut this out...
