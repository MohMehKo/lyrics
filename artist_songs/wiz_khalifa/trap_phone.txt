I handle business on my trap phone, oh
If you need it then I got it for ya, oh
If you want it, it won't take long, no
My niggas always got it for you

Money making mitch
Old beamer on your bitch
On the gang, on my name
Swear that I would never switch
Man Wizzle hit the switch
Bring your friends who you with
Girl this outfit fire, I just bought it, we lit
Still with it, still get it for the low if niggas need it
Four bottles, four models, kick you out if you conceited
Gang gang twist my fingers
Couple pieces in the cleaners
You could keep her I don't cuff her
On my momma, fuck you thinkin'
Rubber bands in my hands tryna' throw it in the zone
All night no curfew she responded, boy I'm grown
Drop your homegirls off don't be playing, let me know
Don't hit my main line hit me on my trap phone
That's on crip

I handle business on my trap phone, oh
If you need it then I got it for ya, oh
If you want it, it won't take long, no
My niggas always got it for you

[Bluntsmoker:]
Money Got them [?]
Sour got my Eyes lows
Only hit my trap phone
A rat if you need [?]
Kush in the raw tray
Blunts with the bombay
Trappin out the hallway
Servin' niggas all day
Tellin' that's a no no
[?]
Stuntin in my photos
Rockin' all this polo
Only talk to OGs, smokin' on this strong weed
My bank account is OD
Hoes stay on me

[Wiz Khalifa:]
And I'm probably fucking your bitch
Just put the '61 on pumps
Had to juice it up
Haters loosen up
We just doin' us
Four pumps, I got fluid in the trunk
Hit the corner doing three wheels
Let the right corner [?]
Two licks in the back two in the front
Plus I got that skunk rolled up, the streets showed us
How to gain control emoted, pull it out ain't a stain on it
King of Pittsburgh so I moved to California
Hit your girl now she horny
Bought the low rider, went and stored me
We ain't into fake, them niggas corny
Them cameras on so we stay performing
Just call my name when the plane boarding
Gang

[Chevy Woods:]
The trap line is open, just chirp me
We done rolled
