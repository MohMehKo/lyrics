[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
When I'm ridin
I'm high got my drink poured my weed rolled
I creep slow, my bitch on my side and
Wherever that change go this game go
Some talk it they lame tho
The hoes on it, they want it, they say so
Whenever we roll by
So won't you jump your pretty ass in my car in my car
Won't you jump your pretty ass in my car in my car
Won't you jump your pretty ass in my car in my car
Won't you jump your pretty ass in my car in my car girl

[Wiz Khalifa:]
My car match what year it is
It's hard not to hear the shit
Just know I'm gone no matter what gear I'm in
Eyes closed when I'm steerin
Blowin o's out the window,
Suede on the floor, doors, plus the ceiling
And I keep it clean,
Hoes wanna get in they gotta wipe their feet
Go over a few things, then I'm a wipe this weed
Don't want any burn marks sweetheart
So hang it out the window, if you gotta
Fuck up once, I get you outta here
Uhh
I'm talkin loud pipes and rally stripes
So much paper I'm mistaken have to count it twice
Yellow car come out at night
All the hoes be into it
Remote control starter
That bitch runnin when I get to it
Watch your bitches run until they get to it
And girl there's only one, you ain't gonna get two of it
So ride with a nigga gettin high, sittin 22 inches fly

[Chorus:]
When I'm ridin
I'm high got my drink poured my weed rolled
I creep slow, my bitch on my side and
Wherever that change go this game go
Some talk it they lame tho
The hoes on it, they want it, they say so
Whenever we roll by
So won't you jump your pretty ass in my car in my car
Won't you jump your pretty ass in my car in my car
Won't you jump your pretty ass in my car in my car
Won't you jump your pretty ass in my car in my car girl

[Juicy J:]
I'm smokin on some Taylor shit
Lookin for a festive bitch
Ridin on twenty sixes my pockets never empty
I'm high and always tipsy
Extasy that's plenty
Model chicks, stripper bitch,
I be fuckin many
Every car I paid cash, I don't pay no lease fee
But I get my dick sucked, monica lewenski
Ya'll niggas a toilet bowl, I do all the shitting
Lamborgini, fly doors go on with the
I pop a lot of pills, I pop a lot of seals,
I pop a lot of pussy niggas that are not real
When you see my jewlery game, you gonna get the chills
Inaudible

[Chorus:]
When I'm ridin
I'm high got my drink poured my weed rolled
I creep slow, my bitch on my side and
Wherever that change go this game go
Some talk it they lame tho
The hoes on it, they want it, they say so
Whenever we roll by
So won't you jump your pretty ass in my car in my car
Won't you jump your pretty ass in my car in my car
Won't you jump your pretty ass in my car in my car
Won't you jump your pretty ass in my car in my car girl
