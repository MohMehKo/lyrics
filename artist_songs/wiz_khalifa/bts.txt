My momma ain't raise no fool nigga
Matter of fact, maybe she did
My momma raised a fool (haha)
But that don't mean we can't get rich
Too rich (too rich)
That's what they say

Humble beginnings
Rich ass endings
Pockets on swole
Big ass bingies
Started off losin'
Man it wasn't choosin'
Stuck with my nigga's
Now we all winnin'
Rollin' up paper
Ball like a Laker
Top on the building
I'm high as a 'scraper
What can I say now
Cops know my name now
No time to play round
I'm rich and I'm paid now
Stay on that piece for shit for nigga's that spray rounds
Hear all the talk, they gon' come see you any day now
Try not to fade now
Try to find a way out
Nobodies innocent nigga
Get down or lay down
Made so much money but look how I'd paid out
Don't trust the bank no more so I went and got a safe in my house
Guess all these diamonds on my wrist
What u blinkin' about
It's all my money on my mind when I'm thinkin' about

[Hook:]
Try to be the best that I can
They got the right decisions, handle it like a man
You know I try to do shit with my heart
They talk but I don't listen
I just finish what I start
You know I tried the nigga's that said I can't
They got the right decisions, handle business like a man
You know I try when people say I should change
Sometimes I'm done with trying, I'm just trying to be the same

Nigga's still hating
Critics still weighting
Said that I'd change my ways and start catching these cases
But never said I'd stop counting these faces
Flyin' new places
Buying them cases
Nigga's want problems
I don't entertain it
Cause if it's real problems
It's not entertainment
I'm rollin' a joint up
Precise like a painter
The grind is what made us
The grind is what made us
Now the nigga's that I grew up with lookin' richer
Too much turnin' up
The club owners tryin' to censor
Tatted everywhere  my full body full of scriptures
Pull up in the phantom
Paparazzi takin' pictures
Sellin' so much swag
We should be your swag vender
Big winner in the club, big cash spender
Throwin' signs to my man like he a damn pitcher
Some shit you can't witness
My nigga we been business

[Hook:]
Try to be the best that I can
They got the right decisions, handle business like a man
You know I try to do shit with my heart
They talk but i don't listen
I just finish what I start
You know I tried the nigga's that said I can't
They got the right decisions, handle business like a man
You know I try when people say I should change
Sometimes I'm done with trying, I'm just trying to be the same
