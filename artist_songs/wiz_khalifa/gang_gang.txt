[Chevy Woods:]
I'm rollin' up that motivation
They don't never give me no credit
No alerts turned on my phone
So I ain't get your message
Got these women all in they feelings
Over call backs and all that
Man, tell these hoes that I'm big time
And I'm Mannie Fresh, how you love that
That bank card like uh
Rich nigga, no limit
Top off when it pop off
With her head down, how I'm livin'
Bitch, stay out your feelings
Keep it G and get rich
She came over, that's game over
She here talkin' with Rich
I told life it's gold time
And she bow down 'til it's lit
Cap' just call me on FaceTime
While smokin' joints with your bitch
That's G-A-N-G
Gotta say it two times
20 cents on me
In the party, I got two dimes, for sure

All these hoes in my phone
They be out to get me
Swear I ain't really doin' nothing wrong
I been goin' so damn hard
And I ain't seen it in so long
My legs tired from runnin' game
But I thank God I'm strong
Every day I gotta fight
Cause I'm puttin' on for my fam
100 mil all in my will
Was always in the plan
Hell yeah, that come with it
I sacrifice for the game
Baby girl, she layed up
From countin' dough in my game
Wizzle man, stay gettin' high
Young Veggies doin' the same thing
I ain't sayin' no names
All I know is go bang
All these hoes is insane
But all my bitches go HAM
Fit them girls in the van
Young Veggies the man
Like 10 years, I'm still ridin' round with my
