Dreamer, dreamer
Like a foul I thought
That it could be
Dream on, dream on,
So that someone
Will understand me

What do I say
When I fell to much
I think by now
I'm wasting time
I'm going
Oh, Lord I'm gone
You are the essence
Of my mind

Lord dreamer
I'm a dreamer
Like a foul I thought
That it could be
Dream on, dream on,
Sure that someone
Someone will understand me
