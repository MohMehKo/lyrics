You know you took it
Oh yeah yeah honey
Baby you took it honey
Yes you did
You took a great big piece, piece of my heart
When you, when you said goodbye
Oh you did honey
You know you took it baby
Yes now child
You took it baby, yes you did
You took a great big piece,
Great big chunk of my heart
When you said goodbye

When we were young
Whoa now, we fell in love
Oh baby yeah
I was your girl, yeah
And you were my boy, yes you were now
Ooh baby
Then something happened, honey
I don't know, something, 
Something tore us apart
And, and took a great big piece of my heart
Ohh, that's what you did now, baby
You know you took it honey
Yes you did now
Ooh yeah child you took it baby
Ohh yeah
You took a great big piece, 
A great big chunk of my heart
When you said goodbye
Ah that's what you did now, 
You know you took it baby
Ooh now
Oh you took it honey, yes you did now
Yeah, yeah
You took a great big piece of my heart
When you said, when you said goodbye
Ooh yeah now

I wish you a whole lot of happiness
With your new girl
Guess I have to find myself another, another boy
Yes I will
But this time I wanna know, baby
I got to know now
Right from the start
He won't walk away
Walk away and take my, take my heart
'Cos that's what you did, now
You know, you know you took it baby
Ooh now, everybody knows honey you took it, baby
Yes you did now
Ooh, you took a great big, a great big piece of my heart
When you said goodbye
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah you took it, you took it, you took it honey baby...
