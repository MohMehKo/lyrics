It's not the pale moon that excites me, that thrills and delights me
Oh no, it's just the nearness of you
Isn't your sweet conversation that brings this sensation
Oh no, it's just the nearness of you

When I'm in your arms and I feel you so close to me
All my wondrous dreams come true
I need no soft lights to enchant me if you only grant me the right
To hold you ever so tight and to feel in the night, the nearness of you

I need no soft lights to enchant me if you will only grant me the right
To hold you ever so tight and to feel in the night, the nearness of you
