[James & Fuqua]
Cry, cryin' shame, shame
Cry, cryin' shame, yeah

[James]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You said you didn't wanna love nobody else
If you wasn't lovin' me, whoa baby
Yeah, don't you know you did me wrong, yeah
You kissed and she let you hold her
No tellin' what you might've told her
But we're through

[James & Fuqua]
Cry, cryin' shame, shame
Cry, cryin' shame, yeah

[Fuqua]
Well, you said you didn't wanna talk to nobody
Unless you was a-talkin' to me, but whoa, ooh yeah
You're talkin' to everybody you see right now, mmm
You smiled and you started winkin'
And I know just what you were thinkin'
Now we're through

[James & Fuqua]
If you believe in a better world, a destiny
A-turnin' back the hands of time
Baby if our love was meant to be
Oh we'll get together further on down the line
But for now it's a cryin' shame, shame
But for now it's a cryin' shame, yeah

[James]
Yeah, you said you didn't wanna be smackin' on nobody else
If you wasn't kissin' me
But you, you, you, you
You kiss everybody you see
You did it, forget it, admit it, let's quit it
Yeah yeah, we're through

[Fuqua]
You lied, you cheated
And I'm getting so doggone tired of being mistreated
Now we're through

[James & Fuqua]
Cry, cryin' shame, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Cry, cryin' shame, whoo, oh yes mam, now right now
Cry, cryin' shame, cry cry cry cry cry
Cry, cryin' shame
