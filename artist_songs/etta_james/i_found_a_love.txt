I found a love
I found a love
I found a love, baby
That I need, oh yeah

Now listen,
I found, I found a kiss, oh yeah
I just want to tell you I can't, I can't resist
Believe me now
I found, I found a love
Whoa, that I need baby
That I need now, oh yeah
I just want to call him, help me

Yeah, oh oh oh, 
Yeah, yeah, whoa yeah, yeah now, oh now

Now wait a minute,
There's one thing I want to say right here
The way my man walks
He set my soul on fire
Oh, the way he talks to me in the wee hours of the morning
He's my heart's, he's my heart's desire

And if, he'll ever leave me
Let me tell you
I believe that I would die, baby
I would die y'all, oh yeah

Now help me call him now,
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh yeah, yeah, oh yeah 
Oh I can't help it
The way you make me feel right now
