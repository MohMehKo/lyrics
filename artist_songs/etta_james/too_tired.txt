Laid down last night, too tired to wake
Had a chill this morning I was too tired to shake
Got a good poker hand, too tired to win
Can hear my baby knocking, too tired to let him in

And I'm tired, oh, yeah, yeah, I'm tired
I'm all tired, too tired, too tired, too tired for anything

Too tired to walk, too tired to run
Can hear my baby calling, too tired, too tired, too tired
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I regret, too tired, too tired, too tired, too tired for anything

Tired of prosperity, tired of luck
Sitting on a pin, I'm too tired to get up
I'm tired, yeah, yeah, I declare I'm tired
I said I'm tired, too tired, too tired for anything

Too tired, too tired, too tired for
Too tired
Too tired, too tired, too tired, too tired for anything
Anything
