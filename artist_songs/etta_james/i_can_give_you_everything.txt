Silver and gold
They tarnish when they get old
Money and fame
Really don’t mean anything

When you’re riding
In your car
When you ain’t happy where you are
If you need a change of scenery
Just slide on over next to me

I’ve got love enough to cover the world
For a man that only wants one girl
So if to you love means anything
I can give you everything

Sex appeals
But it’s breaking every heart it steals
So come on
Lets go
‘Cause if there’s one thing that I know

Your friends 
They don’t care
When you need them they ain’t ever there

Looks deceive
‘Cause they’ll tell you things you cant believe

I’ve got love enough to cover the world
For a man that only wants one girl
So if to you love means anything
I can give you everything

I can give you everything
So come on, lets go 
Come on, lets go
If love to you means anything

I said I I I I I I 
I can give you everything
Come on
Come on
