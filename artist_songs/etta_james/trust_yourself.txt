I see my sister down on the street
She got blisters burning through the sole of her feet
Working for a man
Who treats her like a piece of meat

I see my brother just looking for a hit
Down in the gutter, swearing to God he gonna quit
Working for a man
Who doesn't care if he dies or lives

If you do what you're told
You better watch who you tellin'
Before you believe you gotta see what they're sellin'
Don't give up your soul to nobody else
If you wanna be free you gotta trust yourself

Hey, trust yourself (trust yourself)
Trust yourself (trust yourself)
I said trust yourself (trust yourself)
Trust yourself

I see my children at the fork of the road
It makes me wonder which way they goin'
Live by mama's word
Or die with a gun in their hand, oh no no no

If you do what you're told
You better watch who does the tellin'
Before you believe you gotta see what they're sellin'
Don't give up your soul to nobody else
If you wanna be free you gotta trust yourself

Trust yourself (trust yourself)
I said trust yourself (trust yourself)
Trust yourself (trust yourself)
I said trust yourself

Sisters... Brothers...
Children... Mother...
People... People...

Well, well now I say
Sisters, brothers, children,
Hold on, oh mothers

If you do what you're told
You better watch who does the tellin'
Before you believe you gotta see what they're sellin'
Don't give up your soul to nobody else
If you wanna be free you gotta trust yourself

Trust yourself (trust yourself)
Trust yourself (trust yourself)
I said trust yourself (trust yourself)
Trust yourself
