I'm talking to all the lovers in the house tonight
Now listen, you know I want you to find out what's wrong
And get it right, or you should leave love alone
Because the love you save, it might be your own

People, I've been misled and I've been afraid
I've been hit in the head, ohh, and left for dead
I've been abused, woah and I've been accused
Been refused a piece of bread

But I ain't never in my life before
Seen so many love affairs go wrong as I do today

I want you to stop, find out what's wrong
Get it right or leave love alone
Because the love you save today
May very well be your own

I've been pushed around, oh yeah, and I've been lost and found
Given the sundown to get out of town
I've been taken outside, oh and I've been brutalized
I had to always be the one to smile and apologize

But I ain't never in my life before
Seen so many love affairs go wrong as I do today

I want you to stop, find out what's wrong
Get it right or leave love alone
Because the love you save today
Might very well be your own
