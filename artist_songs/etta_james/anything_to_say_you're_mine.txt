Oh, oh, I'm so blue
'Cause I'm worried over you
Oh I, I sometimes wonder
Why I never hear from you

You promised to write me
Each and every day
And I haven't heard from you
Since you went away

Oh, oh, I sit by my window pane
Hoping for a letter
One that never came

My heart cries for just one little line
Anything to say you're mine

Oh, oh...

Well I said a prayer
Every night
Hoping, hoping and praying
Someday, someday you'd write

Oh, oh, my heart cries for one little line
Anything to say you're mine
