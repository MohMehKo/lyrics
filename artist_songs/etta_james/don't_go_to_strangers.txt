Build your dreams to the stars above
But when you need someone true to love
Don't go to strangers, darling
Come on to me

Play with fire till your fingers burn
And when there's no place for you to turn
Don't go to strangers, darling
Come on to me

For when you hear a call
To follow your heart
You'll follow your heart, I know
I've been through it all
And I'm an old hand
And I'll understand if you go

So make your mark for your friends to see
But when you need more than company
Don't go to strangers, darling
Come on to me
