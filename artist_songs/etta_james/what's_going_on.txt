Mother, mother
There's too many of you crying
And brother, brother, brother
There's far too many of you dying

You know you've got to find a way
To bring back love here today

Father, father
There's no need to escalate
Listen, war is not the answer
For only love can conquer hate

You know we've got to find a way
To bring back love back here today

Picket lines and picket signs
Don't punish me with brutality
And just talk to me, so you can see
Oh, what's going on, what's going on
What's going on, what's going on

Mother, mother
Every body thinks we're wrong
Oh, who are they to judge us
Just because our hair is long

You know we've got to find a way
To bring back understanding today

You know we've got to find a way
And bring back some love back here today

Picket lines and picket signs
Don't punish me with brutality
And just talk to me, so you can see
Oh, what's going on, what's going on
What's going on, I tell you what's going on

Oh, what's going on, what's going on
What's going on, what's going on

Mother, mother
Father, father
Good God
