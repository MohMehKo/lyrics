Tear a star from out of the sky and the sky feels blue
Tear a petal from a rose and the rose weep too
C'mon and take your heart away from mine and mine will surely break
My life is yours to make, so please keep the spark awake

Would you take the wings from a bird so that they can't fly?
Would you take the ocean's roar and leave just a sigh?
All this your heart won't let you do, this is what I beg of you
No, don't, don't, no, don't take your love from me

Now tell me, now tell me would you
Would you take the wings from a bird so that they can't fly?
Would you take, would you take the ocean's
The ocean's roar and leave just a sigh?
All this your heart won't let you do, this is what I beg of you
No, don't, don't, don't, don't take your love from me

Don't take your love, don't take your love
Don't take your love, don't take your love from me, child
Yeah, don't take your love, don't take it, don't take it, don't take it
Don't take your love, don't take your love, don't take it from me
