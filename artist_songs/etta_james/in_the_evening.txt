In the evening, I say in the evening
Baby, when the sun goes down
Ah, in the evening, baby, when the sun
When the sun goes down

Baby, when the sun goes down
When your good lover is not around
And when the sun goes down

Last night I lay a-sleeping
I was just thinking, I was just thinking, thinking to myself
Last night, last night, I lay a-sleeping
I was just thinking, thinking to myself

Yeah, and uh, how in the world can somebody
Mistreat you for somebody else
Oh, and when the sun, when the sun goes down

Yeah

The sun rises in the east, way in the east
And it sets out, sets out in the west
Ah, and the sun rises, rises in the east
And it sets out, sets out in the west, yeah, yeah

Now listen

And ain't it hard, ain't it hard to tell
Which one, which one will treat you the best
Oh, oh, when the sun goes down
When the sun goes down
