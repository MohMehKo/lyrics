I feel no shame, I'm proud from where I came
I was born and raised in the boondocks, yeah
One thing I know, no matter where I go
I keep my heart and soul down in the boondocks, that's right

And I can feel that muddy water
Running through my vein, yeah
I can hear that lullaby of a midnight train
And it sings to me and sounds so familiar, whoa

I feel no shame, I'm proud from where I came
I was born and raised in the boondocks, yeah, yeah, yeah
One thing I know, no matter where I may go
I kwas born and raised down in the boondocks

I can taste that honeysuckle
And it's still so sweet, yeah, it's so sweet, so sweet
When it grows wild on the banks down at old camp creek
And it calls to me like a warm wind blowing

I feel no shame, I'm proud from where I came
I was born and raised in the boondocks, yeah, yeah, yeah
One thing I know, no matter where I might go
I have my heart and soul in the boondocks

Now listen

It's where I learned about living, whoa yeah
Where I learned about love, alright
It's where I learned about working hard, uh huh
And having a little was just enough

It's where I learned about Jesus, oh yeah
And knowing where I stand, uh huh
You can take it or leave it
This is me, this is who I am

Feel no shame I'm proud from where I am
I was born down in the boondocks, yeah
One thing I know, no matter where I go
Got my heart and soul in the boondocks

Give me a tin roof
A front porch and a gravel, a gravel road
And that's home to me
Feels like home to me, yeah, now

You get a line, I'll get a pole, yeah
We'll go fishing in the craw fish hole
Five-card poker on a Saturday night
Church on Sunday morning, yeah, yeah

I was born and raised
Down in the boondocks
One thing I know, no matter where I may go
My heart and soul in the boondocks

I feel no shame, I'm proud from where I came
I was born and raised in the boondocks, yeah
One thing I know, no matter where I go
I keep my heart and soul down in the boondocks
In the boondocks
