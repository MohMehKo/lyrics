This is a man's world, this is a man's world
But it wouldn't, it wouldn't be nothing
Nothing without a woman or a girl

You see, man made the cars to take us over the road
Man made the trains to carry the heavy load
Man makes the electric lights to take us out of the dark
Man made the boat for the water like Noah made the ark

This is a man's, a man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing
Without a woman, a woman or a girl

Now listen
Man thinks about little bitty baby girls and baby boys
Man makes them happy 'cause man, he makes them toys
And after man has made everything, everything, everything he can
You know that man makes money to buy from other man

But this is a man, a man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing, nothing
Without a woman or a girl

I said, "He's lost, lost in the world of a man, oh yeah"
And he's lost, lost in bitterness
This is a man, this is a man's world, oh yeah
This is a man's world

This is a man, man, a man's world
Oh, but it would be nothing without a woman or girl
I said it would be, it would be nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
Without a woman, nothing without a woman or a girl

This is a man's world, this is a man's, this is a man's world
I know, you know it this is a man`s world

This is a man's, a man's world
But it would be nothing, nothing without a woman or girl
Without a woman or girl
This is, this is, this is a man, a man's world
