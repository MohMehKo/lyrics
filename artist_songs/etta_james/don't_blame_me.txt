Don't, don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell, how can I help it?
Don't blame me

Can't you see when you do the things you do?
If I can't conceal the thrill that I feel
Don't blame me

I can't help it if that doggoned moon up above
Makes, makes me need something like you to love

Blame your kiss, strange as a kiss could be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me
