When you wake up
In the morning and you wonder
Why no one's beside you where I usually lay
And you think you hear
The sound of a distant thunder
It's just your old rock rolling away

I was your rock standing strong for you
There was nothing I wouldn't do
No matter the cost I was ready to pay
Now you say I'm only holding you down
Like some old rock you've been dragging around
Yes, I'm your rock but I'm rolling away

I'm rolling away on a downhill grade
But I'm coming to rest side
A mountain of love some day
'Cause I finally understand
If you're resting on shifting sands
Even a rock goes rolling away

And I was your rock standing strong for you
There was nothing I wouldn't do
No matter the cost I was ready to pay
Oh now you say I'm only holding you down
Like some old rock you've been dragging around
Yes, I'm your rock and I'm rolling away
