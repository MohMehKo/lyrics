Along from night to night 
You'll find me
To weak to break the chains
That bind me
I need no shackles
To remind me
That I'm just a prisoner of Love
For one command
I stand and wait now
From one who's master
Of my fate now
I can't escape
For it's to late now
That I'm just a prisoner of love

What's so good of my caring
When someone is sharing
These arm's, with me
Although he has another
I can't have another 
For I'm..., I'm not free

He's in my dreams
awake or sleeping, ummm
Up on my knees 
To him I'm creeping, oh yeah,yeah...
My very soul is in his keeping

I'm....just a prisoner....of love
