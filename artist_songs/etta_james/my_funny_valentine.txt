My funny Valentine
Sweet, comic Valentine
You make me smile with my heart
Your looks are laughable
Unphotographable
Yet you're my favorite work of art

Is your figure less than Greek?
Is your mouth a little weak?
When you open it to speak
Are you smart?

Don't change a hair for me
Not if you care for me
Stay little Valentine, stay
And each day will be Valentine's Day

Is your figure less than Greek?
Is your mouth a little weak?
When you open it to speak
Are you smart?

Don't, please don't change a hair for me
Not if, not if you care for me
Stay little valentine, stay
And each day will be Valentine's
Every day will be, every day will be Valentine's Day
