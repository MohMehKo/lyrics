I'm on some ole Mr. Crab shit, yo I like money
Fuck stressing everytime I buy something
They say money can't buy me love
But it sure as fuck 
Can buy me this here matte black Subaru 
And these golden teeth
And these first class tickets to the overseas
Got the cash in my hand about to let go
Straight steal a little, Ninjaâ€™s out to get dough
I can change your whole life on the count of three
That's right homeboy if you down wif me
You can relax and motherfuckin' show the blaze
Tell me your problem, I can make it go away
Play to win, don't play to lose, I paid my dues
Now is time to pay the troops
General! holing with his fucking crazy kit
Vases are'spit!
All up in your face 'n shit!

No shit! Life is a bitch
Spend your whole fucking life tryin to get rich
Everybody used to wonder why I was so tense
You know the deal, dummy, no money - no friends
All I ever wanted was a little action
Especially back in the day when I didn't have shit
Feelin' like shit, gettin treated like shit
Now I'm changing to be dis evil bastard 
Life's a bitch, fucks with your head
I'm a man need to get treated wif respect
But I'm getting bullshit, I'm trying to calm my temper
When I do good no one remembers
When I do bad no one forgets
So go all out when you live on the edge
Made myself rich cause I'm too proud to beg
Haters gonna try hard to get this hook out their head

1 for the money 2 for the Ninja
This unlimited supply of fine ass bitches
They keep flashing their boobs at me all the time
Flee for the weed cause I wanna get high
Throw your fucking guns in the sky
Ninja I ain't the motherfucking place to be
I'm a playboy but don't play wif me
I make you beat gangsta moves like the ANC
But Ninja's a most cooler ruler than Zuma
Ninja's a most meaner leader than Malema
Fuck a racist makin' the same mistake all over again
Black Eugene terror Blondes
So fuckin wipe da look off your face
That's rou, Ninja gonna laugh in your face when you fall
Yeah, whatever!
On the fuckin' street I speak Zipela OSSS!
Fuck the ANC - Viva Mandela
