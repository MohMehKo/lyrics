Never Le Nkemise [You Can't Stop Me]

Le ka zama mara never leloke [You can try but you won't survive]

I'm indestructible, gangster number one
Play now, cry later
The harder they come, the harder they fall (hosh [salute])
You can't stop me
You can try, but you won't survive
Cause I'm a motherfuckin' ninja

Zef Side Represent, you're fuckin' with the best

Ninja
Die wit kaffir [The white nigger]
Ja julle naaiers, skrik wakker [Yes you fuckers, wake up!]
Tension, tension, t-t-t-tension

Looks like I'm gonna need my
matt black glock nine millimeter
Every day's like bulletproof vest time
When you're rollin' through the motherfuckin' Zef Side
And now we don't stop at the robots*
In the day look around three-sixty degrees
Like you're bustin' a motherfuckin' doughnut
I'm not even trusting a roadblock
Our pigs bust caps in the back of your head
Bang, now you're dead
What you gonna do, huh?
Maybe go run tell Zuma?
He doesn't give a fuck
That's why we keep it motherfuckin' gangsta
I'm not scared of you
But you motherfuckin' scared of me
Yeah, the Ninja has become the enemy

I'm indestructible, gangster number one
Play now, cry later
The harder they come, the harder they fall (hosh [salute])
You can't stop me
You can try, but you won't survive
Cause I'm a motherfuckin' ninja

If you don't like funerals, don't kick sand in a Ninja's face...
