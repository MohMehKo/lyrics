[Max:] Come sit down. Come sit here, right here on my lap.

[Yo-landi:] Uh..okay..uh..well.

[Max:] There you go. You want some herbal tea?

[Yo-landi:] Uh, no thanks.

[Max:] You sure?

[Yo-landi:] I'm fine. Thanks.

[Max:] Oh, Yolandi, look at you. You're so cute and squishy, look at your little cheeky weekys you're so cute. I just want to keep you here in my office as my little pet; feed you, bathe you, comb your pretty hair. You don't have to do anything you don't want to do, you hear me Yolandi?

[Yo-landi:] Mhmm

[Max:] Yeah, don't let anyone around here fuck you around.

[Yo-landi:] Kay.

[Max:] You need anything, you hear me, if you need anything, come here to my office, sit right here on my lap and tell Uncle Jimmy what you need. You got that?

[Yo-landi:] Yes, Jimmy.

[Max:] No, call me Uncle Jimmy.

[Yo-landi:] Yes, Uncle Jimmy.
