There once was a little girl
Who had a crush on a bad, bad boy
But when that bad boy got out of prison
That little girl's ass was in big, big trouble!

Daai bra anies hy's n fokken gam bra 
Haai! daai anies hy lam innie mang ja

Anies chills in jail

Throw dem devilish gang signz in da air 
Start giving it up 4 little evil me
My fingerz r green coz I'm a mean dope fiend
I'm wicked like mad d.o.g
Fresh like a little dark g.o.d
Yo-landi vi$$er got da hypest flow
Start talking in tongues whenever I get stoned
Mudafuckn mindz get blown
Every time I rap in2 da microphone
My zef accent iz very foreign 
When I speak overseaz dey go: I beg your pardon?
U can't get me like eric cartman
Naughty little kitty go meow

Jas little devil make your dick go wow
Chea boy! yo-landi vi$$er is hot stuff

Spark mosh-pit shit coz I rhyme so hype

I go punch! kick! bite! fight!
I'm kray-kray like o.d.b.
