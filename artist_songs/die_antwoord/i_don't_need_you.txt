I'm a playa 
Folding paper 
From the golden acre 
To the over seas 
Move over please 
The over taker 
Hot boude shaker 
The fucking answer 
The fucking last year 
Dit was lekker maar dis nou klaar 
You got your pat on the back but you cant fuck with the rising talent of rap 

Don't speak to me 
Did somebody say something 
With the bass pumping 
The place jumping 

I don't need you 
I don't need you 
You're like see through 
I don't see you 

I don't need you 
I don't need you 
You're like see through 
I don't see you 

Butt 
Fuck all 
Exactly 
Yeah your nasty 
Yeah I'm nasty 
I've got the ice cream 
Cherry Yoghurt 
Yeah you know it 
You want a lick of my ice cream 
I'm a lucky ducky 
I think your sucky fucky 
Don't speak to me 

Don't speak to me 
Did somebody say something 
With the bass pumping 
The place jumping 

I don't need you 
I don't need you 
You're like see through 
I don't see you 

I don't need you 
I don't need you 
You're like see through 
I don't see you
