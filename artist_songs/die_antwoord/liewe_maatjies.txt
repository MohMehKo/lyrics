Uh this is it
A whole lot of blood, sweat and tears
But it paid off, I finally made it
Here I am
Living the dream...

Relax your shoulders
Skud jou modder fokken boude
Grab your phone take a picture
When you see Yo-Landi Vi$$er and the NINJA
Life's tough, hard times can kill...
Sometimes I grab the microphone and go ballistig
Sometimes I grab the mic and skop it like a chill.
This one's goin out to all my gangsters
Dik getinte vensters
Kwaai spoilers
Gedropte suspensions
Spiff rims en kak gevaarlike engines
All I wanna do is zoom zoom zoom
Met 'n poes every doem doem doem
Die Antwoord's n mindfuck soos die fokken Matrix
Have goose bumps from the base kicks

Hello al my liewe maatjies
al my gangsters, al my lighties
Hello al my liewe maatjies
all my blacks, all my coloureds, all my whities.
(I see the clouds get so deep
Die motherfucking antwoord het jou lief)

What's up bru I got the good stuff?
I can get you hooked up
My lullaby's float like a butterfly
Sting like a poesklap
There's a heavy calm in the middle of my storm
Geen fokken skaam, skrik vir niks soos die fokken son
Dik fokken gees
Die Ninja moves free
From the Zef side to the overseas
Skop ek kak gevaarlike poetry
this world is dark, but light reveals the shape of things at night.
