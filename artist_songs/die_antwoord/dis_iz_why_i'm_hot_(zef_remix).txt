Yo, uh, check me out yo
This is why I'm hot
I don't give a fack
Yo, I kick a rap over someone else's track
I represent South Africa, I put it on the map 

[Yo-Landi:]
South Africa? Man I heard that place is fuckin' whack

[Ninja:]
When you say South Africa the first things that come to mind
Is, yup, racism apartheid and crime
Fuck a racist, motherfuckers is stuck in '89
But the crime's still wildin' - word to my 9

[Yo-Landi:]
This is why I'm hot
I don't have a job
I just make up raps then I learn them off by heart
Now I'm blowin' up, yes! why? 
Cause I rhyme tight 
Yo my flow is hot just like the guy from twilight
I can't believe that Kristen went and had a fling, yo
Now Robert is single and ready to mingle
I'm hot cause my lingo on the mic is ZEF
Spelt Z to the E to the muddafuckin' F

[Both:]
This is why I'm hot, this is why I'm hot
This is why - this is why - this is why I'm hot
This is why I'm hot, this is why I'm hot
This is why - this is why - this is why I'm hot
I'm hot because I'm ZEF, you ain't because you not
This is why - this is why - this is why I'm hot
I'm hot because I'm ZEF, you ain't because you not
This is why - this is why - this is why I'm hot motherfuckers
