We live the life we love

We love the life we live
We live the life we love
We love the life we live
Don't need no one fuckin up my shit!

Okay, bitch! Get the fuck off me!
I freak you the fuck out
Cause I choose to be free
Fuck your rules! Who are you to tell me
What I can and can't do?
Fuck you bitch you just wanna be me!

I party properly
Nobody fuck with me
Wear what the fuck I like in the streets
Rock pajamas like a G
You're not the boss of me!
Rock em I got no apology
Neil says that I'm a anomaly
[NINJA:] I get money for free
That shit just come to me
People get lost in, and try basking
in my mystic company
I spit heavenly shit, don't need no bitch tellin me shit
If a bitch try n fuck with me
That bitch better be fit

[Y:] We live the life we love

Our zef rights get sued

La di da di, yo we party 
Till the cops go woo!
People think I'm interesting
Cuz I have fun n do my own thing
I don't smile, I snarl for da camera
Golden tooth go shing

[N:]
Some people think I'm insane
Or they think I'm in pain
This is my resting bitch face
There's nothing wrong, okay?

We try our best we don't give up
I'm African and I'm proud
And this is how we get down!

Love is dark
Love sucks when you got a broken heart
Love is weird
Love ain't smart
Love can fix a broken heart
Make it glow in the dark
