[Intro:]
1, 2, ratties comin’ for you
3, 4, better lock your door
5, 6, grab your crucifix
7, 8, gonna stay up late

Muggsy!
Estevan
Success
Angel baby
Die fucking Antwoord
From SA to LA

[Chorus x2:]
Caught up in this fucking rat trap (666)
First the front then the backstab
Keep trying to fuck me
Now look you make me change to be ugly

[Verse 1 - NINJA:]
Used to be my homie
Then you switched like a fucking snitch!
Back when we’s were homies
You told me you and me should both fuck this bitch
Switched clique, hook up with the naff clits
Coulda hanged with my raw clique
Then when you see me shit spastic
Homegirl told me that you got a small dick
Then this dwankie model bitch claimed I hit on her
You wish bitch, you ain’t all that
The only time that I hit on you
Is with the motherfucking baseball bat
Got no pussy posse up on my shit
Self made motherfucker, I’m rich
Cause I’ve spit the illest shit you ever heard in your life bitch!

[Chorus x2:]
Caught up in this fucking rat trap (666)
First the front then the backstab
Keep trying to fuck me
Now look you make me change to be ugly

[Verse 2 - YOLANDI/NINJA:]
You used to be my favourite
Back then didn’t know you was a fake bitch
You couldn't try to apologise later, just save it
You were hit and miss, motherfucking face it
Yo-lan-di’s an anomaly
Told you, you don’t wanna fuck with me
If you don’t like my shit unfollow me
I still believe in my dreams yo you knowwhatimean?
Caught up in this fucking rat trap (666)
First the front then that backstab
You dwankie right hand bitch got no flavour
Looking at me like a fucking screensaver
Uh, and you big fucking fat left hand bitch
She bit off more than she could fucking manage
Boy you stuck in the middle getting damaged
By sif soggy wack bitch sandwich!

[Bridge:]
Me, I tell it like it is
Mamma said baby you should never tell a fib
You think you the fucking shit
Not a friend, you got no idea who you’re fucking with
Me, I tell it like it is
Mamma said baby you should never tell a fib
You think you the fucking shit
Motherfuckers got no idea who they fucking with

[Verse  - NINJA/YOLANDI:]
Ninjas pure evil
Ninja diss stupid fucking people
Ninjas fucking famous
Back home my face always in the papers
National embarrassment
South Africa’s worst nightmare
Omnipresent motherfucking zef god
Everywhere you look I’m right there (boo!)
I started this motherfucking zef shit
Yolandi Vi$$er always on that next shit
I’m a fucking rat not a copy cat
These happy cats take my style and molest it
Versace, yo they love on my shit
Self made motherfucker I’m rich!
Cause I spit the illest shit you ever heard in your life bitch!

[Chorus x2:]
Caught up in this fucking rat trap (666)
First the front then the backstab
Keep trying to fuck me
Now look you make me change to be ugly

[Bridge:]
Me, I tell it like it is
Mamma said baby you should never tell a fib
You think you the fucking shit
Not a friend, you got no idea who you’re fucking with
Me, I tell it like it is
Mamma said baby you should never tell a fib
You think you the fucking shit
Motherfuckers got no idea who they fucking with
