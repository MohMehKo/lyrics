Oh, shame
Is it difficult?
If you got something to say
Say it to my face
Don’t be a little bitch and put up a front
Did you really think you could fuck with the evilest rap girl in the whole planet
And get away with it?
Oh, shame
No it doesn’t work like that
What a little delusional asshole
You’re so fucking stupid
I see right through you
I can see you scared
And a scared man is not a pretty sight
Oh, shame
Run little scaredy cat
Run
