I miss you; baby love, I'ma see you soon (Fuck it, I've been so busy; spinning 'round in a whirlwind)
Could you just come here?.. I just wanna be with you (I'm on a mission, but I'm missing my little girlfriend)
It's cool, you gotta do what you gotta do (I'm gonna be there soon; yea baby, tell me what you want to do)
Smoke a fat blunt, and snuggle up beside of you (Oh mother-fuck, there's nothing in the world that I would rather do)
Zef Gang God of the world; I'm a busy girl
Listen up baby, we're not good at home
Calling up the green for some medicinal
Weed-fucked, going out; I wanna be invisible
Pop a fat blunt in your mouth; there we go
We here chillin' like a villain, feeling all..

[Hook:]
Dazed and confused..
So cute and paranoid
Dazed and confused..[x2]
So, dazed and confused..
So cute and paranoid
Dazed and confused..[x2]
So, dazed and confused..
So cute and paranoid

[Ninja:]
A-ayyye..
I'm gonna fuck things on you; I've been working out all day
Taking it to the next level; I've been stepping up my game
Masked murderer; Ninja, he don't play,
Got no time for a fuckboy; Yo, I'll put him in his grave
We pretty hot; we make it rock
So, now I'ma take a break,
And go visit my baby love
Let's take a break; let's get away,
Fuck it, I think Ninja deserves a little holiday
You, me; top on a plane,
I know when with you; girl, it's gonna be insane
You ask your friends if they wanna go,
Tell them I got it covered; I be making fuckin' dough
Shrooms, booms fall in the zone
Chillin' like a villain; dip in the Caribbean
Sippin' champagne, smokin' mad weed all daaay.. every day!!!..

Just keep doing what you doing; baby, kill them all (Soon I'll be energy, then, like a villain; feeling all..)
