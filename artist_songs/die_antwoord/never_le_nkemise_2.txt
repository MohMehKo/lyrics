South Africa - 2012
We in the future now
Just because the whole world's gone dwanky
Doesn't mean we fuckin' gonna go out like that too

Fuck the system
We have our own system
We make our own rules
We don't answer to no one

That's right
We keep it gangsta
We keep it Zef

[Yolandi:]
We keep it pumping off it's motherfucking face!

Yo, DJ Hi-Tek

Never le nkemise [x3]
Le ka zama mara never leloke
