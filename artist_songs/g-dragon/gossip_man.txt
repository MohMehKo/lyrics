Emergency emergency emergency emergency

[Chorus]
Hey man, what is today’s gossip
I can’t be quiet for even a day, why, why me
Everybody attention please I am gossip man

Ladies and gentlemen ho, they call me gossip man, you know
You know, everyone knows, actually, it’s not
Today at a cafe, to a girl she said she got hit in the face with water
Yesterday at a street, to some guy, said she kicked him with her feet
Who, me? No, lie
My rumor is asexual, the many eyes are too scary
Now, this much is funny, in the past, I cried a lot
All the more, the mouths swelled even more
The thoughts longer, the words lessened
The world cried at my life
Because you’re cool – yes I am cool cool
I also enjoy it, yeah could be fun
Yeah in this boring world, if one of me makes it more joyful
Say Superman, Batman, like XO gossip man

[Chorus]

At school, at the office, at work, even at home
VCD radio MP3 hot news magazine too
I'm waiting for something in a boring life
Now, the story prepared for today is coming
Today, the reporters pen will catch fire
Do you see the search engine ranking
Many netizens fingers are getting tired
The situation is more serious, our world is a hot pot
If you blink your eye, it should cool down
You hand, do your thang, conduct zero, do my thang
Because you’re cool – yes I'm cool cool
I also enjoy it, yeah could be fun
Yeah in this world where its hard to live, if one of me comforts you
Say Superman, Batman, like XO gossip man

[Chorus]

Why do you have so many words
What exactly are you so curious about
Your own world, unnecessary controversy
Don't be concerned and get up, go on, let him go

[Chorus]
