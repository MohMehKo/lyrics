[English:]

Your lips and your scent, I love it
Your long legs and short skirt, I love it

You see that? My eyes go to that butt (I love it)
Without knowing, my hands go to your waist (ooh I like it)
Your thin ankles are in high heels all day baby
Could you be my lady (cuz I know you want it)

This is a club or a bar, sky lounge, sky high
Not casual but dress up more
Don’t stop and keep going
Rose, Dom P, with a cigar
Are you turned on? If you’re not, never mind
Party like Met Gala
The way we party is different

Your eyes and the way you talk, I love it
Your long hair and your beauty mark on your nose, I love it

You see that? My eyes go to that butt (I love it)
Without knowing, my hands go to your waist (ooh I like it)
Your thin ankles are in high heels all day baby
Could you be my lady (cuz I know you want it)

It’s not important what time it is or where we are
Don’t ask me who I am or what I do, girl
Just enjoy the moment and go home later
And keep this a secret between us

Your black stockings (I love it)
Your red lipstick (I love it)
Your sexy smile (I love it)
Everything about you (I love it)

Her lips and scent, I love it
Your long legs and short skirt, I love it

Where did you come from?
Why did you appear now?
How can you be so perfect?
I’m always in awe when I see you
Is it too bright? I’ll turn down the lights
Look carefully so I can show you my moves
Rather than the fairy and woodsman, it’s the lady and playboy

Your eyes and the way you talk, I love it
Your long hair and your beauty mark on your nose, I love it

It’s not important what time it is or where we are
Don’t ask me who I am or what I do, girl
Just enjoy the moment and go home later
And keep this a secret between us

Yeah
Gotta love it

I love it
