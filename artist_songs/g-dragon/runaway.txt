[English:]

As soon as I wake up, my phone is filled with missed calls
At this time, it has to be you, you follow me without rest
When the phone rings again, I turn it off and break it
I’m running away but there’s no time

Baby I’m trippin, I’m sorry, it’s not that I don’t like you
(But everything about you makes me feel somewhat pressured)
You say that this is love but not me
I don’t need you, I don’t love you
Every night, sometimes I get lonely and miss you but that’s really sometimes
Don’t ask if we’re gonna date again, I like it better without you

Yahoo, I wanna run away
Yahoo, baby, please let me go
Yahoo, hurry, run away, oh my god
Yahoo yahoo

It’s already been a few months since I’ve been dating a new girl
But I get so nervous whenever I go outside
It feels like someone is following me
Oh this strange scent, baby just let me go

Baby I’m trippin, I’m sorry, it’s not that I don’t like you
(But that obsession is somewhat really scary)
You say that this is love but not me
I don’t need you, I don’t love you
Every night, sometimes I get lonely and miss you but that’s really sometimes
I hear your voice in my dreams, I am in misery, I was crazy

Oh oh oh oh oh oh I wanna runaway
Oh oh oh oh oh oh, as far away from you as possible
On a fast car, with fast wings, to a place without you, here we go

Yahoo, I wanna run away
Yahoo, baby, please let me go
Yahoo, hurry, run away, oh my god
Yahoo yahoo

Yahoo, I wanna run away
Yahoo, baby, please let me go
Yahoo, hurry, run away, oh my god
Yahoo yahoo
