[English:]

The revolution will not be televised
The revolution is in your mind
The revolution is here

This is my Coup D’e Tat
Boomerang going from mouth to mouth
Hand’s up get high
The song starts I’m the tagger

Hid more tightly, I can see your hair
I’m a new boiler in your dad’s house
Yeah this is a spoiler
I’m so fly
I’m scary F-Killer
Gorilla that steals girls’ hearts
Bang bang bang
I earn money with my teeth
With my one song
You can get robbed at the company
In this GAME I am the hood to the winker
You are lo to the ser
You’ll never know
FAME

This is my Coup D’e Tat
Boomerang going from mouth to mouth
Hand’s up get high
The song starts I’m the tagger

If time is money I’m so poor
1 year, 365 days, Hong Kildong, god’s grace
My phone keeps on ringing
Like a new born child
My phone keeps on barking
Like that dog next door
Bow wow wow yeppie
yo yeppieye
I’m the best at self-admiration and being cocky
I’m shameless
I’m so fresh so clean
I compete with the laundry house
And my flow so sick
Keeps on going to the intensive care unit
WHAT

This is my Coup D’e Tat
Boomerang going from mouth to mouth
Hand’s up get high
The song starts I’m the tagger

Head shoulder knees and toes
swag check mic check
one two three four
I’m Pacman who eats MC
Head shoulder knees and toes
swag check mic check
one two three four
This is a gospel AMEN
Ay you want some
you want some more It’s not enough
Ay give me some
Give me some more alright y’all

This is my Coup D’e Tat
Boomerang going from mouth to mouth
Hand’s up get high
The song starts I’m the tagger

This is my Coup D’e Tat
Boomerang going from mouth to mouth
Hand’s up get high
The song starts I’m the tagger
