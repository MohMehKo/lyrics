I - CAN'T - BREATHE

[Korean (한국어)]

I can't breathe
I can't breathe
I can't breathe (no more) YEAH

I can't breathe no more
I can't sleep no more
어지러운 세상에 차가운 도심속에 나 홀로

I can't live no more but
I can't stop no more
눈을 감아도 이젠 들리지 않는 너의 그 숨결

I can't deny 고요히 잠든밤
그 속에 나타난 넌 너무나 아름다워

Hey gorgeous sweet amazing baby
I know you want it baby
이시간만큼은 You and me hardcore
'Till you say no more

I can't breathe
I can't breathe
나를 조여오는 느낌이 싫지 않아

I can't breathe
I can't breathe
아침이 밝아와도 난 깨고 싶지않아
I can't breathe

상상은 질렸어
난 절제를 잃었어
모순된 상황 변함없는 건
넌 나의 V-V-Venus
달나라 건너 별 다음엔 해 저물어
지금 이 순간만을 기다려 온 걸 I wonder

I can't deny 고요히 잠든밤
그 속에 나타나는 너무나 아름다워
(Come on and do it and screw it baby)
I know you want it baby
이시간만큼은 You and me hardcore
Let's do it some more

I can't breathe
I can't breathe
나를 조여오는 느낌이 싫지 않아

I can't breathe

아침이 밝아와도 난 깨고싶지않아

I can't breathe

나를 조여오는 느낌이 싫지 않아

I can't breathe

아침이 밝아와도 난 깨고싶지않아

가려진 커튼 사이로 oh oh oh oh
날 부르는 그대의 손길 이 이 이
살며시 내 침대로 와 ah ah ah ah ah
아무도 모르게 조용히 히 히 히

I can't breathe

나를 조여오는 느낌이 싫지 않아
