[Chorus]
Eh oh eh oh in the eh oh eh oh why why, leave me alone
Eh eh eh~ how is it how is it
I’m going to do it my way

Double eight born neither yo GD still on the big yo
Kinda shy, a soul man that’s me big bang GD one
To all the young people, this world is yours
Put your mother fucking hands up
Rather than getting ruined, a mutual understanding of the leader
1 2 step and turn left to the right below shut
Ladies and gentlemen, crazy guys do whatever you say you know
I’m captain G-Sparrow, everybody just follow me now

[Chorus]

The difference of flattery and the gene of being envious feel me
My melody lifts your heart, my age is ten three we were young
The mic was my heart’s everything, knowing the dream keep it on
Keep running, the earth changed it’s territory
I got got you boy tell me about it no doubt
Mother back girl, instead of explaining, showing is a better method
1 2 step and turn left to the right below shut
Ladies and gentlemen, I’m singing you singing
Hiphop and R’n'B grab on to anything

[Chorus]

Dream big even if it’s small, behind me you’re contaminated
My voice is lethal fine us, you became thin
On the stage I’m the hero, can’t stop now
Taeyang like a shining star, G-Dragon raise the roof roof

[Chorus x2]

Like there’s something different about us (What to do)
Don’t want to do it like other people (Like that)
Want to put on wings and fly like an airplane
We are the korean dream
