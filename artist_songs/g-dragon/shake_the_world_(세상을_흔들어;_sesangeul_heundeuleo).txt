[English:]

Shake the world, shake the world
Shake the world, shake the world

I’m back, the master of the kingdom
Zoom in your ears, the high-handed G.D.R.A.G.O.N
My rap is a harpoon, a piercing iron bar, a word massacre, killing it since the beginning

Everyday my birthday, everyone is like a swarm of bees
We dance, we sing, all day, we all day
Shut up and follow me, throw a fit like you’re crazy, you and I have become one, it’s on
Since I was born

Shake the world, shake the world, the fakers will come out, the real ones are different
Shake the world, shake the world, when you see me, you’ll know it’s the answer
Since I was born
Shake the world, shake the world, since I was born
Shake the world, shake the world, since I was, since I was, since I was born

I’m back, the master of the kingdom

We come from different places but our roots are arariyo
We come from different places but our roots are arariyo
This is just k-pop, what’s the big fuss about mainstream?
Hold up, hold up, hold up
Music I’ve been making for the past year, all it takes it just one minute of a preview
Stashing it in your cell phone or the recycle bin?
This isn’t musical education, but they ask questions to get answers they want to hear
Just know that music is just music
(Hold up, shut up) However you want, your hand, body, soul, shake it

Everyday my birthday, everyone is like a swarm of bees
We dance, we sing, all day, we all day
Shut up and follow me, throw a fit like you’re crazy, you and I have become one, it’s on
Since I was born

Shake the world, shake the world, the fakers will come out, the real ones are different
Shake the world, shake the world, when you see me, you’ll know it’s the answer
Since I was born
Shake the world, shake the world, since I was born
Shake the world, shake the world, since I was, since I was, since I was born
