Your mamma's sweet
Your daddy's not
If I could give you all I've got
I'd give you more than my one foot out the door

Instead I'm stuck,
With one foot out
My pot of gold,
It just ran out

And I'm looking for pennies on the floor

If you could empty my pockets
You'd find nothing but holes
And an old book of matches 
From you

Don't you bother,
You can't change it
You'd feel charmed,
Then ignored

'Cause I'm looking for pennies on the floor 

[music break]

If you could empty my pockets
You'd find nothing but holes
And and old book of matches
From you

Don't you bother, 
You can't change it
You'd feel charmed, 
Then ignored 

'Cause I'm looking for pennies on the floor

Yes I'm looking for pennies on the floor
