I've been trying to leave but my heart doesn't want to 
Deep inside I know you're no good for me 
What the hell am I trying to hold on to, when I know you 
You're just another picture in a pile of memories 

If you want to go I think it's time for you to leave 
I ain't gonna let you take another piece of me 
Now there ain't much left but my torn up pride 
But if you want to take it 
Oh baby, all that's left is lonely, broke, and wasted. 

I picked you up when you didn't have a prayer 
At the time I just needed someone there 
It was never in my plans to love you, now I do 
What a shame it had to all end up this way 

If you want to go I think it's time for you to leave 
I ain't gonna let you take another piece of me 
Now there ain't much left but my torn up pride 
But if you want to take it 
Oh baby, all that's left is lonely, broken 

I've wasted too much time 
Just hanging on your line 
There's not enough whiskey on my shelf 
To make me think that you're someone else 

Now there ain't much left but my torn up pride 
But if you want to take it 
Oh baby all that's left is lonely, broke, and wasted 
Lonely, broke, and wasted
