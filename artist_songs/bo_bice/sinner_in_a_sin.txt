Sometimes it's hard to know
If you're going or if you're gone
So you dodge from right to left
Never knowing which way is wrong, no

Holding strong to all you know
Slipping faster to your fall

Like a sinner in a sin
Loser that never wins
I'm a poet without a pen
I've always been and I'd do it again

Gonna paint the town tonight
Use colors green and amber
Like a painter without a brush
Whose colors fill to capture

It's the chaos I understand
And it's the calmness in my rants of anger

Just a sinner in a sin
Loser that never wins
I'm a poet without a pen
And I've always been and I'd do it again

Someday I'm gonna to wake up
And I know that the sun is gonna shine, keeps on shining down
Someday I know the clouds are gonna part
Yes, I know that its rays they will find me

Sinner in a sin
Loser that never wins
Poet without a pen
I've always been and I'd do it again

Oh, I'm a sinner in a sin
A loser that never wins
A poet without a pen
I've always been and I'd do it again
