I'm a lone wolf in a cage
Lost my partner to a lie
Like a bird with broken wings, yeah
It's impossible to fly
I tried to live for two
But only trust in one
Is there nothing that we can do?
Are we truly done?
Every day we do or die
As we're sailin' across the sky
Now we're comin' home
On these blades of glory
Settin' fire to the ice
Is the dream that keeps us alive
Now we're comin' home
On these blades of glory
Could this be the end
of our mythic story?
I don't know what to say
I don't know where to turn
All I know is if I stay
Ooh this ice it sure can burn
A man who's scared of truth
Can only trust in lies
A boy who's scared to dream
Can never touch the sky, oh yeah
Every day we do or die
As we're sailin' across the sky
Now we're comin' home
On these blades of glory
Settin' fire to the ice
Is the dream that keeps us alive
Now we're comin' home
On these blades of glory
Today is the first chapter
Of our mythic story
We'll never part
On these blades of glory
And we'll cross our hearts
On these blades of glory
What do you say
Tonight we celebrate
By going out our way, yeah
O-oo-oh, let's go all the way, yeah
It's our calling
Every day we do or die
As we're sailin' across the sky
Now we're comin' home
On these blades of glory
Settin' fire to the ice
Is the dream that keeps us alive
Now we're comin' home
On these blades of glory
Blades of glory
We'll go all night
'Til we finish the story
Now we're comin' home
On these blades of glory
The dream is alive
And we'll never be sorry
Now we're comin' home
On these blades of glory
[Repeat to end]
