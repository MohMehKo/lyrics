This train is comin' down the track and I hear it callin' my name
I got a dollar in my pocket and I'm hopin' that I can make it on okay
All the years of countin' on nothin' at least it's on my mind
If I can make it on this time then I'll take it on down the line

[CHORUS:]
Well now this train is comin' down my way
This train is gonna make it okay
This train is runnin' down full speed
This train is comin' down for me

At the station with my bottle and a Bible and I'm waitin' on a Northbound train
God's willin' and I'm hopeful that he's happy 'cause I know that I'm feelin' no pain
All the years of countin' on nothin' went by in a blink of an eye
Years of fear and blissful tears, you learn to crash before you fly

[CHORUS x2]
