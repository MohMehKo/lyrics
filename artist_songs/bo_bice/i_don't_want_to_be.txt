I Don't Need To Be Anything Other
Than A Prison Guard's Son
I Don't Need To Be Anything Other
Than A Specialist's Son
I Don't Have To Be Anyone Other
Than The Birth Of Two Souls In One
Part Of Where I'm Going, Is Knowing Where I'm Coming From
I Don't Want To Be
Anything Other Than What I've Been Trying To Be Lately
All I Have To Do
Is Think Of Me And I Have Peace Of Mind
I'm Tired Of Looking 'round Rooms
Wondering What I've Got To Do
Or Who I'm Supposed To Be
I Don't Want To Be Anything Other Than Me
I'm Surrounded By Liars Everywhere I Turn
I'm Surrounded By Imposters Everywhere I Turn
I'm Surrounded By Identity Crisis Everywhere I Turn
Am I The Only Who Noticed?
I Can't Be The Only Who's Learned
I Don't Want To Be
Anything Other Than What I've Been Trying To Be Lately
All I Have To Do
Is Think Of Me And I Have Peace Of Mind
I'm Tired Of Looking 'round Rooms
Wondering What I've Got To Do
Or Who I'm Supposed To Be
I Don't Want To Be Anything Other Than Me
Can I Have Your Attention Please?
If You're Not Like This And That, You're Gonna Have To Leave
I Came From The Mountain
The Crust Of Creation
My Whole Situation--Made From Clay To Stone
And Now I'm Telling Everybody
I Don't Want To Be
Anything Other Than What I've Been Trying To Be Lately
All I Have To Do
Is Think Of Me And I Have Peace Of Mind
I'm Tired Of Looking 'round Rooms
Wondering What I've Got To Do
Or Who I'm Supposed To Be
I Don't Want To Be Anything Other Than Me
I Don't Want To Be
