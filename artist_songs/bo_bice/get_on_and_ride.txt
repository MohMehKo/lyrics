Face to face, eye to eye 
You say you love me, then you bleed me dry 
You try to make me like it, you know I can't deny 
You call a spade a spade baby, if it so applies 

Now your heartbeat's ticking in me like a bomb that's ready to blow 
Did you see what you came to see, go ahead enjoy the show 
Take your time if you're so inclined, jump on here with me 
Get on and ride it in the fast lane honey 
Won't you get on and ride, won't you get on and ride it now 

Every day, I walk another mile 
You find me guilty, but don't give me a trial 
If that's the case, baby I don't mind it 
This time around girl, it's your turn to ride yeah 

Now your heartbeat's ticking in me like a bomb that's ready to blow 
Did you see what you came to see, go ahead enjoy the show 
Take your time if you're so inclined, jump on here with me 
Get on and ride it in the fast lane honey, 
Won't you get on and ride it, won't you get on and ride it now 

Get on and ride 
Now show me what you got 

Now your heartbeat's ticking in me like a bomb that's ready to blow 
Did you see what you came to see, go ahead enjoy the show 
I don't mind if you take your time, jump on here with me 
Get on ride it in the fast lane honey, 
Won't you get on and ride it, won't you get on and ride it now 

Now your heartbeat's ticking in me like a bomb that's ready to blow 
Did you see what you came to see, go ahead enjoy the show 
Take your time if you're so inclined, jump on here with me 
Get on ride and it in the fast lane honey, 
Won't you get on and ride it, won't you get on and ride it now
