There's a meeting across the river
Just past the smokescreen in your eyes
Everybody's waitin' to see you deliver
Now's the time to break the tie that binds
Come on down now, from your fences
Come on down to the other side

[CHORUS:]
Broken down in another man's cell
who's gonna be there to pay your bail?
It's hard sometimes to know what is right
Everyday, just another hard time
You should know by now you gotta pay to ride
But that's alright, I finally see the light

Didn't think there'd be a sermon
Don't make no difference, by and by
I can't be bothered by your burden
It's just a matter of time before it dies

[CHORUS]

Just go on about your business
Break out the truth at the light of day
One more thing you should consider
Is how your lies gave you some damn good shade

[CHORUS]
