I got whiskey, women and time
I've been traveling down those thin white lines
About ninety miles behind me now and it's gonna be a good ride
I can't wait to get back out on the road
It's the place that I love every time, baby, don't you know?

Love whiskey, women and time
Traveling thin white lines
Love whiskey, women and time
Traveling thin white lines

'Bout ninety miles outta Vegas, it's gonna be a long trip
There're many a times I've stumbled along the way
There're many a times I've slipped

I keep coming up and coming down
And everything here and in between, Lord, I have
Haven't been asleep in so long
I know that it feels like a dream this time

I love that whiskey, women and time
Traveling thin white lines
Love whiskey, women and time
Traveling thin white lines

Many times when you see me, you know I'm on the go
Headed to another town, yeah, it's time to do another show
Grab a friend if you want, come along, you can join me for the ride
Life should be a journey for your heart, it's in and out like the tide

I got whiskey, women and time
I keep traveling down those thin white lines

'Bout a million miles behind me now, feels like a billion miles
I can't wait to get back home, see my momma
My dad, my brothers and sisters, all the people that I love
Baby, don't you know it's good to be back home again?

I love whiskey, women and time
I love traveling thin white lines
But it's good to be back home again

Whiskey, women and time
Traveling thin white lines
Whiskey, women and time
Traveling thin white lines
