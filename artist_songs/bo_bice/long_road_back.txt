Just like little children fight 
This side's yours and that side's mine 
Nothing more but in between 
Broken hearts and shattered dreams 
We don't all live the same lives, but we all sleep under the same skies 
Now a change is gonna come, I can feel it in the wind today 

It's a long, long road back from nowhere 
We fight like hell sometimes, other days we don't care 
It's a long, long road back from nowhere 
A change is gonna come, I can feel it in the wind today 

Everybody thinks they see, what is wrong with you and me 
When we finally understand, not one man has got the plan 
We don't all live the same lives, but we all sleep under the same skies 
Now a change is gonna come, I can feel it in the wind today 

It's a long, long road back from nowhere 
We fight like hell sometimes, other days we don't care 
It's a long, long road back from nowhere 
A change is gonna come, I can feel it in the wind today 

Asking every child, woman, and man 
To join me here in the promised land 

It's a long, long road back from nowhere 
We fight like hell sometimes, other days we don't care 
It's a long, long road back from nowhere 
A change is gonna come, I can feel it in the wind today
