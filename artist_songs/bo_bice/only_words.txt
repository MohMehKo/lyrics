I don't know how much I can take
Before I reach the point of breaking down again
Just like a candle to the wind
It only burns a short while then it's out again

[Chorus:]
You say it's only words
You say it's only words
But in my heart I know that it's time to go
In my heart I know, yeah

Do I ever cross your mind?
Love is blind they say I still can't find my way
Though I've lost myself at times
In my heart I know you're never too far away

[Chorus]

[Solo]

[Chorus]
