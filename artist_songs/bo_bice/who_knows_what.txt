Tell me who knows what 
Gonna happen today 
Weatherman said that the sun is shining but all I see is pouring rain 
And the preacher keeps saying 
That we're out of time 
If you tune in again next week then they'll tell you everything is fine 
It's hard to know what's going on 
When the right ones get it wrong 
Tell me who knows what 

Who knows what way is up 
How much is too much 
Hard to know sometimes just who to trust 
Who knows what's going on 
How much right they say is wrong 
Tell me who knows what 

Who knows what 
A dollar means today 
You can lay it down on the roll of a dice and you can put your money in the bank 
You spend everything 
To have everything 
Then you sit around, around my friend and watch it going down the drain 
You wake up and its gone 
And you don't know what went wrong 
Tell me who knows what 

Who knows what way is up 
How much is too much 
Hard to know sometimes just who to trust 
Who knows what's going on 
How much right they say is wrong 
Tell me who knows what 

Who knows what way is up 
How much is too much 
Hard to know sometimes just who to trust 
Who knows what's going on 
How much right they say is wrong 
Tell me who knows what 

Tell me who knows what 
Yeah tell me who knows what 

Baby who knows what 
I do know what
