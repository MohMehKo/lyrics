Everyday I find another way
Something more to get me through this life, life, life
You don't believe in what you see
Then tell me baby, does it make you blind, blind, blind?
That ain't the way it is

I need a witness when you talk to me
I need a witness, won't you set me free?
I need a witness when you talk to me
I need a witness baby, now won't you set me free?

All these people travel on, travel on in the road, road, road
Now you tell me how to plant my seed
Then you tell me baby, it won't grow, grow, grow
Now it ain't the way it is

I need a witness when you talk to me
I need a witness, won't you set me free?
I need a witness when you talk to me
Oh, I need a witness baby, now won't you set me free?
Oh, set me free child, c'mon

Oh, yeah, yeah, listen to me people
People die when we don't try, we walk away
Don't you see there's a better way of life?
People die when we don't try, we walk away
Don't you see there's a better way, people pray?

People die when we don't try, we walk away
Don't you see there's a better way of life?
People die when we don't try, we walk away

I need a witness when you talk to me
Yeah, I need a witness baby, won't you set me free, yeah, set me free?
I need a witness, now won't you talk to me?
Oh, I need a witness baby, now won't you set me free?
