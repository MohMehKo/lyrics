I'm gonna give leaving a brand new meaning
Show you how it feels to be alone
I can't find the rhyme within her reason
Guess it's time for me to just move on

I'm gone, I'm gone
(You know I'm gone)
Traveling down this lonely road
(You know I'm gone)
A friend to the wind and the sky's my home
(You know I'm gone)
Traveling down this road yet I'm all alone but I'm gone

Another coffee smoke filled Sunday morning
She's in the other room but not at home
I tried everything to please that woman
Beauty's in the sparkle not the stone

I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone, yeah
(You know I'm gone)
Traveling down this lonely road
(You know I'm gone)
A friend to the wind and the sky's my home
(You know I'm gone)
Traveling down this road yet I'm all alone

I don't worry about tomorrow
I find out a mile on down the road

Yeah, yeah, I'm gone
(You know I'm gone)
Traveling down this lonely road
(You know I'm gone)
A friend to the wind and the sky's my home
(You know I'm gone)
Traveling down this road yet I'm all alone, yeah

(You know I'm gone)
Oh, I'm gone
(You know I'm gone)
A friend to the wind and the sky's my home
(You know I'm gone)
Traveling down this road yet I'm all alone
