Well you've been talkin', talkin' 'bout it
Now you got to leave it behind
You ain't got no cause for conversation
No you ain't gonna stand here in line
Keep a distance with your dirty habits
All these people just letting you by

[Chorus:]
Ain't got money, ain't got time
You're spreading me thin girl
Like a worn thin dime

No you cannot stand and deny
The groove is happenin', and the beat is flowin'
Breathin' right here on time
Sure will miss you, baby as you're leavin'
Hear you whisper as you close the blinds

[Chorus]

[Solo]

Sure will miss you, baby as you're leavin'
Hear you whisper as you close the blinds

[Chorus]
