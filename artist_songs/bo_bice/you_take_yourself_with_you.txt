I hate this town, I can't even count the reasons 
Don't know where I'm bound, all I know is that I'm leaving 
Down a dusty road that's been calling me for years 
Daddy just shook his head, Mama was fighting back the tears 
I said time to go, there aint nothing left but leaving 
When you know you know, you just can't fight that feeling 

You can climb the highest mountain, go where no one's ever gone 
On a crowded city sidewalk, you might find yourself alone 
In the middle of the desert, anywhere the wind blows 
Son you take yourself with you, wherever you go 

Got a taste of the city life, and them rollin' hills 
Man, them LA nights, gave this country boy a thrill 
But I never felt right, like I ever fit in 
So I kept moving on, now it's time to roll again 
When it's time to go, there aint nothing left but leaving 
When you know you know, like the changing of the seasons 

You can climb the highest mountain, go where no one's ever gone 
On a crowded city sidewalk, you might find yourself alone 
In the middle of the desert, anywhere the wind blows 
Son you take yourself with you, wherever you go 

Now I found out the hard way, and I made my own mistakes 
But my Daddy's words were with me every step of the way 

You can climb the highest mountain, go where no one's ever gone 
On a crowded city sidewalk, you might find yourself alone 
In the middle of the desert, anywhere the wind blows 
Son you take yourself with you, wherever you go 
Son you take yourself with you, wherever you go
