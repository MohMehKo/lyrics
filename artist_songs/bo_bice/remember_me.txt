The dawn is close
And sheds its light on me
It makes me feel like what we had was really nothing at all
Now do you care, but am I in this alone
But maybe I am
Oh if I am
Remember me
Remember all the times
All those endless nights
We didn't want to sleep
Remember me
And how I made you laugh
Until I made you cry...
We had everything
But don't you ever forget

So this is love
It feels like agony
I want you here 'cause the thought of you with someone else is hell on earth
I can't breathe
Knowing that you don't believe
In all that we had
So all that I ask
Is remember me
Remember all the times
All those endless nights
We didn't want to sleep
Remember me
And how I made you laugh
Until I made you cry
We had everything
But don't you ever forget
All of the memories are leaving me empty
Oh how I want you here right now
It gets so lonely
I need you to hold me
Everything else just brings me down
Ooohhhhh yeah
Remember me
Remember all the times
All those endless nights
We didn't want to sleep
Oh remember me
And how I made you laugh
Until I made you cry
We had everything, everything
So don't you ever forget
Never never forget
Remember me
