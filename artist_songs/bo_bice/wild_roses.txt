Sweet little country girls, smiling back at me 
Sweet like Iowa corn, in the summertime breeze 
Like to see wildflowers, in the midday sun 
Stretching out like a field of dreams 
Where a southern boy wants to run 

Wild roses, make me feel alright 
Wild roses, dancing in the pale moonlight 
Looking out all around me, what a beautiful sight 
I see a lot of wild roses in here tonight 

I'd like to get tangled, caught up in your thorns 
Feel the pain of leaving, let my heart be torn, 
On a long lost highway, where the moon it shines 
And the hint of sweet perfume 
I'll be thinking of you while the road's unwinding 

Wild roses, make me feel alright 
Wild roses, dancing in the pale moonlight 
Looking out all around me, what a beautiful sight 
I see a lot of wild roses in here tonight 

What really moves me, it always gets to me 
Is how all your beauty is so untamed 

Wild roses, make me feel alright 
Wild roses, dancing in the pale moonlight 
Looking out all around me, what a beautiful sight 
I see a lot of wild roses in here tonight 
I see a lot of wild roses in here tonight
