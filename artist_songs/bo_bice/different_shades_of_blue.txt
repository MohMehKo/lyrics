Sitting in the glare of the neon smoke 
Always mistaken for the light of hope 
Mourning in a lonely woman's eyes 
She's fallen one more time 

Feeling the weight of the morning sky 
I'm running again from another lie 
From gray to midnight I've been through 
Every broken-hearted hue 

You may think I'm lying, but I swear that it's true 
You think hurt only comes in one color 
Have I got news for you 
I've seen it all, in different shades of blue 

Faded photo of a house for sale 
Cold dark pewter of a casket rail 
There's not too much these eyes ain't seen 
Between the yellow and the green 

You may think I'm lying, but I swear that it's true 
You think hurt only comes in one color 
Have I got news for you 
I've seen it all, in different shades of blue 

Every time we fell in love, breaking down and making up 
The azure of a new sunrise, the shadow of a moonlit night 
Standing in the ocean laughing, watching as the waves come crashing 
Seeing colors that we never even knew 

You may think I'm lying, but I swear that it's true 
You think hurt only comes in one color 
Have I got news for you 
I've seen it all, in different shades of blue 

You may think I'm lying, but I swear that it's true 
You think hurt only comes in one color 
Have I got news for you 
I've seen it all, in different shades of blue 

I've seen it all, in different shades of blue 
I've seen it all
