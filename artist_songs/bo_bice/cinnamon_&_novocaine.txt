(Yeah, baby)

I recall I used to wander down that way
It was a beautiful, bright, sunny summer day
That little girl was so sweet

Like cinnamon & novocaine
Yeah, yeah, now she makes me high
Tastes so sweet but she numbs the pain
Yeah, yeah, then she says goodbye
Then she says goodbye, oh yeah

I spent many nights
just lookin' in her deep blue eyes
Oh, but in the morning that little girl
She would make me cry
But I'd do it again

Like cinnamon & novocaine
Yeah, yeah, now she makes me high
Tastes so sweet but she numbs the pain
Yeah, yeah then she says goodbye
Then she says goodbye, oh yeah

(Oh) Like cinnamon & novocaine
Yeah, yeah, now she makes me high
Tastes so sweet but she numbs the pain
Yeah, yeah then she says goodbye (oh yeah, yeah, yeah)

Just Like Cinnamon & Novocaine
Yeah, yeah, now she makes me high
Cinnamon & novocaine
Yeah, yeah now she makes me high
Tastes so sweet but she numbs the pain
Yeah, yeah then she says goodbye
Then she says goodbye, oh yeah
