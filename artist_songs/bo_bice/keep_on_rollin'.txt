Don't know how the bills will get paid 
Hard to make it by on minimum wage. 
Nobody I know got it made in the shade 
Round and round and round we go 

You better get up, lord you better get up, people don't you know 
You better wake up, child, you better wake up get your feet back on the floor 
If you feel your spirits sinking, let your worries go 
You got to keep on rollin', down that road 

Hearts get broke and love gets lost 
Nobody worry about what its gonna cost 
Who's gonna pay when the dice gets tossed 
So it's round and round and round we go 

You better to get up, better get up, people don't you know 
You better to wake, child, you better wake up get your feet back on the floor 
If you feel your spirits sinking, you let your worries go 
You got to keep on rollin', down that road, 
Better keep on rollin', down that road 

It's round and round and round we go 
You better to get up, lord you better get up, people don't you know 
You go to wake up, child, you better wake and get your feet back on the floor 
If you feel your spirits sinking, you let your worries go 
You got to keep on rollin', down that road 
You got to keep on rollin', down that road 
You got to keep on rollin', down that road
