My mother was just 21, all alone with a son of gun she roamed 
Spent some nights sleeping in our car, cheap hotels and seedy bars 
As it came to pass so was my road 
She's a good-hearted woman with a heart of gold that always understands 
That good hearted woman is making life the best way she can 

My grandaddy said when I was 9, boy I raised you on that the Southern pride and so 
Taught me how to fish and how to fight, when I was wrong and what was right 
But the greatest story that he ever told 
Was of a good-hearted woman with a heart of gold that always understands 
That good hearted woman is making life the best way she can 

Pretty wife and fancy cars, I've paid my dues and got some scars to say 
There ain't a thing that I regret and I hope to laugh at all of this 
When I'm sitting on my front porch old and gray 
With my good-hearted woman with a heart of gold that always understands 
My good hearted woman is making life the best way she can 
My good hearted woman sure loves a hard-headed man
