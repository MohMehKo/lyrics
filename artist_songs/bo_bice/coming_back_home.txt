I see a rainbow of colors spread out before me 
I follow winding lines down a desolate road 
I really don't mind what they say about me 
I got a long way to ride to get where I want to go 

It's alright, baby it's okay, I'm gonna pack my bags I'll be on my way 
I'm coming back home, coming back home. 
No more worries about the past, I know with you it's meant to last 
I'll never be alone, coming back home 

Traveled many a mile, seen so many places 
The faces they pass, walking down this road 
I really don't mind what they say about me 
I got a long way to ride to get where I want to go 

It's alright, baby it's okay, I'm gonna pack my bags I'll be on my way 
I'm coming back home, coming back home. 
No more worries about the past, I know with you it's meant to last 
I'll never be alone, coming back home 

I'd drive about a million miles 
Just to get to see you smile 

It's alright, baby it's okay, I'm gonna pack my bags I'll be on my way 
I'm coming back home, I'm coming back home. 
No more worries about the past, I know with you it's meant to last 
I'll never be alone, I'm coming back home 

It's alright, baby it's okay, I'm gonna pack my bags I'll be on my way 
I'm coming back home, coming back home. 
No more worries about the past, I know with you it's meant to last 
I'll never be alone, coming back home 

I'm coming back home 
I'm coming back home
