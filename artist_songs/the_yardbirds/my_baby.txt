And when they say that lovers feign,
Well, to them, you know, that may be true,
All I gotta do is call your name,
Well then I've got,
My baby.
Yes I have,
You know I've got,
My baby.

And when I work hard each and every day,
It don't matter not to me no more,
All I gotta do is just call your name,
Well then I've got,
My baby.
You know I've got,
My baby.

You know I've got,
My baby.
Yes I have,
You know I've got,
My baby.

Deep, deep, deep in the heart of night,
I lay my head down and go to sleep,
I know everything's gonna be alright,
Because I've got,
My baby.
- Yes I have.
You know I've got,
My baby,
- Yes I have.
You know I've got,
My baby.
