Oh I mistreated my baby last night, woman from holding you here in my arms
Oh I mistreated my baby last night, woman from holding you here in my arms
Now you know she been gone 24 hours and that's 23 hours too long

You know if I had a million dollars I would give every dime to bring her back home
Oh, how my poor heart bleeds peoples, it's so sad to be alone
Now you know she been gone just about 24 hours and that's 23 hours too long

Oh, my baby's so pretty, this little girl she looks just like a charm
I love this woman, this woman, she looks just like a charm
Now you know she been gone 24 hours and that's 23 hours too long
