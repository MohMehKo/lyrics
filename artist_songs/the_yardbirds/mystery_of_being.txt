In the mystery of being
Sometimes when it's not so easy seeing
Where you're going, what will be tomorrow
Wondering about the path to follow

In the darkness we bump into each other
And it's hard for me to call you brother
In my heart the questions are burning
Someone said the journey is the learning

If I could shine a light on where I'm going
If I could shine a light on what I'm doing
If I could find the love that might be freeing
In this mystery of being

In the mystery of living
Seems to me there's such a joy in giving
Without sadness how could there be elation
Feel my life is down to my creation

If I could shine a light on where I'm going
If I could shine a light on what I'm doing
If I could find the love that might be freeing
In this mystery of being
