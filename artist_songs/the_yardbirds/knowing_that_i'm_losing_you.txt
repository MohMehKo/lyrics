How will you spend your time, my love?
Crying through the clouds above, my love
The tears will fall as rain

We're falling from a tree
The time it takes to see
The rising of the sun
The time it takes to run

Measuring a summer's day
You'll only find it slips away to grey
The hours will bring you pain

The hours will bring you pain

We're falling from a tree
The time it takes to see
The rising of the sun
The time it takes to run
