I want you to meet me
Out on the water coast
I want you to meet me darlin'
Out on the water coast
I want to find out which one you love the most

I want your love
And I sent you a telegram
Baby, I want your love
And I sent you a telegram
And I call you long distance so you know just wild I am

Meet me, meet me, meet me on the water coast
Meet me, meet me, meet me on the water coast
I'm gonna find out this mornin' which one of us you love the most

Meet me, meet me baby, on the water coast
I want you to meet me, meet me, meet me down on the water coast
I'm gonna find out in the mornin' which one you love the most
I'm gonna find out in the mornin' which one that you love the most
