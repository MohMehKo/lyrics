Ain't but one way out
Lord, I ain't goin' out that door
Ain't but one way out
Lord, I ain't goin' out that door
There's a man down there
May be your man, I won't know

Lord you got me trapped woman
Up on the second floor
If I get by this time
I won't be trapped no more
So raise our window baby
I can ease out soft and slow
And lord, your neighbors
Won't be talking stuff they don't know

Lord, I'm foolish to be here in the first place
I know some man gonna walk in and take my place
Ain't no way in the world
I'm going out that front door
Cause there's a man down there
Might be your man I don't know
Cause there's a man down there
Might be your man I don't know
