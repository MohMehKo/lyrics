A man I knew
Died too young
And in the end
His song unsung
He touched my life
He touched my soul
Given time he'd reach his goal

An original man that I knew
An original man right through

A sadness hidden
Behind his gaze
Before his time
In many ways
People copy,
Take and steal
But my friend he was for real

An original man that I knew
An original man right through

Time gives
And takes away
Everybody has their day
Even now
I see your face
You never left without a trace

An original man that I knew
An original man right through
