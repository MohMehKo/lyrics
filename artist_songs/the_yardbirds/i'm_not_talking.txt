I'm not talking
Well that's what I got to say
If I said things were splendid
Our mom might be offended
If I said things were awful
It may just be unlawful
That's one thing I can do without

I'm not talking
Well that's what I got to say
Used to think I knew it
Man I sure outgrew it
Things like idle chatter
Ain't the things that matter
Don't call me baby, I'll call you

I'm not talking
Well that's what I got to say
If I said things at midnight
I ain't gonna say 'em in daylight
I reached the final conclusion
And all this persecution
Don't call me, baby, I'll call you
