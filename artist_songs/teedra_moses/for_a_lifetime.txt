You give and you give
But you never seem to get back in return
What you give
So your heart's in first through third degree burns
And in the end, you just want to give up on love
Oh, you're gonna get yours

Sure as all that breathe will die
And showers fall from April skies
A heart that's pure won't be denied
The kinda lovin' that'll rock ya
The kinda lovin' that'll keep ya
Hold ya for a lifetime
Even in the sad times

Your guard's up, and your heart's cold
This might be the one
But you will never know
You're holding onto pain from so long ago
You gotta let it go, you gotta let it go
Oh, and I promise you're gonna find love

Sure as all that breathe will die
And showers fall from April skies
A heart that's pure won't be denied
The kinda lovin' that'll rock ya
The kinda lovin' that'll keep ya
Hold ya for a lifetime

Even in the hard times
Even when it's going down
You're gonna find someone's riding with you
You don't have to be alone
You just gotta hold on
You're gonna find true love

Sure as all that breathe will die
And showers fall from April skies
A heart that's pure won't be denied
The kinda lovin' that'll rock ya
The kinda lovin' that'll hold...
Hold ya for a lifetime

Oh, oh.. hold ya for a lifetime
Even in the bad times
