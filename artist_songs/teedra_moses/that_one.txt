[Verse 1: Teedra Moses]
Sweeter were the days when we used to play
Catch it, kiss it, hide and go get it
Now we're grown up and there's more at stake
Between loving less is complicated
I swear if you could love me through
All my emotional, crazy, moods
I'll be the one that'll hold you down
When them other hoes leave you lonely

[Pre-Chorus 1: Teedra Moses]
If I choose to let down my guard you gotta show me some security
I like a man that know what he wants
And if you don't you can't rock with me
Oh yeah yeah, I'm kinda nice
I can throw that thing like some lucky dice
Just tell me that you hold my heart
Cause them other one's left it lonely

[Chorus: Teedra Moses]
Tell me that you're that one (tell me baby, tell me baby)
That's what I need you to be (that's what I need from you)
And if you show your all (you gotta show me baby, show me baby)
I'll give you all of me

[Verse 2: Anthony Hamilton]
Sweet was the kiss [?] day was made
We used to rock away, was so winning
And now I'm in the mood and it's all I knew
I miss the love we were both sharing
I swear if I could ride for you
Be there, have my life with you
Love to take chances, to treat you right
Fix what those other guys did

[Pre-Chorus 2: Anthony Hamilton]
Come hand me your heart, I know what it wants, [?] romance
Someone when you call answers the phone, won't check you for it
You never have to wonder love, nothing can come between us
I get a [?] and fill you up, leave your knees shaking 'til the morning

[Chorus: Teedra Moses (Anthony Hamilton)]
Tell me that you're that one (tell me you're the one)
That's what I need you to be (all I need you to do baby)
And if you show you off (show you my love)
I'll give you all of me (all of me baby)

[Verse 3: Teedra Moses (Anthony Hamilton)]
Tell me you're never gonna leave me no more
(Say you're never need nobody else)
See baby I'll be all that you need
(I'll be all that you need, I'll never leave)
Only if you show your all, I'll give you everything
Cause I wanna give, wanna give you all of me baby

[Chorus: Teedra Moses (Anthony Hamilton)]
Tell me that you're that one (I know that I can be the one)
That's what I need you to be (I'll be all you need baby)
And if you show your all, I'll give you all of me (all of you)
You'll never need no one (you'll never need nobody else)
Cause I'll be all that you need (I'll be all that you need baby, I will)
Boy if you show your all (show you all I have for you baby)
I'll give you everything
