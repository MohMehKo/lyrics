I Pray that the sun shines in the windows 
Like it did on thursday 
Wont sleep the night before ill be up just wondering my life
I would call on my peeps 
Early in the morning to come later for a party
Id spend the day with my angels at the beach
Listening to the shore
That would be the way theyd remember me

[Chorus]

If this was my last day here on earth (earth earth earth)
If this was my last day 
If this was my last day here on earth (earth earth earth)
Oooo earth

Pray that its a saturday is a better day for me to go on 
I can be free on the weekends 
I use to live for the weekends (ooooo) 
Call you up and acknowledge you to come through 
And we do things do things over and over and over again 
Just when you blow me out  (you blow me out)
Thats when my heart would stop

[Chorus]

If this was my last day here on earth (earth earth earth)
If it was my last day if it was my last day here
If this was my last day here on earth (earth earth earth) 
If it was my last day here on earth
Ooooo earth

Never really thought about it
So carefree
Young and just doing my own thing 
Really i be on bended knee (really id be on bended knee)
Praying that he opens his gates for me 

Spend the day with my angels at the beach
Listening to the shore 
That would be the way theyd remember me

[Chorus]
If this was my last day here on earth (earth earth earth)
Would you remember me? (ooooooo)
(If i was gone) if this was my last day on earth (earth earth earth)
Would you remember me
If it was my last day [2X] (oooooo)
