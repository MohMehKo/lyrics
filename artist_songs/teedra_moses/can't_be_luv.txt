[Verse:]
Tonight in particular I love the momentum love
The way we vibing
Each kiss so tenderly
Won’t somebody pray for me?
‘Cause I think I’m going down in
I still smoke bills up the roof
I mean everything goes
The deeper I get into you
I don’t wanna let it go

[Pre-Chorus:]
And how do we know? How do we know?
How do we know this can’t be luv?
How do we know? How do we know?
How do we know this can’t be luv?

[Chorus:]
I won’t let it show (won’t let it show)
I don’t care at all (I don’t care at all)
‘Cause boy right now this feels like luv

[Verse:]
The more you dim the lights, the more that I realize
That it ain’t no use in front
I got the need to feed and you got the need to please
Baby we could just do something
‘Cause this could be for our lack of time
I can’t get caught up with that
‘Cause I’ve been waiting my whole life
Tonight I just can’t hold it back

[Pre-Chorus:]
And how do we know? How do we know?
How do we know this can’t be luv?
How do we know? How do we know?
How do we know this can’t be luv?

[Chorus:]
I won’t let it show (won’t let it show)
I don’t care at all (I don’t care at all)
‘Cause boy right now this feels like luv

[Bridge:]
At times I want you… I want you… I want you
In the morning when I wake and bake
And I want you… I want you… I want you
I don’t wanna think no more
I don’t lay wait, give way
I don’t wanna wonder
I just wanna do all the things we do
Late at night in my thoughts of you
I just wanna do all the things we do
In our mind, just you and I
Uh, and I don’t wanna think no more baby
I don’t wanna wonder
I don’t wanna wait baby
I don’t wanna think about it
I… I wanna… I wanna make love to you
I just wanna make love
Don’t you want to?
