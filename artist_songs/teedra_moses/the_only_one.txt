(Oh ohhh, ohh oh ohh, Oh ohhh)
Never thought you would get me this caught up
You laid down your slickness and my heart was stuck
It ain’t just the way we move
I’m really in to you
I’m so in to you
(Ohhh oh ohh)
I love taking journeys through your mind
From back when you were hustling
To this glamorous life
Tell me I’m the one and I’ll give you a love divine
I’ll give you a love divine

Missing time with other girls when I know you know what I want
Love so good your whole heart yearns
You need me here in your world

Let me be 
Be your only one boy
Let me be
Be the only one you want
…The only one you want
Be the only one you want

I really didn’t ever think you’d be this cool
All that I’m saying is that I’m rocking with you
Baby make the move and do what you got to do
What you got to do
(just do what you got to do)

(Cause you just)
Missing time with other girls when I know you know what I want
(you know all about it)
Love so good your whole heart yearns
You need me here in your world

(baby)
Let me be
Be your only one boy
(baby)
Let me be 
Be the only one you want

I’ll be your best friend
I’ll be your love
I’ll be your angel 
If you’ll be my star
Boy what I want 
Is to be everything your heart could want in me
I’ll be your love drug
I’ll take you high
And give you sweet kisses to bring you back down
Baby can’t you see you got it all in me
I’ll be your everything

Let me be
Be your only one boy
(that’s all I wanna be) 
Let me be
Be the only one you want
(that’s what I wanna be)

Let me be
Be your only one boy
(ohhh oh ohhh)
Let me be
Be the only one you want

(Oh oh oh, Oh oh oh, Oh) [3x]
Be the only one you want
(Oh oh oh, Oh oh oh, Oh) [3x]
Be the only one you want
