You say you want a pretty angel
But you got me out here living in hell
You said, "Baby, don't go, don't go"
And you act like you don't want me here

All I want is to feel free again
All I need is to get the loving that I give in return

And as bad as I am, the way you treat me
This don't make no sense, no, baby
This don't make no sense

I had to get my weight up
That's what you didn't, know
I took what you gave and I flipped that
I can get mine alone
But all I ever wanted

All I ever wanted was your love
All I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was your love
All I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was your love

But you gave me your money
When I gave you my heart
Now I'm out here getting this money
So I don't need you no more
I don't need you no more

ALL I EVER WANTED WAS YOUR LOVE [x3]

Money, my heart
Now I'm getting money
I don't need you no more
I don't need you no more
I don't need you no more

Talk is cheap and flowers die
What's the point of your apologies
If they all end up in lies?

I don't even know why it's so hard
