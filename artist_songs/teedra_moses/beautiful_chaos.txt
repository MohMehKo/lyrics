2, 3, uh
Ooo oo oooo oo, Ooo oooo oo
Yeah yeah, yeaaah yeah
Yeaah, yeaaaah
2, 3

What we got is something unexplainable
A spark to behold, 'til we're burnin' each other's souls
It's Beautiful Chaos
We need to but we can't let go
Cause it's so beautiful
But it's chaos

Clearly (it's clear to me), every time I let you back in you mess it up (damn)
Makes me sure you're not the one (that's when I run)
Ignoring your phone calls (you still call), talkin' 'bout I'm done with that
Days pass, you're knocking on my door I let you in
Alone my covers, I'm yearnin' for your love (Cause I really want cha, yeah I really do, but I'm tryin' hard not to fuck with you)
And I should know, but I surrender to your call (? guards come down for you)
Cause I can't deny it noooo, noo

What we got (something baby) is something unexplainable (and it feels so good)
A spark to behold (but it's so, so wrong, so wrong), 'til we're burnin' each other's souls
It's Beautiful Chaos (yeah yeah, yeaah yeah)
We need to but we can't let go
Cause it's so beautiful (so beautiful)
But it's chaos

Hey (Ohh oooooh oooohh ohhhh)
It's like the same one that make ya cry
Be the same one that make ya smile (Ohh oooooh oooohh ohhhh)
And when you think ya can't take no more
You have a change of heart, makin' love tonight (Ohh oooooh oooohh ohhhh)

Oooooh, wooooah oh oh oh oh
Well somebody gotta feel me, won't cha feel me, can't ya feeeel meee (Ohh oooooh oooohh ohhhh)
Woah oh oh oh oh
Beautiful chaos
