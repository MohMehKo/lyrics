[Chorus]
Take me 
Back 2 the day when you made me fall
I want 2 go, Iwant 2 go
Make me feel like you did
The very first time we ever touched
I want 2 go let just go

[Teedra]
Winter's here
Ain't I ain't mad about it
I just wanna lay with you in the late nights getting warm
We find less and less time 2 get 2gether
But that ther's whatever
See 2night is for you and I yeah 
We gotta take it back 2night

(I want 2 go)
(I want 2 go)
Make me feel like you did
The very first time we ever touched
I want 2 go lets just go

[Raphael]
The place of used to be
I still part of me
And I'm so fortunate lady

that you still need a piece of me
and I know that your waiting see
I'm only down town
Y a know I roll alone girl
I'm never with a crowd

[Chorus]

[Teedra and Raphael]
And I know I can get crazy
Say things I don't mean
But in all my frustration
I'm just trynna make you see
I'm still here for you
My love won't let it die
I know it's been awhile baby but
I need you 2 take me there 2night

Baby won't u take me 2night
Because my heart
Really needs you

[Chorus]

[Teedra and Raphael]
And I know I can get crazy
Say things I don't mean
But in all my frustration
I'm just trynna make you see
I'm still here for you
My love won't let it die
I know it's been awhile baby but
I need you 2 take me there 2night

[Chorus]
