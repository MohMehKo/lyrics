Rather have a king than a boss
Rather have a good man than a daddy
Rather die shotgun in an old school
With a cool dude than a rich dude acting badly
Gladly, cause I ain't the average kind
Rather be a queen than a bad bitch
Cause inside a queen you gon' find a bad bitch
Fact is, a love like mine you'll never find
I need you to understand
I need you to comprehend

There'll be no heartbreak, late nights
All alone waiting for you, tears dried
Ohhh I ain't on that no more
Ain't on that no more, ain't on that no more
If you really want it I mean really really want it
Then you gon' have to get it right

And I won't make it hard
You'll lead and I'll follow boy
But you gotta be following God
(You got to follow)
I gotta see the God in you
(If you want me to follow)
Gotta feel the need in me
(You've got to for me)
You gotta make me want you to
Gotta make you understand
Gotta make you comprehend

There'll be no heartbreak, late nights
All alone waiting for you, tears dried
Ohhh I ain't on that no more
Ain't on that no more, ain't on that no more
If you really want it I mean really really want it
Then you gon' have to get it right

Get it right, get it right
Get it right, you gotta get it right
Get it right, baby get it right
Get it right, need you to get it right

All I really wanna do is love you
All I really wanna do is love you
All I really wanna do is love you
All I really wanna do is love you
All I really wanna do is love you
All I really wanna do is love you
All I really wanna do is love you
All I really wanna do is love you
(Give me your heart)
All I, want to, love you
(Give me your heart)
