[Intro:]
This is for you,
Ever so sincerely,
The young lioness

[Verse 1:]
All I really ever wanted was, 
some kind of love and understanding, 
silly of me to think you would be the one digging me, 
you were my everything now we're here

[Chorus:]
I just said to hell with love, 
I'mma go out and have some fun, 
instead of waiting on for you to act right, 
while you were doing yours I was doing mine, 
aww to hell with it

[Verse 2:]
Wrote you letters, wrote you songs, 
the thing boy just to let you  
know what I felt inside, was heartbreak (heartbreak), 
but you didn't even care (no), 
your around here with other girls, 
I wouldn't do you that way, 
so I'mma tell you straight, 
I met him on a Monday by Friday we were talking like everyday, 
and damn he was so fine, cool as hell, conversation great, 
it took a little while before I even let him near enough to hold me close, 
but when I did, I didn't want him to let me go, that's why 

[Chorus:]
I just said to hell with love, 
I'mma go out and have some fun, 
all I really wanted was wanted was you and I, 
instead of waiting on for you to act right, 
while you were doing yours I was doing mine, 
aww to hell with it

[Bridge:]
Every bird got wings to fly, 
bet you never thought your sweet baby girl would ever try, 
baby don't know why you lied and I saw all the things, 
things that you did, that's why

[Chorus:]
I just said to hell with love(I said to hell with it), 
I'mma go out and have some fun(I'mma go out and tear it up), 
instead of waiting on for you to act right 
(I ain't waiting, I ain't waiting,I ain't waiting on a [?] no more), 
I was out with him because you were out with her, aww to hell with it

[Outro:]
Who's making love to your old lady, while you were out making love,
Tell me who's making love to your old lady, while your out making love
