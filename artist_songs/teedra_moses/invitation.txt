[Spoken:]
Two, three, four...ah
We can dance if you wanna
Romance, if you wanna
We can even take that chance if you wanna
But if you want it and you really think you gonna
You have to get it right

[Sung:]
First round draft choice ain't no contender boy
I get inside your head, so now your mind's blown
Thinking about me all the time, you call me just to say
You think I'm cool as shish you wanna be worth it

Baby babe, if you really want my love,
You can have all that it is you want
But what makes you so, what makes you so different,
You so different boy from the rest
Can you show me that...

[Chorus:]
This is my, my invitation to love
You can have all that you want
This is my, my invitation
But if you can't provide it,
Then you're uninvited to my love
This is my, my invitation to love
You can have all that you want!
This is my, my invitation,
But if you can't provide it,
Then you're uninvited to my love!

My love can be the balance
Cool your summers, warm your winters,
My love is 365, January to December
I offer my love if you think you can handle it
Swear if you get it right, my love could be a paradise

My love could be yours (ah ah)
If you can get it right,
My love could be yours (ah ah)
it would be so nice
My love could be yours (your paradise)
My love supreme make me the only one on your team
