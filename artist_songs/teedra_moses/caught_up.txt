You have captivated me in every way
From the time we met, still until this day
Oh boy, you got me... caught up with you
Simple as the time we spent I'll tell you this
I'll do anything cause the truth is
Boy you really got me... caught up with you
And I'm sayin, and I'm sayin, boy

I want to be none less than wifey
You half-ass the rest
But you watch your step with me
See, I know and you know that we are 
Ready for love

Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
Ooh-ooh... you got me
Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
Ooh-ooh... now keep me

I ain't quick to fall for all that game they run
They think a broad is dumb, though I know the time
Still boy, you got me... caught up with you
We gon' get it all straight now, I ain't here to waste my time
The day you flip's the day I'm out
Still it don't change the fact you got me... caught up with you

I want to be none less than wifey
You half-ass the rest
But you watch your step with me
See, I know and you know that we are 
Ready for love

Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
Ooh-ooh... you got me
Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
Ooh-ooh... now keep me

Listen...
You know that you got me caught up with you, baby
And it's so wonderful
But you got to give all of yourself if you want me
All that I'm sayin is

I want to be none less than wifey
You half-ass the rest
But you watch your step with me
See, I know and you know that we are 
Ready for love

Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
Ooh-ooh... you got me
Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
Ooh-ooh... now keep me
