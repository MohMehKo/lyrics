Well, I think I'm goin outta my head...

Think I'm goin outta my head
Cause my heart keeps yearnin for ya
Thought I know that we are so dead 
Gotta let it go, holding on to 
All the memories that we had in the past
It ain't worth my tears
You could never bring heartbreak again

See me, thinkin there could be no way
That we'd end up this way
And each day it gets clearer and clearer to me
That this is the only way
Now that I found my way
My whole life has changed
And now I found happiness here without you

Think I'm goin outta my head
Cause my heart keeps yearnin for ya
Thought I know that we are so dead 
Gotta let it go, holding on to 
All the memories that we had in the past
It ain't worth my tears
You could never bring heartbreak again

Silly me, still sometimes I think about ya
And I just try to let it pass by
Cause I know that I probably will always love you
Cause you were the first one for me
But still I found happiness here without you

Used to think maybe but baby
Now I am so sure that you and me
Will only lead me back to heartbreak

Think I'm goin outta my head
Cause my heart keeps yearnin for ya
Thought I know that we are so dead 
Gotta let it go, holding on to 
All the memories that we had in the past
It ain't worth my tears
You could never bring heartbreak again

I think I'm goin outta my head
Said I think I'm goin outta my head
Think I'm goin outta my head
Said I think I'm goin outta my head

Think I'm goin outta my head
Cause my heart keeps yearnin for ya
Thought I know that we are so dead 
Gotta let it go, holding on to 
All the memories that we had in the past
It ain't worth my tears
