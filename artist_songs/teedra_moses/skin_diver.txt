[Verse 1:]
Others want your money
I want your time
You can't neglect it
You can't deny
You, you wanna touch me
You're sipping cognac
I'm sipping wine
You pull me closer
I melt inside
You, you wanna swim deep

[Chorus:]
Falling
Deeper
Way beyond the surface, we go
Every time you dive
Falling
Deeper
Way beyond the surface, we go
Every time you dive
Skin Diver

Oh
Skin Diver
Oh
We be smoking and drinking and
Having us a real good time
Kissing and hugging and
What we have is so divine
Way, way beyond

[Verse 2:]
Others give you pressure
I'm on my grind
Ain't gotta stress ya
In the end, you'll be mine
I know for sure
Know for sure
Conversations so deep
Til the break of dawn
Anticipating next time I'm in your arms
That's all you want
Boy, that's all you want

[Chorus:]
(Your falling) Falling
(Baby, you're falling) Deeper
(Deeper, baby) Way beyond the surface, we go
Every time we dive
(I'm falling) Falling (I'm fall-ing)
Deeper (Deeper, deeper)
Way beyond the surface, we go
Every time you dive
Ooooh, skin diver

Oh, skin diver
(It's so for real when we be)
Smoking and drinking and
Having us a real good time
What we have is so divine
Way beyond
