[Verse 1]
I don't give a damn what's real
What's fake, what's truth what's lies
See darlin I
Don't feel, it's relevant 2 me
I don't wanna know her name where u met
If see some crazy chick just stalking u
I don't care
it's irrevelant 2 me
(pissed off as I am)
I was saucy @ the bar feelin like a star
When she got all in my face
Talkin bout what' ya do when ya do it to her
I damn near slapped her face
(OK)
she don't know me better ask someone
I don't play those silly chicken games
Oh no

[Chorus]
If I'm believing what I hear is true
Then ther's a broad round town that's claiming you
And listen daddy I'm 2 cute 2 fight
You better get that bitch told tonight

And I don't ever 
I mean never
Ever, ever wanna deal with this again
U better tell her
Tell her, tell her, tell her

[Verse 2]
If in fact, you gave her ya thang
it doesn't matter babe
I know her touch don't feel like mine
(I know her touch don't feel like mine get it right)
In in fact you gave her a little change
it doesn't matter cause I know whose name on the account
(I get mine no matter what the price)
this is how it all went down..
I was saucy @ the bar feelin like a star
When she got all in my face
Talkin bout what' ya do when ya do it to her
I damn near slapped her face
(Ok)
she don't know me she better ask someone
there's no way you better handle this thing

[Chorus]
