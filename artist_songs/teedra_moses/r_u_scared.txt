[Verse 1:]
It’s Friday night
And I’m hanging out
And I’m feeling light
These purple clouds
And this brown liquor
It ain’t about
Wanna dance with somebody cool
I wanna dance with you

Far from the distance (I saw you in my eye)
I felt you come close (saw you push through the crowd)
All of the sudden (You’re here now)
Cause I get what I want

[Chorus:]
And if I want
I can make you fall in love baby (too)
Something like a dream come to me boy (ooh)
And if they’re looking who cares cause I want you here (right now)
Maybe we can start
On the dance floor

[Verse 2:]
We don’t even need a reason
You’re into me I’m in to you all night
Right here in front of all these people (baby are you)
Baby R U Scared

[Breakdown:]
Let the music get to you
(I’m saying if I want I cans)
Let the feeling get to you
(If i want i can boy you know I can)

[Chorus:]
And if I want
I can make you fall in love baby (too)
Something like a dream come to me boy (ooh)
And if they’re looking who cares cause I want you here (right now)
Maybe we can start
On the dance floor

[Bridge:]
Feel my body calling yours
Look in my eyes you’re magnetize
You lick your lips and then I’m sure
You want me more

Far from the distance (I saw you in my eye)
I felt you come close (saw you push through the crowd)
All of the sudden (You’re here now)
Cause I get what I want

[Chorus 2x:]
And if I want
I can make you fall in love baby (too)
Something like a dream come to me boy (ooh)
And if they’re looking who cares cause I want you here (right now)
Maybe we can start
On the dance floor

We don’t even need a reason
You’re into me I’m in to you all night
Right here in front of all these people (baby are you)
Baby R U Scared
