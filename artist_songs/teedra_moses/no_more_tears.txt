I guess I must be caught between my heart and mind
Wanting it to be good knowing its not
Crying all time, praying that a change is gonna come

{Just like the other day... he hit me}

Hit on my hip like "just touch down, (down) wanna see you, (you)
I know you're mad at me but baby I'm so sorry... Sorry"
I just wanna be...

Happy, sipping, puffing, passing
Relaxing with my family
No more tears for you...

Dancing, laughing, writing, singing
Rocking to hot tracks like this
No tears for you...

Guess its 'bout time I'm due another love 
Messing with this nigga got me falling apart
I don't wanna be someone I know I'm not
Call me on the phone "baby get dressed; (get dressed) I'm scooping you up"
I waited for an hour he never showed

{Shit... I went to get cocktails with my girls. Its a new year}

I just wanna be...

Happy, sipping, puffing, passing
Relaxing with my family
No more tears for you...

Dancing, laughing, writing, singing
Rocking to hot tracks like this
No tears for you

No tears for you
No tears for you for you
Happy, sipping, puffing, passing
Relaxing with my family
No more tears for you

Dancing, laughing, writing, singing
Rocking to hot tracks like this
No tears for you
