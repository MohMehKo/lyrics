I think nothing's gonna be no fairytale
Just remember what my momma always said
When in time you're troubled you melt down and break
Give you [?] so you can hold your head!
Bell, one more time
When you feel like you just can't go on in life
Soon, soon
It will pass you by (It will pass you by)
Just another loop from the roller coaster ride
These are the SECRETS OF LIFE, Alright!
These are the things that get, that get you by

No hold back all the tears
Wondering how you made it through all these years
No one ever told me it will be easy,
But I found all the strength I need in your LOVE!
Bell, one more time
When another one is gonna break your heart
Soon, soon it will pass you by
It's just another lesson learn along your path
These are all the SECRETS OF LIFE
Alright!
These are the things that get, that get you by, gonna get you by

Cause life's an after party and love's a sweet champagne
Yeah, get your money
Don't forget why you came and who you are
Love your haters more,
'Cause baby you're a star - baby you're a star!
Don't need!

These are all the SECRETS OF LIFE
Alright!
These are the things that get, the things that get
That get you by
