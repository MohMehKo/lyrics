[Verse 1]
Oh I
I see what I'm dealing with
See u
U don't understand my gangsta
When I
See somthing I want then I just take and make it mine
(all mine)
I likc my lips and then just think how sweet it is to be me
So to date me must be hot
Well if you gon keep hanging round
U gone have to figure out
Cause there

[Chorus]
Ain't no defense
When I'm calling
Red hot scowling
And I'm calling 4 u.. what else can u do

[Verse 2]
Oh I 
I don't think you realize
That u
U don't even have a chance
When I
Spit my G @ u I bet u won't know how 2 act
(act) it's that bad
(act) I lick my lips and then I think about how sweet my touch is baby
So to feel me must be hot (hot)
So if you didn't know you know now
exactly how it's going down

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
See u don't understand the woman that I am
(the lover best friend all u need)
and even if you did could you handle it
(all of the love I give so good)

[Chorus]
