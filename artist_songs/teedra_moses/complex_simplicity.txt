Life is just complex simplicity
Thug it out...

Everybody's worried bout tomorrow
Will they see tomorrow
I'm just tryna get mine off today
Mama said tomorrow ain't promised
So I'm tryna live like it's my very last day

You can't spend your life
Being in fear of all that may be
You gotta press on, you gotta be free
You gotta breathe
Inhale, exhale, come on

Bounce with me tonight
Get low with me tonight
Put the choke up in the sky
Wave your glasses high cause
We ain't got no choice but to party
Party it all away
We're gonna party for brighter days
Party cause everyday's
Gonna be alright

Everybody's worried bout the negative
Lookin at the worst of things
I'm just tryna celebrate my life
Mama said be young while you can be young
Life only gets rougher
I'm just tryna keep my youth alive

I won't be held down 
With all the things that happened in the past
Daddy, he wasn't there
Mama, she's gone now
I gotta be grown
I need you to hold me down

Bounce with me tonight
Get low with me tonight
Put the choke up in the sky
Wave your glasses high cause
We ain't got no choice but to party
Party it all away
We're gonna party for brighter days
Party cause everyday's
Gonna be alright

Party all night
Don't let it get you down
It's just life

Bounce with me tonight
Get low with me tonight
Put the choke up in the sky
Wave your glasses high cause
We ain't got no choice but to party
Party it all away
We're gonna party for brighter days
Party cause everyday's
Gonna be alright
