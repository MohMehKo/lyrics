I don't have many words to say
It's been over a year since you left that day
I'm trying to be everything you said I could and would be
This little world we live in is plagued with fear
Try to find a guy like you said I should when you were here
(chorus)
I think of you and...
Somehow problems they don't seem so hard
It's all you endured in your life, you are...

And if I cried a million times you must have died a million times from the pain
(oh) Mama I miss you, but I know you made it whole again
(I,I,Oh,oooh,Oh)
This one's for you girl
(I,I,Oh,oooh,Oh)
My little Shirley girl
(I,I,Oh,oooh,Oh)
Oh I miss you
(I,I,Oh,oooh,Oh)

And I want you all to know that I'm trying
To every one here in my heart, I'm trying
And I could never regret you, sweet baby yes
It's so hard trying to raise a boy to a man (ooh oh)

I think of you and... 
Somehow I can make it through another day
Cause I want the best for your life

And If I tried a million times I couldn't find a love closer to get (oh)
Mama's little angels
You're the reason why..
(I,I,Oh,oooh,Oh)
This one's for you boy 
(I,I,Oh,oooh,Oh)
My little angel
(I,I,Oh,oooh,Oh)
My savior
