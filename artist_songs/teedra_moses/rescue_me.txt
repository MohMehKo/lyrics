[Verse 1:]
This poor heart of mine 
Still feel I can find 
A love to call my own 
I gave him good love
Made him feel like a man 
Now I need someone new 
And I want someone like you 

[Chorus:]
He will (Come and) Rescue me 
I know one day he'll come for me
He will (Come and) Save me
And i'm waiting and I'm waiting 

[Verse 2:]
He aint gotta be no gansta (gansta)
He aint gotta be no balla (balla)
Cause baby if we strugglin 
I'll ride with you until we rise
Me for you and 
You for me 
A simple kind of love life
I've always dreamed of 

[Repeat Chorus]

[Hook: Repeat 2x]
Want someone to come into my life and truly rescue me
From the pain that a love selfishly has left with me
I need lovin I need love if nothin else
Baby if your out there holla back

Oooooohhhhhoooooo

[Chorus:]
He will (he will come and) Rescue me (rescue me)
I know one day he'll come for me
He will (baby I'm waiting, waiting for you) Save me (save me) 

[Repeat hook till end]
