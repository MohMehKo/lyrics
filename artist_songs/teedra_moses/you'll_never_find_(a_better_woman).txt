Oh cat daddy...

[Verse 1]
Tell me what you know about, tell me what you know about.
(You and me 2gether)
Loving, so sweet, no beef, just us 2
Tell me what you know about, tell me what you know about
(Love through any weather)
Fuss, fight, put you out, take you back cuz baby it's a
(Ghetto love affair, Ghetto love affair, Ghetto love affair)

Tell me what you know about your man huggin' blocks, all night
When he should be home huggin you..
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

(Tell me what you know about a hustle can do)
To true love

[Chorus]
You'll never find a better woman or a bigger fool
Tell me what you know about breaking up and getting back 2gether
You'll never find a better woman or a bigger fool
Tell me what you know about, what you know about love.

Oh cat daddy..

[Verse 2]
(But when the $ and the fame came)
Could it really ever change, all you wanna do is grind. 
Why can't we spend some time.
(You're unfaithful with my lovin')
Oh.. and this $ don't mean nothing. 
We keep going round and round and baby it's a 
(Ghetto love affair, Ghetto love affair, Ghetto love affair)

Tell me what you know about your man
Giving gifts to compensate for his shit
Oh (Tell me if you what a hustle can do)
I'm telling you, oh you'll never find

[Chorus]

[Jadakiss]
You doing some mean frontin'
When I give you a token of my appreciation now it don't mean nothing
I wouldn't call it hateful, it's ungrateful
Ma I put you on the map molded and shaped you
You supposed ti thug it out instead you buggin' out
If that's what loves about I ain't with that
If I didn't wanna be with you I would've just hit that
And never call back
That's my word don't forget that
You know what never mind
And it's always your fault never mind 
Pick a better line
Cuz I don't know nothin bout us gettin back together again
Boo never agin
Maybe I shouldn't say never
But in due time I hope I find something better

[Chorus]
