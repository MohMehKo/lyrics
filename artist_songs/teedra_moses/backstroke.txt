[Verse 1]
Picture me in one of those two seater things
Top down so thoughts of you are in the breeze
And the wind
And the wind
And the wind
Winds in my  hair
But each time I say I won't be back around
You get me back around
And I know you bring me down
But still somehow
You seem to get me high

[Chorus]
Oh poppi
I sit and think about all of the things
We go through
And I wonder why I stay with you
But there's something in your backstroke
And it keeps me yearning for you
Something's in your backstroke

[Verse 2]
Here it is
I'mma make it plain
I'mma lay it on the line
(lay it on the line)
Mostly I feel you're just
A waste of my time

But oh.. I want you
(I gotta have ya) (really don't need u)

But it's the way u love me
That keeps me thinking poppi oh I

[Chorus]

And it keeps me yearning u
And it keeps me yearning u
And it keeps me yearning u
And it keeps me yearning u

[Bridge]
I can't do this forever but right now I'd rather
just give in and get your love 2night

[Chorus]
