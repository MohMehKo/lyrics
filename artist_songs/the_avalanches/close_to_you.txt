He-here I come, he got - come
He-here I come, he got - come
He-here I come, he got - come
He-here I come, he got - come

Did somebody somewhere summon me?
He-here I come, he got - come
He-here I come, he got - come

The disco... the disco... the disco... 
Glass got me right,
Glass got me right,
Stop to the midnight - don't stop
Stop to the disco... the disco... the disco, 
Stop to the midnight, don't stop to the midnight, don't stop to the midnight, 
Glass got me right

On to the disco... 
There's a gentleman that's going round, turning the joint, upside down (Repeat)
Turning the joint upside down
Turning the joint upside down

Stop to the midnight... 
On to the disco...
