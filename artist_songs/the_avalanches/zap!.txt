I love to fly
It's just, you're alone
With the peace and quiet, nothing around you but clear, blue sky
No one to hassle you
No one to tell you where to go or what to do
The only bad part about flying is having to come back down to the fucking world
(It's time to wake up, you're ready to wake up aren't you? 
Cause it's gonna be a beautiful day today, temperatures in the mid 70s in the city, 
a little cooler at the beaches and warmer at the valleys as always!)
(WHA!)
(Look at it, you gotta wake up! No arguing!)
