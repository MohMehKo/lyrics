[A.Dd+:]
When I was a child and I run around

All you kids are the same today
All you wanna do is play
You never want to work, or take any responsibility
(True!)

Live a love, live a lifetime love

A.Dd+ we at it again
Just doing some horrendous shit with my friends
We smoke out [?]
That's just how we function
We don't give a fuck, I'm not sure if I can
I grew up, I screw up
I do a little too much, they call me advanced
And now they just call the police
Cause I'm 23 and black and won't pull up my pants
They say I'm a thief (they say I'm a thief)
They callin' me thug (they callin' me thug)
They say I'm a killer (they say I'm a killer)
I just say "wassup?" (I just say "wassup?")
They say I'm a thief (they say I'm a thief)
They callin' me thug (they callin' me thug)
They call me a killer (they say I'm a killer)
I just say "wassup?"

We be drivin’ drunk, smokin’ blunts, runnin’ red lights
We be drivin’...  WHY?!
