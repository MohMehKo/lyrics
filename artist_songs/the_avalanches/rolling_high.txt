doin' a mixin', 
it's like a famous doctor, doctor jetson stethesthern is looking like a power spession, 
heads on the on the grass, halfway through the mass, 
its a killer waiting for the burker....

You can rob me, but if the banks are closed, 
Everyones happening and then I do a tip-toe, 
I like your pharmacies, your real estate, your money too meri, 
I drive your car fast and I'm over the limit. 

I'm in your corner, I'm at your window,
I like to see your hair fall around your shoulders, 

Rolling high, sky, high, 
rap music keeping you in time, flys, high, 
rap music keeping you in time, flys, high, 
rap music keeping you in time, flys, high, 
what did you do beatin' buddy did you fuck 'is Philly?

ahaha. 

From the mixin' 
were fuckin' pharmasized 
production of the seprat' quanty's

I drive the grass, 
Johnny Mash, like a douche class.
I got the killer once I opened up the brief case.
