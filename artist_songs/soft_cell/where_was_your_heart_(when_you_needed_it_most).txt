You're time-wasting again
Biting your nails like you were sixteen
Putting up your little walls
When emotion's around
Leave your little heart
In the lost and found
Your friends would die laughing
If they saw you this way
Even though they cry the same tears every day
Where was your heart
When you needed it most?
Hand in hand with your innocence
Gave up the ghost

But it doesn't do to tell
You're at your best
When you're living hell
Just put on your hard face
You know you do that so well
Thank god you wore
Your waterproof make-up today
And who gives a damn about him anyway?
To him you're a body
And to hell with the mind
But you get the same stick from his type all the time
Just a couple of drinks
And they've got you tonight
And you know the sad thing
Is that they're often right

Where was your heart
When you needed it most?
Hand in hand with your innocence
Gave up the ghost

They take hold of your heart
And they spit it right out
Make a show of their conquest
When their friends are about
Your ego deflated
You gave up the fight
And became the good-time-had-by-all-every-night

And where was your heart
When you needed it most?
Hand in hand with your innocence
Gave up the ghost

No comfort of beds
Or the softness of sheets
Just the back of a car
Sprawled across the back seats
And he'll just not give up
And he's messed up your head
A dish in the disco
But a pig in the bed

So you build up a false love affair anyway
Photocopy soap opera stories all day
Where it all ends up fine
And it all ends in church
And the girl looks like you
And she never really gets hurt

And where was your heart
When you needed it most?
Hand in hand with your innocence
Gave up the ghost
