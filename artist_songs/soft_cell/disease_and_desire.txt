Today I awoke
With a scream in my throat
The reminders of you
On the sheets

The print of a torso
Is this far as I know
That feverish hello
Another night of too much sleep

Disease and desire
Disease and desire
Disease and desire
Desire

Some wasting complaint
That was passed on by love
Gods little avenger
Smiles down from above
And I'd rather eat bugs
Than succumb to your love
And a kiss on the mouth
Is a mouth in the mud

Disease and desire
Disease and desire
Disease and desire
Desire

Watch this lowlife
Just look at you
Pouring out of your body
Like sweat they say
Reality breeds contempt
Contempt
Contempt
Contempt

Disease and desire
Disease and desire
Disease and desire
Desire

No heaven up there
Oh nothing so nice
Just the puff in my mouth
Paralysed, paradise

And I'd rather draw blood
Than succumb to your love
And I'd rather give it all up
Than fall for your love

Disease and desire
Disease and desire
Disease and desire
Desire

Disease and desire
Disease and desire
Disease and desire
Desire

Disease and desire
Disease and desire
Disease and desire
Desire

Oh disease and desire
Oh no way
We'll meet again
No way we'll meet again
No way
We'll meet again
No way

Oh disease and desire
