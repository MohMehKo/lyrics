Always the dreamer
But never the dead
You had a rocky road mapped out somewhere in your head
Anyone in your way
Was a spike in your side
With one hand in the wallet
You took them for the ride

Your could look in their eyes
You perfected a lie
Never gave them the chance to question why
If they hit on you
Then you slammed them right back
To hell with the cool
It was up and attack

You should have seen you when you were 18
You were the toughest little f...
I've ever seen
And with each downfall you turned 10 foot tall
The biggest kick in the balls you've ever been

And Dr Diablo's on his rounds again
Looking for blame
And you know that he'll diagnose pain again
Yeah pain again

Narrow the sorrow
Sick of the slick
Of the doors of discovery you had you pick
If they hit on you
Then you hit right back
Never keeping their cool
It was up and attack

Your could look in their eyes
You perfected a lie
Never gave them the chance to question why
If they hit on you
Then you slammed them right back
To hell with the cool
It was up and attack

Whoa you're feeling so torrid today
Life has gone wild
No one blocks out the way
You even look good - so they say
A new lease of life flowed through your body today
(not that looks are all to go by - but anyway)

Shooting the A, Shooting the A, Shooting the A

The stuff is free
And you can now go to town
Building your life up and smashing it down
Building your life up and smashing it down

You couldn't escape from this fact of life
That existing makes you a mess
But every decision or feeling or reason
Causes some sort of mental distress
Your could look in their eyes
You perfected a lie
Never gave them the chance to question why
If they hit on you
Then you slammed them right back
To hell with the cool
It was up and attack

Leave the cool for the fool
Leave the cool for the fool
Leave the cool for the fool
Leave the cool for the fool
Hey hey

You couldn't escape from this fact of life
That existing makes you a mess
But every decision or feeling or reason
Causes some sort of mental distress
Your could look in their eyes
You perfected a lie
Never gave them the chance to question why
If they hit on you
Then you slammed them right back
To hell with the cool
It was up and attack

Hey
Building your life up (shooting the A, shooting the A)
And smashing it down
Building your life up (shooting the A, shooting the A)
And smashing it down
Building your life up (shooting the A, shooting the A)
And smashing it down
