Baby doll is on her trapeze
Wearing the smile that she never sees
Thinking of dollar as she tries to tease

Time to play Sheba on a wooden stage
Taking off the clothes that are grimy with age
Rubbing down the skin that is white and cold
And the sticking plasters that cover up the holes
Stared at by a man that would do her harm
Needs to earn the money that will feed his arm
He promised you security safe and warm
He promised you security safe and warm

They'll never know the hurt that you feel inside
The emptiness you try to hide

I would melt your eyes that are glassy and cold
And as for the future when you grow old
Baby doll
Baby doll
They'll never know the hurt you feel inside
The emptiness you try to hide

Take a tiny costume from a pile of clothes
Just a touch of glitter and a glow of gold
Pick on a failure make his knees go weak
Mouth open, eyes wide, fake your peak

He'll wipe a line of dribble falling from his mouth
Make your wages later when you're back at his house
Try to hide the mirror 'cause it's never kind
Kick start the heart that's so hard to find
Try to save the beauty and to draw the line
Baby, baby, baby doll
Continue your search for a genuine love
Continue your search for a genuine love

Baby, baby, baby doll
