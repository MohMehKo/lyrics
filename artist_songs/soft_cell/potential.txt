Potential

A child in the playground
The woman on the bus
The man in the motor car
Or anyone of us
A youth on a motorbike
The old man in the park
The girl at the window
The footsteps in the dark

We have got the potential
We could be anything
We have got the potential
We could do anything

Behind closed doors
Behind the facade
The memories of a certain man
Are never, never, never to far
You can see him in the window
Sitting in his place
Take another look
You might recognise his face

We have got the potential
We could be anything
We have got the potential
We could do anything

Potential

Do you think we've got the potential
We have got the potential
We have got the potential
