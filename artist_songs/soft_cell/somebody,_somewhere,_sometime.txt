I hear a calling that's hard to resist
Love is a feeling that I miss
So won't you touch my heart with a kiss
Somebody somewhere
Somebody sometime
Somebody somehow
Won't you help me now

I need to fix my aching heart 
Like a hunter alone in the dark
I just need somebody to understand
Somebody somewhere
Somebody sometime
Somebody somehow
Won't you help me now

Is it all in my mind (is it)
All in my mind
(Is there somebody out there for me to find
Or is it all in my mind)

I'd give myself to you as a gift
Dedicated to an emotional lift
I need to feel passion
I need to feel love
Somebody somewhere
Somebody sometime
Somebody somehow
Won't you help me now

This is a plea from my desires
This is a call for pleasure
Brush the shadows from my eyes
Let me see is this love or lies
Somebody somewhere
Somebody sometime
Somebody somewhere
Somebody sometime
Somebody somewhere
Somebody somehow
Won't you help me now

Somebody working
Somebody eating
Somebody lying
Somebody cheating
Somebody bored
Somebody trying
Somebody laughing
Somebody crying
Somebody out there
Somebody somewhere
Somebody out there
Somebody somewhere
Somebody out there
Somebody somewhere
Somebody out there
Somebody somewhere

It's all in my mind
It's all in my mind
[repeat]
