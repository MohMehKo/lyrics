Come and meet
Another kind of love
Meet another kind of love
Different than the real thing
But just as demanding
And just as demeaning

Treacled in apathy
All worries swept away
By one so simple act of annihilation
And I've not cried like this
And I've not felt this calm

Meet Murder My Angel
You've arrived at the moment
To cross over the threshold

I met another kind of love
Met another kind of love
And I've not felt alive in this way
For a long time

Your pleaser
Annoyer
Destroyer
and Voyeur
Waits alone at the corner
At the back door to paradise
the back door to paradise

You're shaking all over
It's time to cross over the threshold
And there's no way back my angel
There's no way back for an angel

Meet Murder My Angel
You've arrived at the moment
To cross over the threshold

It's such a feeling
Oh such a feeling

Oh it's such a feeling
My Angel...
