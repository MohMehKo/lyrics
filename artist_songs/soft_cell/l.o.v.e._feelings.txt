You can be so difficult
You bring the worst out of me
You turn me into a human being
With LOVE feelings
You turn me into a human being

Your hair's so dark and beautiful
It thrills me when you kiss me
What is this thing that they call
LOVE feelings
What is this thing that they call

You are the perfect compagny
You never argue with me
Mirror mirror on the wall
Share LOVE feelings

Are we tonight

Share LOVE feelings
