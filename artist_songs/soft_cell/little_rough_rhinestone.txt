Little rough rhinestone
Where will your love go today?
Sometimes you think
You had none to start with anyway

You will lose the deep pools
And the blues will cloud up
Your frightened little eyes
And the cold comes to claim you inside

You sit writing letters to imaginary friends
That you left behind in your mind
The deep dark red doorways
Call to a limbo of loneliness
Where a million rhinestones sit and cry

I never knew sorrow
Could hit me this way
I once had a friend
But he moved away
And even my mother
When she turned on me
Couldn't put emotion like this in me

Fist into glass into head (someone else's head)
They beat you up so badly
That your eyes
Show the look of the nearly dead
The wagon will come and scoop up
What's left of the sorry debris
And you'll take the place
Of a hundred other little Johnny's
That went the very same way

I never knew sorrow
Could hit me this way
I once had a friend
But he moved away
And even my mother
When she turned on me
Couldn't put emotion
Like this in me

And screaming out loud
He ran crashing through the crowd
He ran crashing through the crowd
He ran crashing through the crowd
Screaming
God if you're up there
I need you
Where are you?
I need you
Where are you?
I need you....
Where are you?
When I need you?
