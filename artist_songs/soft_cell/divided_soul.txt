Got my preacher in the kitchen
Got my dealer in the hall
I'm blind to the truth
Though I say I've seen it all
I'm always asking why
I want to laugh but I have to cry
Gonna live for the day
Looking for tomorrow
Gonna go off the rails if I don't find a god to follow

I know
I don't know which way to go
I'm living on the edge all the time going out of my mind
Oh yeah, I'm a divided soul

Got my lawyer in the bathroom
I've got a hooker in my bed
I'm taking medication
For the voices in my head
Got a holster on my shoulder
A bible in my hand
I'm the serpent in Eden
Praying for redemption
On evil I'll be feeding
To make my resurrection

I know
I don't know which way to go
I'm living on the edge all the time going out of my mind
Oh yeah, I'm a divided soul

I'm turning up the music
I'm drowning out the screams
I'm a man of passion
A child of apathy
Though I keep on running 
Life's catching up with me

I know
I don't know which way to go
I'm living on the edge all the time going out of my mind
Oh yeah, baby
I know
I don't know which way to go
I'm living on the edge all the time going out of my mind
Oh yeah yeah 
I know
I've not got long to go
I'm living on the edge all the time going out of my mind
Oh yeah, I'm a divided soul

I'm a risk taking
Danger loving
Chance risking
Trouble tasting
Liar a thief
An apostle of grief
I'm a killer or a lover
One or the other

Who the hell am I? 

I'm a divided soul
I'm a divided soul
I'm a divided soul
I'm a divided soul
We're all divided souls
Yeah, we're all divided souls
We're all divided souls
I'm a divided soul
Divided soul
