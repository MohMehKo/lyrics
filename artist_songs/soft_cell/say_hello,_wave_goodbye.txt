Standing in the door of the Pink Flamingo, crying in the rain
It was a kind of so-so love and I'm gonna make sure it never happens again
You and I, it had to be the standing joke of the year
You were a sleep around, a lost-and-found, and not for me I fear

I tried to make it work, you in a cocktail skirt, and me in a suit, well it just wasn't me
You're used to wearing less and now your life's a mess, so insecure you see
I put up with all the scenes and this is one scene that's going to be played my way

Take your hands off me
I don't belong to you, you see
Take a look at my face for the last time
I never knew you, you never knew me
Say hello, goodbye
Say hello, wave goodbye

Under the deep red light, I can see the make-up sliding down
Hey little girl, you will always make-up, so take off that unbecoming frown
What about me? Well, I'll find someone that's not going cheap in the sales
A nice little housewife, who'll give me a steady life and won't keep going off the rails

Take your hands off me
I don't belong to you, you see
Take a look at my face for the last time
I never knew you, you never knew me
Say hello, goodbye
Say hello, wave goodbye

We've been involved for quite a while now, and to keep you a secret, has been hell
We're strangers meeting for the first time, ok? Just smile and say hello...

Say hello, then wave goodbye
Say hello, then wave goodbye
Say hello, then wave goodbye
Say hello, then wave goodbye
Say hello, wave goodbye
Say hello, then wave goodbye
Say hello, say goodbye
Goodbye...
