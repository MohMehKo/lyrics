Oh... another day another way another life another day another life... 
of existence...
Oh fear threat and filth
Tender in hate
Slug and grab
Trap and take away
Another track
Meat rack and ruin
Boarded up and beaten up
Roaming the streets
Have no respect for a life
A limb a love
Whose love are you anyway?

Mother smiles
Narrow smiles
Drink up your poison
Like a good little girl
Can't have your coke
And beat it you know

'Sick of seeing you bruised and burnt out
Ugly and low'
So sick and tired
Of being sick and tired
Of being used and abused
That's right (that's right that's right that's right that's right that's right)

Pushing through the pavement sprawl
Round the late night supermarket
Dirtlocked lady
Who hits you in the chest
Give her all your money, Mr. Barefoot
All the year round
Please don't breathe on me
Oh and Hi there
Zizi Jean (night) mare

Still sticky from you
Still sticky from me
(I hear voices)
Still sticky from you
Still sticky from me
Smack kerpow!!
Into cold Greaseburger prance
Call me Chico Chico from Puerto Rico
Guilty of another cold handed sperm murder
Forever the crunch of makeup under foot

Where will you take me
When this is all over?
Somewhere where I don't have to
Shiver in the shadows...

So sick and tired
Of being used and abused

Everyday
You set up
Go to work
Floating like the ash
In the Coffee Pot caf√©
(that's right that's right that's right that's right that's right)

Throwing upon an over-diet
Of slob culture
Overdose and out
I'm scared for you
For me
For you... no...
For me
I got so tired of
Reading about the anguish of being
That I ended up being
Without
And where will you take me?
Where will you take me?
Away from this hell to be
(or not to be)
Pull up the vacancy sign in your eyes
I've seen it and I don't like it
I've seen it and I don't like it

I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired
Of being used and abused
Hey is this the last night in Sodom?
(that's right that's right that's right)

Sick and tired...

A day today of a life of existence

And his name... is Jesus
(You have never known love till you've known the love of god...
That's right)

Only god may find a way
Where there is no way
That's right....
Is this the last night in Sodom?

(You have never known love till you've known the love of god...
That's right)

What a waste...

And they never shed a tear
For Jesus Christ when he died on the cross
And they drove a spike in his side and hammered a crown of thorns on his head

What a waste...
