Lonely
I'd like to drown me in my coffee
Counting hours with cappuccinos
Sitting framed within the window

I'm lonely
I sit here acting like I'm reading
I'm reading minds
And sadly dreaming
There's some of me left to believe in

Surrender
Surrender

That businessman smell
Found in one night hotels
The sheets are unwashed
From the stories they tell
Tobacco and sweat
And initials in dust
The man at the desk
Throws you looks of disgust
Soon I'll try hard to lose you
Drown you in my cappuccino

Surrender
Surrender

Sodom and Gomorrah
Come tomorrow
I won't know you from Adam or Eve
Look me in the eyes
And tell me you love me
Once, before you leave

Surrender
Surrender
