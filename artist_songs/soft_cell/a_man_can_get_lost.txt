Out in the city
Out in the street
Isn't it pretty
Isn't it neat

I like the decor
I like the glass
Inside the dummies
Stare as I pass

Hi dear, bye dear
Get your and more
Hi dear, bye dear
Get your and more

I like the neon
(I look oh so hard)
I like the clash
(I find it so confusing)
I like the backdrops
(Street after street look so alike)
Window display
(Don't know just what I'm doing)

I like the products
(Seems like a maze to me)
I pay the price
(I feel the danger)
There are so many
(Nobody speaks to you)
A man could get lost
(When your a stranger)

Hi dear, bye dear
Get your and more
Hi dear, bye dear
Get your and more

And more

Out in the city
A man could get lost
Out in the neon
A man could get lost
A man could get lost
A man could get lost
A man could get lost
A man could get lost
A man could get lost
