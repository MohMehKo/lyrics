He's in a world of his own
He's in a world of his own
He'd like the time to play with his mind
He'd like the time to go
He sees the things that pass him by
And the things that he never owned
Everyone has and he has not
So he lives in a world of his own

He cries, he lies
He's cool, he's kind
He heads out on a Friday night,
He gets drunk and he starts a fight
And he loses his mind
And he loses his sight
Because times are hard
And money is tight
Because he has the pressure
He has the blame
Life never changes
Forever the same

He's in a world of his own
He has a child but he doesn't know
He wanted love, so he loved himself
And he's at an all-time low
He's in a world of his own
He's in a hell of his own
He watches the clock and watches the time
Watches life slip by on the assembly line
And the youth he's never known

He cries, he lies
He's cool, he's kind
He heads out on a Friday night,
He gets drunk and he starts a fight
And he loses his mind
And he loses his sight
Because times are hard
And money is tight
Because he has the pressure
He has the blame
Life never changes
Forever the same

Forever the same
Forever the same
