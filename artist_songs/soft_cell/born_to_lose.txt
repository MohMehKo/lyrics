That's the way you go
The city is so cold
And I, I'm so sold
That's why I go
I can't help it
Born to lose 
Born to lose
Born to lose
Baby I'm born to lose 
Baby I'm born to lose

Nothing to do
And nothing to say
There's only one thing that I want
It's the only way

I can't hit it
Born to lose 
Born to lose
Born to lose

Baby I'm born to lose 
Baby I'm born to lose

Living in a jungle
It ain't so hard
Living in the city
It'll eat out your heart

I can't hit it
Born to lose 
Born to lose 
Born to lose
Baby I'm born to lose 
Baby I'm born to lose
Baby I'm born to lose
Baby I'm born to lose
