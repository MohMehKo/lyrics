There’s something brilliant
In the way he wears his sins
Like a crown of thorns
A king of nothing
A war that no one wins

But every time I realize that I
Have seen this all before
Retrace the steps to faces that might
Lead to an open door

I’ve had enough
Of waiting for the perfect reason
Just to give you up
And all of your darkest secrets

There’s gotta be a way just show me
Can’t we both forget this all

Watch me give you up
And I’m spilling all your darkest
Spilling all your darkest secrets

There’s something brilliant
In the way she wears my sins
For the world to see she’s stronger now
With or without me

I can’t try to hide it
I wish that I could
Hate you with all of my bones
I really hope you saved the best for last

I’ve had enough
Of waiting for the perfect reason
Just to give you up
And all of your darkest secrets

There’s gotta be a way just show me
Can’t we both forget this all

Watch me give you up
And I’m spilling all your darkest
Spilling all your darkest secrets

Now I’m waking up
life goes on without you
I’m gonna take it back
Gonna make it last this time

Now I’m standing up
Life goes on without you
I’m make it back
Gonna leave the past behind
I’ve had enough
Of waiting for the perfect reason
Just to give you up
And all of your darkest secrets

There’s gotta be a way just show me
Can’t we both forget this all

Watch me give you up
And I’m spilling all your darkest
Spilling all your darkest secrets
