I've had it up to here with this
You're always calling
Girl, you're just tripping
No, I'm just falling
Over and over again
This change of heart is just
Is just a means to an end

This conversation just went dry
I know I'm crazy, I think I'm done wondering why
You know what you need to say
I haven't found a melody yet
A melody yet, a melody

All this time
We've been crossing off days
On the calendar pages
And all this time
Has been wasted, I'm wasted
Just thinking that this is the end

I've had it up to here with this shit
I'm always calling
Couldn't you just call someone else?
I bet you think it's funny how my voice stands out
When I'm talking to myself
You just keep pushing me farther and farther away
If you were never here
I'd bet you'd like it better that way
There's really nothing left to say
To me

This conversation just went dry
I know I'm crazy, I think I'm done wondering why
This conversation
I know I'm not a memory yet
A memory yet, a memory

All this time
We've been crossing off days
On the calendar pages
And all this time
Has been wasted, I'm wasted
Just thinking that this is the end

Come on now
Won't you come around baby?
Oh we can work it out
But I think I know better than that
This time you're just a pretty face
And you're just a line in a song

This was all wasted
Come on, just face it
This was all wasted
Come on, just face it
Oh let it go

This conversation just went dry
I know I'm crazy, I think I'm done wondering why
This conversation just went dry
I'm not a memory yet,a memory yet
A memory

All this time
We've been crossing off days
On the calendar pages
And all this time
Has been wasted, I'm wasted
And this is the end

All this time
We've been crossing off days
On the calendar pages
And all this time
Has been wasted, I'm wasted
Just thinking that this is the end

Come on now
Won't you come around baby?
Oh we can work it out
But I think I know better than that
This time you're just a pretty face
And you're just a line in a song
And you're just a line in a song
And you're just a line in a song
