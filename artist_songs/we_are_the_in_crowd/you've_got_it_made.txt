I can't sleep in my bed anymore.
My home says so little now.
Everyone's gone in mind.
And I paint myself in a corner.

You've got it made.
You've got it made.
You've got it made.
I'd love to be you so I don't have to feel this way.
Tell me are you happy now?
Tell me did it all work out?
It's too late.
It's too late.
But, do you feel the same?

I reach out to you for help.
I see myself in envy or do I admire how happy you are?
Either way I'd walk in your shoes.
But, she fits them better
She fits them better than...

You've got it made.
You've got it made.
You've got it made.
I'd love to be you so I don't have to feel this way.
Tell me are you happy now?
Tell me did it all work out?
It's too late.
It's too late.
But, do you feel the same?
Do you feel the same?

As my life hangs from a string.
And you have grabbed the scissors.
Was it just a summer fling?
As these flowers start to wither.
And no matter what I think.
As you will make decisions.
And I can't even blink cause I lost all my ambitions.

You've got it made.
You've got it made.
You've got it made.
I'd love to be you so I don't have to feel.

You've got it made.
You've got it made.
You've got it made.
I'd love to be you so I don't have to feel this pain.
Tell me are you happy now?
Tell me did it all work out?
It's too late.
It's too late.
But, do you feel the same?

She fits them better than.
She fits them better than me.
Do you feel the same?
