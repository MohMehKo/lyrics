I've seen the rise and the fall
The bitterness and all
The empty hearts that stopped
Before they left their mark

In this town your worst friends
Can be your best enemies
Share the same last wish, last names
It's all lies to keep you in line

So hang on, be strong
Long live the kids in us all
Pride may fail us
But God we will die trying

Hang on, be strong
Long live the kids in us all
Fate may cheat us
But God we will die trying

Hope, hey!

I've been the hope, and the doubt
The fear of breaking down
These insecurities until there's nothing left
(Until there's nothing left)

I wanna scream, I wanna live
I don't care who's listening
I won't wait my turn to be the ignorance
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
It's all lies to keep you in line

So hang on, be strong
Long live the kids in us all
Pride may fail us
But God we will die trying

Hang on, be strong
Long live the kids in us all
Fate may cheat us
But God we will die trying

You can't tell us no!
You can't tell us no!
No! No-oh!
You can't tell us no!
No! No-oh!
You can't tell us no!

You can't tell us no, no, no, no, no!

Hang on, be strong
Long live the kids in us all
Pride may fail us
But God we will die trying

Hang on, be strong
Long live the kids in us all
Pride may fail us
But God we will die trying

Hang on, be strong
Long live the kids in us all
Fate may cheat us
But God we will die trying
God we will die trying

No, no-oh!
You can't tell us no!
No, no-oh!
You can't tell us no!
No, no-oh!
You can't tell us no!
No, no-oh!
You can't tell us no!
