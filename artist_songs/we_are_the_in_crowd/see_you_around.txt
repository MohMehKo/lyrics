I got with a girl and started a war.
How could I know she was trouble? Oh.
I thought that I could ignore her.
Now I'm closer, but at least I'm not sleeping alone.

I gave him the world.
Showed him the door.
Now he should know how it feels to go.
I'm broken down on the surface.
I don't deserve this.
It's the last straw now.

Say goodbye to the night.
I'm getting into trouble and dancing with the devil.
If you want to fight.
Well, girl you must be dreaming.
I love to hear you screaming.
Well then I give up if you just stop this whole thing altogether.
You used to be my treasure.
What if I say goodbye for the last time?
I'm closer than you realize.

I traveled the world to forget about the girl.
How could I know she would follow me.
Wherever I go now, I don't how, but he's always there.

Say goodbye to the night.
I'm getting into trouble and dancing with the devil.
If you want to fight.
Well, girl you must be dreaming.
I love to hear you screaming.
Well then I give up if you just stop this whole thing altogether.
You used to be my treasure.
What if I say goodbye for the last time?
I'm closer than you realize.

Tell me how you feel about moving on without me now.
Go on, go on.
Shake it off and hold me down.
I don't want to see you around.

Well then I'll give up if you just stop this whole thing altogether.
You used to be my treasure.
