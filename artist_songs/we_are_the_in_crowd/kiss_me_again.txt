I gotta say something I've been thinking about
I can't wait to lay around with you
And tell you all the secrets I've been keeping to myself
It's been awhile since I've felt butterflies
Do you feel the same way too?
If every single second could last that much longer
Would you hold me?

And kiss me again underneath the moonlight
You're more than a friend, oh
I knew it from the first sight, yeah
Hold me, feel my heart beat
Put your arms around me
And kiss me again
And kiss me again

I gotta say I wasn't expecting you
To come this way and fall into my arms
And now I know I can't deny this feeling any longer
I close my eyes, I can't stop thinking about you
Crack a smile, I just can't lose
At a mile a minute my heart beats to the limit when I'm with you

So, kiss me again underneath the moonlight
You're more than a friend, oh
I knew it from the first sight, yeah
Hold me, feel my heart beat
Put your arms around me
And kiss me again

I can't let you go, can't let you float away
'Cause that would be a mistake
I'm not ready to run, can't let you go to waste
No, no, no, no

And kiss me again underneath the moonlight
You're more than a friend, oh
I knew it from the first sight, yeah
Hold me, feel my heart beat
Put your arms around me
Hold me, feel my heart beat
And put your arms around me
And kiss me again, and again, and again
Oh, kiss me again
