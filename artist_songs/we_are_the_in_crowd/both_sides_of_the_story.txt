If this is what you think is honest
Honestly, I think I'm gonna freak out
This isn't where I wanna be, wanna be
I think I'll let myself out
Show me the door, oh
'Cause I'm leaving the way I came in
With the mess I made
Tonight will be the one to set it off

We had our lights on the town
Your eyes were smiling then
You left me hanging around with all your wack friends
You don't take me serious
Boy, you make me furious
Guaranteed, we'll disagree

I found out finding out isn't the worst part
Don't believe it's just me
And I've found out
Do you really even have a clue?
You're not quite Satan, but I really think I hate you

We had our place in time, this is now that we spend
You've left me high and dry with all your stuck-up friends
You don't take me serious
Girl, you're just delirious
Guaranteed, we'll disagree

I found out finding out isn't the worst part
Don't believe it's just me
And I've found out
Do you really even have a clue?
You're not quite Satan, but I really think I hate you

You're not quite Satan, but I, I

I found out finding out isn't the worst part
Don't believe it's just me
And I've found out
Do you even fucking have a clue?
You're not quite Satan, but I really think I hate you
You're not quite Satan, but I
You're not quite Satan, but I really think I hate you
