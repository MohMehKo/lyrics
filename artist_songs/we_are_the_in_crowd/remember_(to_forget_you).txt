All my exes live in text,
It's just a symptom of the times
And these miscommunications
We can leave between the lines.

How do I know you and me won't make it if we don't try?
We're just stuck here in the mean time

I gotta remember to forget you
Cause you're always on my mind
I can never remember how I met you,
And every time I try

I can't find a way to cover your face
With the truth inside the lies
I gotta remember to forget you
Cause you're always on my mind

I've got a complex for every message
And I sit and wonder why
I've got letters stacked in boxes
And you're the subject every time

How do I know you and me won't make it if we don't try?
We're just stuck here in the mean time

I gotta remember to forget you
Cause you're always on my mind
I can never remember how I met you,
And every time I try

I can't find a way to cover your face
With the truth inside the lies
I gotta remember to forget you
Cause you're always on my mind

We're drowning in jealousy
Of people we wanna be
We're drowning in jealousy
Of people we wanna be

I can't stand to be myself
I could be anybody else
We're drowning in jealousy
Of people we wanna be

I'm so sick of being everything
To everyone but me.

I gotta remember to forget you
Cause you're always on my mind
I can never remember how I met you,
And every time I try

I can't find a way to cover your face
With the truth inside the lies
I gotta remember to forget you
Cause you're always on my mind

Cause you're always on my mind
