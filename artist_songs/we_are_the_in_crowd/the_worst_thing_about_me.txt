Does this mean that it's over and done with?
I was happy for so long.
Let's forget that I always forget
And I'd be happy to move on.
But, this time I'm not over it.

I guess you were always the worst thing about me.
Now I can see that you're not the real thing.
You keep me running back, running back.
This time it's not ending well.
And if you want me now, I'll make your life a living hell.

I got away from everything that made me think of you.
And now I'm back again to prove you wrong.
Because you were right about one thing.
I'd be coming back again, but you kept on running away.
But, this time I'm not over it.
(I'm not over it.)
No, this time I'm not over it.

I guess you were always the worst thing about me.
Now I can see that you're not the real thing.
You keep me running back, running back.
This time it's not ending well.
And if you want me now, I'll make your life a living hell.

I swear we could've been a sure thing.
I'm sorry that I wasn't the one.
I hate you for leaving, but you love to walk away.
Does this mean that it's over and done with?
I was happy, but I was wrong.

I guess you were always the worst thing about me.
Now I can see that you're not the real thing.
You keep me running back, running back.
This time it's not ending well.
