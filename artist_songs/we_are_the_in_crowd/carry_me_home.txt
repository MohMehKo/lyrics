Carry me home tonight,
Carry me home tonight,

I'm doing all I can,
Hoping that you'll ,
Stay wrapped up in innocence,
And dressed in all my plans

Tell me what,
You were thinking,
When you said,
You're better off without me,
Well I'm just a boy with a hole in my heart,
And I swear the world turns if it all falls apart

Carry me home tonight,
You had your chance but baby,
It's too late now,
Carry me home tonight,
No, no

I've done my best to find
A little piece of mind
Between these bedroom fights
And days that we were fine

Tell me what,
You were thinking,
When you said,
You're better off without me,
Well, I'm just a girl with a whole lot of heart,
And I know the world turns when it all falls apart,

Carry me home tonight,
You had your chance, but baby
It's too late now
Carry me home tonight,
No, no

Tonight let's play with hearts
Like the sand in our hands,
We both know the way that it ends
Carry me home tonight

Let's show this small town just what we're worth,
Bound for city lights, like satellites
We'll outshine the stars

Tonight let's play with our hearts
Carry me, carry me
Tonight let's play with out hearts
Carry me home
You had your chance, but baby
It's too late now,
Carry me home tonight,
Carry me, carry me
Tonight let's play with out hearts,
Like the sand in our hands,
We both know the way it ends,
Carry me home tonight,
You had your chance, but baby
It's too late now,
Carry me home tonight,
No, no
Tonight let's play with out hearts,
Like the sand in our hands,
We both know the way it ends,
I'll say I'm sorry,
But I don't feel sorry for you,
I'll say I'm sorry,
But I don't feel sorry for you,
Carry me home tonight
