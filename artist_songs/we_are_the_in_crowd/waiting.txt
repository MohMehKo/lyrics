I’m waiting
For the seasons to change
They keep fading
But I still feel the same
I keep breaking
And nothing’s gonna change my mind

I keep making
It up as I go
Always faking
A smile gets old
Give what I’m taking
Something…
Yeah something’s gonna change my mind

Waiting
To wake up where I’ve been dreaming of
Leave me
Inside a memory that you made up

Don’t tell me
(they’ll all just try to change you)
and control me
(they’ll break you down and rearrange you)

Someone show me something
That I can believe in
Cause I can’t show myself

Waiting
To wake up where I’ve been dreaming of
Leave me
Inside a memory that you made up

I’m done living inside your head
Save your secondhand love songs
Just put em’ to rest

I’m waiting
To wake up where I’ve been dreaming of

Someone told me
I think you’ve said enough
The enemy is me
I’m getting sick of when you
Come around, come around
My head
I’m gonna lock you out, lock you out
But I still feel the same

Waiting
To wake up where I’ve been dreaming of
Leave me
Inside a memory that you made up

I’m done living inside your head
Save your secondhand love songs
Just put em’ to rest

I’m waiting
To wake up where I’ve been dreaming of
