I remember the nights we spent under city lights
This feelings got the best of me
We were floating along to the sounds of a dead end town
but now that's just a memory

I can't figure you out, you've got more fight in you
than anybody else
And here's the part where I start to make my own damn decisions
and make a name for my self

I'll never be what you want
I wouldn't change any part of me
Just to make you stay
You had a piece of my heart
But not enough to just run away
'Cause I know what's best for me

Take all your big plans and throw them away
I've got something in mind before we go separate ways 
We ask the questions baby,
Who provides the answers?

I'm scared to death and it shows
The flame burned out, but it glows
And the look in your eyes says things I don't wanna know
It's time to go!
Come closer!
And I can't say anything, everything comes out the wrong way

I'll never be what you want
I wouldn't change any part of me
Just to make you stay
You had a piece of my heart
But not enough to just run away
'Cause i know what's best for me

Just try, just try a little harder
I'll do my best explaining all the things I'm going through
Just try, just try a little harder
This is why I can't adjust for you

You can't say
The look in your eyes says things I don't wanna know
No you, You can't stay

I wanna be with you, and no one else
I need you to feel the way that you felt that summer night
when you found that puzzle piece missing for eight straight weeks
You're not the perfect fit

I'll never be what you want
I wouldn't change any part of me
Just to make you stay
You had a piece of my heart
But not enough to just run away
'Cause I know what's best for me
