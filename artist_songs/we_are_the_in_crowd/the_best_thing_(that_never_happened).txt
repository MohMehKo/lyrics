(Ow, ooh)

I let you get away with
Thinking you're the cure
I think I'm in too deep
It's time to pull the cord

You like me more when you think
I'm getting bored
I hope you're home the day I
Tear down the walls

I won't settle, settle, settle
You are never gonna hold me down
So toxic, you ain't nothin' but a prick
I'm the best thing that never happened to ya

Never, never, never
You are never gonna live this down
Life's too short, I can't fake it anymore
I'm the best thing that never happened to ya

(Ooh)

Don't you get sick of only
Hearing your own voice
Talk like you're so damn tough
But you're just a little boy

You like to think you broke the mold
But now I'm sure
You'll crack just like the rest when I
Break your fucking jaw

I won't settle, settle, settle
You are never gonna hold me down
So toxic, you ain't nothin' but a prick
I'm the best thing that never happened to ya

Never, never, never
You are never gonna live this down
Life's too short, I can't fake it anymore
I'm the best thing that never happened to ya

(Ooh, hahahaha, ow)

I won't settle
I won't settle
I won't settle

I won't settle, settle, settle
You are never gonna hold me down
So toxic, you ain't nothin' but a prick
I'm the best thing that never happened to ya

Never, never, never
You are never gonna live this down
Life's too short, I can't fake it anymore
I'm the best thing that never happened to ya

(Ooh, whoa)
