Seems like a dream
Awakened before it was done
How could this be?
I walk alone
But sometimes I picture your hands
Held in my own
My brave face is too late now

If you could see me now
Would you be pleased and proud?
I'm doing fine, but sometimes I cry
When I see your face
Are there windows in heaven?
To see me now
Through all the sky and clouds
Living my life
With a heart full of pride
When I see your face
Are there windows in heaven?

You didn't leave
But you left behind more than you know
More than I see
I still can't let go
Your image I can't say goodbye
Here from below
My brave face is too late now

If you could see me now
Would you be pleased and proud?
I'm doing fine, but sometimes I cry
When I see your face
Are there windows in heaven?
To see me now
Through all the sky and clouds
Living my life
With a heart full of pride
When I see your face

Take me back to the time
Together we'd sing out
Together we'd live out
All of the rest of our lives
For just one more minute
I can't get you in it
One moment to fill in
Last time face it's too late now

If you could see me now
Would you be pleased and proud?
I'm doing fine, but sometimes I cry
When I see your face
Are there windows in heaven?
To see me now
Through all the sky and clouds
Living my life
With a heart full of pride
When I see your face
Are there windows in heaven?
