Here we go again,
It’s like you’re calling all the shots before I shoot them.
And I hate that.
Every time I turn my back I wonder what you’ll
say to make me sound like someone different.
It’s not worth it anymore.

We’ve been picking up the pieces leaving all the dust behind.
Sick of all the pressure, you’re just wasting time
And I don’t ever wanna know what it feels like to be a shadow of myself.
And I don’t ever wanna come back down from this feeling.
What makes you think that you know what’s better for me?
And I don’t think you wanna see what’s underneath your made up version of me.

There you go again believing that the truth is what you’re reading.
Talk some shit I haven’t heard before.
If you’ve got something to say.
Don’t wanna talk about it.
If you need someone to blame.
Go on and cry about it.
I measure life in minutes, but these critics think they’ve got me figured out.

We’ve been picking up the pieces leaving all the dust behind.
Sick of all the pressure, you’re just wasting time.
And I don’t ever wanna know what it feels like to be a shadow of myself.
And I don’t ever wanna come back down from this feeling.
What makes you think that you know what’s better for me?
And I don’t think you wanna see what’s underneath your made up version of me.

I lost the strength to keep my grip on the reality that
Every thought from day to day is fading from my memory.
But, I’ll never let this grow out of my control.
And watch your step so you don’t fall into this hole you dug alone.
This hole you dug alone.

And I don’t ever wanna know what it feels like to be a shadow of myself.
And I don’t ever wanna come back down from this feeling.
What makes you think that you know what’s better for me?
And I don’t think you wanna see what’s underneath your made up version of me.
Your made up version of me.
