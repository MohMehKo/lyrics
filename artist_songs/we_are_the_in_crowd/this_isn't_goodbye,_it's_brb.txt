This isn’t me
And I hate what we’ve become
This isn’t my life
And I don't know where it went wrong

Wait and see
We’ll figure it out
Then we’ll skip this town
You know you’re better off with me
We’ve been broken for so long

So we will drive as far as we know
We’ve got but one mile to go
This is our fight
We can’t break this time
We’ve got all night

Well giving up is easy, you play it safe
You'll be a memory reminding me to learn from my mistakes
Slow down keep an eye on what you're after
Face down with your back to the disaster
No one said we ever had to change

So we will drive as far as we know
We’ve got but one mile to go
This is our fight
We can’t break this time
We’ve got all night

So we will drive as far as we know
We’ve got but one mile to go
This is our fight
We can’t break this time
We’ve got all night

I take back everything
This isn't what you think
We’ll go right back to how we were
You've got me in knots
(This isn't easy)
Thinking that this is all you'd hope for.
I'd take it all back.
(There's nothing left to say)
I'd take it all back.
I'd take it all back.

So we will drive as far as we know
We’ve got but one mile to go
This our fight
We can’t break this time
We’ve got all night
All night, whoa

So we will drive as far as we know
We’ve got but one mile to go
This is our fight
We can’t break this time
We’ve got all night
Yeah!
We’ll never know
