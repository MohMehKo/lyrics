I think I’ve seen you before
Another time, another face
Whoever opened the door
Never had the time to waste

To paint pictures over windows
That don’t satisfy our taste
It’s so convenient to lose the truth
When it’s laughing in your face

Destiny is overrated
So I think I’ll write my own
I don’t believe it’s complicated
So I think I’ll stay at home
I followed the leader
Now I just follow myself
Destiny is overrated
So I think I’ll write my own

I know I’ve been here before
But I can’t find, the time or place
If we stay in the past
There’ll be no future left to waste

Pinning paper wings on problems
Hoping that they’ll fly away
Turn our backs, ignore the truth
If they can’t support the weight

Destiny is overrated
So I think I’ll write my own
I don’t believe it’s complicated
So I think I’ll stay at home
I followed the leader
Now I just follow myself
Destiny is overrated
So I think I’ll write my own

Reflections on a two way mirror
Of everyone and everything
That’s coming, and coming out
Of our lives
I can see myself in the static
I can see myself in you
Reflections on a two way mirror
Times running out, times running out

Destiny is overrated
So I think I’ll write my own
I don’t believe it’s complicated
So I think I’ll stay at home
I followed the leader
Now I just follow myself
Destiny is overrated
So I think I’ll write my own
So I think I’ll write my own
