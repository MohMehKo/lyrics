Some say I'm insane,
Others say I'm deranged,
But these days I would rather do nothing.

All damn night,
And all damn day,
Because of you, bitch, I would rather do nothing

And either way,
Something needs to change,
But what's this you say,
That we need a break

I used to be
All you would need
You always tease,
But you never leave,
You're the picture perfect girl,
And I'm the frame,

Someday, far away,
Yeah I'll know what to say
Until then, I'd rather say nothing,

I called you twice,
To hear you say,
I love your taste, but you didn't say nothing,

And either way,
Somethings needs to change,
But what's this you say,
That we need a break

I used to be
All you would need
You always tease,
But baby you never leave
You're the picture perfect girl,
And I'm the frame,

I used to be
All you would need
You always tease,
But baby you never leave
You're the picture perfect girl,
And I'm the frame,

My friends they all warned me about you,
I can't stand to be around you,
But day and night I think about you,
Oh no, oh no

My friends they all warned me about you,
I can't stand to be around you,
But day and night I think about you,
Oh no, oh no

And either way,
Something needs to change,
But what's this you say,
That we need a break

I used to be,
All you would need,
You always tease,
But baby you never leave,
You're the picture perfect girl,
And I'm the frame,

Some say I'm insane,
Other say I'm deranged,
But these days I would rather do nothing.
