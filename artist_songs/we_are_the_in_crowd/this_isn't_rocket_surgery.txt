And now I know just how it feels to be alone
(Alone and so damn scared)
It's like I can't even breathe, it's all this anxiety
It's killing me

And after all these times, we let this replay
Nothing's changed, we still do it the same way

I love that you've got me all figured out
Because without a doubt
You're the best damn thing that ever happened to me

Now we're moving on
You just don't understand
It's not that hard to comprehend

And after all these times, we let this replay
Nothing's changed, we still do it the same way

I love that you've got me all figured out
Because without a doubt
You're the best damn thing that ever happened to me
I'm going crazy, just can't get it out of my head
Before I lose it
I just might lose it
And I bet you like that
Yeah you like that

You just don't wanna know
The things I had to let go
What's it gonna take to get you back here with me

I love that you've got me all figured out
Because without a doubt
You're the best damn thing that ever happened to me
I'm going crazy, just can't get it out of my head
Before I lose it
I just might lose it
And I bet you like that
Yeah you like that

Can't get it out of my head
Get it out of my head...
