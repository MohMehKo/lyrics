I've got a way with words
and it's the cause of all my problems
I've got my mind set
and that's the way it is
I never thought it could get this bad
when I had you in my pocket everything was just fine and...

You've got a big mouth
and the streets are talking
about the way you walk around like you own the place
you've got a big mouth
and you shoulda shut it
yeah, you shoulda shut it in the first place

just, take another look at the risks we took
and all the things i said
what were they really worth

you're all talk, you can't act
like you're calling the shots
I'm the only thing that you've got

We don't have anywhere to go but up
so sit back and watch us fall
take it back, don't react
don't ever forget
we'll make it by

I can't take another second of this goddamn town
it's getting harder to sing...
dodo do do do dodo
These melodies of settling are starting to sting

and everybody's talking like they know it all
conducting social symphonies
you're all talk
you can't act like you're calling the shots
I'm the only thing left you got

We don't have anywhere to go but up
so sit back and watch us fall
take it back, don't react
don't ever forget
we'll make it by

We don't have anywhere to go but up
so sit back and watch us fall
take it back, don't react
don't ever forget
we'll make it by

you've got a big mouth
and the streets are talking
about the way you walk around like you own the place
you've got a big mouth
and you shoulda shut it
yeah, you shoulda shut it in the first place

everybody's got me looking in the wrong direction
(all eyes on you, they're looking out for me)

We don't have anywhere to go but up
so sit back and watch us fall
take it back, don't react
don't ever forget
we'll make it by

We don't have anywhere to go but up
so sit back and watch us fall
take it back, don't react
don't ever forget
we'll make it by

I can't take another second of this goddamn town
it's getting harder to sing...
