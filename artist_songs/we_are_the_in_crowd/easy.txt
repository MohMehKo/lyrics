Baby we don't have to say goodnight
I just stop the tape and press rewind
Not anyone or anything about you
Could ever change these feelings

Let's be all of the things they said we couldn't be
Let's take a chance, let's make it right
You're the only thing keeping me going tonight

Yeah I would do things that you couldn't say no to
(Couldn't say no to)
Just hold on tight, I'll treat you right
I promise I'll get you home safe tonight

And I don't know about you
But I am so into the things we do
It's a broken heart that scares me
(You have nothing to fear, I'll stay with you my dear)
It's a broken heart that scares me

Yeah I would do things that you couldn't say no to
(Couldn't say no to)
Just hold on tight, I'll treat you right
I promise I'll get you home safe tonight

I just can't stand to be myself
You could be anyone else
We've got all night to see
If this is meant to be
Just let go, leave your drama in the backseat
Just let go, just let go of it
You make this so damn easy

Yeah I would do things that you couldn't say no to
(Couldn't say no to)
Just hold on tight, I'll treat you right
I promise I'll get you home safe tonight
