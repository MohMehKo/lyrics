So we stand here with our lives packed up in boxes.
Wonder how did we get here?
And something I said got back to this dirty apartment.
Wonder how did we get here?
Did something change your mind?
Cause I can't look you in the eye.
I'm gonna break tonight.

I've gotta be on my way.
Cause everything's gonna change.
And you never thought I'd say that you wouldn't know me anyway.

Tell him I said that I tossed out all those boxes.
Now they're out in the pouring rain.
You can tell her I swear the next time she sees Jordan.
I'll let her know that I know I changed my mind.
Cause I can't look you in the eye.
I'm gonna break tonight.

I've gotta be on my way.
Cause everything's gonna change.
And you never thought I'd say that you wouldn't know me anyway.
I've gotta be on my way.
Cause everything's gonna change.
And you never thought I'd say that you wouldn't know me anyway.

My friends all told me not to look into your eyes.
Cause life's too short, yeah, to waste my time.
So what's it gonna be now, baby.
Aye, aye.
Did something change your mind?
I'm on my way tonight.

I've gotta be on my way.
Cause everything's gonna change.
And you never thought I'd say that you wouldn't know me anyway.
I've gotta be on my way.
Cause everything's gonna change.
And you never thought I'd say that you never loved me anyway.
