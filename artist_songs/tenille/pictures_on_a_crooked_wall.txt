Jenny came to school today, every single hair in place
Put her pencils in a row, Jenny's got it in control
If only anybody knew what she's really going through
A perfect image but it's all pictures on a crooked wall

Like pictures on a crooked wall they never will be straight
She'll try to keep her world in line till something falls and breaks
How much can she take?

She goes home blinds are drawn
Sink is full, TV's on
Looks around mom's not there
Cat's curled up in daddy's chair
Little brother is in his room
She tells him that dinner's soon
One girl trying to fix it all, pictures on a crooked wall

Like pictures on a crooked wall they never will be straight
She'll try to keep her world in line till something falls and breaks
How much can she take?

With no foundation
How can she bear such a load
It would be too much for anyone to face alone
And she's so alone

Like pictures on a crooked wall they never will be straight
She'll try to keep her world in line till something falls and breaks
Like pictures on a crooked wall they never will be straight
She'll try to keep her world in line till something falls and breaks
And it's gonna fall and break

Jenny came to school today, every single hair in place
A perfect image but it's all pictures on a crooked wall.
