I need us in the same page
So tired of this blame game
Seems like we are miles apart
But boy you are still the king of hearts
Can't deny it I love it
But tonight we will share
Cause every time you are gone I bleed
The same regret the same apology

[Chorus]
And I need for us to get this right
You still dream of me and why
Let's throw our pride off the window

Cause we don't got nothing
If don't have loving
That's how it's supposed to me
I need you close to me
Our hearts are in the same place
But we circle in the same drain
You are the king of my heart
It's now or ever cause we are dyeing
Give me the kiss of my reviving
Kiss off my life
Every time I hear this song
It reminds me how far are you from me
Boy we need a change

[Chorus]

This could be how it used to be

If we just forget it all

Back in the days I will pray
To hear you say so I waited and waited
But still I got the same crap
Maybe I lost faith
But you ain't made it easy for me
Sorry I was threat it poorly
So why repeat the story
I gave you chances and plenty of opportunities
For you to speak the truth and see that you was not .. of me
Foolishly I let you do that I was real humble
What still trembles me I still love you

Girl you'll never know what we could have been
We should've been happy
Hurts when you ask me
I awe you and me marry
Couple of kids in the back seat
But now it's all done and I don't think I will think that way again
[repeats]

I don't think I will think that way again [repeats]

We can feel that way again boy
