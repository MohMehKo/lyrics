Dear heart, I'm sorry,
I know we had a deal.
I should be listening to you.
Dear heart, I'm breaking
A rule I swore I'd never break.
But there's nothing I can do.

I'm already fallin', fallin'
Yeah, I just couldn't wait.
Or maybe you're right, I'm wrong
And I'm halfway to "it's too late."
I know what you're thinkin', I'm sinkin'
But it sure don't feel that way.
You can say "I told you so" if it falls apart
Dear heart
Dear heart

I know, you're only looking out for me.
And he just came out of the blue.
Sayin' the sweetest things I've ever heard
You don't believe him but I do.

I'm already fallin', fallin'
Yeah, I just couldn't wait.
Or maybe you're right, I'm wrong
And I'm halfway to "it's too late."
I know what you're thinkin', I'm sinkin'
But it sure don't feel that way.
You can say "I told you so" if it falls apart
Dear heart

Dear heart, I'm sorry...

I'm already fallin', fallin'
Yeah, I just couldn't wait.
Or maybe you're right, I'm wrong
And I'm halfway to "it's too late."
I know what you're thinkin', I'm sinkin'
But it sure don't feel that way.
You can say "I told you so" if it falls apart
And I should've listened to you right from the start
Dear heart
Dear heart
