This is it love
It's what dreams are made of
But its still up to us to feel the rush
To pursue all the things only Gods can touch
I wanna meet the odds with royal flush
To fall
I gave my all 
But it wasn't enough
I'm never giving up I found life
So I've gotta live it up 
And life is too short for war
What can I say to show theres more
With people slammin doors in my face and what for
That aint the way to gain plays
By making the same mistake day after day
I gotta slide man get away the smile on my face its a sunny day girls and drinks and more drinks 
Come to think
For such a big place its a small world
For such a rat race i still got faith
And anything goes still I got to say life has its ups and downs but I love it anyway
