[Chorus:]

Everything I do, I do for you,
And I could never live my life without,
And late at night when I dream about you,
I've heard of special, nothin special like you,
And everything I do, I do for you,
And I could never live my life without,
And late at night when I dream about you,
I've heard of special, nothin special like you,

[Verse 1:]

I see ya everywhere I go, and you're uncomparable,
To any of these other pretty girls I know,
And when you walk into the room, girl you steal the show,
You try to act like you're normal but you're finer than you know, cause,
Everyone looks when you cross a room,
One look and I was hooked like b-real to boom,
Cause you play hard to get, which I really respect, 
Lipstick like a red corvette, with intellect,
Gimme the time, any time, I'm sure we'll connect, 
I'm sure we'll get down, and time will perfect,
Cause I want you, girl I want you now,
I'll do everything right the first time around,
I wanna, sex you up and lick you down,
I said I want you, let me love you now
I wanna, sex you up, let me hold it down,
I said I want you girl let me love you now.

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]

I can't remember where we met, it's all just a blur,
But I know what I want, I've never been so sure,
You're like a treasure, so innocent and pure,
You become the addiction that my doctor can't cure,
My friends talk, I don't listen cause they're missing the point,
They'll never undestand us like I do, I'm after you,
Cause you're special, you make me think of sexual things,
Just a boy and a girl, just a king and his queen, 
Only a person that has felt love would know what I mean,
Cause you got what it takes to make my heart sing,
Baby make no mistake, you're the girl of my dreams,
The kinda girl that I could love, that I'd put on my team,
You could be my candy girl, the sparkle in my eye,
My inspiration arm in arm, girl I need you by my side,
I wanna sex you up, let me hold it down,
I said I want you girl, let me love you now, 
And everything I do, I do for you,
And I could never live my life without,
And late at night when I dream about you,
I've heard of special, nothin special like you.

And everything I do, I do for you, 
And I could never live my life without,
And late at night when I dream about you,
I've heard of special, nothin special like you,
And no one knows ya quite like I do,
I've heard of special, nothin special like you,
And no one knows ya quite like I do,
I've heard of special, nothin special like you

(Special, you're so special, special, you're so special, special) 
(ah ah, ah ah, ah ah,)
(Yea! Believe me. I know special when I see it. And nothing's special like you)
