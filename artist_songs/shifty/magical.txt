She's magical, magical
The girl's got a spell on me
Oh yeh! Oh yeh!
She's magical, magical
A modern day wizardry
Oh yeh! Oh yeh!

Now she's a heart stopper
Jaw dropper for real
Baby steals my breath with the sex appeal
She's everything I ever wanted and more
She makes me feel like a kid in a candy store
An like a rabbit out of a hat
She's a disappearing act
I wink inside the mirror
And she always winks back
I'm in room 32
You can come up an see me
I make your bikini disappear like Houdini
It's our time no times better than now
You can bite, scratch me an throw me around
You might be the prettiest thing I ever saw
Looking like that should be against the law
She's just my taste got a face to match
I said, "this is one girl I got to catch"
You might be the one who could set me free
So lets work it out
Work your magic on me

Sexy girl you got a spell on me
You got me running up the street like a dog in heat
You're such an inspiration
You got my heart racing
Got me levitating with your sex education
Tell me is it real or just my imagination
Are you looking for love?
Well I'm over here waiting
Baby on the real
Can you feel the chemistry?
No smoke an mirrors
I believe what I can see
I believe in you
Now could you believe in me?
I feel the energy
You wanna be my fantasy
Hey pretty girl
Come give me a kiss?
It ain't hard to do
It's as easy as this
Put your lips to my lips
Put your hands on my side
Move your body closer and look into my eyes
I got a heart made of gold an a bottle full of brew
The only thing I'm missing is you
