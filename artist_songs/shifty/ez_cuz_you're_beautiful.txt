Lovin' you, is easy cause you're beautiful,
Do do doot da doo, ahhhah, ahhhah, ahhhhh
Come on

[Verse 1:]

Now girl you're beautiful, so beautiful, It tears me up like what, 
no matter how much I get, it never seems to be enough,
We've had our, ups and downs, our highs and lows,
And everytime we fight it's like more of the truth's exposed,
But you know, that's just the way love goes, 
If I wasn't passionate about it baby than I wouldn't explode,
Oh, oh, temper, temper, well here we go again,
Cause I'm your lover, your protector, and your very best friend,
There ain't a doubt in my mind, that we weren't meant to be,
Baby girl, you're so fine feel my frequency,
I want ya, next to me for the rest of my life,
I'm singing "No more lonely nights!" like Bob Marley,
"Everything is gonna be alright!" 
said I want you by my side til the day that I die,
We can drink, get high, We can dance all night,
Under the moonlight, tongue and cheek gotcha freakin' on me,
Baby please!

[Chorus:]

Lovin' you, is easy cause you're beautiful,
Do do doot da doo, ahhhah, ahhhah, ahhhhh

[Verse 2:]

Now when the sky is fallin down, girl I found that you're the cure,
Cause you're the only thing that's real when I'm feelin' insecure,
You're always, there for me when I need someone to care for me,
Apparently, you made the right move, rather carefully,
So til the end I'm lovin' you, kissin' you and huggin' you,
Even though your friends have got a different point of view,
And after everything that we've been through, it's really easy lovin' you,
It's true, my heart has got the scars to prove,
I'm obsessed with you and everything you do,
It's magical, it brings me close to you, close is true, I don't know what you do,
And I remember when we started, everything was so real,
There's no words to express the way you made me feel,
And lovin' you ain't hard, it's easy cause you're beautiful,
And who knows what's coming next, our sex is like a ritual,
Ooo-cha Baby girl you got a place in my heart, 
You either hold my life together or you break it apart,

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]

You really got a hold on me,
Don'tchya ever let go,
Don'tchya, let me be til I tell you so,
You're on my mind, all the time, it's so controlable,
Cause you're oh so fine, and I'm claiming you now,
Whoa-oh, Hang-on, how low will I go?
How high can I get? I've lost all control, 
Whoa-oh, Hey-look, How far will we go? 
You gotta hold on my soul don't you ever let go.

[Chorus]

Lovin' you, ahhhah, ahhhah, ahhhah, ahhhah, ahhhhh
Do do doot da doo, ahhhah, ahhhah, ahhhhh
