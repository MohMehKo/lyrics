[chorus]
Oh Lolita
Girl ya make it so hot
It's likes I got a fever
Oh Lolita
I think I need ya now
I could tickle your pink
If ya let me get down

I see a dancer by the juke box, drinking sangria
Down in Mexico where the carbo cantina
I said "hey senorita come an dance with me"
If ya haven't got a man thats what I plan to be
Now move a little closer
Put your hands on my body
Im trapped in the moment, I can hardly breathe
A combination of you plus some melody
Got me feeling like tonight might be meant to be

She looked at me, like I looked at her
Then she licked my lips, I said "it's on for sure"
Now baby dont stop, Im feeling you
Cant put my finger on one thing
Its everything you do
I say we have a drink or two
Just to set the mood
An head down to the beach on a rendezview
We can dance on the stars
Swing from the moon
From Carbosanlucas all the way to Kankoon

[chorus]
Oh Lolita
Girl ya make it so hot
It's likes I got a fever
Oh Lolita
I think I need ya now
I could tickle your pink
If ya let me get down

First I think its over
Then she does it again
She makes me feel so good
I dont want it to end
An I cant pretend I dont feel the way I do
My eyes used to wander
Now I've only eyes for you
Your a breath of fresh air
A dream come true
I might have come with my friends
But Im leaving with you
Ain't a doubt in my mind
Its about that time
We head back to my room
An begin to unwind
I can take off your clothes
You can take off mine
I'll stand and deliver
Sending shivers up your spine
There's no need to rush
We can kiss an touch
Rock around the clock
Yeh baby dont stop
Cause you make it so hot
Your mind likes a ?? and loves all I got
Is all we got
Is all we need
So you just come with me an see
I could blow your mind or my pretty baby

Oh Lolita
Girl ya make it so hot
It's likes I got a fever
Oh Lolita
I think I need ya now
I could tickle your pink
If ya let me get down

[TC]
Oh Lolita
I cant let you go
We're moving so fast
We cant take it slow
Oh Lolita
I can blow your mind
Why dont you come with me
We could spend some time
Oh Lolita
Wont you come with me
I wanna show you how fun life can be
I wanna show you all the things you've never seen
Grab a hold of my body
Spend the night with me
