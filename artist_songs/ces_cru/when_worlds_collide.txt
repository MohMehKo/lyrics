[Godemis]
Uh-huh
Nose full of Katy Perry rolling riding shotgun,
Acting like I ain't got sense cause I ain't got none
No religious bitches in my circle I ain't got none
Gotta leave a crater in this game before the clocks done

[Ubiquitous]
Now watch where we headed, taking shots come and get it
hip hop (hip hop) menace
some said we never should've got breaded let it fly
Moving through the sky, losing sight of us
My predecessors accepting my destiny's Midas' touch

[Godemis]
Mouth stuffed with ecstasy, in a state of nirvana
With a belly full of molly I'm puffin this marijuana
I got anoâ€”nother one
I am honoured, your honour, honestly
The way they hate on Gode and Ubi is fuckin' comedy

[Ubiquitous]
The combinations so uncommon to cause a company
To covet me, and cover my cost, cousin, now come at me
My blood's running, I'm 100, no matter what it seem
I've done nothing but crush, whatever the fuck was in front of me

[Godemis]
Shots, pictures, naked pics
Yeah, we're on some sicker shit
Shooting up, with the reverend, he's a flipping hypocrite
Bathing in the bath salts, loofa made of entrails
Seems to be I die in every other role like Denzel

[Ubiquitous]
Ubi, suicide, divine, why they shoot at me
You and I, cru is unified, minor scrutiny
Suit and tie, execute a trooper, incite a mutiny
Doing time, humans euthanized by the truth in me

[Godemis]
Okay, I'm zoned out, turned up, wildin out, wavy
Rolling up the purple bumping Brenda's got a baby
Working for no money isn't funny, it is slavery
I'm heading for oblivion and can't nobody save me

[Ubiquitous]
P-planetary collision, inner vision apocalypse
Demonology monetary toppled metropolis
Inequality, military coddle the populace
Mephistopheles, headed full throttle for opulence

[Godemis]
Corner offices, sexy secretaries and emails
Demonic packages are delivered minus the details
3 rails, later I pop it without a second look
This roll is for the chicken, this carnage is for the record book

[Ubiquitous]
Tell my mamma I'm sorry my job is so obnoxious
Body full of toxins I probably will never process
Paradigm shiftin', stiffin' up, catch a witch's ride
Wishin' I would switch it up different, but why simplify?

[Godemis]
Too fly, launch pad, crash land, I'mma wreck it
Looking for the black box, FBI search method
Soul of Saddam, I'm the motherfucking bomb, check it
Inspiration of Hitler, Bruce Lee's work ethic

[Ubiquitous]
Sun Tzu manifested, Dali Lama mind state
Hijack a G6, tripping, tryna fly straight
Spun a lie, wonder why they wonder why I'm irate
Violation summon my emotion, I annihilate

[Godemis]
Bite a bait, get 'em to bite it and I might could buy the weight
As soon as we start eating, these suckers are gonna try to hate
I relate, hard to see people do better than you
Strangers form a line outside hours 'fore we open the venue

[Ubiquitous]
Let me continue, feel the bad vibe callin', I might could dial it back
Motherfucker rapper talking bout I want my style back
Punks ice grillin' me, I smile back, I relax
Hired for my prior stats, why attack? Fire back!

[Godemis]
Tires flat, footing it, pure fuckery, I am that
People think this shit's a result of me smoking fire crack
Fade to black, free bassin in the back of a ratty shack
Killer city's misery is one hell of a habitat

[Ubiquitous]
Whats been happenin'? Now they askin' me what got into me?
Galvanized the lives of whoever's in my proximity
L-l-lock, stock, artillery, cock and aim at the industry
Paint a picture of pain and pleasure inside a symphony

[Godemis]
We got the chemistry on a struggle for constant energy
My aura's looking more like the color of what a killer's be
Killer beat nothin' to fornicate with a killer bee
The pen and pad's the remedy for whatever is illin me

[Back and forth between them, first Ubiquitous, then Godemis]
Philistines lurking in silhouette, get the guillotine

Stomping out ya day-mares, then we coming to kill a dream

Snap awake

Activate

All civilians evacuate

Ba-back away

Pack a 9

Sacrifices we had to make

Strapped for time

Apex predator bout to gravitate, back to shine

Fall outta place, I'mma put 'em back in line

Back inside of my lane

Fraternizing with fame

I shoot it rapid fire at ya brain

We masterminding the game
