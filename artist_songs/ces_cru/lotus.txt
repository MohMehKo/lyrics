CES CRU music coming up out your speaker 
the devils in the mirror prayin to God scrubbing his features 
he came a hell of the way battling squads murdering features, 
in the way that he's been doing it makes it hard for niggas to keep her, 
they might be local for ever but tech swooped em, 
for murderin everything in the middie Duke Nukem. 
these suckers, throwin caution oto wind we might slaughter. 
but just to set it off once again, be like water 
don't focus on the finger, miss all heavenly glory 
those rounds are fucking recycled no wonder you niggas bore me, pour me, 
sucking me dry and my energy can't stop, 
weave deversify the label, they lablein strange HOT!! 
my angels preyin the demons, I'm wavein that's why I'm leanin 
chug up a cup of blood now its somthing to put the lean-(syrup) in
meanin I'm whilen and out for the night 
and I'm writing likeing it like it or not I'm right in the light and I'm likeing it
fighting em like a lykin 
if I try then I might win 
parasail them parel in soon as I catch the right wind 
But to be one of the greatest it's to be hated 
took a look around the room and it feels like I finally made it, 

We graduated from the block with the full ride 
cover the country side to the stage where we don't play games, 
now come alive, shut my eyes, thinking, what if we never make it 
all of the years that we invested or wasted
let's coming up close, I can see, told me to look but I don't touch 
told me to touch but don't taste, 
I've been starving for years, homie you're stuffing your face, 
rather I work like a slave, then to be stuck in no place 
and seein nothing no way, I'm freeing up my soul, 
came with all my chakras aligned, 
how could they possibly think I be falling off in my prime 
strange gave me my shot, I saught it off for the nine, 
patiently waiting my turn and you knoded off in the line, 
homie, they you're calling your number, during your slumber I shine, 
snatch it up what's it's mine 
that class that come from behind when 
I'm catching that high wind, my weapon is silent 
you can hear what I'm thinking inside this deafening silence 
two hands on the clock, 
never forget what the time is, 
meditation affect and perception under my eye lids, 
I'm sitting in lotus I'm focus, no stagger in my steps, 
taking the shot at my body and best they tatted my vest 
nobody snatching my breath, 
they only adding my stress, stress 
padding my flesh, a lesson I have to accept,
shit happens I guess, click clack when I crept, 
now seat back and ingest constant energy struggles and this track was a test.
