[Ubiquitous:]
Whatever happened to the days we were raised pop breaks spray paint and bust a flow
The same way those days must've came and went away had to change up and go
The underground, where I stay we create from a high plane but I came from the below
Some of these things never made for us to know
Watch the rain cause my brain combustible

[Godemis:]
Now we all got a vote to cast
Now we all got a vote to cast
But which gas gonna blast you in the face?
There's no tellin' but at least they asked you
Make way, cause I'm 'bout to pass through
Stack cakes and I'm 'bout to cash out
Up, up, and a fuck away we go, and I bet a lot of y'all will pass out
Round here they still hatin', I'm still makin' that real bacon
Look at the craft they grill makin', I'm still Jason, they still facin'
A mad man with the pills, pacin', I peel faces and heal patients
Probably never get a vacation
I'm undercover like a free mason, check three praises
Turn around and fire at me, little idiot, I'm all the way up
Make a scene off a half of Maybelline, to make it seem you gonna face the makeup
My earthquake finna shake the place up
Your real fans really need to wake up
Stand still, that'll get your face bust
The marshmallow man on the plans to stay puffed

Back in the day, in the dane of danes
Back when the RZA was a razor blade
The U-B-I really thought he could change the game
I know some of y'all might've made the same mistake
It turns out, really couldn't change a thing
Now we're fucked in the game, no shade of grey
I get the radio with the pay to play, and now the Ces Cru sittin' on layaway, yo
I thought that I could be a major player
Maybe one day see my face on Fader
My team's not hittin' like Major Lazer
So please stop kickin', gettin' paid to say words
It's not in the cards, I rock with the stars
Get to toppin' the charts, I'm watchin' a star
Cause I'm not really on to profit this large
And the single that I've dropped, a shot in the dark
Ha! Call it target practice
White guy rappin', not a shard of blackness
But that I'm speaking from my heart, the fact is
If you was smart, you would never start this rap shit
Still I'm bringing in this party atmosphere
Seen a couple women cardiac in here
Get yours 'fore it all collapse, get clear
The government has made it hard to stack this year
It's the art of distraction, bask in fear
They wanna take it 'till the armed attack is near
I feel the pain when I carve my path
They said it came with the game, what part is that? (Shit)
Take charge when I lead the pack in
Or tell the promoter I'm a need to back in
I'm hella overpaying fees and taxes thinking back to the street which'll leave me askin'
