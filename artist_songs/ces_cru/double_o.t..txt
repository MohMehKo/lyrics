[Verse 1 - Godemis:]
Ya mama, ya auntie, I'm feeling ya vibe
I need you on my team, I want you on my side
I never knew love, the way that they claim to
Could it be that veil's down or is it that I came to
Wherever you go go, I'm watchin' in slow-mo
I'm tryna undress that, record with a GoPro
You ready to go, oh, no pressure to kick rocks
No wonder they love you, more than I do Hip-Hop
Hold up for the pit-stop, My lady don't flip flop
I'm make her love come down and bathe in the drip drops
When I tie the slipknot, we're making our ends meet
Love you from a distance that's greater than ten feet
I'm head over heels hun, I never did feel one
Guess I had a fake bitch instead of a real one
If ever ya feel done, just let me know that then
Go from double O.T to all the way back in

[Hook - Ubiquitous:]
Ya on my mind
Ya play like I don't see you
When you're hiding in plain sight
We're looking good, only trouble I see (So I)
Is the way you run out of touch, call it double O.T (Oh woah)
All alone, waiting by the phone
Thoughts keep me wide awake at night
I look to you for the love that I need (So why are you)
You're hard to catch, why you running from me? (Double O.T)

[Verse 2 - Ubiquitous:]
I hear a motherfucker cussin' and such
And when I love on somethin' I love on it much too much
For your love I'm such a sucker punches bust my shit
I'm waking up to lumps, I'm wonderin' what the fuck I did
And for your punishment, I am a gluten feed me please
You never met anybody hungry as me believe
I'm taking licks, sores bleed on my face from kicks
Gettin' a taste of what it's like to be replaced so quick
Give me a break you're here today and gone the next
They call it wanderlust, I'm wishin' you would wander less
I try to stay strong, calm my stress
Play along but it's out of balance all a mess
And weighed it wrong, chess game
Either take the queen, or play the pawn
May your kindness be taken for weakness to played upon
Checkmate, heard her said actions affect fate
Prepare for the worst thing while I pray for the best case

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Godemis:]
We're not gonna take shit, may work or it may not
We comin' in harmony, in rhythm with fate's clock
We take it at our pace, and if the brakes lock
I got you, you got me, inside a heart-shaped box
I'm not gonna force it, got nothing to force with
We smash when it's crunch time, unable to forfeit
It's good but of course it, may even be tested
You bring the best out me, the worst is reflected

[Verse 4 - Ubiquitous:]
Yeah, she has a certain affect, I put in the work and I sweat
But it's worth all the stress if I lay with her when I rest
This love burnin' my chest, I stop searchin' for sex
What she got I never found in any person I met
In the blink of an eye it all turned to a mess
I'm tryna iron out the kinks first, permanent press
Give me the courage to jet
I'm hangin' onto every word that I get
But truthfully, I haven't heard from her...yet

[Hook]
