[Hook:]
I got my vibe on flow
Throw on my clothes and go
I’m ridin slow and low
Catch the vibe, catch the vibe tonight
I’m ‘bout to roll this loud
Light it then blow it down
Tonight we own this town
Catch the vibe, catch the vibe tonight

[Verse 1 - Ubiquitous:]
Still wakin up out of my dream I think I’m half sleep
Last night we got high as Apache, now that’s strong
But I ain't know it was that deep, I left my ID
All up in the backseat smoking on that Hashish
Please pass me, the ces on the left side, Midwest side
The best side that’s something I’ll never let slide, guess why
I’m bettin that you can catch vibes, I’m ready for press time
We’re vibin like, lets get high tonight, set my mind a flight
Then let it drop from a death defying height step aside
You might catch the vibe tonight, set the dynamite!!

[Verse 2 - Ubiquitous:]
I’m on the highway cruising at a low speed
Mind state same color as a nose bleed
Pumpin my system breakin down fat trees
Top down playground bangin out the backseat
Hit up the wayside, over by the bayside
Met Miss brown now we’re rollin like snake eyes
I hit the soul blade puffin on the death star
Bass line hum fat it got a stretch mark
Pearl white reflect, break it into fractals
Interior ash the accents tobacco
I’m in relax mode, dippin through the trap
Jake stay on patrol so we whistle when he pass
We hit the night club slip in through the back
Booth stay on reserve so we’re sittin where we sat
Soon as we sat down, shots getting passed round
Shaking my ass while this song play in the background

[Verse 3 - Ubiquitous:]
U b i in the place to be
It was me Bern-bizzle plus Angel D
Had my man Wrekonize on the side of me
When a couple of chicks started fightin violently
I was like oh shit, then I ducked a jab
Spilled my drink when security rushed their ass
God damn man not another fight in the club
They ‘gon blame us, we the ones hyping ‘em up
End scene now we’re back at the bar, black shades
In the club pitch dark, we’re just actin like rap stars
A fan ran up tryin to bust me a verse
Stevie was on stage so I ain't hear one of his words like what?
Gave me a blunt filled with something superb
I took a puff of the herb, what a wonderful world I’m sayin
What you know about, everybody phones out
Cliqued up in the club, turned up and zoned out
