So many days we were sittin low
Get busy livin till the day you gettin gone
This could be your dyin day
Thanatos grab you draggin you away
Day break comin to a close
Grim reap comin for your soul
On your death bed where you gunna go? Gooo

So many days we were sittin low
Get busy livin till the day you gettin gone
This could be your dyin day
Thanatos grab you draggin you away
Day break comin to a close
Grim reap comin for your soul
On your death bed where you gunna go? Gooo

So many days were were sittin low
Schemin how difficult the game is and how to get the dough
Still know that one day this shit will blow
Soon as I can get control of my environment
Get me a grip of shows
Got it, now its all give and go
I'm givin the gift of flow
I use it to fuel the rocket ship and go
We grittin getting so typical locally you stick in joe
Saigon Jay Lupe and hit the road
They got me thinkin yo, (hmmm)
These dudes doin it big and bad
They bounced out just to bring it back, pour
Stuck up in a wicked trap but fuckin with freakin flat
Touchin keyboards doin the click and clack
A lot of times just the sickest ones
Just doin the sickest tracks
Who couldn't get it done
For steady pay
The record hot sun he's spittin that
But he couldn't get his fun
This shit is done, fuck well anyway

[Godemis]
So many days we were stuck in the traffic
Goin half on sacks puffin hustlin raps
Back when it was a-dats and Diddy was poppin Crys
I was rockin Wu-Wear with tracks on floppy disks
Now, we did the roughs on an analog A-track
Laid down beats on Triton
Plenty of raps we written became songs
But them times long gone and whether in-spite of wrong
Life's to short to be livin it in the past
Every moment we that we've taken for granted could be our last
Gettin ass sippin cash soon as it happens its automatically in the past
How long will it last? Nobody knows
So we constantly blowin and getting dough
Better have the gwap ready before we get in the show
Got the game in the arm bar slippin the "figure-four"
Clipper fold getting littled or on 'em we sittin low like
