We were riding high
They were rolling low
We were grinding heavy
They would take it slow
They wanna know the game
But it can't be told...
No it can't be sold
Why they thinking that it can't be so

You gotta give me space
I gotta hit these dates
Got a lot of chicks giving me chase
But can nobody ever seem to get me the pace, it's quick (YA)
It's Will Bixby and Gates
Hit 'em with the real sixteen for cake (YO)
For God's sakes, what I really needs' a break
Break it down, roll it up, Philly weed and shake
Breaking down the rhyme at a millipede's pace
Pray to see the light of day or will it be a waste
Hillary's a fake and Don Trump's a fraud
Either way they both livin' way above the law
Hip Hop dead, motherfuck this I'm gone
Master of Puppets and Justice for All
Load 'em up, Kill 'em All Reload and BRAT
Death Magnetic let them all Fade to Black
I been chillin' out in the back hallway
Waitin' for one of y'all to collapse on stage
My hat's off, better get your facts all straight
Before you get figured out and get black balled (HEYY)
I see you runnin' like a track star
Too bad you run in a circle around in the backyard
It's like nobody did ever listen to Black Star
And if they did they probably thought it was whack bars
I guess they too cool for school they act dumb
And sell the venom to kids and get 'em a fat sum
I'm Highlander maybe one of the last ones
Who give a fuck what they talk about in their rap song (YA)

We were riding high
They were rolling low

No it can't be sold
Why they thinking that it can't be so
We were riding high
They were rolling low
We were grinding heavy
They would take it slow
They wanna know the game
But it can't be told...
And it can't be sold
When you're rollin' with the banditos

[Godemis:]
Keep an eye on the clock as the hands go around
Cause you gotta know the time and the season
Listen up and everybody soundin' like clowns
They never had a rhyme nor a reason
The roof is on fire everybody leavin'
The air is still and it got everybody wheezin'
I got the keys keys keys got the keys keys keys
Which means I be gone for the weekend
These idiots be acting like I ain't got it when I always had it
Been at it with a pad and a pen and it never mattered the patterns
I was developin' hell I been a veteran long as a lot of y'all walkin' the planet and
I don't need an automatic I'm doing this out of habit, you silly rabbit
Anybody can have it if you in it then grab it, do it good as the baddest
Take a look at the status yeah it's Godi doin' the Hammerdance
Go ahead and forfeit you never had a chance
They holla at us and we answer with an avalanche
I'm going Super Saiyan stayin' in a battle stance
Kamehameha flying out of both of my hands
I need a milli Travis said to give me that advance
I probably well enough to never need a battle plan
Even the Murs guy said I was a battered man
Show me the money tell me put it in my fucking hand
