It can't
It won't
It ain't gon'...

This is the dawning of the age of Aquarius
Made in America, cover the grey areas
With black and white hysteria over the way we're pairing up
They wanna dig a grave for us to lay us in and bury us
The mumble rap-athon is on and on to the break of dawn
Rollin' up the green, pass it on, Grey Poupon
Pour a cup of lean and autotune it, how you make a song
Storin' up my chi, sorry if I kept you waiting long
Actin' like I left, well Ces is back in effect
Young rappers lackin' respect, they only after a check
Call it passive-aggressive fact, you not a fact or a threat
Take a knee and protest, Collin Kaepernick, I rep the backpackers to the death, most accurate yet
They pinnin' the blame on lyricism for our lack of success
I blow the spot, light the shade where they sleep
I pay to see you find your way inside this maze full of sheep, playin for keeps
They keep the gamepad locked and roll a Maybach drop
Pushin' out the stock hits to make the payroll pop
(The in-) The industry turnin' out the same old slop
But no, it can't (it can't), it won't (it won't), it ain't gon' stop

It ain't gon' stop
It ain't gon' stop
And babe twerkin' on the wall bettin' they gon' watch
Okay it might blow up, (it may) it may go pop
But no, it can't (it can't), it won't (it won't), it ain't gon' stop

[Godemis:]
From my critique of what I'm peepin', it's a lame scene
They set you up to fail, they on the same team
Nobody questions what's your method man, you Gangrene
Rappers hate on actors, but the fact is they the same thing
Everything is mainstream, sleepers had the same dream
Suppose what you click for the pictures and let the chain swing
But what would happen if these rappers ever came clean?
Kickin' it to peasants with the message, "We the same thing"
I've seen so many who hustled and no avail
Intent to get a chain, but they playin' a show and tell
I'm losin' my religion, so Satan can go to hell
And if such a place exists, I'll be safe if you hold a cell
I heard you makin' 'em statements that we some suckers
Once and for all, let me set this shit straight for you motherfuckers
We never made a record and tried to shop it to Trav and Tech
We made it off the strength of our talent and havin' that respect

I let the name drop, and wonder how he stay so hot
My team sittin' on a couple things they don't got
(The in-) The industry turnin' out the same old slop
And no, it can't (it can't), it won't (it won't), it ain't gon' stop

It ain't gon' stop
It ain't gon' stop
The new world order was an age old plot
Okay it might blow up, (it may) it may go pop
But no, it can't (it can't), it won't (it won't), it ain't gon' stop

You wanna front what? Get your tomato squashed
They washed up, dried out, they lost their Play-Doh top
Go 'head, hit me with everything you pendejos got
I got the fuego chop, they wanna wait on pop
But Biggie can't save us, and Iggy can't save us
I don't suppose I can either, so I can't say much
These skinny-jean ass rappers can't stand straight up
They lookin' like my grand-daddy with the pants they bust
I'm still saggin' I came to soak your fan-base up
Emancipate your people, fuck your whole campaign up
I'm in the ring rollin' with both of my hands taped up
Shadowboxing until clear channel mandates us
Their whole plan-a sucked
They wanna band-aid cuts
Tryin' to rub us out, fuck a cunt and sandpapers
They landscape as such, what kinda chance do we got?
You know it can't, it won't, it ain't gon' stop
(Yeah)
