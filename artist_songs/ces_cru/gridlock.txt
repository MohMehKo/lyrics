[Ubiquitous:]
You heard about it but, couldn't believe it
That they would kill a man, just for breathin'
And you were thinking fat chance there's a reason
Until you hear the BLAT BLAT then you see it

You heard about it but, couldn't believe it
That they would kill a man, just for breathin'
And you were thinking fat chance there's a reason
Until you hear the BLAT BLAT then you see it

Well okay now they thinking that the gunplay
Was just an isolated thing from the one place
I tell 'em hell naw keep a celly cell on
And follow Philando, Alton and Delrawn
Out in Dallas they were caught up in the onslaught
Had a couple cop ducking from the pop pop
Body drop it was looking like he on top
Then they killed that motherfucker with the bomb bot
Now we cooking up the beef and the grill hot
You ain't heard about the deal with the Chilcot
It's a jagged little pill and the pill caught
In your throat and you wonder when it will stop
Greenpeace on the beach for the whale watch
Innocent still sittin' in a cell block
Got you wishin' on a tail of the Hale-Bopp
Lookin' for the gold ticket in the mailbox
Got a broke down livin' in my locale
Killa city block business you ain't know about
Donald Trump on a ticket we don't know how
Everybody lined up hopin' that their vote count
Maybe for their kids sake, how do you dictate
The real winner when they runnin' in a fixed race
Either which way, whoever you pick payed off by the rich motherfuckers in a big way
Gridlock on the government of this day, and everybody in the senate on a sick day
Lawmakers all caught up in the red tape, I read about it and I'm feeling like a headcase
Now they sayin' that I might've made a mistake, and I probably shoulda put it on a mixtape
Instead I put it on my name is on a list tape
And if they kill me then my baby mama gets paid FUCK Y'ALL

We can pretend we don't see it like our lids, locked
Look the government is all caught up in grid, lock
Read about it and you wonder when will it, stop
Gotta get mine before I got caught up and get, got
Grid, lock
Look the government is all caught up in grid, lock
Read about it and you wonder when will it, stop
Gotta get mine before I get caught up and get, got

[Godemis:]
Everybody so uneducated on the problem, I don't think I'll live to see the day that people solve it
Killin' unarmed individuals in cold blood, now if that ain't murder what the fuck am I to call it?
They don't even give a shit and everybody saw it, why would they, when they running around lawless
Acting like a ghetto celebrity, when they floss it, worst kept secret everybody who lost it
What's the repercussion for puttin' bodies in coffins
When you got a family member running for office
Moving in the circle of real killers and bosses, who the one to lose and they never take any losses
Anybody be gone yes pardon me but your honor, I don't want to be conned, and I don't want to be conquered
I don't want to be caged, and I don't want to be master
I don't want to be instrumental in a disaster
Murdering them and after, gathering all the data
I can see what the media thinking don't really matter
People do what they gotta do to make a move up the ladder
Sticking whoever long as their pockets are getting fatter
Mama's are getting madder, daddy don't give a damn
If people are in the street dedicating the jam, I'm looking at mother nature hollering no ma'am
Killing the little piggy literally going ham
And the fat cats acting like they know best
Live a carefree life feeling no stress
Will they ever pay for it never know I guess
But they don't give a shit about a protest
I said the fat cats acting like they know best
Live a carefree life feeling no stress
Will they ever pay for it never know I guess
But they don't give a shit about a protest

We can pretend we don't see it like our lids, locked
Look the government is all caught up in grid, lock
Read about it and you wonder when will it, stop
Gotta get mine before I got caught up and get, got
Grid, lock
Look the government is all caught up in grid, lock
Read about it and you wonder when will it, stop
Gotta get mine before I get caught up and get, got

Grid, lock
Gotta get mine before I get caught up and- [Gunshots and screaming]
