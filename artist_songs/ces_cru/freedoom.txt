They told me to put my back into it
Well, give me the pen cause I'm back into it
Rap's ruined, guess I'm here to finish the carnage
And whatever's not ash just discard it as garbage
Spitting hard shit, petrified turds
I hate you bumpin' soulja boy, it gets on my nerves
So much to the point I try to ignite him in flame
When I was, inkin' his verse I didn't write out his name
You know them anorexic
Pan the camera, gat 'em an' exit
Poopin' in the future I gotta be on that next shit
Bet this
Son of a monkey's uncle is breathless
Wannabe good rapper well get him a fuckin' necklace
Throwing Last Dragon I'm 'bout to hit 'em with neck kicks
Texas Chainsaw, bitches off of the checklist
Next is
Something for nothing, dinner for breakfast
A Rosary, a Bible, two idiots and a death kiss
Go!

[Hook]
I know you're comin' to kill me, I feel ya
I ain't even waitin' to see
I know you talk bullshit in a whisper
The funny thing about is you don't come an' say it to me
I always say never flip a coin, kill an angel, and dip bro
Yeah I'm comin' to get it and I know where to get more
They'll be rushin' the castle, comin' killin' the king soon
And nobody can stop em'
Cause it's all about freedoom

[JL]
Uh, yo we'll be down, if you wanna die
Hunt a guy down, lay him down, no lullaby
Hello I, come in a yellow tie
For the head of my adversary like a mellow guy
Recently [?] melancholy
Mad at somebody matchin' my hand
Scratch it against the pack
Sorry I'm trashin' the party, (don't) give a fuck
Hardly ever I'm hard as ever my heart is darker
My flow is heavy, ya havin' help from no Peter Parker
Or Clark Kent we aren't in a fuckin' film
Retarded, my arsenal's somthin' grim
Not fuckin' Slim you ain't seen it, I'm chuckin' them
And in a minute I'm finna finish it
Yank on the prevalent
To withdraw or get mauled
To piss off and get lost
To resolve at the neck, body get tossed
In a pit where the fish are
Bizzare fo' sho'

I'll see you soon homie, they phony I feel it deep
They pilot trickin' and nothin' they say is real it seems
Conspiricy theory y'all ain't hear me it's clear to me
This phony feelin' I feel it it's slowly building, I bust!
A killer must do what he must do and he murk with ease
So if I leave a murder secne I murder mercifully
Givin' UBI the third degree takin' oaths
I have taken oath and quiet is what I prefer to be
I am not a bird of prey
Why the fuck would you act like you'd ever heard of me
Or interrupt a word I say
You humiliate yourself
I can feel you face
Gettin' hot from over here
Your makin' real mistakes
I see your plans crumble
Be a man, grow up
Leavin' Neverland could make a Peter Pan humble
You play a lot boy
Maybe you a lost boy
Little baby bok choy
Killer? Maybe not boy
Go!
