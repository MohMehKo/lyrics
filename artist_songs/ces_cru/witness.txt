Get it

[Hook: Godemis]
Nobody really gives a shit if I'm in this
The proof is in the pudding, fuck it God is my witness
With that said, you ain't gotta get with this
Go ahead play your part, sit and swallow with dick bitch
These silly suckers rappin' need to be lip-less
Their center steady cryin' in the bottomless pit with
The D double E V I L, fo' sho'
Spark a flame to the place, and we out. Latch the do'

[Verse 1: Godemis]
I'm so ill, roadkill on the asphalt
I blast off, it's an offa' [?] package of bath salt
My nat [?] caught fire, yeah I'm rappin' my ass off
I'm Bruce Wayne, only when I shit wit' the mask off
The gas cost pennies, there's plenty to go around
Get revenge with the pen, my P-N-C? blow a pound
Buck em down Rogers, my demons do need handlers
They look the part but they're much sicker like Pee Lander
Broads scamper when I enter the room
Enter the sandman, the Devil was too in tune
So I changed frequencies and the diggity's get nothin'
Super-size me, when I eat emcees I'mma glutton
Push buttons like a secretary with plush pins
All the hatred you feel is necessary is nothin'
Fuck friends, I ain't compatible with a lot of ya'll
Me, myself and I, don't sweat it. No, never, not at all

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Godemis]
What does it take to make everyone buy the jam?
Do I do another bump and then tell you how I am?
I do need the priests or servants to tell me that I be damned
I could buck em all down and reload with the slight of hand
Right I can. Not coach ya'll outta the minor leagues
Everybody's burnin' up tryin' to huddle in my degrees
I'mma need, three feet and a couple of fresh vixens
Two shots of jager, some silence and less bitchin'
Mo' henchmen, the army's morale is high
Band of brothers trained to shoot on whatever's caught in the eye
I rely on spewin' the gimmick isn't the fit
All they wanna hear is bars about bitches and movin' bricks
This is it. Moon walkin' on maggots
You'll never be fly
Smoke em if you got em, shit even if it's a re-fry
Be my, guest then I guess I gotta get gully
Lookin' down from headed scenery's bout to get pretty ugly

[Hook]
