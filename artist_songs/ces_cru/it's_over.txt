[Intro: Krizz Kaliko]
Damn, I forgot to do something..
Oh yeah, it ain't over, motherfuckers

[Verse 1: Godemis]
Could it be they don't really know me?
I don't care, fuck you blow me
I'mma get it right for the showing
Can't nobody call me
Out I'm a vet round here, y'all stuck in the middle like money
Cut with a roney, up to my neck in a pow full of vixens sucking up on me
Fuckin' her face like I love that bitch, but I won't ever let one control me
Fuck with it brobey
Look, I'mma luncheon
Ridin' on the back of a one-trick-pony
Back in the function
Lighting the stage on fire, now look at me like a phony
Hooked I'm an only
Child and I give two shits if a bitch wanna round up on me
You can lick my asshole but do not pass go gotta pay me what you owe me
Wait for the warning I'm alarming 'em all
You finna get mauled outside of the mini-mall
And admit it we are all literally raw
Yall Mitch Bade with a thong and a bra
Better call the law
The snake and the bat in the building swilding I'm stacking a million
Crackin a couple of cases smokin a freshy facin the fuckin' ceilin, chillin

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
It ain't over 'till it's over
It ain't over 'till it's over
It ain't over 'till it's over
Okay, this shit's over!

[Verse 2: Ubiquitous]
I'm about to act in my faith so I rap in the game and the game
Mean we back with the fame like a slap in the face
It's strange how I laugh at the pain get to tappin' your brakes
Need a couple rack in the safe I'm stacking the cake I play for
The bat and the snake neva wanna bomb jack in my rates
I train In the trap, livin' in a maze, no map now I'm runnin like a rat in a race
I happen to know, many men who rap to my soul man you dunno the half of the hole
I chill in the class on my own
I'm Feelin where you at it'll feel like attack of the clones
Can't tell the weird from the wack
Skill from the from flash
Jill from the jack from the joe
I act on my own, after the throne
Come up outa my chair the gat to your dome
Pass me the dro on my left hand side
No captain and coke I'mma let that ride
Wrapped in a robe, Jedi Knight
Better bust on the mic with deadeye sight
I'm back in the zone like I never a left it
Somebody show me which crew better than Ces is
I don't know why they ain't get em' a necklace
Get em' a world tour with a bed and a breakfast
Ah hah

[Verse 3: Krizz Kaliko]
Once again the never ending (Kali)
I was offending rappers over now there bending
The death of hip hop open my mouth avenging
I'm way too clean, all of your styles or dingy
Never see me (No)
Even if you have under a microscope see my mic provokes em'
Twitter full of fans and your by your lonesome
Get her out of her pants and you know she wants some
Gimme, Gimme, Gimme, Gimme
Your style isn't nothing more than a penny
Rap until my lungs is empty
Even tecca nina can't pretend to be me
The wild in me or Goddy defend the UB
This is my duty
To rock and then don't stop then they interview me
? And I ain't a newbie
I'm a painter with anguish
You don't baby don't speak on my language
It's a done dealybob a done dealrosky
Got a deal so you can't approach me
Hot so you never could roast me
So it ain't finish, finito
Until I say so brosky
So I clobber 'em with one with a coming I slobber em' don't bother em, with garbage
This shit's over but I feel like its barely started. (Kali)

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Tech N9ne]
You need... scheisse spray...
Because my shits makin' the flys split so anybody that want it they're gonna die today
When the mic sits upon my lips it come a crisis you better hide away
High pitch you no like this then it's bye bitch don't even try to play
White Mike and it's Donnie, your life's a bitch when it's Tecca Nina with them and then a Spider K
We groovy with a caucasian and three mulies never disrespect us see toolies from Kali, Godi, Me, Ubi, (eh!)
Effortless I'm gonna change your brain
Bring every wicked bit of Strange to mainstream
Now my baby making thangs are hanging
Cause my type of insane we slanging
And You don't wanna wake up in the middle of killers A milli
Gonna rudder you up I feel up a butter my niggas in a willing to buck
With a villain a cutter and you chilling with a pill in your gut
Oh and I wanna rock
Nine mill I got
I'm in this rhyming assault shot when I call bubble
The way I'm living' it ain't nothing subtle
And he just living' in a fucking hovel

[Hook]
