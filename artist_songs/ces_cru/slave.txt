Yeah
Oh gosh - oh gosh - oh gosh
Lookit

I know and understand what happen to costs
People, they be so in the dark about the natural laws
And I guess the focal point's attacking the cause
And understand that nothing blue under the sun at all
Why even act if you're only acting accordingly
And wouldn't dare to challenge the power of that authority
Not everybody but I'm a say the majority
Are under mind control and won't never notice cause morally
They numb enough to take you out just the same
You can master the non-aggression once you balance your brain
If you agree to play the game you have no right to complain
Love is the law to all of ya'll and I'm just doing my thang!

Why even pick it cause you failed to engage
When you don't even realize the got your head in a cage
The rats race and headed straight to the maze
And you don't get the message even though the stress it on stage
Ain't nothing ill nothing you say real words
Get re-acquainted with the brakes cause it may build nerves
And a slave will serve
And a slave will serve
And a slave will serve
And a slave will serve
And a slave, and a slave, and a slave
And a slave, and a slave, and a slave...
Really hurts me to say
It taught you how to behave
You've got one foot in the grave
You've gotta know you're a slave
You're a - You're a - a

Now think about if everything was to flip up
You taxin' everybody they don't know it's a stick up
The politicians prolly just forgetting they tip sucked
Whoever makes the cut is next in line for the nip-tuck
The freedom fighters crumbling when it gets rough
Retreating is a form of weakness we can see shit stuck
Its sick to think about how much the frequency missed us
Manipulated media keeps leaving us mixed up (fuck)
And now its time I harness all of my skill
And exercise the right to act when love is under my will
Internalize the vigilance and never stop it until
The crooked people put in power know this isn't a drill
For real

Why even pick it cause you failed to engage
When you don't even realize the got your head in a cage
The rats race and headed straight to the maze
And you don't get the message even though the stress it on stage
Ain't nothing ill nothing you say real words
Get re-acquainted with the brakes cause it may build nerves
And a slave will serve
And a slave will serve
And a slave will serve
And a slave will serve
And a slave, and a slave, and a slave
And a slave, and a slave, and a slave...
Really hurts me to say
It taught you how to behave
You've got one foot in the grave
You've gotta know you're a slave
You're a - You're a - a
