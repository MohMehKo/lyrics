[Verse 1 - Godemis:]
I make music for a living, so every day is the weekend
The blade ain’t tucked away until everybody is leaking
I’ve had it up to heaven with father fuckers critiquing
My suggestion is you stuff a cock in it, the Deevil’s speaking
Right up under the knife, I’m a villain still in the cut
Feeding on hate, I patiently wait and swill up a cup
Wavy, wondering what in the fuck is the motive for it
The Deevil said I should kill him, then Godemis said ignore it
Emo with it, I’m morbid, my ism is out of orbit
They bite off what they can chew from you, funny how you ain’t Norbit
Arsenal is assorted with plenty curses and disses
Plus we don’t discriminate, murking any mister or missus
Appetite for destruction, cause if the recipe misses
We feeding on every scrap and don’t bother to bus the dishes
This is what some wishes are made of and it’s kind of silly
They going hammer, can’t touch me, but God, I pray they can feel me

[Hook - Ubiquitous:]
It’s all fly in the friendly skies
I’m ready for whatever’s headed my way
Ends change friends change every five days
Identify snake venom enter my space
You’re givin em five minutes why wait?
Holdin your moment that’s gone
Develop your density need some back bone
Bae boy he wishin that he was back home
Charlie can’t go back, when this shit go black
I’m bringin disco back

[Verse 2 - Ubiquitous:]
Back from skid row, out of agony central
You’re grabbing at my microphone I’m snappin your wrist bone
Anatomy split throw em like Vladamir Klitchko
You’re pissed that I’m rappin fast, well I’m happy to spit slow
Cuz everything goes fast, I watch as it go past
I’m tossin these bread crumbs, You’re lost with a road map
Perusin our catalog, and shoppin for vocab
They copy the flow, I give the gift of forgiveness
I thought you should know that, but business is business
Want to know how we did it? Better get to jottin on notepads
And read you a book buddy, sharpen your brain but now
It’s smarter to play dumb, what part of the game?
Acquire target and aim (bluhh) It ain't hard to be famous
I market my anguish but now it’s startin to change us
So pardon my language, but fuck how you feel
You bitch ass motherfucker you’s a sucker for real
It ain't nothing to get you…… high

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Godemis:]
You’re talking that fly shit, get ready for lift off
The rules don’t apply bitch, I’m ripping your lips off
Pussy in a dog fight, irony at it's best
It's good you a dumb fuck, see this is a crabs test
Y’all average at best, you got to start someplace
Tell me how the fuck the blood from under your tongue taste
Pursue and let one chase, lock and I scare fakes
Then bust a 180, that’s on behalf of my air brakes

[Verse 4 - Ubiquitous:]
Radio for your squad, we’re taking over the skies
Clear out the way and land now or say your sober goodbyes
Cross your heart and hope to die, make a wish to the rap lord
It’s a wonderful life, maybe you get what you ask for, that’s yours
Way they be hittin the fast forward, my slow flow
Bang thoughts hittin the dashboard, a trick of the light
Pick your dog fight Mr. mcfly, call em a chicken
And they’re quick to reply, the hands quicker than the…… eye

[Hook]
