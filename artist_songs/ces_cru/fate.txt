[Verse 1 - Ubiquitous:]
How many start a journey, but never see the end?
I never ask how, conceive it then speak in wins
A man'll work his whole life to see his ego shed
I sew it up, needle head, all I need is thread
A team can only take it as far as it's strongest leader
The streets are red, running with the blood of nonbelievers
So play a part, I'll make a star out of a bottom-feeder
The Romans fell under his knife but made a god of Caesar
For every Caesar, there's a Brutus with a blade of steel
For every offense, there's a defense til I break the shield
For every fake or real, I guess that my fate is sealed
Driving drunk off of power trips somebody take the wheel
Told travel light, what you hold'll weigh you down
Big noise, Bob Dylan you don't make a sound
The golden truth, motherfucker, I don't roll with muse
Show improve yourself, fuck am I supposed to do?
EPMD, teach a man to fish
Learn from me, only if you seek advantages
Complaints about the game, you need to speak with management
Best crew, Ces Cru, it seems to be unanimous
I'm out for action, what the fuck are y'all about, relaxin'?
They can doubt my sanity but never doubt my passion
And I don't know why they deceivers feed us lies mislead us
He who denies what he has seen is worse than nonbelievers
I just play the cards the way they're dealt
It's hard enough to change the world, I'm trynna change myself
The choices is accept the conditions as they exist
Or accept the responsibility and change the shit

[Verse 2 - Godemis:]
She handed me my change after I completed my purchase
I thought of spittin' game but I managed to fight the urges
I said "It must be strange for you all alone on the surface"
She said it was a curse to be perfect without a purpose
Feelin' nervous I stepped in, the opposite direction
Her comment resonated, I tried to sever connection
Is this the twist of fate that's from karma and misdirection?
I'm standin' in the mirror still lookin' for my reflection
What am I trynna say, rocking all this ink on my body
I'm King, Hathaway, Donnie, most people know me as Godi
It's ill though, I kick it like Fei Long with a steel toe
They run amok and couldn't give a fuck with a dildo
For real bro, my hater-scopin' dumbdar's been on
So I don't give a bloody fuck who's droppin' the N-Bomb
We bout to shake it up til the plane's fall
Then cut through all the tension y'all invent with a chainsaw
"Is that a threat?" No it's a request
To be correct, it's a requirement, you fuckin' with Ces
And if you try to fix ya place to say that we ain't the best
You might as well be tryin' to work a deal with nothin' for less
And I'm up in the nest, never depressed of pressin' my tiers
Conquering fears and never cavin' from the pressure of peers
Swillin' my beers while tellin' Jahova to thank heaven
All I need is six Addies, a shot, and a tank seven
Tell a bitch I am dynamite, she might blow me
And the shit I'm snortin' is china white, just like O.T
Pardon my passion if it's like I'm riffin' my O.G
My P and P will K-I-M the day that I O.D, bitch
