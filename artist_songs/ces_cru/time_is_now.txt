I don't really care who's 'bout to blow
I don't even know what's going down
I'm just getting ready for the show
Can't wait till we can leave this town
Pack our bags, rep that crown, pack that venue and blow that down
Get back home with a couple of racks, put the lock on the latch and blow fat pounds
Y'all stand up so we hold ya down, y'all scream loud and I love that sound
Shit looks weird from up here now that we're finally outta that background
Hands go up and the love goes round [x4]

[Verse 1: Godemis]
Now...
Deadly as I'll ever be, ready yeah I better be
Call up my connect and tell my manager don't schedule me
I'm out this bitch quick wit a lit cigarette and a backpack full of white Ts
Taking a bunk on a bus and I don't give a what just going with the breeze
Taking it back in the day, making a way
Taking a chance, taking a dare, make an advance, what do you know, make some fans
I can remember December the venue was packed and we sat in the back with the mixed drink
Wit no mic check, and a fucked? slot, with the both of us thinking the shit stinks
Either way we tore the place down, murdering it like this ain't they town?
Either we get back home and the people we touched so much decided to stay down
Realise it ain't no 8 mile, this whole shit here's taking the cake now
We put in the work and all I can hope is that we made the 816 proud
Looking down from here the shit's wild, I gotta plug my ears cause shit's loud
We got a long way to go wit a little bit of dro and a lot a bit of dough and a paypal, now

[Verse 2: Ubiquitous]
Now understand I stood upon the smaller stage and miss the audience and friends
Who would never take me serious I never thought that this could end
I was lost in innocence and not as popular as them
But now I'm a prophet wit the pen, I'm pulling a profit wit the pen
They pull and they pop it, in the street where the bodies and bullets drop 'em
Doing my laundry, was a shock when the lobby was full of cops
But who could believe it? When I dream I acheive it
Why should I stop? I never will peak and take the sit? in one spot, push for the top
And I has to play it small and act as if I was unsure
So all the people I had around wouldn't have to feel insecure
Now I live the dream my confidence has burst from every seam
So when we meet in person now you feel uncertain, is it me?
They treated me like dirt cheap, discouraged me to speak
And now they lined up with they hands out, who's first to get a piece?
What I need is what I'm worth believe, we don't work for free
We got a thirst for green I, search and I see, its 13

Hands go up and the love go round
Hands go up and the love go round
Hands go up and the love goes round
Hand go up and the love goes round
