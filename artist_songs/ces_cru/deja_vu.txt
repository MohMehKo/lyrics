You beg me to stay
The way we behave, there's nowhere to go

[Ubiquitous:]
Yeah, uh, uh, uh
Love is love until the loving is hate
We fuss and fight until there's nothing to say
We must've might've gone our separate ways
And satisfied until somebody else step in our place
You said we would be the best of friends, friendship can change
Now we're spitting at each other like some venomous snakes
We go to war and then forgive, but can't forget the mistakes
When you in love, you stick together, do whatever it takes
I'm sayin', I'm feeling high and then I get set in my place
Then I re-retaliate with heavy weapons and rage
And now we, breaking apart and I regret what I say
Agreeing on somewhere to meet while I'm collecting your things again
Now I'm a lover when I step in the ring
Then I become a prizefighter, turn reckless and swing
My blow connected, now you're feeling rejected and cling
A spin cycle and the stress that it bring
Is making a mess of my brain

Oh baby
Seems we can't be sane
We spin out of control
With the way we behave
There's nowhere to go
So I leave, and you beg me to stay
It's so crazy
Now I know, with the way we behave
There's nowhere to go but up

[Godemis:]
I think about you every now and again
Curious, wonder how you've been
Reminiscing back when I was your friend
Knew I was pressing, guess I had to pretend
Like I didn't have it the baddest, I added you to the picture
Over a little time you became a permanent fixture
We perfected the mixture, read each other the scripture
Out of the blue I knew what was happening, wasn't quick ta
Say that I had an issue, I deaded communication
You became even colder because of the situation
Hatching to you was facing a breakup or separation
Told her this could occur, you preferred to get next to Jason
And forget information, I wasn't chasing you down
Open to making up the breakup if only you down
Yeah if only you down, yeah if only you down
Open to making up the breakup if only you down

[Ubiquitous:]
Oh baby
Seems we can't be sane
We spin out of control
With the way we behave
There's nowhere to go
So I leave, and you beg me to stay
It's so crazy
Now I know, with the way we behave
There's nowhere to go but up

[Ubiquitous (Godemis):]
I play my part to make a change while you aim at my heart
From day-to-day you created your mark, bae
Illuminate the way, I'm too afraid of the dark
I'm hardly speaking to you, communication is sparse, hello?
You make it hard, I mean it's difficult, boo
For me to move on in my life while I be trippin' off you
(Sick as the witches with the wickedest brew
No I don't mind 'cause most the time she make it do what it do
She made an art out of how to take my heart and rip it in two
No glass slippers for the chickens to be dippin' into
A sacred rendezvous, or a case of Deja Vu
To realize that givin' chase is what I ain't gon' do)
There's no exception to rules
See, everybody played the fool up in her
But who would shoot a cupid's arrow if they knew that it hurt?
(No problem doing the dirt
When you was doing it worse
Relationship is syncing second but first things first

[Ubiquitous:]
Oh baby
Seems we can't be sane
We spin out of control
With the way we behave
There's nowhere to go
So I leave, and you beg me to stay
It's so crazy
Now I know, with the way we behave
There's nowhere to go but up
