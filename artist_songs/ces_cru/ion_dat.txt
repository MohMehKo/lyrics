[Verse 1: Ubiquitous]
I give a
Fuck what you've heard about
My Cru's in the streets, through word-of-mouth
My block they shopping the curb for couches
And Poppin the locks off of urban houses WHILE
Y'all rocking them urban outfits
Move till you drop, and they serving ounces
Dressed hella clean, like a firm accountant
So when a cop trip, he don't worry about shit
You don't know us, you can get the business
Tax you for ca$h and conflicted interests
My flow caress, so CES, we coalesce
We're throwing a show, one set, no requests
Claim the Playground, tear the place down
Hold em on the wall and then spit out tank rounds
I pull the tank out the house
Send the ransom to my PayPal account
Drop the dope, fresh, photo op, and pose
With a Roscoe Moe, and an Optimo
Ces-philes is coming, better lock your cribs
$ikenomics.com and cop the (fence[?]) it's hot shit!
Something that you got to get
Lil change in a pocket to profit with
These dudes sell firebag
You sell the brown with big frowns, tell em' why you mad

[Hook]
You don't know where I am @
See that chip stack, they eyeing that
Me with Dean, rely on that
My back, he keeps an Ion Dat
[x2]
An Ion Dat
An Ion Dat
An Ion Dat
An Ion Dat
You don't know where I am @
See that chip stack, they eyeing that
Me with Dean, rely on that
My back, he keeps an Ion Dat

[Verse 2: Godemis]
And I'm Rocking with the best place to weed up
Cop pounds, better dump & Re-Up
KC with the counters on
And I can't kill the pain with a Tylenol
For the chick in the back of the club, who stumblin
And the ones on the wall, all mumblin
No, I don't gotta whip, stop wonderin
It's dope, bank tho coming in, but no limping
All the way, to the bank, rolling
Everybody wanna know, if I'm holding
Not if the whip is stolen
I got a Nike to put the dough in
Co-defendant with a co-dependent
Dependency to release the sentence
Bang on y'all, like "STOP RESISTIN'"
Base chronic and light the incense
I like to mention the flow is Bombay
And any gold digger better go find Kanye
Giddee up, better be running my way
Catch the train, Nina with a bag of Tre-Fo
Stop off, and then catch a case
Better hope that the wheels don't stab your face
Better know when to act your age, retract your rage
Better when they get it nowadays, it's all day

[Hook]
