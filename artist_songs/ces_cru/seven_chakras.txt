[Ubi:]
I've been lied to, bust out
Passed over and cussed out
Now I'm up nights
Strugglin' to keep it in the uprights
No touchdown
I've been, been high but I cut down
Had to calm down, tryin' to stay sane
Got up in the game, it affected my brain
Now I feel like I've gone half nuts now, AH
Came up in a rough town
Town made me and the town tough
KC MO where the crew is CES
And we built this thing from the ground up, AH
Fall down, but I bounced up
So grateful that Tech found us
If he never would of done that, man
I wonder where in the hell I would of wound up
I'm a Pound Pup, but don't push this
You'll make a bad dog out a good pit
We could be B.F.s like Goodrich
As long as I'm a little more than hoodrich
My chakras are all lined up
Energy flowin' on the constant
When it burst forth from my fingertips
Its a good night, no long kiss
Since 13 I've been clocked in
Since playground I've been on point
Since "Capture Enemies", I've weighed in
Like a Iron giant with a strong voice
It's "Matter Don't Money", you can pay me
1-9-7-9, when it made me
Now I change ways
Tryin' to stay sane in these fast times
And these Strange days

[Godemis:]
Here I go, fire it up
Glow same color as a firetruck
Last dragon on bath salts
Up up and away, I'm high as fuck
In the pocket, I'm poppin' off
Pinpoint but not proper
Stealin' energy from my enemies
Takin' in through my chakras
Steel verses, build curses
Every now and then I feel worthless
Walkin' around in the presence of greatness
Why would a nigga not feel nervous?
Guess we gotta build purpose, and
Rep the middi, it feels worth it
Came in the game with a ball and chain
Ain't a damn thing change, I'm still workin'
Still lurkin', kill purp and
Chonging out when I'm in the booth
And my team is up to par
Y'all can hit the bar
I ain't lying and my shit's the proof
No capsizin' when I'm flowin'
These waves don't play fair
I wade through my nightdreams
Backstroke through my daymares
They don't care, I don't either
Still rockin' that wife pleaser
It's CES Cru, and we clicked up
So we roll with, no leader
I'm in a mood to, the repeater
I'm in a gunfight packin' a cleaver
And in a moment my opponent better feel me
Like I was rappin' to Ether

[Ubi:]
Ha
I ask for truth, you act aloof
I say some things to get back to you
Lifes 10% what happens to you
Other 90% all attitude
I'm shatterproof, built strong enough
To maintain my will, or we'll call your bluff
I'm doin' this thing for all of us
If I lose my feet, I'm still fallin' up
I got a hand out, whats there for me?
No ground to stand on, no air to breathe
You scared of me? Uh
Walk on my fear and receive power through clarity
Move carefully, we shed our fate
You care for me, I care the same
Same story to play poor me
Intimidation, interrogate
I serenade, they do the dance
Music I make, mood enhance
Move your hands, soothe your soul
Make you go crazy and lose control
Whats beautiful, whats good to you?
Whats worth the process they put you through?
Can't shake the pain on day to day
It all fades away when I look at you
I push the truth, why live a lie
With a room like this, I could ill survive
Got bills to pay, big fish to fry
Excuse me while I kiss the sky
It's time, hands on the clocks spun down
We not gonna keep truth lock up
It's comin' out
Runnin' out of options on the real
Nobody gonna stop us

[Godemis:]
Here we are, A-planin'
Maintainin', not man-tannin'
Beaten up the beat heatin' up the street
Megatron and my hand cannon
I'm motorin', I'm in the mode again
Energy overloadin'
I'm goin' in
Could it be we frozen
Non colder than
Literally shogun, and honin' my craft
They blinded by our shine
81-6 it's our time
They don't know how the fuck we got here
Do the math on that it was our grind
Y'all fadin' out like a star dying
Scared to fail but don't start tryin'
This I bet, better kick the deck
And eat dirt when all of these darts flyin'
Our rhymin' is hard timin'
Staring up at our stars alignin'
Posted up in that gold mine
And my whole mind is on cloud nine
We don't need thumbs up, no co-sign
These dumb fucks wanna blow lines
Long as it's on your dime I don't give a shit, no I don't mind
The snake and the bat are back in the back of the building
Stackin' a milli
Rapping a circle around 'em
And everybody in this squad is packin' a milli
Back in a minute
Y'all already know what time it is
See the rap is the gimmick
Say my mind is the only weapon I'mma get to use
I'm attackin' them with it, dig it (Dig it, dig it)
