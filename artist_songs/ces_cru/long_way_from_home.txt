[Ubiquitous:]
Long way from home, long way to go
But I had to follow my dream so I had to take that road
If I had to go back and do it again… Damn right I’d do it
Giving up instead of fighting ‘til the end… Man, that’d be foolish
No excuses, hard work is what I came for
You get out what you put in and you always get what you paid for
So it’s head down, eyes up
We just want to be the best, don’t mind us
When the chips are down we rise up
‘Cause the way that we’re living is what defines us, so…
I can’t turn back I’ve waited all my life
Packed my bags and left it all behind
Take my chances on this one-way road
Just do one thing and then I’ll run straight home

[Chedda Cheese:]
Life ain’t really looking like it used to
But I know that I’m a long, long way from home
I don’t even know how far I’ve gone
I’ll be moving on
Can’t get it off of my mind
Walk that line just to see what I find
Dreaming with nowhere to go but I feel fine
Long, long way from home

[Merkules:]
It’s been a long time coming, I spent all night running
But I never really get to where I wanted to be so I just breathe slow
Going beast-mode ‘cause they keep on pushing all my buttons like a cheat-code
And they won’t see the day where they can get the best of me
Eventually the rest will see my recipe is chemistry
I don’t care about a critic or a deal
I’m a killer in the field and I’m giving them the chills
Only spit it if I live it and it’s real
I appeal to the masses, you bastards are getting in my grill
So I’ma do it ‘til you see me down on Melrose
Bad bitch with me with some gold in my ear-lobes
Mad ‘cause I keep it one-hundred and they’re zeroes
I don’t give a fuck, I keep it moving, I’m a hero
Still slow when I’m on my grind, and you might find I’m on my climb
I kill it every single time I write these lines, what’s on your mind?
Keep it calm for a minute, yeah I’m raw with the lyrics, I’m the next generation
Do it for my dogs, yeah we did it, now we’re all going to get it
Not a fraud or a gimmick that I’m chasing

[Chedda Cheese:]
Life ain’t really looking like it used to
But I know that I’m a long, long way from home
I don’t even know how far I’ve gone
Keep it moving forward ‘til I know I’ve made it
Can’t get it off of my mind
Walk that line just to see what I find
Dreaming with nowhere to go but I feel fine

[Ubiquitous:]
Put a mountain in my way, I’m gon’ climb it
Lost it all and I need to find it
If you want something don’t try to fight it
You never know if you never try it
What’s the choice to run if you don’t exercise it?
I ain’t coming back ‘til I’m on the map
‘Til I’ve got it made, and I promise that
And once I make a promise I’ma honor that
No matter the weight that I’ve got on my back
One life, one death
One right leg, one left
Two eyes, face forward from sunrise to sunset

[Chedda Cheese:]
Life ain’t really looking like it used to
But I know that I’m a long, long way from home
I don’t even know how far I’ve gone
I’ll be moving on
Can’t get it off of my mind
Walk that line just to see what I find
Dreaming with nowhere to go but I feel fine
Long, long way from home
