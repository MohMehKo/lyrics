[Verse 1 - Godemis:]
Last thing I recall was I was turned up with the DJ
Pat shot, another Pat shot, passed out for like 3 days
Woke up to an orgy, like poor me and I couldn't look
Came to my senses, got naked and it was off the hook
I took uppers in that attic, downers in that basement
Fell into the sheet rock, left there all with my face print
But don't trip cause it ain't shit, I keep the doctor on speed dial
Xanis in my back pocket, and Adderall in my weed pouch
Yeah, I'm off the hook, try again later, scratch surface, then layer
Speak backwards sin prayer, I'm Ray or, John Mayer
City on lock like I'm Mayor, hit the bomb drop, bet I'm there
Trigger up on top, respond flare, A.K.A. your mom's layer

[Hook - Godemis:]
Tryna hit me up, wondering where the party at
Must be at her inn or something, better call me back
You flipping shit on me, now what the fuck is up with that
Don't be so hypersensitive, could have a heart attack

[Ubiquitous:]
Somebody call the EMS, what they need is an EKG
Gotta get 'em on the line for the good time, party looking D-E-A-D
Check her, one two, double check, for the middywest
Put a bang beat, it be coming off the chain, now put it on the books
Better ask around, she was off the hook, yeah!

[Verse 2 - Ubiquitous:]
Wanna hop in, cause I got them off top
When it come to the chopping, spin 'em in a hot wind
In the pocket when I clock in, and there ain't no other option
Cause I rhyme sick and y'all high-pitched, sounding like shit
Or like first gear, with the gas down, and that's not the look
Ces off the hook, it's y'all worst fear, now the world hears
That I won't stop, but I can't stop, I can't quit now
Got girls here in that same spot
With them tank tops and their tits out
Had a daydream that we made out and it made off
You got bit down, I swear to God if I squint hard it's like
Baywatch in this bitch now, ah! Running with the main boss
Another day off, I'm like "which town?" I gotta sit down
I stake off and my Jane boss and my pitch loud and I, uh
Smoke it on stage, I don't give a fuck if it's allowed
Light up your blunt, that's if you're proud
Four hands up when I hit the crowd, see, some they pay and
Some they go, some complain and some they boast
Some people really do things and others saying
Some they wrote, double dutchin' sayin' nothin' fucking playing
Jumping rope, my shit bumping, type amazing
Find your way, ya compass broke, hold up, hello?

[Verse 3 - Joey Cool:]
I was just minding my business, I wasn't in it
I don't know what happened, dog, I was sipping Jacky D
Next thing I know they offended, hold up, this hit me a minute
Admit that I was drinking like I was chasing a [?]
They gave me a shot of Patron, a shot of crown and Hennessy
[?], I don't know what the fuck has gotten into me
Niggas bugging tryna make me the enemy
Nothing compare to try to drink my energy
Fuck what you do [?] entity
Someone there in line showing sympathy
If you ain't related, homie, you ain't killing me
Amateur hour, you gotta be kidding me
Look at me, dog, you're probably into me
You don't want problems, well it a be it a be [?]
[?] cause, last night night
Off the hook like that dial tone
Got me feeling like fight night
Make a path for them wild ones
I'm like hold up, nigga, hold up
We're swarming y'all, feeling rolled up
Cause this bitch ain't finna be popping here
Until me and my crew come showing up
Nigga, off chain, off the walls, off the ropes, oh, off the hook
We get looked at an awful lot, your ass just get awful looks
That's the shit that I'm talking about
They're like "cool, man, you just rolling, bruh?"
Get used to this dope shit, cause that's that shit I'm known for (Oh!)
