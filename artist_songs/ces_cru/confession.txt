[Hook: Ubiquitous]
A devil in the flame, finger in the fire
Hand on the stove, leave a lingering desire
Dance with the devil, wrestle with the beast
Blessing from a sinner, confession from a priest

[Verse 1: Ubiquitous]
Step up on the sheets, lesson for today
Heat up in the moment come second to the pain
Packing in the rain, kissing in the dark
Awful that we came that, missing in my heart
Touching up the walls, tossing up my bed
Picture you for seek so often in my head
Feel my heartbeat beat pumping in my chest
Heavy on my mind, stomach full of stress
Cuddle and caress, keep it on the low
Everything we're speaking on secret on the phone
Leave it all alone, love will make you sick
Sicker than being alone, go and take a pic
Finding for a fix, action for your touch
Knowing you with him been, wishing it was us
Packing up my bags, gathering my things
Spin around the in grin, scattering my brain

[Hook: Godemis & Ubiquitous (x2)]

[Verse 2: Godemis]
Walking out the path, breaking all the trees
We can be together if it wasn't up to me
Waking on a storm, standing in the rain
Thinking we can never ever fire up a flame
Smoking in the green room thinking with the blues
Drinking with the band aids, linking with the crews
Sleeping on the bus, dreaming on the road
Pranking on the weak, pranking on your soul
Staying on the phone, saying I'll be home
Hoping you don't stray because you're feeling so alone
Tearing up the pavement, turning up the ghoul
Keeping covered walls while speaking with a smile
Fall up through the cracks, try to follow back
Flipping out on niggers who she don't know how to act
Lying through my teeth, laying in my bed
And she ain't nothing to me, I'm just trying to get a head

[Hook: Godemis & Ubiquitous (x2)]

[Verse 3: Ubiquitous]
Sick sitting in abuse, starring at the roof
Hard up on my sleeve, wear it of a proof
Burying the truth, digging up the past
Throw away my thoughts, sticking out the trash
Conversate with God, couldn't think about what to ask
Be in love is hard, being single, just as bad
Maybe even worse, they say that it's a gift
But they came to be a curse or maybe we should quit
Hiding like a thief, why am I discrete?
You can lie to him, but no ever lie to me
Fire in my eyes, burn a holy hue
You apologize and I'm sure it's overdue
All over us, glimmer in the lights
Thought it will be sweet, but it's cinnamon and spice
Do it what you want, did it in my sights
Pay for my mistakes, now I'm living with the price
