[Godemis:]
Look at the way hate me now
The feeling of the night so long
I swear on everything that's left
I really wanna right my wrongs
But it's hard when the bottles popping
And you all in love and locked in
And you watching her body rocking
Knowing God is not an option
Company don't help you sleep
And the sex don't feel like love
When the hate don't make you weak
And the pills don't feel like drugs
What I really need is a buzz
Or whatever will keep me numb
But if I log on to the bullshit too long
Better not leave me that gun
I'mana go bananas on them
Gone on a bender, wavy acting ill
Hosted up at the bar taking shots
With a sad sack of happy pills, that's the deal
I feel I better leave before it gets ugly
I got a baby back at the crib
And no need for another drinking buddy

[Hook x2:]
I don’t sleep as much as you do
I’m hustling harder then you
Workin on more things than you do
Keeping my plate filled with good food
I don’t hit the town like you do
I don’t kick it like I used to
I don’t really trip as much as you do
I don’t really give a fuck what you do

[Ubiquitous:]
I’ve been living all around the world
You know the way the tour bus get around
Woke up with the room still dark
All alone laid up on the couch
With a pain in my brain from a dream that
I couldn’t tell you what was about
Look at the clock it was 5:45, I
Feel like there ain't nobody up in the town
But I get up and get a puff of the loud
Whatever’s sittin in the jar maybe one toke
Blow it out take a breath hit the dumbbells
Do a plank then it’s straight to the jump rope
What the day like, couple appointments
White board sittin with seven assignments
I’ve been lookin around all over the place
Dor the time to chill but never could find it
I’ve had my mind on you
That’s cool but now I gotta work on me
In the pursuit of love
Laughter and passion in my soul
I know I deserve all three
You’re double O-T, I ain't heard a word all week
I wonder would you wait for me?
When I’m on the grind, with my back turned
Would you act mature, or would you play make believe?
Have faith in me
I was out in the crowd at a show
A juggalo disturbed my lane
He said to me that he had never heard my name
And uh, that I didn’t deserve my chain
I said I had to work my way up from the bottom
To earn my place, you gon’ learn today
Here hit the smoke, listen close
To every damn word I say you bitch!

[Hook x2:]
I don’t sleep as much as you do

I don’t kick it like I used to
I don’t really trip as much as you do
I don’t really give a fuck what you do
