[Bre the 1st Lady:]
Crystal black pearl interior, ebony
Riding like a Lost Boy, feeling like a Kennedy
Repping west hemisphere, my med is amphetamine
My mellow my Benzedrine, my ghetto celebrity

[Godemis:]
Ain't no time to fuck around
It sound like we got a hit
If you call yourself a rapper, that just mean you gotta spit
All I hear is bars about these bitches and Bugatti shit
Everybody hating, ain't enough to get new Godi lit

[Info Gates:]
John C. Holmes in the kitchen, fuck him and beat him
Y'all are ass backwards like if you can't join 'em then beat 'em

[Joey Cool:]
See me finger fuck the world while you fuckers fighting for freedom
They be trying to put the scope on the demon but never see him
Believe what you see and what they can add at a pair a diem
Now gates make a marinate, light the grill up and fucking eat 'em

[Ubiquitous:]
So what's the reason for jealousy, envious lust and treason
You feel like we're Justin Bieber, I feel like you must be dreaming
For real

[JL:]
We been scheming up and in the pop offs
Everybody got my side guns
We the definition of a squad goes hard
Line 'em up, that's what the blindfold's for
Strange bro, that's happening
Gang flow, that's gassing
Kill in cold blood fashion
Then we carry our gold pass it

[Bre the 1st Lady:]
Crystal black pearl interior, ebony
Riding like a Lost Boy, feeling like a Kennedy
Repping west hemisphere, my med is amphetamine
My mellow my Benzedrine, my ghetto celebrity

[Ubiquitous:]
U-B-I be, I be, all up in your favorite places
We gotta be paid, we made it
We don't want my name in faces
But that doesn't make me famous
They said that we Boujee, they basic
Committee come get it straightened
And killer, the city where ghetto celebrity stat was generated

[JL:]
The levels were penetrated
Incredibles demonstrated
Play to pay them keeping them sedated
Slated get 'em keeping them persuaded

[Info Gates:]
Ultra uno, CES
You're listening to killer city's best
I ain't playing, players the only button you should press
Do we hustle, yes, muscle chest midwest
Specialists'll catchin' wreck
You catching up, we catching checks

[Godemis:]
Place your bet, better put respect on it
And I reckon no enemies want it
I'm reppin' KCC on it
And it seems we see no opponents

[Joey Cool:]
You know what I swing for the fences
It ain't no suspense and I beat on my chest like an ape
And I like goin' to the booth while I'm wearing a suit and come out in a cape
And I'm out of your reach but I'm all in your face
While we be in this bitch, we are vain in this space
All you ratatouille rappers stuck in the race
Talking all gas pedal no brakes

[Bre the 1st Lady:]
Crystal black pearl interior, ebony

[Info Gates:]
Who got them dope lines
Who selling Ajax
They wanna get paid, we want some payback
This year's that Trayvon and Freddy Gray rap
Rock 'em like Aesop, I mean like A$AP
These pussies name drop but never say jack, they whack

[Joey Cool:]
Get down on your lay flat
Careful where you try'na take that
Still picking up lines by the fist
Sixth time, you don't play that

[Godemis:]
Take 'em back into an ADAT
Stretch 'em out just like a wave cap
Anybody fucking with the committee we chaining 'em up on the train tracks

[Ubiquitous:]
Take 'em way back where I forged this
Off of forty third street and Warwick
Til the coordinates up at Strangeland
Metamorphosis of a changed man

[Godemis:]
No coordinates for the game plan
And I'm staring at 'em through the ray bans
Hoping everybody's getting saved then
I'm a leave 'em in peace with an amen

[JL:]
Man it's overkill when they change hands
Altogether, it is monumental
Confident we in the right position
I will tell you bout it but it's confidential
Undeniably it is official
Bout to fuck 'em all and we will not be gentle
Who the hell is hating, we was sent to get you
This is motivation it is influential

[Ubiquitous:]
And I'm under the influence
And truly y'all never know how to settle
Moving on beyond the outer levels
This celebrity coming up out the ghetto
