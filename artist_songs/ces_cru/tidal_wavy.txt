[Godemis:]
We ain't rocking with you clowns never no more
It's going down a level, CES is on that deep shit
Tidal wavy so that shady gotta drown slow
I'm telling whoever could ever keep a secret
You hightailing, I ain't even tryna reach it
You only care about yourself and that's weak shit
Never mind that cosign, you can keep it
We not inspired by you liars in the least bit

Open non aggression, guess I had enough of static
I don't need a power circle, all of y'all can have it
I don't even wanna rap, I do this out of habit
The blackest magic, I can pull a hat out of a rabbit
It's a mystery, me and Ubi compatible
We making history silly you wanna battle who
We calling audible oughta knew we had a few
Life is a bitch with a lot of bit of an attitude
And I done seen it all around these parts
Growing numb to the bum bloody fucking retard
Never go to be smart, better know if we start
We hear to teach a rookie that the poetry's art
You can only see as far as the eye will allow
If you been rocking with us, then you feel it by now
I never met a copycat who stealing my style
Lot of rappers prob'ly wouldn't if they only knew how
So

We ain't rocking with you clowns never no more
It's going down a level, CES is on that deep shit
Tidal wavy so that shady gotta drown slow
I'm telling whoever could ever keep a secret
You hightailing, I ain't even tryna reach it
You only care about yourself and that's weak shit
Never mind that cosign, you can keep it
We not inspired by you liars in the least bit

[Ubiquitous:]
Fuck your conspiracy theories just know that we conspire
I contemplate whether a man soul can be acquired
I'm walking on a wire, wonder what they desire
To see me succeed or tumble into a lake of fire
I'm in the same attire in the act got the lost
How can you do nothing but win and end up at a loss
I had to laugh it off, acting like he had the sauce
These hackers say I had a cross from the baddest boss
I'm sick as hell, pissing blood, used to have a cough
I hunt 'em down and hunt 'em all, same as Saginaw
We walk a war path, had to cross a dice road
Living for self and only self, you're prone to die alone
Rocking the microphone, CES is like a cyclone
Making the sky glow, turn up, call the dial tone
Get off your iPhone, boy I'm in the rhyme zone
Walking over pine-cones shining like a rhinestone
