[Godemis:]
Tyson with the punchline, pray I never sock a chick
Campin' on the low, back when black connect was droppin' shit
If it's on the TV, probably never see me rockin' it
Gotta know what's popular so I can do the opposite
Homie I don't follow trends, conin' with a lot of friends
Never leave the house, if I went out, you know I got it in
Quickest way for me to loosen up is with a lot of gin
Stumble in the party, everybody holla not again
Yeah the haters spotted him, he be wavin' at em' too
They ain't hurtin' nothin' over here, so I play it cool
I remember when I would've went in, but I'm off that
Instead of blowin' up, I'm growin' up and I can floss that
You fucking with the boss, Jack
What are you a cashier?
Prolly count it quick fast friend, get a cash here
Really need to Ã¡ndale, I'm giving you a pass here
Plus you got your body full of molly, same as last year

[Godemis (Ubiquitous):]
I think it's sort of sad, ain't a damn thing changed
Ubi what they doin' bro?
(Bro they on the same thing)
You must be fucking with me, right?
(No they on the same thing)
Oh they on that same same?
(Bro they on that same same)

[Ubiquitous:]
Female or male, white and black all American
Create the color contrast for comparison
Icon class bombastic, I buried him
Erosion for your axle, hack and slash, so cesarean
Assholes are arrogant, maybe they need therapy
Welcome to the terrordome, clara- for your clarity
Powered by the metronome, not so necessarily
By any means, truth tellin' chopping at your cheery tree
Copy cats stare at me, I react hysterically
Catch you for your copyrights, consequence of charity
Do it for my day-one's, double back on day two
Curse upon my name and now I'm coming back to slay you
Same game, same crew, came in with the same shoes
Same clothes, twenty-three days still I can't lose
Same mood no matter the difference of the day I do this
Same shit, smooth bro, I do it like my debut
Yeah!

(Bro they on that same same)
