[Intro – Godemis:]
Alright, I’m back
Deevil! Deevil! Deevil!
Your cunting daughter

[Verse 1 – Godemis:]
Who gives a shit if angel and demon engage in combat
I’m raw as fresh pussy, that’s with our without the contact
Those who told me don’t be a dummy, and sign a contract
This one is for your melon, Magellan, hope you don’t mind that
I got her under the water, holding it down
Head cooked through, Charlie go and roll em around
Nobody’s leaving, not even a soul
So sit the fuck down, eat it, and let the control go, sinner
You having nightmares, funny, I’m having worse dreams
I woke crying blood, little hand on the 13
Came on her face and before the semen could dry
Hit the L, hot as hell, and put it out in her eyes, right?
I got my hands full, Deevil doing his damn thing
Saw the S and the M, they blew it, knew it was Strange
I don’t repent ever, cynic, see I attack herds
And you can get the saw like I flipped was backwards

[Hook – Godemis (x2):]
Clear the table, they ready for me to carve her
I can’t see, they follow me, I’m headed to the slaughter
Nobody ever said it’d be easy to be a martyr
You won’t find your daughter, she’s in here with us father

[Verse 2 – Godemis:]
Who are we? never mind, your mother told me to tell you
That she’s in here with us and you’re probably coming to hell too
Well who goes there? Sit and stay for an hour
Imma keep it moving with a vulgar display of power
The whole clique strange, it’s logic, I represent it
So you either come in peace, or leave here resting in it
Dig it, I shovel coals right under the iron bull
Steaming broads in its belly, I guess you could say he’s full
But for fucks sake, give me a broom, a virgin, and some duct tape
I show you motherfuckers the definition of butt rape
And this here is for her, bathing in such atonement
By feeling so alive in this subtle murderful moment
And this is for the underlings that I be getting stoned with
And everything is under me so I see no opponent
Rock with a couple of brothers and so it smashes
Till I get the caskets, ashes to ashes

[Hook x2]

[Outro – Godemis:]
Strange Music
Deevil
[?]
Alright? Ring!
Oh yeah, align your chakras
I’m headed to the slaughter, headed to the slaughter
Later
