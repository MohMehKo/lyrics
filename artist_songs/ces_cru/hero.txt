[Godemis:]
I'm aware that right now a lot of us feel like chips are down
Sick of bein' kicked around
Thrown on the ground, picked right back up then tossed in the lost and found
Stumblin', lost your ground but it sounds like a chance for you to recover quickly
If you know anything about a struggle at all, the hustle is real, you probably already get me
So I need all of you with me
The Killer City committee, the Middi West version
Of the Avengers goin' harder than Bobby and Whitney
The enemy's shifty, so we gotta react swiftly
Whenever negativity hit me, I try to get it in check quickly
Came to know playing the role of a psycho is not gon' fit me
Cause I'm not so fifty, but I do know this
We all have the power, in every moment the time is ours
Counting minutes, seconds, hours
Death to cowards, fight the power
Smite the lions, light the fires -
Brighter, higher, 'till we burn 'em down
Take the tables that we turn around
It's worth the search if freedom's found
(And you're a hero)

[Mackenzie Nicole:]
What we need is a hero
Someone who's always strong
A source of light when things go wrong
What we need is a - hero
Who's always there to take flight
Who can mend our wounds and defends our rights
What we need is a hero
Someone prepared to lead the way
Who can brave our world and save our day
Hero, who always knows what to do
Someone like me
Someone like you
What we need is a hero

I watch it all unfold, and then I take my chosen road
This one goes out to everybody livin' state to state, place to place, and coast to coast
They're ridin' in, committin' acts of violence that leave us divided, you can take your own control
The kids lookin' up to us for guidance, now they wanna try it, how were they supposed to know?
It's like we all wanna fly (Uh), nobody wanna phone on the line but
Sometimes you gotta swallow your pride and apologize
For all of the time you were wrong and cauterized the wounds that we harbor inside (Uh)
Ain't nobody perfect, we need to organize the community, stop living like Lord of the Fly
I know it might seem hard, it's important to try to keep a light on and centered at the core of your life
Go to war with a mic
Shoot 'em down with a peace sign
The system of control is an intelligent design
It need a second look, and many elements refined
We're lookin' for a hero that can help us defeat crime and settle the beef
If you only throw a rock at police lined, you're really not a rebel to me
It isn't us vs. them, we all one, stand together in unity better than lyin' dead in the street
(And what we need is a hero)
