[Intro: Liz Suwandi]
Take off your blind fold
Tell me what you see
Interchanging doors
Not a corridor or screen
Your naked eye
Trapped inside a dream
Unveil your disguise
Because nothing's what it seems

[Hook x2: Liz Suwandi]
You can tell me what you want
You can tell me what you need
But love is in the smoke
And we can't even breathe
And I can not see you
And You can not see me
But love is in the smoke
And we can't even breathe

[Verse 1: UBI]
You take everything you want, you take what you need
And me shattered into pieces is what you leave
It don't matter what they see, no it just can't be
Now our love is in the smoke, and I just can't breathe
You got me gaspin'
I know when it will happen
Zappin' all my energy, its sexual harassment
You see I'll never be the same, now that we got close
Now my passion is for pain and I breathe hot smoke
Your love is like a drug, I wanna taste it
So slip it in my blood, I'm gonna take it
Addicted to your buzz, I'm wishin' that you was mine
Sittin in your sunshine so amazin'
I'm baskin' in the light
Light castin' through the haze
Maybe we were meant to be
Maybe not, who could say
Now I look for you again
But I still can't see
Cuz our love is in the smoke
Baby we can't breathe

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Godemis]
I smell the smoke in the room
The room is'a buzzin'
She told me that the roof was on fire
I knew it wasn't
Now the spot is heatin' up
Gettin' hotter under the collar
Let this motherfucker burn, shit
We don't need any water
We can teeter and totter
But you don't need to be coddled
I'm headed down this road alone
I don't want you to follow
I'm sittin' in the sun alone
Posted up in strangeland
Sippin' KC teas, bumpin' Kelvin rock and Raybans
Bitches think it's all about the pussy and a spray tan
To each it's own, if that completes your cypher, fuck it amen
It's hot as hell out here
Maybe degrees over
She feels like she got burns
Maybe she needs closure
It feels like the pilot light is out in this bitch
I'm still in the kitchen, like really this is as hot as it gets?
I'm starin' through the smoke, tryin' to catch a last vision of her
The smoke's rollin' upward while the flame's bein' smothered
