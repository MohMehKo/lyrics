I could tell you this, but you know it goes without saying
So I reminisce and all my thoughts just keep on playing
I don’t wanna think about this, there’s some other kind of daydream
So fall away with me

[Verse 1: Godemis]
This is a love song, this is for all y’all
Who shower us with your loving and make it all possible
I’m trying to put into words but I can’t explain
I think I got it in me, the shit is not in my brain
I’m smoking, maintaining, praying, saying amen’s
Staying, why you think of me they aren’t playing
Came in, new to it, knew it, might have pop in advance
By the stop, should I guess they like it a lot
And the shit’s cray’, my girl making tets me
I told her about all the dismay
She said holla at me, you always walk around this way
I think about dropping everything, going to fuck
Where my time is so short and I can’t afford to go fuck
Whether is week for a minute, but on a flip it is just bitter
I’d like a real conversation with her, be like
Fuck Twitter, we hardly know each other from Adam
And having time to have the time
To spend is too much to fathem, it’s like

[Hook: Liz Suwandi]

[Verse 2: Ubiquitous]
I can tell you this, but there’s nothing left to say
Caught up in yesterday, all my thoughts swept away
Look at the mess we made, girl, you made a mess of me
Searching for the rest of me got me up in Sesame
Uh, I’m reminiscing this rhythm by my memory
They can’t decide whether we are civilized or enemies
Now I’m just killing time, maybe time’s killing me
Stealing all my energy, the way I’m tired of feeling weak
Nothing is real it seems, struggle with reality
Still I dream a little dream, stuck in analogies
I feel like you’re haunting me, wonder what you want with me
Caught your eyes and I find you on my mind constantly
Sign a signal song to me, mellow melody
Harmonizing with another fellow, hello jealousy
You’re telling me you love me, call me up to play with me
I’m lost and feeling crazy till the day you fall away with me

[Hook: Liz Suwandi]

[Verse 3: Godemis]
This is a love song and y’all deserve one
In pinning this I couldn’t tell you where the word’s from
I understand we inspire you, motherfuckers
The fellas hopping and picking the bitches just wanna touch us
Fuck this, wrong rhythm, fuck it, I’m with him
I’m trying to make a friendly gefund of this, I’ll get him
They got the day and work my due, be street text me
Told me he was getting wavy ‘bout to roll up a freshy
I found you funny, he was using the slang
I text him back, I be doing it big and keeping it strange
Funny thing about it is I was working the double,
About to bubble, swearing, about to bubble
Second half of the double, feeling like my days are numbered
Doing this is the shit, it’s in the pockets
Some people want me to ruin it, I’m too in tune with it
Flying over the fucking moon with it
And I'mma share replaint with the mermaid and promise soon is it
