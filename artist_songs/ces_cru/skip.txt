[Intro: Ubiquitous]
Let me tell you 'bout my friend named Skip (S-Skip), Lou

[Hook: Ubiquitous (x2)]
Skip to my Lou, Skip to my Lou
Skip to my Lou, Skip to my Lou, my darling

[Verse 1: Ubiquitous]
Skip to my Lou, Lou skipped to class
Come up on some work now we gon' get some cash
Put it in a Pyrex, mix, swirl and bake
Put it on the block, now we flip pearl for paint
Uh, he coming up, he get girls away
But enemies him gotta exterminate
Gonna figure out if he get served he make
The same amount of cake that he get
Working late for eight week straight
Oh, that's some dough, dollar sign make it sound so rational
Pluggin' dudes in like a cold waxy-o
For Lou he can make a thing go clap for sure
Now he got a gat and he hold that you know
Christ up jeans and a throwback, you know
Watch and the chain and it's so plat, you know
Casey with the print so flat, you know
Now he got a gat and he hold that, you know
Christ up jeans and a throwback, you know
Watch and the chain and it's so plat, you know
KC fitted brim so flat, yo know
Uh, He got the block, he lock the street, he's making moves now
He's making moves now, see he make it move now
Now he got a gat and he hold that, you know
Christ up jeans and a throwback, you know
Watch and the chain and it's so plat, you know
KC fitted brim so flat, yo know
Uh, Yeah, he looking like a professional
Gangster, drug dealer that will go tap it all
So when you think the thing gonna clack you know
Who the director when you gon' act your role
Now the hood hot and the block filled with hate
The wrong motherfucker just got killed today
Ghetto vendetta when the block peel your face
The hole in the watch and will not spill the name
Well, plot's changed, things switch around
It's inevitable, the king gets the crown
The crown gets the price, the price hits the town
King dead 'fore the damn thing hits the ground
Bad mo'fucker sling English around
He don't like trouble but he brings it around
Run up on ya quick when the thing spits around
And take a half second, like click-click, then POW
What it was? Blood on the dutch
Wet like sweat but not from the buzz
He said cool when the word get to my crew
They be coming for you, too, Skip to my Lou

[Hook: Ubiquitous]
Skip to my Lou, Skip to my Lou
Skip to my Lou, Skip to my Lou, my darling
He got the block, he lock the street, he makin' moves now
He makin' moves now, see he make it move now
Now he got a gat and he hold that, you know
Christ up jeans and a throwback, you know
Watch and a chain and it's so plat, you know
KC fitted brim so flat, yo know
Now I got a gat and I hold that you know
Christ up jeans and a throwback, you know
Watch and a chain and it's so plat, you know
KC fitted brim, Skip, Skip, Skip

[Verse 2: Ubiquitous]
Skip to my Lou, guess who Skipped to class
Come up on some work, now I'm gon' to get some cash
