[Hook - Ubiquitous:]
Yo man, my mind is on this money, and I keep that money on me
Now we blowin' on that potent rollin' vibin' with my homies
CES from the show me so show me how high that you can go
Now we drivin' slow sippin' on somethin' ridin' through the MO

[Verse 1 - Godemis:]
I want the money, whoever shall disagree can suck it
It ain't a secret so peep it, I'm tryin' to Scrooge Mcduck it
Eatin' off thousand dollar shit that I did right
I get the cream but can't remember eating at midnight
It's just as well, must've puffed a nail with a gremlin
Then again, can't pretend that I'm not a sinner with synonyms
They don't put us on pedestals high as Tech, Eminem, and 'em
Look at me being Christian, I listen then I'm forgivin' 'em
Don't get it twisted you bitches, listen for disses closely
Spit in the face of a monkey tryin' to diss an OG
You wiggin' out, you get ya whole damn hood sprayed up
I'm off my rocker like an old man stood straight up
Been executed, rebooted, gotta be rare
Still might post up in a pic with a chick, I gotta be fair
Swear my bottom dollar is bloody buddy beware
If they dolin' out the duckets, well fuck it, Imma be there

[Post-Hook - Ubiquitous:]
Ri-Ridin' through the MO
Ridin' through the MO
Ridin' through the MO
Ri-Ridin' through the MO
Ridin' through the MO
Ri-Ridin' through the MO
Bro we from the show me now show me how high that you can go

[Verse 2 - Ubiquitous:]
Player play on if you're wicked than say your seance
Pray or be prayed upon, I'm shinin' when they throw the shade on
I'm sorry I'm late, leavin' early, I never stay long
When I'm on my James Bond, all y'all kiddies can play with crayons
City liaison laced me with a key, she hold connection
V.I.P special guest and for me and my soul collective
The S.O.P, I keep my letters signed with 'Os' and 'Xs'
Owner let me close the section, sex is a loaded weapon
Sippin' Amarone or Brunello from the Monticello
Slanted eye observe through to the cancer, I'm the calmest fellow
Accompanied by something dangerous walkin' on stilettos
Talkin' over contracts in the back, the dough was all but settled
On my level, fire flower resembled emerald city
Sweaty hippies hold me down, know my nose is rose pedal picky
Love me, she love me not, we translucent to opaque
Gave the bouquet the O.K and relocated to home base
Where the MO is at

Ri-Ridin' through the MO
Ridin' through the MO
Ridin' through the MO
Ri-Ridin' through the MO
Ridin' through the MO
Ri-Ridin' through the MO
