Your mother doesn't like me
Not one little bit
Your sister hates me too (yeah)
And if they could erase me
They'd get rid of it
That's exactly what they would actually do

What a disgrace
A kick to the face
What did I do to make you feel this way
Are you afraid
But I'm only man
But they say god these bones will never break
Killers make me wanna live!

It seems your out to get me
For the hell of it
You love to see me beg (yeah)
Your whispers don't effect me
Not one little bit
All you hear is no I'm not ready to bail

What a disgrace
A kick to the face
What did I do to make you feel this way
Are you afraid
But I'm only man
But they say god these bones will never break
Killers make me wanna live!

I could leave
No return
Forget the acid spilled from your tongue
And pretend like it doesn't burn
I could stay
Get in your face
Let you choke on words of the blood but I never would

What a disgrace
A kick to the face
What did I do to make you feel this way!

What a disgrace
A kick to the face
What did I do to make you feel this way
Are you afraid
But I'm only man
But they say god these bones will never break
Killers make me wanna live!
Live!
