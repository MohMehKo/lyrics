Dreams fade over time if you let them
And all of the pains you desire, you'll forget them
I'm always ready for the worst
And pulling out my hair [?]
All mad, all the pain, you're a friend, if you just use them

What good is getting sober
(When your life is too hard to)
Take a low when the bars is open
(You better find a way to)
Shifting, lifting, changing, rescripting
What good is a life of hungover
Oh oh

Drink enough to your health or to hurt you
Brave little girl in your mind, they abused you
All pain will never go away
If I'm always begging it to stay
Oh, dreams die over time if you let them

What good is getting sober
(When your life is too hard to)
Take a low when the bars is open
(You better find a way to)
Shifting, lifting, changing, rescripting
What good is a life of hungover
A life of hungover
A life of hungover, it's over, over

Blame yourself to go
Blame yourself to go
Shifting, lifting, changing, rescripting

What good is getting sober
(When your life is too hard to)
Take a low when the bars is open
(You better find a way to)
Shifting, lifting, changing, rescripting
What good is a life of hungover

Blame yourself to go
Blame yourself to go
Blame yourself to go!

What good is a life of hungover
