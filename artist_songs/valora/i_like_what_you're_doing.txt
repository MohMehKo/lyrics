I can tell that you've been here
You left a trail of fire on my lips
I can't put it out
I am breathing faster now
I'm picking up the scent of you and I
I can't put it down

There is something in the way
Your hair falls in your face
I wanna push away the strands
Feel you with my hands
Cause you don't understand

You don't even know what you're doing
But keep on doing it, doing it
Everything that I want you to
And I like it (I like what you're doing)
Just a look from you and I'm moving
Until you find it amusing
And you're getting me all confused
I don't mind it
I can't hide it

I like what you're doing (I like what you're doing)
I like what you're doing

I can't stay away from you
Your every move determines where I go (I go)
Because (you go)
I go (I go)
Cause I don't know

How to say goodbye
I want you all the time
It's killing me inside
The more I try and try
To get you off my mind

You don't even know what you're doing
But keep on doing it, doing it
Everything that I want you to
And I like it (I like what you're doing)
Just a look from you and I'm moving
Until you find it amusing
And you're getting me all confused
I don't mind it
I can't hide it

I like what you're doing (I like what you're doing)
I like what you're doing (I like what you're doing)
I like what you're doing (I like what you're doing)
I like what you're doing 

I like what you're doing (I like what you're doing)
I like what you're doing (I like what you're doing)

You don't even know what you're doing
But keep on doing it, doing it
Everything that I want you to
And I like it (I like what you're doing)
Just a look from you and I'm moving
Until you find it amusing
And you're getting me all confused
I don't mind it
No no no 

You don't even know what you're doing
But keep on doing it, doing it
Everything that I want you to
And I like it (I like what you're doing)
Just a look from you and I'm moving
Until you find it amusing
And you're getting me all confused
I don't mind it
I can't hide it
I can't hide it

I like what you're doing (I like what you're doing)
I like what you're doing (I like what you're doing)
I like what you're doing (I like what you're doing)
I like what you're doing
