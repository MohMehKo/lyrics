How much can you take before you break
Is there a point where it stops hurting
How long will you stay on the ground
When they push you down cause you won't play dirty
If you don't like the way they look at you
Then show another side they never knew
If you don't like the way they talk to you
Then tell 'em what is on your mind

React
Get up on a roof top
Sing with all that you got
React
Hold your head high
Like a shining star
Don't you dim your light, don't be silent
Even if you're scared you got to try it
React
Get up on a rooftop
Sing with all that you got

Your eyes tell me that you've been crying
With every tear your fire's dying
You heard what somebody was saying
You'll never make it but they were lying
You are getting closer every day
Nobody can take your dreams away
You know how to fight for what you want
And you don't have a thing to lose, no

React
Get up on a roof top
Sing with all that you got
React
Hold your head high
Like a shining star
Don't you dim your light, don't be silent
Even if you're scared you got to try it
React
Get up on a rooftop
Sing with all that you got

React
Whoa oh

How much can you take before you break
Is there a point where it stops hurting

React
Get up on a roof top
Sing with all that you got
React
Hold your head high
Like a shining star
Don't you dim your light, don't be silent
Even if you're scared you got to try it
React
Get up on a rooftop
Sing with all that you got
