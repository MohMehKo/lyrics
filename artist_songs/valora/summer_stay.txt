Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa

Another evening without you
Forgotten glow outside my window
This perfect thrill could never last
We knew and yet we couldn't let go

And what about the rest
It happened all too fast

Before I knew it there was no one
That could take your place, but
My open heart was just a shadow
Of your summer stay

Whoa whoa whoa

I wonder where you might be now
And if you think about me ever
And will we share another dance
So I could place my hand in your hand

Thought I don't wish for pain
I'd do it all again

Before I knew it there was no one
That could take your place, but
My open heart was just a shadow
Of your summer stay

Before I knew it there was no one
No one, no yeah
My open heart was just a shadow
Of your summer stay

Could you forget your summer stay
Would you forget your summer stay
Could you forget your summer stay
Would you forget your summer stay

Whoa whoa whoa
