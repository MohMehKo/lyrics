I was a rose, there was no name for my color
And I didn't grow, every inch so painful
I was a rock taken and thrown in the water
My dreams were shattered but you know I recovered

I am a summer electric angel
I came to see you, I can make your teardrops dry
I am a summer electric angel
I kill your darkness, I can make the monsters cry, cry

I was afraid before I got used to the weather
Let the sky rain, it brings the creeps together
It won't be long, you'll make it out of the storm
Another will come but you will never look back
Don't you ever look back

Hey!

I am a summer electric angel
I came to see you, I can make your teardrops dry
I am a hot hot fiery lover
I kill your darkness, I can make your monsters cry
I am a summer electric angel
I came to see you, I can make your teardrops dry

I was a rose, there was no name for my color
And I didn't grow, every inch so painful
I was a rock taken and thrown in the water
My dreams were shattered but you know I recovered

I am a summer electric angel
I came to save you, I can make your teardrops dry
I am a hot hot fiery lover
I kill your darkness, I can make the monsters cry
I am a summer electric angel (electric angel)
I can make your monsters cry
I am a summer electric angel
Summer
Summer
Summer
