I heard on Monday
I didn't shed a single tear
Was it anger or just fear
I wish I could have told you
How much I cared and I'd be there

But tears can't ever bring you back
They only stain

I lost what I loved
You'll never return
This life's become so irreversible
My damn tragedy
My eyes how they burn
This life is so irreversible

I tried to run away
To leave this place
I wandered through the streets alone
I'm surrounded
By your walls without you now

Who's to blame for all of this
Could it be me

I lost what I loved
You'll never return
This life's become so irreversible
My damn tragedy
My eyes how they burn
This life is so irreversible

So long to all you left behind
Did you think of me just
Once that miserable night
Want a way to be with you
Take my life too

I lost what I loved
You'll never return
This life's become so irreversible
My damn tragedy
My eyes how they burn
This life is so irreversible

(I lost what I loved)
How could you leave me here with all of them
(You'll never return)
It's taken me so long to clear out the past
(My damn tragedy)
I'd give anything to stand with you again
(This life's become so...)
So irreversible
