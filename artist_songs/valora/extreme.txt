Slice like a knife, your middle name's Danger
Hunting tonight, you kill the park ranger
Saving the life of any old stranger
You are large as a planet
But locked to the ground with attitude for days
Rock to the sound of any song you play
Shocking the crowd, smile on your face
I just can't understand it, no

Don't you think you are a little extreme?
Don't you think you are a little extreme?
Maybe, but then again this life is short

You are exactly what I'm looking for
You are the key that opens up the door
I'll take anything from you
I'd long to love you
You are exactly what I've waited for
Waiting has only made me love you more
Tell me what you're gonna do
I'm crazy into you

White picket fence, the typical picture
Think you should know that's not what I'm into
I'm not an ordinary girl, got your scent and
I'm gonna follow it
All of the girls think I'm a bit psycho
Maybe I am but that's the way I roll
And when I got you watch the whole world know
I am truly original

Don't you think you are a little extreme?
Don't you think you are a little extreme?
Maybe, but then again this life is short

You are exactly what I'm looking for
You are the key that opens up the door
I'll take anything from you
I'd long to love you
You are exactly what I've waited for
Waiting has only made me love you more
Tell me what you're gonna do
I'm crazy into you

Don't you think you are a little extreme?
Don't you think you are a little extreme?
Don't you think you are a little extreme?
Don't cha, don't cha, oh

I long to love you, I long to love you
I'm not enough
I long to love you, I long to lo-oh
I'm not enough
I long to love you, I long to love oh-oh
Tell me whatcha gonna do
I'm crazy baby into you

I long to love you, I long to love you
I'm not enough
I long to love you, I long to lo-oh
I'm not enough
I long to love you, I long to love oh-oh
Tell me whatcha gonna do
I'm crazy baby into you

You are exactly what I'm looking for
You are the key that opens up the door
You are exactly what I've waited for
Waiting has only made me love you

You are exactly what I'm looking for
You are the key that opens up the door
I'll take anything from you
I'd long to love you
You are exactly what I've waited for
Waiting has only made me love you more
Tell me what you're gonna do
I'm crazy into you

Don't you think you are a little extreme?
Don't you think you are a little extreme?
Don't you think you are a little extreme?
Don't cha, don't cha, don't cha don't cha, oh
