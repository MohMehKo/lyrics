I'm in the dark on the subject of who you are
But I'm in your car and I like what I see so far, yeah
I'm not gonna run from a good time if you seem fun
Let's go for a ride and we'll turn when we see the sun

Let's be bad like a wanted man
I can handle that
I don't think anybody's watching
Break some shit, I'm kinda liking this
Let's be bad I don't think anybody's watching
Yeah oh
I don't think anybody's watching
Yeah oh

Are you afraid to get tangled with me tonight?
Make no mistake, I might be dangerous but I'm nice
Kick it with me and get ready to see the stars
We'll see if you and me can crash a party and break some hearts

Let's be bad like a wanted man
I can handle that
I don't think anybody's watching
Break some shit, I'm kinda liking this
Let's be bad I don't think anybody's watching
Let's be bad
I don't think anybody's watching
Break some shit, I'm kinda liking this
Let's be bad I don't think anybody's watching

Let's be bad, be bad, be bad
Let's be bad, be bad, be bad
I don't think anybody's watching

Let's be bad, be bad, be bad
Let's be bad, be bad, be bad
I don't think anybody's watching

Let's be bad like a wanted man
I can handle that
I don't think anybody's watching
Break some shit, I'm kinda liking this
Let's be bad I don't think anybody's watching
Let's be bad
I don't think anybody's watching
Break some shit, I'm kinda liking this
Let's be bad I don't think anybody's watching

Let's be bad, be bad, be bad
Let's be bad, be bad, be bad
I don't think anybody's watching
