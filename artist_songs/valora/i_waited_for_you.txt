Hold the line
Never retreat and never break
I tried
But I'm addicted
I can't lie
Another step is in my sight
Another step I'll see the light

I waited for you
I waited so long
Told you before
Can't take anymore
I waited for you
I waited so long
I'm not coming home

Drenched in words 
You tell me I'm empty
Cause you know it hurts
Your eyes are spilling out what's real
Have I not held back the fight?
My body racing out tonight 

I waited for you
I waited so long
Told you before
Can't take anymore
I waited for you
I waited so long
Not coming home
Feel all alone

Take it slow
You tell me sweetie
Rest here with me
Don't move
I'll fight back 
And you won't expect it
Now I have to leave you

I waited for you
I waited so long
(I waited so long for you)
Told you before
(You promised me the world when you returned)
Can't take anymore
(You gonna come back empty handed)
I waited for you
(You think I'll be waiting for you)
I waited so long
(You better think again)
Not coming home
(And you'd better wake up)
Feel all alone
(Cause you're wrong)

I waited for you
I waited so long
Told you before
Can't take anymore
I waited for you
I waited so long
Not coming home
Feel all alone

I've always waited for you
But don't expect to see me now
Your little plan fell through
Tell me what's wrong with you (I waited for you)
I've always waited for you (I waited so long)
But don't expect to see me now (Told you before)
Your little plan fell through (Can't take anymore)
Tell me what's wrong with you (I waited for you)
