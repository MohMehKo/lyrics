If I dare to ascent so high to
Try your hand I will find you
Have not let go of mine
Spilling over me your affection
Covering for the lesson
I have failed to receive

God knows you don't have to stick around
God knows you don't have to stick around

You take it all
You want my love no matter what
Your fatal fall
You pick me up no matter what I do
You lose yourself
I give you the worst of me
My bed in hell
You love the worst of me

Your calming eyes repair all the damage
Clear the storm of my habit
I still darken your sky
It's not like I don't want to be better
I've been this way forever
Don't give up on me now

God knows you don't have to stick around
God knows you don't have to stick around

You take it all
You want my love no matter what
Your fatal fall
You pick me up no matter what I do
You lose yourself
I give you the worst of me
My bed in hell
You love the worst of me

A little more than all is what you've given to me
I am so corrupt, take me, take me up
A little more than all is what you've given to me
Curse the ones who crawl as they await defeat
I am so corrupt, take me, take me up

You take it all
You want my love no matter what
Your fatal fall
You pick me up no matter what
You take it all (A little more, is what you give)
You want my love no matter what (Take me, take me up)
Your fatal fall (A little more, is what you give)
You pick me up no matter what I do (A little more)
You lose (Is what you give)
Yourself (You take me up)
I give you the worst of me (A little more)
My bed (Is what you give)
In hell (You take me up)
You love the worst of me
