I'm on a mission
I'm heading for a big collision
I'm gonna take this plane right off the ground
I'm on a one-way street no turning back
And I can't lose what I don't have
I've always got this one foot in the grave

One step too late
Just one more and I could break
It ain't that bad

Can you save me now?
I'm already gone
Can you save me now?
I'm already lost
Can you save me now?
I'm already gone
If you won't help
Then don't complain
Can you save me now?

My mama's not there
She had a dream about me
That I would one day
Grow to be a good girl

One step too late
Just one more and I could break
It ain't that bad

Can you save me now?
I'm already gone
Can you save me now?
I'm already lost
Can you save me now?
I'm already gone
If you won't help
Then don't complain
Can you save me?

Take me, I'm shaking
From this dream I'm frozen in
I am ready to be taken somewhere
So far from here
Can you save me now?
Show me how

Can you save me now?
I'm already gone
Can you save me n-n-n-n-n-n-n-now?
I'm already lost
Can you save me now?
I'm already gone
If you won't help
Then don't complain
Can you save me now?

I want you to save me now
Take my hand and show me how
Don't you even dare to make a sound
If you're not gonna be around so
I want you to come save me now

If you won't help,
Then don't complain
Can you save me now?
