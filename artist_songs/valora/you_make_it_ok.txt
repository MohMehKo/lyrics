Your kiss is a moment
(I wish I could own it)
I know that it will end
(And what I will left with)
We're getting closer
(But your arms feel cold now)
This could be over
(What I'll be left with)

I wanna make this real
Yeah, yeah

Baby, if I make it easy
You may never love me
It's never gonna last
No no
Baby, you know I wanna like it
I can hardly take it
I wanna make it last
I wanna make this last

I'm trying to hide it
It's so hard to fight it
You're not gonna like it
But you know that I'm worth it
My heart is turning
You know that I'm burning
I'm finally learning
That I want you to love me
Oh yeah

I wanna make this real
Yeah, yeah

Baby, if I make it easy
You may never love me
It's never gonna last
No no
Baby, you know I wanna make it
I can hardly take it
I wanna make it last
I wanna make this last

Yeah

You make it ok
You make it ok
You make it everytime as if it was the last day
You make it ok
You make it ok
You make it everytime as if it was the last day
As if it was the last day

Baby, if I make it easy
You may never love me
It's never gonna last...

Baby, if I make it easy
You may never love me
It's never gonna last
No no
Baby, you know I wanna make it
I can hardly take it
I wanna make it last
I wanna make this last
I wanna make it last

You make it ok
You make it ok
You make it everytime as if it was the last day
You make it ok
You make it ok
You make it everytime as if it was the last day
As if it was the last day
