I gotta go
I can't hang around anymore
I'm staying around the room
Don't wanna know
Who you with the wall at the door
You've been making a product soon
I'm coming out with a bliss for dark
I've come afar pretty easy pretty anymore

Friend and enemies, yeah we both made a few
And my mistakes and breaks will come and hang around you
I don't wanna see what's up ahead
I don't wanna know what's sowing something
I'd rather be there [?]
It's better when you don't know better

I'm thinking back, everything was nothing but show
So really was wonderful
A sneak attack by information not even known
[?]
I'm coming out in the quiet dark
No turning back there's a comfort when you get this far

Friend and enemies, yeah we both made a few
And my mistakes and breaks will come and hang around you
I don't wanna see what's up ahead
I don't wanna know what's sowing something
I'd rather be there [?]
It's better when you don't know better

No bitter days when the lies be gone
We're shining now and I know

Friend and enemies, yeah we both made a few
And my mistakes and breaks will come and hang around you
I don't wanna see what's up ahead
I don't wanna know what's sowing something
I'd rather be there [?]
It's better when you don't know better
It's better when you don't know better
It's better when you don't know better
