Don't remember the night,
The burn of your eyes,
The moment I first knew you were mine.

You made me fall,
I just can't recall,
The beginning and how you stole it all.

Oh I never thought someone could kill my soul.
You held me in your arms as I let you go,
And now I'm all alone.

Oh, oh that's what I get for falling out of love.
Oh, oh that's what I get for fading out your touch.
This is my punishment for ever giving up,
We've finally become, forgotten.
Forgotten.

You made me alive,
How could I decide
To let all the memories just die?

Everything I did was to forget,
This overwhelming crush I'm feeling of regret,
That pushed me off the edge.

Oh,oh that's what I get for falling out of love.
Oh,oh that's what I get for fading out your touch.
This is my punishment for ever giving up,
We've finally become, forgotten.

I no longer feel you,
Not the way I used to,
And there's nothing beautiful,
So far from what I once knew.

Oh,oh that's what I get for falling out of love.
Oh,oh that's what I get for fading out your touch.
This is my punishment for ever giving up,
We've finally become, forever undone,
Forgotten.
