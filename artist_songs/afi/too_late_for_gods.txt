Come with us
To the water as we celebrate poolside
Silver lined sons and daughters
Take the big dive
Celebrate before rejection
Before this pool shows our reflection
Too well
Diamond impressions
Lay where we fell
Without discretion
All the questions they’ll ask
Were we raised this way?
Such a promising past
Mayday

Go down in glory
What did I tell you, I promised they’d take me too
Down with the heroes before me
What did I tell you, I promised I’d give you a story
Tell me a story

Now look down
From these great heights
Soaring pristine and private
Through the storm
We will cut right
Across the skyline
Celebrate, conjoin with this storm
And radiate
We international wraiths
With hearts we’ve stolen
Flee but can’t keep
A thing that is golden

They say nothing was found
When we hit the ground
Did I forget to say
Mayday
