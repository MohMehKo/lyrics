Hey it's good to see you
And you're doing well
But deep down I love you
As you can probably tell
I wished I could believe
I could be the one
To care for and love you baby
As I could have done

I know now that everything had to end this way
I wanted to believe in love
That it would finally stay
And I send you to the world
And I send you with a kiss
I know now that you're the one
That I will always miss.

Hey it's good to see you
And you're doing well
But deep down I love you
And I feel like hell
I wished I could believe
I could be the one
To care for and love you baby
As I could have done

I know now that everything had to end this way
I wanted to believe in love
That it would finally stay
And I send you to the world
And I send you with a kiss
But I know now that you're the one
That I will always miss.
