I want you to want me
I need you to need me
I'd love you to love me
I'm beggin' you to beg me

Shine up my old brown shoes
Put on a brand new shirt
Get home early from work
You say that you love me
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I
See you cryin'
Oh, Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I,
See you cryin'
Feelin' all alone without a friend
You know you feel like dyin'
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I
See you cryin'

I want you to want me
I need you to need me
I'd love you to love me
I'm beggin' you to beg me

I want you to want me
I want you to want me
I want you to want me
I want you to want me
