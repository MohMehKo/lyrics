I'm so scared, empty,
No colour print of me, of me, of me,
I'm nobody
I stayed out, all night
Thought it was all up with me
All up with me, too scared, not fair
You're not around
I'm so alone, I'm so alone inside
I'm so alone, winter has drowned
My heart is down
Little me, little me you see

Light me up, light me up, we can never go wrong
Light me up, light me up, I’m so cold, it’s so wrong
Please come to me,
Please come to me,
I dare, I care
Light me up, light me up,
We can never go wrong
Light me up, light me up,
I’m so cold in my song
Please come to me, it’s all I need
Please come to me

Eyes wide open, can’t sleep
Night is burning, red, red, red, red
Silence is dead
Don’t belong here, you see
Thought life would bring me mystery
Sole mystery
No trace, no face, just misery
Speak up, I know the rain
Speak up, you know the pain
Speak up, speak up

Light me up, light me up
I can never go wrong
Light me up, light me up
I’m so cold, it’s so wrong
Please come to me, please come to me
I dare, I care
Light me up,
We can never go wrong
Light me up,
I’m so cold in my song
Please come to me
It’s all I need
Please come to me
Speak up, speak up
