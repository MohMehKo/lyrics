I hope I see you soon,
Because you're fond of me and I am fond of you.
These days I guess that's all it takes,
That and just a few mistakes.
And I have made mistakes,
Yes I have made mistakes today,
Yes I have made mistakes today,
Yes I have made mistakes

So tonight I'll be your Brooklyn,
So cold and yet so far away!
Just tell me what you want for me to say,
And if it brings you home?

I guess its safe to say,
We both could use this fire escape,
Cause I've been breathing ashes in,
And I've been waiting for something to carry you away.

Cause I have made mistakes today,

Yes I have made mistakes today,
Yes I have made mistakes

So tonight I'll be your Brooklyn,
So cold and yet so far away!
Just tell me what you want for me to say,
And if it brings you home?

So I hope you travel safe,
And I hope you're cool
I hope you find your way,
Because it's sad but it is safe to say,
We disagree on one too many things.

And I have made mistakes today,
Yes I have made mistakes today,
Yes I have made mistakes?
