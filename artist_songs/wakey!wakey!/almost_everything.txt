Just lay down with me before you go
It's the wrong thing I know
But I don't know when I will see you again
And it gets so lonely

You'd be be foolish if you stayed here now
Maybe if you leave we can work it out
Cause I know the city only breaks you down
And it gets you lonely
Yeah, it's gonna get lonely

You miss the feeling when you step outside
And then your mind comes all untied
And then you open up your eyes
And you don't feel lonely

And it feels bad now but it's gonna get better
Someday

And it feels bad now but it's gonna get better
And it feels bad now but it's gonna get better
And it feels bad now but it's gonna get better
And it feels bad now but it's gonna get better
Someday

Yeah, Someday

And it feels bad now but it's gonna get better
And it feels bad now but it's gonna get better
And it feels bad now but it's gonna get better
And it feels bad now but it's gonna get better
Someday
