Sky so beautiful it can't be real
I've got a heart so full that i's all i feel
The sky it fades from black to blue
And I fall apart when I picture you
Under a sky so beautiful it can't be real

Singing all of those nights on the Lower East Side
If you hadn't been there I'd have never survived
And we sang from our hearts and we drank till we dropped 

And I swore as I laid by your side

That I would love you always and forever
We would be together for all time
Now I carry you forever with me 
Darling please believe me that you're all I see
Every time I see

A sky so beautiful it can't be real 
I've got a heart so full that it's all I fell
I dream so hard when I dream of you
You come walking in and you run me through
And a sky so beautiful it can't be real
