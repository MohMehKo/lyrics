I was there when your heart broke
Was there when you lost hope
I was there when your heart split
Roof to the pavement

They don't know you like I know you
They don't hold you like I hold you
They don't know you at all
They don't know you like I know you
They don't hold you like I hold you

Lost for a lost cause
Dark as a heart gets
Not what you hoped for
Just what your heart did

Nothing good can come and diss it all
Nothing good can come and diss it all
Nothing good can come and diss it all
Nothing good, nothing good, nothing good, nothing good, nothing good
Nothing good can come and diss it all
Nothing good, nothing good
But hang up and hold on
Hang up and hold on

They don't know you like I know you
They don't hold you like I hold you
They don't know you at all
They don't know you like I know you
They don't hold you like I hold you
But hang up and hold on
Hang up and hold on
Hang up and hold on
Hang up and hold on
Hang up and hold on
Hang up and hold on
Hang up and hold on
Hang up and hold on
Hang up and hold on
Hang up and hold on

Were they there when your heart broke?
Were they there when you lost?
