I am the long shot
I am the sore spot
I am the tragedy
You've been waiting to happen

I am the loose end
You'll never tied up
The roof caving in
You always knew it would happen

And though I
I noted my television lies, I
I've been an overreactivist my whole life

We're alright and we're alright
We're alright and we're alright
We're alright and we're alright
We're alright, alright
We're alright and we're alright
We're alright and we're alright
We're alright and we're alright
We're alright, alright

I'm the earthquake
I'm the stomach ache
The limb that breaks
That told me that it could happen

I am the car crash
The brake finally snaps
The whole collapse
We always knew it would happen

And though I
I noted my television lies, I
I've been an overreactivist my whole life

We're alright and we're alright
We're alright and we're alright
We're alright and we're alright
We're alright, alright
We're alright and we're alright
We're alright and we're alright
We're alright and we're alright
We're alright, alright

I am the long shot
I am the sore spot
I am the tragedy
You've been waiting to happen

We're alright and we're alright
We're alright and we're alright
We're alright and we're alright
We're alright, alright
We're alright and we're alright
We're alright and we're alright
We're alright and we're alright
We're alright, alright
We're alright
