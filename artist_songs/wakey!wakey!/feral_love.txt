Arm your guards, un-break your horses
Ours is feral love
Call your dogs and special forces
All will come undone

But I bet you don’t go crazy like you used to
But I bet you don’t go crazy like you used to
I bet you don’t go crazy like you used to
When you used to get down with me…

Flee the scene, we scream ceasefire
Look at what you’ve done
All your men, and all your horses
Scream enough’s enough

But I bet you don’t go crazy like you used to
But I bet you don’t go crazy like you used to
I bet you don’t go crazy like you used to
When you used to throw down with me…

My love what have you done
My love what have you done
My love what have you done
My love what have you done

My love what have you done
My love what have you done
My love what have you done
