I'll forget everything that you do 
And pretend that I dreamt me and you 
If the thing that you need isn't here with me

Then go on and find the world you want
You'll always have this heart as your homeland
You know I'll be here for you love
And you'll always have this heart as your homeland

If you feel what you need is to run
From your life and the things it's become
Then don't worry for me 
If it's what you need
