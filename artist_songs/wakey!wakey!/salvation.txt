I was lost but now I'm found
What a beautiful moment
Finally I got it figured out 
I got so tired of not knowing

You and what you're doing through

Salvation comes like a light turned on 
Salvation comes, salvation comes
Salvation comes like a light turned on 
Salvation comes 

You're just lost but you'll be found
It's all there where you're going 
Just breathe in and then breathe out
Close your eyes and just know it 

Salvation is never giving up
On the ones you love
Salvation is never giving up 
On the ones you love

When there's no one left to lift you up
You reach up, you reach up 
You'll grow taller, it'll all the smaller
If there's no one left to lift you up 
You reach up, you reach up 
Til your arms become wings
And they lift you, lift you 
And they'll lift you, lift you

Yeah we all wanna be loved
Yeah we all wanna be loved
So don't give up, don't give up, 
Yeah, we all wanna be loved
