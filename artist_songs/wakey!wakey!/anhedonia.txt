I know you're not perfect
But you've come a long way
If it's all you can take to stay around
If it's something you need I'll hold you know

Anhedonia why you wanna come stay with me?
I'm tired of waking up and I'm tired of sleep
And if you don't really know what you're doing to me 
It's okay

Just to stay in the moment 
If it's all you can do
To just keep on going when the sun goes down
To just keep on going when they're not around

Cause kid you know the way home
Kid you know the way home 
Kid you know the way home

Cause nobody's perfect
