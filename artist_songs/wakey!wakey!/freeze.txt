When the sun comes out again
Everything is gonna be alright
Alright
If you wait with me till then
Maybe we could be each other's light

Cause I've been
Waiting for you the way that
These city sidebars freezing
Wait for the summertime

I've been
Waiting for you for always
If you don't give up on me
I won't give up on you

Let the winter be our friend
And excuse to hold each other tight
Lately with the state I'm in
You're the only thing that sets me right

And I've been
Waiting for you the way that
These city sidebars freezing
Wait for the summertime

I've been
Waiting for you for always
If you don't give up on me
I won't give up on you

I've been
Waiting for you the way that
These city sidebars freezing
Wait for the summertime

I've been
Waiting for you for always
If you don't give up on me
I won't give up on you
