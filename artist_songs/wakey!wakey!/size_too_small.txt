I was your best man
in a size too small
You were my best friend
going at it all

What if I had put off my inheritance?
Where is the best man all arises all in peace?
Cause I still know you
And I still like you
The best man, and I still owe...

Everything rises, going at it all
All the surprises in a size too small
And what if I - I told you I was in love with this?
Would you surprise us in a size for all of me?
Cause I still know you
And I still like you
The best man, yeah I still know you
The best man, yeah I still owe you
