I'll tell you how it feels love you should know 
I love you like the pavement loves your soles 
But don't you worry love I'm in no hurry love
I wouldn't worry love we'll keep it slow

I stutter when I speak tongue twisted tied
Got to find a way to make you smile
But don't you worry love I'm in no hurry love
I wouldn't worry love I'm not coming undone

I just want to stop the world and dance with you
i just want to stop the world and dance with you
You say the world keeps rolling over on you 
Let it go, give it up 

Try to keep my head now keep control
So stupid when I get emotional
But don't you worry love if I start slurring love
If lines get blurry love it's because

Yeah you know
Yeah you know, girl you know
Just say the word
We'll get lost without a trace
Yeah you know
Girl you know, girl you know
Wanna go
And get lost without a trace?
