I'll be Adam if you'll be Eve
We can start it over
You and me got a whole new thing
A whole new thing

But as I live and as I breathe
The more I love the more you leave
Still I hope and still I pray
That I could learn to make you stay

You and I are still a seed
Reaching for the sunlight
Pushing up through the rocks and weeds
Trying to grow upright

But as I live and as I breathe
The more I love the more you leave
Still I hope and still I pray
That I could learn to make you stay

(Stay love)
(Stay love)

I'll be Adam if you'll be Eve
And we can start it over
I'm in your garden on my knees
And saying it's not over

As I live and as I breathe
The more I love the more you leave
Still I hope and still I pray
That I could learn to make you stay

I'll be Adam if you'll be Eve
You can get me in the trouble
