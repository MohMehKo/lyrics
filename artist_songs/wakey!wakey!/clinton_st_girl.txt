Clinton St Girl
She's got the world on her shoulders
She's got a light in her eyes
Clinton St Girl
Knows famous artists like feelings
Knows when she's wrong and she lies
And Ludlow St boys
Yeah we do what we please
And Ludlow St boys
Never say what we mean
And Ludlow St boys
When we fall keep our hands in our empty pockets
And land on our chins and go?
Clinton St Girl
Sidewalks and bank accounts, day counts
She either laughs or she cries

Clinton St Girl
She's harmful and hateful and foolish
I'll love her the rest of my life
And Ludlow St boys
Yeah we do what we please
And Ludlow St boys
Never say what we mean
And Ludlow St boys
When we fall keep our hands in our empty pockets
And land on our chins
And we go home bleeding
Yeah and we go home bleeding?
