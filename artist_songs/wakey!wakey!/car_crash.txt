You’re flat on your face in a field 50 feet from a burning Cadillac
At least you were thrown clear, I’m still stuck in here
Kick off my shoes I let the flames crawl up and burn right through me
I'm silent as a movie, I always thought you knew me better

At least you were thrown clear
I’m still stuck in here
At least you were thrown clear
At least you were thrown clear
I’m still stuck in here
And I’m still stuck

And now you are hurt, and you are sure I could not be hurt too
And just because you’re bleeding you think that I’m not bleeding
And just because you’re full of yourself doesn’t mean I’m not full of you

At least you were thrown clear
I’m still stuck in here
At least you were thrown clear
At least you were thrown clear
I’m still stuck in here
And I’m still stuck

And so we burn silently
Silent nights silent days
And so we burn silently
It just seems wrong

At least you were thrown clear
At least you were thrown clear
At least you were thrown
