Who will save us now?
Who's gonna light the torch and lift us out
And there's no charity
Just homeless poets military police

Such a worthless thing
Learning a language lost nobody can speak
There's no symphony
I'm trying to care but you don't care about me

And you know enough's enough
And I'm thinking we've had enough
Yeah, I'm thinking we've had enough
And you know enough's enough
And I'm thinking we've had enough
I'm thinking we've had enough
Yeah, I'm thinking we've had enough

Keep my head held high
But keep my eyes wide and my mouth shut tight
It's so hard to breathe
But there's nobody left that's listening

And you know enough's enough
And I'm thinking we've had enough
Yeah, I'm thinking we've had enough
And you know enough's enough
And I'm thinking we've had enough
Yeah, I'm thinking we've had enough
And you know enough's enough
And I'm thinking we've had enough
Yeah, I'm thinking we've had enough
And you know enough's enough
And I'm thinking we've had enough
Yeah, I'm thinking we've had enough
Yeah, I'm thinking we've had enough
