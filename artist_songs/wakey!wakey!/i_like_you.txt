I just wanna talk to you
I just wanna hear your voice again
I just wanna let you know
Wherever I may go you're with me 
Cause I like you, I like you
I like you, I like you
I like you a lot 

All of the words on a screen
They don't mean a thing
Til you say them to me
Here on my own 
When I'm alone 
They're all I read all day

All of the words that I type
Feel so black and white
When I can't hear you smile
I need your voice
To cut through the noise
Nothing else sounds so right 

You, you're the one worth waiting for 
When I don't wanna wait no more
