I guess you know why they're all looking at you
For me it started when I turned twenty-two
You count your blessings, but you're still black and blue
You should go home before your money's all gone

You said it was over but it started again
Said it was easy, but you still never win
It was done before it started, and they're not your friends
You should go home before your money's all gone
You should go home before your money's all gone

I hope you know that I don't like you this way
I know you lost it, but you still try and stay
It was sad and now it's over, there's nothing left to say
You should go home before your money's all gone
You should go home before your money's all gone
