Still after all this time
Wondering where you are
I look for you and I
Go anywhere at all
These streets were yours and mine
Maybe it's time I love Brooklyn

As the world stop turning
Stop turning
Stop turning
Stop turning
Stop turning
As the world stop turning
Stop turning
Stop turning
Stop turning
Stop turning

You protect me now from my
Suffering I'm in my head
I know it's not your fault
But I'm back here again
And you look like all the girls
That I see walking through Brooklyn

As the world stop turning
Stop turning
Stop turning
Stop turning
Stop turning
As the world stop turning
Stop turning
Stop turning
Stop turning
Stop turning

Cause I don't feel anything at all
I don't feel anything at all

As the world stop turning
Stop turning
Stop turning
Stop turning
Stop turning

So now you're somewhere else
Making their streets feel like Brooklyn

As the world stop turning
Stop turning
Stop turning
Stop turning
Stop turning
As the world stop turning
Stop turning
Stop turning
Stop turning
Stop turning

Cause I don't feel anything at all
I don't feel anything at all
I don't feel anything at all
I don't feel anything at all

As the world stop turning
Stop turning
Stop turning
Stop turning
Stop turning
As the world stop turning
