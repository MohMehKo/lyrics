I know you wanna stay in bed
But it’s light outside
It’s light outside
So know I'm gonna stay right here
You saved my life once
You saved my life

And I
Will try
To get you up
Cause it’s beautiful outside
And we’ll fall
But we’ll try
We’ll do our best
And I’ll love you all the while
Because you saved my life once
Because you saved my life once

I know you wanna rest your head
And just forget the night
Forget the night
So know I’m gonna stay right here
I’ll sit by your side
Sit by your side

And I
I’ll try
To get you up
It’s beautiful outside
We’ll fall
But we’ll try
We’ll do our best
And I’ll love you all the while
Because you saved my life once
Because you saved my life once
Because you saved my life once
Because you saved my life once

I think I always knew you would be
I think I always knew you would be 
The greatest
The greatest

I think I always knew you would be
I think I always knew you would be 
The greatest
The greatest

Because you saved my life once
Because you saved my life once
Because you saved my life once
Because you saved my life once
