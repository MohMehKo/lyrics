If love's gonna make me waste my youth
I'm gonna waste it all on you
If love's gonna make me come undone 
Drain my heart then fill it up 

Then on my knees I'm fallen
On my Lord I'm calling
Oh my Lord, just to get me through the night

All it takes is a little love

I want love to catch me when I land
I want a love to help me take a stand
It's love that made me who i am
And it's love that's gonna make me a better man

When I've lost then will that lifts me up 
The will that carries me outside my door
When I've lost the will to fight
Will you carry me?
Could you carry me?

All it takes is a little love
