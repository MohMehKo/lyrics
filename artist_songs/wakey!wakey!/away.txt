I want to lie in this gutter with you
Close our eyes and wait til this thing passes through
Put on our favorite shirts, pretend we don't hurt
And go out the way that we used to do

But it's all gone away and it's all on me.
It's all gone away since the doldrum days came

Get down on my knees and say all of the things
You wanted to hear when you walked out on me
Forget all our sins and just let it begin
When you knocked on the door and I let you back in
But the windows are blacked
And the baseboards are cracked
The roof's caving in, and your not coming back

'Cause it's all gone away and it's all on me.
It's all gone away since the doldrum days came

It's all gone away
