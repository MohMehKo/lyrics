Lily, I love you
Lily, I love you
Lily, I love you, but I just don't see
Maybe it's you
Maybe it's me
Trying to be everything I think you need
And maybe you love me
Maybe you don't
Maybe I'm scared of waking up alone
If you think you're gonna leave
Then you better say so
Lily, I really really hope you don't

Careless love
You're an animal
You've got falling stars, but your eyes
Shine so bright
Constellations, they burn jealous of your light

Lily, I love you
Lily, I love you
Lily, I love you, but I just don't see
Maybe it's you
Maybe it's me
Trying to be everything I think you need
And maybe you love me
Maybe you don't
Maybe I'm scared of waking up alone
If you think you're gonna leave
Then you better say so
Lily, I really really hope you don't

Don't make me wake up without you
Don't make me wake up without you
Don't make me wake up without you
Don't make me wake up without you (without you)

Dripped in gold, in your arms you hold
Me so carelessly
It's so wrong

They get too close
You will rip them open
Then you'll turn to me and just smile

Lily, I love you
Lily, I love you
Lily, I love you, but I just don't see
Maybe it's you
Maybe it's me
Trying to be everything I think you need
And maybe you love me
Maybe you don't
Maybe I'm scared of waking up alone
If you think you're gonna leave
Then you better say so
Lily, I really really hope you don't

Don't make me wake up without you
Don't make me wake up without you
Don't make me wake up without you
Don't make me wake up without you (without you)

Animal when you toss and turn
Tucked between tall trees at night
When you dream, isn't me you see
In your eyelids clenched so tight

I don't wanna wake up
I don't wanna wake up
I don't wanna wake up
I don't wanna wake up (wake up)

Lily, I love you
Lily, I love you
Lily, I love you, but I just don't see
Maybe it's you
Maybe it's me
Trying to be everything I think you need
And maybe you love me
Maybe you don't
Maybe I'm scared of waking up alone
If you think you're gonna leave
Then you better say so
Lily, I really really hope you don't

Don't make me wake up without you
Don't make me wake up without you
Don't make me wake up without you
Don't make me wake up without you 
Don't make me wake up without you (I don't wanna wake up)
Don't make me wake up without you (I don't wanna wake up)
Don't make me wake up without you (I don't wanna wake up)
Don't make me wake up without you (I don't wanna wake up)
Don't make me wake up without you (I don't wanna wake up)
Don't make me wake up without you (I don't wanna wake up)
Don't make me wake up without you (I don't wanna wake up)
Don't make me wake up without you (I don't wanna wake up)
