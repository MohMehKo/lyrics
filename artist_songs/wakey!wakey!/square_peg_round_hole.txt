Take me with you when you go
I don't want to stay here alone
Remember when we were golden
Well that was a long time ago
You told me that you felt foolish
You stayed where you didn't belong
I don't wanna be foolish
Square peg in a round hole
Square peg in a round hole

You said that it was still stolen
But it just didn't beat anymore
I guess that when it's done falling
It's just lying dead on the floor
Said if you wanna be foolish
Then you can go do it alone
Cause I don't wanna be foolish
Square peg in a round hole
Square peg in a round hole

Square peg in a round hole
Square peg in a round hole
Square peg in a round hole

Square peg in a round hole
Square peg in a round hole
Square peg in a round hole

Square peg in a round hole

Square peg in a round hole
Square peg in a round hole
Square peg in a round hole
