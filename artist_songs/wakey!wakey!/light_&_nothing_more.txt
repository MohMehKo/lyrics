After a year of make it Sundays by your side
So change your mind for dusty diamonds to make them mine

There's nothing more important to me than you
If you need I will be your light and nothing more
There's nothing more important to me than you
You should know you will be my light forever more

I'm tryin' to grow strong, trying to move on, I'm fighting to
Only ever do my deals with angels like an angel do

There's nothing more important to me than you
If you need I will be your light and nothing more
There's nothing more important to me than you
You should know you will be my light forever more

There's nothing more important to me than you
If you need I will be your light and nothing more
There's nothing more important to me than you
You should know you will be my light forever more

Forever more
You'll be my light
Ever more
Forever more
Ever more
La-lala-la
Oh, be my light
Ever more
