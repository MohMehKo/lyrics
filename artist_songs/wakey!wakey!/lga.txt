Laguardia made you late and I got tired of waiting
Cause this does not feel like a holiday
Even with the fresh bread baking downstairs
I hope you get home soon

Cause said love was just like youth
That it was time worth wasting
We said young love felt like a holiday
It felt like fresh bead baking downstairs
I hope you get home soon

It's enough if you're saying that it's love
I'm gonna wait, gonna wait
Gonna make it home

Laguardia made you late
