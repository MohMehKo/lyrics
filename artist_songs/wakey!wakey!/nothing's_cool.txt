I used to live being alone
Staying out late and wasted Sundays
Me and my friends wouldn't go home
Til they raised the lights and the bars all closed

But nothing's cool
Without you
Noting's cool
When I'm missing you

I used to thing going downtown
Losing my mind and wasting my money
That was enough, me and my friends
Wherever we'd go we'd want for nothing

Lately it's been coming down
Been coming down on me
