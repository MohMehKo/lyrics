Fell asleep with my clothes on last night
I woke up and I've got you on my mind 
Sun burning trough the window
I cover up my eyes, I cover up my eyes

We're done with the he said she said
We're done with the running from 
I'm gonna change my ways, get back on track
And clear my head, gonna get you back

And every little thing gonna be okay
Everything gonna be just fine
Every little thing gonna be okay 
We're gonna make it through the night
Every little thing gonna be okay
Everything gonna be just fine
Every little thing gonna be okay
We're gonna make it through the night

All I got is the change in my pocket
All I got is I've got to get this right
I'm making my mind up 
I've opened up my eyes, I've opened up my eyes
