Four o'clock in the morning and I'm at your apartment
There's a four alarm fire like I've never seen
But I don't want to fight once we've got the alarm set
Cause there's too much going on these days
There's too much going on these days

Said, I'm a made man, I'm a made man, baby
And it looks so good like you've never seen
But you can see through it like a fake tan baby
you can see right through it like you saw through me
But there's too much going on these days
There's too much going on...

And I don't want to let you down, I don't want to let you down
Just when fire could take this town

And I don't want to let you down, I don't want to let you down
Just when fire could take this town

And the bed feels good and the pillow on my face
And we sweat a little, maybe had too much to drink
But it's all worth it that's what I think
Cause there's too much going on these days
There's too much going on...

And I don't want to let you down, I don't want to let you down
Just when fire could take this town

And I don't want to let you down, I don't want to let you down
Just when fire could take this town
