You are the only person in this room
And I can't take my eyes off you
I bet you can't guess what I would do
To kiss you in the middle of the room
And all this love between us grows
But we're sitting on our hands and we're turning up our nose
I bet you can't guess what I would do
To kiss you in the middle of the room
I bet you can't guess what I would do
To kiss you in the middle of the room

Cause I don't blame you anymore
I don't blame you
Cause I don't blame you anymore
I don't blame you

All my sex, and all my sins
I still can't gather where you went
I guess that you loved the things I did
Much more than the things I'm doin
So you've got sense, and I've got Shit
And I'm just trying to swallow it
But I tell you right now if I see you again
I'm gonna kiss you in the middle of the room
I tell you right now if I see you again
I'm gonna kiss you in the middle of the room

Cause I don't blame you anymore
I don't blame you
Cause I don't blame you anymore
I don't blame you

So I turn out the lights
And I cover my eyes
Cause you know I can't sleep til it's light outside
And It's not so often that I think of you,
But it kills me when I do
I hope that you don't stay gone long
And I hope you haven't changed when you get back home
And I hope you know
That when you do I'm gonna kiss you in the middle of the room
I hope you know
That when you do I'm gonna kiss you in the middle of the room

Cause I don't blame you anymore
I don't blame you
Cause I don't blame you anymore
I don't blame you
