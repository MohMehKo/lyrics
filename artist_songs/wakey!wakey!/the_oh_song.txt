Maybe, I'm just lonely.
Here with my pillow and my silent movies
Maybe I lost, yeah I lost my mind
Wake up tomorrow and we'll be just fine
But I know...

Maybe you already know
Smoking out your window sipping your diet coke
Maybe you don't cause you seem just fine
and that's why I keep leaving in the middle of the night

Cause I know
That it's only just a matter of time
Before these walls start crumbling, crumbling
and it's only just a matter of time
Before these walls start tumbling, tumbling

Cause I know
That it's only just a matter of time
Before these walls start crumbling, crumbling
and it's only just a matter of time
Before these walls start tumbling, tumbling

It's only just a matter of time
Before these walls start crumbling, crumbling
and it's only just a matter of time
Before these walls come tumbling, tumbling
