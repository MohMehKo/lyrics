I'm done, I think I've had enough
Was fun letting you mess me up 

If I was a fire and you were the sun
If you were still trying
Cause I'm trying 
If I was a liar and you weren't one
If you were still trying 
I'm still trying 

Maybe you should wonder what it is you waste
When you waste away
Maybe you should think about the hearts you break
When you waste away

Yeah, you know that you need me 
You know what you mean to me 

I know that I won't get through 
And I Won't keep being lost in you
