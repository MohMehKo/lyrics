Cut it out, said you have got to cut it out
You are not welcome here and honestly
I'd much rather do without you and your cocaine attitude
I've got to cut you out
I cannot deal with you here
And I have got to put you down

And I hope you know it's a miracle, a miracle
I hope you know it's a miracle life
And I hope you know it's a miracle, a miracle
I hope you know it's a miracle life

So you should take it like a man
And stand silent through it all
You should take it like a man
Stand silent, stand tall
Cause if you'd take it like a man
I would be on your side
I would be on your side
Be on your side
I would be on your side
Be on your side
I would be on your

I let you in like a bullet to my brain
I let you stay
I should have sent you off and on your way
I'm sorry now if you don't understand my pain
But baby, please don't make me tell you again

And I hope you know it's a miracle, a miracle
I hope you know it's a miracle life
And I hope you know this is a miracle, a miracle
I hope you know this is a miracle life

So you should take it like a man
And stand silent through it all
You should take it like a man
Stand silent, stand tall
Cause if you'd take it like a man
And if you'd take it like a man
And if you
And if you
I would be on your side
I would be on your side

I would be on your side
I would be on your side
Be on your side
I would be on your side
Be on your side
I would be on your
