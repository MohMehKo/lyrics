I'm fine, got peace of mind
In these friends of mine
But everywhere I go, they ask about you
Just thought that you should know

That's the danger of a big town love in a small town

My mom reminded me of a thing you said to her
Last time that we came over
Something about life out on your own

That's the problem with a big town love in a small town
That's the danger of a big town love in a small town

Life is a circle and it all comes back around
This time don't look for me
I try not to be so loud

And I'm fine, got peace of mind
In these friends of mine
But everywhere I go, I think about you
Just thought that you should know

That's the danger of a big town love in a small town
That's the problem with a big town love in a small town
That's the danger of a big town love in a small town
That's the danger of a big town love
