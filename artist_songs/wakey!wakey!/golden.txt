What are you looking down for
Staring at the ground for
Had to take the long way home
Always on the sidelines
Always having hard times
Everywhere you go

But if we believe
In all the things they said
When we were young
I'd be a broken man
Full of broken dreams
With a broken heart

It's gonna be alright
You'll gonna be golden
You'll gonna be fall in love
Before you know it, kid
It's gonna be alright
You'll gonna be golden
You'll gonna be fall in love

Kid, when I was your size
Yeah, I had a hard time
Had to take the long way home
Looking over my shoulder
Wishing I was older
Never knew which way to go

But if we believe
In all the things they said
When we were young
I'd be a broken man
Full of broken dreams
With a broken heart

It's gonna be alright
You'll gonna be golden
You'll gonna be fall in love
Before you know it, kid
It's gonna be alright
You'll gonna be golden
You'll gonna be fall in love

It's all gonna open up
And you know it, you know it
It's gonna be alright
You'll gonna be golden
You'll gonna be fall in love

And when the sun starts coming out
Yeah when the sun starts coming out
It's gonna be your time
It's gonna be alright
So hold on

And see the sun
See the sun
See the sun
See the sun start coming out
See the sun
See the sun
See the sun
See the sun start coming out
And see the sun
See the sun
See the sun
And see the sun start coming out
See the sun
See the sun
See the sun
And see the sun start coming out

It's gonna be alright
You'll gonna be golden
You'll gonna be fall in love
Before you know it, kid
It's gonna be alright
You'll gonna be golden
You'll gonna be fall in love

It's all gonna open up
And you know it, you know it

It's gonna be alright
You'll gonna be golden
You'll gonna be fall in love

And see the sun
See the sun

And see the sun start coming out
See the sun

And see the sun start coming out
