What was that about the ballroom dancing class I asked about 
It's all I thought about cuz you were saying
We might get a chance to talk and talk might lead to dancing
maybe dance might lead to dates dates to aging

Hope you let your intuition 
precede my reputation 
cause i have one

Well I am what you see
I am not what they say
but if I turned out to be
could you love me anyway
I'm stading in anonymous 
hoping your heart
will just wake up and ask for me by name
Maybe someday you will ask for me by name
just not today

Well if this is love then it's hard to say
but the notes in your books and your reaching away
and I've Confidence issues with your intentions
And I'm not hip to all of your tricks 
but your algebra your politics 
and the band has planned a hotel intervention

So don't you leave me by my lonesome 
to exceed my reputation 
cause i have one

Well I am what you see
I am not what they say
but if I turned out to be 
could you love me anyway
Stading anonymous 
hoping your heart 
will just wake up to ask for me by name
Maybe someday you will ask for me by name
just not today

I'm always here
I've walked you home 
and headed for my own 
until again i'm needed

Well I am what you see
I am not what they say
but if I turned out to be 
could you love me anyways

I am what you see
I am not what they say
but if I turned out to be 
could you love me anyway
Stading anonymous
hoping your heart
we'll just wake up and ask for me by name
Maybe someday you will ask for me by name
just not today

Not today
