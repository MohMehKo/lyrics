Everytime I think of you
I always catch my breath
I'm still standing here
And your miles away
And I wonder why you left me
And there's a storm that's raging through my frozen heart tonight

I hear your name in certain circles
And it always makes me smile
I spend my time just thinking about you
And it's almost driving me wild

[Bridge:]
But it's my heart that's begging down this long distance line tonight

[Chorus:]
And I ain't missin' you at all
Since you've been gone... Away
I ain't missin' you
No matter what I might say

There's a message in the wires
And I am sendin' you a signal tonight
You don't know how desperate I've become
And It looks like I'm losing this fight

[Bridge:]
But it's my heart that's breakin' down this long dusty road of mine

[Chorus:]
But I ain't missin' you at all
Since you've been gone... Away
I ain't missin' you
No matter what my friends say

And there's a message that I'm sendin' out
Like a telegraph to your soul
I can't bridge this distance
Honey, stop this heartache, overload

[Chorus:]
I ain't missin' you at all
Since you've been gone... Away
I ain't missin' you
No matter what my friends say
I ain't missin' you
Since you've been gone... Away
I ain't missing you
Yeah, no matter what your friends say

Hey yeah, yeah yeah yeah

I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone... Away
I ain't missin' you
No
