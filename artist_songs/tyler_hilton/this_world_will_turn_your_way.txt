Sometimes you crawl
Sometimes you don't even move at all
Sometimes you pray
Sometimes you don't have the words to say

Drop your baggage on my front door
You don't have to carry it alone anymore

'Cause tonight ain't the end of the story
Just keep turning the page
Don't give into the heartache
Don't give into the pain

This world will turn your way
Baby one of these days
This world will turn your way

Sometimes we fall
Sometimes we don't feel the crash at all
Sometimes we break
Sometimes we've taken all that we can take

Lay your burden down by my side
You know tomorrow that sun's gonna rise

But tonight ain't the end of the story
Just keep turning the page
Don't give into the heartache
Don't give into the pain

This world will turn your way
Baby one of these days
This world will turn your way

(Keep feeling it, keep feeling it
Don't give in, don't give into it)
