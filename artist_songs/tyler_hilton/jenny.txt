She looks away and says that she's gonna leave
It sounds so casual like she's practiced it before
We must have lost ourselves in the in-betweens
It's hard to keep it fair when love turns into war
But it's what we're fighting for
Don't say it's over

Jenny turn around
Don't you leave what we've got now
Give up everything we could be
Love is not some fucking movie
Jenny turn around 
Don't say it's over now

There's nothing like the high that I get with you
To crash and come back down is the only guarantee
I try so hard to be the best for you
Sometimes I feel like the only thing you see
Is just the worst in me
Don't say it's over

Jenny turn around
Don't you leave what we've got now
Give up everything we could be
Love is not some fucking movie
Jenny turn around

We're not kissing in the rain
There's not music when we fight
I want to catch you at the gate right before you board your flight
When you know each others scars
And the tears you cry are real
When you stay when it gets hard cause it's more than how you feel
Oh Jenny
Oh Jenny
Oh Jenny
Yeah

Please just turn around
Don't you leave what we've got now
Give everything we could be
Love is not some fucking movie
Jenny turn around 
Don't say it's over now
Yeah
Don't say it's over now
