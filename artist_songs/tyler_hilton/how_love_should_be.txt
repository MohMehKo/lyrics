Mobile woman, buckle down your boots
If you leave me, what else can I do?
Well I've been a dancer, I’ve been a dancer all my life
But I'm not dancing ‘round this one tonight
And I know I'd be doing fine

Without you believin’ in always picking up and thinking about leaving
Once you stick around then that's when I'll show you happiness the world can see
That's how love should be

I'm not asking, I'm not on my knees
But I'm not quite the knight I used to be
And I know I'd be better off

Without you believin’ in always picking up and thinking about leaving
Once you stick around then that's when I'll show you happiness the world can see
That's how love should be

I know I'm ready for what's the hard part
I'm being honest baby if you’re right at home I'm moving on

Without you believin’ in always picking up and thinking about leaving
Once you stick around then that's when I'll show you happiness the world can see
That's how love should be

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Once you stick around then that's when I'll show you happiness the world can see
That's how love should be
