It's hard to say the time and place that I knew
It got hard to think of anything else but me and you
Yeah some may take for granted oh but I could not imagine
How the world still spins when the door opens and you walk into the room
When you’re near, there’s a sound, there’s a sense I can feel
Something I can’t explain but its real, yeah its real

From the time I’m waking
Through the days I’m facing 
Till the sleep I’m faking
I belong with you
Till the stars start falling 
Till the wind stops calling 
Till they lose their moment
I belong, I belong with you

From the bells that ring when we can never knew
To the park and lovers our eyes lock and the stories all comes true
I’m aware yeah sparks fly by through the air
And the night lights up everywhere cause you’re there

From the time I’m waking
Through the days I’m facing
Till the sleep I’m faking
I belong with you.
Till the stars start falling
Till the wind stops calling
Till they lose their moment
I belong, I belong with you
I belong with you

Everything I do just reminds me again like a picture of you painted under my skin
If love is a mystery then my only clue is some belong together like I do to you

From the time I’m waking
Through the days I’m facing 
Till the sleep I’m faking
I belong with you
Till the stars start falling 
Till the wind stops calling 
Till they lose their moment
I belong, I belong with you

I belong with you
Oh, I belong, I belong with you.
