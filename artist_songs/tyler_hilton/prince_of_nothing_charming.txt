Here comes the part where you say, I don’t understand you, yeah 
And all those little things I never get right 
You talk and talk but all that chit chat stuck in lipstick and it’s driving me crazy, baby 
And I got nothing when you smile like Mona Lisa ‘cause I need ya, I need ya tonight 
And if walls could talk I’d be the prince of nothing charming and it’s driving you crazy, baby 

Oh you love like you wanted to fight like you needed tonight 
Baby it’s beautiful 
Oh and you scream like a gun in the night 
Yeah you’re starting a fight 
It’s like you don’t know 
Baby, you’re beautiful, baby, you’re beautiful 

It’s ten to midnight and this cheap champagne is wearing off, she’s tearing off her dress
God I’m such a mess
And in the dark she’s taking shots at my heart 
She’s got it to an art and this how I fall apart 

Oh you love like you wanted to fight like you needed tonight 
Baby it’s beautiful 
Oh and you scream like a gun in the night 
Yeah you’re starting a fight 
It’s like you don’t know 
Baby, you’re beautiful

Girl you got soul and I don’t mind that you go a little crazy 
It’s that passion I dig baby, yeah 
The world wants your glow but you’re the last one to know 
Baby you’re beautiful 

Here comes the part but only you can understand me 
Like cigarettes and candy 
Baby, baby 

Oh you love like you wanted to fight like you needed tonight 
Baby it’s beautiful 
Oh and you scream like a gun in the night 
Yeah you’re starting a fight 
It’s like you don’t know 
Baby, you’re beautiful, baby you’re beautiful

You’re beautiful 

It’s ten to midnight and this cheap champagne is wearing off
It’s time that I confess, god I’m such a mess
