Why you keep me around?
When you can have anyone in this town
Am I the best you hope for
Just the best that you found
And there’s no way to explain it
But either way you know I’ll take it.

Through the haze of the whisky lights
And the haze of the angels dressed in cocaine white
I’m not trying to make you change
But love, I know what I like
First you play along, even though it's wrong
But then it starts feeling right.

And now, more I drink
The less I feel sorrow
More I make
The less that I borrow
More I love ya
The less that I feel alone
Stoned, kicking my heels alone,
Stoned, kicking my heels alone.

Every person and place that I’ve been
I keep seeing the same thing all over again
See even God needs the devil
And I’m one hell of a friend
If it makes you feel much better
At least we’re going down together

More I drink
The less I feel sorrow
More I make
The less that I borrow
More I love ya
The less that I feel alone
Stoned, kicking my heels alone
Stoned, kicking my heels alone

Yeah-yeah-hey
Yeah-yeah-hey
Yeah-yeah-hey

Don’t wanna worry the rest of my life
Just wanna stay here and have a good time
(Come on now)
Don’t wanna worry the rest of my life
(Oh no I don't, no I don't wanna worry)
Wanna stay here just have a good time
(Just wanna stay here)

More I drink,
The less I feel sorrow,
More I make,
The less that I borrow
More I love ya
The less that I feel alone.
Stoned, kicking my heels alone,
Stoned, kicking my heels

The more I drink,
The less I feel sorrow,
More I make,
The less that I borrow
More I love ya,
The less that I feel alone
Stoned, kicking my heels alone,
Stoned, kicking my heels alone,
Stoned, kicking my heels alone.
Stoned, kicking my heels alone,

(Don't wanna worry the rest of my life)
(Just wanna stay here and have a good time)
Come on now
