Don't forget all your clothes,
They'll be in my way after you go.
And I'm not mad; I don't mind,
But if you really want to go,
Leave nothing behind.

I don't know why
You're acting this way.
Covered in tears,
Blush on your face.
You tell me you're mad,
You stomp on my floor.
Fuss with your bags, baby,
Say we know love no more.

But what did you say,
You feel bad,
But there's someone else you found.
Well since it's you who wants to leave me, baby,
And not the other way around…

Don't forget all your clothes,
They'll be in my way after you go.
And I'm not mad; I don't mind,
But if you really want to go,
Leave nothing behind.

Now, tell me again,
‘Cause I can't recall,
What I have said,
Or done that's so wrong.
I promise you love,
I'll give you everything you need;
And look what I've done for ya,
And what you're doing to me.

So don't you give me those eyes,
That say honey you should know,
That I was wrong from the start baby,
Well, it's better that you go.

Don't forget all your clothes,
They'll be in my way after you go.
And I'm not mad; I don't mind,
But if you really want to go,
Leave nothing behind.
Who is this man that'll take you anyhow,
Don't he know you're gonna leave him like you left somebody else
Not too far from now?

Don't forget all your clothes,
They'll be in my way after you go.
And I'm not mad; I don't mind,
But if you really want to go,
Leave nothing behind.
