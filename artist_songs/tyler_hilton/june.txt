June, what you gonna do without me?
Soon, you're gonna have to move around me,
It's never what you wanted but it's been a while coming,
Oh June, what you gonna do?

Throw your stones, if you need to take it out on me,
Don't you know, that's the way it's always gotta be,
There's no room, in the end your little fantasy,
Won't come true, that's so you,
June

June, I love the hats you wear to meet me,
But soon, you're gonna have to chose between me
And everything you wanted, girl you knew you had it coming,
Oh June, I said what you gonna do?

Throw your stones, if you need to take it out on me,
Don't you know, that's the way it's always gotta be,
There's no room, in the end your little fantasy,
Won't come true, that's so you,

She screams and she cries and nobody cares,
She's never alone, she needs everyone there,
But she's not gonna get a reaction from me 'cause I let go,
And it's so hard to go,

Throw your stones, if you need to take it out on me,
Don't you know, that's the way it's always gotta be,
There's no room, in the end your little fantasy,
Won't come true, that's so you,
June
June
