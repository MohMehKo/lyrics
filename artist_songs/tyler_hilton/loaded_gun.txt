Yeah
You ready?
I’m ready
One, two, three, four
Wheels running fast down the one-eighteen
Every kiss is sweeter with some nicotine
The little white lightning underneath my seat, oh yeah

The sun’s going down like a sinking stone
A dog’s barking in the distance imma throw him a bone
You got that look on your face, like something’s gunna go wrong, oh yeah yeah

The way you looking so good in the cotton dress,
There’s just no telling what I’ll do next
But one thing’s for sure and it’ll sure be fun
Stay away from my trigger, imma loaded gun
Stay away from my trigger, imma loaded gun

Imma moving target, baby
No one’s gotten through me yet (huh)
But it’s, a, worth a shot, It’ll be something that you won’t forget
I got ‘em lined up and crying from Georgia to Tex
But to learn to swim, you gotta wanna get wet
There’s no turning back cuz I’m ready to run
Stay away from my trigger, imma loaded gun
Stay away from my trigger, imma loaded gun (ha)
Watch out now
Oh, yeah
Alright, break it down
Yeah, just keep it down
Alright
Load me
Squeeze me
Cock me
Shoot me
Yeah, load me
Squeeze me
Cock me
Ahhh, shoot me, shoot me sugar
Imma moving target, baby
No one’s gotten through me yet
But it’s worth a shot, it’ll be something that you won’t forget
I’m gunna be your next tattoo
After all the things imma do to you
I don’t have to run the bases cuz I hit home runs
Stay away from my trigger, imma loaded gun
Stay away from my trigger, imma loaded gun
Give it comes down five, four, three, two, one
Stay away from my trigger, imma loaded gun
