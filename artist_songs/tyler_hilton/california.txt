Man on the corner said son won't you choose,
The life that your living or these pair of travelling shoes,
Well there's a place called California,
And the road there is free,
So it's off to California for me.

The bus is always stopping,
And the train moves too slow,
So I'm hitchhiking my way to the California coast,
And I'm leaving my woman,
Hell, I'm leaving all three,
But there's more in California for me.

Well I got a passion for a place I never saw
With its wide open spaces,
But no space to have a law,
Well the first thing that I'm a doing,
Is I'm a cutting down a tree,
To make some space in California for me.

So boys can't you hear me,
I'm a new kid in [?],
Show a fella around the town,
To get accustomed to the air,
Well I've got jokes just for gentlemen
As long as drinks are free,
In the first night in California for me.

Well I'll be damned if there's no empty land left if I pay,
More than what I ever have if I spent all I save,
Well I won't be searching for California more,
A place like California,
Ain't got no room for the poor,
But a judging man I've never been,
And never will I be,
A man of California,
So long to California,
No more California for me
