Everybody knows, or has a story bout the first one
Who taught them how to hurt, and led their hopes astray
When its gone on quite enough and your sick of staying down
I know what you need, but you gotta live it like it sounds

[Chorus:]
When you lose what you love, live on live on
When the road gets too rough, be strong, be strong
What you can't understand, but you're starting to see
it'll work in the end, you just got to believe
And keep on, keep on
Keep on keep on

I had my ideals, my plans so cut and dry
I wouldn't settle for a thing
And you can forget all compromise

But I was tackled like a wave, stormed on like the ground
What once would never change, was slowly turning 'round

[Chorus]

You can take it from me, there's so much you can be
And it's all gonna change, whether it's you or them or me

[Chorus]
