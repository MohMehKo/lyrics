Heard that you were back in town
It’s been a while baby since I’ve seen you around
And on your own
He charmed you off to who knows where
Got some colour and changed your hair
But the look in those eyes says you’re still alone
So before you tell me what you always tell me
That you’re doing fine and everything’s alright

Baby leave him, leave him, cause you don’t need him
And I’ll be on your side
Go on and leave him, leave him, your heart don’t believe him
For me, please try
To leave him and love me this time

Heard you got to catch a flight
You ain't talk to anybody else here tonight
Sure you gotta go
We both know what they say is true
He runs around. He ain't good to you
And it's so hard to watch how he breaks your heart and you know I won’t
So before you run to, you always run to
Baby what you’re looking for is right in front of you

So baby leave him, leave him
Cause you don’t need him
And I’ll be on your side
Go on and leave him, leave him
Your heart don’t believe him
For me, please try
To leave him and love me this time

And I know it wasn’t right
When I let you down and let you go that night
Oh, I’m not giving up on us this time

I said leave him, leave him
You’re loving me, you don’t need him
I’ll be on your side
Go on and leave him, leave him
Your heart don’t believe him
For me, please try to leave him and love me
Just leave him and love me this time
Oh, this time
