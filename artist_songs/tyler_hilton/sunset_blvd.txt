I come from the desert
Where sun's the only hazard
And I spent my days a-wondering why
Nothing seems to matter

So the boy went to the city
Of the smarter and the faster
Where you can date opportunity 
but it takes cash to undress her

I met a girl who's a lot like me
She double knots her shoes and wants to live by the sea
She don't talk much and that's ok by me
I still write a lot of songs about her

Baby walk with me on Sunset Blvd
We'll watch this devil city fall apart
We were lost here from the start
But that's just who we are on Sunset Blvd.

So I'm a hopeful songwriter
And she's a model slash actress
Writing our vows down on cheap diner napkins
And dreamin out loud about these things that will never happen
It would be so sad if we weren't always laughin
I've got my name in a vending machine
You can get your own hell there almost free
Or you can stay unknown and that's ok by me
As long as I can sing about you

Baby walk with me on Sunset Blvd
We'll watch this devil city fall apart
From the top of this town
We can see the dreams come crashing down
Fall in love with me on Sunset Blvd.
We'll catch the late parade of broken hearts
We were lost here from the start
That's just who we are on Sunset Blvd.

Don't let it get you down
There's hope that's all around
Come on you're almost there
They come from everywhere
Just to make it here

So walk with me on Sunset Blvd.
We'll watch this devil city fall apart
From the top of this town
We can see the dreams come crashing down
Fall in love with me on Sunset Blvd.
We'll catch the late parade of broken hearts
We were lost here from the start
That's just who we are on Sunset Blvd.
