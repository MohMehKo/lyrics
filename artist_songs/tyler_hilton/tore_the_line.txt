Maybe you know nothin'
But I sure as hell know somethin' 'bout a mother's son
Oh and starin' at the face
I'm tracin' lines across the same space as the older one's

Now I look out my window
Petrified by everything I've done
So when I look at you baby
Tell me you know just where I'm comin' from
A thousand years of searchin' for the one

Hey, yeah, tonight we sorta kinda tore the lines up
Tore the lines, tore the lines
And hey baby, of course the course of horsin' tore the lines up
Tore the lines, tore the lines, tore the lines

Well, now I'm a fan of photographs
And all those dated members hangin' in my tree
Oh, if you read grangpa's letters
Put together, sugar, you'd know why you hang with me

But I look out my window
Petrified by everythin' I see, yeah
And when I look at you baby
Somethin' seems to whisper home to me
A thousand years so what's a thousand three?

Hey, yeah, tonight we sorta kinda tore the lines up
Tore the lines, tore the lines
And hey sugar, of course the course of horsin' tore the lines up, yeah
Tore the lines, tore the lines, tore the lines

Everyone that loves each other
Loves their brother right
And when the time comes to tear that line up
That's when I'll show you, that's when love's alive, yeah

And hey, yeah, tonight we sorta kinda tore the lines up
Tore the lines, tore the lines
And hey baby, of course the course of horsin' tore the lines up, yeah
Tore the lines, tore the lines, tore the lines up
Tore the lines, tore the lines, tore the lines up
Tore the lines up, hey
