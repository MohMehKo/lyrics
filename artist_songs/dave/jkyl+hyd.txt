This is a tale of two men, this is Jekyll and Hyde
Have you ever had a war with your mind? Its like I'm two men
Tryna' juggle college and money but this is useless
Cause either way one of them suffers because of music
Telling Jussy on the phone, bailiffs climbing windows
Tryna' run up in my home and take everything I own
Them girls will never know, The choices that I made
All the nights that I pray got aired to the road that I chose
Bruv, I'm local to home, making phones calls for dough
I implode or I blow?
But you couldn't buy my attention, its either there or no
You ever spoken to the devil? You'll lose the fear in God
He doesn't come round here, it's crazy right?
How a-judge can give a life and take a life
I nearly died that night, it's crazy right?
That's why you don't get involved when they play with knifes

Nah, but let me tell you about my life, I came from a family of 5
If I try to tell my story 'swear down you would cry
But all you need to know is I've lost every single man inside my life
And so I lost my way
It's like who do you follow when your time feels borrowed
And your idols gonna' stray? My words carry weight
It's like who do you follow when your time feels borrowed
And your idols gonna' stray? And so I put my heart in my friends
Started writing bars, I was trying to be the hardest on endz'
And then we split half of the endz'
A few altercations in a week, we lost half of our friends
We was selling draws, and then-a little more
And back then all the girls in the school were busy giving corn
I never had a fresh trim, I had braces
This is for the brudda's in life that weren't rated

Started thinking way beyond my age when I hit 17
I had a smile of a child but a mind like I'm 23
I mean 35, I lived a dirty life
Around a bunch of man I didn't feel like sherleys [?] guy
And now these clowns couldn't sit with me
Literally, I stand on my own like Sicily
I've never been known for wifing hoes and twitter beef
I'm tryna' turn green and white to red like Italy

I don't need to chat shit my family is active
Madness, I've seen death like sign language
And lifes so precious, I don't want wanna die so young
Real talk I don't like this pressure
Man are still beefing over endz
We don't own this land and we don't like this weather
Man are still beefing over money and you're all broke
Outside your endz there's a life that better
Outside your endz there's a life that real
With a job and a wife that's real
3 baby mums and a whip, that's fake
Leaving your kids that's fake, man you kids so lame
I shouldn't need to say what's real
This is common sense for the man who got their head set straight
I have to state the obvious, youth's move proper [?] sick [?]
Trust me these bars are for them mans sake
So listen, now its like Dave man you have to blow
Cause I've seen pain like Nagato
Yeah you know my picture, you ain't never spent a day inside my camera roll
Thinking about my image, younger donnies' listen
And this message that I'm giving is so easily miss written
I wanna say, leave the beef alone and chase the figures
Man, I wanna say, leave the beef alone and chase the figues
But it's never been that simple
When you get em hold the dippers
I'm leading by example, all them little nigga's on that trap wave
Jump of it's not gonna run
I don't care about how many doors you got on your car
No one cares about how much corn you got on your gun
Man they wanna hear your story, this trap thing bores me
And word to Jamal my time soon comes shortly

If your my right hand then my beef is your beef
My vid' is your vid'- the scene can't ignore me
Cause when I turnt 14, I wasn't cutting cake in a party
For my B-day, I was online hitting sales like E-Bay
See music is a change, still chasing snitches
Like why you lying to the jakes?
Get nicked, get a deal, then set fire to the rain
Pass is never worth it, trust me man knows
Them youths look raggo, them boy there plateaued
Died in battle, I still wonder why we had burners from young
Like Alexandre Pato
They're beefing with these low lifes, for them cold nights
I'm tryna' make music my whole life
I can't do it on my own fam I won't lie
So if you're on your own grind and you don't know a bag of man
You can be my Santan Danielle or my Halli Tam
If you're on your own grind and you don't know a bag of man
You can be my Santan D-
