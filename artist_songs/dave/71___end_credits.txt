[71]

Look
Why them man talking 'bout trap
And work they never have done
My side don't know about pressure
And my brothers they never could run
Man talk about shottys and.40s
But them boys ain't ever seen guns
I'm tryna retire at 40
I ain't working till 71
I ain't working till 71
I ain't working till 71
I'm tryna retire at 40
I ain't working till 71
I ain't working till 71
I ain't working till 71
I'm tryna retire at 40
I ain't working till 71

16, I saw my first grand
And then I went Prada and I lost it
It's like I cremated Moses
Cause man was just burning profit
Then I spend one five in a heartbeat
I didn't know about taking losses
That's cause I had lines with squares
And Os in the middle like noughts and crosses
No that's cause I had 3 young g's
With their hand on their heart
And their mind on cake
The guy to my side had a wap on his thigh
So I had 40 to my right like Drake
Them man there still banging for pride
Done with that, mans tryna get paid
That's for my g, had cats on my line
Like Harvey Dent, I can't feel my face like

Why them man talking 'bout trap
And work they never have done
My side don't know about pressure
And my brothers they never could run
Man talk about shottys and.40s
But them boys ain't ever seen guns
I'm tryna retire at 40
I ain't working till 71
I ain't working till 71
I ain't working till 71
I'm tryna retire at 40
I ain't working till 71
I ain't working till 71
I ain't working till 71
I'm tryna retire at 40
I ain't working till 71

Dash, duck, dive, run, hide, snitch
Man try bump me for a bag
But I got around South like London Bridge
I was 16 with a mic and a dream
2 years later I'm taking the piss
Man still hate on me and my team
Cause I got more ice for my age than Sid
But wait, look, my man said that he's psycho
My man said that they're grinding
It's funny how them man are psychos
But they're Ps are silent
Don't talk to me about moves
Like a day off them man are just lying
Send a young runner out in the field
Put pressure on a yout like a brand new signing

Why them man talking 'bout trap
And work they never have done
My side don't know about pressure
And my brothers they never could run
Man talk about shottys and.40s
But them boys ain't ever seen guns
I'm tryna retire at 40
I ain't working till 71
I ain't working till 71
I ain't working till 71
I'm tryna retire at 40
I ain't working till 71
I ain't working till 71
I ain't working till 71
I'm tryna retire at 40
I ain't working till 71

Take 4
Still September the 12th
Oh it's actually not cause I just clocked we're
Studio 1am so September the 13th
Yeah
Just finished sick ad-lib that I put down
I gotta get this in one take so
Look
Look
It''s looking like we've come to an end
And I don't even know what to say but
I can tell when a person has faith in me
It means way more to me than a favour
It's for Tyrell, Jack, Benny, Nana, Fraser
Jamz, Semtex, Manny
And everyone who put me on their radar
Just know that you did it well
And that my older brothers smiling in his prison cell
And even when he can't call me to say hello
Know that he can hear me talking on the radio
By God's grace soon see me on a screen
I never knew drive until I found me a dream
I never knew work until I found me a team
I swear I've had a headache for my whole damn life
Fam I never knew stress until I found me some peace
I came here with a zipped mouth and open ears
Love to Austin, Man and Maurice
Love to every single person who believed
Love to all my supporters till the end
No fans, you're my friends
There won't ever be a divide between you and I
I love you all to the end
I love you all to the end with the bottom of my heart
I love you all to the end
I love you all to the end
And my mum, I love you so so much
You got so much heart
Single mum with 4 houses and 3 grown sons
Mum you're so so smart
And you love me, cause you let me drop uni
Even though it broke your heart
Mum you know it broke my heart
Cause I know you want the best for us
Protecting what's left of us
Look I just need to say this
My friends you're amazing
You wouldn't even know but
But times that I swear
That I didn't think I'd make it
Walked into depression with a blindfold
And came out of the belly of the beast
I've got friends that will push me in life
And protect me in the streets
I thank God for the company I keep

[Dave (his mother):]
In the studio

Nah, I'm coming back after this take
(You're what?)
I'm coming back after this take
([?])
After this take
([?])
I should just ad-lib you right now
(Huh?)
Forget it. Ad-lib is like when you
You're probably thinking what does that mean?
Ad-libs when you use someone's voice
But I'm recording the final part of it
And you're on loudspeaker cause I'm doing the final take
(Ok, [?])
Soon
(How you gonna get home?)
Jack's picking me up
(Eh?)
Jack's picking me up
(Alright, see you in a bit)
Bye mum
