Six, paths they calling me Madara
Your guys will hide in the mist if my brother's put iron in fist like kazuya
Man call me an amateur
I put numbers in squares like dates on a calendar
Had everyone dressed in black like I came here tryna unlock a new character
Had everyone dressed in black with a bottle in hand like Lei Wulong
I just hit my runner widda bang to the chest cah that boy takes way too long
I was risking my freedom for what 2-2 kicks and a name brand top
And now I think back, was it worth it? All for a chain and a watch

I grew up in estates, feds watching my face
I'm masked up on the move, I need money in the bank like Kane
Look, man took so many different risks on so many different days
When I coulda been dead, I coulda been rich, I coulda been locked in a cage
I grew up in estates, feds watching my face
I'm masked up on the move, I need money in the bank like Kane
Look, man took so many different risks on so many different days
When I coulda been dead, I coulda been rich

Look, man just talk like I never took risks
In the field like I never took risks with squares
When I put the dare in Santan and the Santan in Santander
Wait, look, man get aired
I've done everything that you did
I was 16 with a grand in my jeans and all the same clothes that you wear in your vid
Walk in a party see a barbie looking nice I just give her a smile and a wink
Her boyfriend's holding his hand in a fist like he can't get more than a bang to the ribs
Them man there are just angry and pissed
I took the right path, got cash in legit
Why so bitter, indirects on twitter them man they're just chatting for chicks
No them man there are just chatting for girls, they don't put ammi on scales
Them man there, them man bad in a group they ain't run a man down by themself
Shoo shoo
You was in creams with a milkshake now you gotta run wid ya girl
Jump out the line to two left hooks and a right show a boy how to handle himself
Look
I can handle a jarring girl, I can't stand when she's acting crazy
I got 2 brown tings in grove, I might call down AJ Tracey
They talk my name they just talking man just talk like the talking pays me
And all my Gs look fly and young and that's why the olders hate me
But them man old and broke, no them man old and lazy
No them man still do draws, they shoulda got a night job at Sainsbury's
You put that girl in Chanel, and spent 450 on her kicks
And then I link that girl 2 roads away, I can't show that cattie where I live
No I don't reply, I don't need to
And girls are calling me a prick
But I can tell you from experience, nice guys never win
And I'll have love for my girlfriend
But I've got nothing for a chick, can't trust that girl with a shh nah nah I'm expecting her to snitch
