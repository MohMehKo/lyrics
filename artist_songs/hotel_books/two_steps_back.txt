There is a lesson to learn when someone can crash and burn. 
Are we just waiting for our turn? Is there any concern? 
We force-fed our own minds with something that was never mine. 
We do this every time, we do this every time. 
It takes two to make a relationship survive, 
but it only takes one to make it die. 
That’s why I’m here to sever my ties. 
I'm sick of this sickness, with God as my witness, I'm fine. 

Mocking and hating those with the truth. 
Flocking and rating the knot on this noose. 
Are we acting in the name of edginess 
or deep down is this just an act of prejudice? 

Tightening the ropes of understanding and manhandling the stands rambling with crowds of widows and orphans 
ready to be fed with nourishment of the body. But when we break bread, we feed heads. 
We suffocate minds to ignore life and only see the consequences of death. 
Blind sheep can’t use grass and feed as their shepherd. 
We must not let our heart and mind be severed. 
Cause where is the religion in love and the love in religion? 
We’re taught if we want to go to heaven we must keep them mutually exclusive. 
We’re told tradition is the misleading of staggered preaching, 
the seeking of reaping what was sown by the heavy hearts 
and shackled hands of men that we don’t even love but rather see as utility. 
But the progress we seek is not always rooted in love, 
sometimes just rooted in the need to seem unique 
but still similar to the masses when we get on our hands and knees 
to avoid shaping into a windowless view in the first four pews 
as we spew cyclical phrases at an altar to alter the altered state of refuge 
we never saw when we were clung into what we were taught would teach us how to pray. 
Is everyone like this? No, I doubt it. But I can tell you sometimes I am, and it makes me sick.

I used to be scared that I wasn’t sharing love honestly, 
and now I’m not scared at all. Now I’m not scared at all. 
And that’s what scares me the most. Forgive me, forgive me.
