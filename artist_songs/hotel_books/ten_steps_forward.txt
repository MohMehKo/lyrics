Like a hunter in the woods looking for something
Without a plan you can't get anything
And imperfection drove me to see nothing
And that's why I'm not breathing
And imperfection makes more sense when put in the context of human existence
And I can say I promise truth to this
Even though I know I probably don't

And forever is everything to me
It's been projected through all of my dreams
And I held you tight and said I wanted to love you forever
Even though I know I probably won't

I guess I've been caught
I guess this is all my fault
I guess I've been caught
I gave you all I got

I exist for two reasons and two reasons alone
The first is that God was willing to take a gamble on a soul
And the second was because the ones who made me took too long to let go
Sons today are the reenactment of cheap pornography
And daughters are taught only to love if they can break through a glass ceiling
And these double standards have become a disease
And diseases tend to dictate what we think we can be
So we hunt the weak
The ones that are infected in the feet
So they can't run from the hunters when we don't get what we need
And a good hunter knows to use every part of the animal
Like I did to all my friends in the final hour
When I finally felt alone I realized you can't cry wolf when you're already devoured
And to let the ones who felt empowered feel useless when I drained them of their blood
And I told them it was all in the name of love

I guess I've been caught
I guess this is all my fault
I guess I've been caught
I gave you all I got

I guess I've been caught
I guess that this is all my fault
I guess I've been caught
I gave you all I got

So darling, whisper in my ear
Tell me things are going to change
Tell me I'm not supposed to be this way
Tell me it's my time
Tell me that I've been brave
Whisper in my ear
Tell me not to be afraid
Tell me my fear is okay
I'm okay
I've done this the best way

I guess I've been caught
I guess that this is all my fault
I guess I've been caught
I gave you all I got

I guess I've been caught
I guess that this is all my fault
I guess I've been caught
I gave you all I got
