I've spent my life trying to come to terms
With the selfish fact that I don't love you back
I'll use my life to find peace and hope
And the weathering fall is just a bump in the road

I'll let the telephone ring
I'm too busy cleaning up the block
I'll cling onto sobriety
I'll let my instincts leave
I'm too ready to bust open the lock and unleash my pity
I can't hold on to an excuse that holds so dear to you
I'll swallow my pride and know what it means to lose
Feeding the last bit of emotion
I have left into truth
Is this all I can do?

[Chorus:]
Every winning hand can lose, if you fold in the play-through
Who you used to be is not who you are today
You can scratch out every name
And find out that you are able
To still refuse of what you have to say

Your opportunity for an exit presenting itself in the form of forgiveness
Saying sorry over and over to the one who pulled the trigger
I gave you security
You wanted excitement
Who you used to be is not who you are today
You said your scars took away from your beauty
Those scars added to your character
Further proof of growth
And that's beautiful to me

[Chorus]

Love is not a threat, sometimes it compliment
It just depends where you are and who you're with
Death is not an exit, life's not repetition
Keep your soul clean of your past oppression

I've spent my life trying to come to terms
With the selfish fact that I don't love you back
I'll use my life to find peace and hope
And the weathering fall is just a bump in the road
I've spent my life trying to come to terms
With the selfish fact that I don't love you back
I'll use my life to find peace and hope
And the weathering fall is just a bump in the road
