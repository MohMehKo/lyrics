Cameron Smith,
Hotel Books,
I believe that intelligence is relative but wisdom is universal,
I believe that life is not a performance and no-one gets a rehearsal, 
I accept that nature is our environment and deserves to be well kept,
But nurture is our calling and it is the reason we were ever made to exist,
I believe that answers are scarce and that's what makes them worth it,
Universalism is fraud just like the matchbook we use called religion,
Feeble attempts at running a match on sand paper hoping it lights,
When the flame starts with passion not an understanding of all things in life,
Philosophy was made to dissolve our natural comfort of ignorance,
God existed long before us and that's where we find our solutions,
Heads in the sand shuts out our demons but also shuts our light to see visions,
I believe you were made to be alive and your life is your mission,
Incisions and visions small holes to let truth seek through and dilute the water we let our hearts dive into,
Looking for monetary incentives but lack the repentance to seek love despite our apprehension,
Like a prison sentence, we all fear heaven,
Like the unknown ocean that happens most of our worlds convention,
Our own conviction is resistant because we fear being misrepresented,
Or misinterpreted with no real grounding to base our relations,
We take a vacation from the truths we used to subscribe to called revelations,
A nation of prescriptions and solutions and narcotics found abusive,
Relying on conclusions before asking the right questions,
Skip a section, skip a sequence, and find yourself bleeding,
Forfeited destination to avoid temporary mistreatment,
Our remedies feel like potions and our leaders practice hypnosis to garnish the abortion of passion from our devotion,
Stricken with foreign motives we have lost our footing and are falling into this ocean,
Convincing our children to compromise with depression,
And to practice being an activist,
To poison our opinions of gods presence,
Sometimes I try to look back and figure out what happened,
We were made to be one nation under god,
Not one nation under personal advancements,
And this modern fight for temporary happiness instead of joys, poison and regression,
But in the kingdom of heaven we are free from the suppression [x2]
We were given a choice, 
We were given a voice,
No longer do we have to inject this poison,
Cause in the kingdom of heaven, we are free from the suppression,

We were made to be one nation under god,
Not one nation under religion,
We were made to be one nation under god,
Not one nation under personal advancements.
