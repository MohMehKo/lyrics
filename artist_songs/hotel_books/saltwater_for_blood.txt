I wish I never heard the things you said before you said what you meant
You fell apart with a broken heart, breaking another won't make it mend
If you had to hide your scars to love him, maybe he didn't love you back
Maybe we won't find ourselves if we only look at what we lack
So you made these incisions in your skin
You said you were marking territory for all the times you let those demons dance around in your head

There's danger in the water
And there's water in my lungs
You won't believe the things I've seen
Since I've been above
For all the things I can take
I know we made our mistakes
Cause we are sick and in love

I have this heart in my chest
I wish I could give it rest

You prayed those demons would leave me
Darling it's okay, I can haunt my own dreams
The drink goes down the same whether it's to find our pleasure or mask our pain
We tried to stop making sense of our broken past
You wanted to make sense of a hopeful future
So we can find peace within our needs
Before our hearts bleed out to this broken culture

There's danger in the water
And there's water in my lungs
You won't believe the things I've seen
Since I've been above
For all the things I can take
I know we made our mistakes
Cause we are sick and in love

I have this heart in my chest
I wish I could give it rest
I wish I could love you less
I wish I could love you less
I have this heart in my chest
I have this heart in my chest

I'm sure this blood is still coarsing
I feel I missed my mark
And I let those thoughts creep inside until I fall apart
We'll wash these weapons in the ocean
Cleanse our bodies in this blood
I hope we find broken devotion
I hope we fall in love
I hope we fall in love
We're sick and in love
