They say it's hard to fall in love,
Maybe they never learned how to patiently wait.
They say it's always dark before the dawn
But you said goodbye before the dawn could break.

So who's really right in the end?
When you tore down the walls
But I'm the one alone in this bed?
As you feel his hands around your waist,
I can feel them around my neck.

God, this complacency has numbed me
And this numbing has scared me
Back into the deep
And I'm slowly learning how to learn from something,
And realizing the only thing worse than feeling pain
Is feeling nothing.

There is an intoxication in her smile and it went straight to my head,
Without it, I can hardly see past the blurred lines that I've always been fed.
And sometimes I wonder, maybe my chest cavity is growing bigger,
Or maybe my heart is just sinking.
Either way we decorate this ship, it's still sinking.

And I always had love to blame,
And I always had love to blame,
As I try to find my way, I feel this pain
And I had love to blame.
I had love to blame.

If I were to believe in love,
I would have to see a flood,
But knowing my luck, I would somehow float to shore
And have to wake up.

I don't want to wake up,
I don't want to wake up.
'Cause I'm trying, just trying to find the light inside.

So roll this stone away,
I don't want to sleep another day.
I just want to be in your presence,
So please let me fade away.
