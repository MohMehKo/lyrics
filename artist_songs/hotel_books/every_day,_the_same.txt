Walking down aisles of vintage stores and peacefully window shopping
Stalking the nightmare that cuts your core and keeps you sobbing
He could be anywhere around you and you just don't know it
The person who ended your greatest joy and truest friendship
It's common courtesy to stay at the scene of the crash but he drove away
And left your heart to reflect upon a peaceful past
Every day, the same tortured silence

What if the future's just to remind me
That my past was my only blessing

You said what if the man who killed my wife sleeps in the house next door to mine
That's the reality with unsolved crimes, he lives with a burder but she only lives in your mind
What if the hollowed out feeling is a memory that I could barely find
Where does faith come in when it's already been confirmed that she has died

[Chorus:]
What if the future's just to remind me
That my past was my only blessing
Where is the sense of thriving
We're all so sick of dying
I see [?]
I see that death could be [?]

[?]
(We're all so sick of dying)
[?]
(We're all so sick of dying)
You're stuck here and she's not coming back
You're stuck here and she's not coming back

[Chorus]
