The minute that this love ends,
You can write down my time of death,
Non contingent upon who I am,
All that matters is who he is.

Living in a world where they say there's nothing to see,
And I believed them,
But god my spirit's willing but the flesh is weak,
I'm ready to let you in.

You cut the path and gave me two feet,
Now teach me how to walk with them,
And if I can't walk,
Then at least carry me.
