We'll make loneliness into love when we're bored
And find the right emotional principle to cut like a sword
Over the words of a past me whispering
Love was the destination but we would settle for some sympathy
Turning myself into my own lord and then finding my own spinal chord
It's finally safe to throw our bones back into the sea
So we can forget what it means to have bodies
When pursuing sanity just feels like some sort of couples therapy
For these dual personalities bleeding into my psyche
Just questioning the answers I give to those I see
And I was taught to never let someone take parts away from who I am
But there are parts that sometimes hurt myself
So what am I supposed to do with them

Your heart is on fire when you water down your words
You started much higher before you found the lord
And you justify the way you hate yourself with forgiveness
Objects of obsession in constant repetition
This cycle where we try to find reasons that we're living
I'm a product of the products I let into my heart before I loved you

Ashes look the same whether they are your lover or an object that you would rather face than dealing with your pain
Or the emotional strain that comes with tearing open the seems
Passionately neglecting anything but the emotional strength
We transform from being two souls searching for love in a bad dream to just two strangers with shared memories
And sometimes I found stability while you kissed your soul goodbye
I know a song won't do justice but it's all I have so I'll try

Your heart is on fire when you water down your words
You started much higher before you found the lord
And you justify the way you hate yourself with forgiveness
Objects of obsession in constant repetition
This cycle where we try to find reasons that we're living
I'm a product of the products I let into my heart before I loved you

Take two years from my life and couple from each friend
We'll collect another thirty years and bring you back from the dead
Take two years from my life and couple from each friend
We'll collect another thirty years and bring you back from the dead
Take two years from my life and couple from each friend
We'll collect another thirty years and bring you back from the dead
Take two years from my life and couple from each friend
We'll bring you back from the dead, you could see me again
You could see me again

And since you left you hardly ever come up
And I'll tell you there's a part that I'll never give up
You tell yourself that I could never find you
Well you never found me when love was such a vacant dream we'd scream
Never let someone take parts away from who I am
But there are parts that sometimes hurt myself
So what am I supposed to do with them
