Forever is not relative, so tell me again if you've ever lied to me.
Life gathers sorrows, and sorrows gather in my head
and no one can die in vain, when no one is ever dead.
And all that's been revealed is all I can know
And all I can really do is learn to let go
And nothing is earned when I'm not awake,
And nothing is learned, even when nothing is gained.

You calm the waters and you calm the waves,
We calm our daughters and teach them to behave
It's a learning curve, nothing I can do can change the circumstances,
but in all of these advances, all I can do is effect the way that I cope
With all the ways this world has made me change.
Because of all the things I've said that I regret.

And all of God's children burn their skin under the same sun,
And we slowly learn how to fall asleep when we're finally done,
Because God let me fall in love, and I can hear her voice echoing back to me
"I'm such a failure"

Forever is not relative, so tell me again if you've ever lied to me.
