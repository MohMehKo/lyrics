There's clouds and sunshine drawn out on a piece of printer paper
And we're gonna thank her cause this picture is worthy of the front of the refrigerator
A picture of a house with a door, a window and a chimney
With five stick figures labeled mommy, daddy, brother, sister and me

And it's so adorable cause the artist is only six
And she spent her whole recess working on it
And to us, no, it's not perfect but it's worth it
Cause to the artist it's a work of art

And little girl, you're getting older now
And you look in the mirror and you don't like that image
So you cover in cosmetics and skip meal after meal to loose the shape
That your artist intended

But I'm here to tell you, you're made in God's image
And if that's not enough for you then what is?
Don't change the shape that the artist intended
To cater to the mindset of some useless pigs

Cause in the eyes of the one who made you
Babygirl, you're perfect

You're perfect
Don't change
The shape
You're perfect
Don't change
The shape

Cause in the eyes of the one who matters
You're so perfect
