There was an ache in the back of my head when I sat down at the table
And realized the silence from last night would bleed into the morning
Fading into a familiar story
With every new ache in my body I remember when I promised myself I would be in love by the time my body started to ache
But it's just another pattern forming

You are the ghost
And I am the wall that you could not walk through
You are the ghost
And I am, I am the wall that you couldn't walk through

There's a time and place for fostered truth and half glass full of emotional prostitutes
Positioned to let go and find hope in a bitter chokehold
A branding of understanding and ranting and raving won't lead to enchanting and saving and saving
Unless you are ready to let go of the feelings of old
I feel more alone when I think of the way that you love me

You are the ghost
And I am the wall that you could not walk through
You are the ghost
And I am, I am the wall that you couldn't walk through

Fragile skeletons trying to find our warmth
I hate that I'm sick but at least I know I was warned
You once were my reason to runaway
Now you are just the excuse
Fragile skeletons trying to find our warmth
I hate that I'm sick but at least I was warned
