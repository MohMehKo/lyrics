When you were three, I was just four
You were the cute little girl next door
We played hide and seek, kissed on the cheek
Cowboys and Indians, you and me
Your ribbons and braids, pink lemonade
Wings and a halo, had it made
I was your knight, and you were my queen
Fought all of the dragons in my dreams
Thought I had you figured out
Read my lips she screamed
Na na na na na

[Chorus]
L is for loser she said
What were you thinking
What's going on inside your head
L is for loser my friend
Ain't got a clue here
What's going on inside your stupid head

When you were eight, love turned to hate
Daddy left home, you moved interstate
My angel was lost, her halo tossed
Wings in tatters, dreams to dust
At nine I was cool, yeah broke all the rules
Messed up the teacher, got kicked outta school
They said you won't get far, with ya drums and guitar
Well speak to the hand, coz I'm rock star 2-3-4
Thought you had me figured out
Read my lips I screamed
Na na na na na

[Chorus]
L is for loser I said
What were you thinking
What's going on inside your head
L is for loser my friend
Ain't got a clue here
What's going on inside your stupid head

L O S E R
Ain't gonna work
Gonna get you far
L O S E R lose

Now at thirteen, how bad could it get
All pimples and braces, the teachers pet
Hooked up with some guy, turned into a creep
Reap what you sow, you said "read em and weep"
Called me on the phone, said you were alone
You're on the next train, you're coming home
Now she was sixteen, she was legal and keen
The sweetest of dreams, you know what I mean
Read my lips she screamed
Na na na na na

[Chorus]
I was a loser she said
What was I thinking
What's going on inside my head
L is for loser my friend
Just you and me here
Let's work it out and get it on instead....
