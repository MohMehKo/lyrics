Do you know all the things I've been through
Do you see what I have seen
I can't stop the world, but I can stop my actions
It seems I just can't stop my head
I'm too tired to think, too tired to breathe, too tired for anything at all
I just want a break, I just want to take a year off from everything

[Chorus]
I can't change the world without you
And I can't change the world alone
I can't change my life without you
So I can't change my life alone

Do you know all the things I've been through
Do you feel what I feel
I can't trust the world, but I can trust my actions
It seems I just can't trust my head
I'm too tired to think, too tired to breathe, too tired for anything at all
I just want a break, I just wanna take a year off from everything
And I feel like I'm wastin all my time
And I feel like I've left my life behind
And I don't think I can take much more of this
When I'm living my life clenched up like a fist

[Chorus]

Do you know all the things I've been through
Will you see what I've seen
I can't stop the world, but I can stop my actions
It seems I just can't stop my head

[Chorus]
