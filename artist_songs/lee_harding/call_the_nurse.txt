Call the nurse
Call the nurse
I'm in pain, I'm in pain
Everything hurts
Vital signs
In horizontal lines
I'm lyin here
Lying here
Outta my mind
Nurse Betty
Well she tore my heart apart, yeah
Turned my life into an episode of ER, and
Everybody likes drama
But it's too much for me

[Chorus]
I want her back, want her back
That nurse in cardiac
Doctor says I'm high on fever
Now ain't the time for chasing beaver
I want her back, want her back
That nurse in cardiac
Every night and day it hurts
I think it's time
Time to call the nurse
Call the nurse
Call the nurse

Cos I need drugs
I need drugs
Something that works
It ain't good
Cos I get wood
Lying here, thinking of her
More than I should
Nurse Betty
Well she tore my heart apart, yeah
Turned my life into an episode of ER
Everybody likes drama
But it's too much for me

[Chorus]

Nurse Betty
Well she tore my heart apart, yeah
Turned my life into an episode of ER, and
I'm not getting any better
Visions of her in a tight red sweater

[Chorus]
