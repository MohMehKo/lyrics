I've seranaded you a billion times
But you don't hear the tune
I'm singing tonight
I guess I must have wrote
A zillion lines
Just to make you see
What's staring you blind
But what do I know
What can I do
But write another love song for you

[Chorus]
If you would sing to me
I'd feel the melody
Won't be just another love song
If you could play the rest
We'd share a sweet caress
Don't want just another love song

The angels all make
A heavenly sound
But I know if you sang
They'd see what I've found
You never seem to guess
What I'm trying to say
Well your my diva
You belong on my stage
But what do I know
What can I do
But write another love song for you

[Chorus]

And I can't love you anymore
More than this
Cos this is the maximum for sure
Yes it is!

[Chorus]

And I can't love you anymore
More than this
Cos this is the maximum for sure
Yes it is!

[Chorus]
