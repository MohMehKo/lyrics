Let's not go to work
Let's just tell the boss he's a jerk
One day off won't hurt
Everybody needs to shirk
Let's just stay in bed
Eatin' Cheerios, getting stoned instead
Why get so upset?
Why don't we just stay in bed?

[Chorus]
And I said why?
What's wrong
What's wrong
What's wrong, yeah
All I wanna do
Is have some fun
What's wrong with this picture, yeah
What's wrong
What's wrong
What's wrong, yeah
Hit the bong
And turn the TV on
What's wrong with this picture, yeah

The world just hates my guts
So I hate it back
I've had enough
Life just **** you up I wanna make the whole thing stop

[Chorus]

The world just hates my guts
So I hate it back
I've had enough
Life just **** you up
And when the going gets rough
The tough get going
When the going gets rough
The tough get going

[Chorus]
