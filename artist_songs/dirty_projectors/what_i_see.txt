I want to live
I wish I was dead
I've got to close my eyes
I want to live
I wish I was dead

This feeling
Haunts me
Behind these eyes the shell seems so empty
Does anything live inside?

I want to live
I wish I was dead
I've got to close my eyes
I want to live
I wish I was dead

Life's cold
And it reaches inside
I reach to feel and to live
A desperate wish begins
And from the start
I can see the end

I want to live
I wish I was dead
I've got to close my eyes
I want to live
I wish I was dead
