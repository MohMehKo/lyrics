We laid on the roof, looked at stars 'til two,
And we talked about the news.
Wasn't too much news, so we went down soon to the darkness of my room,
And naked we made it us too.
And I loved it. I loved it. I loved it. I loved it.
And naked we made it us too.
And I loved it. I loved it. I loved it. I loved it.
Now the moon's waning, and the summer's fade. and [?]
Oblique, oblique, [?]
Let it be the time that we were naked made it us too.
And I loved it. I loved it. I loved it. I loved it. 
I loved it. I loved it. I loved it. I loved it. 
she loved it. I think she loved it.
