Right here
All by myself
I ain't got nobody else

The situation
The situation is bleeding me there's no relief

Depression
Depression
Depression is gonna kill me tonight.

Depression
Depression
Depression is gonna kill me tonight.

I ain't got no friends to call my own
I just sit here all alone
There's no girls, there's no girls, there's no girls
that(?) wanna touch me get away I don't need your fucking sympathy

Depression is gonna kill me tonight.
Depression
Depression
Depression is gonna kill me tonight.

Depression
Depression
Depression gonna kill me...

Everybody just get away
I'm gonna boil over inside [?]

They say
They say things
They say things are gonna get better
All I know is they fucking better
