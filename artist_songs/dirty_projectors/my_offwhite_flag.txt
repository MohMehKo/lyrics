I copped a feel
Of the wall
Trying to find the light switch in the dark
Then I got into bed and fell back asleep, quickly

Its been awhile since I played the game
I've been retired since Saturday

From the first base line I watched the blondes
So perfectly flirting
And I held my off-white flag between my knees
Limply

Its been awhile since I played the game
I've been retired since Saturday
I am a child
And I'm not ready

Its been awhile since I played the game
I've been retired since Saturday
I am a child
And I'm not ready
