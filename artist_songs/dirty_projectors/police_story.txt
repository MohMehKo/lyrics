This fucking city is run by pigs
They take away the rights from all the kids

Walk down the street, I flip them off
They hit me across the head with a billy club

Nothing I do, nothing I say
I tell them to go get fucked, they put me away

Understand; we're fighting a war we can't win
They hate us, we hate them. we can't win.

I go to court for my crime
Stand in line, pay bail, I may serve time

Understand; we're fighting a war we can't win
They hate us, we hate them. we can't win.
