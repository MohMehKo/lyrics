My brother wants a ride
To the liquor store
You pity him
You pity him for what he wants it for

Miserable and thirsty
Always wanting more
Miserable and thirsty
Always wanting more
More, more...

It's now one-thirty
And we're all getting nervous
The store closes
The store closes at two
And there's not enough to last us

Miserable and thirsty
Always wanting more
Miserable and thirsty 
(thirsty and miserable, thirsty and miserable)
Always wanting more
More... (thirsty and)
More...

Thirsty and miserable, thirsty and miserable...
(Miserable and thirsty, always wanting more...)

Miserable and thirsty
Always wanting more
Miserable and thirsty
Always wanting more
More... (thirsty and)
More...
