There was a single one, then there were ten
With time made a hundred and a hundred million 

You came and spoke to me; I saw your face
Your words were like raindrops from a storm in a vase
Each generation different

He was made to love her
She was made to love him
And their offspring loved them

And in the marriage of eagle and snake
The parents are fertile but the offspring is blank

The fire rages and all through the night
The flame is contagious, but the heat feels alright
Can't recognize our poverty

He was made to love her
She was made to love him
And their offspring loved them

There is a darkness I feel coming down
And shadows that lengthen from the sky to the ground
And a silence that can swallow sound

He was made to love her
She was made to love him
And their offspring loved them

He was made to love her
She was made to love him
And their offspring loved both of them
