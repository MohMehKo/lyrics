I ran across cyanide plains,
Mind like a prison cell
But feet untethered and sane

I wandered out hopeless and sad
No thought of where I'd go
Or how I'd ever get back

There is an answer
I haven't found it
But I will keep dancing 'til I do

I boogied down gargoyle streets
Searching in every face
For something I could believe

I knelt beneath one hundred saints
I wanna feel the breath
of a force I cannot explain

There is an answer
I haven't found it
But I will keep dancing 'til I do

Dance for you
Dance for you
