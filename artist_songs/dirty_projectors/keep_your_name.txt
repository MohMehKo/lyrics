I don't know why you abandoned me
You were my soul and my partner
What we imagined and what we became
We'll keep 'em separate and you keep your name

You keep your name
You keep your name
You keep your name
You keep your name
You keep your name

There is a place that we both know
It lives in our hearts, we built it together
Fear is a manacle but love is unchained
So we'll keep 'em separate and you keep your name

You keep your name
You keep your name
You keep your name
You keep your name

I wasn't there for you
I didn't pay attention
I didn't take you seriously and I didn't listen
I don't think I ever loved you
That was some stupid shit
I wanted what, you wanted but we never really felt the same
I kept my name 'cause we were just different
Your heart is saying clothing line
My body said Naomi Klein, No Logo
We shared kisses and visions
But I guess it's shit that Gene Simmons said
Our band is a brand and it looks that our vision is dissonance

You always hurried to grow up
I think I'll always just feel kinda the same
What I want from art is truth
What you want is fame
Now we'll keep 'em separate and you keep your name

You keep your name
You keep your name
You keep your name
You keep your name
