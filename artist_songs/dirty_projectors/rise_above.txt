Jealous cowards try to control
They distort what we say
Try and stop what we do
When they can't do it themselves

We are tired of your abuse
Try to stop us it's no use

Society's arms
Think they're smart
I find satisfaction in what they lack

We are born with a chance
I am gonna have my chance

Rise above, Rise above....

Rise above
Rise above
Rise above
