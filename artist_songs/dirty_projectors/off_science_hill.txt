Off science hill is a fenced off lot
Your classic parking lot at the end of time

And off science hill is where I took a walk
And I heard the finches and their empty talk
Pavement turned into meadow and video tape tumbleweeds
And in the corner, like a dinosaur bone
The huge torso of a street lamp

There are elements in this day, in the day of Miami
Go forth, find them in tank top
Go forth searchin' in flip flops
