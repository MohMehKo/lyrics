You didn't say what you meant
How should I have known it?

If not for ground underfoot
I might have laid my back in it

I might have laid my back in it
For long I lay asunder
And the notices of the bore
Under which you suffer

When
I escape Tuesday
There will not be an email
There will not be a phone call

When
Distracted by the oil
Then I'll be gone
And all will be well
Yeah, all is going to be well
