It feels good to say what I want
To knock things down
It feels good to see the disgust in their eyes

Oh I'm wanna go wild
And spray paint the walls
Oh I'm wanna go wild
And spray paint the walls

I don't want to see the plan succeed
There won't be room for people like me
My life is their disease
My life is their disease

Oh I'm wanna go wild
And spray paint the walls
Oh I'm wanna go wild
And spray paint the walls
Oh I'm wanna get wild
And spray paint the walls
