The new feelings will rise up like fake blood in crisp October
From the cracks and the edges of the graves of our proudest moments
Because that's not a monument, it's a grave

The new feelings will probably be buried here too
But I swear there are people, I swear

The new feelings will rise up like fake blood in crisp October
From the cracks and the edges of the graves of our proudest moments
Because that's not a monument, it's a grave
