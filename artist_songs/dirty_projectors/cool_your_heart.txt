How do you feel?
Is it loneliness?
Is there shining in your heart
But no gloss on your lips?
Do you sail alone?
'Round the island with
The silhouette of a shark beneath the skiff?
And then you say

Wanna be where you are
You're the right one
Wanna be where you are
Cool your heart
Wanna be where you are
You're the right one
The right one
The right one

You've been
Waiting
For the light in me
And there's been waters indeed

We've been
Hanging tight
For all the things we want out of love
So wade, go deep, on these mellow waters too

Wanna be where you are
You're the right one
Wanna be where you are
Cool your heart
Wanna be where you are
You're the right one
The right one
The right one

Wanna be where you are
You're the right one
Wanna be where you are
Cool your heart
Wanna be where you are
You're the right one
The right one
The right one

Though I been trying hard
Not to fall
The feeling is tumbling in
Last night I realized
It's been feeling wrong
To start relying
Making decisions
Based on another person

Cool your heart
Cool your heart
Cool your heart
Cool your heart

Cool your heart
Cool your heart
Cool your heart
Cool your heart

Wanna be where you are
You're the right one
Cool your heart
Wanna be where you are
Cool your heart
Cool your heart
Wanna be where you are
You're the right one
The right one
Cool your heart
The right one
Cool your heart
The right one
