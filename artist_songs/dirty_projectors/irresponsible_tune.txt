With our songs, we are outlawed
With our songs, we're alone
But without songs we're lost
And life is pointless, harsh, and long.

In my heart, there is music
In my mind is a song
But in my eyes, a world
Crooked, fucked up and wrong

Sing all day
Record and play
Drums and bass, and a guitar
Will there be peace in the world,
Or will vile winds always own the truth?

There's a bird singing at my window
And it's singing an irresponsible tune
An irresponsible tune
