No, I won't believe that this is all
I'm not happy, I'm not free
No, I won't believe that this is all
Pay check to pay check
No, I won't believe that this is all
Every night I get drunk

I need action, won't take no more
It won't work out
It won't work no more
It won't work no more
no more, no more

Control for who? For what?
Reaction's Masochism
Control for who? For what?
I'm no robot, they can get fucked
Control for who? For what?
I need to live, I need it now

I need action, won't take no more
It won't work out
It won't work no more
It won't work no more
no more, no more
