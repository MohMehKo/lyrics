Worlds collide and conquer
Annihilated in each other
Only one is victory
And neither of them are it
Only maybe i saw you just the other day
And i inherited my father's sense of dread
My head, it's been a long time gone
I wonder whether is it coming back?
Is it coming back?
A crazy man will cut his hands
And let them writhe like fish
Only maybe he'll forget
What he is staring at
Maybe did you see a bear?
My head, it's been a long time gone
I wonder whether it is it coming back?
[?] is it coming back?
I wonder whether is it coming back?
Is it coming back?
Is it coming back?
Is it coming back?
