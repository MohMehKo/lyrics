The highway is a foggy knife
Through night time hills I stand flickering
At my brother's side 
And he says words I want to hold

Seventh day adventers collide
Cry soft in the night
Metamorphose

If she sounds like you
She's your daughter

Wobbling in gray with sweaty palms
You shall be released, you shall be released
