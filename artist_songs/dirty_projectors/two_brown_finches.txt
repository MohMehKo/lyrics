Like two brown finches, talk-talking away
Gone is the afternoon, and what did we say?

Lik two brown finches, chirp-chirp-chirp-chirping away
Gone is the afternoon, and what did we say? (Not a lot)

And we drank a two liter of Orange Crush
Yea we drank a two liter of Orange Crush
Said we drank a two liter of Orange Crush
