Gimme, gimme gimme gimme some more,
Don't ask, don't ask don't ask what for,

Gimme, I need some more,
Gimme Gimme Gimme, don't ask what for,

Sitting here i'm a loaded gun, waiting to go off
I've got nothing to do but shoot my mouth up

I know that the world's got problems, i've got problems of my own.
Not the kind that can't be solved
that can't be solved. that can't be solved, that can't be solved.
