Thirty-five dollars and a six pack to my name

Spent the rest on beer so whos to blame

I know it'll be o.k.
I get a six pack in me, alright!

They say Im fucked up all the time
What they do is a waste of time

I know it'll be o.k.
I get a six pack in me, alright!

I was born with a bottle in my mouth
Now I got a six so Ill never run out

I know itll be o.k.
I got a six pack in me alright!
