[Mark Morrison:]
Well, I tried to tell you so (yes, I did)
But I guess you didn't know
As the saddest story goes
Baby, now I got the flo'
Cause I knew it from the start
Baby, when you broke my heart
That I had to come again
And to show you that I'm with

You lied to me
All those times I said that I loved you
You lied to me
Yes I tried, yes I tried

Return of the Mack, once again
Return of the Mack, top of the world
Return of the Mack, watch my flow
You know that I'll be back

[Fetty Wap & Mark Morrison:]
Cause the money ain't enough
I remember when it was
Letting all the people know
That I'm back to run the show
Cause the money ain't enough
I remember when it was
Letting all the people know
That I'm back to run the show
That I'm back to run the show
That I'm back to run the show

[Mark Morrison:]
So, I'm back up in the game (hustling sound)
Running things to keep my swing (whole night long)
Letting all the people know
That I'm back to run the show
Cause what you did you know was wrong
And all the nasty things you've done (oh oh oh)
So baby listen carefully while I sing my comeback song

You lied to me, cause she said she'd never turn on me
You lied to me, but you did, but you did
You lied to me, all this pain you said I'd never feel
You lied to me, but I do, but I do, do, do

Return of the Mack, there it is
Return of the Mack, come on
Return of the Mack, oh my God
You know that I'll be back, here I am
Return of the Mack, once again
Return of the Mack, top of the world
Return of the Mack, watch my flow
You know that I'll be back, here I go

[Fetty Wap & Mark Morrison:]
Cause the money ain't enough
I remember when it was
Letting all the people know
That I'm back to run the show
Cause the money ain't enough
I remember when it was
Letting all the people know
That I'm back to run the show
Letting all the people know
Letting all the people know
Letting all the people know
That I'm back to run the show
Letting all the people know
Letting all the people know
Letting all the people know
That I'm back to run the show
Letting all the people, letting all the people
Letting all the people know
Letting all the people know
That I'm back to run the show
Letting all the people, letting all the people
Letting all the people know
Letting all the people know
That I'm back to run the show
That I'm back to run the show
That I'm back to run the show
