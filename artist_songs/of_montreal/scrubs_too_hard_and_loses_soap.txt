Waiting thru a river of stars
Our lips touch like butterflies from a cannon
Taking belly-button baths with Mr.Neptune
And my hippopotamus
Tennis shoes on

Moonlight bounces off the ocean
And gets stuck in your hair

Does my voice not have wings?
Yours are the only ears I wanna disco when I say
You're the one I'm breathing for

Putting a rasin under your pillow
And a couple in your heart
To fall out when you laugh
Like a volcano luaghs at a Chinese octopus
You need a cat for chasing angles out of the kitchen

A blue crab apple spider
Makes a web out of bannana cream

Does my voice not have wings?
Yours are the only ears I wanna disco when I say
You're the one I'm breating for
