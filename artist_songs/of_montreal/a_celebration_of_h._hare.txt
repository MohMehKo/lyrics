Dear sweet brother of mine
I'm so glad you've made it
You've really accomplished something incredible
And I'm so very proud of the art we create now

I love you I love you
And I know that you love me too

Dear sweet brother of mine
I'm so glad to say it
Together we're making something incredible
And I'm so very proud of the way that we live now

I love you I love you
And I know that you love me too

Its strange how when we were young
I was so mean to you
I didn't know the connection we had till we go older
But now yes now

Dear sweet brother of mine
I feel I should say that
All of these things I make with you
give my life meaning

What started with the Gay Parade
Will continue till the end of our days
