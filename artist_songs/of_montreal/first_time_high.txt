You should know, you should know that I
Am not just searching for 
Some first time high
I know its all about perceptions
And I accept you as my very first mover
I am
I was a foreigner when you appeared
From the shadows at the [?]
I was a hater in the depths of
And emotional hibernation
You sat me down
We had some drinks
And you told me all kinds of insanity
I asked your friend if you were available
She answered no but yes oh well oh well yes and no
Does she know, you should know that I
Am not searching for some first time high
I know its all about perceptions
And I accept you as my very first mover
I am

I remember riding bikes on Costa Island
Plotting midnight raids on the sweetest plum trees
That summer
It was too cold to swim
So we climbed upon the rocky shore
And freaked out on the mountain goats
But they were not impressed or scared of us
Do you remember
Oh that summer was independence
Do you remember (Do you remember)
Oh that summer was independence 
Now I'm doing a memory reel in reverse
Scrolling back to come to feel your weather then
Now I'm noting that in my self a parabola
To predict the point of I shall not return
But you should know you should know that I
Am not searching for some first time high
