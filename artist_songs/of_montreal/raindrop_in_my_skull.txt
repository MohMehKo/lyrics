There's a raindrop in my skull
I'm too shaky now to get it out
I guess it fell from some far away cloud
Bloated with radiation
Oh
Some people are singing of the birth
Of another soulless drone who'll grow to leach off the earth

My guitar feels strange in my hands
I have almost no tactile perceptions
On the TV there's a Mexican horror film
It isn't dubbed, I'm not really watching
Oh
Some people are singing of the birth
Of another philistine
Who'll grow to ravage the earth
Oh
Last night, when you left me
I took a walk through the fog
And the gossamer light of the strawmoon
The haunting strangely humid pitch of winter's waning
Then my recurring dream of the swarm

There's a raindrop in my skull
I'm too messed up now to get it out
It must've fallen when my mind was somewhere else
Now I'm fixating on it
