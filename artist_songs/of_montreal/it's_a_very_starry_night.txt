It's a very starry night though the moons not very bright.
It's a very attractive sight this fair and starry night.
It's a very starry night watching barristers in flight see them disappear from sight on this fair
and starry night though I'm by myself I am not alone there are lots of little creatures
who call this their home and I am so loose I'm not afraid to say I don't know what is keeping my body from just floating away.
It's a very starry night watching solicitors in flight.
See them hovering like kites on this fair and starry night.
Though I'm by myself I am not alone.
There are lots of little creatures who call this their home
And l am so loose I'm not afraid to say.
I don't know what is keeping my body from just floating away.
It's a very starry night
