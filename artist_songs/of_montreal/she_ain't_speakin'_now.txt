Like some sepulchral tableaux
I sit frozen holding your hand
Though I'm trying to think only
Positive thoughts I understand

That this tomorrow
May not be the tomorrow
That your eviscerating suffering will end
Oh, will you ever be yourself again?

Girl with the flu, I hear the death rune
She ain't doing well
Her eyes they seem cast and fatherless
Her psyche's cracked or
Anyhow, she ain't speakin' now

Nightfall, like some leaden sea
Dilates as I hold vigil by your bed
Watching the pillowcase soaking with sweat around your head

I can't repel this snaking veil of morbidity
That's disfiguring the seraph of your face
Oh, the organisms been debased

Girl with the flu, I hear the death rune
She ain't doing well
Her eyes they seem cast and fatherless
Her psyche's shattered or anyhow she ain't speakin now

You scream that the books
Are falling off of the shelves on to you
But I can't see them
Your hallucination ravings
I'm writing them all down so
You can read them
When your mind no longer aches
And your febrility breaks

Girl with the flu, I hear the death rune
She ain't doing well
Her eyes they seem cast and fatherless
Her psyche's cracked or anyhow she ainâ€™t speakin now

Girl with the flu, I hear the death rune
She ain't doing well
Her eyes they seem cast and fatherless
Her psyche's shattered or anyhow she ain't speakin now
