Joseph and Alexander ride their flaming swans
above Miss Dovepost and her loudmouth niece
who had a fear of geese and who even in a corset
looked remarkably obese

Joseph and Alexander redirect their swanis left
to take a gander at the funnel nosed threes
in the Pekinese trees
who are normally a nervous sort
but now seem quite at ease

Joseph and Alexander are brothers and best friends
the wonderful adventures that they share together never end
Be sure to send a smile for me and Dave
to wherever they're pretending to be
I hope they keep a journal
and take lots of photographs
of all the funny things they see

Joseph and Alexander
approach the nest of the speckled salamander
who with utmost care is knitting thermal underwear
She smiles and hollers up
"These are for my grandchildren to wear"

Joseph and Alexander feeling tuckered
now decide to meander back into their beds
and kiss their swanis on the head
but before going to sleepy land
Joseph turned and said
"Aggats, I love you"
Alexander yawned and said
"Joseph me too I love you"
