The problem is a different girl, an Athenian beachÂ­goth
We have so much to live for but living is not one of your talents
You you were just slumming it with me, you faked it, I was your slum
Now I can't even talk to you, easy rider see whatcha done done

Gabrielle, I met the plague of you, l'appel du vide of your trashed exes
I felt like Antonin Artaud because I refused to cry
I saw our withering and thought "how romantic"
I saw our withering and thought "I'm glad"
Did you really try to love me? that doesn't sound like you
No not you

Now that I am dispossessed I feel almost happy
Happy that I no longer have to be the prey of your syndrome
I do miss the corybantic wilds of our furious and awful love
I was ready to share everything oh honey what was I thinking of?

Gabrielle, I met the plague of you, I met the plague
I felt like Antonin Artaud because I refused to cry
I saw our withering and thought "nothing tragic"
I saw our withering and thought "good, I'm glad"
Did I really try to love you?

Gabrielle, I met the plague of you, l'appel du vide of your trashed exes
I felt like Antonin Artaud because I refused to cry
I saw our withering and thought "how romantic"
I saw our withering and thought "I'm glad"
Did you really try to love me? that doesn't sound like you
No not you
