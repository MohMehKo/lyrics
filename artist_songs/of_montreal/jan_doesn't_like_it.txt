Jan doesn't like it when they enter the apartment through his head

Come play with my erection
Can't you see that it's standing at attention?
I'm amenable to a personal inspection
And I've come to pay respects to your thirty-two perfections

You never going to get to Janna, killing dreams like that
Thor will see that it just never happened

I met your friend at the festival
He asked me why I was so pretentious
As I was being interviewed, I was thinking, "My God!
They always pick the wrong time to try and break your heart"

Everybody seems so critical
He started shaking because he realized that we were so aligned
Like the sisters and the kids who are always making scenes out of nothing
Yes, so anyways I guess your friend's sound

It's another psycho afternoon in the cattle forges of your heart

They only shoot dead people now
They said they only shoot them after they're dead
Oh
They only shoot dead people now
They said they only shoot them after they're dead

The rat has touched the wall
The rat has touched the wall
The rat has touched the wall
The rat has touched the wall
The rat has touched the wall
The rat has touched the wall
The rat has touched the wall
The rat has touched the wall
The rat has touched the wall
