Of course this world would be better without you
This is true for most everyone or at least people like us
But you can't really martyr yourself when no one gives a fuck
Stop acting like a victim stop conceding defeat
It's so tedious to watch someone you care for keep failing themselves

You've been dead twice before but it didn't really change you
Someone's always there to save you and then help you clean up the mess, you're a mess
I like how you're ugly, do I like you too much to really tell you what you're most needing to hear?
Christ, you're such a sadness

Won't you be good to me? won't you be fair?
Won't you be sweet, won't you always be there?
Won't you always be there?

Won't you be good to me? won't you be fair?
Won't you be sweet, won't you always be there?
Won't you always be there?

I think you're just looking for a reason to go off the rails, start another bender
To wound yourself, though it's never critical
You called me two weeks later to get some sort of closure
So you wouldn't have to feel like such a pig
But I think you should feel that way because you are one, maybe we both are

I know that someone else's pain is never interesting
Yeah other people's suffering is so boring
But I hope you realize that I could never hate you
Look to survive in this world you don't have to become a parasite
You don't have to be so mercenary so cruel
I'm only just now learning this myself

Won't you be good to me? won't you be fair?
Won't you be sweet, won't you always be there?
Won't you always be there?

Won't you be good to me? won't you be fair?
Won't you be sweet, won't you always be there?
Won't you always be there?

Won't you be good to me? won't you be fair?
Won't you be sweet, won't you always be there?
Won't you always be there?
