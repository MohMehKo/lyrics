When Sarah comes down when Sarah comes down
When Sarah comes down from Detroit I'll exhume myself and meet her

Till the day she's here I'll stay underground
I don't have to feel evil any more and I'm happier when she's around

When Sarah comes down when Sarah comes down
When Sarah comes down from Detroit I'll exhume myself and meet her

Till the day she comes I'll stay underground
I don't have to feel guilty any more and I'm something better when she's around

Sarah come down Sarah come down
Sarah come down from Detroit
