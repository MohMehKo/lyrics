I wanna know how you feel
I wanna know won't you please please tell me so
tell me so, tell me so
I'll know to bring us closer
cause thats all I want to do
to bring me closer to you 
to you me closer to you 
bring me closer to you

I want to know how you feel
How am I to know if you don't tell me so
tell me so, tell me so
cause I sometimes get the impression
that for me you no longer care

please let me know if our romance is over
if you no longer love me, i should know

In the shower and on the bus
At the cafe in the office
I just can't get my mind off of it
You never say a word, so I have to say them for you
Please tell me if I'm just insecure

I need to know how you feel
How am I to know if you don't tell me so
tell me so, tell me so?
