Rose Robert I'd like to welcome you to our affair. We'll write a lovely little
story just you and I as time goes by me and my Rose Robert. People stare when we
walk arm in arm along the thoroughfare. The gentlemen don't know whether to bow
their heads or tip their hats instead at me and Rose Robert. All of our days
move so slow since we stopped and let the world go on without us. We haven't get
a care me and Rose Robert. You're delightful mon chere it's so lovely when we
wear each others clothes. You draw on your mustache while I powder my nose.
Josephine and Fanny don't compare to my Rose Robert. Rose Robert together we
make quite a remarkable pair. It doesn't seem strange somehow that we never
speak we just gurgle and squeak me and my Rose Robert. Few will dare to offer
any pleasantries or see how we fare. I guess they assume that we have lost our
wits but we're just a couple of misfits me and my Rose Robert. Rose Robert. hot
