If you have any flaws we haven't noticed them
there is nothing at all you are lacking in Louis Kabu
We are looking at you and we see an august gentleman
Miss Birdy concurs and she'll say so openly
through an ear horn in gentrified eboniks she purrs
“Monsieur Louis I adore you,I just adore you”
Everything you attempt always ends in success
and everyone that you meet always leaves feeling blessed
Louis Kabu we are looking at you
and you know that I remember when we first met your kid
It was in Chinatown
she was a cute lost little orphan
so we gave her a home

I could travel the world
and yet still fail to see a soul
that is half as kind or as fancy free as Louis Kabu
We are looking at you
and you know that I remember when we first met the kid
it was in Chinatown she was a cute lost little orphan
so we gave her a home

Now I haven't a qualm
in declaring that there is no one at all
quite as caring as Louis Kabu
we are looking at you and we see a dashing gentleman
Miss Nico bemoans cause you love Bird more then her
but when you deign to allow her a visit she avers
“Monsieur Louis I adore you I just adore you”
If you have any claws we haven't noticed them
there is nothing at all you are lacking in Louis Kabu
no no not our Louis Kabu
