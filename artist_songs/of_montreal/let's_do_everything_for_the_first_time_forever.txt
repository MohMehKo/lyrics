Will you kiss me again so I can pretend we're kissing for the first time Because
when we kissed for the first time I was distracted. I couldn't believe it was
true that I was truly really finally kissing you. Will you hug me again so I can
pretend we're embracing for the first time. Cause when you held me for the first
time I lost my senses. I couldn't believe it was real Inside I was laughing and
dancing like peppermint eels

You are a miracle like Madeline Meech consoling moaning stallions on the beach.
While they choke up foam for the tide hahahahaha hahahahaha

May we dance again so I can pretend we're dancing for the first time Because
when we danced for the first time I was so nervous. I could hardly stay on my
feet. My felicity must not have been very discreet. Will you give me your hand
so I can pretend I'm holding it for the first time? Let's do everything for the
first time forever. And if forever you are my friend I'll never ever feel
unhappy again

You are a miracle like Hanze Cercheek transposing scores by Satie on the beak of
an inimical red breasted lark hahahahaha hahahahaha.
Hahahahaha hahahahaha hahahaha
