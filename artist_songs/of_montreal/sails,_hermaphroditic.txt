I've been trying to be your friend forever
I just knew we had so much in common
Champagne and strawberry pancakes for an after sex snack
Yes you are a thriller but I'm not your ride
Besides I'm out of tickets, and where's your pride?

If I could Dr. Frankenstein (Dr. Funkenstein)
The world (if I could change your mind)
Start this bitch anew
I would change the shit out of you [x3]

I broke a window and then passed out in your car
Just then we shared spiritual hallucination
This synth solo about to pay my bills

If I could Dr. Frankenstein (Dr. Funkenstein)
The world (if I could change your mind)
Start this bitch anew
I would change the shit out of you [x3]
