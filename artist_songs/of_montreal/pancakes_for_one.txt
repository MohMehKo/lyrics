Pancakes for one are always depressing
because having breakfast with you was such fun
Pancakes for one are no fun

Cocktails for one are never enchanting
because having drinks with you was such fun
Cocktails for one are no fun no fun no fun

Standing near the vendor on the platform
waiting for your train
But yet again you're not on it
and I'm crestfallen holding a drooping flower bouquet

A sundae for one is never delicious
because eating junk food with you was such fun
A sundae for one is no fun

All I've left of you is a photograph
which only upsets me
cause I can't draw your attention
your frozen in time
Pancakes for one are always depressing
because having breakfast with you was such fun
Pancakes for one are no fun
