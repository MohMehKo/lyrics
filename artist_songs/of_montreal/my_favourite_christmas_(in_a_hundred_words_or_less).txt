Do you remember that one Christmas when we
Didn't think we'd be together.
We were almost seperated by the weather
But I ran through the snow
Right up to your window and smiled cause I
Was so absolutely happy to be with you

All our relatives were too afraid to drive
Through the snow
We got to spend the day alone, I swear it
Was the most beautiful day I know

We sat by the fire and opened the presents
That we'd gotten for each other then after
You telephoned your mother. We cuddled on
The couch, drank cocoa by the tree and you

Smiled cause you were so absolutely happy 
To be with me

The day went by so fast and as night
Approached we laughed at our luck. The
Snow had let up
After the roads were cleared all our relatives
Suddenly appeared
So we blew out the candles and replaced
Frank Sinatra with Phil Spector's Christmas record
Our grandparents filed in all plaid and 
Checkered with their arms filled with gifts
And delicious desserts and we smiled
Cause we were so absolutely happy
So very very happy to be together
