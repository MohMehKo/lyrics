Riding to the station on the bus
Cause I want to pick out some books
But Jen She's a librarian
and she hunts my butt to this day
Usually the bills make me stay
the night at banks so...

Sorry but you're just not my type
You know I'll walk you home anyway
Did you know I had a funny dream
and in it I was in the army

Riding to the station on the bus

Cause I want to pick out some books
But Jen She's a librarian
So it's time to get down spin on the ground
And say I want to turn the daytime into dusk
Or if you're very tired we can simply retire
and say I want to turn the nighttime into day

Sorry but you're just not my type
You know I'll walk you home anyway
Did you know I had a funny dream
and in it I was in the army.
