Waking up alone
No song to sing us off the edge
The speakers are blown
This planet is an orphanage
Deep abandonment issues at our core
But if not each other, let's fuck our tool to really keep us lethal

Ain't got no ride
Least not one that returns our message
Our parents aside,
this planet is an orphanage
And it cheapens us
the way you and I
torment each other
It's just the way we combine

Time for you to decide
Get on the concrete
You with the soldier
Are you just playing yourself and me too?
I got your letter and it hurt me so many ways
Had no breath to respond
Boy, you let your brothers down
And you would have it your own personal ghetto
But no one's forcing you to stay there
Our circle's not so cannibalistic, baby

Waking up alone
No song to sing us off the edge
The speakers are blown
This planet is an orphanage
Deep abandonment issues at our core
But if not each other, let's fuck our tool to really keep us lethal

Ain't got no ride
Least not one that returns our message
Our parents aside,
this planet is an orphanage
And it cheapens us
The way you and I
torture each other
It's just the way we collide

It's time to make up your mind
Get in the cellar
Are you going to betray yourself,
or come join us up on the days?
The conspiracy that's forever unfolding in your head
It's just not real
Boy, you let your people down
I put so much of myself here
Just to try and accommodate you
You know I saved your life a little too, hey brother

I don't resent you, but I can't settle the debt of our serrated history and blows I haven't got over yet

And it cheapens us the way you and I torment each other
