All of my thoughts are from a foreign host
Now I feel just like a ghost
Now I feel just like a ghost
Now I feel just like a ghost
Now I feel just like a ghost

All of my thoughts are from a foreign host
Now I feel just like a ghost
Now I feel just like a ghost
Now I feel just like a ghost
Now I feel just like a ghost

All of my thoughts are from a foreign host
Now I feel just like a ghost
Now I feel just like a ghost
Now I feel just like a ghost
Now I feel just like a ghost

Don't be afraid lille v채n of violence
I'm only poisoning you, not gonna stab you.
Don't be afraid lille v채n of my troubled mind
I'm just poisoning you a little
With my gloom

This far too much like a noise
It happens to be not so nice
I must nod
I must shatter
I must diffuse
This fractured consciousness
This soft abuse

The identity I composed out of terror has become oppressive now
I must (not) defy (defeat) this dark assignment
I'm over it now
I'm so over it now

Don't be afraid lille v채n of violence
I'm only poisoning you, not gonna shoot you.
Don't be afraid lille v채n of my troubled mind
I'm just poisoning you a little

Every day
