The problem with April is the problem with May
is the problem with June and July
it's the problem with all of the months
since you said goodbye

The problem with Monday is the problem with Tuesday
is the problem with Wednesday and Thursday
it's the problem with all the week
since you went away

The bills keep piling up
and my bed gets bigger and bigger
I feel like I'm being watched
and I'm forever under the weather

The problem with Summer is the problem with Fall
is the problem with Winter and Spring
it's the problem with all of the year
since you're no longer here

The problem with evening is the problem with morning
is the problem with the afternoon
the problem of all of the day
since you went away
