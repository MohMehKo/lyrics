I'm so excited, I just can't wait for you to come.
I've been living alone and lonely far too long.
When I see your face
And the love that's in your eyes,
You know I just can't place this feeling.

I'm so excited,
All my sad days will soon be over.
I know you can do it, because you did it before,
And I'm happy when I'm with you.
I guess it's a lot to ask of you
To change everything that's bad.
You know I have to laugh at this feeling.

There's one thing I hesitate to add -
What if it turns out bad?
We'll be living together,
Will we be spending too much time together?

I'm gonna find out just how close we really are,
And if having you around is better than being alone.
If I had to bet whether this works or not I'm certain
That it will but still I can't forget this feeling.
