I see it, girlfriend
I got so lucky with you.
Yes I feel you strutter
I got so lucky with you
So freaked out and depressed
But now I see how I was so blessed,
So blessed with you girlfriend

I know there ain't no one person that everybody else in the world
Hates on, wants to die,
Sometimes I do think it's me,
Like I'm in a fight simulator and I am crushing the birth of any potential memory
I'm still way erect for you, not going to lie
You cured me of my death anxiety, only took you two tries
The head scene dropped the vaccine, and I've chosen a very powerful penance

I know it girlfriend I got so lucky with you
I feel ya' strutter I got so lucky with you
So hammer on guitar for who you are
With me being your straight up only solid number yeah
I see it girlfriend I got so lucky with you
I feel ya' strutter I got so lucky with you
So tweaked out and depressed but now I see that i was blessed
So blessed with you girlfriend

I want to prove to you I've advanced in varna
I can't even pick up that brahmin signal any more
I can't cope with such an abstract blackmail domination spasm
Although it makes a temporary difference
I'm really not your possession, I am just your friend.
Still there's an invisible suture that keeps me in my seat next to you till the end.

I made a wish that I really shouldn't have
Cause when it came true I didn't know what to do with it
Are we to blame for our dreams?
I see your progress as a predator just like everything else

We spoke of frontal lobe regression, this is not one of those

I know it girlfriend I got so lucky with you
I feel ya' strutter I got so lucky with you
So Cristal mimosa fizz for what you is,
With being your one solid lion-hearted brother yeah
Girlfriend I got so lucky with you I feel ya' strutter
I got so lucky with you
So freaked out and depressed but now I see that I was blessed,
So blessed with you girlfriend
