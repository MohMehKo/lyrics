When I was looking for the rainbow
Staring at the gorilla
I thought we'd share some sundae
oh but you ate it all

And I was so scared to fall
but you were some kind of domino

And it was easy
so easy
so easy
to care
when you were always there

it was easy
so easy 
so easy
to care
easy when you were always there

But now you know I'm not so friendly
and all my friends are alone
