I am a happy yellow bumble bee, I fly around the flowers and trees
and all morning long, I flutter about in the swirling breeze and the sun is yellow like me

I am a happy yellow bumble bee, everything's so much bigger than me
but I'm not afraid, for if something gets too close, I give them a sting that makes them howl and scamper away..

No I'm not afaid, though sometimes I get lonely because my parents are dead and I can't find my brothers or sisters.. 

At night the sky looks so black and I can't find the sun.
It doesn't matter how hard I try, but when i feel like I'm covered in darkness, and that light won't touch me anymore...
I hear the cardinals singing and I know who they're singing for when I see the sun...... 

That makes me a happy yellow bumblebee, all my friends are beetles and centipedes and all 
summer long we laugh and we play, but we don't talk to spiders because they're mean and they try to trick us, because they want to eat us..
but they'll never beat us....
