What I recall
Remembered best is insanity
And the clatter

Misapprehensions are
Killing you but not
Fast enough to really matter

The flume of your struggle
Is flooded with sorrow and
It poisons everybody near it
I'm not a patron of yours anymore
Don't want to hear it
The sirens of your toxic spirit

Of your addictions and shiftiness
Inherited from your father
I know you struggle to keep them in check
But at this point why even bother

The flume of your struggle
Is flooded with sorrow and
It poisons everybody near it
I'm not a patron of yours anymore
Don't want to hear it
The sirens of your toxic spirit

What friendships you have left
They're not derived from love
They're just some warped form of charity
I've wounded you and you've wounded you too
At least we can feel good about the parities

The flume of your struggle
Is flooded with sorrow and
It poisons everybody near it
I'm not a patron of yours anymore
Don't want to hear it
The sirens of your toxic spirit
