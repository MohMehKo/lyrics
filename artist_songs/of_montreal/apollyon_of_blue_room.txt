On junk with Dark Globe and doom invocations
And somebody's dope demon brother
The opiate drone of her gaze
Their anodyne days
The cracked bas relief
Of Hellenic summer
Carbolic kilo

I know that she's only trying to score
And not very human anymore

The loom has gone lame
The pattern's insane
The agents have wigged out
The pulse is corrupt
The choter's a fang
No function

We set another Aegean sleep deprivation experiment
Stumbling around Monastiraki Square
Crawling to her in my undress
My heart is a mess
The ruin's depressed
The shit of our withering depths
The din is intense

I sense that she's finally turned the lock
But I just want my Anatolian rock

I've been through so many deaths
That I don't know which name to answer to
Fidelity breeds madness;
I trash the heights, the peak

Now I'm on my own
No violence on the telephone
You're a child of neglect
But you turned out okay

The way my psyche rioted
I was just as shot
Your new lover like a hearse
An idiot, a failure

I recoil at the sound
The milking of vipers onto the barren dirt
Just steps from the orchard
Looking beneath the higher tease
The satans of the vicious yayo society

I can't get no rest
My dreams are corrosive
Nightmares scar vampires, too
My thoughts are voltaic
I'm such a downer,
Huh

Now I'm on my own
No violence on the telephone
You're a child of neglect
But you turned out okay
Ooh
The way my psyche rioted
I was just as shot
Your new lover like a hearse
An idiot, a failure
Ooh
