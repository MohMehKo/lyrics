So she's depressed
And I am losing my mind
It's so difficult now
Yes, everything has changed
As we struggle against an impossible current
How can we make things light again
How can we win

Is happiness even possible
Don't say you don't believe anymore
Don't say that you are lost to me now
It's a free fucking world, you can go where you want
How can we make things light again
How can we win
How can we make things light again
How can we win

It's a mad free fucking world
You can do what, go where you want
Leave me, don't leave me alone
Leave me, don't leave me alone
It's a free fucking world, you can go where you want
