I'm a motherfuckin' headliner, bitch, you don't even know it
(Process it!)
I'm a motherfuckin' headliner, bitch, you don't even know it

Why's it white girls don't ever have any ideas
and they don't even know
what's on my channel?
But that is true for almost everyone
Everyone but you
My goat, my crab, my scorpion
You're my icons 'cause you're different
You're different

I love wicked wisdom
Half turn my at two wet come free
Don't send me no more evil visions
They just stab my heart.

I'm just a black she-male
And I don't know what you people are all about
What you people are all about
I just know how to make it
(Peanut butter) Like this

Oooh, just a look at her is god
Can't you see it baby
Can't you see it baby
Shan't you see it baby
(I'm like)
Oooh, just a look at her is god
Can't you see it baby
Can't you see it baby
Shan't you see it baby

(snakessssss)
When we get together
It's always hot magic
When we get together
When we get together
When we get together
It's always hot magic
When we get together
It's always we are the champions, my friends
When we get together
We're gonna hit
What you work with

Ooh, you've got such super wicked style
Show it to me baby
Let me see it baby
Show me to your baby
Ooh, you've got such super wicked style
Show it to me baby
Let me see it baby
Show me to your baby

When we get together
It's always hot magic
When we get together
When we get together
When we get together
It's always hot magic
When we get together
It's always we are the champions, my friends
When we get together
We're gonna hit
What you work with

All I care to hear
All them standing gray insects inside the house machines
Knowing what's come next
Something temporary reference for the other side
All I care to hear
Elitist's commentary about some Phaidon press limited edition
I hear the toy ball bouncing on cheap hardwood through their elegant conceit
All I care to hear
You have such power to destroy
No time to process that now
You're so iconic in my mind
