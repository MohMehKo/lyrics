It's easy to sleep when you're dead but you're unable to touch your loved ones, give them kisses or see them smile at you
It's easy to sleep when you're dead but you give up your whole life's work
and you can't revers the bad things that you did

While alive you still have hope that when you die you are dead
and you know for sure if it's better, if it's better, if it's better
I hope it's better

It's easy to sleep when you're dead

Though you can't feel the warmth of summer, smell the flowers of spring, or drink cider in the fall
It's easy to sleep when you're dead though it's too late to say the words you wanted them to hear when you didn't have the nerve.

You get to spend eternity thinking about your life. 
Think of all the time that is. Eternity is forever, is forever, is forever. What will I do forever?
At this time there is nothing you can change. You can only sit and watch and hope they understand
It's easy to sleep when you're dead. Cause there isn't anything else to do but sleep. I feel sorry for the dead.
