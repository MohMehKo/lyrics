Jennifer Louise you don't know me but we're cousins
your mamamama and my mamamama are sisters
Jennifer Louise I haven't seen you since I was a kid
when my family spent the weekend at your house
and your father helped when my eyelashes stuck together

My mom told me that now
you're a young professional
living with a significant someone

Jennifer Louise we know so little about each other
I'll probably never call you up,
write you a letter or see you in person
Basically Jennifer Louise you don't know me
and we're not friends
But I was just wondering about you
wondering if you ever think about me
