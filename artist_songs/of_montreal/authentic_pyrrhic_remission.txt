So much violence in my head
How are we still alive
The condition is under control
(No it's not, don't you ever stop buying that air)

I love how we're learning from each other
You are such an positive
You're so empowering
Left in your hands, I'm quite simply a different instrument
And you're the only one that ever put money on me
You think that I'd forget so easily
You can emit a charge that's (to die?)
I know we're of the same tribe
The Fall's the most productive season
Still a crippling fear as we (conceive?) and we're slightly (moribund?)
So naturally I want to help you and invoke the architect of salutary needs
Architects are present with divine mechanics, but oh how we're tyranized by
tentacles of their theorized to ability that's all so disappointing
(Sheer difference)

I love how we're learning from each other
You are such a positive
You're so empowering
In your hands, I'm quite simply a different instrument
And you're the only one that ever put money on me
How to advance transhuman singularity

I love how we're learning from each other
You are such a positive
You're so empowering
In your hands, I'm quite simply a different instrument
And you're the only one that ever put money on me
You think that I'd forget so easily

I love how we're learning from each other

Everytime I listen to my heart
Just get hurt

Until this afternoon, I was a nomad
No country would call me its son
I'd be a refugee, but I have no substance
Asking for papers, I have none

Until this afternoon, I was a pariah
Amoral, chased, kicked, and hit
Hunted even in my dreaming
But there was no crime I did commit

Until this afternoon, I was an exile
And now that word is obsolete
The ontonations know concept of ego
Our illumination is complete
