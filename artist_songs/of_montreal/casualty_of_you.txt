How could I tolerate looking you in the eyes
How you've evolved, no tears at all
It's not fair, it shouldn't be like this
You shouldn't be so composed
I don't know, should be more awkward
Hate you for bringing this up,
Making me feel what I know just isn't true
You've ruined me, you're a terrorist, I'm a casualty of you

Your sister called today, heard the phone ring, really why should I answer?
She's so critical
I wasn't surprised to hear her single word message
Just said "stop!"

You stole something from me
Can't say what, just know it's gone now
Everything is wrong
Everything is wrong
Everything is wrong
I'm a casualty of you
