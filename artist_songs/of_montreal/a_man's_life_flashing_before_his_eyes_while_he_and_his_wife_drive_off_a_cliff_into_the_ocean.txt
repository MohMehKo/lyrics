I heard a human voice in an adding machine and my brain slipped out of my ear
Which made it hard to hear
A customer clapping in approval
A bird flew
through the window
And he sucked it
right into his mouth
I looked on the floor and saw
The carpet was turning to glass
I lifted my feet very fast and ran out the door

I walked to a bus stop there I waited the bus
And when it finally arrived I climbed up inside
A lady sat down beside me
She gave me a mirror
When I looked in it I saw I was her
This made me forget that I was
Driving at night with my wife
She's so beautiful the love of my life
We drove into the sea
