On a charming and frozen magical island far out at sea. I will take you there with me No more ridicule no more grief they can't reach as out at sea think how happy we will be. We loved their waxy faces but there wasn't any life below. There wasn't any life there wasn't any life there wasn't any life under their wax exteriors. Would you like another coconut I think there's one defrosting in our hut. Though the weathers quite inclement and when there's snow storms I can't see my shoes. I'm still glad I'm here with you. There's funny animals with beards and all of the fishes are see through The skunks have noses like cazoos. I like it here I like it here I like it here I like it here I like it here I like it here. I like it here I like it here I like it here I like it here I like it here I like it here. I like it here I like it here I like it here I like it here I like it. We climbed for hours and days and years and centuries the islands sole lonely mountain until we were high enough to see the otters wearing monogrammed feces by a large and noisy donkey mole regime
