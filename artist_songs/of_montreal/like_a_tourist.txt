I saw your movie tonight
I thought you were pretty good
I'm so happy that you're doing what you want to
You go to your favorite dark place, think of the auto-da-f√©
Unicorns eating baby meat
There's a dragon rape if you want one (one's the loneliest number)
Smokehood merlion, female erection,
You fetishize the archetype
Ha! you fetishize the archetype

Don't treat me like a tourist, let's stay high on a negative wave
And paint it black just like the good times
Don't treat me like a tourist, let's stay high
They break our hearts like it's our birthdays, soak us in animal blood

I want somebody to frisk me
I want this night to distort me
But I didn't come here just to see you dancing
No, or to admire your art
Or try and cure your Androphobic heart
Anyways I'm crippled inside

Don't treat me like a tourist, let's stay high on a negative wave
And paint it black just like the good times
Don't treat me like a tourist, let's stay 'woke' like Pharaoh
And paint it feral in our heads again
Like when we were passengers

Don't treat me like a tourist, let's stay high
They break our hearts like it's our birthdays, soak us in animal blood
