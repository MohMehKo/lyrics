Getting trolled by inanimate klaxons
They'll leave me alone though t.v. is faster
The children are shown the incest husk, no one wants you to remove the mask
What's the point?

Dowager jinx of rat­father no other grey stranger stinking under her burka
Bleeding captions like a Noël Coward
Crowd fumed with thunderous step mother said it's not sad, this is fun
Starved myself for a polygraph, failed so badly we both fell to laughing and you
Know it

It's not bad it's not sad it's fun
I guess we can surprise ourselves when we stop acting way too tough
I guess we can surprise ourselves when we stop acting way too tough
I guess we can still surprise ourselves when we stop acting so tough
