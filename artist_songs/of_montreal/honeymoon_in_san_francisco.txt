Honeymoon in San Francisco, what a grand idea.
We'll rent a room in a four-star hotel
We'll spend the whole time drunk on champagne and lime
We'll never feel the need to get out of bed, though on occasion we'll charter a boat sail off to a distant island
Once there we'll take off our shoes and relax beneathe the sun

We won't care if we lose our minds
We won't care if we live or die
We'll spend the whole time drunk on champagne and lime
We won't care if we lose our minds
