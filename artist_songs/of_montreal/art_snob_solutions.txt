What's up directors? Grab your knives!
It's time to take all all of the lives
Of the people who cannot see the somnolent genius of Tarkovsky

Come on authors grab your guns!
It's time to murder everyone who's never heard of Apollinaire
Send them all to hell it's only fair

Cast them all into the flames if they don't know any names
Of the principals of Arte Povera
Or are unfamiliar with le serpent mascara
That's right mascara snake!!!

Come on painters alive or dead
Give all the cretins a boot to the head
If they don't extol convincingly
Tempered Elan era Kandinsky

Throw them all into a well if they cannot tell
An Arto Parv feast of repetition from a Schoenberg 12 tone composition

Come on artists the day is here
And your mission is very clear
Put an end to the bourgeoisie
And death to everyone who's never heard of me
