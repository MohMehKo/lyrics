I want to live in an elephant coma
I want a second chance, sweet, sweet second chance
Dropped your glasses in the toilet
Punched the mirror in the restaurant bathroom

She likes boys, boys who wear cologne
She lets them take her home to her place
Mess up her face

Doctor arrests you for getting sick
Puts you away for a long time
Says you'll be released when you're better
But they didn't ever come
