I know that in my dreaming world
the friends I've made aren't imprisoned there
and they are not pretend.
They are just as real as this world
that I've grown to know.
And though I have enjoyed myself I really have to go
Let's go for a walk so I can say goodbye to you.
That is unless you'd like to come too.
