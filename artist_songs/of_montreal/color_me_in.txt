I am gray, still on the page
Oh, color me in
Just an outline, sketchy but fine
Oh, color me in

If green is chasing the hills over miles
If blue is pursuing the sky
If the red of your heart doesn't mind
Where to begin to color me in

Something new and nothing to do
I'm just the idea
I must be real cause somehow I feel
That I'm just the idea

Let's share the blue of the towering sky
The green of the hills that run by
Leave the red of your heart to decide
If you cannot choose which color to use

I'll always wait, it's never too late
To color me in, to color me in
Today or next year, I'll always be near
If you want to color me in
