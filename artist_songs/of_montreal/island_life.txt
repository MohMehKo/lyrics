Rubicund forms drying on the boy's prick or dare I say remotely lady of speaking bummer destruction?
Second to lone tribal trolls the fist of migrant hormones scything in pairs the will to piss their island life

King derelict outed shifty ranges and kinky drones no fetal sex traumas without revenge a boring execution climax of trinity maggot a hard death cosmetic like eel scented anti-christ christmas nark wanking mother defect

It frightens only feels snake-flayed commuter sawdust beached like bleached provincial murder, unmanned eidolons
And that's true mood tenses feeding gulls attack of ghetto breasts, vial teenage produce, wadded flames of nazi static
