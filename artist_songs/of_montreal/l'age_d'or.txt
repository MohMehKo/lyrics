I saw her in the strangulation room, she said, "Do you think your venom is strong enough to really work on me?"
I think she just wants me on the temporary.
She said you're all fitness but... is it just a paper love?
And I kept you in my kiss almanac
Ever since you dropped your stage name; reemerged as Viper Fragment, I've liked you so much more.
I've noticed things about you I never had before.
And I want you on the kitchen table, public bathroom, on the dirty floor.
Shit, they're knocking down the door. Ah, I've missed your encore

I know she's kind of fug
She's just my party drug
Ain't all that fly my damn self
I know she's kind of fug
She's just my party drug
She's just my party
Young pussy is a star
How slick you are

Got to get my bust
Before this planet turns to dust

She's the only flight I'm really on

I know she's kind of fug
She's just my party drug
She's just my party
At least for tonight

I know you were scared because I was your first secular lover
And it didn't feel like we kind of healed each other
We play deprivation games
I let you load the cartridge
You and your spring, you
hungered for everything
Was I just a symbol?
Something for you to escape to?
All the things I made you do that return to haunt you
But come on, let's not pout, it was just an adventure
At least I taught you how to stop living like such a mouse

I know she's kind of fug
She's just my party drug
Ain't all that fly my damn self
I know she's kind of fug
She's just my party drug
She's just my party
In the moment to light
Got to get my bust
Before this planet turns to dust

I know she's kind of fug
She's just my party drug
She's just my party
Tonight

Your legs are sticking out to UFO, fey fey

Can I fey fey?
Nah, your name is List Christy
