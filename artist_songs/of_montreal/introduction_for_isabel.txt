I'd like to introduce you now to Isabell Iam present owner of the Edward Iam wax
museum daughter of the comedic duo Dorothy and Edward. Do you remember them?
They accomplished mild success on the stages of the vaudeville theatres in
Blackpool and in London that was before the advent of Hollywood. When vaudeville
died and people stopped going to see them So they took out a loan and built a
big wax museum inside of an old abandoned vaudeville theatre. It was about this
time that Dorothy gave birth to their only child and named her Isabell and from
that day they were so happy and gay. Momma, papa and their sweet and thoughtful
treasured fair haired angel baby girl. Eventually a half a century passes we see
Edward in a wheel chair Dorothy in granny glasses and Isabell the proud
proprietor of the wax museum. 

Wax Museum.

Isabell would you like to tell about the bell hidden inside your name. 
Does it ring every time someone calls out Isabell? 
Do you hear it when you run? 
If it broke they'd yell out "Isa" instead of Isabell until you fixed your bell
