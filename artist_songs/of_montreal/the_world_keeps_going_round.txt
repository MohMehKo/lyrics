You worry 'bout the sun
What's the use of worrying 'bout thebig old sun?
You worry 'bout the rain
The rain keeps falling just the same
You worry when the one you need
has found somebody new
But the world keeps going round
The world keeps going round
You just can't stop it
The world keeps going round
You worry 'bout your friends
What's the use of worrying now you're almost grown?
You worry'bout your own
What's the use of worrying cause you die alone?
Well times will be hard and rain will fall
and you'll feel mighty low
But the world keeps going round
The world keeps going round
You just can't stop it
The world keeps going round
Well times will be hard and rain will fall
and you'll feel mighty low
But the world keeps going round
