Nothing can save me from the pain
of you not loving me
It doesn't help me to complain
I just have to feel it
and hope it goes away

But it's so useless and it hurts just like it did before I'm afraid that I'll close up inside

and no longer feel anything anymore

It's such a strange need to be deprived of
To just want love and feel happy
