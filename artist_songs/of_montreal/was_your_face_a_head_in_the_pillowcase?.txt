Looking under the ghost on your face
kind of ruins it for me
I don't want to see you toss it's hair
No I don't need you to show me its smile

You see because I'm learning
yes I know about your mask
so I no longer have to ask

If I can peek behind the ghost on your face

that really ruins it for me
I don't want to clap and stare
while you show me the expressions it makes

You see because I'm learning
yes I know about your mask
so I no longer have to ask
"Was your face a head in the pillow case?"
