I love to sleep I love my bed
cause it brings strange dreams to me
and life's much better when I'm asleep I can see anything don't
have to worry about anything
I know you love to sleep you love your pillows
cause they bring sweet dreams to you
and life's much better when you're asleep
you can do anything don't have to fuss over anything

I can't wait to be old growing senile together
holding hands and both completely out of our heads
We won't notice when we're dead
we'll be too busy dreaming too busy dreaming
We'll be too busy dreaming

Life's much better when you're asleep
you can do anything don't have to fuss over anything

Well there's nothing quite as great
it's my favorite mental state
subconscious stream of thought
creates avant garde films in my mind
and watching them is how I like to spend my time
I love to sleep I love my bed
cause it brings strange dreams to me
and life's much better when I'm asleep
I can do anything don't have to care about anything

I can't wait to be old growing senile together
holding hands and both completely out of our heads
We won't notice when we're dead
we'll be too busy dreaming too busy dreaming
We'll be too busy dreaming
