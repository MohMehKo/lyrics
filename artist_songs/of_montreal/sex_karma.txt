I believe we're moving on up
Your sex karma must be good
Cause I'm funny for you
Ain't no body do me better
When you hit me I'm a cloud
Baby, I'm a cloud
I feel my power is flickering
With you it's strange electronic reactions

[Solange Knowles:]
I know that you want to swing
Run and touch my everything
Cause I look like a playground to you, player

Close your eyes and count to three,
I'll kiss you where I shouldn't be
Cause you look like a playground to me, player

You are my only luxury item
Anyone try to steal you
I'll fight 'em

Let's go do some hide and seek
I know you are a little freak
You look like a playground to me, player

I was afraid to call you up
Cause you were really hard to fly
On our first try

You took me centuries to master
In the next life I will have to learn you faster

I'm not a diamond, so you'll flatter
Cause we're not slaves to physical matter

I know that you want to swing
Run and touch my everything
Cause I look like a playground to you, player

Close your eyes and count to three,
I'll kiss you where I shouldn't be
Cause you look like a playground to me, player

You are my only luxury item
Anyone try to steal you
I'll fight 'em

Let's go do some hide and seek
I know you are a little freak
You look like a playground to me, player

You look like a playground to me [8x]

Close your eyes and count to three,
I'll kiss you where I shouldn't be
