Someone's in love with someone who doesn't love them back
their body's like a hollow room
They carry around an empty feeling wherever they go, wherever they go

When one is crying over someone who doesn't even care, their body's like an empty tomb

They carry around a desperate feeling where ever they go, wherever they go
their in a hollow room..

A hollow room. All the devils in the world couldn't think up a more painful thing to be in love with someone who doesn't love you back.
