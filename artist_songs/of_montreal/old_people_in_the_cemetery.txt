Old people in the cemetery
what must they be thinking of?
must be frightening must be scary
to visit the grave of a close friend
who was the same age as you when they died

There's nothing precious about
old people in the cemetery
reciting bible passages
unprepared to come to terms with
the fact that we're all food for worms
what do they think a prayer
could make a difference now?

There's nothing sadder than
an old woman in the cemetery
picking leaves off of her husbands tomb
Knowing that her only wish is
that she will die and join him soon
It's so sad to see them all just wither away,
there's nothing sadder then old people like that

It must be hard to relate
after the world of your youth
totally evaporates

Old men in the cemetery
lurking like faint shadows of the dead
gazing down at mother's plot
and longing to be there instead
it's a dreary fate 
and no one should have to be 
as depressing as old people like that
