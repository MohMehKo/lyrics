Coquet coquette you know I won't forget
How you kissed me strange to prove you were mythical
Oh my coquette you used my voice as your earthly vehicle

Coquet coquette you know I won't forget
How you hurt me twice to prove you were cynical
Oh my coquette you are the death you are the pinnacle

With you I can only see my black-light constellations
And other shit I don't think I have the language to say
I don't want to catch you with some other guy's face under your eyelids
Something must be wrong
You give me emotional artifacts that can find no purchase

Coquet coquette you know I won't forget
How you sold me out to prove you were typical
Oh my coquette you're Herculean you are so miserable

Coquet coquette you know I won't forget
How you made me cry to prove I was dutiful
Oh my coquette my teenage lust for you is so beautiful

With you I can only see my black-light constellations
And other shit I don't think I have the language to say
I don't want to catch you with some other guy's face under your eyelids
Something must be wrong
You give me emotional artifacts that can find no purchase
