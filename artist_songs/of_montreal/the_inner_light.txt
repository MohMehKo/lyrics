I've heard about inner light it makes the 
brown in your eyes look watery
I felt something while talking to you, Gently 
intoxicating I felt the source of your inner light
It's such a struggle though I know I have to, 
I just can't bring myself to touch it
I need to feel the inner light

I want to be the angel God sends to you
To keep you on the right course although I
Just don't know if I believe in it
It's such a struggle though I know I have to 
I just can't bring myself to touch it
I need to feel the inner light.
