Kissing in the grass smiling to say
“oh golly gee I think you're dreamy”
learning so much that way
I do tend to believe
there's precious little that could amount to more
Then kissing in the grass smiling to say
“oh golly gee I hear bells ringing”
forgetting so much that way
I do tend to believe there's precious little
that illuminates us more then kissing in the grass
