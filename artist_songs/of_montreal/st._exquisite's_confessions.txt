I'm so sick of sucking the dick of this cruel cruel city
I've forgotten what it takes to please a woman
But that's all gonna change [2x]

Now the freaks wanna take me home to see
If the rumors are true,
so I kick open the doors and windows
To let the world hear sure
There's so much anger and pain
But come see, there's still some gentle people
fucking to strawberry letter 23

Now we're both laughing
(Bitch)

Maybe I'll blow you
Whatever kind of kisses you want
Because you've got so much in common
With my peacock creator
We function on the lowest human level
But still somehow keep living
I thought it was over but it all still hurts the same
It still hurts the same

I only photograph my fascinations
Till the stress of the flash makes them fade
The danger is real but I'm mute to the feeling
We started by giving each other interesting notes sober case (sober case)
Seduce a dream back to the surface
Clarify my empty elephant of some beautiful death
It's time to get to know the article that you'll be stripping
Ladies of the spread
You better keep my secrets in that perfume poodle head
Now c'mon, to the replacement dolphin that's cheating treats
from the bottom of the hotel pool
The lion leaped out of his pendant and then
He talked about Valerie and her week of wonders
(We-V-I-L)
She loves to do beautiful things

Feeling voices again not good
Look the sky is pregnant with maggots
Cuz something happened in the parking lot
I'm searching for the context not finding it
Don't make it real for me
Some things are better left victims
