Should I watch some Fassbinder to grow more connected to you?
You know I never believed in us we're just too degraded to be true
Degraded, look at you, degraded, what can I do?

Oh we only act nicely when we're ruining hotel beds
I greeted you in a hundred doorways, Maldoror chanting in your head cause you're
So degraded
Look at you, degraded, what can I do?

Did something shocking happen when you were just a kid?
I wonder if you'll ever see yourself, it probably wouldn't matter if you did cause
You're so degraded, look at you, degraded, what can I do?

Our love was a purity until mundanity struck
I guess that last time in Capitol Hill will be our farewell fuck
Cause you're so degraded, look at you, degraded, what can I do?
