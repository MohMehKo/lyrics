Natives have a name for me but I can't remember what it is
Some fucker took what's mine and now he's acting like she's his
Your shifty friend gave you a cactus for a gift
Oh-oh, oh-oh

Such a stupid offering, what it's meant to symbolize?
Hostile immobility, is that something to prize?
Floodlights generate a hum, render sleeping some myth of man
Oh-oh, oh-oh

The morning finds me alive with my face pressed in a glass door
This summer's been nothing but rain
Nature is writhing in her own filth again

Took the bus to Plaza de toros on a dare
You cried all through the bullfight and cursed me for taking you there
Riding back in silence to the hostel thinking only
Only estocadas

The morning finds me alive with my face pressed in a glass door
This summer's been nothing but rain
Nature is writhing in her own filth again
