She fell in love with a boy
Who spoke a second language
And who lived across the ocean
In the evil empire

He awoke her sleeping heart
And swept away the darkness
An acute fear of flying couldn't keep her away

She landed on her feet
And joined his fledgling rock group
As they toured the evil empire
Selling t-shirts at the shows

She taught him what was real
She taught him he was okay
That his thoughts were not just rubbish
That he had something good to give

Still his heart was so ambivalent
And homesick of her
He wasn't ever sure.
But she gave in so sweetly
That the spirit said, "Well you better go run to her"

So when she split, he hopped on a plane
With his parents and his brother
He told her that he loved her
They were married in the summer
