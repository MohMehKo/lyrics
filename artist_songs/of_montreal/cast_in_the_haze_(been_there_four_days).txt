I'm happy today
Because I'm in love
And feeling afraid
Oh, I hop off the train
Singing your name

I knock on your door
I don't know what to say
When you answer I just smile
And say "hey"

I'm happy today
I'm up on a cloud
And caught in the fray
Oh, I'm pacing the floor
In the scarf that I wore
On the day that we met
By the old statuette
Of an infant in the nude
We both thought it was lewd

And it's a gas
To be cast in the haze
And I've been there for days
Yes, I've been there for days

I wanted to play
The fabulous game you taught me yesterday
But it's impossible to play
When you're away
I take all of my books
And I toss them aside
I don't want to read them now
Prose pales to you somehow

And it's a gas to be cast in the haze
And I've been there for days
Yes, I've been there for days
(I'm so turned on)
[?]

It's a gas to be cast in the haze
And I've been there for days
Yes, I've been there for days
