Look who's talking to their shadow like one who hasn't got a friend
Like somebody with a broken heart that is never gonna mend

Look who's walking through the night in the rain like one who's under a spell
Like somebody with a lot on their mind, but no one to tell

Everyone you see seems so happy and carefree 
They've found someone to love, but you are alone

Look who's flipping through the photographs of those happier days
Only losing something beautiful could make a person feel this way

Everyone you see seems so happy and carefree 
They've found someone to love, but you are alone

Look who's talking to their shadow like one who hasn't got a friend
Like somebody with a broken heart that is never gonna mend...
