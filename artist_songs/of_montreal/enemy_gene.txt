Aren't you sick of the con
Not quite Homo-Luminous
They're expecting so little
Can't feel the miracle

A zombies licking your window
For black body radiation

[Janelle Mon√°e:]
Love breaks the machine
Everything is half apart--what can it mean?
How can I trust my fractious heart
Knowing I have the enemy gene?

Love breaks the machine
Everything is half in dream--how can it be?
Everything is born in shame
It's not just me
Particle wave duality
How can we ever evolve
When our gods are so primitive?
They destroy the film

They want to disable my system
Looking for traces of a clean hit
If the end of the world has ever happened
This must be it
I've grown too strong that's what they said
To keep my animal spirit
It empties me
Now I'm vacant

Love breaks the machine
Everything is half apart--what can it mean?
How can I trust my fractious heart
Knowing I have the enemy gene?

Love breaks the machine
Everything is half in dream--how can it be?
Everything's born in shame
It's not just me
Particle wave duality
I know that we'll never survive
This little victory

Love breaks the machine
Everything is half apart--what can it mean?
How can I trust my fractious heart
Knowing I have the enemy gene?

Love breaks the machine
Everything is half in dream--how can it be?
Everything is born in shame
It's not just me
Particle wave duality
How can we ever evolve when our gods are so primitive?
They destroy our hope for peace
Hope for love
