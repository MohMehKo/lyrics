Troubled dreams, troubled dreams
I've been cursed by troubled dreams
I've been hurt by troubled dreams
Troubled dreams, troubled dreams
I've been worked on by troubled dreams
I've been hurt by troubled dreams

You can't let them hear what you're thinking
Or they will throw you back into jail, uh-huh
Aluminum crown, it could scramble their gear
If you keep it on while you are sleeping
Now that youâ€™re adept to them, they want to wiretap your nerves
They want to drive you mad with [?] ocular surveillance
And subcognitive harassment

Troubled dreams, troubled dreams
I've been cursed by troubled dreams
I've been haunted by troubled dreams
Troubled dreams, troubled dreams
I've been worked on by troubled dreams
I've been hurt by troubled dreams
Dreams, dreams, dreams, dreams, dreams, dreams
