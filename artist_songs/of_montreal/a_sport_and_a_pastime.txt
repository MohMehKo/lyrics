I wanna belong to you I wanna be yours 
I don't wanna be mine anymore I wanna be yours
I wanna lose my ego I wanna be possessed by you 
I don't care about my freedom I just want to be yours yours only yours

I was twitching while you painted your eyes 
feeling all lit up inside like the torches on Saint John's Eve
And I wanted to be wealth to you cause 
you're above you're above you're above you are above
My love above you're the only beauty that I ever dream of

I wanna belong to you I wanna be yours 
I don't wanna live in fantasies I wanna be yours
I want to lose my identity I want to become one with you 
I don't care about myself anymore I just want to be yours yours only yours

I was twitching while you painted your eyes 
feeling all lit up inside like the torches on Saint John's Eve
And I wanted to be wealth to you cause 
you're above you're above you're above you are above
My love above you're the only beauty that I ever dream of

I was twitching while you painted your eyes 
feeling all lit up inside like the torches on Saint John's Eve
And I wanted to be wealth to you 
cause you're above you're above you're above you are above
My love above you're the only beauty that I ever dream of
