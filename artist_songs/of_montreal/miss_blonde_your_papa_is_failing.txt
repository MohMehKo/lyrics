Little friend, whatever happened
You should know that I went down so hard 
Trying to keep the family together
The family together

Sweet friend, know I love you
And I've been struggling so hard, so hard
Trying to keep the family together
The family together
The family together

When I look in your eyes
I see me looking back
It's kind of creepy how you own my heart
Yeah, you own my heart
Yeah, you own my heart

Let's stay together

Sweet friend, was I born to give
You a name and then be erased
All because I couldn't keep it together
Couldn't keep it together

Little friend, I know I've made it so
So much harder on us and lost you 
Because I couldn't keep it together
Couldn't keep it together
Couldn't keep it together

When I look in your eyes
I see me looking back
It's kind of creepy how you own my heart
Yeah, you own my heart
Yeah, you own my heart

Let's stay together
