I don't want you anymore
I don't love you anymore
Go away, go away, go away
You're a bad thing, terrible thing
You destroy my head
You un-calibrate my skull
Go away, go away
You're a bad thing, useless thing
You marginalize me
You sabotage me
Go away, go away, go away
You're a bad thing, you horrible thing
You steal my light
You suffocate my life
Go away, go away
You're a bad thing, you miserable thing

Like some childish demon that takes pleasure from its sting
You're a bad thing, bad thing
Bad thing
You act aloof
Say that I'll crawl back, you must be sick

Thought she was my Annie Hall
Or at least Ali McGraw
Now I feel so wilted
It's a famine affair
The whole attempt was shoddy
Just to put trash in my body

He was nostalgic for the ground
Hope down the drain
Still flew to your tragedy in a glass-bottom airplane
Looping like a retard
Are you still playing the race card?
She said you're not boring
I'm just bored with you
The psychology behind it is ruthless
Wish it weren't true
Wish we weren't so complicated
Wish you weren't so medicated

I don't want you anymore
I don't love you anymore
Go away, go away, go away
You're a bad thing, terrible thing
You don't let me sleep
And when you do it's just teeth falling out nightmares
Go away, you're a bad thing, useless thing
You marginalize me
You sabotage me
Go away, go away, go away
You're a bad thing, you horrible thing
You've been trying to make me ugly so you'd have a reason to leave
So you could say you were just like abandoning the ruins
Bad thing, you miserable thing

Like some childish demon who
Keeps insects on a string
You are bad thing, bad thing, bad thing
You act aloof, say that I'll crawl back, you must be sick
