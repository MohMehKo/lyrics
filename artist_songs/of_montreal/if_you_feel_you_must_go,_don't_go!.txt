I love you completely.
Please I don't want you to go, though are not content here with me, and you feel you must go.
How could I lose you so fast? 
How come our love did not last?
How come I waited my whole lonely life for you, just for you to leave me lonely too?

I love you completely
My dear, I wanted you to know, throughout this big world nobody else has loved someone so.
I tried to live a life of beauty
I tried to love you truly
I tried to hold in my arms, but you slipped right through me. 
I never knew Venus to be so moody.

I love you
