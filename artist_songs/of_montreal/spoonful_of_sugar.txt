Sometimes I'm feeling bad and then again I'm sad
But she makes me happy
Sometimes I'm feeling wrong and that I can't go on
But she makes me understand and see

She's a spoonful of sugar to me
So sweet so sweet so sweet to me

She makes me feel so right, makes everything so bright
That's why I love her you see
Best girl I ever had she never made me mad
She's the right girl wouldn't you agree?

She's a spoonful of sugar to me
So sweet so sweet so sweet to me

One thing I understand I'll soon to be a man
And I'll want her for the rest of my life
One thing we'll have to plan I'll soon want to have
Her hand and I'll want her to be my wife

Sometimes I'm feeling bad and then again I'm sad
But she makes me happy
Sometimes I'm feeling wrong and that I can't go on
But she makes me understand and see
