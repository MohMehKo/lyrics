Other people can be so disappointing
I need to spend more time alone
What gives us the right to be so depressing?
224 West 16th Street was our cathedral

[Refrain:]
These tears I cry for you must prove that I'm not the demon that I'm meant to be

You say you love me though just like you aren't too shady
Knowing what you know, it must be hard to trust someone who's so similar to yourself
Don't you know it's pointless to try and bully me into caring more
Assume no fault of your own, it's really just the boredom of being someone's captive

[Refrain]

Check-in at the Jane hotel
[?] terrible people
[?]

As usual as dead from anti-anxiety meds
And the old gang grasping for air that's not there

[Bridge:]
Seeking out my own authentic season in hell
Though it doesn't feel quite as pompous
At least not as I can
At least not as I can tell

Dream, dream

Misery [?] yawning
Wrecked me [?] summer's [?]
That I am free and almost alone
Down in Jersey I feel [?]

Why would you ask? Why should you care how I'm doing?
Do I bother you with those kinds of vapid questions anymore?
I wanna matter, I wanna be your friend, not a poison
This kind of love, our kind of love is so demoralizing

[Refrain]

[Bridge]

Seeking out my own authentic season in hell
Though it doesn't feel quite as caustic
At least not as I can
At least not as I can
At least not as I can tell
