How can she feel good 'bout being man in high castle
When she knows it was my home and I ain't even welcome there?
Oh god, I want to go home
See, it's nothing now
Just a shell, just a ruin
Still I think I ought to sit among my articles of decay
The Shivah, or whatever, for our love, it is ended
It's time to burn the death veils and live again

Oh god, I want to live again
See, I'm just like you, baby
Makes me crazy, to languish in this purgatorial rot
Disappearing is eerie
When you don't even care to maintain a physical form
Or give voice to the pariah plaintiff in adjudication rooms

Take it easy, Satans, I don't want her to grieve
I hate that she's been wounded by these changes in me
I don't wanna hurt her, I just want to be free

Oh god, I want to live again
It's terrible to see our effigy hanging there to
Watch it burning just 'cause some goodness is gone

Take it easy, Satans, I don't want her to grieve
I hate that she's been wounded by these changes in me
I don't wanna hurt her, I just want to be free

Take it easy Satans, I don't want her to grieve
I hate that she's been wounded by these changes in me
I don't wanna hurt her I just want to be free
