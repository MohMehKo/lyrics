i'm such a vulnerable lad
with nothing to protect me
from your world so bright and full of laughter
i went home and sank my head into the pillow
i closed my eyes and tried to hear it again
to hear you laughing again

i cried in a dream
while i was staying at your place
i tried to talk about it over breakfast
but you made a joke out of it
and i never told you why
my, my, my, didn't it seem
that you were only playing with me
i wrote you a letter on the flight home
which evolved into a love poem
so, of course, i couldn't send it then

i cried in a dream
while i was staying at your place

i'm such a vulnerable lad
with nothing to protect me
from your world so bright and full of laughter
