I'd go down on you if that would make you happy
my panda bear
my panda bear

please stop bombing my lullabies to pieces
my panda bear
my panda bear

you don't understand what the morning does to me
in the poison daylight I can hear

shadows crawling over everything

I'll go down on you if that would make you happy
my panda bear
my panda bear

you don't understand what the morning does to me
in the poison daylight I can hear
shadows crawling over everything
