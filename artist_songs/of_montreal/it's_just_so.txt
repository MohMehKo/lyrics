I don't wonder why I love you I don't have to know. It's just so. I adore you from your head down to your baby toe. It's just so. Sometimes I get scared and hesitate because it seems strange to be so intimate. It makes me uncomfortable but I'll get used to it. I don't want to hide it now I need to let it show. It's just so. When you hold me close I feel a warm and happy glow. It's just so. Sometimes I'm unsure if you're the one or my best friend who I'm clinging to. My feelings change so quickly so I'll trust you to lead me
