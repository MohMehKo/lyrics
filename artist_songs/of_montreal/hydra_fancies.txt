How 'bout you my new favorite thing?
I heart you though don't know you very well
I really hope that this summer you will change your pursuit
I throw my guns down for you

How 'bout you my new favorite thing?
Their flashbulbs burn my irises
But still I love to see you upon your pedestal
I just love to see you win

Oh when they torture you
It's like standing on a dragon's tongue
They flashed your pretty nightmare on the sky when I was playing your card
Kissing your deaf son

How 'bout you my new favorite thing?
Will you have me in your orbit evermore?
I know it's work to cope with my dementia and stuff
But I'll throw my guns down for you

How 'bout you my new favorite thing?
Today I planted some flowers in your name
I am trying to build a freak flag empire for three
Cause I just love to see you win

When they experiment I will become your surrogate
I really can't conceive of any balance in my future anyways
The coma is poisoned

You've rattled me, there's uncontrollable sensory reactions on infinite defeat
I've so much to tell you and it can't wait till you're born again
