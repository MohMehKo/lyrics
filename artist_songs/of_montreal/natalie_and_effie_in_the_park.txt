Sundays were made for strolls through the park
though before today she'd always gone alone
Now the sun shines down all around them
cause Natalie's not alone she's not alone
On Friday she'd bought a Yorkshire terrier
and instantly found a true friend of her own
Now they sing and skip through the flowers
cause Natalie's not alone she's not alone

She named him Effie
Effie was his name despite a bladder problem
she loved him just the same
She takes him nearly every where she goes
he delights her with the many tricks he knows
Now the sun shines down all around them
cause Natalie's not alone

She knits him sweaters and woolen Winter hats
from the window she watches him chase the neighbors cats
And laughs and laughs “Hey Effie
would you like to go for a walk?
Would you like to go for a ride?”
And Effie never left her side until she died
