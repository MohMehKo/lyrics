Predictably sulking Sara wears a scowl on her face
which no attempt at cheering can erase
Look at her face so sad
Consistently mopey Murrey worries his thong
will be replaced by the hand whose eyes are shooting mace
Look at his face so sad

Maybe it's best if two people
as sad as this never meet
but we wonder if somehow it might help
to see one so sad for oneself
to see how they look to the world so sad
Look at their faces so sad
