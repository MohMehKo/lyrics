Now a man loving a woman that's a very
Common thing common but beautiful all the same
Still there's something so neat something so 
Extraordinarily sweet with a man who's in love 
With a man
I have nothing to say about the traditional ways
They're fine if they work well for you
But there is something so right so completely
Out of sight
With a man who's in love with a man
Or a woman who's in love with a woman
They should never feel ashamed because it's 
So important to do the things we want with 
Whoever turns us on
Now a man desiring a woman that's a very

Common thing common and really rather dull
There is something so strange something so 
Wonderfully deranged in a man desiring a man
Or a woman desiring a woman....
Men are usually fighting each other that's
Why I think it's so special when a man and 
A man are in love It's so good It's so special
Now a man kissing a woman is a very 
Common thing common but usually
Quite nice still there is something so fine
Something so beautifly devine In a man 
Kissing a man
A man kissing a man
