If you don't know what this song's about
Then you should go and see a doctor

I look at you and I see
Microuniversity
The graying cracks of post-commital formal conversation
Most empowered porous mutant mental?
Intimate a drain before the Haitians
Mental has a drain before the Haitian patients
Everything's a drain

I want to live like a box of matches
Conflagration and I hope it catches
I want to die just like a china cup
Don't look at Pete because he's throwing up

I look at you and I see
Microuniversity

The female eunuchs
And I know nothing really changes
Mother Nature's still a mental?
Office case the wealth of our creations
People [?] paranoid creations, patients
Everything's a drain

I want to live like a box of matches
Conflagration and I hope it catches
I want to die just like a china cup
Don't look at Pete because he's throwing up

I look at you and I see
Microuniversity

Microuniversity
Microuniversity
Microuniversity
Microuniversity
Microuniversity
Oh, hoo
Microuniversity
Oh, hoo
Microuniversity
Oh, hoo
Microuniversity
Oh, hoo
Microuniversity
Oh, hoo
Microuniversity
Oh, hoo
Microuniversity
