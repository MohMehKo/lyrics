It's different for girls
They've got sensitive language
They've built miles of defenses
They're not numb by impression
It's different for girls
From when they are children
They're depersonalized
Aggressively objectified

They want to make a scene
They want to be adored
And then they want to be left alone
When they get bored
With that, it's different for girls
They are mercurial creatures
Not a masculine dissonance
Or sexual currency

Though some of them are demons, all of them are gods
Though some demons are women
For every one psycho bitch, there's 10,000 aggro pricks
It's different for girls

It's different for girls
They don't spit on the street
They don't piss on the seat
They don't have to size up
Every person they meet
Or create an elite
Or poison the game
So no one else can compete

They are chaos and mystery
And they like to combine them
Sometimes they act crazy
But that doesn't define them
It's different for girls
They're not expected to fight
They're expected to sit
And take some lesser man's shit

Though it don't feel right
No, it don't feel right

Though some women are demons, all of them are gods
Though some demons are women
For every one psycho chick, there's 10,000 hateful pricks
It's different
It's different
It's different

Yeah, it's different for girls
It's different for girls
