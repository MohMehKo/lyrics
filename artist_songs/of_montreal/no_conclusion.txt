Tonight I feel like I should just destroy myself
Tonight I feel like I should just explode myself
Myself

Tonight I feel like I should just destroy myself
Tonight I feel like I should just explode myself
Myself

There's someone calling my name
But there's nothing to respond
I lost so much in our collapse
Man, what little hope is gone

The voice said, "Don't worry friend
The darkness is just a suggestion
No, don't worry, kid
The darkness is just a suggestion
No, don't worry Kevin"

Tonight I feel like I should just destroy myself
Tonight I feel like I should just explode myself
Myself

There's someone calling my name
But there's nothing to respond
I lost so much in our collapse
Oh, what little hope is gone

The voice said, "Don't worry friend
This darkness is just a suggestion
No, don't worry, kid
This darkness is just a suggestion
No, don't worry kid"

Tonight I feel like I should just destroy myself
Tonight I feel like I should just explode myself
Myself

I'm allergic to the world when we're separated
There's nothing in my heart that's worth a beating
Feeling like a Styrofoam prop ennui is eating
Oh, sure, we talk and talk and talk
But nothing worth repeating

I feel defeated
I feel defeated
I feel defeated

Now I'm OD'ing on your cocksucker blues
You make me uptight when you just don't work right
You painted my prison, now something's wrong
And I never ever ever wanted to write this song

I'm killing myself but it's not suicide
I'm killing myself
I'm killing myself but it's not suicide
I'm killing myself but my friends will never know
Because I've never been
Because I've never been honest with anyone

Always pulling faces from the unprepossessing places
Of the universal mind
I'm crippled by the world when we are divided
There's nothing in my heart that's worth the creaking
Feeling like a Pamplona bull that's finished kicking
Although we try to break the loop, it's always stuck repeating

I feel defeated
I feel defeated
I feel defeated

Now I'm OD'ing on your cocksucker blues
You make me uptight when you just don't work right
You painted my prison, now something's wrong

And I never ever ever wanted to write this song
I always thought things would change somehow
And we would start getting along
But it's hopeless, hopeless

And I never ever ever wanted to write this song
I always thought things would change somehow
And we would start getting along
But it's hopeless, hopeless

And I never ever ever wanted to write this song
I always thought things would change somehow
And we would start getting along
But it's hopeless, hopeless
