The sacrifice must be for some unknwon deity, babe I just can't get hard for reality
At least not mine
Your love charity is like
an immortal bleeding beast and here
Is it to motivate my heart to function?
This age is a bitch that burns our dreams, so musn't you leave
Can only turn away
I wonder can I produce some of heat
to keep our experiment in our heart
I told you I could, I couldn't cope seeing the disappointment in your eyes

Do it

Oh Nina, how can I defend myself against this world
that batters me like a retarding cartoon?
It's too soon for salvation, but that word is just a joke

Oh Nina, my whole system is chaos
I'm desperate for something, but there's no human word for it
I should be happy, but
what I feel is corrupted, broken, impotent, and insane

Oh Nina, I've become so hateful
How am I ever going to survive this winter?
I can think of nothing but getting my revenge
Make those fuckers pay, but it's not gonna to happen and
It's eating a hole in me
Eating a hole in me
It's eating a hole
Eating a hole
Eating a hole in me

Little heart can see each suffering repeat
Our sole/soul concession
to find dimension

I've inherited spiritual sanctions for some old ancestral crime
It was committed long ago, but the punishment's absolved all down the family line
Everyone's so unstable, on my mother's side
And emotionally barren, on my father's side
But tell me how can I attempt to atone for somebody else's willful ignorance?
