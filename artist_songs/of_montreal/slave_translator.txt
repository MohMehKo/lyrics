All the little girls are boys for girls with no boys to throw up for
Slave translator,
Tell me what it means
Dante had two Prussians in her brush
Quite a rush

All the nimble boys are girls for boys with no girls to cum into
Slave translator
Soften my rage
All the boys she loves are always under age

Can't cut away from it
Self paralysis
Satanic ornaments that crumble our faith
Rebirth suicide
Rebirth suicide
It's so perpetual
Not that I care
They bring their plates like it's automatic
It's so pathetic
You apologize for him
You won't face the portrait
Honestly, you rotted when it mattered
Not that I care

I was only stabbing your heart because I was trying to get your attention
Change your direction

Can't tolerate this new vision
Paranoia like it's talking to your mother
All of the hatred
All of the vomit
It's recurrent
Not that I care

All the nimble girls are boys for girls with no boys to throw up for
Slave translator,
I hate to ask
Is the wind in that door still?

All the nimble boys are girls for boys with no girls to cum into
Slave translator,
I want you to hurt
I'm cutting myself, and I feel like dirt!
