I am a Kristiansand, they tried to fuck my mind
And enter a fit because they could not impregnate it
I am Kristiansand, they tried to fuck my mind
And then lost their shit because they could not castrate it

I don't want to go back with you suckers
While you try so hard to seem the same
You're not going to vanish if you step out of line
You screwed me down when I was younger
I didn't know that all along
Because you had it all wrong

I am a Kristiansand
They tried to fuck my mind
And then threw a fit because they could not impregnate it
I am a Kristiansand
They tried to fuck my mind
And then lost their shit because they could not castrate it

I don't want to grow slow with you suckers
Or play your game of fear of reflection
You're not going to vanish if you stand on your own
You told them that when I was younger, I didn't know that all along
It was you who had it all wrong (all wrong)
Yeah (yeah)

You stepped on all my books
You hurt me, can you hear me?
I am a Kristiansand
They tried to fuck my mind
And then threw a fit because they could not impregnate it
