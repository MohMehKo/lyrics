Winter isn't much here
Just a flinching centigrade
Though the grasses all look jaundiced
And the poplar branches flayed
Oh oh
The poplar branches flayed

Before your hysterical silence
You came rapping at my door
With your body as a sacrament
Your mind a killing floor
Oh oh
Your mind a killing floor

I've been trying to quell my anger
And not feel bitter about all the darkness you gave
But as long as there's that device
That I cannot disengage

Just as the Red Terror
You tried to kill what you couldnâ€™t reign
And now you're back in Knoxville
Masturbating your father's pain
Oh oh
Masturbating your father's pain

Stealing from his oration of filth
I repeat the wickedness to force reactions out of you
But it never hurts as deeply as I want it to

I think I'll mix of medicine and explore it 'till I'm dull
You made my sky a graveyard
And my moon a funeral
Oh oh
My moon a funeral
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh

Now it's just a system of subtraction
Oh yeah
I won't even turn around to notice your reaction
Now it's just a system of subtraction
Oh yeah
I won't even feel the hateful vibing of your faction
Now it's just a system of subtraction
Whatever happened to your star
Now no one cares who you are now
Oh oh oh oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

You were once beloved by my people
Now it's bad luck to even say your name

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

When I see you it feels so awkward
I try to be cool but it's such a drag

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

I waited for you on the O'Farrell Street
Smelling other people's piss

I bet you think you see me backwards, babe
You ain't even seen the Blikk Fang, babe
It's not acrimonious
Now it's only systems of subtraction
Oh yeah
I won't even turn around to look at your reaction
Now it's just a system of subtraction
Whatever happened to your star
Now no one cares who you are
You used to share my broken throne
Now you sing flat alone
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
