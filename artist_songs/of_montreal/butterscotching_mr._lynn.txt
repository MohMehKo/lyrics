I like you cause you look like a giraffe stretching out it's neck to get to
fruit in a tall tree. You're always occupied with girly things your room is
filled with girly posters of teen idols and roller coasters and funny things
like that you've got a red and purple striped stuffed animal cat that takes up
half the bed. I like to pretend you're made out of a-
drawbridge operator's favorite radio program "argh, you're listening to 81.3 sound of the sea" while I'm training troops in parachutes how to act froufrou so when their seargents return from butterscotching Mr. Lynn they can do the charlston while I paint the face of Private Fontaine on his enemies face and do the same to him until the ballrooms filled with soldiers wondering if they like them selves and all are forced to forgive and forget
