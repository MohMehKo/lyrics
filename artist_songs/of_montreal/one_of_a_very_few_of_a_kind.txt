Your hair is so dark, it's curls are dancing flames of black fire
Allah created you just for us to admire

I doubt that you're the only one like you that I'll find
But for sure you're one of a very few of a kind, Yes you are

Your eyes are so clear, the seem to speak to me from a gleeful world
And they look link singing moons made of black pearl.

I'm not saying that you're the only one like you that I'll find

But for sure you're one of a very few of a kind, Yes you are

You're as stunning as a tidal wave of wisteria
Just a smile from you has sent gents into histeria

I doubt that you're the only one like you that I'll find
But for sure you're one of a very few of a kind

One of a very few of a kind
