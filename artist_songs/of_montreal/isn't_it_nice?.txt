Isn't it nice living out in the country?
It's so nice for us to have a place
off in our own space with no one to mind

there's Old Cranky the elderly lady next door
who accuses us of burning down her barn
it's so different out here

with Old Cranky's bales of hay

there's Larry our alcoholic neighbor at ten a.m.
asking for a ride to the liquor store
it's so different out here
one thing I've learned is that
you never buy Larry beer
or else he'll bug you everyday

it's a long and winding road to our house
so if you come to see us take it slow
take it slow anyway when you come
you will know why we stay so far
from the city lights
we don't miss a thing from the city

come take a walk at night it's so quiet
you should try it

looking menacing while landscaping the lawn

it's a long and winding road to our house
so if you come to see us take it slow
