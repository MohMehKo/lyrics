You like to think that you can
Live beyond good and evil
Amputated from humanity
On some lifelong intellectual retreat

Everything is conceptual and
All is rhetorical
You can feel so powerful

When you're forced to face the physical world
You scurry like an insect

There is a virus in your tenets
Don't be naive, you know it's true
And if you don't protect yourself
Obsidian currents
Will devour you

You have committed yourself
Wholly to the dominion of semantics and ideas
All things cerebral and abstract
No patience for impractical emotions

Burning everyone who
Ever tried to get close to you
But you're so lizard-like you don't
Feel any passion for anything but yourself

There is a virus in your tenets
Don't be naive, you know it's true
And if you don't protect yourself
Obsidian currents
Will devour you
