The cats are crying at the screen door
the neighbors are revving up their cars
the world is just exploding now with people
and all of their noises are just drowning out-
the cat's still crying at the screen door

I was just a hiccup in the rain
then you struck me with your cane
you made it your life's work to end up a stain

the cats are crying at the screen door
the neighbors blast speeches from stereos
the world is simply flooded now with people
and all of their noises are drowning out-
the cat's still crying at the screen door
clawing at the screen door

I was just a hiccup in the rain
then you struck me with your cane
you made it your life's work to end up a stain
