[Cher Lloyd]
I'm the kind... I'm the...
I'm the kinda girl to put dub on the track

I'm a machine, couple screws loose but I'm running smoothly
Know what I mean, got an upgrade, now I'm more unruly
I'm hard to swallow but a spoonful of sugar
Might make it go down more easily
Pick up the beat, put your money on me
I'm not the queen, but I'm gonna be a princess on it
Like premium gasoline, my words gonna catch on fire,
Spread through your body like heat

I'm the kinda girl to put dub on the track
I'm the kinda girl to put dub on the track
I'm the kinda girl to put dub on the track
I'm the kinda girl to put dub on the track
I'm the kinda girl to put dub on the track

Supersonic (OK)
Iconic (OK)
Astronomic (OK)
Get me on it (OK)
Electronic (OK)
Polyphonic
Get me on it
I'm the kinda girl to put dub on the track


I'm the type of man who puts the truth on the track
The future of rap, Righteous!
You ain't gonna ask who's that
D-d-d-do you know that already
Are you mad?
Gotta track, got X Factor prepared for the next chapter
I'm back with a bag full of gifts like Santa
But we don't care if you're naughty or nice
Yo Cher I bet you talk to them liars

Laugh in the hater's face, save your praises!
We ain't got time for that, ain't got patience
[?]
You can't switch your station,
I can't say artist â€” just hit the A-list,
Can't touch this 'cause I'm in a spaceship
I'm into raving, one thing I'll say is;
Yeah, I'm about to put dub on the track

I'm the kinda girl to put dub on the track
I'm the kinda girl to put dub on the track
I'm the kinda girl to put dub on the track
I'm the kinda girl to put dub on the track

Work hard! Party harder!
Work hard! Party harder!
Work hard! Party harder!
Work hard! Party harder!

[Dot Rotten:]
I'm a psycho, no Simon,
I'm fly with no co-pilot
Oh so grimeish, gimme the beat I'm so violent
The way I got the rhythm and beat there's no finding anything like this,
Come on Joes shining
And they all watching me like they got no eyelids
Kid in 'em like whatever it is,
Are you ever gonna quit then you never live with this, I'm cold
Got MC's that have been in the game
For 10 years depressed and stressed thinking I'm old
I'm a deep guy and highly streetwise
I always speak life just how it is I roll
Nothing but slugs on the track
Politics and cars ain't drugs on the track
It's not you know how I does on the track it's,
It's certified with the dub on the track

I'm the kinda girl to put dub on the track
I'm the kinda girl to put dub on the track
I'm the kinda girl to put dub on the track
I'm the kinda girl to put dub on the track

Supersonic (OK)
Iconic (OK)
Astronomic (OK)
Get me on it (OK)
Electronic (OK)
Polyphonic
Get me on it
I'm the kinda girl to put dub on the track

Work hard! Party harder!
Work hard! Party harder!
Work hard! Party harder!
Work hard! Party harder!

[Ghetts:]
I swear, whoever came up with this idea, genius!
It's quite clear, I mean this
Besides Cher, I might give it the wood like IKEA
Imma relax like the wife's here, no
Imma relax like my wife's here
Let me get back to the music
These MC's ain't need criteria
That's why I'm here lighting it up like Time's Square
Lighting it up like mind flares
Everyone gon' talk about wavy
Where they when the tides near?
Yeah I lost the buzz but it's back
'Cause I'll be the type to put dub on the track

I'm the kinda girl to put dub on the track
I'm the kinda girl to put dub on the track
I'm the kinda girl to put dub on the track
I'm the kinda girl to put dub on the track
