Phone rings
Don't wanna pick it up
I'm so scared
I'm gonna say too much
I tip toe around your questions
Why you gotta dig so deep?

Tears fall
And the glasses break
Inside these walls
The floor boards shake
But from outside
It's alright
Long as you looking from fifty feet

I been trying trying
Hold my head up high
I been lying lying
Keeping it all inside
Trying not to trust you, yeah
Take another leaf, I'm a book yeah yeah?

I'm done, I give up
I don't wanna pretend no more
That's it, so what?
I've lost a friend before
Gonna say it like it is
No more wondering "What if?"
That ain't the way you oughta live
Cause I don't want you to love me
If you don't wanna love me for me

Cause I don't want you to love me
If you don't wanna love me for me

A doll house is all that you could see
But it's so far from my reality
I got problems, I got issues
Sometimes it's all too much for me
Wrap it up with a pretty little bow
But there are some things you can't sugarcoat
So I give it to you anyway
Even though it won't taste so sweet

I been trying trying
Hold my head up high
I been lying lying
Keeping it all inside
Maybe I could trust you, yeah
Take another leaf, I'm a book yeah yeah?

I'm done, I give up
I don't wanna pretend no more
That's it, so what? So what?
I've lost a friend before
Gonna say it like it is (I'm gonna say it like it is)
No more wondering "What if?"
That ain't the way you oughta live
Cause I don't want you to love me
If you don't wanna love me for me

Sick of all the fighting
All the slamming of the doors
The pain, the parents, too deep to ignore
Step back, step back
Can you see it through my eyes?
I know, I know
It may be a surprise
Don't wanna be perceived for something that I'm not
Just wanna be accepted for the little that I got
If you could see me now in my glass house
Not ready to let you in
Oh, yeah yeah.
Not ready to let you in

I'm done, I give up
I don't wanna pretend no more
That's it, so what?
I've lost a friend before
Gonna say it like it is
No more wondering "What if?"
That ain't the way you oughta live
Cause I don't want you to love me
If you don't wanna love me for me

Cause I don't want you to love me
If you don't wanna love me for me

Cause I don't want you to love me
If you don't wanna love me for me
