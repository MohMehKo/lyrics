This is for the mama saving up for sneakers
Like my mama did even if it killed her
Oh-oh, woah-oh
Oh-oh, woah-oh
Even when BG killed the power
We were sing and dance in the dark for hours
Oh-oh, woah-oh
Oh-oh, woah-oh

When I'm down on my luck
Spent my last 20 bucks
She paints the picture
She paints the picture
When there's no giving up
Have to scrape off the brush
She paints the picture, oh-oh

Race the mind
A piece of jewels
And tell the truth 'cause sneaker kids don't quit
Sneaker kids don't quit, oh-oh
Race the stand on solid ground
And when you're down you gotta go for them
'Cause sneaker kids don't quit
Oh-oh, woah-oh
Sneaker kids don't quit
Woah-oh
Woah-oh
Sneaker kids don't quit
Woah-oh

This is for the girl standing at the school gate
Wishing that she had your life for one day
Oh-oh, woah-oh
Oh-oh, woah-oh
She doesn't have a dress to be your prom date
Look in her eyes you can hear her heartbreak
Oh-oh, woah-oh
Oh-oh, woah-oh

When I'm down on my luck
Spent my last 20 bucks
She paints the picture
She paints the picture
When there's no giving up
Have to scrape off the brush
She paints the picture, oh-oh

Race the mind
A piece of jewels
And tell the truth 'cause sneaker kids don't quit
Sneaker kids don't quit, oh-oh
Race the stand on solid ground
And when you're down you gotta go for them
'Cause sneaker kids don't quit
Oh-oh, woah-oh
Sneaker kids don't quit
Woah-oh
Woah-oh
Sneaker kids don't quit
Woah-oh
