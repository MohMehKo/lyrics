You put a gun to my head
I didn't know what was happening
You had me climbing the walls
I could taste the adrenaline

You said the world was at war
And we'd fight them all 
And only time will tell
If you don't whether the storm
You'll get caught up in the wind

If love is a war
Then I'll be your soldier
And if I fall
You'll be my saviour
You'll be my saviour
You'll be my saviour

I'm holding on
You're holding on
You make it hard to breath
I'll carry you
You'll carry me
Your love is bittersweet
It's bittersweet
It's bittersweet
Your love is bittersweet
I'm holding on
You're holding on
Your love is bittersweet

You look me deep in the eyes
I can feel my heart racing now
It's like you can read my mind
When I struggle to scream it out
Knock me down to the floor
But I still want more
And only time will tell
You brought me back to life
But only to kill me now

If love is a war
Then I'll be your soldier
And if I fall
You'll be my saviour
You'll be my saviour
You'll be my saviour

I'm holding on
You're holding on
You make it hard to breath
I'll carry you
You'll carry me
Your love is bittersweet
It's bittersweet
It's bittersweet
Your love is bittersweet
I'm holding on
You're holding on
