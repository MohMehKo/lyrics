Say it to me
Where are you? Say it to me
Wanna say it to me
When I'm coming up empty

I see you turning all my calls back
Bandana bold like a whack
Popping wheelies and spaghetti [?]
Kinda like you
Just come on and we can get it popping
Popping, popping, popping
I see you turning all my calls back
Bandana bold like a whack
Popping wheelies and spaghetti [?]
Kinda like you
Just come on and we can get it popping
Popping, popping, popping

I feel like, feel like you been watching me
I feel like, feel like you been stalking me
I feel like, feel like you been watching me
I feel like, feel like you been stalking me
Like you got a bounty, bounty out on me
Like you got a bounty, bounty out on me
Got a bounty, bounty out on me
Like you got a bounty, bounty out on me

I see your [?] sheets all over me
Poured up with wet dreams 'til I felt it
In the deep of the night, I felt so cold
I thought the cops gon' tryna soak me
Can't leave with my baby
I see your [?] sheets all over me
Poured up with wet dreams 'til I felt it
In the deep of the night, I felt so cold
I thought the cops gon' tryna soak me
Can't leave with my baby

I see you turning all my calls back
Bandana bold like a whack
Popping wheelies and spaghetti [?]
Kinda like you
Just come on and we can get it popping
Popping, popping, popping
I see you turning all my calls back
Bandana bold like a whack
Popping wheelies and spaghetti [?]
Kinda like you
Just come on and we can get it popping
Popping, popping, popping

I feel like, feel like you been watching me
I feel like, feel like you been stalking me
I feel like, feel like you been watching me
I feel like, feel like you been stalking me
I feel like, feel like you been watching me
I feel like, feel like you been stalking me
I feel like, feel like you been watching me
I feel like, feel like you been stalking me
Like you got a bounty, bounty out on me
Like you got a bounty, bounty out on me
Got a bounty, bounty out on me
Like you got a bounty, bounty out on me
