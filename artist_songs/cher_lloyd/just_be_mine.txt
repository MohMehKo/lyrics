Yeah, yeah, okay...

You say I don't treat you right
I say that you're too uptight
Then we have a stupid fight
I don't mean to hurt you but I do

Break up and I take you back
Make you have a heart attack
Boom boom, it's a heart attack
I don't mean to hurt you but I do

Be my buttercup, be my star
Beat it like a drum, beat it hard
Even though I'm out in the night
Even though I'm wrong, just be mine

Be my lover boy, be my spark
Be my fire boy in the dark
Even though I'm out in the night
Even though I'm wrong, just be mine, boy
Just be mine, just be mine
Just be mine, just be mine, boy
I want you like...

Uh uh uh uh ah ah ah ah...

Sometimes, I'm a crazy chick
Do things that'll make you sick
But I get away with it
I don't mean to hurt you but I do

You say that I make you wait
That's true 'cause I make you wait
Just one of the things you hate
I don't mean to hurt you but I do

Be my buttercup, be my star
Beat it like a drum, beat it hard
Even though I'm out in the night
Even though I'm wrong, just be mine

Be my lover boy, be my spark
Be my fire boy in the dark
Even though I'm out in the night
Even though I'm wrong, just be mine, boy
Just be mine, just be mine
Just be mine, just be mine, boy
I want you like...

Uh uh uh uh ah ah ah ah...

I always mess up (I'm sorry)
Really mean it now (I'm sorry)
Just can't help myself (So naughty)
Uh uh uh, so naughty

I always mess up (I'm sorry)
I really mean it now (I'm sorry)
I just can't help myself (So naughty)
Uh uh uh, so naughty

Uh uh uh uh ah ah ah ah

Just be mine, whoa oh
I want you like
Oh
I want you like
Oh
