What if daddy was right?
What if there's no forever?
Would you kiss me goodnight?
So that I could remember?

Keep you frozen in time
Like they do in the pictures
And if I close my eyes,
Would I still think of patience?

Stay with me, don't disappear
To tell the truth, I need you here
I'm afraid, can barely breathe
I need your words to comfort me
Say goodnight, would you say goodnight?

What if daddy was right?
And I knew all the answers?
they could give me the world
But that wouldn't matter
if the gates open wide, and made you an angel
Through tears in my eyes, I'd save your seat at the table

[2x]
Stay with me, don't disappear
To tell the truth, I need you here
I'm afraid, can barely breathe
I need your words to comfort me
Say goodnight, would you say goodnight?
