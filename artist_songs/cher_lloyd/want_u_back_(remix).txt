Uh!
Mmm, yeah
Lalalalalaaa (haha)
Uh!

Uh! Hey, boy you never had much game
Thought I needed to upgrade
So I went and walked away - ay - ay (Uh!)
Now, I see you've been hanging out
With that other girl in town
Looking like a pair of clowns - owns -owns
Uh!

Remember all the things that you and I did first?
And now you doing them with her
Remember all the things that you and I did first?
You got me, got me like this (UH!)
And now your taking her to every restaurant?
And everywhere we went, COME ON!
And now your taking her to every restaurant?
You got me, got me like this

Boy, you can say anything you wanna
I don't give a shit, no one else can have you
I want you back, I want you back, want want you, want you back
I'd broken up thinking you'd be crying
Now I feel like shit looking at you flying
I want you back, I want you back, want want you, want you back

Please this ain't even jealousy, she ain't got a thing on me
Tryin' rock them ugly, jeans jeans jeans
You, clearly didn't think this through,
If what I've been told is true
You'd be crawling back like, boo, whoo, whoo

Remember all the things that you and I did first?
And now you doing them with her
Remember all the things that you and I did first?
You got me, got me like this (UH!)
And now your taking her to every restaurant?
And everywhere we went, COME ON!
And now your taking her to every restaurant?
You got me, got me like this

Boy, you can say anything you wanna
I don't give a shit, no one else can have you
I want you back, I want you back, want want you, want you back
I'd broken up thinking you'd be crying
Now I feel like shit looking at you flying
I want you back, I want you back, want want you, want you back

Ooooooh, ooooooh ohh
I thought you'd still be mine
When I kissed you goodbye, uh-oh UH-OH
Ooooooh, ooooooh ohh
And you might be with her
But I still had you first
Uh-oh UH-OH

[Snopp Dogg:]
I was tryin to do what you said
I flew to the UK
But you said my game was fake like a toothpick
So I had to make some changes, rearrangements
I was living so wild and dangerous
Staying on a goal with a house full of strangers
I need to get you back, cause you know how my thang is
You know you had me first, so for better or worse
I could bubble your purse
Trouble and we up in reverse, yeah
I know that this is the truth
But you'll never find another like Snopp
So deal with it
You need me, I want you
Now I'm being real wit it
Sing to me, c'mon

[Cher Lloyd (Snoop Dogg):]
Boy, you can say anything you wanna
I don't give a shit, no one else can have you
I want you back, I want you back, want want you, want you back (wut, wut, wut)
I'd broken up thinking you'd be crying
Now I feel like shit looking at you flying (ha ha)
I want you back, I want you back, want want you, want you back
