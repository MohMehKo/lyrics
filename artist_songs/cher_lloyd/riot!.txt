'Cause we come alive!

[Verse 1:]
Trendsetters, come get us
Never grow up cause immature’s better
Just let us, please let up
I got my water gun and you’re gonna get wetter

Boom ba doom boom boom boom
Screwin’ up cause it’s cool
We love it, so don’t judge it
In my shirt pocket I was keeping one hundred

[Pre-Chorus:]
Let’s live off the wall, the wall, the wall, the wall
Stand up 'til we fall, if we break we take it all

[Chorus:]
Cause we run, run for our lives
Run for tomorrow, run for tonight
Cause we run, run 'til we die
No point in livin’ if we ain’t livin’ life
So riot! Riot! Everybody stand up
For the riot! Riot!
Put your fucking hands up
Cause we come alive tonight, tonight

(Cause we come alive)

[Verse 2:]
We on it, most wanted
Gotcha lookin’ round for our finger prints on it
No comment, just be honest
New world aw, they can’t eff with our shhh

Boom ba doom boom boom boom
Don’t make us come for you
Rough riders, dun da da
If you don’t give a what, put ‘em up don’t knock us

[Pre-Chorus:]
Let’s live off the wall, the wall, the wall, the wall
Stand up 'til we fall, if we break we take it all

[Chorus:]
Cause we run, run for our lives
Run for tomorrow, run for tonight
Cause we run, run 'til we die
No point in livin’ if we ain’t livin’ life
So riot! Riot! Everybody stand up
For the riot! Riot!
Put your fucking hands up
Cause we come alive tonight, tonight
(Cause we come alive)

[Bridge:]
If you think we’ve all gone crazy, how’d you guess?
Gonna tear the world apart until there’s nothing left
Let me see your red cups
(put ‘em up! Put em up!)
If you ever f’ed up
(so what? Put ‘em up!)
'Til we in cuffs
(‘Cause we never shuttin’ up!)

(We run)

[overtune]

[Chorus:]
We run, run for our lives
Run for tomorrow, run for tonight
Cause we run, run 'til we die
No point in livin’ if we ain’t livin’ life
So riot! Riot! Everybody stand up
It’s the riot! Riot!
Put your fucking hands up
Cause we come alive tonight, tonight
Cause we come alive tonight
