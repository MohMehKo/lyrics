Where the best friends sing
And the forces leak
In beautiful harmony
See the girls in heels
Longing to reveal their new choreography

I'll meet you there darling
Where the neon lights and we shine
Would you be mine?
Where the song of our dreams
Is a motel symphony

I'm hell bent
Helpless under your love
This affection
The chemical to dream of
Will you take me baby
To your sanctuary
On your own to fill my cup

Where the best friends sing
And the forces leak
In beautiful harmony
See the girls in heels
Longing to reveal their new choreography

I'll meet you there darling
Where the neon lights and we shine
Would you be mine?
Where the song of our dreams
Is a motel symphony

Lights are broken
The wallpapers too thin
But we've chosen this place to find our heavenly
Devotion, no we don't need
No we don't need, no instruments

Will you take me baby
To your sanctuary
On your own to fill my cup
Will you take me baby
To your sanctuary
It will never be enough

Where the best friends sing
And the forces leak
In beautiful harmony
See the girls in heels
Longing to reveal their new choreography

I'll meet you there darling
Where the neon lights and we shine
Would you be mine?
Where the song of our dreams
Is a motel symphony
