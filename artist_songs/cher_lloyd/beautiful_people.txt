[Verse 1:]
It's my last big breath what you want me to do?
When you act all cool like you already knew
That I'll be stuck here cold just waiting it through
'Til your heart starts beating for that somebody new
You know that it's true

[Chorus:]
'Cause it's beautiful people like you
Who get whatever they want
And it's beautiful people like you
Who suck the life right outta my heart
And it's beautiful people like you
Who make me cry
'Cause nobody else could be nearly as cruel as you

[Verse 2:]
It's a wicked game that you're making me play
Where I crawl back home as you're walking away
And it's all quite clear what you want me to say
But you'll be so long gone if I ask you to stay
You know that it's true

[Chorus:]
'Cause it's beautiful people like you
Who get whatever they want
And it's beautiful people like you
Who suck the life right outta my heart
And it's beautiful people like you
Who make me cry
'Cause nobody else could be nearly as cruel as you

[Bridge:]
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

[Verse 3:]
It's my last big breath what you want me to do?
When you act all cool like you already knew

[Chorus:]
'Cause it's beautiful people like you
Who get whatever they want
And it's beautiful people like you
Who suck the life right outta my heart
And it's beautiful people like you
Who make me cry
'Cause nobody else could be nearly as cruel as you
Nobody else could be nearly as cruel as you
As you
