Lonely, lonely
So you think that you know me
You’re the only one who knows who I am
I decided tonight that I’m breaking
All the chains on my throne of perfection
Could it be that easy to let it all go

Everything you see that glitters
Isn’t always gold
Everything you think is perfect, oh
Isn’t always so
Many times many times I would've let my feelings show
Everything you see that glitters
Isn’t always gold
You know I’m just human, human, human after all
You know I’m just human, human, human after all

Slowly, slowly
I’m okay in revealing
Scars you see I wear them proud in the end
I decided tonight that I’m wasting
Too much thought on the art of perception
Could it be that easy to let it all go

Everything you see that glitters
Isn’t always gold
Everything you think is perfect, oh
Isn’t always so
Many times many times I would've let my feelings show
Everything you see that glitters
Isn’t always gold

You know I’m just tired of the weight of the world on my shoulders
Babe, you know I’m sick of always carrying it for you
Used to be a superwoman now that’s over, over
I’m a lover, I’m a lover, baby, I’m a soldier
Doesn’t mean that I could be everything for you
Used to be a superwoman now that’s over, over

Everything you see that glitters
Isn’t always gold
Everything you think is perfect, oh
Isn’t always so
Many times many times I would've let my feelings show
Everything you see that glitters
Isn’t always gold
You know I’m just human, human, human after all
You know I’m just human, human, human after all

You know I’m just human, human, human after all
You know I’m just human, human, human after all
