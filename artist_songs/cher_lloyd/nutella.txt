I got that good, good, yummy, yummy, yum
One lick, never quite enough
So good when I give you some
I got that good, good, yummy, yummy
Good, good, yummy

(I got you strong)
When you take a bite
Good in the morning and good at night
(I'm on your tongue)
The feel, your appetite
You want it, you want it, I know

I got that good, good, yummy, yummy, yum
