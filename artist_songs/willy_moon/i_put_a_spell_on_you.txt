I put a spell on you
Because you're mine yeah
Stop the things that you do
I ain't lying

No no baby I can't stand
No running around
And baby you know I can't stand
No putting me down

I put a spell on you
And you know why

Because you're mine
Yes you're mine, you're mine

Stop the things that you do baby
I ain't lying

No no baby I put a spell on you
And you know why

Because you're mine
Yes you're mine, you're mine
