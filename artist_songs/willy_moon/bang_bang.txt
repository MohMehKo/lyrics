I was five and she was six
We rode on horses made of sticks
She wore black and I wore white
She would always win the fight

Bang bang, I shot her down
Bang bang, she hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, I shot my baby down.

Seasons came and changed the time
But still that day played on my mind
In my dreams she'd laugh and say
"Remember when we used to play?"

Bang bang, you shot me down
Bang bang, I hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, my baby shot me down

Now she's gone, I don't know why
And 'til this day, sometimes I cry
We didn't even say goodbye
I held her when she closed her eyes

Bang bang, I shot her down
Bang bang, she hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, I shot my baby down.
