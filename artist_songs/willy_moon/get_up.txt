Well I was born one morning in the month of May
Where the sun don't shine and the good don't stray
Yeah there was blood on the streets every single day
Alright
Because the crime comes cheap when the bills don't pay uh

Ha, let me tell you

Well I grew up quick and I grew up mean
Yeah my beats got hard and my wits got keen
I met a man on the corner where the blind men see
And these are the words that he said to me now

He said you got to get up on your feet to get what you need
You got to get up on your feet to get what you need
Oh tell 'em
(I don't need salvation brother, I got time on my side)
Get up on your feet to get what you need
(I don't need salvation brother, I got time on my side)
Get up on your feet, get up now

Well Lord I know that I been bad
But I done my best with the luck I had, yeah
And if I learned one thing I realised
That in this life you got to put up a fight, yeah

You got to get up on your feet to get what you need
You got to get up on your feet to get what you need
(I don't need salvation brother, I got time on my side)
Get up on your feet to get what you need
(I don't need salvation brother, I got time on my side)
Get up on your feet, get up now

Yeah, you got to get up on your feet to get what you need
You got to get up on your feet to get what you need
(I don't need salvation brother, I got time on my side)
Get up on your feet to get what you need
(I don't need salvation brother, I got time on my side)
Get up on your feet to get what you need
