Oh when you touch my hand and talk sweet talk
I got a knocking in my knees and a wobble in my walk
And I'm trembling
Yeah I'm shaking

Oh when you take me in your arms to talk romance
Uh huh my heart starts doing a Saint Vitus dance
And I'm panting
And I'm shaking

Well early in the morning time yeah
Lately in the middle of the night yeah
Whenever this chill comes over me
I wanna hug you with all of my might
Yeah 'cause I'm sweating
And I'm shaking

A chill and a fever so I've been told
It makes your head spin around and your feet run cold
I got fever
And I'm shaking

I feel like I've been run through the mill
I can't move around and I can't stand still
I'm so jittery
And I'm shaking

Well Samson was a mighty good man yeah
Strongest in his day
Oh then along came Delilah and clipped his wig
And it looks like you took me the same old way
So I'm noivous
And I'm shaking

Oh well a storm rocks a ship on a sea yeah
The wind shakes the leaves on a tree
I'm like noivous wreck
I'm all shook up
And that's what you do to me

Yeah 'cause I'm jumping
And I'm shaking
Baby I'm shaking
Yeah I'm shaking
