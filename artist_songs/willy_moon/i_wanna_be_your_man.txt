Baby girl it's plain to see
All of them things that you doing to me
While I got you oh so near
Them things you do just send me there

I wanna be your man

I wanna be your man

People try and put you down
Talk and jive all over town
I don't mind what the people say
Gonna talk and jives to any ole way

I wanna be your man

Give me loving and friendship too
You make me feel so brand new
That you're the baby
Just me and you up at your house we're going again

I wanna be your man
Ha Ha

Hit me now

All right

Well I don't mind if the sun don't shine
'Cause I give my loving in the evening time
Yeah and when the reaper comes around
Just stick me down in a hole in the ground all right

I wanna be your man
Ha Ha

I wanna be your man
Ha Ha
