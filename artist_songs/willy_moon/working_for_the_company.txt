When I was young my mother said
Someday son you're going to wind up dead
But it's five to nine, that while you're still alive
You'll wind up working nine 'til five

Well nine to five is eight 'til six
And getting by it ain't getting rich
They make you wait in line just to get your little fix
Working for the company

I'm working for the company

And 'til the day I die
Yeah I'll break my back and why
So old man jack can make a stack
And sit right back and drink his wine

I'm, I'm, I'm working for the company

Well the bills roll in and there ain't no doubt
You dug a hole and you can't get out
And it's enough to make you wanna scream and shout
Working for the company

And 'til the day I die
Yeah I'll break my back and why
So old man jack can make a stack
And sit right back and drink his wine

I'm, I'm, I'm working for the company

And 'til the day I die
Yeah I'll break my back and why
So old man jack can make a stack
And sit right back and drink his wine

I'm, I'm, I'm working for the company
I'm, I'm, I'm working for the company
