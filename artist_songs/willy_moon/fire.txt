Got a strange affliction, down in my soul
A permeating condition, I feel it in my bones
Got a new addiction, kind of a low
Write me out a prescription,
And let the feeling grow

Oh I tried, yeah I tried

To start a fire
A fire
A fire
Fire

Midas had a solution, that everything was gold
Dionysius forgived him, he made the river flow
Got a strange addiction, down in my soul
Got a kind of prediction, it'll never go

Oh I tried, yeah I tried

To start a fire
A fire
A fire
Fire

A fire
A fire
A fire
Fire
