I ain't gonna waste no more time
See that girl she's so fine
And I know that she's mine
'Cause she said loves me and
She said something to me
Just wait and see how it's gonna be
'Cause she said she loves me
She said she love me now
She really love me now

She's my baby and I think I love her too

She, she said something to me
Just wait and see how it's gonna be
'Cause she said she loves me
She said she love me now
She really love me now

She's my baby and I think I love her too

She said she love me now
She really love me now
Well she's my baby and I think I love her too
