Straight for your heart
Straight for your heart

I see you I see your soul clear
I know you wanna disappear 
You wonder who will notice
If you gave up the fight
Some days you feel invisible, out of sight
Right here, right now, tonight

I’m coming straight for your heart
I’m bringing light to the dark
It’s gonna catch like a flame
Everything’s about to change
All is takes is a spark
To bring hope where you are
Cuz you’re never too far
No you’re never too far
Coming straight for your heart
(Straight, straight, straight for your heart) [4x]
straight for your heart

Your heart beats
But it’s just keeping time
Your living but you don’t feel alive
The world outside is turning
While yours in laying still
In the cycle, spinning spiral, holding you until 
Right here, right now, tonight

I’m coming straight for your heart
I’m bringing light to the dark
It’s gonna catch like a flame
Everything's about to change
All is takes is a spark
To bring hope where you are
Cuz you’re never too far
No you’re never too far
I’m coming straight for your heart
(Straight, straight, straight for your heart) [4x]
straight for your heart

You don’t have to walk this road alone
I’ll hold you, hold you
You don’t have to live this life alone
I know you, know you

Hidden in the tunnel
I’ll be there
Even when you can’t fly
I’ll be there [3x]

I’m coming straight for your heart
(Straight, straight, straight for your heart) [4x]

I’m coming straight for your heart
I’m bringing light to the dark
It’s gonna catch like a flame
Everything's about to change
All is takes is a spark
To bring hope where you are
Cuz you’re never too far
No you’re never too far
I’m coming straight for your heart
(Straight, straight, straight for your heart) [4x]
straight for your heart

You don’t have to walk this road alone
I’ll hold you, hold you
You don’t have to live this life alone
I know you, know you
