Little girl terrified
She'd leave her room if only bruises would heal
A home is no place to hide
Her heart is breaking from the pain that she feels

[CHORUS]
Every day's the same
She fights to find her way
She hurts, she breaks, she hides, and tries to pray
She wonders why, does anyone ever hear her when she cries?

Today she's turning sixteen
Everyone's singing, but she can't seem to smile
They never get past arms length
How could they act like everything is alright?
Pulling down her long sleeves
To cover all the memories the scars leave
She says, "Maybe making me bleed
will be the answer that could wash the slate clean."

[CHORUS]

This is the dark before the dawn
The storm before the peace
Don't be afraid 'cause seasons change and
God is watching over you
He hears you

Every day's the same
She fights to find her way
She hurts, she breaks, she hides, and tries to pray
She'll be just fine, 'cause I know he hears her when she cries

Every day's the same
She fights to find her way
She hurts, she breaks, she hides, and tries to pray
She'll be just fine, 'cause I know he hears her when she cries
She'll be just fine, 'cause I know he hears her when she cries
