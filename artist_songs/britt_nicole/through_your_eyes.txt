Get it together
That's what I said to me
I put on the pressure
You could do better
Be who you supposed to be

But that's when you came in
Right when I needed you
Said all of the things that I was believing
Not one of them were true

You're lifting my head up
I was keeping my head down
I didn't know love
But I do now

Cause You stood right there
And then You broke apart the lies
You told me I had something beautiful inside
You brought to life the part of me I thought had died
Cause You stood right there until I saw me
I saw me through Your eyes (Saw me)
I saw me through Your eyes (Saw me)
I saw me through Your eyes

So this is living
This is free
Not keeping score
Not anymore
Not since you rescued me

You're lifting my head up
I was keeping my head down
I didn't know love
But I do now

Cause You stood right there
And then You broke apart the lies
You told me I had something beautiful inside
You brought to life the part of me I thought had died
Cause You stood right there until I saw me
I saw me through Your eyes (Saw me)
I saw me through Your eyes (Saw me)

You love me even when I fall apart
I can't explain it
That's just who you are
Don't want perfection
You just want my heart

Cause You stood right there (You stood right there!)
And then You broke apart the lies (Yeah!)
You told me I had something beautiful inside
You brought to life the part of me I thought had died
Cause You stood right there until I saw me
I saw me through Your eyes
I saw me through Your eyes
I saw me through Your eyes
I saw me through Your eyes
