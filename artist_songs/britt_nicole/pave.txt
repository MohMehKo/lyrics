I love when it's raining
The way it hits the pavement (do do do do)
And bounces onto your skin
Yeah I just wanna be it

Say you wanna get outta here
Somewhere where the skies are clear
I know just the place to go
If we never make it there
I don't care if you don't care
I just gotta let you know

If you wanna jump from the top of the waterfall
Climb up the mountain
Just to hear the call
Swinging through the jungle
Running for tomorrow
Anywhere you wanna go
I can pave the road

For you
For you
For you

So pack your bags, we're leaving (Let's go)
Close your eyes and breathe in
Tell me, can you see it? (I can see it now)
The place that we've been dreaming of

Say you wanna get outta here
Somewhere where the skies are clear
I know just the place to go
If we never make it there
I don't care if you don't care
I just gotta let you know

If you wanna jump from the top of the waterfall
Climb up the mountain
Just to hear the call
Swinging through the jungle
Running for tomorrow
Anywhere you wanna go
I can pave the road

For you
For you
For you
Yeah, I'll pave the road

Me and you baby
We can go wherever
I can pave the road

Yeah!
For you
Yeah!
For you
For you (Yeah, I'll pave the road!)
For you
For you
For you
Me and you, baby
We can go wherever you wanna
