Today, today you wanna run away now 
You break try to keep it together
 Love, love is all you need
You're a queen, but you've never known it 
'Cause life has come and left you blinded 
Stole your smile and left you cryin' 
It's not your fault, but shame is all you got now

Your heart is tangled up in silence 
It's time to let go and feel the light 
You'll find you're not alone
I know it's easier to hide
But you gotta let go
And feel the light
Let go and feel the light

Be brave, brave the waters all around you
I'll stay, I'll keep you from sinking down
 Love, love is on your side
You're stronger than you'll ever know
So many years of quiet
Building up like a fire inside
You're feelin' like you gotta let it out now
Just let it out

Your heart is tangled up in silence 
It's time to let go and feel the light 
You'll find you're not alone
I know it's easier to hide
But you gotta let go 
And feel the light 
Let go and feel the light

How did you get here
You're locked inside of all this fear
Inside you're crying out
Your mind's at war
Get out, get out and live for more
There's so much more
Live for more

Your heart is tangled up in silence
It's time to let go and feel the light
You'll find you're not alone
I know it's easier to hide
But you gotta let go
And feel the light
Let go and feel the light

Brave, brave waters all around you 
I'll stay, I'll keep you from sinking down
