I lay here under the stars in awe of who You are
You've never been so real
I'll never understand it fully
Lost here in Your beauty
No words could say how I feel

It's like I'm seeing for the first time
Like You opened my eyes to show me
Everything I've missed before
And I want more

I used to think we were worlds apart
But look, here You are
Let's stay here for awhile
Where heaven touches earth, my heart begins to turn
I've never felt so alive

It's like I'm seeing for the first time
Like You opened my eyes to show me
Everything I've missed before
And I want more

How many years did You plan this moment here
To show me how You love me
How many years did you plan this moment here
To show me how You love me

It's like I'm seeing for the first time
Like You opened my eyes to show me
Everything I've missed before
It's like I'm seeing for the first time
Like You opened my eyes to show me
Everything I've missed before
And I want more of You

I want more... I want more...
More More More More
