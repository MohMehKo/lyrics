It's a beau-beau-beautiful world we've been given
From the top of the sky to the ocean
I'll never understand it all
It must be supernatural

It's a ma-ma-magical thing a starry night
Feel-feel so small under a billion lights
I'll never understand it all
It must be supernatural

Amazing life
Amazing life
Amazing life
Amazing life

It's a colorful-colorful world painted so bright
Gonna walk on air, gonna take a flight
I'll never understand it all
It must be supernatural

I wanna drink-drink-drink every drop of sunshine
Got a smile on my face, I won't apologize
I'll never understand it all
It must be supernatural

Amazing life
Amazing life
Amazing life
Amazing life
