Hey there fear...
I've seen you here before
You keep coming back
And knocking at my door
For so long, so long
I've been trying to soar
With my hands tied up and my feet held to the floor

[Chorus:]
But I'm feeling' like a breakthrough is coming
I can see (that)
A breakthrough is coming, coming for me
Cause my heart, it was made to fly
Destiny can't be denied
I'm tired of waiting
I am overdue for a breakthrough

Oh, oh

You used to have me stumbling
Yeah, tripping again and again
But I've been studying you
And now I know you like the back of my hand
You can't keep me here
I've cried too many tears
Yeah, I've had enough
Now I'm gonna call you bluff
You made your bet, but the stage is set
Get ready cause I'm lighting the fuse

[Chorus:]
I'm feeling like a breakthrough is coming
I can see (that)
A breakthrough is coming, coming for me
Cause my heart, it was made to fly
Destiny can't be denied
I'm tired of waiting
I am overdue for a breakthrough

I can feel a breakthrough coming
I can feel a breakthrough coming
I can feel a breakthrough coming, coming
I can feel a breakthrough coming
I can feel a breakthrough coming
I can feel a breakthrough coming
I can feel a breakthrough coming

[Chorus:]
A breakthrough is coming
I can see that a breakthrough is coming, coming for me
Cause my heart, it was made to fly
Destiny can't be denied
I'm tired of waiting
I am overdue for a breakthrough
