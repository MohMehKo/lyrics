Hello my friend
I remember when you were
So alive with your wide eyes
'Til the light that you had in your heart was stolen
Now you say that it ain't worth staying
You wanna run but you're hesitating
I'm talking to me

Don't let your lights go down
Don't let your fire burn out
'Cause somewhere, somebody needs a reason to believe
Why don't you rise up now
Don't be afraid to stand out
That's how the lost get found
The lost get found

So when you get the chance
Are you gonna take it
There's a really big world at your fingertips
And you know you have the chance to change it
There's a girl on the streets she's cryin'
There's a man whose faith is dying
Love is calling you

Don't let your lights go down
Don't let your fire burn out
'Cause somewhere, somebody needs a reason to believe
Why don't you rise up now
Don't be afraid to stand out
That's how the lost get found
The lost get found

Why do we go with the flow
Why take the easier road
Why are we playing it safe
(No, I don't wanna play it safe)
Love came to show us the way
Love is a chance we should take
I'm moving out of the gray

Dada dada da da
Dada dada da da

Don't let your lights go down
Don't let your fire burn out
'Cause somewhere, somebody needs a reason to believe

(Stand out!)
Don't let your lights go down
Don't let your fire burn out
'Cause somewhere, somebody needs a reason to believe
Why don't you rise up now
Don't be afraid to stand out
That's how the lost get found
The lost get found

So when you get the chance
Are you gonna take it
There's a really big world at your fingertips
And you know you have the chance to change it
