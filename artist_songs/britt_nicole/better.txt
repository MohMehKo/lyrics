Hey, girl in the back of the classroom, afraid to stand out
So scared that you say the wrong thing so you don't make a sound
Paper planes in the sky,
Crashing one at a time
Praying that they don't land where you hide

Baby, I've been there
I've seen it all before
Baby, I was you
Hoping for something more
Baby, I promise
Cross my heart that in time it'll get better,
It'll get better

Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh
It'll get better
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh
It's gonna get better

Hey, girl in the back of the classroom,
Just be strong
Some days feel like forever
But it won't be long
Until you're sittin' on top of the world, baby, believe it
Like a paper plane in the sky, you'll fly, oh

I've been there
I've seen it all before
Baby, I was you
Hoping for something more
Baby, I promise
Cross my heart that in time it'll get better,
It's gonna get better

I know you're hurting inside
And you just wanna cry
I know you're hurting inside, inside, yeah
But tell all of the shadows "Goodbye"
Show 'em your bright side
I know, I know, yeah, oh
It's gonna get better, so long

'Cause, baby, I've been there
I've seen it all before
Baby, I was you
Hoping for something more
Baby, I promise
Cross my heart that in time it'll get better,
It's gonna get better, yeah

[2x]
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh
It'll get better
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh
It's gonna get better

Hey, girl in the back of the classroom,
Just be strong.
