I tried to cover my shine
I've tried staying in the lines
I, I, I don't wanna hide
No, not tonight

You, you, you want me to take my light, light
Fit it in your box, right?
I want you to look me in the eye, eye, eye, eye

Ready or not
Here, here, here, here I come
I'm about to show you where the light comes from
Oh, oh, oh ready or not
Here, here I come
This is who I am
I won't hide it
I'mma take it all over the world
To the young, to the old, every boy and girl
Ready or not
Here, here I come
I'mma show the world where the love is

I'm not ever selling out love
A love out loud is what it's all about
Giving everything to see the lost get found
Yeah, it's going down

You, you, you want me to take my light, light
Fit it in your box, right?
I want you to look me in the eye, eye, eye, eye

Ready or not
Here, here, here, here I come
I'm about to show you where the light comes from
Oh, oh, ready or not
Here, here I come
This is who I am
I won't hide it
I'mma take it all over the world
To the young, to the old, every boy and girl
Ready or not
Here, here I come
I'mma show the world where the love is

[LECRAE]
I refuse to keep this buried deep inside of me
Yeah this little light of mine, it's time to let it shine a bit
'Cause there's no point in hiding it
It's everything I am
The source of all my hope
And it's the reason why I stand
And I pledge allegiance to be somebody real
There's no more holding it back
I'm showing them how I feel 'cause love is more than a word
It's a noun, and a verb, and hiding it is absurd
Ya heard

Ready or not
Here, here, here, here I come
I'm about to show you where the light comes from
Oh, oh, ready or not
Here, here I come
This is who I am
I won't hide it
I'mma take it all over the world
To the young, to the old, every boy and girl
Ready or not
Here, here I come
I'mma show the world where the love is
