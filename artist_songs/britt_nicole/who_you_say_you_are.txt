Yeah, yeah.

[Verse 1:]
You know my name.
I know You wrote my story-y-y.
But there are days, I can't see a happy ending.
No, no.

Life get's hard.
Sometimes it just hurts.
It's kicking me down and throwing me curves.
When I feel the rain.
I won't be afraid.

[Chorus:]
'Cause I know, I know, I know You are Who You Say You Are.
Who You Say You Are.
You are the One still standin' when everything is fallin' apart.
Yeah, You got my heart.
I'll still be smilin' when the sky is dark.
'Cause I believe that You are Who You Say You Are.
You're Who You Say You Are.
Yeah, yeah.

[Verse 2:]
I've had control.
But I didn't know where, I was going.
Yeah, yeah.
I went down my road.
But my road just left me broken, yeah yeah.

I see it all now.
I don't know how.
But there's never been a time that You let me down.
Or walked away, so I'm not afraid.

[Chorus:]
'Cause I know, I know, I know You are Who You Say You Are.
Who You Say You Are.
You are the One still standin' when everything is fallin' apart.
Yeah, You got my heart.
I'll still be smilin' when the sky is dark.
'Cause I believe that You are Who You Say You Are.

[Bridge:]
Life's gonna knock me down.
It's not gonna keep me down.
I'm gonna trust You now, in every season.
I know You're here.
I know You're for me.
I know that joy comes in the morning.
God, I believe it now.
God, I believe You now.

You're Who You Say You Are.
When life knocks me down.
I won't stay down.
I'll get back up on my feet now.
You're more than a conqueror.

[Chorus:]
I know, I know, I know You are Who You Say You Are.
Who You Say You Are.
You are the One still standin' when everything is fallin' apart.
Yeah, You got my heart.
I'll still be smilin' when the sky is dark.
'Cause I believe that You are Who You Say You Are.

Who You Say You Are.
Who You Say You Are.
You're Who You Say You Are.
Who You Say You Are.
I know You are, Who You Say You Are.
Who You Say You Are.
You're Who You Say You Are.
