I knew a girl who always said she'd be a superstar
She had a mind that was runnin' wild
She loved the bright lights shined up in New York City
Such a pretty sight to see her smile
Knew what she wanted and couldn't put her finger on it
This small town girl will go for miles and miles

She bought bus tickets
Said, best you get your butt right on it
Said mary mary
I will stand by you

She said

Take me, but baby dont't hate me
When my dreams drive you crazy
You're spinning like mad on my mary go round
And round with no ending
Guess there's no point of pretending
We just can't get off this mary go round
(And round n' round, yeah mary goes round n' round n' round)

She hit the city with a suitcase full of magazines
So young and pretty, but so naive
Auditioned daily, worded the graveyard, she tired everything
I watched her struggle, it was hard to see
Knew what she wanted but couldn't put her finger on it
This mary goes round goes for miles and miles

I bought bus tickets
Said, we'd just get our butts back on it
Oh mary mary
What will you do?

[Chorus]

[Bridge]

Ba ba ba badda ba ba ba baddada bup bup ba da da badadadad dadaaa
It was not what she wanted
And finally put her finger on it
This small town girl will go for miles n miles

Save me baby don't hate me, know my dreams drove you crazy,
It's time we got of this mary go...

[Chorus Outro]

Tae me, but baby don't hate me
When my dreams dive you crazy
You're spinning like mad on my mary go round
And round with no ending
Guess there's no point pretending
We just can't get off this mary go round
And round n round, mary goes round n round n round
Ba ba ba bada ba ba ba badda...
Get off this mary go round
Get off this mary go round
