Seven days and I'm still sick
I need you more than I'll admit
I'm drowning here in a fifth of gin
Now I'm hoping for the best
But not holding my breath
Was there something that I missed
Some sort of clue maybe a hint
Cause there's a lack of love that's on you lips

And I can see your face in my mirror
Hear you voice in my ear
You're everywhere but here

Maybe Baby You're Too Pretty for me
Maybe Baby You're playing hide and go seek
I'm hoping for the best
Cause you're so hard to get
I'm not holding my breath
Cause you're too pretty for me

All the days the love we made
Tell me it wasn't all just fake
I need to know cause my hearts at stake
Now I'm hoping for the best
But not holding my breath

And I can see your face in my mirror
Hear you voice in my ear
You're everywhere but here

Maybe Baby You're Too Pretty for me
Maybe Baby You're playing hide and go seek
I'm hoping for the best
Cause you're so hard to get
I'm not holding my breath
Cause you're too pretty for me

Now you had me at hello
And then you let me go
Now everyday I wait
Is spent in second place

And I can see your face
Too pretty for me
Hear you voice
Too pretty for me

Maybe Baby You're Too Pretty for me
Maybe Baby You're playing hide and go seek
I'm hoping for the best
Cause you're so hard to get
I'm not holding my breath
Cause you're too pretty for me

I know you, I know you lie
Cause you're too pretty for me
