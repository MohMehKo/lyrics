I'm a fool
To think that I could be with you
To think that I was just that cool
Cool enough to be with you
Tell the truth
Has your heart been painted black and blue?
Is this the reason you're so cruel?
Cruel just comes so easy to you

I'm gonna run soon as my feet touch the ground
I'm gonna scream with everyone in the crowd
I'm gonna run 'n hide, in the city tonight
Like a runaway, just like a runaway

I'm confused
I heard that you found somebody new
And I heard what he's been doing to you
How's it feel to deal with someone like you?
I'll survive
Not by fighting fire with lies
Cool or not, there's something inside
Cuz inside is what keeps us alive, keeps us alive

I'm gonna run soon as my feet touch the ground
I'm gonna scream with everyone in the crowd
I'm gonna run 'n hide, in the city tonight
Like a runaway, just like a runaway

Something 'bout the city lights
Makes every wrong feel so right
And takes you to different heights
Cuz we know love's a long hard fight

I'm gonna run soon as my feet touch the ground
I'm gonna scream with everyone in the crowd
I'm gonna run 'n hide, in the city tonight
Like a runaway, just like a runaway

Like a runaway, yeah, just like a runaway
