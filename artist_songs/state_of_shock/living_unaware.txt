Does anyone care that life's unfair
Does anyone else have nightmares?
Cause I'm sick of living in despair
I'm sick of living so unaware

Maybe the world would be a better place
If the heavens would only take us away
Maybe the world would be a better place
If the heavens would only take us away

[Chorus:]
If time would only go away
(if time would)
We could all be the same
We could all erase our mistakes
(we could)
And never have to face
Disgrace again

I would never get to see the open road
I would never be able to grow
Cause I'm fine with living all alone
I'm fine with dying
Another unknown

Maybe the world would be a better place
If the heavens would only take us away
Maybe the world would be a better place
If the heavens would only take us away

[Chorus:]
If time would only go away
(if time would)
We could all be the same
We could all erase our mistakes
(we could)
And never have to face

Trying to find our way out
Trying to remember how
To tempted to make believe
To put them in to this disbelief

Does anyone care that life's unfair
Does anyone else have nightmares?
Cause I'm sick of living in despair
I'm fine with dying
I'm fine with dying
Another unknown

[Chorus:]
If time would only go away
(if time would)
We could all be the same
We could all erase our mistakes
(we could)
And never have to face

Maybe the world would be a better place
If the heavens would only take us away
Maybe the world would be a better place
If the heavens would only take us away
