I could hear it in her voice
Telling me to make the choice
Too many broken dates
Too many I'll be home lates

She says
I don't want to waste my life
Hating every god damn day away

When I sit back and open my eyes
I see we're living two separate lives
Like a well gone dry
From all the years gone by
It's hard to see through hearts that bleed
It's hard to see

Now she paints pictures of her dreams
But today they don't include me
Too many mistakes I've made
Too many times I've betrayed

She says
I don't want to waste my life
Hating every god damn day away

When I sit back and open my eyes
I see we're living two separate lives
Like a well gone dry from all the years gone by
When I Sit back and open my eyes
I see we're living two separate lives
Like we're trying to hide from the rollercoaster ride
It's hard to see
Through hearts that bleed
It's hard to see

Now I don't like living this way
It's not right second guessing our fate
If you want to say it's a wreck
I'll understand it's for the best

It's hard to see through hears that bleed
It's hard to see

When I sit back and open my eyes
I see we're living two separate lives
Like a well gone dry from all the years gone by
When I Sit back and open my eyes
I see we're living two separate lives
Like we're trying to hide from the rollercoaster ride
It's hard to see
Through hearts that bleed
It's hard to see
