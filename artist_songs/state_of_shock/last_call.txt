Would you notice me?
White t-shirt and jeans
Ain't no suit n tie
Does my blue collar shine?

That day on 7th street
When you bumped into me
Did you mean that line?
Give me a call sometime

I dial your number just to hang up the phone
Surprise, surprise there ain't nobody home
I guess I'm hanging on a moment

What if you could take a change on me?
What if you could see all I could be?
Then for once and all
Honey I could be your last call
What if you could take a change on me?
What if you could just make me believe?
Then for once, and for all
Honey I could be your last call

Now as people pass by
I tend to look twice
Is it your face that I see?
Or my mind just tricking' me
As I rewind in my mind
A brief moment in time
Guess you really got me
Cuz now I'm back on 7th street

I dial your number just to hang up the phone
Surprise, surprise, there ain't nobody there
I guess I'm hanging on a moment

[Chorus]

I'm hanging on a moment

Well am I ever gonna let that moment go?
Or am I always gonna hold a little hope?
I guess we'll never ever really get to know
I guess that's how this story's gonna have to go
Ooooh wo oh wo oh, how it goes

[Chorus]

When I wake up every morning
I'm still hanging on a moment

[Chorus Outro]
