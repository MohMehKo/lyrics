So what if I lost my mind
So what if this is goodbye
Who cares what they say
They never cared anyway

The world is a cage
We can never escape --and I scream
Day After Day, Day after Day 
My life is a page
I can never erase-- and I scream
So say what you say, say what you say --and I scream
I don't want to be
You don't want to be
I don't want to be me

This life that we made is fake
All they want to do is take
Look all around you
There's nothing you can do

The world is a cage
We can never escape --and I scream
Day After Day, Day after Day 
My life is a page
I can never erase-- and I scream

So say what you say, say what you say --and I scream
Cause I don't want to be
You don't want to be
I don't want to be me

There's no over thinking
When everything's sinking around you
Staring down the barrel
Of another empty bottle
I'd give it all back, give it al back
Just to feel real again

The world is a cage
We can never escape 
Day After Day, Day after Day 
My life is a page
I can never erase-- and I scream
So say what you say, say what you say --and I scream
Cause I don't want to be
You don't want to be
I don't want to be me
I don't want to be
You don't want to be
I don't want to be me
