Heartbreaks and mistakes
Go hand in hand like a story 'bout trouble
You wrote in my book for me
Page after page another line you'd feed me
You say you're sorry
But I'm so sick of that same old story

You broke my heart, you broke your word
What was I to do?

[Chorus:]
You used to be everything I needed
You were there when I was bleeding
But you took from me, the heartbeat that I need
You used to be everything I needed
But like a game of cards you cheated
And you took from me, the heartbeat that I need
What I guess I'll never know is how you ever just let me go,
You were all I need

They say time will tell
Time after time you shot us straight to hell
You took everything I gave
Over n' over, I learned a lesson in hate
You say you're so sorry
But I'm so sick of that same old story

You broke my heart, you broke your word
What was I to do?

[Chorus]

If you took the time, to turn around
You would've seen, that all along
I was standing here with arms wide open
But you left me broken
With the only words unspoken

You used to be everything I needed
You were there when I was bleeding
But you took from me.... What I needed

[Chorus]

What I guess I'll never know is how you ever just let me go,
You were all I needed
