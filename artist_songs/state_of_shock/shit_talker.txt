I thought we use to be friends
Now i know youre just a trend
And i just cant let it be
Knowing youre talking shit about me

[Chorus:]
You try to dis me
Straight up
Straight up
Straight up
You try to dis me
Straight up
Youre up, in my face

Im gonna bust you up
Youre gonna get fucked up

Gonna knock you down, down
Gonna fuck you up, up
Gonna knock you down, down
Im gonna fuck you up

You strike thin the lives you ruin
As in the lives that you spew
And I just cant let it be
Knowing youre talking shit about me

[Chorus:]
You try to dis me
Straight up
Straight up
Straight up
You try to dis me
Straight up
Youre up, in my face

Im gonna bust you up
Youre gonna get fucked up

Gonna knock you down, down
Gonna fuck you up, up
Gonna knock you down, down
Im gonna fuck you up

Gonna knock you down, down
Gonna fuck you up, up
Gonna knock you down, down
Im gonna fuck you up

I just, i just, i just cant get beat up
I just, i just, i just cant get beat up
I just, i just, i just cant, cant, get beat

Im gonna bust you up
Youre gonna get fucked up

Gonna knock you down, down
Gonna fuck you up, up
Gonna knock you down, down
We're gonna fuck you up

Gonna knock you down, down
Gonna fuck you up, up
Gonna knock you down, down
We're gonna fuck you up
