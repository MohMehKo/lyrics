Gone N Done N Did It, Ya gotta say,
Ya gotta say, Gone N' Done N' Did It,
Ya gotta say, Gone N' Done N' Did It

I've got a smoke in my pocket
But I ain't got a match
Stuck in my finger in a socket
Just to get off my ass
Shot a red bull N' vodka
Just to chase back the jack
Now I'm too drunk to drive
But I'm too dumb to crash

So now I'm diggin' threw the ashtray
Just to scrape up some cash
Met a man on the bus
But he was talkin' too fast
Driver said ya gotta go
Next stop is your last
Then he kicked me to the curb so I guess that's that

They say it gets old fast
But life was made for living
You only get one change
So take the one you're given
Get off your as
And live it to the limit
So you can say
You've Gone N' Done N' Did It [2x]

Laying on the lawn N' I lit up some grass
Like the lights of Las Vegas, Shit's spinning so fast
N' I'm fearing N' I'm loathing and I'm swinging at bats
Tried everything once
But I want more of that

[Chorus]

[Bridge/Solo]

Gotta say, Gone N' Done N' Did It
Gotta say, Gone N' Done N' Did It
Gotta say, Gone N' Done N' Did It
Gotta say, Gone N' Done N' Did It

[Chorus Outro]
