[Chorus:]
Cause it's a rock n' roll romance
Spotlight at the slow dance
This could be our last chance
For this rock n' roll romance

Every time I think of a moment
I wonder how we could've blown it
So close to living the lifelong dream
So far from what the world really sees
Maybe we just weren't ready yet
A day doesn't pass but I still don't regret
Looked so good at the starting line
But like all good things, they all take time

[Chorus]

So what did we miss along the way
Worked so hard just to fall from grace
Lived a life with no regrets
I guess that's why
It ain't over yet

[Chorus]

Cause it's a rock n' roll romance
Let's not let it be our last dance
So throw the spotlight on this chance
Cause it's a rock n' roll romance

Cause it's a rock n' roll romance
Sinking like a sunset
Rock n' roll romance
No but it ain't over yet
Rock n' roll romance
Livin' with no regrets
For this rock n' roll romance
No, but it ain't over yet

[Chorus x2]
