You like it better when we're wasted
Cause it's less complicated
But when the drugs are gone and faded
I look at your face and hate it.

I'm always falling...

The Stupid lives we fake
The stupid drugs we take
I'm begging you to see it
It's breaking you and me

I miss the days when we were sober
I know those days are over
And now I guess, we got, what we wanted
Forever these scars will haunt us

I'm always Falling...

The Stupid lives we fake
The stupid drugs we take
I'm begging you to see it
It's breaking you and me

From the time, you were mine
You got me so high, I guess that's why
That I just can't stop
Even when you're gone
The Stupid lives we fake
The stupid drugs we take...
I'm always Falling....

The Stupid lives we fake
The stupid drugs we take
I'm begging you to see it
It's breaking you and me
