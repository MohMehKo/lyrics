Innocent girl
Took a trip round the world
She needed
A change of scene
Cuz anywhere's better than
Than where she's been
Cuz boys they can be so mean

Even if it takes a little bit longer
A little pain will make you so much stronger
And even if it takes a little bit longer
To hear someone say

What if I told you everything
Wasn't anything without you?
Just know I live my life for you
And I'm here to hold onto
What if I told you everything
Wasn't anything without you?

From New York to Spain
Her life was about to change
Then she met a man
In the back on a taxi cab
He started to speak
He swept her right off her feet
He says

I'd like to now you just a little bit better
Find a feeling that just feels like forever
I'd like to love you like a lost love letter
So I can say

[Chorus]

You may lose your way
But don't lose your faith
To every innocent girl
All around the world
You may lose you way
But don't lose your faith
It's the same for every innocent girl
Around the world

[Chorus Outro]
