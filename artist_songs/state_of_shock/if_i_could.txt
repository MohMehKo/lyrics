Everytime that youre around, it cuts my throat
(takes my breath away)
Everytime that youre around, you bring me clouds
(breaks my heart now)
So hard to show

[Chorus:]
If i could say the words
The ones i know i should
If i could be the man
The one you understood
If i could say the words 
I want to wish you heard
Would you love, or would you hate me again?

Sometimes when im alone i hear your voice
(but youre not around)
Sometimes when im alone i wanna die
(do you feel it too?)
So hard to show

[Chorus]
If i could say the words
The ones i know i should
If i could be the man
The one you understood
If i could say the words 
I want to wish you heard
Would you love, or would you hate me again?

If i
If i

If i could say the words
The ones i know i should
If i could be the man
You understood

[Chorus:]
If i could say the words
The ones i know i should
If i could be the man
The one you understood
If i could say the words 
I want to wish you heard
Would you love, or would you hate me would you love, or would you hate me would you love, or would you hate me 
Again?
