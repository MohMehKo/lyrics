How do you tell someone 
So close to you 
Your holding me back 
From im meant to do 
The more you grow apart 
A piece of you knows 
If you try to stop me,i'll break your heart (i'll break your heart) 

I've seen the places others have gone 
Its time for me to move on 
I've seen the places others have gone 
Its time for me to move on 

[Chorus:]
Lifes A Rough Road If You Want To Roll With Me 
If You Want To Roll With Me 
Lifes A Rough Road If You Want To Roll With Me 
If You Want To Take A Ride 

Feels so close, its not here everyday 
And i never forgive you for taking that away 
So im going to that place even if its a mistake 
Dont you try and stop me i will break your heart 
(i'll break your heart) 

I've seen the places others have gone 
Its time for me to move on 

I've seen the places others have gone 
Its time for me to move on 

[Chorus:]
Lifes A Rough Road If You Want To Roll With Me 
If You Want To Roll With Me 
Lifes A Rough Road If You Want To Roll With Me 
If You Want To Take A Ride 
Some Gonna Stay When They Should've Gone West, Still Breathing My Dust 
Lifes A Rough Road If You Want To Roll With Me 
If You Want To Take A Ride 

How do you tell someone 
So close to you 
Your holding me back 

[Chorus:]
Lifes A Rough Road If You Want To Roll With Me 
If You Want To Roll With Me 
Lifes A Rough Road If You Want To Roll With Me 
If You Want To Take A Ride 
Some Gonna Stay When They Should've Gone West, Still Breathing My Dust 
Lifes A Rough Road If You Want To Roll With Me 
If You Want To Take A Ride
