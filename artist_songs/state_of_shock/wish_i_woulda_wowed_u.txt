My mistakes are
The empty promises
That I've made so far
I never wanted this

I wanted you, but felt like a fool
I don't blame you
I'd hate me too

I wish I woulda wowed you
I should have been so proud to
I coulda had one, but I had to have two
I was the king who had his queen
Until the day I threw it away

I guess that's it
The broken aftermath
Sure hurts when it hits
It's payment for my past

I wanted you but left like a fool
I don't blame you
I'd hate me too

[Chorus]

I wish somebody woulda told me that I had it all
My mistakes were
I wish somebody woulda told me that I had it all
My mistakes were
Hey hey

[Chorus Outro]

I wish somebody woulda told me that I had it all
