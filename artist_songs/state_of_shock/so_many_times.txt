Complications from your abuse
Have turned into disease
And you infect those around you
But you're too sick to see
I've given all that I can
It's gonna kill me to take you back

So many times
I've tried to help you
So many times
I've lied to save you
So clear it is for me to see
So many times
You've got the best of me

Suffocated by your needs
I try to find a cure
But immune to vaccines
Your destined for the streets

You slipped away Into a world
So far from me
And like a cloud caught in the wind
Don't know where it'll end
