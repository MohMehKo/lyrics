The story of success is just like all the rest again
So pump me full of pill and push me on the stage again
Oh oh I'm bandaged n I'm damaged n I'm broken down inside again
Be careful what you wish for
Cuz you just might get

We all wanna be so oh so famous
But we're only the way that god made us
So in the limelight, soak soak it up tonight
Cuz 15 minutes fades faster than the moonlight
So from us to you, this is our salute,
Everyone together now: Thank You!

I'm the centre of attention and I'm losin' all direction again
Woooh oh so outta control, falling, farther, faster again
be careful what you wish for
Cuz you might get it

[Chorus]

Here today, gone tomorrow
Nobody cares, there's no sorrow
Oh, You're chewed up, spit out
Ya fade away n burn out

Bup bup bup ba dup ba da dup ba da dup

[Chorus]
