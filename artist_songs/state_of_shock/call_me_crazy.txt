Where'd you grow up?
High up in the hills, or Hollywood & Vine?
Were you spoon fed, for your whole life?
Never made to compromise?

A twist of fate and a strange place
Brought us here face to face

So come on tell me your name
And don't leave out anything
Your skinny hip huggin' jeans
They got me down on my knees
And I just can't walk away
But I'm not sure what to say
I could be wrong, could be right
It feels like love at first sight

Call me crazy, ya e ya ya e ya,
Call me crazy, ya e ya ya e ya

I'd fight a hard fight
To have you in my life,
From the inside it feels right
Steal, beg N' borrowed, just to see ya tomorrow
I could die in your arms tonight

a twist of fate and a strange place
Brought us here face to face

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Like Cinderella and her slipper
We were ment to be together
In a moment, in a flicker
Could be you N' me forever
Now that I can see love is in front me
Ment to be together, you N' me forever
Now that I can see love is in front me
Ment to be together, you N' me forever

[Chorus Outro]
