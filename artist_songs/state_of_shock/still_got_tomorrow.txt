What would you say?
What would you do?
What is it you'd uncover?
What would you find, if you could rewind,
From all this weight your under?
Would it be good
Would it be right?
or have your dreams shattered?
Would you be lost?
would there be a cost?
Was it worth chasing after all (all all)
Was it worth it (all all all)
Was it worth it?!

Say you should've been famous 
as you look back at all of you've wasted
Life should be what you make it
You've still got tomorrow
Seeing the lines all over our faces 
We all get lost in translations
Life should be what you make it
You've still got tomorrow

What did they know?
What did they see?
Flicker of hope in sunset
Would you be the same?
With no one to blame,
Knowing it ain't over
Woa woawoa
It ain't over
Woa woawoa
It ain't over!

Say you should've been famous 
Woa oh
as you look back at all of you've wasted
Woa woawoa
Life should be what you make it
You've still got tomorrow
Seeing the lines all over our faces 
Woa oh
we all get lost in translations
Woa woawoa
Life should be what you make it
Woaaaa
You've still got tomorrow
(Tomorrow)

Still Got Tomorrow (Woa ohhh)
Still Got Tomorrow (Woa ohhh)

Say you should've been famous 
as you look back at all of you've wasted
Life should be what you make it
Woaaaa
You've still got tomorrow
(Tomorrow)
Seeing the lines all over our faces 
Woa oh
we all get lost in translations
Woa woawoa
Life should be what you make it
Woaaaa
You've still got tomorrow

Still Got Tomorrow (Woa ohhh)
Still Got Tomorrow (Woa ohhh)
We've Still Got Tomorrow
