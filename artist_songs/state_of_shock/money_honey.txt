As I'm staring through this fire
It's too late to make you mine
So far from where we started
So far from what we wanted
And as both our worlds fall down
We have lost and we have found
So far from where we started
So far from what we wanted

I've made mistakes, that I can't erase
I've made mistakes

[Chorus:]
If I had more money honey
Would you love me, love me, love me
If I wasn't just somebody like me, like me
If I had more money honey
Would you love me, love me, love me
If I wasn't just somebody like me, like me
I've made mistakes that I can't erase, I've made mistakes

Oh I should have seen the signs
Now we're falling back in time
So far from where we started
So far from what we wanted
And I'm trying to right this wrong
So I need you to be strong
So far from where we started
So far from what we wanted

I've made mistakes, that I can't erase
I've made mistakes

[Chorus]

Ya ya yo, ya ya yo
I know you know
So let it go
ya ya yo, ya ya yo
I know you know,
Ive made mistakes
that I can't erase
Ive made mistakes

[Chorus]

Ya ya yo, ya ya yo
I know you know
So let it go
ya ya yo, ya ya yo
I know you know
