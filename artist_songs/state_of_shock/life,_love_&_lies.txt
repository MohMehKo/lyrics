Can you take what you give?
Who do you think you are?
Playing a game of charades
With my life in your arms

It's not like it was do or die
We expect the unexpected
But the day you left it for dead
Was the day it went too far

Is this life or goodbye
I'm caught in the crossfire
Of life love and lies
Is this life or goodbye
I'm scared to death inside
Of life love and lies

All I know is what you tell me
It's not what you think we had
But all that you ever hid
When I was there for you

Is this life or goodbye
I'm caught in the crossfire
Of life love and lies

Is this life or goodbye
I'm scared to death inside
Of life love and lies
Is this life
So god help me
I'm caught in the crossfire

Every time I stand for you
You stand 
Every time I stand for you
I'm caught in the crossfire

Is this life or goodbye
I'm scared to death inside
Of Life Love and Lies
Is this life or goodbye
I'm caught in the crossfire
Of life love and lies
Is this life
So god help me
I'm caught in the crossfire
