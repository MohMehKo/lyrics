Woke up Sunday morning
You were nowhere to be found
You n' me we've gotta get to 
Talkin' about to talkin' this out
You're runnin' round. 

Lipstick note that was on the mirror
Threw my hands up in the air
You n me we've gotta get to 
Talkin' this out to talkin' about
You're runnin' round

Ya you're runnin' around
On my dime and on my time

Get your hands off those car keys
'Cause you're never gonna get another me
Threw all your shit out in the street
Thanks for showing me that
All you do is take n break n say its my mistake
Ready, set, go, here comes the heartache
I hope you have a nice day
'Cause you're never gonna get another me

You text, "trouble with the car"
Facebook says you were at the bar
You 'n me we've gotta get to 
Talkin' this out to talkin' about
You're runnin around
Passed out drunk on the kitchen floor
I can't take this anymore
You 'n me we've gotta get to 
Talkin' this out talkin' about
You're running round

Ya you're runnin' around
On my dime and my time

Get your hands off those car keys
'Cause you're never gonna get another me
Threw all your shit out in the street
Thanks for showing me that
All you do is take n break n say its my mistake
Ready, set, go, here comes the heartache
I hope you have a nice day
'Cause you're never gonna get another me

I never knew someone could get to me
Till ya got me, shot me, rocked me
Right through the heart

Get out

Get your hands off those car keys
'Cause you're never gonna get another me
Threw all your shit out in the street
Thanks for showing me that
All you do is take n break n say its my mistake
Ready, set, go, here comes the heartache
I hope you have a nice day
'Cause you're never gonna get another me

I never knew someone could get to me
Till ya got me, shot me, rocked me
Right through the heart
