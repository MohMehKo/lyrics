I wonder why i even try
So tired of the fight
Whats the point when we know
You'll never change
We'll never see eye to eye

Im telling you to meet me half way
Youre telling me to stay away
Youre telling me that we should just be friends
Im telling you that this is the end

[Chorus:]
I wish i never met you
Let me go
It is over
I wish i never met you
Now you know
It is over

All these voices in my head
Asking me if its dead
I cant think of a better time
To let you know
We'll never be friends again

Im telling you to meet me half way
Youre telling me to stay away
Youre telling me that we should just be friends
Im telling you that this is the end

[Chorus x2:]
I wish i never met you
Let me go
It is over
I wish i never met you
Now you know
It is over

I wish i never met you
Let me go
It is over
I wish i never met you
Now you know
It is over

I wonder why i even try
(so tired of the fight)
Whats the point when we know
You'll never change
We'll never see eye to eye

[Chorus:]
I wish i never met you
Let me go
It is over
I wish i never met you
Now you know
It is over

I wish i never met you
Let me go
It is over
I wish i never met you

I wish i never met you
I wish yeah
I wish yeah
I wish i never met you
Now you know
It is over
