Can I trust you'll go away
If I'm to say, I’m okay
Just let me bleed on my own
And I will find my way home

Cause the sad sad side of it all
Is you don’t remember
Being a breath away from death
The sad sad side of it all

And maybe, on a different day
I'd let the rain, wash this away
But it’s just too late
The sad sad side of it all
Is you don’t remember

This key cannot be re-cut
Cause my hearts been sealed shut
And if our paths cross again
I'll turn and walk away

Cause the sad sad side of it all
Is you dont remember
Being a breath away from death
The sad sad side of it all

And maybe, on a different day
I’d share the blame I’d share the pain
But it’s just too late
And maybe, on a different day
I’d let the rain wash this away 
But it’s just too late
The sad sad side of it all
Is you don’t remember
Being a breath away from death
The sad sad side of it all

Is you're looking around lost
Just trying to find your way
Looking around lost
Just trying to find your way home

Can I trust you'll go away
If I’m to say I’m okay?
Just let me bleed on my own
And I will find my way home

And maybe, on a different day
I'd share the blame I’d share the pain
But it's just too late
And maybe, on a different day
I’d let the rain wash this away 
But it’s just too late 
The sad sad side of it all 
Is you don’t remember
Being a breath away from death
The sad sad side of it all
Is you don’t remember
The sad sad side of it all
Is you don’t remember
