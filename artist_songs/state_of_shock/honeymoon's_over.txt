A shoebox filled with memories
A bedroom trashed
All that we used to be
She's tearing up in half
A diamond ring down the drain
Her suitcase packed
All my clothes are in the bath
She's looking for a match

Look at the mess I made

Honeymoons over
Now I'm licking my wounds
Kicking myself, looking back
Honeymoons over
And it never crossed my mind
Every time I walked the line
It's over, it's over
She says I'm going home all alone
The honeymoons over
Now she's going home

Never thought my life on the road
Would follow me back home
Now she's going to take everything
Says I'm never going to change
And now I'm wondering how to fix
All the shit I did
To put out the fire that I lit
And make my girl love me again

Look at the mess I made

Honeymoons over
Now I'm licking my wounds
Kicking myself, looking back
Honeymoons over
And it never crossed my mind
Every time I walked the line
It's over, it's over
She says I'm going home all alone
The honeymoons over
Now she's going home

I knew you were there for me
I swore I'd be there too
I love you, I love you
How can I make it up to you
I'm sorry I made you leave
What the hell is wrong with me?
I love you, I love you
Let me make it up to you
The honeymoon's over
Now I'm licking my wounds kicking myself

Honeymoons over
Now I'm licking my wounds
Kicking myself, looking back
Honeymoons over
And it never crossed my mind
Every time I walked the line
It's over, it's over
She says I'm going home all alone
The honeymoons over
Now she's going home
The honeymoons over
Now she's going home
