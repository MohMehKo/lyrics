It's hard to say our love had it's place
But the time is over,
It ran its course
I can't let it go on knowing
That you're relying on me
When I'm relying on you

As good as you are to me
I'll be that far
By the time you're crying
This is goodbye

Pieces of you
Is what I'll hold on to
When the times get tough
When my luck runs dry
Pieces of you
Is what'll get me through
When the times get tough
When my luck runs dry
I'm sorry that today is that day
I'm sorry but it's better this way

We fell in love, now we fall apart
All alone you always amazed me
But I, I Can't let it go on knowing
That you're relying on me when I'm relying on you

As good as you are to me
I'll be that far
By the time you're
This is goodbye
Pieces of you
Is what I'll hold on to
When the times get tough
When my luck runs dry
Pieces of you
Is what'll get me through
When the times get tough
When my luck runs dry
I'm sorry that today is that day
I'm sorry but it's better this way

I want you to know
If it was meant to be
Where we left off
Is fine with me
I'll miss everything
Cherish the memories
That one time
You were mine

As good as you are to me
I'll be that far
By the time you're crying
This is goodbye

Pieces of you
Is what I'll hold on to
When the times get tough
When my luck runs dry
Pieces is what'll get me through
When the time get tough...
I'll miss, I'll miss
I will miss everything about you
I will miss everything about you
I will miss everything
