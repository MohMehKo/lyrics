I only call it like I see it
I only speak the truth
So take it or leave it
My words won't break in two
Don't need no anisthetic baby all I need is you like
Woah oh woah oh
Let's take a ride on the subway to somewhere we can talk
No city lights surrounding
Just us and the stars
Don't need no complications or keep you in the dark like
Woah woah

And I just want to tell you
I just say it cause I know it
I just say it cause I know it
It's just the truth from me to you 
And you shouldn't need more proof
I just say it cause I know it
I just say it cause I know it
I just say it cause I know it

I hear the words you're not saying 
Playing in the tracks
I'm lost in this moment 
And there's no turning back
Don't need no intervention I'm good where I'm at like
Woah oh woah oh

And I just want to tell you 

[Repeat Chorus]

And I just wanna tell ya [5x]

[Repeat Chorus]

I only call it like I see it
I only speak the truth
So take it or leave it
My words won't break in two
Don't need no anisthetic baby all I need is you like
Woah oh woah oh

I just say it cause I know it
