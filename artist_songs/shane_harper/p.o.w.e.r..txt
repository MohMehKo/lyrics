Lightning bolts, in my heart 
Cause girl, you got that power
Red eyes glow, my superstar 
Turn me up a little louder 

Can't figure out what you do to me
But you got me good, you got me good 
You brought so much electricity 
To the neighborhood, the neighborhood 
Although it doesn't add up logistically 
Tell me why it should, tell me why it should 
Can't figure out what you do to me 
But you got me good, you got me good 

But I promise, it's not like me
To fall in love with a stranger at first sight
But my body, can't fight it
You take me down, just one look into your eyes

Lightning bolts, in my heart 
Cause girl, you got that power
Red eyes glow, my superstar 
Turn me up a little louder

Cause girl, you got that power [x2]

I don't know 'bout your history
And I wouldn't care, want you anyway 
I don't want you to ever leave 
So just stay the night
Why don't you babe?

But I promise, it's not like me
To fall in love with a stranger at first sight
But my body, can't fight it
You take me down, just one look into your eyes

Lightning bolts, in my heart 
Cause girl, you got that power
Red eyes glow, my superstar 
Turn me up a little louder

Cause girl, you got that power 

Something strong 
Running through your bones
The way your power makes me glow 
And we ignite, cause baby 
Oh the fire's you 

Lightning bolts, in my heart 
Cause girl, you got that power
Red eyes glow, my superstar 
Turn me up a little louder

Cause girl, you got that power [x5]
