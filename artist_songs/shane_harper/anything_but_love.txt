Tongue tied, I'd lie 
If I said I didn't want you 
A moment, like a sunrise 
And your eyes shine like the morning sun 

When you're here, I'm alive 
I want you now tonight 
Show you love, all the time 
I want you now tonight 

She don't believe me 
I don't think she wants to
She's down to fall for 
Anything but love
High on the night light
Tells me she's alright 
She's making time for 
Anything but love 

You come undone
And I won't run
So hold tight cause 
I could be the one 
Yeah I'll fall first
Just to show you 
That I don't want 
Anything but love 

Anything but love [x2]

You stopped my heart
Girl, I'm just being honest 
What you got, they all want 
Ain't a contest girl, it's like night and day

When you're here, I'm alive 
I want you now tonight 
Show you love, all the time 
I want you now tonight 

She don't believe me 
I don't think she wants to
She's down to fall for 
Anything but love
High on the night light
Tells me she's alright 
She's making time for 
Anything but love 

You come undone
And I won't run
So hold tight cause 
I could be the one 
Yeah I'll fall first
Just to show you 
That I don't want 
Anything but love 

Anything but love [x2]

She don't believe me 
I don't think she wants to
She's down to fall for 
Anything but love
High on the night light
Tells me she's alright 
She's making time for 
Anything but love 

You come undone
And I won't run
So hold tight cause 
I could be the one 
Yeah I'll fall first
Just to show you 
That I don't want 
Anything but love 

Anything but love [x4]
