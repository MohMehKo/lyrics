(Baby, I know what I know
And I know what's ment to be
Shane, take us out)

Don't try to hide, I catch your smiling everytime I look away
I know inside you get excited everytime I say your name

But I feel you're tryin' to pull away
Baby by now you should know with me you're safe
There's no reason for feeling afraid

Cuz I know what I know
You're tryin' to fight what you know is ment to be
So why don't you let go
And finally leave your heart up on your sleeve
And let me see it beat
Cuz you know when we're alone it feels like an earthquake
I know what I know
I know you feel the same

Eh, eh, eh (bring it back)

Can't you see it that I'm feeling everything you throw at me
I'd never leave you cuz I need you like the air that I breath

But I feel you're tryin' to pull away
Baby by now you should know with me you're safe
There's no reason for feeling afraid

Cuz I know what I know
You're tryin' to fight what you know is ment to be
So why don't you let go
And finally leave your heart up on your sleeve
And let me see it beat
Cuz you know when we're alone it feels like an earthquake
I know what I know
I know you feel the same

[Rap:]
Don't pull away, baby I got you
Couldn't see myself living without you
In my life till the day that I D.I.
Take away all the rain with your sunshine
I just wanna say three words one time
I love your heart hunny and you're so mine
All my friends be like she's so fine
I'd be like ya ya she's so mine
Imma scream from the mountain top
With the snare and the kick go bounce and pop
If you ever need something just call the prop
I'll be there in a minute and the tears will stop
They can't mess with it
Find our real love and yes we did it
Came from up there and angels sent it
Imma have my due, Shane just sing it

Cuz I know what I know
You're tryin' to fight what you know is ment to be
So why don't you let go
And finally leave your heart up on your sleeve
And let me see it beat
Cuz you know when we're alone it feels like an earthquake
I know what I know
I know you feel the same
