I know it's cold, but you're not frozen
Keep your walls from closin'
It's not what you want

When you look back on all the steps you've taken
You don't want them wasted, buried in dust
So just, hold on I see it in your eyes
Take off and don't apologize
Lookin' down from the sky

Ohhh Ohhhh Ohhhh
Nothin' in the world can hold you down
This time you're shootin' up high
Sail through the air like a satellite
You'll glow (oh oh) when you feel the darkness closin' in tonight
You can shine bright 
Sail through the air like a satellite

Ohhh Ohhhh Ohhh like a satellite oh
People teach you to be perfect
Livin' then you're learnin' you're strong enough

So won't you lay down 
all your heavy burdens
Tables will be turnin' as you touch the sun
So just, hold on, I see it in your eyes
Take off and don't apologize
Lookin' down from the sky

Ohhh Ohhhh Ohhhh
Nothin' in the world can hold you down
This time you're shootin' up high
Sail through the air like a satellite
You'll glow (oh oh) when you feel the darkness closin' in tonight
You can shine bright 
Sail through the air like a satellite

Ohhh Ohhhh Ohhhh Ohhh Ohhhh Ohhhh

Hold on I see it  in you're eyes
Take off and don't apologize
Lookin' down from the sky

Ohhh Ohhhh Ohhhh
Nothin' in the world can hold you down
This time you're shootin' up high
Sail through the air like a satellite
You'll glow (oh oh) when you feel the darkness closin' in tonight
You can shine bright 
Sail through the air like a satellite

Ohhh Ohhhh Ohhhh Ohhh Ohhhh Ohhhh
And you'll float away
