[VERSE 1]
I don't know what to do here
I can't get my eyes off of you dear
Everything you do is amazing
And I'm just saying you're so... 
Beautiful in every way
Girl could you please just stay

[CHORUS]
I'm just saying what is real
And I'm just saying how I feel
When I'm with you I'm on top of the world, could you be my girl?
I get the chills on a warm summers day and when I'm with you
You take my breathe away
Walk with me, talk with me and, stay with me
And when they drop the beat
Dance with me

[VERSE 2]
I get nervous when I'm talking to you
But on the dance floor you know I can come through
I know how to lay it down, listen to the sound
Baby let your body hit the ground, let your body hit the ground

[CHORUS]
I'm just saying what is real
And I'm just saying how I feel
When I'm with you I'm on top of the world, could you be my girl?
I get the chills on a warm summers day and when I'm with you
You take my breathe away
Walk with me, talk with me and, stay with me
And when they drop the beat
Dance with me

[BRIDGE]
Well I've danced before with other girls
But not like this
I've moved to the rhythm a thousand times
But not like this
This is the difference
You're the one I'm missing
Just give me a try
I'll show you why... 

[CHORUS x2]
I'm just saying what is real
And I'm just saying how I feel
When I'm with you I'm on top of the world, could you be my girl?
I get the chills on a warm summers day and when I'm with you
You take my breathe away
Walk with me, talk with me
And, stay with me and when they drop the beat
Dance with me

I'm just saying what is real
And I'm just saying how I feel
When I'm with you I'm on top of the world, could you be my girl?
I get the chills on a warm summers day and when I'm with you
You take my breathe away walk with me, 
Talk with me and, stay with me
And when they drop the beat
Dance with me
