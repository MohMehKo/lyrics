I've written a thousand words I know
Sorry, I love you and please don't goes
I've waited so long, I'm sure it shows
I've written a thousand words I know

I'm wasting away
A little more everyday
Wait for me
Wait for me

When I asked you to stay
How you're gonna go on your way
Wait for me
Wait for me
Wait for me

I've sold a million lies you spoke
Over and over till we broke
I know that it means everything
To you but do you really think
This time apart will mend and help us grow?
I've told a million lies I know...

I'm wasting away
A little more everyday
Wait for me
Wait for me

When I asked you to stay
How you're gonna go on your way
Wait for me
Wait for me
Wait for me

Oh whoa...

I'm wasting away
A little more everyday
Wait for me

We're wasting away
A little more everyday
Wait for me
Wait for me

When I asked you to stay
How you're gonna go on your way
Wait for me
Wait for me
Wait for me

My love
Don't tell me that it's over
My love
Can't take it anymore
My love
Is staring at the future
My love
Is staring at the door
Don't wait for me
