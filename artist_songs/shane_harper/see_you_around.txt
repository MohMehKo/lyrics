You got, you got the records that I gave you 
I got, I got your picture in a frame
You said, you said forever was a promise
But I guess, I guess a promise gotta break 

Yeah you used to hold me
Like we could never end
Now I'm just a story 
That you tell all your friends 

I wanna know, do you feel better now? 
I wanna know, cause I can't figure out 
Where I can go, and not be thinkin' how 
I used to see you every day, and now I guess 
I'll see you, I'll see you around [x3]
I used to see you every day, and now I guess 

Memories, they follow me just like my shadow
I see, I see you everywhere I go
And they say, that I'll be better by tomorrow 
But I can't let go, can't let go 

Yeah you used to hold me 
Like we could never end 
Now I'm just a story 
That you tell all your friends 

I wanna know, do you feel better now? 
I wanna know, cause I can't figure out 
Where I can go, and not be thinkin' how
I used to see you every day, and now I guess
I'll see you, I'll see you around [x3]
I used to see you every day, and now I guess 

I just need to let you go
Truth is you're already gone 
I just need to let you go
I just keep on holding on 

I wanna know, do you feel better now?

I wanna know, do you feel better now?
I wanna know, cause I can't figure out
Where I can go, and not be thinkin' how 
I used to see you every day, and now I guess
I'll see you, I'll see you around [x3]
I used to see you every day, and now I guess
