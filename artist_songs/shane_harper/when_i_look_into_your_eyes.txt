Have I told you before, you're one of a kind?
The way that you make me feel, like the sun always shines.
And have I ever let you know that I could never let you go?
Baby, my heart is like the love's drum, beating like never before.

'Cause when I look into your eyes,
I see the whole life is spinning out of control
And, you know, it happens everytime,
When we're together it's like heaven, only better
I hope it last forever,
Oh oh ohh, oh oh ohhh, oh oh ohh oh,
I hope it last forever,
Oh oh ohh, oh oh ohhh, oh oh ohh oh.

Can't shake this feeling inside, even if I try,
And you know I'll never let you fall,
'Cause when you're with me I can fly.

'Cause when I look into your eyes,
I see the whole world like is spinning out of control
And, you know, it happens everytime,
When we're together it's like heaven, only better
I hope it lasts forever,
Oh oh ohh, oh oh ohhh, oh oh ohh oh,
I hope it lasts forever,
oh oh ohh, oh oh ohhh, oh oh ohh oh.

I need you more then you know
Yeah, I need you, don't let me go,
Baby, don't let go
'Cause when I look into your eyes...

'Cause when I look into your eyes,
I see the whole world like is spinning out of control
And, you know, it happens everytime
When we're together it's like heaven, only better
I hope it last forever.
