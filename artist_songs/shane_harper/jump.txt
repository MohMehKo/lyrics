Oh whoa
Oh whoa oh oh

[Verse 1:]
Your voice makes my heart melt like
Your smile lights up the room
And I can't help myself try and keep myself from falling

[Verse 2:]
I don't know if this is magic
One wish yeah then it happened
Just one kiss from your sweet lips
I'm falling

[Chorus:]
Oh I'm on the edge and I can't look down
Scared to jump could you help me out
So I'm falling falling falling
Keep falling falling falling

[Verse 3:]
One word is all it takes
Then my knees get so weak and
Somebody help me please
I'm falling

[Chorus:]
Oh I'm on the edge and I can't look down
Scared to jump could you help me out
So I'm falling falling falling
Keep falling falling falling

[Chorus 2:]
Yeah I'm on the edge and I'm stepping out
Afraid to love till you show me how
So I'm falling falling falling
Keep falling falling falling

[Bridge:]
I know that we could be so in love
It's taking over me My mind's made up
I know that we could be
If I just jump [2x]

[Chorus]

[Chorus 2]

I'm falling I'm falling free falling
Your voice makes my heart melt like
