Josie’s on vacation far away
So come around and talk it over
There’s so many things that I wanna say
You know I like my girls a little bit older
I just wanna use your love tonight (tonight)
Ohhh
I don’t wanna lose your love tonight

I ain’t got many friends left to talk to
No one’s around when I’m in trouble
You know I’d do anything for you
To stay the night but keep it under cover
I just wanna use your love tonight (tonight)
ohhh
I don’t wanna lose your love tonight (tonight)

I try to stop my hands from shakin’
Somethin’ in my mind’s not makin’ sense
Better watch as we’ve been all alone
I can like the way I’m feelin’

As you leave me please won’t you close the door
And don’t forget what I told you
Just cause you’re right that doesn’t mean I’m wrong
Another shoulder to cry upon
I just wanna use your love tonight
I don’t wanna lose your love tonight
I just wanna use your love tonight
I just wanna use your love
I don’t wanna lose your love tonight

Yeah
I just wanna use your love tonight
I just wanna use your love
I don’t wanna lose your love tonight
And I just wanna use your love
I just wanna use your love tonight
I just wanna use your love
Baby, I don’t wanna lose your love tonight

Yeah I just wanna use your love tonight
I don’t wanna lose your love tonight
