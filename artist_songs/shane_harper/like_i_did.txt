The way you're looking at me like I don't already know
This is how it happens, this is just the way it goes
I can see him on every inch of your skin
You can pretend it's right

Tell me is he everything you wanted?
Tell me does he love you like I did?
I hope when you think about it you know
What you got with him won't even come close
Tell me does he love you like I did?

Does he love you like I did, did, did, did, did? [4x]

Time and time again I fall for you
Baby, these are nothing more than memories to you
Do you ever wonder why something's missing, when you pretend it's right?

Tell me is he everything you wanted?
Tell me does he love you like I did?
I hope when you think about it you know
What you got with him won't even come close
Tell me does he love you like I did?

Does he love you like I did, did, did, did, did? [4x]

He can't, he can't, give you that all the magic that we had
He can't, he can't, give you that magic, magic that we had
He can't, he can't, give you that all the magic that we had
He can't, he can't give you that magic, magic, magic, magic

Tell me is he everything you wanted
Tell me does he love you like I did (does he love you like I did)?
I hope when you think about it you know (think about you)
What you got with him won't even come close (it won't even come close)
Tell me does he love you like I did (does he love you like I did)?
Does he love you like I did, did, did, did, did (does he love you like I did)? [4x]

Does he love you like I did?
