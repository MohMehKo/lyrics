Wake up good morning, a cup of coffee in my hand and a song in my head
Outside it's pouring, I heard the weather man say that I should stay in
Ain't no sunshine but it's feels right ain't no blue sky's but it's allright
Lets get the rain on my skin, I'm ready for the day to begin
I hear the drip, drip drops falling on my rooftop, the lighting joins in and the
Thunder starts like a beatbox, gotta smile on my face
It's a perfect day to go dancing in the rain

(Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do)

It's a perfect day to go dancing in the rain

(Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do)

It's a perfect day to go dancing in the rain
Take my umbrella, you can keep it I don't need it soaking up the day
(Ooh) this is my count off, I tip my hat back rolled slacks 5, 6, 7, 8
No sunshine but it's all right ain't no blue skies but it feels right
I got it falling down on my skin and it's a perfect day to go dancing in
The rain

(Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do)

It's a perfect day to go dancing in the rain

(Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do)

It's a perfect day to go dancing in the rain

And I don't need no coat tapping to the rythm while the raindrops flow
Puddle stomping
I'm a big old kid

And I ain't stopping till the sun breaks in like

It's a perfect day [X2] to go dancing in the rain
It's a perfect day [X2] to go dancing in the rain

(Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do)

It's a perfect day to go dancing in the rain

(Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do)

It's a perfect day to go dancing in the rain

It's a perfect day, a perfect day
