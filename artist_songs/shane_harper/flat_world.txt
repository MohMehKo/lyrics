Used to live in a world
Where everything was flat
Could you imagine that?

All the colors were the same
White black and a little grey
Yeah, pretty much the same

And I came from a town
Where the birds, they never made a sound
And Rockets never left the ground

Used to live in a world
Where everything was flat
Could you imagine, could you imagine, could you imagine that?

Oh oh oh oh oh oh

You're like a rush of blood to my head
You're like, ice water running down my neck
You're like hot coals under my feet
Had my eyes shut I must've, I must've been asleep
Yeah I must've been asleep

Now the sky is really bright
Now the water's really clear
I felt the world leave my feet
As I drift off into the atmosphere
Baby you're out of this world
What are you still doing here
Cause a girl like you and a guy like me
You're too good for me, my dear

Oh oh oh oh oh oh...

You're like a rush of blood to my head
You're like, ice water running down my neck
You're like hot coals under my feet
Had my eyes shut I must've, I must've been asleep
Yeah I must've been asleep

Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na...

You're like a rush of blood to my head
You're like, ice water running down my neck
You're like hot coals under my feet
Had my eyes shut I must've, I must've been asleep
Yeah I must've been asleep

Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na...

Yeah I must've been asleep

Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na...

You're like hot coals under my feet
Had my eyes shut I must've, I must've been asleep
Yeah I must've been asleep

Yeah I must've been asleep

Yeah I must've been asleep
