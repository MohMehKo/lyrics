It's been fourteen minutes
Since I dropped you off and
My mind's still racing
Never thought I'd think about
It's all about you
With your two left feet
And how you're just so sweet
You've got me falling
Like a shooting star

And you've got all my friends
Saying wah ah oh ohhh
When I see you smile
I need to know oh oh ohh

Do your knees go weak
Does your tongue get twist
Afraid to close your eyes
Cause you might miss this
I need to know, I need to know
Is it like a rocketship
Stole your heart
Box it up and take it all the way to Mars
I need to know, I need to know

Two weeks and counting
Since I saw you standing
Fairfax and fountain
And every thought I think about
It's all about you
So here's the thing (the thing)
I say what I mean
No hiding back behind some clever line

And you've got all my friends
Saying wah ah oh ohhh
When I see you smile
I need to know oh oh ohh

Do your knees go weak
Does your tongue get twist
Afraid to close your eyes
Cause you might miss this
I need to know, I need to know
Is it like a rocketship
Stole your heart
Box it up and take it all the way to Mars
I need to know, I need to know

Cause every little thing about you is makin' me
Every little thing about you is makin' me
Go go go, go go go
It's making me go go go crazy

La la la la la
La la la la la la hey
La la la la la

And you've got all my friends
Saying wah ah oh ohhh
When I see you smile
I need to know

Do your knees go weak
Does your tongue get twist
Afraid to close your eyes
Cause you might miss this
I need to know, I need to know
Is it like a rocketship
Stole your heart
Box it up and take it all the way to Mars
I need to know, I need to know

Hey, hey don't hesitate
I can't wait, wait one more day
I need to know, I need to know
Hey, hey don't hesitate
I can't wait, wait one more day
I need to know, I need to know

Cause every little thing about you is makin' me
Every little thing about you is makin' me
Go go go, go go go
It's making me go go go crazy
