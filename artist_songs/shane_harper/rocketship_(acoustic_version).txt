It's been fourteen minutes
Since I dropped you off and
And my mind is racing
Never thought I'd think about
It's all about you
With your two left feet
And how you're just so sweet
You've got me falling
Like a shooting star

And you've got all my friends
Sayin wah ah oh ohhh
When I see you smile
I need to know oh oh ohh

Do your knees go weak
Does your tongue get twist
Afraid to close your eyes
Cause you might miss this
I need to know, I need to know
Is it like a rocketship
Slow your heart
Box it up and take it all the way to mars
I need to know, I need to know

Two weeks and counting
Since I saw you standing
Fake facts and founding
And never thought I'd think about
It's all about you
So here's the thing
I say what I mean
No hiding back behind some clever line

And you've got all my friends
Sayin wah ah oh ohhh
When I see you smile
I need to know oh oh ohh

Do your knees go weak
Does your tongue get twist
Afraid to close your eyes
Cause you might miss this
I need to know, I need to know
Is it like a rocketship
Slow your heart
Box it up and take it all the way to mars
I need to know, I need to know

Cus every little thing bout you is makin' me
Every little thing bout you is makin' me
Go go go, go go go
It's making me go go go crazy

La la la la la
La la la la la la hey
La la la la la

And you've got all my friends
Sayin wah ah oh ohhh
When I see you smile
I need to know oh oh ohh

Do your knees get weak
Does your tongue get twisted
Is it like a rocketship
Slow your heart
I need to, I need to, I need to know

Hey please don't hesitate
I can't wait wait one more day
I need to know, I need to know
Hey please don't hesitate
I can't wait wait one more day
I need to know, I need to know

Cus every little thing bout you is makin' me
Every little thing bout you is makin' me
Go go go, go go go
It's making me go go go crazy
