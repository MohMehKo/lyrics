I'll stay if you stay
And we walks the night away, forget about yesterday
I’ll go if you go
And we'll run into the sun, forget about everyone

Let's take, take the world tonight
'Cause you're here and everything's alright
I can feel it in my bones with you
Oh oh oh oh oh...

And I feel the fire in your hands
If you'd touch, I’ll be more than just a man
Shine brighter than anything I've ever known
Oh oh oh oh oh...

I’ll fight if you fight
Yeah it takes more a thousand to one
Cause baby you’re the one
I’ll run if you run
Yeah let’s spent this endless night 
With you, I’m by your side
I’m by your side 
I’m by your side 
I’m by your side
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh...
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh...

Let's take, take the world tonight
'Cause you're here and everything's alright
I can feel it in my bones with you
Oh oh oh oh oh

And I feel the fire in your hands
If you'd touch, I’ll be more than just a man
Shine brighter than anything I've ever known
Oh oh oh oh oh...

Oh oh oh oh...

Let's take, take the world tonight
'Cause you're here and everything's alright
I can feel it in my bones with you
Oh oh oh oh oh

And I feel the fire in your hands
If you'd touch, I'll be more than just a man
Shine brighter than anything I've ever known
Oh oh oh oh...
