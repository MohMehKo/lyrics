I've been captured by a love I can't explain 
And now you have me and I'm forever changed
I've abandoned everything I've ever known 
Now I surrender my life is not my own
I belong to you, I belong to you [x4]
[Repeat x3]

My life is not my own to you I belong 
I give myself I give myself to you 
[x8]
