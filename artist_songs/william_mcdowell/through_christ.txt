[Verse 1:]
I believe the word of God
Even more than what I see around
I move by faith and not by sight
Believing what you said

[Verse 2:]
Deep down in my heart there’s a testimony
Filled with the hope of eternity.
I Walk by faith and not by sight
Believing what you said

[Bridge:]
My victory is in the promise of eternity
No longer bound by what I see
I have the victory

[Chorus:]
Through Christ we triumph
Through Christ We have the victory

[Verse 1 + 2]

[Vamp:]
My victory is guaranteed
And not based on the things that I see around me
His proclamation is my destination
What he says, I’ll say
I’ll see what he says

Victory I’ve got it
Eternally I’ve got the victory

Victory I’ve got it
Eternally I’ve got the victory
What he says, I’ll say
I’ll see what he says

[Chorus:]
Through Christ we triumph
Through Christ We have the victory
