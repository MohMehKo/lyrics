The weight... I'm under... I scarce... can move...
Alone... surrounded... consumed... by You...
I need You to help me,
Need You to help me breathe...
Woh-oh-oh-oh, I need You to help me breathe...
Oh... woh-oh-oh-oh, woh-oh-oh-oh, take me in.
Oh... woh-oh-oh-oh, woh-oh-oh-oh, take me in.
[2x]

Hold me a little bit closer,
A little while longer in your arms.
Take me a little bit deeper
You are life to my soul.
[2x]

Oh... woh-oh-oh-oh, woh-oh-oh-oh, take me in.
[Repeat several times]
