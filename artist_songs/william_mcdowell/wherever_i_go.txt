[Chorus:]
My heart is yours
Lord I belong to you
I would do anything
Just to be close to you
Your love is so amazing
Can't keep it to myself
I gotta tell the world
I belong to you

[Bridge 1:]
Lord I'm amazed
By your great grace
That's why I can't keep it to myself
I gotta tell it wherever I go

[Bridge 2:]
You are my healer
Your my provider
That's why I can't keep it to myself
I gotta tell it wherever I go

[Bridge 3:]
Gives me direction
Your my protection
That's why I can't keep it to myself
I gotta tell it wherever I go

[Bridge 4:]
Lord you are Faithful
I am so greatfull
That's why I can't keep it to myself
I gotta tell it wherever I go
