Holy spirit we are calling on you
We are asking you to send the rain
When we worship in spirit and truth something happens
That we can't explain... demon's travel kings bow down
Lives are changed at the sound of your name
(when we lift our voices in praise
Let your glory fill this place...
As we bring this offering Jesus we crown 
You as lord and king)
As we worship

[ad-lib worship leader]
