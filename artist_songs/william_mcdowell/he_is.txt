[Chorus:]
(Almighty), Almighty, (Incredible), Incredible,
(Amazing), Amazing, (Supernatural), Supernatural
(Wonderful), Wonderful, (Marvelous), Marvelous,
(He Is), He Is, (He Is), He Is

[Verse 1:]
Let creation sing, let the people shout
For His goodness and his mercy
Let us praise Him now
Every knee shall bow
Every tongue proclaim
Giving glory to His Holy Name

[Channel:]
He is the Lord over everything
And let all of creation proclaim, He Is

[Verse 2:]
Let the earth rejoice, let the people dance
To our Savior and Redeemer
We will lift our hands
He's the Lord of Lords and the King of Kings
Hallelujah, let creation sing
