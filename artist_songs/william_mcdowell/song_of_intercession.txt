[Sung]
Oh Lord... we come...
To You... we lay our lives before You
You know... our needs... before... we asked.
So we come... not for ourselves...
But we're crying out for the nations.

Oh Lord... we pray...
Give us beauty for ashes,
Strength for our weakness,
Oh Lord... we pray...
Give us faith to believe,
Hearts that we seek.

Oh Lord... we pray...
As Your church, we arise,
Jesus, please hear our cry and have mercy...

[Spoken]
Do I have a room full of intercessors tonight
Who will begin to lift up your voice?
Some of you may even want to run to the altar.
And begin to lift up your voice
Not on behalf of yourself,
But on behalf of the nations.

Is there anyone that would join me
In praying for the nations of the earth,
That the government will be upon His shoulders,
That the Lord of glory will intervene
And hear the affairs of man?
Where are the intercessors?
Where are those who will cry out?
Where are those who will believe God,
Who will say...

[Sung]
"Oh God, hear Your people.
Oh God, hear the cries of Your people."
As we lift up our voices tonight,
As we lift up our voices tonight.
If we've ever needed You,
Right now is the time,
Right now is the time to
Change the nations, Lord. [3x]
Reveal Your glory.
And let Your church rise.
Oh God, reveal Your glory.
And let the church rise.

Oh God, let the government be on your shoulders.
Intervene on the behalf of every leader,
Every nation, we cry out, we cry out, we cry out.
We cry out, oh... We need You...
Have mercy on us, Lord. [3x]
And turn our hearts back to You.
Turn our hearts back to You. [2x]
Turn our hearts back to You, oh God.

Reveal Your Son; release miracles.
Signs of wonders, oh God, release miracles.
Signs of wonders, that You will be glorified.
High and lifted up, and the nations will tremble.
The nations will come in fear and say
"Jesus Christ is Lord!" [2x]
You are Lord!

Let the church rise [3x]
Come on, lift up your voices
Let a sound be heard [2x]
Through the nations of the earth.
Oh...

The change I want to see
Must first begin in me
I surrender, so your world can be changed.
[6x]

The change I want to see
Must first begin in me
I surrender [8x]
So your world can be changed.

[Spoken]
You are the light of the world.
Cities set on a hill cannot be hidden.
Whether you know it or not,
The world is looking at you
Because the answer that they seek
Is on the inside of You.
So I say:

[Sung]
If they're looking for You
Let them find You in me
[2x]

If they're looking for You, Jesus
Let them find You in me
[2x]

The change I want to see
Must first begin in me...
I surrender all...
