Now that we're here
Here in your presence
Humbly we bow
Speak to us now
Now that we're here
Here in your presence
We're waiting to hear from you

We're open
We're open
We're open
Speak to us now
[Repeat]

Give us your heart
Your heart for the nations
For this generation
Give us your heart
Give us your heart
For the wounded and the broken
For the widow and the orphan
Give us your heart
Give us your heart
For the lost and the dying
We hear your people crying
Give us your heart
Give us your heart
For the world that we live in
For the harvest that is waiting
Give us your heart

[Leader ad-libs]

Lord we will go
We'll go to the nations
To this generation
Lord we will go
Lord we will go
To the wounded and the broken
To the widow and the orphan
Lord we will go
Lord we will go
To the lost and the dying
We hear your people crying
Lord we will go
Lord we will go
To the world that we live
Reap the harvest that is waiting
Lord we will go

Fill us up and send us out
[Repeat]

[Leader exhorts]

I wanna live a life poured out
[Repeat]

We can change the world
