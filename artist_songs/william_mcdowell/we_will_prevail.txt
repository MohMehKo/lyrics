[Verse 1:]
We are a generation
Not satisfied with what we see
We’ve been in preparation
Now is the time for a release
No longer on the side lines
Empowered by the word of God
We have the fear within us
We are the church and we prevail

[Chorus:]
We will prevail
We will prevail
We will prevail
We will prevail
No matter what it looks like
We will prevail
Cause we walk by faith and not by sight
We will prevail
We will prevail
[repeat]

[Vamp:]
It might look one way right now
I’ve got eternity in mind
It might look one way right now
I’ve got eternity in mind
[repeat]

I’m healed
I’m Free
I’ve been delivered
I’ve been delivered

It might look one way right now
I’ve got eternity in mind
It might look one way right now
I’ve got eternity in mind

I’m healed
I’m Free
I’ve been delivered
I’ve been delivered
