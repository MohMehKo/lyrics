I can’t live
I can’t live without you
I was created to live in your presence
Can’t breathe. Can’t move.
There is no life apart from you.
[repeat]

[Chorus:]
I need you live
I need you to breath
Can’t Live without you
Can’t live without you

I need you live
I need you to breath
Can’t Live without you
Can’t live without you

I need you live
I need you to breath
Can’t Live without you
Can’t live without you
