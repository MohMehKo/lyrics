[Lead:]
Send me I'll go,
I'll go to the nations,
So the whole world will know,
Your love and compassion,
The harvest is ready,
Your people are hungry,
To know you,

Send me I'll go
Oh, oh, oh, oh [repeat]

[Chorus:]
Send me I'll go,
I'll go to the nations,
So the whole world will know,
Your love and compassion,
The harvest is ready,
Your people are hungry,
To know you,

Send me I'll go
Oh, oh, oh, oh [repeat]

[Lead:]
Give me a heart to hear the cry,
Help me to see things through your eyes,
That we can bring healing to the broken,
When we speak the words that you have spoken,

[Chorus:]
How will they hear unless we speak,
You are the only one we need,
How will they know until we go,

[Bridge:]
Send me I'll go,
(We will be the ones, who will tell the whole wide world. Search the world, I will go, I will go)
Send me I'll go,
(I will be the one who will manifest your love, feed the hungry soul, send me God)
Send me I'll go.
