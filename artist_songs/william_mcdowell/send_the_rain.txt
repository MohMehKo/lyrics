I hear the sound of revival
Deep in the hearts of your people
Send it now, we want it now
I hear the sound of revival
Deep in the hearts of your people
Send it now, we need it now

Release your glory, send your glory

We're patiently waiting for you, we need you

Now we're crying, heaven send the rain
