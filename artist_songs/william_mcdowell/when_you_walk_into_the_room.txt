When you walk into the room
Everything's changes
Darkness starts to tremble
At the light that you bring

When you walk into the room
Every heart starts burning
Nothing matters more 
Than just to sit down at your feet and worship you
Our father, we worship you

When you walk into the room
Everything's changes
Darkness starts to tremble
At the light that you bring

When you walk into the room
Every heart starts burning
Nothing matters more 
Than just to sit down at your feet and worship you
Oh, yes, we worship you ooh

We love you
We'll never stop
We can't live without you
Jesus
We love you
Can't get enough
All this is for you
Jesus
Everything's for you, Lord
This is for you, Lord

When you walk into the room
Sickness starts to vanish
And every hopeless situation
Ceases to exist

When you walk into the room
The dead begin to rise
There's resurrection in all that you do

Say we love you
Ooh
We'll never stop
We can't live without
Jesus
We love you
We can't get enough all this is for you
Jesus
We love you
We'll never stop
We can't live without you
