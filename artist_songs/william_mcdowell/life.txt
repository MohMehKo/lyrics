When I think of Your goodness
And Your loving kindness
And I know Your grace is
Giving me Life
Giving me Life

When I see Your favor
Over me I'm grateful
And I know my Savior's
Giving me Life
Giving me Life

Exceedingly Life
Abundantly
Overflowing, Overwhelming
More than I can dream
You're giving me Life

Now I believe You're for me
And I can see new mercies
Waiting for me every morning
Giving me Life
Giving me Life

Life
Exceedingly Life
Abundantly
Overflowing, Overwhelming
More than I can dream
You're giving me Life

Life
Sufficiently Life
Eternally
Overflowing, Overwhelming
More than I can dream
You're giving me Life

I've got the best life now
Living the blessed life now
I've got the best life now
Whoa oh Jesus I'm alive in You
