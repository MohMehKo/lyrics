[Chorus:]
I give myself away
I give myself away
So You can use me
I give myself away
I give myself away
So You can use me

[Verse 1:]
Here I am
Here I stand
Lord, my life is in your hands
Lord, I'm longing to see
Your desires revealed in me
I give myself away

[Verse 2:]
Take my heart
Take my life
As a living sacrifice
All my dreams, all my plans
Lord I place them in your hands

[Chorus:]
I give myself away
I give myself away
So You can use me
I give myself away
I give myself away
So You can use me

[Chorus:]
I give myself away
I give myself away
So You can use me
I give myself away
I give myself away
So You can use me
[7x]

Here I am to worship, here I am to bow down
Here I am to say that You're my God, You're altogether
lovely, altogether worthy, altogether wonderful to me.

[Bridge (7X):]
My life is not my own
To you I belong
I give myself, I give myself to You

[Chorus:]
I give myself away
I give myself away
So You can use me
