[Chorus x2:]
I give myself away
I give myself away
So You can use me
I give myself away
I give myself away
So You can use me

[Verse 1:]
Here I am
Here I stand
Lord, my life is in your hands
Lord, I'm longing to see
Your desires revealed in me

[Chorus:]
I give myself away
I give myself away
So You can use me
I give myself away
I give myself away
So You can use me

[Verse 2:]
Take my heart
Take my life
As a living sacrifice
All my dreams all my plans
Lord I place them in your hands

[Chorus x2:]
I give myself away
I give myself away
So You can use me
I give myself away
I give myself away
So You can use me

[Bridge x7:]
My life is not my own
To you I belong
I give myself, I give myself to you
