These magnetic minds cause us to align
We won't come down, we won't come down
If you want to fight the city's glow 
Come alive let it show 
We'll show you how, we'll show you how

With the rhythm of night
In the city of lights 
We dance to show 
We still can glow 
In the rhythm of night 
With the city of lights 
We dance to show 

Take me to the rhythm of night
Make it through the rhythm of night 

Passion running wild
Dancing in denial 
We are the sum
The lifeblood of 
The city's lights 
They need to glow 
This human life will make it so
We won't come down
We'll show you how

With the rhythm of night
In the city of lights 
We dance to show 
We still can glow 
In the rhythm of night 
With the city of lights 
We dance to show 

If you can't survive this spell again 
If you can't survive just let go
