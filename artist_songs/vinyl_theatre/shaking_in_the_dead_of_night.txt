It starts in my head
Now I remember love like I was young
A memory dead
Come on and give me love come on

Taking a glance
Now I remember us when we were young
Changing our plans
Come on and give me love come on

We could start, we could start
Start our slow
We could change the past
We could take this broken road

Shakin' in the dead of night
This love will keep us young

Back from the dead
It's got me shaken up and I can't control
the dreams in my head
Come on and give me love come on

Taking a chance 
A story that you heard but you never told
Maybe Romance
Come on and give me love come on

We could start, we could start,
Start our slow
We could change the past
We could take this broken road

This lonely road that brings me home now
Set fire, to all the love that we had

Oh, I feel your heartbeat now
Oh, this love will keep us young
