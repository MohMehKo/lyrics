Have I become this stranger to your love
I've changed appearances but my reflection holds the truth
Have I fallen so far from who I was
I've lost the bandages they can never hold the truth

Hide away, hide away
You creature, creature of love

There was so much I could see
But the sky fell dark as you said to me
Hide away, hide away
You creature, you creature of love

Hide away, hide away
You creature, creature of love

Am I some animal hungry eyes a wolf amongst the sheep
Do I hide as still or will you hear the nearing of my feet
I lost the dream that you'd loved who I was
I'll change appearances but you'll never love the truth

Hide away, hide away
You creature, creature of love

There's no question of my hide
I've laid it out so you can't ask
We will run to places unknown
I'll come home is all I know

Hide away, hide away
You creature, creature of love
