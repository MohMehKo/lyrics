A blindfold, I'm in a cage
Like it's my fault
Lost as the tightrope sways
Over the waterfall

Day in, day out
Can we reverse?
Day in, day out
Will you return?

You know it hurts when you fold your cards
You know we've lost, we never got that far
You know in truth, you never played your part
Yeah it hurts, yeah it hurts

You know it hurts when you fold your cards
You know you've lost, we never got that far
Yeah it hurts, yeah it hurts
Day in, day out

Death to the symphony
Heed the soldiers call
Off to a foreign place
But you go home

Day in, day out
Can we reverse?
Day in, day out
Will you return?

You know it hurts when you fold your cards
You know we've lost, we never got that far
You know in truth, you never played your part
Yeah it hurts, yeah it hurts

You know it hurts when you fold your cards
You know you've lost, we never got that far
Yeah it hurts, yeah it hurts
Day in, day out

Ooooh Ooooh Ooooh

I know I see defeat in your wild, wild eyes
And we face a sea of trials, miles high
And we can't hesitate for tired, tired lies
We can't hesitate for tired, tired lies

You know it hurts when you fold your cards
You know we've lost, we never got that far
You know in truth, you never played your part
Yeah it hurts, yeah it hurts

You know it hurts when you fold your cards
You know we've lost, we never got that far
You know in truth, you never played your part
Yeah it hurts, yeah it hurts

You know it hurts when you fold your cards
You know we've lost, we never got that far
Yeah it hurts, yeah it hurts
Day in, day out
