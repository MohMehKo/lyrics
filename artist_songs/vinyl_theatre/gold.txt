We could try, we could try
Oh but you know
We exist just to live
Body and Soul
Have we come here only for an ending?
Ask the Sky, ask the Moon
How they reflect
Someone else's own mood
I have to relate
We're the same as the two
We're someone else's image

I found, I found
My Gold
Resound, Resound
My Soul

We Loved, we learned
We Find
We live, we die
Resound

And I've seen through distant seas
Where wild nights lose gravity
So race for the shoreline
If you want more than those revered wild nights
We've expired for more

I can feel it in my bones
So much left unknown
We continue to grow old
At least I have found my Gold
