How can you say I'm not enough
How can you say I'm not enough
Well I'm not
I'm not

Well I can see you come from miles away
No more love but no more pain
The trade between the living and the dead resumes
Will you give your life to be loved
Can't you see it's not so rough
But you'll give your soul so they'll exert

Wild and young
Restless and true
I'll stay with the living, I'm not dead like you
You said we're the same yet you couldn't taste
Loss of your tongue now who have you played
I can't mute your words you're voice echoes theirs
Slip of the tongue they have you in snares

Your walking in parade you march their way
Could not join for it seems
You found me to, to be wanting
I'd be a fool too, playing this game
Well hundreds of miles can be a race
Just to join you I won't let them wait
The journey you take walks you to your grave

Wild and young
Restless and true
I'll stay with the living, I'm not dead like you
You said we're the same yet you couldn't taste
Loss of your tongue now who have you played
I can't mute your words you're voice echoes theirs
Slip of the tongue they have you in snares

How can you say I'm not enough
How can you say I'm not enough
Well I'm not
Well I'm not
