There we were, in the street
Chasing shadows aimlessly
We'd disappear light was gone
We were those shadows all along

I close my eyes just to see
You were right in front of me
You seemed to be real in this dream

Well I awake, just to find
You were right by my side
Will you take your leave and go home

Will dreaming find you way home
With all the things that we know

And we believed you'd never know
If you never try that's true
But the passion of our youth's gone

Lay your head down, lay your head down
You can find rest, you can find rest
Lay your head down, lay your head down

Every time you stood with me
I felt my knees weakening
And seeing that you're the only cure
And my weakness you'd ensure

Oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh

Well I awake, just to find
You were right by my side
Will you take your leave and go home

Will dreaming find you way home
With all the things that we know

And we believed you'd never know
If you never try that's true
But the passion of our youth's gone

Lay your head down, lay your head down
You can find rest, you can find rest
Lay your head down, lay your head down
