Summer what you do to me
I need to think, I need to sleep

But time won't wait for you or me
I need to plan my heart's retreat

Take take it all
Take take it all

Everlasting ecstasy replaces sensibility
With replicas on every street
I seem to feed my heart's defeat

Take take it all,
Take take it 

I know I'm blacking out (blacking out)
I'm blacking out, leaving now
I am never ever coming home

Sun it shines like summer's eyes
It brings me back every time
But I can't live if it's a lie
So I begin to compromise

Take take it all,
Take take it 

I dreamed I dreamed it all
I still cannot wake up
The nights they glow
Attracting souls
Attracting souls

I know I'm blacking out (blacking out)
I'm blacking out, leaving now
I am never ever coming home

I'm blacking out (blacking out)
I'm blacking out, leaving now

I'm blacking out (blacking out)
I'm blacking out, leaving now

There's no spell on me I swear
But I still feel so damn impaired
Something in that summer sky
bringing me to my demise

I know I'm blacking out (blacking out)
I'm blacking out, leaving now
I'm never ever coming home

I'm blacking out (blacking out)
I'm blacking out, leaving now
I'm blacking out (blacking out)
I'm blacking out, leaving now
