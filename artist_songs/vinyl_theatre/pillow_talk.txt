Oh my dear I never thought
You'd ever love me, ever love me
And through the years I've grown a fear
From ones above me, ones above me

I never thought you'd choose
To be addicting me as I'm addicting you
And never thought you'd choose

You talk, talk, talk like you've never been with someone, someone
You talk, talk, talk like you never ran from someone, someone

Oh my dear just stay the nigh
And claim you love me, claim you love me
Tomorrow as the sun despise
You'll see the true deep, see the true deep

I never thought you'd choose
To count your dream that would never be true
I never thought you'd choose

You talk, talk, talk like you've never been with someone, someone
You talk, talk, talk like you never ran from someone, someone

I should never have brought you here
Disguised as someone that I hold dear
And your eyes could tell me a thousand words
They lie to convince you must be hurt
I should never have brought you here
Disguised as someone that I hold dear

You talk, talk, talk like you've never been with someone
You talk, talk, talk like you've never been with someone
