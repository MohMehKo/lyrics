Remember me as I descend
Into this darkness I have met
I know it's taken better men
but I'll fight to the bitter end

Remember how the night's adore,
When courage runs its mouth some more
Take me to that bitter end
I'll fight to the end
(Shakes me lately)

Take me home we can be alone, be alone
I know I'm sinking like a stone
Take me home we can be alone

Take a look we're crumbling
Tired and still stumbling
the night has taken better men
but I'll fight 'til the end.

Can't you see my heart still racing
Your hand in mine once more
Never lasts but, everlasting thoughts
Shake me lately.

Take me home we can be alone, be alone
I know I'm sinking like a stone
Take me home we can be alone

I need your love but I need you too
There's a place that we can run to
I need your love
Oh
So take your time before I take you,
To a place that we can run to
I need your love
Oh

Take me home we can be alone, be alone
I know I'm sinking like a stone
Take me home we can be alone

Take me home
Take me home
Be alone
Be alone
