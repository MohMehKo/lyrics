She takes off my shirt, using her words
She makes my heart start to shake
I need to leave, she can't come with me
She makes my heart start to shake

And I couldn't wait for this ghost town to burn
I'll take her away, and never return
But I can't remain here in my Earthly form
I said, "You must stay as I must move on."

And we could fly away
To a far off place
Tokyo, Tokyo, oh
Tokyo, Tokyo, oh
Fly off like a bird
Never to return
Tokyo, Tokyo, oh
Tokyo, Tokyo, oh

She takes all my words, I cannot be heard
She makes my heart start to shake
Into the unknown, within my soul
She makes my heart start to shake

And I couldn't wait for this ghost town to burn
I'll take her away, and never return
But I can't remain here in my Earthly form
I said, "You must stay as I must move on."

And we could fly away
To a far off place
Tokyo, Tokyo, oh
Tokyo, Tokyo, oh
Fly off like a bird
Never to return
Tokyo, Tokyo, oh
Tokyo, Tokyo, oh

Like a fire, like a fire, we can burn this town
Like a fire, like a fire, we can burn this town
Like a fire, like a fire, we can burn this town to the ground
Like a fire we can burn this town.

And we could fly away
To a far off place
Tokyo, Tokyo, oh
Tokyo, Tokyo, oh
Fly off like a bird
Never to return
Tokyo, Tokyo, oh
Tokyo, Tokyo, oh

Take it off! Take it off, oh!
Take it off! Take it off, oh!
My dear, you have no fear
Take it off! Take it off, oh!
Take it off! Take it off, oh!
My dear, you have no fear
Take it off! Take it off, oh!
Take it off! Take it off, oh!
My dear, you have no fear
