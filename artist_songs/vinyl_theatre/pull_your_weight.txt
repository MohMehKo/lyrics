I felt the weight of your world 
as it crashed down into my mind
I felt the weight of your burdens 
like they're all mine

Listen up, I won't lie
Nobody likes it when you call them out
Loaded gun fires tonight
Nobody likes it when you call them out

Suddenly, I wanted to change
But I won't I won't
Just to save you
Suddenly, I wanted to change
But I won't I won't
Pull your weight, no
I won't I won't
Pull your weight, no
I won't I won't
Pull your weight

It takes a concrete will to
Take the ripples of life
But your heart wasn't open 
so it floods mine

Listen up, I won't lie
Nobody likes it when you call them out
Loaded gun fires tonight
Nobody likes it when you call them out

Suddenly, I wanted to change
But I won't I won't
Just to save you
Suddenly, I wanted to change
But I won't I won't
Pull your weight, no
I won't I won't
Pull your weight, no
I won't I won't
Pull your weight

I can't remember my body's weight
I can't remember the way it felt
I still remember my mother's face
Lost faith in my father's health
So I shot down all of my fears so I could
See how my body felt
And I shot down all of my fears so I could
See how my body felt
And I shot down all of my fears so I could
See how my body felt
And I shot down all of my fears so I could
See how my body felt

Suddenly, I wanted to change
But I won't I won't
Just to save you
Suddenly, I wanted to change
But I won't I won't
Pull your weight, no
I won't I won't
Pull your weight, no
I won't I won't
Pull your weight
Pull your weight
Pull your weight
