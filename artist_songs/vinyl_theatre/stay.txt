I made a deal with the devil
To feel alive again
I may lose my soul
At least I did know the consequence

I could never run from the things that I have done
I'm wrong to even try

There's this electric feeling I take home
When I leave for the night I'm not so alone
This electric feeling I can't own
When I leave for the night

Stay, Stay, Stay, Now this will haunt me
Stay, Stay, Stay, I feel my heart beat
Shake, Shake, Shake, Now this will haunt me
Stay, Stay, Stay

I made a pact with a man dressed in black
He told me with a smile
You may lose your soul
At least you will know the consequence

I feel it underground coming for me now
I can feel it
But I won't take that road
