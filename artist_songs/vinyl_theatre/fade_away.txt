I know I spent too many days
On my floor thinking of ways
I can become, become enough
And my heart couldn't be saved,
The cigarette it's burning away
Can I become, become enough?

I'm getting older nice to know ya,
My blood is getting thinner in this air
I'm getting closer like a soldier, to the end
There's no time for us to fail, we still turn to dust

Fade away, fade away
Fade away, fade away

A crooked house is all that remains
Of the mind that I can't maintain
I can't breathe with these windows shut
Wouldn't it be nice if everything would fade away
Wouldn't it be nice if everything would fade

I'm getting older nice to know ya,
My blood is getting thin in this air
I'm getting closer like a soldier, to the end
There's no time for us to fail, we still turn to dust

Fade away, fade away
Fade away, fade away

I won't call it waiting on the sun to shine,
All my hopes are hanging on a deadline
I won't call it waiting on the sun to shine
(Waiting on the sun to shine)

I'm getting older nice to know ya,
My blood is getting thin in this air
I'm getting closer like a soldier, to the end
We know all of us could fail but we said none of us, oh none of us
There's no time for us to fail we soon turn to dust, turn to dust

Fade away, fade away
Fade away, fade away
Fade away, fade away
Fade away, fade away
Fade away, fade away
Fade away, fade away
