It gets bad
But the hardest part was waking you up again
Don't you wanna know
Where the end of science begins

But there's these infinite possibilities lost stars black holes
All a symphony unexplored
But you're just so sure you got it figured out

So have we hit the limit
With everything defined
We got ourselves in a bind
I wanna know where we go
20 years from now
Will we see a future
Built by new machines

Built by new machines
Built by new machines

And we stand 
On the shoulders of giants
Trying to reach the great unknown
And it's madness looking for
The end of science to begin

Cause there's these infinite possibilities lost stars black holes
All a symphony unexplored
But you're just so sure you got it figured out

So have we hit the limit
With everything defined
We got ourselves in a bind
I wanna know where we go
20 years from now
Will we see a future
Built by new machines

Built by new machines
Built by new machines

Flooded in the sky
These secrets left untold
Scholars lost to time
Ideas overthrown
Flooded in the sky
These secrets left untold
Scholars lost to time
Ideas overthrown
Secrets left untold

So have we hit the limit
With everything defined
We got ourselves in a bind
I wanna know where we go
20 years from now
Will we see a future
Built by new machines

Built by new machines
Built by new machines
Built by new machines
Built by new machines
