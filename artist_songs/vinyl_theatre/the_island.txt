I can't make it if we can't take this across the line
Across the line
There's an old rusted myth, get freed from the grip of a common mind
Of the common mind

Nobody knows exactly what color your eyes...
Nobody knows exactly where you will run to

Welcome to the island
No matter what your hiding
Welcome to the island
It sets you free 
On the island
Let your secrets sleep

Stumbled by chance
That dangerous dance 
When you walk the line
When you walk the line
Trip to the sun
Proverbial run to the golden life
To the golden life

Where nobody knows exactly what color your eyes are...
And nobody knows exactly where you will run to
You will run to

Welcome to the island
No matter what your hiding
Welcome to the island
It sets you free 
On the island
Let your secrets sleep

Don't cast me out yet
Don't deal me out again
I'm just a simple kid with a simple life trying to get out

Don't cast me out yet
Don't deal me out again
I'm just a simple kid with a simple life trying to get out
Trying to get out

Welcome to the island
No matter what your hiding
Welcome to the island
It sets you free 
On the island
Let your secrets sleep

Welcome to the island
No matter what your hiding
Welcome to the island
It sets you free 
On the island
Let your secrets sleep
