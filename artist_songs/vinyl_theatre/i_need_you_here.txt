I retraced all my steps 
with mistakes to find 
doubting with every step 
the map in my mind

oh, don't change a thing 
there's no harm in being wrong here 
oh, don't change a thing 
there's no harm in being wrong here
but, I need you here 
I need you closer 
I need you here 
I need you closer

I see the truth display 
through flickering lights 
deciphering our love's grace 
won't bring it to life

oh, don't change a thing 
there's no harm in being wrong here 
oh, don't change a thing 
there's no harm in being wrong here
there's a way out
but, I need you here 
I need you closer 
I need you here 
I need you closer

I found the memories of me erased within your mind 
but you'll never see what it's done to me 
I'm locked away from all your thoughts 
I never did belong, but you cannot say 
your heart I'll betray
but, I need you here 
I need you closer 
I need you here 
I need you closer
