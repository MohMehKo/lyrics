You've got a funny way of hanging around
A thief in the modern age of rhythm and sound
Take me to another place where clarity's found
'Cause all I hear is noise

It's breaking up my bones
I wanna lie, but I don't care to try
We're taking off
We're taking off, baby
We're taking off

It's breaking up my bones
I wanna lie, but I don't care to try
We're taking off
We're taking off, baby
I know you know

You found another way to keep me around
I dreamt of a thousand ways to alter the sound
A thief in the modern age of rhythm and sound
But all I hear is noise

It's breaking up my bones
I wanna lie, but I don't care to try
We're taking off
We're taking off, baby
We're taking off

It's breaking up my bones
I wanna lie, but I don't care to try
We're taking off
We're taking off, baby
I know you know

So many times we're staring down the barrel of a gun
I know you care these open eyes stare
So many times we're staring down the barrel of a gun
I know you care these open eyes stare

It's breaking up my bones
I wanna lie, but I don't care to try
We're taking off
We're taking off, baby
We're taking off

It's breaking up my bones
I wanna lie, but I don't care to try
We're taking off
We're taking off, baby
I know you know

It breaks up my bones
This breaks up my bones
It breaks up my bones
