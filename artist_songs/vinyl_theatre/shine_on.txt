(shine on, shine)

What you are, what you are now
What you are, what you want to be
I could not break my promise to you
There's a sudden change in sound
Cascading words that drown you out like a tidal wave

Like diamonds, we're built with time
We've come a long way to change our minds
Like diamonds, we're built with time
We've come a long way, it's such a long way

Shine on, shine, up and up we go
To the back, to the back we'll run
Shine on, shine, up and up we go
To the back, to the back we'll run

What I am, what I am now
I'm a man of something more
I could not break my promise to you

There's a constant running thought
That teaches what we ought to be
But we'll break away

Like diamonds, we're built with time
We've come a long way to change our minds
Like diamonds, we're built with time
We've come a long way, it's such a long way

Shine on, shine, up and up we go
To the back, to the back we'll run
Shine on, shine, up and up we go
To the back, to the back we'll run

Like diamonds, we're built with time
We've come a long way to change our minds
Like diamonds, we're built with time
We've come a long way, it's such a long way

Shine on, shine, up and up we go
To the back, to the back we'll run
Shine on, shine, up and up we go
To the back, to the back we'll run
