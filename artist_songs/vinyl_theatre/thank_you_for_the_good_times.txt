It won't be long till you find someone new
Use one more song of truth to put us to sleep for good

We walk the same ground and make the same sound
Nothing ever is new
We walk the same road put on the same show
Nothing ever is new

Thank you for the good times, good times
Now we're closing our eyes, our eyes
Thank you for the good times, good times, oh

This all belongs to you and everything I do
I've given up the gun now my pride and my youth

We ran this whole town straight into the ground
Nothing ever is new
We ran an empire but now it's on fire
Nothing ever is new

Thank you for the good times, good times
Now we're closing our eyes, our eyes
Thank you for the good times, good times, oh

And I cannot sing, cannot scream loud enough for my cadence
And if I have [?] they rip through the pages
So I yeah I'm forced to say goodbye, to say goodbye

It won't be long till you find someone new
