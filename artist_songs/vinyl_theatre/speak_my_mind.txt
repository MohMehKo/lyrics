I got my new mind set on a shelf
Afraid to use it now
I never keep my head straight cause it's loose
Never talk cause it's no use
My brain says "quiet down", quiet now
But I seem to take the hits straight to my chest
Mad of chainmail, yeah, at best
But it's no good in these modern days

Oh, maybe I'll escape
This prison in my headspace

If I just speak my mind
Speak my mind
If I just speak my mind
Speak my mind

But I always get so tongue-tied on the truth
Too afraid of getting bruised
These thoughts get louder now
Make a sound
Tends to bring my heart rate through the roof
Hesitating on my ruse
Don't you quiet down
Make a sound

Oh, maybe I'll escape
This prison in my headspace

If I just speak my mind
Speak my mind
If I just speak my mind
Speak my mind
If I just speak my mind...

I see it in my head
This vision of heaven
I'm biting my tongue once again
Oh, tossing and turning
But nobody's listening
I don't want to sleep like this

Oh, maybe I'll escape
This prison in my headspace
Oh, maybe I'll escape
This prison in my headspace

If I just speak my mind
Speak my mind
If I just speak my mind
Speak my mind

If I just speak my mind
If I just speak my mind
If I just speak my mind
