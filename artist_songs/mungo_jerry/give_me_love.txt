You gotta give, give a little,
Beg, beg a little,
You gotta borrow, borrow a little,
Hold me baby, hold me tight,
Treat me right, when you're giving me love

You gotta hold me every morning,
Squeeze me every night,
Hold me, please me baby,
And squeeze me oh so tight,
Love me for tomorrow when you're givin' me love

I said baby, baby all alone,
So tired been this way since you've been gone,
Well I love you pretty baby,
Please come back home.
