We can't work it on a Monday, we can't work every day
Your Mama don't mind, your Papa don't mind, that's true
but we can't pay the rent, and we're livin' on pigeon stew

We got so much aggravation, rent man's knockin' at the door
Let him inside, baby it's up to you,
Well, we can't pay the rent, and we're livin' on pigeon stew

Can you hear him?, can you hear him? knockin' on a-the door
Let him inside, I don't think he'll go back home
Well, we can't pay the rent, and we're livin' on pigeon stew.
