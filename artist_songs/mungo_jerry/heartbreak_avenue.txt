(Run, run, run, run, run, run, run,
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run)

When you're looking for someone, I will come to you,
When you're needing somebody, I will run to you,
When you're needing somebody to be by your side,
When you are in trouble I will be there to dry your eyes

[Chorus:]
And I will come to you, I will be there,
I will run to you, I will be there,
Yes I will, yes I will, yes I will, yes I will,
I will run to you.

When you're needing somebody on the darkest night,
When you're needing somebody to make things alright,
When you feel like a stranger in a stranger's land,
When you are in danger I'll be there just to lend a hand.

[Repeat Chorus]

I see a dog who could not bark, I feel a danger after dark,
And it's late in the afternoon on Heartbreak Avenue.

[Repeat Chorus]
