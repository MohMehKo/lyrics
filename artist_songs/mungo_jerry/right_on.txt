Right on, right on, right on, right on,
Right on, right on, right on

We're gonna kill, we're gonna fight, we're gonna fight for what is right,
Fight for the rest, its dynamite, fight the fight the fight the fight,

Right on, right on, right on, right on,
Right on, right on, right on

We're gonna take, ain't gonna wait, make no mistake, ain't gonna break,
Ain't gonna wait, no mashed potato,

Right on, right on, right on, right on,
Right on, right on, right on

We're gonna love our mother, love our father, love our sister and our brother,
Love our friends and relations, we're gonna heal the punks and rock our nation,

Right on, right on, right on, right on,
Right on, right on, right on.
