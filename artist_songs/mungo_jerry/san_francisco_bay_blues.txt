I got the blues from my baby down by San Francisco Bay
She took the ocean liner she's gone so far away
Well I didn't mean to treat her so bad
She was the best looking girl I ever had
She said goodbye, make me cry, I'm gonna lay down and die

Well I ain't got a nickle I ain't got a lousy dime
If she don't come back I think I'm gonna lose my mind
If she ever comes back to stay, there's gonna be a brand new day
Walking with my baby down by the San Francisco Bay

I'm sitting down and looking through my back door
Just a wondering which way to go
Woman I'm so crazy for says she don't love me no more
Think I'll take me a freight train
Because I'm feeling blue
Ride on the back to the end of the line
A thinking only of You well meanwhile I'm sitting in the city
Just about to go insane
The woman I'm so crazy 'bout, wondering if she call my name
If she ever comes back to stay, there gonna be a brand new day
A walking with my baby by the San Francisco Bay.
