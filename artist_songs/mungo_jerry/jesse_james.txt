Now Jesse James was a man who killed many men,
He robbed the Glendale train,
All the folks from round about said, "Yes, without a doubt, it was robbed by Frank and Jesse James"

[Chorus:]
Jesse had a wife to mourn for his life,
Three children they were so brave,
But that dirty little coward that shot him, Mr Ford,
And he laid Jesse James in his grave

It was on a Wednesday night when the moon was shining bright,
That I robbed the Glendale train,
All the folks from round about said, "Yes, without a doubt, it was robbed by Frank and Jesse James"

[Repeat Chorus]

It was on a Wednesday night when the moon was shining bright,
Jesse was talking to his family brave,
When along came Robert Ford like a thief in the black,
And he shot Jesse James in the back
