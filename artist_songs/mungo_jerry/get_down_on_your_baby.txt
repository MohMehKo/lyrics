If your baby puts you down, every time you joy ride,
If she makes you feel so small, let her know that you're no fool,
Get down on your bike, Get down on your bike
Get down on your bike, Get down on your bike

If your baby can't sleep at night, supplement your appetite,
If she's orders if she's cries, don't forget that you're the guy
Get down on your bike, Get down on your bike
Get down on your bike, Get down on your bike
Get down on your baby

Show that girl that you can ride, let her know you'll never stop,
Move so fast, ride so hard, take that woman by the hand,
Get down on your bike, Get down on your bike,
Get down on your bike,

[Repeat first verse]

Get down on your bike, Get down on your baby,
Get down on your baby, Get down on your bike,
Get down, get down, get down, get down
On your baby, your baby, your baby, your baby
