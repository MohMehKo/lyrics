When the party is over, the whisky's all run dry,
It's five o'clock in the morning, the folks have said goodbye,
Baby says she loves me, the music's playing low,
We're lying on the sofa, having one last smoke,
Sometimes I like relaxin' Sometimes I like to be a quiet man

When work has been quite heavy, sweatin' all day long,
It's great to have a shower, Or drink, nice, and long
Catch the late night movie, just my girl and me,
Take a little stroll, no-one on the streets
Sometimes I like relaxin' Sometimes I like to be a quiet man

I like my share at ball games, sometimes I like a fight,
I really dig those nightclubs, big sounds and them strobe lights,
Cruisin' through the city, with the radio on real loud,
But sometimes I really need, to get away from all the crowds

The weekends can be hectic, when all the folks drop in,
Especially when it's hot, and we go down to the beach,
But if you don't say it, Sometimes You wanna pass,
It's good to stick together, who knows how long it'll last
It's nice to slow down sometimes, it can be good to be a quiet man

I like my share at ball games, sometimes I like a fight,
I really dig those nightclubs, big sounds and them strobe lights,
Cruisin' through the city, with the radio on real loud,
But sometimes I really need, to get away from all the crowds

[Repeat first verse]

It's nice to slow down sometimes, it can be good to be a quiet man
Yeah sometimes I like to be a quiet man
