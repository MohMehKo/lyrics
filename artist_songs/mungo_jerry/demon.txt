There's been a whole lot of trouble in the place where I've been
It's bothered the king and it's upset the queen
The knaves have been playing with the princesses' maid
The jester's been running 'round the courtyard again.

And I've been cryin', someone's lying
I'm relying on my mind
I'm not forgivin', I've stopped living
There's a demon and it's gonna be stopped
Because it's got everyone on the run.

The owls are all hootin' and no one can sleep
The shepherds are worrying 'cause they're losin' their sheep
The soldiers are marching with their steel sticks of war
People are runnin' and they can't take no more

And I've been cryin', someone's lying
I'm relying on my mind
I'm not forgivin', I've stopped living
There's a demon and it's gonna be stopped
Because it's got everyone on the run.

The icebox is steaming, the oven is cold
The moon’s turned yellow, the sun's turned to stone
The windmill's stopped turning, the flowers won't grow
The taps have stopped running and the clocks have gone slow.

And I've been cryin', someone's lying
I'm relying on my mind
I'm not forgivin', I've stopped living
There's a demon and it's gonna be stopped
Because it's got everyone on the run.

Ohhh …

The icebox is steaming, the oven is cold
The moon’s turned yellow, the sun's turned to stone
The windmill's stopped turning, the flowers won't grow
The taps have stopped running and the clocks have gone slow.

And I've been cryin', someone's lying
I'm relying on my mind
I'm not forgivin', I've stopped living
There's a demon and it's gonna be stopped
Because it's got everyone on the run.
