She wears skirts that show her thighs,
O Maggie, come along and spent some time,
O Maggie, come along and spent some time, with me 

I like Sue, she's alright,
I'm gonna see my Maggie tonight,
O Maggie, come along and spent some time,
O Maggie, come along and spent some time, with me 

I like Sue, Rose is better,
I'm gonna write my Maggie a letter,
O Maggie, come along and spent some time,
O Maggie, come along and spent some time, with me 

I like Sue, she's gone to my head,
I like Maggie 'cause she's better in bed,
O Maggie, come along and spent some time,
O Maggie, come along and spent some time, with me 

Oh Maggie, come along and spent some time,
Oh Maggie, come along and spent some time,
Oh Maggie, come along and spent some time
