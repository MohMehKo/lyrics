Well You may go to college, You may got to school
You may have a pink Cadillac, but don't you be nobody's fool

[Chorus:]
Well baby come back baby come back baby come back
Come back baby I want to play house with you

Well there is one thing baby, that I want you to know
Come on back to me little girl, so we can act like we did before

[Chorus]

Well listen to me baby, what I'm talking about
Come on back to me little girl, so we can play some house

[Chorus]
