It's the simple things that I do makes me feel so good
Like driving real fast in my car when I take off the hood
Feel the wind in your hair, yeah, baby, it sure feels good.

I woke up this morning, felt something on my mind
And I went to the doctor, there was nothing he could find
Went and saw my woman, made me feel alright.

And we went for a walk in the park til the sun went down
Took a stroll through the street and we looked at the shops in the town
We went to a club and we danced to some wonderful sounds.

It's the simple things that I do makes me feel so good
Like driving real fast in my car when I take off the hood
Feel the wind in your hair, yeah, baby, it sure feels good.
