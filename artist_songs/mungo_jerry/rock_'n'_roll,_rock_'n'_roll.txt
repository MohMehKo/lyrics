[Chorus:]
Rock'n'Roll, Rock'n'Roll, Rock'n'Roll, Rock'n'Roll,
Rock'n'Roll, Rock'n'Roll, Rock'n'Roll, Rock'n'Roll,
Life is just another rock'n'roll song, one day you're up then you're g-g-g-g-g-gone.

James Dean, Elvis, they're all gone, they lived their life like a rock'n'roll song,
John Lennon, Morrison, and Monroe, ain't here but their legends still grow,
Life is just another rock'n'roll song, one day you're up and then you're gone.

[Repeat Chorus]

Read the papers and I've seen the news, just about everyone's got the blues,
They don't know that life is just a rock'n'roll song, one day you're up then you're gone,
Life is just another rock'n'roll song, one day you're up then you're gone.

[Repeat Chorus]
