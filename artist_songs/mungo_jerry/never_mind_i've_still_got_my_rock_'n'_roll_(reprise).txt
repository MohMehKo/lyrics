Here I am flying in the sky,
Nothing's like it used to be
Super jets, paper serviettes,
Safety is a certainty,

Never mind, I've still got my rock 'n' roll

Fancy shoes, leather ain't so real,
Tapping on the paving stones
Plastic flowers on the window sill,
Never thought that they would grow

Never mind, I've still got my rock 'n' roll
