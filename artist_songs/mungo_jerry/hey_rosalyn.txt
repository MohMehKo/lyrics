Hey Rosalyn, hey Rosalyn.

Woman with the beautiful eyes
I don't have to hear your lies
You're going with another man
I saw you late last night
He ain't no music man
I can't stop crying, you've gone and left me all alone.

Hey Rosalyn.

Why did you have to go
And leave the travelling show?
And go with the bearded man
Whose house is full of gold
Now I have to sing on my own
Rosalyn, I need you, I just wanted you to know.

Hey Rosalyn.

My eyes are set in deep
At night I cannot sleep
I sit down on the rocks
You're lucky charm I keep
Watching the sun going down
Wishing I could hold you, run my fingers through your hair.

Hey Rosalyn.

I cry for the girl whose gone
But I must carry on
Playing in the travelling show
Singing the sad sad songs
I'm just a music man
Hoping that I'll find her before my body gets too old.
