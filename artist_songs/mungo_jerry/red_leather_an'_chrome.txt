I went to a party, I was standing in the corner,
Saw a pretty woman and my eyes began to water,
Thought I'd take a chance so I asked her for a dance,
Red leather and chrome,
Well she had long legs, long hair, dark eyes,
She wriggled and she giggled leaving nothing to surprise,
I never let her outta my sight,
We stayed together for the rest of the night,

[Chorus:]
She had red leather and chrome, I just can't leave her alone,
Red leather and chrome, I can't leave her alone.

Well, we did some fingerpopping and a little bit of bopping,
I squeezed my little darling and her face was really rocking,
She wriggled and she giggled leaving nothing to surprise,
Red leather and chrome,
The band was getting hotter, they played a brand new rocker,
My girl was moving faster and my heart was beating harder,
I never let her outta my sight, we stayed together and it sure was a delight,

[Repeat Chorus]
