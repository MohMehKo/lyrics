Well I don't know what to do about my Mummy
'Cos she's been on the bottle all day long
I don't know what to do about my Mummy
'Cos she's been on the bottle all day long
I called the doctor 'round this morning, said I give you warning
She'd better leave that whisky alone
Well now Daddy went and left us last summer
That's when Mummy took that bottle off the shelf
I found her on the floor, crying out for more
She don't know what to do with herself
I called the doctor 'round this morning, said I give you warning
She'd better leave that whisky alone
Well now Daddy went and left us last summer
That's when Mummy took to drinking all day long
She started on the wheat things, and went on to the sweet things
Now she's drinking something that's real strong
I called the doctor 'round this morning, said I give you warning
She'd better leave that whisky alone
Well, you better leave that whisky alone
Well, she'd better leave that whisky, better leave that whisky
Better leave that whisky alone
I called the doctor 'round this morning, said I give you warning
She'd better leave that whisky alone
