I was comin' to see you down by the water side
Hopin' you'd still be my friend
I got to the corner and stopped for a soda
Wish I could see you again.

Hours are driftin', my thoughts gettin' mistin'
Caught like a lion in a pen
You can still find me at work in the library
Wish I could see you again.

I been a long time out in the countryside
Castin' my rod and my line
Fishing the river, be a forgiver
Wish I could see you again.

River rock the boat, throw my overcoat over, sit by my side
Said we could do this again
Never mind the wind, blowin' out your hair, sit in a rockin' chair
Wish I could see you again.

I was comin' to meet you outside your mother's place
Hopin' to see you again
I got to the corner and stopped for a soda
Hope you will still be my friend.
