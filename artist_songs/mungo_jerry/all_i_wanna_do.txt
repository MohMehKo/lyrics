Travelling through the hills, searching for those fast car thrills,
See the wind, the wind is blowing in her hair,
Speeding through the night, just another fast car flight,
Music playing electric rhythms in the air.

[Chorus:]
All I wanna do is have the love of a girl like you,
When you let me ride, you're gonna let me go,
Only wanna be is with your soft skin touching me,
When you let me ride, you're gonna let me go.

Thinking of romance, a whirling, twirling gypsy dance,
Camp-fire burning, strumming on a warm guitar,
Spinning out of reach, two naked lovers, a deserted beach,
It's a dream, conjures up a long ago

[Repeat chorus:]
