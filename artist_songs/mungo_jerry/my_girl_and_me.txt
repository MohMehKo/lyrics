Oh, wait, till the sun‘s goin’ down
Then we'll go walkin' down by the sea
It's been a long time for my girl and me.

Take a trip down by the shore
Throwing stones out across the beach
It's been a long time for my girl and me.

Well, ain't no use just sittin' ‘round at home drinking and watching TV, no it ain't
Oh, got to get out in the air, walk for a spell, hand in hand, just her and me
It’s been a long time since the party where we met, danced all night, my girl and me.*

Well, our dog's pretty small and fluffy but it sure run's fast when I throw the ball
Up and down the beach, my girl is laughin', hair's in her eyes, she blows me a kiss across the shore, mimes she loves me
Sun's disappearing now, might as well go back home, get in the car, go for a ride, yeah.

Turn the key and the engine roars
Ah, make a signal, find a gear
There's a highway for my girl and me.

Through the town, where the lights are bright
Ah, to the country, into the night
Find a quiet spot and we make it right.

Ah, far from the noise of the bars and the traffic we ride, that's where we go
Ah, to look down from the hills at the sea and the valleys below
Ah, there's boats in the harbour and people makin' their way home.

Well, we stop for a while, hand in hand, as we walk from the car
Oh, she kisses my cheek and tells me she'll always be mine, yes she will
Oh, the night's nearly day as I drive her back home to her ma.
