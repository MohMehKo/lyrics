The rain fell on my window, the wind was at my door,
I tried to light my fire, I was feelin' mighty cold,
My woman gone an' left me, to look after myself,
I thought I'd hit the city, I don't want no one else,

Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh,
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh,
I thought I'd hit the city, don't want no one else 

Made a cup of coffee, smoked my last cigarette,
I put on my big coat, never paid no rent,
Trudging through the puddles, water's got my shoes,
In my head's a sad song, guess I've got the blues,

Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh,
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh,
In my head's a sad song, guess I've got the blues 

Sky was gettin' greyer, day was drawin' in,
Got myself a paper, light was pretty dim,
Stood up on the bridge, I thought I'd drown myself,
River look real cruel, couldn't make no sense,

Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh,
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh,
River look real cruel, couldn't make no sense.
