Let's have one more for the road, just one more time before we go,
We've been living for the weekend, now I know that you're gonna leave,
Darling, just one more time, remember me.

Your empty cup, a burnt-out cigarette, a missing page in the paperback that you read,
We'll re-live this place a long time, now I know that you're gonna leave,
Just one more time, remember me.

[Chorus:]
It ain't easy, it ain't easy,
Darling, let's have one more for the road,
It ain't easy, it ain't easy,
Darling, just one more time before we go.

This was our home, this was our life, now it's just a house so it's goodbye,
To all the things that we dreamed of, to all our plans and schemes,
Just one more time, remember me.

[Repeat chorus:]
