I think about the people I've known and of the places I've been
Of all the girls that I've ever loved, I still want sweet Mary Jane.

I think about the hot summer days and of the cold mountain stream
Of quiet meadows and green apple trees and of my sweet Mary Jane.

Come with me, we'll follow the sun to a land 'cross the sea
Take my hand and I'll be your friend, oh, come with me Mary Jane.

Take my hand and I'll be your friend, oh, come with me Mary Jane, ch ch ch.
