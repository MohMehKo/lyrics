Well, everybody's talkin' 'bout my brand new car
They say they wanna ride and they wanna go far.

Oh, baby, ride in my brand new car
Won't you come on, baby, won't you ride in my brand new car?

It's got a bright red bonnet, it matches your dress
Reclining seats and black headrest.

Oh, baby, ride in my brand new car
Won't you come on, baby, won't you ride in my brand new car?

Turn the radio on, put a tape in the slot
You can light a cigarette, look at the clock.

Oh, baby, ride in my brand new car
Won't you come on, baby, won't you ride in my brand new car?

Now baby
It's got a dog in the back that nods his head
The back seat springs, yeah, just like a bed.

Oh, baby, ride in my brand new car	
Won't you come on, baby, won't you ride in my brand new car?

Disc brakes all round, power steering too
Twin carburetters, an ice box in the boot

Oh, baby, ride in my brand new car
Won't you come on, baby, won't you ride in my brand new car?

Won’t you ride in my brand new car?
Won’t you ride? We’ll drive out far
Baby, ride in my brand new car	
Won't you come on, baby, won't you ride in my brand new car?

Won’t you ride in my brand new car?
Won’t you ride? We’ll take out far
Baby, ride in my brand new car	
Won't you come on, baby, won't you ride in my brand new car?

Won’t you ride in my brand new car?
Won’t you ride in my brand new car?
Won’t you ride in my brand new car?
Won’t you ride in my brand new car?
Come on, baby, won't you ride in my brand new car?

Won’t you ride in my brand new car?
Won’t you ride in my brand new car?
Won’t you ride in my brand new car?
Won’t you ride in my brand new car?
Come on, baby, won't you ride in my brand new car?
