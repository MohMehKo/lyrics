Well, we used to go down there every Saturday night
The kids were pretty tough and they knew how to fight
Some were pretty young and some were pretty old
They knew all there was to know about rock 'n' roll
They used to pop pills, drink beer, they did no harm
The kids are alright down the Northcote Arms, ooh.

Well, the fellers wore leathers and some wore drapes
The chicks were real cool and they had what it takes
In their tight tight sweaters and their tight tight jeans
They looked real cool and the fellas looked mean
They used to pop pills, drink beer, they did no harm
The kids are alright down the Northcote Arms, yeah.

Every night when the air was getting hot
They'd move so fast you oughta see them rock
They'd go outside and jump on their bikes
Rev 'em right up and roar into the night
They used to pop pills, drink beer, they did no harm
The kids are alright down the Northcote Arms, woah.

If you get the chance to move down there
Let yourself go and let down your hair
If you wanna move to the rock 'n' roll
They'll show you how to do it, show you how it goes
They used to pop pills, drink beer, they did no harm
The kids are alright down the Northcote Arms, ooh.

They used to pop pills, drink beer, they did no harm
The kids are alright down the Northcote Arms.

They used to pop pills, drink beer, they did no harm
The kids are alright down the Northcote Arms, ooh.
