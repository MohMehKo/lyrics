Just got a letter from her, set down and read it
Just like all the others, I've had before
Brings back memories of the times we spent together
I'll be coming back to you, when the time comes
Told me how she feels, how see feels about me
Want's me to wright and say how I feel 'bout her
We sure had good times, in that short time
I'll be coming back to you, when the time comes

It won't be long, before I'm up and gone
I'll be coming back to you with all my love
We'll share our days, share our nights
Share all the things we like

When I'll be coming back to you, when the time comes
I've had other women, that I spent my time with
You've got other men, so we both know were we stand
We had good things, let's keep it going
I'll be coming back to you, when the time comes

It won't be long, before I'm up and gone
I'll be coming back to you with all my love
We'll share our days, share our nights
Share all the things we like

I've had other women, that I spent my time with
You've got other men, so we both know were we stand
We had good things, let's keep it going
I'll be coming back to you, when the time comes

It won't be long, before I'm up and gone
I'll be coming back to you with all my love
We'll share our days, share our nights
Share all the things we like
