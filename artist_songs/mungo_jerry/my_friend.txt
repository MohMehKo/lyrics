I saw that woman with the beautiful legs
I gave her the eye, yeah, here's what she said
She said: ‘My friend, everybody is my friend’
She said: ‘My friend, come and have a drink on me’.

Well, by the embankment the river was calm
The moon shone down and she held my arm
She was my friend, everybody was my friend
She said: ‘My friend, come and have a drink on me’.

I couldn’t refuse her.

I walked along with her
She was such a beauty looking woman
You know I just couldn’t refuse.
...

I took her home and she kept me warm
When I woke up all my money was gone
She was my friend, everybody was my friend
She said: ‘My friend’ - but she took every penny I had.

Oh yeah, she was my friend, everybody was my friend
She said: ‘My friend’ - but she took every penny I had, yes she did
She was my friend, everybody was my friend
She said: ‘My friend’ - but she took every penny I had.
