I remember when I was very young,
Had lot of toys and I had lots of fun, yes I did,
Playing mum's and dad's with the girls down the road,
I used to pull their hair and I used to pick my nose, yes I did,
"Didn't we all"
Now I'm getting pretty old, I like to think back to the past,
What about all the sweets we used to eat,
And the games we used to play in the park.

I remember when I was at school,
I didn't do my homework and I broke all the rules, yes I did,
Watching all the girls getting undressed in the gym,
Smoking in the toilets, beat up the little kids, yes I did,
"Didn't we all"
Now I'm getting pretty old, I know I could have done a lot more,
Like putting sugar in the headmaster's tank of his brand new Jaguar.

I remember when I was at work,
I had to wear a suit and a had my hair cut, yes I did,
Yes sir, no sir, three bags full,
The boss was a drag and work was a bore, yes It was,
"'en it all"
Now I'm getting pretty old, I like to think back to the past,
What about all the fiddles that we did and the times I got landed in the cart.

I remember my very first date,
I took her to a movie and I got her home late, yes I did,
Her father got mad so I bought him a pint,
Worst thing I ever did, now I'm lumbered for life, big mistake,
"We all make 'em"
Now I'm getting pretty old, I like to de thinks back to the past,
What about all the beer we used to drink and the chicks we used to have in the grass.

Worked very hard got promotion at work,
Got a mortgage, got a house, got a baby, got a car,
"In that order?"
"You must be joking"
Got ulcers in my stomach got false teeth and got piles,
Don't get on with the wife, could do with some
