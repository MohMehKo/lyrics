I'm keeping myself, I'm keeping myself. 
All the young ladies from everywhere, 
all the young ladies from across the world, 
we're keeping ourselves, we're keeping ourselves. 
We're keeping ourselves, we're keeping ourselves.

Lookin round now let my hair down. 
Wear my picture, yes I hit the ground. 
Not getting caught up in the temptation of love. 
I'm gonna go ahead and push myself and make myself reflect something.

I'm in the section with the VIP dealin with no DOD, 
don't have to shoot no game on me. 
Shinin like I'm platinum gold. 
My body is on hold. 
All my young people say..

I'm keeping myself, I'm keeping myself. 
All the young ladies from everywhere, 
all the young ladies from across the world, 
we're keeping ourselves, we're keeping ourselves. 
We're keeping ourselves, we're keeping ourselves.

Walk into the room they say (who the young people?). 
We're the young people from KOS and we're not tryin to deal with the extra stress. 
Don't have to walk around with a frown dealin with another clown with this impurity.

I'm in the section with the VIP dealin with no DOD, 
don't have to shoot no game on me. 
Shinin like I'm platinum gold. 
My body is on hold. 
All my young people say..

I'm keeping myself, I'm keeping myself. 
All the young ladies from everywhere, 
all the young ladies from across the world, 
we're keeping ourselves, we're keeping ourselves. 
We're keeping ourselves, we're keeping ourselves.

You don't have to walk around with your head hanging down. 
You're a prized posession, so you gotta stand your ground. 
Everybody from the north south east and the west. 
We're in this together so we won't stop for nothing less.

Put a smile on your face you're shining the place. 
You can stand tall, don't have to fall at all.

I'm in the section with the VIP dealin with no DOD, 
don't have to shoot no game on me. 
Shinin like I'm platinum gold. 
My body is on hold. 
All my young people say..

I'm keeping myself, I'm keeping myself. 
All the young ladies from everywhere, 
all the young ladies from across the world, 
we're keeping ourselves, we're keeping ourselves. 
We're keeping ourselves, we're keeping ourselves.
