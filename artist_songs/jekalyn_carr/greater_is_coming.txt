An olive has to go through three stages, for its oil to run:
It has to go through the shaking, the beating, and the pressing
And just like the olive, some of you may have felt like you go through the shaking, the beating and the pressing.
You've went through all of that for your oil to flow
Now, your greater is coming...

If it had not been for the shaking,
I never would have been ready for the making, no

If it had not been for the beating,
I would have never knew how anointed I would be.

If it had not been for the pressing,
I wouldn't be able to walk into my destiny.
He's preparing me, preparing me, preparing me for greater...

I feel a shaking in the Spirit,
I feel a beating in the Spirit,
I feel a pressing in the Spirit,
Preparing me for greater...

I feel a shaking in the Spirit,
I feel a beating in the Spirit,
I feel a pressing in the Spirit,
Preparing me for greater...

If it had not been for the shaking,
I never would have been ready for the making, no

If it had not been for the beating,
I would have never knew how anointed I would be.

If it had not been for the pressing,
I wouldn't be able to walk into my destiny.
He's preparing me, preparing me, preparing me for greater...

I feel a shaking in the Spirit,
I feel a beating in the Spirit,
I feel a pressing in the Spirit,
Preparing me for greater...

I feel a shaking in the Spirit,
I feel a beating in the Spirit,
I feel a pressing in the Spirit,
Preparing me for greater...

Many are the afflications of the righteous,
But the Lord delivereth them out,
Of them all...

Because your greater is coming...
