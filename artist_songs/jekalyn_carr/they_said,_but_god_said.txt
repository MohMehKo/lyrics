They said you couldn't have it,
But God said, "It's yours."
They said you won't make it,
But God said, "I'll open doors."
They said it was over for you,
But God said, "It has just begun."
They said you might as well give up the fight,
But God said, "The battle is already won."

They walk over,
They talk over,
Theyve pressed,
They've even lied on you.
But in the midst of all of that,
God still raise up a champion.
In the mist of the hurt,
In the midst of the pain,
In the midst of distractions,
He said you are the chosen one.

They said you will never be,
But God says, "I'm raising you for my glory."
They said you didn't have a dream, oh,
But God said, "You have purpose."
They said this problem will never end,
But God said, "I'm bringing you out,
My child." They said you might as well throw in the towel,
But God said, "This storm is just for a while."

They walk over, they talk over,
They've pressed they've even lied on you.
But in the midst of all of that,
God still raised up a champion.
In the midst of the hurt,
In the midst of the pain,
In the midst of distractions,
He said you are the chosen one.

You're gonna face hurt,
You're gonna face pain,
You're gonna face heartache and even some rain.
You're gonna have ups,
You're gonna have downs,
They may be here today but tomorrow they may not be found.
You're gonna have tears,
You're gonna be wrong,
You're gonna have fears and have to walk alone.
But you gotta know,
You are the chosen one.

Just like Nehemiah,
You're gonna have to ask God for the strength today.
Strength to make it,
Strength to take all of the time.
Cause now it's yours and push the anger down.
Just like Smason you may not understand the instruction
But you gotta obey and you gotta know if gods gonna lead you
He is going to take you all the way

You may be like Moses,
Born and raised by somebody esle but.
You gotta understand,
God's trying to give you a purpose for your life.
Just like Abraham,
You may have to walk alone and leave everything behind.
Don't worry, don't worry.
Don't worry about it cause God's got a plan for you.
In the midst of hurt,
In the midst of negativity,
In the midst of distractions,
Even he has been used.
Even though they said it,
It does not always have to be,
Cause God has the last word over your life, yeah.

You gotta know,
You gotta know you are the chosen one.
Yes, you are.
You are, you are the chosen one.

You're gonna face hurt,
You're gonna face pain,
You're gonna face heartache and even some rain.
You're gonna have ups,
You're gonna have downs,
They may be here today
But tomorrow they may not be found.
You're gonna have tears,
You're gonna be wronged,
You're gonna have fears and have to walk alone.
But you gotta know, you are the chosen one.
