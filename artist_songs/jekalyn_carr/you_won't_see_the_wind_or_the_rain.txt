You may be in a dry place right now
and it seems you can’t come out
For I have come to make a way
I’ve come to heal your pain
But you won’t feel the wind
you won’t see the rain
But oh just know
I’ll make, I’ll make a way

You may have experienced some lows
and you’ve been hurt without a cause
For I have come to make a way
I’ve come to heal your pain
But you won’t feel the wind
and you won’t see the rain
But oh just know
I’ll make, I’ll make a way

Ohhhhhhhh...

You won’t feel the wind
and you won’t see the rain
But it’s in God’s will that you shall live
your heart He will heal
But you may not feel the wind
and you may not see the rain
But you gotta know that He’s filling your valley, He’s filling your valley
All of your dry places
He’s filling it now
Even when you can’t see it
He’s filling it now
That empty heart
He’s filling it now

But you won’t feel the wind
you won’t see the rain
Everything around you may be dry
but I just want to take a moment to let somebody know
That you may not feel the wind
you may not see the rain
But you gotta know that He’s making a way
Even when you can’ feel it
even when you can’t see it
You gotta trust Him and know that He’s making a way
He’s making a way

But you won’t feel the wind
you won’t see the rain
But oh just know
I’ll make, I’ll make a way
I’ll make a way
I’ll make a way
I’m gonna do it before you know it [2x]
You gonna look around and your valley is gonna be filled [2x]

Trust in me
He says trust in me
Take your hands off of it and trust in me [2x]
Trust in me
trust in me
I will never leave you
I will never forsake you
I got your back
Trust in me
I am the God that healeth thee
and if I did it before I sure can do it again
Trust in me
I’m Jehovah Jireh let me provide for you
let me heal you
I’ll make, I’ll make, I’ll make a way
oh yes
