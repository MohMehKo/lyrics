You're bigger than the universe
You're bigger than the Sun and the stars
You're bigger than the things
That can tear me apart

You're bigger than the universe
You're bigger than the Sun and the stars
You're bigger than the things, oh my, oh my
That can tear me apart

For I know You're great in all the earth,
For I know You're great in all the earth, earth
You're bigger
Mmm, mmm

You're bigger than, the problems I've faced
You're bigger than, the disasters that I've seen
You're bigger, You're so much bigger Jesus
Than what this life may bring
Oh lordy

You're bigger than the universe, yes you are
You're bigger than the Sun and the Stars
You're bigger than the things, bigger than the things
That can tear me apart

For I know You're great in all the earth,
For I know You're great in all the earth,
For I know You're great in all the earth, earth
You're bigger
