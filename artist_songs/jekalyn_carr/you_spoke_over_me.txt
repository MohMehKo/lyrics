There were times when life, 
Got so hard
Every time I tried to pursue,
my destiny seemed so far,
I even doubted myself
It was never meant to be
My problems blocked my view
they were all that I could see.

Your ways are higher than mine,
Your thoughts are higher than mine.
So when I failed to do, you didn't give up on me. 
You spoke over me 
You spoke over me 

There was so much, negativity working against me.
So many people spoke against my success. 
Telling me I'll never make it.
Telling me I gonna fail
I may as well, leave it alone.
I realize
Through it all you looked out for me,
Stopped the hands of the enemy

You spoke over me [7x]

Even when I didn't see it
Even when I couldn't feel it
Even when I didn't know

You spoke over me [7x]

Even when I didn't see it
Even when I couldn't feel it
Even when I didn't know
[3x]

You spoke over me [7x]

Your word never fail, always showed me you care.

You spoke over me.
