I'm grateful for this place, but I won't get complacent, I won't get comfortable, I won't get settled here,
Because I know that you've got bigger for me, so today I say by faith

Something big is about to happen, something big's about to happen to me
I know it is, I feel it is, I know it is
Something big is about to happen, something big's about to happen to me
I know it is, I feel it is, I know it is

I'm in a great place, but the dreams you show me are bigger than here
I realize that I can't stay this size, for every season there is a higher dimension
I won't always be in this place, so today I say by faith

Something big is about to happen, something big's about to happen to me
I know it is, I feel it is.
Yes something big, something big is about to happen, something big's about to happen to me

Now all over the world let's make this declaration say.
I declare I am going higher, I declare I'm increasing, I declare I'm getting stronger, and my head will be down no longer.
I declare that it's getting better and I declare that it's getting greater, and I declare that I'm moving Lord I declare by faith

Something big is about to happen, something big's about to happen to me
I know it is yes, I feel it is.
Say something big is about to happen, something big's about to happen to me

Let's lift up our declaration again everybody say it.
I declare I am going higher, I declare I'm increasing, I declare I'm getting stronger, and my head will be down no longer.
I declare that it's getting better and I declare that it's getting greater, Lord I declare that I'm moving and I declare by faith

Something big is about to happen, something big's about to happen to me
I believe that this is my season for something big
Something big is about to happen, something big's about to happen to me
I believe that it's right around the corner
