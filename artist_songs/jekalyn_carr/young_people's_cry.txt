Oh, God!
This next generation need you
God, you said that in the last days you shall pour out your spirit upon all flesh.
You said that the young people shall prophesy.
And, God, the young people need you like never before.
For the enemy is on attack.

So, now, God, I pray against all type of gun violence,
I pray against the shootings that's in our schools,
I pray against suicidal thoughts,
I pray against drugs,
I pray against bullying.
And I speak over the lives of the young people, 
That they will not fall into the hands of temptation, 
The young people will get back in place with you.
They will hunger for holiness,
And the hunger will be so great that it will be unexplainable.
In the name of Jesus!

God, I declare right now that we, your young people,
We will present ourselves as living sacrifices. 
Our lives are in your hands.
We made the choice,
We made the vow right now
That, God, we will notâ€”
We will not give in to peer pressure, 
We will not give in, God, to suicidal thoughts, 
We will not give in into what the enemy has to offer.
We will not give in into the plans of the enemy,
But, God, we stand and we say we will be holy.
We will keep our bodies pure [3x]
In the name of Jesus!

We will not give in to drugs, 
We will not give in to drinking, 
We will not give in to smoking.
But, God, we will stand for holiness,
We will stand for what's right.
So, God, we cry out,
Purify us, Lord 
Purify us, Lord 
Sanctify us, cleanse us, God.
We wanna be holy,
We wanna be like you, Lord. 
We wanna be like you, Lord. 
We cry out today we give ourselves to you.
Our lives are in your hand 
Our lives are in your hand 
Oh, God, but we believe
You're raising up some planet shakers, 
You're raising up some demon slayers,
You're raising up some Satan defeaters.
And, God, we stand right now,
And we say we will be the one, 
We will be the one
That will show the enemy that he is a liar.
He will not have all the young people,
He will not have our minds,
We will be the one.
We will be the example,
We will be chosen.
In the name of Jesus [3x]

Young people, right there where you are
Just lift up your hands and begin to tell God:

God, I will be the one.
God, I will be the one.
He just wanna know if he can have a willing vessel 
He just wanna know if he have a willing vessel 
That will stand up and declare to this nation,
That will stand up and declare to this world
That God is real 
That God is real 
I will be the one
I will be the one 
Yes, Jesus!
