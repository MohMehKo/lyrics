Here are my hopes 
Here are my doubts
Here are the things that I can't figure out
Here are my storms, my crashing seas
Here are the burdens that have brought me to my knees

[Chorus:]
And I will take you at your unfailing word
More than all I want, I will seek you first
I will bless your name when the night is long
God you have my surrender [x2]

Here are my prayers, my heart will wait
I will bow my will so you can have your way
Here are the things I can't undo
I am nothing, nothing without you

[Chorus]

I cast my cares on, I cast my cares on, I cast my cares on you [x3]

[Chorus]
