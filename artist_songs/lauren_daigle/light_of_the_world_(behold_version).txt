The world waits for a miracle
The heart longs for a little bit of hope
O come, O come, Emmanuel
A child prays for peace on earth
And she's calling out from a sea of hurt
O come, O come, Emmanuel

And can you hear the angels singing

Glory to the Light of the World
Glory, the Light of the World is here

The drought breaks with the tears of a mother
A baby's cry is the sound of love
Come down, come down, Emmanuel
He is the song for the suffering
He is Messiah, the Prince of Peace has come
He has come, Emmanuel

Glory to the Light of the World
Glory, the Light of the World is here

For all who wait, for all who hunger
For all who've prayed, for all who wonder
Behold your King, behold Messiah
Emmanuel, Emmanuel

Glory to the Light of the World
Glory to the Light of the World
Glory to the Light of the World
Glory, the Light of the World is here
