I will run and not grow weary
I will walk, I will not faint
I will soar on wings like eagles
Find my rest in Your everlasting name

You are my revival
Jesus on You I wait
I'll lean on Your promise
You will renew my strength

I will run and not grow weary
I will walk, I will not faint
I will soar on wings like eagles
Find my rest in Your everlasting name

You are my revival
Jesus on You I wait
I'll lean on Your promise
You will renew my strength

Oh, You are my revival
Jesus on You I wait
I'll lean on Your promise
You will renew my strength

Oh, You are my revival
Jesus on You I wait
I'll lean on Your promise
You will renew my strength
Oh, You will renew my strength
Oh, You will renew my strength

I will run and not grow weary
I will walk, I will not faint
I will soar on wings like eagles
Find my rest in Your everlasting name

You are my revival
Jesus on You I wait
I'll lean on Your promise
You will renew my strength
