When this life has overwhelmed me
And I feel like giving up
I will cling to all You've promised
It will always be enough

When the world around me crumbles
And it's hard to understand
I will run to You, my shelter
I am safe within Your hands
Oh, you are my help forever

I will not fear
God, You are with me
I know You're near
You'll never leave me
I will trust in You alone

When I'm broken in the silence
I can hear You whispering,
"You're not alone here in these trials
I would hold you faithfully."
Oh, you are my help forever

I will not fear
God, You are with me
I know You're near
You'll never leave me
I will trust in You alone

And when my heart and strength have failed me
My God, You won't
Your name is mighty
I will trust in You alone

[3x]
You are a fortress for the weak
The strength that carries me
When I am on my knees
The cross reminds my heart to trust
Your faithfulness and love
Will always be enough 

I will not fear
God, You are with me
I know You're near
You'll never leave me
I will trust in You alone

And when my heart and strength have failed me
My God, You won't
Your name is mighty
I will trust in You alone [3x]

I will not fear
God, You are with me
I know You're near
You'll never leave me
I will trust in You alone [3x]
