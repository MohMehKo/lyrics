Oh come all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant
Oh come ye oh come ye to Bethlehem
Come and behold Him born the King of angels
Oh come let us adore Him, oh come let us adore Him
Oh come let us adore Him, Christ the Lord

Sing choirs of angels, sing in exultation
Sing all ye citizens of heav'n above
Glory to God, glory in the highest
Oh come let us adore Him, oh come let us adore Him
Oh come let us adore Him Christ the Lord

Yea Lord we greet Thee, born this happy morning
Jesus to thee be all glory giv'n
Word of the Father now in flesh appearing
Oh come let us adore Him, oh come let us adore Him
Oh come let us adore Him Christ the Lord
Oh come let us adore Him Christ the Lord
