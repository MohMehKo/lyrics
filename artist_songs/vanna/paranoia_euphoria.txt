All I do is drag my bones
In hopes of finding a home
Everyone's so dead and cold
I wasn't meant for the world

All you people are a deadly disease
That lie and cheat and burn the streets
Can't trust a single sound that's comes pouring out
Of your god damn garbage mouth
Nothing is real, I can't feel
Everything I touch you steal
Just let me leave, I can't breathe
I suggest you set me free

All I see are enemies
(They all betrayed me)
Get away, get away
(Cause they can't save me)
All I see are enemies
(They're out to get me)
Get away, get away
Get these people out of my face

A den of wolves
A pit of snakes
Everyone's out to get me

I'm being hunted but heres thing
I've survived this long for a reason
You can't kill what you can't see
So don't take your eyes off me

All I see are enemies
(They all betrayed me)
Get away get away
(Cause they can't save me)
All I see are enemies
Take me far from this place
Get away, get away
Get these people out of my face

Stuck in a rat race
Trapped in a cage
I won't be taken alive
So now you feel my rage

A den of wolves
A pit of snakes
Everyone is out to get me

If everybody's still dead and cold
Then goddamn it I'll kill the world

All I see are enemies
(They all betrayed me)
Get away, get away
(Cause they can't save me)
All I see are enemies
They're out to get me
Get away, get away
Get these people out of my face

Everyone's out to get me
