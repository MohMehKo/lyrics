We lied as we rode down (down our paths)
We tied all these loose ends (back together)

We looked to the sky for signs
For a way to relieve the masses
We kneeled in candle lit rooms
Tonight we dance, don't hold back

No, no we don't hold back

This is a toast to the ones we've lost
This is a toast
May we be reborn again

So get lost when she screams (murder!)
The devil sees you when you're walking around
So get lost when she screams (murder!)
The devil sees you when you're walking around

Sinking this ship might be
The only way of freeing our hearts
We're drowning this city away
Before we can tear it apart

Of guilt red hands
That hang beside me
This blue river
Will not wash away

Of guilt red hands
That hang beside me
This blue river
Will not wash away
