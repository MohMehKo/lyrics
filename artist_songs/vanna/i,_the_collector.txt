Hell is empty
They're surrounding us here
Back from the grave
For better or for worse you'd say
Without remorse
I am alive and living out
Living out my curse
Living my curse
Living out my curse
Living my curse

I will never breathe life again
Death is my only friend
I am the devil
That makes this hell
Will you survive
No man could tell
In my hands I hold the world (I am death)
A stage for all life stories told (the collector of life)
When you die what will be yours (I am death)
A trail of lies that will never be heard (the collector)

(In my hands I hold the world)

My words decay
With every single breath I take
So breathe in
In hopes to ruin your lungs from within

I am death collector of life
I am revenge, the thief in the night
I am death collector of life
I am revenge, the thief in the night
The thief in the night
The thief in the night

In my hands I hold the world
A stage for all life stories told
When you die what will be yours
A trail of lies that will not be heard

Living my curse
Living my curse
