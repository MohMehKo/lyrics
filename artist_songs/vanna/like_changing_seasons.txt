Call it done and easy over and over
But we'll never learn
How to slow down, how to slow down
Done, easy, over and over
But we'll never learn
How to slow down, not to slow down

Until you cower like a lie gone wrong

Just say the words and let me know
We can't survive if we both let go

There might be love buried somewhere
Far beneath our pride, it's worth finding
If you'll breathe life in it with me

You told me all that you've known are the lonely places
So let's get closer now
We're holding on to the things we need the most
Hold on as close as we can

You're pushing all the doubts
From my head like you need them
But you paint yourself the victim
You're pulling at my hand
Like you're ready to fall
But there's no stopping this at all

There's so much to say, but nothing comes out right
It's best that we leave it to our movements
We move so well, your lips speak no words
It's best that we leave it
It's best that we leave it
Behind close doors

Just say the words and let me know
We can't survive if we both let go

You told me all that you've known are the lonely places
So let's get closer now
We're holding on to the things we need the most
Hold on as close as we can

This time we'll keep it all to ourselves
We're keeping it quiet this time
We'll keep it to ourselves
Though we know this isn't right at all

You're pushing all the doubts
From my head like you need them
But you paint yourself the victim
You're pulling at my hand
Like you're ready to fall
But there's no stopping this at all
