Scarlet ribbons fall away
She let's down her hair
Polished lips that tear
Your heart from your chest
All you're looking
All you're looking for
I've found
Young love nursing an old soul

I'll lay my pride down
I am still for you
And with a heart of gold
I am still for you
I see them looking

The hearts
You've broken, their queen!
They die for you
Darling, when we dance
And you sparkle, my prize
Kiss me with that look in your eye
So they know that you're mine

Beg love!
Take mercy!
Beg love!
Take mercy!
Filthy is
Only skin deep

Mercy!
Mercy on me!

I'll lay my pride down
I am still for you
And with a heart of gold
I am still for you
You pretty thing
