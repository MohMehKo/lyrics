Now you see us, now you fucking don't
Moving in shadows is our only hope
See my friends, we are forgotten ones 
They are the bastards and we are the sons

We are the lonely ones! 

I thought I told you that 
I am who I am 
And I've got nothing to prove. 
I'm not alone here, my friends 
We all got nothing to lose

We are, we are the ones 
Running through this hollow town
Head high, feet on the ground

Broken homes won't break us down 
We dream of kingdoms and taking crowns 
You can doubt us all you want
We're taking this from the bottom, straight to the top 
STRAIGHT TO THE TOP

You're not listening
I am who I am 
And I've got nothing to prove 
I'm not alone here, my friends 
We all got nothing to lose

We are, we are the ones 
Running through this hollow town
Head high, feet on the ground

We are, we are the ones 
Running through this hollow town
Try all you want, you can't keep us down

We are the kids of heart decay 
With no future, or so you say 
We build it up and you knock it down 
Well go ahead and take a look around 

We own this town 
You and every motherfucker around 
We own this town, so go ahead and take a look around
We own this town
We own this town

Go ahead and take a look around.
Are you scared of what you found?

We are, we are the ones 
Running through this hollow town 
Head high, feet on the ground

We are, we are the ones 
Running through this hollow town 
Try all you want, you can't keep us down

We're all losers and we got nothing to prove
You're not alone my friend we all got nothing to lose
