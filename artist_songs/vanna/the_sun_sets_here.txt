Stay on your feet. 
Don’t stop. Don’t stop till you get to me. 
These are just parts that we play.
Quiet colors in quiet places.

But keep your eyes open wide. 
The moment becomes the prize. 
Before you know it. 
You’re running hand in hand in rapture. 
Keep your eyes open wide. 
The moment becomes the prize. 
Make your way to me. 
We are invincible. Tonight.

Morning never meant. More of a reason. 
To feel alive. To feel this. 
Breath in the sunset. I want to feel this. 
Running through my veins. 
We own the sky. We own the sky. 
We are invincible tonight.

We are looking back. 
On everything we used to be. 
But you’re still grabbing on. 
Holding close to me. 
I’ve spent long nights awake. 
Worrying about you.
Cause I know how hard it is for you. To feel alive.

Please tell me. Please tell me. 
How to live this moment. 
Hard enough to feel it. 
How to love every second. 
Like I’ll never need a second. 
Like I’ll never need a second again.

We are looking back. 
On everything we used to be. 
But you’re still grabbing on. 
Holding close to me. 
I’ve spent long nights awake. 
Worrying about you. 
Cause I know how hard it is for you. To feel alive again.

I’ve always said that I’m not good at putting feelings into words. 
But I’m still here. And in the morning. I’ll be holding you. 
Close to me. The sun will shine.
