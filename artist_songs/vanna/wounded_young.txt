I walk these halls and it's hell again
No smiling faces, not a single friend
No one knows me or where I've been
Nobody knows, nobody knows the trouble I've seen

Everyday I get pushed around
Life has a way of beating me down
Need a place to call my own
I just need a place to to call home

Have you felt lost from the start
Like no one can fix your heart
We are the wounded young
We are the wounded young
Pick up the pieces and start again
Put you back together my friend
We are the wounded young
We are the wounded young

Same halls people know my name
All eyes on me, I'm everybody's dream
Pressures on every single day
Shoulders too heavy with all this weight

Everyday I get pushed around
Life has a way of beating me down
Need a place to call my own
I just need a place to to call home

Have you felt lost from the start
Like no one can fix your heart
We are the wounded young
We are the wounded young
Pick up the pieces and start again
Put you back together my friend
We are the wounded young
We are the wounded young

I know you feel like you don't belong
So raise your voice and sing this song
Its up to us to fix ourselves
The world is cold and nobody helps
So get the fire lit, get the flame strong
Keep the world burning on (On and on and on and on)
One more time around the sun
This story is not done
I know you feel like you don't belong
So raise your voice and sing this song
Its up to us to fix ourselves
The world is cold and nobody helps
So get the fire lit, get the flame strong
Keep the world burning on
One more time around the sun
This story is not done

Have you felt lost from the start
Like no one can fix your heart
We are the wounded young
We are the wounded young
Pick up the pieces and start again
Put you back together my friend
We are the wounded young
We are the wounded young

One more time around the sun
We are the wounded young
One more time around the sun
We are the wounded young
