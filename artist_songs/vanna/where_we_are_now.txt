I just can’t get the ending right. 
I’m so desperate tonight. 
It seems only right to let the shadows lead the way. 
If I could only just decide. 
To let go of my insides. 
I know that I’ll never have to feel this way again.

And I’m caught in between. 
My waking life and dreams . 
Death’s just as lonely as before. 
I still remember you when.

This is all too familiar now.
I know I’ve seen this place before. But I just don’t recall. 
I don’t feel like I’m awake. But I’m not dreaming. 
What was it that I came here for?

They held us down. 
But now we’re breaking loose. 
We swore that we’d let nothing stand in our way. 
And when I’m gone. 
I will come back to haunt you. 
I’ll still watch over you my love.

When you’re on your way to me. 
Don’t forget the taste of me. 
And don’t forget the feel of me. 
With my arms around you. 
Those memories will never fade.
Like all the promises we made.

This is all too familiar now. 
I know I’ve seen this place before. But I just don’t recall. 
I don’t feel like I’m awake. But I’m not dreaming. 
What was it that I came here for?

From below. The sun will rise. 
And give us time to clear our heads.

The end is breathing down my neck. 
Though hope is all that we have left. 
The pain in understanding. Why we can’t take it all back. 
It’s time to finally let go. Of everything we’ve known.

This is all too familiar now. 
I know I’ve seen this place before. But I just don’t recall. 
I don’t feel like I’m  awake. But I’m not dreaming. 
What was it that I came here for?

I swear I’ll find you before I drift away.

This is all too familiar now. 
I know I’ve seen this place before. But I just don’t recall. 
I don’t feel like I’m awake. But I’m not dreaming. 
I don’t know where I’ll be drifting. When I finally let go.
