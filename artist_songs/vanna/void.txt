Holes. Inside my broken bones. 
Decay. I watch my flesh rip away. 
Space. Between the dead and I. 
Goodbye. Farewell to my body and my soul. 

I've become a black hole. 

I'm not like them. I can't fucking pretend 
That the sun's not gone. My sky's all wrong. 
No floating on clouds. I'm fucking falling down. 
Swallowing everything around. 

Stare into the great unknown. 
This hell that I call home. 
Stare into the great unknown. 
This hell that I call home. 
Void. Stare into the great unknown. 
Void. This hell that I call home. 
Void. Darkness all I ever see. 
Void. Welcome to the death of me. 

With the lights out, it's dangerous. 
Here you go, chanting entertain us. 
I look stupid and brainless. 
Well whatever, just never fucking mind us. 
Your duty's done and you're drained too. 
Watch as this black hole consumes you. 
Watch as this black hole consumes you. 
Watch as this black hole consumes you. 

Stare into the great unknown. 
This hell that I call home. 
Stare into the great unknown. 
This hell, this hell that I call home. 
Void. Stare into the great unknown. 
Void. This hell that I call home. 
Void. Darkness all I ever see. 
Void. Welcome to the death of me. 

Void. You become your own black hole.
Void. You become your own black hole.
Void. You become your own black hole.
Void. You become your own black hole.
Void. You become your own black hole.
Void. You become your own black hole.
Void. You become your own black hole.
Void. You become your own black hole.
