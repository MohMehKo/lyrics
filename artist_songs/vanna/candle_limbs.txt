I can't bare to see my friend like this
A shell of a human being, a broken mess
Who did this to you, what was their name?
Who took this man on fire and snuffed his flame?

Don't let the light, the light from your life go
The darkness creeps in (And drags you below)
Show me the fire not the doubt
Don't let the burning burn itself out

Looks like I'm gonna follow you into hell
That's fine I've fought too many demons to talk about
And then I'll follow you into the oceans blue
I'll try to hold the weight
But I can't trend water for you
Don't slip below

Don't let the light, the light from your life go
The darkness creeps in (And drags you below)
Show me the fire not the doubt
Don't let the burning burn itself out

Don't let the burning burn itself out
Don't let the burning burn itself out
Don't let the burning burn itself out
Don't let the burning burn itself out

Don't let the light, the light from your life go
The darkness creeps in (And drags you below)
Show me the fire not the doubt
Don't let the burning burn itself out

Don't let the burning burn itself out
Don't let the burning burn itself out
