Watch your words, what you say
Watch out they'll slip past your teeth
Watch what you say to me
Watch your words, what you say
Watch what you say to me

Hello, are you there, are you listening?
I got something, got something to say
I'm sick of watching that running mouth
(Run around) with nothing to talk about

You hate, you hate, you hate on me
What do you think you know, what do you think you see
You hate, you hate, you hate on me
But you're still not listening
Cause you love to hear yourself speak

I'm getting a little
A little sick of your voice sick of your voice, 
sick of your voice cause you're not saying things I haven't heard

Okay I get it man, I know I suck
You keeping talking and I don't stop
(Cause I am) the black sheep
And you can count on me
That while you sleep
I'm killing your dream

And you hate, you hate on me
You have a problem, a problem I see
And you hate, you hate on me
Cause I'm something you couldn't be
Cause you love to hear yourself speak

I'm getting a little
A little sick of your voice sick of your voice, 
sick of your voice always bringing me trouble and making too much noise
I'm getting fed up
And I am sick of your words, sick of your words
Cause you're not  saying things I haven't heard

You're not saying anything I haven't heard
So here's part where you get to choose
I'll be clear with the words I use
There's no way out so join or die
No survivors, no one left alive

There's no way out so join or die
No survivors, no one left alive
You never listen to a word I say
Man you love to hear yourself speak

I'm getting a little
A little sick of your voice sick of your voice, 
sick of your voice always bringing me trouble and making too much noise
I'm getting fed up
And I am sick of your words, sick of your words
Cause you're not  saying things I haven't heard
Man you love to hear yourself speak
Man you love to hear yourself speak
