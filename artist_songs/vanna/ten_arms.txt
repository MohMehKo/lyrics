Don’t let this slip away. 
Breathe it in. Hold it in. 
You will miss it when it's gone. 
You have so much to say. 
So listen to yourself.

We are nothing. If we suffer alone. 
Remember where you came from.

Will our hearts still beat in time. 
Do we fear living our lives alone. 
After everything is said and done. 
Will you make it on your own.

After all the times. 
That we’ve lost sleep. 
Are you still trying. 
Are you giving up on us. 
I’ve yet to figure it out. 
It’s something that I just don’t understand. 
Are you giving up on us.

We’re losing reason. Keeping our hearts. Hidden.

We are nothing. If we suffer alone. 
Remember where you came from.

Will our hearts still beat in time. 
Do we fear living our lives alone. 
After everything is said and done. 
You will make it on your own.

After all the times. 
That we’ve lost sleep. 
Are you still trying. 
Are you giving up on us. 
I've yet to figure it out. 
It’s something that I just don’t understand. 
Are you giving up. 
Are you giving up on us.

This withered silence. Is making me sick.
You have one chance. You’re making me sick. 
You have one chance. Don’t let us slip away. 
Open your hands. Revel in promises.
Of living forever. Of living for today. 
But we are nothing. If we suffer alone. 
We are nothing. If we suffer alone. 
If we suffer alone. We could have it all.
