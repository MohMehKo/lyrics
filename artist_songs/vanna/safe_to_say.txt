Let's leave this place behind
When we finally decide
What's it gonna take
To make you feel alive (feel alive)
What's it gonna take
To open up your eyes
To open up your eyes

It's time to get out of this town
This torture (this torture)
Your fear holds you down
Bring closer, move forward
Your silent sound

These words don't always come out right
But I feel that we're wasting time
Letting go of the troubles we're still holding tight
All these words don't always come out right
But I feel that we're wasting time
Are we wasting our time, are you still holding tight

It was only fair
To look towards the sky
To breathe in the air
To wait in the shadows
When the day ends
No sense of pride
Would you give up
If we've all given up
Till the east is ours,
We drew the lines that divide
Stapled these badges of pain to our sides

To our sides

We've all had our enemies
We'll leave the past behind
I don't feel like I'm losing sleep
I know you can see it in my eyes
We've all had our enemies
We're leaving the past behind
I don't feel like I'm losing sleep
I know you can see it in my eyes

You can see it in my eyes,
You can see it in my eyes.

All these words don't always come out right
But I feel that we're wasting time
Letting go of the troubles we're still holding tight
All these words don't always come out right
But I feel that we're wasting time
Are we wasting our time
Are you still holding tight

I'll leave my heart there by your bedside
If you swear that your eyes won't stray
To be honest, open and hoping
To find the words to say
I'll leave my heart there by your bedside
If you swear that your eyes won't stray
And honestly honestly,
I only let go for the sake of you.
