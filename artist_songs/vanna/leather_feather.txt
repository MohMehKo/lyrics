Wake up look around tell me what you see
A sick sad world of misery
I found a place where I, where I can finally breathe
I refuse to die just to keep you alive
So much more to this
I wanna know happiness
I found a place where I, where I can finally breathe

I keep my too head high
To look back at my old life
So I'll keep on
Moving strong without you
Without you, without you
I just thought you should know
I'll keep on moving strong

Look at me and the grin on my face
Feel the rage that runs through my veins
A smile doesn't mean I am weak
It means I've got something I'd kill to keep
And I won't let you get in my way

I've got something I'd kill to keep
So don't try to take it from me
I've got something I'd kill to keep
So don't try to take it from me
Did you hear me?
I've got something I'd kill to keep
And no ones going to take it from me
And I won't let you get in my way

I keep my too head high
To look back at my old life
So I'll keep on
Moving strong without you
Without you, without you
I just thought you should know
I'll keep on moving strong

I've got something
I've got something
I'd kill to keep
Something I'd kill to keep
Kill to keep
