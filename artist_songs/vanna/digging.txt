I've sunk lower than a stone in the sea.
Much lower than I've ever seen.

You see,even rocks don't have bottoms like this.
I wonder now if I'll even be missed.
Do they know my face? Do they know I exist?

So what's the point? There's no fucking use.
My own fingers and hands become my noose.
Someone give me a reason to stay.
Fuck it, no one listens anyway.

Again, I'm alone.

Home is a coffin and your city's a grave.
Don't dig yourself, dig yourself into place.

Home is a coffin and your city's a grave.
Don't dig yourself into place.

Home is a coffin and your city's a grave.
Don't dig yourself, yourself into place.

Home is a coffin and your city's a grave.
Don't dig yourself into place.

In these goddamn dark nights I start to realize
this is war.
I'm gonna have to fight tooth and nail
tooth and nail just to stay alive.

Look at me, I'm living proof.
You're not alone. we have each other and we'll pull through.
This chapter's called "you're alive."
You've been writing it this whole time.

So come back to life.

Don't write, don't write your ending.
Don't write, don't write your ending.

So come back to life.

Home is a coffin and your city's a grave.
Don't dig yourself, dig yourself into place.

Home is a coffin and your city's a grave.
Don't dig yourself into place.

Home is a coffin and your city's a grave.
Don't dig yourself, yourself into place.

Home is a coffin and your city's a grave.
Don't dig yourself into place.

Don't let go.
There's a reason you just don't know.
There's a reason, so don't let go.
There's a reason you just don't know.
There's a reason, so don't let go.
