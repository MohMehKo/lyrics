You sing just like uncaged birds
Till the trees are ablaze
The scribe licks his pen
Come fly with me
Rewrite our end
Still alive
Still alive
Still alive
This is peace

They will never send for us
They will never send for us

These walls have taught us not to speak
These walls have taught us not to speak
These walls have taught us not to speak
Not to feel
Not to see

Sing me to sleep
Like this is home
Sing for me
While we're alone

Please stay
I need you here, my bird

Dear God! Call an ambulance! Dear God!
Dear God! Call an ambulance! Dear God!

You sing just like
Uncaged birds
Uncaged Birds
Still alive
Still alive
Still alive
