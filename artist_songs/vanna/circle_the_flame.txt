Straight to hell
Yeah

An eye for an eye makes the world go blind
And you've robbed me of my sight
And you've got no soul
And you lost control
How many more have to burn
I thought we had this lesson learned

The world is going to hell
(Oh well, oh well, oh well)
No heaven to buy, no soul to sell
The world is going to hell
(Oh well, oh well, oh well)
No heaven above
Straight to hell
(Oh well, oh well)

And you've got no soul
And you've lost control
How many more have to burn
I thought we had this lesson learned
An eye for an eye makes the world go blind
And you've robbed me of my sight

This is the sound when all hell comes crashing down
This is the sound, this is the sound
This is the sound when all hell comes crashing down

The world is going to hell
(Oh well, oh well, oh well)
No heaven to buy, no soul to sell
The world is going to hell
(Oh well, oh well, oh well)
No heaven above
Straight to hell
(Oh well, oh well)

Everything and everyone you love
Everything and everyone you love
Is going to burn in the end

Oh well, oh well
Straight to hell
Oh well, oh well
Straight to hell
