Hey God it’s me again,
Where have you gone,
Where the fuck have you been?
You’ve watched wars,
You’ve watched people die,
You’ve watched my Father sin,
You’ve watched my Mother cry,
You even watched my own life crumble right before your eyes,

I won’t fold my hands.
I won’t close my eyes.
Paralyzed.
I won’t fold my hands.
I won’t close my eyes.
Paralyzed.

And the same as above.
Is the same as below.
And the same as above.
Is the same as below.
And the same as above.
Is the same as below.
And the same as above.
Is the same as below.

It’s all empty,
It’s all empty,
It’s all,
It’s all empty fucking words.
Look to the sky,
Cause your answers are there.
I just stare,
Look to the sky,
Cause your answers are there.
I just stare,

Stare at a coward,
I stare at a coward,
Stare at a coward,
Look to the sky,
Cause your answers are there,
I just stare,
Stare at a coward,
I stare at a coward.
But you won’t stare back at me.

I’ve been praying to an empty sky.
There’s nothing there but a hand me down lie.
I’ve been praying to an empty sky.
Just thunder rolls and flashes of light.

Show yourself.
Here’s your chance,
Prove me wrong,
Show yourself,
Come on!
Show yourself,
Here’s your chance,
Prove me wrong,
Show yourself.


And the same as above.
Is the same as below.
And the same as above.
Is the same as below.
And the same as above.
Is the same as below.
And the same as above.
Is the same as below.

Praying to an empty sky.
Praying to an empty sky.
Praying to an empty sky.
Praying to an empty sky.

And the same as above.
Is the same as below.
