I don't love what I've done
All these months of wear
I don't know where I was
And now at this anchor like an altar
I tie and tie and tie
I tie and tie

And if this never ends
At least I'll stay alive
Know when to count my loses
And if this never ends
At least I'll stay alive
Learn to forgive myself

Now press west
Cover your footsteps
Climb your hill
Like a mountain
Now press west
Cover your footsteps
Climb your hill
Like a mountain

You are not the wall on which I lean
(I'm not the man you thought I was)
Is there more to this than what I see?
(I'm not the man you thought I was)
You are not the wall on which I lean
(I'm not the man you thought I was)
Is there more to this than what I see?
(I'm not the man you thought I was)

I've been wandering
And for this I ache
I should have told you
I loved you back
I've been wandering
This wasn't a dream

Set adrift
(I'll advised, I'll equipped)
Sleep safe
(Thinking well)
We can only hope he makes it
We can only hope
Hope he

And if this never ends
(Makes it somewhere)
At least I'll stay alive
Know when to count my loses
(Hope he)
And if this never ends
(Makes it somewhere)
At least I'll stay alive
Learn to forgive myself
