This is note to my future self
I won't make it to you
So please send me help
This is my room becoming a tomb
And a dying dream is the only view
What have I become
Dead and dumb and uncomfortably numb
I'm not proud of this
Do I even exist

Every day goes on and on, the same old song
But I'm stuck and I can't move
Please tell me what I should do
When you're that deep
When you're too weak
All do you is sleep
Cause when you're that low
Everything is a hole
That drags you even further below

I write to you
I'm weak and but I can feel now
My soul slowly giving out
I'm not that strong
So you'll have to carry on now
Cause I don't think I know how

And I know you had such amazing plans
And I hope you know I tried so hard not to let go
Cause when you're that deep
When you're too weak
All you do is sleep
Cause when you're that low
Everything's a hole
That drags you even further below

I write to you
I'm weak but I can feel now
My soul slowly giving out
I'm not that strong
So you'll have to carry on now
Cause I don't think I know how

This isn't how we die
You're not reading the ending right
You are meant for greatness
Open up your eyes and face it
Now to your feet and follow me
The road is hard but you're harder
Can't you feel your heart beat starting?
The blood that runs through our veins
Means you and I are the same
The road is hard but you're harder
Can't you feel your heart beat starting?

I write to you
You're weak but you can feel now
You're soul slowly getting out
You are so strong
And you'll have to carry on now
Cause I know that you know how
