I promise you this
I was a poor excuse for a man at best that fed off of emptiness
More like a sinkhole that doesn't let go
I drag everything and everyone I know below
I'm not a praying man
But I'm begging the sky
I keep my hands folded tight
Please save my life

You saw me searching
I was lost in a world
All alone and out of time
You gave me purpose
You gave me the world
When you put your hands in mine

And like a holy ghost you show your face
And my heat my soul found a place
I call you church cause when you're near
All my demons flee, there all no devils here
It's the way that you look at me
Like you see everything that I'm that supposed to be
And when my eyes look back at you
I see the future I never knew

You saw me searching
I was lost in a world
All alone and out of time
You gave me purpose
You gave me the world
When you put your hands in mine

I promise you this
I was a poor excuse of a man at best
But when my eyes look back at you
I see the future I never knew
I see myself growing with you
You gave me roots, you let me bloom
You let me bloom
I see myself growing with you
You gave me roots you let me bloom

You saw me searching
I was lost in a world
All alone and out of time
You gave me purpose
You gave me the world
When you put your hands in mine
(I see myself growing with you
You gave me roots you let me bloom)

I see myself growing with you
You gave me roots you let me bloom
I see myself growing with you
You gave me roots you let me bloom
You saw me searching
I was lost in a world
All alone and out of time
You gave me purpose
You gave me the world
When you put your hands in mine
