Don't wait for rivers to flood, just to keep you afloat. 
Don't wait for mountains to fall, just to get across. 

Just make it across. 

And I've never seen lights quite like these. 
Glowing and bursting for me. 
And times never ceased or stopped for me, 
But suddenly I control all I see. 
And when did these faces need me to be 
Everything I could be? 
When did these words breathe life into 
Into the deceased? 

Don't wait for rivers to flood, to keep you afloat. 
Don't wait for mountains to fall, just to get across. 
Don't wait for rivers to flood, to keep you afloat. 
Don't wait for mountains to fall, just to get across. 

Any path that you take that you didn't pave is the wrong one, 
And anybody who waits in the rain will drown in the flood, 
And anybody who makes the climb knows the view is worth the time, 
But the battle of if I'll ever get there is the problem. 
How much can I take 'til I call it quits? 
And how long can my legs keep running like this? 
Until they give in. Until my liver gives up. 
My lungs are blackened, but that's how I like them. 
I'm pushing the limits until they push me back. 
I'm on the edge of the mountain calculating the gap 
Between a rock and a hard place. A palace and a pit, 
But I remember death never lies to the people who live.

Don't wait for rivers to flood, to keep you afloat. 
Don't wait for mountains to fall, just to get across. 
Don't wait for rivers to flood.
Don't wait for mountains to fall.
