What a brilliant plan to steal a heart
Carve your name, carve your name
She will learn it well, you let her down
You let her down so gently

And now she looks only straight ahead
Lie to me, lie to me
Tell me you never expected her to leave

And it cuts you deep right where you wanted
And it cuts you deep where it hurts the most

I hope it cuts you deep where it hurts the most
But the sad thing is it's just what you fucking wanted

And now she looks only straight ahead
Lie to me, lie to me
Tell me you never expected her to leave

I'm breathing the life back into love
She's coming around
I'm breathing the life back into love
She's waking up

And the same graceful wind that carried her to me
Will turn cold on you, will bring you to your knees

When the stage caves in, what part of you will live
And who would pay to watch you die?

Tell me you never expected her to leave

I'm breathing the life back into love
She's coming around
I'm breathing the life back into love
She's waking up

I've been looking for you in my dreams
Been waiting for you to wake up
