The red, white, black and blue.

Broken and used.

Obsessed with this disease.
We've put the world on its knees.
Obsessed with our needs
While our mouths rot and bleed.

Each man creates his own
His own devil and god for the throne.
Hoping for heaven but we're heading for hell.
We call this living and we're doing it well.

We are a walking cancer.

Obsessed with this disease.
We've put the world on its knees.
Obsessed with our needs
While our mouths rot and beg you please.

Red, white, black and blue.
There is no right, there is no truth.
Red, white, black and blue.
There is no right, there is no truth.
No fucking truth.

'Cause it's a nation of sheep, ruled by wolves.
Owned by pigs and lead by fools.
Sleep is over. it's time to wake up.
The world is burning. All I hear is "I don't give a fuck."

Each man creates his own
His own devil and god for the throne.
Hoping for heaven but we're heading for hell.
We call this living and we're doing it well.

We're the blind leading the sick to die.
We're the blind leading the sick to die.
Open your eyes or it will never stop.
No rest, no sleep. Wake up, wake up.

Yeah

One nation under shit.
Our nation. We're burying it.
