Shut up, shut up

Well I'm faded, you're losing me
I can't eat, I can't breathe, I can't sleep
Going out of my goddamn mind
Heartbeat but I'm not alive

All the voices telling you you're dead
Shut up, shut up
Shut 'em up, get em outta your head

Stop listening to what they say
They're here to break you, don't let them take you
Be the voice yelling loud so they can hear
You'll never break me, you'll never take me

Look around I'm yelling "1, 2, 3"
How many people feel just like me?
Stuck in a cycle with no end
But look around we're together again
Welcome home in here you are free
Everybody, everybody
Welcome home in here you are free
To be us, to be you, to be me

All the voices telling you you're dead
Shut up, shut up
Shut 'em up, get em outta your head

Stop listening to what they say
They're here to break you, don't let them take you
Be the voice yelling loud so they can hear
You'll never break me, you'll never take me

All the voices telling me I'm dead
All the voices telling me I'm dead
Shut 'em up get them outta my head
Shut 'em up get them outta my head
Get 'em, get 'em
Shut 'em up get them outta my head

Stop listening to what they say
They're here to break you, don't let them take you
Be the voice yelling loud so they can hear
You'll never break me, you'll never take me

All the voices telling me I'm dead
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Shut up, shut up
