This is an open ended sky
With open eyes too tired to look away
Say you'll stay forever by my side
And forever we'll be standing here

The dead still, walk the street
This means war, on everyone
You can't hear, them lying to us
You can't see, their fingers crossed

The dead still, walk the street
This means war, on everyone
You can't hear, them lying to us
You can't see, their fingers crossed

Lets keep our thoughts, on guard this time
We'll keep on moving on
Just don't let them get to close

Lets keep our thoughts, on guard this time
We'll keep on moving on
Just don't let them get to close

In the land where the dead still walk, walk the streets.
This means war, on everyone
You can't hear, them lying to us
You can't see, their fingers crossed

This is a test
We know our own strength
We'll take the east
And march on

Make our way, burning all our bridges
State by state, we march on
Make our way, burning all our bridges
State by state, we march on

And we march on, leaving trails of hope behind us
With our hands to the sky
The wind will be our guide

At times like these
To be the last one standing
Hope is all we have left

At times like these
To be the last one standing
Hope is all we have left

To be the last one standing

To be the last one standing
