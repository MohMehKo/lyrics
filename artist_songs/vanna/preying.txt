Fuck

My life’s fucked and I’m falling apart
Hollow head to match the holes in my heart
I got nothing to hold onto
'Cept for you but your gone
you were mine, my glue
Scabbed up and ripped right off
The smallest things can just tear you apart
I may only just be a man
But oh man, goddamn
I need a fucking friend

Shape shifter
I’ve become the person you see
Show me how to be myself
Mold me, break me
Shape shifter
I’ve become the person you see
Never told how to be myself
I’m faking, faking

Look here I found a host
Look here I found a host
Not a father not a son
But an unholy ghost

Now take my hand
I promise promised lands
I promise you I'll do the best I can
Now tell me how much does your happiness mean
I promise you the American dream

Keep dreaming, keep dreaming
Blank stare as you keep on believing
I’m sinking, I’m sinking
Head under water and I keep on breathing

Shape shifter
I’ve become the person you see
Show me how to be myself
Mold me, break me
Shape shifter
I’ve become the person you see
Never told how to be myself
I’m faking, faking

Mirrors become my biggest foe
Who I’ve become no one knows
Reflections no longer find
The man that is inside

I can’t look myself in the fucking eyes
I can’t look myself in the eyes
I can’t look myself in the eyes
The eyes, the eyes, the eyes, the eyes, the eyes
Can’t look myself in the eyes

Shape shifter
I’ve become the person you see
Show me how to be myself
Mold me, break me
Shape shifter
I’ve become the person you see
Never told how to be myself
I’m faking, faking
