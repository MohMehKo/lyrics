(Hard to see it and most don't really feel it anyway
Hard to see it and most don't really feel it anyway)

I got my ghost of the reins in my knee high boots
Got my Stetson fedora hidin baby blues
Bout to light up the dark, got a fire that's huge
Got it all and I'm bout to put it all on you

Knock that sun down from this amber sky
Shake the stars loose I'm gonna change your mind

(Hard to see it and most don't really feel it anyway)
I got good love you're gonna feel it
(Hard to see it and most don't really feel it anyway)
I got good love you're gonna feel it
(Hard to see it and most don't really feel it anyway)
I got good love you're gonna feel it
(Hard to see it that most don't really feel it anyway)
I got good love you're gonna feel it

Started out hot but it got us cool
She had you on your knees like a no good fool
She tries to be your momma but it just won't do
Cause you can't do your momma, No you can't can you

She can't change that weather, can't freeze time
Shake the stars loose I'm gonna change your mind

(Hard to see it and most don't really feel it anyway)
I got good love you're gonna feel it
(Hard to see it and most don't really feel it anyway)
I got good love you're gonna feel it
(Hard to see it and most don't really feel it anyway)
I got good love you're gonna feel it
(Hard to see it and most don't really feel it anyway)
I got good love you're gonna feel it
