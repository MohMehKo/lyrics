Open up your dirty eyes, look what you did,
Let me see your filthy hands, I caught 'em red,
I can smell the bullshit on your breath,
Got it written from your toes to your neck,
Baby, let the venom sink into your chest,
Tryin' to play me like a pawn, that's what you get,
Get up off your knees, bitch, no need to beg,

I don't want you back, back,
I don't want you back,
Better hit the road, road,
Like your name was Jack,
Call me on the phone, phone,
I won't call you back,
You should be alone, how do you like that?

Laugh it off, boy, I'm a lunatic,
Laugh it all the way till the truth sinks in,
Laugh it off, boy, till your teeth fall out,
Till your head just breaks,
Till your eyes fall down, down, down,

It's over to the left,
Over to the right,
Over through the day,
Over through the night,
I'm over, over, over you,
Boy, this over's overdue,

It's over to the left,
Over to the right,
Over through the day,
Over through the night,
I'm over, over, over you,
Boy, this over's overdue,

It's over to the left,
Over to the right,
Over through the day,
Over through the night,
I'm over, over, over you,
Boy, this over's overdue,

It's over to the left,
Over to the right,
Over through the day,
Over through the night,
I'm over, over, over you,
Boy, this over's overdue,

I'm over, over, over you.
