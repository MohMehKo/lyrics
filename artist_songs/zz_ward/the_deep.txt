I don't wanna let you in
'Cause I don't wanna let this things in
Dirty karma never wins
But here we are back at it again

When the lights go out
When we're all alone
Won't you take me down
With your touch of gold

Dream while I'm wide awake
Don't know how much I can take
But I need it, can't leave it
'Cause you make me breathe in

The deep, whoaaa
The deep, whoaaa
The deep, whoaaa
The deep end

Every night I -
I Give you up
Every time I swear it's too much
But I ain't trying to
Say it's done
'Cause getting some
It's better than none
Help me I'm drowning
I can't stop, I'm going under
Come be the airs in my lung

When the lights go out
When we're all alone
Won't you take me down
With your touch of gold

Dreaming while I'm wide awake
Don't know how much I can take
But I need it, can't leave it
'Cause you make me breathe in

The deep, whoaaa
The deep, whoaaa
The deep, whoaaa
The deep end

The deep, whoaaa
The deep, whoaaa
The deep, whoaaa
The deep end

I walk in this bitch
Smoking, exhausting this bitch
Don't compare me, I'm different
I'm finished, take off in this bitch,
I'm a pull up in this bitch man
I'm saucin', I'm trippin'
I'm probly gon buy me a whip
I'm a get lost in that bitch
Time gon be missing
They all like what happened to him
All like what happened young purple
Young nigga you different
You already changed
Already want me the same
I skirt and skirt through the lanes
I know the pain, I know the pressure but pressure
Make diamonds and I'm out here shinin' my knockers
The difference, I know the difference man
I know the difference
What's real and what isn't
Always 100 forever official
Purple for president
Sign the petition

Taking me under
Your taking me under
These covers, I'm covered
And I can't recover

Dreaming while I'm wide awake
Don't know how much I can take
But I need it, can't leave it
'Cause you make me breathe in

The deep, whoaaa
The deep, whoaaa
The deep, whoaaa
The deep end
