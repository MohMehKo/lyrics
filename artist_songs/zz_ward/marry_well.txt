I count up my dollars,
Tongue on my grill
I stack up my paper
I keep it, that's real
I ride in my Benzi
With the ice on my wrist
Crash it if I wanna
Cause I buy my own shit

Unless you gonna pay
Get out of my way

Go on, girl, go and do that dirt
Go on, girl, give 'em hell
Don't you know that a girl's gotta work
If she don't marry well

She don't marry well
So, watch out
Watch out
So, watch out

I buy my own diamonds
They don't come with no vows
I'm rocking these stockings
I'm holding it down
See, I was born a hustler
Got it runnin' through my blood
And I tell you the truth is
I wouldn't change it if I could

Unless you gonna pay
Get out of my way

Go on, girl, go and do that dirt
Go on, girl, give 'em hell
Don't you know that a girl's gotta work
If she don't marry well

She don't marry well
So, watch out
Watch out
So, watch out

So, baby, I'm runnin', runnin' the show
Movin' so fast that I make it look slow
Baby, I'm spinnin', spinnin' this game
Follow my tracks or get off of the train
Baby, I'm killing it break through the ceiling
It ends when I say it ends
Baby, I'm feelin' it
Go girl do that, yeah go make it work

Go on, girl, go and do that dirt
Go on, girl, give 'em hell
Don't you know that a girl's gotta work
If she don't marry well

She don't marry well
So, watch out
Watch out
So, watch out
So, watch out
Watch out
So, watch out
