Hold my breath, close my eyes,
Keep my fists at my sides,
My mouth shut, my tongue tied,
Raise your voice like I'm deaf,
Stare me down 'cross this desk,
Scare me good, you're the best,

Bet you think that my world's gonna stop if there ain't no we,
You can say what you want but it don't mean shit to me,

'Cause I've been down to the bottom of the barrel,
I've been to the bottom of the lick,
I've been to the bottom with the devil,
Yeah, I've been through the fire, so I just can't feel the pain,
I keep it drippin' like morphine,

Keep your keys, keep your cash,
Keep your cush, keep your hash,
Smoke-filled dreams, paper stacks,

Bet you think that my world's gonna stop if there ain't no we,
You can say what you want but it don't mean shit to me,

'Cause I've been down to the bottom of the barrel,
I've been to the bottom of the lick,
I've been to the bottom with the devil,
Yeah, I've been through the fire, so I just can't feel the pain,

'Cause I've been down to the bottom of the barrel,
I've been to the bottom of the lick,
I've been to the bottom with the devil,
Yeah, I've been through the fire, so I just can't feel the pain,
I keep it drippin' like morphine,
I keep it drippin' like.
