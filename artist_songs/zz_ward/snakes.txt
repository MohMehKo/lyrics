There's a snake in the grass
I see him staring at me
Told him, if you're gonna bite me
Then first you better show me your teeth
[x2]

Oh my God! Oh my God!

I said
Oh my God, I'm terrified
Your ice cold heart and hellish eyes
Woohoo, I can't lie
Woohoo, I'm terrified

Oh my God, I'm terrified
And I just can't move, I'm paralyzed
Woohoo, I can't lie
Woohoo, I'm terrified
