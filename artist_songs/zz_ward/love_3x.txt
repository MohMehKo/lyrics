We've got the neighbors calling the cops
Cause you're screaming out my name
I'm throwing dishes from the rooftop
While you're standing in the rain
We're either fucking or we're fighting
No caramel in between
You make me I'll, but it's such a thrill

There's only one thing that would make me do
All the crazy shit I do when I'm next to you
It's a little bit insane but it feels so right
And it's got me coming back to you every night

(It's love)
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
(It's love)
Love, love, love
Love, love, love

You rip your shirt in half and cry
While I'm pulling out my hair
Argue for hours at a time
Cause true love doesn't care
Then our cussing turns into kissing
Lights up like a flame
You make me I'll
But it's such a thrill

There's only one thing that would make me do
All the crazy shit I do when I'm next to you
It's a little bit insane but it feels so right
And it's got me coming back to you every night

(It's love)
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
(It's love)
Love, love, love
Love, love, love

You break the windows, yeah
On the car
But you never ever, never ever
Break my heart
A sweet disaster (yeah)
From the start
It's so far from perfect
But that's just who we are

There's only one thing that would make me do
All the crazy shit I do when I'm next to you
It's a little bit insane but it feels so right
And it's got me coming back to you every night

(It's love)
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
(It's love)
Love, love, love
Love, love, love

(It's love)
Love
Love, love, love
Love
Love, love, love
Love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love
Love
Love, love, love

(It's love)
(It's love)
(It's love)
