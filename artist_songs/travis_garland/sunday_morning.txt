Oh oh...
No ooh ooh...

When you said goodbye
I didn't get it
Maybe I just didn't
Want to hear that word
Too late it's embedded
Girl I haven't heard from you in seven days
Since you looked over your shoulder
As you walked away
I didn't feel like it was over
Is it over?

It's Sunday morning (Sunday morning)
I slept right next to my phone
It's Sunday morning (Sunday morning)
I'm still waiting for your call
To tell me this was some mistake
That you don't wanna spend another minute away
Cause it's Sunday morning girl
Just call me when you get this message
Ohh, it'll only take one second
Ooh...

Look on the back and it's pathetic ?
Not the sixteen messages I left
It's you that don't get it
You just keep me hanging after everything
I just want to hear your voice say anything
In your heart it can't be over
Is it over?

It's Sunday morning (Sunday morning)
I slept right next to my phone
It's Sunday morning (Sunday morning)
I'm still waiting for your call
To tell me this was some mistake
That you don't wanna spend another minute away
Cause it's Sunday morning girl
Just call me when you get this

Operator tell me what I gotta do
To get thru to her
Cause we been disconnected
I been tryna get a hold of my girl
It's like her phone doesn't work
And I just can't accept this
I need to know if it's over
Is it over?

Sunday morning (Sunday morning)
I slept right next to my phone
It's Sunday morning (Sunday morning)
I'm still waiting for your call
To tell me this was all a mistake
That you don't wanna spend another minute away
Cause it's Sunday morning girl
Call me when you get this

It's Sunday morning (Sunday morning)
I slept right next to my phone
It's Sunday morning (Sunday morning)
I'm still waiting for your call
To tell me this was all a mistake
That you don't wanna spend another minute away
Cause it's Sunday morning girl
Just call me when you get this
