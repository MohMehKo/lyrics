[Verse 1]
Every time I pull up, come out.
I be like there she go
You be like “hey, hello”
Acting like you really don’t know
What I’m about. So I jump out (jump out)
Start a little conversation
You say yo’ man on vacation
You over here tryin’ to be patient

[Bridge]
You nasty (damn)
And I know it.
I can tell by the way you grab that hose
And how you hold that
Something that you miss (Miss)
Girl, I can be your fix (Fix)
Shoulda never left ya, left ya
Now I’m ‘bout to impress ya

[Chorus]
Every day I pass. You watering your grass
Or washing your car showing off that ass
Yo man in your life He’s always on flights	
And you just need a friend to talk to sometimes
So while he’s away girl Ima do you a favor
Let you borrow some sugar while I’m hooking up your cable
Groceries on your table bringing in your paper
If he ask later I’m just your neighbor girl
I'm just your neighbor girl [x4]

[Verse 2]
That’s all it is. Baby until you call it quits.
Call me when it’s an emergency
You can always count on me.
Fuck a neighborhood watch
All you need is me girl I’m always on the clock
Stay down, way down, lay down
While I’m on the way right now.

[Bridge]
You nasty (damn)
And I know it.
I can tell by the way you grab that hose
And how you hold that
Something that you miss (Miss)
Girl, I can be your fix (Fix)
Shoulda never left ya, left ya
Now I’m ‘bout to impress ya

[Chorus]
Every day I pass. You watering your grass
Or washing your car showing off that ass
Yo man in your life He’s always on flights	
And you just need a friend to talk to sometimes
So while he’s away girl Ima do you a favor
Let you borrow some sugar while I’m hooking up your cable
Groceries on your table bringing in your paper
If he ask later I’m just your neighbor girl
I'm just your neighbor girl [x4]
