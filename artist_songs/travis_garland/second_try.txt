Baby I'm not perfect
I make mistakes
But I know I can make this right
If you give me a second try

Baby only God knows what I was thinkin
When I did those things to you
Empty that's all that I can feel no emotion
Can fill the space I used to keep for you

Now I just wanna go back
Take it all back
You know I didn't mean it baby
Don't you hold it against me yeah

And don't just end it like that
Yeah I messed up but I lost my way
Swear I'll find the road that leads back to your heart

If I could just rewind
Id call when I said I would
Id wipe the tears I put there
Id stay that time I left you hanging
If I could turn back time
To the day that I met you
Id never let you get away
On my second try

Let me try again try again try again
Give me one more chance one more chance
Give me a second try

Sorry doesn't even come close to sayin
How stupid I feel for what Ive done
And its crazy I cant even ask your forgiveness
Cause I cant forgive myself for what Ive become

And I just wanna go back
Take it all back you know
I didn't mean it baby
Please don't hold it against me yeah

And don't just end it like that
Yeah I messed up
But I lost my way
Swear Ill find the road that leads right to your heart

If I could just rewind
Id call when I said I would
(I would wipe those tears)
Id wipe the tears I put there
Id stay that time I left you hangin
(Left you hangin)

If I could turn back time
To the day that I met you
Id never let you get away
On my second try

Let me try again try again try again
Give me another chance
Give me one more chance one more chance
Give me a second try

You never know a good thing
Till you let it go bad
Now I finally learned
To appreciate what I don't have

If I could turn back time
To the day that I met you
Id never let you get away
On my second try
I just want you to know
If you don't give me another shot
I don't even blame you
But I cant just go back to loving you from a distance
I know what your doing
Tell me what I have to do
For you to let me back in
And I just wanna go back

If I could just rewind
Id call when I said I would
Id wipe the tears I put there
(Gotta find the one)
Id stay that time I left you hangin
(That'll lead back to your heart)

If I could turn back time
To the day that I met you
Id never let you get away
On my second try

Let me try again try again try again
And I just wanna go back take it all back
Give me one more chance one more chance

Let me try again try again try again
Don't just end it like that end it like that
Give me one more chance one more chance

Let me try again try again try again
Give me one more chance one more chance
Im not gonna let you get away
