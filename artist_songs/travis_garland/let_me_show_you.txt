You were broken when I found ya
Girl I don’t mind picking up what’s left of you
Can’t even believe I got you here with me
I bet you never had a love like this before

Bring your sexy ass right over here
Let me get a good look at you
Baby tell me how that feel
When I push up all close to you

What you need from me?
I took care of everything, all true
I know wussup, what I would do

Come here, let me show you
Come here, let me show you
Come here, let me show you
Got you, that’s so true
I know wussup, what I would do
Come here, let me show you

It took me a while to get you here, baby
But now that I don’t mind waiting up
I got all my time to me
I’m in yo lap, how could you send me off?
I’ll show you love you ain’t never quite seen before

Bring your sexy ass right over here
Let me get a good look at you
Baby tell me how that feel
When I push up all close to you

What you need from me?
I took care of everything, all true
I know wussup, what I would do

Come here, let me show you
Come here, let me show you
Come here, let me show you
Got you, that’s so true
I know wussup, what I would do
Come here, let me show you

Baby these days I know it’s so harder to leave
Man someone left rose, what they really mean?
Baby I’m gon let my patience do the talking
All the time

Come here, let me show you
Come here, let me show you
Got you, that’s so true
I know wussup, what I would do

Come here, let me show you
Come here, let me show you
Come here, let me show you
Got you, that’s so true
I know wussup, what I would do
Come here, let me show you

Come here, let me show you
Got you, that’s so true
I know wussup, what I would do
Come here, let me show you
