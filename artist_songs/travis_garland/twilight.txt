The sun goes down on our last day
we both know there's no other way for us
and there's no hope to fix it now
cause there's no turning back when the day is done

We know we've had better days
and now its time we went our separate ways
and its the twilight of our love
baby its the twilight of our love
and when the last light fades
there'll be nothing left to say 
now its twilight

We couldve learned from our mistakes
instead of pushing each other away away
tomorrow wasn't meant for us us
but I will hold you while we still have the sun

We know we've had better days
and now its time we went our separate ways
and its the twilight of our love
baby its the twilight of our love
and when the last light fades
there'll be nothing left to say 
now its twilight

Its almost night time
but I cant say goodbye to you to you to you
and there's no more light left
I wish we had more time left together together together
cause were not done yet were not done yet
so don't let the sun set

We know we've had better days
and now its time we went our separate ways
and its the twilight of our love
baby its the twilight of our love
and when the last light fades
there'll be nothing left to say 
now its twilight
