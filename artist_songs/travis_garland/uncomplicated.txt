Easy, is not a word that applies to me, 
Simple is not in my life.
It feels like a million puzzle pieces, 
Nothing's ever easy

And nothing makes any sense anymore, 
And when my world crashes down on the floor, 
It's broken up, 
And I need your love, 
To put it back together, 
Mend my broken heart.

And there you are, 
It's like I'm staring at the missing part of me, 
Look into to your eyes and it gets hard to breathe, 
When everything else is crazy
You're uncomplicated.

It's so easy, so easy, so easy (when I'm with you)
It's so easy, so easy, so easy (taking with you)
It's so easy, so easy, so easy (my love for you)
It's uncomplicated

Constant, is something that I barely said. 
I can't read a map of my life. 
It feels like a hundred thousand questions.
Leave me no direction.

And nothing makes any sense anymore
And when my world crashes down on the floor, 
I'm so broken up, 
And I need your love, 
To put it back together, 
Mend my broken heart.

And there you are, 
It's like I'm staring at the missing part of me, 
Look into to your eyes and it gets hard to breathe, 
When everything else is crazy
You're uncomplicated

It's so easy, so easy, so easy (when I'm with you)
It's so easy, so easy, so easy (taking with you)
It's so easy, so easy, so easy (my love for you)
It's uncomplicated

And if I hush my head and I touch your hand, 
I can understand, 
All that you will ever need.

When nothing makes any sense anymore, 
And when my world crashes down on the floor
(It's so easy, so easy, so easy)
Put it back together
Mend my broken heart
it's uncomplicated 

And there you are, 
It's like I'm staring at a missing part of me, 
Look into to your eyes and it gets hard to breathe, 
When everything gets this crazy
You're uncomplicated

It's so easy, so easy, so easy (when I'm with you)
It's so easy, so easy, so easy (taking with you)
It's so easy, so easy, so easy (my love for you)
It's uncomplicated

It's so easy, so easy, so easy 
It's so easy, so easy, so easy (when I'm with you)
It's so easy, so easy, so easy 
It's uncomplicated...
