I wanna teach you
So many things
Things that you thought you knew oh

I'm a show you
Just what I mean
Never had a teacher quite like me before

Let me show you
How to fight
Let me show you just the way to hold your fist

I'm a teach you exactly how to hate me
Baby I'll teach you to forget

Girl you're so fly
I'm a put you on some new shit
If you don't mind

Let me teach you about love
I wanna give you an education
Let me teach you about drugs
I wanna give you an education
An education...

I wanna teach you
The art of holding hands
Have a walk along the beach and surf the world

And I'll teach jealousy
To all your friends
I want everyone to know that you're my girl

And I'm gonna teach you how to make good love
Show your body things that I know we could do

And I'm gonna teach you how to fuck
And the differences between the two

Girl you're so fly
I'm a put you on some new shit
If you don't mind

Let me teach you about love
I wanna give you an education
Let me teach you about drugs
I wanna give you an education

I'm a put you on some new shit
If you don't mind

Let me teach you about love
I wanna give you an education
Let me teach you about drugs
I wanna give you an education

Education...
Let me teach you...
I'll give you an education
