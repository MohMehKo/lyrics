This road we were on 
Always followed to leave 
Tonight was the last time 
You'll do this to me 
I stood by your side 
In the passenger seat 
Let me out on the road 
I'd rather walk than let you 
Walk all over me 

This time I'm walking away 
Now the pavement is underneath my feet 
This is goodbye 
You made it clear to me 
It was your way or the highway 
You said it's my way (always your way) 
Or the highway (always your way) 
Or the highway (always your way) 
It was your way or the highway (or the highway) 
You said it's my way (so now I'm taking the) 
Or the highway (so now I'm taking the) 
Or the highway 
Or the highway 

Holding on is hard on me 
I had enough, had enough, oh no 
It isn't...[humming]

This time I'm walking away 
Now the pavement is underneath my feet 
This is goodbye 
You made it clear to me 

It was your way or the highway 
You said it's my way (always your way) 
Or the highway (always your way) 
Or the highway (always your way) 
It was your way or the highway (or the highway) 
You said it's my way (so now I'm taking the) 
Or the highway (so now I'm taking the) 
Or the highway (highway) 
It was your way or the highway (or the highway) 

This time I'm walking away 
Now the pavement is underneath my feet 
This is goodbye 
You made it clear to me 
It was your way or the highway 
You said it's my way (always your way) 
Or the highway (always your way) 
Or the highway (always your way) 
Or the highway 
You said it's my way (so now I'm taking the) 
Or the highway (so now I'm taking the) 
Or the highway (highway) 
It was your way or the highway (or the highway) 
Always your way or the 
Always your way or the 
Always your way or the highway 
So now I'm taking the 
So now I'm taking the highway 
It was your way or the highway (or the highway)
