Oh Oh Uhh 
Hey girl I might be wrong 
But you don't want a man just to take you home 
That's cool we ain't gotta rush 
So let me tell you all about the shit I'm on 
Ha Ha baby I'm playin' 
Really you should dig all the things I'm sayin' to you, to you 

So just hold on before you walk away 
I know you wanna trust in me 
Girl I can see us together 
And if you just give me a chance 
To get to know you before you leave tonight 
Maybe, You'll be, you'll be 

My Stranger I'd be crazy if I were to let you go 
Without telling' you that you had me before hello 
Don't walk a way, Girl, you need to 
Tell me your name 
Stranger, I don't want you to be a Stranger 

Hey girl, I might be wrong 
I feel something buzzin' and it ain't my phone 
Slow down I ain't tryna scare you 
But I think I mighta just met Mrs.Garland 
Ha Ha girl I'm just sayin' 
The way you lick your lips 
Make me wanna quit the game 
And stay with you, with you 

My Stranger I'd be crazy if I were to let you go 
Without telling' you that you had me before hello 
Don't walk a way, Girl, you need to 
Tell me your name 
Stranger, I don't want you to be a Stranger 

Girl I know we just met tonight 
But I'm feelin' something' between you and me 
So why does I feel like, like I've known you forever girl? 
When I don't know you, I don't know you yet? 

You're my Stranger 
But that's gonna change girl 
You're my Stranger 
But Girl after tonight 
You're not a Stranger 
Cause things have changed 
But you're not a Stranger after tonite 

My Stranger I'd be crazy if I were to let you go 
Without telling' you that you had me before hello 
Don't walk a way, Girl, you need to 
Tell me your name 
Stranger, I don't want you to be a Stranger 
I don't want you to be, no more, oh oh whoa
