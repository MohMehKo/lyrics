I can't read your mind
I need you to say it

Plain and simple
I would give my life to you
Everything you needed
Baby I would be it
You're the only one I talk to
Who really knows me
Tells me shows me
That it's enough sometimes just to be myself

I don't want nobody else
They don't understand
That I gave away my heart
The moment that I shook your hand

Take my breath away
Buy me anything I ask
Go anywhere I wanna go
I traded everything just to know

[Chorus:]
Let me know you love me
Let me know you care
Let me know you're thinking of me
When I can't be there
Let me know you miss me
Call me up sometimes
I don't wanna go but boy you gotta let me know

Stop and listen
It's my thoughts calling your name
Screaming out the way I feel
I wish you would do the same
I think you might be on the same border
Same line same page
I'm tired
Listening to your silence brings the water to my eyes

I don't want nobody else
They don't understand
That I gave away my heart
The moment that I shook your hand

Don't let me in the dark
Let this blind over my eyes
If you don't feel the same
Is everything we have a lie?

[Chorus]

Please give me a reason to stay
Gotta get us back on track
Cause the worst thing is
Loving someone who doesn't love you back
I think you do but I need you to say it

I can't read your mind
Tell me from time to time
I need you to say it
Need you to tell me [x2]

[Chorus]

I can't read your mind
I need you to say it [x2]

Let me know you love me
Let me know you care
