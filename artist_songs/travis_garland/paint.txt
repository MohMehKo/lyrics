Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me

Saturday, Home Depot
Said you're living room needs a fresh coat
Pick your color, blue or white
Whatever it is gotta set the mood right
Got my hardware, let's put in work
Old hat, old jeans, no t-shirt
Before I know it it's on the floor

Cuz I just wanna do you in the paint
I wanna make love to you in the place ahh ahh
Rolling around in the mess that we made
Brushing and stroking
The best sex we made
Now I'm putting it in your hair
And you're rubbing on everywhere
Cuz I just wanna do you in the paint oh oh
Girl don't be shy, I know you ain't
Cuz I just wanna uhhh

Cuz I just wanna do you in the paint
I wanna make love to you in the place ahh ahh
Rolling around in the mess that we made
