I stay up late at night playin my guitar
Thinkin bout all the girls I could’ve fell in love with
Told you my name and that I was born to be a star
I remember your laugh and said alright, yea

Spending all my money on cigarettes
Don’t want me to smoke?
I just wanna be your light
Drinkin Jack Daniels big and I
It might be exactly my time, yea

[Chorus]
Oh you…
You the type of girl that I could fell in love with
Hearing modern life
Oh you…
You the type of girl that I could fell in love with
Hearing modern life
Modern life, yea

I hate more than half of the songs playin on the radio
Takes a lot more than that to do it for me

Look around in a restaurant, everybody’s on the phone
Is this really how we live on ice? Yea

Spending all my time getting that
Making the things that only to lose my mind
Talkin with you with that shit
Makes me feel to get the things around

[Chorus x2]
Oh you…
You the type of girl that I could fell in love with
Hearing modern life
Oh you…
You the type of girl that I could fell in love with
Hearing modern life
Modern life, yea

Come on and get it, come on and get it
I wanna give it to you
Come on and get it, come on and get it
‘Cus I wanna give it to you
Come on and get it, come on and get it
Baby yea yea girl
