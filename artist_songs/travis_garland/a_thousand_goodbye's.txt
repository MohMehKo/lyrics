[Verse 1:]
How many times, it's hard to say
That I've waken up next to with a note on the bed
Got on the plane, I'll be back next week
And left without so much as a kiss on the cheek

You're always gone and I'm never home
You taught me everything I know about being alone
What do I do when I need you, who do I call
When I don't wanna do it no more

[Hook:]
Oh I'm not trying to, making you hurt
But getting exactly what you deserve
So you can't tell me that I don't
Have every reason in this world to leave you right now

[Chorus:]
I can count a thousand times that you've made me cry
A thousand games you used to play
So I guess that's a thousand goodbye's
A thousand goodbye's is all that I have to say

[Verse 2:]
Tell me what you thinking
When I told you that me and you, we are finally over
Making a memory
That's ancient history
I know I can't help, but keep looking over my shoulder

Love is like a mark, it never goes away
And you got part of my heart that I forever gave away
What do I do when I need you, who do I call
Cause I don't wanna do this no more

[Hook:]
Oh I'm not trying to, making you hurt
(Getting exactly) Getting exactly what you deserve
(Oh) So you can't tell me that I don't
Have every reason in this world to leave you right now

[Chorus:]
I can count a thousand times that you've made me cry (a thousand times)
A thousand games you used to play
So I guess that's a thousand goodbye's
A thousand goodbye's is all that I have to say

[Bridge:]
There's nothing that's harder for me
In this world than to not be your girl
Mmmm
But I won't stand the cheating and lies
You're no kind of man
You won't get any respect from me
Cause you would never dare
You neglected me
I'd rather spend my nights with somebody
Who treats me like I'm supposed to be treated all along

[Talking:]
Man
I gave you everything
I gave you my time
I gave you my heart
But you couldn't give me anything in return
All them late nights
Worrying about you
A thousand times you didn't call
A thousand tears you never cried
All I have left for you is a thousand goodbye's

[Hook:]
I'm not trying (no no), making you hurt
Getting exactly what you deserve
So you can't tell me (tell me baby) that I don't (that you need me baby)
(Oh) Have every reason in this world to leave you right now

[Chorus:]
I can count a thousand times that you've made me cry
A thousand games you used to play (play)
So I guess that's a thousand goodbye's
A thousand goodbye's is all that I have to say
It's all that I have
It's all that I have to say
For all the lies
A thousand goodbye's
