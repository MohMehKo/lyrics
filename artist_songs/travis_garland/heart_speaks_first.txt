Standing on the other side of the road
With a tear in your eye
Wishing that I didn't act the way I do
Took it too far this time

I was filled with emotion
Instead of giving you space
Threw it in your face and I
You just wanted me closer
But I pushed you away

I made you scream 
I made you cry
I shouldn't have taken the stars from your sky
We're still a team
As much as it hurts
Remember that they're only words
My heart speaks first
So baby whenever it hurts
Remember that they're only words
My heart speaks first

Its hard for me to function when I know your sad
Like a robot in rain
And even though the hurts we feel was all my bad
Its till drives me insane (its making me crazy)
And you know that I love you
That I need you to be there
Like a table needs chairs my love
After all that we've been through
Please don't let it all slip away away

I made you scream 
I made you cry
I shouldn't have taken the stars from your sky
We're still a team
As much as it hurts
Remember that they're only words
My heart speaks first
So baby whenever it hurts
Remember that they're only words
My heart speaks first

And its telling me to
And its telling me to love you love you
My heart speaks first
And its telling me to
And its telling me to love you love you
Telling me to

I made you scream 
I made you cry
I shouldn't have taken the stars from your sky
We're still a team
As much as it hurts
Remember that they're only words
My heart speaks first
So baby whenever it hurts
Remember that they're only words
My heart speaks first

So baby whenever it hurts
Remember that they're only words
Remember that they're only words
My heart speaks first
