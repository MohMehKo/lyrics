Baby baby,
You've been thinkin' of me.
Baby baby
Just don't say you don't love me
I don't know if you heard 'bout me
I'm that type to up and leave
Listen in baby baby
Just say you don't need me

Oh oh-oh-oh
I'll change your life
Oh oh-oh-oh
Read between the lines

And, baby don't start it
Cause you really don't want it
I might break your heart at night
Don't wanna do that
Nobody got my bad man
Baby girl once you had it
Ain't no turning back, yeah

Let's fall in lust
Let's fall in lust
Let's fall in lust

One day take the chill alon' to get your lovin'
Is when I push up onto you got me feelin' somethin'
Baby I ain't tryin' to lead you onto nothin'
So if, that's cool, baby where you
Got somewhere we can go

Oh oh-oh-oh
I'll change your life
Oh oh-oh-oh
Set the bar so damn high
Yeah-eah-eah-eah-eah.

Baby don't start it
Cause you really don't want it
I might break your heart at night
Don't wanna do that
Nobody got my bad man
Baby girl once you had it
Ain't no turning back, yeah

Let's fall in lust
Let's fall in lust
Let's fall in lust
