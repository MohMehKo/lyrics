I know that you're tired of sleeping
Long in our bed yeah, yeah
Baby, you're not the reason
That I'm on to LA yeah, yeah

And maybe I should've let you go, run away
When you tried
But I can't bear the thought of you being
Anything but mine

Even chariots of fire couldn't carry me away
Could be racing to the sky but I'm holding on to stay
No one loves you like I love you
And the chariots of fire always bring you back to me

Don't go away

Saying that my profession is too much and you quit
But you knew what you signed up for the first time that we kissed
Don't act like you didn't, baby
And I know that it's complicated, but the best things usually are
I can't bear the thought of being with anyone else

Even chariots of fire couldn't carry me away
Could be racing to the sky but I'm holding on to stay
No one loves you like I love you
And the chariots of fire always bring you back to me

No one loves you quite like I do
No one loves you quite like I do
No one loves you quite like I do
'Cause baby, I do

Even chariots of fire couldn't carry me away
Could be racing to the sky but I'm holding on to stay
No one loves you like I love you
And the chariots of fire always bring you back to me

Don't go away
