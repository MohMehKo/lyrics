I know how you feel in side
You're in love and so am I
But you're with some other guy
I should be the one by your side

He cheated
Made you feel no good
I told you that he would
I knew he'd make you cry

You're broken
Let me make it better
Glue you back together
Just give me a try

Pretty pretty please
Don't you ever ever feel
Like you're less than
Fuckin perfect

If you get with me
I won't ever make you feel
Any less than fuckin perfect
You'll see

At his house you found her clothes
Tried to play you and say, "who's are those"
He's so stupid
Here's how I know
What kind of genius would let perfection go

He's conceited, only bout himself
He loves nobody else
He ain't even fly

You're broken
Let me make it better
Glue you back together
Just give me a try

Pretty pretty please
Don't you ever ever feel
Like you're less than
Fuckin perfect

If you get with me
I won't ever make you feel
Any less than fuckin perfect
You'll see

It's gonna take time girl
To heal that hole (he left)
Exactly how long, I don't know but
You got pain and I know a remedy
You gotta
Start kickin it with someone like me
Now you're overanalyzing all of your thoughts
Start to thinkin it's all your fault
But baby girl don't you go and blame yourself
He's just a douchebag [x2]

I was hopin
You'd let me replace him
I would straight erase him
Right out of your mind

Pretty pretty please
Don't you ever ever feel
Like you're less than
Fuckin perfect

If you get with me
I won't ever make you feel
Any less than fuckin perfect
You'll see

Pretty pretty please
Don't you ever ever feel
Like you're less than
Fuckin perfect

If you get with me
I won't ever make you feel
Any less than fuckin perfect
