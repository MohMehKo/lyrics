Baby, this is what you came for
Lightning strikes every time she moves
And everybody's watching her
But she's looking at you, oh, oh
You, oh, oh, you, oh, oh
You, oh, oh, you, oh, oh
You, oh, oh, oh, oh

Baby, this is what you came for
Lightning strikes every time she moves
And everybody's watching her
But she's looking at 
You, oh, oh, you, oh, oh
You, oh, oh, 
But she lookin' at
You, oh, oh, you, oh, oh

I can't get enough of you, babe
Bottles open up so you can try and open up for me, baby
M.I.A. in the M.I.A.
You do you, girl, the haters gon' hate
Cut them off like you a sensei, girl
Oh, I know you feel what I feel
Breaking you off, it's so real
I can't fake that, babe
My love's locked down and you cuffing it
You're the only one I trust with it
You're the only one that stuck with it 

It's about us right now, girl, where you going?
It's about us right now, girl, where you going?
I'm with you oh, oh
You oh oh ah
