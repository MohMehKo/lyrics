We've been hanging on by a thread
Holding on to what's in the past
When you can see it in my eyes
You know our loving is dead
Still we put on a show
Acting like it's gonna be alright
Clouds cover the stars up in your sky
And it's gonna rain
Just waking up one last lullaby
What kinda dream is this?

Used to be a sweet dream
Now you're a beautiful nightmare
Either way I just wanna sleep around
Sweet dream, now you're a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, I just wanna sleep around you
Without you, without you
Cause baby when I sleep around you
Around you, it ain't no sweet dream
It's just a beautiful nightmare

Can you tell me why we can't bag this?
Like we ain't had enough practice
You used to be so real
And now you're just so plastic
And if it's too broke don't fix it
Gotten away, then I've been found
I remember when we used to be so in sync
But baby those da-ay-ays is gone
I really, really wanna have sweet dreams
I don't wanna see your pretty face get mad
Baby girl, I used to love you oh so much
But you just made my dream into a pretty nightmare
I'm saying, were we ever in love
Maybe I daydreamed that
I know I gave you my heart
But baby I'm a need that back

Used to be a sweet dream
Now you're a beautiful nightmare
Either way I just wanna sleep around
Sweet dream, now you're a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, I just wanna sleep around you
Without you, without you
Cause baby when I sleep around you
Around you, it ain't no sweet dream
It's just a beautiful nightmare

Clouds cover the stars up in your sky
Guess we can have one last lullaby
My love, you used to be a sweet dream
Now you're a beautiful nightmare
Either way I just wanna sleep without you
Cause you're a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, I just wanna sleep without

Used to be a sweet dream
Now you're a beautiful nightmare
Either way I just wanna sleep around
Sweet dream, now you're a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, I just wanna sleep around you
Without you, without you
Cause baby when I sleep around you
Around you, it ain't no sweet dream
It's just a beautiful nightmare
Just a beautiful nightmare
You're such a beautiful nightmare
