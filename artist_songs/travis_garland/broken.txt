You know the secret to your mistakes
But you never tell it babe
Over and over the lines you traced
Your stuck in your selfish ways

Just a beautiful girl with a heart that's made of glass
Nobody would handle with care
And I gave you the world but now its starting to crack
And now your learning you don't have a prayer

So what makes you think that I'll be the one to
Take all your pain away and fix you
You shattered the pieces all over the floor beware
Girl your broken beyond repair

Beyond repair

I know the reason that I'm this way
But you should know better
Than to hold your heart in front of me I'm amazed
When I cant put you back together

Just a beautiful girl with a heart that's made of glass
Nobody would handle with care
And I gave you the world but now its starting to crack
And now your learning you don't have a prayer

So what makes you think that I'll be the one to
Take all your pain away and fix you
You shattered the pieces all over the floor beware
Girl your broken beyond repair

Just a beautiful girl with a heart 
That made of glass
And I gave you the world, 
But now it's starting to crack

So what it makes you think I'll be the one to
Take all your pain away and fix you
Your shattered the pieces all over the floor beware
Girl you're broken beyond repair
You're broken beyond repair
You're broken beyond repair

You shattered the pieces all over the floor beware
Girl you're broken beyond repair
Broken beyond repair
Broken beyond repair
Broken beyond repair
