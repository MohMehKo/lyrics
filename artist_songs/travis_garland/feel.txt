Is it too late for saving me now?
It might be, baby
All I know is that this won’t be
Last time that I let you down
But I’m tryin, girl I swear

I wanna feel
I wanna feel
Something, something
Anything
(We’ll be getting by, chasing every high, tell me something)

Just make me feel
Just make me feel
Something, something
Anything
(We’ll be getting by, chasing every high, tell me something)

In my veins
Nothing but acids now
Burning flame
Til you came in but went out
And now your love, it’s gone away

I wanna feel
I wanna feel
Something, something
Anything
(We’ll be getting by, chasing every high, tell me something)

Just make me feel
Just make me feel
Something, something
Anything
(We’ll be getting by, chasing every high, tell me something)

Some say he’s something like a murderer
Love er, never heard of er
She ain’t heard of me so I’m never holding a calendar
But she want me to watch how I handle her
But when you ain’t lookin you just live with the damaged
Boot off the stage like an amateur
No experience in front of the cameras
It’s cut both, beat it from the heart like what
Am I hit? Must be the Novocain cuz I don’t feel shit
Cooper’s got a gun and that nigga won’t quit
Ain’t even full but I have enough of it
So I split, I’m on a fence with 2
It’s full a top down like screw
Enjoy the view, cuz when it’s all said and done no level is your final one of violence

Wanna feel something, feel something
I wanna feel...
Tryna feel something
Something, something
Anything
(We’ll be getting by, chasing every high, tell me something)

Just make me feel
Just make me feel
Something, something
Anything
(We’ll be getting by, chasing every high, tell me something)
