What’s up for the evening? 
I’m dyin' to know
I picture you and me in a room all alone
Pushin’ shit off of the counter
Straight to the floor
Hittin’ the ground at the same time as all of your clothes

[Hook:]
Girl you’re really gonna need a maid
To clean up the mess we made
No need to be ashamed
Nothin’ wrong with breakin’ things
Ooh girl
I turned you into a home, homewrecker
I turned you into a home, homewrecker 

I’m interested in your body
And that look on your face
Ain’t nothin’ more overrated than material things
Shatterin’ all the dishes
Flowers out of the vase
The consequences of our actions left all over the place
Yeeahh

[Hook]

We can do whatever you want to
I know you like it rough girl 
Girl you’re really gonna need a maid
No need to be ashamed
I turned you into a home, homewrecker
I turned you into a home, homewrecker
Homewrecker
I know you like it rough girl
We can do whatever you want to

I’ve been feedin’ off these haters man, feedin’ all of my life
Middle finger out my window screamin Texas till I die
Tomorrow ain’t never promised so I’m living just for tonight
So show me how you handle your business girl
Show me the way that you ride
And I just tell em sit up on my lap in the cab of my Chevrolet 
We can take it back to the pad
Make you feel at home, home
(I’ll make you feel at home, I’ll make you feel at home, make you feel right at home) 
And I just tell em sit up on my lap in the cab of my Chevrolet 
We can take it back to the pad
Make you feel at home, home
(I’ll make you feel at home, I’ll make you feel at home, make you feel right at home)
