Ohh
I'm all about you, you, you.
Yeah, yeah.

Baby, trust me I know it's hard.
He don't, listen.
It's breaking your heart
He's always about me this, me that
But baby you don't, even need that.
You just giving, he just takes back.
I don't know why you stick around

Cause ah, ah you're so beautiful
Talking about ah, ha, ah no one loves you more
I'm all about you, you, you
All about you, you, you
I'm all about you, you, you
All about you
All about you (Ay)
All about you, you, you (Ay)

I know, all your favorite songs.
And when you fall asleep in the movies
I'm always driving you home
Cause if you didn't notice, 
When he ain't around
That I'm always there, 
That I'm holding you down
And I know you're feeling, 
How I'm feeling, 
When we say goodnight.

Do you joke we could never be
Everything and all you need
Girl you're to sexy not to see
Just how special you are

Cause ah, ah you're so beautiful
Talking about ah, ha, ah no one loves you more
I'm all about you, you, you
All about you, you, you
I'm all about you, you, you
All about you
All about you (Ay)
All about you, you, you (Ay)

It's all about you baby

Look, they labeling me the ladies man
Without you, 
All I see is black and grey like a radial span
And I wanna learn, 
So baby be the tutor mayn
I'll let you go and get you back, 
Our love is boomerang
And yeah, 
I don't believe that love is overrated
And beautiful towards you, 
Is a understatement
And when you cry serve a tissue like an ACL
We were meant to be, 
Zack and Kelly saved by the bell.

Cause ah, ah you're so beautiful
Talking about ah, ha, ah no one loves you more
I'm all about you, you, you
All about you, you, you
I'm all about you, you, you
All about you
All about you (Ay)
All about you, you, you (Ay)
