You can have all my attention if you want it babe
Just tell me what you feel. What you feel, what you think of me.
I forgot talk is cheap with the gold you giving babe.
You mean every word you say. Don’t you babe?
Tell me you'll ride for me. Shovels and Duct tape for my enemies.
Lock it in tight for me.. Promise you'll swallow the key.

She knows where the bodies are buried.
She ain't telling nobody, nobody
She knows where the bodies are buried.
She knows, yeah she knows.

Fill the trunks up with speed bump
Caught her looking in the rear view
Got your lips locked, no snitch
I can still gag you if you want babe
Got your legs up on my dashboard, no fuck
Shawty said she bout it, you just so quiet
Be blowing all the lotties. She would do a pill for me.

And now you got a dirty little secret for me to keep
Baby it's so deep.

She ain't say a thing, baby let me do the smooth talking
They let us off, but just a warning
But if they knew what we know.

She ain't telling nobody, nobody (nobody yeah)
She knows where the bodies are buried.
