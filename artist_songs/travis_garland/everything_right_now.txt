Baby you're the moon far above me, I just want you close
I'm what you desire so don't try to love me cause you can't have them both
Ooh, pretty little thing, you know what I want, want it all

Everything, everything, I want everything, everything
I want everything, everything, I want everything, everything right now
Everything, everything, I want everything, everything
I want everything, everything, I want everything, everything right now

Borrowed all your life 'till it's shattered, now you gotta steal
Fire in my bones just to matter, when nothing's even real, I want it all

Everything, everything, I want everything, everything
I want everything, everything, I want everything, everything right now
Everything, everything, I want everything, everything
I want everything, everything, I want everything, everything right now

My friends call me Tanya
Mine call me Bond, James Bond
Your luck has just changed
Over and out
You know what I want
I want it all

Everything, everything, I want everything, everything
I want everything, everything, I want everything, everything right now
Everything, everything, I want everything, everything
I want everything, everything, I want everything, everything right now
