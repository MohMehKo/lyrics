Girl just one look in your sun water blue eyes
That’s all it took, for me
You got me shook,
Please don’t take this the wrong way but you should fuck with me
And I just want you closer,
Every single time you be looking at me that way
And I just can’t get over,
It’s written in the clouds, and on your face

[Chorus:]
Then my sky falls the moment that I saw you standing there
When time froze, a color in a field of gray
Your beauty hangs alone,
There’s nothing in the world like blue electric roses girl
Blue electric roses girl
But girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
But girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
But girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
Blue electric roses girl
Blue electric roses girl

Don’t go nowhere, you ain’t got no place to go
Girl stay right here for me
I don’t ṗlay fair when it comes to lovin’ you
I ain’t gone share baby
And i just want you closer
Uh every single time looking at me that way
And I just can’t get over,
It’s written in the clouds, and on your face

[Chorus:]
Then my sky falls the moment that I saw you standing there,
When time froze, a color in a field of gray
Your beauty hangs alone,
There’s nothing in the world like blue electric roses girl
Blue electric roses girl

You know I’m into girl and crazy for you
And all your blue electric roses can’t be rinsed when the ocean will get to you
Love at first I saw you, I told myself I’ll never let you go, let you go

[Chorus:]
Then my sky falls the moment that I saw you standing there,
When time froze, a color in a field of gray
Your beauty hangs alone,
There’s nothing in the world like blue electric roses girl
Blue electric roses girl
But girl, girl, girl, girl, girl,
You could be
But girl, girl, girl, girl, girl,
You could be that one thing for me
But girl, girl, girl, girl, girl,
Girl I just wanna stay
Blue electric roses girl
Blue electric roses girl
Yeah, yeah
