Try, try to break it do at least a thousand times 
There's an emptiness in side me when she's far away 
That I can't erase and I go insane till I see your face 
And I shout cause the silence when she's gone is way too loud 
I gotta get my head together 
Cause I'm not okay 
I'm just not the same 
I'm just trying to make it 
She's my everything 
And I 

[Chorus:]
Can't stop my heart from racing 
I need you here by my side 
I feel the walls closing in 
Baby, your saving my life 
One kiss at a time 
I can't live without you 
And I don't wanna try 
Saving my life 
Cause you're the air that I breath 
There ain't no world without you 
I'm hanging on by a thread 
Baby, you're saving my life 
One kiss at a time 
I can't life without you 
And I don't wanna try 
Saving my life 

You're the one who picks me up when I am down 

When the trials and tribulations get hard 
Deep inside my heart 
I let down my guard 
You're the light in the dark 
So stay 
You're the reason why I make it through each day 
There's a storm raging inside my when she's far away 
That I can't escape 
And i go insane 
Till I see her face 
Oh 

[Chorus:]

Staring into you like a dream 
Oh 
Breathe into me 
I'm not giving up 
I'm never giving up 
Because you're saving my life 
I need you tonight 

[Chorus:]

I need you tonight 
I need you tonight
