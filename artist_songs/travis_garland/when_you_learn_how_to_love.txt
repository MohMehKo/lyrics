[Verse 1:]
I loved I lost
I swung I missed
And still kept playing
You stole my heart
And by default
You're still standing
And you can pat me on my back
And send me on my way
You'll see me smile
But all the while I'm torn up

[Hook:]
And I don't wish you pain (pain)
But I don't wish you well (well)
'Cause you deserve the reign (reign)
To see how it fails

[Chorus:]
When you learn how to love
You're gonna cry for me
But it's gonna be too late
It's gonna be too late
When you learn how to love
You're gonna breathe for me
But it's gonna be too late
It's gonna be too late
When you learn how to love

[Verse 2:]
You knew me well
But still it felt
You were my stranger
My tears you swam across
To let me down
And through the fog
I thought I saw your helping hand
But my eyes were closed
And it felt a broken heart

[Hook]

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
All you might have loved
You'll never know till it's gone
So far baby now
Now all you got is your
Tear drops on your needy heart
So cry for me

[Chorus x2]
