Understand
First thing, baby girl, that I am no longer your man.
That doesn't mean, you and me can't be the closest of friends
(And you know)
I even found myself a new girl
(You know)
Fallin' in love with my new girlfriend
Frankly, you know you'll always be in my heart
In my heart
But now

Things are different
You're being too good for me
Don't wanna second guess, baby I gotta be
You're not the girl I knew, now you're like someone new
No I don't want to leave, but I know what I gotta do

[Chorus:]
This is your song
Thanks for all the memories
This is your song
Thanks for everything we use to be
This is your song
Listen to it when I'm gone (When I'm gone)

Next thing you need to know that I ain't even tryin' compete
'Cause I'm your best friend
You should know that
No one can be what you are to me
(And I know)
You got some kind of me replacement
(You know)
I'm not the type that you can be replacin'
And I see, you never meant to be breakin' my heart
But it's hard
But now

Things are different
You're being too good for me
Don't wanna second guess, but baby I gotta be
You're not the girl I knew, now you're like someone new
No I don't want to leave but I know what I gotta do

[Chorus:]
This is your song
Thanks for all the memories
This is your song
Thanks for everything we use to be
This is your song (Hey)
Listen to it when I'm gone (When I'm gone)

You actin' good for me
Like you just too good for me
Better treat me better see
'Cause I'm going to be before for too long
This is your song
Listen to it when I'm gone

You actin' good for me
Like you just too good for me
Better treat me better see
'Cause I'm going to be before for too long
This is your song
Listen to it when I'm gone

[Chorus:]
This is your song
Thanks for all the memories
This is your song
Thanks for everything we use to be
(Everything we couldn't be)
This is your song
Listen to it when I'm gone

[Chorus:]
This is your song
(Things are different you're bein too good for me)
This is your song
This is your song
(You're not the girl I knew now your like someone new)
This is your song
Listen to it when I'm gone

Thanks for all the memories
Here's to everything we couldn't be
This is your song
Listen to it when I'm gone, yeah
