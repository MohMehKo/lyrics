Could we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
I'm praying that this stairway
Leads somewhere, like Heaven's door
And when you get there don't look down
Don't look down, don't look down

I remember the first day of school
When you walked right next to me
You taught me everything that I know
And you always knew what to say
Time goes on, now every word
In ever damn song reminds me of your face
You were a part of me, you were a part of me
I didn't know everything I've got
Now I know that you are gone
Feel you right here next to me
Though I know that you've moved on
But the hardest thing of all
Is knowing I didn't get to say
You were everything, you were everything

Could we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
I'm praying that this stairway
Leads somewhere, like Heaven's door
And when you get there don't look down
Don't look down, don't look down

And all the people say, and all the people say
Listen, people kill what they don't understand
All the legends die at the hands of lesser men
Jesus and JFK and Marvin and Biggie man, I
Wonder if life after death was ever fair for them
Live in the moment, I was never really one to plan
So many things I wasn't meant to ever understand
What if Alice imagined her trip to wonderland
And why didn't Paul have shoes 
Like the rest of them did
So many memories I passed up when I was away
And all the experience I couldn't ever replace
The million times my heart had a part of it break
I guess I'm harder for the hardships I had to face
Before every single show I pray 'till I sweat
I give my heart to a thousand people I never met
And then I let it all go, all the pain and regret
Hope God forgive for the sins I'm about to commit
Don't wanna get by, I want to excel
I know life's like the crossroad for Heaven & hell
Right & wrong, sometimes it's just so hard to tell
At least I'm saving others if I'm losing myself

Could we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
I'm praying that this stairway
Leads somewhere, like Heaven's door
And when you get there don't look down
Don't look down, don't look down

Could we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now
