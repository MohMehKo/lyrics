Baby girl you’re so fine
You’re tighter than a bowtie
You hot looking, don’t try

Going out without your girls, you’re putting on your makeup
Taking a little more time just to fix your hair
Painting your nails your favorite shade of purple

I know you’re insecure, change your outfit three or four times
You wanna hide your shape, but girl, you look so fine
And I know you put in so much hard work, but let me say

Darling, you make it look so easy
Darling, you make me look so good
Other girls, they have to try so hard
But you don’t
Darling, you make it look so easy

Baby girl you’re so fine
You’re tighter than a bowtie
You hot looking, don’t try

I know you’ve been working out, eating right
Girl, you about your fitness, working the 9 to 5
Just to pay your bills
And when the way you can’t just let go, take over the dance floor
And let me say that

Darling, you make it look so easy
Darling, you make me look so good
Other girls, they have to try so hard
But you don’t
Darling, you make it look so easy

So don’t you listen to all them other hoes, the shit they talking
It’s only ‘cause they know
You look too good, you move too good, shake that ass too good
Oh, man

Baby girl you’re so fine
You’re tighter than a bowtie
You hot looking, don’t try

Darling, you make it look so easy
Darling, you make me look so good
Other girls, they have to try so hard
But you don’t
Darling, you make it look so easy

So don’t you listen to all them other hoes, the shit they talking
It’s only ‘cause they know
You look too good, you move too good, shake that ass too good
Oh, man

You make it look easy, make it look easy
Look so easy, look so easy
Make it look easy, make it look easy, yeah
Look so easy, oh
Make it look easy, make it look easy
Look so easy, look so easy
Make it look easy, make it look easy, yeah
Look so easy, oh
Make it look easy, make it look easy
Look so easy, look so easy
Make it look easy, make it look easy
Look so easy
Make it look easy, make it look easy
Look so easy, look so easy
Make it look easy, make it look easy
Look so easy
Make it look easy, make it look easy
Look so easy, look so easy
Make it look easy, make it look easy
Look so easy
Make it look easy, make it look easy
Make it look easy, make it look easy
