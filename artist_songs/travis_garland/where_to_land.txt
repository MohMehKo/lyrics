[Verse]
Save me, I’m falling through the sky, yeah
Into the water, I’m drowning in your eyes
So cool on the surface,
The stars all aligned just perfect
Leading me here to you
So take me, let’s get caught up in the night
Right?

[Chorus]
Why don’t you tell me where to land?
Yeah, yeah, baby
I’m falling right into your hands
Yeah, yeah baby

Tell me you want that feeling, 
Tell me you want emotion
Tell me our love is deeper, 
Tell me it’s like the ocean

[Verse]
Closer (come here) 
I’m moving to your cloud, yeah, yeah
Girl I can’t wait for you to catch me
The best part is falling down

So cool on the surface,
The stars all aligned just perfect
Leading me here to you

[Chorus]
Why don’t you tell me where to land?
Yeah, yeah, baby
I’m falling right into your hands
Yeah, yeah baby

Tell me you want that feeling, 
Tell me you want emotion
Tell me our love is deeper, 
Tell me it’s like the ocean

[Rap]
You’re out of this atmosphere, out of this world premiere
Out of control, swerving, catch me or I’m outta here
Helicopter spinning got me falling from the top
On your windowed roof, x marking the spot
You’re the living proof, lookin proper on my arm
Matching diamonds, perfect timing, you’re my favorite looking strong
Oh you so precious like a baby first born
Nowadays these kids are crazy like the children of the corn
But I won’t do you no harm
I put it like this, lay you up against the wall
Pulls, apple, miss, that’s the picture that I’d pay for
Give you something to stay for,
Like alligators I twist you, Darth Vader fade to black
No more issues

[Chorus x2]
Why don’t you tell me where to land?
Yeah, yeah, baby
I’m falling right into your hands
Yeah, yeah baby

Tell me you want that feeling, 
Tell me you want emotion
Tell me our love is deeper, 
Tell me it’s like the ocean
