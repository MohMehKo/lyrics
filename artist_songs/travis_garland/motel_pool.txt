Babe...
I can tell that you need to get away
Don't say a word, it's written on your face
I know that you've been going through it
One of those lonely summer nights

I know it's hard
Don't mind the heat, just hop into my car
And I got the space, I'll take you to the stars
Girl you don't, don't have to talk about it
I'm gon' make everything alright

She said I can't be
Here right now
I told her come with me
I'll slow your whole world down

'Cause we drove way too far
Now it's just you and me in the dark
Baby I'll take the weight from your heart
Wash the worries off your mind tonight
Let's dive into the motel pool
Into the motel pool
Let me fall into your motel pool
Wash the worries off your mind tonight

We got all night
Layin with you under the neon lights
Floating together suspecting in time
They probably looking for us
But girl there's nothing to find
We won't get caught
Keep your voice down, we don't want them to hear
Whisper all of your troubles in my ear
And I'll make them vanish for you
But tell me where is your mind

She said I can't be
Here right now
I told her come with me
I slow your whole world down

'Cause we drove way too far
Now it's just you and me in the dark
Baby I'll take the weight from your heart
Wash the worries off your mind tonight
Let's dive into the motel pool
Into the motel pool
Let me fall into your motel pool
Wash the worries off your mind tonight

And when you see the moonlight falling on your skin
I know I would do... anything... for you
So don't you be afraid of nothing, just dive in
I'm going to make you see that you're safe with me
'Cus baby we
('Cus we drove way too far)
Drove way too far

Now it's just you and me in the dark
Baby I'll take the weight from your heart
Wash the worries off your mind tonight
Cus we drove way too far
Now it's just you and me in the dark
Baby I'll take the weight from your heart
Wash the worries off your mind tonight
Then I would dive into the motel pool
Into the motel pool
Then I would dive into your motel pool
Into the motel pool
Wash the worries off your mind tonight

Motel pool, into the motel pool
Let me fall into your motel pool
Wash the worries off your mind tonight
