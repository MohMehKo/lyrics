You got what I want, so let's talk about it
Your body's in the zone and I'm all about it
And now you're telling me you're frustrated
Cause your man ain't been on his job, listen here
All of your requests, baby I'll provide it
Call up UPS, we're 'bout to over night it
Hate to make it rain, baby I'm a silver lining
Now I feel something rising, oh

Cause I'll be your last man standing
I'll give it, I'll give it, I'll give it to you longer
Going and going and going until the morning
Keep you awake all night
I'll give it, I'll give it, I'll give it to you longer
Going and going and going until the morning

Slip it down, shirt off
If you got buttons, I'll rip 'em off
Lights down, real low
Turn the music up and let's go

I can tell you need some satisfaction
Take a trip with me, see what I'm packing
Hear me when I say, I'm always keeping
Your needs above my own, baby girl
I can knock 'em out like automatic
Bend you all around like acrobatics
Take you all the way, baby I got the magic
Anything, you can have it when you with me

I'll be your last man standing
I'll give it, I'll give it, I'll give it to you longer
Going and going and going until the morning
Keep you awake all night
I'll give it, I'll give it, I'll give it to you longer
Going and going and going until the morning

[Flash:]
Could you imagine, I memorized what you're fantasizing
Know how it sounds when you say your name right after mine
Now say it back the other way a couple hundred times
Don't 'tell your nigga, my spot is G14 classified
How I admire your Analect and your bra size
As I inspire you, run away 'till the sun rise
You sound more one, going for the long run
All I really need is one shot, golden gun

[Travis Garland:]
I'll be the last man standing
I'll give it, I'll give it, I'll give it to you longer
Going and going and going until the morning
Keep you awake all night
I'll give it, I'll give it, I'll give it to you longer
Going and going and going until the morning

Slip it down, shirt off
If you got buttons, I'll rip 'em off
Lights down, real low
Turn the music up and let's go
