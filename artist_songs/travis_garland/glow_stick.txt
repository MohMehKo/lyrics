From the moment I saw you
The stars didn't seem so bright
When I got to know you
Girl you lit up my life
Through the night you lead me
To a place they can't see
Where we can just be alone
From the look on your eyes
Is on both of our minds
Don't act like you don't know

Cause you're shining like a glow stick
Girl, your body's so sick, everybody knows it
I don't know if you notice
Girl, you got me open
Trying not to show it
It's the way your skin glows
When we're lost in the dark
And when you touch my body
I can feel the beat of your heart
I've never felt this way before but tonight

Let's go to somewhere you've only fantasized
I wanna hold you in the darkness
Girl, I've never felt so alive
Through the night you lead me
To a place they can't see
Where we can just be alone
From the look on your eyes
It's on both of our minds
Don't act like you don't know

Cause you're shining like a glow stick
Girl, your body's so sick, everybody knows it
I don't know if you notice
Girl, you got me open
Trying not to show it
It's the way your skin glows
When we're lost in the dark
And when you touch my body
I can feel the beat of your heart
I've never felt this way before but tonight

Girl, let the neon lights run through your body
I'm in a trance and nothing is gonna stop me
Just take my hand and I'll let you lead the way
Girl, let the neon lights run through your body
I'm in a trance and nothing is gonna stop me
Just take my hand and I'll let you lead the way

Cause you're shining like a glow stick
Girl, your body's so sick, everybody knows it
I don't know if you notice
Girl, you got me open
Trying not to show it
It's the way your skin glows
When we're lost in the dark
And when you touch my body
I can feel the beat of your heart
I've never felt this way before but tonight

It's the way your skin glows
When we're lost in the dark
And when you touch my body
I can feel the beat of your heart
I've never felt this way before but tonight

It's the way you glow, glow, glow, glow
It's the way you glow
