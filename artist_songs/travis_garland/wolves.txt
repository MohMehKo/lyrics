Don't get lost in the fog or caught up in the vapor
'Cause you sure ain't the alpha, you ain't no omega.
Going all the way up, don't miss my elevator. Hey.
You ain't fuck with me now, then don't fuck with me later. Later.

Don't say I didn't warn you
It's a cold world out there

'Cause you know...
That when moon comes out at night
Is when the wolves come out to play
And if the mood hits you just right
Be sure you're not the prey...

So load up all your guns and all your ammunition
'Cause we're hunting for blood in the name of ambition
Show their teeth when they smile but there's always a motive
Hang you up on the wall before you even know it, know it

Don't say I didn't warn you
It's a cold world out there

'Cause you know
That when moon comes out at night
Is when the wolves come out to play
And if the mood hits you just right
Be sure you're not the prey

Careful who you run with...
Watch your pack
'Cause when you least expect it that's the moment they'll attack
Clear and present danger...
Chasing thrills.
Fighting to survive out here, it's kill or be killed

'Cause when the moon comes out at night
Is when the wolves come out to play.
And if the mood hits you just right,
Be sure you're not the prey... (Make sure you watch your back cause they want)

And when the moon comes out at night
Is when the wolves come out to play
And if the mood hits you just right
Make sure you're not the prey
