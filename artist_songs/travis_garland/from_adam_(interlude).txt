Every time I see you, I don't know
Don't know what the hell I’m about to say
Why am I so afraid of falling in love?
Your beauty keeps on getting in my way

Say the wrong way to love somebody
Yeah
Just the wrong way to tell someone
Ooh

Tryna make you understand I'm the kind of man that would treat you like
The perfect girl everybody knows you are
But you don't know me from Adam
And I don't know you from Eve
And if my words don’t come out right
I hope you feel what I mean

Singing woohoohoo
Singing woohoohoo
Singing yeeheeyeee
Singing yeeheeyeee
