Who'da thought you'd a turn out like this?
Girl you're so fine yea
Stole my heart way back when we was just kids
Stayed on my mind

I would pull your braids, then I'd run away like boys do
You were mean to me probably cause you liked me too
But girl once you get grown -
Grown into that woman of the Lord
Cause baby girl inside, you and I have known so much more

Abby Lee, have your way with me, Yeah
Abby Lee, I'm starting to believe (starting to believe)
Abby Lee

What you think? I know you like to have a good time
(Like to have a good time, good time)
Forgive me God cause I've got sinful things on my mind
Girl you think 'em too, don't act like your thoughts is so clean
And it felt so good the night you tempted me in those jeans
I ain't gonna lie, I wanna take you down to the floor
Cause baby girl inside, you and I have known so much more

Abby Lee, have your way with me (have your way with me baby)
Abby Lee, I believe, take me
Starting to believe, Abby Lee
Abby Lee (oh baby)
Have your way with me
Have your way, have your way with me
Abby Lee, starting to believe
Starting to believe, Abby Lee

Cause I know you've been thinking about me
I've been thinking bout you too girl
We all go through temptation
But hear me out when I tell you this
We can get through it together
It feels like the Lord wants you to be with me
Can I please get a witness y'all?
Let me take you to church baby

Abby Lee, yea yea
Have your way with me (your way with me baby)
Abby Lee, Abby baby
Yea, I'm starting to believe (starting to believe, Abby Lee)
Abby Lee, have your way with me
Come on, have your way, have your way with me
Abby Lee, I'm starting, starting to believe
Starting to believe
Starting to believe oh oh na na na na na na
