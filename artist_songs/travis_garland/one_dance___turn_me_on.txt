Baby, I like your style...

Grips on your waist, 
Front way, back way, 
You know that I don't play, 
Streets not safe, 
But I never run away 
Even when I'm away. 
Oti, oti, there's never much love when we go OT, 
I pray to make it back in one piece,
I pray, I pray.

That's why I need a one dance, 
Got a Hennessy in my hand, 
One more time ‘fore I go, 
Higher powers takin' a hold on me.

Baby, I like your style...

For the longest we were jamming in the party. 
And you're wining on me,
Pushing everything 
Right back on top of me (Yea – hey)
But if you think you're gonna get away from me, 
You better change your mind. 
You're coming home...
You're coming home with me tonight...

So let me hold you, 
Girl caress my body.
You got me going crazy, you 
Turn me on, turn me on. 
Let me jam you,
Girl wine all around me. 
You got me going crazy, you 
Turn me on, turn me on, yeah.

Hug me, hug me, hit me, scream me
Hug me, hug me, kiss & caress me
Hug me, hug me, kiss me, squeeze me
Hug me, hug me, kiss & caress me

Tell me, I need to know, where do you wanna go? 
Cause if you're down, I'll take it slow,
Make you lose control.

Where, where, where, where, where, where, where? [x2]
Cause if you're down [x3]

I need a one dance, 
Got a Hennessy in my hand, 
One more time 'fore I go, 
Higher powers takin' a hold on me.
