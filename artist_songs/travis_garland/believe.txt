I'm looking at the future, I see it in your face
I don't know where you came from, you came from
But girl, you can tell me on the way
I ain't no Casanova and I'm not spitting u no game
Your heart's been broken over and over
But I'll make you trust in love again

You know way too many of these same old guys
They tell way too many of these same old lies
Girl I ain't just anybody, put your faith in me
I will make you believe, believe, yeah

I used to be so lonely, this lonely man
Felt like a man up on the moon
The stars were my directions, directions
Leading me straight here to you

You know way too many of these same old guys
They tell way too many of these same old lies
Girl I ain't just anybody, put your faith in me
I will make you believe, believe, yeah

I'm gonna make believe, I'm gonna make believe
I'm gonna make believe, I'm gonna make believe

Hello heart, let me in
All your cracks, I'm gonna mend
Hello heart, let me in
I'm gonna make you trust again

You know way too many of these same old guys
They tell way too many of these same old lies
Girl I ain't just anybody, put your faith in me
I will make you believe, believe, yeah

I'm gonna make believe, I'm gonna make believe
I'm gonna make believe, I'm gonna make believe

I'm gonna make believe, I'm gonna make believe
I'm gonna make believe, I'm gonna make believe
