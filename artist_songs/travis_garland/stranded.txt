Wondering without a vision
You made it your mission
To rescue my heart
Was blind before
Girl, I didn't notice
You put it in focus
Right from the start

[Chorus:]
But now we're going different ways
You chose this road on your own
I got my direction from you girl
You're my star
And now there's nothing you can say
To convince you not to leave me alone
And there's nothing you can say
To convince you not to leave me alone
How am I suppose
To find my way in the dark?
I'm stuck in the middle of nowhere
Searching for a way to get home
Wish I could call but
We don't even talk anymore
Feels like I'm stranded
All on my own
(Feels like I'm stranded All on my own)
Stranded (My own)
Stranded (My own)
Stranded
Stranded
(All on my own)
Stranded (My own)
Stranded (My own)
Stranded
Stranded
(Feels like I'm stranded All on my own)

Girl just tell me why are you changing
Going insane shouldn't bring it along
It's like you faded away
And I'm begging you stay
For I'm holding a stranger
Here in my arms

[Chorus]

Ooh ooh ooh
Now that you're gone
I've got to learn
Make my own way
I'm moving on
I'm leaving without you

I'm stuck in the middle of nowhere
Searching for a way to get home
Wish I could call but
We don't even talk anymore
Feels like I'm stranded
All on my own
(Feels like I'm stranded All on my own)
Stranded (My own)
Stranded (My own)
Stranded
Stranded
(All on my own)
Stranded (My own)
Stranded (My own)
Stranded
Stranded
(Feels like I'm stranded All on my own)

Wondering without a vision
You made it you mission
To rescue my heart
Ooh...
