[Verse 1]
You’ve been hiding it all for so long.
They can’t see there’s a war going on.
Because what you think of me conflicts what you feel for me.
Baby it’s hard. I know.
I’ve been trying to stay on the low.
Just to let you figure it out on your own.
Your feelings are clear 
but all your friends in your ear keep saying that I’m no good
For you.

[Bridge]
You’re so perfect to me
Nothing’s changed the way I feel at all.
If I stay down, You’ll come around.
Eventually, ooh oo woah

[Chorus]
Used to say..It was only a matter of time
‘fore your heart matters more than your mind.
You try to fight it, and I don’t know why.
You didn’t stand a chance. 
I'm convinced from the moment I tasted your lips.
All I needed is just one kiss
You tried to fight it, but I knew right then.
You didn’t stand a chance at all.

[Verse 2]
Showed you
All of the cards in my hand
So you’d know exactly where I stand.
And You’re like a glass right at the edge of the table.
Just waiting to fall, fall, fall.

[Bridge]
Girl you’re perfect to me
Nothing’s changed the way I feel at all.
If I stay down, You’ll come around.
Eventually

[Chorus]
I used to say..It was only a matter of time
‘fore your heart matters more than your mind.
You try to fight it, and I don’t know why.
You didn’t stand a chance. 
I’m convinced from the moment I tasted your lips.
All I needed was just one kiss
You tried to fight it, but I knew right then.
You didn’t stand a chance at all.

[Chorus]
Used to say..It was only a matter of time
‘fore your heart matters more than your mind.
You try to fight it, and I don’t know why.
You didn’t stand a chance. 
I'm convinced from the moment I tasted your lips.
All I needed was just one kiss
You tried to fight it, I knew right then.
I didn’t stand a chance at all.
