Hear you now when the winds blows and I fall
Who do you blame when it ain't nobody's fault
Crushed a rose and my hand made it bleed
Why do you keep coming back to me
I don't know where we go
But I hope summer's raining
Don't leave me
Where do we go?

[Chorus:]
Why can't I let you rest in peace
Trying to bury that but I need you
God if you're listening forgive me please
Why can't I let you rest in peace
Yeah, na na na

August fall just like rain to the ground
Crashing shelves but they don't make a sound
What is love I don't know what it means

Some of my heart understands it seems it seems
I just wanna be near you baby
I just wanna be near you baby
I'm waiting here alone oh oh oh

[Chorus:]
Why can't I let you rest in peace
Trying to bury the part of me
God if you're listening I'm on my knees
Why can't I let you rest in peace

Sing for the past, all is now,
What is go, what is go, what is go
Empty dreams tell me you're looking down

[Chorus:]
Why can't I let you rest in peace
Not when I know it should've been me
God if you're listening forgive me please
Why can't I let you rest in peace
Yeah, na na na, na na na, na na na.
