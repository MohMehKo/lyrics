It's crazy, yeah
'Cause I wasn't even trying to love you, my baby
Just like a movie
How you walked into my life that way

And I know you probably heard everything I never said
Oh, baby
But baby, you're much more precious than one in a million

How can I describe you?
You're so much more than beautiful
Perfect ain't enough to explain all you are

You're the only one, you're the only one
Darling, you are the 1 of 1
You're the only one, you're the only one
Darling, you are the 1 of 1

Ladies, you're the prototype for perfection
Ain't you, girl?
And trust me, you're limited edition
And I'm keeping you, girl, always

And I know you probably heard everything I never said
Oh, baby
But baby, you're much more precious than one in a million

How can I describe you?
You're so much more than beautiful
Perfect ain't enough to explain all you are

You're the only one, you're the only one
Darling, you are the 1 of 1
You're the only one, you're the only one
Darling, you are the 1 of 1

You're the only one, you're the only one
Darling, you are the 1 of 1
You're the only one, you're the only one
Darling, you are the 1 of 1

You're the only one, you're the only one
Darling, you are the 1 of 1
You're the only one, you're the only one
Darling, you are the 1 of 1
