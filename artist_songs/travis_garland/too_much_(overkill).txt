Hollywood is bright
So bright you can't see the stars
I look up at the sky at night to see where you are
Static in the air outside its shocking my skin
I really shouldn't care so much but I am already in

Na uh did I go to far boy yo better keep my name up out your mouth
Checkin on my girl I go to hard if you keep on lookin Imma knock you out
Now I'm Locked up in the back seat of a cop car 5 O tryna read my rights I just went to hard,
You just went a little too far Now I know, overkill

Too much of a damn good thing, overkill, ain't much of a damn good thing, overkill.
Too much of a damn good thing, is not all bad. overkill. whoaaa.
Too much of a damn good time, overkill ain't much of a damn good time. overkill.
Hey fellas cuz my whole life is not all bad.

We do it too much we gonna need to slow it down,
Do it to much we gon need to slow it down,
Do it too much we gon need to slow it down, do it too much...

Yeah we load a gun and I'm hanging on a string,
Another couple shots go down your bodys killin me,
Your lookin kinda fine, got me ready to attack,
Another sip of .. before we both just slip on out the back.

Uh oh did I go to far, now I'm wakin up alone in an empty house,
Lookin at the pictures and the videos, and the cellphone gotta keep the volume down (?)
When the suns up get my clothes on gotta get home, how'd I get myself into this shit
I just went to hard I just went a little too far.

I Know, I know, I know, too much ain't a damn good thing at all.
Overkill, too much of a damn good thing, ain't so much of a damn good thing.....

Too much of a damn good thing, overkill, ain't much of a damn good thing, overkill.
Too much of a damn good thing, is not all bad. overkill. whoaaa.
Too much of a damn good time, overkill ain't much of a damn good time. overkill.
Hey fellas cuz my whole life is not all bad.

We do it too much we gonna need to slow it down,
Do it to much we gon need to slow it down,
Do it too much we gon need to slow it down, do it too much...
