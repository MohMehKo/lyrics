You fucked up, don’t you know it, babe?
When you wake up, you’ll still see my face
I’m so happy you’re through with me
‘Cause when you break up you know someone’s gonna feel the pain

Could’ve given you everything that you wanted
Opened up and you slammed your love right in my face
Tried to give you my heart but you didn’t want it
Now you lay awake thinking of me

You made your bed
Go right ahead and lay in it
Visions of me be filling up your head
What you wanted, oh, my dear, what you thought you wanted
You made your bed so lay in it

Oh, you know you better
Probably think I want you back now
And every time he lay you down
Try to keep my name from coming out your mouth
‘Cause I’m the only one you think about

Could’ve given you everything that you wanted
Opened up and you slammed your love right in my face
Tried to give you my heart but you didn’t want it
Now you lay awake thinking of me

You made your bed
Go right ahead and lay in it
Visions of me be filling up your head
What you wanted, oh, my dear, what you thought you wanted
You made your bed so lay in it

Should’ve loved me better, darling, when you had your chance
Well, you let a good thing go and slipped right through your hands
Should’ve loved me better, darling, when you had your chance
You made your bed so lay in it

I know you think of me tonight
When you got no one by your side

Could’ve given you everything that you wanted
Opened up and you slammed your love right in my face
Tried to give you my heart but you didn’t want it
Now you lay awake thinking of me

You made your bed
Go right ahead and lay in it
Visions of me be filling up your head
What you wanted, oh, my dear, what you thought you wanted
You made your bed so lay in it

You made your bed
So just lay in it
