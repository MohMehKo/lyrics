Ye-ahhh.
Oh-oh, oeh, ahh, ha-ah-ah-ah-ah...

She was my queen,
Baby girl was down from the start (start, start, start).
She always believed,
That one day I would end up a star (a star, star, star).
She never saw it coming, we both didn't,
And that's why it hurts (hurts, hurts, hurts).
Ohhh, times changed, I changed
My fame became a curse (curse, curse, curse).

Hey, (hey)
Cause I was off one plane and onto another
Bags packed already, miles from each other.
But everything is nothing, nothing if I ain't got you.

I wanted it all,
The love and the money
And the fame and the big old crib.
I wanted it all,
But when I got where I was going,
I forgot about where I've been.
Oh, I forgot about, I forgot about,
I forgot about where I've been.
I wanted it all but everything is nothing,
Nothing if I ain't got you.

She was the one,
And I let her slip out of my hands.
(She was the one and I let her slip away)
Is it really done?
Did I lose the biggest part of my plan?
(Did I lose her?)
Now I know how it feels,
When the one you love is never around (never around).
You can't even steal a simple kiss, (kiss)
Cause I'm up in the clouds.

He-ay, ay.
Cause I was off one plane and onto another
Bags packed already, miles from each other.
But everything is nothing, nothing if I ain't got you-ohh,

Ye-eah-ay. Yeah.

I wanted it all,
The love and the money
And the fame and the big old crib.
I wanted it all,
But when I got where I was going,
I forgot about where I've been.
Oh, I forgot about, I forgot about
I forgot about where I've been.
I wanted it all but everything is nothing,
Nothing if I ain't got you.

Woah, Oeh-ohh.
Wanted it all.

I wanted it all,
The love and the money
And the fame and the big old crib. yeah
I wanted it all,
But when I got where I was going,
I forgot about where I've been.
Oh, I forgot about (I forgot about),
I forgot about (I forgot about),
I forgot about where I've been.
And I wanted it all but everything is nothing,
Nothing if I ain't got you.

And I forgot about,
I forgot about, I forgot about where I've been.
And I forgot about,
I forgot about that I'm nothing if I ain't got you.
