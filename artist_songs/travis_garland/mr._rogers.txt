Everywhere I go, they ask me where you been
What I’m supposed to tell em?
That we fell out. 
And you turned out to be a shitty fucking friend.
That wouldn’t go over so well... would it?
Nah
Just another night.
I'm drinking by myself
More shots by the minute
There were many
Taking these bullet wounds from everybody else.
I expected better from you
And it cut so much deeper from you

Maybe you should have tried to listen
Maybe you should have tried to love
Instead of assuming the worst intentions

Who the hell are you to judge me?
Who are you to judge me? [x3]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah [x2]

Just another night.
I'm smoking in the dark.
Playing back our conversation
Damn it’s crazy
Never thought you would be the girl without a heart
I would never do that to you
You weren’t there when I needed you
And you didn’t even try to listen
And you never even gave a fuck
Always assuming the worst intentions

Who the hell are you to judge me?
Who are you to judge me? [x3]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah [x2]
