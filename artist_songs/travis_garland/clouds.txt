Workin' really hard to get me
With them heels and that dress and that body yeah
Know I'm bout to drop to one knee baby
I'm a make you run and tell somebody

[Pre-Chorus:]
The way my name rolls off your lips
I think there's no better sound (no, no)
You're like a drug, I see them hips
You're moving, can't keep me down
No girl

[Chorus:]
You got my head in the clouds
And I just wanna fly (oh baby)
You got my head in the clouds
And I just wanna get high

Girl you know you take me there
Don't nobody else compare
Got me high I'm floatin' on air
Love the way you blow my mind
Take me up straight to the sky
Won't you now, stop wasting time

[Pre-Chorus:]
The way my name rolls off your lips
I think there's no better sound
You're like a drug, I see them hips
You're moving, can't keep me down
No girl

[Chorus:]
You got my head in the clouds
And I just wanna fly (oh baby)
You got my head in the clouds
And I just wanna get high

I wanna fly over the trees
Over the world, just you and me
I wanna fly, I wanna
I wanna fly (fly) over the trees trees
Over the world (world), just you and me

[Chorus: x2]
You got my head in the clouds
And I just wanna fly (woah baby)
You got my head in the clouds
And I just wanna get high

[Breakdown:]
Are you a killer?
In high heels lipstick
I got the camera baby
So lemme see ya pose, pose, pose
Baby girl, listen here
I'll tell you everything you wanna hear
If you want, I'll turn you out
Write your name up right here in the clouds
In the clouds
