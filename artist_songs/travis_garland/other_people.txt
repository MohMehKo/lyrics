[Verse 1:]
Now that we're through
Don't even know who I am without you
This bed is too big for one person
I'm learning how to not be around you
Now there's no you
I'm not allowed to care what you do
Even if you're drunk, gone crazy, call to say you hate me
That ain't true
Cause I just want the best for you
Even if that don't include me

[Chorus:]
So I won't go
Even if you don't want
Me to be here right now
Ain't leaving your heart with
These other people
I'm gone stay
Right here by your side
Don't wanna control your life
But I don't trust your heart with
These other people

[Verse 2:]
Now that you're gone
There's no reason for me here
Now you still complain
Now you went away
Don't know what I'm a do with all this
Closet space
My shirt you used to wear
And it still smells just like your hair
From when you loved me
It makes no sense
I'm empty when my head
Is filled with memories
Of you I just can't, I just can't forget
I just want the best for you, girl
And even if that don't include me

[Chorus:]
So I won't go
Even if you don't want
Me to be here right now
Ain't leaving your heart with
These other people
I'm gone stay
Right here by your side
Don't wanna control your life
But I don't trust your heart with
These other people

[Verse 3:]
You can call me a lot of things
But just don't call me careless
There's a lot of men that don't
Give a damn at all
Girl you mean too much to me
Just for me to let you be
It's a big world out there
I'm sorry yeh I'm sorry
I don't trust just anybody
With your heart

[Chorus:]
So I won't go
Even if you don't want
Me to be here right now
Ain't leaving your heart with
These other people
I'm gone stay
Right here by your side
Don't wanna control your life
But I don't trust your heart with
These other people
I'm gone stay
Control your life
These other people
