Lady Godiva, I ain't never met a girl like you, not like you
You take me higher, and when I fall you're my parachute, ya it’s you 
Cause I'm feeling like you're so sexy, you're so crazy
I ain't met no one like you lately
Time flies by it, and I don't notice when I'm with you 
And you ain't drama, you ain't tripping
Other girls talk, but you just listen
You're so special, don't know anybody like you

[Chorus]
Nobody's perfect, but you just might prove me wrong
Well I guess, you're not just anybody, anybody
Look past the surface, and you're still beautiful
Well I guess, you're not just anybody, anybody

??  you just might be one of a kind, you're so rare
I'd fly to meet ya, 
London, Paris, Rome, girl I will go, if you're there
Cause I'm feeling like you're so sexy, you're so crazy
I ain't met no one like you lately
Time flies by it, I don't notice when I'm with you 
And you ain't drama, you ain't tripping
Other girls talk, but you just listen
You're so special, don't know anybody like you

[Chorus]
Nobody's perfect, but you just might prove me wrong
Well I guess, you're not just anybody, anybody
Look past the surface, and you're still beautiful
Well I guess, you're not just anybody, anybody

[Bond Scene]
[Girl:] I just want you to know that if all that was left of you was your smile and your little finger, you'd still be more of a man than anyone I have ever met.
[Bond:] That's because you know what I can do with my little finger.
[Girl:] I have no idea. 
[Bond:] But you are aching to find out. 
[Girl:] You have me there, you can have me anywhere. 
[Bond:] Does this mean that your…warming to me? 
[Girl:] Yeah. That's how I would describe it. I'm afraid I'm a complicated woman.
[Bond:] That is something to be afraid of. Whatever is left of me, whatever I am, I'm yours.

[Chorus]
Nobody's perfect, but you just might prove me wrong
Well I guess, you're not just anybody, anybody
Look past the surface, and you're still beautiful
Well I guess, you're not just anybody, anybody
Nobody's perfect, but you just might prove me wrong
Well I guess, you're not just anybody, anybody
Look past the surface, and you're still beautiful
Well I guess you're not just anybody, anybody
Well I guess you're not just anybody, anybody
Well I guess you're not just anybody, anybody.
