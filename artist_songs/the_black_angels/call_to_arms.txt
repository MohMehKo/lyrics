He drives a 90,000 dollar jaguar to work everyday
He put his wife and kids in the zoo, cuz he had nothing left to do
Nothing left to do.
Oh, Boo- hoo-hoo, Boo-hoo-hoo
He bought a ticket for heaven, but it expired in june
The gun went off, but it was never on
The trigger to the finger, the finger to the trigger
One eye took the aim, just behind the man's brain
But who is to blame? I just think he's plain jane
Plain, plain jane

When i awoke, my head was up off the ground
Nature spinning, oh but shes makin no sound
Blessed she tells us all that she knows
Yeah let the people live
Let the riches flow
I found, well i found you at the fault
And it didn't mean, nothin at all

You keep your money in stocks at the county garbage dump
You spend your days on tar, at the local gas pump
You came in on your own and you'll leave all alone
You came in on your own,and you'll leave all alone

As a start we off'd go down the path
Of feilds of gold, a vision that soon will pass
A great mistake, the diamond on his face
Black as night, where the coral snake will strike
But i found, well i found, you at the fall
And it didn't mean, nothin at all

[Hidden Track:]

Yesterday I got a letter from my friend fighting in iraq
And this is what he had to say:
'Tell all my friends that I'll be coming home soon
My time will be up some time in November
Don't forget', he said, 'to tell my sweet Linsey

And he's fighting in iraq
Hes fighting in iraq
Hes fighting in the iraq war
What for

Well, It was just the next day his mother got a telegram
It was addressed from iraq
Now mistress Brown, she lives in the US of A
And this is what she wrote to say:
'Don't be alarmed, mistress Brown', the telegram read
'But your son is dead, oh, your son is dead'

And hes fighting in iraq
Hes fighting in iraq
In the iraq war
Hes fighting in iraq
In the iraq war
War
Someone stop that war
Somebody please stop that war
Somebody stop that war
Somebody stop that war now
Please stop that war
