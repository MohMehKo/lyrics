Do whatcha should honey
Be a good girl darlin'
Cuz you'll meet the executioner one day

Do whatcha should honey
Don't make mistakes darlin'
Cuz you'll meet the executioner one day

The executioner stands with his empty eyes
Waterin' mouth waiting to...
Kill

If it feels good
Do it again
A rope for your sins
Twist in the wind

If it feels good
If it feels good

The executioner stands with his empty eyes
Waterin' mouth waiting to...
Kill

The executioner feels no pain
He couldn't care less for you
Or to whom you pray

Do what you should honey
This is the end darlin'
For you met the executioner today

If it feels good
Do it again
Twist in the wind
Do it again

If it feels good
If it feels good
You do it again
