L, for all that love in your eye
O, for all those sighs in the night
V, it's very hard to deny
E, for everything you left behind
Me, every time you made me cry
See, I told you doll I would not lie
Yeah, love me forever
Love me forever
Love me forever
Love me forever

Why? Cuz your heart beats with mine
Can you hear them move?
They are in time
See, it's very hard to deny
Yeah, love me forever
Love me forever
Love me forever
Love me forever

Always for always
Always and all day
Love me forever
Love me forever
Love me forever
Love me forever

L, for all that love in your eyes
Me, for all those times
You've made me cry
Yeah, love me forever
Love me forever
Love me forever
Love me forever

Love me or never
Love me you'll never
Love me or never
Love me you'll never
Love
