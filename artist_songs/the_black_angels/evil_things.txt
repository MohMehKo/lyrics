I once met you in a killing field
Collecting dust, yeah, picking up blood
That was then when we were both people
Doing people things like collecting dreams, honey

Hey, little darling, you're a dreamer
All your options are so painless

That was then when we were both blind, yeah
Taking what was mine, killing all the time
We're the same with new intentions
We're the same with bad intentions

Hey, little darling, you're a dreamer
You sleep with your heart in your hand

Look what we've done, never been more blind
In a daze, singing prayers
We're the same
We are blameless

Making love on summer days, kid
Waking up feels good to me
Shaken up on holidays
Staying up feels good to me

That was then when we were both evil
Doing evil things like stifling screams
We are good now
We are blameless
We are home now
We are shameless

Love is your gun
Love is your gun
Love is your gun
Love is yours

Evil, evil, pure evil
This is evil
