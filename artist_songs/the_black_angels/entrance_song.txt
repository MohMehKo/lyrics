Rollin' fast down I-35,
Supersonic overdrive
Rollin' fast down I-35,
Thru the day and past the night

Rollin' fast down I-45,
I get ahead, goin' 109
Rollin' fast down I-45,
Bendin' time, feelin' fine

Entrance Song

Rollin' fast down 75,
Empty road, moonlit sky
Rollin' fast down 75,
Cuttin' thru like a knife

Rollin' fast down I-35,
Polarized into the light
Rollin' fast down I-35,
Insterstellar hyperdrive
