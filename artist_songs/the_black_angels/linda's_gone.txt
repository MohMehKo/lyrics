Now Linda had a dream a couple of years ago
About moving to the city streets
She was a server for a serpent
Her lips became a purpose
Mental halitosis for real

Now Linda's gone but she's moving on
Now Linda's gone but she's moving on

Well they had this change a little while ago
The city was a deadly dream
Her ego was a choker, her partners were all jokers
For years she turned into a fiend

Now Linda's gone but she's moving on
Now Linda's gone but she's moving on

Now Linda's gone but she's moving on
Now Linda's gone but she's moving on

Ole Linda's heart changed a couple of weeks ago
Transition was never her thing
She was a lonely little loafer who always was a smoker
Started breathing at age thirteen

Now Linda's gone but she's moving on
Now Linda's gone but she's moving on
Now Linda's gone but she's moving on
Now Linda's gone but she's moving on
Now Linda's gone but she's moving on
Now Linda's gone but she's moving on
Now Linda's gone but she's moving on
