I do like Melanie as much as I like you
She is sweet, like the kisses that I get from you
To me
A basket full of pretty things yeah
Between us

In my dreams everythings orange
In my dreams everythings orange

When she starts moving yeah
She's so natural
You better follow lead
In my dreams everythings orange

I do like melodies as much as I like you
They are tough, its like the kisses were never enough for me
To you
A pocket full of pretty evil things
Between us
In my dreams everythings foreign
In my dreams everythings foreign

When she starts moving yeah
She's so beautiful
You better follow lead
When she starts moving you better go with her

In my dreams I will follow her

I can't lie, I was only with her and then I found you
In my dreams everythings foreign
Between us
In my dreams everythings foreign
