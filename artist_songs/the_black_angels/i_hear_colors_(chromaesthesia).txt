I hear colors running thru my mind
I can feel them dripping in my eyes
I see colors ancient spectrum light
In thru me they enter
Make me shine, so bright

I see colors growing just like vines
Guiding me and keeping me in line
I can hear them everywhere
Screaming by and glowing bright

I don't need nobody's hell
Need nobody's help
I don't need nobody's hell
Need nobody's help

I feel colors rushing through my veins
Making me invincible to pain
I can hear them everywhere
Screaming by and glowing bright
So bright

I can feel them crawling down my spine
In thru me they enter, make me shine

Does my time fly? 
Does my time fly?

I don't need nobody's help
Need nobody's hell
I don't need nobody's help
Need nobody's hell

I don't need nobody's hell
Need nobody's help
I don't need nobody's hell
Need nobody's help
