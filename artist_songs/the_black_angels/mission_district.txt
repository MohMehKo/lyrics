You only love yourself
You only care for you
I think I hit the truth

Better days will come
Other scenes to get on
You watch your village cave in, kid

You only see one way
And I don't feel the same
You make it hurt honey

Easy figure of groove
Modern mistress of fire
For me to train, say my name

Who are you?
Who are you?
