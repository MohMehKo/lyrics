Every night I see you girl,
you promise me good things.
But every time I see your face,
you look the other way.

In due time, I'll find you girl.
I  know that you will say,
that every night you dream of me,
and how I make you scream.

Yeah you're mine, you're mine
all the time.
Yeah you're mine, you're mine
all the time.

The way you taste at night,
forever paints my mind.
My favorite wine,
I'll drink you all the time.

I die each night I see you girl,
and wish for you the same
But when you go, I promise you,
I'll never take the blame.

Yeah you're mine, you're mine
all the time.
Yeah you're mine, you're mine
all the time.

All the while this honest urge
is eating me alive.
All the smiles I've sacrificed,
you've got me hypnotized.

Me and you, I wonder,
what it's like with you.
Me and you, I wonder, 
I believe it's true.

Yeah you're mine, you're mine
all the time.
Yeah you're mine, you're mine
all the time.

All the boys and all the girls
wonder where you are.
Day and night  they look for you,
searching near and far.
Never will they find a trace
or have a single clue.
Inside me you're safe and sound,
I'll always  be with you.

Yeah you're mine, you're mine
all the time.
Yeah you're mine, you're mine
all the time.
Yeah you're mine, you're mine
all the time.
