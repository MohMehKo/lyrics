Now, Josephine, she was a loner
Her fortress of incredible lies
Her problems are now your problems
A hired gun until the day she dies

She said
 Don't play with guns
Don't play with guns
Don't play with guns
 Don't play with guns

Now, Angie, she was a demon
She had six arms and Lucifer eyes
She always had this glow
It always made me float

Don't play with guns
 Don't play with guns
She said
 Don't play with guns
Don't play with guns

Ladies promised love and all things golden
For my love, she said
Please be kind and load my gun
Please be brave and kill for fun

Don't play with guns
Don't play with guns
She said
Don't play with guns
Don't play with guns

It's hard, hard to give, you a gun
Hard to make you believe, that you are correct in
Taking another, life of another

Don't play with
Don't play with guns
Don't play with...

She lays down with her revolver
She's so cold, my heat evolves her

Don't play with guns
Don't play with guns
She said
Don't play with guns
Don't play with guns
