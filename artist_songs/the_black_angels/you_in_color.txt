Well I see, you see,
you in color
You're not my friend,
and you're not my brother
We agree to be enemies

The Queen called, and
she wants her land back
I suggest that you do just that
Black briefcase,
with a silver lining
Open it up, and
look inside see

Well I see, you see,
you in color
Now we're friends,
yes, we're blood brothers,
part Cherokee and 
quarter Shawnee
You saw what happened 
at Wounded Knee
