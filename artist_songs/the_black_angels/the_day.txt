The Sun was shining across the field
Burning bright with all his might
In the shadows lingering the Moon was looking so sadly
"Why should he shine so bright?
The day is is old, and it's the night"

No rain or storm could keep them from love, no
No rain or storm could keep them from love, hey

So the Moon, across the field
She told the Sun, "You'd better run, run, run
You'd better run
You'd better run
You'd better run
It's my turn Sun"

The day is thru
It's time to start anew
The day is thru

Then the night became as bright
Because the Moon gave her light
When the stars go join their friend
Then the day came to an end

It's all over
It's all over
It's all over
Another day, another night

The day is thru
It's time to start anew
And when the cycle ends another starts again

Someone's lookin' at the sunlight
Thinkin' that the moon beams are better than sunshine

Someone's lookin' at the daylight
Dreamin' that their nightmares are better in the daytime

Wish it would start
Wish it would start
Wish it would start
Wish it would start
