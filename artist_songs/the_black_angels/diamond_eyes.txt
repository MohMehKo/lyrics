She loved him
He's all she ever needed
When they're apart
She just can't stand him
Oh, it's better than
Letting things die
Oh, it's better than
Letting things die

He loved her
She's all he ever wanted
When they're apart
He just can't fake it
Oh, it's better than
Letting things die
Yeah, it's better than
Letting things die

I've seen them cut diamonds with their eyes
I've seen them cut diamonds with their minds
She misses him
He's all she ever needed
When they're apart
She just can't stand him

Why do we always hurt
People we love
Oh, it's better than
Letting things die
Yeah, it's better than
Letting things die
How does it feel
To fail?
How does it feel
To fail?
I know, I know
I've seen them cut diamonds with their eyes
I've seen them cut diamonds with their eyes
They both cut diamonds with their minds
