I will die for things that mean so much to me
If you take them, you better watch out
So when she came to me, I was so in love that
I'm half believing, half suspicious

Well you make me nervous
I will lie awake and thinking of you
It's like my spell is almost useless
I will lie awake and thinking of you

All these little things yeah, 
these pretty things that
Make us lose our minds, 
steal your thoughts in time
Yes you make me nervous, 
I will lie awake and thinking of you

Why are you so dangerous?
I will lie awake and thinking of you
It's like my spell on you is useless
I will lie awake and thinking of you

In the fight for things I am so in love with
I'm half believing, half suspicious
And in the moment I feel like you're lying
I'm half believing ohhhh

Why are you so dangerous?
I will lie awake and thinking of you
It's like the spell on you is useless
I will lie awake yeah thinking of you

Feeling for you is hopeless
I will lie awake yeah thinking of you
Feeling for you is useless
These feelings for you are hopeless

I will lie awake yeah thinking of you
I will lie awake yeah thinking of you
I will lie awake yeah I'm thinking of you
I will lie awake yeah I'm thinking of you
