I want to be able to close my eyes with you
I want to feel safe closing my eyes with you, with you

All in all we were tender at start
Painted with love
We knew where our homes were
Day one when the killing was done
I had the thought, 
"Could I do it or not?"

It's hard to kill when you don't know which side you're on
It's hard to kill when you don't know which side you're on

Day two, when the orders were barked
I knew in my heart that
The line has been crossed, yeah
Flame throwing, shot in my side
Blood wouldn't stop 
"Ready or not men?"

It's hard to kill when you don't know which side you're on
It's hard to kill when you don't know which side you're on

Will you be the same when this is over?
Oh, you'll never be the same when this is over

I want to be able to close my eyes with you
I want to feel safe closing my eyes with you, with you

When I got home 
It was a hell of a show
Dealing with love
Bullets in both legs
Maybe baby, when I feel safe
I'll tell you one day 
What happened to me

It's hard to kill when you don't know which side you're on
It's hard to kill when you don't know which side you're on

Will you be the same when this is over?
You'll never be the same when this is over

Will you be the same when this is over?
Oh, you'll never be the same when this is over
