Babe, before I met you,
Blackness everywhere.
Everywhere I look girl,
Blackness everywhere.

Now here you come
All dressed in white.
Climbing up this world,
Like a vine that will not die.
Placed on this planet,
Darkness at the door.
Now black isn't black anymore.

Girl, when I see you,
I think the world's OK.
I don't know how you do it,
But be it as it may.

Now here you come
All dressed in black.
Swallow up this world,
Like a vine that will not die.
Placed on this planet,
Darkness at the door.
Now black isn't black anymore.

Babe, before I met you,
Blackness everywhere.
Everywhere I look girl,
Blackness everywhere.

Placed on this planet,
Darkness at the door.

Placed on this planet,
Darkness at the door.

Placed on this planet,
Darkness at the door.

Placed on this planet,
Darkness at the door.
