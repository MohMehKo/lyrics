Gonna do things my way
Gonna see you tomorrow,
On a German war plane
We gonna bomb you 'til Tuesday
Important vision
Incredible smile
"I and out"
On a Viking warship
We want you on our island,
If we can ever find it
Important wisdom
Unfortunate lie, again
In and out
We're gonna run through the desert
We got big boots to fill
We're gone just to seek cheap thrills
Imported wisdom
Incredible cry
Unfortunate lie
