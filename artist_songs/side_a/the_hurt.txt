Oh you say you're mine
And I believe you every single time
Even though they say you're not my kind
I just can't believe you're lying
Oh my friends are laughing
Seen you out with other man i'm dying
Cant you see it in my eyes i'm cryin
I just cant believe you're not mine

Oo Would you hurt the man who loves you?
Would you hurt the man today?
Would you take the love you gave me away?
Oo Would you hurt the man who loves you?
Would you hurt the man today?
Would you take the love you gave me away?

Oh
What have I done
All the time I guess it was just fun
I gave away this Swedish girl I knew
Oh, just for you

Oo Would you hurt the man who loves you?
Would you hurt the man today?
Would you take the love you gave me away?
Oo Would you hurt the man who loves you?
Would you hurt the man today?
Would you take the love you gave me away?

No no no
Oh i know
I'll never never never know the truth
Oh I love you too much girl to spoil your fun
I can't run
No no no
I can't run

I guess I had it coming
I fooled around before when I was tired
And now my freedom stings me I couldn't hide
But I'd still be a fool all my life

Oo Would you hurt the man who loves you?
Would you hurt the man today?
Would you take the love you gave me away?
Oo Would you hurt the man who loves you?
Would you hurt the man today?
Would you take the love you gave me away?

Take the love you gave me
Hurt the man who loves you
Take the love you gave me
Hurt the man who loves you
Take the love you gave me
Hurt the man who loves you
Take the love you gave me

Hurt hurt
Hurt hurt
Hurt hurt
Hurt hurt..

Oo Would you hurt the man who loves you?
Would you hurt the man today?
Oo Would you hurt the man who loves you?
Would you hurt the man today?
