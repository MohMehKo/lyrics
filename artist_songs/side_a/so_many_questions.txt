Have you seen her?
Did you see her pass this way?
What is it about her?
Is it her eyes? Maybe
But I'm not so sure
Is it her laughter?
Something I've never heard before
So many questions but the answers are so few

All I really know is, I love you
So many questions but the answers are so few
All I really know is, I love you
What is it about her
That makes me stare
That makes me wanna run my fingers through her hair

Will I find her? Maybe
But I'm not so sure
Will she be mine?
I can't stand this searching any more
So many questions but the answers are so few
All I really know is, I love you
So many questions but the answers are so few
All I really know is, I love you
So many questions but the answers are so few

All I really know is, I love you
So many questions but the answers are so few
All I really know is, I love you
Since the only time I see her near
Is when I close my eyes
Should I keep it that way
The only way I can make her stay
