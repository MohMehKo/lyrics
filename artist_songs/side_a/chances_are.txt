They say you've been hurt so many times
You're afraid you'd lose again
I feel it's unfair, coz it's my heart you'd be breaking in the end
Play it fair coz I never did you wrong in any way
Just a little time is all I'm asking for

I know how it feels after the love has gone
Thinking you're the lonely one
It's never too late to start again
Doesn't have to end this way
Just take a chance coz I could give you more than he ever did give
If you only open up and let me in

Chances are, you're gonna change your mind
Chances are, you're gonna love me too
Chances are, you'll see

Take a chance coz I could give you more than he ever did give
If you only open up and let me in

Chances are, you're gonna change your mind
Chances are, you're gonna love me too
Chances are, you'll see

It's gonna take some time I know
For what you feel inside to grow
But if to love you has to wait a while, I'll do it
Coz chances are you'll be mine

Chances are, you're gonna change your mind
Chances are, you're gonna love me too
Chances are, you'll see

Chances are, you're gonna change your mind
Chances are, you're gonna love me too
Chances are, you'll see
