Once again
We're here as though we're not afraid of what might come
Is it unfair
We fall in love but then we both belong to someone else
I just don't know
How to let go
Why do we ever have to let it go
I don't know

Time will come for us to know
That we're not meant for each other
Time will tell us when our hearts must go
Time will show us the pain we know

Same old lies
As if we are not hiding secrets in our eyes
Some place in time
It was just a dream that we created in our mind
And our dreams
Do come true
Why do we ever have to dream of dreams
Don't come true

We knew it from the start
There will come a time for us to part
And we both knew then
Until we get passed in the end
