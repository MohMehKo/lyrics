Do you remember
Not so long ago?
Watching the stars shine
Under a moonlit glow
We were together walking
Hand in hand
We would exchange tender
Kisses while we danced
But now thing are different,
You'll be far from home

I'm spending my Christmas
Walking all alone
But I'll think about you
Every night and day
So wherever you are let me say

Merry Christmas...
I hope you're doing fine
Merry Chrismas...
Oh baby you're on my mind
Merry Chrismas...
Maybe I'll see you next year
Merry Chrismas...
To you my dear

I'll remember to wish
Upon a star
And I hope it brings me
To where you are
'Coz I dont' wanna spend
My Christmas, all alone
Whoa no, no

Merry Christmas...
I hope you're doing fine
Merry Chrismas...
Oh baby you're on my mind
Merry Chrismas...
Maybe I'll see you next year
Merry Chrismas...
To you my dear
