We often fool ourselves
And say that it's love
Only cause when it's gone
We end up being lonely
So how are we to know
That it just isn't so
That we just have to let each other go

There were manytimes
When weshared precious moments
But later realized
They were only stolen moments
So how are we to know
That it just wasn't so
That we just had to let each other go

If loving you is all that means to me
When being happy is all I hope you'd be
Then loving you must mean
I really have to set you free
Each day we meet my love for you

Keeps growing stronger
But everytime we meet
Makes leaving you so much harder
So how are we to know
That this just wasn't so

That we just have to let each other go
If loving you is all that means to me

When being happy is all I hope you'd be
Then loving you must mean
I really have to set you free
Letting go is not an easy task
When smiling feels like I must wear this lonely mask

It hurts deep inside
And I just cannot hide
That there's anguish at the thought
That we should have to part
If loving you is all that means to me
When being happy is all I hope you'd be
Then loving you must mean
I really have to set you free
If loving you is all that means to me
When being happy is all I hope you'd be
Then loving you must mean
I really have to set you free
