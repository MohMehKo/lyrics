You are the one that I had come
To love and cherish so well through those years
I hope one day we could return
Back to the day when it all just began

Alone every night though how sad it seems
I go back in time when I was yours and you're mine
I long for a chance where I just can go on
And hold you so close here in my arms again

So I just dream on to get me through each night
I close my eyes and then I'll take flight
For in my dreams, I'm never alone
Cause I have you there to call my own

All that I lived and breathed was you
Yes, I remember how love could have been
A wounded soul since you've been gone
All torn and shattered, my heart needs a home

Alone every night and so sad it seems
I go back in time when I was yours and you're mine
I long for a chance where I just can go on
And hold you so close here in my arms again

So I just dream on to get me through each night
I close my eyes and then I'll take flight
For in my dreams, I'm never alone
Cause I have you there to call my own

So I just dream on to get me through each night
I close my eyes and then I'll take flight
For in my dreams, I'm never alone
Cause I have you there to call my own

So I just dream on to get me through each night
I close my eyes and then I'll take flight
For in my dreams, I'm never alone
Cause I have you there to call my own

I'll just dream on
Woo hoh
Ooh, dream on
