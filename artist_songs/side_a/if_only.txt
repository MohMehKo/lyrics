If only you can hear me
Id let you know how I miss you so
Forgive me, I was blind to see
I was a fool to ever let you go
Believe in me I want you to know
That I have realised there's no one else id rather be
But then I know that you have found yourself somebody new
Hope I could find you in another place and time
Proven its true, I'm still love inlove with you

Everynight I've been dreaming
About the time when you were mine
The memories I will be keeping
Oh, I was wrong to let a chance go by
So listen now I never will deny
That I have realised there's no one else id rather be
But then I know you have found yourself somebody new
Hope I could find you in another place in time
Proven its true, I'm still inlove with you

If only you can hear me
Id let you know oh how I miss you so
Believe in me I want you to know
That I have realised there's no one else id rather be
But then I know that you have found yourself somebody knew
Hope I could find you in another place and time
Proven its true, I'm still inlove with you
