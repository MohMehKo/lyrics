You said it's over
But I still held on
You think I'm crazy
Well I think you're wrong
Coz I still believe in
What we've shared
I keep believing till
I'm all out of it
Just tell me slowly
Why you let me go
I wont get angry
I just need to know
Coz In my life there's
No one else but you
So before you leave me
Tell me what to do...

Where do I go from here
How do I make you stay
Where does my heart belong
Now that your faraway

How can you say I'll cope
Now that I've lost all hope
And how can you pretend
Your heart is fine
When deep inside you know
You've broken mine

I took for granted
That your love wont fade
It's now the worst of all mistakes I've made
I never thought
That love could end like this
But I hope you know
It's you that I will always miss

Where do I go from here
How do I make you stay
Where does my heart belong
Now that your faraway

How can you say that I'll cope
Now that I've lost all hope
And how can you pretend
Your heart is fine
When deep inside you know
You've broken mine

The hardest part of letting go
Is not goodbye
It's knowing that she's gone
But never knowing why

Where do I go from here
How do I make you stay
Where does my heart belong
Now that your faraway

Where do I go...
Where do I go from here
Where do I go How can you say that I'll cope
Now that I've lost all hope
And how can you pretend
Your heart is fine
When deep inside you know
You've broken mine
