Nobody asked for forever
Nobody wished for goodbye
After the hurting
What was left to do
Was I ever in your heart at all

Speak to me one last time
Take me in your arms
See how they've found us
At the end of the line
I've got to break away
Maybe we'll heal someday
For now there's no reason to stay

Babe as you walk away
Where do you go
Is there somebody else waiting
I tried to be everything
You wanted me to be
But now, what am I to you?

Speak to me one last time
Take me in your arms
See how they've found us
At the end of the line
I've got to break away
Maybe we'll heal someday
For now there's no reason to stay

How could I start it over
When there's nothing left inside
But a love that never dies...

Speak to me one last time
Take me in your arms
See how they've found us
At the end of the line
I've got to break away
Maybe we'll heal someday
For now there's no reason to stay
