We've been together
For quite sometime now
And you still shine in my eyes

I searched all my life
'Cause in my heart I knew
I'd find someone like you

And if I could live (Cause if I could live)
My life all over again
It would still be with you
No one else
Can offer you a heart so true
No one else
Can love you like I do

'Till the sun fails to shine
'Till the clock runs out of time
I will still be in love with you
'Till the moon and the stars
Fail to brighten up the night
I'll still be inlove with you

La, la, la ('till all the seas run dry)
La, la, la ('till flowers touch the sky)

I can see my tomorrow's
In the palm of your hand
There's only you and I

We'll hold forever
And know we will never
Lose the love that we have

And if I could live (Cause if I could live)
My life all over again
It would still be with you
No one else
Can offer you a heart so true
No one else
Can love you like I do

'Till the sun fails to shine
'Till the clock runs out of time
I will still be in love with you
'Till the moon and the stars
Fail to brighten up the night
I'll still be inlove with you

La, la, la ('till all the seas run dry)
La, la, la ('till flowers touch the sky)

.....I'll still be loving you

'Till the sun fails to shine
'Till the clock runs out of time
I will still be in love with you
'Till the moon and the stars
Fail to brighten up the night
I'll still be inlove with you
