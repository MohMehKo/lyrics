I've loved you for so long
And the promises you made
Keep me hanging on
And now I
I gotta know
Is this love enough
Or should we let it go?

Will I ever get to heaven with you?
Will I breathe the air that you do?
Will I ever touch the angels?
Will they fly?
Will I ever?
Will I ever get to heaven with you?

Another night starts to fall
And the wind carries me
When I wanna crawl
Coz when I (Coz when I)
I look inside
There's a fire in me that I
I can hide

Will I ever get to heaven with you?
Will I breathe the air that you do?

Will I ever touch the angels?
Will they fly?
Will I ever?
Will I ever get to heaven with you?

Wishin'
Hopin'
Achin'
Circling in my mind
Getting tired of waitin'
Hear me prayin'

Will I ever get to heaven with you?
Will I breathe the air that you do?
Will I ever touch the angels?
Will they fly?
Will I ever?
Will I ever get to heaven?
Will I ever get to heaven with you? (Will I ever?)
Will I breathe the air that you do? (Ever breathe the air)
Will I ever touch the angels?
Will they fly?
Will I ever?
Will I ever get to heaven with you?
Ooohhh
