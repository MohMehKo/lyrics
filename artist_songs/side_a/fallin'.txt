I wonder if you notice
I've ran by your side
I brought a stops to tremble
when I look into your eyes
we need to keep pretending
I know that your aware
you could right through me
and the signs are everywhere
I've been waiting for you
all this time
come into my life
Can't you see I'm fallin'
yes I'm fallin' for you now
so catch me cause I'm fallin'
won't you fall for me somehow
When I was badly broken
so many times before
I told myself that I don't wanna
take this anymore
I coudn't find a reason
a reason to survive
and when you came
and now it feels so good
to be alive
I've been waiting for you
all this time
come into my life
Can't you see I'm fallin'
yes I'm fallin' for you now
so catch me cause I'm fallin'
won't you fall for me somehow
I'm falling for you now
see I'm falling
for you

Can't you see I'm fallin'
yes I'm fallin' for you now
so catch me cause I'm fallin'
won't you fall for me somehow
Can't you see I'm fallin'
yes I'm fallin' for you know
so catch me cause I'm fallin'
won't you fall for me
