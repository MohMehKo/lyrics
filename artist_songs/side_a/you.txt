You give me hope,
The strength, the will to keep on;
No one else can make me feel this way
And only you
Can bring out all the best I can do;
I believe you turn the tide
And make me feel real good inside

You pushed me up
When I'm about to give up;
You're on my side when no one seems to listen
And if you go,
You know the tears can't help but show
You'll break this heart and tear it apart
Then suddenly the madness starts

It's your smile,
Your face, your lips that I miss,
Those sweet little eyes that stare at me
And make me say,
I'm with you through all the way

'Cause it's you
Who  fills the emptiness in me;
It changes ev'rything, you see
When I know I've got you with me

You pushed me up
When I'm about to give up
You're on my side when no one seems to listen 
And if you go, 
You know the tears can't help but show
You'll break this heart and tear it apart;
Then suddenly the madness starts

It's your smile,
Your face, your lips that I miss,
Those sweet little eyes that stare at me
And make me say,
I'm with you through all the way

'Cause it's you
Who fills the emptiness in me;
It changes ev'rything, you see
When I know I've got you with me
