Somebody's watching me
I know, but I can't see you
Somebody's reading what I have in mind
Someone is here beside me
I know, cause I can feel yo
Someone is here, it's you...
(It's you) Whenever I'm alone I think of you
(Just you) Whatever comes along I think of you
(Just you) Only you
There was once a time
When I had all this confusions
I looked for answers
That had led me to more questions
But now my life has finally changed because of you
And now I believe it's true...
(It's you) Whenever I'm alone I think of you
(Just you) When all my friends are gone I think of you
(Just you) Only you
I won't let you go
You'll always stay inside me
Love will always grow
There will never be another
I won't let you go
You'll always stay inside me
Love will always grow
There will never be another

Somebody's watching every little thing I do
Someone is here to guide me through
Someone is here to tell me what is right or wrong
Someone is here, it's you...
(It's you) Whenever I'm alone I think of you
(Just you) Whatever comes along I think of you
(Just you) Only you
ONLY YOU (Prelude)

I never thought that I would find peace of mind
You were here all along
I never thought that I would see
Someone like you who would love me most
For what I am, for what I do
My heart will always keep on loving you
(I won't let you go, I won't let you go)
Sometimes I feel that I'm alone, far from home
But you're always here in my heart
You never left me here all alone
You're someone I know who would love me most
For what I am,
