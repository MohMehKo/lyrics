There's feeling of unsertainty
Dont know what i headed for
Cause the road is wide
And the sun so high
Aboout the time i reach your door
Wheels are turnin
Time is runin
On and on
Looking back with all our memories
When we were much younger then
We were back in school
We broke all the rules
We really didnt care
Childish faces
Foolish faces
We were then
I'll be seeing you again
With the love that never end
And the reason to pretend
I'll remember way back when
They all try to break us then
But we swore
Would never bend
Now this feeling of unsertainty is faiding fast\
As i reach my destination
Now im sure this love will last
Well be together
In love forever
From now on
I'll be seeing you again
With the love that never end
And the reason to pretend
I'll remember way back when
They all try to break us then
But we swore
Would never bend
I'll be seeing you again
With the love that never end
And the reason to pretend
I'll remember way back when
They all try to break us then
Wohohohow wohohohow
I'll be seeing you again
With the love that never end
And the reason to pretend
I'll remember way back when
They all try to break us then
But we swore
Would never bend
I know well be together
I'll remember way back when
But we swore
Would never bend
