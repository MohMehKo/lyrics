Love comes, love goes
But a certain feeling never let me be
Somehow, I know quite a part of me isn't changed since you've been gone
Like a sturdy tree thats sees a thousand seasons
I still shed my leaves in winter
To grow them back in spring
To welcome life again
To welcome you
So goes, my life still beleive in dreams of having you around
Too bad, memories feed the mind and not the heart where I want you to be

So I ask myself what you've left behind for me
To go on each day and live as if
I have you once again
What else is there that's real
But all the pain that I feel
So let the pain remain
Forever in my heart
For every throb it brings is one more moment
Spent with you
I let the pain, bring on the rain

If that's the only way

If there's no other way
To be with you again
Too bad memories, feed the mind and not the heart
Where I want you to be
So I ask myself what you've left behind for me
To go on each day
And live as if I have you once again

What else is there that's real
But all the pain that I feel

So let the pain remain
Forever in my heart
For every throb it brings is one more moment
Spent with you
I let the pain, bring on the rain
If that's the only way

If there's no other way
To be with you again
So let the pain remain

Forever in my heart
For every throb it brings is one more moment
Spent with you
I let the pain, bring on the rain
If that's the only way
If there's no other way
If that's the only way
If there's no other way
To be with you again
