How could you come with me
When you knew all along that you had to go

How could you you watch me sleep
So close to you
Pretending not to know

How could you memorize my name
And forget who I am

How could you think
You're still the same
Believing I can

It's too late to stop pretending
It's too late for a new beginning
Later than the sunset
Later that the rain
Later than ever to love you again

How could you ask for more
With an innocent smile
Trusting me to stay

How could you close the door
And leave me here
Supposing I'm ok

How could you break down
My disguise
And uncover my fears

How could you look into my eyes
Ignoring my tears

It's too late to start pretending
It's too late for a new beginning
Later that the sunset
Later than the rain
Later than ever to love you again
[x2]

Its too late
