Along the steps that I walked through
All along the avenue
Wondering where to go without you near me

I know that there's changes everywhere
I know that tomorrow's always there
It may not be me for you but I don't care

Eva Marie
There will never be another
Eva Marie
You will stay in me forever
Eva Marie
You'll always be with me
Eva Marie
There will never be another
Eva Marie
You will stay in me forever
Eva Marie
You're all that's left of me

This time will soon be long ago
So I have to say the best that I know
But I can't think of what's more than I love you

Eva Marie
There will never be another
Eva Marie
You will stay in me forever
Eva Marie
You'll always be with me
Eva Marie
There will never be another
Eva Marie
You will stay in me forever
Eva Marie
You're all that's left of me

This time will soon be forgotten
But you will always be the one for me
I will set you free
But not in my dreams

Eva Marie
There will never be another
Eva Marie
You will stay in me forever
Eva Marie
Forever I will be
