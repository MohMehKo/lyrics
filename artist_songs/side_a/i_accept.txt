Remember the times when we said
Our love would never end
I do, I still love you
My love is true, only for you
And now, I never thought it would be
You're love would all disappear for me
Am to blame
All that I know, there's so much pain

I just have to accept your goodbyes
I just have to accept even though my heart cries
I accept, when you said to me
That our loves not meant to be
Guess from now on
All I can do is accept

You gave me those sweet memories
Times when it's still you and me
Each day, I'm holding you near
All of our dreams, all seems so clear
And now, all those dreams are all gone
Now that it's all said done
It's true, that our love is through
Now I'm alone
Guess I'm alone

You said I'll be forever
No more goodbyes, ever, never
Now that you're gone
I'll have to go on
