You gotta listen up, listen up
There's not a thing that I can't get from you
Boy I don't need that much need that much
How can I tell you what I wanna do?

I never needed you to give me things
I never needed gifts or diamond rings
All I ever need I, need I
All I ever need is here with you

Baby there's a this place were we can go
Where it's always shining like the snow
Listen to your heart beat don't you know
That I just wanna be with you?
Baby there's a place were we can go
Where it's always shining like the snow
Listen to your heart beat don't you know
That I just wanna be with you?

Oh, I can't get enough, get enough
Don't ever let me be away from you
I'm gonna hold you tight, hold you tight
Cause your the only thing I can't lose

I never needed you to give me things
I never needed gifts or diamond rings
All I ever need I, need I
All I ever need is here with you

Baby there's a place were we can go
Where it's always shining like the snow
Listen to your heart beat don't you know
That I just wanna be with you?
Baby there's a place were we can go
Where it's always shining like the snow
Listen to your heart beat don't you know
That I just wanna be with you?

You can't buy your way into my heart
But you don't see that I just want you
You get me things
But I don't care

Baby there's a place were we can go
Where it's always shining like the snow
Listen to your heart beat don't you know
That I just wanna be with you?
Baby there's a place were we can go
Where it's always shining like the snow
Listen to your heart beat don't you know
That I just wanna be with you?
