Oh baby I love
Your madness
It's all incredibly beautiful

You shine like gold
So selfless to all
And wild I get anymore

Some would say I'm insane
And they're right in a way
But I just like to play
Any fun and the games
Always hungry for more
That's just how I was born
Take me somewhere I don't know

You give me your freedom
You let me two pieces
Yeah I need it
For your pandemonium
Life is so easy
You let me two pieces
Yeah I need it
Why you pandemonium?

Oh baby our love
Is Endless
I know (I know)
Just do what you want with me

Yeah I want it all (I want it all)
Couldn't careless
The cost
I've given my everything

Some would say I'm insane
And they're right in a way
But I just like to play
Any fun and the games
Always hungry for more
That's just how I was born
Take me somewhere I don't know

You give me your freedom 
You let me two pieces
Yeah I need it
For your pandemonium
Life is so easy 
You let me two pieces
Yeah I need it
Why you pandemonium?
