You wanna be Rihanna
When you gonna realize she wants you to be you?
You wanna be Beyoncé
When you gonna realize she wants you to be you?
And that goes for they, too
Why dont you hold on to
Everything you have?
Cause you dont see, you dont see it
Im just here to introduce you
To yourself and all your love
When it comes to the void in your soul, fill it up
Yall spilling guts from the blunt more than love
What the fuck?
You wanna be Rihanna
When you gonna realize she wants you to be you?
You wanna be Beyoncé
When you gonna realize she wants you to be you?
And that goes for they, too
Yall girls are slaves to
The outside world, damn
Its beside this guy you lost
But look within, oh, girl
We never needed all that talk
You were gonna do it regardless
You were gonna do it regardless
Cause youre a boss
You wanna be Rihanna
When you gonna realize she wants you to be you?
You wanna be Beyoncé
When you gonna realize she wants you to be you?
And that goes for they, too
