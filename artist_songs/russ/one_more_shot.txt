We locked eyes from a distance, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I think I know what's missing, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Falling in my lap, don't know who to thank, I want her to deep dive
Tell her walk the plank, off the strength she gon' do it
Rich off music, maybe I should go home, maybe I should lose it
Gotta move up to celebrity girls
No bluffin', I would never bet on these girls
David Ruffin hit her with that raspy shit
She respond with that Janet Jackson nasty shit, yeah

All I need is one more shot, yeah
To take me away
I'm way too close to stop, yeah
I can't stop now
I just can't get enough, yeah
Come give it to me, give it to me
I just can't give you up, yeah
Come give it to me, give it to me

We locked eyes from a distance, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I think I know what's missing, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

She don't know why like Nori Jones
While she fallin' for me, off the aura alone
I got more in the phone, I could call 'em if your feet cold
Young, rich and handsome, that's a motherfuckin' cheat code, yeah

All I need is one more shot, yeah
To take me away
I'm way too close to stop, yeah
I can't stop now
I just can't get enough, yeah
Come give it to me, give it to me
I just can't give you up, yeah
Come give it to me, give it to me

I can relate if you're tryna get me to ease up, ease up
One more shot on me, girl, follow the leader, leader
We been touchin' on each other way too long, let's tee up, Free up
You know what I know, this night ain't gon' end here

All I need is one more shot, yeah
To take me away
I'm way too close to stop, yeah
I can't stop now
I just can't get enough, yeah
Come give it to me, give it to me
I just can't give you up, yeah
Come give it to me, give it to me
All I need is one more shot, yeah

Come give it to me, give it to me
I just can't give you up, yeah
Come give it to me, give it to me
All I need is one more shot, yeah
