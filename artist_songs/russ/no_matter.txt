No matter what you do
No matter where you stay
No matter how you dress
You should love yourself today

No matter what I do
No matter where I stay
No matter how I dress
Me and you we are the same

Stop what you're doing
Look around and take it
Talkin' to the devil
Keepin' God on hold
Run around and ask God why am I balling?
So believe and see you can flourish
Stop comparing to your own person
Mom talkin'
Dad talkin'
Brother talkin'
Sis talkin'
When you're gonna realize your own purpose?

No matter what you do
No matter where you stay
No matter how you dress
You should love yourself today

No matter what I do
No matter where I stay
No matter how I dress
Me and you we are the same

You're a student with a job and a baby
Daddy's on the block actin' crazy
Sellin' drugs is a trick on the whip
Cash it's so much bigger
Cause you got a kid on the street
I got more drinkin'
And a lot less lovin'
Got more thinkin'
Lot less fuckin'
Lookin' for a reason to believe in, leave it
The father of your child
But your son needs a man to look up to
So who's gonna teach him?
Just to take the stress away
It was all good like yesterday
But baby girl you should love yourself
Everybody, everybody, you should love yourself

No matter what you do
No matter where you stay
No matter how you dress
You should love yourself today

No matter what I do
No matter where I stay
No matter how I dress
Me and you we are the same

Sometimes we get lost
In the middle of nowhere
Sometimes we need to love nowhere
We find ourselves living
And nowhere to turn
Cause nothing is something
'Til something is everything

No matter what you do
No matter where you stay
No matter how you dress
You should love yourself today

No matter what I do
No matter where I stay
No matter how I dress
Me and you we are the same
