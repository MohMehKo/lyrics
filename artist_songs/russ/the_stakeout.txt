Yeah, yeah
Doors are openin' that were previously locked
Treat this game like any other bitch I just need me the top
Always knew that I'd become what I'm becoming
That one that's got the movers and shakers all in discussion
(Blat, blat, blat) Peep my percussion, it's no wonder why the bands about to come in
I see y'all fightin' but my fans about to jump in
I been calculating, living in this house of patience
Quarantined myself down here, but now I'm breaking out the basement
Ended up at Leo's house
Being great is a choice
Always working in silence let my success make the noise, I'm on my wave now
Welcome to my stakeout
The type of focus where I don't count the days, I make the days count
I can't take the same route
I got this mapped out differently
Where I can get myself I won't give you a cut to give to me, I'll give it to myself
Put my family on my payroll
Conductor of my train, nothing moves unless I say so
C'mon

I had a talk with my mom
She said, "What if you're the one you've been waitin' for?"
I treat my obstacles like stepping stones and keep climbing and climbing some more
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

Yeah, no matter what, I never lose my ambition
I soldier through the bullshit, turn my wounds into wisdom
There's some new women itchin' for some love and attention
But I'm still scratching the surface of my potential, won't let them fuck up my focus
I rarely ever like they advice
'Cause they gon' try and dim my light because I shine in they eyes
I'd rather be hated for what I am than loved for what I'm not
I wanna give my mom the world without worrying 'bout the cost
I'm gonna make it crack, saving rap, y'all should be ashamed of that
I'm not red or blue when I say that I cannot bang with that
Hooks, beats, verses, tell me who the fuck can hang with that
Rappers shootin' out the gate so fast but ain't maintaining that (yeah)
My goals are more and more tangible
This buzz that I'm building's becoming more and more flammable
'Bout to blow, oh no you should be up on this already
But in case you're not I'll let you catch up while I sip this Henny

I had a talk with my mom
She said, "What if you're the one you've been waitin' for?"
I treat my obstacles like stepping stones and keep climbing and climbing some more
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
