[Hook:]
You are my world, I'm goin' crazy
Cause you make me feel like my feelings ain't even for real
But you are my girl, that's why I'm crazy
That's why I feel like there's nobody in the world but you

Yeah, keep a couple hoes just to fill the void
Ya'll drop shipping?, don't make a sound, I'm out here makin' noise
List of accomplishments longer than your excuses
Everybody has a choice: live neutral or make a movement
Used to only see money with Washington's face on it
Now I'm doing the show out in Washington state on 'em
I used to love Keyanna 'til she show me all her colors
I wrote this hook before I wrote this verse
Fuck that motherfucker

[Hook:]
You are my world, I'm goin' crazy
Cause you make me feel like my feelings ain't even for real
But you are my girl, that's why I'm crazy
That's why I feel like there's nobody in the world but you

Yeah, wanderin' who or where and why and hows of you
I was bout to cop that place in New York house in you?
But I found the truth, you went and fucked that corny rapper
You ain't use no logic
I'm the one
You realized after

Lacking guidance parents dipped on you, damn they left a mark
You've been bullshtting for so long, your life ain't really start
I used to love Keyanna 'til she show me all her colors
I wrote this hook before I wrote this verse
Fuck that motherfucker

[Hook:]
You are my world, I'm goin' crazy
Cause you make me feel like my feelings ain't even for real
But you are my girl, that's why I'm crazy
That's why I feel like there's nobody in the world but you

Yeah, yo mom hit me up, I'm glad to see you talk to her
But she's cuffed to false sense of a reality of her daughter
I'm sorry missus officer, there's a lot of words that I could say
Fuck it if you wanna go there
Then I go down and press this send
For my chest, to my brain, to my words, to your soul
So this gonna fuck you up
Your daughter doesn't fit your mode
I used to love your daughter 'til she show me all her colors
I wrote this hook before I wrote this verse
Fuck that motherfucker

[Hook:]
You are my world, I'm goin' crazy
