Baby girl, you're dead, death by your disguise
Society got you fucked up, livin' in a lie
Please remove that bag, take off all that make-up
Come up here, kick it with the realest, I can take ya
To the other side, it's really do or die
Yea
All I can promise is you're not alone
All my angels fly (all around me)
All my angels fly (all around me)

I think the world needs help and I think aa
I think dudes... America is catered to you
The world is catered to you
So, 'scuse me while I talk to these females again

Baby girl, you're dead, death by your disguise
Society got you fucked up, livin' in a lie
Please remove that bag, take off all that make-up
Come up here, kick it with the realest, I can take ya
To the other side, it's really do or die
Yea
All I can promise is you're not alone
All my angels fly (all around me)
All my angels fly (all around me)
