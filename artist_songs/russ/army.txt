Who's this dude who's rappin' crazy?
Makin beats and singin' too
Labels sendin invites to the man
Betta bring the loot
Mama told me act polite
Act like that you've seen some money
My dad taught me watch them eyes
Bitches out here actin' funny
You live like you grabbed the money
I live like I have the money
I'mma put my family on, get my shit and pass the money
Buy my mom an island
It's Tuesday, were in Bora Bora
Drop some shit out for the fans
Continue on my dora-dora
Pass the gin', I poura-poura
Lables need some more-a more-a
Cause a couple ends ain't gonna make me move up out my corner
Fuckin' up yo country, USA girls treat me like I'm foreign
Givin' out this free food
Hope that you enjoyed your portion
My shits for the masses
You rappin' for yo neighborhood
Got some money in my mattress that could fuck up yo whole neighborhood
Deep breaths for the shallow mind
I said deep breaths for the shallow mind
Ignite a fire, we could all shine

I got two middle fingers up if you don't care for me
I got to be there for my fans cause they was there for me
Left, Right, Left, come and march for me
Got a fuckin' army round the world on call for me
I got two middle fingers up if you don't care for me
I got to be there for my fans cause they was there for me
Left, Right, Left, come and march for me
Got a fuckin' army round the world on call for me

Guns up to the cashier cause its cash here
Ya, I was polishin' my shit, that was last year
Ya, now I'm smoother than a criminal....
And I'm movin' like a general...
Fuck that shit that all of y'all is talkin' bout
I'm makin' myself hot, ain't shit yall can tell me
This is like 50 mixed with EM mixed with Machiavelli
Got the tele in New York, labels tuggin' on my arms
Sicily in my blood, I'm a boss
They recognize the don
Gettin' on while you foulin' up
But its never really been about you
Cause motherfuckas been makin' moves, with or without you
(And I'm smoother than a criminal but I'm movin' like a general)

I got two middle fingers up if you don't care for me
I got to be there for my fans cause they was there for me
Left, Right, Left, come and march for me
Got a fuckin' army round the world on call for me
I got two middle fingers up if you don't care for me
I got to be there for my fans cause they was there for me
Left, Right, Left, come and march for me
Got a fuckin' army round the world on call for me
