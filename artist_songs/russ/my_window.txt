[Hook:]
Come to my window
I can't close my blinds its real
Come to my window
I can't wipe you off its real

I been sensing things about to change now
In and outta countries and states now
Bout to fly my fam out to LA now
Gettin booked for shows I'm gettin paid now
Fell in love with swerving fuck a lane now
Fuck a mask and cape just use my name
Swear to god I'm poppin any day now
Recognize tomorrow knew myself and hit the lotto

[Hook:]
Come to my window
I can't close my blinds its real
Come to my window
I can't wipe you off its real

I been mixing things I probably shouldn't
I been coaching myself I'm john wooden
I been flippin chairs over like bob knight
I been puttin pressure on like prom night

I can't see shit but i believe in my vision
Women dollars and traveling lately thats how I'm livin
CEO of myself
Lately that's how I'm winning
I'm from the cloth of a boss
I gotta hustlers ambition damn
Expanding my network
From the internet i call that making the net work
Real people fucking with you is real wealth
That's human capital
That's how you grow your networth
Imma make your neck hurt
Come on

[Hook:]
Come to my window
I can't close my blinds its real
Come to my window
I can't wipe you off its real
