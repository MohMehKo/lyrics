[Verse 1 - Russ:]
I put myself on so that's who I get the paper with
I been on my owner, coach, fan and player shit
Draped in my own clothes
Fam' needs money, so I try to split up bands
Like I'm tryna' go solo
Gotta' keep a low profile when I'm home
It's cool to make the hoes go wild but I know
That's how you get jammed up
So please, put your right hand up
And swear to me that even when your blitz
You'll keep the cam tucked
On your Carolina shit
She poppin' pussy like it's Vicodin
And I just wanna' try the shit
This is that build a fan base without a shortcut
Turn my Nissan into a tour bus
This is by me, for us
Put my family on my back
Rock that shit like it's jersey
Doin' circles 'round the game
Until I'm dizzy and I'm blurry
High school classmates
Thought this path was a tragedy
In one night
I make their two month salary

[Hook x2 - Russ:]
Okay, this money that I'm making
Yeah it's new to me
All these women getting naked
Yeah that's new to me
I'm the topic of conversation
That's new to me
People ain't believe, I always did
That's nothing new to me

[Verse 2 - Russ:]
Listenin' to Wayne to cure my writers block
I been taking flights a lot
Top notch accountant
He gon' make sure that we write it off
All I ever wanted was a platform
Get Gianna and my mom
Anything that they ask for
Sayin' I should rap more
Sayin' I should sing less
Sayin' I should sing more
Sayin' I should spit less
I couldn't give a fuck 'bout what you think
You were nowhere to be seen
When I was doing what I knew
Would put my family on they feet
I ain't walkin' through the game
Bitch I'm levitatin'
Bitch I drop bombs
Ain't no tellin' when I'm detonatin'
Comin' from a meetin' with people
That control your favorite artist
Money making up their mind
Their bank account is where their heart is
So we don't get along
Cause my heart is where my art is
Even if you blackball me
It's still fuck you regardless
Groupies multiplyin'
Leeches multiplyin'
Labels tryna' figure out
The secret I've been hidin'

[Hook x2 - Russ:]
Okay, this money that I'm making
Yeah it's new to me
All these women getting naked
Yeah that's new to me
I'm the topic of conversation
That's new to me
People ain't believe, I always did
That's nothing new to me
