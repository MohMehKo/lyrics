Everybody knows
That nobody really knows
Yeah everybody knows
That nobody really knows

[?] through your line of fire
Got hit by your bullets
Looking at your trigger finger
Hoping you don't pull it
But you dead
So it is, what it is
I guess I'm wounded
Fuck that shit
Cause you lost out, I'm winning
Fuck you doing?
I got hits that deserve to be heard
Where the Knicks play
Like Patrick Ewing
And yeah I'm on probation
But I found the truth in this gin and juice
And I believe in the movement
I had to cut you off
We're getting too heavy
And I'm already holding the world
Number one, and I'm feeling too ready

Everybody knows
That nobody really knows
Yeah everybody knows

Idols popping off my walls
It's feeling like it's 3-d
And I'm at home with my mom
Watching myself on the T.V
'Cause I'm with my dad when through
I gotta do right
So many sirens have turned into silence
I just offer you lies
Something you should know

Everybody knows
That nobody really knows
Yeah everybody knows

Everybody knows
That nobody really knows
Yeah everybody knows
