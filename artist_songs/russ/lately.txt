Okay lately, I been watchin' people get lost
And lately people really don't know what they want
That's cause lately people out here lyin' to themselves
So lately society got yo soul on the shelf (some people need help)

Turn my back on society, seventeen
Cause they told me that I couldn't have a dream
But I got it dropped out of college, MTV
Now I'm all over the world on yo screen
Now I'm front cover like girls on magazines
Now I'm chopped now, shoutout OG Ron C
Now I'm on the radio in Seattle
Now I'm out in Belgium, I don't even travel

Okay lately, I been watchin' people get lost
And lately people really don't know what they want
That's cause lately people out here lyin' to themselves
So lately society got yo soul on the shelf (some people need help)

[Bugus:]
I'm watchin' people give up
Contemplating suicide
Tryna tell my people we much smarter when we unify
Tryna move these units, out here livin' like it's do or die
We be on MTV, often dreams is self belief
Got my confidence, my self esteem is shootin' thru the roof
I'mma stay inside my house, lock myself inside my booth
Got my gin, i got my juice
Got my family to balance me
I don't need no rules
I'mma boss, watch the world spin off

Okay lately, I been watchin' people get lost
And lately people really don't know what they want
That's cause lately people out here lyin' to themselves
So lately society got yo soul on the shelf (some people need help)

Okay lately, I been on the block sellin' crazy
This 9 to 5 drop ain't goin' save me
I gotta keep a Glock for my safety
I almost fucked around and had a baby

O.k., lately, I been watchin' people get lost
And lately people really don't know what they want
That's cause lately people out here lyin' to themselves
So lately society got yo soul on the shelf (some people need help)
