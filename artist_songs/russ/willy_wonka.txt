Fresh like a breeze in the sauna
I can get whatever when I wanna
Tryna get around and be on the
Candy that's around Willy Wonka
I like to go where my body got candy

I don't wanna talk right now
Everytime we do you're hot and cold
You know what it is when the boss in town
It don't really matter cause I got more hoes
But I'm tryna focus on the task at hand
But these spanish chicks gotta hex on me
I'm just looking at em' like damn I'm the man
Make me wanna mmm, mmm, mmm unleash

Fresh like a breeze in the sauna
I can get whatever when I wanna
Tryna get around and be on the
Candy that's around Willy Wonka
I like to go where my body got candy

I'd love to get to know you, love to choose the same two things all the time
But little girl is broken hearted by the pictures 
If you wanna get with me you've gotta move to the way that my hips thrust
I don't fall for the most ones
If it's pain then I love you in the vain but,
I won't know how to guide me so help me (drownin in envy)

Fresh like a breeze in the sauna
I can get whatever when I wanna
Tryna get around and be on the
Candy that's around Willy Wonka
I like to go where my body got candy

I'm a cavity to your cavalry of love
Got you spell bound
So sweet, for one of hell's hounds
So sugar coat me in your energy
Sugar coat me in your energy

Fresh like a breeze in the sauna
I can get whatever when I wanna
Tryna get around and be on the
Candy that's around Willy Wonka
I like to go where my body got candy
