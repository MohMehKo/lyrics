[Hook:]
I've been dreamin bout what you been dreamin bout
You know that I been, I been
Dreamin bout what you been dreamin bout
You know that I been, I been

We like to dance and stir the pot
I bring the juice she brings the sauce
Were always 10 on 10 on 10 on 10
You make me never wanna sleep again
When a real one walks thru the door
Better know how to act before the door starts closing
And i go ghost in a ghost
And i hate feelin like I gotta start boasting
But baby you been actin kinda strange
Ever since i walked in you gotta problem with the truth?
I know you got the sauce
But I got the juice
Baby what it do

[Hook:]
I've been dreamin bout what you been dreamin bout
You know that I been, I been
Dreamin bout what you been dreamin bout
You know that I been, I been

I know that you don't wanna turn up by yourself
You got my number
I know that you don't wanna turn up by yourself
Call me
Introduce you to yourself
When we talk swear to god its like you lookin in the mirror
And I know you know
I'm the mufukkin one
But baby you been actin kinda strange ever since I walked in
You gotta problem with the truth?
I know you got the sauce
But I got the juice
Baby what it do

[Hook:]
I've been dreamin bout what you been dreamin bout
You know that I been, I been
Dreamin bout what you been dreamin bout
You know that I been, I been
