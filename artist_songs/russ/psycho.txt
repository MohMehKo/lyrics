[Bobby Caldwell:]
I guess you wonder where I've been
I searched to find the love within
I came back to let you know
Got a thing for you and I can't let go
My friends wonder what is wrong with me
But I'm in a daze from your love, you see
I came back to let you know

[Russ:]
This bitch got me feeling psycho
Living on a tight rope
Got me going down, down, down
Deeper down the rabbit hole
Guess I never had to go
Oh, so my love ain't enough

Yeah, you should've kept the love that I gave you
You passed on a top notch ride for a motha' fukkin' Prelude
I came through, tryna' save you but I can't do what God can't
So I bargained with the Devil
Tryna' argue my point
We in room 420
And you rolling up joints
Still at the dirty hotel
You still call it to trap
And you climbed on top
I still got you back to back
In the back of my Nissan
Fuck that dude who ran up tryna' be on you
Got you in my car with my beats on move
To the back seat, let me change your mood
Too many questions, what, where, when, who

This bitch got me feeling psycho
Living on a tight rope
Got me going down, down, down
Deeper down the rabbit hole
Guess I never had to go
Oh, so my love ain't enough

This bitch got me feeling psycho
Living on a tight rope
Got me going down, down, down
Deeper down the rabbit hole
Guess I never had to go
Oh, so my love ain't enough

Yeah, everybody that was close to me
They could feel the distance
I fell in love with a girl
Cause she filled what was missing
And I tried to fill you up
I tried to fill you up
Tried to fill you up
You're so empty
But your potential tempt me
To dive in to your ocean, let me swim
Just don't let me drown (drown)
Just don't let me drown, drown, drown

This bitch got me feeling psycho
Living on a tight rope
Got me going down, down, down
Deeper down the rabbit hole
Guess I never had to go
Oh, so my love ain't enough

This bitch got me feeling psycho
Living on a tight rope
Got me going down, down, down
Deeper down the rabbit hole
Guess I never had to go
Oh, so my love ain't enough

This bitch got me feeling psycho, psycho, psycho, psycho, psycho, psycho, psycho, psycho, psycho, psycho, psycho, psycho, psycho, psycho, psycho, psycho, psycho, psycho, psycho, psycho
