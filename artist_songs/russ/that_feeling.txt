[Russ:]
I brought you to my world
I thought you were the girl
But you threw it all away
Drinking all this liquor
Just to wash the pain away
For me

It's not for you anymore
No, it's not for you anymore
It's not for you anymore

[Emmanuel Davis:]
That feeling, that doesn't go away
That feeling, that doesn't go away
That feeling, that doesn't go away

[Russ:]
You know I love you
But what am I supposed to do?
You fucked me over
I don't trust you
This is true

It's not for you anymore
It's not for you anymore

I believed in you

It's not for you anymore
It's not for you anymore

[Emmanuel Davis:]
That feeling, that doesn''t go away
That feeling, that doesn''t go away
That feeling, that doesn''t go away
That feeling, that doesn''t go away

[Russ:]
I was ready for you
You aren't ready for me, no, no
I was ready for you
And you aren't ready for me no, no

[Emmanuel Davis:]
That feeling, that doesn''t go away
That feeling, that doesn''t go away

[Russ:]
I operate all flows, not fear
But it isn't what there was
You know, you know, you know, you know

[Emmanuel Davis:]
That feeling, that doesn''t go away
That feeling, that doesn''t go away
