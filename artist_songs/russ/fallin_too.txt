If you fall, I'm fallin too

I don't wanna fight, yeah yeah

I'm getting money now
Everything changed quick
Part of me misses life in the basement
Back when everything was cool in the household
When I was gassed of a couple hundred downloads
Now I would never go back, the good outweighs the bad
But my mom thinks I don't love her, she blames it on my dad
Tension getting thicker than the girls I got in south beach
Arguements crazier than girls I got in saudi
Got a bounty, on my head that's what it feels like
It's crazy when dreams become real life
Hoping that my mom can give three rags
Cause dad's been silent like 3 stacks
And money's got my family doing backflips
I was broke, I ain't been back since
Everybody knows it, I got the fame up on my shoulders
I promise I'll blow up but won't blow it

If you fall, I'm fallin too
If you call, I'm callin too
What you want, I wanna do
Just tell me, and we can decide
I don't wanna fight, yeah yeah
If you fall, I'm fallin too
If you call, I'm callin too
What you want, I wanna do
Just tell me, and we can decide
I don't wanna fight, yeah yeah

Couple million liquid cash I can pull out right now
Four chicks every night I should pull out right now
I can't have a mistake, my dad acts like he had two
I love him that's my dad, I understand that he had to
Family mad as fuck, a TV man I've known that
50k last week man I've blown that
Mom's car got took, man I feel stressed
Cause I got the couple cars parked on my neck, yes
Twenty wedding rings chilling on my necklace
Feeling kind of guilty, please don't judge me off my entrance
Cause this is new money let me get handle on that
About to start moving militant, put the camo on it
Told dad, "Got to figure out the balance between helping ya'll out, and knowing ya'll can help me out it"
Damn, ya it could be better but it could be way worst
Hope ya'll stay together...

If you fall, I'm fallin too
If you call, I'm callin too
What you want, I wanna do
Just tell me, and we can decide
I don't wanna fight, yeah yeah
If you fall, I'm fallin too
If you call, I'm callin too
What you want, I wanna do
Just tell me, and we can decide
I don't wanna fight, yeah yeah

Tell my mamma I'll be back
In a little, I'm a save her
No matter what went down
I don't care, I don't blame her
Yeah, yeah
Tell my mamma I'll be back
In a little, I'm a save her
No matter what went down
I don't care, I don't blame her
Yeah, yeah
