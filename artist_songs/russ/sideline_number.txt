That's why I'm giving you my sideline, sideline number
That's why I'm giving you my sideline, sideline number

Ever since I came up, I'm a come up
See me fucking you could be a fuck up
One slip up could have my whole career ended
Gotta think about what I send before I send it
So I keep it short, nothing outlandish
Girl I'm talkin to is half Arab half Spanish
I don't give a fuck though, bitches all cut throat
Plus I'm the one so

I ask for you number then I text you from my sideline
No evidence no tracin' back to me so I'm fine
I don't know you enough to trust you that's the truth I
I know you're hot, but I can't get got

That's why I'm giving you my sideline, sideline number
That's why I'm giving you my sideline, sideline number

I'm a target, I can't start it, you gotta initiate
Keep it quiet I'll deny it if you try and get me framed
Only women that I fuck with are low key
Only ones that know my home are my homies
Anti-screenshot man I'm too hot

I ask for you number then I text you from my sideline
No evidence no tracin' back to me so I'm fine
I don't know you enough to trust you that's the truth I
I know youre hot, but I can't get got

That's why I'm giving you my sideline, sideline number
That's why I'm giving you my sideline, sideline number
That's why I'm giving you my sideline, sideline number
That's why I'm giving you my sideline, sideline number

No such thing as a private message
Cause they'll air it out like byron leftwich
Gotta keep it real real real g rated
They got more crazy when you get more famous
Damn you trippin', girl you a bad look
I'm takin' more shots than your ass took
Fake, stupid, where were you raised at?
How can I save that?

I ask for you number then I text you from my sideline
No evidence no tracin' back to me so I'm fine
I don't know you enough to trust you that's the truth I
I know you're hot, but I can't get got
