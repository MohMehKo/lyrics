[Hook x2:]
She be lookin like she straight from saudi
Probably because she straight from saudi
You ain't nothin but a plane ride yea
I could be there by tomorrow ain't no thang

7000 miles
ATL to Riyadh
I be tryna upgrade
Rarris from a Nissan
I be flyin' so much
All I know is treetops
She wants me to rock her boat like Aaliyah
I know its kinda crazy over there
But ya boy still tryna silde through
Saudi girls be poppin them thangs
And the dudes be poppin off
So gotta watch myself
Cuz im tryna come back in one piece
It ain't my fault that im from another country
And she loves me

Talking to your girl I'm sorry she ain't mention you
All this sauce of course she's slippin man I'm tellin you
I'm a real one I do what they all pretend to do
Looking in the mirror like they all depend on you
Go and get this money do it how you know you should
All my Saudi people know wassup they know what's good
International I'm in and outta hemispheres
We can ride take this shit imma let you steer
