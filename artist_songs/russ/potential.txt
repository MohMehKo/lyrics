Baby I can see you got potential
Baby I believe in your potential
But I've been done so wrong
I just hope I'm not wrong

You may not be there yet

I know what you could be
I know what you should be
I just hope you wake up
Embrace what God gave ya
Focus on yourself girl

Yeah, I know that you want what I want too
