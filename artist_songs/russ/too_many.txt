All I really got in this is me (damn that's it)
Everybody else just wants a piece (what you want)
Rappers disappearing off they singles (where'd you go)
Cuz they ain't sayin shit, them are jingles (la la la)
Only one I trust in this is Boog
I been peepin game like who are you?
I can see thru you I got x ray
I don't give a fuck what my ex say

[Hook x2:]
1 time 2 times too many
I said 3 times 4 times too many
I said 5 times 6 times too many
You done fucked up 1 time too many yea

Global shit
Ceo thats my destiny
Lotta hoes
Lil liquor that's the recipe
Lotta money
On the way I'm the crystal ball
Lotta shots
In my holster you can get em all
Girls from Saudi
They be gettin rowdy
Imma try and marry all of them if they allow me
That's the liquor talkin
I just needa couple
I'm just tryna find some shit to take my mind off bein Russell
I ain't tryna put nobody on
Yall ain't workin hard as me that's facts
My face card around my fam that's strong
I don't really give a fuck about your daps

[Hook x2:]
1 time 2 times too many
I said 3 times 4 times too many
I said 5 times 6 times too many
You done fucked up 1 time too many yea

When the boss talks you should close your mouth
