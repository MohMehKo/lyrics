I can see the green light comin'
I can see the red light comin'
I can see the yellow light comin'
It's yellow, yellow, hello, hello

Meditate to clear my mind
Think about my life and shit
I remember being 9 before I had the mic and shit
Standin' on the mantelpiece, watch it turn into a stage
Told my mom I got her, buy a place where we can stay
Right up on the beach, where the nicest with the beats
Turn my bedroom to a bank, I'm cashin' out on self-belief n shit
Actualizin' dreams and shit, made it to the otha side
See me on yo T.V. screen, I made it to the otha side
Movin' like a you-know-what, bosses recognizin' me
Cause I'm movin' certain way, its really not surprising me
Its really not surprising me
It's D-I-E-M-O-N, that's the dynasty

I can see the green light comin'
I can see the red light comin'
I can see the yellow light comin'
It's yellow, yellow, hello, hello

Say that you're the hottest out
Soundin' like a myth to me
Cause I got your latest album
That just sound like shit to me
Diemon makin' history, check you're local TV Channel
Or the radio, DJ Haven got me in Seattle
See the truth inside of you, found it right inside of me
When you hit that yellow light
Hit the gas like it's the green
Get the cash and buy a dream
For my family, fuck receipts
Do it for the nine year old inside of me who's tryin' me
Promise I'mma make you proud, promise you inspire me
Promise if I let ya down, I promise I'mma fire me
And I got my trump slippers on
With the blunt and some liquor, waaaaaaaa

I can see the green light comin'
I can see the red light comin'
I can see the yellow light comin'
It's yellow, yellow, hello hello
