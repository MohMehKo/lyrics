[Hook:]
You're gettin' too old
How'd it get so late so soon
You're gettin' too old
How'd it get so late so soon

So scared of getting older
I'm only good at being 22
Tryna find a way to slow this down
But these wheels just keep on turnin'

I'm playing in a game I can't win
But I still play like I can't lose

[Hook:]
You're gettin' too old
How'd it get so late so soon
You're gettin' too old
How'd it get so late so soon

Stop growin' up so fast
I remember when I held you
You're still a baby to me
You'll always be that way to me

I'm playing in a game I can't win
But I still play like I can't lose

[Hook:]
You're gettin' too old
How'd it get so late so soon
You're gettin' too old
How'd it get so late so soon

You've always been there for me
I've never lived a day without you
I still got so much to learn
You can't leave me

I'm playing in a game I can't win
But I still play like I can't lose

[Hook x2:]
You're gettin' too old
How'd it get so late so soon
You're gettin' too old
How'd it get so late so soon
