Inbetween high inbetween drunk
Inbetween love and I dont give a fuck

Showed you what it is you disagreed
Back the fuck up
Take a shot, hit some weed
I know you cried about being alone
Thats why I tried to take your lost ass home
But you were busy pointing fingers
At everybody but you
It started as love then we gotta little drunk
And it turned into fuck you
Now Im bout to ride
Swervin back and forth
Inbetween acceptance and this ain't what I asked for

Inbetween high inbetween drunk
Inbetween love and I dont give a fuck
Inbetween high inbetween drunk
Inbetween love and I dont give a fuck

I had a vision and I still have it
You had a difference in belief and bad habits
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na
Thought that I explained shit
Thought that you would make it
Past the point of inbetween where I ain't broke but I ain't paid yet
Speak the language

Inbetween high inbetween drunk
Inbetween love and I dont give a fuck
Inbetween high inbetween drunk
Inbetween love and I dont give a fuck
