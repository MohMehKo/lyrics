Come take a vacation
Even if it's just from yourself

[Russ x3:]
I got my middle fingers up screaming what's up now?
Real motherfuckers all around me right now

[Chorus x3:]
I'm out here screamin' what what
Not giving a fuck fuck
Cause I'm here to stay when you hear my name
You give it up up

[John Anthony:]
Watchin' Lil Jojo as he in that burrow
Chop it big he hold it like a bow and arrow
Chopper God he hold that shit like he pharaoh
They tell me Johnny, flip another sparrow
Chopper as I am in proper
In that Chopper he feelin' like he the Dolly Llama
Dolly proper and he aim that shit like Betty Crocker
Whip that shit, woop woop
Whip that shit

[Chorus x2:]
I'm out here screamin' what what
Not giving a fuck fuck
Cause I'm here to stay when you hear my name
You give it up up

[Russ:]
I feel it coming it's gon' happen any minute
I know it is because I told myself I'm in it
So what ya gonna do? When that shit comes true
And I laugh at you
Ha-ha (what you gonna do?)
Ha-ha (what you gonna do?)
Ha-ha (what you gonna do?)
Ha-ha
And I laugh at you

[Chorus x4:]
I'm out here screamin' what what
Not giving a fuck fuck
Cause I'm here to stay when you hear my name
You give it up up

Nah but for real sometimes you just gotta take a vacation
Take a vacation from yourself
Make sure you spend your own time doing the things you would like to do
Thank ya

[Chorus x4:]
I'm out here screamin' what what
Not giving a fuck fuck
Cause I'm here to stay when you hear my name
You give it up up
