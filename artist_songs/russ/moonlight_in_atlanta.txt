I just wanna...
Let you know...
Baby let your hair down

You're feeling like a smooth ride
Bottle of gin makes the mood right
Babygirl you're looking like the
Moonlight in Atlanta

You're feeling like a smooth ride
Bottle of gin makes the mood right
Babygirl you're looking like the
Moonlight in Atlanta

Okay, I'm rolling round the city
Hoping that the cops don't get me
Got this boricua on my right hand side, right hand side
Yeah, I tell her that I love her
Even though I really don't mean it
I'm sorry that I do you so cold sometimes

She said "I know you get lonely too"
I looked at her and said "then you know what to do"

I tell her bring the freak out
She's a step ahead she's on her knees now
Howling at the moon till the sun comes up
And now im getting lost in time
I ain't really got much on my mind
Other than I knew it when I first saw you

You're feeling like a smooth ride
Bottle of gin makes the mood right
Babygirl you're looking like the
Moonlight in Atlanta

You're feeling like a smooth ride
Bottle of gin makes the mood right
Babygirl you're looking like the
Moonlight in Atlanta

Baby let your hair down
