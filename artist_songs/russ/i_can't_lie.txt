I can't lie, I'mma get high tonight
I can't lie, I'mma get loose
Because I know someone died tonight
But I'm alive, this my proof

Life is getting pretty crazy, I can't lie
Everything is starting to multiply
From the fans to the girls to the self-expectations
From the money, but it's funny, my soul feels amazing
Dropped a couple thousand like it ain't nothing
And it's funny cause that money really ain't nothing
But a smile on my mom's face, smile on Giana's face
And I know the world is hungry but I got in my place

I can't lie, I'mma get high tonight
I can't lie, I'mma get loose
Because I know someone died tonight
But I'm alive, this my proof

Think about you, hope that you different
I got tattoos, I'm not scared of commitment
I'm just listening to the universe, hoping I'm not missing
Cause sometimes thoughts are so loud I don't hear what it's whispering
And the cops rolled up and I'm on probation
And I don't really need that vaKKKcation

I can't lie, I'mma get high tonight
I can't lie, I'mma get loose
Because I know someone died tonight
But I'm alive, this my proof

I can't lie, I'mma get high tonight
I can't lie, I'mma get loose
Because I know someone died tonight
But I'm alive, this my proof
