Oh, girl, you know you make me wanna
Oh, girl, I think I'm gonna do it, do it
Oh oh oh
Oh, girl, you know you make me wanna
Oh, girl, this is that Paulo Coelho
How I feel like yayo, how I feel like yayo
Oh, girl, you know you make me wanna
Oh, girl, I think I'm gonna do it, do it
Oh oh oh

Yea, we turn up fast, then we go slow
When I see thru you, that's when I go ghost
Like the car that I be drivin'
I'm bout to be a star, are you ridin'?
Oh, oh, tell me that you don't need a show
Tell me that you don't need a drink
Tell me that you don't need a smoke
Tell me that you don't need the pain

Oh, girl, you know you make me wanna
Oh, girl, I think I'm gonna do it, do it
Oh oh oh
Oh, girl, you know you make me wanna
Oh, girl, this is that Paulo Coelho
How I feel like yayo, how I feel like yayo
Oh, girl, you know you make me wanna
Oh, girl, I think I'm gonna do it, do it
Oh oh oh
