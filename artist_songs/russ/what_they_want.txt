They let us in the rap game
I swear they let me in the motherfucking rap game

Got a chick. I call her Lola
She feel like the ocean
Likes to drink and smoke some doja
And I feel like smoking
Plus she good at charming cobras
I feel like I'm chosen
But she ain't the only one no

Got a chick. I call her Catia
She be acting bougie
Then she came through and topped me off
Now she just a groupie
Got the aura of the mafia
Her friends wish they knew me
But they ain't the only ones, no

What they want, what they want, what they want
Dollar signs
Yeah, I know it's what they want
What they want, what they want, what they want
Yall ain't fooling me at all

I been at this shit for 9 years
Now they're starting to call
I'm a DIY pioneer
They tryna get involved
Yippee Kiyay, ah, yeah
'Bout to set it off
I'm probably the only one, yeah

Come correct when you approach me
I can size you up
Taking all the shots like Kobe
Almost 81
Guess I gotta play the goalie
And go and save me something
I'm probably the only one, yeah

What they want, what they want, what they want
Dollar signs
Yea I know it's what they want
What they want, what they want, what they want
Yall ain't fooling me at all

Who wants my money? I'll tell you: who I don't fuck with
Who's pulling strings? I'm just pointing out all the puppets
What I'm demanding is fucking up all the budgets
I'm smart as fuck.
They be talking like I'm the dumbest
But I know what they want from me
Dollars lot of stock in me
It ain't nothing personal
It's business, and I'm a commodity
But honestly
Pop Pop would be turning in his grave
The day I let someone else become the boss of me
When there's a boss in me
I'll be damned

What they want, what they want, what they want
Dollar signs
Yeah, I know it's what they want
What they want, what they want, what they want
Yall ain't fooling me at all
