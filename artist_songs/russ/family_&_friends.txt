Yeah
I just wanna, yeah, yeah
I just wanna, mmm
Yeah, still goin'

Woah, I don't wanna bitch
I just wanna help the people that I came up with
That includes my family, that includes my friends
If you not with us then don't pretend
Woah, I don't wanna bitch
I just wanna help the people that I came up with
That includes my family, that includes my friends
If you not with us then don't pretend

Uh, bitch tryna play me for a fool
Life's too good, I don't give a fuck
Don't really know what's up with you
Everybody know what's up with Russ
New sex symbol, plus he's rich
'Cause a hit song, that young boy lit
Got a couple plaques, I just showed up
Give me some time, no rush
I ain't gon' lie, this patience paid its toll
Mmm, fuck my actions, I got A-lists on my phone
Mmm, I got money but I spend it on the memories
I don't pipe, girl, I'm gon' be here for a century

Woah, I don't wanna bitch
I just wanna help the people that I came up with
That includes my family, that includes my friends
If you not with us then don't pretend
Woah, I don't wanna bitch
I just wanna help the people that I came up with
That includes my family, that includes my friends
If you not with us then don't pretend

I keep to myself, I don't get too close to strangers
You might see me comin' but you cannot see the gangsters
That's all I'ma say, 100k when it's show time
I did this myself, I'm my own co-sign
Dropped so many singles, I ain't never take a word break
You ain't hit a triple, lot of rappers born on third base
I just got plaques for my family and my friends too
Just to let them know success is possible for them too

Woah, I don't wanna bitch
I just wanna help the people that I came up with
That includes my family, that includes my friends
If you not with us then don't pretend
Woah, I don't wanna bitch
I just wanna help the people that I came up with
That includes my family, that includes my friends
If you not with us then don't pretend
