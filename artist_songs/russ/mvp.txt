Yeah
Make money off of bein' myself
Get a glimpse of my potential, I believe in myself
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

It's gettin' harder to tell the difference between reality and dreams
The lines keep blurrin' like I'm drivin' half asleep
I'm invitin' you to see who's next up in this rap shit
Hooks, beats and verses, every song I score a hat trick
Always said I'd never sign but lately, I been tempted
'Cause my dad just asked for gas money, my mom just said she spent it
It's easy to pass judgement when you comfortable in life
But desperation breeds a beast, the truth won't always be polite
So I'm fresh up off the flight, headed towards a life boat
Hope their word has good credit like a FICO
Only time will tell but I been feelin' like it's my time
How long you gonna keep your star player on the sidelines?
But, I'm the coach, guess God is the owner
Guess I'm just waitin' for that tap on my shoulder
Tellin' me to go in, I'ma stop the game
Blow the whistle like Snowden, young Terrell Owens
Makin' noise, still one of the greats though
I never RIP, I want MVP written on my gravestone
Your boy buzzin' in I swear this life is like a game show
One man army, when I sing, I get Tank hoes
Yeah, you know that R&B freak love
Weed so loud, I need you all to speak up
I hope every album that I drop has Carter 3 buzz
Wake up, I'm tryna live a life you couldn't dream of
I'm careful with who I include in all of this
'Cause most want a free ride but I ain't handin' out scholarships
Went to college for a semester
All it taught me was that college ain't for everyone
I'm not like everybody, so I left
My mom still supported but she was upset
'Till she saw the crowd scream my name out on Sunset
She got to watch her son light up the whole spot
Right there in that moment it's like she understood my whole plot
Different women, different offers every day now
I could see the reason why some people wanna hate now
'Cause my past 24 been more action packed than Jack Bauer
Made 100 thousand in the past hour
It's been a whirlwind, let me hit the blunt with you
Barely in the industry and I already got trust issues
Damn, or maybe past relationships, did that
I gave 'em all my trust and I ain't never get this shit back
But, fuck it, 'cause I'm on to new things
I looked up at the sky, long enough, I grew wings
Now I'm talkin' to myself like they gon' try and break you
God forbid that happens, breakdowns create break throughs
I'm sittin' on the debut, sounds like your greatest hits
Labels tryna eat, so of course they want a stake in it
And of course they talk of money, so of course I entertain this shit
Of course they lookin' at my table tryna find a place to sit
I'm patient with my process, weighin' all my options
Ya'll talkin' way too much, all these phone calls sound like auctions
Funny 'cause you used to laugh when I would say I'm ready
Now the ones who doubted me are gonna tell you how they met me
When I'm standin' where I knew I would, number 1 spot
Another year, another rapper, yeah, another one flop
Ya'll barely fuckin' the game, you on the scene for 5 minutes
Then you bust and it's over, I'm a movie, you're just a snippet
This that '89 Pistons, fuck the game up, get rings shit
Name your favorite rapper, bet I got him on my hit list
Name your dream girl, bet I end up on her wish list
Tell me how you want it, beast raps, or I could sing shit
It's time to wake up, industry full of hypnotists
I speak for myself, I don't need a ventriloquist
I need a vacation to where the real people live
You just stay on vacation, havin' real ego trips
You don't wanna admit, that without you I'd be fine
But the truth is hard to swallow when you chokin' on your pride
That goes for the girls I swooped in on
Made their brain drool, they gave top with a bib on
Always keep my switch on, watch me illuminate
Up at the studio, Drake is just a room away
Maybe I should barge in, maybe I should wait
This gon' be a funny story couple months from today
When I tell it, and it's like

Damn, yup
