Never made it as a wise man
I couldn't cut it as a poor man stealing
Tired of living like a blind man
I'm sick of sight without a sense of feeling
And this is how you remind me
This is how you remind me
Of what I really am
This is how you remind me
Of what I really am

It's not like you to say sorry
I was waiting on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
For giving you a heart worth breaking
And I've been wrong
I've been down
To the bottom of every bottle
These five words in my head
Scream "are we having fun yet?"

yeah, yeah, yeah
no, no
yeah, yeah, yeah
no, no

It's not like you didn't know that
I said I hate you and I swear I still do
It must have been so bad
Living with me 
Must have damn near killed you

And this is how you remind me
Of what I really am
This is how you remind me
Of what I really am

It's not like you to say sorry
I was waiting on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
For giving you a heart worth breaking
and I've been wrong
I've been down
To the bottom of every bottle
These five words in my head
Scream "are we having fun yet?"

yeah, yeah, yeah
no, no
yeah, yeah, yeah
no, no
yeah, yeah, yeah
no, no
yeah, yeah, yeah

Never made it as a wise man
I couldn't cut it as a poor man stealing
Tired of living like a blind man
I'm sick of sight without a sense of feeling
And this is how you remind me
Of what i really am
This is how you remind me
Of what i really am

It's not like you to say sorry
I was waiting on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
For handing you a heart worth breaking
And I've been wrong
I've been down
To the bottom of every bottle
These five words in my head
Scream "are we having fun yet?"

yeah, yeah
are we having fun yet
yeah, yeah
are we having fun yet
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeahhhhhh
