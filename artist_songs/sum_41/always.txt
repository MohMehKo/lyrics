Always
The whole way through
I'll stay true...

Calling your name out
If you could only hear me now
Words I have never said so loud
The choice that would never be without

I'll be with you always (Always)
Know that all these words that--
Now that I can feel
Something I never thought was real
I'll be with you always (Always)
Know that all these words are true

Calling your name out
If you could only hear me now
Words I have never said so loud
The choice that would never be without

I'll be with you always (Always)
Know that all these words that--
Now that I can feel
Something I never thought was real
I'll be with you always (Always)
Know that all these words are true

If you stay then I won't go
If you go, I'll always be there
I don't care

All I know
If you stay then I won't go
If you go, I'll always be there
I'll be there, I don't care, I don't care
Cause, always, I know...
