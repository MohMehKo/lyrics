I don’t expect you to believe
'cause through those eyes of yours you see just what you wanna see

Pieces of all your shattered dreams

If you keep your head so low you’ll never see what you could be

Take a look around we’re the same in all different ways
Take a look around we’re the same in all different ways

Do you want to really fight about differences tonight

Take a look around we’re the same in all different ways
But I... I don’t expect you to believe

'Cause when you think your race is run and you’re left standing there
with all your laces still undone
it’s like the end has just begun

And you feel so alone but know you’re not the only one

Take a look around we’re the same in all different ways
Take a look around we’re the same in all different ways

Do you want to really fight about differences tonight

Take a look around we’re the same in all different ways
But I.. I don’t expect you to believe

Don’t expect you to believe
'cause through those eyes of yours you see just what you wanna see
Pieces of all your shattered dreams

If you keep your head so low you’ll never see what you could be

Take a look around we’re the same in all different ways
Take a look around we’re the same in all different ways

Do you want to really fight about differences tonight

Take a look around we’re the same in all different ways
But I... I don’t expect you to believe
