Silence is screaming in my head
Stuck on repeat
Not much longer I'll be dead
So just forget me
I'm losing my mind
And I don't think you could save me this time

And it goes

[Chorus]
On and on
And I just feel helpless
how long will this take to wear off?
On and on
When will I get through this?
Welcome to my home town and down

I'm falling deeper in this hole, to disaster
I'm creeping what I thought control, was falling faster
I'm losing my mind
And I don't think you could save me this time

And it goes

[Chorus]
On and On
And I just feel helpless
how long will this take to wear off?
On and on
When will I get throught this?
Welcome to my home town and down

It's dragging on
I'm wearing thin
I can't stop these walls
They keep caving in
It's gone too far
Where's my mind?
Why can't time stop fear this paranoia?

Would you know when it's alright?
It does with me
Would you know when it's alright?
Well it does with me

And it goes

[Chorus]
On and on
And I just feel helpless
how long will this take to wear off?
On and on
When will I get through this?
Welcome to my home town and down

Welcome, welcome
(its never ending)
Welcome to my own doubt and doubt
Welcome, welcome
(i'm falling further)
welcome to my own doubt and doubt.
