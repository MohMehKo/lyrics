(Where'd I go wrong?)
Pull the curtain, begin
Paranoia's wearing thin now
It's wearing thin now
(Where'd I go wrong?)
Close my eyes, realize
I've become the victimized now
Desensitized now

The one and only day has come
I pay for all the bad things I've done

(Where'd I go wrong?)
Something's wrong because I 
Find the glamor in the dark side, 
In the dark side
(Where'd I go wrong?)
Cheap regrets, can't forget
Falling victim to the debts still,
Unpaid in my mind

The one and only day has come
I pay for all the bad things I've done

It's gonna take me, you don't know tragedy
I've been to hell and back, again to tell and
Close my eyes and lay me down to sleep
I fear the worst my beating heart ticks to explode
And my time is up so...

Why can't I just... SLEEP?

Living dead awake, 
The horror show begins
So pull the curtains over me

Bring on the panic
The uncontrolled and manic
It's a free-for-all kill them all
Every last one of them (Well, hey hey hey yeah) 
I don't care at all
[x2]

Suffocate the dreams in my mind
(I can't stop believing)
Drown the thoughts that have me confined
(Stop this heart from bleeding)
Gutter dreams as black as the night
(My intentions fold up)
No one told me empathy's a lie
(Lost in paranoia)

Suffocate the dreams in my mind
(my last words I'm choking, are all my dreams broken)
Drown the thoughts that have me confined
(the silence is deafening, my ears won't stop ringing)
Gutter dreams as black as the night
(my last words I'm choking, are all my dreams broken)
No one told me empathy's a lie
(the silence is deafening, my ears won't stop ringing)

[Previous Chorus Backup vocals as well]

Now we're gone, 
do you still feel the same way now?
Can't you see
I need help to stop 
me from myself?
But can't you help me now?
