Take the pictures off the wall
Erase the thoughts, forget them all
The choice is yours to save yourself
Or in the hands of someone else

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh [x4]

Broken thoughts and alibis
Conscience disappears in time
Voices are all that I can show
And all that I have is a soul

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh [x4]

Yeah.

You're a set-up to fail
You're a dead-beat on parade
With a foot in the gutter
And the other in the grave
You've cooked your silver spoon so black
So die

What can I say?
Guess it's obvious you would end up this way,
When you live amongst the dead.

The best of luck,
As the one and only resident scumfuk.
A victim or just a tragedy?

I hear you talk
But I don't hear you speak.
You don't make sense,
Your mind is incomplete.

I can't believe all the things that you say.
You just can't get enough.
We'll all be waiting here just for the day
That your time is up.

What can I say?
Guess it's obvious you would end up this way,
When you live amongst the dead.

The best of luck,
As the one and only resident scumfuk.
A victim or just a tragedy?

All that I need is time for me to breathe.
Dream little dreams that only I believe.
Now that I see beyond the light,
I know I'll be, I'll be alright.
