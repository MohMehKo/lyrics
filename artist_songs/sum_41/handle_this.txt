You said it once before, you don't do those things you used to anymore.
You say in doubt, were fading out, forgetting who we used to be.

Cause I will bring you down,
I don't want to miss, I don't think you can handle this.
You've lost what you can't find; it's never what you had in mind.

You take it with a smile; it's so easy when you're always in denial
Just in time but out of line I can't make all the same mistakes you want me to.

Cause I will bring you down,
I don't want to miss, I don't think you can handle this.
You've lost what you can't find; it's never what you had in mind.

Your giving up you know it's not what you need.
And it's true what you're going through.
Try so hard not listen to everything I never say.

Cause I will bring you down,
I don't want to miss, I don't think you can handle this.
Cause I will bring you down,
I don't want to miss, and I don't think you can handle this.
You've lost what you can't find; it's never what you had in mind.

I'm getting over getting used to,
And after all that I put you through now I see I'm not the only one.
I never thought it'd ever come to,
This in fact was never what you wanted from me or how you meant it to be.
