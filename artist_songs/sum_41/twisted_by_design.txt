I've got my scars to bear
Stitches just can't repair, woah
There's no one to blame this time
Absolution's waiting on a prayer

I'm breaking down the walls
Unveiling my share of faults, woah
This blood on my hands, is a blessing
In a lifetime, twisted by design
(But I'm so alive)

Is it a threat or the cure
Cause it's a brave new world
I don't know if I'm ready for
Just a test
Cause I'm miles up above you
Flying with no safety net
I don't believe in fate although
This time I think I've met my match
Why are the dreams so hard to catch

Cause you forget in time
What it feels inside
You live right on the line
(But I'm so alive)

They say believing is the hardest part
But I say with every beat of my heart
I alone will find my way
And get right back to the start
They say the fire in your heart is gone
But I say it's really only just begun
All along you know that I'm
I'm twisted by design
I'm twisted by design

I'm taking the days as they come
But now I'm seeing the world as if it had a thousand suns
I admit that there's somewhere along the lines
I guess I lost my grip
But luck has turned the page
And time is all I need to get things right
One more chance to catch the light

Cause you forget in time
What it feels inside
You live right on the line
(But I'm so alive)

They say believing is the hardest part
But I say with every beat of my heart
I alone will find my way
And get right back to the start
They say the fire in your heart is gone
But I say it's really only just begun
All along you know that I'm
I'm twisted by design
I'm twisted by design

Starting over again, but the further I get
I can't stop these walls from closing in
Going out of my head, all the tears that I've bled
They're not enough to take my pain away

They say believing is the hardest part
But I say with every beat of my heart
I alone will find my way
And get right back to the start
They say the fire in your heart is gone
But I say it's really only just begun
All along you know that I'm
I'm twisted by design

In some ways I've changed
And I've left it all behind
But I can't change the way
That I'm, I'm twisted by design
