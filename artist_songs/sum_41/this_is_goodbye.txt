Take a look around you 
Consequence surrounds you 
I would cross my heart and hope to die 
You should thank your lucky stars and 
Count your fading scars cause 
No one said you had to live a lie 

Too late my friend it's over (Memories broken) 
Nice to know ya 
Guess that means this is goodbye 

Days will come and go by 
You will never know why 
You're the victim of your own denial 
You took the vow of contradiction 
Bound by lies and fiction 
Holding onto nothing all the while 

Too late my friend it's over (Memories broken) 
Nice to know ya 
Guess that means this is goodbye 

This is goodbye 
So nice to know ya 
Time has come and gone 
This is goodbye 

This is goodbye 
So nice to know ya 
Time has come and gone 
This is goodbye 

Guess that means this is goodbye 

This is goodbye 
So nice to know ya 
Time has come and gone 
This is goodbye 

This is goodbye 
So nice to know ya 
Time has come and gone 
This is goodbye
