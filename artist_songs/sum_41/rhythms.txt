Mad in a way but I don't say,
It's what you're used to.
I got the words but can't convey.
I know you'll turn it all around,
Cause that's the rhythms that you go through
Get it back and you're not obliged to say,
Not intact but you're better off anyway.
Somehow it's never up to me.
What if I would say?
Simple words I can't relate.
I don't place upon your view, 
It's the rhythms that you go through.

I know what I want, 
You just take me through the motions.
I know what I want,
And that's more than you can say.

Since you found me out,
Since you found me out,
Since you found me out,
Since you found me out.

Your story still remains
It's so unlike still you stay the same,
And all the while you're counting on your day to come,
But nothing ever told you.
You would say that it's only for a day.
Yesterday's last week tomorrow's on its way.
And I'm falling faster all the time.

What if I would say?
Simple words I can't relate.
What came easy is now too late. 
And it was always standing right in front of me. 

I know what I want, 
You just take me through the motions.
I know what I want,
And that's more than you can say.

All the time you thought worth saving,
You still end up with memories fading.
After all that you wouldn't do,
It makes no sense, but it's that rhythms that you go through.

I know what I want, 
You just take me through the motions.
I know what I want,
And that's more than you can say. I know what I want, 
You just take me through the motions.
I know what I want,
And that's more than you can say.

Since you found me out,
Since you found me out,
Since you found me out,
Since you found me out.
