perfection is my direction
even if that's all i had
it's not like a need no correction
i just know that life's not so bad

picture this, everyday kids that just can't find a way
stuck in disarray, cant find hope for better day
it's the degeneration of childhood frusteration

over the past 30 years teenaged death has increased 
over 300% in north america
and is the second major cause of death in Canada

perfection is my direction
even if that's all i had
it's not like a need no correction
i just know that life's not so bad

when will all my problems disappear?
am i just going crazy from the fear?
oh my oh my i'm going far past the brink
this pressurs's like a weight and i still can't think straight

perfection is my direction
even if that's all i had
it's not like a need no correction
i just know that life's not so bad

i've met my destinations
what's left to complain about? 
all these aggravations
building 'till the seams fall out
i'm running my mouth dry 
with every time i lie

but dont tell me without a doubt with dumbfound luck has all run out
but dont tell me without a doubt with dumbfound luck has all run out

perfection is my direction
even if that's all i had
it's not like a need no correction
i just know that life's not so bad
