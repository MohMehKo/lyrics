Here, as I stand, all the signs become so clear
To get back home again, sometimes I lose my way

Because I'm bound to fall
And just lose it all
Am I running out of time?

I'm breaking the chain from the life I knew
Beaten black and blue, it's time
To be face to face with the lies I choose
Throw the truth into the light
Make no mistake, I've paid my price
I've done my time with the devil in disguise
'Cause the life I knew has a different view
Tonight, I'm breaking the chain

Days pass me by like I'm saving wasted time
I'm not alright, I think I've fallen for the lie

And as it fades to black
I'm not looking back
I'm still blinded by the lights

I'm breaking the chain from the life I knew
Beaten black and blue, it's time
To be face to face with the lies I choose
Throw the truth into the light
Make no mistake, I've paid my price
I've done my time with the devil in disguise
'Cause the life I knew has a different view
Tonight, I'm breaking the chain

'Cause I'm done chasing, chasing yesterday
(I've lost the feelings)
Scars don't fade, they never go away
(And I'm still bleeding)

Every step I take
All the chains I break
It brings me one step closer

Breaking the chain

I'm breaking the chain from the life I knew
Beaten black and blue, it's time
To be face to face with the lies I choose
Throw the truth into the light
Make no mistake, I've paid my price
I've done my time with the devil in disguise
'Cause the life I knew has a different view
Tonight, I'm breaking the chain

I'm breaking the chain
I'm breaking the chain
