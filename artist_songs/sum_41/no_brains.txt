Can't step in my way
head first in your love and dismay
It's like beating the dead
I can't stop going out of my head
whatever this could be I'd never know,
I never said it'd be the end all to be all

I hate you today,
I can't find a way,
don't drag me down now,

[Chorus:]
Goodbye, I've had enough frustration
I won't get stuck
Goodbye, this dead end situation,
it's just not worth my time

It's no better today,
I never thought it would end up this way,
you've got something to say?
don't wanna hear it if it gets in my way
All this confusion, wondering, so overwhelmed,
All this illusion seems so clear,
Can't find conclusion dissapointing evolution
not all things aren't what they appear

So what's the point of this hell?
I know you too well we're running backwards,

[Chorus]

But waiting so frustrating, I'm so sick of
All this tension not to mention, I'm so sick of
Can't take it, you won't make it, just save yourself this trouble 
(everything's alright)
Get down and pray for yourself 'cause I'm just fine
(everything's alright)

[Guitar Solo]

You speak for all of us when you can't be heard
(I can't help you anymore than)

I'll bet you haven't listened to not one word
(I have helped myself before)

You speak for all of us when you can't be heard
(I can't help you anymore than)
(So sick of, feel so sick of, so sick of, feel so sick of)

I'll bet you haven't listened to not one word
(I have helped myself before)
(So sick of, feel so sick of, so sick of, feel so sick of)

[Chorus]

But waiting so frustrating, I'm so sick of,
All this tension not to mention, I'm so sick of, sick of you!
