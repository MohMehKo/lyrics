What am I to say?
I'm all wrapped up in apathy
and I don't want to stay this way
There's nothing left to do
now that I am onto you
All I want to know is the truth

And I don't want to go
but I feel like I should
Cause' I'm falling apart
and I die, and die, and die

How could you be the better part of me
when we're only half of what we used to be?
Today, could you see, this isn't what we need
and I'm leaving all the pieces how they fell
So goodbye, farewell

What am I to say?
I still remember everyday
and memories don't fade away
And it all falls apart
in the shadows of the past
It can seem to be so hard but it's time the feelings pass

How could you be the better part of me
when we're only half of what we used to be?
Today, could you see, this isn't what we need
and I'm leaving all the pieces how they fell
So goodbye, farewell

To pull the trigger is now what you've waited for
I stand accused myself, sometimes I'm wrong, God help me
And hear beneath my lie, what am I praying for?
I don't believe in hell but I just might be there tonight

How could you be the better part of me
when we're only half of what we used to be?
Today, could you see, this isn't what we need
and I'm leaving all the pieces how they fell
So goodbye, farewell
Goodbye, farewell
