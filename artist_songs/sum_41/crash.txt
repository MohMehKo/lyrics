Hold me now 'cause I couldn't even if I tried
It's over now I guess it really is my time
I don't want to go but it's time I gotta say goodbye
So hold me now 'cause this will be our last time

I'm slowing down and I don't think that I can fight
I know somehow you'll find a way to live your life
Remember just to live everyday like it's your last
And hold me now 'cause I think it's time for me to pass

I don't wanna die, I don't know why
This kind of fate was meant for me
You gotta be strong, gotta move on
It's not how it was supposed to be

What do I say it was never supposed to end up this way
What do I have to do
Was supposed to grow old with you

But that ain't gonna happen
No that ain't gonna happen

Hold me now 'cause the time I've got's running out
No tears allowed even though we've become without
I just wanna feel your head laying on my chest
So hold me now as I take my last breath

I don't wanna die, I don't know why
This kind of fate was meant for me
You gotta be strong, gotta move on
It's not how it was supposed to be

What do I say it was never supposed to end up this way
What do I have to do
Was supposed to grow old with you

But that ain't gonna happen
No that ain't gonna happen
