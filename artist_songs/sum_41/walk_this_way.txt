[Ja Rule]
Backseat lover always hidin underneath the covers
Till I talked to your daddy, he say
He said, you ain't seen nothin
Till you're down on a muffin
Then you're sure to be changin your ways
I met a cheerleader
Was a real young bleeder
Oh, the times I could reminisce
Cause the best things of lovin
With her sister and her cousin
Only started with a little kiss
Like this!

[Nelly]
Seesaw swingin with the boys in the school
And your feet flyin' up in the air
Singin "hey diddle diddle"
With your kitty in the middle of the swing
Like you just don't care
So I took a big chance
At the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play
Wasn't me she was foolin
Cause she knew what she was doin
When she taught me how to walk this way

[Sum 41]
Walk this way
Talk this way
Walk this way
Talk this way
She told me to walk this way
Talk this way
Walk this way
Talk this way
Just gimme a kiss
