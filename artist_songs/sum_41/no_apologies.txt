I've heard it before 
I'm straight out of line 
The image of malice 
With one evil mind 
I've got no excuse 
It's my alibi 
A victim of fashion 
Dressed to do or die

Don't worry about me 
I'm not your misery 
All reject, no respect 
(I don't, I don't, I don't...) 

I don't want to be a conclusion 
Victim of confusion 
And I'll stay, my own place, right here in nowhere 
So here's my resignation 
From the desperation 
I'm the saint of hopeless 
I'll make no apologies 

Well this is a call 
Throughout and across 
The underdog nation 
The hopeless and lost 
'Cause we're not the ones 
To walk with the dead 
Disciples of no one 
By no one we're led 

Don't worry about me 
I'm not your tragedy 
All reject, no respect 
(I don't, I don't, I don't...) 

I don't want to be a conclusion 
Victim of confusion 
And I'll stay, my own place, right here in nowhere 
So here's my resignation 
From the desperation 
I'm the saint of hopeless 
I'll make no apologies 

Na, na, na 
Na, na, na 
Na, na, na, na 
(I make no apologies)

I don't want to be a conclusion 
Victim of confusion 
And I'll stay, my own place, right here in nowhere 
So here's my resignation 
From the desperation 
I'm the saint of hopeless 
I'll make no apologies
