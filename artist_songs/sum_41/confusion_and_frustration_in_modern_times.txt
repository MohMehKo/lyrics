Up in smoke pop goes the culture
The tension blew it up
While choking from my bleeding ulcer
We eventually threw it up
So what went wrong?
Where's the voice of reason?
It's long gone, we lost it long ago
Apathy plus-sized filled the void of motivation
I can hardly breathe at all

Confusion's all I see
Frustration surrounds me
Solution's bid farewell
Sedation? What the hell

I broke the mirror to the past
to find what I was looking for
The bleeding heart of broken glass
is all I found and nothing more regrets
Short of no correction
Paid my debts to anxiety
The iron lung collapsed from the pressure and the swelling
I can hardly breathe at all

Confusion's all I see
Frustration surrounds me
Solution's bid farewell
Sedation? What the hell
[x2]

Dead end roads and warning signs
Destination nowhere in sight, so!

Divided we stand, together we fall
There isn't a god that can save us all
So don't pray on your knees
Just beg on your hands
There is no belief in this promised land
Divided we stand, together we fall
There's no god that can save us all
So don't pray on your knees
Just beg on your hands, 
There is no belief in this promised land
There is no belief

Confusion's all I see
Frustration surrounds me
Solution's bid farewell
Sedation? What the hell
[x2]
