Trying to find a way
Getting better everyday
And I got you now I'm not alone
All I need in this life is one
One thing to believe in 

I've seen many a face
From young and to old
I've stolen their faith and I have broken their souls
Was here before Christ had forgave you your sins 
And paid your price and sealed your fate within
Days have come to an end
Today's the day that we meet again
The self-inflicted inebriation guilt never lies

I've been waiting for the chance to reunite this sick romance
Poison never hurt so good
So nice of you to speak of me
Your closest friend and enemy
And holy savior of masochists
Well it's the dead end slave
From the alter to the grave
It's the last days of our lives
In faith amen

Time, it's been so long
And now there's nothing to say
I'm trying so hard to find the words to say
I'm tired of being, now I'm something I'm not
I can't believe and I never thought
Days would come to an end
Well maybe someday we'll meet again
If ever that day never comes
It would be too soon
My love

I've been waiting for the chance to nullify this sick romance
Pull the chord to detonate
So sick of you don't speak of me
The reverend saint of misery
And holy savior of masochist
Well it's the dead end slave
From the alter to the grave
It's the last days of our lives
Well it's the dead end slave
From the alter to the grave
It's the last days of our lives
In faith amen

Now I've found a way
Getting better every day
And I got you now I'm not alone
All I need in this life is one
One thing to believe in 

Trying to find a way
Getting better every day
And I got you now I'm not alone
All I need in this life is one
One thing to believe in
