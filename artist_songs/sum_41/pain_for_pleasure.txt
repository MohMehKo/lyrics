The seas have parted, 
the endings started, 
the sky has turned to black.
A killing spree through eternity, 
the devil stabs you in the back,
It's midnight now you must escape somehow, 
torture is his leisure,
don't try to hide he'll make you subside, 
as he exchanges pain for pleasure,

[chorus]
Pain for pleasure, he's the hunter you're the game,
Pain for pleasure, Satan is his name!"
