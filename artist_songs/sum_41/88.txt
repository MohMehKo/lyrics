Wait how long would you wait
just for me to call
I know you make mistakes
yeah but
I hope some day you have it all
cause I feel like a prisoner
trapped inside this broken world
while I'm playing the victim again
running in circles
to me it's all the same
and though nothing's gonna change
Still, I hope someday you have it all

Take this aggravation that I've thrown myself into
change this situation just cause I need something new

And still I feel like a prisoner
trapped inside this broken world
while I'm playing the victim again
running in circles
to me it's all the same
and though nothing's gonna change
Still, I hope someday you have it all

I hope some day you have it all

if we could all depend
on what we know
if you could understand
I'm losing control
that I'm losing control
that I'm losing control
that I'm losing control
