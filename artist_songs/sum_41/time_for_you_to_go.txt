Going in alone, did my time and now I'm done
It's so easy
All the faces that I see don't mean anything at all to me
But you've got me going now
Out of my mind and it's a hell of a time, yeah

I don't wanna say what I don't mean
but I'm trying just to let you know
That I don't wanna cause a scene
but I'm sorry girl, it's time for you to go

I'll tell you everything that you know you never wanna hear
Cause' it's true
I'd give you all I've got but there's nothing there that you could use
Oh, you've got me going now
Out of my mind and it's a hell of a time with you now, yeah

I don't wanna say what I don't mean
but I'm trying just to let you know
That I don't wanna cause a scene
but I'm sorry girl, it's time for you to go

I don't wanna say what I don't mean
but I'm trying just to let you know
That I don't wanna cause a scene
but I'm sorry girl, it's time for you to go

[Guitar Solo]

I'll tell you everything that you know you never wanna hear
Cause' it's true
I'd give you all I've got but I'm the only thing you'd use
You've got me going now

I don't wanna say what I don't mean
but I'm trying just to let you know
That I don't wanna cause a scene
but I'm sorry girl, it's time for you to go

I don't wanna say what I don't mean
but I'm trying just to let you know
That I don't wanna cause a scene
but I'm sorry girl, it's time for you to go
