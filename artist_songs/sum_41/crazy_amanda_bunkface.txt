Don't know what you really got. 
It's hard to stay and not pretend. 
You can't make sense in what you thought. 
It seems I can't comprehend. 
Well I'm happy to be, only all that you see. 
And I'm not one to learn to be the same. 

I don't wanna hear you bitch no more. 
I was better off a year before. 
No matter how I try I can't ignore. 
Every time I think my brain gets sore 
When I'm with you. 

What's so hard about good-byes? 
I'm sorry I'm just not as keen 
On planning out our perfect lives 
When I'm only 19. 
I'm happy to be only all that you see. 
And I'm not one to learn to be the same. 

I don't wanna try and just be friends 
Nothing's change my mind again 
If ever there were thoughts I had they're dead. 
I can't even think inside my head, 
When I'm with you 

I'm on my way, can't you see that's the truth. 
So long, can't stay,can't you see that's the truth. 
I'm on my way,can't you see that's the truth. 
So long, can't stay, can't you see that's, 
See that's the, see that's the... 

Last that I could take. 
because it's getting really hard to fake. 
It's not like it's my problem that you're late. 
But can't you just spare the lies I hate? 
When I'm with you...
