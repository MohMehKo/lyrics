there's no doubt in my mind when it's over
what is done will be
you will find when life gets colder there's no sympathy
there's no point trying you can't escape the bitter end
well who will greet you when you're at the bitter end

all your choices chosen you've got no say
your decisions made
face your consequences as your life begins to fade
as time keeps spinning closer to the bitter end
well who will greet you when you're at the bitter end

take a look at yourself as time keeps racing
is all you've come to be
what you expected or are you still chasing possibilities
cause all your prayers won't save you from the bitter end
well who will greet you when you're at the bitter end
