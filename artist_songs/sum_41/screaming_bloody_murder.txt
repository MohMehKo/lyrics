I'm not quite myself these days
Guess we all come undone time to time in different ways
Well, I have myself to blame.
Guess I don't understand, I need help in many ways.

God's got a plan for me
Well, I'm gonna tell you one thing:
I don't got the patience or the time!
What can I say?
I'm no angel,
I'm not forsaken,
But I can bleed!

Tear me open
I believe
God will send you all to bleed!
And no one can deceive
What is meant to be
And "Bloody Murder"
We will scream!

Well I guess it's time for me
Tell me what I'm left to believe in?
'Cause I don't know the concept of the pain
I don't want the fate I'm just losing
I can't prove it,
Watch me bleed!

Tear me open
I believe
God will send you all to bleed!
And no one can deceive
What is meant to be
And "Bloody Murder" we will scream!
God will send you all to tear me open!

[Guitar solo]

'Cause I'm not giving up
Your self-control suffocated to the plough
I'm my worst enemy
Who can't be saved.
I'm just his disgrace

Tear me open
I believe
God will send you all to bleed!
And no one can deceive
What is meant to be
And "Bloody Murder"
We will scream!
God will send you all to tear me open!

These days are strange, it's true.
There's not a thing that I would change,
No mistakes that I'd undo.
