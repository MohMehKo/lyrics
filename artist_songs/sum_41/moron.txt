It's hard enough to even fake a smile
Disalusion - I'm in denial
There's something missing
Cause I can't feel a thing
I'm Desinitized!

You can fake this
And I can't take anymore
I'm not so tough
I can't ignore..

You can fake this
And I can't take anymore
I'm not so tough
I can't ignore..anymore!

All this confusion is running deep inside my head.
How long can I keep this up
Before I end up dead!?

I can't beleive it 
It could come to this

It's only feelings
So I can't resist

Apology for in denial 
But I still try to believe in something

You can fake this
And I can't take anymore
I'm not so tough
I can't ignore..

You can fake this
And I can't take anymore
I'm not so tough
I can't ignore..anymore!

Anymore!
Anymore!
ANYMORE!!
