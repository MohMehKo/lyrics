Don't come to me with your problems
I don't need them
Your conscience is a weight that I won't hold
You'd rather be
The only one who pretends
Is it 'cause you've been bought and sold so young?

Don't ask me questions
Cause I don't got the answers
If you only knew what time will tell
It's all a test
The lessons that you can't learn
You'll know when you spend your time in hell

So as your blood's running thin
Your time's running out
No one will be listening
Not even when you shout
When your angels turn to devils
You'll finally figure out
That no one will be with you in the end

A hypocrite
You're just a contradiction
rapped up in your lies who knows what's real
Well this is it
Your lonely life of fiction
Do you even know how to feel?

So as your blood's running thin
Your time's running out
No one will be listening 
Not even when you shout
When your angels turn to devils
You'll finally figure out
That no one will be with you in the end
[x2]

The end!
The end!
The end!
