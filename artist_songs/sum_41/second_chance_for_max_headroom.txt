It's not enough you passed it for a while,
You can't afford the amass of denial.
Don't explain, you can't arcane it too.
Your lies surpassed your doubt.

Don't do something you'll regret 

It's not enough you passed it for a while,
The time you take, 
Your minds mistake,
Time worth throwing all away.

It's not enough attention,
Though you're too proud to mention,
I can't go on pretending,
That it's still the same
