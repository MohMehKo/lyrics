Look at me
Who am I supposed to be 
and what do I believe?

Can you tell me
Since you've made up your mind
Who knows what you believe

And I just don't know
Oh I just don't know 
Who I'm supposed to be

Look at me
Am I the image of your hopes and tragedies?
Just look at me
Will I ever be more than just a memory?

'Cause you just don't know
Well, you just don't know 
All I am is me
All I am is me
All I am is me
