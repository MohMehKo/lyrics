Take my breath away, I don't need it anyway
'Cause I'm fine here in my old forgotten world
where I can be myself, left with the hand I'm dealt
It's hard to get a grip when you're holding onto something
you just let slip away

All these thoughts stuck in my mind
spinning round like endless time
For once in my life I do wanna feel
something you call real
I don't think that I've got
time for these scars to heal
And the days just go by,
leaving questions in my mind
I guess I'll find the answers
some day in another life

Here with my old friend, the silence in the end
And it rings so loud that I cannot pretend
If I just close my eyes and ask a thousand whys
Will it change or stay the same? Will it ever go away?
The question still remains

All these thoughts are in my mind
spinning around like endless time
For once in my life I do wanna feel
something you call real
I don't think that I've got
time for these scars to heal
And the days just go by,
leaving questions in my mind
I guess I'll find the answers
some day in another life

Warning signs read desolation
On the road of desperation
Happiness machines, I'm coming clean
What can you do for me?

I do want to feel
something you call real
I don't think that I've got
time for these scars to heal
And the days just go by,
leaving questions in my mind
I guess I'll find the answers
some day in another life

Oh oh oh oh

So here now I stand at the end
Of a dark road out of hell
It's not so hard as I depart
What a way to become a man
