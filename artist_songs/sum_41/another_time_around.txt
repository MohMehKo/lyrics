In my years, I've seen all sounds of misconception.
In my years, I've done all I can live to question. 

What happened to me I don't understand.
I've seen all I can see as my time expands.

Bored I am, bored of my own desperation,
I can't defend, can't find my own destination.

What happened to me I don't understand.
I've seen all I can see as my time expands.

So what's up with you, what's up with me.

I'm not the one I can't pretend,
What would I be if I did it all again.

And I sometimes wish I would have asked some
questions.
Then maybe I would have a clearer life perception.

What's up with you, what's up with me.
