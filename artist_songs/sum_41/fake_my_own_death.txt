All bets are off but you still
Think that you've gotta a right well
Your lucky days are numbered now
(And you're to blame)
You built a castle of sand.
Shaking the devil's hand well
At least I've still got my soul to sell.

You've got to take me away
Cause I wanna feel (wanna feel)
Something that's real (thing that's real)
Help me escape
Cause I wanna be (I'll take my last breath)
Left to be free (I just wanna fake my own death)

You played your part of the whore
You got some kinda nerve or
Have you forgot I don't forget
(And you're too late)
You walk beside the dead where
The angels never tread well
At least I've still got a soul to sell.

You've got to take me away
Cause I wanna feel (wanna feel)
Something that's real (thing that's real)
Help me escape
Cause I wanna be (I'll take my last breath)
Left to be free (I just wanna fake my own death)

There's nowhere to run
From hell and above
I swear to a god that someday
There will be blood.

It all comes down in the end
In spite of me you do it all again.
It all comes down in the end
In spite of you I'll do it all again.

You've got to take me away
Cause I wanna feel (wanna feel)
Something that's real (thing that's real)
Help me escape
Cause I wanna be (I'll take my last breath)
Left to be free (I just wanna fake my own death)
