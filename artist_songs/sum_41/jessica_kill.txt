Oh, my love how do I explain how I've come to feel this way
I'm addicted to the pain even more than words can say
Every hit hurts like your kiss, like a needle to a vein
My last words it is begin,
I want you

She said you don't even know
How just how much I need it
How far will you go
I just wanna feel you cum

You make me so crazy
But I'm OK, just take me
Take it very slow
'Cause I'm in love tonight

So now that it has come to this
I'll be your dirty little thrill
For the world I wouldn't miss
Cause I just wanna feel your kill

Self inflicted masochist
How could anyone resist
My last words it is begin,
I want you

She said you don't even know
How just how much I need it
How far will you go
I just wanna feel you cum
You make me so crazy
But I'm OK, just take me
Take it very slow
'Cause I'm in love tonight

Tell me the difference between love and death
You fear them both as they take your breath
Tell me the difference between love and death
You fear them both as they take your breath

And all of this comes to an end
But I cannot resist your death

She said you don't even know
How just how much I need it
How far will you go
I just wanna feel you cum
You make me so crazy
But I'm OK, just take me
Take it very slow
'Cause I'm in love tonight

She said you don't even know
How just how much I need it
How far will you go
I just wanna feel you cum
You make me so crazy
But I'm OK, just take me
Take it very slow
'Cause I'm in love tonight
