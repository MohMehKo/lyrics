I stood out on the road 
and I watched as you were leaving. 
The leaves were dancing oranges and reds 
and they circled all around me like confetti on fire. 
They were nothing when compared to the burning in my head.

I was lost, I was gone, 
I was falling for you.

That summer came and went. 
You were working for my family, 
one more job and then your classes would begin. 
And you promised we'd be quiet, 
and we hid behind the garden. 
I walked out more than a woman than I walked in.

And I was lost, I was gone, 
I was falling. 
I was lost, I was gone, 
I was falling for you.

I went down to the church, 
I offered my confession. 
I swore I'd never do it again, 
I swore I learned my lesson. 
Oh, but every year when the leaves appear 
your memory comes sweet and clear. 
I never will forget you 
and I never did regret you.

I was lost, I was gone, I was falling. 
I was lost, I was gone, I was falling.

I stood out on the road and I watched as you were leaving. 
The leaves were dancing oranges and reds.
