Gonna need some more gold, workin' as hard as I can
To build it, my next gilded cage with my own two hands
I've made some mistakes, I'm gonna make some more
But I'm clear
They brought me here
A world worthy of makin' 'em for

I'm taking off my armor, already cut to the bone
The prodigal daughter on her way back home

Burn the maps to this place, I don't need one anyway
I can find you by charting the lines to every smile on your glorious face
The past is behind me
Always there to remind me
To haunt me, to scare me, to taunt me, to dare me to jump and fly

I'm taking off my armor, already cut to the bone
The prodigal daughter on her way back home

I'm alive and wide awake.
Better that my heart should break
Than forget how to feel.
So here's to chance and something real.

I belly up and they ask, "Girl, what you have?"
Take one and double up
Drown myself in the beautiful struggle of
A life well lived
And a love worth earning
And a big heart to give
To the one fiery sole who can handle my burning

I'm taking off my armor, already cut to the bone
The prodigal daughter on her way back home, way back home

Gonna need some more gold, workin' as hard as I can
