Stood there boldly
Sweatin' in the sun
Felt like a million
Felt like number one
The height of summer
Never felt that strong
Like a rock

I was eighteen
Didn't have a care
Working for peanuts
Not a dime to spare
But I was lean and
Solid everywhere
Like a rock

My hands were steady
My eyes were clear and bright
My walk had purpose
My steps were quick and light
And I held firmly
To what I felt was right
Like a rock

Like a rock, I was strong as I could be
Like a rock, nothin' ever got to me
Like a rock, boy, I was something to see
Like a rock

And I stood arrow straight
Unencumbered by the weight
Of all these hustlers and their schemes
I stood proud and I stood tall
I was high above it all
I still believed in my dreams

Twenty years now
Where did they go?
Twenty years
I don't know
I sit and I wonder sometimes
Where they've gone

And sometimes when it's late at night
And I'm bathed in the firelight
The moon she comes callin' a ghostly white
And I recall
Oh, I recall

Like a rock, I was standin' arrow straight
Like a rock, chargin' from the gate
Like a rock, I was carryin' the weight
Like a rock

Like a rock, with the sun upon my skin
Like a rock, I was hard against the wind
And I see myself again
Like a rock
Like a rock
Like a rock
