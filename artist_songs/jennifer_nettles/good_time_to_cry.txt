Turn out the lights.
Pour the last drink of the night.
Try to drown out the pain,
But it won't drain a thing.
If it's half full or half empty,
It's still half just the same.

I think it's time, a good time to cry.
Let it all go, a good time to cry.
When the sorrow and the laughter,
A good time you're chasing after,
Make you question why,
I think it's a good time to cry.

Reach for his hand.
Take him home and let him prove he's a man.
He'll never know you're making love to a ghost.
You can fill your arms, it won't feel your heart.
It don't even come close.

I think it's time, a good time to cry.
Let it all go, a good time to cry.
When the sorrow and the laughter,
A good time you're chasing after,
Make you question why,
I think it's a good time

For pain only broken hearts know
When there's no holding on and you have to let it go.

It's a good time to cry, let it all go.
A good time to cry.
When the sorrow and the laughter,
A good time you're chasing after,
Make you question why,
I think it's a good time to cry.
I think it's a good time to cry.
