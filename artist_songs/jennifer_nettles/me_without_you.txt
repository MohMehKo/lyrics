A little kiss of freedom, 
I've forgotten how that tasted. 
A little room for breathing, 
then you're on your way. 
There's a million little reasons 
for this smile on my face. 
Without those tears in my eyes 
I bet you'd hardly recognize me.

Without you, well you left the cage door open 
and your pretty bird just flew. 
And I never knew, that I could fly so high 
and the sky could be this blue. 
I can't believe it's real, 
so this is how it feels,
me without you.

Now I wake up early, 
whole world feels new. 
Seems so strange to ask myself 
what do I want to do. 
Now I don't know this road I'm on 
or where it's leading to,
but I know I'm gonna be alright. 
The more I see, the more I like me.

Without you, well you left the cage door open 
and your pretty bird just flew. 
And I never knew that I could fly so high 
or the sky could be this blue. 
I can't believe it's real, 
so this is how it feels, 
me without you.

Oh you had me believing I didn't have the strength for leaving. 
But any fool can see I'm better off, just look at me.

Without you, well you left the cage door open 
and your pretty bird just flew. 
And I never knew that I could fly so high 
and the sky could be this blue. 
I can't believe it's real, 
so this is how it feels. 
I can't believe it's real, oh, 
so this is how it feels, 
me without you, me without you.
