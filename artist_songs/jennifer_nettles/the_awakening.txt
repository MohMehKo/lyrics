Gather yourself, up 'til now there's been no clue
The awakening will be swift and harsh and rude
And it won't be what you know and it won't be what you'd expect
And it will carry with it the force of fear-inspiring wreck
This keeps me up all night, makes me pass the day in bed
And it's caused me such grief, it's been months since I've bled
But I will do what is right, I will do what's expected
No I won't be chastised and I won't be rejected

But I will wait for you to come around
And I will wait for you to change your mind
And I will give you your one last chance over and over a thousand times

I wanted to be your shelter, I wanted to be your home
I wanted to be your reason and have that reason made known
So no one would know my weakness, no one would hear what I'm thinking
I am the biggest coward; they call the woman of the hour

Doing eighty miles an hour, I roll the window down
And with the freedom heavy on the air, I felt that I would drown
And everything is different, and though freedom had its price
A poor man's Joan of Arc, through the ashes still I rise

Cause I did wait for you to come around
And I did wait for you to change your mind
And I did give you your one last chance over and over a thousand times
And I will live out of love and I will act out of fairness
And I will be the richness that lies beneath the surface of awareness
