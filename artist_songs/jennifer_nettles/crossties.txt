Well I am sweating in this crowd
Holding fast to the one I love.
All the world seems alive and loud
As we relish the siren singing above.
When this spirit dancing next to me
Offered something I could not believe.
She said they've called me out of this world soon but
I'm glad we shared this before I leave.

She laid the cross ties of her disease with her words 'cause she was weary.
Felt like the beams of this cross upon my back that I already carry.
And I'm telling you this story cause it was so damn bewitching.
And I am singing you this story so you are forced to hear my bitching.

He says he knows I won't come to visit, his voice a familiar nervous smirk.
I said for sixteen years you've packed your bags but that guilt trip you're on has never worked.
And you can tell me a hundred times that you're happy with this life you've made.
But I know your daughter for a party wasn't an even trade.

He laid the cross ties of his disease with his life 'cause he was weary.
Felt like the beams of this cross upon my back that I already carry.
And I'm telling you this story cause it was so damn bewitching.
And I am singing you this story so you are forced to hear my bitching.

Well standing here right now I know I'm about as cool as I'll ever get.
Head back, blistering my lungs, lips slightly parted and wet.
And if you've got the guts to hear it, this is where I'll always be.
My soul's in my throat so let me clear it 
And tell you that your point of view is a little different than my point of me.

We lay the cross ties of our disease with our words 'cause we are weary.
Feels like the beams of this cross upon my back that I already carry.
And I'm telling you this story 'cause it was so damn bewitching.
And I am singing you this story so you are forced to hear me piss and moan.
