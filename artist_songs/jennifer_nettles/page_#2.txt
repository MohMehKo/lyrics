He said, "You're one of those girls who's not too pretty 
Not too ugly, oh I guess you'll have to do." 
I said, "You must be reading the story of my life boy 
And if you like the beginning wait 'til page number two." 

'Cause some have tried to polish and others to refine me 
Still those that would say all my edges are too smooth 
I'm stuck here in the middle just trying to define me 
To rummage through the ruin and find some living bleeding through 

'Cause I have decided that here is where I'm staying 
And no matter where I'm going here's where I will stand 
And as long as I am breathing 
I'll sing my joy and my grieving 
And I'll fumble with this guitar until arthritis takes these hands 

I ponder what will happen and how I'll leave this earth 
And wonder what of this life will have me 
Will I go like my grandma, rejoicing rebirth 
Or will I go like my grandpa, kicking and screaming? 

I guess in the meantime I should stop all this thinking 
Find peace with the searching, whether lost or ever found 
So if you want me I'll be with Gracie, laughing and drinking 
Raising toasts and raising spirits and smashing empty glasses down 

'Cause I have decided that here is where I'm staying 
And no matter where I'm going here's where I will stand 
And like all the ones before us I'll raise my voice in holy chorus 
And I'll watch the sacred circle as it ends where it begins 

'Cause I'm one of those girls who's not too pretty, not too ugly 
Oh I guess I'll have to do 
And I'm currently rereading the story of my life boy 
I can't wait to find out what happens on page number two
