When I was a seeker
I sought both night and day
I asked the Lord to help me
And He showed me the way

Go tell it on the mountain
O'er the hills and everywhere
Go tell it on the mountain
That Jesus Christ is born

He made me a watchman
Upon the city walls
And if I am a Christian
I am the least of all

Go tell it on the mountain
O'er the hills and everywhere
Go tell it on the mountain
That Jesus Christ is born

While shepherds kept their watching
Oh wandering flock by night
Behold throughout the Heavens
There shone a holy light

Go tell it on the mountain
O'er the hills and everywhere
Go tell it on the mountain
That Jesus Christ is born

Go tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
Go tell it on the mountain
That Jesus Christ is born

Go tell it on the mountain
O'er the hills and everywhere
Go tell it on the mountain
That Jesus Christ is born
That Jesus Christ is born
That Jesus Christ is born
