Hey sleepless, my eyes are red
Why don't you get out of my bed 
I don't want to watch the fan no more 
And hey crazy, that's enough
I'm sick of tripping on all your stuff 
Scattered across my bedroom floor 

Hey heartbreak, give me your key
It's you, it's not me 
Oh, you only bring me down, down, down, down 
Hey heartbreak, don't come back
I swept up your shattered glass
What goes around is coming back around, round, round, round

Hey heartbreak, I'm breakin', I'm breakin' up with you
Heartbreak, I'm breakin', I'm breakin' up with you 
Heartbreak, I'm breakin', I'm breakin' up with you

Hey laughter, where's your smile?
Haven't seen it in awhile 
And I miss the drunken nights 
Hey lonely, won't you leave me alone
If you call me ain't nobody home
Go find somebody else 'cause I'm going out tonight

Hey heartbreak, give me your key
It's you, it's not me 
Oh, you only bring me down, down, down, down 
Hey heartbreak, don't come back
I swept up your shattered glass
What goes around is coming back around, round, round, round

Hey heartbreak, I'm breakin', I'm breakin' up with you
Heartbreak, I'm breakin', I'm breakin' up with you 
Heartbreak, I'm breakin', I'm breakin' up with you, you, you, you, yeah 
Heartbreak, I'm breakin', I'm breakin' up with you
Heartbreak, I'm breakin', I'm breakin' up with you
Heartbreak, I'm breakin', I'm breakin' up with you

Everything I thought that I needed, turns out I had 
Everything I thought that I wanted, I'm giving back 
Starting a mend, that's beating again 

Everything I thought that I needed, turns out I had 
Everything I thought that I wanted, I'm giving back 
Starting a mend, that's beating again 

Hey heartbreak, give me your key
It's you, it's not me 
Oh, you only bring me down, down, down, down 
Hey heartbreak, don't come back
I swept up your shattered glass
What goes around is coming back around, round, round, round

Hey heartbreak, I'm breakin', I'm breakin' up with you
Heartbreak, I'm breakin', I'm breakin' up with you 
Heartbreak, I'm breakin', I'm breakin' up with you, you, you, you, yeah
Heartbreak, I'm breakin', I'm breakin' up with you
Heartbreak, I'm breakin', I'm breakin' up with you 
Heartbreak, I'm breakin', I'm breakin' up with you, you, you, you, yeah

Heartbreak, I'm breakin' (breakin' up with you)
Heartbreak, I'm breakin'
Heartbreak, I'm breakin', I'm breakin' up with you
