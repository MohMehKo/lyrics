I spent twenty years tryin' to get outta this place.
I was lookin' for somethin' I couldn't replace.
I was runnin' away from the only thing I've ever known.
Like a blind dog without a bone,
I was a gypsy lost in the twilight zone.
I hi-jacked a rainbow and crashed into a pot of gold.
I been there, done that,
I ain't looking back on the seeds I've sown.
Savin' dimes spendin' too much time on the telephone.
Who says you can't go home?

Who says you can't go home?
There's only one place they call me one of their own.
Just a hometown boy born a rollin' stone.
Who says you can't go home?
Who says you can't go back?
I been all around the world and as a matter of fact,
There's only one place left I wanna go.
Who says you can't go home?
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright,
It's alright, it's alright.

I went as far as I could, tried to find a new face.
There isn't one of these lines that I would erase.
Lived a million miles of memories on that road.
With every step I take I know that I'm not alone:
You take the home from the boy,
But not the boy from his home.
These are my streets, the only life I've ever known:
Who says you can't go home?

Who says you can't go home?
There's only one place they call me one of their own.
Just a hometown boy born a rollin' stone.
Who says you can't go home?
Who says you can't go back?
Been all around the world and as a matter of fact,
There's only one place left I wanna go.
Who says you can't go home?
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright,
It's alright, it's alright.

It doesn't matter where you are;
It doesn't matter where you go;
If it's a million miles away,
Or just a mile up the road:
Take it in, take it with you when you go.
Who says you can't go home?

Who says you can't go back?
Been all around the world and as a matter of fact,
There's only one place left I wanna go.
Who says you can't go home?
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright,
It's alright, it's alright.
Who says you can't go home?
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright,
It's alright, it's alright.
Who says you can't go home?
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright,
It's alright, it's alright.
Who says you can't go home?
