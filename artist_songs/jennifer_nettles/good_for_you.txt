I used to be good for you
But now I'm good for nothing, and no one
Don't know where's my know-how
About this strange love thing I do

I sit here in silence as I watch your thoughts dirge across your face
You say you feel sick, well I'm feeling sick now as I say
I'm not your messiah, still I'm too much of a saint to tell you

I'm tired of tip-toeing around, all around myself
See I've misplaced my God
And replaced it with something else
I don't want to say it.
Cause you know if you don't say it, it's not real
But I can't go in silence, cause I think and I breathe and I feel
I wish you'd realize that I'm never gonna be your beck and call girl

I know that I used to be good for you
But now I'm good for nothing and no one
Don't know where's my know-how
About this strange love thing you do.
