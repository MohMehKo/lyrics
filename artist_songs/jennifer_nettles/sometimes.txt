Sometimes I get so still it makes me dizzy.
I end my solo moonlight dance and bow out gracefully.
Sometimes I still let you play the prophet in my head, as I play back the words you said.
So in my mind I can go back in time and tell you, you were wrong.

And you'd say, "Remember the time I called you wildflower?"
I guess you took me a little too seriously.
You'd say, "it's not just you, it's just your bravado that causes my worry."
I can see you saying this to me.

One time I undressed my soul to wander.
I found a greener shade of meadow, and sat right down to rest.
That time you rolled your eyes away to ponder the things your own soul took for granted and your own loneliness, but I digress.
'Cause you'd say, "Remember the time I called you a river fat with your own rain?"
I guess you took me a little too seriously.
You'd say, "It's not just you, it's your indifference that causes my worry."
I can see you saying this to me.

Myself, I don't have anyone to blame except your self-appointed sacrifice to save me.
Though you know that nothing's ever gonna change 
You try your baby, baby, baby's.

And now sometimes, I still relive your benediction.
Sounds like the voice of a thousand angels armed to rescue me.
Sometimes I still paint my door red and say a prayer that your spirit won't pass there.
That all these wisdoms of a lifetime of just-like-yous has set me free.

And you'd say, "Remember the time I called you a kiss blown from a thousand miles away?"
I guess you took me a little too seriously.
Yes I know it's not just me, it's just my bravado that causes my worry."
I can see you saying this to me.
