You moved so gracefully, nothing at all like me.
Give us a smile and wave, you always did know to kill me.
I can't remember ever feeling this way,
A burning feeling rushing all through my veins.

What got in me is something more than envy.
I should be above it I know, but I just can't let it go.
You might have heard it, I said you don't deserve him.
But girl don't take it personally cause it's just j-j-j-jealousy, yeah.

Now I didn't really mean to cause such an ugly scene.
Sure went off at your house, half drunk and crazy bitch I called you out,
Or at that party where I made such a mess
And poured my whiskey down the back of your dress.

What got in me is something more than envy.
I should be above it I know, but I just can't let it go.

K-k-killing me, all my jealousy [x4]

I'll stop clowning all that make-up you wear,
I won't tell anyone you bought a new pair.
I'll even tolerate your skanky fake hair
Cause we both know you win, honey you got him.

K-k-killing me, all this jealousy [x4]

You can have him, you can have him, you can have him.
I'm looking for something in green, I think you know what I mean.
