Don't want to change, don't wanna play that money ball. 
I've been here a long time, I'm here for the long haul. 
This ain't no text, it's a long distance phone call. 
It's bigger than you, oh bigger than me.

Do as you want now, do as I please. 
We all change with the wind or the bank man sneeze. 
Mother nature and the market, they make no apologies. 
It's bigger than you, bigger than me.

And the sun shines down on New York City, 
and the Lord smiles down on us all. 
And a thousand years will pass 
and we'll be memories and food for the grass. 
And another baby girl will wait down south and answer the call.

Come into this world with a will to survive. 
Facebook emoticon replaces the high five. 
Seven billion people, turns out the world is a bee hive. 
It's bigger than you, oh bigger than me.

The nuclear family explodes and it burns. 
If you lose the receipt you can't make the return. 
We all earn our keep but can't keep what we earn. 
It's bigger than you, bigger than me.

And the sun shines down on Music City, 
and the Lord smiles down on us all. 
And a thousand years will pass 
and we'll be memories and food for the grass. 
And another baby boy will wake up north and answer the call.

"You've been Youtubed," the revolution said to a song. 
Read it on the radar, tell you right from wrong. 
Headed down the rabbit hole so just sing along. 
It goes on, on, on, and on.

And the Lord smiles down on us all. 
And a thousand years will pass 
and we'll be memories and food for the grass, 
watching our futures turn into our past. 
Hold on tight it all goes so fast. 
We're all waiting to answer the call.
