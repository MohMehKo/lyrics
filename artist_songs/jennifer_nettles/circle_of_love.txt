Circle of love, halo of light
When Jesus was born, on that Christmas night
And, oh, what a night! That Holy night was
When Bethlehem glowed in the circle of love

God sent his Son, His great gift to us
Salvation for all, He loved us that much
We honour and praise that gift from above
He holds all of us in the Circle of Love

Circle of love, halo of light
When Jesus was born, on that Christmas night
And, oh, what a night! That Holy night was
When Bethlehem glowed in the circle of love

Happy birthday to You. We praise and we sing
We celebrate You. We are so glad You came
Happy birthday to You, Jesus. Let us lift You up
How thankful we are for all of Your love
So Jesus was born, wore a crown of thorns
Gave it all up just to save us

Circle of love, halo of light
When Jesus was born, on that Christmas night
And, oh, what a night! That Holy night was
And Bethlehem glowed in the circle of love

Circle of love
In the circle of love
