What more can I do for you
As I stand her naked before your eyes
To do what you will as you always will do
Should I roll up my sleeves
Or simply turn my head
Easy access to all of the vampires
Who secretly wish me bleeding and dead

Oh, just ask
Cause I am a bleeder
Oh, just ask
For all the bottom feeders
Oh, just ask
I'll be her much  longer
And I will be stronger
Than you know
Stronger than you'll ever know

How much longer will this last
That she will play the mental punching bag
For all of the blows he's received in the past
How much longer can she keep the peace
Between these beauties that sprung from her belly
And the cycle that rages in the blood of his beast

Oh, just ask, cause she is a giver
Oh, just ask
She'll stand and deliver
Oh, just ask
She'll be her much  longer
And she will be stronger
Than you know
Stronger than you'll ever know

Well, is the anger that draws you to these songs
'Cause I've got notches in my belt
More bruises that prove that what you assume
Couldn't be more wrong
Or is the struggle
A shared common grief
To see a lover, a mother, another women get by
By the skin of her teeth

Oh, just ask
They'll dub you a fighter
Oh, just ask
The guts and glory rider
And you will fill up their hearts
And you will fill all their needs
And they will love you darlin'
Until you succeed
Yes, they'll love you darlin'
Until you succeed
