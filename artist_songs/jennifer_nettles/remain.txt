Hang around, I don't have to make this one so heavy
Stick around, could I challenge or dare you to stay
I just don't know what it is that makes me this wanderer
All I know is I was put here to be in love and I want to remain that way.

I am tired of this bile that fills up my belly
Even more, of this fire that smokes in my eyes
All I want is a moment of peace, peace without boredom
And to forever remain breathless

Could you for once say it even if you aren't sure you have the balls to stick it out?
Could you stop sticking to this plan when you never have a day in your life
If for nothing else to grant me this moment to breathe, expand and let go

You say. "trust me, trust me I'll know when the time is best"
And I try my damnedest to make my voice sound like a smile, I swallow hard and I lie to you yes
'Cause my heart is so full that it's pushing it's way through these two ribs in my chest
But for now I'll force it to remain with my hand clutching my breast

Could you for once say it even if you aren't sure you have the balls to stick it out
Could you stop sticking to this plan when you never have a day in your life
If for nothing else to grant me this moment to breathe, expand and let go
