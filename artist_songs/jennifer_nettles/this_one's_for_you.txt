Early morning, you're still sleeping. 
The silence is singing and it's got me to thinking of 
so many love songs, so many love songs, 
but this one's for you.

Won't be the last one, sure ain't the first 
to fall for someone and try to put in words. 
They're so many love songs, so many love songs, 
but this one's for you.

Oh, and I'm not one to carry on and on. 
And I may not be the poetic type, no. 
I'm not always the most refined. 
Oh but even so, I just want you to know 
This is the way I'll show you how I feel. 

You are the rhythm, you are the rhyme. 
You are the music and melody and the reason behind why there's 
so many love songs, so many love songs, 
but this one's for you.

Oh, and I'm not one to carry on and on. 
And I may not be the poetic type, no. 
I'm not always the most refined. 
Oh but even so, I just want you to know 
This is the way I'll show you how I feel. 

They've all been written thousands, I know 
but when you hear this one playing, 
you can say it's your own. 
There's so many love songs, so many love songs. 
There are so many love songs, so many love songs. 
There are so many love songs, but this one's for you.
