Baby, there's something I've got to tell you
You're looking awfully good tonight
And if this glass has anything to do with inhibitions
I'll come right out and tee you you're a sight.

For these poor eyes, I'll cut the lies and playing hard to get
I'll stop and pray that you will stay and I'll have no regrets
Look in this face I'll give you grace if you haven't understood it yet.
You don't have to go home if you will stay with me tonight.

Now with the iron nerve of ten thousand seasoned soldiers, 
A conversation I move to strike.
But as my mouth moves to make these first advances 
My breath gets caught up in mid flight

My face is red
I hang my head
I'm awe-inspired by
Your every move,
I start to swoon,
Oh God I think I'll cry.

Look in this face, please give me grace, allow me to tell you why.
You don't have to go home if you will stay with me tonight.

Well, I got myself a hand on the bottle 
And I know just what that means cause,
Just like you it ain't easy to swallow and I fight off all that it brings.

Well, I can lie to myself and deny it.
But that ain't nothing new to you.
Here's my story for you to analyze.
My book is open to you.
And you don't have to go home if you will stay with me tonight.
