Home for the holidays
I believe I've missed each and every face
Come on and play my music
Let's turn on [?] love light in the place
It's time I found myself
Totally surrounded in your circles
Whoa, my friends

Please, celebrate me home
Give me a number
Please, celebrate me home
Play me one more song that I'll always remember
And I can recall, whenever I find myself too all alone
I can sing me home

Uneasy highway
Traveling where the Westerly winds can fly
Somebody tried to tell me
But the men forgot to tell me why
I gotta count on being gone
So come on mamma, come on daddy
Be what you want from me
I'm this strong, I'll be weak

Please, celebrate me home
Give me a number
Please, celebrate me home
Play me one more song that I'll always remember
And I can recall, whenever I find myself too all alone
I can make believe that I've never gone
And I never know where I belong
But [?] sing me home

Please, celebrate me home
Give me a number
Please, celebrate me home
Play me one more song

Celebrate, celebrate
Celebrate me home
Celebrate, celebrate
Celebrate me home
Celebrate, celebrate
Celebrate me home

Celebrate, celebrate
Celebrate me home
Celebrate, celebrate
Celebrate me home
Celebrate, celebrate
Celebrate me home

Well I'm finally home
(Celebrate, celebrate)
I'm finally here
Celebrate me home
