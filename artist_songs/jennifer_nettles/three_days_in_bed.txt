The clock never stops
And I hate this damn phone
Somedays I wanna run
From the place I call home
Guess I'm just needing some danger
Give me three days in bed
With a stranger

We drank all that wine
On the Champs Elysees
We got carried away
On the banks of the Seine
Woke up on old
Boulevard St. Germain
Give me three days in bed
With a stranger

You take the hard stuff
It's menthols for me
I don't smoke but I do
On occasions like these
Now that I've got me
A French man to please
I'll have one Robertino
And you can have me

I barely can wait
To go back there again
With your body so warm
And your face in my hands
You know how I love
To meet all your demands
Give me three days in bed
With a stranger

You take the hard stuff
It's menthols for me
I don't smoke but I do
On occasions like these
Now that I've got me
A French man please
I'll have one Robertino
And you can have me

The clock never stops
And I hate this damn phone
Somedays I wanna run
From the place I call home
Guess I'm just needing some danger
Give me three days in bed
With a stranger
Everyone's needing some danger
Give me three days in bed
With a stranger
