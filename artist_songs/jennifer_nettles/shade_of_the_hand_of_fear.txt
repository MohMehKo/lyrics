Wait a minute mister,
I think it might be best,
Cause the way you look sure seems to suggest the slightest bit of interest,
I should come with a warning.

See the majority of my life I've been in rare form,
You know a couple of steps below the norm.
But I'd empty the pockets of the jeans I've worn tonight,
If you'll forget yourself until the morning.

Cause I'm thinking I could kiss you the warmest of all your breathing days.
You don't have to kiss me back.
I just need to be sure I remember the way, 
It could make me comfortable.

See I haven't slept for going on five hundred years
And hide me 'neath the shade of the hand of fear,
And don't be confused the way I look is merely
A nack for finding dark corners.

Ask my friends cause they all think they know,
Least it seemed from the last letter that he wrote,
That I just can't calm down this hot-blooded music in my throat.
And in comparison it made him boring.

Still I'm thinking I could love you,
The sweetest of all your breathing days,
You don't have to give it back.
I just need to be sure I remember the way,
It could make me comfortable.

So wait a minute mister,
I think it might be best,
Cause the way you look sure seems to suggest
The slightest bit of interest.

I should come with a warning.
