O Holy night, the stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Saviour's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
'Til He appeared and the souls felt its worth
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn

Fall on your knees!
Oh hear the angel voices
O night divine!
O night when Christ was born
O night divine!
O night, O night divine

Truly He taught us to love one another
His law is love and His gospel is peace
All chains shall He break everyone is our brother
And in His name all oppression shall cease
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we
With all our hearts we praise His holy name

Fall on your knees!
Oh hear the angel voices
O night divine!
O night when Christ was born
O night divine!
O night, O night divine!
