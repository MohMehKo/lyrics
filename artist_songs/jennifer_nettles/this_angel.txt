Who is this angel, sent here to change me, 
sent here to take me where I've never been? 
Long I have wandered, weary and waiting, 
For something to shake me and life to begin. 

Holy water from my own veins, 
come and save me where I lay. 
All this longing for beauty unnamed. 
It has broken me open to welcome the hope that you bring.

Can you hear me calling, come let me hold you. 
Naked and falling into my arms 
with every breath in my body, the sweetest surrender 
is losing myself in all that you are.

Holy water from my own veins, 
come and save me where I lay. 
All this longing for beauty unnamed. 
It has broken me open to welcome the hope that you bring.

Holy water from my own veins, 
come and save me where I lay. 
All this longing for beauty unnamed. 
It has broken me open to welcome the hope, 
it has broken me open to welcome the hope, 
it has broken me open to welcome the hope that you bring.
