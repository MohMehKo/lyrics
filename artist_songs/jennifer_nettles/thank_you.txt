Have I ever told you how much it meant
For all your kindness,
I am blessed and I thought that you should know
How much you've helped me grow.

I wanna thank you.
I wanna tell you this,
That you've made me the happiest.
Thank you.

Have I ever shown you all my heart.
For all I owe you, where would I start?
A lifetime to count the ways wouldn't be enough to say
That I thought that you should know
How much you've helped me grow.

And I wanna thank you.
I wanna tell you this,
For all of your selflessness.
Thank you.

I wanna say I love you,
And if we never meet again,
You should know you have changed my life,
Just by being a friend, oh.

Could I ever repay you for all you've done?
Out of all my blessings, you're the greatest one.
And I thought that you should know
How much you've helped me grow.

And I wanna thank you.
I wanna tell you this,
That you've made me the happiest.
Thank you. Thank you.
