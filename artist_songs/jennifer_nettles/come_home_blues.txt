Well baby come home
You know I got that itch
Baby come on home
You know I got that itch
Come home and scratch my belly baby
Watch my ankle twitch

Well baby come on home
You know I miss that smell
Pretty baby come on home
You know I miss that smell
Come loosen up my collar baby
Watch me wag my tail

Well I ain't no saint
And you ain't know fool
I'll do to you what I want done to me
We'll practice that Golden Rule
Come home there ain't a moment none to soon
Well since you been gone baby I been howlin' at the moon

Well baby come home
You know it's been too long
Pretty baby come on home
You know it's been way too long
Don't keep me sittin' and beggin' baby
Throw this bitch a bone
