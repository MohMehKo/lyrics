She's a woman on a mission, always in the church 
If you need a ride into town, her offer is the first 
Yeah she thinks that if she's perfect, she can outrun all the hurt
But that ain't how salvation works 

That steeple still needs paintin', they're out there cuttin' grass
There's a two line Sunday sermon, she'll miss 'cause she drives too fast 
And the message on the marquee, reflected in the glass 
Is every sinner has a future and every saint has a past 

He's a man with a memory that turned into a curse 
Keeps every bottle empty until he's numbed down to the nerve 
He thinks that forgiveness is reserved for soles like hers 
But that ain't how salvation works 

That steeple still needs paintin', they're out there cuttin' grass
There's a two line Sunday sermon, she'll miss 'cause she drives too fast 
And the message on the marquee, reflected in the glass 
Is every sinner has a future and every saint has a past 

I can quote the bible, the chapter or the verse 
And heavens just a promise for those left here on Earth 
But I believe that God loves us more then we deserve 
And I hope that's how
Yeah, I hope that's how 
I hope that's how salvation works
Salvation works 
Oh, I hope that's how 
I hope that's how
