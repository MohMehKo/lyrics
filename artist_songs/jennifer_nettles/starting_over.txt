21 days can be a long time
I thought the worst of it was over 
Thought I was doing fine 
So when my friends called, I didn't stop to think 
I grabbed my coat, I grabbed my keys
I said it's just a drink, but I was wrong 

Here I am and there you are 
I'm a second seemed to stretch 
And in this breath that I can't catch 
I lose my heart as you lean in 
Just like that, you set me back where I begin 
Starting over, getting over you, again 

I haven't called you, I haven't even wanted to 
And when I heard that you went out, I never asked with whom 
It's like you always know, you see right through me 
And when I'm done with you, you find me and undo me every time 

Here I am and there you are 
I'm a second seemed to stretch 
And in this breath that I can't catch 
I lose my heart as you lean in 
Just like that, you set me back where I begin 
Starting over, getting over you

Oh, let me love you or let me go 
How I can do this I don't know 
Just when I think I'm really through
And when I think I'm over you 

Here I am and there you are 
I'm a second seemed to stretch 
And in this breath that I can't catch 
I lose my heart as you lean in 
Just like that, you set me back where I begin 
Starting over, getting over you, again 
I never be over, getting over you, again, again
