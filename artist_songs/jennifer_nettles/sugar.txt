They like their Dominos, their Sweet’ N Low, their cookie cutter queens
Simple syrup overdose and their cotton candy dreams
Little pink package you put me in
Serving it up like saccharin
Always had a bitter taste to me

And all the boys say
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme some of that sugar
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme something sweet
They want my sugar and spice and everything nice
And they’re begging for a taste of my cherry pie
But I’m never, never, never, never ever gone give’em a piece

Mama always told me that it takes a little bit of honey
If you wanna attract yourself a bee
But I kinda like it with a little sting
I’m gonna make’em buzz when they hear me sing
And they’ll swarm around me like I was a queen

And all the boys say
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme some of that sugar
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme something sweet
They want my sugar and spice and everything nice
And they’re begging for a taste of my cherry pie
But I’m never, never, never, never ever gone give’em a piece

Don’t you go a changing
Cause they only like you one way
Oh but this girl you see
She’s just pieces of me
And I’m more than just a topping
Not your marshmallow frosting
On your Betty Crocker chocolate cake

And all the boys say
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme some of that sugar
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme something sweet
They want my sugar and spice and everything nice
And they’re begging for a taste of my cherry pie
But I’m never, never, never, never ever gone give’em a piece
