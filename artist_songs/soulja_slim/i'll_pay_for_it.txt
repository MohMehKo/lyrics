[Soulja Slim]
Oh shit, (um, um), oh shit(um, um), oh shit(um, um)

[Verse One]
Look I like 'em with a small waist and nice hips
so when I'm hittin from the back I get a nice grip
I be sweatin like a dog and I might slip
so with the right incase I get a nice vise grip
I got that work and I just come from doin time again
you can't skip you see the line that they standin in
don't trip I got enough of dick for all of ya'll
they say that I'm a dog right after I knock 'em off
she mad at me tryna get me out of my money
you gets nothin from me you gon' be broke round the fall this Sunday
believe that you gonna see that
I'm a thug ain't no love for the club rats
yeah I told you I was breakin bread
but breakin bread to No Limit you heard what I said
I ain't stutter I'm a tricky ass motherfucker
if you a hustler let me see you work them booty muscles(get jiggy wit it)

[Chorus]
I'll pay for it, I'll pay for it
I'll pay for it, I'll pay for it
if I want it, if I want it
if I want it, if I want it
I'll pay for it, I'll pay for it
I'll pay for it, I'll pay for it
if I want it, if I want it
if I want it, if I want it

[Verse Two]
I'm a leave some passion marks are fire red
suck on that neck like a vamp when we in that bed
I'm not 'Jada' I stopped 'kissin' along time ago
I'm a playa and I don't put nothin pass a hoe
move on it slow but I'll move fast when I want that ass
they break(??) got that rock haters throw the stash
I'm a holla I got Caramel waiting on me, Red hatin on me
she think I really give a fuck that she skatin on me
what you ain't heard the news all of 'em confused
for everyone that I lose I bounce back with two
you in love with me I'm in love with you
not mentally but physically what ya mouth do
yeah that booty loose like a rubber band
I ain't make it like that, thats with that other man
I just started hittin it a few weeks ago
if you a pro let me see you make that thing show

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
Let me see ya walk makin niggaz mad
she hatin on you cause she ain't workin wit too much ass
I'm waitin on ya to make me and my dogg proud of ya
throw that ass this way I gotta few dollars for ya
I'm hollerin for you I got three 50's and eight 20's
I'll give you these three 50's if you rollin wit me
the rest goin on a mothafuckin hotel
Soulja Slim got that work you can go tell
I got my doggs screamin on the Nextel
I'm a mothafuckin dog send me to hell
I fuck all these bitches, I fuck all these hoes
I'm a dog nigga, a mothafuckin dog like that

[Chorus]
