You know how I'm coming (uh huh)
You know exactly how I'm coming
(I'm telling you) It don't stop
Shit don't stop

[Chorus: x2]
My jacket consist of
Batteries on robberies, pistol charges, and murder
I know I'm the realest nigga ya heard of besides Pac
Got niggaz screaming Soulja from the street to the cell block

[Verse 1]
You bitchu
Soulja Slim and his committy is coming to getchu
My mag 90 bullets hitchu and splitchu
In half, let a bitch boy stab
Won't last up against these mother fuckers that use to taking blood baths
I been smoking blounts with the devil thats why my eyes are red as the fuck
Now tell me do I look like the type that will be scared to bust?
Well guess what? I'm screaming out murder me and I'm vest up
Chest up
Test nuts
Watch up while I fletch ya
You bitch made and I'm self made
Magnolia calia mag made
I get through like a scale blade
And Kunta Kente your left leg
I play surgeon and I'll be slpurgen
In anonymous nasty big bourbons
Don't stunt dog
Whatever I say I'll come withcha I'll come dog
I'ma get mine for the two G's
Take it for I say please
I fuck with twirkers not the twirkees
Put it long will give a nigga the herpes
So I stay back, I mean way, y'all didn't notice how I say that?
Well mother fuck y'all hated waving on three G's laid back

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
As one time we was clicc tight
What the fuck going on? I just come home my shit aint going right
Everybody branching off doing they thang
Some of 'em in the studio and some of 'em they slang
Thats how it go I know this rap shit aint gone last forever
So I stash cheddar for hard times flipping to make it better
I can take ten G's and make twenty more ten G's with that
I'm from the 6 'co circle where all the hustlers at
You busters scaking from round me with all that junk claiming
In 95' In random time remaining bust the brain in
Smoking blounts and snortin cane with my girl Big Ree
Til I started spooking out thought a nigga was trying to kill me
Nigga feel me

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Picture lil daddy think he raw musta forgot I'ma vet
Crushing up his memory and then give him set for the flow of that
I gotta way of making all real niggaz feel my pain
Anymore player hating ass fake niggaz look at me strange
Reverse the game, Fuck his head up leave him in the middle of the street
Nigga shit aint tight enough to geep a G with me
Actually, you don't even suppose to be in my presence
So I'ma ask you like a man, (shit) playboy get to stepping
Now if you walk off with that look like you gone get your weapon
And I'ma do ya something for all that stuntin and repping
Now as the beat on for my flirters stop
Til I make your drop it like its hot
I can run some shit that will make you pussy pop
Don't matter if you real or not
Play my game and I'll cheat on ya
Pull the rubber off and skeet on ya
Haters slanging that shit pussy for me on the Magnolia street corner
You's a hoe nigga
You I know nigga
And I put that on all my 6 'co fa sho niggaz
I'm X4L chief of the mag booyay
Fuck what them niggaz doing tomorrow cause I doing my thang today
Thats how I'm living just game giving to make y'all recognize
I been doing this and I aint never took of my camoflauge

[Chorus x3]
