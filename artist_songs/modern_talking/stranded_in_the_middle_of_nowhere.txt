Albatross
Show me a dream of love
Albatross
Without her love I'm lost
Good love never dies
Angels never fly so high
I'm dreaming, dreaming
Coming back to me

I'm stranded in the middle of nowhere, take care
I'm stranded in a struggle of my dreams, it seems
Baby, oh I need you more
Like roses need the rain
Baby, oh I need you more
Come and take my hand

Albatross
Harder I try, bluer I get
Albatross
Don't leave me alone - I'm sad
Oh, I find my home
Right back where I started from
I'm dreaming, dreaming
Coming back to me

I'm stranded in the middle of nowhere, take care
I'm stranded in a struggle of my dreams, it seems
Baby, oh I need you more
Like roses need the rain
Baby, oh I need you more
Come and take my hand

I'm stranded
Nobody cries, time's on my side
I'm stranded
I don't know where but you're not there
I'm stranded
Playing the fool, breaking the rules
I'm stranded
Take up your hand, and make a friend

I'm stranded
Nobody cries, time's on my side
And I'm stranded
I don't know where but you're not there
And I'm stranded
Playing the fool, breaking the rules
I'm stranded...
