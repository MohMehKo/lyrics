You are so far, oh like a star
Oh I feel inside, I miss you tonight
Do anything to make your mine

A lonely night, the stars shine bright
I have an idea to have you near
Here just by my side

Send me a little SMS to my heart
Send me a little SMS like I do
Oh, baby I will never tear it apart
'Cause my heart is missing you

Send me an S, send me an M
Send me an SMS to my heart
Send me an S, send me an M
Send me an SMS and we try a start

Hey little girl, it's a lonely world
Hear my SOS, babe, I confess
Cannot live without your love

I'm lost in space, wanna see your face
Wherever you be, send some words to me
Send a message to my heart

Send me a little SMS to my heart
Send me a little SMS like I do
Oh, baby I will never tear it apart
'Cause my heart is missing you

Send me an S, send me an M
Send me an SMS to my heart
Send me an S, send me an M
Send me an SMS and we try a start

Send me a little SMS to my heart
Send me a little SMS like I do
Baby I will never tear it apart
'Cause my heart is missing you

Send me an S, send me an M
Send me an SMS to my heart
Send me an S, send me an M
Send me an SMS and we try a start
