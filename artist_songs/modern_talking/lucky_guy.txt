I feel your heart's tune
I feel the same moon
I hear the lust tune
Over and over again
Without end
I feel the flowers
I feel the showers
I hear the lust words
Over and over again
Without end

Oooo-oo-ooooh
I feel lucky guy
Oooo-oo-ooooh
I feel lucky guy

Tomorrow when all things are shapin'
Tomorrow then I'll be with you
Tomorrow when your heart is achin'
I'll keep on lovin' you

I feel the magic
There's been no tragic
I hear you laughin'
Over and over again
Without end
I see you walkin'
I hear you talkin'
I feel the lovin'
Over and over again
Without end
