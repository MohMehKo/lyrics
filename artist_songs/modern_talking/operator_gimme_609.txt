Angel eyes
I saw you in the classroom
Oh times go by
This world was not my home
Tears can dry
Our love is forever
But angel eyes, angel eyes
Come home, come home

Love is really hard to find
Let's go for it
Operator gimme 609
Waiting for my baby's line
Let's go for it

Oh my operator
Why can't you tell me if she's coming later
Gimme, gimme the line
Hold it to eternity
Oh my operator
Why can't you me tell if she's coming later
Gimme, gimme the line
Hold it to eternity

Angel eyes
Oh some hearts break easy
Oh angel eyes, I never cried before
Oh come back
If you ever want me
Oh angel eyes, oh angel eyes
Come home, come home
