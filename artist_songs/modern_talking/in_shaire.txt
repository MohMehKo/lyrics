You're huntin' me
In the night in your fantasy
It's a sign of the gypsy queen
Oh endless dream
You're huntin' me
I feel the need
I've never felt love so deep
Love is so dangerous
Mysterious
I try to win baby

Oh in Shaire
You won't have my love for free
You are sellin' frozen tears
Journey to my heart in fears
In Shaire
In Shaire
You will play the game with me
You are stealin' memories
My heartbeat is a lovin' beat
In Shaire

In Shaire you will try
Break the rules when I just cry
In Shaire I know
Oh your love will come and go
And I say you will take all my feelings away
In Shaire

You're huntin' me
Winnin' games of the night I see
Lovin' you is such a thrill
You make me feel
You're huntin' me
You're holdin' me
I'm lost in a lonely sea
And behind your painted smile
You're a child
Try to win baby
