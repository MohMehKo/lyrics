Oh my baby hold me, there is only you and me 
Oh I cannot wait forever, oh I cannot wait forever 
Tell me there's a heaven, and there is a destiny 
Oh I cannot wait forever, oh I cannot wait forever 
I will tell you baby, oh my love is real 
Can't you feel-my baby what I feel 

I will follow you, oh everytime and every minute 
I will follow you, see my love is true 
I will follow you, oh everytime and every minute 
All I wanna do is making love to you 

Huuuh 

There's no me without you, why an angel breaks my heart 
Oh I cannot wait forever, oh I cannot wait forever 
please send me a rainbow and we'll try a brand new start 
Oh I cannot wait forever, oh I cannot wait forever 
And beyond my tears-girl I will see your smile 
Baby I can't wait, wait a while 

I will follow you, oh everytime and every minute 
I will follow you, see my love is true 
I will follow you, oh everytime and every minute 
All I wanna do is making love to you 

I will love you 

I will follow you, oh everytime and every minute 
I will follow you, see my love is true 
I will follow you, oh everytime and every minute 
All I wanna do, you might see my love is true 

My love is true, oh so true 

I follow you
