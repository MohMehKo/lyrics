Oh baby, I swear, I'll never make you blue, mmh
Oh baby somewhere, there is a star for you, oh my love
I promised you baby, forever my love
I promised you lady, the heaven above 

So if you'll love me, for a life time
I will give you all my heart
Paintin' the clouds love, with your sunshine
Baby I will play my part, my part 

Oh lady, take care, I love you til I die, mmh
And I'll be there, when ever you will cry, oh my love
I want you, to want me, forever my love
I want you, to want me, get never enough
