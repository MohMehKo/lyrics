You are my teacher
I come to school
I love you baby
Sometimes I'm right
And then a fool
Oh be my baby
It's not a game
I play with you
Darling I know
'cause I know the golden rule

Do what you want be what you are
You're the lady of my heart
Oh come oh come to me

I was lonely
Oh so lonely
I'll never break apart
Your lovin' feeling
Your senses reelin'
You're the lady of my heart

Sometimes we win
Sometimes we lose
I love you baby
Sometimes we sin
I always choose
You're my lady
Always forgive
What I have said
Darling I know
We hold together come what may
