I watched the stars oh one by one 
why you leave me so alone 
Oh why oh why you break my heart 
I watched the stars I think of you 
Oh I'm just the biggest fool 
Oh why I let you break apart 
Oh why oh why you break my heart 

It hurts so good-to be in love 
You are the girl I'm loving for 
It hurts so good-to be in love 
Oh I need you more and more 
It hurts so good-you're in my heart 
I love you and more each day 
It hurts so good-let's try a start 
Oh baby come what may 

What's good for me,is good for you 
Oh I'll never make you blue 
Oh why oh why you break my heart 
Oh coast to coast and sky to sky 
Oh there is no reason why 
Oh why I let you break apart 
Oh why oh why you break my heart
