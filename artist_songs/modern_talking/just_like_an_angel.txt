City lights spinnin' in my head
Here comes the night can't go to bed
I'm sittin' here in that night cafe
My love don't go away
Never ending dreams of you
Lonely hours passin' through
Still missin' you
Where will you go tonight

Just like an angel you are
Hot line to heaven you're my star
Just like an angel in the night
I've seen the fire meltin' the light

Just like an angel waitin' for you
Let me down easy like angels do
You are my angel oh count on me
Gimme high high energy

'cross the streets you will telephone
Shadows dancin' still on my own
I'm sittin' here in that night cafe
My love don't go away
Cafe is empty 'n' the night goes by
A million stars shine in the sky
Still missin' you
Where will you go tonight
