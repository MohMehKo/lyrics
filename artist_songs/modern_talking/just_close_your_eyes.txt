Did I ever ever told you 
That I miss you every night 
And I cannot find my sleep girl 
If I cannot hold you tight 
Did I tell you when you left me 
There's no sun up in the sky 
And I cried so many times girl 
Just like a broken toy 
Oh I cannot stand the pain girl 
It was over, I can see 
And now you told me lady, there's a chance for you and me 

Just close your eyes-and stay with me 
There is a place-where I wanna be with you 
Just close your eyes-take me in your heart 
I will love you pretty baby, if you try a start 

Did I ever ever told you 
That I dreamt of you last night 
Is there anything I can do 
cause I wanna hold you tight 
Did I tell you I was dying 
Oh you turned away from me 
Took away my sweet sweet heaven 
And I lost my destiny 
Oh I cannot stand the pain girl 
It was over, I can see 
And now you told me baby, there's a second chance for me
