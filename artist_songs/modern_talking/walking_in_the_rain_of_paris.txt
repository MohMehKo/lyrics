Oh baby I tell I never say never (ce soir, ce soir)
I know you deserve what love just can do (ce soir, ce soir)
And this is the final call for you angel (oh angel, oh angel)
This is the final call to you 

I'm not walking in the rain of Paris
I don't promise, that I'll die for you
And I never said I wanna marrie, that is true
But Baby I swear you
My love is true 

Tonight oh I miss you like I miss the sunshine (ce soir, ce soir)
Babe you and I / we can fly / one mile high (ce soir, ce soir)
Oh don't tell a lie about me my angel (oh angel, oh angel)
And I won't tell the truth on you
