She has a heart of gold
The way to paradise is cold
I know I know
That this world is a show
Love you more than words can say
There is a will - there is a way
I know I know
That this world has a soul

I want you hey you
Feel brand-new
Oh I'll break the golden rules
Time is on my side
I want you hey you
Take a chance on me
Baby put your love on me
I want you tonight

I want you hey you
Little boo-ba-loo
You shot a hole right in my soul
Hey girl hey girl take this chance for love
I want you hey you
Little boo-ba-loo
You want me and I want you
Hey girl hey girl you're the one I'm dreamin' of

I'm tired of bein' alone
Oh girl it's easier said than done
I know I know
That this world is a show
Oh you wasted days and nights
Give me the chance for paradise
I know I know
That this world has a soul
