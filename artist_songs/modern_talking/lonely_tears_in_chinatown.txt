A broken heart a pillow filled with tears
It was hard babe hard thru all the years
Everybody needs someone to hold
Never thought that heaven can be cold
When you call me baby I'll be there
A penny for you thoughts oh take care

Lonely tears in Chinatown are too danger-dangerous
You can have his love for free
Lonely tears in Chinatown are too danger-dangerous
If you're ready go with me

His love is too too too danger too too too danger
You can have the best for me
His love is too too too danger too too too danger
Come on take the rest of me

Tonight did what it means to be so young
When two hearts are beatin' just as one
Our love can't go alone long way
There is nothing left for me to say
Nobody makes me crazy like you do
Take the star out of the sky for you

His love is too too too danger too too too danger
You can have the best for free
His love is too too too danger too too too danger
Come on take the rest of me
