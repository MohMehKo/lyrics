Let me rock you let me roll you
Take my hand
I will take you to a new star
Called a promise-land
Let me love you let me hold you
With all my heart
Trust me baby like I trust you
I did from the start
And each 'n' every day
I'm gonna always say

Let's talk about love
Love love love
That's all I'm dreamin' of
Let's talk about love
It's up to you
To make your dreams come true
Look in my eyes
There is a way
Don't throw your dreams away
You never lose
Keep love alive
Baby then our love survive

Let me rock you let me roll you
I'll be close to you
We can have a one-way trip to
Paradise for two
There is so much all can give you
I'll give all my heart
We can always be together
Never break apart
And each 'n' every day
I'm gonna always say
