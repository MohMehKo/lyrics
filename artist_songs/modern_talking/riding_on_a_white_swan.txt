Secret message for a rendezvous
Distant fire it's hurtin' you
And it's so sad good love go back
Tears of love will make me sad
Frozen teardrops runnin' with the night
Sorry doesn't always make it right
Tears of love tears in my heart
Why this love just break apart break apart

I'm riding on a white swan
I need your heart tonight
I'm riding thru a hard storm
Don't treat me like a child

Are you riding on a white swan
I got babe what you need
Are you riding on a white swan
You got the best of me

On the wings of a nightingale
Playin' games your love for sale
Then my girl belong to yesterday
Oh return don't lose your way
It's more than just the two of us
Heart is open come on trust
Love I gave for your mystic smile
Should I go or stay awhile stay awhile
