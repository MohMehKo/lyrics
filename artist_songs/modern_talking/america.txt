On Monday morning, ocean rain was falling
And Tuesday morning, many friends are calling
Wednesday alone, staying at home
Thursday, oh I wait for you
And Friday it's only one day
The weekend is coming soon 

America - oh it's Saturday night
America - lazer beams, and lights
America - people feel alright
America - let the party begin
America - oh it's like a dream
America - let's have some fun tonight 

On Monday morning, my heart feels like fire
On Tuesday evening, I can feel desire
Wednesday I'm down, spinning around
Thursday love is in my eyes
On Friday, it's only one day
To my paradise
