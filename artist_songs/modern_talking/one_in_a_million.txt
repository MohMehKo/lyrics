You are one in a million
You are one in a million
You are all of my love
You are everything for me
You are one in a million
You are one in a million
You caught me with your charms
When you held me in your arms

Oh lonely light
I hear your heartbeat deep in the night
I need you so
Know that I can't let you go
Dim all the light
And let me hold you so tight
The night is yours and mine
You're lookin' fine
Just tonight

Just like a child
You're sometimes weak sometimes you're wild
You understand
Sometimes I feel like a man
Stay here tonight
And let me hold you so tight
You are the one for me
You're all my dreams
My reality
