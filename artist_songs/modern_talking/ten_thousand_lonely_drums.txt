You're breakin' my paradise
Hearin' an echo cry
Don't be a thief who's stealin' hearts
Dreamland in night cafe
You'll never find the way
Don't be a thief for tears of love
All precious memories
You had thru the years
All they are passin' one by one
You kill the memories
With all the pain and fears
Baby together we are strong

Ten thousand lonely drums are playin' in my heart
Ten thousand drums are dreamin' feel apart
Ten thousand drums playin' just for you
Ten thousand drums are sayin' missin' you

All those drums are playin' in your mind
Take care of it 'cause love is hard to find
All those drums I'll never let you go
Take care of it and our love will grow

Like a hero I'll smile again
If you will play this game
Don't be a thief who's stealin' hearts
Light of a thousand miles
It takes a little while
Don't be a thief for tears of love
Welcome to paradise
If you will leave the lies
Then they'll be passin' one by one
You kill the memories
With all the pain and fears
Baby together we are strong
