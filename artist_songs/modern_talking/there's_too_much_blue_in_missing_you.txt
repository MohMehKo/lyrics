Like the leaves fallin' off a tree
I feel your love is dyin' for me
Ooh you tell me it's not the end
Where is the love that you're for sent

There's too much blue in missing you
I believe I was a fool
Before you said goodbye
Oh give us one more try
Yeah I can't forget
All the love we had

There's too much blue in missing you
Oh believe my heart is true
Your love's slippin' away
A little bit everyday
Throwin' away
In such an easy way

Look at me I'm lucky one
Without feelings you can't be strong
Thou I call you in the night
To hear your voice feel you deep inside
