Sometimes I feel that life's a show
But I hold tight don't let you go
'cause darling heaven can be cold
With no angel I've been told
Your memories come and memories go
But my love will always grow
Why d' you throw away my heart
Why did you break apart

Why did you do it just tonight
You're leavin' me without good-bye
Why can't you give me one more try
Before you went and said good-bye
Why did you do it just tonight

Why did you do it just tonight
We have two tickets to paradise
Nobody ever loved you more
As I always did before
Why did you do it just tonight

The way you talk the way you smile
All things you do make life worth while
It's not a game you play with me
You give this world some sanity
Your memories come and memories go
But my love will always grow
Look at the stars they're dark tonight
Be forever by my side
