Oh, Juliet is crying all the night
She doesn't know what's wrong and what is right
She packed her things and wants to leave her home
She has a broken heart and she's alone
Oh, Juliet is crying
She's crying all the night
Oh I know the love we have is right

I just can't get enough of your sweet love, my baby
Get enough of your sweet love, my lady
Get enough of your sweet love, tonight

I just can't get enough of your sweet love, my baby
Get enough of your sweet love, my lady
Baby, hold me tight

I just can't get enough of your sweet love, my baby
Get enough of your sweet love, my lady
How can we be wrong?

I just can't get enough of your sweet love, my baby
Get enough of your sweet love, my lady
Where my heart belongs

For Juliet it's just the end of time
She doesn't know that love is hard to find
But if there's anything that I can do
Oh, Juliet I'll do it just for you
Oh, Juliet is crying
She's crying all the night
Oh I know the love we have is right

I just can't get enough of your sweet love, my baby
Get enough of your sweet love, my lady
Baby, hold me tight
