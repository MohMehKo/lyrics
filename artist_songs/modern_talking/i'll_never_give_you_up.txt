Oh I'll never give you up-I'll never give you up 
I'll never give you up-my promise lasts forever 
I'll never give you up-I'll never give you up 
I'll never give you up-we tie our dreams together 

Oh baby I know, that I'm hurting you so 
But I can't stand the pain, oh I can't let you go 
Oh what are you doing the rest of your life 
Oh without your love, oh I can't survive 
I'm talking to myself-I can't let you go 
And we're gonna make it, my baby I know 

Oh I'll never give you up-I'll never give you up 
I'll never give you up-my promise lasts forever 
I'll never give you up-I'll never give you up 
I'll never give you up-we tie our dreams together 

Oh I got what I want, but I lost what I had 
A slave to your love, oh you'll drive me mad 
Oh I miss you like crazy, you're my destiny 
I'll never be so wrong, please don't say goodbye 
Oh we're gonna make it, gimme one more try
