Oh I'm so much in love, I can't live without you 
I'm so much in love - I always think of you 
Oh I'm so much in love, I can't live without you 
I' m so much in love - I always think of you 

Oh can you hear, the sound of my tears 
We have dreams, and we have fears 
Oh that's no way, my babe to say goodbye 
Give me one more chance, oh just for one more try 
And let me be in your arms again, cause my love will have no end 
Let me be in your arms again, let us walking hand in hand 

Oh I'm so much in love, I can't live without you 
I'm so much in love - I always think of you 
Oh I'm so much in love, I can't live without you

Oh why, oh why, your love can't stay 
you're turning night baby into day 
And when the night, is fallin' from the sky 
It's better babe to have you by my side 
And let me be in your arms again, cause my love will have no end 
Let me be in your arms again, let us walking hand in hand 

Oh I'm so much in love, I can't live without you 
I'm so much in love - I always think of you 
Oh I'm so much in love, I can't live without you 
I' m so much in love - I always think of you 

Always think of you - Girl you know it's true - Oh I'm missing you 
Oh anytime and anywhere 
I see your face girl, oh I swear 
I had your love, just in my eyes 
Show me the way to my paradise 
And let me be in your arms again, cause my love will have no end 
Let me be in your arms again, let us walking hand in hand
