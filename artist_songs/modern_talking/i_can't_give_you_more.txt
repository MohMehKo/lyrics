I can't give you more, I can't give you more 
I'll never find, what I'm searching for 

Oh I know,that I will die for you 
Can't you see my deep emotions 
Tears may go,but I'm lonely too 
My love is,just like the ocean 
Oh please come back to me, 
Cause I won't dying for nothing 
Oh you're not blind to see, 
oh I won't dying for nothing 

I can't give you more, I can't give you more 
(can't give, can't give) 
I'll never find, what I'm searching for 
(can't give, can't give) 
I can't give you more, I can't give you more 
(can't give, can't give) 
There's no one else, this love you can't ignore 
(can't give, can't give) 

Our love, is just a missing word 
There's two hundred ways to heaven 
It's so tough, my heart burning, oh it hurts 
Oh my babe, don't let it happen 
Oh please come back to me, 
Cause I won't dying for nothing 
Oh you're not blind to see, 
oh I won't dying for nothing
