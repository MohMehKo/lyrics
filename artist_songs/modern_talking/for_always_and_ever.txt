Do you wanna hear my story 
I know it wasn't much of glory 
Now I found someone to believe 
It's you 
You took my life 
Coloured all my lonely days 
And I'm so proud to hear you say 

For always and ever-Take it from my heart 
Take it from the start-For always and ever 
We are strong together now 

Love is a flowing of emotion 
Two hearts are living through the motions 
You will see nothing tearing us apart 
You took my life 
Coloured all my lonely days 
And I'm so proud to hear you say 

For always and ever-Take it from my heart 
Take it from the start-For always and ever 
We are strong together now 
For always and ever-Take it from my heart 
Take it from the start-For always and ever 
We are strong together now 

Love can change your life forever 
And you, you give me everything 
Everything I need 

For always and ever 
For always and ever 

For always and ever-Take it from my heart 
Take it from the start-For always and ever 
We are strong together now
