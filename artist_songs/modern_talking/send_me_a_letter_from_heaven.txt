Now you are gone, the wind cries sad
I see mysteries clouds, but you'll never come back

Lady you can trust my heart, you know
I know that the love survive
Love is all what matters girl
Love is all what matters
I'll never understand it's hard, I know
Oh god, why she lost her life
Love is all what matters girl
Love is all what matters
Down on my knees I pray for you, baby, baby
Oh girl no matters what I do 

Send me a letter from heaven, send me a letter from heaven
Do you wait for me my girl, oh oho
Send me a letter from heaven, a little letter from heaven
Wait till I will leave this world
Oh now and forever I'll swear you love is all what matters
Soon we're together, I know girl, love is all what matters 

Every night I see your smile I swear
Heaven just comes down to me
Love is all what matters, love is all what matters
Baby can't you wait a while, please dare
And we have eternity, love is all what matters girl, love is all what matters
Oh will you send a message to me, baby, baby
I know it means eternity
