C'est I'histoire de I'amour
Je t'aime
Je suis fou de toi
Je t'embrasse

I saw her eyes, like rain in may
A Paris-night, Champs-Eliyesee
A flickering light, an old cafe
Oh should I run away?
A one night stand, a small hotel
She broke my heart, heaven and hell
I was so wrong, she knew it all
Now I'm waiting for her call

Baby - I'm no rockefeller, I'm no fortune teller
I don't promise you my heart
Baby - I'm no rockefeller, baby but I tell ya
We can try a brand new start

Oh I swear to you (I swear to you)
I'll never make you blue (I make you blue)
You are always in my heart, for sure

Mon cher, qu'est-ce que tu fais avec mon coeur?
Recherche-moi je t'attendrai

I took the plane to JFK
An endless flight, I have to say
I missed that girl, more than my life
Will this love survive?
Back to the plane, to Charles De Gaulle
She was my heart, she was my soul
I know for sure, she's good to me
The rest is history

Baby - I'm no rockefeller, I'm no fortune teller
I don't promise you my heart
Baby - I'm no rockefeller, baby but I tell ya
We can try a brand new start

Oh I swear to you (I swear to you)
I'll never make you blue (I make you blue)
You are always in my heart, for sure

Mon amour
C'est I'amour de ma vie

Je cherche en toi un peu d'amour
Je t'aime mon cher

Baby - I'm no rockefeller, I'm no fortune teller
I don't promise you my heart

Oh I swear to you (I swear to you)
I'll never make you blue (I make you blue)
You are always in my heart, for sure

Je t'attendrai, mon amour
