Good guys only win in the movies
Evil women tellin' stories
There will never be another you
It's true
Down-and-out in Paris city
All the things are tough and pretty
Stay with me until the night is gone
Is gone

Just we two
Mona Lisa breaks my heart
Just we two
You're a lovely work of art

Baby just we two
You want me 'n' I want you
Baby just we two
I don't wanna lose oh you

Everybody loves a lover
Everybody's under cover
Half a million miles I'll be from home
From home
Heaven must be missin' an angel
You're the hottest child of the city
I can't ask for anymore than you
It's true

Baby just we two
I'm a first class fool
Baby just we two
All my dreams come true
