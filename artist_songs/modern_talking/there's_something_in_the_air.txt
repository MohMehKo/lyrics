There's something in the air
There's something in the air

I know, I know, your love is like the ocean
I know, for sure, your head is in the clouds, my love
Oh I know, your love, is like a sweet devotion
Baby, baby tell me, tell me, what's love is all about

There's something in the air
Oh b-b-baby, your love is so unfair
Oh b-b-baby
There's something in the air, something in the air
Baby but your love is crazy, baby I don't care

There is something in the air tonight
Baby but your love will always make it right
Baby there's something in the air tonight
Baby but your love will make it always right

This rage that lasts a thousand years
Oh I can feel it (Feel it)

There's something in the air
There's something in the air

I know we make a night, we will remember, oh no
I know we turn the night, in million days, my love
I know for sure it like summer in December
Baby, baby, nobody knows, where is the perfect way

This rage that lasts a thousand years
Oh I can, oh I can, oh I can feel it

There's something in the air
Oh b-b-baby, your love is so unfair
Oh b-b-baby
There's something in the air, something in the air
Baby but your love is crazy, baby I don't care

There is something in the air tonight
Baby but your love will always make it right
Baby there's something in the air tonight
Baby but your love will make it always right

This rage that lasts a thousand years
Oh I can feel it

There's something in the air
Oh b-b-baby, your love is so unfair
Oh b-b-baby
There's something in the air, something in the air
Baby but your love is crazy, baby I don't care

There's something in the air
There's something in the air
There's something in the air
There's something in the air
