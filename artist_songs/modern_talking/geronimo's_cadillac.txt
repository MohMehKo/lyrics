I wanna share my dreams
Wanna share with you
On the wings of love
Like dreamers do
Touch your heart
You're the queen
Of broken hearts
Oh we are daytime friends
And nighttime fools
Wanna play this game
You break the rules
Tears of love
Are frozen tears

Geronimo's cadillac is makin' all girls too mad
Geronimo has a heart oh it's a track
Geronimo's cadillac oh makin' all girls too sad
Geronimo has a heart oh it's a track

Geronimo's cadillac is tossin' oh in your head
It's tossin' and turnin' it's burnin' and makes you mad
Geronimo's cadillac oh baby I'll hold you back
You're tossin' and turnin' it's burnin' and makes you sad

I'm lookin' thru the eyes
The eyes of love
Make a fool of me
Can't get enough
Touch my heart
Boulevard
Of broken dreams
Another time for love
Other place to be
Don't let him take your love
Your love from me
Tears of love
Are frozen tears
