Oh it's now or never-it's no empty way 
I will stay forever-babe what can I say 
I miss you like crazy-where did you sleep last night 
nobody knows you baby, please stay by my side 

All I have, and all I need, and all I want is you tonight 
All I see, and all I feel, is just holding you so tight 
All I miss, and all I dream, and all I want is your sweet love 
All I know, and all I say, is that I can't get enough 

My love is getting stronger-my love is here to stay 
I can't wait no longer-baby make my day 
Oh tonight I'm lonely-so lonely without you 
Know that you're the only-and my heart is true 

All I miss is you, wherever I go, I miss you and I need you
