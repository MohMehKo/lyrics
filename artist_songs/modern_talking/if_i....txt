All friends are gone-my heart it burns like fire
When the night comes falling, falling from the sky
I was so wrong-how could I loose my desire
How many times can we say goodbye
Love is a sacrifice
You have to read between the lies

If I'll never see the sun again
If I'll never have your helping hand
If I'll never see a children smile
My world is lost
If we don't try

I'm so alone-i cannot stand it forever
Sometimes I feel-like I can't stand the pain
All that I want-we can't do it together
Only with you-I feel like I'm born again
No matter what I do
I do it baby just for you
