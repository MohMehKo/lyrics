I hear your heartbeat heartbeat heartbeat
Playin' with my mind
Oh I need you wrapped around me just
Like I'd be on a vine
But now I'm only lonely lonely
Holdin' on to you
Oh I need you back here with me yeah
I think you want it too
Now I'll fill you with a new emotion
Heal you when you cry
I'll be your loving doctor of the night

Do you wanna take me tonight
Do you wanna make midnight
Do you wanna if you wanna
Take what you need

Do you wanna make it alright
Do you wanna have once your night
Oh baby do you wanna if you wanna
Take what you need

I hear your heartbeat heartbeat heartbeat
Beggin' me for more
Oh I need you hear that question
Like a dancer need a floor
And now you're only only only
Holdin' on to me
Oh now tell me that you're comin' back
One word is all I need
Now I'll fill you with a new emotion
Heal you when you cry
I'll be your loving doctor of the night
