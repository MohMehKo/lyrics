Every little moment oh she dreams of you
Half a million miles of love come true
How can you mend all the heartaches you've made
What is easy for two it's so hard for one
What is gonna happen when the summer's gone
How can you mend all the heartaches you've made
Baby how can you mend all the heartaches you've made

Someone is breakin' Angie's heart
A powdered thing called love
He's breakin' Angie's heart
Her heart her heart

Someone is breakin' Angie's heart
One night is not enough
Everybody got to believe in someone
Ooh Angie

Angie there will never be another you
If it doesn't fit that your dreams come true
How can he mend all the heartaches he's made
Tears of love you wasted for this love affair
And this love will really hurt you oh take care
How can he mend all the heartaches he's made
Baby how can he mend all the heartaches he's made
