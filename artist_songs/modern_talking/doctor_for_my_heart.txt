Babe how can you mend a broken heart
Oh you're tearin' me apart
Thousand drums play in my mind
Take it off him put it on me
Oh I'm feelin' so lonely
And I'm holdin' back my spleen

I don't wanna a doctor for my heart
Oh I wanna try a brand-new start
I don't wanna a doctor for my heart
Oh I wanna commander of my love

I don't wanna a doctor for my
Lonely heartache
My heart believes your love beat lady
Come take a chance of love

I can't give you anything but love
Take these chains from your heart
Thousand dreams play in my mind
Babe harder I try bluer I get
Don't put my love in a dirty bag
Until it ends there is no end

I don't wanna a doctor for my heart
Oh I wanna try a brand-new start
I don't wanna a doctor for my heart
I don't wanna commander of my love

I don't wanna a doctor for my
Lonely heartache
My heart believes your love beat lady
Come take a chance of love

I don't wanna oh I wanna

I don't wanna a doctor for my heart
Oh I wanna try a brand-new start
Oh I wanna a doctor for my heart
I don't wanna come on 'n' love
