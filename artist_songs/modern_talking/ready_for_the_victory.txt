You're in our heart 
Just from 'round the land 
You will be the champion 
Give it back to the crowd 
Like a fireball 
You never, never give up 
Hear the engine calm 
Waiting for the start 

Can't you see 
You're ready for the victory 
Its clear you're the hero just for you and me 
I feel we're in the poleposition team
Can't you see 
It's like a dream 

From Australia to USA
And from Italy to Germany 
And from San Marino to Canada 
He is our biggest star 

Oh you can not lose 
If you have a lucky hand 
You will be the hero 
You have many friends 
This we can not buy 
You will win again 
Nobody does it better 
For passion and through pain

Can't you see 
You're ready for the victory 
It's clear
You're  the hero just for you and me 
I feel 
You're in the poleposition team
Can't you see 
It's like a dream 

From Australia to USA
And from Italy to Germany 
And from San Marino to Canada 
He is our biggest star 

You're ready for the victory 
You're a hero just for you and me 
We're in the poleposition team 
Can't you see 
It's like a dream 

From Australia to USA
And from Italy to Germany 
And from San Marino to Canada 
He is our biggest star
