Oh I walked through the party in the disco light
Saturday is calling and I'm feeling alright
And I get tired of being alone
She has my heart, but she has no home
And I try, try, try it again
Buy her a drink, wanna be her man
High-Low (High and low) - Oh, my baby - Come let's go

Oh, Ju - Juliet 
All the things you do - they drive me mad
Ju-Ju-Ju-Ju-Juliet
Baby, I can't get you out of my head
I love the nightlife - the crazy nightlife - in the discolight, baby
I love the nightlife - the crazy nightlife
Keep on dancing, lady

And we walked to my house - it was late at night
Sunday was calling - see the morning light
And I get tired of being with this girl
She's so complicated - doesn't fit in my world
And I try and try to send her home
Call to a taxi, wanna be alone
High-Low (High and low) - Oh, my baby - Oh please go
