Feeling lonely drifting through the day
Was so sad and then I walked away
I feel the disillusion
Headless of confusion baby

What you did and that you lied to me
I'm old enough and not too blind to see
We walk through different doors now
We sail on different shores oh baby

All I can say is that
I love to love you
From the bottom of my
Broken lonely heart
All I can say is that I 
Need to need you
I feel down feel high and
Then I fall apart

Remember all the times we had
Makes me feeling down and feeling sad
Need time to rediscover
Can I still be your lover baby>

I have the courage you will see it's true
Living my life I don't need you
Even my heart is burning
Even it is yearning baby

All I can say is that
I love to love you
