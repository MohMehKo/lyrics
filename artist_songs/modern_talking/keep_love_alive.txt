Bittersweet you wasted years
Lonely dream about souvenirs
Babe touch a hand
Make a friend tonight
Bittersweet love has no pride
Try again time's on your side
Oh strange are the ways of love
Come on and take my heart
It's breaking just apart

Keep love alive
Two hearts to hold it
Keep love alive
Too hard to stop it

Keep love fire burning in your heart
Forever and ever
Keep love fire burning from the start
Forever together

Bittersweet so high so low
Lonely dreamer life's a show
Oh touch a hand
Make a friend tonight
Bittersweet more than words can say
If a woman wants to play
Oh strange are the ways of love
Come on and take my heart
It's breaking just apart
