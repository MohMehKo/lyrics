Hold me darling you know that I really really love you...

Oh lady oh lady my heart is cryin'
Can't only beg keep on tryin'
You went out of there
Your love don't live here anymore

Oh let me oh let me explain
Love don't live here anymore
Oh let me oh let me explain
Love don't live here anymore

Trouble stole my paradise world
Our love just lies
Look what you have done to me my love (my love)
You can't steal when beg my heart
Love can find the way
Got my love lyin' in your hands oh
Still I can't explain
Why you went away
So I ask again
Have you gone or stay
I feel just the same
Love might come again
In motion in motion

Oh lady oh lady my one and only
You've been gone I'm feelin' so lonely
You went out of there
Your love don't live here anymore

Oh let me oh let me explain
Love don't live here anymore

Hold me darling you know that I really really love you

Could I ever love you more babe
Than I did before
See you thru the eyes of love my love (my love)
I gave everything I could you
Where to fly to see
But my love is still for you babe
Still I can't explain
Why you went away...
