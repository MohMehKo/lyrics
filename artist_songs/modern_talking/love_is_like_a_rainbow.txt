When I look into your eyes 
I can see a part of heaven 
Never felt the way like before 
In my life 
Love shines in many colours 
Love is shining for us 
Believe me 
That my love is real 

Love is like a rainbow 
Love will lift you up and let you down 
The light behind the shadow 
Will tell you 
That I'll never go 
If you see a rainbow in the sky 
I will promise that you'll never cry again 
Those tears from heaven 

Every hour every minute 
I will touch you I will feel it 
Always looking for someone like you,all my life 
I cover you with sunlight 
I take your hand and hold tight 
If raindrops 
Will darken the sky 

We know that rainbows come and go 
But our love won't slip away
