You're walkin' like an angel in heaven
In the night I see an angel in you
In my lonely dreams I count to seven
And I call you babe you know that it's true
When you're young and in love
It's too hard to stop
Young and in love
You never give up

Only love can break my heart
It's tearin' me apart
No I'll never feel brand-new
Only love can break my heart
Playin' this so hard
Nobody loves me like you do

Only love can break my heart
It's time to make a start
Babe I love you without end
Only love can break my heart
You'll make it if you start
Baby take me as your friend

Your feelings are tossin' and turnin'
You have to learn to pay the right price
Your lonely heart keeps on burnin'
But an angel will hear many lies
When you're young and in love
It's too hard to stop
Young and in love
You can never give up
