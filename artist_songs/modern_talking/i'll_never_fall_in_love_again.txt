Heaven is for every one
If you're old or if you're young
Baby you can't kiss the past goodbye
When I saw her in the night cafe
Just near by the Champs-Elys'e
She looked so sad, she breaks my heart
She told me she will take the car
And drive to an unknown star
She falls in love with someone else not me
And I know my tears will never dry
When I heard her say just goodbye
I never said she guilty, guilty for my love 

I'll never fall in love again
I never fall in love again
I will never give my heart away
Til my life will end
Baby, never fall in love again
Never fall in love again
There will never be another you
Girl please understand 

It takes a woman, to make a man
Sometimes it's hard to understand
She took my heart away and let me go
And I'm too shy to let her know
She's like a rose in the snow
I wanna be her sunshine
The sunshine to her life
I never knew heaven could speak
But in my heart, there is a deep
There's a deep deep feeling just for you
And I know this tears will never dry
When I heard her say, just goodbye
I never said she guilty, guilty for my love
