A heart of gold, and she's alone
Garden Eden is her home
She's like a storm, she's like a star
You think she's Near, but she's so far
She's like the sun in wintertime
She's hard to find 

She's the witchqueen of Eldorado
High on the mountain, heya heya heya hoh
For the freedom in Eldorado
She's the fountain, heya heya heya hoh
She's the witchqueen of Eldorado
Lady of fire - heya heya heya heya hoh
And she's fighting for Eldorado
With her desire - heya heya heya heya hoh 

She's justified in wounded knee
Some lies are true, oh can't you see
Follow the sun and you will find
A secret room, just in your mind
Let's make this world a better place
For the human race

Dreams are flying like an eagle
To the orinoco flow
From the desert of Eldorado
To the east-coast, yes I know
