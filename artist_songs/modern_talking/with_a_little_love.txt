They said oh yeah it's a tough world
You are restless and you are young
I said oh girl it's a good world
And your time will come
Your time will come
They said you came from the wrong side
He's a page from the end of the book
I said you came from the right side
Took me just one look
Then you understood

With a little love you will survive
With a little love you will get by
Do what you want go your own way
'cause it's your life

With a little love you make the start
Yeah why lovers break each other's heart
Do what you want go your own way
'cause it's your life

They said no future forget it
You came from the wrong side of town
I said don't listen don't let it
Let it bring you down
Make you wear a frown
They said oh let him down easy
Left at the hearts you have won
I said that love is for livin'
Like the morning sun
It had just begun
