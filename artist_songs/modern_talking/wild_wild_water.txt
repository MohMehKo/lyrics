Be quiet... be quiet...

Sail across the universe
All the magic here on earth
Slippin' in the sliding
Rollin' in the riding to you my love
Summer breeze reminded me
Love was wild oh love was free
Memories you're hidin'
Babe you'll come a ridin' to me

Wild wild water
Brings me back to you
Over and over
Wild wild water
Babe still missin' you
Over and over

Wild wild water
Free as the wind in the summer sky
Wild wild water
Expect the love that just won't die

Be quiet... be quiet...

Silver water reeve me tight
Rings that go back to my sight
Slippin' in the sliding
Rollin' in the riding to you my love
You'll be comin' back some day
True I'd want it come what may
Memories you're hidin'
Babe you'll come a ridin' to me
