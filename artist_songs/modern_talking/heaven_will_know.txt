When I'm down and feelin' blue
I close my eyes so just to be with you
I'm a dreamer and you know
You are my woman and I'll never go
God put an angel here on Earth
Who gave me more than all I'm worth
You are my angel in the night
In the darkness you're the light

Heaven will know
Oh heaven will know
My love will grow baby
Heaven will know
That I need you so
I can't say good-bye lady

Heaven will know
That I'll never let go
'n' I'll stay until my heart stands still
No matter what baby
Be what you are
Heaven send me an angel
Heaven send me a star

Don't let me down take my hand
Now 'n' forever be my friend
Take my lovin' heart tonight
You are a woman till the morning light
I'll dry the tears I've never shown
And empty house I call my own
You are my angel in the night
In the darkness you're the light

And it's more than impressive face
And it's more than a few nice days
And it's more than I've never known
And I'll never be alone
