Oh everyday and just everynight
I see your face babe on my laptop screen
You're high and low and just between
Oh everyday and just everynight
I send an e-mail to the dream factory
I asked if you're reality
But more and more I like you more than just before

Oh la da die, oh la da da
Only a vision, mrs. robota
Oh, oh, oh la da die, oh la da da
Only a computer, without a heart
Oh Mrs. Robota - just a fantasy can't break my heart
Mrs. Robota - only a fiction, right from the starts
It's impossible

Oh every morning, when I wake up
I push the bottom for a brand new game
Can't live without you, it's a shame
I hear your voice, and I see your face
I can't beleve, oh babe you blow my mind
There is no answer, I can find
And more and more I like you more than just before
