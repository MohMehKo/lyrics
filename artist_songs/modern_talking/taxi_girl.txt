Oh never say never, if you want to be clever, I'll die for you 
And always and ever, we're staying together, oh that is true 
I'm tossing and turning, cause my heart is burning 
Tell me your heart will go on 
And if you will be clever, it's always and ever, I'll die for you 

Be my taxi taxi girl 
In my secret taxi world 
Be my taxi taxi girl 
It's a strange and secret world 
Taxi taxi lady, just for one day 
Girl don't make me crazy, oh come what may 
Sexy taxi lady, miss you tonight 
Girl don't make me crazy, stay by my side 

Oh never say never, this time it's forever, I'll die for you 
How deep is the ocean, I'll show you devotion, I'll cry for you 
I'm getting much stronger, I can't wait no longer 
Tell me this love will go on 
And if you will be clever, it's always and ever, I'll die for you
