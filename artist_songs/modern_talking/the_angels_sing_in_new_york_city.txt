See all the stars are fine tonight
And the old nightingale is flyin' tonight
To my dreams
Hear all the birds are quiet tonight
And Titanic is callin' an echo of love
To your dreams
And it hurts so much
But I have to go
Oh it hurts so much
'cause you have to know

And the angel sings in New York City
Do what I wanna do
And the angel sings his song so pretty
Baby I'm missin' you

Do you hear that
Hey it's easy albatross
Do you feel that
Hey man in the stars above
Do you need that
Titanic echo of love

I'm half a million miles from home
And the fire in mountains ain't comin' tonight
To my dreams
Don't let the stars get in your eyes
And a lonely dreamer is cryin' tonight
In your dreams
And it hurts so much
But I have to go
Oh it hurts so much
'cause you have to know
