Stay I wanna be your man
Please stay you need a helpin' hand
Tonight I'm fallin' in love in love
Stay I love your Chinese eyes
Please stay 'cause you're a big surprise
Tonight I'm fallin' in love in love

Oh Lady Lai
The time when you touch me
I'll love you till eternity
Oh ever I'll be
Your lovin' guy
Be here tonight
Oh Lady Lai
Oh please come stay with me
By the light of the magical moon
Later or soon
I'll be your guy
Be here tonight

Hey you're like a butterfly
Oh stay oh give my love a try
Tonight I'm fallin' in love in love
Stay I wanna be your man
I feel I'll never feel again
Tonight I'm fallin' in love in love
