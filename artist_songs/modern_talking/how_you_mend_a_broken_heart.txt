Somewhere there is a chance for me
I said to my friends, my family
It's a long and lonely road to Southern Chelsea
And somewhere there's a love for me
I want to find my own reality
It's a long and lonely road to Southern Chelsea
Tell me there's a Heaven, I know that it's no dream
Sometimes I'm high and low girl and sometimes in between

Tell me how you mend a broken heart
I don't wanna be a lonely liar
Tell me how I find a brand new start
I will never be a heart survivor
I will make my dreams come true
I will try, oh just for me and you

That's all or nothing forever girl
I said goodbye to my old old world
It's a long and lonely road to Southern Chelsea
And somewhere, thousand miles away
I'll find my life but I have to say
It's a long an' lonely road to Southern Chelsea
I will find my Heaven, I'm halfway to my dream
And I see a tiny river like in an old old movie scene

Tell me how you mend a broken heart
I don't wanna be a lonely liar
Tell me how I find a brand new start
I will never be a heart survivor
I will make my dreams come true
I will try, oh just for me and you

Tell me how you mend a broken heart
I don't wanna be a lonely liar
Tell me how I find a brand new start
I will never be a heart survivor
I will make my dreams come true
I will try, oh just for me and you

You can mend my broken heart
