Oh I can't give you more
Than my lonely heart
Oh take me as I am
But don't break apart
I wanna hold you baby
I won't let you go
And everyday and everynight
Oh I miss you so

Oh when the night comes falling
Falling from the sky
I hear my heart is calling
For another try
I wanna hold you baby, I won't let you go
And everyday and everynight, oh I miss you so

I'm gonna be strong
I know my baby, we can't go wrong
I'm gonna be strong my baby
I'm gonna be strong for you baby
I'm gonna hold on to you darling
I'm gonna be strong for you baby
I'm gonna hold on to my love

This night is gone forever
Till the end of time
Why can't we stay together
You're always on my mind
I wanna stay with you love, I can't let you go
And anytime and anywhere, oh I miss you so
