Rouge et Noir

Someday we're together, tonight's gone forever 
The night, just comes falling, your heart it is calling 
Oh I know and I swear, I always will be there 
There is you and me, baby can't you see

Rouge et Noir, Rouge et Noir 
Be the lady of my heart 
Rouge et Noir, Rouge et Noir 
Oh I'll never tear apart 
Rouge et Noir, you'll break my heart 
Oh this love is so bizarre 
Rouge et Noir, don't break apart 
Be the lady of my heart, oh

Rouge et Noir

I know you are lonely, I swear you're the only 
You said, you remember, the day of September 
When I gave you my love, baby I was dreaming of 
That you're here with me, baby can't you see

Rouge et Noir, Rouge et Noir 
Be the lady of my heart 
Rouge et Noir, Rouge et Noir 
Oh I'll never tear apart 
Rouge et Noir, you'll break my heart 
Oh this love is so bizarre 
Rouge et Noir, don't break apart 
Be the lady of my heart, oh

Rouge et Noir
