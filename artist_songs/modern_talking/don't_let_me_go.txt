Don't let me go, little darling
Oh no no no no no, little darling.
Don't let me go, little darling
Oh no no no no no, little darling.

I was having problems,
Dancing stiff as a board,
My moves that used to wow them
Now they just seem flawed.
Then you told me something
That I knew to be true
When you said I was a robot
Made me feel denim blue.

Can't let you go, little Jeannie
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, little Jeannie.
Can't let you go, little Jeannie
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, little Jeannie.

You came to my rescue
I always knew that you could
Gave me Comfort, freshness too
I no longer felt like wood.
I felt it down in my fibres
Softness went so deep
Your loving act of kindness
Made my cloth heart leap.

Shaking you off, little Sandy
Oh please, please, please, please, please, little Sandy.
Shaking you on, little lightning
Oh please, please, please, please, please, little lightning.

You can take it from a cloth boy
You know, I am convinced
It's the best I've ever felt
And it only took one rinse!
Now I'm good as ever
Comfort put me right
In fact, I'm even better
'Cos I'm rockin' the house tonight!

Don't let me go, little darling
Oh no no no no no, little darling.
Don't let me go, little darling
Oh no no no no no, little darling.

Don't let me go, little darling
Oh no no no no no, little darling.
Don't let me go, little darling
Oh no no no no no, little darling.

Don't let me go, little darling
Oh no no no no no, little darling.
Don't let me go, little darling
Oh no no no no no, little darling.
