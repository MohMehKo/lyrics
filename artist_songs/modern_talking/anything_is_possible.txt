Stay, please stay with me tonight 
And all the stars up in my heaven 
They're shining bright 

Oh anything is possible 
I know it-if you stay 
Oh I will catch you if you fall, oh baby baby 

I know it hurts, but it hurts me more and more 
I hear your heartbeat baby, louder than before 
And when I cry, I cry for you 
Cause I know you are the only 
And when I die, I die for you 
Cause I know your heart is lonely 

Oh anything is possible 
I know it-if you stay 
I will catch you if you fall, oh baby baby 
Oh anything is possible 
Oh I know it from my heart 
I will try-oh if you call 
Don't leave me girl, don't leave me here tonight 
(Oh I'm so lonely) 
Don't leave me girl and all the feeling's right 
(Oh you're the only) 

I know it hurts you, you are walking out my dreams 
You set my heart on fire and now you're gone it seems 
My dying heart, it cries for you 
Cause I know you are my only 
Don't break apart, can't let you go 
Cause I know my heart's lonely
