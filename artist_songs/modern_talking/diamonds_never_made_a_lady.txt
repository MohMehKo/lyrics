Oh my heart is cryin' in the night for you
Oh my God oh don't you feel like a fool
You're foolin' yourself with a millionaire
You think it's love but he don't care
And one of these days you're gonna be surprised

Diamonds never made a lady
Lover or a friend I know it
Diamonds never made a lady
Oh your dreams will end I know it

Your California nights
Oh money held you tight
It was just a dream
Come on don't tell me lies
Give me the peaceful nights
Your sweet dreams

Oh my God you really think you have it made
Your heart is one with first-class expensive paint
You drink champagne in cadillac
A color-tv in a back of your car
But one of these days you're gonna be surprised
