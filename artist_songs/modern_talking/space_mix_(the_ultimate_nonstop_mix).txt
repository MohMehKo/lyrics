Roger, roger. Calling, calling, roger, roger, can you read me?
78-78-9, 78-78-9, do you read me? Roger, major!
This is Modern Talking spaceship 1998,
We need authorization to land.
Major, major? Landing co-ordinations.
We are now ten seconds from touchdown.
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
Engage go for landing.
Keepin' the chance of rain calling cloudy skies,
But we're gonna see if we can make the sun shine anyway.
Right here on a station that pays,
If you want the hits, the whole hits,
And nothing but the hits... on your FM dial, keep it right here, baby.
Modern Talking! 'Cheri Cheri Lady'!
And it goes down...  like that.  Come on!
Oh, I can't explain
Every time it's the same
Oh I feel that it's real
Take my heart
I've been lonely to long
Oh, I can't be so strong
Take the chance for romance, take my heart
I need you so
There's no time I'll ever go
Cheri, cheri lady
Going through a motion
Love is where you find it
Listen to your heart
Cheri, cheri lady
Living in devotion
It's always like the first time
Let me take a part
Cheri, cheri lady
Like there's no tomorrow
Take my heart - don't lose it
Listen to your heart
Cheri, cheri lady
To know you is to love you
If you call me baby I'll be always yours
The lady of my life is out o' really feeling.
The real deal, giving you nothing but sex-appeal.
You steal my mind, I love the way you do me,
Break it down to the sound of 'Brother Louie'.
...Brother Louie!..
Dear, love is a burning fire
Stay, cause then the flames grow higher
Babe, don't let him steel your heart
It's easy, it's easy
Girl, this game can't last forever
Why? We can not live together
Try, don't let him take your love from me
You're not good, can't you see brother Louie, Louie, Louie
I'm in love set you free
Oh, she's only looking to me
Only love breaks her heart brother Louie, Louie, Louie
Only love's paradise
Oh, she's only looking to me
Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
Oh, she's only looking to me
Oh, let it Louie
She's undercover
Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
Oh, doing what he's doing
So, leave it Louie
Cause I'm a lover
Check it out, check it out, here we go, let me say it.
Tax on wax make the brothers wanna play it.
To the front, to the front, to the back, to the back,
To the hip, to the hop, to the rhyme, to the rap.
Every single line out o'da time you admire,
Stays in your brain like earth, within a fire.
I take you higher, fairly you desire,
I'm not a liar, I roll like a tyre!
You packed your things in a carpetbag
Left and never looking back
Rings on your fingers, paint on your toes
Music wherever you go
You don't fit in a smalltown world
But I feel you're the girl for me
Rings on your fingers, paint on your toes
You're leaving town where nobody knows
You can win if you want
If you want it, you will win
On your way you will see that life is more than fantasy
Take my hand, follow me
Oh, you've got a brand new friend for your life
You can win if you want
If you want it you will win
Oh, come on, take a chance for a brand new wild romance
Take my hand for the night
And your feelings will be right hold me tight
98.7 on your FM dial! You're listening to Modern Talking,
And this is "Doctor for my heart"!
Babe, how can you mend a broken heart?
Oh, you're tearing me apart
Thousand drums play in my mind
Take, it off him put it on me
Oh, I'm feeling so lonely
And I'm holding back my tears
Come on!
I don't wanna a doctor for my heart
Oh, I wanna try a brand new start
I don't wanna a doctor for my heart
Oh, I wanna a commander of my love
I don't wanna a doctor for my lonely heartache
My heart bleeds - love me lady
Come, take a chance on love
Watch out - (it's) 5:30 in the morning,
Get out of bed and then I join in.
Straight to the bathroom to wash my face,
To my surprise - there's no toothpaste.
I wanna share my dreams
Wanna share with you
On the wings of love
Like Dreamers do
Touch your heart -
You've the grip of broken heart
Oh we are daytime friends and nightime fools
Wanna play this game
You break the rules
Tears of love are frozen tears
Geronimo's Cadillac

Geronimo has a heart - Oh it's a drag
Geronimo's Cadillac
Oh making all girls too sad
Geronimo has a heart - Oh it's a drag
Geronimo's Cadillac It's tossing oh in your head
It's tossing and turning

Watch good love go bad
Smoke from a distance
Fire burning me
Oh, babe, the heaven can't wait
I need these hints
I'm feeling.....My heart is appealing

Outside the gates of heaven
Oh, there lives a unicorn
I close my eyes to seven
Oh, this world is not my home
A broken heart in danger
And a pillow filled with tears
Oh, can you see the strangers?
In the pain and in the fears
Can you feel my heart?
Baby don't give up
Can you feel my love tonight?
In 100 years
Love is illegal
In 100 years from now
In 100 years
Love is illegal in this lonely, heartbreak town
In 100 years
Love is illegal
All your dreams will die
In 100 years
Love is illegal
And your hope will not survive
L.O.V.E.
Love is illegal for all
Can u hear my heart is beating
L.O.V.E.
Love is illegal in my heart
Can you Hear my heart is beating
Well, a-hip, a-hop, a-hippi to the hippi,
The hip hip the hop and you don't stop, and rock them
To the bang-bang-boogie, say up join the boogie
To the rhythm of the boogie the beat.
Now what you hear is a modern sound, and we're rockin' to the beat.
Now all you gotta do is pump the sound, and move your funky feet!
The times were hard and I was running
I could feel my chance was coming
Another time, another place
A pillow filled with frozen tears
See the gates, a distant fire
Shows the way, to my desire
Laying down my heart for you
Cause I'm lonely, feelin' blue
I know that I'll never die on love
But I'll never get enough
Oh, I got no time to lose
On my avenue to a jet airliner
Avenue to my broken dreams
My avenue to a jet airliner
Like an old old movie-scene
My avenue to a jet airliner
Brings me back to the dreams I loved
Good guys only win in movies
But this time babe I'll get enough
Jam it on the station that plays! You know how it goes,
Baby, the all day, everyday,
We're jammin' it live right here in the studio with Modern Talking.
'98 remix, "You're my heart, you're my soul" and all of that,
Baby, and much much more on your FM dial.
Love is a lie
Love is a mess
Telling the secrets of loneliness
Our love survive
Our love survive
Letters are written
Words are spoken
Some hearts are better left unbroken
How will love survive
How will love survive
Little by little, step by step
We will kill the dirty heads
Heart to heart and side by side
Love will never hide
Locomotion tango on a lonely rainbow
We will dancin' baby
Don't wait for heroes
Locomotion tango on a lonely rainbow
We will dancin' baby
Romancin' lady
Locomotion in my heart
See you dancin' in the darkness
Locomotion let us start
Let us dancin' in the moonlight
Kick it!
