I'm on a long and winding road now
Only guided by the stars
All that I carry are my hopes now
Secret whispers in the dark

Rising form the ground
Bringing down the curtains
Standing tall and proud
My heart is burning
'Cause there you are, there you are
I can hear the love so loud

I've been trying to move on
Though I know you're the only one
Cause as I let go, let go, let go, let go of you
There's an echo, echo, echo, echo of you
Ride in the starlight
To forget what it feels like
But as I let go, let go, let go, let go of you
There's an echo, echo, echo, echo of you

They say I lost myself in blind love
Chasing dreams across the blue
But no matter what I can't forget us
Traveling to the sound of you

Rising form the ground
Bringing down the curtains
Standing tall and proud
My heart is burning
'Cause there you are, there you are
I can hear the love so loud

I've been trying to move on
Though I know you're the only one
Cause as I let go, let go, let go, let go of you
There's an echo, echo, echo, echo of you
Ride in the starlight
To forget what it feels like
But as I let go, let go, let go, let go of you
There's an echo, echo, echo, echo of you

I've been trying to move on
Though I know you're the only one
Cause as I let go, let go, let go, let go of you
There's an echo, echo, echo, echo
