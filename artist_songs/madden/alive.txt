Tonight I'm losing my layers
I'm letting you know
So won't you come back into me where you belong
Losing my layers, I'm letting you know
So won't you come back into me where you belong
Won't you come back into me where you belong

All we ever wanted is to feel alive
Bathing in moonlight and the time's so right
We all share this moment and the red sunrise
So just hold on tight in this walk of life

All we ever wanted is to feel alive
Bathing in moonlight and the time's so right
We all share this moment and the red sunrise
So just hold on tight in this walk of life

Tonight I'll breath in the future
And tear down my walls
So we can let every single barrier fall
Losing my layers, I'm letting you know
So won't you come back into me where you belong
Won't you come back into me where you belong

All we ever wanted is to feel alive
Bathing in moonlight and the time's so right
We all share this moment and the red sunrise
So just hold on tight in this walk of life

Alive, alive, alive
All we ever wanted is to feel alive
Alive, alive, alive
All we ever wanted is to feel alive
