We met a summer night
And I held you tight in the golden light
And ever since that time
I've been burning bright, a fire deep inside

I just wanna feel your love, I need your love
Wake me back to life
Give me, give me one more night
And I'll hold you tight in the golden light
In the golden light, in the golden light
In the golden light, in the golden light

I just wanna feel your love
I just wanna feel your love
We met a summer night
And I held you tight in the golden light
And ever since that time
I've been burning bright a fire deep inside
I just wanna feel your love
I just wanna feel your love
I just wanna feel your love

You were my only one and we've had some fun
To the jungle drums
But now the stakes are gone and I'm dancing on
In the summer sun

I just wanna feel your love, I need your love
Wake me back to life
Give me, give me one more night
And I'll hold you tight in the golden light
In the golden light, in the golden light
In the golden light, in the golden light

I just wanna feel your love
I just wanna feel your love
We met a summer night
And I held you tight in the golden light
And ever since that time
I've been burning bright a fire deep inside
I just wanna feel your love
I just wanna feel your love
I just wanna feel your love
