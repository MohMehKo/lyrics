Just to get by try to stay high it's a good life end of discussion hours like sand
Holes in my hand I'm a good soul,
Martyr me
Wasting my life it's passing me by it's a good fight throw in the towel
The hours I've spent aren't enough to pay rent I'm just sinking water deep

But if all I have is defeat

Tonight if you're awake at all
Tonight if you're awake
Tonight if you're awake at all
Tonight if you're awake

Case of my crime a lack of my time it's a roadblock need a catharsis
Patience is spent a virtue I sent to the basement far from me
The less that I spend on the mess that I'm in could be used towards something of value
The time on my side isn't anything I've ever needed can't you see?

That all I have is defeat

Tonight if you're awake at all
Tonight if you're awake
Tonight if you're awake at all
Tonight if you're awake

Every unsuspecting scene when we're supposed to make believe that we're not tearing at the seams,
We hang on, we hang on, we hang on

Tonight if you're awake at all
Tonight if you're awake
Tonight if you're awake at all
Tonight if you're awake

Tonight if you're awake at all
Tonight if you're awake
Tonight if you're awake at all
Tonight if you're awake
