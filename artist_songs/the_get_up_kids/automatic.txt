The kid's alone just watching static
The circuit's blown
It's just a habit
No, he's not an addict

When all was still, his mind's erratic
Say what you will
It's so traumatic
Yeah, it's automatic

He wants to lead a life so tragic
The therapy
Is just a habit
No, he's not an addict

Hang up the phone it's time to panic
The bird has flown
He's so dramatic
Yeah it's automatic

So tell me what you wanna believe
Cause this is like a dream
I'm watching you walk all over me
It's automatic
It's automatic
It's automatic
It's automatic
It's automatic
It's automatic

The kid's alone it's time to panic
The circuit's blown
It's just a habit
Yeah it's automatic
So tell me what you wanna believe
Cause this is like a dream
I'm watching you walk all over me
It's automatic
It's automatic
It's automatic
