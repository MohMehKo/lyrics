come tomorrow i'll be on my way back home
in the morning call from a roadside telephone
one night doesn't mean the rest of my life
if i go it's not impossible but possible is probably wrong
so, let go because i'm afraid to try
keep my hands by my side
i won't come back
i hope someday you'll understand i want to try 
and make it right but dont' know if i can
last night everything was right and the reain was gone
one summer night's the only time we've known
shut your eyes and when you wake i'll be gone
