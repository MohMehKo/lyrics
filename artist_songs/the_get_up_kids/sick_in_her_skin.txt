Baby Deleilah 
Sick in her skin 
Out on the highway livin for nothing
It's the same old song again
And since she defends 
On the moon and on forever she said 
You should still be here

Hooks in her toungue
Escape if you can 
Clear out the room 
I'll open the window 
I'll fly in 
Blood on the table
She made up her mind 
All of the talks we had were for nothing 
But I'd shine 

It's overwhelming
And since she defends
On and on forever she says
It's all over now 
It's all over now 
It's all over now 
It's all over now. 

On and on and on forever, she says.
