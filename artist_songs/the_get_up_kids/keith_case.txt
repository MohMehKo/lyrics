You'll turn away
Calling back
As you run
Say it can
It can
It can be done
You're the last continental bastard chosen son

It may be a while
Maybe two
Maybe three
Till the chance
Till the chance
Till the chance we meet
Just to burn all the frames as to not repeat

Like anyone anywhere has the time
Take your place
Take a place
Take a place in line
I can spot a scab
I know my kind

I wanna say
Truly say
Know this well
Look how far
Look how far
Look how far we fell
You can lie to the liar
I know you'll tell

Turn around turn around
Say what you wanna say
Say what you came here for
Turn away turn away
From everything we want to wash
And anything that came before

You'll turn away
Calling back
As you run
Say it can
It can
It can be done
You're the last continental bastard chosen son

Turn around turn around
Say what you wanna say
Say what you came here for
Turn away turn away
From everything we want to wash
And anything that came before
