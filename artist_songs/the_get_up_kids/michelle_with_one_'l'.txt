same hold from the same hands
five years strong
many times over and gone
it's everything that i have to beat bridges much stronger and wide
fewer and farther between we meet againg
i'll try to do well on my own
distance between's never been this far
i realize that this time was something that i always knew
only a fool wouldn't see
might as well start my drinking days now if i'm really alone
it's tempting
am i asking too much to keep you at arms length?
am i asking too much to keep you at home?
please don't go
i know it's all gonna be fine and i know that this is what's right
