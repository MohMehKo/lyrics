I'll fawn over photographs
That you never would get to see
Swallow your own neglect
With your miserable company

Your daughter forgot her memories
Your daughter forgot her
Remember these

I'm over the precedent
Of a false security
No matter how I come back
You can never be proud of me

It's too long to stay gone 
It's too long to stay gone

[Chorus]
I don't regret what words were said-
Deserved respect you never had
Watching the world keep falling around you
I don't expect your hand in this
Under duress and influence
Watching the world keep falling around you

I'll fawn over photographs
That you never would get to see
No matter how I come back
You can never be proud of me

It's too long to stay gone 
It's too long to stay gone

[Chorus]
I don't regret what words were said-
Deserved respect you never had
Watching the world keep falling around you
I don't expect your hand in this
Under duress and influence
Watching the world keep falling around you

(around you, around you)
I don't regret what words were said
Deserved respect you never had
Watching the world keep falling around you
