I could run a finger full
Temperance won't want to drive you home
She still holds out the little left to hold
Tiny eyes have told
Tiny eyes don't hide like you have yet
I'll tell you the lie
It doesn't have anyone impressed

You got something
Never live or die
Interceding
Try to fit the part
Play the role
Present tense
Little relevance

Then derelict skits disappear for a weekend
Try to clear your head
Rumor is you're running it ragged
The lies we know
The lies for amateurs at best
I've got the years
The years experience

You got nothing
Never even know
Interested
Doesn't make it so
Forget us all
Bless your friends
Little relevance
Play the role
Present tense
Little relevance
