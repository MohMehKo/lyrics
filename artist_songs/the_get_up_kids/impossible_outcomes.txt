In the sky is the moon 
This large yellow circle finds her in the mood. 
In her eyes I can see it all. 
A short plaid skirt, a white short sleeve shirt. 
My dreams aren't premonitions, 
because I'm dreaming of impossible outcomes. 
I've tried to understand but I just don't understand 
empty signposts seen through large windows. 
Late one fall afternoon after school, 
in the cool, cool suburban breeze of Louisville. 
It's unaffordable. 
It's unavoidable. 
It's inevitable. 
Our eyes, hearts and words are evidence 
My dreams aren't premonitions 
Because I'm dreaming of impossible outcomes 
I've tried to understand but I just don't understand 
Empty signposts seen through large windows
