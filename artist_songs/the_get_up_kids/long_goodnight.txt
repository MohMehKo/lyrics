every attempt to... is filled with holes
it reads like a polygraph I'm told
I'm not bitter anyway
let it go
i never sleep still lest i forget
tied down by handicaps instead
i'm not bitter anyway, but i didn't want it to turn out this way
sing a long goodnight, forfeit any fight
refuse to rest assured
it comes with no reply
hold on too tight
i hang on every word
if it all ended tonight, you know that I wouldn't mind
it'd be back to the good old times before it won
