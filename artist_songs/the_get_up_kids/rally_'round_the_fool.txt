Rally 'round the fool
We all fall
The promise of a better life
But after all the lights gone off
You just lost your appetite
Desperate hearts, desperate hands
Left in the sea to sink where we stand
Rally 'round the fool
We all fall
It's criminal at any price

Rally 'round the fool
We all fall
Surely you don't really think
That you truly do deserve all
You didn't work for anything
But after tonight, play by the rules
Burning the bridge, pares the tool
Rally 'round the fool
We all fall
The only thing that's left to say

It's all over
It's all over
