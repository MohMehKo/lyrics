After the bombs have fallen
After the words have left my lung
Inching the choke along
Testing the water with my tongue

The whole scene's fading
As if the walls are caving in
Have to up the medicine

Hamper the tender one
Temper the valor of my skull
Limping under the tongue
The patient or father
Who's at fault

Last time I swore
No lies, no regrets
Still the problem hasn't been addressed

You bastards command me
I pace the salvation plea
You bastards command me
I pace the salvation plea

The whole scene's fading
As if the walls are caving in
Have to up the medicine
Last time I swore
No lies, no regrets
Still the problem hasn't been addressed
