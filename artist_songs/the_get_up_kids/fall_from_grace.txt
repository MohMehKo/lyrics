it rains and pours in twos 
i wonder if i'll come home 
no strength left to battle you 
run to the open arms 
of anyone 
of anyone 
i'm watching you fall from grace 
breaking a heart of gold 
don't ever try saving face 
run with your heart of stone

don't ever try saving face

don't keep waiting up for me 
don't keep hoping i'll come home 
i'm watching you fall from grace 
breaking a heart of gold 
don't ever try saving face
