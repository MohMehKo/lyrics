[Verse 1:]
I go on forever
Older burns are overturned
My life for worse or better
I'm just craving for a cure

[Refrain:]
Like a man possessed
A requiem 
We're singing

[Verse 2:]
Hide the misdemeanors
Never lead an open life
My hands were never cleaner
Not a trace for you to find

[Refrain]

[Verse 3:]
Say it, does it show?
Is this test in any other time?
I know, but I don't
I'm blind in every other eye
Cold hands, colder smoke
We sleep anywhere we lie
You're lying if you don't
I'll try, I'll try

[Refrain x8]
