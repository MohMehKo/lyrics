i saw my better half
the better half of a decade
slip through my hands inside her hands inside my pockets
when she reached for her advatages i should have done something
i saw my baby boy digging his own hole
keeping alive family traditions
when he lied about intentions i should have done something
well
i blame myself for everything
it keeps my conscience clean
i've got bandages to prove it
