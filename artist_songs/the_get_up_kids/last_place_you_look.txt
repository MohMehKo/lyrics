the grass is always greener as i'm sure that you've found
if i find my way back on the last leg of this trip
i'm betting i'm finding you there
as long as it's constantly changing
as long as it's constantly sound
if there's no sense of impending danger
there's no sense in hanging around for the winter
if i'm not gonna be in your arms around me... 
what have i got if you're there?
we'll behome in December
the leaves don't fall from the trees as long 
as you remember you are always with me
it's not my place to find it
not something that i get to choose
don't be scared 'cause you're not something i'm willing to lose
i'll bet you find it in the last place you look
