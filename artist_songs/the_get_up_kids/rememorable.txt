Speak here on your cue
Look in a camera find
See the slightest hue
In the soft focus lights
I wish this were all over
We're in for a long, long haul
If you won't

Fade away
Fade away
Before this all goes to waste

Your words in backwards prose
You have such a candid tongue
You don't sink like stones
Like all the other ones
Just set the bar so low
You don't have to fall afar

Fade away
Fade away
Before this all goes to waste

I fear that these words may prove fatal
I'm gonna lay all my cards on the table
Just look how far we've come
And you'll send us ten steps off
You've got it all
You've got it all so wrong
Why don't you go away
Why don't you go away
Why don't you go away
Why don't you go away
Why don't you go away
Why don't you go away
