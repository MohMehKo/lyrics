summer swallowed us whole;
we waited for you to come around
every word you wrote down,
we read it over to know... would they believe is us now?
there's no shame like no sound from sources hits close to home
everything that we've found says make your own destiny
but you're unaware that you should be scared
maybe you'll learn from mistake that we make
we're not waiting forever 
we know you'll never be there
we're not waiting forever, but if you get out we'll see you there
you're not awake as i'm aware
maybe we had all you figured absolutely wrong
there's been a misunderstanding we've had all along
you can read about it when we're gone
