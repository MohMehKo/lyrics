if i gave everything would you still listen to me?
it could be so much better than this
i don't want you to love me anymore...
than enough
i can't be held accountable if you can't make up your mind
tonight
as much as i would like to
i can't put my hands all over you
if i put myself in that position myself to be immune to you
to keep my heart from breaking if you can't make up your mind
if i came home one last time
think of what the two of us could do
i guess we'll never know
