i'm the one you've been hanging 'round 
just stop hearing any sound 
found you face down on the ground 
found a friend never could be found 
i've been waiting around 
systems failing now 
on your honor so i hear 
it's never been your fault you swear 
is the union based on fear? 
tenement of tears 
i've been waiting 
systems failing 
walking on a wire on the ground 
is this all your world tonight? 
is this all your world tonight? 
have to tell a lie 
to avoid a brutal fight 
i've been waiting 
systems failing 
walking on a wire on the ground
