Can't get a better offer
A string of shows won't stick
Good for us, the bones won't roll around
We're not the best supports, of what this represents
It could be fun, but damn the underground

I may be undercover, an observer looking in
I can play this part, do tell
Without any gift of skill
But the words aren't worth the time

Remind me what we're waiting for
How could you forget?
Cause it's an awkward phase I should be more accustom to
I'm not here to represent anything you get
This is our life, it was lost in the light

After the show is over, to office executive
But after that, I don't remember most of it
A view over the water and film locations, too
Think how far we've sunk when I'm not a decent drunk
It's a blur of drinks and lies

Remind me what we're waiting for
How could you forget?
Cause it's an awkward phase I should be more accustom to
I'm not here to represent anything you get
This is our life, it was lost in the light

I'm never alone
The fight that time can't find us

Remind me what we're waiting for
How could you forget?
This is our life
I'm not here to represent anything you get
Forget
