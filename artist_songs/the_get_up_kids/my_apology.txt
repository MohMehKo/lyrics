You'll be accepting my apology for taking things too seriously.
Sometimes I'm old enough to to keep routines, 
sometimes I'm child enough to scream 
for everything I broke in two,
You're barely missing me, I'm missing you and everything you do,
I really do, I really do, sure I do.

My once photographic memory for recollection's sake is failing me.
I can't remember for the life of me.

Sometimes I can think to recite words that I read and rewrite,
my pens paint people that I've proven wrong,
Sometimes I can think to recite words that I read and rewrite,
my pens paint people that I've proven wrong,
But we move on

Get a job where I can tell all of my accounts of someone else
I'm quick enough to judge that they were wrong and that we knew it all along
sing a long, long-winded song I would be content to hum along.

If I state that my fingers know where to show what everyone should have known, 
I'll let it go.
Hopefully you'll forget that words that I put in print
my luck, you'll change and have strength enough to walk away

Sometimes I can think to recite words that I read and rewrite,

But we move on.
Sometimes I can think to recite words that I read and rewrite,
my pens paint people that I've proven wrong.
