it's certainly true
there's better things to do and though 
i don't know everything i wouldn't tell you anything if i did
the last time i saw you act like this we were kids
what am i to do?
my heart goes out to you
over reacting
over again...
just between friends
what am i to do?
i won't come between you two
what was i to do?
i gave it
what was i to say?
i gave it all i could
how was i to know?
i'll bet you never find another friend like me
