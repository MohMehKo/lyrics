Skip the introduction
Because we’re gonna take a step outside
You say that you’d like a cigarette
Well, hey man, I’m happy to oblige

We’re not from around here
And, I’m, I’m hoping that’s alright
See, we just left that pub right here
So far it’s been a pretty good night

Now, I see that you’ve been drinking
And honestly so have I
Did something I said just come off as rude?
I actually thought I was being quite polite

So when you punched me the first time
It came as a big surprise
But the second time that was your mistake
It sure as hell wasn’t mine, it was not mine

Two steps ahead and then you said
“You’re not from Birmingham”

Just what were you thinking?
Turned out to be a waste of time
You got to ride in a cop car
And that blood is yours it is not mine

Two steps ahead and then you said
“You’re not from Birmingham”
“You’re not from Birmingham”

Two steps ahead and then you said
“You’re not from Birmingham”

Two steps ahead and then you said
“You’re not from Birmingham”
“You’re not from Birmingham”
“You’re not from Birmingham”
“You’re not from Birmingham”
“You’re not from Birmingham”
“You’re not from Birmingham”
