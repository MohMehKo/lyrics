you're got some nerve
i never knew what with the world we gave
away in front of you
i see it all much clearer now
you're just a phase
i've gotten over anyhow
it's over
i'm not giving in again
we're loyal like brothers, just us versus all the others
i trusted misleading promises worth repeating
how could you do this to me?
red letter day that i learn i'm sure you get what you deserve
i see it all much clearer since i'm far past the point
of this if it's a lie i don't want to be the one who signed
i'm not the one who falls down
it's over now
if you want to try... try and forget it
it's over 
i'm gone
