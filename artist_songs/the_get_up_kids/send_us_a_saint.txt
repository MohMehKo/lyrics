Saw a kid on the street begging for a dime
He's lost to the world
His family, his love and his life
It's hard to sleep with nothing to eat and a habit
Saw a business man, suit and tie
He bought up his happiness
Still has a hole inside
Taking pills for all of his guilt and loneliness

Send us a saint
Some truth in the wind
If it all has to end
I'll never want to lose this feeling
A lover of love
If there's heaven above
I'll never want to lose this feeling
Beautiful girls
Hurts me the most to say
I'll never want to lose this feeling
Lose this feeling

Saw an old woman in the kitchen line
Singing "You got yours
Well, baby it's time to get mine"
She's been waiting a whole life for an answer
Saw a preacher man, homemade sign
He's casting stones at the sick and the poor and the blind
Can't even see that he is the one who needs saving

Send us a saint
Some truth in the wind
If it all has to end
I'll never want to lose this feeling
A lover of love
If there's heaven above
I'll never want to lose this feeling
Beautiful girls
Hurts me the most to say
I'll never want to lose this feeling
Lose this feeling

Baby, I will never ever leave you behind
Time is rushing in and running out
Someday I will learn to take it all in stride
But tomorrow has already passed us by

Send us a saint
Some truth in the wind
If it all has to end
I'll never want to lose this feeling
A lover of love
If there's heaven above
I'll never want to lose this feeling
Beautiful girls
Hurts me the most to say
I'll never want to lose this feeling
Lose this feeling
