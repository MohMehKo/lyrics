I never asked to be sorry 
If its over its over for sure 
I don't regret that I didn't want to 
Remember what all this was for 

So this is all we can do 
What news is in store 
How come starting over 
Would be frowned on anymore 

Hannah hold on 
Hannah hold on 
Its all been said 
Its all been done 

I never witnessed bitter like this 
I think I've been shot in cold blood 
You won't admit it and I won't be around 
Just so I hear the applause 

This isn't all we can do 
When in doubt should move on 
No need to sort it all out 
By the time you read this I'll be gone 

Hannah hold on
Hannah hold on 
Its all been said 
Its all been done 
Hang on 

You only disappoint the ones who don't believe 

Hannah hold on 

I never asked to be sorry 
If its over its over for sure
