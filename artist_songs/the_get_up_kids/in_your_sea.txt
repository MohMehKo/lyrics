Every afternooon
A point I hammer home
You had no follow through, no follow through
Better off alone

Waiting patiently
Stranded in your sea

Singing time in tune
Where the action is
Need the stars and moon, stars and moon
Wanted more than this

Waiting patiently
Stranded in your sea

Cause I'm waiting for you
And all you can do
So little to prove
Time is the task of trust
The best of us
For hours, for hours

Every afternooon
A point I hammer home
I had no time for you, time for you
You're better off alone

Waiting patiently
Stranded in your sea

Cause I'm waiting for you
And all you can do
So little to prove nobody knew
Must have been you
Didn't it prove
But somebody I'll wait for you
You'll wait for me
For hours, for hours
