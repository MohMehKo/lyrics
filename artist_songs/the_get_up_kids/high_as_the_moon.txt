i built an altar for you 
out of polaroids and pins 
on the wall of my room 
i don't know what to do 
waiting for you 
should be a sin 
out of south station 
builds me up 
it's all i can do 
high as the moon 
waiting for you 
to come back to my room 
i built an altar for you 
hope you come around 
those lead to my house
i had a question for you 
telling the truth 
throws at the sound
outside a station
builds me up 
it's all i can do 
high as the moon 
waiting for you 
to come back to my room 
all i can say 
is show me some strength 
come over please 
your enemies 
won't get to you 
waiting to speak 
days into weeks 
come over please 
no enemies 
outside a station
builds me up 
it's all i can do 
high as the moon 
waiting for you 
to come back to me please 
come over soon 
no enemies 
come over see 
i'm begging you
