If ever im wrong, whatever i do
If anyone asks, i will be hiding from you
If ever i speak, put words in my mouth
Its only speech and sound

Is there a way out?
I've got this blood on my hands
And if theres some safe ground
Im all for it

If ever untrue, then how would you know?
What would you do, where would you go?
If ever i lied, what would it be
If i were to die because you discovered me

Is there a way out?
I've got this blood on my hands
And if theres some safe ground
Im all for it

Is there a way out?
I've got this blood on my hands
And if theres some safe ground
Im all for it..
