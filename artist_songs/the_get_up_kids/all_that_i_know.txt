All we are
Is part
Of everything
It's out of our control

And I'll say
All you need to know
Is anything
That's happening is happening

All the ships in the ocean
Outside my window
Under the moon
All the lights in the harbour
Keep me from sleeping
Keep me from dreaming

Oh no
All that I know

All we are
Is part 
Of everything
It's out of our control

And I'll say 
All you need to know
Is anything
That's happening is happening

All the ships in the ocean
Outside my window
Under the moon
All the lights in the harbour
Keep me from sleeping
Keep me from dreaming

Keep the light on in the window
For the time that I am gone
And when this all is over
You will never be alone
Keep your head up
So you know
When you wake up 
I'll be home

All the ships in the ocean
Outside my window
Under the moon
All the lights in the harbour
Keep me from sleeping
Keep me from dreaming

Oh no
All that I know

It's everything I know
