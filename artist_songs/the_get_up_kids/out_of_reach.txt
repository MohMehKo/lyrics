long way from home,
lost by an echo, i'd never have known
i've got pictures to prove i was there,
but you don't care
here's me overseas, across a pond by the Dover peaks
i've smuggled myself into new nationalities, you think you'd be proud of me
there's room to believe, out of sight, out of mind, out of reach
start over is no way to begin
