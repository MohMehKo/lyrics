if everyone takes the toll 
keep following anyone 
who digs a deeper hole 
sing me a tune

sing me a tune 
wasn't this bond built forever? 
the anchor that strong 
didn't we build this together? 
the worst just go wrong 
the worst just go wrong 
on and on 
how do you win so many enemies? 
i'm open to any good news 
what if the world falls in? 
on the only option we knew
