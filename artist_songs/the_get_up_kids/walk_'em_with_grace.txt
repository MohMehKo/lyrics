Round after round after round
Is wearing me down
Fight after fight after fight
With all of my might
I’m just so pleased when you say The end of the goddamn
Day will come I’ll be around somehow
Because this all I own
These are the walls that ruined this house
This is the place I stand
These are the boards I pace
Walk ‘em with grace

Won’t you stay down when you fall
At the end of it all
Why did you go when you go
I’m begging you please no
I’m just so ready to say
It’s the end of the goddamn

Day will come I’ll be around somehow
Because this all I own
These are the walls that ruined this house

This is the place I stand
These are the boards I pace
Walk ‘em with graceful steps
The show will go on and on and on and on but the
Last goodbye isn’t so far away anyway
