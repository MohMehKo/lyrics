You keep hanging on for more
Building walls around the words around the world
I keep tripping over hints
I keep spilling every secret
Without spilling any secrets at all

Don't you know?
Of course you don't
Of course you don't
The words might choke
How long is too long when you're waiting by the phone?

Did the issue go this far?
Did you set this higher standard for yourself?
I know it's not a fault
Though I really have to wonder
If you'd ever set the standard without help

Don't you know?
Of course you don't
Of course you don't
The words might choke
How long is too long when you're waiting by the phone?

Made up
You win
I'm lost
Give in
To each
Their own
With all their sins

You keep hanging on for more
Building walls around the words around the world

Don't you know?
Of course you don't
Of course you don't
The words might choke
This small town takes every ounce to build its smoke
How long is too long when you're waiting by the phone?
