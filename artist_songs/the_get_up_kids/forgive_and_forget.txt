I think I've waited long enough. 
Our world was once forget-me-nots 
And now I wait another year. 
Now I wait another year. I need you here. 
I think I've heard this one before, 
But it's not you walking through my door. 
And now I wait another year. 
Now I wait another year. I need you here. 
I need you here. I need you here. I need you here. 
Don't bother it now, Let sleepers lie. 
Bygones have all gone by. 
Forgot what we fought for, Hard as I might, 
Don't have the will to fight. 
Forgive & forget Whatever was said 
Because we're growing up By the hour. 
I never would let It go on like it did: 
All good things Have endings. 
Forgive & forget Whatever was said 
All good things Have endings. 
Don't bother it now, Let sleepers lie. 
Bygones have all gone by. 
Forgot what we fought for, Hard as I might, 
Don't have the will to fight. 
Don't bother it now, Let sleepers lie. 
Bygones have all gone by. 
Forgot what we fought for, Hard as I might, 
Don't have the will to fight.
