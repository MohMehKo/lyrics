can you sleep as the sound hits your ears one at a time?
an unspokenbalance here, 
unabridged for so many years
that i should stare at receivers to receive her isn't fair
don't worry i'll catch you 
don't ever worry
your arms in mine, anytime
i wouldn't trade anything
you're still my everything
to my surprise, before my eyes, you arrive
don't worry I'll catch you
don't ever worry
i'm still breaking old habits, habits when you pulled the wool over me
i can see everything, everything remembering "jinx removing"
don't worry i'll catch you [x2]
don't ever worry
no need for reminding... you're still all that matters to me
