This trespass
My weaker wings couldn't carry much of anything
But my temptress
You take a toll on the vengeances
Oh, merciful
Defenseless against this tide
It's the coming storm, the counter line
Replace this with just my hands
And just my will
You'll all be damned

One small lie
A test of faith
Just to testify attempted fate
Repentant, a fallen son
The die is cast
Thy will be done

You got caught in the better lie
You fell off at the fault line
Into the sun
You got caught in the better lie
You fell off at the fault line

There's no blood spilled upon this ground
A silent night without a sound
But past this, a worrying woe
This is not a trial

You got caught in the better lie
You fell off at the fault line
Into the sun
You got caught in the better lie
Into the sun
You fell off at the fault line
Into the sun
You got caught in the better lie
Into the sun
You fell off at the fault line
