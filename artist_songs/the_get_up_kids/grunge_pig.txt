I didn't take that blow to heart 
You couldn't tear our home apart 
You anything you wanted everything 
I don't have brusies I can show 
Scars from abuse without a blow 
You anything you wanted everything 

You don't owe anything to me 

I didn't take that blow to heart 
You couldn't tear our home apart 
You anything you wanted everything 

You don't owe anything to me 
But don't expect me not to live 

I ask each year 
Why am I here 
Begging you please 
Remembering 
I'd rather die than be alone 

I didn't take that blow to heart 
You couldn't tear our home apart 
Give you anything you wanted everything 

You don't owe anything to me 
But don't expect me not to live 

I ask each year 
Why am I here 
Begging you please 
Remembering 
I'd rather die than be alone
