ten minutes to downtown is ten minutes too far
when my friends all say I'm crazy,
maybe I'm being selfish
maybe I'm just scared
don't be gone when I get home... I need you there
if I had to explain it I wouldn't know were to start
it's like you're falling in love, while I just fall apart
ten minutes to downtown is ten minutes too far
when my heart is saying you're crazy maybe things are getting better... maybe
things aren't so bad
don't be gone when I get home... you're all I have
if I had to explain it,
I wouldn't know where to start
its like you're falling in love while I just fall apart
pockets empty, how can you tell me
that everything will work out...
a pointless fight when you're always right
and everything will work out
sometimes, I miss you more whenever I'm at home
I've been home all summer... now I'm leaving you alone
pockets empty, how can you tell me that everything will work out...
a pointless fight when you're always right and
everything will work out
