Of all of the space in this small world
There's room in my life for you, girl
Though we had a lot of words to say
Didn't think we'd need to have another damn conversation about it

Question the words for years now
I'm finding my sense and my know how
Though I'm learning that I was wrong
Didn't think we'd need to have another damn conversation about it [x3]
