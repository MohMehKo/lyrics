forgive me for runningoff to find the one things i have to do
each night you can fall asleep assured that someday
i'll be comeing home to you
these constant reminders in everything i see
the chance of a lifetime...
what a great place to be
oh amy
don't hate me for running away from you
oh amy
don't hate me
i'm still in love with you
i'm sorry i can't be everything to you
your place is at the heart of what i do everything's for you
every time i run away 
it's easier to stay
at the heart the hearts is you in everything i do
