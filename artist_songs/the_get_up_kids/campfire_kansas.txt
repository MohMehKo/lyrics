woke up at eight, started a fire 
had a few drinks, we all felt inspired 
jumped in the stream, our shoes and canteens 
the water is bitter cold 
laid in the raft till it started moving 
the current just sang, the song was so soothing 
we stopped along the way 
on a beach in the sun on a beautiful day 
our boats collide, we feel the breeze 
we stay afloat and make the most of everything 
by noon we had swung the ropes in the woods 
missed all dangers, snakes and the floods 
burned by the rays and next to our legs, the water so bitter cold 
lunch had been saved along with the lighters 
wet cigarettes serve us as reminders 
never trust a man with food, change of clothes, and a drink in his hand 
our boats collide, we feel the breeze 
we stay afloat and make the most of everything 
the sun will set, the stars would shine 
the trees would shake, we'd all feel fine 
let's take the moon and make it shine for everyone 
we'd laugh away the sunburn 
as we laughed away his day 
what we lost means nothing 
for the memories will stay 
caught the last bus, with no time to linger
driver seemed to be missing a finger 
i turned and looked away to the bus, gravel road and a beautiful day
our boats collide, we feel the breeze 
we stay afloat and make the most of everything 
the sun will set, the stars would shine 
the trees would shake, we'd all feel fine 
let's take the moon and make it shine for everyone 
let's take the moon and make it shine for everyone
