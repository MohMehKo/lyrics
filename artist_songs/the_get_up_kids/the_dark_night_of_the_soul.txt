Never thought anything lasts forever
Hanging on every word
Hold the cards in tight
But your killing me with sincerity
And I'd make any move tonight

Redemption is a bitch
Too end on 

The dark night of the soul
The dark night of the soul 

All my training beget a traitor
A monster with a mind of it's own
The beast is poised to strike
The bastard plays on these insecurities
Takes all my will to fight 

Redemption is a bitch 
Too end on

The dark night of the soul
The dark night of the soul 
Oh well,You know what they say
Suddenly everything's
Suddenly everytihng's real

The dark night of the soul
The dark night of the soul 
(oh well, You know what they say
Suddenly everything's
Suddenly everytihng's real)
The dark night of the soul
The dark night of the soul
(The bastard plays on these insecurities
Takes all my will fight)
The dark night of the soul
The dark night of the soul 
(Oh well,You know what they say
Suddenly everything's
Suddenly everytihng's real)
The dark night of the soul
The dark night of the soul
