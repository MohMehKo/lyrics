Wandering the K-10 As anniversaries end, 
Pondering events that brought us here. 
If anyone remember when Around the world and back again 
Was a dream not quite so clear? 
Overwhelms Over the hills and away Was not a mistake. 
Did that straight and narrow, 
Nailed self-righteous arrow Get to be so decadent? 
Could you trade your lessons To have grown up in the process? 
Remarks never relent. 
Learned by your examples 
And we learned by your mistakes. 
Argue our positions, It's a decision that we have to make. 
It's not a mistake If we had known What we know now: 
One year later, we'd still be around. 
Got your full attention Over hours of speculation, 
Don't you know who knows:? I know. 
Finally make decisions? Finally work it out? 
Finally let it go? 
We're not running backwards. 
Don't you know, That we love reunion shows. 
This is not a swan song: But it goes: 
If we had known what we know now: 
One year later, we'd still be around. 
If we had known what we know now: 
One year later, we'd still be around, 
around, around.
