God blessed here's a man of conviction
With evidence enough to convict him
So he stands by the side of the victim
Has strength enough to forgive him
Hopefully nobody saw him
Hopefully nobody saw him
The means justified by the ending
Sinner and saint for defending

The bastard by him that is breathing
Throws salt in the wounds of the needy
The blood from the cut that is seething
He gasps for the air we are breathing
Hopefully nobody saw him
Hopefully nobody saw him 
Means justified by the ending
Sinner and saint for defending

Our hero is gone
