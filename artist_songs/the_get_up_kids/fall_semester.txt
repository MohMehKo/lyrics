if i tried
would you still call me son?
if i tried
would you call me at all?
if i say that i'll go regardless of what you want me to do i'm better off without
i'm better off without you
if i change my mind it won't be soon enough for you
but i'm not you
i'll try to compromise for you to see that there's 
so many other things for me to find out
run myself to the ground
would you please forgive me if i found my way back home?
everything i see
everything i do
everywhere i've been
these mean nothing to you?
