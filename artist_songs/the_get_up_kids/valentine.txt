it's words you forget to anniversary songs
the bottles bite back
your tolerance wrong
your good intentions count for little anymore
if you're sorry why wage war?
i'm not fully convinced that there's something wrong with this
could anotehr point of view, baised and untrue, tear me away from you?
will you be my valentine if i'm a world away?
apologies are breaking me
the constants aren't so constant anymore
for two days i wait for calls to come through
tonight for me translates to yesterday to you
you bend and you wave when you're barely away
i wish i could say tonight that when you bend 
and wave goodbye you'd take me with you
