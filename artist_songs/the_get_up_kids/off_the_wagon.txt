They're my reasons for getting over this 
and it's not much better than waking up 
with your head in your hands, 
and your arms are tired from supporting... 
It's better in the long run, 
but this is the worst day of my life. 
I'm giving in, 
this can't be much better than dying. 
I'm going back to my selfish ways, 
I'm giving up what I could forget. 
I've tried, it came out better the first time. 
If this is all you see then have a drink on me 
and look who's laughing now.
