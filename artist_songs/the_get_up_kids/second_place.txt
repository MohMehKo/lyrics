It's been proven, hundreds over since, 
the decision was the best that we could make. 
If I wasn't clear enough before... 
that's not what I said, 
and I bent over backwards just to speak. 
If you've got things straight in your head 
then you've got bigger problems than me. 
I'll send you straight to your room 
until you calm down, 
until you're thought through what you want to say. 
This isn't me, 
as much as it may seem 
and you're still thinking... 
That's not what I said 
and I bent over backwards just to speak. 
If you won't let sleeping dogs die 
then I'm giving up on this one.
