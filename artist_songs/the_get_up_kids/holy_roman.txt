Road map is a bitter pill
Scene stinks of a double deal
A good front like the devil will
Your eyes on the prize
Come clean like you said you would
Make peace like i know you could
Hero's don't do any good 
With tears in their eyes

Fight the good fight
Maintain the trend
Just look me in the eyes and say
The world's not gonna end

Take stock in a master plan
Place bets on an empty hand
Empire has a leg to stand
Holy roman style
A poison from a holy grail
Blind faith doesn't make a sale
Landmines on a righteous trail
March rank and file

Unpatriotic
Friend stabbing friend
You'll look me in the eyes
And say the worlds not gonna end
Just look me in the eyes
And say the worlds not gonna end

Will you save us?
Will you save us?
