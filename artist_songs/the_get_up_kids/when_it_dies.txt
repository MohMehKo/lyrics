As it sharpens and it's shimmering
Every cut, a song
All the inner voices whispering
Say I've done it wrong

I got mine to say "Let it go when it dies"

As the pressure starts to escalate
Be your father found
Lack the patience when I'm desperate
Never make a sound

I got mine to say "Let it go when it dies"
You don't have a thing less

A little magic, little mystery
Never did no harm
I ain't talkin' if you twisted me,
You could break my arm

I got mine to say "Let it go when it dies"
You don't have
I got through a ways I can tell when it dies
I know how to take it

Better days, you bet on these
The company that you keep
[repeat until end]
