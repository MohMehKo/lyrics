Way to fight
You never threatened to stop breathing countless times
When it wouldn't make a sound
Baby eyes
The whole thing is a fading senseless blur
Of concern
But I'm letting go of her

I don't know why it is
Isn't it obvious to me?
Sympathy
I'm sure that after this
You don't fear anything at all
Resembling

All her might
Was it the force behind the family bound and tied
Keep the bottle down
To our surprise
The suspect you had discipline or nerve to convert
I just didn't think it'd work

I don't know why it is
Isn't it obvious to me?
Sympathy
I'm sure that after this
You don't fear anything at all
Resembling

For what we give to this
What challenges persist
Battles we must fight
For what we give to this
Promise to resist
I stand with all your might

I don't know why it is
Isn't it obvious to me?
Sympathy
I'm sure that after this
You don't fear anything at all
Resembling
