Shout it out
Shatter your lung
Long fall to the floor
Crying out, dry as a bone
Take you somewhere
But it's too late, it's too far
You're faking the part

Way down on Tennyson
They'll tell you it's true
You come down from your medicine
All battered and blue

Shout it out
Shatter your lung
Long fall to the floor
Crying out, dry as a bone
Take you somewhere
But it's too late, it's too far
You're faking the part

Way down on Tennyson
They'll tell you it's true
Come down from your medicine
All battered and blue

Shout it out
Shatter your lung
Long fall to the floor
Too late, it's too far
