you really think you're bigger than this
to the tune of ten thousand lisps
who would have thought we'd represent
when i can't take a compliment?
overexposure is the key and any focus on me is appreciated
as it should be
no wonder now
i finally found the right formula for...
you taught me how
i play the fool
every mistake that i make
i couldn't have made without you
what's said is done and plain to see
you take it all too seriously
here's all you get from me
what better way to make an honest mistake
than a televised hand of fate
when the world's closing in on you
a decision would be overdue
now nothing left is out of hand
a stronger jaded man stands
if the world is ending then we toast to it
i'm stronger now but not without the right formula for...
i'm down for whatever
what's there left to wait for?
