It's quiet here today, where tears have left a stain
Time goes by still the room doesn't make a sound
I'm feeling out of place, I'm needing to explain
I tried to fly, but my feet never left the ground

I know everybody sees it, feels it
When I look at you
I know you really feel it, I mean it
We cannot lose

What do I have to do? (cause I'd do anything)
To prove myself to you (and you mean everything)
I'm sorry girl for disappointing you
I'm still in love, you know I'm still in love with you
Now we can't go back (cause I'd do anything)
I should have known that (and you mean everything)
I'm sorry girl. We need another chance
(I'm still in love, you know I'm still in love with you)

I'm feeling so afraid, can feelings go away?
I tried to fly, but my feet never left the ground

I know everybody sees it, feels it
When I look at you
I know you really feel it, I mean it
We cannot lose

What do I have to do? (cause I'd do anything)
To prove myself to you (and you mean everything)
I'm sorry girl for disappointing you
I'm still in love, you know I'm still in love with you
And now we can't go back (cause I'd do anything)
I should have known that (and you mean everything)
I'm sorry girl. We need another chance
(I'm still in love, you know I'm still in love with you)

You know you're the one
You know I was wrong
You know that I'd do anything
I'm still in love with you

I know everybody sees it, feels it
When I look at you
I know you really feel it, I mean it
We cannot lose

What do I have to do? (cause I'd do anything)
To prove myself to you (and you mean everything)
I'm sorry girl for disappointing you
I'm still in love, you know I'm still in love with you
And now we can't go back (cause I'd do anything)
I should have known that (and you mean everything)
I'm sorry girl. We need another chance
(I'm still in love, you know I'm still in love with you)

You know you're the one
You know I was wrong
You know that I'd do anything
I'm still in love with you

You know you're the one
You know I was wrong
You know that I'd do anything
I'm still in love with you
