Six o'clock on a Friday night
Tell myself that it's alright
But it's not enough, it's not enough

I'm gonna light up the town tonight
So I can try, to say goodbye
But it's not enough, it's not enough

[PRE-CHORUS]
Well I want you to know that
You're all that I wanted, now
Well I'm begging you, please

[CHORUS]
Don't go (don't go)
I could say that I don't miss you but
My heart knows (heart knows)
That you're the one for me (you're the one for me)
I never thought you would follow through
I never thought I would say this to you
Come home, 'cause I miss you

By the phone on a Friday night
Tell myself you're on the line
But it's not enough (not enough), 
It's not enough

I need to find something else inside
So I can try, to make this right
'Cause I've got enough (got enough), 
I've got enough

[PRE-CHORUS]
And I want you to know that
You're all that I wanted, now
Well I'm begging you, please

[CHORUS]
Don't go (don't go)
I could say that I don't miss you but
My heart knows (heart knows)
That you're the one for me (you're the one for me)
I never thought you would follow through
I never thought I would say this to you
Never thought I would fight for you
But you're the one for me (you're the one for me)

[Instrumental]

Don't go, I could say that I don't miss you
But my heart knows
That you're the one for me

[CHORUS]
Don't go (don't go)
I could say that I don't miss you but
My heart knows (heart knows)
That you're the one for me (you're the one for me)
I never thought you would follow through (follow through)
I never thought I would say this to you
Never thought I would fight for you (fight for you)
But you're the one for me

Don't go (don't go)
I could say that I don't miss you but
My heart knows (heart knows)
That you're the one for me (you're the one for me)
I never thought you would follow through (follow through)
I never thought I would say this to you
Come home, 'cause I miss you
