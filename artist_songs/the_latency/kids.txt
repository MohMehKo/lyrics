Speak your mind,
No ones listening. 
Our hope's tied,
To everything you know you felt but never said,
Is burning through your eyes.
I'll help you find your self again tonight.

You say, "We'll get out this time."
And you wait, put your hand in mine.
Believe it, we're the kids of yesterday.
You say, "Help me out this time."
And you wait, put your hand in mine.
Believe it, we're the kids of yesterday.

Speak your mind,
'Cause I'll be listening. 
On those long nights,
When everything you know you felt but never said,
Is burning through your eyes.
I'll help you find your self again tonight.

You say, "We'll get out this time."
And you wait, put your hand in mine.
Believe it, we're the kids of yesterday.
You say, "Help me out this time."
And you wait, put your hand in mine.

Believe it, we're the kids of yesterday.

So let's just go, do you feel alone?
You'll feel alone when the lights go out.
But you'll feel at home when everything you know you felt but never said,
Is burning through your eyes
I'll help you find your self again tonight.

You say, "We'll get out this time."
And you wait, put your hand in mine.
Believe it, we're the kids of yesterday.
You say, "Help me out this time."
And you wait, put your hand in mine.
Believe it, we're the kids of yesterday.

You say, "We'll get out this time."
And you wait, put your hand in mine.
We're the kids, we're the kids of yesterday.
We're the kids, we're the kids of yesterday.
Believe it, we're the kids.

Inside these walls, hope is just waiting to fall.
