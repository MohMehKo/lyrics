I have kept
Everything the way you left it
I have found
All the things we build to burn them down

I'm blaming you girl
I'll see you around
I'd love to burn this town
I'm watching it drown, watch it drown

And if you please
Excuse me while I breathe in
It seems this room is getting smaller as we speak
I'll be gone
When you finally see that
In this place its getting harder for me to believe
Its too hard for me

I can feel
Every word this town has spoken
Can you see
All the things they wouldn't let us be?

I'm blaming you girl
I'll see you around
I'd love to burn this town
I'm watching it drown, watch it drown

And if you please
Excuse me while I breathe in
It seems this room is getting smaller as we speak
I'll be gone
When you finally see that
In this place its getting harder for me to believe
Its too hard for me

Woah
I cant stop my feet they're moving way to fast
For me
Woah
I cant stop your tears, but you will be okay
Someday

And if you please
Excuse me while I breathe in
It seems this room is getting smaller as we speak
I'll be gone
When you finally see that
In this place its getting harder for me to believe
Its too hard for me
And if you please
Excuse me while I breathe in
It seems this room is getting smaller as we speak
I'll be gone
When you finally see that
In this place its getting harder for me to believe
Its too hard for me
And if you please
Excuse me while I breathe in
It seems this room is getting smaller as we speak
I'll be gone
When you finally see that
In this place its getting harder for me to believe
Its too hard for me
To breathe
