I've seen you before so tell me, what's your name?
I listened for more but all I heard was pain
Blood on the floor, it always looks the same
Now that you're here, well I just want you to know
You've made your mistake and now I want you to go
Hope you can find someone to take you home

Cause I've seen countless rough ends
And I never thought that ours would be this way

You've got to cry me out and live this once
Cause I'm done now, our time has run
There's nothing here worth staying for
We're better off alone
You've got to cry me out and live this once

We've made out mistakes but I won't place the blame
Neither of us wants it to feel this way
When this is done, nothing will be the same
After it all, I hope you'll understand
The sky was the darkest that it's ever been
After the rain, you'll see the light again

Cause I've seen countless rough ends
And I never thought that ours would be this way

You've got to cry me out and live this once
Cause I'm done now, our time has run
There's nothing here worth staying for
We're better off alone
You've got to cry me out and live this once

When hope is lost and no one's won
Life goes on so live this once

You've got to cry me out and live this once
Cause I'm done now, our time has run
There's nothing here worth staying for
We're better off alone
You've got to cry me out and live this once

(Your heart won't beat the same
Your heart won't beat the same)
There's nothing here worth staying for
We're better off alone

Our hearts won't beat the same
