Can you hear me call?
You're selling out, I see it now
But I have never seen your face
It's a long way down
It's a long way down
But will you ever save the day?

I'm tired of interest
I'm tired of failing
I'm tired of you
You don't want to do this
You don't want to feel this
You won't let me through

Tell me where we went wrong
Show me where we belong
Cause I have looked deep inside of me
I cannot find a memory
How did we end up here,
Knowing nothing but fear?
Cause I have looked deep inside of me
I cannot find a memory

You're copping out, I see it now
Because you're not sure if this is safe
So hear me now, hear me now
And I'll show you
That you have lost the way

I'm tired of interest
I'm tired of failing
I'm tired of you
You don't want to do this
You don't want to feel this
You won't let me through

Tell me where we went wrong
Show me where we belong
Cause I have looked deep inside of me
I cannot find a memory
How did we end up here,
Knowing nothing but fear?
Cause I have looked deep inside of me
I cannot find a memory

And can you hear me, 
Can you hear me,
Can you hear me call?
I won't take the,
I won't take the,
I won't take the fall

Can you hear me,
Can you hear me,
Can you hear me call?
We won't take the,
We won't take the,
We won't take the fall

Tell me where we went wrong
Show me where we belong
Cause I have looked deep inside of me
I cannot find a memory
How did we end up here,
Knowing nothing but fear?
Cause I have looked deep inside of me
I cannot find a memory

Tell me where we went wrong
Show me where we belong
Cause I have looked deep inside of me
I cannot find a memory
How did we end up here,
Knowing nothing but fear?
Cause I have looked deep inside of me
I cannot find a memory

Cause I have looked deep inside of me
I cannot find a memory
Can you hear me call?
