Hello, are you drowning deep inside?
Does it make you want to cry?
All the words we said, 
Were they meaningless,
Like the time we spent?

Hello, we've built this house of lies,
And we'll tear it down in spite
Of the times we had, 
All the good and bad
And it makes me want to scream

So wave goodbye to your old life
Cause we built this house on broken dreams
And we locked the keys inside
And take your plans and say we tried
Cause we built this house on broken dreams
We locked the keys inside

Hello, I've listened to your lines
And I wrote this down in spite
Of the times we had,
All the good and bad
And it makes me want to scream

So wave goodbye to your old life
Cause we built this house on broken dreams
And we locked the keys inside
And take your plans and say we tried
Cause we built this house on broken dreams
We locked the keys inside

Rupture this, I won't close my eyes and follow you
Fracture that, I'm doing everything I wanted to
(Wave goodbye)
Rupture this, I won't close my eyes and follow you
Fracture that, I'm doing everything I wanted to
(Say we tried)

Wave goodbye to your old life
We built this house on broken dreams
We locked the keys inside
Take your plans and say we tried
We built this house on broken dreams
We locked the keys inside

Yeah, we locked the keys inside
