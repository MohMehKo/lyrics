It's a beautiful night and I'm opened up
The look in your eyes says so much
Nothing can touch us out here
Don't know where we are but I know I see
A beautiful girl walking next to me
I need to hold you, my dear

Let's just take tonight, tonight slow
Cause I want to see where this, where this goes
I need you

I'd give you today but it's not mine yet
I'll ask you to stay here with me ‘till then
I think I'm falling for you
(falling for you, I need you)
I just want to look in your eyes and see
All that you have looking back at me
I think tonight, I love you
(I love you)

Tell me the chance hasn't passed us by
Cause baby, the stars have never shined so bright
Nothing can stop us out here

Let's just take tonight, tonight slow
I want to see where this, where this goes
I need you

I'd give you today but it's not mine yet
I'll ask you to stay here with me ‘till then
I think I'm falling for you
(falling for you, I need you)
I just want to look in your eyes and see
All that you have looking back at me
I think tonight, I love you
(I love you) I love you

I'd give you today but it's not mine yet
I love you

I'd give you today but it's not mine yet
I'll ask you to stay here with me ‘till then
I think I'm falling for you
(falling for you)
I just want to look in your eyes and see
All that you have looking back at me
I think tonight, I love you
(I love you) I love you

Just breathe in, You'll be fine
I'm right here by your side
(I love you)
Just breathe in, You'll be fine
(I love you)

I'd give you today but it's not mine yet
I'll ask you to stay here with me ‘till then
I think tonight, I love you
