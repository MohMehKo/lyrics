Listen up, little one
We're already ahead of the game
Hurry now, make me proud
I'm still finding the strength to say
Say goodbye, there's no time
Make it worth every minute
And never forget every day

Hey little girl you're on top of the world
You're all that I wanted to know
Never look back you're much stronger than that
And nobody knows where to go
When they come to a fork in the road

Shout it out, make it loud
What's the best we could make of today?
Wave goodbye, draw the line
Cause it's worth every minute
You'll never forget every day

Hey little girl you're on top of the world
You're all that I wanted to know
Never look back you're much stronger than that
And nobody knows where to go
Going home

All the world is so broken
Now that there is no time
All words left unspoken
I'll leave them burning inside
We'll be fine

Hey little girl you're on top of the world
You're all that I wanted to know
Never look back you're much stronger than that
And nobody knows where to go
Going home

No one really knows because
No one really knows because
(Please don't cry, I'm on your side)
No one really knows where to go
Going home
No one really knows because
No one really knows because
(Wave goodbye, You'll be alright)
No one really knows where to go

When they come to a fork in the road...
