Whoa oh, whoa oh 
Whoa oh, whoa oh

I'm driving home in the pouring rain
I'm getting tired of the song that's playing
All I want is a reason, you've got to give me something
You know it's really hard to concentrate
I'm getting tired of the words you're saying
Don't tell me you're waiting, I would be all you wanted
Give me something else ...

So if you take a chance then you won't regret it
Cause I'll take your hand and I'll keep you betting on me
All the things that I do to you
Everything that this is turning into
You've gotta close your eyes & I'll show you something
We can spend some time and I'll keep you running to me
All the time I would spend with you
Everything I could learn about you
I'll be something, I'll be all you wanted

Whoa oh, whoa oh
Whoa oh, whoa oh 

Here we are in the pouring rain
It's pretty clear you're a chance worth taking
I can tell that you're waiting for me to give you something
Now there's nothing left to complicate
Little words that are not worth saying 
You have got to believe me
I would be all you wanted
Give me something else

So if you take a chance then you won't regret it
Cause I'll take your hand and I'll keep you betting on me
All the things that I do to you
Everything that this is turning into
You've gotta close your eyes & I'll show you something
We can spend some time and I'll keep you running to me
All the time I would spend with you
Everything I could learn about you
I'll be something, I'll be all you wanted

Take me or leave me
It's not what you think
This could be something that no one could fake
If you do just try to change your mind
But sooner or later you're likely to break
I won't be waiting to fix your mistakes 
Give me something else

So if you take a chance then you won't regret it
Cause I'll take your hand and I'll keep you betting
All the things that I do to you
Anything this is ...

Take a chance then you won't regret it
Cause I'll take your hand and I'll keep you betting on me
All the things that I do to you
Everything that this is turning into
You've gotta close your eyes & I'll show you something
We can spend some time and I'll keep you running to me
All the time I would spend with you
Everything I could learn about you
I'll be something, I'll be all you wanted
