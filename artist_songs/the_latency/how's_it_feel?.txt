How's it feel?
How's it feel as we get closer?
Feel as we get closer?
This is real
We are everything but older,
Everything but older
How's it feel?
Now the room is getting warmer
Room is getting warmer
So surreal
Cause we're taking this town over,
Taking this town over

Hold your breath and wait (for me)
Tonight we raise the stakes (for me)
Got to bring this town to life, so
Let's live it up, let's give it up
Now we're racing fate (for me)
Never hit the brakes (for me)
We've got to bring this town to life, so
Let's live it up, I wanna take you away

How's it feel?
As our time is getting closer,
Time is getting closer
So surreal
Because this night is far from over,
It's so far from over

Hold your breath and wait (for me)
Tonight we raise the stakes (for me)
Got to bring this town to life, so
Let's live it up, let's give it up
Now we're racing fate (for me)
Never hit the brakes (for me)
We've got to bring this town to life, so
Let's live it up, I wanna take you away

Hey! Hey! Hey!
Now we're really giving it all
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Now we're really giving it all
How's it feel?
Now we're really giving it all
So surreal
Let's live it up, I wanna take you away

Hold your breath and wait (for me)
Tonight we raise the stakes (for me)
Got to bring this town to life, so
Let's live it up, let's give it up
Now we're racing fate (for me)
Never hit the brakes (for me)
We've got to bring this town to life, so
Let's live it up, I wanna take you away

Hey! Hey! Hey!
Now we're really giving it all
Hey! Hey! Hey!
I wanna take you away
