Conversation has its hold on me 
But you'll know this back and forth 
Is just getting old, is just getting old 

You've been talking to me endlessly 
But you will not say the things 
That I want to know, that I want to know 

Let me in, words are wearing numb (ah, ah, ah) 
Could it be bad enough that I would turn and run? 

[Chorus:] 
Run away (you'll find nothing is sacred) 
Away (I swear, I won't believe it) 
So come on, you can stay with me and sit down, 
And I will not run away 

Maybe I would walk a thousand miles 
Tell the world the secret things 
That you're trying to hold, trying to hold 

But you'll have to take a chance on me and 
Just give up all the ghosts that you're dying to show 
'Cause I'm dying to know 

Let me in, words are wearing numb (ah, ah, ah) 
Could it be bad enough that I would turn and run? 

[Chorus:] 
Run away (you'll find nothing is sacred) 
Away (I swear, I won't believe it) 
So come on, you can stay with me and sit down, 
And I will not run away 

So come on, 
You can stay with me and sit down, 
You can compare me with your thoughts 
And your tears will wash your fears away 

So come on, 'cause I need the truth 
I can tell, this is killing you, let it out. 
And your tears will wash your fears away 

Away, away, (you'll find nothing is sacred) 

[Chorus:] 
Away (you'll find nothing is sacred) 
Away (I swear, I won't believe it) 
So come on, you can stay with me and sit down, 
And I will not run away 

So come on, 
You can stay with me and sit down, 
You can compare me with your thoughts 
And your tears will wash your fears away 

So come on, 'cause I need the truth 
I can tell, this is killing you, let it out. 
I can feel your fear just wash away 

Away
