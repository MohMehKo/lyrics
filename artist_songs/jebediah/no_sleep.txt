You got your very own Watergate
There aint no easy way out
And if you wanna be social oh yeah
You better scream when you shout
I'll take you out where you wanna go
Yeah we can buy us some thrills
It's not the size of the night out oh no
It's the size of the pills

Come on
No sleep Sunday

We don't do it to get away
Only to Amplifier
And we don't wanna get fucked up on no
We just wanna get high
So come on, come on I got a feeling it won't take long
Get out, cut loose I got a feeling you know what to do

Come on
No sleep Sunday
