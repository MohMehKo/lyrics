Believe you will
They'll take your honesty still
Honoured Chairman of the Board
Picking the scraps off the floor
Desperate for more
Its corporate law
When spirits fall
They'll own us all

Its all that we know
In everything that we say
Its everyday lives
Born to a loss of control

I dream daily, humans are commodities
One day you'll see the Run of the Company

When you don't realise until its on front of your eyes
When your inside of the plan
Answering all to the man

[Chorus]
