Consider all you've got to lose
Consider life and what you choose
Consider everything cos you might not get it back
I've got an itch under my skin
I'm walking balancing on pins
With nowhere safe to fall and the walls are closing in

I got a truth that noone knows and my desperation grows
There must be something that I missed tell me that there's more than this

I got a womb to call my own
I got a room to crawl in alone
And when I make it out I'm gonna do it on my own
And all these lights on in my head
Are put out in my sleep instead
Dreams of black and white are waking up to life in red

I've got a truth that no one knows and my desperation grows
There must be something that I missed tell me that there's more than this

Braxton Hicks!
