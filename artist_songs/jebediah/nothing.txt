I'm on the outside.

And now there's nothing left to think about
Because there's nothing going in or out
And now there's nothing left to live without
With so much nothing left to go around

And now there's nothing left for me to do
Because there's nothing small that's getting through
Now all the nothing makes up everything
You just can't be a part of anything

Think about nothing
In. Out. Nothing
Nowhere. Nothing.

Bring out your dead!
