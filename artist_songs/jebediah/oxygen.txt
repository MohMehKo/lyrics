Rock and roll
Once again
The time has come to save my skin
And not to make it easier
Just to make it fun

All I’ve got is
Where I’ve been
All I know and all I’ve seen
Just makes me dizzy all the time
Like too much oxygen

So fill up your lungs
Pack your bags for the sun
And I won’t make you promises
Or tell you how the story ends

Oxygen
Oxygen
Oxygen
