[Verse 1:]
I don't wanna let you down 
But I cannot have you hanging around 
Hope you didn't fall for me 
I am somebody that you could never see 

[Chorus:]
Never been like this before 
Tell me that there's something more 
There never was a miracle in the snow 
Should've let you know 
Before I let you go 

[Verse 2:]
You know I didn't act my best 
I always thought I was a cut above the rest 
Cos when you've been hurt yourself 
Somehow makes it easy hurting someone else 

[Chorus]
