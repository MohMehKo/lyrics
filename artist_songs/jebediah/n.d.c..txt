where you going
what's your scene
saw your face in a magazine
hanging out with the kings and queens
hail the teenage royalty

you just keep lying to yourself
you're better than everyone else
keep saying it over again

everybodies selling souls
where it's headed no one knows
screw education get on the dole
give it up for rock n roll

all this talk 'bout the better band
this is getting out of hand
what's it matter understand
you don't want to you don't want to

you just keep lying to yourself
you're better than everyone else
keep saying it over again....and over again oh N.D.C N.D.C N.D.C N.D.C
