I'm a grave digger
I'm a theif stealing your bones
Your an old liar
History revisionist

You're trying to be cool but you're falling asleep at the wheel
And how do you think when your heart is the last place you feel?
And every time you're saying
"Everything's fine".

And I don't know why
But this loaded gun is just what I've been waiting for

I'm a wanderer
I'm a dreamer, dreaming away
You're a long distance memory I rescusitate

You're trying to be cool but you're falling asleep at the wheel
And how do you think when your heart is the last place you feel?
And every time you're saying
"Everything's fine"

And I don't know why
But this loaded gun is just what I've been waiting for
It's just what I've been waiting for.
