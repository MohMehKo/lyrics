So I thought the worst was over
When my heart stopped beating again
And the weak side of my body has come undone
Through trusting them
So we walked into the building
Took the lift to the third floor
Pain lies behind that door what am I to do now?
When what they tell me is just what they sell me
And I know to be realistic
Will save me from the shock to come
Any fool believes what you tell them
Happiness is being dumb
So we listened to the experts
Everyone needs some kind of guide to help them
See deep inside what am I to do now?
When what they tell me is just what they sell me
And it's not the truth but I'm not calming down
Till my feet touch the ground
So I thought the worst was over
When my heart stopped beating again
And the weak side of my body doubled up
I'm never trusting them
So don't listen to the experts
Cos I've seen they don't know anything
Can you hear the truth ring what am I to do now?

[Chorus]
[Break]
