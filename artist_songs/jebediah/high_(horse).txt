Hey! What are you looking for?
Something fast or something good?
I don’t think that you’re all there
Like a line misunderstood

When I grow up I’ll be indestructible
Taking revenge out on all my enemies
When I get young I’ll be bored and over it
Wasting away all the best years of my life

Now I’m waiting for the lights to change
All these colors look the same

Hey! Where are you going now?
I was still talking to you!
Don’t tell me, you’re out of time
Any old excuse will do

When I grow up I’ll be indestructible
Taking revenge out on all my enemies
When I get young I’ll be bored and over it
Wasting away all the best years of my life

Now I’m waiting for the lights to change
All these colors look the same

Hey! What are you looking for?
Something fast or something good?
I don’t think that you’re all there
Like a line misunderstood
Now I’m bored
Now I’m bored
Now I’m bored and over it
