Going through these old scrapbooks
Its where the pasts been laid to rest
Innocence clashes with ambition puts it to the test

Now it's over
And this is where we've arrived
Most others would just be
Happy that they'd survived
Coz they all want it they want it
But they just don't get it now

Cutting through all the late night stoned up talking of beingblessed
Sure life's got complicated but someday babies must be dressed

Now we've been there
And this is where we've arrived
Most others would just be
Happy that thaey'd survived
Cos they all want it they want it
But they just don't get it now

Get a grip on your true friends
Collect your conciousness
Then maybe

If you want it you want it
You just might get it
