Your eyes are just like mine
I wonder what you're thinking about
I can't figure it out
You climb right up my spine
Just so you can get a better look at what's on my mind

I've got opinions that I can't afford to say
And my words don't really matter anyway

You've been gone for so long do your friends know what's wrong?
Why don't you run away?

Your lies are just like mine
I wonder what you're trying to hide
Tell me what's up inside
Or I'll climb right up your spine just so I can get a better look at what's
on your mind

I'd live on your street but I can't afford the rent
And my memories shot I can't think where it went

You've been gone for so long do your friends know what's wrong?
Why don't you run away?
Now the whites of your eyes give away your disguise
Why don't you run away?

All your friends that you just gotta vist more
The further you're kept away the less it makes you wanna stay

You oughtta know
Yeah now you oughtta know.
