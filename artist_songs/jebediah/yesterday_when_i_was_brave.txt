Yesterday when I was brave
I didn't fold I didn't cave
Gave freedom to every slave
I'd ever harboured

Yesterday when I was strong
I made a right of every wrong
That had been around so long
I'd just got used to

Where do you go
Who do you keep running from
The world has only kept you down

Yesturday when I was brave
I saw a future I could save
Nothing that stood in my way
Could ever stop me

Yesturday anything was
A posssibility because
I believed it so it was
That nothing broke me
