[Verse 1:]
Yeah! 
Benedict sits in his room, Benedict, Ben-Benedict 
Green men are coming soon, Benedict, Ben-Benedict 
He waits for them in the dark, Benedict, Ben-Benedict 
He stands alone in the ball park, Benedict, Ben-Benedict 

[Chorus:]
They didn't wanna find you 
They didn't wanna beat you, beat you 
They didn't wanna find you 
They didn't wanna beat you, beat you 
ohhh..... 

[Verse 2:]

Benedict's losing his head, Benedict, Ben-Benedict 
He keeps it under the bed, Benedict, Ben-Benedict 
His mine will let him know, Benedict, Ben-Benedict 
When it is time to go home, Benedict, Ben-Benedict 

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]

Oh, We're suddenly much better than you [x 3]
Oh, We're suddenly much better...... 

Now you're looking at the new fave 
Now you're going to see the next rave 
Keep on blasting out and go green 
Blame it on the magic brain bean, yeah... 
Ben-ben-ben-ben........... [x 4]
