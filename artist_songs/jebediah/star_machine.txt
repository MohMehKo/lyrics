Been thinking of building a ship to the stars
Found plans made in fourth grade should get me that far
Jesus she says I know what you mean
I'll make you then take you my flying machine
I'm over exposure
I need to levitate
Above this experience
I need to find a way today for far away
There's a simple explanation
For the trouble that we're in
The shed light on all night
The work noise outside
The belief in relief found somewhere to hide
Jesus she says I know what you mean
Don't be scared just prepared
My flying machine

[Pre Chorus]
[Chorus]
Meander
[Chorus]

I've set the date take off's tonight
My star machine takes flight
