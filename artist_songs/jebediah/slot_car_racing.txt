I don't want to sit next to you
I don't want to sit next to you
Don't care what you say or what you want to do
I don't want to sit next to you
Best friend caught you lying
Ooooohhhh
It don't matter what you say
We're not going to go away
I don't want to fight with you
But you make it so easy to
So don't go against your will
If you want to like us still
There's no need to be too cool!

[Verse]
[Chorus]
