I gotta go gotta get away just for the weekend 
I've gotta go cos I just can't stay just for the weekend 
And when I go leave the shit behind just for the weekend 
And may be then something good I'll find just for the weekend 

You've gone and run in the wrong direction [x 2]
Now you're so fallin in love, you're so falling alone 
I don't care this is not my problem 

There's not a lot that I'll have to take just for the weekend 
There's not a smile that I'll have to fake just for the weekend 
And when I go leave the shit behind just for the weekend 
And maybe then find some peice of mind just for the weekend 

You've gone and run in the wrong direction [x 2]
Now you're so fallin in love, you're so falling alone 
I don't care this is not the real thing 

What's forever when I leave 
Wipe myself with my soggy sleave [x 4]
