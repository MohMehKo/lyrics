Think you had it much harder than the rest
Well this is no contest
No this is no contest
All the fighting that's stained inside my head
Will be there till I'm dead
Will be there till I'm dead
Sex slash death is in my head
Be there till I'm dead
I'll spit out what else I'm fed
Did you really want to scar our past
Did you really want to grow so old
Did you really want to make us hurt
Whatsoever I'll put it down to time
And take what's left that's mine
And take what's left that's mine
In the end I guess everyone's the same
And nobody's to blame
And nobody's to blame
Sex slash death is in my head
Be there until I'm dead
I'll spit out what else I'm fed
Did you really want to scar our past
Did you really want to grow so old
Did you really want to make us hurt
