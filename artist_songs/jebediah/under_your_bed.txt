Waking in a cold sweat
Dreaming of the war
Wondering if tomorrow
I’ll be dreaming anymore

‘Cos reds are under your bed
And reds are under your bed
And reds are under your bed
And reds are....yeah

I wanna be different in the morning
‘Cos it doesn’t really look like fun
When everything’s different in the morning
And it doesn’t really look like fun
I wanna be different in the morning
‘Cos it doesn’t really look like fun
Better be different in the morning

Walking in a day dream
Battling the war
Thinking of tomorrow
But I don’t know what it’s for

‘Cos reds are under your bed
And reds are under your bed
And reds are under your bed
And reds are....yeah

I wanna be different in the morning
‘Cos it doesn’t really look like fun
When everything’s different in the morning
And it doesn’t really look like fun
I wanna be different in the morning
‘Cos it doesn’t really look like fun
Better be different in the morning

It doesn’t really look like fun!
It doesn’t really look like fun!
It doesn’t really look like fun!
It doesn’t really look like fun!
