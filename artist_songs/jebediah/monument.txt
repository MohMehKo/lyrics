[Verse 1:]
I'm really gonna pack in this new job I do 
It's gonna be the death of me 
I went to a party of some girl that I knew 
At least the alcohol was free 
With all the family around 
We couldn't find a common ground 
And so we left with what we found 
When we first came so 

[Chorus:]
Where you been, where you been, where'd you go 
Leaving me alone and feeling low 
I'm supposed to be the one you want 
I'm supposed to be the one you want 

[Verse 2:]
I'm supposed to be the one you want 
I know that I don't earn one hundred points in bed 
But will you love me anyway 
It's just that there's so much going on in my head 
That I don't know what to say 
Your car rolled away out of sight 
You can not leave without a fight 
Okay you lose so we were right 
When we first came so 

[Chorus x 2]
