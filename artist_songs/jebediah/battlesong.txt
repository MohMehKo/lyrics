Here we stand in the shadows
With the ghosts been and gone
And the night that surrounds us
Gives away to breaking dawn
If we live, we live standing
Side by side and heart to heart
The lines have been drawn
The cry has rung out

Long before the wretched
Writing on the wall
Nobody was listening
Nobody could hear our call
Living in the fringes
Seemed our best defence
Balking at the battle
Once before but never again

So we march over mountains
Knowing not what lies ahead
With the hope of a future
We brace ourselves for the end
But if we make it to old age
We’ll strip our sleeves and show our scars
Let these wounds speak of our prize

Long before the wretched
Writing on the wall
Nobody was listening
Nobody could hear our call
Living in the fringes
Seemed our best defence
Balking at the battle
Once before but not again

Maybe they are millions
With more to call upon
We can be an army
We can take the whole world on
Not for god or glory
Or riches in the sun
Just to live forever
Always pushing upwards and on

Drawn in to battle test’s the fate of the few
Drawn in to battle we’re an army of two
With too much to lose

Long before the wretched
Writing on the wall
Nobody was listening
Nobody could hear our call
Living in the fringes
Seemed our best defence
Balking at the battle
Once before but not again

Maybe they are millions
With more to call upon
We could be an army
Take the f*ckin’ whole lot on
Not for god or glory
Or riches in the sun
Just to live forever
Always pushing upwards and on
To victory!
Victory!
Victory!
