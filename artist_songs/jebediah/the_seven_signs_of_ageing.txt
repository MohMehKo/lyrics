The seven signs of ageing's gonna strike when you're alone
The seven signs of ageing's gonna shake you to your bones

I hadn't noticed that the lights had changed
I only noticed you were gone a long, long lonely time ago and it really
shook me up
What on Earth had I done?

The seven signs of ageing's gonna strike when you're alone
The seven signs of ageing's gonna shake you to your bones

When you've got the sun in your eyes don't let them see you cry

Some people walk along this avenue with hands in pockets and eyes to ground
Just lost, lost in this city slowly growing old
At least that's what I've found

The seven signs of ageing.
