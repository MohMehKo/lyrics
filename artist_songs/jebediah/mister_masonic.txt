[Verse 1:]
Little man running around town - nothing more to say 
Doing everything the same as you - did it yesterday 
Young man, there because of what you were told to do 
Your Dad and his friends all knew what was right for you 

[Chorus:]
Why do my frustrations get 
Under my skin, this mood that I'm in 
Why do all my fears 
Get thrown back in my face, there stuck in this place 
And we want to be free 
But we just can't see 
We're lost inside 
And we've all gone blind 

[Verse 2:]
Little man, sitting in your room got a box of clay 
Lay it out, shape your thoughts 'cos it is the only way 
Young man, please make what you want if it makes you smile 
Just don't forget it only lasts for a little while 

[Chorus x 2]
