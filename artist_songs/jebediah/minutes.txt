Don't take my love away
It's the only thing I've got.
Take this throat instead,
Coz it isn't worth a lot.

And I'll write it in the sand,
Just so you understand
That the ground that I walk on
Won't be here when you're gone,
And I'll fall into a hole
Failing without you, No matter what you do.
[Repeat]

Minutes to Midnight
The stars are out, the feeling's right.
Minutes to happiness
To you, my truth I must confess.
[Repeat]

Don't take my love away
It's the only thing I've got.
Take this throat instead,
Coz it isn't worth a lot.

And I'll write it in the sand,
Just so you understand
That the ground that I walk on
Won't be here when you're gone,
And I'll fall into a hole
Failing without you, No matter what you do.
