Boy is breaking underneath the weight of strain
This chance he's taking now he's got no one to blame
And suffocating in a blanket of his name

Worlds away from anyone they were burning
themselves out in the sun
Worlds away from anyone they were burning
themselves out in the sun
It was just enough to keep them far away

Boy is burning and the fire just won't go out
And Mars returning sewing all his seeds of doubt
And lesson learning now he's got no voice to shout

Worlds away from anyone they were burning
themselves out in the sun
Worlds away from anyone they were burning
themselves out in the sun
It was just enough to keep them far away

Go on, go on, kick me when I'm down
Go on, go on, there's no one around
Go on, go on, kick me when I'm down
Go on, go on, yeah no one's around

Ice is binding but it's no way to form
Time is winding back how it was before
Ice is binding but it's no way to form
All, all together
Hey hey, what we fighting for?

Worlds away from anyone they were burning
themselves out in the sun
Worlds away from anyone they were burning
themselves out in the sun
It was just enough to keep them far away

Go on, go on kick me when I'm down
Go on, go on kick me when I'm down
Go on, go on kick me when I'm down
Go on, go on kick me when I'm down
Go on, go on
Go on, go on
Go on, go on
Go on, go on
