[Verse 1:]
And the day that we left
I found a whole in my chest
When you said we were only friends, hanging out
What was I sposed to do, I should swallow my pride
and say it's cool, but I'm a fool, I want you....

[Chorus:]

I guess I always knew I would
Like you too much for my good
It gets me when I tell you this but it's true
It's so true [x3] 

[Verse 2:]
And the night that we kissed 
We were both pretty pissed 
But I still knew how good it felt, but did you?
Now I'd do anything, to get you out from underneath my skin
Wishfull thinking, don't want to 

[Chorus]

You......

[Chorus]

It's so true [x2]
