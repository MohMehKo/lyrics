Don't be too alarmed when you hear me raise my voice 
I don't want to do it but you've left me with no choice 
All around me situations that I can't escape 
I'm helpless and I'm feeling that my actions come too late 

You, you... 

I guess sometimes that I fight for all the trouble that I'm in 
But usually I'm certain that all my trash thrown in the bin 
Going over speed limits will make you see the light 
There's no consideration for the fact you're still alive 

oh, you 

It's a trap [x 5]

Don't be too alarmed when you hear me raise my voice 
I don't want to do it but you've left me with no choice 
All around me situations that I can't escape 
I'm helpless and I'm feeling that my actions come too late 

You, you... 

Don't be too alarmed when you hear me raise my voice 
I don't want to do it but you've left me with no choice 
All around me situations that I can't escape 
I'm helpless and I'm feeling that my actions come too late 

You, you... 

It's a trap [x 10]
