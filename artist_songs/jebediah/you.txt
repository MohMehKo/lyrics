Three, Four! 

[Verse 1:]

Well, I don't expect to see you all the time, 
Yeah every second day would still be fine, 
Cos I love all of the funny things that you do, 
I Couldn't think of anything that would be better, 
then being here with you, 

[Chorus:]

You, you, I love the funny things you do, 
You, you, I'm gonna be here through and through, 
You, you, sometimes I wouldn't have a clue, 
You, you, well would I be here without you, 
Without you. 

[Verse 2:]

We can sit around the house and watch TV, 
And all the crazy stories you can tell me, 
Well I probably won't be hearing nothing new, 
But I wouldn't want to listen to anyone else, 
to anyone else yeah but you, 

[Chorus]

Without you 
Oh! 
Break it down 

[Chorus]

Lalalalala 
Oh yeah
