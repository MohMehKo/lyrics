We were doin’ fine
We had everything, the stars and the sunshine
Drinking liquor from the neck of the daytime
From the city to the sea
There was nothing that could hold us back
Falling like the rain for each other
With the hope of a slow train
Memories grew older than smoke stains
There was something going on that
Nothing in the world could change

Where do I go now?
‘Cos I don’t wanna be in control
Where do I go now?
‘Cos I don’t wanna be in control
I don’t wanna be in control again
I don’t wanna be in control
I don’t wanna be in control again

Playing in the sand
Thinking everything we held in our good hands
Was immune to all the stuff that you can’t plan
Now I’m trying to understand
The good to come with moving on

Where do I go now?
‘Cos I don’t wanna be in control
Where do I go now?
‘Cos I don’t wanna be in control
I don’t wanna be in control again
I don’t wanna be in control
I don’t wanna be in control again

I’ll kick my plans to the side of the road
I wanna live more but I can’t let go
I wanna live more
But I can’t let go
[repeat]

I’ll kick my plans to the side of the road
I wanna live more but I can’t let go
I wanna live more but I can’t let go
I wanna live more

Where do I go now?
‘Cos I don’t wanna be in control
Where do I go now?
‘Cos I don’t wanna be in control
I don’t wanna be in control again
I don’t wanna be in control
I don’t wanna be in control again
I don’t wanna be in control
I don’t wanna be in control again
I don’t wanna be in control
I don’t wanna be in control again

Never in control
Never in control
Never in control
