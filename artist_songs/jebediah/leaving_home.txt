[Verse 1:]
Were you laughed at by your friends 
And were you lost for words when everybody finally told you what they thought 
You can't keep up with the trend 
It makes you lose but somehow everybody always makes up in the end 
Oh, was it something that I ate 
Oh, didn't even touch my plate 
Oh, suddenly I'm feeling great 
Do you like me now 

[Chorus:]
Leaving home, life was never good to me 
Leaving home, I smell the morning air 
Leaving home, life was never good 
You can work it out we're leaving home 

[Verse 2:]
I could hear them through the door 
As people came in laughing at the way they acted when they were alone 
And an argument can start with nothing more than this 
To be the light and leave you standing on your own 
Oh, am I doing it again 
Oh, I'm a loser now and then 
Oh, and I smile at everything 
Do you like me now 

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Hope I like the life I find when I leave everything behind 
I hope I'm sure I've made my mind to go and leave home 

[Chorus]
