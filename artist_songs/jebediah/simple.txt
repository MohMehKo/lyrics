[Verse 1:]

I know, what I've found 
What I've found, I know 
It's nice, it feels cool 
It's how it should, simple 

[Chorus:]

Lately I've felt so great 
You're the best drug I take 
My head has gone crazy 
What have you done to me 

Now I know, I know, I learn to breath [x 4]
I learn to breath 

[Verse 2:]

I know, what I've got 
What I've got, won't let go - ha! 
And my thoughts, in my head 
I'm stupid and simple 

[Chorus]

Now I know, I know, I learn to breath [x 4]
I learn to breath 
Well I learn to [x 3]
