On a whim or some fancy
You take me out and you break me
I don’t fit in I feel stupid
Give me a break ‘cos I told you man

I’m f*ckin’ sick of listening
To some rich kids
Playing on their guitars
Their guitars
Their guitars
Their guitars

Tonight, tonight, yeah

Should I yell from the rafters?
Or should I silently yield?
Or should I say what I’m thinking?
Or should I hide how I feel?

‘Cos I’m sick of listening
To all them big men
Banging on their drums
On their drums
On their drums
On their drums

I really lost my nerve tonight
I really lost my nerve tonight, tonight, yeah
I really lost my nerve tonight
I really lost my nerve tonight, tonight, tonight, yeah

I really lost my nerve tonight
I really lost my nerve tonight, tonight, tonight, yeah
I really lost my nerve tonight
I really lost my nerve tonight, tonight, tonight, yeah

I really lost my nerve
