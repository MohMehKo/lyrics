One night to make it up
One night to break it up
One thing that takes me away
One reason to make it ok
I like the things of old
Like a night on sixties soul

One night to make it up
One reason is never enough
There's a way to live
and there's a way of dying

One thing that I can't stand
Another jealous big hair band
One thing that I hate most
Your hurting the ones close oh no

Don't like the way you look
Don't want to read your book
Spat in the hand I shook
Don't want your new hook
There's a way to live
and there's a way of dying out

Contradiction is my name
When I fall down and I get up it both feels the same
When you play thier game
It all feels the same

And the time for choosing's now
What will you do
