[Verse 1:]

I know I've said things I didn't mean to say 
And I know I've done thing I didn't mean to do 
I'm stupid, pathetic 
Sometimes I say, things that I never mean to say 
And sometimes I do things I don't wanna do 
But we can leave that out 

[Chorus:]

I'm waiting for the early sign 
That signals everything is fine 
I've rocked the boat enough I know 
To make a scene and spoil the show 

[Verse 2:]

I get jealous, way too easy all the time 
And over zealous, way to easy on time 
Before I see things straight 
Sometimes I say things I never mean to say 
And sometimes I do somethings I don't wanna do 
But we can leave that out 

[Chorus x 2]

The show, the show, the show...
