[Intro:]
[Spoken:] Ready? 
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la 

[Verse 1:]
Almin's late, he's late again 
Well he probably won't show, it's just not fair 
Almin's late, he's late again 
Well he probably won't show, it's just not fair 

[Chorus:]
There's no time, there's no time 
There's no time, there's no time 
There's no time, there's no time 
There's no time, there's no time
