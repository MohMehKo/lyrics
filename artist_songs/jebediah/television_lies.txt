You're television lies to you
so stoke the hype machine and let the show begin.
They've got the life that dreams are made of.
Throw in you're hand this is a game you'll never win.
Oh yeah! Call that something? I call it nothing!
You're television lies to you,
feeding you're fantasies of how you wanna live.
Reality's got less attraction.
To have it all there's nothing that you wouldn't give.
Cos the pretty boys and pretty girls never lose and have more fun.
Call that something? I call it nothing!
So forget the free advice m'man 'cos the damage has been done.
Call that something? I call it nothing, no!
You're television lies to you
so stoke the hype machine and let the show begin.
They've got the life that dreams are made of.
Throw in you're hand this is a game you'll never win.
