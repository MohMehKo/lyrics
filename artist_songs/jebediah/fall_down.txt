Thought police have busted in
And broken up and stolen almost everything
They've a job to do a special mission
To reinstate their point of view
It's in with the old order out with the new

They're the guys that wrote that song
That's been playing on the airwaves all day long
It's a catchy tune hummable melody
And you can't drive it from your brain
It's got a chorus that repeats over and over again

Window, opportunity
I got a message and it comes for free
There's another way that way is real
But you just won't get it till the walls fall down
