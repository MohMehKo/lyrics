[Verse 1:]

I'm on parade, you don't say: why can't you see that 
Keeping my feelings at bay: why can't you see that when 

When you're around, you just get me down, I'm better off without you [x 2]
I'm just better off... 

[Verse 2:]

All of the years add up to: why can't you see that 
Something has happened to you: why can't you see that when 

When you're around, you just get me down, I'm better off without you [x 4] 
You just get me down 

It's not me, it can't be 
I'd rather leave 
It's getting hard, to be a part 
Of what is around 
Is this the situation of the time 
If so you can have yours, I want mine 
I know there's something better you could be 
Now I am past caring, completely 

When you're around, you just get me down, I'm better off without you [x 4]
