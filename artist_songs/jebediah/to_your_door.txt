Everyday I wake up to the
Strangest feeling
Everything is happening again
Looking in the mirror at my
Own reflection
Scared that I don’t recognize a thing

Now you’re gone
Now you’re gone

I try to catch the bus but it’s the
Wind I’m hailing
Everyone and no one looks at me
And if I could convince someone to
Take me somewhere
I could be arriving on your street

Now you’re gone I’m just a
Shadow of my past
And I can’t wait to get

To your door
To your door I run
To your door
To your door I run
To your door
To your door I run
To your door
To your door

Everyday I wake up it’s the
Same old story
Everything is happening again
And if I could convince someone to
Take me some place
It’s my face that you’d see coming clean

Now you’re gone I’m just a
Shadow of my past
And I can’t wait to get

To your door
To your door I run
To your door
To your door I run
To your door
To your door I run
To your door
To your door
