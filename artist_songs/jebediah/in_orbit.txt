You don't wanna know
The truth will only hurt you
And I don't wanna go
Back down the road I hate to
I've been trying for so long
To deal with what I've done
You say you want a song? 
Well here you go, have this one

I'm a boy with an endless lie
View the world through my bad black eyes
But its alright if its alright

Don't mean to be mean
OK go on just say us
Exactly what I've been
Your right, I don't know it
Its immaturity
And I can't wash my clean conscience
The truth is killing me
Could it make any difference

I'm a boy with an endless lie
View the world through my bad black eyes
But its alright if its alright

I'm a boy with an endless lie, but its alright
