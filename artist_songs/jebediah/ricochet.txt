You are everything
Everything you are
You bleed like a saint
To shine like a star
I am everywhere you are when I can
Front row every show
I'm your biggest fan

When everything
Gets blown away
Bouncing off the walls
My heart ricochets
While soundwaves speed
Right through my veins
My face hits the floor
Its happening again

Pass this message on
It's for you from me
For nobody else
Just for you to see
My lifes soundtrack is in your hands
Don't go anywhere
Don't make any plans
