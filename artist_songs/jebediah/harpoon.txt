[Verse 1:]

This will take some explaining but I think you will agree 
There is no use pretending that there's hope for you and me 

[Chorus:]

And I love her, but do you think she can see 
When I tell her, it's the end for you and me 
It was over, ever since you went and shot me 

Like a harpoon 
Like a harpoon 
Like a harpoon in my heart.... 

Like a harpoon 
Like a harpoon in my heart 

[Verse 2:]

Yeah 

I can handle the fighting, it's the affection I can't stand 
And I don't mind us talking, just don't try and touch my hand 

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]

When you left I didn't want you back 
But now your gone so won't you come right back 
Come right back [x 5]

[Chorus]

Why does it hurt 
Simple matters don't seem worth 
We're the same but it's not happening again 

[Chorus]
