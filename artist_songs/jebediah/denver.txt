[Verse 1:]
I was never good at what I do 
I'm not the one whose hurting you 
I was always pushing the pram 
So you could kiss the crosswalk man 

[Chorus:]
Didn't mean to hurt anone at all 
Didn't want to do anything at all 
All, all..... 
Didn't mean to hurt anone at all 
Didn't want to do anything at all 
All, all..... to, all, all.... 

[Verse 2:]
Just slip and fall and get away 
Never listen to what I say 
We are so different, you're so blind 
You won't get in my fucking mind 

[Chorus x2]
