Panic in the night
Trying to make things right
Still you wonder why
All your crystal gazing
Could learn you things
You wouldn’t wanna know

So don’t start
Freakin’ out
About what you deserve
No don’t start
Freakin’ out
About what you deserve

On the street below
The city static grows
And life just comes and goes
All your crystal gazing
Could learn you things
You wouldn’t wanna know

So don’t start
Freakin’ out
About what you deserve
No don’t start
Freakin’ out
About what you deserve
About what you deserve
About what you deserve

‘Cos there’s a fine line to reason
And there’s a long way to go
When you can make sense of nothing
And when you live and die alone
But if you don’t look back
And if you stop trying to figure it all out
You’ll never need to know

So don’t start
Freakin’ out
About what you deserve
No don’t start
Freakin’ out
About what you deserve
About what you deserve
About what you deserve
About what you deserve
