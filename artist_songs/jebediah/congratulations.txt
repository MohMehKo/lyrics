He's coming round tonight
Catching the train out
Started work today
It's no fun but it pays
One thing that you're sure of
He won't ever let you down
S'posed to leave at eight
But the sitters late
Times run out to go
To that Even show
One thing that you're sure of
He won't ever let you down
He could never hurt you
But it's so much to get involved
I drowned in glory to tell this story
Of self denial and choices final
He was there for you
When your ex shot through 
But can you really count
On him sticking round?
One thing that you're sure of
He won't ever let you down
He could never hurt you
But it's so much to get involved
I drowned in glory to tell this story
Of self denial and choices final
Can't change what happened my youths been shattered
Now can I really bring him down with me
He can't play father to your son
When he's eighteen years young!
I drowned in glory to tell this story
Of self denial and choices final
Can't change what happened my youth's been shattered
Now can I really bring him down with me.
