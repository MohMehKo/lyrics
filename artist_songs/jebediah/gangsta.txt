He wakes up cold in the morning
Another day on the run
Making sure his double life
Don't come undone

His hands are full but there's nothing
To show for every late night
Spent running from his shadow
Just get it right Just get it right

Now you're in further than you've ever been before
Little big lie
Further than you've ever been before
Just another little lie

A nervous walk through the city
He got to cover his tracks
Check for familiar faces
Better watch your back

He got no rest now he's wicked
Just toss and turn every night
Going over his stories
To get em right just get it right

That's what I'm talk'n about fucker
A great big dirty lie
