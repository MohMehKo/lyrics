Falling out again
Just when everything was working out
And it's all because of me
Cos I like the way it feels to live in doubt
It's high time I start to learn
To live my life with a poker face and then
All these emotional feelings I can't ignore
Aren't on display to the whole world anymore
Am I Happier Sad?
It's all over and done
And I'm warm inside my melancholy mind
Kinda feels secure
The best cure for a heartache I can find
