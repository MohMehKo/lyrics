I walk along the avenue 
i never thought I'd meet a girl like you 
with Auburn hair and tormy eyes 
the kind of eyes that hypnotize me through 
and I ran I ran so far away 
I just ran, I ran all night and day 
I couldn't get away 

a cloud appears above your head 
a beam of light comes shining down on you 
the cloud is moving nearer still 
Aurora Borealis comes in view 
and I ran I ran so far away 
I just ran, I ran all night and day 
I couldn't get away 

reached out a hand to touch your face 
you're slowly dissappearing from my view 
reached out hand to try again 
i'm floating in a beam of light with you 
and I ran I ran so far away 
I just ran, I ran all night and day 
I couldn't get away 
and I ran I ran so far away 
I just ran, 
I couldn't get away
