Long ago in days gone by
It was much simpler for the guy
And when The Cure sang "Boy's don't cry"
I said I had something in my eye

You were right when you said I was wrong
It's over

And right before the storm I told you everything
I know thats not good form but feeling is the most peculiar sport
I might get bored but I could never tell you that it's over

Spent too long staring out for stars
I lost control and crashed my car
I hadn't even got that far
Left my good fortune at the bar

You were right when you said I was wrong
It's over

And right before the storm I told you everything
I know that's not good form but feeling is the most peculiar sport
I might get bored but I could never tell that it's over

It's over.
