After the night
Another sun
Rises above everyone
And all that is left
Are lingering breaths
Of all that has been and all that
We’ve become

I’m looking for signs
In everything
To tell me somehow
I’ve done the right thing
Call me crazy
I often do
It feels so weird being without you

Time slips away
Gone the days we’ll never see again
I don’t care ‘cos we were there and I’ll
Always feel the same
And that’s where it can remain
As long as we’re okay
Are we okay?

Switch off the lights
Turn off the taps
Send ‘em all home
Let’s leave it at that
I’ve got a confession
It’s not an excuse
I don’t know what the future holds

Time slips away
Gone the days we’ll never see again
I don’t care ‘cos we were there and I’ll
Always feel the same
And that’s where it can remain
As long as we’re okay
Are we okay?

As long as we’re okay
As long as we’re okay
As long as we’re okay
Are we okay?
