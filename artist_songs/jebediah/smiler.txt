[Verse 1:]
Smile when you want and tell me your happy 
Laugh when you want to tell me your true 
Smile when you want and tell me your happy 
Laugh when you want and tell me your through 

[Pre-Chorus:]
I'm not happy, I'm not happy, I'm not happy 

[Verse 2:]
Smile when you want and tell me your happy 
Laugh when you want to share your brew 
Smile when you want to make it all crappy 
Laugh when you want to tell me I'm through 

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus:]
You know, you know 
Tell me what's all about, tell me what's it all about 
You know, you know 
Tell me what's all about, tell me what's it all about 
You know, you know 
Tell me what's all about, tell me what's it all about 
You know, you know 
What's it all about? 

[Verse 3:]
Smile when you want to tell me your happy 
Laugh when you want to tell me your through 
Smile when you want to make it all sappy 
Laugh when you want to tell me we're through 

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus x 2]
