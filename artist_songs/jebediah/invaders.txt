[Verse 1:] 

It was in the evening, or was it afternoon 
It doesn't really matter, they were in my room 

No there no here to save you [x3]
No there not 

[Chorus:]

One by one 
They tricked me one by one 
They stripped me one by one 
They fixed me one by one 
Invaders picked me 

[Verse 2:]

I thought that I should go now but I just had to stay 
Stick around and listen to what they had to say 

No we're not going to hurt you [x3]
No we're not 

[Chorus]

[Change:]

Ohhhh, arrggghhh, oohhh 
Invaders, Invaders, Invaders, Invaders........ 

Ooh, I like their eyes, like buggy flies 
Their purple skies, where no one dies, 
Their silken hair, and what they wear 
Without a care for nothing 

Say that you care but you fucking don't 
And you say that you care but you fucking don't 
And you say that you care but you fucking don't 
And you say that you care but you fucking don't 

Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah...... [etc.]
[Backing:] Watch out for invaders...
