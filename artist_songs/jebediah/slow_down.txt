Slow down, I can't understand a word 
That you've said to me just then 
Please repeat yourself again 
I know, thinmgs have got a little rough 
But there's worse things that could be 
Could you ever say to me 
Sometimes, you have gone too far (too far) 

Paint me a picture of what I know [x 2]
Slow down [x 2] 

Slow down, we forgot the time to spare 
And there's nowhere you can hide 
When you're lost for me inside 
I've seen that you'll sadly have to make 
It can only come to waste 
Someone leaves and someone stays 
Oh, ho, you don't go to far (too far) 

Paint me a picture of what I know [x 2]
Slow down [x 4]
