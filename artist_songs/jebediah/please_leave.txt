Those things you said are getting to me
I closed my eyes so I couldn't see
I'm used to all the crap that you dish out
I know exactly what its about

You didn't want to come across the sea
Dragged by your hair, it got worse, you got me
Now everything is cool up until when
Accidentally screw up your life again

Its not that I don't want you around
But you act as if we're bringing you down
Maybe you don't have the guts to go
Maybe you just don't want me to know

You didn't want to come across the sea
Dragged by your hair, it got worse, you got me
Now everything is cool up until when
Accidentally screw up your life again

"You can't blame us for everything
We're not stopping you from living
So pack your bags and take a chance
To leave, to leave, to leave to leave
And someday when you think of me
Remember that I was happy
Until the day I learned to see
Please leave, please leave, please leave, please leave
And someday when you think of me
Remember that I was happy
Until the day I learned to see
Please leave, please leave, please leave, please leave"
