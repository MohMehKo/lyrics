Guess I lose again
It's hard when
You're losin' to yourself
Guess I'm scared to trust
But I must
Or I'll have nothing left

Ohh...

Something's wrong with me
There must be
'Cause nothing's going right
Always wait for them
And only then
Do I go further by

Ohh, ohh, ohh...

I saw it coming
And I tried to turn you around
I saw it coming
And I tried to turn you around
I saw it coming
And I tried to turn you loose

Here I am again
Staying friends
So I can still hang around
Hoping for the best
Call it youthful zest
And someday I'll get down
Ohh, ohh, ohh...

I saw it coming
And I tried to turn you around
I saw it coming
And I tried to turn you around
I saw it coming
And I tried to turn you loose

Ohh, ohh...

Waking up
Is not the same
Going out
Is not the same
Pain removal
Is not the same
It's not the same

I saw it coming
And I tried to turn you around
I saw it coming
And I tried to turn you around
I saw it coming
And I tried to turn you
