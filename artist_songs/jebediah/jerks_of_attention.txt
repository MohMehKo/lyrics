[Verse 1:]
There is no pain, my bodies drained 
I never should of had that fourth slice straight 
We gathered round, the lost and found 
But my jerks of attention let me down 

[Pre-Chorus:]
Well I took the first one, 
And I pulled it back. 
And what was once green 
Had all turned black, had all turned black 
And there was nothing left to say. 

[Chorus:]
I'm ten foot tall, the world's so small 
I know it all when I'm wasted 
What you see, inside of me 
Has been set free when I'm wasted, wasted. 

[Verse 2:]
I'm getting there, my constant stare 
And I don't think I'll move from this chair 
We've got them both, Archers of loaf 
And the Stone Roses in the stereo 

[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus x 2]

Wasted, wasted 
Wasted, wasted 

[Chorus]

I don't want to be straight, don't want to be straight 
I don't want to be wasted, wasted, wasted, don't:
