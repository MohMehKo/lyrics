I'm not going to wait for the beating of my heart
It takes too long for that broken pump to start
When you get off that plane will you still be mine
When we're both home again
And I'm not gonna cry cos there's never any use
I spent too long obsessing over self abuse
When you get off that plane will you still be mine
When we're both home again and we've run out of time
I've got my arm around but it don't feel the same
Cos I'm never gonna be on my own again
I've embraced a new beginning its you until the end
I'm in love, love, love
Love At last.
I know the doubts you have when the distance gets you down
It'd be easier if I wasn't still around
Know our time will come if we can get through all of this
How long can you hang on to another last promise
