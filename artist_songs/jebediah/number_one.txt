Now brains and emotion have never been friends
If you ask my opinion it always depends
Better hang on to what you go

Now love and confusion have always been true
I hate to break the illusion but what can you do
Better hang on to what you got

You had girl you'd give anything for
One more chance
But you threw it away
You've got yourself to blame

Now i've never been one for giving advice
In a strange situation don't start thowing dice
Better hang on to what you got
