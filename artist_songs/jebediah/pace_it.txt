Can't everything be like before
When it overcomes me
Can't everything be like before
When it overcomes me 

Can't see it, Can't feed it
Can't steal it, Can't keep it
Can't everything be like before
When it overcomes me

Can't everything be like before
When it overcomes me
Can't everything be like before
When it overcomes me 

Can't freeze it, Can't need it
Can't keep it, Can't deal with it

Oh can you feel it
Something comin' closer to you're body
Oh can you see it
Someone's taken over from where you started
Oh can you see it
Something comin' closer to you're body
Oh can you see it
Someone's taken over from where you started
Oh can you see it

Can't everything be like before
When it overcomes me
Can't freeze it, Can't need it
Can't keep it, Can't deal with it

Can't everything be like before
When it overcomes me...
