Some things will stay the same 
The shape of a power point won't change 
And i won't back away and run 
If you make me feel strange 
She's the hand at the end of the arm 
And she's got a lot to say 
She thinks the world is falling apart 
But that's okay she just wants to be happy 
A place for everything and everything in its place 
I get better, wait and see 
She amazes me it's kinda hard to see in here 
But there's nothing to see so who cares? 
Drank coffee all night and now i can't sleep 
I think i opened a secret file i let her look for a little while 
And now i'm waiting for the ambulance to arrive 
She just wants to be happy a place for everything 
And everything in its place i had better wait and see 
She amazes me 
I couldn't understand the instructions 
And the clock sounds like it's ticking slow 
And this book is in another language 
A language i don't know I used to tie double knots 
But now i couldn't be fucked things are getting stupider all the time 
She just wants to be happy 
A place for everything and everything in its place 
I had better wait and see she amazes me, you're confusing me 
You're confusing me
