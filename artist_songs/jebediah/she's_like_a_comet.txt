Starting a fire
Secret admirers
Stolen exchanges
Measured denial
I hope you come around
Coming and going
Every moment
Falls through the sky
Erupting and glowing
I hope you come around
I hope you come around

Just like something
Comes out of nothing
She ain’t the done thing
Yeah she’s different

Nervous and twitching
Sparks and emissions
Keeping a finger
On the ignition
I hope you come around
Brother to sister
Sister to brother
Far and away
Orbiting each other
I hope you come around
I hope you come around

Just like something
Comes out of nothing
She ain’t the done thing
Yeah she’s different
Oh she’s like a comet
Oh she’s like a comet
Oh she’s like a comet
Yeah she’s different

Nervous and twitching
Sparks and emissions
Keeping her finger
On the ignition
I hope you come around
Coming and going
Every moment
Falls through the sky
Erupting and glowing
I hope you come around
I hope you come around

Just like something
Comes out of nothing
She ain’t the done thing
Yeah she’s different
Oh she’s like a comet
Oh she’s like a comet
Oh she’s like a comet
Yeah she’s different
Yeah she’s different
Yeah she’s different
