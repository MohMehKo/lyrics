In light of recent trends come gather round your friends
So much to talk about but words just won't come out
Oh no
The future is heel bent it won't stop when you say "when"
This atmosphere is staid just why are we so afraid?

Cos we're always impatient with the mess we created
And we're always frustrated or something

But you can sew your life back together
You can sew your life back

In light of recent trends come gather round your friends
Cos something's going wrong it hits just like a bomb

Cos we're always elated with the prize overstated
It's like we're always inflated or something

But you can sew your life back together
You can sew your life back
