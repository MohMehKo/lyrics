I've been doing the strangest dreaming
I left not knowing where I was going
And you're so misty and I'm so twisted by the way I feel
I'm spinning like a wheel
My love is so surreal
Walked for ages through different stages
Of all my failures and past disclaimers
And in this city being lost aint pretty like it used to be
Now when my mind is free
Things get on top of me

Oh, I'm more alone when I'm with you
There, you got me

There's no hiding the future's riding
On coming clean with the past I'm fighting
Cos when you're with me I'm forced to see me as I really am
I'm not s'posed to be thinking of you
Atleast not this way but now it's too late
And you're so misty and I'm so messed up in this reverie
I'm never gonna be all that I hoped I'd be

Oh, I'm more alone when I'm with you
There, you got me

I'm done with holding out for the sky
Oppurtunity passes me by
Cos it's true you don't think of me
The way I think of you
Come on admit it it's true

Oh, I'm more alone when I'm with you
There, you got me
