[Verse 1:]
Hey, I don't know what to say, I think of you each day 
And in my loneliness, I don't know what is best 

[Chorus:]
Maybe I might pretend, I'm going round the bend 
And many a lot will heal, on the ferris wheel 

[Verse 2:]
Hey, I'm losing it again, a lack of oxygen 
I'll take you for a ride, and sit with you inside 

[Chorus x 2]
