There's a first time for everything
You don't have to be the alter boy to sing
There's a last time for nothing
Until you die ofcourse in which case there may be

But I'm holding on to the learning and the reading I've been doing
About what awaits us on the other side

There's a first time for everything
So if you want it don't be shy girl just jump in
You might find out if you do nothing
You'll regret it for as long as you're living

And I know that it's not easy to believe in what I'm saying
But if we're gonna make it we just gotta try

When on a losing streak day will everything wind up ok?
This could be the end of the line or this could be just like our first time
I've been a fool for so long
Could something so right be so wrong?
This could be the end of the line
Let's make it just like our first time

And I know that it's not easy to believe me, lord knows I agree
To the point where I can't even believe it myself
Believe it myself
But if you do I will
But if you do, yeah if you do
There'll be a first time!
