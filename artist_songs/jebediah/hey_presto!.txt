She starts out motherly taking you out for tea.
You get you're drinks for free hey presto happy families!
Sometimes when she's not right she pulls her purse strings tight.
And then we get into a fight, we're losing her again oh!
The world is all she wants, never before has she needed us more.
Things used to be different when we were happy friends.
Even the times it was pretend, still happy in the end.
When did it all go wrong? Was it wrong all along?
When did we stop turning you on?
We're losing her again, oh!
The world is all she wants, never before has she needed us more.
