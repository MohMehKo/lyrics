There will never be an ending but there's always change so all the things that you’re defending
have been rearranged but it's so hard to talk to you you’re never there
With my adjusted way of thinking I shouldn't care

Now I know that nothing lasts forever so long everything's going to be that much better now I know that nothing lasts
forever everything's going to be that much better you're the one that should be saying sorry all you ever did was make me want to talk to you

These are moments I can't get over so how can you ever look over your shoulder
Find something new or are you playing best defence with armour on you can only take a beating
Don't prove me wrong

Now I know that nothing lasts forever so long everything's going to be that much better now I know that nothing lasts
forever everything's going to be that much better you're the one that should be saying sorry all you ever did was make me want to talk to you

And that's why when we talk about the past I could sit with you for hours
And that's why I say that we'll never be the same but I can't explain forever
Nothing ever stays the same feelings just get in the way
Every hour of every day when there's no more left to say
You can watch your colours fade but you can't sit still forever
You can't sit still

It's all over and been, I'm not lesser within won't change anything so stop worrying
