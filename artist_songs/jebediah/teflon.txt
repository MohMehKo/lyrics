We were going along 
To a particular song 
Just hanging around 
Feet scuffing the ground 
Catching us on a roll 
We were collecting the dole 
Doesn't mean something's wrong 

We were just slipping along 
Slipping along 
Slipping along 
Yeah 
Slipping along 

At a party we found 
People hanging around 
There was nothing to do 
We were smoking a few 
Saw two girls outside 
They were both pretty wired 
I thought something was wrong 
But they were just getting it on 

Slipping along 
Yeah 
Slipping along 
1, 2, 3, 4 
So long, 
I'm slipping on, and on 
Yeah
