[Verse 1:]
I'm sorry that I fucked things up 
And I'm sorry that sorry is never enough 
But still I'm sorry I screwed your plans 
But if everythings cool then I know not we could do 
Yeah lets walk down to the school 
We can watch the kids run home 
And pretend that we're alone 
Just like we used to be then 

[Chorus:]
But it's harder to go back right now 
Cos you never really know how 
And the things that you once knew then 
Go and change and then change again 
But it's harder to go back right now 
Cos you never really know how 
And the things that you once knew then 
Go and change and then change again 

[Verse 2:]
I'm sorry that I wasted your time 
And I'm sorry I wish you'd go waste mine 
But that won't happen (won't happen) cos you're too nice 
And the things that you do that I always thought were cool 
Now I know it's only you so it's me that's been the fool 
Cos I never even knew that's why I hate myself right 

[Chorus]
