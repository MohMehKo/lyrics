Gonna build a big beer wall
It's gonna be fifteen feet tall
Build it strong so it won't fall
Gonna build a big beer wall

Gonna build a big beer wall
Wouldn't do to build it small
Got a feeling it's my call
So I'm gonna build a big beer wall

Big beer wall, big beer wall
Gonna build myself a big beer wall
Big beer wall, big beer wall
Gonna build myself a big beer wall

Gonna build a big beer wall
It's gonna be fifteen feet tall
Got a feeling it's my call
So I'm gonna build a big beer wall

Big beer wall, big beer wall
Gonna build myself a big beer wall
Big beer wall, big beer wall
Gonna build myself

Big beer wall
Big big Beer wall
Big beer wall
Big beer wall
Big beer wall
Big beer wall
Big beer wall
