First comes the call we’re going out on the lash
And you can come back to mine if you need a place to crash
Got some friends in town saying they can make it better
Well I guess that’s what you get for tryin’ to make a splash

You kiss kiss your consequence
Your consequence good night
You kiss kiss your consequence good night

She’s just a friend
Who burns to the end
She just goes on and on and on
And just like a friend
I rush to defend
We’ll just go on and...

Chase it
Find it
Taste it
Don’t waste it

You kiss kiss your consequence
Your consequence good night
You kiss kiss your consequence good night

She’s just a friend
Who burns to the end
She just goes on and on and on
And just like a friend
I rush to defend
We’ll just go on and on and on

Kiss it goodnight!
Kiss it goodnight!
Kiss it goodnight!

Wake up, pause, reflect
Last night I called you collect
It’s good to know when you go we can always connect

She’s just a friend
Who burns to the end
She just goes on and on and on
And just like a friend
I rush to defend
We’ll just go on and on and on
She’s just a friend
Who burns to the end
She just goes on and on and on
And just like a friend
I rush to defend
We’ll just go on and on and on
