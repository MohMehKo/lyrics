There are people I know
They don't seem to mind or if they do, it don't show
But I can't sleep at night
Unless I know it's your talk talk time

I know I'm so paranoid
But I've been that way since I was a boy
Knee high, stage fright
Even if you're alright
I've got to be

The first to know
The first to know
The first to know
The first to know
The first to know

I know it was a long time ago
You left on your own
You kerb crawled home
And I still kick myself now
Should have never allowed
You out of my sight

And I cross my heart and hope to die
If anything happens to you
When you're out of my sight
Wanna be the guy who steps in the way
When you're in harm's way
I wanna be

The first to know
The first to know
The first to know
The first to know
The first to know

And if you want some space just squeeze my hand, girl
I understand
You don't have to lie, we're on the same side, girl

I don't wanna be a ball and chain
But I'm just afraid of change
And I'm not ashamed
But if you think I wanna hold you back
You should know me better than that

I just wanna be the first the know
The first to know
The first to know
The first to know
The first to know
The first to know
The first to know
The first to know
The first to know
