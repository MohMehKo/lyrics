Agnes it all ended up in tears 

Well we were an odd couple you and I 
In our strange and original attire 
I thought, I thought it was love at first sight 
My mother, my mother, she shivered with fright 

Well I couldn't tell if you were boy or girl 
My mind was in such a swirl 
I couldn't tell if you were boy or girl 
True love roams, it roams where it will 

Alas, oh Agnes 
I still adore you, oh Agnes 
Oh Agnes, oh Agnes, oh Agnes, oh Agnes 

Agnes it all ended up in tears 
Mind, you still have your souvenirs 
You've got scars from head to toe 
It's getting hard to tell your friends from foe 

Well, you picked me up at King's Cross station 
After my backstreet operation 
You broke me, you broke the painful news 
You dumped me, you dumped me for a pretty young muse 

Well my lessons they are there to learn 
My scars are caused by cigarette burns 
I have no memories and I spend all day 
Balancing the porcelain 

Alas, oh Agnes 
I still adore you, oh Agnes 
Oh Agnes, oh Agnes, oh Agnes, oh Agnes 

Oh Agnes I adore you 
Oh Agnes I adore you 
Oh Agnes I adore you 
Oh Agnes I still adore you
