Sister Everett
We shared bible class and cigarettes
Sister Everett
You were so good to know but hard to get
Sister Everett
Walk on water but you still get wet
Sister Everett
You break my heart each time you break the bread
We don’t need cars and money
To take the road to heaven
We’ll live off milk and honey
And give up our possessions
Yes we will, yes we will
Sister Everett
You said live your life with no regret
Sister Everett
Well, how can I live my life now that we've met?
Sister Everett
Would you compromise the things you love?
Sister Everett
For these angels and the kingdom come
Mother Mary
Is she gonna save me?
My Mother Mary
You know I get so lonely, lonely
Oh Mother Mary
