They say if you leave a horse alone it dies
Nestles into the hay and shuts it's eyes
Well I've dreamt of being that horse a hundred times
And I end up a pile of bones and a cloud of flies
And when you're nine years old you don't care
If your on your own or one of a pair
And when you get salt in your eyes, sand in your hair
Call for mum or daddy they'll be there

Please don't turn me into a man
'Cause I don't want to see my skin fold
Oh please wont you keep me as I am
Oh people look so lonely when they're old, when they're old

When you come of age it's not the same
No umbrella over your head when it rains
And your friends would rather get high than play a game
Oh it's such a shame the way they change
And Emily's hung over, Bill feels rough
Thinks his girlfriend might be up the duff... again
She threw up twice last night on the bus
And I never thought growing old could be so tough

Oh please don't turn me into a man
'Cause I don't want to see my skin fold
Oh please wont you keep me as I am
Oh people look so lonely when they're old, when they're old
