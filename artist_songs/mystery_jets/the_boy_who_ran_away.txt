There was a boy who ran away 
from what he didn't know 
And whom he wouldn't say he just had to go 
Something it snapped inside of him as he fled from a nameless threat 
Crowds of people stand aloof in Waterloo there's no sunset 
And when he gets to that mythic place the streets are 
dirty dark and deep 
There is no rest there is no place to lay a head to sleep 
There was a boy who ran away from what he didn't know 
And whom he wouldn't say he just had to go 
I went to so much trouble to banish you from my side 
He said that your an accident 
an accident about which I should forget 
And now that the wheel has gone around he's back where he belongs 
And he knows there is no hope only solace in the words of this song 
There was a boy who ran away from what he didn't know 
And whom he wouldn't say he just had to go
