When you walk into the room
Girls growl, boys swoon
You're the spark that lights the gloom
And my heart sings to your tune

But I flash my hungry smile
And it makes you run a mile

Have you heard the birds and bees?
Have all caught STD's
I'm begging darling please
I wanna see you on your knees

But all you've got to do is do it
To know there's really nothing to it
All you've got to is do it now

But I flash my hungry smile
And it makes you run a mile

When the hour's getting late
You open up your garden gate
If love is just a race
I never seem to come first place

But all you got to do is do it
To know there's really nothing to it
If you don't you'll just regret it
But if you do you won't forget it

All you got to do is do it
To know there's really nothing to it
Well, all you got to do is do it now

Come back to me no need to hide
Make a little room for me tonight
Come back to me no need to hide
Come back to me no need to hide
Make a little room for me tonight

Come back, come back
Come back, come back
Come back
