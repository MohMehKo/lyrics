Now through the darkness
I have become
The very thing from which
I have always tried to run
And in the past, well
What's done is done
You can revisit it now
But my heart will never be one

One thing's for sure 
You are what you ignore
Think I hear the future banging 
Down upon your door
I used to think that 
Through thick and thin
There would always be a place
From which you could begin

Was that the time to stop or carry on regardless?
I always heard you saying that
It's better to light a candle
Than to curse the darkness

In the almost silence
I thought I heard
The universe conspiring
With your every word
And on the TV
Working back for more
Still in 1989
You threw his stuff out on the lawn

Was that the time to stop or carry on regardless?
I always heard you saying that
It's better to light a candle
Than to curse the darkness
