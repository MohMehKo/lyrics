So here we are once again
Different but your luminescence
Effervescent color still remains

And I know we still share the same
Crimson colored
Poisonous blood in our veins

You still swim around the canals
In my head like cocaine
And yes, it feels good but not half
As it would had you stayed

But the more that you need it
The less that you feel the pain
But it's not the coke, it's the lump
In my throat that's to blame

While we've been hiding out in the dark
The bloody consummation of our love has concealed the scar
Of where we were once pulled apart
An intoxicated magnetism that reignites the old spark

You still swim around the canals
In my head like cocaine
And yes, it feels good but not half
As it would had you stayed

But the more that I need it
The less that I feel the pain
Each day, older I get
A step closer to forgetting your name

But I won't, no I won't
No I won't, no I won't
No I won't, no I won't
No I won't, no I won't
No I won't, no I won't
No I won't, no I won't
