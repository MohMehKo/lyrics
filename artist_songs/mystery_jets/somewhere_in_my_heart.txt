Summer in the city where the air is still
A baby bein' born to the overkill
Well, who cares what people say?
We walk down love's motorway
Ambition and love, wearin' boxin' gloves
And singin' hearts and flowers
But somewhere in my heart
There is a star that shines for you
Silver splits the blue
Love will see it through
And somewhere in my heart
There is the will to set you free
All you've got to be is true
A star above the city in the northern chill
A baby bein' born to the overkill
No say, no place to go
A TV and a radio
Ambition and love, wearin' boxin' gloves
And singin' hearts and flowers
But somewhere in my heart
There is a star that shines for you
Silver splits the blue
Love will see it through
And somewhere in my heart
There is the will to set you free
And all you've got to be is true
Who could heal what's never been as one?
And our hearts have been torn
Since the day we were born
Just like anyone
From Westwood to Hollywood
The one thing that's understood
Is that you can't buy time but you can sell your soul
And the closest thing to heaven is to rock and roll
And somewhere in my heart
There is a star that shines for you
Silver splits the blue
Love will see it through
And somewhere in my heart
There is the will to set you free
All you've got to be is true
Somewhere in my heart
There is a star that shines for you
Silver splits the blue
Love will see it through
And somewhere in my heart
There is the will to set you free
All you've got to be is true
