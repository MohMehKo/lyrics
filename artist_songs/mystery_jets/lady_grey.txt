Lady Grey
You know how to rub me up the right way
And you're just the kind of mess I'm looking for today
You're just so, you're just so

And my Lady Grey
Girl, you kiss like you don't even know what day it is
And you don't, and you don't

And I hope you feel the same way too, my love, my love
And I hope you feel the same way too, my love

But will you still love me in the morning?
And will you still answer when I'm calling?
Yeah, will you still love me in the morning?
In the morning, in the morning

Lady Grey
Well, you scrub up well but I wasn't born yesterday
And if life deals you lemons, you make lemonade
As you know, as you know

And I hope you feel the same way too, my love, my love
And I hope you feel the same way too, my love

But will you still love me in the morning?
And will you still call me as I'm calling
Yeah, will you still love me in the morning?
In the morning, in the morning

And I hope you feel the same way too, my love, my love
And I hope you feel the same way too, my love

And I hope you feel the same way too, yeah
I hope you feel the same way too, yeah
And I hope you feel the same way too, my love

But will still love me in the morning?
And will you still answer when I'm calling?
Yeah, will you still love me in the morning?
Well darling, give me a warning, a warning

Yeah will you still love me in the morning?
In the morning, in the morning, my love
In the morning, in the morning
