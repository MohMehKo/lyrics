Saviour, saviour

You sinners gather 'round when you hear this sound
It's the saviour, the saviour
He's like a sugar daddy for all eternity
He's the saviour, the saviour

Yeah I heard that you were back on the street
Where love is blind
And talk is cheap
Well if you're naked then I've got a fig leaf

You sinners gather 'round now you heard that sound
It's the saviour, the saviour
He's like a sugar daddy for all eternity
He's the saviour, the saviour

Back in those days when we were riding high
Before your tongue got tangled up with lies
Yeah you could drive me to whispers and cries
With your behaviour, behaviour...

She'd come into town when he was feeling down
He would praise her, praise her
Now the end is nigh, there's a comet in the sky
He's got to save her, to save her

One day I'm gonna end your pain
I'll be your drug, your new cocaine
I'll satisfy you through the night
And in when it's over I'll still hold you tight

Saviour, saviour

You sinners gather 'round now you heard that sound
It's the saviour, the saviour
He's like a sugar daddy for all eternity
He's the saviour, the saviour

She'd come into town when he was feeling down
He would praise her, praise her
Now the end is nigh, there's a comet in the sky
He's got to save her, to save her
