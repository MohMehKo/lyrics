Spiralling
Just a variation on a theme
Into the stream
Merrily, merrily 
Life is but a dream

Well you got me spinning circles in my sleep
Well I hear you but your words don't last
Like your breath upon a pane of glass
Fading away now

And when we meet
I get up but I cannot feel my feet
Once I was told
There could be miracles
But there's a fault in the machine

Like a drowning man needs a hand
It's out of reach
Well I thought I made myself quite clear
Now I can't wait to get out of here
Watch me get out of here
Get out of here

In the looking glass
I was a Monday Casanova for a thousand masks
But it didn't last
Now I'm headed up to heaven with a boarding pass

If I make it up I have to write
Why they keep us stuck down here
Running round with all this fear

Because you prey
Don't mean he hears the things you say
Because you reveal
Don't mean you've nothing to conceal
Because you cry
Don't mean your tears will never dry

When you're spinning round
It's hard to see what's true
Well I hope to spin in tune
'Cuz this song is gonna finish soon
