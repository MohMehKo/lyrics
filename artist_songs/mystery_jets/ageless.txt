I come from here and everywhere
And I'm still in search for somewhere
And I'm going back to nowhere, my friend

I lead a life of mystery
I branch out from the tallest tree
I count my blessings with each passing day

Each and every stream I cross
These paths I take, the maps I make
It simply questions faith cause I'll go with the flow

Yes I'm in this age
But I'm not of your time
Cause I'm ageless
I'm a neophyte
I'm an acolyte
I come out dancing at the break of light

I don't belong, so I can't do no wrong
Possess no arms but fear the strong
As the keepers of land who enter now

I can't walk but I have wings to fly
I'm here from birth until you die
I don't see so well but innervision guides me

There is no I, there is no you
Nothing to pray for nor to do
Ours is the kingdom of stars

Yes I'm in this age
But I'm not of your time
Because I'm ageless
I'm in need of fire
I'm a knackered iron
I come out dancing at the break of light

I'm in these days of history
Lift your eyes and talk to me
Lay your worried head down on my sleeve

I'm looking out for you my friend
Catch the words that I might send
I conjour drafts of fresh hope form thin air

Let go of everything you hold
Trust the story yet to unfold
Things [?] matter not at all [?]

Yes I'm in this age
But I'm not of your time
Cause I'm ageless
I'm a neophyte
I'm an acolyte
I come out dancing at the break of light

Yes I'm in this age
But I'm not of your time
Cause I'm ageless
I'm a neophyte
I'm an acolyte
I come out dancing at the break of light
