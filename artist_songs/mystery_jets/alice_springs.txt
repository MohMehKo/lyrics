Freedom is an illusion generated by your brain
Too delicate for words to ever explain
And love is a taste you get on the tip of your tongue
Better to have loved and lost than to have lived and never loved anyone

I'd stand in the line of fire for you
I'd bend over backwards for you
I'd do anything that you want me to do
'Cause I don't have nothing if I don't have you in my life
And it hurts 'cause it's true

Pain is what keeps your eyes from closing as the night falls
It eats you in your sleep and wakes you when it gets light
And sadness is like a wave that sweeps you off your feet
With tears that cut like knives as they're running like rivers down your cheeks

I'd stand in the line of fire for you
I'd bend over backwards for you
I'd do anything that you want me to do
'Cause I don't have nothing if I don't have you in my life
And you have to believe me 'cause it's true

I'd bend over backwards for you
I'd do anything that you want me to do
'Cause I don't have nothing if I don't have you, my love
And it only hurts because it's true

Yeah, it only hurts because it's true
Yeah, it only hurts because it's true

Freedom is an illusion generated by your brain
Too delicate for words to ever explain
And love is a taste you get on the tip of your tongue
Better to have loved and lost than to have lived and never loved anyone

And it only hurts, it only hurts 'cause it's true
