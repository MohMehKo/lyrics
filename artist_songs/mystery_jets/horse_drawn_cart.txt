If you don't trust me I'll fall 

I've wind in my sails 
but the seas make me pale 
and the floorboards are creaking below 

Find me the oars 
to row me to shores 
where the natives will say hello 

Emotion pulls you like a horse drawn cart 
You can but only follow it into the day into the dark 

Where are the fruits 
growing from promised roots? 
How far can this beer be thrown? 

Here, take from me 
this supposed ability 
My feather's flown further than it was to be blown 

Emotion pulls you like a horse drawn cart 
You can but only follow it into the day into the dark 
Emotion pulls you like a horse drawn cart 
You can but only follow it into the day into the dark 

If you don't trust me I'll fall 
(trust me I'll fall) 
If you don't trust me I'll fall 
(trust me I'll fall) 
If you don't trust me I'll fall 
(trust me I'll fall) 
If you don't trust me I'll fall 
(trust me I'll fall) 
If you don't trust me I'll fall 
(trust me I'll fall) 
If you don't trust me I'll fall 
If you don't (trust me I'll fall) 
If you don't trust me I'll fall 
If you don't (trust me I'll fall) 
If you don't trust me I'll fall 
If you don't (trust me I'll fall) 
If you don't trust me I'll fall 
If you don't (trust me I'll fall) 
If you don't trust me I'll fall 
If you don't (trust me I'll fall) 

If you don't trust me I'll fall 
If you don't (trust me I'll fall) 
If you don't trust me I'll fall 
If you don't (trust me I'll fall) 
If you don't trust me I'll fall 
If you don't (trust me I'll fall) 
If you don't trust me I'll fall 
If you don't (trust me I'll fall, fall, fall)
