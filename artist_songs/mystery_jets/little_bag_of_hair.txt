Nintendo machines in hospitals are always broken 
Chewing jay cloths relieves the pain from mouth ulcers 
I've got a crush on a girl 
But I'm gonna have to work on that 
They say that being in the army makes you hard 
But I don't know about that 

Ice cream blender, pocket money spender 
Off-chart behaviour, granulated banana flavour 

Let's play nurses and doctors 
Until the real nurses and doctors catch us shouting curses 
Hiding in boxes until the real nurses and doctors come 

I used to have a little bag of hair 
And wish it was my hair 
My Dad would bring me Airfix fighters 
The glue would get all over the bed 
At my fingertips enough morphine to put me in that jet 
A 4am that little red button was all I had left 

Ice cream blender, pocket money spender 
Off-chart behaviour, granulated banana flavour 

Let's play nurses and doctors 
Until the real nurses and doctors catch us shouting curses 
Playing in boxes until the real nurses and doctors come...
