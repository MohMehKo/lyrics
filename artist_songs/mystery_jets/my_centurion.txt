Buddy don't grow up
It's a trap
All of the voices say 
"You should know better than that"
Now pick up the pieces from the floor
'Cuz buddy there ain't nothing
That God won't forgive you for

Could you be my
My centurion
My centurion

I'll follow you everywhere you go
I'll be the R2D2 to your C3PO
My motivation's good as gold
Your self restraint is weak
But I've got it under control

Could you be my
My centurion
My centurion
Could you be my
Centurion
My centurion

Save me, save me
From the enemy inside
Oh won't you bathe me, bathe me?
In your everlasting light
Oh won't you save me, save me?
From myself
My centurion
My centurion

Your silhouette brings flesh to my fantasy
I'll meet you at the porter of infidelity
Don't stub me out with the heel of your new shoes
I'm ready to blow like dynamite, girl
Now could you light my fuse?

Could you be my
My centurion
My centurion, centurion
Centurion
Centurion

And now I can't believe
The voice inside my head
Become a part of me
Won't stop till I'm there
Until I'm there

Save me, save me
From the devil in disguise
Oh won't you bathe me, bathe me?
In your everlasting light
Oh won't you save me, save me?
From myself
Save me, save me from myself
My centurion
My centurion
My centurion
My centurion
My centurion
