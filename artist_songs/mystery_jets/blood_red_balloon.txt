Blow the electric candle out
Let yourself slip away a while
Into the phosphorescent blue
That's swimming through the tubes in you
'Cuz you are made of water
Slowly synchronizing with the moon
That rises from the sea in front you
Like a blood red balloon
Like a blood red balloon

Wandering naked though the street
Forewarning everyone you meet
You hold their fortune in your hand
See heaven in a grain of sand
Converse with the Spiritual Sun
On Primrose Hill, NW1
Emerging ghostly from the morning dew

Like a blood red balloon
Like a blood red balloon
Like a blood red balloon
Like a blood red balloon

Don't close your eyes
You can't fight it
Don't close your eyes
You can't hide from it
Open your eyes
You can't fight it

Don't close your eyes
You can't fight it
Don't close your eyes
You can't fight it
Don't close your eyes
You can't hide from it
Open your eyes
You can't fight it
Don't close your eyes

I look into your staring eyes
And understand our future lies
With the destined demise of man
A mushroom cloud following an
Explosion filmed in surround sound
Sending deep tremors through the ground
Obscuring the innocent sky from view

Like a blood red balloon
Like a blood red balloon
Like a blood red balloon
Like a blood red balloon
Like a blood

(Don't close your eyes)
