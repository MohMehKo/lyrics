The girl is gone, the girl is gone
The girl is gone, the girl is gone

Exchanging love for an empty glass
A stranger's touch and a stranger's laugh
But when it's gone and the night has passed
I'll want the thing that I can't ask

Finger prints on a dusty wall
Remind me of what went before
As shadows dance on the bedroom floor
They're just life boats on a distant shore

But I was wrong, thinking that I'd be strong
Always wanting more
But I was wrong, see how the girl is gone
Pushing me out the door

But I was wrong, thinking that I'd be strong
Always wanting more
But I was wrong, see how the girl is gone

The girl is gone, the girl is gone
The girl is gone, the girl is gone

Memories are still so strong
The clock ticks, the girl is gone
I used to think even though we were young
Somehow we'd just hold on

Disappointment's a deadly thing
You're spread like butter on the bed linen
Together then but living in sin
We had high hopes but what did they bring?

But I was wrong, thinking that I'd be strong
Always wanting more
But I was wrong, see how the girl is gone
Pushing me out the door

But I was wrong, thinking that I'd be strong
Always wanting more
But I was wrong, see how the girl is gone

The girl is gone, the girl is gone
The girl is gone, the girl is gone

The girl is gone, the girl is gone
The girl is gone, the girl is gone
