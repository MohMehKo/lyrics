I'm a tourist, 
World at my feet. 
Across hither and dither 
and hither and dither 
and hither and dither 
wont fall off my seat. 

I've a camera, 
Keep my photos in a book. 
The more i keep shooting and shooting 
and shooting and shooting and shooting 
and shooting, 
The less i have to look.

Oh Cairo where did you go, 
Oh Cairo where did you go, 
Oh Cairo where did you go, 
Oh Cairo where have you gone 
(where have you gone [x3]) 

You're an Oyster, 
That's food for thought, 
Whats not for sale, 
for sale for sale for sale for sale 
for sale for sale cannot be bought.
