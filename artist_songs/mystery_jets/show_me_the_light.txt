So here we are in the dark
Don't the day feel like a world apart?
I start to come undone
When I'm living on the other side of the sun

But sometimes I feel
That it's all too much to take
I look in the mirror
But don't recognize my face

So show me the light
And tell me that things will turn out right
It cuts like a knife
When you say things won't turn out right

Temptation my old friend
You've come back to lead me off again
If you see me acting strange
You can call but you know I'm out of range

But sometimes I feel
That it's all too much too take
But all that just changes
When I look look upon your face

So show me the light
And tell me that things will turn out right
Remember the night
And how we would hold each other tight

We live for today
But we've no way of knowing
What tomorrow holds
Or where we are going

The weather man he says
That soon it will be snowing
The sky at night is dark
But the stars they don't stop glowing

So show me the light
And tell me that things will turn out right
It cuts like a knife
When you say things won't turn out right

So show me the light
And tell me that things will turn out right
Remember the night
And how we would hold each other tight
So show me the light

The weather man he says
That soon it will be snowing
