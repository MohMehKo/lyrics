You pick me up in the evening
I wear a disguise
I've been hiding out through the days
So I don't get caught in this web of lies

When I first saw you
You were cool as lemon eyes
You can make my blood run cold
And warm me up before sunrise

But I can't understand what it takes to keep my mind
You fall through my hands
Like a desert's drifting sand

Take me where the roses grow
To the place that no one knows

When we came upon the desert track
They were buzzing round like flies
The sound of silence through the air
Writhing blue lit up the night

If we ever make it out of here
I'll tell you where to go
Wait until the evening comes
Then meet me where the roses grow

But I can't understand what it takes to keep my mind
(Take me to the place where the roses grow)
You fall through my hands
Like a desert's drifting sand
(Take me to the place where the roses grow)

But I can't understand why we tread this broken land
(Take me to the place where the roses grow)
We never get too far
Always crashing in your car

I need you
I want you
Everything for you
Take me where the roses grow
To the place that no one knows

I'll tell you where to go
Where the red, red roses grow
(Take me to the place where the roses grow)
Our love is a disease
But there's no cure for what you need
(Take me to the place where the roses grow)

Meet me in the dark
Feel the beating of my heart
(Take me to the place where the roses grow)
We never get too far
Always crashing in your car

Take me to the place where the roses grow
To the place that no one knows
