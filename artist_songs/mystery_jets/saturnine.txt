All along the shore
Where the waving waters keep the score
Suddenly you arrive
A distant star in two lovers' eyes

But you had no choice
Appearing in this place
Before you had a voice
You were born to run the race

You're different every day
And you grow in every way
But your thoughts, your friends, your face
Are just visitors who leave without a trace

So if the highs of youth
Have got you crashing down to Earth
It's time to face the truth
Of your pain, your love, your hurt

Your world is turning
I can feel it turn away
I come towards you
But you seem so far away
The world is turning
It will always be that way
I run towards you
But you seem so far away

You seem so far away
You seem so far away

You may be hypnotized
Or perhaps you've realized?
That to be famous and thin
Is the greatest goal of the age we're living in

Way up on high
There's an order to the stars
It's up to you and I
To change what's on our cards

The world is turning
I can feel it turn away
I come towards you
But you seem so far away
The Sun is burning
It will always be that way
We may not have tomorrow
But we'll never fade away
Never fade away

(We'll never fade away)
