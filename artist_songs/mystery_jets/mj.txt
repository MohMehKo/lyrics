Don't tell anyone
Don't tell anyone
Don't tell anyone 

We share a joke in the bath,
I know how to make you laugh,
No hang-ups between us,
Not like the other girls in class,
You're different,
Confident,
All secrets safe with me,
Red lipstick on my cheek,
Your love bites last all week girl.

You can't tell,
You can't tell,
Can't tell anyone
(What we've got going on)
Don't tell,
Don't tell,
Don't tell anyone
(What we've got going on)
We hold hands,
We got plans but,
Don't tell anyone
(What we've got going on)
You can't tell,
You can't tell,
Can't tell anyone
(What we've got going on)

Our love is one others,
Could never come to understand,
When we lie close your heart beats so hard,
I can hear it with my hands,
We laugh but if father,
Ever caught your legs wrapped around me,
He'd tear you from out my arms,
And we'd be history girl.

Don't let them see us hold hands,
Our love is one they'd never understand.

You can't tell,
You can't tell,
Can't tell anyone
(What we've got going on)
Don't tell,
Don't tell,
Don't tell anyone
(What we've got going on)
We hold hands,
We got plans but,
Don't tell anyone
(What we've got going on)
You can't tell,
You can't tell,
Can't tell anyone
(What we've got going on)
