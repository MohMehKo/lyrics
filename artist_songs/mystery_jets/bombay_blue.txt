A baby, young and sweet
A Maharashtra night, a city street
And I feel low
Hear her crying in her sleep
A blanket of newspaper sheets
By my window
There's no worse sound that I could hear
Or hope of life that I fear she'll never know
Oh those Bombay Blues

And the harder you push her away
The sooner your heart turns a darker shade of grey
But the more you allow her in
The longer she'll live beneath the surface of your skin

Oh and now that I can see
How love becomes the enemy
They say there's nothing you can do
But that's what they want you to believe

Full moon party on the beach
Burning holy effigies on Summer sands
Temporarily mend the holes
In your chimerical soul
In a mystic land

But all the beautiful things that you love
Will one day turn into the things that you despise
'Cuz the darkness lives within
And the more that you hide it
The darker it stains your skin

Oh and now that I can see
How love becomes a memory
And you say there's nothing I can do
If that's what you wanna believe

Oh and now that I can see
How love becomes the enemy
You say there's nothing I can do
If that's what you wanna believe
There's clearly nothing I can say
That will make her go away
Don't say there's nothing I can do
If that's what you wanna believe
