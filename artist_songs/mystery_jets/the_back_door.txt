Well I know you think that I'm taking the back door
like the chocolate labrador with a broken paw
'Cuz how can you relate rolling peas around the plate
to pricing pearls from an oyster with a silver fork?

But if you wanna blow a bubble, I'll bite my gum in two
And I'll always pull a Christmas cracker with you
Between us there's a thread, I feel it tugging at my chest 
when you accuse me of not knowing what you're going through

But I do
And I swear I do

Well I know for sometime now I've been all over the place
But sometimes life's like one big egg and spoon [?]
I'd rather not reach the end and still have a couple of friends
than a row of dusty trophies on my fireplace

So I see you woke up on the wrong side of the bed
Well at least you've got both your arms and a roof over your head
You say I don't have clue
But if that's really true
Then I wouldn't understand a single thing you said

But I do
And I swear I do

So if you want to blow a bubble, I'll bite my gum in two
And I'll always pull a Christmas cracker with you
Between us there's a thread, I feel it tugging at my chest 
when you accuse me of not knowing what you're going through
