To be the hero of my story 
Forced are the events of my life 
You're young, oh twice but once 
Save my trouble 

You struggle 
You struggle 

Bathe me in water vapour 
Erase me to ashes with fire 
I grow old to dust in the dark 
You left me be soluble in air 

If I, really knew the truth 
I'd probably turn back with love 
Better to not know too much too soon 
Mankind is always in the tongue 

Bathe me in water vapour 
Erase me to ashes with fire 
I grow old to dust in the dark 
You left me be soluble in air 

Bathe me in water vapour 
Erase me to ashes with fire 
I grow old to dust in the dark 
You left me be soluble in air
