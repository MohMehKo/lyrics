Is there world more lonely than ours
Out there beyond the stars
Is there another me
Looking back across the sea
I wonder if he knows
I wonder if he cares
I wonder if he ever wonders
I wonder if he asks
I'm just a blind spot in his eye
I'm just a reflection of the light

If what the folk class says it's true
If there's a face above the blue
Hiding in the [?]
Looking down at me and you
I wonder if he knows
If there's a secret door
A place where I can lay to rest
But I got lost in Austin [?]
I'm just a blind spot in his eye
I'm just a reflection of the light

Take me to the edge
I'm not scared
And if we fall off
It doesn't matter
We'll do it all again
Take me to the edge
I'm not scared
I want to feel the cold wind in my hair
And if we fall off
It doesn't matter
We'll do it all again

Is there an octave
We've not found
Way up above the sound
Station on my radio
Frequency that we don't know
[?]
Still hanging over me
[?] is too late
To take me up to heaven's gate
I'm just a blind spot in his eye
I'm just a reflection of the light

Take me to the edge
I'm not scared
And if we fall off
It doesn't matter
We'll do it all again
Take me to the edge
I'm not scared
I want to feel the cold wind in my hair
And if we fall off
It doesn't matter
We'll do it all again
