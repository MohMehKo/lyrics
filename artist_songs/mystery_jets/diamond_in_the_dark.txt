Looking back now I regret, 
You're a promise that I never kept. 
Waiting in my room in vain, 
Time winds back and back again. 

Outside the school gates, 
We first met in a basement near the park 
(Diamonds in the dark) 
We danced all night and then we kissed, 
Your smile like diamonds in the dark. 

It's a long way to fall 
When the words stray 
No-one calls 

We would have little children, 
We would be together forever. 
(Diamonds in the dark) 
We would live on the Delancy Street, 
Then you cut your hair 
And it ended there. 

It's a long way to fall (long way) 
When the words stray 
No-one calls 

Looking back now I regret, 
You're a promise that I never kept. 
Waiting in my room in vain, 
Time winds back and back again. 

Now I've nothing left to lose, 
Clinging to a cliff-face 
Staring at your shoes 
And tell me, tell me, tell me 
Do you feel the same? 
Or are we just waiting for a day we can't, 
A day that we can't change. 

And now there's this no-mans land 
Between you and me 
(Diamonds in the dark) 
But I still wander between 
The sheets and streets 
And other places we've been 

It's a long way to fall (long way to fall) 
When the words stray 
No-one calls (such a long way to fall) 
It's a long way to fall (long way to fall) 
When the words stray 
No-one calls 

Looking back now I regret, 
You're a promise that I never kept. 
Waiting in my room in vain, 
Time winds back and back again. 

Back and back again, 
Back and back again, 
Back and back again, 
Back again
