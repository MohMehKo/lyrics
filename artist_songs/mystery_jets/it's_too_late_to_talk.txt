You were the apple of my eye
My Phoebe Cates from Ridgemont High
Did you take me on for fun? 
Or did you take me for a ride?
Maybe we were a little young
Too young to know there was something wrong
But before I move along
I need to know what you're running from
You're running from

But it's too late
It's too late
But it's too late 
It's too late
But it's too late to talk now
It's too late to talk about now

But it's too late
It's too late
But it's too late 
It's too late
But it's too late to talk now

I was a thorn stuck in your side
And I could never change your mind
But no matter how hard you tried
You couldn't hide from the kick inside
Maybe we were a little young
Accidents happen what you're having fun
But before I move along
I need to know what you're running from
You're running from

But it's too late
It's too late
But it's too late 
It's too late
But it's too late to talk now
It's too late to talk about now

But it's too late
It's too late
But it's too late 
It's too late
But it's too late to talk now
It's too late to talk about now

But it's too late
It's too late
But it's too late 
It's too late
But it's too late to talk now
It's too late to talk about now

And it's too late
But it's too late
But it's too late to talk now

But it's too late
It's too late
It's too late to talk now

But it's too late
It's too late
It's too late to talk now

It's too late
It's too late
It's too late to talk now
