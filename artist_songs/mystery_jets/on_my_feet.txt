Get me, on my feet 
Get me, on my feet 
Get me, on my feet 
Get me, on my feet 
Get me, on my feet 
Get me, on my feet 
Get me, on my feet 

You get me 
On my feet 
So tomorrow 
Never comes 

All our yesteryears 
Will be erased 
All our yesteryears 
Will be erased 
All our yesteryears 
Will be erased 

Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah! 

Two more to my thoughts do tell 
Two more to my thoughts do tell 

All our yesteryears 
Will be erased 
All our yesteryears 
Will be erased 
All our yesteryears 
Will be erased
