There is blood on your hands
But I can't bare to see how it hangs
Like a millstone round your neck
Slowly dragging you down

What is worth fighting for
If not the only one that I adore?
Sometimes I hear you calling out in the night
And it only makes it hurt more

And I wish I could say
I believe this is goodbye
But I don't
No, I don't

If you think running away
From how you feel inside will make it easier
Well, it won't
No, it won't

I hear the bell in the tower
And though the song it sings is not ours
The notes they dance upon the wind
I know they'll reach you somehow

Come in and lie by my side
Let me wipe the tears from your eyes
And though it might be for the last time
I know a love like ours will never die

And I wish I could say
I believe this is goodbye
But I don't
No, I don't

If you think running away
From how you feel inside will make it easier
Well, it won't
No, it won't
