You can take The Lexicon of Love away
But I'm keeping Remain in Light
You can take away It's A Shame About Ray
But I'm holding on to Country Life
Well you can keep No Need To Argue and I'll keep The Aeroplane Over The Sea
But hold on to The Boy With The Arab Strap
'Cause I'm holding on to Village Green

I don't know if the knot just needs untangling 
Cassette tapes get stuck all the time
But either way I'm keeping Double Nickels On The Dime

These were our greatest hits
(Sha la la la la la la la, sha la la la la)
The best of me and you
(Sha la la la la la la la, sha la la la la)

I still remember buying you Band On The Run
On the first day that we kissed
But you always did prefer McCartney One
'Cause it reminded you of being a kid
No way you're having This Nation's Saving Grace
You only listen to it when you're pissed
But when you sober up, it's always why the fuck
Are you still listening to Mark E. Smith?

I don't know if the knot just needs untangling
Or if we forgot which way's up and which way is down
But still the tape keeps going round and round...

These were our greatest hits
(Sha la la la la la la la, sha la la la la)
The best of me and you
(Sha la la la la la la la, sha la la la la)
The best of me and you

But still the tape keeps going round and round...

These were our greatest hits
(Sha la la la la la la la, sha la la la la)
The best of me and you
(Sha la la la la la la la, sha la la la la)
Our Desert Island Discs
(Sha la la la la la la la, sha la la la la)
The best of me and you
