When you're rolling on a high
And you fear that it won't last
You can always call me up
Don't be afraid to ask

If the world is feeling small
So much it smothers you
Hold out
You'll be surprised
To see what you can live through

In your bedroom
Sitting down
You leave the world behind
Draw your velvet curtain shut
To block out all the light

If it gets heavy and the noise
Suffocates your head
You can always call me up
For something to take off the edge

Let the light come flooding in
Let the light come flooding in
Let the light come flooding in
Won't you let the light come flooding in?
Come flooding in
Let the light come flooding in

But you are not alone
We'll always be our own
Worst enemies
Kill the demons in your head
With kindness instead
They're imaginary
You'll finally adjust
Friends that you can trust
Unconditionally

When you're rolling on a high
And you fear that it won't last
You can always call me up
To come and kick you in the ass
