Ring your tongue out for drying 
But the sky's crying 
Everyone has gone inside 
The sheep bleat and the cows sleep 
Some bluebirds tweet-tweet 
Behind the cloud the sun hides 

Warm next to electric fires 
Warm next to electric fires 

Stella's old cat's getting wet 
She's her favourite 
Even favourite cats get wet 
Cut a clever one in half 
Watch two dumb hogs laugh 
Two he-he's three ha-ha-ha's 

Come warm your toes near the fire 

The electric fire 
The electric fire 
The electric fire
