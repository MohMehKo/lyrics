Do you ever wonder
If the love that you are feeling
Comes from the bottom of your heart
Or if you're just dreaming?

I've got a feeling, a funny little feeling
Yeah, I've got a feeling

I think you're waiting on a miracle
Yeah, but who knows how long it will take
I know it's difficult
Yeah, but don't think it's ever too late

I think you're waiting on a miracle
When you're down on your knees and you pray
I think you're waiting on a miracle
But don't think it's ever too late
A miracle will come if you wait

I can still remember
How you'd smile while you were sleeping
But now you're going under
And I can't believe what I'm seeing

Here's you falling apart
And though you cry no one hears you screaming
There's a hole in your heart
And though you try you can't stop the bleeding

I've got a feeling, a funny little feeling
Yeah, I've got a feeling

I think you're waiting on a miracle
Yeah, but who knows how long it will take
And I know it's difficult
Yeah, but don't think it's ever too late

I think you're waiting on a miracle
When you're down on your knees and you pray
I think you're waiting on a miracle
But don't think it's ever too late
A miracle will come if you wait
A miracle will come if you wait

I think you're waiting on a miracle
Yeah, but who knows how long it will take
And I know it's difficult
Yeah, but don't think it's ever too late

I think you're waiting on a miracle
When you're down on your knees and you pray
I think you're waiting on a miracle
But don't think it's ever too late

Do you ever wonder
If the love that you are feeling
Comes from the bottom of your heart
Or if you're just dreaming?
