All the minutes we lived in
Still alive under my skin
So I can't get no sleep
I guess the monuments we made
Were only built to try and save us
The things we couldn't keep
Still I'm turning in my sleep

Because the one that you love
Might not be the one that you were thinking of

Now my friends procreate
The ones who stayed up late
Never knowing who they'd meet
And as I listen to them talk
And watch their babies learn to walk
It's me who's finding my feet
Still you don't know who you're gonna meet

And so the one that you love
Might not be the one with whom you end up

How we end up with who we end up
Is it just a question of luck?
Won't it be strange to see how we change?
When we're all grown up
How we end up with who we end up
Is it just a question of luck?

Yes I hope I end up with you
Tell me do you get to choose
Who you love, who you lose?
Or is it down to fate?
'Cuz I met her once before
In a crowded corridor
But I was born too late
It's the mistake you've got to make

When the one that you love
Might not be the one that you were thinking of

How we end up with who we end up
Is it just a question of luck?
Won't it be strange to see how we change?
When we're all grown up
How we end up with who we end up
Is it just a question of luck?
Won't it be strange to see how we change?
When we're all grown up

Yes I hope I end up with you

Yes I hope I end up with you
And I hope I end up with you
Yes I hope I end up with you
Yes I hope I end up with you
