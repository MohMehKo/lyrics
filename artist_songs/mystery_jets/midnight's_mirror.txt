Emerging from the aftershow with eyes like piss holes in the snow
Midnight's mirror has revealed what the morning keeps concealed

Opulence and Chintz decor are wasted on those about to score
Talking to the pig in boots
She's your friend when she wants some more

So I said to myself
"Well well
You fell
Down the same hole again
Now you're your only friend"

I'm like a shadow you can't shake
From the warmups to the aftershow
This is the dream into which I'll wake
There's no limit to the low

If a blizzard blows inside a well
Does it leave a mark you can't dispel?
Still the day after the night before
Resolve is never less, it's more

So I said to myself
"Well well
You fell
Down the same hole again
Now you're your only friend
Down the same hole again
Now you're your only friend"

I'm like a shadow you can't shake
From the warmups to the aftershow
No matter how little or much I take
There's no limit to the low
I'm always here when the lights come up
And there's nowhere else to go
Just like a record that gets stuck
I re-live it blow by blow
