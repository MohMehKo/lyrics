What did I believe in?
How did I behave?   

Recline on the bonnet of a battered old car
Fixed sheets of mirror plate on my electric guitar
Walking in bare feet on the shards of broken glass
Can a person be happy if you never see them laugh?

The daffs have come and gone
The sunshines on no one
The morning wakes to find
The child time left behind

I'd like to ride my bike but I have 
trouble with my breathing
Will you please turn out my light
if you happen to be leaving?
Everyone's made of straw all scarecrows in the rain
Were all left out to frighten 
all of those who remain

The daffs have come and gone
The sunshines on no one
The morning wakes to find
The child time left behind

What did I believe in?
How did I behave?
