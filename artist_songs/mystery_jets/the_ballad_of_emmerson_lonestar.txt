Just a lonestar in the sky, treading the night
Cutting loose the mess you left, taking flights
From coast to coast, you move like a ghost, trying to break the past
So follow the road to wherever it goes and strike up another chance
Lonestar counting all the people and the passing time
You are high above the mountain and the columbine
She bored a hole right through your brain
At Citrus Heights
Fallen angel of her you make my first light
Well ain't it sad when you feel it this bad and your body burns to know
The shape of her limbs as the night bird sings, all framed in afterglow
Lonestar counting all the people and the passing time
You are watching all the wishes dying on the vine
Lonestar flies above the mountain and the columbine
How far do I have to wander before the dream is mine?
Well now you know, there's no way back to your old life
Like two trains on the same track, you collide
The roses are red, all the words that you said as she lay by your side
But all you could think as you stood by the sink was
Wash me away with the tide
This time, wanna show I feel. This time want a love that's real
This time gonna know where I stand. This time wanna be in command [x4]
