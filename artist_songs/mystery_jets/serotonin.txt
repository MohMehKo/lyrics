Meet me in the middle of the morning
When the crows fly highest in the sky
Couldn't you hear me calling?
I was up looking for you all night

Oh, but I never found you
No matter how hard I tried to
Oh, no, I never found you
Sarah if only you knew

Serotonin, you're burning a hole into my heart
It felt like I was floating
But now I'm coming down off you so
Down off you so hard

Meet me at the bottom of the ocean
Feel its fingers tickling our skin
You mix your magic potion
And the old familiar feeling starts to kick in

But now it's fading and I can't hear what you're saying
It feels like it's slipping through my fingers
It's fading and I can't hear what you're saying
It feels like you're slipping, but

It's just the serotonin
That's burning a hole into my heart
Felt like I was frozen
Yeah, but now I'm coming up so hard

Serotonin
Hell, you're really tearing me apart
It felt like I was frozen
Yeah, but now I'm coming up so hard

Sera-serotonin, Sera-serotonin
Now I'm coming up so hard
Sera-serotonin, Sera-serotonin
And now I'm coming up so hard

So hard
So hard
Serotonin
