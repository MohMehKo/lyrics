There's an invisible line where your body meets mine
And crossing it feels like a drug
We twist and we turn, we crackle and burn
In the flickering flames of our love
It's one so divine, it sends shivers up my spine
And boils and bubbles my blood

'Cause when you come around the house at night, darling
There's just one thing I wanna do
Yeah, when you come around the house at night, darling
There's just one thing I wanna do

All I wanna do is melt, melt, melt, melt into you
Melt, melt, melt, melt into you

I'm weak at the knees and the air that I breathe
So thick you could cut with a knife
But as time starts to slow, well your skin comes aglow
And the room becomes flooded with light
And as the dream melts away, the lines on your face
Appear like cracks in the ice

When you come around the house at night, darling
There's just one thing I wanna do
Yeah and you're all that I care about darling
Don't care about nothing but you

All I wanna do is melt, melt, melt, melt into you
Melt, melt, melt, melt into you
All I wanna do is melt, melt, melt, melt into you
Melt, melt, melt, melt into you

This is what I've been waiting for
This is what I've been waiting for
Melt with me into the floor

This is what I've been waiting for
I've been waiting for, I've been waiting for
Yeah, this is what I've been waiting for
I've been waiting for, I've been waiting for

Melt, melt, melt, melt into you
Melt, melt, melt, melt into you
All I wanna do is melt, melt, melt, melt into you
Melt, melt, melt, melt into you
