Oh well
Well I suppose that you could say
You can't help
Help but to learn from your mistakes
Oh well
When you put it to me that way
You can't tell
You can't tell how long will it take to...

Make up your mind
What is taking you so long?
You're wasting my time
Darling, what is going on?
Before I draw a line
You could have been mine this time
Make up your mind

Oh dear
Well I would get down on my knees
But I care
I care too much about my jeans
Oh dear
Well I would sail the seven seas
To be near to you
So darling, darling please

Make up your mind
What is taking you so long?

You're wasting my time
Darling, what is going on?
Before I draw a line
You could have been mine this time
Make up your mind

Come on girl

Were you really happy as you ought to be?
Happy is how happy you could be with me
'Cuz I feel to believe that he gives you what you need
But if it's true?
Then darling why, why can't you...

Make up your mind?
What is taking you so long?
You're wasting my time
Darling, what is going on?
Before I draw a line
You could have been mine this time
Make up your mind
Your mind 
Your mind

Come on girl
