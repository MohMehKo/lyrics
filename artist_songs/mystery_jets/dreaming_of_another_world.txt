It's a trick of the eye, to live or to die
A riddle without a clue
I spend my days in a dreamy haze
Thinking of what to do

When the sun comes down, night is all around
I shed my skin, treading on new ground
Go to a place where the people make a crowd
Find your face and do what's not allowed

Dreaming of another world, dreaming of another world
Dreaming of another world, dreaming of another
You always seem to talk all through the night
And you always seem to make it home alright

It's a sorry tale when a dream turns stale
I need a bolt from the blue
I once loved before, does it matter anymore?
'Cause now it might be you

So when the sun comes up, burning out the night
We stretch our limbs and walk into the light
There's nothing left to say, sleep is for the dead
It's time to live out the dreams inside your head

Dreaming of another world, dreaming of another world
Dreaming of another world, dreaming of another
You always seem to talk all through the night
And you always seem to make it home alright

Just try, try to scrape the sky
Only once, once before you die
Do something that will make your mother cry
And dream, dream of another world

Dreaming of another world, dreaming of another world
Dreaming of another world, dreaming of another world
Dreaming of another world, dreaming of another
You always seem to talk all through the night
And you always seem to make it home alright
