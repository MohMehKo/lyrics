I have a plane, 
One of the few 
With roundels on its wings. 
Lullaby for me and for you, 
When it flies high it sings 

Rock me to sleep 
With que sara, 
Dear monde do you suppose? 
As I feel my eyelids close, 
The other side is not so far. 

I dug a hole 
Under the ground 
And made myself a den. 
It's there that I can be found, 
Not if you return but when. 

There's a place 
A place called Hell, 
Spend some time there, 
In the dark I cast a spell 
To bury all, 
All of my fears. 

Oh D... [?]
Oh D... 
Oh D... 
I would but I couldn't spell your name. 

Once I fell from a great height, 
'Are you ready? I've come for you' 
A voice spoke from the graveyard [?]
'Not yet' I said, 
'Got some things to do.' 

And all this time I've been making dens, 
And I'm still making them now. 
And I know, I know 
I can never make ammends, 
But I've got to reach you somehow. 

I can tie my laces 
On my own shoes and I can 
Count up to to thirty too. 

Oh D... [?]
Oh D... 
Oh D... 
I would but I couldn't spell your name. 

I'm sorry 
There are so few words 
[?]
I waited 
A long time 
And I never, never came back. 
I see you often 
In everyday places 
I want to [?]
But I can't find the words. 
But I can't find the words. 
And I can't find the words 
Oh I can't find the words. 
And I can't find the words. 
And I can't find the words. 
They won't come.
