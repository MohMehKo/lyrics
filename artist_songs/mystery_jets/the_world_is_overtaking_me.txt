I'm cold and I'm shaking
With knuckles of white
And I can't help from feeling
Like I'm chasing tail lights
My friends are freewheeling
At the speed of sound
And I can't help from feeling
Like it's me they're running down

The world is overtaking me
The world is overtaking me
The world is overtaking me
The world is overtaking me

Don't know if I'm crazy
'Cuz I never seen to learn
I'm praying someone comes and saves me
Before I crash and burn
Before I crash and burn
Come and save me before I crash and burn

The world is overtaking me
The world is overtaking me
The world is overtaking me
The world is overtaking me

Now my friend
If you could do it all again?
Find the time to make amends
And I'll see you in the end

The world is overtaking me
The world is overtaking me
Now that I can clearly see
The future's now in front of me
I have all the strength run out of me
When I fear it watching over me
And I fear it watching over me
Now that I can clearly see
The world is imaginary 
And the world is imaginary
