[Ice Cube]
Consider this an invitation, to my Gangsta Nation

[Nate Dogg]
Na na na na na na na na (Westside)
Na na na na na na na na (oh oh)
Na na na na na na na na (what what)
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na (yeah yeah)
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na

[Chorus:]
This game right here is rough as fuck
These ho's out here about the bucks
These fools out here afraid to bust
I have no fear, afraid of what
And in five beers I'm comin' up
Fools talk real loud but don't run up
When we come through they run and duck
We still right here so what the fuck

[W.C.]
Nigga I'm tired of these niggas barking at shit talkin' 'bout shit
From the concrete when they chalkin' like this
And there he goes and a trick pose and a throw back
Holdin' a gat ain't gonna bust and know that
It's a dub ass C thing dub C brain
And we don't fuck with niggas in khaki jeans strains
I'm done moving I'm clearing the crowd
It's the hoo-bangin bandanna cri-mi-ni-mi-nal
The ori-gi-nal

[Mack 10]
Evacuate the building look here come a plane
No, it's the big bad Westside Connect Gang
And bump what you claim, homey this who bang
With enough game to drive a swear broad insane
And we number one gunners no we ain't stunners
It's real with us homie, killers and drug runners
And Mack need a D-board in a H2 Hummer
Lookin hotter than the South Central L.A. summer
Let's go

[Chorus]

[Ice Cube]
What the hell is Ice Cube talkin about
That's how you get these here parked in you mouth
Westside ride trick, the same old spit
I don't conversate with chicks I ain't gon' hit
I don't holla at these hoes that sing like Ashanti
Body like Beyonce, face like Andre (uhhh)
You kinda strange
But I'm rich so my entree got to be Bombay

[W.C.]
Have you seen us, naw
Haters can't see us
Connect Gang we the G'est nigga
Countless calls and countless charges
Street niggas making blunts out of Cuban cigars
Big by the linnas sip notic by the liters
With a flock of pros on us cause the cronic is the greenest
And to my G's incarcerated and on probation
I'm gonna stay bagging for the whole G Nation nigga

[Chorus]

[Mack 10]
It's a Gangsta Nation if you in you a G
And the whole world influence by the b in the sea
Now tell the truth rappers you don't ball like me
Cause I'm really from the gang you all is industry
And while I'm serving up and comin young hustlers and gluckas
Bangin for the hood causing havic and ruckus
You fools acting label kissing up like suckers
And your trick solder down when you pee little busters

[Ice Cube]
One thing I do know I ain't the uno
Big puno rap sumo on pruno (you know)
I'd like to thank the congregation
In my affiliation to the Gangsta Nation
I'm hard on them, yeah I'm ruthless
You like a stress sac, boy you useless
You know the side trick, better get up on it
Cause it must be a single with Nate Dogg singin on it

[Mack 10]
Look check this out man
We got a Gangsta Nation going down over here
So you all might as well bow down
And join this Westside thing man
Cause once you get with this
Partner you as G as can be
Believe that homeboy
It's like that
Fred Red, what I'd tell you homey
It ain't a hit till Nate Dogg spit

[Chorus]

Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
(Consider this an invitation, to my Gangsta Nation)
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
