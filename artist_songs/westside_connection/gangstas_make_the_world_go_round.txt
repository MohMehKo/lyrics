Iam gettin dizzy as the world keeps spinnin like a frisbie
Gangsta's and girls make the world twirl
No hesitation I can run a nation from incarceration
30 years is what Im facin
But give me 7 seas and 11 gees
I make enough cheese to bring wall street to its knees
Nigga please I got enough guns
To fill the empire state building full of 1's
Go to school is what you tell us
But nigga's in school is scared of the Goodfellas
We got the Yayo you can just say no
But nobody makes a fuckin move untill I say so
That's how it is and that's how it's gonna be
Kids when you grow up who the fuck you wanna be?
Like me ya black superhero
Got enough zeros to hire Bob Shapiro
Ya honor Im have to get rid of ya
Because it aint no trivia about my house in WEST BOLIVIA
Blew the jury a kiss they rather dismiss
Them swim the big fish
YOU fuckin guppies!!!!!!!!

Not just saggin waving my flag and never will
I ease up nigga
So stop askin see I was taught as a tiny loc on
The set its all
About the pussy & money fuck the rest nigga this
Tech is quicker
To collect when Im seekin all the jewlery & the
Money so miss
Me with that preachin teaching fuck all that
Bullshit I want to
Slang yae like Noriaga sit back watch my paper
Collect like the
I.R.S. as I kick it with 50 bitches all on my dick
Just like the
President & like the police I want a gang of killers
All on my
Side thats down to lie more crooked that St. Ides rip ride on my
Behalf as I call shots as if I was Saddaam Hussein

Rather be feared than loved with a pocket full 
Of dubs because

Analzing me &
Like the escorts look over your sholder nigga its
Plain to see

360 degrees like my D's the world be spinning
Nigga's been sinning since the beginning
Historys a trip so I peep when Iam reading
Nigga's probaly grew weed in the garden of Eden
Before big ballin sex cars and loot
Its like bitches been scandolaus biting forbidden fruit
But gangsta's dont deal with that shit, on the
Westside
And since they regulating hoes I roll with the
Best side
So check it as my lifetime is ticking
Coming up strong  licking and flipping chickens
Need cheese in amounts of G's
I gave up sports to slang Key's
But blamed it on my Knees
Make sure I got what I need
To make your order
Everything to baggies triple beams to jugs for
My water
Like a snitch lifes a bitch a world full of drama
Drug paraphernalia being found by my momma
Trauma brings the sad song on your way to killa king
Nigga
So now I stand with heat in my hand for my whole
Life span
Cause evil lurks the land
Plus I got a packet with this gang-bang jacket
Gotta hold it keep it loaded devoted since quoted
Fo sho One-0 got the ups on thses prankstas
While the world keep twisting as a Westside 
Gangsta
FOE LIFE NIGGA
