One, two, three, four!

We were day-drunk
We were royalty and fools
We were dangerous
We were cannons coming loose

We were dreamers
We were weapons, and legend believers
We were chosen (Yeah!),
golden (Yeah!),
broken and bruised

We made it out alive
We're going back where we came from!
The skin from octylbond
We're going back where we came from!
We thought we could fight, and won
This war has just begun
We made it out alive
We're going back, where we came from!

We were outlaws
We were without ball and chain
We were faux pas
We were sinners, we were saints

We were dreamers
We were weapons, and legend believers
We were chosen (Yeah!),
golden (Yeah!),
broken and bruised

We made it out alive
We're going back where we came from!
The skin from octylbond
We're going back where we came from!
We thought we could fight, and won
This war has just begun
We made it out alive
We're going back, where we came from!

And the bad men win, while good men fall
But we've gotta get up, 'cause at the end of it all
No one likes a quitter
No one likes a quitter

And you fully missed plaques on the walls
But we've gotta get up, 'cause at the end of it all
No one likes a quitter
No one likes a quitter
We made it out alive
We're going back where we came from!
The skin from octylbond
We're going back where we came from!
We thought we could fight, and won
This war has just begun
We made it out alive
We're going back, where we came from!
