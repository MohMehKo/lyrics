We have to do this and do that to get our bodies moving
with one kiss we fall flat and do it over again we-we
make something from nothing we take a little blame
we learn our lessons the hard way we love to play a game

woah woah we can feel our hearts beating woah oh oh
we can let it out woah woah we can feel our hearts
beating woah woah c'mon and let it out

cuz were all just skeletons our bones will never break
we know to take things slow we wont be home tonight
no we wont be home tonight we got a place to go

well keep our heads up and lay low to stay above the
water with to drops we leaned over at least we got
each other you remind me of bonnie you know that I'm
your clyde don't need a rhyme of a reason don't need a place to hide

woah woah we can feel our hearts beating woah woah
we can let it out woah woah we can feel our hearts
beating woah woah c'mon and let it out

cuz were all just skeletons our bones will never break
we know to take things slow we wont be home tonight
no we wont be home tonight we got a a place to go

from the bottom of our hearts to the top of our lungs
what we say is wat we mean and were tied at the tongue
we play with guns cuz were not afraid to shoot our mouths off
[x2]

were not afraid

cuz were all just skeletons our bones will never break break break break 

cuz were all just skeletons our bones will never break
we know to take things slow we wont be home tonight
no we wont be home tonight we got a place to go 
goooooo [x4]
no we wont be home tonight we gotta place to go
