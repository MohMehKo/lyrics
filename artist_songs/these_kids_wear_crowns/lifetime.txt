She knows, 
We all have to grow old, 
And walk the winding road, 
The fires we burn go cold.

Today, she stumbles on her way, 
To find the words to say, 
Get back to yesterday.

Give me all that you got, 
Cause you got got to get your heart pound, 
You got got to get your foot down, 
Let's figure it out know.

We're living a lifetime in minute. 
It'll go straight by if let it. 
So baby tonight, (baby tonight,) baby tonight, 
Cause this is our lifetime and we just wanna live it. 
A lifetime in a minute, 
If you blink your eyes you could be sad. 
So baby tonight, (baby tonight,) baby tonight, 
Cause this our lifetime and we just wanna live it.

She waits, 
She never makes mistakes, 
But she'll never get away, 
You can never bet it safe.

Give me all that you got, 
Cause you got got to get your heart pound, 
You got got to get your foot down, 
Let's figure it out know.

We're living a lifetime in minute. 
It'll go straight by if you let it. 
So baby tonight, (baby tonight,) baby tonight, 
Cause this is our lifetime and we just wanna live it.

If you blink your eyes you could be sad.

Cause this our lifetime.

So get up get up get up. (OH!) 
So get up get up get up. (OH!) 
So get up get up get up. (OH!) 
Cause this our lifetime.

Just when we thought it could last last forever, 
We're counting our seconds it's now or it's never. 
These moments disappear.

I know, we all have to grow old...

We're living a lifetime in minute. 
It'll pass right by if you let it. 
So baby tonight, (baby tonight,) baby tonight, 
Cause this is our lifetime and we just wanna live it.
