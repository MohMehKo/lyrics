Driving til the road bleeds
Highways in our bloodstream
We're burning these tyres
The engine's on fire
We keep crossing the lines, but we're just fine

This pavement feels like paradise
This pavement brings us back to life
Hope this road never ends
To the coast with my friends
This pavement feels like paradise
Like paradise

Driving over raw cays
Eyes closed in the backseat
It's 20 below
The engine is cold
Lost and frozen in time, but we're just fine

This pavement feels like paradise
This pavement brings us back to life
Hope this road never ends
To the coast with my friends
This pavement feels like paradise
Like paradise

(The blue skies and white sands!
The whole world is in our hands!)
As long as you're with me

(The sunshine and dry land!
We'll make drawn on all our plans!)
As long as you're with me

This pavement feels like paradise
This pavement brings us back to life
Hope this road never ends
To the coast with my friends
This pavement feels like paradise

(Yeah!)

This pavement feels like paradise
This pavement brings us back to life
Hope this road never ends
To the coast with my friends
This pavement feels like paradise
Like paradise

Like paradise

Like paradise (Never ends to the coast with my friends)

Like paradise
