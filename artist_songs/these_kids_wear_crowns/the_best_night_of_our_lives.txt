We're taking it slow
Now that we're home
Let's have one more drink before bed

Just minutes ago
We were on a dancefloor
Under speakers, lights and sweat

When we showed up, we were already gone
It was happy hour all night long

Tonight,
We sang along
With every awful word
In every awful song
But we won't apologize
'Cause me and these friends of mine
We had the best night of our lives

Can't hear anything
My ears, they just ring
And my voice is nearly gone

The DJ was shit
But he played the hits
Every Top 40 song

When we showed up, we were already gone
It was happy hour all night long

Tonight,
We sang along
With every awful word
In every awful song
But we won't apologize
'Cause me and these friends of mine
We had the best night of our lives

Don't you worry, my friends
One day we will do it again

Don't you worry, my friends
One day we will do it again

Tonight,
We sang along
With every awful word
In every awful song
But we won't apologize
'Cause me and these friends of mine
We had the best night of our lives

We're taking it slow
Now that we're home
Let's have one more drink before bed
