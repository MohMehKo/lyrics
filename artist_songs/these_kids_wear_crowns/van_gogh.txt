I wanna feel
I wanna hurt
I want a heart beat, beat, red, loud
My blood, it burns

I wanna gasp
I wanna choke
I want a lungs breathe, breathe, explode
Inhale the smoke

C'mon let's go
C'mon just let the good times roll
Our dark can turn to dusk
All we have is us

C'mon let's go
C'mon these nights are all we know
Our world can turn to dust
All we have, all we have is us

I wanna free
I wanna fall
I want a wings fly, fly, rise up
Above it all

I wanna crash
I wanna burn
I wanna throw, scream, scream, so loud
Stumble and slur

C'mon let's go
C'mon just let the good times roll
Our dark can turn to dusk
All we have is us

C'mon let's go
C'mon these nights are all we know
Our world can turn to dust
All we have, all we have is us

I wanna live
I wanna fly
I wanna draw Van Gogh then color
outside the lines

I wanna run (Yeah!)
I wanna drive
I wanna see the world with you
We'll set sail tonight

C'mon let's go
C'mon just let the good times roll
Our dark can turn to dusk
All we have is us

C'mon let's go
C'mon these nights are all we know
Our world can turn to dust
All we have, all we have is us
