We've got good friends with bad benefits,
We've got a plan, but can't remember it,
We've gotta leave right now if we want to get away with it.

And we know where we're going,
And we know where it's going.

(Oh oh oh oh oh!)

Stay up, stay up,
We don't need a breakdown,
From back seats,
We're the kings of this town,
Straight up, straight up,
We may crash and burn here,
We live life, we don't need the rear view mirror.

We've got the attitude that makes you sick,
We break the rules because we're dangerous,
We're in this for the win,
But we'll play just for the fun of it.

And we know where we're going,
And we know where it's going.

(Oh oh oh oh oh!)

Stay up, stay up,
We don't need a breakdown,
From back seats,
We're the kings of this town,
Straight up, straight up,
We may crash and burn here,
We live life, we don't need the rear view mirror.

It doesn't matter where I'm at,
I have fun because my friends have my back.

Oh!

We go one, two, three!

Stay up, stay up,
We don't need a breakdown,
From back seats,
We're the kings of this town,
Straight up, straight up,
We may crash and burn here,
We live life, we don't need the rear view mirror. [x2]
