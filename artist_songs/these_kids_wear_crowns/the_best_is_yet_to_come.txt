I was 23 years old
Nothing but the clothes on my back to call my own
Was making $20 a day
But that was $10 too much

We headed south with the birds
Made our nest in Fort Worth, Texas
We were feeling like kings that day
Pennies to our name

We're feeling good
And the best is yet to come
Like it should
Yeah, just like it should

We're feeling good
And the best is yet to come
The best is yet to come

I boarded a red eye flight
In the beautiful blue sky late afternoon
Was making $40 a day
But that was $30 too much

We left the frozen True North strong and free
And landed in Australian summer
We were feeling like kings that day
Pennies to our name

We're feeling good
And the best is yet to come
Like it should
Yeah, just like it should

We're feeling good
And the best is yet to come
The best is yet to come

I was 23 years old
Nothing but the clothes on my back to call my own
Was making $20 a day!

We're feeling good
And the best is yet to come
Like it should
Yeah, just like it should

We're feeling good
And the best is yet to come
The best is yet to come

We're feeling good
And the best is yet to come
Like it should
Yeah, just like it should

We're feeling good
And the best is yet to come
The best is yet to come
