I keep waiting but the earth keeps spinning
I keep waiting for the sun to burn us down
I ain't washed away by ocean waves
I keep waiting but the sky's not falling down

I keep waiting for our worlds' colliding
I keep waiting but the moon still pulls us 'round
I ain't washed away by ocean waves
I keep waiting but the sky's not falling down

So when your lights go out
Look up, look up
'Cause the morning is comin' round
Look up, look up

So when your lights go out
Look up, look up
'Cause the morning is comin' round
Look up, look up

So when your lights go out
Look up, look up
'Cause the morning is comin' round
Look up, look up

So when your lights go out
Look up, look up
'Cause the morning is comin' round
Look up, look up

I keep waiting but the earth keeps spinning
I keep waiting but the sky's not falling down

Yeah!
