So please don't look so blue, 
I'll be everything that you need me to, 
Yeah, I'll stay true, 
But there are things I just can't tell you.

Because I've got this feeling, 
This is the beginning now, 
(I've got this feeling, I've got this feeling now)
Look up, 'cuz there's no ceiling, 
Nothing on this haunting town, 
(I've got this feeling, I've got this feeling now).

So let's ride, 
Hold our hands in the open air, 
So let's ride, 
Our bicycles in fairytales.

So please don't look so blue, 
'Cuz I've been thinking, 
I've figured it out, figured it out, 
What you've been meaning when you, 
Tell me that you've
Figured me out, figured me out, 
But that's not true.

'Cuz I've got this feeling, 
This is the beginning now, 
(I've got this feeling, I've got this feeling now)
Look up, 'cuz there's no ceiling, 
Nothing on this haunting town, 
(I've got this feeling, I've got this feeling now).

So let's ride, 
Hold our hands in the open air, 
So let's ride, 
Our bicycles in fairytales. [x2]

Baby, if you don't wanna stay, 
I will take you with me, I will take you with me, 
Baby, we can forget this place, 
I will take you with me, I will take you with me.

Ride, 
Hold our hands in the open air, 
(I will take you with me, I will take you with me)
So let's ride, 
Our bicycles in fairytales.
(I will take you with me, I will take you with me) [x3]

So let's ride.
