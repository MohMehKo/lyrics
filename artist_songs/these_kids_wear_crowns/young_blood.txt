We were once kings
Our castles fell to ashes
Fell to ashes

But we still sing
And now we hold the matches
Hold the matches

We've got young blood in our veins
You can't take it all
Can't take it all away
Why, on young hearts beat again
You can't take it all
Can't take it all away
You can't take it all away

We raised our swords
Through thunder and through lightning
And through lightning

We braved the storms
And raged on the horizon
The horizon

We've got young blood in our veins
You can't take it all
Can't take it all away
Why, on young hearts beat again (Beat again)
You can't take it all
Can't take it all away
You can't take it all away

Who needs diamond rings,
when you're drowning?
Who needs bars of gold,
when you're sinking all alone?

Who needs diamond rings,
when you're drowning?
Who needs bars of gold,
when you're sinking all alone?

Who needs diamond rings,
when you're drowning?
Who needs bars of gold,
when you're sinking all alone?

We've got young blood in our veins
You can't take it all
Can't take it all away (Take it it all away)
Why, on young hearts beat again (Beat again)
You can't take it all
Can't take it all away
You can't take it all away

Who needs diamond rings,
when you're drowning?
Who needs bars of gold,
when you're sinking all alone?

Who needs diamond rings,
when you're drowning?
Who needs bars of gold,
when you're sinking all alone?

Who needs diamond rings?
