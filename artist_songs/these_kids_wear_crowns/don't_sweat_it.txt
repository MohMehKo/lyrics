Baby you can stay if you want to,
You think I'm, bad news well I'm thinking that too

Me, I got a place we can go to,
So grab your coat soon and that drink in front of you

We're breathing in, we're breathing out,
I bet you know what I'm all about
It's knowing when to let it out

Tonight I'm here til I'm gone,
Forget your name but it's on,
The tip of my tongue
Don't sweat it, don't sweat it, don't sweat it at all

We got time, the night is still young
Don't sweat it, don't sweat it, don't sweat it at all

You'll be sad to know that it's not far,
You're into, long drives and I'm into fast cars

Even if we crash it won't leave scars,
You know we're, all stars and we know the night is all ours

We're breathing in, we're breathing out,
I bet you know what I'm all about
It's knowing when to let it out

Tonight I'm here til I'm gone,
Forget your name but it's on,
The tip of my tongue
Don't sweat it, don't sweat it, don't sweat it at all

We got time, the night is still young
Don't sweat it, don't sweat it, don't sweat it at all

Tonight I'm here til I'm gone,
Forget your name but it's on,
The tip of my tongue
Don't sweat it, don't sweat it, don't sweat it at all

We got time, the night is still young
Don't sweat it, don't sweat it, don't sweat it at all

Don't sweat it, don't sweat it, don't sweat it
Don't sweat it, don't sweat it, don't sweat it

She says your name with accents and oh!
I got a bunch of ex's that she knows!

She's into me, cuz I can strut her easy
These girls need drama just to breath oh yeah
She says your name with accents and oh!
I got a bunch of ex's that she knows!

She's into me, cuz I can strut her easy
These girls need drama just to breath oh yeah

These girls need drama just to bre-breath
These girls need drama 

Tonight I'm here til I'm gone,
Forget your name but it's on,
The tip of my tongue
Don't sweat it, don't sweat it, don't sweat it at all

We got time, the night is still young
Don't sweat it, don't sweat it, don't sweat it at all

Tonight I'm here til I'm gone,
Forget your name but it's on,
The tip of my tongue
Don't sweat it, don't sweat it, don't sweat it at all

We got time
Don't sweat it, don't sweat it, don't sweat it at all
