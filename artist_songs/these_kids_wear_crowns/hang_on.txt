So hang on
So hang on
We're gonna be okay
We're gonna be okay
Hang on

Do you feel the storm?
Trying to pull you overboard
When it rains, it pours
Woah oh oh

When you cast aways
Trying to swim to our escape
Keep a steady pace
Woah oh oh

We have to break these bottles
So our message fits inside

So hang on
So hang on
We're gonna be okay
We're gonna be okay

So hang on
So hang on
We're gonna be okay
We're gonna be okay
Hang on

Can you feel the waves?
Trying to wash us all away
Til the shore life fades
Woah oh oh

We're lost out at sea
With our nets parked on the beach
Underneath palm trees
Woah oh oh

We have to break these bottles
So our message fits inside

So hang on
So hang on
We're gonna be okay
We're gonna be okay

So hang on
So hang on
We're gonna be okay
We're gonna be okay
Hang on

Throw me a rope, throw me a rope
We'll swing like pirates through the air
Throw me a rope, throw me a rope

Throw me a rope, throw me a rope
We'll swing like pirates through the air
Throw me a rope, throw me a rope

Throw me a rope, throw me a rope
We'll swing like pirates through the air
Throw me a rope, throw me a rope

We have to break these bottles
So our message fits inside

So hang on
So hang on
We're gonna be okay
We're gonna be okay

So hang on
So hang on
We're gonna be okay
We're gonna be okay
Hang on
