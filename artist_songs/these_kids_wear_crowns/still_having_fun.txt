I don't need a new beginning, no
No starting line, no checkers on the road (on the road)
I don't need a pocket full of gold
No antique wine, no trophy wife at home (wife at home)

It's not that bad
It's not that bad
We're raging in the sun
But we're still having fun

It's not that bad
It's not that bad
Over the hill we've come
But we're still having fun
We're still having fun

I don't need to put this drink down, no
No closing time, no last call, all she roll (all she roll)
I don't need rims
'Cause my wheels' got spokes
No fuel to buy, no entrant to behold

It's not that bad
It's not that bad
We're raging in the sun
But we're still having fun

It's not that bad
It's not that bad
Over the hill we've come
But we're still having fun (We're still having fun)

I'm okay
I'm alright
Oh, I feel good
Tonight

I'm okay (I'm okay)
I'm alright
I feel good
Tonight

It's not that bad
It's not that bad
We're raging in the sun
But we're still having fun

It's not that bad
It's not that bad (Hey!)
Over the hill we come
But we're still having fun
We're still having fun

We're all still here, come on; let's go
We'll quip when we're all sunk six feet below
