Who's that dude in the cherry red suit
Tearing up the floor tonight?
He's shaking his hips, got a sack full of gifts
And a beard that's crazy white

He's got the party rockin'
Candy canes and stockings
Dancing like he's Michael
Spinning like the vinyls

Sleigh bells in the air
Favorite time of year
Where wishes come true,
That's how we do, yeah, that's how we do

Shake, Santa, shake it!
We know you're gonna take it
To the house tonight!
Shake, Santa, shake it!
We know you're gonna make it
Naughty never looked so nice!

[x2:]
We want that merry, merry!
We want that merry, merry!
We want that merry, merry!
Ho-ho-ho, oh yeah!

Let's keep it coming,
And Prancer sipping eggnog V.I.P. (oh, yeah)
Rudolph's checking the list
He ain't never even gonna see

He's got the party rockin'
Candy canes and stockings,
Dancing like he's Michael
Spinning like the vinyls

Sleigh bells in the air
Favorite time of year
Where wishes come true,
That's how we do, yeah, that's how we do

Shake, Santa, shake it!
We know you're gonna take it
To the house tonight.
Shake, Santa, shake it!
We know you're gonna make it
Naughty never looked so nice!

[x2:]
We want that merry, merry!
We want that merry, merry!
We want that merry, merry!
Ho-ho-ho, oh yeah!

[x2:]
Calling all my boys and girls
Shaking up around the world
Everybody celebrate
Drop the beat and hit the brake!

Shake, Santa, shake it!
We know you're gonna take it
To the house tonight.
Shake, Santa, shake it!
We know you're gonna make it,
Best night of our lives!

[x2:]
We want that merry merry
We want that merry merry
We want that merry merry
Ho-ho-ho, oh yeah!
