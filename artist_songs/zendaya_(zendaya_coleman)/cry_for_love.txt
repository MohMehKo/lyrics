I can't say I'm an expert on it
In fact, it's the first time
Anybody's ever made me feel the way you do, boy

It seems like it should be real easy
With two people so right
And yet, I find myself just waiting here
Like I'm just your toy

[Pre-Chorus:]
You take me in, I take you back
Baby, what's the problem?
How we gonna solve it?
But when I call, you don't call back
Will being with your boys always be more important?

[Chorus:]
I cry for love
I don't think I'm supposed to
Cry for love
Is something wrong with me? Maybe I'm not
Right for love
Sometimes I wonder why I even
Try for us
I shouldn't have to cry for love

Oh, no, oh, no
I really wanna ask my girls
But they'll think I'm a fool
So much for watching all those fairytales
With happy endings

I wish I could've been prepared
For all your stupid games
I need to give it up
'Cause I don't have a chance of winning

[Pre-Chorus:]
You take me in, I take you back
Baby, what's the problem?
How we gonna solve it?
But when I call, you don't call back
Will being with your boys always be more important

[Chorus:]
I cry for love
I don't think I'm supposed to
Cry for love
Is something wrong with me? Maybe I'm not
Right for love
Sometimes I wonder why I even
Try for us
I shouldn't have to cry for love

What am I doing? What am I doing?
This doesn't happen to girls like me
Look in the mirror, look in the mirror
Seeing your eyes red is not a cute thing

I don't wanna cry no more
I don't wanna cry no more
I got too much pride to be in my room asking why

[Chorus x2:]
I cry for love
I don't think I'm supposed to
Cry for love
Is something wrong with me? maybe I'm not
Right for love
Sometimes I wonder why I even
Try for us
I shouldn't have to cry for love
