I wish that we could do it over again,
Every smile, every tear, every part
Cause I know nothing ever will end,
If it's safe inside our hearts
So let's move on but never let go,
As we take these steps on our own
Whatever will be, I'll remember you so remember me

Remember me, and I'll be there.
Remember me, when you feel lost somewhere
And I know with just one magic touch, it can all reappear.
Whenever you need a good memory, remember me.

Looking at everyone now,
I know how hard it'll be to move on.
But I swear somewhere out there,
We'll find where we belong.
And I know it won't be easy.
But in my heart, I'll carry you with me.
Whatever you do,
Remember me and I'll remember you.

Remember me, and I'll be there.
Remember me, when you feel lost somewhere
And I know with just one magic touch, it can all reappear.
Whenever you need a good memory, remember me.

So many new days up ahead,
And I'm excited to see all of them.
But please don't forget about this time,
Just close your eyes and...

Remember me, and I'll be there.
Remember me, when you feel lost somewhere.
And I know with just one magic touch, it can all reappear.
Whenever you need a good memory, remember me.
Whenever you need a good memory, remember me.
