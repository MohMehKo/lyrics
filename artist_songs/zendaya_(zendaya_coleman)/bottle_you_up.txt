If loving you were a crime,
I'd do the hardest time
You are perfection, nearly every time, yeah
You know it kills me
I can't always be right here
'Cause right now you love me
Then you disappear

Wish I could always have you here with me
Wish I could hold ya, never let you leave
Wish I could put it away, save it for a rainy day
Wish I could bottle you up
If I wanna hear your voice inside of me
I'll drink it up and you're alive in me
Then I could put it away, save it for a rainy day
Wish I could bottle you up, bottle you up

Right now you're mine
But we're running out of time
It's part of the rush, it's taking me high (high)
You know it kills me
We can't always be right here
'Cause right now you love me
Then you disappear

Wish I could always have you here with me
Wish I could hold ya, never let you leave
Wish I could put it away, save it for a rainy day
Wish I could bottle you up
If I wanna hear your voice inside of me,
I'll drink it up and you're alive in me
Then I could put it away, save it for a rainy day
Wish I could bottle you up [x10]

Wish I could always have you here with me (here with me)
Wish I could hold ya, never let you leave
Wish I could put it away, save it for a rainy day
Wish I could bottle you up
If I wanna hear your voice inside of me,
I'll drink it up and you're alive in me
When I can put it away, save it for a rainy day
Wish I could bottle you up [x7]

Then I could put it away, save it for a rainy day
Wish I could bottle you up
Bottle you up.
