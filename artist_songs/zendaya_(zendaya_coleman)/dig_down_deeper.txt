Dig down deep and break the streak [x2]

You can watch your garden grow
And skim along the surface, and take it slow
Just let nature have it's way
And let your little flowers bloom where they may

If you dig down deeper under the ground
Oh yeah, got to dig down deeper, girl you can
If you're wanting to win, then you better begin
To get a little bit dirty and dig deep down

You can keep things as they've always been
And you'll never leave the row
You've been planting in
Take a chance and make a leap
Anything can happen when you dig down deep

So dig down deeper under the ground
You gotta dig down deeper girl you can
If you're wanting to win, than you better begin
To get a little bit dirty and dig deep down

Come on and dig deep down!

So you decide to make your stand
Step up and put the world to shame
There may be no luck on your head
If you didn't choose this game
You don't want to lose this game

So dig down deeper under the ground
You gotta dig down deeper girl you can
If you're wanting to win, [x2]
Than you better begin
To get a little bit dirty and dig deep down

You got a dig down, yeah
Ooh, you got a dig down
