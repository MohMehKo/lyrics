[Verse 1:]
[Bella:]
I don't need no one to tell me how to feel the beat
And I don't need no beat to tell me how to move my feet
[Zendaya:]
Just go and do what you do 'cause there's nothin' to prove
[Bella:]
I'm just bein' me watch me do me
I don't need no magazine to tell me who to be
And I don't need to pose for p-p-p-paparazzi
[Zendaya:]
Just keep the cameras flashin', to try to catch this action
[Bella:]
I'm just bein' me w-watch me do me, me, me, me

[Chorus:]
[Zendaya:]
Light up the floor, play me one more
[Bella:]
Let me hear that
[Zendaya:]
Click clack on the high hat feel the bass vibrate feel the room rock
Light up the floor, just like before
[Bella:]
Let me hear that
[Zendaya:]
Bass drop on the boombox, make your heart stop, feel the room rock!
[Zendaya:]
I'm doin' all I want to do, and I won't stop until I can't move
I'm just bein' me watch me, do me, me, me

[Verse 2:]
[Bella:]
I don't need no music when I wanna sing a song
I don't need what's popular to know what's right or wrong
[Zendaya:]
I'm busy burning the track, not holdin' anything back
[Bella:]
I'm just bein' me w-watch me do me, me, me, me

[Chorus:]
[Zendaya:]
Light up the floor, play me one more
[Bella:]
Let me hear that
[Zendaya:]
Click clack on the high hat feel the bass vibrate feel the room rock
Light up the floor, just like before
[Bella:]
Let me hear that
[Zendaya:]
Bass drop on the boombox make your heart stop
[Together:]
Feel the room rock!
[Zendaya:]
I'm doin' all I want to do and I won't stop until I can't move
[Bella:]
I'm just bein' me watch me, do me, me, me

[Bridge:]
[Bella:]
I'm ready, I'm, I'm ready to go
[Zendaya:]
L-let, l-let it, l-l-let it explode
I'm ready, I'm, I'm ready to go, to go!
[Bella:]
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

[Chorus:]
[Zendaya:]
Light up the floor, play me one more
[Bella:]
Let me hear that
[Zendaya:]
Click clack on the high hat feel the bass vibrate feel the room rock
Light up the floor, just like before
[Bella:]
Let me hear that
[Zendaya:]
Bass drop on the boombox make your heart stop
[Zendaya:]
I'm doin' all I want to do and I won't stop until I can't move
[Bella:]
I'm just bein' me watch me, do me, me, me
[Bella:]
Watch me; do me, me, me
[Zendaya:]
Watch me, watch me!
