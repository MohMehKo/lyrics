A dream like this
Not something you wish for
A dream like this
Not something you ask for
When it's a gift worth taking a chance for
Then this is something you dance for

Hey yeah, yeah,
Ohhhh, this is something you dance for

There's a moment when you look to decide
Who will fall, who will survive
That's the moment when you find it inside
On the line, this is your time

And it's all I want
And it's all I do

A dream like this
Not something you wish for
A dream like this
Not something you ask for
When it's a gift worth taking a chance for
Then this is something you dance for

Can you believe it, are you feeling alive?
Hit your mark, ready to rise
Your body's aching but your heart doesn't mind
Feet on the ground, eyes on the prize

And it's all I want
And it's all I do

A dream like this
Not something you wish for
A dream like this
Not something you ask for
When it's a gift worth taking a chance for
Then this is something you dance for

A dream like this
Not something you wish for
A dream like this
Not something you ask for
When it's a gift worth taking a chance for
Then this is something you dance for

For the love, for the fame
To bring down the rain
By the way that you feel
When they're calling your name
For the days, nothing more
It's just you on the floor
Ooh, this is something you dance for

A dream like this
Not something you wish for
A dream like this
Not something you ask for
When it's a gift worth taking a chance for
Then this is something you dance for

A dream like this
Not something you wish for
A dream like this
Not something you ask for
When it's a gift worth taking a chance for...
