[Chorus:]
We should listened to each other's hearts
Fall in love in ever part
We can make it happen if you bout that action

Here we go again, here we go again
You know you wanna be my baby [x2]

Still we beat that's how I'm feeling,
Let' em know we in the buildin'
From the floor up to the ceiling
If you bout it let's start chillin'
Doing moving we can party
Who's in our business? Everybody
But it's alright 'cause I'm still living
Like 2 Chainz baby I'm different, come here now

[Pre-Chorus:]
Let me tell you little some' little some'
That you might wanna know about me
I don't play no game, baby listen
Baby if you can love me then come show me!

[Chorus:]
We should listened to each other's hearts
Fall in love in ever part
We can make it happen if you bout that action

Here we go again, here we go again
You know you wanna be my baby [x2]

Darling we should take a ride
Cruising, flirting while we drive
Nothing could come kill our vibe
Got no worries on my mind
Now we're living, living good
Young and misunderstood,
Got me tripping, you drive me crazy
You know you wanna be my baby.

[Pre-Chorus:]
Let me tell you little some' little some'
That you might wanna know about me
I don't play no game, baby listen
Baby if you can love me then come show me!

[Chorus:]
We should listened to each other's hearts
Fall in love in ever part
We can make it happen if you bout that action

Here we go again, here we go again
You know you wanna be my baby [x2]

Even though I'm on the grind
Think about you all the time
Now I know, that you're the one
Let's have fun, have fun, while we're young.

[Chorus:]
We should listened to each other's hearts
Fall in love in ever part
We can make it happen if you bout that action

Here we go again, here we go again
You know you wanna be my baby [x2]
