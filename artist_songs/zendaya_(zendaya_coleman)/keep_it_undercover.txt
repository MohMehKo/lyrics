Ooh
Ooh

Oh, when danger comes for you
You know I'll stand beside ya'
'Cause ain't nobody keep they head so
Cool, I'll always find a way, a way out of the fire
Don't tell nobody, tell nobody
I'm not perfect, so many things I wanna tell you,
But I I I, I keep it undercover!

Living my life, on red alert
Doing my thing, gon' make it work
Know I'm the realest, baby I'm fearless
But I always got your back
Nobody can do it like I can
I gotta find out who I am
Ain't got to worry about me
It's all part of the plan
(I keep it undercover
I keep it undercover)

You know I'll always find the truth
No matter where is hiding
So you can always run but you can't hide
Keep it classified, I'll always fight my fighting
'Cause it's all or nothing, all or nothing

I'm not perfect, so many things I wanna tell you,
But I I I, I keep it undercover!

Living my life, on red alert
Doing my thing, gon' make it work
Know I'm the realest, baby I'm fearless
But I always got your back
Nobody can do it like I can
I gotta find out who I am
Ain't got to worry about me
It's all part of the plan

If your back's against the wall
You know, you got to do is call me
I'm doing the impossible,
So you just got to trust me
You ain't got to worry 'bout it,
You ain't got to have to doubt it
I'll be there no matter what it takes
I keep it undercover!

Living my life, on red alert
Doing my thing, gon' make it work
Know I'm the realest, baby I'm fearless
But I always got your back
Nobody can do it like I can
I gotta find out who I am
Ain't got to worry about me
It's all part of the plan (It's all part of the plan)

I keep it undercover!
I keep it undercover!
I keep it undercover!
