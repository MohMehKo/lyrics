Got my hands in the air
Heels on the floor
On the count of three
Everybody's gonna go
Crazy! Aye

It's about to be a problem
Dressed right, feel hot like a model
Hit release you know you wanna
Get you lucky, like you hit the lotto

[Pre-Chorus:]
Can see it by the way we walk
They all just stop
And all you wanna do is watch
The way we rock
Get up at you
Get up hop
Now set it off

Don't let you, want it, count it
Now make it drop

You know DJ turn it up
You know that we never stop

[Chorus:]
They go dum-diddy-dum when they see me though
All eyes on me like a video
Sing it left, sing it right
It's about to go
Go Crazy!

[Solo:]
Got my hands in the air
Heels on the top
Got my hands in the air
Heels on the floor
Got my girls everywhere
Cause that's just how we roll
We're the type that'll make the boys go
Crazy!

See they right up from the bottom
Right back, don't step front without em
Till we really on the bottom I'm
Zswaggin' hollerin I'm a model

[Pre-Chorus:]
Can see it by the way we walk
They all just stop
And all you wanna do is watch
The way we rock
Get up at you
Get up hop
Now set it off

Don't let you, want it, count it
Now make it drop

You know Dj turn it up
You know that we never stop

[Chorus:]
They go dum-diddy-dum when they see me though
All eyes on me like a video
Sing it left, sing it right
It's about to go
Go Crazy!

[Solo:]
Got my hands in the air
Heels on the floor
Got my hands in the air
Heels on the floor
My girls everywhere
Cause that's just how we roll
We're the type that'll make the boys go
Crazy

[Rap - Zendaya:]
Roll with, hit ten
Roll in, what's my name
Step in make your boyfriend
Disappear like T-Plane
My own woman don't need a name
I act like your mean ten
I'm under age, no contraband
I'm on stage with the same band
Ya'll ain't, half that price
I want it now, don't ask twice
I'm reaching out to off the wall
Son get your feet right on the ball
I'm sticking out like a grown woman
Didn't I say my own woman
Bout time I say yes
Twice I say yes
This time tell I'm a old woman

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus x2]
