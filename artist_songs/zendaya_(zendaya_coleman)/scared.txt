Baby I can't live without you
I'm slowly dying

[Verse 1:]
You leave, just me
These walls watching me bleed
I'm screaming, I'm hurting,
I'm begging you for mercy

Forgive me for the things I did, the things I said, if you understand
Forgive me and I'll forgive you.

[Pre-Chorus:]
For playing my heart like a cello
Strumming me a longer, beating like a drummer
Oh, I just wanna love ya, I just wanna love ya
I just wanna love ya, I just wanna love ya
Scared of what it feels like to be alone

[Chorus:]
Scared of what it feels like to miss you
Scared of what it feels like not to kiss you
Scared of what it feels like to be alone, yeah.
(You're scared, you're scared, you're scared, you're scared)

[Verse 2:]
No you, no me
It's just the shadows I see
No savior, hell Marie,
Who's gonna rescue me?

Forgive me for the things I did, the things I said, if you understand
Forgive me and I'll forgive you.

[Pre-Chorus:]
For playing my heart like a cello
Strumming me a longer, beating like a drummer
Oh, I just wanna love ya, I just wanna love ya
I just wanna love ya, I just wanna love ya
Scared of what it feels like to be alone

[Chorus:]
Scared of what it feels like to miss ya
Scared of what it feels like not to kiss ya
Scared of what it feels like to be alone, yeah.
(You're scared, you're scared, you're scared, you're scared)

[Bridge:]
Baby I can't live without you
I'm slowly dying

Baby without you I'm scared.

[Chorus:]
Scared of what it feels like to miss ya
Scared of what it feels like not to kiss ya
Scared of what it feels like to be alone, yeah.
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
