[Verse 1:]
Yo! it's like my world premiere
Every step I take has never been so clear
Every move I make I feel the whole earthquake
And I'm a shake it and shake it and shake it and make no mistake

[Pre-Chorus:]
You gotta get up get up get up to get down
Like get up get up get up to get down
Get up get up get up to get down
Like get up get up get up to get down

[Chorus:]
I'm Back
And I'm rocking the club
Everybody looking at me better show me some love
I'm Back
Feeling better the best
Put a million new moves cause the beat is so fresh
I'm Back
How you like me now?
Feeling like I'm sitting on a hundred thou
I'm Back
At the top of my game
Dance for my life and that ain't gon change

[Verse 2:]
Yo! this is my grand finale
Cause I'm rocking everywhere
From Manhattan to Cali
Yeah I'm on my game
Just not forget my name
Baby shake it shake it shake it til we break the frame

[Pre-Chorus:]
You gotta get up get up get up to get down
Like get up get up get up to get down
Get up get up get up to get down
Like get up get up get up to get down

[Chorus:]
I'm Back
And I'm rocking the club
Everybody looking at me better show me some love
I'm Back
Feeling better the best
Put a million new moves cause the beat is so fresh
I'm Back
How you like me now
Feeling like I'm sitting on a hundred thou
I'm Back
At the top of my game
Dance for my life and that ain't gon change

[Pre-Chorus:]
You gotta get up get up get up to get down
Like get up get up get up to get down
Get up get up get up to get down
Like get up get up get up to get down

[Chorus:]

And I'm rocking the club
Everybody looking at me better show me some love

Feeling better the best
Put a million new moves cause the beat is so fresh
I'm Back
How you like me now
Feeling like I'm sitting on a hundred thou
I'm Back
At the top of my game
Dance for my life and that ain't gon change
That's a wrap!
