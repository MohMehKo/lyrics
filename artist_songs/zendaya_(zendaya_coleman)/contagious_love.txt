Contagious love

[Verse 1:]
[Bella:]
It might rain just a little but
Yeah we dance in it
Rock to the rhythm
And we put our hands with it
One life to live
So we live it to the fullest
Young and free yeah
You know how we do it
[Zendaya:]
Head in the clouds
And the sun shines bright
Hope in your eyes
And it shines that light
Gravity itself couldn't hold you down
Joy inside in the merry go-round
[Bella:]
And we bring it right back
Positive energy, magnetic attraction
Ha ha so we spread that love
Now everybody share it now
Do it all together now

[Chorus:]
[Zendaya:]
Give me up some love
Everybody need contagious love
[Bella:]
And I'll be happy with just enough love
Let me get that contagious love like
[Zendaya:]
Give me up some love
Everybody need contagious love
[Bella:]
And I'll be happy with just enough love
Give me, give me that contagious love like

[Verse 2:]
[Bella:]
We put smiles over frowns
And we laugh without reason
Live out loud
Cause our hearts still beating
Sing on the elevator
Watch the people stare
Capture reaction the moment's still there
[Zendaya:]
These are the times
That we live for
So do it big make it count
Reel it in slow
Cause the clock don't stop
Time won't stand still
You steal every moment that you can feel
[Bella:]
Ha ha so we spread that love
Now everybody share it now
Do it all together now [x2]
(And it'll all work out)

[Chorus:]
[Zendaya:]
Give me up some love
Everybody need contagious love
[Bella:]
And I'll be happy with just enough love
Let me get that contagious love like
[Zendaya:]
Give me up some love
Everybody need contagious love
[Bella:]
And I'll be happy with just enough love
Give me give me that contagious love

[Bridge:]
[Zendaya:]
You ain't gotta worry about a thing
It'll be alright
[Bella:]
And it'll be alright
[Zendaya:]
You You ain't gotta worry

[Bella:]
It might rain just a little but
Yeah we dance in it
Rock to the rhythm
And we put our hands with it
One life to live
So we live it to the fullest
Young and free yeah
You know how we do it

[Zendaya:]
Give me up some love
Everybody need contagious love

[Bella:]
And I'll be happy with just enough love
Let me get that contagious love like

[Zendaya:]
