[Verse 1 - Bella:]
We shook it up
Inside of the dance floor
Made our mark
Redefined the dance floor
We busting down the front door
Take it from the top

[Zendaya:]
Look whose back
We got the new moves
Less talk more dance
And that's proof
Turn it up
And do how we do
Take it from the top

[Pre-Chorus - Both:]
Cause now we rolling up new
And it's just me and my crew
Here come the sequel debut
We breaking through
Already here in the zone
Feels like we conquered the throne
Yeah it's so good to be home

[Chorus:]
This Is My Dance floor
My Dance floor
This is the night
So let's bring up the lights
This Is My Dance floor
My Dance Floor
Everything more
Never seen this before
I'm stepping now
To a whole new beat
Taking the crowd
From their seats to their feet
Back with a new score
It's what I live for
This Is My Dance floor

[Verse 2 - Bella:]
Think they're better
Beta tested
Alphabetically perfected
So hot it's boiling over
Just to give you full disclosure

[Pre-Chorus - Both:]
Cause now we rolling up new
And it's just me and my crew
Here come the sequel debut
We breaking through
Already here in the zone
Feels like we conquered the throne
Yeah it's so good to be home

[Chorus:]
This Is My Dance floor
My Dance floor
This is the night
So let's bring up the lights
This Is My Dance floor
My Dance floor
Everything more
Never seen this before
I'm stepping now
To a whole new beat
Taking the crowd
From their seats to their feet
Back with a new score
It's what I live for
This Is My Dance floor [x2]

[Verse 3:]
Cause now we rolling up new
And it's just me and my crew
Already here in the zone
Feels like we conquered the throne
Yeah it's so good to be home

[Chorus:]
This Is My Dance floor
My Dance floor
This is the night
So let's bring up the lights
This Is My Dance floor
My Dance Floor

To a whole new beat
Taking the crowd
From their seats to their feet
Back with a new score

My Dance floor
This is the night
So let's bring up the lights
This is my Dance floor...
