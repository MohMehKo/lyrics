Sparks turn to flames
When hearts start to chase
You'll fall if you run right into the smoke
The lights start to dim when it's almost enough
But flames light this place.

[Chorus:]
Fireflies tonight
'Cause love lights the sky
Hey yeah

So put it up in, put it up in the air
Put it up in, put love in the air.
So put it up in, put it up in the air
Put it up in, put love in the air.

Baby, it's only right that you share
Pass the love and put it in the atmosphere
If you want keep it warm
Living in the air
Just keep it your rotation so the clouds go nowhere
Just please light this place, oh oh oh oh

[Chorus:]
Fireflies tonight
'Cause love lights the sky
(Hey yeah)

[x2:]
So put it up in, put it up in the air
Put it up in, put love in the air.
So put it up in, put it up in the air
Put it up in, put love in the air.

Let it burn, burn
Let it burn, burn
Let it burn, burn
Let it burn, burn

[Chorus:]
Fireflies tonight
'Cause love lights the sky

[x2:]
So put it up in, put it up in the air
Put it up in, put love in the air.
So put it up in, put it up in the air
Put it up in, put love in the air.
