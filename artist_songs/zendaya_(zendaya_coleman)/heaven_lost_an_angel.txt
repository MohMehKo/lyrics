I'm walking like a model
He watching like Movado
We up like where the space is
Get down like we're the basses
So for real though,
You know the deal though
You're so hot, I'm so froze
Got my heart in the choke hold,
Love on overload

Real recognize real
And I know that's what you are, yeah
Like a hundred dollar bill
Quite frankly, I've been waiting to spend time with you
Time with you

[Pre-Chorus:]
Somebody turn the lights down for me
Don't take your eyes off of me
Just keep your eyes all over me
Somebody turn the lights down
For me, the only place I need to be
Is right here with you next to me, next to me

[Chorus:]
And I know, I know, I know,
Heaven lost an angel... tonight
And I know, I know, I know,
Heaven lost an angel
'Cause you're right here, yeah right here
Next to me, next to me, next to me, next to me
Heaven lost an angel 'cause you're right here yeah right here
Next to me, next to me, next to me, next to me
Heaven lost an angel... tonight, tonight

I hope you're the one, if not
If not I need 'em just like you
I know God was having fun
When he was spending all that extra time on you

[Pre-Chorus:]
Can somebody turn the lights down for me
Don't take your eyes off of me
Just keep your eyes all over me
Somebody turn the lights down
For me, the only place I need to be
Is right here with you next to me, next to me

[Chorus:]
And I know, I know, I know,
Heaven lost an angel... tonight
And I know, I know, I know,
Heaven lost an angel
'Cause you're right here, yeah right here
Next to me, next to me, next to me, next to me
Heaven lost an angel 'cause you're right here yeah right here
Next to me, next to me, next to me, next to me
Heaven lost an angel... tonight, tonight

I'm walking like a model
He watching like Movado
We up like we're the spaces
Get down like we're the basses
So for real though,
You know the deal though
You're so hot, I'm so froze
Got my heart in the choke hold,
Love on overload

[Chorus:]
And I know, I know, I know,
Heaven lost an angel... tonight
And I know, I know, I know,
Heaven lost an angel
'Cause you're right here, yeah, right here
Next to me, next to me, next to me, next to me
Heaven lost an angel 'cause you're right here, yeah, right here
Next to me, next to me, next to me, next to me
Heaven lost an angel... tonight, tonight
