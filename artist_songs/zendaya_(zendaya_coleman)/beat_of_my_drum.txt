Looking for a bit of trouble
I wanna have a little fun tonight
Watch me while I speed it up
Count down, get it, get it, turn it up

(Ha!) Gon' work it just like that
Follow me until the game's over
Move closer, bring it back
Marching like a comeback soldier

I can't help myself
I could be your drummer girl
Move it like this
Loving how you put it down with me
Move to the beat of my drum

Got it like aye boom da da
Ah oh aye boom da da
Got it like aye boom da da
Ah oh move to the beat of my drum

Got it like aye
Hey!
Got, got it like aye
Hey
Move, move to the beat of my drum
Got it like

Show me if you got it ah
Lemme see your game face on for me
Work it, don't you make it stop
Partying with my shades on baby
I could be a ringleader yeah
Calling all the shots tonight
Giving you a little fever
So keep it going 'til the sun rise

Gon' work that just like that
Follow me until the game's over
Move closer, bring it back
Marching like a comeback soldier

I can't help myself
I could be your drummer girl
Move it like this
Loving how you put it down with me
Move to the beat of my drum

Got it like aye boom da da
Ah oh aye boom da da
Got it like aye boom da da
Ah oh move to the beat of my drum
Got it like aye

So if you wanna break it down
Gotta keep up with the rhythm now

Hey

Move it like this
Loving how you put it down with me
Move to the beat of my drum

Got it like aye

I can't help myself
I could be your drummer girl
Move it like this
Loving how you put it down with me
Move to the beat of my drum

Got it like aye boom da da

Ah oh move to the beat of my drum
