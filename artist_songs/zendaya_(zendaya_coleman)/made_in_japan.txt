Every avenue in Tokyo is saying that I'm gonna make it
It's offering the two of us a chance, and knows oh we're gonna take it
All we need to do is lead us to the floor, It'll detonate us
We'll show 'em what the beat is for, into the chord, gotta celebrate us

Made in Japan! Oh!
We're Made in Japan!
Made in Japan! Oh!
We're Made in Japan!
Made in Japan! Oh!
We're Made in Japan!
Made in Japan! Oh!
We're Made in Japan!

Woke up in another world, now we're on as samba girls
Getting our kimono on, singing karaoke songs
Eating sushi, drinking tea, in the shade of maple trees
Lotus flowers everywhere, Breathing in exotic air
The manga artists take a bow, Animes with total wow
My imagination sparks, when I'm in Yoyogi Park

Could it be this distant land, scrambled crossing upper plans?
Loving cosplay, gotta say
Sayonara, U.S.A

Made in Japan! Oh!
We're Made in Japan!
Made in Japan! Oh!
We're Made in Japan!
OH Oh OH
Made in Japan!
Made in Japan!
Made in Japan!
Made in Japan!
Made in Japan!
Made in Japan!
Made in Japan!
Made in Japan!
