That body go go, go go, go go go go
Go go go go go go go go
Go go, go go, go go go go
Go go go go go go go go

Hey you just standing there
Heard them say that you can move baby

So won't you make like a diamond
Let me see you shining,
I'm take the lead tonight, boy

[Pre-Chorus:]
Get you on the floor
Don't hurt nobody
Can't you see we were made just to move our bodies
Forget about the crowd, it gonna be the party
If you say you can dance, boy then here come on it!

[Chorus:]
Putcha body down, putcha body down
Putcha body down, putcha body down (come on it!)
Putcha body down, putcha body down
Putcha body down, putcha body down
That body go go, go go, go go go go
Go go go go go go go go
That body go go, go go, go go go go
Go go go go go go go go
That body.

Baby I can tell you got it
(Love the way you do it)
And tonight the floor is ours baby
I hope you're ready for a round 2 n
Let me show you how I do
I'm a run it down tonight, boy

[Pre-Chorus:]
Get you on the floor
Don't hurt nobody
Can't you see we were made just to move our bodies
Forget about the crowd, it gonna be the party
If you say you can dance, boy then here come on it!

[Chorus:]
Putcha body down, putcha body down
Putcha body down, putcha body down (come on it!)
Putcha body down, putcha body down
Putcha body down, putcha body down
That body go go, go go, go go go go
Go go go go go go go go
That body go go, go go, go go go go
Go go go go go go go go
That body.

Ok I like the way you move it
Show me how you do this
(Put your body down)
Now watch me like a movie
I'm a get it into it
(Put your body down)

Come on! (come on, come on!)
Come on! (come on, come on!)

[Pre-Chorus:]
Get you on the floor
Don't hurt nobody
Can't you see we were made just to move our bodies
Forget about the crowd, it gonna be the party
If you say you can dance, boy then here come on it!

[Chorus:]
Putcha body down, putcha body down
Putcha body down, putcha body down (come on it!)
Putcha body down, putcha body down
Putcha body down, putcha body down
That body go go, go go, go go go go
Go go go go go go go go
That body go go, go go, go go go go
Go go go go go go go go
That body.
