Like a message in a bottle
Put my heart out there
(Ooo, yeah)
Tried to strum me like a guitar
Couldn't play the part no
(Not, yeah yeah)
So I locked my heart away
Build up my wall
Nobody could figure me
Out at all
Don't know how you got me, showed
Me like a prodigy

So I [x2] I just jumped for you
I jumped with no parachute
Cause you took away all of my
Fear of flying and I just
Jumped for you and jumped
With no parachute

To good to be true one
Must I believe it
(Noo, yeah)
But you keep on knocking it
Down brick by brick
(Ohh, yeah)
Tried to lock my heart
Away build up my wall
Then you came along and
Torn it down, yeah
Boy you got me, showed
Me like a prodigy

So I [x2] I jumped for you
I jumped with no parachute
Cause you took away all of my
Fear of flying and I just
Jumped for you and jumped
With no parachute

Cause you took away all of my
Fear of my flying and I just
Jumped for you and jumped
With no parachute

And jumped with no parachute
Cause you took away all of my
Fear of flying and I just
Jumped for you yeah I just
Jumped for you

So I jumped for you I
Jumped with no parachute
Cause you took away all of my
Fear of flying and I just
Jumped for you and jumped
With no parachute
So I jumped for you I
Jumped with no parachute

Cause you took away all of my
Fear of flying and I just
Jumped for you and jumped
With no parachute
