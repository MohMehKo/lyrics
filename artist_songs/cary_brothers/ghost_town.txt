Light a match and burn this all down
Suffocate the voices in doubt
Nothing here is falling in place
A map that points to all our mistakes

Too much to handle too much to take 
This is a ghost town
Too far to go to get to here
Too much of this sound
I need a light, I need to know when I can break out
Tell me it's safe now
Tell me it's safe now

Spiders crawling down from the walls
They might be listening to this call
Are you even all that you say?
The chemicals, they make me this way

Too much to handle, much too late
This is a ghost town
Too far to go to get to hear too much of this sound
I need a sign I need to know when I can break out
Tell me it's safe now 
Tell me it's safe now

When everybody acts like a game
Are we really just filling space
But all the pieces, they don't add up to none

Too much to handle, much to take
This is a ghost town
Too far to go to get to here too much of this sound
I need a light, I need to know when I can break out
Tell me it's safe now
Tell me it's safe now
Light a match and burn this all down
