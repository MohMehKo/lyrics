Breaking your heart was never my intention
Playing with parts too fragile in the ending

We have become alien, we have become alien
Give me a song that weighs a ton
We have become alien

Stop and we start, asking all the questions
Raising alarm, a symptom of the tension
Though we're unarmed, we fumble through the trenches
Taking apart all that we invented

We have become alien
We have become alien
Give me a song that weighs a ton
We have become alien

We played the part til comfort's gone
Now the only language is loss
The language of loss

We have become alien
We have become alien
Give me a song that weighs a ton
We have become alien
