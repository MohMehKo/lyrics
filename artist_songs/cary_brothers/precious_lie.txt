Your whisper lightly
Your stakes are high
It's all denial
This waking life

So you are my precious lie
I told you I would break your heart

You were so in love
I was so inspired

The stones are thrown
It's all laid bare
My non-stick mind 
Was hardly there

So you are my precious lie
I sold you out for one last high

You were so in love
I was so inspired

It's so cold out
We are the righteous
Come and stay, you are my love

It's so cold out
We are the righteous
Come and stay, you are my love

It's so cold out
We are the righteous
Come and stay, you are my love

So you are my precious lie
I told you I would break your heart
