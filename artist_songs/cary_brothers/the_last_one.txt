Did you know
That the right won?
Another fool
You're the sidearm

And it's enough
That you broadcast
You got the touch

This is the last one
This is the last one

Did you find
What you wanted?
Another match
For the straw man

I've had enough
It can bleed through
You think you're tough

Well, this is the last one
This is the last one

Hold on to me
One more night
Hold on to me
Can't take it all
Can't take it all

And you know
That I need you
But you know
I can see through you

This is the last one
You can't take it all
