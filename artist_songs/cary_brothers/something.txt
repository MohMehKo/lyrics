And you think you're alone as if I wasn't there
You’re losing your faith in me
It’s a car, it's a crash, it's a death, and you're scared
You just can't escape the scene

Hush now you're insane
Touch my skin, come back again
The sky is falling

It’s something you cannot fake
This something you will not shake
Just walk away before I look at you
It’s something only you can take

All your words, it's a lie to yourself, it's a home
There’s so much that you can't see
It’s a bomb that can kill everyone, and it blows
You can't even hear me scream

Hush now you're insane
Touch my skin, come back again
The sky is falling

It’s something you cannot fake
This something you will not shake
Just walk away before I look at you
It’s something only you can take

This is only feeling with no thought
Is this love?
What happened to the promises I bought?
Is this love?

It’s something you cannot fake
This something you will not shake
Just walk away before I look at you
It’s something only you can take
