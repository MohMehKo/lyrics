It's about time for our favorite show
Where you're watching, I don't know
When you hear our favorite song
Do you still sing along?

And I'll take the hard harmony
If you'll please just let me be
And I'll wish you only peace
If you'll please just let me be

And I hear you say my name
On the message that you left, again
The language that nobody knows
But where does all the memories go?

I'll forgive you all your misdeeds
If you'll please just let me be
And I'll wish you only peace
If you'll please just let me be

Love is an island
It's a shame we won't find it
Love is an island
It's a shame we won't find it
Love is an island
It's a shame we won't find it
Love is an island
It's a shame
It's a shame
It's a shame
It's a shame

Love
Love
Love
Love

I'll take the hard harmony
If you'll please just let me be
Won't you please just let me be?

Love is an island
It's a shame we won't find it
Love is an island
It's a shame we won't find it
Love is an island
It's a shame we won't find it
(Won't you please just let me be?)
Love is an island
It's a shame
It's a shame
It's a shame
It's a shame

(Won't you please just let me be?)
Love
(Won't you please just let me be?)
Love
(Won't you please just let me be?)
Love
(Won't you please just let me be?)
Love
