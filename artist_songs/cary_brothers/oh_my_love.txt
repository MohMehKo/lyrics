Calm down
Stop with the big words
You know pretending
Will get us nowhere
It's a choice, now
Take what we wanted
Thinking in voices
Loud and clear

'Cause I know that you're running away
And I'll focus on what I can hold now
Sadness can wait
The sadness can wait for a day

Oh, my love
Tell me the sweet lie
Oh, my love
Forget about time
Oh, my love
Tell me we're alright
Oh, my love
Just for tonight
Just for tonight
Oh, my love

Show me the old town
Show me your best times
We'll go on a long drive
To where your mind goes at night
Say anything you want
If it makes you feel better
'Cause I know you're already gone

Oh, my love
Tell me the sweet lie
Oh, my love
Forget about time
Oh, my love
Tell me we're alright
Oh, my love
Just for tonight
Just for tonight
Oh, my love
Just for tonight
Oh, my love
