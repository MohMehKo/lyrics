Touched by all of your grace
The only one to see my other face

Is it too much to ask of you
To stay inside with me?
Is it too much to ask of you
To keep me alive?

It's my jealousy
Creepin' up on me
Just my jealousy
Creepin' up on me

Fortunes could fall upon your kiss
Everyone a suitor I could miss

Is it too much to ask of you
To stay inside with me?
Is it too much to ask of you
To keep me alive?

It's my jealousy
Creepin' up on me
Just my jealousy
Creepin' up on me

Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah

No, this jealousy
Won't get to me
Nom this jealousy
Won't get to me

You set me free
Your love set me free
You put your armor on me
You put your armor on me
You put your armor on me
