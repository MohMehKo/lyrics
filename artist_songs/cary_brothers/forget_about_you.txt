Wide awake, fall again
Scratchin at my wounds
Always in tune
Love came too soon

And in the morning, I saw the wave
Wasn't it something
And you say you don't need me
And you say you love the scene

Forget about you

Had a feelin it would come to this
Stitches always breaking
Every sound that you make
Keeps me awake

And in the morning, I saw the gaze
It wasn't a comfort
And you say you don't need me
And you say you want to breathe

Forget about you

Forget about all this life we have
We were the unseen
And I don't regret the days
Wasn't it something

Forget about you
