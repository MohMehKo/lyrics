I can reason it away
But I'll only miss the heart of it
Oh, the pain
It's all the same
So far

I can never live without you, now
You were the only one
Who could ever make the pieces fit the same
I could never live without you, now
You were the only one
Who could fix it when it hurts
Fix it when it hurts

All the secrets you betrayed
You were holding on despite of it
Oh, the shame
Foretold the weight
Of our fall

I can never live without you, now
You were the only one
Who could ever make the pieces fit the same
I could never live without you, now
You were the only one
Who could fix it when it hurts
Fix it when it hurts

Show me all the feelings that call your breakdown
Tell me all the reasons you cry
Show me all the demons that tore us open
Tore it, you tore it all
And you tore it, your tore it all
And you tore it, your tore it

I could never live without you, now
You were the only one
I can never live without you, now
You were the only one
Who could ever make the pieces fit the same
I could never live without you, now
You were the only one
Who could fix it when it hurts
Fix it when it hurts
Fix it when it hurts
