Tell me a story
Tell me the violence
And were there noises?
And were there sirens?
It'll be ok
And I'll make it right

'Cause I know what's coming
And I know why
Because tonight is far too
Perfect for your pain
Because the secrets
That you told
To me

I'll take your place when the world ends
And you take mine
I'll break us out of this
Jail and get you high
'Cause when it all ends,
I want you to be free
Free like you make me

What were the feelings
There in the silence?
And were you safe or
Was it defiance?
It'll be ok
And I'll make you smile

Cause I know what's coming
I saw the signs
Because yopur eyes in this
Moment can't contain
All of the secrets
That you told
To me

I'll take your place when the world ends
And you take mine
I'll break us out of this
Jail and get you high
'Cause when it all ends,
I want you to be free
Free like you make me

And I understand your way
Please darlin'
Don't you ever change
And I'm understanding
That you're the one for me

I'll take your place when the world ends
And you take mine
I'll break us out of this
Jail and get you high
'Cause when it all ends,
I want you to be free
Free like you make me
