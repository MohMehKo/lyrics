Sunrays lights your face
This place where the grass is growin
You know I’m with you
This is the morning, this is the wasted one
I had a feeling, now I am left with none
You are the calling, this is the wasted one
This is a boy that’s not afraid to run
This is a soul that’s not afraid to run

And this old map says
That love is where we’re going
But my tattered memories tell me
I should be goin now
This is the longing, this is the wasted one
I had a moment, now I am left with none
This is the warning, I am the wasted one
This is a boy that’s not afraid to run
This is a soul that’s not afraid to run

This is a course I can’t take
This is the reason why you’re not afraid
This is the force and the weight
We can justify a better way

This is a soul that’s not afraid to run
This is a soul that’s not afraid to run
This is a soul that’s not afraid to love
This is a soul that’s not afraid to run
