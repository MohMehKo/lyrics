If you were here
I could deceive you
And if you were here
You would believe

But would you suspect
My emotion wandering, yeah?
Do not want a part of this anymore

The rain water drips 
Through the cracks in the ceiling
And I'll have to spend
My time on repair
And just like the rain
I'll be always fallin', yeah
Only to rise and fall again
