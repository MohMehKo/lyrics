I turn the key situation is electrical
Take a breath with all my senses heightened in a slow salvation 
From a life pretending
You show me all the places that you wanna go
I come inside and never knew the feeling of a slow surrender
Mind is bending

Someday we will become one, find our own way
Someday will be forever
One day it could be so
You and I and nothing

The mirror tells a history I never won
But you don't mind, and all the weight is lifted with an understanding
You drop defenses 
My hands are shaking as I touch you for the first time
I've been waiting for this moment 
For this moment

Someday we will become one, find our own way
Someday will be forever
One day it could be so
You and I and nothing

We really gonna take the time? 
We really gonna fight to see it through?
I've suffered with the wait so long
This is the calling, this is the reason that I'm never gonna let you fall away
This is the motion, this is the meaning
And you know I'll never let you fall away
This is the moment, and I can feel it 
I've been looking for a love like this to save me
Suffered with the wait so long

Someday we will become one, find our own way
Someday will be forever
One day it could be so
You and I and nothing

Someday we will become one, find our own way
Someday will be forever
One day it could be so
You and I and nothing
You and I and nothing
