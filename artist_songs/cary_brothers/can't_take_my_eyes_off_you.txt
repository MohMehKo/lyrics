I've come to tell you all the truth
Though you always had the proof of it

My arms will grow
Chest expanding

Of all the boys you could have landed
Why'd it have to be me?

You...can't take my eyes off of you
You...can't take my eyes off of you

Wisdom tells me to turn away
Broken once, it's all the same

My arms will grow
Chest expanding

Of all the boys you could have landed
Why'd it have to be me?

You...can't take my eyes off of you
You...can't take my eyes off of you
