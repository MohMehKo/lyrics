I thought I was livin’ life in the right lane
but honest to a fault was not enough
I owe you an explanation
for how I got myself into this rut

scared the ceiling’s too low, can’t stand up and run
earthquake save me and bring this building to dust

baby can’t you see me fallin, fallin
going down despite your love
baby can’t you see me fallin, fallin
sold my soul and time is up

beat, broke, tired before you met me
suffered through the perils of my youth
he offered me a choice, couldn’t say no
now he’ll come collect upon the truth

my heart ain’t part of the deal, and love is the proof
so the only thing I have left, babe, I give to you

baby can’t you see me fallin, fallin
going down despite your love
baby can’t you see me fallin, fallin
sold my soul and time is up

I’ve come to ask you…
is this the way you want to go?
cut and run now?
or will you hold out?
I need the answer
can’t read the writing on the wall
is this the last call
of all I fought for?

baby can’t you see me fallin, fallin
going down despite your love
baby can’t you see me fallin, fallin
sold my soul and time is up
