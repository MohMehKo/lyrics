when I was young I believed in Santa Claus 
though I knew it was my dad 
and we laid out the stockings at christmas 
open my presents and I'd be glad 
then one day I was playin' father christmas 
I stood outside a department store 
a gang of kids came over and mugged me 
they knocked my reindeer to the floor 

they said 
father christmas, give us some money 
don't mess around with those silly toys
we'll beat you up if you dont hand them over 
we want some bread so dont make us annoyed 
give all the toys to the little rich boys 

don't give my brother a steve austin outfit 
don't give my sister a cuddly toy 
we dont want a jigsaw or monopoly money 
we only want the real mccoy 

father christmas, give us some money 
we'll beat you up if you make us annoyed 
father christmas, give us some money 
don't mess around with those silly toys 

but give my daddy a job cause he needs one 
he's got lots of mouths to feed 
but if you've have one, I'll take a machine gun 
so I can scare all the kids down the street 

father christmas, give us some money 
don't mess around with those silly toys 
we'll beat you up if you dont hand them over 
give all the toys to the little rich boys 

have yourself a merry merry christmas 
have yourself a good time 
don't forget all the kids who have nothin'
while you're drinkin' down your wine 

father christmas, give us some money 
don't mess around with those silly toys 
we'll beat you up if you dont hand them over 
we want your bread, so dont make us annoyed 
give all the toys to the little rich boys 

have yourself a merry merry christmas 
have yourself a good time
