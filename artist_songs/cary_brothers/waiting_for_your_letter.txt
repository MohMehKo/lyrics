I’m waiting for your letter
I’m waiting for it to drop
I’m waiting for it to fall
I’m waiting for it to pop

I’m waiting for your letter
I’m waiting for it to sing
I’m waiting for it to crawl
I’m waiting for it to bring me

So many answers
In so many ways
With a voice that’s understanding
Where the mornings last for days
The things I want to tell you
The beats that I could drop
With a voice that’s understanding
Time is ours to stop

I need you to justify
All of the darkest things
I need to know why
You left the best of me

I need an apology
I need it without the salt
I need it to fix me
I’m thinkin it’s all my fault

Show me the answers
And show me the ways
With a voice that’s understanding
Where the mornings last for days
The things I want to tell you
The beats that I could drop
With a voice that’s understanding
Time is ours to stop

I’m waiting for your letter
I’m waiting for it to drop
I’m waiting for your love
I’m waiting for it to stop
