Baby, 
we could be older
It could be someday
You could be wrapped up in my arms
And it’s so crazy
Everything’s moving
Faster than I want to
And you make me slow down

Because lovin’ on you was the best thing that I ever did for me
that I ever did for me
and we got love to see

Because lovin’ on you was the best thing that I ever did for me
that I ever did for me
and we got love to see

Shake it up
I got your number
And tell me a story
Tell me all the things that make you safe and sound
You know maybe
This is the first time
That you’ll be all mine
We were lost and found

Because lovin’ on you was the best thing that I ever did for me
that I ever did for me
and we got love to see

Because lovin’ on you was the best thing that I ever did for me
that I ever did for me
and we got love to see

We’ll fix a world that needs wonder
Falling under the stars
We’ll make it all that we wanted
Just tell me when we could stop
Just tell me when we could stop

Because lovin’ on you was the best thing that I ever did for me
that I ever did for me

Because lovin’ on you was the best thing that I ever did for me
that I ever did for me

love, love, love, love, love, love, love 

Because lovin’ on you was the best thing that I ever did for me
that I ever did for me
and we got love to see
