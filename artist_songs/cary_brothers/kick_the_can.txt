you faked plans
to make rights
choose your end
lose your lies

with a heavy heart
that wants to mend
with a thousand tries
you'll understand…
and kick the can

fools waste time
as moons chased light

with a heavy heart
you know what's next
with steady hands
in our defense
alibis in words you've penned
remember not the fortunes read…
just kick the can

you will turn into the fire and stand
you will realize you can't pretend

wouldn't you like to love
wouldn't you like to love
wouldn't you like to love
wouldn't you like to love

one more time into the fire again
