It's another day
And I suffocate
With no peace of mind
And the forecast tells of a summer storm

So I call you
Sound in circles
Will you come tonight?

You're gonna run away
You're gonna run away

Listen up
And I'll tell you why
'Cause the feeling won't quit
The memories sit
They're nothin' now

So I call you
Sound in circles
Will you come tonight?

You're gonna run away
You're gonna run away

How long?
Dear, how long?
Rushing for long, long time
Keeping it all alive
How long?
(How long?)
Dear, how long?
(How long?)
Waiting for one last day
But will you be gone away?

So I call you
Sound in circles
Will you come tonight?

You're gonna run away
You're gonna run away
You're gonna run away
You're gonna run away
