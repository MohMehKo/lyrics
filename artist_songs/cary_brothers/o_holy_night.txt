O holy night
The stars are brightly shining
The night of our dear saviour's birth

Long lay the world in sin and error pining
'Til he appeared and the soul felt its worth

The thrill of hope
The weary world rejoices
Yonder breaks a new and glorious morn

Fall on your knees
Oh, hear the angel voices
Oh, night divine
Oh, night the Christ was born

Oh, night divine
Oh, night, night divine

Fall on your knees
Oh, hear the angel voices
Oh, night divine
Oh, night the Christ was born

Oh, night divine
Oh, night, night divine

O holy night
The stars are brightly shining
