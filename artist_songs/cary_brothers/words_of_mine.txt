wish I had more time
to tell you of my life
wisdom, wars, and trials
oh, I tried to raise you right

wish I had more time
to say I was inspired
by the man you are inside
did I tell you I was proud?

remember the storms in the summertime?
you sat on my shoulders under the sky
these are the moments you'll find
when you reach for a lost goodbye

strong hands, love that would carry you
through broken hearts and spoken lies
I hope for the comfort you'll find
when you need these words of mine
need these words of mine

I was so tired
prayed with all my might
for a last look at your light
before I closed my eyes

remember the storms in the summertime?
you sat on my shoulders under the sky
these are the moments you'll find
when you reach for a lost goodbye

strong hands, love that would carry you
through broken hearts and spoken lies
I hope for the comfort you'll find
when you need these words of mine

need these words of mine
need these words of mine
need these words of mine
wish I had more time
