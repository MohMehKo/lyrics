winter returns
broken now and forever more
holidays don't mean so much without you
snow falls all around me
brings me hope anew
lovers holding hands
what can I hold onto

and I will be your christmas tree
I'll shine my light for you to see
if you need me
when you need me

lost this feelin'
who knows when I'll love again
emptiness has reeled in
all the memories of decembers gone

all these people talkin' to me about you
lovers holding hands
the gifts I hold onto

and I will be your christmas tree
I'll shine my light for you to see
when you need me
when you need me
