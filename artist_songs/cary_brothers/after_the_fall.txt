Come home, an absence of feeling
Slow down and mean what you say
What did you figure out, dear?
It's all whispering now

Shut your mouth
Your words they just fall to the floor
I hear it all come down
Take my life, take all of it
Talk to you after the fall
No regrets, just circumstance
Talk to you after the fall

Broke my back lifting your spirit
And now you give me no voice
You say I did nothing wrong here
How can you be so calm?

Shut your mouth
Your words they just tear me apart
I'll give you a head start
Take my life, take all of it
Talk to you after the fall
Shined your light, it's burning out
Talk to you after the fall

Everything changes, you say
Everything changes
Don't be a stranger, my sweet love
Everything's strange

Shut your mouth
Just let me see all that I had
Here for the last time
Take my life, take all of it
Talk to you after the fall
No regret, just circumstance
Talk to you after the fall
Talk to you after the fall
Just talk to me after the wall
