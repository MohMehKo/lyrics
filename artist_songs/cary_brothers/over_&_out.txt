I'll give you everything you wanted
That's what you said, your words of weight
And what's this temple that you started
Your blessings gained by our mistakes

Over and out
I gave my soul for you
Taking it back, I can't pay for faith with dues
Your house is a wreck, an open door for fools
New messiah, you can't save my soul

You're playing God, is it your ego?
Or just a way with others' pain?
That caring smile becoming see-through
I watch you fake and entertain
How dare you divide us with fear through grace?
What gives you the right to decide my fate?

Over and out
I gave my soul for you
Taking it back, I can't pay for faith with dues
Your house is a wreck, an open door for fools
New messiah, you can't save my soul

I'll pray for you as I walk away
I've claimed my soul
