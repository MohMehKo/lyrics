You are the loneliest girl in the world
Taking your hits as they come
You are the loneliest girl in the world
And tonight you'd fall for anyone

It's in the way you fall down to bed
It's in the way you cry when he's not looking

You are the loneliest girl in the world
I'll watch you die a thousand times again
You are the loneliest girl in the world
And I just want to make it go away
And I just want to make it go away
