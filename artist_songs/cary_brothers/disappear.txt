Follow your voice down the hallway
Feeling my way through the dark
Keeping eyes wide open
You will break my heart

I've got you for the night
Ghost or not
But you disappear in the light
When your shadow's caught
You disappear in the light
In the sunshine
In the sunshine

Settling shapes into focus
It's carrying all of the weight
I will reach out for you
It's always just too late

I've got you for the night
Ghost or not
But you disappear in the light
When your shadow's caught
You disappear in the light
In the sunshine
In the sunshine

For the leaving
For the taking
I forgive you, oh
For the last time
For believing
I release you from my heart

I've got you for the night
Ghost or not
But you disappear in the light
When your shadow's caught
You disappear in the light
In the sunshine
In the sunshine
In the sunshine
In the sunshine
In the sunshine
In the sunshine
In the sunshine
In the sunshine
