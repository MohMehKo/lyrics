I'm tired of hearin' everything you say
It's rolling off your tongue across my face
It seems the time to leave
It seems we tried

What's the use in talking?
I think I'm gonna go for a walk and think
Awhile
And think awhile

You know my love is real, it's not your game
An honest feather tickling at your fate
I told you I would leave
I even cried

Did you think that I was joking?
I think I'm gonna go for a smoke and think 
Awhile
And think awhile

Don't raise your voice to me
Cause you know you lost that right a long
Time ago

If I could make you believe
And trust me
What's the use in trusting?
I think I'm gonna catch the last bus and think
Awhile
And think awhile
And think awhile
And think awhile
