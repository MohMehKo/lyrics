I never thought I was wrong
I never thought I was scared
I always thought with my heart
But never thought I could care

What was it you said
About the sun always shining on me?
What was it you said?

I was supposed to, you were supposed to be
This is the part where you can come back to me
I was supposed to, you were supposed to be
It’s in the silence, it’s an attack

I walk the places alone
Where you and I took a dare
Where only lovers can turn
A circle into a square

What was it you said
About the sun always shining on me?
What was it you said?

I was supposed to, you were supposed to be
This is the part where you can come back to me
I was supposed to, you were supposed to be
This is the silence, it’s an attack

Come around
Sometimes everyone lies
Come around
Hold on ‘til you find it
Come around

I was supposed to, you were supposed to be
This is the part where you can come back to me
I was supposed to, you were supposed to be
I was supposed to, you were supposed to be
