I think I said all I can say
Using up all my potions and spells tonight
You will find out when you pull through
That I fought too
So take your time close your eyes
I will be there here with you
They may be right I may be foolish
But I will wait for you
Skin is so pale I see through
Bones are like glass they won't let me touch you
Pray to the sky I wanna see a proof
Why'd he choose you
So take your time the odds are high

But I believe in you
They may be right I may be foolish
There maybe some design
But I will wait for you
I am here to fight
For only love decides
I am here to fight
For only love decides
I am here to fight
For only love decides
In the morning light
I will wake to find you
Opening your eyes.
