Apologies for the things I’ve said
Sometimes I don’t think before I speak but who does?
Especially when you’ve got a lot on your mind
I’m short-tempered so just bare with me
Just bare with me and let me speak
I’m punching holes in these walls
My eyes are open I can’t even see, my eyes are open
I’ve had too many tonight but buy some rounds
Pass them around, get on my level, its only 11 and you’re far behind!
I’ve had too many tonight but buy some rounds
Pass them around, get on my level, its only 11 and shits getting heavy
Who fucking spilled the beer on my carpet!?
Alright everybody throw your hands up
Put em in the air and if you’re not holding a red cup
You know the drill- get on your knees
I’m sorry, I’m sorry I can’t control my anger any more

But you must understand
I’ve been away for a long long time
No one can save me cuz I’m too far gone
Oh baby baby, you should have seen the things I’ve done
God Damn, all those nights, all those blunts, all those lights
I wouldn’t trade it for the world, or anything in it
I looked rough, but I’ll admit it- yeah the girls came too
They fucked me good but girl, I swear they don’t compare to you
Oh shit
I think I said too much
Oh shit
I THINK I SAID TOO MUCH
And every day is like a never-ending struggle where I’m always fuckin falling behind
And every second is a motherfucking obstacle where everybody’s falling behind
Fall behind

I’ve had too many tonight but buy some rounds
Somebody buy some fucking rounds!
Who fucking spilled the beer!?
