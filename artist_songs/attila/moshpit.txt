Take it from the best, everything I do pops
Fake ass bitches all around me just stop
I could call you out, but your shit already flopped
I don't give a fuck, I'm already at the top.

Take another minute and relive it, can you see the vision better than you ever really thought
Nah
Been up in the game and I was born and raised inside it, you can find me in the motherfucking pit
Yeah
If you wanna battle, know you're dealing with a god and I hope you prepared your case
Woo
I don't fuck around when it comes to the music, you can never really touch my pace

You're coming to me just to question my roots
But you could never walk a day in my shoes
Been in the game for twelve years, what it do?
Fuck that shit, you can find me in the moshpit.

You're coming to me just to question my roots

Are you ready, motherfuckers? Let's go!
Uh

Take another minute to relive it and admit it that your boy is going at it at a supersonic pace
I can turn a track into a bomb, light it up, take a grip, then I throw it in your face
Oh
Pussy bred motherfuckers dunno what to do when all I do is hit them with the fucking truth
Yeah
I'm a fucking stunner, I'm a grade A runner and I paved my way in the mosh pit

You're coming to me just to question my roots
But you could never walk a day in my shoes
Been in the game for twelve years, what it do?
Fuck that shit, you can find me in the moshpit.

Start a fucking moshpit!

You're coming to me just to question my roots
But you could never walk a day in my shoes
Been in the game for twelve years, what it do?
Fuck that shit, you can find me in the moshpit.

Fake ass posers all around me, they don't know shit
Back off bitch, I'm the king of the moshpit
Say you love the music, but you never show your face, bitch
Fuck that shit, you can find me in the moshpit.
