Folding under all the pressure, I will never change

Say it, everything that's in your head I know you
Need me I'm the reason that you can't sleep
I am the product of your filthy mind
Bow down and realize that you are mine

Holding on to these words like a lifeline
Always finding offense, but that's fine
Iâ€™m the demon that lives in your mind
Take a deep breath inside

It's gonna take more than bullets to stop me
Your words are the least of my concern

Say it, everything that's in your head I know you
Need me I'm the reason that you can't sleep
I am the product of your filthy mind
Bow down and realize that you are mine
Say it, everything that's in your head I know you
Need me I'm the reason that you can't sleep
I am the product of your filthy mind
Bow down and realize that you are mine

You only hate me cause I want you to
Addicted to the shit I put you through
You only love me cause you need the thrill
I am the problem but I'm also the pill

I was born in the pit that you call hell

I'm the demon that lives in your mind
I'm the demon that lives in your mind
I'm the demon that lives in your mind
I'm the demon that lives in your mind

Say it, everything that's in your head I know you
Need me I'm the reason that you can't sleep
I am the product of your filthy mind
Bow down and realize that you are mine
Say it, everything that's in your head I know you
Need me I'm the reason that you can't sleep
I am the product of your filthy mind
Bow down and realize that you are mine
