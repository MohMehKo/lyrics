Check, check. Mic check 1, 2
It's about that time
This the year we take shit off the internet
And settle it in the streets motherfucker
Jump

Turn it up and ignite the track
Light it up and pop a bottle cause your boys are back
I got one fucking goal by the end of the show
Make this whole place jump, sing along to the flow
What, what motherfucker did you think I was done
I see you hating for a living, I just rap for fun
There's a million fucking bands and they're all the same
I put my middle fingers up screaming "Fuck the fame"
I'm like

Hey, hey
Don't give a damn what people say
Hey, hey
Save it for another day
Hey, hey
You gonna talk the talk then walk this way
Hey, hey
Or save it for another day

Oooh shit
Only Satan can fucking judge me, you bitch
Fucking get it right or just live with it
You wanna judge but no one asked for opinions
I'm living life, you're existing

Aw shit, wake up motherfuckers
You're either with us or you're against us
You better choose your side
So get it right now
It's time to cut the talking
Take another minute
And admit it that you're with it
When you're lying for a living
You're denying your own limits

Hell fucking yeah

Take it back and ignite the track
I've got a heart of gold but my soul is black
Ever since I made a deal with the motherfuckin' devil
I traded in my weak shit and skipped the levels
If you came to party then this the place
If you came to hate, you better say it to my face
Fuck the drama and fuck the bullshit
Ignite the party cause this the fire shit

Hey, hey
Don't give a damn what people say
Hey, hey
Save it for another day
Hey, hey
You gonna talk the talk then walk this way
Hey, hey
Or save it for another day
Hey, hey
Don't give a damn what people say
Hey, hey
Save it for another day
Hey, hey
You gonna talk the talk then walk this way
Hey, hey
Or save it for another day

It's time to ignite the party
Let's take a moment to ignite the party
