I want every single one of you to know that I am truly sorry from the bottom of my heart.
I am so sorry, sorry that you're a little bitch

You want apologies, well fuck you
None of you motherfuckers will know what I've been through
Been broke my whole life and locked in jail cell
All of y'all can go to hell
In debt, washing dishes in a hot kitchen
No light ahead, just bad news and dark visions
You wanna talk like you know me
You wanna talk more shit like you motherfuckin' know me

Here we go, here we go, here we go
Now listen up

Fuck your shit, I stay sick
If you don't like it, you could suck this dick
I say cunt, I say bitch
You motherfuckers get offended by anything
Fuck your shit, I stay sick
If you don't like it, you could suck this dick
I say cunt, I say bitch
You motherfuckers get offended by anything
So go ahead and get offended by this

Take it or leave it, I think you probably need it
I see you bitchin' for a living, I'm just glad I offended you
I'm here to stay, I ain't going away
You can yell and complain but I'ma stay the same, what

Are you done, are you done
Are you fucking done

Fuck your shit, I stay sick
If you don't like it, you could suck this dick
I say cunt, I say bitch
You motherfuckers get offended by anything
Fuck your shit, I stay sick
If you don't like it, you could suck this dick
I say cunt, I say bitch
You motherfuckers get offended by anything

Your finger's on the trigger
But my hand's around your neck
So easily insulted
I live under your skin

Uh, let me tell you some
Turn me up, uh here we go

I went on tour without a penny in my pocket
Dreams of making music was the only thing I rocked with
You wanna judge like I'm on the stand, well
Come and say it to my face and you can catch these hands

Fuck your shit, I stay sick
If you don't like it, you could suck this dick
I say cunt, I say bitch
You motherfuckers get offended by anything
Fuck your shit, I stay sick
If you don't like it, you could suck this dick
I say cunt, I say bitch
You motherfuckers get offended by anything

Your finger's on the trigger
But my hand's around your neck
So easily insulted
I live under your skin

Ha-ha-ha, oh yeah
I am so sorry, sike
