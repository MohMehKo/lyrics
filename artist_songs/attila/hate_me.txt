I don't give a fuck about my bad reputation

Never catch me slipping, red cup solo sipping out the whip with yo bitches
Don't give a fuck about opinions, that don't pay the bills
I'm just keeping it real
When you're out on the town I hope you're thinking of me
Sipping liquor out the bottle and smoking up on that tree
The moral of the story is I just want you to see
That the opinions of others should never bother you or me

Get fucked, you wonder why nobody likes you but you hate on everything and have a negative outlook
Fuck that, I'm the product of your creation all your hate and negativity made me stronger
Hell yeah, nobody does it like we do it, having this much fun should be illegal whoa,
we're taking over this bitch, join or die up in this bitch, straight villain till the death of me

[2x]
HATE ME
Keep my name in your mouth
I’ll keep my dick in your mother while you’re starin at each other
HATE ME
You keep on payin my bills
I’m living just for the thrills
You keep on poppin’ your pills

You'll never understand
That all your negativity won't get you shit
You're so blind and stupid
Just keep on doing you and I won't give a fuck

hell, yeah

Never catch me slipping, red cup solo sipping out the whip with yo bitches
Don't give a fuck about opinions, that don't pay the bills
I'm just keeping it real
When you're out on the town I hope you're thinking of me
Sipping liquor out the bottle and smoking up on that tree
The moral of the story is I just want you to see
That the opinions of others should never bother you or me
