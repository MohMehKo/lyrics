Get up

You all know I'm a badass
I don't really care about your opinions of me
Born without these emotions
I just live inside the world, nothing's given to me
I just came to kick ass and take names
And if you want a piece then come and show your face

Say what you want but nothing can stop me now
Contradict to know what I want
Take a shot and I'll bounce this off
I'm in control so nothing can hold me down
All we get is hell but it works
Too strong to give into words
Too bad I'm bulletproof

You already know I don't really care about opinions of me
And if you have to ask, nothing in this world was ever given to me
I just came to kick ass and take names
And if you want a piece then come and show your face

Say what you want but nothing can stop me now
Contradict to know what I want
Take a shot and I'll bounce this off
I'm in control so nothing can hold me down
All we get is hell but it works
Too strong to give into words
You know I'm bulletproof

How does it feel
I am a human target
But I live for this
And I've only just started
You wanted something from me
But I have nothing to give
And if you feel like you're forgotten
Here's your chance to take it back

Say what you want but nothing can stop me now
Contradict to know what I want
Take a shot and I'll bounce this off
I'm in control so nothing can hold me down
All we get is hell but it works
Too strong to give into words
Say what you want but nothing can stop me now
Contradict to know what I want
Take a shot and I'll bounce this off
I'm in control so nothing can hold me down
All we get is hell but it works
Too strong to give into words
You know I'm bulletproof
