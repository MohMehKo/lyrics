This is for my people working hard all day
Stuck inside the system where you slave away
Skipping school just to chase the dream
Working dead end jobs just to make ends meet
I'll tell you something they don't teach in school
Fuck the guidelines and focus on you
We're saying fuck the system and fuck the rules
Fuck the politicians and fuck you too

We put our lives on the line

This is how we do it, this is how we roll
Let's forget the world when we lose control
This is how we do it, this is how we roll
Let's forget the world when we lose control

Fuck the news stations on TV
Fuck the lies that they're feeding to me
We know better than to just give in
Propaganda can't spread me thin
Divide and conquer is their main agenda
They'll step in until we surrender
Don't you see what's going on
Open your eyes as we stand strong

We put our lives on the line

This is how we do it, this is how we roll
Let's forget the world when we lose control
This is how we do it, this is how we roll
Let's forget the world, take me home

Fuck all this minimum wage shit
I won't let this system consume me
Stuck in an endless cycle
You gonna fucking sue me

Fuck all this minimum wage shit
I won't let this system consume me
And if you're sick of it just like me
Come and fuck this shit up

Rise, clench your fists
We put our lives on the line

This is how we do it, this is how we roll
Let's forget the world when we lose control
This is how we do it, this is how we roll
Let's forget the world when we lose control
This is how we do it, this is how we roll
Let's forget the world when we lose control
This is how we do it, this is how we roll
Let's forget the world when we lose control
