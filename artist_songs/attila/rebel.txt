Let's take it back and reminisce on the days you doubted on me
I looked straight back into your eyes and I said
FUCK YOU
You wanted control over my life and all the decisions I made
I did whatever the fuck I wanted do you see where I am at

No one controls your life
You do shit on your own
If you've got ambitions then you're better off alone
Acquaintances don't matter, teachers don't fucking matter, no one's opinions matter, FUCK YOU

Your fucking better off alone

Your better off alone

Oh this is the time where wrongs become right
You've got to stand up for yourself and fight
You'll never know if it works so just try!

You're gonna change your mind
But you can't change my life
I wasn't born and raised a bitch
But you were born to suck my dick

Hey
Disobey
Violate
Disregard the rules
Hey
Let's escape
Run away
Fuck your church and school

Hey
Disobey
Violate
Disregard the rules
Hey
Let's escape
Run away
Fuck your church and school

Fuck The System!
