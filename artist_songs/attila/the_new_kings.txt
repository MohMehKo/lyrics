Take a look at who's standing before you
How does it feel to know you shunned us from the start?
When we were begging for a chance to try
You shook your head and acted like it was a joke
Now what?
You've got your hand out to give an offer that we can't refuse
Well you must not know me well
Eat shit, you're a hypocrite and I don't forget the past bitch
You must be a brain dead fool
Yeah, don't forget your past
Everyone can see through you, fame will never last
So let the new kings take the throne

Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got love for us but what about last year?
I remember what you said behind our back
And you swore to your god that we wouldn't do shit [x2]

We are the new kings [x2]

Just fucking go, look in the eyes of a king.
Hold that thought let me explain
You're a double crossing liar caught up in crossfire
Started up a fucking fire and I threw it right back
Suck it.
You will never be forgiven not as long as I'm here living
And I'm never going to forget just how you treated us like shit right
Right when we needed help the most

Yeah, don't forget your past
Everyone can see through you, fame will never last
So let the new kings take the throne

You changed your fucking mind? Oh Yeah? Well I don't forget

Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got love for us but what about last year?
I remember what you said behind our back
And you swore to your god that we wouldn't do shit [x2]

It's always like this
When people try to change their mind as if you would forget
Well I don't forget
I remember every time you put us down and all the fucking reasons why you said
We wouldn't go anywhere
I don't forget
I remember all the shit you talked behind our back and all the lies your spread
Among the people that you call your friends
I don't forget
