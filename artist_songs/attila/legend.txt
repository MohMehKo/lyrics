Expensive liquor, forget that
Cheap beer and a bong in my backpack
Cover charges, hell no
Everyone's allowed in the motherfucking house show
Keg stands, hell yeah
Then line it up like the kids at a state fair
You wanted chaos, well here you go
Let's rage so hard that the whole world knows

Let's turn it up tonight
They're passed out on the floor
They thought they had me beat but look at the score

You think you, you think you, think you could take me on
Step up, step up to the plate now
I am, I am a legend in the making
This is my destiny

You wanna sing along and get high
Crowdsurf to the front and come and take this mic
Did you chug a beer I hope so
If you want a challenge, let's go toe to toe
You want to break shit, I don't know
This isn't my house so anything goes
Oh yeah, hell yeah
Taking it over the top
When will the cops show up

Come on, let me hear you

You think you, you think you, think you could take me on
Step up, step up to the plate now
I am, I am a legend in the making
This is my destiny

Woah, yeah

You think you, you think you, think you could take me on
Step up, step up to the plate now

You think you, you think you, think you could take me on
Step up, step up to the plate now
I am, I am a legend in the making
This is my destiny
You think you, you think you, think you could take me on
Step up, step up to the plate now
I am, I am a legend in the making
This is my destiny
