This is our time, reignite
All of the flames that have died for quite some time
We can't let the music die like this
Time to kick it up a notch, do you feel me

Pick it up, this is a lifestyle, no, it's not a fad
We fucking live for the music
Rise up or just get fucked, uh, you know it
We ain't playing around, nah
Pick it up, this is a lifestyle yeah, we live this
Ride or die for the music
Rise up or just get fucked, uh get with it
Or get out of the way

All hail rock and roll
Gotta take it back, we gotta take control
All hail rock and roll
Write this on my tombstone
All hail rock and roll
Gotta take it back, we gotta take control
All hail rock and roll
Write this on my tombstone

Pick it up, this is a lifestyle, no, it's perfect
We fucking live for the music
Rise up or just get fucked, uh, you know it
We ain't playing around

Oh shit!

All hail rock and roll
Gotta take it back, we gotta take control
All hail rock and roll
Write this on my tombstone
All hail rock and roll
Gotta take it back, we gotta take control
All hail rock and roll
Write this on my tombstone

Take me back to the way things used to be
Breaking rules, smashing shit, and we'll be free
They try to regulate the music we create
But I'm as free as the they come if you don't like it you're a bitch

Oh yeah

Cut me open cause I bleed rock and roll
Let me pour you a glass and you can join the cult
