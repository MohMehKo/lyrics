Go!
What! What!
Oh yeah!
Let's go!

Bad bitch stunna always down to ride
She's the first one taking shots tonight
Always getting into trouble, screaming "fuck the law"
She in the front row, titties out, throw up your bra, uh
Getting hammered she can out drink anyone
Other bitches know what's up but her, she's a home run
Running through the city with a forty and a fifty
If you want it come and get a piece
Bitches throw your hands up

Get back, she's a bad motherfucker
Talk back, she'll put you in your place
Turn back, if you know what's good for you
Don't snap, it's a part of the chase
[x2]

Oh snap
She's coming up in for the kill I can tell she wanna rack that
Been sending out crazy texts and blowing up my snapchat
The type that always wanna know where all fun's at
And I'm like, "don't stop, get it get it"

Back that
I hear you talking like it's nothing but some chitchat
But I know better than to give in to the riff raff
If you're about it break me off a piece like Kit Kat
If you're ready, come and get it

Get back, she's a bad motherfucker
Talk back, she'll put you in your place
Turn back, if you know what's good for you
Don't snap, it's a part of the chase
[x2]

Fuck the standards of society
All these rules are giving me anxiety
You do you and fuck what they say
If you're a boss bitch, let's show it today
And if they throwing shade you can tell 'em where to put it

What!

Get back, she's a bad motherfucker
Talk back, she'll put you in your place
Turn back, if you know what's good for you
Don't snap, it's a part of the chase
