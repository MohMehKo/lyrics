Supernatural thoughts in my head
Confusing, intense, like I'm stuck in limbo,
instead I'm living ahead
It's unexplainable, I'm irrational
Without being a son of a bitch
But I'm on another dimension again
Do you see the bright light above?

You weren't supposed to be here you know this
But who am I to judge?
In the end we're all just foreign beings
Addicted to the touch

I didn't want to like you
But now I'm falling in love
The type of love you give me
It's feeling like the drugs

Let's get abducted
Let's get abducted
Let's get abducted

Extraterrestrial life, as our life was taken
It's not, that we'd seem to run away and hide
They just want to rage hard
It's unexplainable, I'm irrational
Without being a son of a bitch
But I'm on another dimension again
Do you see the bright light above?

Pass the bottle, pass the blunt
Press repeat now we're all losing touch
Unexpected, unexplored
Go with the flow because I'm getting bored

I didn't want to like you
But now I'm falling in love
The type of love you give me
It's feeling like the drugs

Let's get abducted
Let's get abducted
Let's get abducted

I didn't want to like you
But now I'm falling in love
The type of love you give me
It's feeling like the drugs

Pass the bottle, pass the blunt
Press repeat now we're all losing touch
Unexpected, unexplored
Go with the flow because I'm getting bored
Pass the bottle, pass the blunt
Go with the flow

Let's get abducted
Let's get abducted
Let's get abducted

Put me in your spaceship and take me somewhere new
Get me out of here
Riding something new
