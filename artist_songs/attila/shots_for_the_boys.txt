Here we go now, pour the shots out
Everyone is getting hammered and the tab's on me
We're going hard 'cause we run this shit
So stay the fuck at home if you party like a bitch
(If you party like a bitch)

Take another and drink it all down
We can have ten more 'cause we run this town
We keep it rowdy as fuck
Take three, more shots for good luck

Shots for the boys!
Bottoms up

Shot of tequila, one after another for all of my homies and all of your brothers
Shut up and don't bother me
Just take another, we party all night
And we're not like the others

(Well shit)

Shots for the boys!

Here we go now, pour the shots out
Everyone is getting hammered and the tab's on me
We're going hard 'cause we run this shit
So stay the fuck at home if you party like a bitch

Take another and drink it all down
We can have ten more 'cause we run this town
We keep it rowdy as fuck
Take three, more shots for good luck

I only drink in celebration
And every night is a celebration
You don't like to take straight shots?
Shut the fuck up, we only take straight shots
One more shot!
It's getting late, so get it in before last call
One more shot!
If you don't take it, then you're just a fucking asshole
Tomorrow morning is gonna be rough, but last night was the shit
So suck on my dick
