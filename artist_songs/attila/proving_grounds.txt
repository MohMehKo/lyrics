Take your opinion and stick it right up in your motherfuckin ass!

Set the stage we’re in a world where opinions mean nothing, 
you’ve got to prove your worth

Let me hear you say 
HEY
Fuck everything they 
SAY
I’ll live another 
DAY
And if they doubt you, 
tell ‘em to suck it and hold it down on the proving grounds
HEY
Fuck everything they 
SAY
I’ll live another 
DAY
And if they doubt you,
tell ‘em to suck it and hold it down on the proving grounds

I’ve always done what I wanted, 
I never had a reason 
I just set out with 
middle fingers up fuck everything and anyone who tried to stop me
There’s one thing you should know- 
To never give a fuck. 
When people try to stop you, 
you should prove 
them 
wrong.

Let me see what you’re made of, 
you little piece of shit
THIS IS THE PROVING GROUNDS
Bring it on let me see it
SO WHO’S THE FAGGOT NOW
We have to prove them wrong
THIS IS THE PROVING GROUNDS
SO WHO’S THE FAGGOT NOW

Let me hear you say 
HEY
Fuck everything they 
SAY

DAY
And if they doubt you, 
tell ‘em to suck it and hold it down on the proving grounds

You gotta problem with me keepin it real,

Fuck your shit
Always gotta have opinions you can suck my dick
Always gotta have the last word such a little shit
Always gotta try to hide it but I fucked your bitch
Doesn’t matter what the press says I won’t quit
Doesn’t matter what the feds say smoke my shit
When I’m rollin pass the 5-0 I stay lit
If you feel like you’re a victim...
RAPE THIS PIT
Take a hit of this SHIT
Let the moment set in always open ears and listen
Everybody 
CAN SUCK MY FUCK
Doesn’t matter what you think I’m here to prove you wrong 
hit the back button repeat this song
