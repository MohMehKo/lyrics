You want to be the king
You want to live free
This is your wake up call
Get it together, let's go

Why do I have to scream
I said this a million times before
Why would you put your life on hold
You have a dream
A dream to take shit over domination
Let me hear you say it
You want to be the fucking king
This shit will not come easy
If you want it you will fight for it
If you want it you'll fight for it

Take a chance and don't think twice
Life's a gamble, roll the dice
Grab the wheel and don't look back
Every day could be your last

Get your shit straight

I am your god, listen to me
When I tell you jump, jump with me, get off your feet
I've been through it, take it from me
When I tell you jump, jump with me, get off your feet

Take a chance and don't think twice
Life's a gamble, roll the dice
Grab the wheel and don't look back
Every day could be your last

Take a chance and don't think twice
Life's a gamble, roll the dice
Grab the wheel and don't look back
Every day could be your last

Take a chance and don't think twice
Life's a gamble, roll the dice

You want to be the king
This will not come easy
You have to fight for it
You'll put your life on hold

Take a chance and don't think twice
Life's a gamble, roll the dice
Grab the wheel and don't look back
Every day could be your last
