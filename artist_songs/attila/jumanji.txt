We're going away
Crazy adventures await, day after day
I don't remember her name
Oh what a shame it is, oh what a shame

[x2:]
Shake your ass girl, break it down and drop it low
It's a photo-shoot with me and my camera phone
I can keep it on the low if you want me to
But secrets are no fun

Get up, we've got a 6 hour drive
But drivings overrated, drivings overrated
Take a hit of this and we'll fly
Fly above the highest of highs
No one can stop divine progression
Let the haters hate as they'd like
This is not an option, get out

This is not an option, get out
This is not an option, get out
This is not an option, get out

This is not an option, get out
This is not an option, get out

[x2:]
Shake your ass girl, break it down and drop it low
It's a photo-shoot with me and my camera phone
I can keep it on the low if you want me to
But secrets are no fun

We're going away
Crazy adventures await, day after day
I don't remember her name
Oh what a shame it is, oh what a shame

What a shame

Shut the fuck up

This is not the time or place to start this war
This is not the time or place to start this war
This is not the time or place to start this war

Start this war!
