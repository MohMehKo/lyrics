They've been after me but I could care less while I'm sipping moonshine yeah.
Here's the part where I tell it like it is. time isn't wasted when you're wasted.
Popping bottles like its our last night. whose with me?
Can you keep up with me? I don't think so.
Yeah I'll go blind before I look you in the eyes fucking traitor.
Ga so pretend that for a second you'll be fine.
But I'm not sober hahahah you will pay the price.
You never sacrifice much. take my advice. liar.
They watch my life between the cracks. they never even mind.
I'm high anyways. so eat your heart out. well take the back roads to get home.
(they watch my life between the cracks) they never even mind.
I'm high anyways so eat your fucking heart out. I stay wasted all the time.
Sipping white lightning past your eyes. can you keep up with me?
Can you k-k-k-k-k-k-keep up with me? you will never learn my fucking ways.
I'm never gonna come back here. so they can deploy a hundred person army search party.
Sober anonymous viewers watch in horror but I'm gonna be not giving a fuck just like I said earlier.
I'm gonna be sipping on white lightning
