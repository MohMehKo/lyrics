Give in to your temptations, stop worrying about whats wrong or right
Pick up the conversation from the last point that we left off
You always have your way with me
Pick up the conversation from the last point that we left off
You always have your way with my mind, seducing thoughts control me all of the time
All of these thoughts are combining and I’m contemplating my next big move
What will you do if these feelings persist? Give in, this urge you cannot resist
All of these thoughts are combining and I’m contemplating my next big move
What will you do if these feelings persist? Give in, this urge you cannot resist
Look at me now. Sit in with me as I have a chit-chat with the devil upon my shoulder
Who thought it ever would come to this
Everyone’s got a secret to tell, so tell me something dirty
Tell me something that I’m gonna like

We’re losing time- so are you
Don’t let useless emotions inflict you in your daily life
I’ve got a feeling that there’s more where that came from
And I’m hoping I can get some more of you
Breathe all you’ve got into my soul, I want it all or nothing at all

Don’t hold back, accept this invitation
I don’t need any words or explanation
Me and you possess a love that could break the mold
When we’re together we can overcome the world
So please accept this invitation
I don’t need any words or explanation
Me and you possess a love that could break the mold
When we’re together we can overcome the world
Bounce
Is anybody even listening?
No
