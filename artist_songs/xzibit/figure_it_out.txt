[Chorus: Xzibit & Young De]
Wait Now Let Me Guess I See How This Go You Know Knuckle Up Just Pull Your Pistol You Can't Fuck With Us I Launch A Missle You Know From This Close I Can't Miss So
I Couldt Care On What Your Sayin' I'm On To Ya Mudafuckaz Thinkin' I'm Playin' I'm Playin' Til The 45 Starts The Sprayin'
You Niggaz Explain It I Thought You Was Bangin' Let's Figure It Out

[Verse 1: Young De]
I Couldt Care On What Your Sayin' I'm On To Ya Mudafuckaz Thinkin' I'm Playin' I'm Playin' Til The 45 Starts The Sprayin'
You Niggaz Explain It I Thought You Was Bangin' Let's Figure It Out Is You A GANGSTA RIDA HUSTLA Which One Of You
Or What You Gon Do When It Go Down Pop Off Go Hard Come Soft Then You Git Pumped Like A Chump In The Lunch hall
Unregistered Heat That's A Gun Charge Two Place One Gun Dats A Menarge And We Can See Through The Physage
And The Most Press You Ever Had On Your Bad Was A Massage It's All Fun And Games Til Somebody Gets Got
And People Start To Argue When Somebody Get Shot Police Investigate And What If You Git Caught And You Sentenced To A Maxium State Prison
I'm Just A Hard Headed Nigga Dat Can't Listen My Motto Is If It Ain't Broke Don't Fix It My Mood Will Fend Will Gain Interest
If You Start Trippin' I'm a Pull Dat 4 Fifth And Ride

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Young De]
But This Shit Ain't A Mad Problem When You Have Beef With Niggaz With Mad Straps On Em So Track The Heat He Gon Follow It Too
Before A Bullets Comes And Divides You From Your Crew So As Long As I'm a Alive I'm Live I'm a Be Me And I'm Not A Shook One Like Dat Mobb Deep Single
A Black Polo Hoodie And A Peacoat Meant Wut I Meant When I Said I Keep The Heat Close There's Way Too Many Fake Ass Ninos Browns Runnin' Around
That's Down To Dey Last Sino It's Cali Baby Catch A Fade Without The Barbershop Get You And Your Pride Out Leaving On The Sidewalk The Cop Still
Use The Same Old White Chalk And Paul Berrington Still Carring The Pawn Box And Ain't Watching For They When They Say You Better Watch Hit You
In The Back Now You Can't Talk

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Mykestro]
Mist Came With May Weather NOw The Weather Better Since I Put Tips On the Mudafucka So I Save Her The Itch Shes Flaming With Her Flaming In Her Fist
With Dat Internet Coreagment Shit No Such Thing As Part Time Bangin' Where I'm From Ain't No Can No Occasional Cribs Trip when You Facing The Perinment Vacation In Ya Crib
So Pay For Them Fagots When They Stare For Those Who Would Rather Be Caught With It Than Without It But Sorry I'm Rather With It And Around It People Will Flock It
When Dey Hectic The Hectoriing Constant Cops Come Out The Shit Come Ragin' When It's Out Pull The BUllshit With The Peer Pressure Whether It Stays Important Or Shall I Undress
The Glock Look Shoot First Ask Questions Last The KK Struggling For The Vast

[Chorus]
