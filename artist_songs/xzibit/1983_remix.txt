I had to write this in blood because the ink wouldn't stick
I sold 5 or 6 million but yo that ain't really shit
It was supposed to be different we were supposed to ride out
But too much shot his girl then shot himself in the mouth
Then the steady gang formed but very soon fell apart
'Cause when you just doin' art with no loyalty in the heart
It's like catching Alzheimer's all these niggas forgetting where they coming from
Had to slow it down wait a minute what we running from
This what we supposed to do here's what we supposed to be
I hated MTV for tryin' to play me like a mockery
But that don't bother me I just fulfilled my fucking contract
Small price to pay just to get your piece of your mind back
Mind back, Backfire, assassination of my character
Just to make some millions off America
My younger sister Erica just adopted a child
My older brother served 15 he made it out
Even though my father loved me I ain't seen him in a while
Had to fight my baby mama bitch give me my nigga now
'Cause he's running out of time and I need him to understand
The way of the superior man I built a brand
Niggas talk about my taxes I done paid uncle Sam
I'm surviving 'cause the minds eyes quicker than the hand

Heartbreak, disappointment, my mother died when I was 9 I just wanted to join her
Nah Mister Joiner you get to California
I got something for you to do it's like I was anointed
Resurrected, foud my purpose I remember meeting Dre
Being nervous when I would kick my verses
I was virtually worthless, my whole life was a circus
I was sleeping with serpents and I thought they was worth it
I got a call from Paul told me shit wasn't working
Exchanged words I told him tell me that shit in person
He probably told EM (eminem) and by the way that he said it
Unapologetic, twisted made it about him
I seen Slim and he said he didn't recognize me
Was it that or did he let another man define me
I don't know but now I gotta get this all behind me
Follow my calling when I used to follow niggas blindly

I wish I had a better relationship with my uncles
Blood relatives I could turn to when I'm feeling trouble
Talk about my struggles, my uncle John Nail
He only put me on the phone with different females
Yeah this is such a such nephew tell her what's up
Ain't even ask about Tremayne and Gatlyn growing up
Fuck, I drink it all and I smashed a bottle
Self medicated, numb, but I'm a feel it tomorrow
It felt like pain and sorrow was like a second skin
But now the pain is gone I got my second wind
Only the strong live long you better settle in
I'm fighting forever I will never let the devil win
1983 that's when my journey begins
I searched everywhere for strength and only found it within
This for me and my kin still dying to live
Living life to the fullest till I see you again
