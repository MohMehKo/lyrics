[Intro: x8]
Better watch them niggaz where they at, where they at

[Xzibit:]
What you know about that rag top 4,
3 wheel through the intersection slow,
Then punchin to the floor,
You know my flow go like a simon blow,
Er body gotta pay co ser body owe,
Oh oh no, who that nigga think he is,
I'm just a representative of my relative,
Guns up hoes down,
Easily put you where you can't be found,
Cause I'm a rider, plus a provider who don't take notta,
Niggaz stickin out they chest cause they think they harder,
But when it get toe off, gang a niggaz screamin and cryin,
And dying cause they thought we was lying,
But no nigga I'm not,
Bet not fuck with strong arm steady cause you will be shot,
This is the land of the keys, the home of the gang,
Now sit yo five dollar ass down for I maintain,

[Chorus: x2]
Calm down lil nigga I ain't tryna provoke you,
Jus a lil sumat you can ride and smoke to,
I hate to have the homies have to ride and smoke you,
I hate to have the homies have to ride and smoke you

[The Game:]
Now a gangsta homie you a wanksta fonie,
I make it rain in cali fuck tony tony tony,
You got guns come to Compton and show me,
I sandwich niggaz this beef shit is baloney homie,
I take ya bitch make her come ride my pony,
That's Ginuwine, I give a fuck if she fat or boney,
Long as she cat walk like Naomi,
Or freak like missy, I take her to miss sixty,
She a Cincinnati red like Ken Griffey,
Freckles on her face, so I put a bezel on her,
Jake I wifed her, and I don't mean a weddin,
I mean a free pair of g-unit sneakers now she a video extra,
Compton on my back I'm startin to feel the pressure,
My son see me walkin in the house with a smith & Wesson,
I teach him a lesson,
Son this a black vest and you need this, when you gangbangin in the west,
Lil man I love you, they can't stop your pops,
They can't yell g-unit they can't rock the watch,
They can't sign with Dr Dre and come back to the block,
Homie you ain't a gangsta stop frontin bitch,
Before I pull that 45 and blaze ya six
I might catch me in O-town with that mason bitch

[Chorus: x2]
Calm down lil nigga I ain't tryna provoke you,
Jus a lil sumat you can ride and smoke to,
I hate to have the homies have to ride and smoke you,
I hate to have the homies have to ride and smoke you

[Xzibit:]
Man fuck what you goin through emotional nigga,
I'm a empire you workin with promotional figures,
Entrepreneur niggaz, rollin with disposable triggers,
So I can deliver some millimetres right in ya liver,
This for my niggaz with that bounce,
Ludacris, Lil Flip, Pastor Troy Lil Jon down south,
And be careful for them hoes that's reliably aquired,
Ask Kobe Bryant nigga I ain't lyin,
One day they gone break that sign it's a [? ]
Protect ya assets get that bitch on tape,
Dictate, legislate through the golden state Ras Kass bring ya ass home we gone celebrate,
Half these broads in L.A ya can't touch,
Cause half been ran through the other half coked up,
Think twice it's yo life sacrifice worth wait then platinum and nice

[Chorus: x2]
Calm down lil nigga I ain't tryna provoke you,
Jus a lil sumat you can ride and smoke to,
I hate to have the homies have to ride and smoke you,
I hate to have the homies have to ride and smoke you
