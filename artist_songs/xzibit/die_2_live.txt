Break the bank, make my heatbreak escalate
I can't wait 'til the sun come up
Come precise like a diamond cut
I live life like my time is up
So I ain't got no time to waste
Don't want to watch with a diamond face
I want a watch through a scope
Head shot from a mile away, your head pop
Like JFK, like a plot by the CIA
We ain't dyin' from the KKK
When that AK spray, they say Ay Bay Bay
Stay tuned, watch the melee play
Get attached to the tracks and the facts
Through the words I say
Gotta navigate out my way, I'm a roadside IED
Dead make no live TV
Larry King, all eyes on me
Now put your hands where my eyes can see

And if I die, before I wake
I pray the lord, my soul to take
'Cause I have faith, and I can't wait
To get these obstacles up out of my face
'Cause this my time, and this my crime
And not even midnight can stop my shine
I never give up, the ultimate seer
Get ready to die, but I'm dying to live
(Dying to live)

Chyeah, the hustlest thing
Caught in between greed and the best of things
I don't even breathe, expand my chest for tea
Benjamin green leaves in a nest of thieves
I get down on my knees and beg God to
Forgive my sins, back at it again
Raise up like Attica did
Shift down fourth to fifth, and burn like an arsonist
West bow down, PCH, catchin' nothin' but green lights
My foot never touch the brakes
My lil' money make moves in Vegas
Shit, Cali like the San Andreas
I'm the truth in the booth, you a space invader
Go ahead and hate me, hater
Hack your harddrive and erase the data
'Til I come face to face with my creator
Bust back, but I'm lyin' boy, no ultimatum
I'm too smart to assassinate 'em
Try and touch me, it's buyin' them just
Time, nigga return the favor
I return the emancipator
May we all progress to the power of X
(Power of X)

And if I die, before I wake
I pray the lord, my soul to take
'Cause I have faith, and I can't wait
To get these obstacles up out of my face
'Cause this my time, and this my crime
And not even midnight can stop my shine
I never give up, the ultimate seer
Get ready to die, but I'm dying to live
(Dying to live)

What you know about mass appeal
I peel loud as I crush the wheel
Death certificate signed and sealed
Take a journey down the road to glory
Pay attention to a soldiers story

There will be none after
There was none before me
X men will stand the test
A thin line between life and death
Sometime it suck when you find success
Lost Prince never lost respect
Comin' home like I die right this
Another time and the place is set
It's been a long hard, ready to go
Circle up come on, start the show
So I can breathe and achieve the impossible
I want the bootleggers to get it
The wise words of Xzibit
You never see me crash and burn
I'm dying to live it
Who ready for a revolution
Who ready for a real solution
Save the music

And if I die, before I wake
I pray the lord, my soul to take
'Cause I have faith, and I can't wait
To get these obstacles up out of my face
'Cause this my time, and this my crime
And not even midnight can stop my shine
I never give up, the ultimate seer
Get ready to die, but I'm dying to live
