Yeah man, I'm glad to have this opportunity
cuz I never get to sit down and chop it with y'all
Man, face to face, so you know I definitely wanna get fucked up
[fills glass with ice]
Yeah man, I'm glad I need to sit down and chop it with y'all man
cuz I never had an opportunity to do that, so, yeah
I want to blaze something up too, you smoke? good
You mind if I smoke? well, alright

[Verse 1]
[Inhales] So let me introduce myself
X to the motherfuckin Z [exhales]
I had to introduce myself appropriately
I'm that nigga you was hoping to see, fall flat on my ace
Look respect then fall from grace
But you know, [inhales] things move slow
I refuse to lose the game like dude from blow [exhales]
Like it ain't crazy enough, huh
My life got ups and downs like an all night fuck,so what [inhales]
Y'all really want from me [exhales]
I'm trying to live with two hoes like three's company
Ask me what is success
Nigga, success is when your no mean no and your yes means yes
And you can stand by your word cuz your word is your balls
[Inhales] Lose one your losing them all [exhales]
All hail to alcohol
Cuz it's my turn now try again tomorrow

[Chorus]
Roll another blenny up, pour another drink
I want everybody to get fucked up with me
Get a glass and fill it up
Lick the philly, seal it up
Everybody get fucked up with me
Roll another blenny up, pour another drink
I want everybody to get fucked up with me
Get a glass and fill it up
Lick the philly, seal it up
Everybody get fucked up with me

[Verse 2]
Life's a real bitch sometimes [coughing] oh shit! [coughing] wait
Okay I got it [coughing]I got it, I got it [coughing] I got it, hold up
Life's a real bitch sometimes
Your heartbeat raising like the rate of the crime
I could probably turn water to wine
Restless, double platinum, it's the sign of the time
It ain't my fault, your kids wanna c-walk
Dress how we dress and talk like we talk [inhales]
Ask Miss Cleo [exhales] if this is the matrix, I'm Neo
This is dedicated to that female CEO
That sucked my brother's dick for jolly St. Nick
Shit [inhales] make some room [exhales]
Somebody laced this shit with shrooms, cuz I'm flying

[Chorus]

[Inhales] What's the big deal [exhales]
Couple of [pause] shootings, couple of [pause] get killed
Happens everyday around this way
Took my homie lil' Mo dog and blew him away
Shit [inhales] at the age of 19, what a bummer'
Another crazy ass summer
These types of things never die down easy
Gang of retaliation, homeboy believe me (*inhales]
