Way to go, way to go and say you're feeling a little bad
You're getting a little old for this
Well you said you weren't coming
Or we would have come back man
We would have come back for you
It turned out to be something quite special
A really cool party, man, a solid group of people
And, and I wish you could have been there
You would have loved the way the place looked
But it died down right before dawn
So what was I supposed to do?

And they all said, hey
And they all said, where's your friend?
I know it's easy now to defend yourself man
But you got to know when to shed your skin
Woah, oh, oh, woah, oh, oh

Man I swear we would have come back for you man
But the light was on out there and we had to go get it
Oh we would have, swear we would have, we would have, swear we would have come back for you man
But we had such a hunger and we could not take it

And they all said hey
And they all said, where's your friend?
I know it's easy now to defend yourself man
But you got to know when to shed your skin
Woah, oh, oh, hey
Woah, oh, oh, how's he been?
I know it's easy now to defend yourself man
But you got to know when to shed your skin

And they all said...
And they all said...
And you probably would have hated it anyways
There were too many people in the hallways
And they all said...
