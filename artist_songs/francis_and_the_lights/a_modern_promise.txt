I wouldn't even talk to you
Call me on a Sunday night
I wouldn't even talk
But you got that kinda voice I like
So if you give it up, so long
You can call me anytime you want
I know it's wrong
But you could call me noon until the dawn
Anytime at all
But I won't be waiting for a call, I'll be...
Givin' it up

Now I
I wouldn't even talk to you
You called me Abraham
You're a beautiful girl
But you got to call me Starlite now
Now all my friends, my very best friends
They call me
Well, I guess they call me Abraham
When they fuck up
But all the beautiful girls
They call me Starlite now
So guess what, bitch
You can call me Francis (Francis!)
You can call me anything you want (Starlite!)
You could call me noon until the dawn
Baby (Francis!)
Anything you like (Starlite!)
Noon until the night
And I'll be
Givin' it up

Six days ago
Called me on the telephone
You said, "You made me promise
A long time ago... "
