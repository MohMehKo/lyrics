When the lights go out
In your building
I will call you
Saying, "Are you sleeping yet?"

Then I take two steps and I'm turning back again
The same color scene keeps playing in my head
I could take you home but you're already there
Standing by the windowsill, hands in the air
How long would you stay up
To see me come in?
How long would you stay up
What if I'm not coming at all?

The night man now is turning out the light

Two steps, I'm turning back again
Back to the roof, back to ledge
Late drive a cab, she say, "He's a bad man"
It's just a short trip over the bridge

I've gotten used to it
Being alone
Now it's all I've got
