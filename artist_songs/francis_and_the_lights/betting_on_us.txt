Oh no, oh no

This foreign interest, man, they're running my business
They say I've gone too far
The conditions worsened and clouded my vision
They say I wanted too much
Thought about it for a minute and I came to the decision
That they're probably right here
I am tired of waiting
And I want it too much
And so I'm stepping on up to the plate
And I'm betting on us all the way

The check engages, man, they come in the stages
They say they won't give up
They've been clocking my numbers
But I'm working the summers
'Cause I want it so much
I was down in the trenches - doing my time
Now I'm swinging for the fences - it's all on the line
And I'm nervous and shaking
Tired and patient
And I want to go home

But no, I'm stepping on up to the plate
And I'm betting on us all the way

I'm not betting on luck, no
It's just a lie, it's just a lie, just a lie
'Cause I've been waiting forever
But I know I can get it if I want it so much

So I'm betting on us
That's why I'm betting on us
I'm betting on us
I'm betting on us
I'm betting on us
That's why I'm betting on us, yeah
All the way, yeah
All the way, all the way
Betting on us
Stepping up
Goddammit, what am I waiting for?
Oh no, betting on us
Set it up
Shame on me, what am I waiting for?
