It's a shame
That's what it is
I've been watching you for days now
I'd never say I wish that it would happen
But in a way I wish it would

But oh, I didn't do a thing
But if there was just an air strike
Or a natural disaster
You could have been mine
Oh!
I hope that I didn't go too far
But I've been watching you for days now
You never know
They could come tomorrow
And in a way I wish they would

But oh, I didn't do a thing
But if there was just an air strike
Or a natural disaster
You could have been mine
Oh!

Here I am, staring at you
Wish you wouldn't look away when you know I want you
I wish I had four days alone with you
I wish I had
But you could have changed my mind in a second
If you'd given me one second
Just to think
You could've looked me in the eye when you said it
Or given me one second
Give me one second
Gimme one second

If there was just an air strike
Or a natural disaster
You could have been mine
Oh!

Stop baby
I said stop baby
