Made it to tomorrow
Thought we had a deal
Sold my whole life story
Spun it on the wheel
I hear they're out to get me
They're probably on the way

But if they don't come tomorrow
If they don't come tomorrow
Rebels in the movies
Always on the run
I've been stuck here for so long
Waiting for a sign
I always pack a suitcase
Just in case they come

But if they don't come tomorrow
If they don't come tomorrow

Shouldn't say I'm sorry
For what I haven't done
I've sure done a lot of talking
About things that haven't come
They might come tomorrow
But they might never come

But if they don't come tomorrow
If they don't come tomorrow

If they don't come tomorrow
If they don't come tomorrow
