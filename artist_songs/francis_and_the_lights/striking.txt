Right now, there's something wrong with you
After all, looking out the window
At various illusions
You're still elusive
I don't want to lose you, oh

I swear I'm going crazy here
I just can't contain myself from looking out the window
I know it isn't real
I don't want to lose it, though
No, no
Yeah, yeah
Oh, there's something in the air tonight
Something real
Just down the hall
I want it all tonight
'Cause I'm a monolith

Look at me, I tell you no, no
Show me the door
Just calm down
