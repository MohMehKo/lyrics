It was the coldest December anyone had ever seen
A seven-page letter came
Not a nickel you don't owe me
'Cause you told me to let it go
You said it's time
Said let it go
You said it's time

Now you found yourself lonely
But it's only a matter of time
You laugh a little, but you cry a lot
You find yourself a nice spot to walk away lonely
Don't forget you told me to set my goals
You said it's time
I set my goals, baby
Yes I did, I set mine
I set my goals
I set my goals I couldn't stand it anymore
I set my goals now I'm living my life every day

If you can't help, baby
Said I set it up
Now it's just a matter of time
Said I set my goals, said I set mine
I set it up, baby
So raise your hands!
