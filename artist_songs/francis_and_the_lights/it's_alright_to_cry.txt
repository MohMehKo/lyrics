There's an easier way to say it
But I don't think I can say it
There's a simple way to describe it
But I don't think I should try to describe it

It's alright to cry, it might make you feel better baby
It's alright to cry, it might make you feel better baby
Better baby

I wouldn't bother leaving
If leaving didn't mean you had to say goodbye
I always want to leave
But I never want to say goodbye, oh

It's alright to cry, it might make you feel better baby
It's alright to cry, cry, cry, it might make you feel better baby
Better baby, better baby, oh, oh
(I want to show you my love, show love...)
It's alright to cry, it might make you feel better baby
It's alright to cry, cry, cry, it might make you feel better baby (Show my love, your love, yeah I'll show...)
Better baby, better baby, oh, oh

Baby I told you I'm sorry
I was waiting on a different story
I'm still waiting on it
While I was waiting for it to come
Now I know, now I see the difference
Now I know the truth

It's alright to cry, it might make you feel better baby
(Your love, your love, your love)
It's alright to cry, it might make you feel better baby

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Mmm oh, mmm oh, mmm oh
Woah, oh, well...
Mmm oh, mmm oh
Ayy, ayy, oh, oh
Your love is an empty well
Black as night
And they poke at me
They kill me
Leave me as ice
