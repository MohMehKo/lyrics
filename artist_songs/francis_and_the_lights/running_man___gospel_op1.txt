Blow out a candle
Electric flame
You really gave me a run, Forrest
For my money, yeah
Total Recall
Every street light
A reminder
I'm looking backwards
From where I came
Oooh
Oooh

You really gave me a run, Forrest
For my money, yeah
You really gave me a run, Forrest
For my money, yeah

Oooooh
If I survive
And we're still (both) running
Both running
Ahh hah
And is that sung nowhere?
And if it's nowhere then I wanna know
I wanna know

[?]
I don't know why
I don't know why
