Darling, darling, darling
I was only sorry for a little while
For things that made me dream of coming back
Forgive me
My enemies return
They're coming back

But it's alright
It's alright
If you wanna break down and cry
It's alright
Wait
We spent a long time
Playing silly games long ago it seems
But it was days ago I think
Now I'm calling
Darling, darling, darling
I called your name
And I said forgive me
All my enemies, often wrong
They come, they're coming back

That's why I said it's alright
It's alright
If you wanna break down and cry
If I wanna make darling cry
For the last time in my life

If you wanna break down
If you wanna break down
If you wanna shout
If you wanna break down
It's alright
