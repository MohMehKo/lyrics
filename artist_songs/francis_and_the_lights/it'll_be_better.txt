Man it's like I'm living in a factory
Working with metal
Working away

Oh
Oh but if you come back to me
It'll be better
It'll be great
So what should I do?
What should I do?
What should I say?

Except that if you come back to me
It'll be better
It'll be great

Living is easy now
Everything's swell
I can't keep waiting
I've got nothing to give you

Oh
What's it gonna be
What's it gonna be
What's it gonna take

I swear to God that if you come back to me
It'll be better
It'll be great

It'll be great...

Oh
What's it gonna be
What's it gonna be
What's it gonna take

I swear to God that if you come back to me
It'll be better
It'll be great
