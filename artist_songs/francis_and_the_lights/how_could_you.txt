Back then we used to be alone
And I wandered far from home
How could you stand to be alone again?
How could you stand to be alone again?

I knew, see I knew when I saw you just the other day
Wearing your high-heeled shoes on your day off
Then I started wondering
How could you stand to be alone again?
How could you stand to be alone again?
How could you stand...
