Please stop saying et cetera
Tell me every last thing you said to him
I've been lying every second when I was at home
When I'm lying here, I'm lying here next to you
As it was cold I'm sorry I got you up [?]
And I really didn't want to upset you
I was sitting in the car and making all calm
But I guess I didn't want to affect you so

Oh, stop saying et cetera
Tell me every last thing you said to him
I'll be sorry in the morning
I got so proud opening up
I really didn't want to upset you
I've been sitting in the forward next to you
Saying really I'm sorry and it's not your fault
I'll be sitting on the phone afraid to make a sound
That I really can't stand how you're giving in always

What will we do from here?
What will we do, and will we be happy?
Will we?
When we wake up, will we wake up?

Oh, stop saying et cetera
Tell me every last thing he said to you
I believe everything that you said before
But I really don't see why it set you off
When I kiss you it really set you off
'Cause you really couldn't stand to let me know
We'll be sorry in the morning
When the masks fall off
And I really can't stand how you're giving in always

What will we say to them?
What will we say, and will we be happy?
Will we?
When we wake up, will we wake up?
What if we're dreaming?
I mean really
When we wake up, will we wake up?
