Lighten up baby, things will never be this bad again
But you could have had the decency to call me
That's alright this time, I'll make it up to you somehow if I can
Lighten up baby, things will never be this bad again
But you could have had the decency to call me
That's alright this time, I'll make it up to you somehow if I can
Maybe we'll go ride in a limousine

Singing, it doesn't matter
Save it for a rainy day
They're falling down the mirror, they're falling down a windowpane
It doesn't matter, just put it in your pocket
They're falling down the mirror, hey look at all the droplets
Say you're alright, say you're better then you were last night
But if anybody asks you, don't answer
Say everything went blank, cause water trickled down my face
Even if there's someone running after you

Simply tell them, it doesnt matter
Just save it for a rainy day
They're falling down the mirror, they're falling down a windowpane
It doesn't matter, just put it in your pocket
They're falling down the mirror, hey look at all the droplets

You're gonna call me up just to say you're feeling sorry for me
It doesn't matter
Cause somebody broke my heart
Singing a song to me
On a stereo, a car stereo, singing...

Oh, it doesn't matter
Save it for a rainy day
They're falling down the mirror, they're falling down a windowpane
It doesn't matter, just put it in your pocket
They're falling down the mirror, hey look at all the droplets

Hey look at all the droplets, hey look...
