Hey

I should have told you sooner
I think you're great
But I've got to be alone here
And you
You could do much better
You get the message
You get the message
But wish it came through a little clearer

I should tap the phone
Take a taxi home
Write a song for the radio
Then I could hear you
When you're on the phone
And you could hear me on the radio

Hey
What a waste of time
I like your outfits I like your outfits
But I've got to be on mind

And you
You could do much better
You like the music you like the music but wish the songs could last forever

Now it's its, its' late
Haven't we been through this
I think you're great
But I just can't do this

If only I could tap tap tap the phone
Take a taxi home
Write a song for the radio
Then I could hear you
When you're on the phone
And you could hear me on the radio

Every hour

Tap the phone
Take a taxi home
Write a song for thew radio
Then I could hear you
I don't have to be near you
And you could hear me on the radio
Whenever you want to

Hey...

Hey...

Hey...

Time's... time's up
