Just give me information
Give me information
Tell me everything
Come see me on the phone ring
Just give me the headphones; turn up everything
(Ooh, yeah)

If you see her out there
Climbing a wall
Trying to get away
Tell her she can't escape
Whole damn world is a cage
Whole damn world is a cage

If you see her out there
Behind the wheel
Driving getaway
Oh God, I hope she escapes
Whole damn world is a cage

But that's just life
I lived it twice
I treat you right
The way you taught me
That's just life
I lived it twice
So I said goodnight
Don't say it softly

If you see her out there
Behind the wheel
Driving getaway
Oh God, I hope she escapes
Whole damn world is a cage

But that's just life
I lived it twice
I treat you right
The way you taught me
That's just life
I lived it twice
So say goodnight
Don't say it softly
