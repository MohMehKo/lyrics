Guess I should have been your friend
Guess so

Guess I should have held your hand
Guess so
My how people change
I guess I should have known
Guess I should have gone all the way
Knees to the floor

You could try to talk me down
Use every trick in the book
But I won't be coming back
So get a good look

Headed for the city an hour away
Gonna have to look at you different
A simple reason to stay in one place
I wouldn't be surprised if you didn't

So say goodbye to the people that lie to your face
Everything you thought you were missing
Headed for the city an hour away
You're gonna have to make a decision

Oh oh oh

Should have the been the way that I wanted to
When I wanted you so
I guess so

My how people change I guess I should have known
Guess I should have gone all the way
Knees to the floor
Knees to the floor

You could try to talk me out of it
Use every trick in the book
But I won't be coming back
So get a good look

Headed for the city an hour away
They're gonna have to look at you differently
They got a good reason to take it away
It wouldn't be the same if they didn't

So say goodbye to the people that lie to your face
Everything you thought you were doing
Headed for the city an hour away
Never know is this what you wanted

Headed for the city an hour away
They're gonna have to look at you different
You took it for granted they took it away
It wouldn't be the same if they didn't

So say goodbye to the people that lie to your face
Everything they said they would give you
Headed for the city an hour away
I always said that I would be with you

Knees to the floor
Knees to the floor
Knees to the floor
