Of all the pretty faces in the crowd
Or in my mind
Of all the pretty places I could go
There isn't one I wouldn't leave behind
And go out, on a train
On a train

Said of all the pretty girls I have met
There is only one
If I could get the chance
To do it all over again
I'd do it on a train
On a train
And of all the pretty things I could say
I could write them down and send them away
I think I might rather just slip away
On a train
On a train
