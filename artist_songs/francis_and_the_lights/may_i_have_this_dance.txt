In the ground we bury
The seeds of a pear tree
All the things we carried
Now we're down to our bare feet

May I have this dance
To make it up to you
Can I say something crazy
I love you
Give me both your hands
To make it up to you
Let me spin and excite you

I'm about to inherit
Ooooooooooooh
The sins of our parents
Ooooooooooooh
And all of the people we passed through
Ooooooooooooh
Now we're down to the last two

May I have this dance
To make it up to you
Can I say something crazy
I love you
Give me both your hands
To make it up to you
Let me spin and excite you

To make it up to you
Dance
To make it up to you
Ooooooooooooh

May I have this dance
To make it up to you
Can I say something crazy
I love you
Give me one more chance
Give me one more chance
Give me one more
To make it up to you
Let me spin and excite you

To make it up to you
Never gonna stay
Can I say something crazy
I love you
Give me one more chance
Give me one more chance
Give me one more
To make it up to you
Let me spin and excite you
