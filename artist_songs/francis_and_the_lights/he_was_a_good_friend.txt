Wasn't it just last year we were in the very same position?
You sat me down on the cold floor
You said that this time, I don't think she's coming back
Now I always thought she was alright
Something about the way she looked me in the eyes
And people always said we saw things the same way
So I think you'll be just fine

But I don't think she's coming back this time, this time
Wasn't it just last year we were in the very same position?
That's when I told you you've never been anything but good to me
So when two knocks rang out on my door
I swear to God I told you the very same thing
I said I, I don't really wanna talk about it, no no
He was a good friend of mine
Maybe you should go out and put on some fresh clothes, man
See a movie
Laugh out loud

'Cause I don't think she's coming back this time, this time

Have you ever been lonesome?
Have you ever lost someone?
Wasn't it just last year I... I...
