Did you sleep?
Did I keep you awake dear?
Did you dream?
Of somewhere in the middle?
Was it great?
Was it what you expected?
Something great?
Or just
Somewhere in the ballpark?

I want you to shake
I want you to shake
I want you to shit
Not just
Somewhere in the ballpark

Don't you dare to be loathed
Something far more controlled
Don't you dare tell me nothing
Not just
Somewhere in the ballpark
I got you
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooooh
Oooh, ooooh
Somewhere in the ballpark

Did you lie for a come up?
Was your meaning obscured?
Did you die for a reason?
Not just, not just, not
Want to think
Somewhere in the ballpark

I want you to shake
I want you to shake
I want you
Not just somewhere in the ballpark
