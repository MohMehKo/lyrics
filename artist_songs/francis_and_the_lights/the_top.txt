Mother mine
Look at my life
What have I done?
I let you down
But look at me
Look at me now
I said where?
I said where?

Father, father
I spent a long time, long time
Looking for a father figure
No, no, no
Afraid
I don't care anymore
I don't care
I said where?
I said where?
Baby, baby
I'm sorry now
Sorry that I made you cry
I didn't mean to hurt you, girl
I was just jealous
Just a jealous guy
But I'm a man now
I said where?!
I said where?
