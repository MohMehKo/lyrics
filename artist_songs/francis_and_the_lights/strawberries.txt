Here I go again
I told her, "No"
She comes around again
I couldn't go
She said, "Give me something
Give me gold"
I said, "Give me something
That I can hold, instead"

But tell me
Tell me
Tell me
About your strawberry love, if it really doesn't go for what I said
Strawberries
You don't know how
I'm drunk up off your seeds
I'll lick it 'til it bleeds

Strawberries, strawberries
You don't know how
I'm drunk up off your seeds
I'll lick it 'til it bleeds

She comes around again
I couldn't go
Again
All I ever wanted was to know
Here, there, and then
She said, "Baby, can I take you for a little ride out?"
I didn't know
I said, "Baby, can I love you for one long lonely night?
A little more? Please?"
But either way, you got to

Tell me
Tell me
Tell me
About your strawberry love, if it really doesn't go for what I said

Strawberries
You don't know how
I'm drunk up off your seeds
I'll lick it 'til it bleeds

Strawberries, strawberries
You don't know how
I'm drunk up off your seeds
I'll lick it 'til it bleeds

See, I'm not trying to be cold baby
But sometimes, sometimes

Strawberries
