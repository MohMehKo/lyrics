Like a dream
Like a dream

I was waiting for a man to come and get me
But he looked like a child
I ended up sleeping in the back of a mail truck
In Midtown Manhattan
I don't know how it happened
Like a dream
Like a dream
I wanted to tell you
I wanted to tell you

I was waiting for a show to start
The crowd was going wild
I thought I saw you dancing
Dancing in the aisles

One of these days my mind will stop racing
And I'll get me some sleep
'Cause I'm ready
For the big time
Is it ready for me?

Like a dream
Like a dream
I wanted to tell you
I wanted to tell you
Like a dream...
