I'm always chasing rainbows
Watching clouds drifting by
My schemes are just like all my dreams
Ending in the sky.

Some fellas look and find the sunshine
I always look and find the rain
Some fellas make a winning sometime
I never even make a gain, believe me.

I'm always chasing rainbows
Waiting to find a little bluebird in vain.

Some fellas look and find the sunshine

I'm always chasing rainbows
Waiting to find a little bluebird in vain.
