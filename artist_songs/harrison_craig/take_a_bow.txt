I feel so dumb right now
You standing outside my house
Trying to apologize
It's so pain for when you cry
Just cut it out

Don't tell me you're sorry 'cause you're not
When I know you're only sorry you got caught
You put on quite a show
Really had me going
Now it's time to go
Curtain's finally closing
That was quite a show
Very entertaining
But it's over now
Go on and take a bow

Grab your things and be gone 
You better hurry up
Before the sprinklers come on
Telling me
I love you, you're the one
This just looks like a re-run
What else is on

Don't tell me you're sorry 'cause you're not
When I know you're only sorry you got caught
You put on quite a show
Really had me going
Now it's time to go
Curtain's finally closing
That was quite a show
Very entertaining
But it's over now
Go on and take a bow

And the award for
The best liar goes to you
For making me believe
That you could be faithful to me
Let's hear your speech

How about a round of applause
A standing ovation

But you put on quite a show
Really had me going
Now it's time to go
Curtain's finally closing
That was quite a show
Very entertaining
But it's over now 
Go on and take a bow
But it's over now
