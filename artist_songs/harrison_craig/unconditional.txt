And I would do anything for you 
Not words, no I really mean it 
Let the whole damn world declare war on me 
Just for standing by your side 
If you leave, you were the one way I'd survive 
I'd gladly die I mean it 

And I would do anything for you 
Uncondition, unconditional love 
And I would do anything for you 
Uncondition, unconditional love 

And I would do anything for you 
Not words, let my actions speak it 
Let the sun decide that it won't shine 
Until I say that we are through 
I will live my life in darkness just for you 
I swear it's true, I mean it 

And I would do anything for you 
Uncondition, unconditional love 
And I would do anything for you 
I'm talking uncondition, unconditional love 
Uncondition, unconditional love 

I don't care about what's popular 
I don't hear a word they say 
What I know is that it's you and me 
Until the both of us die in death 

And I would do anything for you 
Uncondition, unconditional love 
I would do anything for you 
I'm talking uncondition, unconditional love 

I would do anything 
I would do anything 
I would do anything 
Uncondition, unconditional love 

I would do anything 
I would do anything 
I would do anything for you 
Uncondition, unconditional love
