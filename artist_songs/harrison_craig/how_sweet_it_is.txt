How sweet it is to be loved by you. 
How sweet it is to be loved by you.

I needed the shelter of someone's arms and there you were.
I needed someone to understand my ups and downs and there you were.
With sweet love and devotion, deeply touching my emotion,
I want to stop and thank you baby. 
I want to stop and thank you baby.

How sweet it is to be loved by you. 
How sweet it is to be loved by you.

I close my eyes at night wondering 
where would I be without you in my life.
Everything I did was just a bore, 
everywhere I went it seems I'd been there before.
But you brighten up for me all of my days 
with a love so sweet in so many ways,
I want to stop and thank you baby, 
I want to stop and thank you baby.

How sweet it is to be loved by you,
How sweet it is to be loved by you.

I want to stop and thank you baby. 
I want to stop and thank you baby,

How sweet it is to be loved by you, 
How sweet it is to be loved by you...
