I'm not one to run away.
Through anything in front of me,
lived a thousand lives in melodies,
they've overtaken me.

I'm not one to hide my face,
over you my dear my saving grace,
through the storm your harmonies,
or my heartbeat.

And I, I never thought.
Never believed,
Never could see.
The walls were bigger than me,
but I tore then down, I tore them down.
In front of me, it's more than a dream

Saw myself just sail away.
Into the blue, beyond the grave
seeking better days, 
where you found me.

The walls of misty hays,
blocked my sides,
stopped my gaze,
pushing me away...from you

And I, I never thought.
Never believed,
Never could see.
The walls were bigger than me,
but I tore then down, I tore them down.
In front of me, it's more than a dream

And I held my head high.
But you never saw me cry.
Darling tonight, turn on the light
I've made up my mind
It's about time
We'll be alright, tonight

And I, I never thought.
Never believed,
Never could see.
The walls were bigger than me,
but I tore then down, I tore them down.
In front of me, to more than,
To more than...a dream.
To more than a dream.
