I won't be satisfied with okay 
And I can't be okay with alright 
So point me to the edge of life 
I'll stand up on my toes 
Stretch my fingers out to there and bring it back here 

It's too important for us to forget 
We'll unify our thoughts 
God will hear and save 
God will hear and save us 

All together standing up on our toes 
Reaching for the freedom that they don't know 
So catch it as it pours down 
We know what we need 
Don't get tired when you're running back to show them 

It's too important for us to forget 
We'll unify our thoughts 
God will hear and save 
God will hear and save us

I won't be satisfied with okay 
And I can't be okay with alright 
So point me to the edge of life 
I'll stand up on my toes 
Stretch my fingers out to there and bring it back here
