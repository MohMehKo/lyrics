So many wasted days
Come and go like ocean waves
It hits me like a freight train
And now I can't get off my face

How could I have been so polite to simply let them die
Who am I to spread my fingers after God has filled my hands
Watching the moments slip through like desert sand

Respect her ignorance
Just in case she takes offense
The darkness that's killing her
Well that is just not my concern

How could I have been so polite to simply let them die
Who am I to spread my fingers after God has filled my hands
Watching the moments slip through like desert sand

You're not guaranteed tomorrow
You're not guaranteed tomorrow

How could I have been so polite to simply let them die
Who am I to spread my fingers after God has filled my hands
Watching the moments slip through like desert sand
