I have made you an enemy
I have been my own enemy
I am asking for you to forgive me
For everything

If you don't
You're worthy of compassion
If you do
You're a better man than I am

If you don't know, you're my family
Enemy
I'm sorry
Oh, enemy, family
Forgive me

If you don't
You're worthy of compassion
If you do
You're a better man than I am
If you do
You're a better man than I am

Enemy, enemy, family, family
