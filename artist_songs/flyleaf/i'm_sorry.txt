I'm sorry
I don't mean to remember
It's true that I dream less often
I'm not ashamed
Of that long December
Your hand's coming down again

I close my eyes and brace myself
I only noticed your face
No matter what you're gonna build my shell
No matter what you're gonna build my shell

I'm falling (falling)
I'm shedding my skin (my skin)
But it's not time I'm told
I am aware (am aware)
Of what you mean by then
I'm only ten years old

Close my eyes and brace myself
Only noticed your face
No matter what you're gonna build my shell
No matter what you're gonna build my shell

My scars are yours today
This story ends so good
I love you and I understand
That you stood where I stood

Close my eyes and brace myself
I only noticed your face
No matter what you're gonna break my shell
No matter what you're gonna break my shell

I'm done healing
I'm done healing
