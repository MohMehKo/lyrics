I saw the queen
Swam out below her star on sea beneath
Though I lifted up my hands to her
She never lifted me

Oh, something's missing in me
I felt it deep within me
As lovers left me to bleed alone

Found something sweet
On the island with the daughters of eve
But through thick and thin they've gone away
And only left their grief

Oh, something's missing in me
I felt it deep within me
As lovers left me to bleed alone

Something's missing in me
I felt it deep within me
As lovers left me to bleed alone

Something's missing in me
Something's missing in me

Down here, love wasn't meant to be
It wasn't meant to be for me
Down here, love wasn't meant to be
It wasn't meant to be for me
(all is vanity, underneath the sun, all is vanity)

Oh, something's missing in me
I felt it deep within me
As lovers left me to bleed alone

Something's missing in me
I felt it deep within me
As lovers left me to bleed alone

Something's missing in me
Something's missing in me
Something's missing in me
Something's missing in me
