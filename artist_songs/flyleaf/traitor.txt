Pull your window down
Tinted glass is hiding your eyes
It's your favorite disguise
You don’t make a sound
While you’re taking me for a ride
Holding secrets inside

Traitor, this is my life
I'm too strong to lie down next to a mastermind
Traitor, every time
I’ll no longer keep you a friend of mine

Tell me once again
How’d you build a kingdom of trust?
It's beginning to rust
And where have you been?
Promises were never enough
They collect in the dust

Traitor, this is my life
I'm too strong to lie down next to a mastermind
Traitor, every time
I’ll no longer keep you a friend of mine

Traitor, this is my life
I'm too strong to lie down next to a mastermind
Traitor, every time
I’ll no longer keep you a friend of mine
