You said “come on, let's go down that yellow brick road”
But that path was primrose and led back to black and white
And now I know, since that day you chose to let me know
My hearts been tangled with thorns that choke the light
Oh, here I go, collecting roses to me from you
Oh, here I go, a dozen red for every wound
Oh, now I stop and smell the roses when they’re blue

Gonna find my way, break the lock on the emerald city gates
It could be simple, but we’re only half-awake
I feel the pain set in when I think of you and grip the stems
I feel my head begin to spin, I'm not alright

Oh, here I go, collecting roses to me from you
Oh, here I go, a dozen red for every wound
Oh, now I stop and smell the roses when they’re blue
Let go of the stems, free to bloom again
Let go of the stems, free to bloom again

Oh, here I go, collecting roses to me from you
Oh, here I go, a dozen red for every wound
Oh, now I stop and smell the roses when they’re blue
(Stop, stop, stop…)
Let go of the stems, free to bloom again
Free to bloom again when they're blue
