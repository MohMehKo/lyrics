I feel your eyes crawling over me
As though I am something more than me
But I don't have anything good enough to say
I did not make myself this way

I'll show you what he did but I wont take the credit
It's not mine anyway I just held the pen that day

[Chorus:]
I don't deserve this
This time right now
It's not something for which I can take the bow
I don't deserve this; it wasn't me
I can't take glory for something that I can't create
I don't deserve this

I know what perfection is like
I cannot stand before its might
And I'm so far from what you think that I must be I just drown myself in mercy

I'll show you what he did but I wont take the credit
It's not mine anyway I just held the pen that day

[Chorus]

I don't deserve this
This time right now is not something for which I can take the blame
I don't deserve this

And all the art that I supposedly create
Is simply a faded reflection of something he's already made

[Chorus]

I don't deserve this
