What makes you happy
What makes you smile
And when you smile please
Is it for real

I know you're not one
One to pretend
Even when I was a child

You grow up too fast
And have to be brave
Braver than most strong men
That I've ever seen

Sing your song mama
Sing it out loud
I wanna hear your voice
It's lovely sound

Little girl
You can come out now
The danger's all gone
You can come out

All that you've held
Was too much to hold
So let it all go now
And you will become gold

Sing your song mama
Sing it out loud
I wanna hear your voice
It's lovely sound

Sing your song mama
Sing it out loud
Dance freely singing
You're beautiful now

Laughter and tears
Gracing your face
The music of your strength
Held up this place

Your daddy's right here now
You can let go
He's holding it all now
And healing your soul

Sing your song mama
Sing it out loud
I wanna hear your voice
It's lovely sound

Sing your song mama
Sing it out loud
Dance freely singing
You're beautiful know

There's something
I'm trying to tell you and
I've tried to tell you before and
Each time that I profess it
It just leaves me wanting more and

I think you are beautiful
And I'm proud of you
What I'm trying to say is
I love you
I love you
