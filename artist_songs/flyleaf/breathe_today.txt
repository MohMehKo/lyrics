You can only move as fast as,
Who's in front of you,
And if you assume,
Just like them,
What good will it do,
So find out for yourself
So your ignorance,
Will stop bleeding through.

You can breathe today

So many lies swirling,
All around you,
You're suffocating,
The empty shape in you,
Steals your breath,
You're suffocating.

Logic forces me to believe in this,
And I have learned to see,
And I can only say what I've seen and heard,
And only you can choose,
And every choice you make will affect you,
Suit your own self.

You can breathe today

So many lies swirling,
All around you,
You're suffocating,
The empty shape in you,
Steals your breath,
You're suffocating.

Breathe!!!

Big enough to fill the void that's inside of you,
It's just a breath away.

[x2]
So many lies swirling,
All around you,
You're suffocating,
The empty shape in you,
Steals your breath,
You're suffocating.

So many lies swirling,
All around you,
You're suffocating,
The empty shape in you,
Steals your breath (breath!),

So many lies swirling,
All around you (breath!),
You're suffocating,
The empty shape in you,

Breathe today.
