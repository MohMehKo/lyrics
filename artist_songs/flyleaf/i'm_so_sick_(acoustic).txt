I will break, into your thoughts
With what's written on my heart
I will break...

You broke into my thoughts
This invasion makes me feel
Worthless, hopless sick
I'm so sick

If you want more of this
We can push out, sell out, die out
So you'll shut up and stay sleeping
With my screaming in your itching ears

I'm so sick,
Infected with where I live
Let me live without this
Empty bliss, selfishness
Let me live...

Hear it
I am screaming it
You're heeding to it now

You broke into my thoughts
This invasion makes me feel
Worthless, hopeless sick
I'm so sick

I'm so sick,
Infected with where I live
Let me live without this
Empty bliss, selfishness
Let me live...

I reveal
What you steal from
All of us
We take it back...
We take it back!

You broke into into my thoughts
This invasion makes me feel
Worthless, Hopeless sick
I'm so sick

But I heal
With this story, always working, constant purpose
But I heal...
I won't compromise and I heal
