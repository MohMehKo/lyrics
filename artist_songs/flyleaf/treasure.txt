Can I tell you a story
As we dance while the sun starts to bleed
Song of songs love is calling
Daughter wake up from your sleep

Refined I’ll become the most dazzling precious treasure
I’ll be treasured over all the earth

Bearing the gift of a new heart
Patience ablaze
I’m slowly burning

Refined I'll become the most dazzling precious treasure
I'll be treasured over all the earth
Refined I'll become the most dazzling precious treasure
I'll be treasured over all the earth

I am in awe and in shock
I’m in love and given away
I’m reserved with these words

Can I tell you a story
As we dance while the Son starts to bleed
Trees rejoice with the wind here
Hallelujah, Yeshua

Tonight I’ve become the most dazzling precious
I am treasured over all the earth
Just look at what he’s done
How he’s laying down his life
Take this life
oh most dazzling precious treasure

Tonight I’ve become the most dazzling precious treasure
I am treasured over all the earth
