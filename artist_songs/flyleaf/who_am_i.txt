I'm so glad to be here
This day has become sacred
I'm trembling with thankfulness
For all of this

Who am I
Who am I
That you have brought me
This far, this far
Who am I that you have brought me so far

All those years of spoiled complaining
I said its not enough
And you have forgiven me for everything
Everything
And you have given me everything
Oh its too much, its too much
You're too much, you're too much

Who am I
Who am I
That you have brought me
This far, this far
Who am I that you have brought me so far

Who am I
Who am I
That you have brought me
This far, this far
Who am I that you have brought me so far
