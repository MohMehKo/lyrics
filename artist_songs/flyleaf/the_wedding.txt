Take my hand, let's try and stretch the tide we're dancing in
In the sand, waves rushing over where the shore begins
I place my hand beneath the water as it slips away
And looking up, I try and trace the sky in gorgeous shades

All dressed up for the wedding of the sun and the emerald sea
Feel your breath over me, travelling on the salty breeze
In this place forever, but it's always escaping me
All dressed up for the wedding forever

Falling sand from the hourglass inside my head
I warm my hands and start to feel the winter closing in

All dressed up for the wedding of the sun and the emerald sea
Feel your breath over me, travelling on the salty breeze
In this place forever, but it's always escaping me (Feel your breath)
All dressed up for the wedding forever (In this place forever)

All dressed up for the wedding of the sun and the emerald sea (Forever)
Feel your breath over me, travelling on the salty breeze (Of the sun and the emerald sea)
In this place forever, but it's always escaping me (Feel your breath, in this place, in this place, forever)
All dressed up for the wedding forever (But it's always escaping me)
All dressed up (Forever)
