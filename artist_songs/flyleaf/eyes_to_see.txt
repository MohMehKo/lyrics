I want you to know that I see
All the reasons why you fail
I've seen all your motivations
Ones for good and ones for hell

When you close your eyes to see
The truth that's inside me
May you hold your breath to breathe
Your empty reality

If you had eyes to see
Down inside your stomach
Then you would understand
What I mean 
Who I am
Who I am

I was pouring out of passion
To light the step you're on
You choose not to hear or waken
All thats left is you alone

When you close your eyes to see
The truth that's inside me
May you hold your breath to breathe
Your empty reality

If you had eyes to see
Down inside your stomach
Then you would understand
What I mean 
Who I am
Who I am

You can't limit me
With all your gross mistakes

If you had eyes to see
Down inside your stomach
Then you would understand
What I mean 
Who I am
Who I am
