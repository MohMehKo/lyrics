[U2 Cover]

Green light, seven eleven
You stop in for a pack of cigarettes,
You don't smoke, Don't even want to,
hey now, check your change
Dressed up like a car crash
The wheels are turning but your upside down
You say when he hits you, You don't mind
Because when he hurts you, you feel alive
Oh, is that what it is

Red lights, gray morning
You stumble out on a whole in the ground
A vampire? or a victim? It depends on whose around
You used to stay up to watch the adverse,
You could to lip sing to the talk shows.
And if you look, you look through me,
And when you talked, its not to me
And when I touch you, you don't feel a thing

If I could stay, then a night would give you up
Stay, and the day would keep its trust
Stay, and the night would be alive
Far away, So close
Up with the static on the radio
With satellite, television
You can go any where
Miami, New Orleans, London, Belfast, and Berlin

And if you listen I can call
And if you jump, you just might fall
And if you shout I'll only hear you

If I could stay, then a night would give you up
Stay, and the day would keep its trust
Stay, with the demons you drowned
Stay, with the spirit I found
Stay, and the night would be alive.
Ohohohoh
Ohohohoh
Ohohohoh
Ohohohoh
Three o' clock in the morning
It's quiet and there's no one around.
Just a bang and a clatter,
As angel runs to ground.
Just a bang and a clatter,
As angel hits the ground.
