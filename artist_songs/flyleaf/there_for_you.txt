Sometimes I'm a selfish fake
You're always a true friend
And I don't deserve you
'Cause I'm not there for you
Please forgive me again

I wanna be there for you,
Someone you can come to
Runs deeper than my bones
I wanna be there for you
I wanna be there for you

Swirling shades of blue
Slow dancing in your eyes
The sun kisses the earth
And I hush my urge to cry, cry

I wanna be there for you,
Someone you can come to
Runs deeper than my bones
I wanna be there for you
I wanna be there for you

'Cause I hear the whispered words
In your masterpiece beautiful
You speak the unspeakable thought
I love you too

I wanna be there for you,
Someone you can come to
I wanna be there for you,

And be
Someone you can come to
The love
It runs deeper than my bones
The love

I wanna be there for you.
