The question asked in order to save her life or take it.
The answer 'No', avoiding death and 'Yes' would make it.

'Do you believe in God?' written on the bullet.
Say 'Yes' to pull the trigger and my sister, Cassie, pulled it.

They didn't love their lives so much as to shrink from death.
Inspired in their footsteps we will march ahead.
Don't be shocked that people die.
Be surprised you're still alive.

All heads are bowed in silent reverence.
The floor is wet with tears of sorrowful remembrance.
The alter's filled with hearts of repentance.
Perfect love kills all fear.
Rejoice in this deliverance!

They didn't love their lives so much as to shrink from death.
Inspired by their footsteps we will march ahead.
Don't be shocked that people die.
Be surprised you're still alive.
