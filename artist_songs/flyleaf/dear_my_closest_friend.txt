Dear my closest friend 
I'm writing because 
I miss you so much 
At night I always cry 
The stillness still reminds me 
Of when we first fell in love 
And I miss that so much 
Dear my closest friend 

Dear my closest friend 
I remember when 
You asked me to stay 
And I just walked away 
I apologize 
I hope my letters sent 
I lost that moment [x2]
Seconds at a time [x2]
I wait for your answer 
But I already know 
Your hand was always mine [x3]

Dear my closest friend 
I'm writing because 
I miss you so much
