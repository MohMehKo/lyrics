Lewis said there plainly seems to be
Moral standards in humanity
And this all makes perfect sense to me
Except we can't keep them can we

We are all guilty
Not being all we should be
Look at your own self and see

His voice cut through the war in my head
Screaming something I could understand
And somehow we knew me when He said

Is there anyone who's desperate
For anything more than this
I'm the anyone who's desperate
For anything more than this

We are all guilty
Not being all we should be
Look at your own self and see
We are all guilty
I am so guilty

Nobody move
I want that person to hear me
Yes, I'm talking to you
If you don't believe then
Lift up your arms
Open your hands
Receive
I’m free
I’m free
