Aren't we all trying to become something better?
Oh, whoa, don't you know
Every time you take my hand, I become someone better
Oh, whoa, don't I know

Come spend the night inside our soul
It's so beautiful, at all
The howling wolves between my ears
Go silent when they hear you call

My darkness fades away
If you speak, I hear you call
Not just the words you say
And now I'm feeling oh so happy

Aren't we all trying to become something better?
Oh, whoa, don't you know
Every time you take my hand, I become someone better
Oh, whoa, don't I know

Come spend the day, watch the sunshine play
Off the light that's in your eyes
A lonely bird chirps a cheerful word
As he floats across the sky

My darkness fades away
If you speak, I hear you call
Not just the words you say
And now I'm feeling oh so happy

Aren't we all trying to become something better?
Oh, whoa, don't you know
Every time you take my hand, I become someone better
Oh, whoa, don't I know

She said, "Don't forget the person you are"
Seem to remember chasing falling stars
Up until you found me lying on the ground and whispered

Aren't we all trying to become something better?
Oh, whoa, don't you know
Every time you take my hand, I become someone better
Oh, whoa, don't I know

Aren't we all trying to become something better?
Oh, whoa, don't you know
Every time you take my hand, I become someone better
Oh, whoa, don't I know
