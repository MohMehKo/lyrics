Her headaches
Constant
Increasing in pain with each passing day
She can't even manage to stand on her own
It's gotten so bad

Now you think of saying
There's no use in praying
Still she bows her head so she can say,
"Thank you for just one more day."

Supernatural patience
Graces her face
And her voice never raises
All because of a love
Never let go of
Never let go of

He has every reason to throw up his fists
In the face of his God who let his mother die
Through all the prayer and tears
She still passed in pain anyway

Now you think of saying
There's no use in praying
Still he bows head so he can say,
"Thank you for ending her pain."

Supernatural patience
Graces his face
And his voice never raises
It's all because of a love
Never let go of
Never let go of

He is teaching me
What love really means

Supernatural patience
Graces his face
And his voice never raises
It's all because of a love
Never let go of

Yes it's supernatural patience
Graces his face
And his voice never raises
All because of a love
Never let go of
Never let go of

He is teaching me
What love truely means
