Pour the wine 
Light revives 
Lowering walls that divide 
Kings and Queens yearn to seek 
Love in all its mystery 

When all we wanted was love, 
We got cut up and burned 
But there's a light in your eyes 
And it tells me 
That God is on our side 

The waning moon 
Your sweet perfume 
Incense for the Holy Ones 
Secret hymns pour from your lips 
Healing for this broken soul 

We'd drive late 
And let the music tell our fate 
For me this is heaven 
Drown our fears 
And we may age 
If we do not die today 
Until then we'll let 
This music be our prayers 

When all we wanted was love, 
We got cut up and burned 
But there's a light in your eyes 
And it tells me 
That God is on our side 

And all we need now is love 
We've been through enough 
We can't run just 'cause we're scared 
We've come this far 
We're not giving up 
All we need now is love 
We've been through enough 
We can't run just 'cause we're scared 
We've come this far 
We're not giving up 

And all we need now is love 
We've been through enough 
We can't run just 'cause we're scared 
We've come this far 
We're not giving up 
And all we need now is love 
We've been through enough 
We can't run just 'cause we're scared 
We've come this far 
We're not giving up
