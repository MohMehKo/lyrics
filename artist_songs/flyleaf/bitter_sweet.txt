The depth of my soul in the depth of your voice
With words I've tried to find since I have been alive
This whole world stopped when you spoke

Your grieving stabs me, I've lost you too
Just hearing your love is never enough

Bittersweet embrace
Fit or run in place
Don't leave me so thirsty
Or else hush this hurry
Weight on me
Weighs more than me
So wait with me and we'll stop crying

The pent up flood gates maintained in your tone
Though its all we can give, it isn't where we live
Through dim reflection we know

The depth of my soul in the depth of your voice
With words I've tried to find since I have been alive
This whole world stopped when you spoke

Bittersweet embrace
Fit or run in place
Don't leave me so thirsty
Or else hush this hurry
Weight on me
Weighs more than me
So wait with me and we'll stop crying

You're a revolutionary
Bittersweet love
You're a revolutionary
Bittersweet love

Bittersweet embrace
Fit or run in place
Don't leave me so thirsty
Or else hush this hurry
Weight on me
Weighs more than me
So wait with me and we'll stop crying
