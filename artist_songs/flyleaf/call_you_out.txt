How can you act like you know
 When all you know is to lie?
Another truth to expose,
Freedom will capture their eyes.
We find this truth
 We fight. You lose.

Your time’s up now.
 That’s enough now.
Shut up, get out! 
Truth called you out.

I know this language of yours --
I used to speak it so well.
 A fire meant to be pure
Is now the fire of Hell.
It is written 
Long before you.

Your time’s up now. 
That’s enough now.
Shut up, get out! 
Truth called you out.

I hear your claims,
And I know your name;
 I hear your claims,  
And I know your name:

Liar.
 Liar.

Your time’s up now. 
That’s enough now.
Shut up, get out! 
Truth called you out.

Your time’s up now. 
That’s enough now.
Shut up, get out! 
Truth called you out.
