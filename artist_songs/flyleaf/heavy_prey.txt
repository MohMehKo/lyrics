Who sent me here
Betrayed by your kiss,
Hurry finish,
You wasted your chance, I'm provoked,
So I bleed till it is finished,
And I prove that my gifts have revoked,

And I won't repent from this, I won't repent from this,
Blood is binding,
Love you were meant for this flesh, you were meant for this life,
By dying,
I won't repent from this I won't repent from this,
Blood is binding,
Love you were meant for this flesh, you were meant for this love,
You're my flesh and blood [x3]

You'll never feel at home,
Anywhere, anywhere you go,
And when you sit around,
All your questions they start to grow,
They won't give you any answers,
And they lie about what they don't know,

But I won't repent from this, I won't repent from this,
Blood is binding,
Love you were meant for this flesh, you were meant for this life,
By dying,
I won't repent from this, I won't repent from this,
Blood is binding,
Love you were meant for this flesh, you were meant for this love,
You're my flesh and [Whispers] blood, blood, blood...

You only know my heart when it's cold,
But it burns when I hear my affliction in your voice,
Don't you see all my soul that is yours?
When you stand in the truth,
Upholding you

I won't repent from this, I won't repent from this,
Blood is binding,
Love you were meant for this flesh, you were meant for this life,
By dying,
I won't repent from this, I won't repent from this,
Blood is binding,
Love you were meant for this flesh, you were meant for this love,
You're my flesh and blood [x2]
You're my flesh and BLOOD
