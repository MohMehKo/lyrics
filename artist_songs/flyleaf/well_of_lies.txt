Walking in the dark
Narrow hallways all I see
The static in my heart is bringing out the worst in me

All I need is what you've given me
All I need is what you've given me

Don't let me slide
Slip down this well of lies
It's dark inside
Inside this well of lies!

I look up to the light and feel the sky is opening

I need a steady heart to even out the frequency

All I need is what you've given me
All I need is what you've given me

Don't let me slide
Slip down this well of lies
It's dark inside
Inside this well of lies!

Walking in the dark
Narrow hallways all I see
The static in my heart is bringing out the worst in me

Don't let me slide
Slip down this well of lies
It's dark inside
Inside this well of lies!

Don't let me slide
Slip down this well of lies
It's dark inside

Come set me free tonight!
