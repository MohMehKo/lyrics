We can't be oblivious
We are not ignorant

Blood in our hearts
Blood on our hands

We're human
We reason
We're breathing
Protecting
You're living and dying, surviving, we're trying
To breathe in safety
Come home safely

Mercy screams its violent love
Justice..
And mercy
Justice..
And mercy
The death of us created for
Justice..
And mercy
Justice..
And mercy
This is where they kiss

Life, here sacrificed
Someone who payed the price
Blood in our hearts
Blood on our hands
We cry out, we're fighting, it's warfare, we're dying
Believing we're winning, it's ending, we're singing
It's already done
We've overcome

Mercy screams its violent love
Justice..
And mercy
Justice..
And mercy
The death of us created for
Justice..
And mercy
Justice..
And mercy
This is where they kiss

With a life on the line (the fire..)
That consumes or refines (the fire..)
To ascend or decline
To retreat or to climb
Out of sight, out of mind
'til attacked from behind
Will this fire..
Consume or refine?

Mercy screams its violent love
Justice..
And mercy
Justice..
And mercy
The death of us created for
Justice..
And mercy
Justice..
And mercy
This is where they kiss
