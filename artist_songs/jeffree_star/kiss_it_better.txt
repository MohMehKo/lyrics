Tell me what you're made of; I'm made of innocence too
What you're afraid of, I'll make it disappear
Beautiful scars don't last forever, c'mon let me kiss it better
The pain won't last forever, c'mon let me kiss it better

You're perfect the way you are, I wanna hold your suffering in my arms
They're talking and they're talking but they make no sound
Whatever you do don't let them break you down
You're perfect, you're perfect, you're perfect
The way you are
You're perfect, you're perfect, you're perfect

They make you wanna self-destruct, and become someone else
When it feels like it's too much, baby don't hurt yourself
Beautiful scars don't last forever, c'mon let me kiss it better
The pain won't last forever, c'mon let me kiss it better

You're perfect the way you are, I wanna hold your suffering in my arms
They're talking and they're talking but they make no sound
Whatever you do don't let them break you down
You're perfect, you're perfect, you're perfect
The way you are
You're perfect, you're perfect, you're perfect
Don't you see? Don't you see? You're P-E-R-F-E-C-T
Don't you see? Don't you see? You're P-E-R-F-E-C-T
Don't you see? Don't you see?

You're perfect the way you are, I wanna hold your suffering in my arms
They're talking and they're talking but they make no sound
Whatever you do don't let them break you down
You're perfect, you're perfect, you're perfect
The way you are
You're perfect, you're perfect, you're perfect
The way you are
You're perfect, you're perfect, you're perfect
The way you are
You're perfect, you're perfect, you're perfect
You're perfect, you're perfect, you're perfect
The way you are
You're perfect, you're perfect, you're perfect...
