If I can't be beautiful.. I'd rather just die.

So self-obsessed with my mascara and mistakes. 
Vanity's like a funeral an everyone's at my wake. 
Before I run out of air there's more makeup to apply. 
Doll eyes stare into Valium colored skies... 

I gotta sweet tooth and strawberry youth. 
You wanna be my licorice and misguided truth. 
And right now - I'll show you how.. I'm a beauty killer.  

Rhinestone my eyes closed and please fix my hair. 
This concealer can't hide all my pink nightmares. 
Before I run out of air there's more makeup to apply. 
Doll eyes stare into Valium colored skies. 

I almost died but it felt great.
Faking perfection wasn't worth the wait.
I may be easy, easy to hate.
But you're so fucking easy.. easy to break.

I gotta sweet tooth and strawberry youth. 
You wanna be my licorice and misguided truth. 
And right now - I'll show you how.. I'm a beauty killer.

Tell me your secrets and ill tell you my lies.
Everything is monotone in my dead eyes.
If I cant be beautiful..I'd rather just die.
I'm a beauty killer.

Gorgeous killer.
Hot pink killer.
Fierce killer.
I'm a beauty killer.
I'll fucking kill you...
