Your love is dripping down my body
Mouth to mouth, so sweet like candy

Every day you're gone, I start to disappear,
Melting like ice cream, I need you here
So tasty, donâ€™t waste me!

Unwrap me to the floor,
So crazy, amazing,
Don't stop just give me more.

I love you always forever
Near and far, closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything I will do for you

I love you always forever
Near and far, closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything I will do for you

Your lips are feeling so icy,
Go down and start to paralyze me

And underneath this shiny surface,
You make me feel so fucking perfect!

Cherry cola through my veins
A love rush straight to my brain
So crazy, amazing,
Don't stop just give me more.

I love you always forever
Near and far, closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything I will do for you

I love you always forever
Near and far, closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything I will do for you

...I will do for you
...I will do for you

Let's put our lips together (MUAH)
And hold hands forever.
Let's put our lips together
And hold hands always and forever.

I love you always forever
Near and far, closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything I will do for you

I love you always forever
Near and far, closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything I will do for you
