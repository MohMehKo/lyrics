It's not your birthday but bitch we gotta celebrate
Gonna make you scream like-like-like we're soul mates

As I lay you on the floor (I know it's not what you expected)
But I know we can't ignore (We've got a sick connection)
Oh it feels so right (Let me be your new obsession)
Just let go
I'm here to take your virginity, slow
Show you my ability, whoa
Take your virginity, slow
I got no apologies, no
I-I-I I got no apologies, no
I got no apologies, no
I got no apologies, no
I-I-I I got no apologies, no

There's nothing we can say
Tell me where we got away
Sweatin' with anxiety
On-on-on the first date

As I lay you on the floor (I know it's not what you expected)
But I know we can't ignore (We've got a sick connection)
Oh it feels so right (Let me be your new obsession)
Just let go
I'm here to take your virginity, slow
Show you my ability, whoa
Take your virginity, slow
I got no apologies, no
I-I-I I got no apologies, no
I got no apologies, no
I got no apologies, no
I-I-I I got no apologies, no
