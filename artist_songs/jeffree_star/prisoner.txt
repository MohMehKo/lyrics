I got no regrets and I remember the day that we met...
There was no way that I could forget you.
So I followed you home and I waited til you were alone...
And I crept into your room while you slept..
I laid next to you.. and I knew that I could never let you go...

I know this seems so wrong.
But I'm just a love sick criminal.

You can arrest me baby, I don't wanna leave.
Lock me up, throw away the key.
I don't care if I'm in trouble deep, I'm addicted to your love.
I'll be your prisoner... I'll be your prisoner tonight.
I, I ,I - I'm under your spell and I just can't get enough.

You woke up to me... Staring at you in your sleep.
Like a deer in the headlights I couldn't see...
Anything else but the way you breathe...
And you screamed at the top of your lungs...
You couldn't believe it.. you thought you were dreamin'...
I knew, I never wanted you to let me go..

I know this seems so wrong.
But I'm just a love sick criminal.

You can arrest me baby, I don't wanna leave.
Lock me up, throw away the key.
I don't care if I'm in trouble deep, I'm addicted to your love.
I'll be your prisoner... I'll be your prisoner tonight.
I, I ,I - I'm under your spell and I just can't get enough.

Oh, I'm prepared for all the consequences...
Believe me, I have the worst intentions.
Oh, I'm prepared for all the consequences...
Believe me, I have the worst intentions.

Never let you go...
