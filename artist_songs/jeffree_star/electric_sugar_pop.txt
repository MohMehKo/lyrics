There's a party going down on a Saturday night.
In the limo windows down, baby I'm quite a sight. 
Don't be jealous of what I got, not everyone can be this hot...
And all the pink lips, fingertips, skinny dips and ego trips, that your money can buy.

It's deliciously naughty.
Feel a shock to the body.
It's electric sugar pop. 
Your heartbeat's racin' with anticipation. 
I'm electric sugar pop.
Gumdrop, lollipop take a lick and don't stop. 
So sweet such a treat, I'm the king of candy. 
It's so sugary sweet... I'm electric sugar pop pop pop. 

Feel the energy around me it's such a rush. 
Lemme tell ya, Oh, Hush! makes me blush. 
Cotton candy and champagne, that keeps us in the game. 
Yeah I'm a princess, a hot mess, a tiger in a short dress. 
Let's party tonight. 

It's deliciously naughty.
Feel a shock to the body.
It's electric sugar pop. 
Your heartbeat's racin' with anticipation. 
I'm electric sugar pop.
Gumdrop, lollipop take a lick and don't stop. 
So sweet such a treat, I'm the king of candy. 
It's so sugary sweet... I'm electric sugar pop pop pop. 

You know I'm everything that you ever wished for.
I'm on top all the time don't even keep score.
I'm sweet as honey and I know you have a taste for...
This sugar pop's poppin on the dance floor.
Poppin on the dance floor.
Pop pop pop pop.
Poppin on the dance floor.

It's deliciously naughty.
Feel a shock to the body.
It's electric sugar pop. 
Your heartbeat's racin' with anticipation. 
I'm electric sugar pop.
Gumdrop, lollipop take a lick and don't stop. 
So sweet such a treat, I'm the king of candy. 
It's so sugary sweet... I'm electric sugar pop pop pop.
