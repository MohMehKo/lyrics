Life vest hang it up I go under water, go down, go down, go down, down, go, go, go
Seatbelt take it off car crash until I black out, black out, black out, out, go, go, go
Do or die dare devil I’m obsessed til’ I get you I’m in cardiac arrest
Pedal to the fuckin’ metal I’m never slowin’ down, slowin’ down

Yes I confess I've been lovin’ you half to death
See I’mma get you take you make you make you mine even even if it kills me (If it kills me)
My heart’s jumpin’ out of my chest and I’mma want you til’ my dying breath
See I’mma get you take you make you make you mine even even if it kills me (If it kills me)

Oh, oh, oh...
If it kills me
Oh, oh, oh...
If it kills me

Parachute closed up dive right into your love, your love, your love
Blind fold on the floor uncensored I’m hardcore, hardcore, hardcore
Do or die dare devil I’m obsessed til’ I get you I’m in cardiac arrest
Pedal to the fuckin’ metal I’m never slowin’ down, slowin’ down

Yes I confess I've been lovin’ you half to death
See I’mma get you take you make you make you mine even even if it kills me (If it kills me)
My heart’s jumpin’ out of my chest and I’mma want you til’ my dying breath
See I’mma get you take you make you make you mine even even if it kills me (If it kills me)

I’m love-drunk so wa-walk the line
If you do the crime baby I’ll do the time
On a tight rope I’d risk my life
I’d self-destruct fuck myself up baby

Yes I confess I've been lovin’ you half to death
See I’mma get you take you make you make you mine even even if it kills me (If it kills me)
My heart’s jumpin’ out of my chest and I’mma want you til’ my dying breath
See I’mma get you take you make you make you mine even even if it kills me (If it kills me)

[2x]
Oh, oh, oh...
If it kills me
Oh, oh, oh...
If it kills me
