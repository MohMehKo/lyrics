Oh my fucking god
OH MY GOD!
OH – MY – GOD

I was touched by Jesus at the S&M party
God made it rain a thousand shots of Bacardi
Me and Mother Mary kissin' on Katy Perry 
All the angels sing "come and lick my body"

If you know you look good, repeat after me
Oh my G-O-D – I'm so sexy
The whole damn club wants to drug me
Oh my G-O-D – I'm so sexy
The whole damn club wants to fuck me

Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh My God [4x]

It feels like heaven when you're dripping down
I'm legendary, give me my crown
Hi Miley Cyrus you're gagged and bound
Shut the fuck up, don't make a sound

If you know you look good, repeat after me
Oh my G-O-D – I'm so sexy
The whole damn club wants to drug me
Oh my G-O-D – I'm so sexy
The whole damn club wants to fuck me

OH My Fucking God...

Let me show you how to sit on that dick
America's Next Top Model “click click”
I'm the ringleader, girls follow my trends
Got Hannah Montana doing anal with my friends
Lick on my body like a jolly rancha
Get so wet Sea World comin' atcha (atcha, atcha)
Be me Home Depot, now give me some tools
Maybe you can scuba dive into my pool
You need a psycho bitch like me
Mike Tyson bites so Rihanna looks like me
You need a pretty bitch like me
Meghan Fox loves French kissing me

If you know you look good, repeat after me
Oh my G-O-D – I'm so sexy
The whole damn club wants to drug me
Oh my G-O-D – I'm so sexy
The whole damn club wants to fuck me
