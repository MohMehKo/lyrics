The director yells cut but the cameras still rollin'.
This is my life and you can't fast forward it. 
You wanna stop... 
You wanna top all the charts. 
It's a wrap... it's a wrap...  it's a wrap...  it's a wrap... 

Queen supreme and barbie teen dreams. 
Every things not always what it seems. 
Christian Dior and haute couture.
It doesn't look good when your dead on the floor.

If your famous your hot -  always something your not.
So keep on fucking but you'll never reach the top.
If your famous your hot -  thank god for Photoshop.
So keep on fucking but you'll never reach the top.

It's a wrap... it's a wrap...  it's a wrap...  it's a wrap... 

Sew up your self esteem, it's fantastic.
Your body can't move, paralyzed and plastic. 
Being real is so sarcastic. 
When your dead, you'll be airbrushed in your casket.

If your famous your hot -  always something your not.
So keep on fucking but you'll never reach the top.
If your famous your hot -  thank god for Photoshop.
So keep on fucking but you'll never reach the top.

It's a wrap... it's a wrap...  it's a wrap...  it's a wrap... 

To be a star you gotta lick it, suck it...
You gotta sell it, live it, work it... 
Show the world what you're made of
