[Intro]
I want
A love
So good.
So good that it'll make me sick.
To touch,
But I need it.
You are the love to my Cobain,
Blood to my blade.
And you're no good for me baby, no good.
You are the pin in my grenade, can't pull you away.
And you're no good for me baby, no good.
Give me kisses again.

[Verse 1]
Never going to quit my addiction.
And I like it, keeps me so conflicted.
And I like it even when you hate it,
La da da...
Take it up a notch I might need stitches.
Keep it dirty just like Sid Vicious.
I know you want to lick my delicious.
Da da da...

[Chorus]
You are the love to my Cobain,
Blood to my blade.
And you're no good for me baby, no good.
You are the pin in my grenade, can't pull you away.
And you're no good for me baby, no good.
Give me kisses again.
You are the love to my Cobain-ain-ain-ain-ain!
Kiss me again-gain-gain-gain-gain!
You are the love to my Cobain-ain-ain-ain-ain!
Give me kisses again-gain-gain-gain-gain!

[Verse 2]
Tie me up, don't need no restrictions.
You can take it all with such conviction!
I kind a wish that we could switch positions!
La da da...
Take it up a notch I might need stitches.
Keep it dirty just like Sid Vicious.
I know you want to lick my delicious.
Da da da...

[Chorus]
You are the love to my Cobain,
Blood to my blade.
And you're no good for me baby, no good.
You are the pin in my grenade, can't pull you away.
And you're no good for me baby, no good.
Give me kisses again.
You are the love to my Cobain-ain-ain-ain-ain!
Kiss me again-gain-gain-gain-gain!
You are the love to my Cobain-ain-ain-ain-ain!
Give me kisses again-ain-ain-ain-ain!

[Bridge]
I want
A love
So good.
So good that it'll make me sick.
To touch,
But I need it.
Don't tease or I'll bleed.
Uh-oh.
Don't tease or I'll bleed.
Yeah.
Don't tease or I'll bleed.
Yeah.
Don't tease or I'll,
Don't tease or I'll,
Don't tease or I'll bleed.

[Chorus]
You are the love to my Cobain,
Blood to my blade.
And you're no good for me baby, no good.
You are the pin in my grenade, can't pull you away.
And you're no good for me baby, no good.
You are the love to my Cobain-ain-ain-ain-ain!
Kiss me again-gain-gain-gain-gain!
You are the love to my Cobain-ain-ain-ain-ain!
Give me kisses again-ain-ain-ain-ain!
