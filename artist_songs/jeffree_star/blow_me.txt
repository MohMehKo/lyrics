Oh-oh 
I'm in the club
On some blackout 
I can't even stand
Bartender's serving
While the ice is melting in my hand
Under the circumstance 
Might be a change of plans
Show me the way to the floor
So I can Dance-dance-dance

Seven inch heels bout to break my back
Hot shit Glamorous
Sweat drips Mac
Bitches who hate can kiss my flesh
Now it's time to undress

Put your drinks up if you don't give a fuck
Everything goes cause we don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck!
You don't give a fuck!
We don't give a fuck-fuck-fuck-fuck

Blow Me 
Faggot
Faggot
Faggot
You fucking fag-fag-fag-fag
Faggot
Faggot
Faggot
Use a fucking Fag Fag

So coming up on Patron
It's tasting hella good (umm)
Stare at my style
I'm fucking wild
Talk shit! I wish you would
I'm so amazing! Check my status
Watch the numbers grow
Turn on you're T.V.
Check the channel
It's the Jeffree show!

Seven inch heels bout to break my back
Hot shit Glamorous
Sweat drips Mac
Bitches who hate can kiss my flesh
Now it's time to undress

[Instrumental]

Put your drinks up if you don't give a fuck
Everything goes cause we don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck!
You don't give a fuck!
We don't give a fuck-fuck-fuck-fuck

Blow Me 
Faggot
Faggot
Faggot
You fucking fag-fag-fag-fag
Faggot
Faggot
Faggot
Use a fucking Fag Fag
Faggot

You fucking fag-fag-fag-fag
