Fashion it bores me
Sick repetition floors me
But I wear it
And I am it
And it hurts
Music plus fashion
Two words that help me cash in
All you faggots on the dance floor make it work

So all you knock off fakes
Best be putting' on the brakes
Design disasters really have no chance
Commencing with a show down
You simply need to slow down
Cuz I hate music baby
But let's dance

I hate music baby
But let's dance!
I hate music baby
But let's dance!

People they copy
Imitations never stop me
Cuz I live it
And I know it
And it hurts
Music plus Fame
Synonymous with my name
All you bitches on your sidekicks get it first

So emulate and salivate
Get in line and wait
Turn your television on and catch a glance
Sucking on your ring pop
You really need to just stop
Cuz I hate music baby...
But let's dance

I hate music baby
But let's dance!
I hate music baby
But let's dance!
[X2]
Fast forward, rewind
Pause, play, stop
Fast forward, rewind
Pause, play, stop

I hate music baby
But let's dance!
I hate music baby
But let's dance!
