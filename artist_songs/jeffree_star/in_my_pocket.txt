You gimme, gimme, gimme love and I dropped it
You gimme, gimme, gimme love but I lost it

Where'd it go?

Left, right, left, retrace my steps
I swear I had it right here and these things just so disappear
Back and forth, I break a sweat
Promise I guard it with my life, so much for do or die

Everything now means nothing to me, I got for keepsaking
A killer without someone I break into pieces
And while I never learn my lesson
You'll be no exception

You gimme, gimme, gimme love and I dropped it
I think I got a hole in my pocket
You gimme, gimme, gimme love but I lost it
I think I got a hole in my pocket

Where'd it go? All over the world
What about the window?
You gimme, gimme, gimme love and I dropped it
I think I got a hole in my pocket

I been, I been looking round, oh oh
I been, I been looking round, oh oh

High and low, I'm searching
I look for the faces that I know; maybe they'll take me to you
Run and play so I'm going nowhere
I end up where I start, right back at your broken heart

Everything now means nothing to me, I got for keepsaking
A killer without someone I break into pieces
And while I never learn my lesson
You'll be no exception

You gimme, gimme, gimme love and I dropped it
I think I got a hole in my pocket
You gimme, gimme, gimme love but I lost it
I think I got a hole in my pocket

Where'd it go? All over the world
What about the window?
You gimme, gimme, gimme love and I dropped it
I think I got a hole in my my my..

Slipping right through my fingers, oh I can't believe it
It's all just happening so fast
So answer me this, what if I can fix it?
Would you give me another chance?

And could I hold a little love?

You gimme, gimme, gimme love and I dropped it
You gimme, gimme, gimme love but I lost it

Where'd it go?

You gimme, gimme, gimme love and I dropped it
I think I got a hole in my pocket
You gimme, gimme, gimme love but I lost it
I think I got a hole in my pocket

Where'd it go? All over the world
What about the window?
You gimme, gimme, gimme love and I dropped it
I think I got a hole in my my my..

I been, I been looking round, oh oh
I been, I been looking round, oh oh

Where'd it go, oh oh?
