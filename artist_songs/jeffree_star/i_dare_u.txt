My childhood was so fun, bein' ignored
So many scars, I look like a cutting board
My dad looks like Kurt Cobain, mom's an alcoholic
You gotta love it, eh, you gotta love it, eh

The apple never falls too far
Yeah I'm a fuckin' star!
I rise above it, I rise above it, eh

Strap in and enjoy the ride
It's more fun if you risk your life

So I dare dare dare you to love me
Never survive
Still I dare dare dare you to love me
I hope you make it out alive

Going over your head
Six feet down, oh yeah
So I dare dare dare you to love me
Love me, I dare you

I never met Jack Daniels but I love takin' pills
Grandma left me razor blades, to kill myself in her will

My dad looks like Kurt Cobain, mom's an alcoholic
You gotta love it, eh, you gotta love it, eh

The apple never falls too far
Yeah I'm a fuckin' star!
I rise above it, I rise above it, eh

Strap in and enjoy the ride
It's more fun if you risk your life

So I dare dare dare you to love me
Never survive
Still I dare dare dare you to love me
I hope you make it out alive

Going over your head
Six feet down, oh yeah
So I dare dare dare you to love me
Love me, I dare you

So I dare dare dare you to love me
Never survive
Still I dare dare dare you to love me
I hope you make it out alive

Going over your head
Six feet down, oh yeah
So I dare dare dare you to love me
Love me, I dare you
