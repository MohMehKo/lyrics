Tell me who's watching me..

Every day there's camera's flashin'
I hide behind dark sunglasses
Everyone wants to take a shot
Cuz nobody has what I got
Steppin out on the scene
Living life in a magazine
A million eyes I can't avoid
In limousines I'm paranoid

I always feel like somebody's watchin' me
And I have no privacy
I always feel like somebody's watchin' me
Tell me is it just a dream?

The star in my eye is dying
Flashbulbs always blinding
My lipgloss is shining
But that look is lying
Fake smiles, let's pretend
Everyone acts like they're my friend
Build up, knock down, that's the trend I'm not buying it That's why..

I always feel like somebody's watchin' me
And I have no privacy
I always feel like somebody's watchin' me
Who's playin' tricks on me?
I always feel like somebody's watchin' me
Tell me is it just a dream?

Step back!
Stop an stare
There's people everywhere..
I don't care Stop an stare

[Chorus repeats until end]
