Uhm, hey Porcelain?
Yeah, baby?
Excuse me but...

I got no regrets and I remember the day that we met
There was no way that I could forget you
So I followed you home and I waited till you were alone
And I crept into your room while you slept
I laid next to you and I knew that I could never let you go

I know this seems so wrong
But I'm just a love sick criminal

You can arrest me baby, I don't wanna leave
Lock me up, throw away the key
I don't care if I'm in trouble deep
I'm addicted to your love
I'll be your prisoner
I'll be your prisoner tonight
I, I, I - I'm under your spell and I just can't get enough

You woke up to me staring at you in your sleep
Like a deer in the headlights I couldn't see
Anything else but the way you breathe
And you screamed at the top of your lungs
You couldn't believe it
You thought you were dreamin' I knew
I never wanted you to let me go

I know this seems so wrong
But I'm just a love sick criminal

You can arrest me baby, I don't wanna leave
Lock me up, throw away the key
I don't care if I'm in trouble deep
I'm addicted to your love
I'll be your prisoner
I'll be your prisoner tonight
I, I, I - I'm under your spell and I just can't get enough

I'm gonna make your love sticky and tasty
Come on put your hands in dirty places
I'm gonna hold your heart and fucking break it
Undressing slowly baby show me you're tasteless

I'm gonna make your love sticky and tasty
Come on put your hands in dirty places
I'm gonna hold your heart and fucking break it
Undressing slowly baby show me you're tasteless

Jeffree Star and Porcelain
Being fuckin' whores again

You can arrest me baby, I don't wanna leave
Lock me up, throw away the key
I don't care if I'm in trouble deep
I'm addicted to your love
I'll be your prisoner
I'll be your prisoner tonight
I, I, I - I'm under your spell and I just can't get enough

I'll be your prisoner tonight
I'll be your prisoner tonight
I, I, I - I'm under your spell and I just can't get enough
