Star
I'm a fucking star

I got my hair fixed, make-up done, ready to go
Step in the club and you know I'm the show
Diamonds in my teeth are always a-glow
Blinded as I speak, mesmerized by my flow

You can't say "No"
So let's go
Let's go

Spit on the dance floor to know where you are
Slip to the beat 'cause you wanna go far
(you love, and I love) that I'm Jeffree Star
Spit on the dance floor to know where you are
Slip to the beat drivin' in my pink car
(you love, and I love) Jeffree Star

Cameras are flashing
Everyone's asking,
What I'm gonna do tonight,
Who I'm gonna do tonight?

We have our haircut, eyes shut, already there
I don't know their names an I don't really care
'Cause I only suck dick and just to be fair,
You're not on the menu, you'll never compare

You can't say "No"
So let's go
Let's go

Spit on the dance floor to know where you are
Slip to the beat 'cause you wanna go far
(you love, and I love) that I'm Jeffree Star
Spit on the dance floor to know where you are
Slip to the beat drivin' in my pink car
(you love, and I love) Jeffree Star

I'm a fucking star
I'm a fucking star
I'm Jeffree Star
Hair cut, diamonds
I'm Jeffree Star
Eyes shut, make-up done, ready to go

Spit on the dance floor to know where you are
Slip to the beat 'cause you wanna go far
(you love, and I love) that I'm Jeffree Star
Spit on the dance floor to know where you are
Slip to the beat drivin' in my pink car
(you love, and I love) I'm Jeffree Star

Spit on the dance floor to know where you are
Slip to the beat 'cause you wanna go far
Spit on the dance floor to know where you are
Slip to the beat 'cause you love Jeffree Star (love Jeffree Star, love Jeffree Star)
(Jeffree Star)

Cameras are flashin',
Everyone's askin'
What I'm gonna do tonight,
Who I'm gonna do tonight,
What I'm gonna do tonight?
Ask Paris Hilton who I'm gonna do tonight.
