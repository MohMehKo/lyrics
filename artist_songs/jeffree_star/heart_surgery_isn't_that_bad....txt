[Jeffree laughs]

I dont think
I don't think you're ready for this..
Here we go..

Pink diamonds shining
Fuschia lust
Heart-shaped bruises
For both of us

You see me watching
The lights are low
Your body's waiting
You can't say no

[pre chorus:] [x2]
Let me show you how it works.. 
(Lets get out of here)
Let me show you how it works, I like it hard..

[CHORUS:]
Come on.. Let's get out of here
I wanna take your hand and disappear
Come on.. Let's get out of here
I whisper in your ear.. "I wanna..."

You like it fast.. 
I like it hard
You like it fast
I like it hard
You like it fast
I like it hard
Fag!
Bitch!

Mirrors are breaking
Vanity crush
Perfection climbing
All eyes on us

We both stop breathing
The music fades
Hands start touching
Don't be afraid..

[pre chorus] [x2]
Let me show you how it works.. 
(Lets get out of here)
Let me show you how it works, I like it hard..

[CHORUS]
Come on.. Let's get out of here
I wanna take your hand and disappear
Come on.. Let's get out of here
I whisper in your ear.. "I wanna..."

You like it fast.. 
I like it hard
You like it fast
I like it hard
You like it fast
I like it hard
You like it fast
I like it [scream] hard

You like it fast.. 
I like it hard
You like it fast
I like it hard
You like it fast
I like it hard
You like it fast
I like it hard

[pre chorus] [x2]
Let me show you how it works.. 
(Lets get out of here)
Let me show you how it works, I like it hard..

[CHORUS]
Come on.. Let's get out of here
I wanna take your hand and disappear
Come on.. Let's get out of here
I whisper in your ear.. "I wanna..."

Uh............I Like It Hard............Uh.............I Like It Hard..............Uhhh
