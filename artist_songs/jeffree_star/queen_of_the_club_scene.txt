Now it's 2AM and the party pulls up. 
Now we're moving out to the city we love to go. 
I feel - I feel electrical. 
The lights so bright, you're looking magical in the city tonight. 

Tell me.. now that I can see your eyes, eyes on me...
Say my name J E F F R DOUBLE E.

Cuz I'm the queen of the club scene & they love me. 
Cuz I keep the bass turned up. 
It's beating on my heart strings and they all sing.
That they love the queen of the club scene.

And if you see me there when I walk on by.
I will come to you when the time is right. 
And if l like the way u look when the beat kicks in.
I will let you know as the DJ spins.

Now the club is hot and you're colder than ice. 
If you want a shot, better take it tonight. 
And if you see me there when I walk on by.
I will come to you when the time is right.
