MissBehavin with a stranger
I kinda like the danger
Don't get caught up in confusion
Fooled by the illusion

It's alright
If you shake it shake it ahh
All night, baby you and I
MissBehavin all night
Out of sight
Or we can do it in the spotlight

The first time that I saw you
I couldnâ€™t ignore you
Out on the floor
Over the top
I like your mister out of control style
It'll be fun for a while

It's alright
If you shake it shake it ahh
All night, baby you and I
MissBehavin all night
Out of sight
Or we can do, do it in the spotlight

Do it in the spotlight
In the spotlight
Do it in the spotlight
In the spotlight

Out of sight

Do it in the spotlight
In the spotlight
Do it in the spotlight
In the spotlight
