A little danger's never stopped me before...
Seduced by hypnotic eyes and a kiss to die for
Everything you do causes me pain...
Torture me with a smile, burning me with your flame

Yeah TURN IT UP, this f-f-f-fire inside
Yeah TURN ME UP, your body's a weapon tonight
You CUT ME UP, cut me up stab me straight through the heart
Don't you know I'm in love...

[Chorus:]
...with a killer, it's driving me wild
masochistic thriller, your my burning desire
Don't care if I make it out alive
K-k-killer, Love me til the day that I die

I taste blood every time that we kiss...
Get lost in your gaze when you're lickin your lips
I'm lyin' here, I'm holdin' my breath...
Can't wait for you to love me to death

Yeah TURN IT UP, this f-f-f-fire inside
Yeah TURN ME UP, your body's a weapon tonight
You CUT ME UP, cut me up stab me straight through the heart
I'm madly in love...

[Chorus:]
...with a killer, it's driving me wild
masochistic thriller, your my burning desire
Don't care if I make it out alive
K-k-killer, Love me til the day that I die
K-k-killer
K-k-killer
K-k-killer
K-k-killer

[Bridge]
You can stab my heart a million times
I'll still lick up the blood and smile
You can stab my heart a million times
Cuz I know that I'm to ready die...

I'm madly in love...
...with a killer, it's driving me wild
masochistic thriller, your my burning desire
Don't care if I make it out alive
K-k-killer, Love me til the day that I die
K-k-killer
K-k-killer
K-k-killer
K-k-killer
