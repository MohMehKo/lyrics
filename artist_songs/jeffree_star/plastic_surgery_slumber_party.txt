Vinyl black stilettos
and fake eyelashes
Blue eye shadow
everything perfectly matches

Touch my plastic face
and see what happens
I'm hiding from the world
behind Chanel sunglasses

"Do I look fat?"

Limo tinted lipstick secrets
Knife thin can you see us?
Crushed diamonds dollar bills
In my purse is every pill

Fake smiles, tabloid tasteless
Pretty Porsche an Fendi facelifts
Plastic noses, mannequin poses
Expensive clothes, my face is froze

plastic parts
broken hearts
masterpiece
scalpel please

Pink razors, so vain
Let's have a sexy party
Nose jobs and champagne
Sounds like a fuckin' party

Let's have a sexy party
Nose jobs and champagne
Sounds like a fuckin' party

Pink sherbet, popsicle lips
Perfection is - tucks an nips
Collagen pumps an lipo-ed hips
Hollywood glamour lipgloss tricks

Surgery scars an beauty marks
Botox amusement parks
Pagant parade suicide past
Beauty will never last

Pink razors, so vain
Let's have a sexy party
Nose jobs and champagne
Sounds like a fuckin' party

Pink razors, so vain
Let's have a sexy party
Nose jobs and champagne
Sounds like a fuckin' party

Don't touch me...
Just fix me...
Don't touch me...
Just fix me...
Don't touch me...

Don't touch me...
Just fix me...

Nose jobs and champagne

Pink razors, cocaine
Sounds like a LA party
Rockstars are so lame
Sounds like I'll hate that party
