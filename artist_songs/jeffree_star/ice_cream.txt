I'll give you Dairy Queen
Pink dreams
Tongue all on your ice cream
Lips gleam
Plates clean
Preteen
Submarine

Drippin' down your ice cream cone
Rhinestone.. hormones

Enter my construction zone
Make me moan
Danger prone
Enter my construction zone
Make me moan
Danger prone

It doesn't feel right
So keep going down
It doesn't feel right
Until you start to drown

I wanna S your D
I wanna L your V

Gonna guarantee
To set you free

Sliddin' down the pole
Swallow it whole
Flood control
Always on patrol
Let's take a stroll
Into your hole
On cruise control
Now pay the toll

I want.. .
Pants dropping, slow fucking, floor mopping..
Right now.

Enter my construction zone
Make me moan
Danger prone
Enter my construction zone
Make me moan
Danger prone

It doesn't feel right
So keep going down
It doesn't feel right
Until you start to drown

Jeffree Star for dinner?
I'll give you Jeffree Star for dinner

It doesn't feel right
So keep going down
It doesn't feel right
Until you start to drown

Open up your thighs
Show me the surprise
