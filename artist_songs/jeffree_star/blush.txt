[Chorus:]
Cover me in blush, I'm a sugar rush
So sinful with my stare, like a millionaire
Cover me in cream, handle me with care
I'm in your every dream, so love me if you dare 

It's so bizarre that you wanna be a star, 
when everyone who is; just doesn't quite fit in
But if you wanna make it to the very top
then you gotta get with me, I will show you how it feels
It-it-it's gonna take every inch of your skin, every bone, every limb... 
Do you really wanna know?
You bought a Louis that you saw in a movie, 
You just wanna go far I can take you there

If you can treat me right... I can show you the way... 
I'll let you play with me. 

[Chorus:]
Cover me in blush, I'm a sugar rush
So sinful with my stare, like a millionaire
Cover me in cream, handle me with care
I'm in your every dream, so love me if you dare

Let me take you to Chanel, cuz you look like hell
Give a pretty smile now you're easy to sell
Fix you up & fix you down - lets hide your scars, 
Cuz the world will start to play you like a guitar 
Now its time to brush your hair, pretend that you care, 
[Just don't melt in the spotlights glare]
Don't you know, life's so grand? 
I'll steal your man; while you're doing drugs with Lindsay Lohan

If you can treat me right, I can show you the way... 
I'll let you play with me. 

[Chorus:]
Cover me in blush, I'm a sugar rush 
So sinful with my stare, like a millionaire 
Cover me in cream, handle me with care 
I'm in your every dream, so love me if you dare

(La la la, la la la, la la la, la la la, la la la, la la la, la la la, la la la...)

Shut your mouth & lets just try to make you look more beautiful
Smoking crack with Britney Spears, yeah that's just the usual...
It's not my fault the Jonas Brothers all took turns fucking me
Life's a bitch, say you're sorry... lick my ass on MTV

[Chorus:] 
Cover me in blush, I'm a sugar rush 
So sinful with my stare, like a millionaire 
Cover me in cream, handle me with care 
I'm in your every dream, so love me if you dare

(La la la, la la la, la la la, la la la, la la la, la la la .....)
