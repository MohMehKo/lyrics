You're a slave to my long eyelashes.
You're not cranked but you're in agony. 
Loving me is iridescent confliction. 
Poor thing, I know you're hungry. 

Cuz I'm fresh meat, in vintage Dior. 
Stealing from the rich, and giving Gucci to the poor.
I've got advice for you: I've got everything you need.
You know if you want to be thin you shouldn't eat anything but fresh meat. 

Fresh meat, fresh meat, fresh meat.

I'm a...a walking weapon in a shotgun shack and. 
I'm a butcher's masterpiece. 
Dance bitch, trip the light, fantastic.
Split my skin and make me bleed. 

Cuz I'm fresh meat, in vintage Dior. 
Stealing from the rich, and giving Gucci to the poor.
I've got advice for you: I've got everything you need.
You know if you want to be thin you shouldn't eat anything but fresh meat. 

Fresh meat, fresh meat, fresh meat.

Bake me, eat me, throw me up.
Buy me, touch me I'm a fuck up.
Entertain me, carve me up...
Penetrate my heart.

Cuz I'm fresh meat, in vintage Dior. 
Stealing from the rich, and giving Gucci to the poor.
I've got advice for you: I've got everything you need.
You know if you want to be thin you shouldn't eat anything but fresh meat.

Fresh meat, fresh meat, fresh meat.
