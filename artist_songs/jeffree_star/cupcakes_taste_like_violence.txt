My hair looks like cotton candy
My heart is made of sequins
Blow pops an meat cleavers
Give me something sweet

My skin looks like vanilla
My mouth is made of sugar
Syringes and cupcakes
Give me something sweet
I'm good enough to eat, oh yeaaah..

You can't stop... staring at me
You can't stop... I'm good enough to eat
You can't stop... sticky sweet..
You can't stop...
You can't stop... staring at me
You can't stop... I'm good enough to eat
You can't stop... sticky sweet..
You can't stop...

My makeup looks like rainbow sherbet
My brain feels like hard candy
Gashes an sundaes
Give me something sweet

Lipstick like pink bubble gum
Heart like a snow cone
Jawbreakers an morphine
Give me something sweet
I'm good enough to eat, oh yeaaah..

You can't stop... staring at me
You can't stop... I'm good enough to eat
You can't stop... sticky sweet..
You can't stop...
You can't stop... staring at me
You can't stop... I'm good enough to eat
You can't stop... sticky sweet..
You can't stop...
