You taste like heaven baby
A brand new craving lately
Surround me - I'm drowning
Let me hit this - so delicious

You make me feel..
So fierce
You make me feel..
So fierce

Take it off - take it off
Don't stop - don't stop
Take it off - take it off
Don't stop - don't stop

You're my prescription baby
I'll take you... now take me
Outlast me - I'm crashing
Heartsick passion - forever lasting

You make me feel..
So fierce
You make me feel..
So fierce

Take it off - take it off
Don't stop - don't stop
Take it off - take it off
Don't stop - don't stop

You're so sweet but you gotta know something
I want it, need it gotta gotta have it my way
You're so sweet but you gotta know something
I want it, need it gotta gotta have it my way
You're so sweet but you gotta know something
I want it, need it gotta gotta have it my way
You're so sweet but you gotta know something
I want it, need it gotta gotta have it my way

Take it off - take it off
Don't stop - don't stop
Take it off - take it off
Don't stop - don't stop
