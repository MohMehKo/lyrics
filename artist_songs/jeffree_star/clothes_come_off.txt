Did you know that I get paid to be me?
I go to clubs and I party for free.
'Cause I do what I want,
And I do it real good...yeah.

No mistake, it's about to get served
I'm sippin'cups while I flip a couple birds
Then I'm on my way, 
Goin' in head first... yeah.

I've seen some shit. 
Been around the world.
I spread like fire!
You're gonna know it's good,
I can take, I can take this to the next level!

It's not a party 'til my clothes come off!
I said it! (He said it.)
I'll do it! (He'll do it.)
I'm seeing triple and my face feels numb,
It's official! (Go on girl!)
This is a good time...

It's not a party 'til my clothes come off!
I said it! (He said it.)
I'll do it! (He'll do it.)
I'm seeing triple and my face feels numb,
It's official! (I love it!)
This is a good time...

When I go out I go out in style
Haters can hate [?]
Super-cala-frad-u-listic-expialla... Gorgeous!

Hold my drink while I pour a cup for... free.
I triple fist like white Jet Li
I know how to fight, for my right to party...

Yeah, I love this shit.
Never get sick of it.
It's hot like fire...
You're gonna know it's good,
I can take, I can take this to the next level!
