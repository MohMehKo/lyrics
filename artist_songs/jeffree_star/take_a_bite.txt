I stay out all night and sleep all day
And when the sun goes down, I'm ready to play
A rush to the head and now you're infected
I'm dead, its time to get ressurected

I wanna taste you wherever, whenever
Me and you can do this forever
Lickin my lips, its you that I'm cravin
Give me my fix, I'm misbeahavin

I get rowdy when I'm out all night
If you get too close, I'm gonna bite
Dancing like the worlds gonna end
Nothing scares me..
(I think I have a bloody nose)

Now baby let me be your vampire
I can be your vampire
Let me be your vampire..
So I can suck on you

You know I've got my eyes on you
Get you in a trance from across the room
I can make you mine and I know that you want me
Once I start you wont be able to stop me

I wanna taste you wherever, whenever
Me and you can do this forever
Lickin my lips, its you that I'm cravin
Give me my fix, I'm misbeahavin

I get rowdy when I'm out all night
If you get too close, I'm gonna bite
Dancing like the worlds gonna end
Nothing scares me..
(I think I have a bloody nose)

Now baby let me be your vampire
I can be your vampire
Let me be your vampire..
So I can suck..

I got the bad words to make your clothes fall off
I got the bad words to make your clothes fall off

I get rowdy when I'm out all night
If you get too close, I'm gonna bite
Dancing like the worlds gonna end
Nothing scares me..
(I think I have a bloody nose)

Now baby let me be your vampire
I can be your vampire
Let me be your vampire..
So I can suck on you
