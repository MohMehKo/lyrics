I wake up in the morning
Ain't got no time to chill
I got to get my cash right
I have a new rollie
And my diamond looks like a flashlight
This morning you can do
When they ask me what's the price
I've come to die
Our bank is screwed
And all we do
Donuts are still swanging too
So it's served in my bladder
The thug say they miss me
The thug says it's history
If you want to show me love
I just don't along with scrubs
They push me tryin' to get that cush
Your bitch can't take it
Pull a wire and then get it

I ran out of money
Out of hoes
If your bitch gets shows
Then she got to go
I'm giving you all my calm, diamonds and gold
If your bitch gets shows
Then she got to go

It's a hell of a night
I live a hell of a life
I know what the fuck I want
Whether is wrong or right
Stay high as a cop
Get drunk as a skunk
Me and my hoe buy a house like it's the first of the month
Bad bitch in my bed
You can have this world homie if it gets you separated
Never thought of parties
Empty bottles in our hands
And we drink them like they're [?]
I am from overseas
I never howl baby
And do it with ease

I ran out of money
Out of hoes
If your bitch gets shows
Then she got to go
I'm giving you all my calm, diamonds and gold
If your bitch gets shows
Then she got to go

Tell your bitch I was gonna get it
And what the fuck I do?
I know you see me
I know you shinning bitch
