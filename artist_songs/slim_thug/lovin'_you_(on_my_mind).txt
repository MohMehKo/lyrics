Lovin' you is cool, but getting money is the only thing that's on my mind
I don't know what to do but hustle I've been living on the street if I'm not on my grind
I'm doing the best I can, I need you to understand to be on my side
It's a hell of sacrifice, I'm chasing this cash for life
It's a long, long ride

It's a long ride, a lot of lonely nights
Might be a lot of fuckers, for I finally get it right
G, shit I hope I'm worth it, cause shit, you ain't perfect
All them Gucci and Louis purses, I hope you deserve it!
Stay down, only weak bitches lay down
We can't afford to just walk away from this pay now
I'm shipping shit through Greyhound taking all kind of chance
To be locked up, but you rocked up living in many mansions
All life gotta get it if it's good
Niggas who get lazy end up back in the hood
If I lost it all, I probably lose you
So if it's paper on the table, I can't chose you

Lovin' you is cool, but getting money is the only thing that's on my mind
I don't know what to do, but hustle I've been living on the street if I'm not on my grind
I'm doing the best I can, I need you to understand to be on my side
It's a hell of sacrifice, I'm chasing this cash for life
It's a long, long ride

Oh, if my pockets on flat, I can't enjoy you, baby
Doing anything without running to me, it's just annoying, baby
I know you love looking at that satellite TV
Them other niggas shit off, you'll have to look at them DVDs
If you ain't trying to hold your hand and take a walk in the park
I really get my hustle on, so we don't have to talk in the dark
And fuck a repo, I ain't give up my Bentley like that
I'll be god damned if I let the recession pimp me like that
If I go to jail it's bail money
It's your red bottom, it's Channel money
Plus the mortgage, fuck more deal money
You smell good, but I'd rather smell money
I-10 it's a football field, and I swear Imma runnin' back
So sit the fuck down and wait for me to come back with that money, babe

Lovin' you is cool, but getting money is the only thing that's on my mind
I don't know what to do, but hustle I've been living on the street if I'm not on my grind
I'm doing the best I can, I need you to understand to be on my side
It's a hell of sacrifice, I'm chasing this cash for life
It's a long, long ride

Uh, I don’t wanna be just news, baby
I wanna be the hot topic
Eat lobster every day of my life, what the hell is a hot pocket?
Catch your case it's all good, I hide your kid, shape up, now they got to drop it
Come home, keep fucking you until you say,
“Z-Ro, you got to stop it!”
When I’m done I’m back, I’m back, right back on my grind
Like YG I got racks on racks on racks right back on my mind
You’re living lavish, you love that shit
Cause you was broke before, you rode that dick
So I hope you learned how to love that brick
Cause without that bitch we wouldn’t be shit
Shit, without these licks, you wouldn’t be shit, no red bottoms
Bragging to your friend about how you got them
Different pair every time they spot them
Taking trips, first class flights
It’s getting hard, but I love my life
I’mma make sure my money right
Grind all day and I grind all night
Like drive around in foreigns and vacate when it’s boring
Touring the town like I’m a tourist, sipping on drink 'til you see me snoring
I sleep good, since I’m out the hood
I eat good in these streets (streets)
So I’m gonna get this paper, I’ll be back next week, Bye!
