It's Slim Thugga Muthafucka, got alot to sell
But snitches already got alot to tell
So for as y'all know all I do is just rap (huh)
And give these streets something they can play in they trap (cheyah)
Last year I had to put my city back on the map
This year we goin hit em right back with a slap (that's right)
I had the whole wide world tippin' on 4's (fo's)
Sippin' on drank, using gland slow
Claiming they the boss I guess they like my style
Copy what I do, mayne they like my child
I'm listen like damn mayne them boys wild
Thinking to myself, mayne them boys loud
Writing everything from my slang to my smile (damn)
Thought I was goin let it slide... Hell Naw!
If the shoe fit very, listen tot he comparey
You niggas ain't my fam, how I style you in hared

I call all shots, all wins no losses (no losses)

The only rapper doing everythang I say
The other boys fishing (ha), go up their and Christians (ha)
I'm a good dude I just gotta alot addiction (that's right)
I love getting money you can see it in my face
It's like I'm bout to bust when I step my safe (cheyah)
I love getting pussy but I hate these hoes (I hate these hoes)
I'm bout to hit the block and -drop the top on 4's-
I know you probably tired of hearing about my cars (I know)
That's what'cha get for turning good niggas to stars (that's what'cha get)
What the fuck you'll do, you'll see
Never had shit now you rich as you can be (what)
Used to hit Lick's selling bricks in the streets (ha)
Now I'm selling hits for ten times the fee (ha ha)
And stand free, I ain't never seeing no jails
