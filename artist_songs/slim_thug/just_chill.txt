Just chill hoe. Be still hoe. 
I'm working wood real slow, why my grill glow. 
She say she on the pill though. 
And I'm puffin kush by the pillows, 
wrapped up with cigarillos. 
So hell yeah, nigga still throwed. 
Rolled eighty-fours, fresh to the bones. 
When I'm on the road slap so cold. 
Drank poured, I'm a syrup-aholic. 
Watch the crib when those po is crawling. 
Was broke but now I'm balling. 
Used to cap but now they calling. 
She's ready to ride, ain't no stalling. 
Her and her friend, yeah they all in. 
She shotgun on my shotgun, I blast off and mash off. 
Took em to the pad on that note, 
gave em something they can brag about. 
Thug boss, toe tag em out. 
Kill em, make em feel it. 
She say she tired of y'all fake niggas. 
She wanna ride with the realest.

Got your mind on nympho. 
So let me beat your tempo with your mental. 
Pimp pimp string roll.

Cause I'm stuck to play, keep the list super fly like. 
You don't know what you in for. 
So stop and roll and pour fours, susta sucka shucka. 
Creepin bean, how you lane,

Don't shake, do it under these things. 
Run, get the fuck out my ride. 
See here ain't a one time thing. 
Be grateful that I let you slide. 
And not your friend, and not your pot nigga.

But she at the top now bitch and back.
