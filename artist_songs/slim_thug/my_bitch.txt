[Chorus] 
My bitch been down when I wasnt shit 
She keep it 100 dont switch 
Cause dats my bitch 
Gave me a safe place for the bricks 
Even help hit a couple licks 
So she still my bitch 
Gotta help a nigga get rich 
Get pop she aint never gone snitch 
Yea dats my bitch 
Go hard she aint never gone quit naw 
She as real as a bitch get 
Cause dats my bitch 

[Verse 1] 
I got a down bitch I can ride around wit 
From the hood I can smoke me a pound wit 
Keep it g she aint wit all dat bullshit 
But got her own money far from a groupie bitch 
She a dime all round players want to save her 
Dey tell her thugga aint gonna love ya, fuck haters 
She still by my side she say she cant stand lames 
She say her pussy aint for sell you can keep the change 
As far as I can tell its a keeper man 
Aint tryna argue wit ya baby let you do you 
Got me trippin like its too good to be true 

My bitch been down when I wasnt shit 
She keep it 100 dont switch 
Cause dats my bitch 
Gave me a safe place for the bricks 
Even help hit a couple licks 
So she still my bitch 
Gotta help a nigga get rich 
Get pop she aint never gone snitch 
Yea dats my bitch 
Go hard she aint never gone quit naw 
She as real as a bitch get 
Cause dats my bitch 

[Verse 2] 
Been my number one fan before I got a deal 
Got a job still keep me wit a hot meal 
Baddest bitch I ever met, you gotta see her 
Fine as red wine & pretty as aaliyah 
All da hoes hatin on her cause dey want to be her 
Can tell I got love for her dey see how I treat her 
She say she down to ride for & I believe her 
Im gettin love shit I think I got a fever 
Never thought id see the day wen I fall in love 
Got plenty ? but she da only one im thinkin of 
Keep my blunt rolled, clothes ironed for the club 
She a down ass bitch for real cuz 

[Chorus] 
My bitch been down when I wasnt shit 
She keep it 100 dont switch 
Cause dats my bitch 
Gave me a safe place for the bricks 
Even help hit a couple licks

Get pop she aint never gone snitch 
Yea dats my bitch 
Go hard she aint never gone quit naw

[Verse 4] 
I go to jail I dont even make it to the cell 
Im in process she already makin bell 
Always on time shit it never fells 
She rite behind a nigga cleanin up my trail 
Through all my day to day shit its hard to live without her 
A nigga be lookin lost wheneva I aint got her 
& dem girls betta watch wat dey say 
Tryna start shit cause my bitch dont play 
She'll scratch never running from a match 
Bitch get to talkin reckless she'll put her on her back 
On top of dat she stay ready to get it 
At any givin minute I can hit it 
Cuz dats my bitch 

[Chorus] 
My bitch been down when I wasnt shit 
She keep it 100 dont switch 
Cause dats my bitch

Even help hit a couple licks

Gotta help a nigga get rich 
Get pop she aint never gone snitch 
Yea dats my bitch 
Go hard she aint never gone quit naw 
She as real as a bitch get 
Cause dats my bitch
