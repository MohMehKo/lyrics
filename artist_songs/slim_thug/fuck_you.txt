[Slim Thug:]
As is, I aint changing for you suckers
if you aint fucking with me, fuck ya
and if you aint feeling how I feel, fuck ya
you bitches aint paying my bills, so fuck ya
I'mma boss, how bout low, ride out for the clique
or you can ride with us or eat a sick dick
I tell it how it is, them niggas speak fiction
I gotta keep it real, that shit is an addiction
so open up ya ears, all ya gotta do is listen
then everytime you see me, I'mma pull the description
if I say I got a Bentley than that bitch outside
if I say the watch 50, ask my Jeweler if I lie
Thug boss bitch

[Chorus:]
I don't give a fuck, if I do it's fuck you
if you don't like what a nigga do, fuck you
that shit you niggas talking aint true, fuck you

I don't give a fuck, if I do it's fuck you
if you don't like what a nigga do, fuck you
that shit you niggas talking aint true, fuck you
we got our money right nigga, what you wanna do

[Lil Wayne:]
I don't give a fuck, if I do, it's fuck you

life on the edge, I want my jumpsuit
my hoes keep their mouth closed like they suck glue
Weezy in this bitch, Thugga I got ya
I'm all up in they face like the fucking eye doctor
fuck with me wrong turn ya brains into pasta

young money shit, you gon need some artillery
science class nigga, me and money got chemistry

[Chorus:]
I don't give a fuck, if I do it's fuck you
if you don't like what a nigga do, fuck you
that shit you niggas talking aint true, fuck you
we got our money right nigga, what you wanna do
I don't give a fuck, if I do it's fuck you
if you don't like what a nigga do, fuck you
that shit you niggas talking aint true, fuck you
we got our money right nigga, what you wanna do

[Slim Thug:]
Aint no punchlines in my rhymes I'm like this and like that
its just 36 lines of straight facts
okay I take that back, 36 lines of crack
now thats a brick hard nigga can you buy that
try that
is that shit that you rap about real?
okay tell me this, how many niggas you done killed?
Okay, tell me this, is your clique really trill
or you just get gassed on, these pay the bills
the niggas tell the truth what would they be saying
be caught up in the streets and be like I was just playing
thats why they get robbed or set up for the slam
I'ma be me even when I'm verse laying

[Chorus]
