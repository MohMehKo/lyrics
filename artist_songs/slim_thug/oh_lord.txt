From back then till now
Oh Lord (Oh Lord)
Real niggers never changes outr ways keep it 100
That's why you see me in every hood in my city and
Some stunting Rowe fore lack rowe whatever I want to roll
I sell that shit back if I don't like it
I'll take it back and get something like it
Keep new nike's on my feet pocket full of greens
As a matter of fact I only smoke papers
Bitches say they love thugg
But I gave all them slick ass hoes the vapors
They be trying to blow papers thinking a nigger gonna fall
For the trap bitch you gotta ball
And all ya'll niggers talk big but
That shit you smoking be small
Starting like smoking a blunt don't fuck with a hoe they frontin like
Still hit the club every week and they hoes coming right
Heading to the fifth tonight nigger got about 20 bitches
Hit the live got too drunk threw away all my riches
Should have kept it in my pocket now I miss all them dick heads
And I can't name another rapper in my city that did what I did
Spend you mother fucking week at the jail
Bring clothes for your haters that's trying to close me
And bitch I'm the boss and all ya'll broke mother fuckers
Right here going to buy me
Pull up in something clean like a King
You know every year that's how we gonna do it
I know they mad because of their bitch
And I'm still shining just trying to get use to it
Cause I've seen a lot come and I see a lot go but I still shine
Trying to get the boss out the gang but you still going to hold it down
You can't do it all the time but I ain't going back to jail
I'm the boss and I belong in a million dollar house not no sale
Niggers trying to kill each other over bullshit
Man I ain't got no time or it
That why when they mess with my line I push in and empty it
All about my stacks if you ain't trying to chase money
Then move on with it that's why I left them niggers alone
While real hard I got to go get it
Either you down or you ain't
Ain't no in between nigger
And while you trying to get your life right
I'm a keep increasing these figures
All you niggers give a fuck about is getting high ain't doing shit
While what I give a fuck about is trying to get more rich
Never want to work never had a job never give a shit for life
So I'm a grind my ass out till my nigger looking damn super tight
Can't fall off can't fall off and I'm still broke
But it about that hood green you gotta move up
