We used to stand on the corner
Banging that UGK
If you see some things
Don't hesitate to send them on my way
I got a pocket full of stones
Diamonds against the wood
Stay right there when I was flippin' through my hood
Back then me and my nigga Z was sellin' that drank
We was sittin' on gallons, 400 of paint
Gettin' bank on Gov Bank ridin' drops down the ave
Since I was a child I had dreams of ridin' slabs
Couldn't see that far
Shit not even in my dreams, couldn't see that far
They say it ain't for the money
You might lie in the stars
Now look at me I'm living in the land of the stars
We all are in the hood and made brick houses
They seminate and collect it
When they trap it they rap it
I have to get done
We gonna make it happen

I'm ridin' to the finish line
I stay griming until dinner time
We ain't got jumping, start it I know
All that I know
All that I know
One pot until I fall out
I know these fuck niggaz
Fuck them it's all that I know

Nigga it ain't no hope for us
I see you skate and you're sober
Into my head shit is making my G
And if along my texts is all that they see
Don't fuck it boss, not half of it

So now we're flying
And that paper lookin' like stars
Far away we have polo shirts
Our dollar is up
You came outside and if your shit was missing
It was probably yours
Dinner table turn
A nigga the same time got a phone call
Then the hoe knew how to fuck
All the niggaz know the shit
The same thousand ain't shit
We're trying to get the meat
Start from the bottom until you hit the ceiling
Now my niggaz deal with it
Young legend and the fucking series
Seen it all back to the ball
Top down and then fuck them all

I'm ridin' to the finish line
I stay griming until dinner time
We ain't got jumping, start it I know
All that I know
All that I know
One pot until I fall out
I know these fuck niggaz
Fuck them it's all that I know
