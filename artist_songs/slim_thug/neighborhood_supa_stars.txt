[Chorus] 
Neighborhood supa stars 
It's them boys with the candy sprayed on their cars [x4]

[Slim Thug] 
Bitch you might not know me, but in my hood I'm famous 
I fuck the baddest bitches and hang with all the gangsters 
My SLABs is the meanest, my jewelery is the best 
You think I get close, freak, cause everyday I'm fresh 
And everybody know me, from young to the old 
Everywhere I go, they're like "Thugga, boy, you cold" 
They love to see me hit the club and ball out of control 
Pop the bottle after bottle til I fall out on the floor 
Surrounded by dro clouds, they be like "No smokin" 
I laugh at their bitch ass like "Ho, stop jokin" 
Keep some candy on them rims, that's pokin 
And everytime I hit the board I leave that ho broken 
Thug Boss, bitch 

[Chorus] 

[Yo Gotti] 
I'm a legend in my neighborhood 
Plus I'm connected and respected of in every hood 
Chrome on chrome, twenty racks under my... 
You see my name in that bitch, so get that understood 
I'm an outer space star, bitch I'm up in Mars 
And if you wanna talk money, I got all type of cards 
Just know I meant it, if I said it, nobody in my family got credit 
And if you got a million, I bet it 
Nigga, pockets on fredit, broken niggas... talkin loud 
In the club, but that bitch you... 
My jewelery too loud, my cars from overseas 
You tryin to book a show, that gon cost a couple ki's 
Cause, bitch, I'm Yo Gotti 

[Chorus] 

[Nipsey Hussle] 
Yeah, long money til I flatline 
We tryin to spend some cash, hit me on my batline 
I swear rappin 'bout my last grind 
Got me on a money marathon with no halftime 
When we hit the club, we walk ... 
You can come inside with us, if your ass fly 
Get cash, I cash ride 
I'm beatin all the competition by landslide 
Neighborhood supa star in my swag high 
Take a nigga bitch, put him on stand by 
And if he ever ask me hold my head high 
I'ma take a stand and tell a god damn lie 

[Chorus x2]
