[Chorus]
Poppin bottles in the ice, like a blizzard
When we drink we do it right gettin slizzard
Sippin sizzurp in my ride, like Three 6
Now I’m feelin so fly like a G6
Like a G6, Like a G6
Now I’m feelin so fly like a G6
Like a G6, Like a G6
Now I’m feelin so fly like a G6

[Slim Thug]
Step up in the club, fly as a G6
Lookup at my section, I got all the fly chicks
Smoking, sippin sizzurp getting high then a bitch
Keep the party poppin all night, don’t quit
Taking shot of that Patrone, shot’s of that jager
charge it to my card, we recycling our paper
I’m wasted, you wasted, we wasted
let me take you to my crib and get you butt naked!

[Chorus]
Poppin bottles in the ice, like a blizzard
When we drink we do it right gettin slizzard
Sippin sizzurp in my ride, like Three 6
Now I’m feelin so fly like a G6
Like a G6, Like a G6
Now I’m feelin so fly like a G6
Like a G6, Like a G6
Now I’m feelin so fly like a G6

[Slim Thug]
I’m 30,000 feet up in the air
This good weed got me higher then a Lear
I’m so wasted, I can’t even see clear
Just make sure these pretty woman stay there
I’m too crunk, cuz I’m too drunk
You know I’m wasted, if you see me hit the fist pump
I’m too thrown, cuz I’m too blown
But I stil ain’t stoppin, let’s gooo

[Chorus]
Poppin bottles in the ice, like a blizzard
When we drink we do it right gettin slizzard
Sippin sizzurp in my ride, like Three 6
Now I’m feelin so fly like a G6
Like a G6, Like a G6
Now I’m feelin so fly like a G6
Like a G6, Like a G6
Now I’m feelin so fly like a G6

[Dre Day]
Pass me that cliko, I got me 3 more
bitches they slizzerd, they giving me a peepshows
me so horny, I can go all night look at me storming
Stumbling falling out the door
I’m still screaming “I need more”
Now, where my ride
Eyes tight like stitches
still on my pimpin
now, where my bitches
Ow, there they go
It’s about to be a freaknik
Cuz we drunk and high like a, like a G6

[Chorus]
Poppin bottles in the ice, like a blizzard
When we drink we do it right gettin slizzard
Sippin sizzurp in my ride, like Three 6
Now I’m feelin so fly like a G6
Like a G6, Like a G6
Now I’m feelin so fly like a G6
Like a G6, Like a G6
Now I’m feelin so fly like a G6
