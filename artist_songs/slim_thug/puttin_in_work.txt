Ass so fat, pussy so wet. 
It's a workout baby, let me see you sweat. 
Got her busting back to back like a new chick. 
Putting in work like I'm trying to get a check. [x2]

First off the boss, freaks all the hunnies. 
Stunting, playboy bunnies, those for money.

She got a million dollar pussy, keep a player rich. 
Break the trick, then make the trick make me rich.

Took her to the tank and told her go and dive in. 
Beat it in the car like we at a drive-in. 
Keep her jazzy, tell them other niggas keep chasing. 
Then tell your lonely ass friends they need to quit hating. 
So amazing, yeah together we a dream team. 
I bust that pussy open, got her hooked like a fiend.
