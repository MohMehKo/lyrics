We the land of carnival and murder
Bring the drums and the sounding of thunder
Oh my people we got to get stronger
With the spirit of war in quilombos

Jungle people, jungle
Never underestimate our power
Jungle people, jungle
Never underestimate our power

Ah, loco
Bring the shit

Bring our roots we’re under the sun
From in the jungle and from the slums
Our freedom we bring with this song
Never forget where you came from

Jungle people, jungle
Never underestimate our power
Jungle people, jungle
Never underestimate our power

Bumba bumba
Bumba bumba
Bumba bumba

Oxossi open my way
I’m gonna tell the world what you say
I know God making me a way
We pray, we pray everyday

Jungle people, jungle
Never underestimate our power
Jungle people, jungle
Never underestimate our power

Bumba bumba
Bumba bumba
Bumba bumba

Ele e caboclo ele e flecheiro bumba na calunga
He is land’s owner he is archer
E matador de feiticeiro bumba na calunga
He is killer and witch
Ele vai firmar seu ponto bumba na calunga
He will assure his point
E vai firmar na angola
He will assure in angola
Bumba na calunga e na fe de oxala
Bumba in the calunga and in the faith in oxalá
Bumba na calunga he is archer
Ponto de coboclo sete flechas / t e p j da c

Bumba bumba
Bumba bumba
Bumba bumba
