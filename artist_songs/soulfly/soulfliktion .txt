The age of the rapture
Has fall upon us
Beyond the threshold
"Don't make me come down there"
Said God to the World
Humans got to prepare

Rise and fall - Inna Babylon
Flesh and bones - Obsession

Who would you die for? Who? Who?
Soulfliktion
Who would you kill for? Who? Who?
Soulfliktion
Who would you fight for? Who? Who?
Soulfliktion
Who would you rise for? Who? Who?
Soulfliktion

Skeptalepsy
Your soul's in penury
Dethroned sanctuary
Remember the sermon
The Crucifixion
The Crown of Thorns

Rapture visions - Enshrouding my eyes

Who would you burn for? Who? Who?
Soulfliktion
Who would you bleed for? Who? Who?
Soulfliktion
Who would you slay for? Who? Who?
Soulfliktion
Who would you pray for? Who? Who?
Soulfliktion

Evil will fall
Fallen Angel
Immortal covenant
Reaper's Scythe

Inner judgement
Red Sea opens
Moses trod on
Behold your soul
