Brainwashed zombies
Hypnotized by TV
Subhuman animosity
Shroud of insecurity
Downtrodden exploitation
Striving for perfection
Fear of rejection
Powers of deception

Fuck, Fuck reality
I say Fuck, Fuck reality
I say Fuck, Fuck reality
I say Fuck, Fuck reality
I say...

Infest your weak minds
Subconscious landmines
Reverse into decline
Dysfunctional life
I am the Epitome
Burden breaking the mold
Holy, the war
The living suffer

Fuck, Fuck reality
I say Fuck, Fuck reality
I say Fuck, Fuck reality
I say Fuck, Fuck reality
I say Fuck...

Infestation, Confrontation, Provocation
Planet dies
Incineration, Pacification, Regression
Mankind dies
Deception, Regression, Extinction
All of life
Subservience, Dominance, Negligence
Man must die

Brutalized, Sacrified, Sanctified
You will die
Holy War, Execution, Gas Chamber
Firing Squad

Slaves to be sold
Shackled to the bone
Broadcast noise pollution
Televised execution

Fuck, Fuck reality
I say Fuck, Fuck reality
I say Fuck, Fuck reality
I say Fuck, Fuck reality
I say Fuck...

Invented, Never repented
For the sins that killed my skin
