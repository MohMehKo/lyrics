Disciple Gods of cyanide
Bewailing my final demise
Forever engraved within
Enslaved by my apathy

Master of Savagery
Master....Savage

Dethroned the Master, cut his head
The veil of trust is shattered
Forcing social regression
The swallow's ostentation

Master Of Savagery
Master....Savage

New Age Dogma Darkened Forms
In this Hell beneath, I rot

Master of Savagery
Master....Savage

Certain is suffering
Morbid premonition
Obliterate ourselves
Toxic death corrosion
