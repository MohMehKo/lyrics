By ancient decree
I call upon thee
From the heavens
Asu - Shunamir
Ereshkigal, Queen of Hell
The seven gates of Namtar fell

Ishtar rising, Adonai... Ishtar
Ishtar rising, Adonai...

I the Equinox
The ancient law
The dead will rise up
The dead will come
Inhaling the incense of deity
Woe to Babylon
Woe to thee...

Ishtar
Ishtar rising
Ishtar
Ishtar rising, Adonai...
