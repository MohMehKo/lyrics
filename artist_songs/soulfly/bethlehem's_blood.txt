Chaldean - The Sacrosanct
Like pagan gods burning incense
Betrayal in Gethsemane
Fallen angels of perdition
Let it be written, let it be done...
And cut the flesh - Unholy One
Yerushalaim Nehereset
Jerusalem is falling... Falling

Let the streets flood with Bethlehem's blood
Let the streets flood with Bethlehem's blood

Inflict the hate - Odium of Cain
Like an abortion in the womb of pain
Baphomet or Belial
Threshold - Primordial
Let it be written, let it be done
Accuser of the blackened sun
Yerushalaim Nehereset
Jerusalem is burning... Burning...

On my command...

Let the streets flood with Bethlehem's blood
Let the streets flood with Bethlehem's blood

Die by my hand
May the blood descend again
Adonai - Jerusalem
Die by your hand
Execution in the holy land
Elohim - Jerusalem...
Amen...
