I like you
And I like this town
I mean you
And this wonderful town
I like you
You put a smile on my face

Ohmtown town it's my kind of place
I like the pace
I like the pace of this place
I like the style
I'd like to stay here a while
I like the birds
Singing in the trees
I like the girls
And they like me

The kind of town you can kick off your shoes
The kind of town can take away the blues
The kind of town we can all use
Ohm Sweet Ohm

Ohmtown it's my kind of place
Ohmtown you put a smile on my face
Ohmtown it must be love
Ohm Sweet Ohm

I like the pace
I like the pace of this place
I like the style

I like the birds
Singing in the trees
I like the girls
And they like me

The kind of town you can kick off your shoes
The kind of town could take away any blues
The kind of town we can all use
Ohm Sweet Ohm

Ohmtown it's my kind of place
Ohmtown you put a smile on my face
Ohmtown it must be love
