Words could never say it
words could never say it
I know now you're gone
and I can't go on

Where could you be tonight
I'm sayin' my sorry
baby I'm sorry

'Cause without your love in my life I'll die
I was wrong
I was so worng

And I'm so scared
what can I do now
when I close my eyes
all I see is you

Now words could never say it
words could never say it
if theres a reason why
say it's a lie

Words could never say it
how I feel now
now that you're gone
now that you're gone

Now that you're gone
we made it now
we made it love
we made such fools
of ourselves
we made it up now
you made it up oh yeah

you know you made it hard
we made it fast
I always thought
it would last
we took a bow
we did it all oh yeah

Words could never say
could never say
could only play
someone could say
would only playing with ourselves

Words could never say
how I feel now
some how
I've got find a way

cause when I dream at night alls I see is you
you're wantin' me
and me havin' you

Now words could never say it
words could never say it
everytime I try
I get lost inside
