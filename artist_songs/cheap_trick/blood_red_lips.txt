You don't know what it's like
To be with you, you've got no clue
I don't know how to fight
A love so real, a love so true

You're everything I want
You're everything I need, oh yeah
You're everything I want
You're everything I bleed, oh yeah

Blood red lips
Blood red lips
You just can't miss
You're blood red lips
Baby just one kiss

You got just what I like
And I want you, you know it's true
Come on, give me a bite
A kiss so real, they way you do

You're everything I want
You're everything I need, oh yeah
You're everything I want
You're everything I see, oh yeah

Blood red lips
Blood red lips
Just can't miss
You're blood red lips
Baby just one kiss

Blood red lips
Blood red lips
Just can't miss
You're blood red lips
Blood red lips
You just can't miss
Baby just one kiss
Baby just one kiss
