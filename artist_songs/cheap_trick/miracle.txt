Here comes the miracle
The one we've been waiting for
Here comes the miracle
It's time to open up the door

Oh, the miracle
My heart is beating fast
I can't seem to it slow down
It's too late to turn back
But it's not to late to turn the world round

Here comes the miracle
The one we've been waiting for, oh Lord
It's time to open up the door

Why am I shivering?
I can see him fading fast
For the first time I believe
That I can finally let go of the past

Here comes the miracle
The one we've been waiting for, oh Lord
Here comes the miracle
It's time to open up the door

Here comes the miracle
Here comes the miracle
Here comes the miracle
Here comes the miracle

Here comes the miracle
It's time to open up
It's time to open up the door
