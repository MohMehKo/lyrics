On the radio
I love the music
On the radio
It's what they're playing
When the radio's on and you
And me get crazy
Hey, mister on the radio
Please play my favorite song
The one where she didn't go away
Hey, mister on the radio
You're really my best friend
Please play my favorite song for me
Hey. mister on the radio
You're with me every day
And late at night i turn you on
On the radio
I love the music
On the radio
It's what they're playing
When the radio's on and you
And me get crazy
All of the rock and roll dj's
Got their fingers on the world
'cause they play the songs
That make you and me feel so good
Turn up your radios
And hear the music
On the radio
This song is playin'
When the radio's on
And you and me get crazy
Radio dj monologue:
One minute the back side of midnight
it's me captain gonzo ready to roll hot
wax anything you want to hear
All night its a balmy 73 degrees
in fog city, 71 in the valley 80 in santa cruz (?),
but remember if you snooze you lose
I'm gonna hang with you,
i'll crank it on...
so let me know what you want to hear
phone lines are open now
You say it you know 
i'm gonna play it and be ready 
to win when i tell you to call in and whatever you do
Remember the phrase that pays 
puts your brain on vacation 
and let your toes take over 
keep your pedal to the metal
I'll be back in sixty seconds, 
in the meantime go with it, 
go for it, go nuts, go completely wild.....
