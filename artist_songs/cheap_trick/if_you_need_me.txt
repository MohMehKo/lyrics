Girl it's all right if it's one of those nights and you need me
Swallow your pride there's nothing to hide, Do you need me?
Such a long long time I've been waiting for a sign Say you need me
I've been dreaming of the day when I hear you say, say you need me

[Pre-Chorus]
I believe in you, you believe in me but I can't feel it in my heart
So what's wrong with you, what's the matter with me 
And how come we're so far apart

[Chorus]
I can stand a little hurt and I can stand a lot of pain
We can work it out all right if you need me

Can we be serious can you and I keep a secret?
Hold it inside between you and I, Can you keep it?
Been thinking of a way just to get you to say, say you need me
Such a long, long time I've been waiting for a sign, say you need me

[Pre-Chorus]
I believe in you you believe in me but I can't feel it in my heart
So what's wrong with you, what's the matter with me 
And how come we're so far apart

[Chorus]
I can stand a little hurt and I can stand a lot of pain
We can work it out all right if you need me
And I just wanna let you know that we don't have to let it go
You know we can work it out all right if you need me
