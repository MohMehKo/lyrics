Hey now, what are you going to do
When the stars come shining for you?
Stay now, I know I had something to say
Can't you feel it low?
Listen now, for the melody has slipped away
But there's a song that lies in the dark
Like you and me, and all it needs is light of day

I get so sad and lonely
It hurts just to walk in the park
It's only when you're gone
I got to turn my radio on
So come on, let's sing me a song
You sing my blues away

Somehow I pulled you into my world
You're love has taken over me
And there's a girl there
That needs that light to see

Here she comes now, 
Like a summer rain
From an old time mystery
I let her sing her song
She's where I want to be

A sweet sound, that fills my world
Like an old float in my dream
But this old heart, I must say
There are no words to describe what you do, to me
You sing my blues away

I get so sad and lonely
It's long way home in the dark
It's only when you're gone
I got to turn my radio on
So come sing me a song
So come sing my blues away
Sing my blues away
Sing my blues away
