I, i can hear you laughing
You're a million miles away or you're here
I, i will never leave you
I'm a million miles away or i'm near
I, i', the thoughts you're thinking
But you're a lifetime away from your home or you're here
I, i can see you crying
You're a million miles away or you're here
Look at me like i look at you
Think of me like i think of you
Speak to me like i speak to you
Dream of me like i dream of you
I, i can hear you thinking
You're a million thoughts away
I, i'm the dreams you're dreaming
I'm a million dreams away or i'm here
We can go down slowly like the rain
I could leave and be with you again, oh
I could be your lover, let's pretend
