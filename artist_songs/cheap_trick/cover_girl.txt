Well the first time that I saw her it was 1979
Couldn't see her walk couldn't hear her talk
Still wish she were mine

I saw that face and saw that smile
And in a little while
I fell into a dream come true

[Chorus]
She's a cover girl
She lives in her own little world
I wish she was my girl
And her name was she's a cover girl
She's always in my dreams
She's never what she seems
In a fantasy world

The next time that I saw her it was on page 69
Biting her lips shaking her hips
You know she looked so fine

So I bought those books to get those looks
I could see her anytime
She's just like a dream come true

[Chorus]
