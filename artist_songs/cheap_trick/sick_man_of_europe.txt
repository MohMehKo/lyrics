This ain't the new, it's the old generation
It's all real, not a cheap imitation

Everything is good for me now
I don't want to work it all out
All I wanna do is get myself home

I'm a sick man of Europe
I'm a sick man, sick man of Europe

We ain't Haight or the British invasion
This ain't the Nazz, it's self-preservation

I don't want to work it all out
Everything is good for me now
All I want to do is get myself home

I'm a sick man of Europe
I'm a sick man, sick man of Europe
I'm a sick man of Europe
I'm a sick man, sick man of Europe
