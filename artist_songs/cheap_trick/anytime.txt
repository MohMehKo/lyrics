I hear voices inside my head
All of them just wanna talk to you
I can feel your imagination
Running wild deep inside- you know it's true
This won't be a test of your religion
You won't have to bang the bedroom walls
Can you really hold and keep a secret
I'll be right here anytime at all

Anytime you wanna call, call
Anytime you wanna come, come over
Anytime you wanna come, call
Anytime you wanna call, come over
Cause I need your love
I need your love
Cause I need your love
I need your love

Well no one thinks that love lasts forever
More than just a lonely day and night
Never thought about the perfect answer
But I've got a place where you can hide
I can feel your lips all around me
A wet kiss witing to explode

Anytime you wanna call, call
Anytime you wanna come, come over
Anytime you wanna come, call
Anytime you wanna call, come over
Cause I need your love
I need your love
Cause I need your love
I need your love
Cause I need your love
Everyone inside my head wants to talk to you
Cause I need your love
I need your love
I need your love

Cause I need your love
Cause I need your love
I need your love
Everyone inside my head wants to talk to you
Cause I need your love
I can't eat- I can't sleep
Gotta leave- nowhere to go
Hidin' out- oh,no- it's what I want
What you gonna do now
Cause I need your love
Yeah, I need your love
