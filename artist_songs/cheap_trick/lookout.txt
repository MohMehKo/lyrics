There is somewhere some place in this world.
I want to take you, look out, look out, look out.
I am one boy, one boy in a thousand that wants to make you
Look out, little girl, little girl, little girl look out.
Ahhh.

If you're hiding and I'm hiding
From some bum that wants to get you
Look out, look out, look out.
If you're lonely and I'm lonely
And I'm near you I can hear you.
Look out little girl, little girl, little girl look out.
Ahhh.

Sea over yonder when the rights are read your name, ah.
You search for the riddle to the clue to the river she came.
Look out on the land to the south, to the east three said, ah.
Cancel Colorado in the march by request.
Don't go on the lookout of a whim, aye she said.

There is somewhere some place in this world.
I want to take you, look out, look out, look out.
I am one boy, one boy in a thousand that wants to make you
Look out, little girl, little girl, little girl look out.
Ahhh.

Little girl, little girl, little girl.
Little girl!
