Goin' to a party, 
meet me on after school.
Well we're goin to a place 
where the jive is really cool.

And if the band stops a playin'
There's a jukebox down the hall.
And with your blue dress on, your folks all gone.
You're sure to give the guys a ball.

[CHORUS:]
Get that real guitar boy shakin',
I'm a California man,
Dance right on till the floors are breakin'
I'm a California man.

Well I rocked my mamma so bad
This a woman's she's a making me mad.
Well I don't care if her legs start aching,
I'm a California man.

[from 2nd chorus on repeat last line 2x]
I'm a California man.

Oh my legs start to shiver
When I hear you call my name.
Well, my knees keep a knockin,
And my bow tie's bustin' out

When my feet start to fly,
An' my jeans slung way down low.
You know I'm back on my heels and it's making me feel 
Like the king of rock n' roll

[Chorus]

[Solo]

[Repeat 1st Verse]

[Chorus]
