When days turn to night
All that's right
Comes alive, honey
I want to be your lion
Do it like
No other can, honey

Standing by the door
Like a loaded 44

I got some trouble tonight
Got a woman to squeeze me tight
I got something for the whole day
And I like it baby
I like it

You've got a mind
He's got his hands
On the [?] honey
Lips as thick as blood
I'm out of love
I can't give it up now, honey

Lying on the floor
Now she's crying out the door

I've got some sugar tonight
Got a woman to squeeze me tight
I've got someone to hold me
And I like it baby
I like it

Standing by the door
Like a loaded 44

I got some trouble tonight
Got a woman to squeeze me tight
I got someone for the one day
I like it roll me
I like it

I got some trouble tonight
Got a woman to squeeze me tight
I got something for the whole day
