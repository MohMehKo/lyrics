I was blind, now I can see
Your love shines all around me
All I want is to be here with you
This is what I was made for

Heaven is steps away
These days everything I am is about you
These days my world revolves around you
I don't know what I would be without you
These days, these days

I was bound, now I am free
The sun shines all around me
All I want is to be here for you
Forever more

Heaven is steps away
These days everything I am is about you
Yeah, these days my world revolves around you
I don't know what I would be without you
These days
