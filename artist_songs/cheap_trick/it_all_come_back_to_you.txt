When all your friends have gone
How long will time go on
It all comes back to you
It all comes back to you

When I look up to the sky
Say a prayer for you tonight
It all comes back to you
Well with everything you do
Oh yeah it all comes back to you

I, if I could fly, I'd fly away tonight
So why, why fly, should I try tonight

The best I've ever had
It all went by so fast
It all comes down to you
With all the things you do

When the world is gone and done
Spent your life on the run
Yeah it all comes back to you
With everything we do
Yeah it all comes back to you

I, if I could fly, I'd fly away tonight
So why, why, why, should I try tonight

I know what's done is done
Of all my loves, you're the one
So it all comes back to you
Yeah, with everything you do
It all comes back to you
