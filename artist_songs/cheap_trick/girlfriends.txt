All mine, all mine, all mine, all mine, all mine, all mine.
All mine, all mine, all mine, all mine, all mine, all mine.
All mine, all mine, all mine, all mine, all mine, all mine.
All mine, all mine, all mine, all mine, all mine, all mine.
All mine, all mine, all mine, all mine.

You can drink my whiskey, get high all night; 
Play my guitar, well, that's all right.
Give you my money, never get it back.
Take what you want as a matter of fact.
You can have anything, anything except...
My girlfriends, my girlfriends.
That's where I draw the line.
My girlfriends, my girlfriends.
All mine, all mine, all mine, all mine, all mine.

Promise her cocaine, reds, whites and blues.
If I catch you doing that shit, 
I know you're gonna lose.
Like a copy cat killer lacks originality.
Yeah, a lousy Cliff Irving tryin' to plagiarize me.

My girlfriends, my girlfriends.
That's where I draw the line.
My girlfriends, my girlfriends.
All mine, all mine, all mine, all mine, all mine.

Well, one of these days, and it won't be long.
Ain't the same old line from a rock- 'n' -roll song.
If Long Tall Sally ever talked like that, 
You can take what you want as a matter of fact.
You can have ev'rything, anything except...

My girlfriends, my girlfriends.
That's where I draw the line.
My girlfriends, my girlfriends.
All mine, all mine, all mine, all mine, all mine.

Don't try, steal my girlfriends.
Oo, I love her a lot, yeah, yeah, yeah

My girlfriends, my girlfriends.
It's all that I've got.
It's all that I've got.
It's all that I've got, oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
My girlfriends, my girlfriends.
Don't try, steal my girlfriends.
