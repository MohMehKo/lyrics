Long time, no see ya'
So good to see ya'
I don't care
Where you've been
Or what you want
Or why you went

Long time, no see ya'
So good to see ya'
I don't know
When you left
Or who you're with
Or what's your sin

Long time, no see ya'
So good to see ya'

But then I get to thinking
And then I get a drink
And then I get another
Again I get another
Another, another
Again I have another
And then it comes to me, I wanna have another well

So good to see ya'
Long time, no see ya'
You're back where you belong
So good to see ya'
Now I'm better, been way too long

Happy endings
Never end
It's only now
Over and over

Long time, no see ya'
So good to see ya'
Stop my friend
Star again
Drinking song
He sings again

Long time, no see ya'
So good to see ya'

But then I get to thinking
And then I get a drink
And then I get another
Again I had another
Another, another
Again I have another
And then it comes to me, I wanna have another right
So good to see ya'

Long time no see ya'
You're back where you belong
So good to see ya'
Now I'm better, been way too long

Long time no see ya'
You're back where you belong
So good to see ya'
Now I'm better, been way too long
Long time no see ya'
You're back where you belong
So good to see ya'
Now I'm better, been way too long

Long time no see ya'
So good to see ya'
