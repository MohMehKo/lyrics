Did did did did did did you know you're lady is now seeing another man?
Yeah, go ahead and ask her, she just don't understand
And even when you're with her you know she feels so alone
She says it's because she's lonely you don't see her at home

She needs you
Take her hand
Bide your time

Come running home
As your life passes by
And it's gone
Gone, cause it's gone

Bide your time

Do you believe me?
Come running home
As your life passes by
And it's gone
Gone, cause it's gone
