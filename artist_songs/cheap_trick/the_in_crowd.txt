I'm in with the "in" crowd
I go where the "in" crowd goes
I'm in with the "in" crowd
And I know what the "in" crowd knows
(Out to have fun!)

Anytime of the year
Don't you hear?
(Out to have fun!)
Dressing fine
Making time

We breeze up and down the street
We get respect from people we meet
They make way day or night
They know the "in" crowd is out to sight

I'm in with the "in" crowd
I know every latest dance
When you're in with the "in" crowd
It's so easy to find romance
(How to have fun!)

Anytime of the year
You can hear
(Out to have fun!)
If it's square
We ain't there

We make every minute count
Our share is the biggest amount
Other guys imitate us
But the original's still the greatest

"In" Crowd!

In the "in" crowd

We got our own way of walkin'
We got our way of talkin'
(Out to have fun!)

Anytime of the year
Don't you hear?
(Out to have fun!)

Spendin' cash, talkin' trash
Girl I'll show you a real good time
Come on and leave your troubles behind

I don't care where you been
You ain't been nowhere 'til you've been in
