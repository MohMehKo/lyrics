She gets high
He gets low
But it is his life
Like Frank Jr

He starts to sneeze
And pronounces "bless me"
Wipes his nose on his shirt
That says "Kill Whitey"

Takes away the hurt
Real fast
Kind of like listening to
Jimmy or Patsy Kline

I'm all strung out
On you

You're all left
I want to do
I do what you want me to

I'm all strung out
On you

He digs
And sees Johnny Cash
But he loves Courtney Love
With a passion

He's got a mom he calls Denise
His daddy cuts his hair
But has always wanted to be
A priest

Heaven knows
Where he comes from
And he knows he waits
Until it's like a machine gun

I'm all strung out
On you
(Strung out on you)

You're all that I want
To do
Do what you want me to

I'm all strung out
On you

You're everything I ever wanted
You're everything I'll ever need
You're everything I ever wanted
Don't you get me started
Don't get me started
Don't start it

I'm all strung out
On you
All strung out
On you
All strung out
