My darling little ones, can you hear me?
I'll know in my heart when you need me
I'll always be there when you want me to

Take a look around the world, it's a wonder
Look up to the sky that you're under
There's so much to life, there's so much to do

When I see you smile my love I just can't hide my love
When you call out my name, well you know how it feels
Well, it seems like a dream and I just can't believe it's real

Imagine you and me now and ever
Whatever will be I surrender
I'll always be there if you want me to

When I look into your eyes, it's a wonder
A wonderful spell that I'm under
We're not just a dream meant for me and you

When I see you smile my love I just can't hide my love
When you call out my name, well you know how it feels
Well, it seems like a dream and I just can't believe it's real

Don't be afraid, don't be afraid to cry
I'll dry your tears, everything will be alright

When I see you smile my love I just can't hide my love
When you call out my name, well you know how it feels
Well, it seems like a dream and I just can't believe it's real

Take a look around the world, it's a wonder
Look up to the sky that you're under
There's so much to life and so much for you
