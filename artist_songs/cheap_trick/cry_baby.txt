Cry!                        
Cry baby
ooooh ooooh
Cry baby

Put yourself around me babe
never let me go
Wrap yourself around me
take it easy, make it slow
Come a little closer.
Is there something I should know?
What goes on inside your head
I'll never, never know

But now if good is good
and bad is bad
if bad is good and good is bad
then you're the best
I've ever had

Baby, maybe you just never tried
to be in love so...

Takin' and fakin' and breakin'
and makin' me cry Baby
Cry baby!
oooooh

Put your hands around me babe
never, never let me go
what goes on inside my head
you'll never, never know

Where does all the precious time go?
maybe if you didn't mind so baby
baby you just never tried
I'm in love....so

takin' it - just can't believe
you're makin' me cry
Baby

Cry baby
cry...cry baby
ooooh
cry....cry baby
ooooh baby
[repeat]

you make me so lonely
I'm feelin' so lonely
oooooh
