Mama never told me there'd be days like this
It all started out with a little kiss
One thing led to another, temperature was hot
My heart was on the line, I was workin' overtime
Then along came a beat, still I don't know why

(Try to remember) my heart was on the line
(Try to remember) it was the very first time
(Try to remember) my heart was on the line
(Try to remember)

Sittin' in the middle of a traffic jam
My heart's playin' bumper-pool--silly game
One thing led to another, then I took a shot
My heart was on the line, I was workin' overtime
With my balls in my pocket, will I ever be the same?

(Try to remember) my heart was on the line
(Try to remember) it was the very first time
(Try to remember) my heart was on the line
(Try to remember)

Mama never told me there'd be days like this
It all started out with a little kiss
I didn't to know I'd meet girls like you
Guess I got a lot to learn, yeah, yeah, yeah

Don't just hide, I wanna try it
Even if you don't have a clue!
Take your best shot, then bring it to the top
And it won't take long, give it all you got, yeah!

One thing led to another, then I took a shot
My heart was on the line, I was workin' overtime
Then along came a beat, knocked me off my feet

(Try to remember) my heart was on the line
(Try to remember) it was the very first time
(Try to remember) my heart was on the line
(Try to remember)

Mama never told me there'd be days like this
It all started out with a little kiss
I didn't to know I'd meet girls like you
Guess I got a lot to learn, yeah, yeah, yeah
