Whatcha gonna do when the lights start shining
'ello kiddies
'ello kiddies
Whatcha gonna do when your head's exploding
So you missed some school
You know that school's for fools
Today money rules
And everybody steals it
'ello kiddies
'ello kiddies
Whatcha gonna do when your stomach's burning
'ello kiddies
'ello kiddies
Whatcha gonna do when your guts are churning
You lead a life of crime
You got to go unwind
You haven't got much time
You know they're out to get you
'ello kiddies
'ello kiddies
Whatcha gonna do when you got religion
'ello kiddies
'ello kiddies
Hope you didn't get it on the television
So you missed some school
You know that school's for fools
Today money rules
And everybody steals it
You lead a life of crime
You got to go unwind
You haven't got much time
You know they're out to get you
