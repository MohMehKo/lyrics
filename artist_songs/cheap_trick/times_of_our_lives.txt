I can't decide where the story begins or it dies
On the way back from your heart to mine
Well, time passes by

I can't stop if I tried
Well, I can't quit and you know I can't hide
Why should I change?
Well, I don't know why, the truth is I lied

Times of our lives
Times of our lives

How was it we could be so wrong?
I thought our love was strong
And these were the times of our lives

Times of our lives

How could you say you played it wrong?
You pulled my heart strings
It's so hard to play along, so now

Tell me tonight
Tell me that everything is alright
Show me that our love will last all the times of our lives

Times of our lives
Times of our lives
