[1]
Clock strikes ten it's a Saturday night
Got money in my pocket and it feels allright
Not stayin' home gonna stay out late
Gotta hear some rockin' music and it feels just great

[2]
Clock strikes twelve on a Saturday night
All the creeps are sleepin' all the cools in sight
All the kings and queens, they're out tonight
Lookin' for some action 'til I feel allright

[3]
Imagine what we're doin' tonight
You really got me goin' tonight
Imagine what we're doin' tonight
I'm crazy for some action tonight

[4]
Clock strikes two out all night
All my money's spent but that's allright
Not goin' home gonna stay out late
Get ready for some action want some action tonight

[Repeat 3]

[5]
Clock stikes four I want some more
Everybody's layin' on the floor
Not goin' home gonna stay out late
Gotta hear that rockin' music it feels allright

[Repeat 3]
