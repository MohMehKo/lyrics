If the light is out and been sitting pretty
Scream that pitiful scream
When the light is out will be blown and willing 
Better watch were I lean

When you gaze into a crystal ball
You'll see nothing's gonna change at all 
You'll see nothing's gonna happen over night
So please 

When the lights are out 
When I hear you sigh
Let me feel your warm breath on my neck
It makes me hit the sky

When the lights are out 
When I hear you sigh
Let me feel your warm breath on my neck
It makes me hit the sky

When your will is burned you can blow me over
Blow me beautiful blow
If a nail is stuck you can turn me under
Wind up ready go

When you gaze into a crystal ball
You'll see nothing's gonna change at all 
You'll see nothing's gonna happen over night
So please 

When the lights are out 
When I hear you sigh
Let me feel your warm breath on my neck
It makes me hit the sky

When the lights are out 
When I hear you sigh
Let me feel your warm breath on my neck
It makes me hit the sky
When the lights are out 

When you gaze into a crystal ball
You'll see nothing's gonna change at all 
You'll see nothing's gonna happen over night
So please 

When the lights are out 
When I hear you sigh
Let me feel your warm breath on my neck
It makes me hit the sky

When the lights are out
