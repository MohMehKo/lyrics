Well, the light certainly shines on you
All the times of the times point to you
Everywhere I look, I see your face, it comes to you
One, out of love, two, a little rough
Three is a lot better than these
But you can rattle it, time standing in line

The sun never sets
On a love that shines
The sun never sets
On a love that shines
Sunshine, yeah

I'll never find a better day than today
I was blinded by those airless rays
Then heaven smiled, when you came my way
One, just enough, two, a little rough
She's a lot better than me
You can't handle it, you better get in line

The sun never sets
On a love that shines
The sun never sets
On a love that shines
Sunshine, yeah

The sun never sets
On a love that shines
The sun never sets
On a love that shines
The sun never sets
On a love that shines
The sun never sets
On a love that shines
