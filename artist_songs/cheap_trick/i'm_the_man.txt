Going down the road
With a friend or two
Ain't nothing in the world
In the world I can't do
You thought you'd seen it all
You ain't seen nothing new
In the world I can't do

I'm ready to rock
I'm a rock n roller
And I can't control myself

Big city 
Big lights
Can see it up ahead
No one can stop me
I'm driving ahead
Make a name for myself
And I'll be number one
Turn around and turn around
And know I'm number one

I'm ready to rock
I'm a rock n roller
And I can't control myself
I can really rock
Rock n roller
And I can't control myself

I'm the man
In a rock n roll band
I'm the man for you baby
I'm the man
I'm a man
In a rock n roll man
I'm the man for you baby
Yes I'm the man
Yes I am
I'm the man in a rock n roll band
I'm the man for you baby
I'm the man
In a rock n roll band
