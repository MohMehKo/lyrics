Pay some attention 
Want to get it right 
Ooo-how about you 
Mind's under pressure 
Happens every night 
Ooo-let it go
Love is like a knife 
It cuts deep and wide 
And I-I-I oughta know
Lay your hands on me 
I prescribe a pill 
Ooo-how about now 
Tension's a buildin' 
Need to let it out 
Ooo-let it go 
Love is like a knife 
It cuts deep and wide 
And I-I-I oughta know
Call me the Doctor 
Makes you feel good 
Make it feel better now 
Everybody should 
It's my own opinion 
It's my point of view 
If you really need it now 
Call me the Doctor Doctor Feel Good- hey
I make house calls 
In the middle of the night 
Ooo-to get you right 
Come a little closer 
Is it pleasure is it pain 
Ooo-I've got the cure
Love is like a knife 
It cuts deep and wide 
And I-I-I oughta know
Call me the Doctor 
Makes you feel good 
Make it feel better now 
Everybody should 
It's my own opinion 
It's my point of view 
If you really need it now 
Call me the Doctor Doctor Feel Good- hey
