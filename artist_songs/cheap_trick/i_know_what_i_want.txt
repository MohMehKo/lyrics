I've been around the world and met a million girls,
Still, i know i wanna be with you.
You've got more than anyone else,
And i want you more than anything;

'cause i know what i want, and i know how to get it.
I know what i want, and i know how to get it.
I know what i want, and i know how to get it from you, from you.

I knew i'd meet you, i had a dream about you,
We were walkin' hand in hand,
We were talkin' 'bout love.
It was love at first sight,
When i looked into your eyes
I was blinded by the feelings in my heart.

'cause i know what i want, and i know how to get it.
I know what i want, and i know how to get it.
I know what i want, and i know how to get it from you, from you.

I know, i know, i know, i know what i want!
I know what i want!
I want it!

Well, ya knew i'd meet you,
Ya know i dreamt about you,
We were walkin' hand in hand,
We were talkin' 'bout love.
Love at first sight, when i looked into your eyes
I was blinded by the feelings in my heart.
I know you feel it, there's no doubt about it,
It's gettin' stronger every day.
It's a one in a million, i was shootin' for the stars,
You're the world's greatest lover and you're mine.

'cause i know what i want, and i know how to get it.
I know what i want, and i know how to get it.
I know what i want, and i know how to get it from you, from you.

I know what i want, and i know how to get it.
