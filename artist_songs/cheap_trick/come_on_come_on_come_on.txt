Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Come on, come on, come on, little baby
Down down down with me
Come on, come on, come on, little baby
Down down down with me

Don't just sit there with your head in your hands
Waitin' for the skies to fall
You're not in sync with the boys in the band
Get up, get up, get on the ball

Oh, oh
No more soft sides, no more cares
No more mouths to feed
No more angry tales to share
No more dirty d-d-d-d-deeds

So come on, come on, come on, little baby
Down down down with me
Come on, come on, come on, little baby
Down down down with me

No more time, no excuse
Get up on your feet
Temperature's high 98 degrees
Let's get back to the street boys

Oh, oh
Don't just sit there with you head in your hands
Waitin' for the sky to fall
You're not in sync with the boys in the band
Get up, get up, get on the ball

Come on, come on, come on, little baby
Down down down with me
Come on, come on, come on, little baby
Down down down with me

[Instrumental]

Oh, oh
Come on, come on, come on, little baby
Down down down with me
Come on, come on, come on, little baby
Down down down with me, down with me
Down down down down down 

Come on, come on, come on, little baby
Down down down with me
Come on, come on, come on, little baby
Down down down with me

Come on, come on, come on, little baby
Down down down with me
Come on, come on, come on, little baby
Down down down down down with me
