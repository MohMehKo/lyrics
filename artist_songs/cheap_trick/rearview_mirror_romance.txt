I'm movin' I'm feeling like I'm rollin' on my own (What could be better) 
Then somewhere drivin' my car the radio turn it on (What could be better) 
I check around in traffic from my point of view (What could be better) 
Then I saw her in the mirror 
Maybe the same thing has happened to you 
It was
Romance in a rearview mirror 
Romance after just one look 
Romance in a rearview mirror 
I didn't know her but it didn't matter 
Romance in a rearview mirror 
Just by chance I still can't believe that it's true love reflected sight 
It's a rearview romance tonight
She pulled up close first glance I saw here eyes (What could be better) 
I couldn't stop starin' at her she didn't realize (What could be better) 
Then looked up in the mirror smile on her faace 
There she goes heaven knows 
Maybe the same thing has happened to you 
It was
Romance in a rearview mirror 
Romance after just one look 
Romance in a rearview mirror 
I didn't know her but it didn't matter 
Romance in a rearview mirror 
Just by chance I still can't believe that it's true love reflected sight 
It's a rearview romance tonight
[Solo]
There she goes heaven knows 
I wanna meet her all alone
Romance in a rearview mirror 
Romance after just one look 
Romance in a rearview mirror 
I didn't know her but it didn't matter 
Romance in a rearview mirror 
Just by chance I still can't believe that it's true love reflected sight 
It's a rearview romance tonight
Romance in a rearview mirror 
Romance after just one look 
Romance in a rearview mirror 
I didn't know her but it didn't matter 
Romance in a rearview mirror 
Just by chance I still can't believe that it's true love reflected sight 
It's a rearview romance tonight
Romance in a rearview mirror 
Romance after just one look 
Romance in a rearview mirror 
I didn't know her but it didn't matter 
Romance in a rearview mirror 
Just by chance I still can't believe that it's true love reflected sight 
It's a rearview romance tonight
