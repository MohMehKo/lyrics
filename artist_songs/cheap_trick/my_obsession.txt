Pour out your heart 
the feelings never fade away
so where are you now 
I loved you more than I can say
you wouldn't see couldn't touch can't believe it's true
your love feels like home 
you're my obsession
all the things we did 
what's left is just a photograph 
everything I held so close 
was never meant to last
you're in my heart 
it's never gonna fade away
your love feels like home
you're my obsession
if I could find all the dreams I've made
I'd turn the clock  back to yesterday
to hold onto what I got with you 
shine bright like all the stars
unlock every dream I've made
I'd turn tomorrow into yesterday
all the things we did 
what's left is just a photograph
you wouldn't see couldn't touch can't believe it's true
your love feels like home
you're my obsession
