How does it feel to be on you own
while the night slips away
you toss and turn like a ship in the storm
have you lost your way
i can see by the look in your eyes 
you've been hurt before
hold me close like the very first time 
cause that's what love is for

there's no reason to cry cause ill be there beside you when you need someone
id never leave you
i swear that you will be the only one
through the sorrow and pain just call out my name when you need someone
id sleep forever i swear that you would never be the only one when you need 
someone

sometimes the world can be so cold and you don't know why
you're reaching out but there's no one to hold in times rushing by
i can see by the look in your eyes you just cant let go
hold me close and together we'll find just what love is for

there's no reason to cry cause ill be there beside you when you need someone
id never leave you i swear that you would be the only one
through the sorrow and pain just call out my name when you need someone
id sleep forever i swear that you would never be the lonely one when you need 
someone

When you need someone its a long long day when you need someone  
its a crawl and change 
when you need someone you can call out my name

there's no reason to cry cause ill be there beside you when you need 
someone....etc etc
