I will never run out of love for you
I'll never run out of love

Midnight, don't seem right
I lie awake just a-wonderin' about you
Wound up much too tight
Can't think about livin' without you
The day you put your spell on me
I guess I was the last to know
So please remember before you go

That I will never run out of love for you
I'll never run out of love
I will never run out of love for you
Got more than enough, more than enough
No I will never run out of love

For so long, deep and strong
Love flowed mighty as a river
Long road, heavy load
Hard times couldn't keep us apart
Never thought you would
Break the promise, oh no
Now it seems there's a part of me
That just can't let you go
So please remember
That you can come back home

â€˜Cause I will never run out of love for you
I'll never run out of love
I will never run out of love for you
Got more than enough, more than enough
No I will never run out of love

No, no baby, don't you leave me no
No, no baby, don't go
No, no baby, if you run away
I still hope you know
I need you so
I can't take no more

I will never run out of love for you
I'll never run out of love
I will never run out of love for you
Got more than enough, more than enough
No I will never run out of love for you
I'll never run out of love for you

No, I will never run out of love for you
I'll never run out of love
I will never run out of love for you
Got more than enough, more than enough
No, I will never run out of love for you
Oh baby please, don't go
No, I'll never run out of love for you

I'll never run out of love for you
I'll never run out of love
I will never run out of love for you
I'll never run out, never run out
No I will never run out of love for you
I'll never run out of love for you
