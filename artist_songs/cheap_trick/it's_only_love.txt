Lonely days and lonely nights 
Seeming so much longer with the phone lines 
Torn between decisions wrong or right 
Ooh I wish I knew the stars tonight
'Cause you could look around and see 
The moving pictures of my mind's eye
It's only love…it's a miracle 
It's a wonder 
It's only love…it's a miracle
There we meet at some forgotten point 
On the streets of New York or was it London town 
Maybe we were daydreaming out loud 
Or maybe we nowhere 
It doesn't matter now 'cause 
You mean more to me than any hope or any dream 
I know now
It's only love…it's a miracle 
It's a wonder 
It's only love…it's a miracle
When I say I miss you then I mean that I need you 
When I say I need you then I mean that I miss you now
It's only love…it's a miracle 
It's a wonder 
It's only love…it's a miracle
It's only love…it's a miracle 
It's a wonder 
It's only love…it's a miracle
It's only love…it's a miracle 
It's a wonder 
It's only love…it's a miracle
