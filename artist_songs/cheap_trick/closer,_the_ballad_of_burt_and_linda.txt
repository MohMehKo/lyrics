Every day is a darker day, it's always gonna be that way
One step closer to mine
I know it's not respectable but it is the best of all
One step closer

Relax your mind
It really doesn't matter if the heaven's gonna rain or shine
You're better of blind, the love you don't find
Makes you one step closer to mine, closer

One step closer
One step closer

Relax your mind
It really doesn't matter if the heaven's gonna rain or shine
You're better of blind the love you don't find
Makes you one step closer to mine, closer
