Strange
How funny things can be
Strange
The things you said to me

Scream
I could've laughed until I cried
Strange
I could've took you for my bride

Here she comes, Miss Tomorrow
Here she comes, here she comes, Miss Tomorrow
Here she comes, Miss Tomorrow
Here she comes, here she comes, Miss Tomorrow

Cold
You left me froze to the bone
Cold
Your lips were like kissing stone

Love
You said that love is all you need
Cold
You taught The Beatles let it bleed

Here she comes, Miss Tomorrow
Here she comes, here she comes, Miss Tomorrow
Here she comes, Miss Tomorrow
Here she comes, here she comes, Miss Tomorrow

Here she comes
Here she comes

Here she comes, Miss Tomorrow
Here she comes, here she comes, Miss Tomorrow
Here she comes, Miss Tomorrow
Here she comes, here she comes, Miss Tomorrow

Here she comes, Miss Tomorrow
Here she comes, here she comes, Miss Tomorrow
Here she comes, Miss Tomorrow
Here she comes, here she comes, Miss Tomorrow
