You didn't know what you were looking for
Till you heard the voices in your ear

Hey, it's me again
Plain to see again
Please, can I see you every day?
I'm a fool again
I fell in love with you again
Please, can I see you every day?

You didn't know what you were looking for
Till you heard the voices in your ear
You didn't know what you were looking for
Till you heard the voices in your ear

Words don't come out right
I try to say it oh, so right
I hope you understand my meaning
Hey, it's me again
I'm so in love with you again
Please, can I see you every day?

You didn't know what you were looking for
Till you heard the voices in your ear
You didn't know what you were looking for
Till you heard the voices in your ear

I remember every word you said (word you said)
I remember voices in my head (in my head)
I remember every word you said (word you said)

(I) Your voices 
(Heard your voice) Cool voices 
Warm voices
It was just what I needed to

(Words) Cool voices 
(Don't seem right) Warm voices
Your voices
It's just what I needed for

(Love) Warm voices
(Is the word) Your voices
Cool voices
It was just what I needed to

(I) Your voices 
(Heard your voice) Cool voices 
Warm voices
It was just what I needed to
Just what I needed to
Just what I needed

You didn't know what you were looking for
Till you heard the voices in your ear
You didn't know what you were looking for
Till you heard the voices in your ear
