Well i can't stop the music
I could stop it before
Now i don't want to hear it
Don't wanna hear it no more
No more

I can't stop the music
I could stop it before
Now i don't wanna hear it
Don't wanna hear it no more

All i wanna do is stop this game
It's gonna really end
Stop this game
It's such a touchy, touchy thing

Hey, livin' with you
Is all i wanted before
I've changed, you didn't
Don't wanna see you no more

All i wanna do is stop this game
It's gonna really end
Oh, stop this game
It's such a touchy, touchy thing

Well we were walkin' before we could crawl
And you were lovin' just emotion just all
It's just emotion wasn't music at all
Now i can't stop the music
Now i don't wanna hear it no more
No more, no more, no more

Stop this game
It's gonna really end
Stop this game
It's such a touchy, touchy thing

I can't stop the music (stop this game)
I could stop it before (it's gonna really end)
Now i don't wanna hear it (stop this game)
Don't wanna hear it no more (it's such a touchy, touchy thing)
