Jump in my love car
Don't have to go very far
Just far enough to show you a thing or two

I can really swing
The best of everything
And i want to have a thing with you

High roller
What i buy is mine
And i always get the things that i choose
My, my, my, such a high roller
I know he's gone away and left you
I'll take real good care of you

I'm in the mood for love
You're all i'm thinking of
I'll make you feel alright when we're alone

I can really swing
The best of everything
And i want to have a thing with you

High roller
What i buy is mine
And i always get the things that i choose
My, my, my, such a high roller, is that you?
I knew you'd be here tonight
And i'll make it alright
I'll take real good care of you
I'll tuck you in tonight
And i'll make it alright
I know he's gone away and left you
I'll take real good care of you
