Yesterday feels like running away
Feels like givin' the child gettin' lost losin' my mind
I'm feelin' low and i got no place to go
Gettin' all tied up, feelin' all tied up yeah yeah
Oh yesterday feels like running away
And i know, i'm givin' up my time to still love still love love's got me blind
My mind sees the things i don't know and i got no place to go
Gettin' all tied up, feelin' all tied up
Things i need to tell you love
You'll be true i know
There's still a chance for a better life
Yes, i know
