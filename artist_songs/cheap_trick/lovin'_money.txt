Lovin'
Lovin'
I never seem to get it
But my mind is always thinkin' 'bout lovin'
Lovin'
Lovin'
I never seem to get it
But my mind is always thinkin' 'bout lovin'

There's a lot of things that seem to go 'round
Like the world
The love
And the fun
There's a lot of things that seem to go 'round
Like the girls
And the love
I get numb

Lovin'
Lovin'
I never seem to get it
But my mind is always thinkin' 'bout lovin'
Lovin'
Lovin'
I never seem to get it
But my mind is always thinkin' 'bout lovin'
