Sun goes down night moves in 
I don't need the pain again 
Those x-ray eyes 
It's a fascination
All lined up ready to go 
Fully loaded overflow 
High heeled mood 
Let's go for some action
Man-u-lip-u-lator it's so easy when heads meet 
Exploring but nightmares speak 
Rumors fly Idle speculation
Man-u-lip-u-lator tryin' to operate on you 
Sticky situation I'd love to fall into 
You're a Man-u-lip-u-lator with a low low attitude oohoo 
Like to love ya later 'cause I'm an operator too
Full alert defcon 4 
Seal the windows lock the door 
I in-coming 
It's a natural reaction
Man-u-lip-u-lator tryin' to operate on you ooh 
Sticky situation I'd love to fall into
Take it to the left 
Move it to the right 
Holde me oh so tight 
Never let it go
Man-u-lip-u-lator Man-u-lip-u-lator 
Man-u-lip-u-lator Man-u-lip-u-lator Man-u-lip-u-lator Man-u-lip-u-lator 
Man-u-lip-u-lator tryin' to operate on you ooh 
Sticky situation I'd love to fall into 
You're a Man-u-lip-u-lator with a low low attitude oohoo 
Like to love ya later Doctor's got his eye on you
Man-u-lip-u-lator tryin' to operate on you 
Sticky situation I'd love to fall into 
You're a Man-u-lip-u-lator with a low low attitude oohoo 
Like to love ya later 'cause I'm an operator too
