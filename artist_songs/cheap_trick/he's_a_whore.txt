Have you seen her face
She's got a face that would stop a clock
And with that face I surely won't stop
To look her in the eyes
But her money's green
She's a tease like a social disease
But she's still so close to my reach
If I call, if I call at all

Any time at all
Any time at all
Any time at all
Any time at all

So the story goes
I think I'll take her for a ride
With this moneybag by my side
A giggolo is the only way to go
And So I show my face
And I can even fake a smile
But I'm laughing inside all the while
This little girl
She's a joke
She's a joke
She's a joke

Any time at all
Any time at all
Any time at all
Any time at all

&gt;&gt;&gt;He's a whore, (I'd do anything for money)
&gt;&gt;&gt;He's a whore, (Look at the things that I write)
&gt;&gt;&gt;He's a whore, (Ooo, The stories I can tell)

He's a whore (in the morning, in the night)
I'm a whore (he'll do anything for money)
I'm a whore (look at the clothes that he wears)
I'm a whore (he'll do anything for money
I'm a whore
And so the story goes
I think i'll take her for a ride
With this moneybag by my side
A giggolo is the only way to go
Ooooohhhh
Wo wo-wo
Oooo woo
Oooo oo oo oo
