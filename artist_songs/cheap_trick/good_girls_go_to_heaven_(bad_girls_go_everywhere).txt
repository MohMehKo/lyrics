Some girls do Some girls don't 
Don't mean type Don't mean smoke 
Lay me down Can't seem to sleep 
My mind's been thinkin' real deep
All my thoughts are runnin wild Out of control-outta my mind
'Cause good girls go to heaven Bad girls go everywhere 
If I had my choice of women 
I'd pick the ones that'd go anywhere 
All good girls they go to heaven 
All bad girls go everywhere they like
Late at night When she comes out 
The lady moves Prowls the town 
A perfect match Of looks and charm 
Where she goes It's light and dark
She's so hot I burn my tongue When I kiss her lips she turns me on
Good girls go to heaven 
Bad girls go everywhere 
If I had my choice of women 
I'd pick the ones that'd go anywhere 
All good girls they go to heaven 
All bad girls go everywhere they like
[Solo]
Made my choice made it well Had my pick of heaven or
Good girls go to heaven Bad girls go everywhere 
If I had my choice of women I'd pick the ones that'd go anywhere 
All good girls they go to heaven All bad girls go everywhere they like
Good girls they've got manners Bad girls got what matters 
Good girls leave at home Bad girls come with the singer
Good girls go to heaven Bad girls go everywhere that they like
