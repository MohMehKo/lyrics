I've been waiting every night after school
For five long years, five long years
I'll keep waiting for you five nights a week
Cuz I'm no good

Ooo, rockin' and a rollin'
Reelin' 'til the juke breaks
Ooo, reelin' and a rockin'
Rollin' 'til the juke box breaks down

I'm thirty but I feel like sixteeen
I might even know your daddy
I'm dirty but my body is clean
I might even be you daddy

Ooo, reelin' and a rockin'
Rollin' 'till the break of....
Ooo, reelin' and a rockin'
Rollin' 'til the juke breaks

I like you and you like me, yes?
Sorry but I had to, gag you
You look better completely undressed
Sorry but I had to, have you

I like you and you like me, yes?
Sorry but I had to gag you
You look better completely undressed
Sorry but I had to have you

Ahhhh I'm thirty but I feel like sixteeen
How would you like some candy?
I'm thinking more than a kiss
Whip me, spank me, grab me

Grab me
Grab me
Grab me
