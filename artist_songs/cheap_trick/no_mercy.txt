No mercy
In the midnight hush, the restless hours between dark and light
In dreams we come together underneath the cover of the night
You're holding out, but I'm holding on
Can't wait until your resistance is gone
No mercy, accept no defeat
No mercy, 'til you're here with me
Now the pressure's on
You can run away but you can't hide
You might as well surrender, the walls are closing in on every side
I'm getting closer, now, there's no escape
Victory is written all over my face
No mercy, I won't give in No!
No mercy, 'til you let me in
I won't take no for an answer
I won't let go
No mercy, until you let me in
No mercy, no, I'll never give in
No mercy, I won't let you go No!
No mercy, and I want you to know, oh
No mercy
