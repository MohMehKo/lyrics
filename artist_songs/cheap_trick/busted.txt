Ooh what you fell into
It's really nothin' new
Well it's the same thing every day
I'm in the wrong place at the wrong time
With what I do and say
I've tried and tried to right my wrongs
And turn 'em all around
Turn 'em around, turn 'em around, turn 'em around
[Chorus]
*Busted
Busted for what I did
I didn't think it so wrong
Busted
Busted for what I did
I didn't think it so wrong
Busted 
Busted for what I did
I didn't think it so wrong
I didn't, I didn't think it so wrong, well
Well I made a big mistake
But baby that's the breaks
I can't erase what's done is done
Don't have the best of luck
I think enuff's enuff
And my mind is on the run
Time to go, time to show
We'll turn it around
Turn it around, turn it around, turn it around
[* Repeat]
Now I'm faced with another mistake
Every step I take, and every move I make
Face to face, another disgrace
Face to face, but that's the breaks
Wouldn't trade place
To see the look on your face
Tell me where you've been
You've got to keep it in
And baby, please don't give it up
I'm gonna be with you
Deep inside of you
I'll never give you up
I've tried and tried
To be so strong
An turn it all around
Turn it around, turn it around, turn it around
[* Repeat x3]
Busted
Busted for what I did
