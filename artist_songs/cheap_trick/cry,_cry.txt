My my my
My my eyes i can't believe
I'm cryin'
You you
Yeah you you broke my heart
It's true
It seems to me
You should have told me
I just can't go on this way
My my my
My my eyes i can't believe
I'm cryin'
You you
Yeah you you broke my heart
It's true
You say to me
You say you never
Realized how much you loved me
So don't ya call me on the phone
Oh babe no no baby
Just to say you're all alone
And cry cry cry cry
It seems to me
You should have told me
I just can't go on this way
So don't ya call me on the phone
Oh babe no no baby
Just to say you're all alone
And cry cry cry cry
