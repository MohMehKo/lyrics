Where would we be today if no man ever had strength to believe 
If no man had a vision farther than their eyes could ever see 
They are the one's who paved the way 
To show you how you have been made for more 

This is your day, don't let them take it away yeah yeah 
This is your day, don't let them take it, take it 
This is your day, don't let them get in your way 
This is your day, so come on, take it, take your day 

This world distracts you, lies to you, and hopes to keep you from your call 
But don't be fooled, cause don't you see that you can stand up to it all 
You're unashamed, you're unafraid to 
To give up your life to serve the One who's called you 

This is your day, don't let them take it away yeah yeah 
This is your day, don't let them take it, take it 
This is your day, don't let them get in your way 
This is your day, so come on, take it, take your day
