I walked with you
Just like we've done for so long
You seem so near
But even that's become so common It's not just You, just been together so long
That I thought I knew everything about You
But today I saw
Did You open up my eyes?
'Cause I feel like I've just seen You for the first time

I didn't see You
But God I want to
You've come alive
And I think I've fallen harder than the first time

Was I so blind?
How did I not see You?
Yet in that time You never left my side
So far all my life I will live to know You
So here I am, I'll take Your hand

I see Your face
I feel You close
The love You've always shown me
Won't miss it now can't waste a day
Jesus I'm Yours completely
