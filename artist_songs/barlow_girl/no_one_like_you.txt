[Written by David Crowder]

You are more beautiful than anyone ever
Everyday You're the same You never change no never

You are more beautiful than anyone ever
Everyday You're the same You never change no never
And how can I ever deny the love of my Savior
You are to me everything all I need forever

How could you be so good?

[Chorus:]
There is no one like You
There has never ever been anyone like You

Everywhere You are there earth or air surrounding
I'm not alone the heavens sing along
My God You're so astounding
How could You be so good to me
Eternally I believe that

How could You be so good to me
How could You be so good to me
We're not alone so sing along
We're not alone so sing along
Sing along, sing along
