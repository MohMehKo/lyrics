They're telling me they're concerned for the way I am living 
That I'll miss it all why would I think that God is that trusting 
I can't explain all the words He has spoken to my heart 
Why'd I want him more 

I don't regret choosing you 
And I'm not ashamed 
That it's You who holds my heart 

Why do we think if we trust God too much will He fail us 
Nothing has come when I chose its that in me I'd trust 
Separate me You have called out to follow You blindly 
I won't fear You're leading me 

I don't regret choosing You 
And I'm not ashamed 
That it's You who holds my heart 

You have shown my ever wondering heart what love is 
What on earth is more important than to have all of You 

I don't regret choosing you 
And I'm not ashamed 
That it's You who holds my heart
