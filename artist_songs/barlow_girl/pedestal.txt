You're the coolest person
That I have ever seen
So perfect with your pretty face
On the TV screen

You're a god I know it
How you stand abouve them all 
You are my perfect person
Man I"d hate to see you fall

I want someone to believe in
Yeah well don't we all?
'Cause in this life of imperfection Meed someone who won't fall 
You got it, you got it, you got it all

Got a Magazine to day 
That was full of you
Shocked to read the words they said
Tell me they're not true

Add you to my fallen list
One more has hit the ground
The fault was mine 
Held you too high 
Your only what was down

I can't deny this need inside 
I have to find the perfect one 
But I wonder if behind my need 
There might be a reason?

Is my life just one big searching 
Fot the one I can adore?
It never works
And I'm just left here wanting more

Could it be this hunger's there 
To drive me to the One
Who's worthy of all worship
Would my searching then be done?
