Pushing my way through these crowded streets 
Trying not to be swept away 
Fighting just to keep this crowd from 
Hiding You another day 

So maybe this time I'll find You 
And maybe this time I'll push through 
To see You today, today 

[Chorus:]
Won't You take me away 
Won't You take me away 
'Cause I need some time to get away 
Where only You could ever 
Take me away, away, away 
Too many days I've been distracted 
Watched these crowds push You away 
I'm so tired of feeling empty 
Without You I waste these days 

So maybe this time I'll find You 
Just don't stop calling me to You 
And I'll find my way today
