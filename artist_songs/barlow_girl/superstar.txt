Well I spent my life dreaming super dreams
But I hate to wake 'cause it's then I see
That I'm nothing more than a dreamer
Superstar in my dreams I'm a dreamer

See the lights of stardom were calling me
Because only then someone I would be
So my goal in life was to get there
Never satisfied

I wanna be a star
But is that all I'm really here for?
And if I'm not a star will that be okay?
Could I still be someone?

Guess I"m scared to wake from these super dreams
Scared to live the life that's been waiting for me
What would life be like with no bright lights?
Tell me who I'd be with no spotlight

God You'll have to say who I really am
'Cause I cannot live in this perfect dreamland
But I've heard your dreams might be better
And I hope somehow

A superstar I may never be
And that is just a reality
Why can't we be God's superstars?
