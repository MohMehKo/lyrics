We are not blind
We know the truth
Still we don't stand
Still we don't choose.

We'd rather stay
So comfortable
Stuck in our world under controle.
We may not pull, the trigger but we, stand by and watch and pretend not to see.

Silence is worse, then evil done what in the world have we become?
Can't you see that...

[Chorus]
This is war,
So pick your side.
It's time to move, not time to hide.
Don't let lies, make up your mind.
Cause you will see,
We're Running Out of Time.

Tomorrow they'll come,
And one day we'll see,
The choices we make, made history.
For it's to late,
When will you stand and chose our words while you still can,
Can't you see that...

[Chorus]
This is war,
So pick your side.
It's time to move, not time to hide.
Don't let lies, make up your mind.
Cause you will see,
We're Running Out of Time.

Running Out of Time. 
Running Out of Time.
Can't you see that...

[Chorus]
This is war,
So pick your side.
It's time to move, not time to hide.
Don't let lies, make up your mind.
Cause you will see,
We're Running Out of Time.

Running Out of Time!
