Grey's my favorite color 
Black and white has never been my thing 
I'll take my drink lukewarm now 
Hot and cold is not the thing for me 

Absolutes are hidden 
I've buried my convictions 

[Chorus:]
I cannot be blind no more 
Numb to what I'm living for 
Help me stop this compromise that justifies these lies 
I need Your passion in this life 

I don't want to impose 
Who really needs to know what I believe 
Cause no one likes rockin' boats 
And who would care to see the way I see 

So give me the fire, yeah 
God give me Your fire 
And raise this life higher
