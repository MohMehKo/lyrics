Yeah I trust in You 
I remember times You led me 
This time it's bigger now 
And I'm afraid You'll let me down 

But how can I be certain? 
Will You prove Yourself again? 

[Chorus:]
'Cause I'm about to let go 
And live what I believe 
I can't do a thing now 
But trust that You'll catch me 
When I let go 
When I let go 

What is this doubt in me 
Convincing me to fear the unknown 
When all along You've shown 
Your plans are better than my own 

And I know I won't make it 
If I do this all alone
