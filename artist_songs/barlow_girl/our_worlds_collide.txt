Tonight the stars are dancing
To the songs the angels sing
I hear You whisper on the breeze
And every sound echoes the rhythm
Of your heart as I begin to fade
Into this lovely night
Im alive

Cause our worlds collide
Im lost in time
Heaven kisses me tonight
Your heart with mine
It beats in time
Now I know why Im alive

Now that Ive found You
I could never let You go away
You left my life never the same
Sing over me and let me hear the words
You wrote for me
Whisper the words and set my spirit free
Oh, sing to me
