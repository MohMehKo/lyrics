I was told when I was young
That anyone could change the world
It wouldn't come by power or strength
But through the ones who choose to love

Cause everyone will pass
And when we've breathed our last
Can we say we have lived for more
And did we live to die for
La-la-love la-love
La-la-love la-love

Can you feel his heart beating
The sound of love is marching
And when our hearts begin to break
Along with his, this world will change

Love is marching to his heartbeat
