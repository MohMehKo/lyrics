I hope you don't mind
That I know your life
Because I read it every day
And all of your faults
Make me feel so good
Because the media stole my brain
It's so nice to have someone tell me what to think
What is it for, do we want more, do we want more?
And on and on it goes 'till all of us are sucked in.
So shut it off and see we're missing out on living

I am so done
Listening to you
Time for you to go
Time for you to go, whoa
I refuse to give one more day to you
Time for you to go, time for you to go, whoa
No more wasting my life on this worlds addiction
Time for me to take you to find your place I'm letting go
Time for you to go

Isn't it nice to know
That the media will sway our votes
'Cause seriously we've got to see
That they choose what we know
Our morals get thrown away
For the next big thing we've got to see
What is it for, do we want more, do we want more?
And on and on it goes till all of us are sucked in
So shut it off and see we're missing out on living

I am so done
Listening to you
Time for you to go, time for you to go
Whoa. I refuse to give one more day to you
Time for you to go, time for you to go, whoa
No more wasting my life on this worlds addiction
Time for me to take you to find your place
I am letting go, time for you to go

We're missing out on His voice
We've traded God for ashes
We've got to think for ourselves
Where's our passion?

I am so done
Listening to you
Time for you to go
Time for you to go, whoa
I refuse to give one more day to you,
Time for you to go, time for you to go, whoa
No more wasting my life on this worlds addiction
Time for me to take you to find your place
I am letting go, time for you to go
