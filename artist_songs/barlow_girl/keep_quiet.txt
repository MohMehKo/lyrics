All the things I've sacrificed
So that I could bring You to this world
I want them to see You in me
But Your name just keeps them far from me
So I'll keep quiet
Let's hope they see I'm different

Jesus, Jesus why's Your name's offensive?
Why are we so scared to tell this world You've saved us
When all of the hope of the world's in Your name
Why are we so scared to say
Oh Jesus

If I avoid to speak Your name
Tell me would You do the same to me
If relevance becomes my goal
Tell me will I lose You to its hold
But, if I keep quiet, they'll never see I'm different

Jesus, Jesus why's Your name's offensive?
Why are we so scared to tell this world You've saved us
When all of the hope of this world's in Your name
Why are we so scared to say
Oh Jesus

I'm sorry I cared about my name more than Yours
I'm so sorry how could I hide You anymore
But if I keep quiet
They'll never see I'm different

Jesus, Jesus why's Your name's offensive?
Why are we so scared to tell this world You've saved us
When all of the hope of the world's in Your name
Why are we so scared to say
Oh, Jesus
