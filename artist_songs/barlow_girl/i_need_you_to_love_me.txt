Why, why are You still here with me 
Didn't You see what I've done? 
In my shame I want to run and hide myself 
But it's here I see the truth 
I don't deserve You 

[Chorus:]
But I need You to love me, and I 
I won't keep my heart from You this time 
And I'll stop this pretending that I can 
Somehow deserve what I already have 
I need You to love me 

I, I have wasted so much time 
Pushing You away from me 
I just never saw how You could cherish me 
'Cause You're a God who has all things 
And still You want me 

Your love makes me forget what I have been 
Your love makes me see who I really am 
Your love makes me forget what I have been
