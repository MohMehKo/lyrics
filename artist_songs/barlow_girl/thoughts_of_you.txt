Thoughts of You and how You changed me 
Fill my mind 
Without You where would I be 

So even though I've tried to express my thanks 
It never comes out how I hoped 
I want to say so much more so with these simple words 
I'll try 

[Chorus:]
I love You 
My heart is Yours, only Yours 
I long to give You all of me 
My everything, my everything 

God I never could repay You 
You gave everything 
Without You where would I be 

You still loved me even when I 
Pushed You away 
You stood there and waited 
Till the day I'd return
