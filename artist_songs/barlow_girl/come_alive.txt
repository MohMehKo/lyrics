Wake up, get out, there's no time to waste now
Never shut up it's our turn to speak out
These streets are dead just waiting to come alive

Break down the doors of our comfortable room
Tear down the walls we never could see through
Aren't we sick of missing out on life

Do we want more?
Tell me do we want more?

'Cause we've heard the cry and we'll come alive
And we fight for love and we live to die
Because a life that holds no meaning
Is like a day without the light
So we'll come alive tonight

All have the call but so few have listened
Life is too short you don't want to miss this
Make up your mind before life passes by

Now is the time to wake up and see this
World won't revolve around you and me
So let's be the change we've all been waiting for

We are the passion
We are the movement
We are the fire
We'll never lose it
