The tension is thick in the air
Making it hard to see
I fear what is to come
And what will become of me
I say a prayer help me not run away
Will you please hold me

And sing me a love song again
Say the words that heal my heart
sing me a love song and then
Let your words remind me who I am

You've never failed me before
Why do I feel betrayed
If I close my heart to you now
The darkness would have its way
I crave your voice help me not fall away
Will you please hold me

'Cause you are all I need
And all that I want is you with me
You are all I need
And all that I want is you with me
