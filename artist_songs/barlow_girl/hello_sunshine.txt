Hello sunshine it's been too long
since I felt your warmth upon my face
And how much have I missed
'Cause I've been focused on everything wrong
This road just felt so long
I forgot to lift my head to see you

Oh my lovely shining for me
Let my eyes see all the beauty
Oh-oh

Hello sunshine since the moment
That I felt your beautiful warmth
I knew that I'd do anything 
To keep this feeling of you
My heart comes alive
Oh who could add a day to this life
By drowning every dark sky

Oh my lovely shining for me
Let my eyes see all the beauty
Oh-oh

Fill my dark skies
Make me see the light
Life is fine so bring in the sunshine
Oh-oh

Whoa-oh let in the sunshine
Whoa-oh let in the sunshine
Whoa-oh let in the sunshine
Let in the sunshine
