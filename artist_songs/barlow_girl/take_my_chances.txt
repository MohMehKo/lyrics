I've bowed out from this and can I say I'm sick 
Now it's time for me to stand up and make you hear me 
This world you rob innocence you never gave us a chance 
We were born believing you had all the answers for me 

Look out you will find out 
That here I am so far from then so 

I take my chances 
I don't live for you 
I'll say what I have to 
I don't care I don't care 
Fears are what I lose 

If we don't speak, who will? 
If we don't fight, we're still 
Stuck without a voice and we are tired of being silenced 

Look out you will find out 
That here I am so far from then so 

I take my chances 
I don't live for you 
I'll say what I have to 
I don't care I don't care 
Fears are what I lose 

We are set apart 
We've been chosen now 
We are children of God 
So what holds us back 
What's holding us back 

I take my chances 
I don't live for you 
I'll say what I have to 
I don't care I don't care 
Fears are what I lose
