I have had the same dreams many times it haunts my mind
It starts with a life but it ends every time
Oh so many faces that this world will never see
A reason for your life but your heart will never beat

May our tears fall down
Let them soften this ground
May our hearts be found
God forgive us now

Oh what have we lost because we chose we'll never know
And loving You is better than feeling alone
And all our claims to freedom have become these heavy chains
And in the name of rights we keep filling nameless graves

Let the tears fall down
Let them soften this ground
Let our hearts be found
God forgive us now

Oooh
