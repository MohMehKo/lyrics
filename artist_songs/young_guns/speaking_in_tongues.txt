I guess I
Thought we were indivisible
Remember when
The distance wasn't insurmountable?

When I get to you, yeah my blood runs cold
'Cuz I don't recognize the person I behold
Underneath the moon, yeah we shake our bones
But I don't understand

[Chorus:]
When you're speaking in tongues
(In tongues)
I can't understand a single word you say
Sex and politics a dangerous game we play
It's all we've ever known
(We've ever known)
(We're speaking in tongues)
Face to face but miles away
(We're speaking in tongues)
I can't find the words to say
(We're speaking in tongues)
You're speaking in tongues
(Hey!)
You're speaking in tongues to me

I confess I
Was never one for waxing lyrical
But the radio
Taunts me with its modern parables

It don't make sense but it's all I know
When you're face down there's still further to go
Underneath the moon yeah we shake our bones
But I don't understand

[Chorus]

I danced with the devil
In the pale moonlight
You've got such a sharp tongue
Cuts me like a knife

I danced with the devil
In the pale moonlight
(O-o-o-oh)
You've got such a sharp tongue
Cuts me like a knife
Oh!

(We're speaking in tongues)
I danced with the devil
(We're speaking in tongues)
I danced with the devil, I
(We're speaking in tongues)
I danced with the devil 
(Hey!)
In the pale moonlight
