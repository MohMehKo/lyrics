I walk these streets with bloodied hands
Looking for the peace I lost
Buried in the sand, we live our lives
On front lines
We are all at war with time

It's what they say, I wouldn't have it any other way
After the war
Nobody comes back the same, when all is said and done
Even though I held no gun
After the war
Nobody feels the same

As long as night still follows day
True are the words all errant fathers say

To love is to lose, but I still refuse to give up hope

It's what they say, I wouldn't have it any other way
After the war
Nobody comes back the same, when all is said and done
Even though I held no gun
After the war
Nobody feels the same

So join me in this pale moonlight
Swear that we won't lose the fight
Dig deeper into the sand, and always swim against the tide
We swear an oath to those who've died
We will never forget

It's what they say, I wouldn't have it any other way
After the war
Nobody comes back the same, when all is said and done
Even though I held no gun
After the war
Nobody feels the same.
