It's twenty below
That I don't feel the cold, anymore.
Though the elements conspire,
To drain me of desire, I move on.

So I have spent so long searching,
Didn't know what I was looking for.

Don't know where I've been,
Much less to where I'm heading.
Led by the impulse that's embedded in my flesh

I have spent so long searching,
Didn't know what I was looking for.
So in love with the horizon that I,
Didn't see night fall

Every ragged breath I feel a little more at peace inside,
(don't let anybody tell you otherwise)
Though the weather rages
No, I never hide
(It's only in the journey that we're really alive)

I have spent so long searching,
Didn't know what I was looking for.
So in love with the horizon that I,
Didn't see night fall

So the weather rages
(No I'll never hide)
Only in the journey are we really alive
