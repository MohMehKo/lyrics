We paint our faces keep the truth deep under cover
We gather round the fire and tell lies to each other
So desperate to feel like we're not getting older now
Spray paint the galleries and spill blood on the alter
Burn down the bridges that we could have crossed together
This ground floor vertigo threatens to pull me under now.

We're suffering from digital pain
We lost the love of life on the way
But ones and zeros just can't explain
There's something in the air when we're together.
[x2]

We wear this war paint to forget what we've discovered
Rather be mirror blind and safe under our armour
Truth is we got nothing if we don't have each other so
Break down the barriers and breath in underwater
When we're together I know we can square the circle so
Let's free each other from this modern day inertia now.

We're suffering from digital pain
We lost the love of life on the way
But ones and zeros just can't explain
There's something in the air when we're together [x2]
Something in the air when we're together.

We're suffering from digital pain
We lost the love of life on the way
But ones and zeros just can't explain
There's something in the air when we're together.
Ones and zeros [x3]
Something in the air when we're together
We're suffering from digital pain
We lost the love of life on the way
But ones and zeros just can't explain
There's something in the air when we're together.
