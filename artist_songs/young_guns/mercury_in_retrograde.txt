Mercury rising
In the dead of night
When I look at you, yeah, I believe I come alive
Now something is different
I see it in your eyes
But you kept undercover
Broke the levee, raised the tide

Desire
Temperature gets higher
Comes down to the wire
It's too late
Mercury in retrograde
Quicksilver, running like a river
It's so cold, we shiver
Sealed our fate
Mercury in retrograde

Everything declines if you give it time
On the walls we wager eventually across the line
'Cause people change and the sky turns black
Then you go so far that you can't go back

Desire
Temperature gets higher
Comes down to the wire
It's too late
Mercury in retrograde
Quicksilver, running like a river
It's so cold, we shiver
Sealed our fate
Mercury in retrograde

As above and so below
People change so it goes

Mercury rising
In the dead of night
When I look at you, yeah, I believe I come alive
Now something is different
I see it in your eyes
You keep it undercover

Desire
Temperature gets higher
Comes down to the wire
It's too late
Mercury in retrograde
Quicksilver, running like a river
It's so cold, we shiver
Sealed our fate
Mercury in retrograde

People change
People change
People change
People change
Mercury's in retrograde
