Shadow I cast, well, it weighs more than my soul
And it's the only proof that I am here at all.
I will comfortably invite you if you promise to accept,
Under no uncertain terms, you'd be second best

So unwind this mortal coil with me,
Cause your darkness is a light to me.

All of my colour is bleeding away,
So now you watch me fade into the endless grey,
Into the endless grey.

I keep the inevitable at arms length
Pushing back with all my strength,
But it's not enough.

While my heart collapses like old clay,
Heed my warning, stay away.

All of my colour is bleeding away,
So now you watch me fade into the endless grey,
Into the endless grey.

All of my colour is bleeding away,
So now you watch me fade into the endless grey,
All of my colour is bleeding away,
So now I walk alone into the endless grey
Into the endless grey.
