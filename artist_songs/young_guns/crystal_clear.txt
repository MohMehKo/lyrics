Once when I was young,
That I could one day hold the world right as it spun,
Yeah that was the plan
Now it, seems as though I've made a mess of everything I've ever done

Could I forget it all?
Follow the setting sun...

It's crystal clear to me
That I've been killing time
Nothing's going to stand in my way
No I'm not done,
Even if the sun sets I will start a fire
To change your mind

A scar is just a mark,
Not a burden but a start of something new
Even stars in the end fade,
Given time coast lines will change so why won't you?

Could I forget it all?
I've lost teeth, failed every test,
My broken heart's the only thing of value I have left.

It's crystal clear to me
That I've been killing time
Nothing's going to stand in my way
Cos I'm not done,
Even if the sun sets I will start a fire
To change your mind

You will see me in the dark,
Burning brighter than the stars
Wanna fight the motion of the setting sun,
I hold my head up high cos I'm still here.

Crystal clear to me,
That I've been killing time
Nothing's gonna stand in my way
No I'm not done,
Even if the sun sets I will start a fire
To change your mind

It's crystal clear to me
It's crystal clear to me
I'm not done even if the sun sets I will start a fire,
To change your mind.
No I'm not done
