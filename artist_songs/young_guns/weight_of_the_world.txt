A continent of doubt weighs heavy on mind,
How long can my brittle bones bend,
Before they yield and snap?

I don't wanna know, 'cause I'm so scared,
It's not gonna get easier than this,
Because it's too much to bare my darlin', the weight of the world,
And I would carry it for you,
But please don't ask me to because the
Weight of the world is a burden I can't bare.
Is a burden I can't bare.

Maybe it's gravity, that pulls her to my chest,
Not the fear that she is the source of what little strength I've got left,

I don't wanna know, 'cause I'm so scared,
It's not gonna get easier than this
Because it's too much to bare my darlin', the weight of the world,
I would carry it for you,
But please don't ask me to because the
Weight of the world is a burden I can't bare.

My horizon lies a jagged line,
Ooh I can clearly see,
The mountains that I've yet to climb,
I'll get there if it kills me.

Because it's too much to bare my darlin',
The weight of the world,
And I would carry it for you,
But please don't ask me to because the
Weight of the world is a burden I cant bare.
Is a burden I can't bear.
And I would carry it for you,
But please don't ask me to,
Because the,
Weight of the world,
Is a burden I can't bare.
