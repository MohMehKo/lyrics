I had a conversation with a dying man
He said 'Son, make sure you live while you still can'
Said I can lie to the rules of war and I can swim the seas
He said, 'Boy, oh you know not what you have'

Now I lay on my bed waiting
Those words resound in my head
Now I remember he told me
'You'll see when everything ends'

I had a conversation with a dying man
Till I pass it by, your love becomes an eye
The worst path to follow, swallowed by the sea
You said 'so? enjoy it while you can'
Now I lay on my bed waiting
Those words resound in my head
Now I remember he told me
'You'll see when everything ends'

Now I remember he told me
'You'll see when everything ends'

(Everything ends)
(Everything ends)
(Everything ends)

I don't think they'll walk with us anymore

Now I lay on my bed waiting
Those words resound in my head
Now I remember he told me
'You'll see when everything ends'

I had a conversation with a dying man
He said 'Son, make sure you live while you still can'
