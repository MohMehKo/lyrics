On and on it echoes
Moths trapped in molasses left for dead
No mementos
Just memories like water off the edge
Existing below
Spin the totem and pray it doesn't slow
Hard to let go
Watch it rot 'til nothing's left
'Til nothing's left

Echoes fade
I will never be the same
I'm longing for our yesterday
When all the echoes fade away, fade away
Fade away

On and on it echoes
Memories they flicker in my head
Hard to let go
I follow like a lamb to slaughter led
Time moves so slow
Recite our verses
Poems for the dead
Hard to let go
Watch it rot 'til nothing's left
'Til nothing's left

Echoes fade
I will never be the same
I'm longing for our yesterday
When all the echoes fade away
I wish I could change
I never found the words to say
You're beautiful when you decay
When all the echoes fade away, fade away

Stop looking for forevermore
Exist in your own moment not theirs
Accept the fact you're not responsible
For everything
Deep down I know that I've been there before
And I'll be there again

Echoes fade
I will never be the same
I'm longing for our yesterday
When all the echoes fade away
I wish I could change
I never found the words to say
You're beautiful when you decay
When all the echoes fade away, fade away
Fade away
