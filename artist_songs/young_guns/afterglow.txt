Long ago before turbulence took hold
We would roam these city streets with paper planes we used to dream
And now you want everything cause you don't know what you've got
I promise, you mark my words
You will when it's gone

We get high, we get low
Searching for afterglow
But tonight save us all
Take me, typical
It's hard to accept the things we can't control
We get high, we get low
Searching for afterglow

Hard to float
With pockets full of stone
We forget our lessons learned
And settle for the life we think we burn
Not everything ends up how we plan
But everyone that crossed our path
Helps us understand

We get high, we get low
Searching for afterglow
But tonight save us all
Take me, typical
It's hard to accept the things we can't control
We get high, we get low
Searching for afterglow

The sun will set on all of us
Instant peaks will turn to dust
I know so much we can't control
I don't want to live in fear
Break us off
What I'm missing no more
Sometimes we need light
We'll be searching for the afterglow

We get high, we get low
Searching for afterglow
But tonight save us all
Take me, typical
It's hard to accept the things we can't control
We get high, we get low
Searching for afterglow

Afterglow...
