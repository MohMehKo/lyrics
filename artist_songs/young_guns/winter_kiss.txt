Every night I hold a vigil
Is another spent in vain,
I never thought I'd find religion, baby,
Oh god, save me from this pain

I want to sleep, but I hear voices,
(Calling out)
I hear them calling out to me,
This winter kiss has left me poisoned
(Left me here)
And I will never be the same again

The devil you know is better than the ghost you don't,
So I sit and the scan the frequencies,
Watch the falling snow,
I'm still searching,
For a sign,
That you're still listening,
But the voice I hear is mine
(I will let you down, to love me is to drown)

I want to sleep, but I hear voices,
(Calling out)
I hear them calling out to me,
This winter kiss has left me poisoned
(Left me here)
And I will never be the same again

A distress call to one and all,
Can you hear me? Please respond,
'Cause I'm searching for a sign of life,
But all I hear is white noise...

I want to sleep, but I hear voices,
(Calling out)
I hear them calling out to me,
This winter kiss has left me poisoned
(Left me here)
And I will never be the same again
