Out of time
Out of place
Hate the people we've become
In the cold
We embraced
Tell me where did we go wrong
Should have known
From the start
You'd leave me in the dark
Then I found
A spark
So tonight I'll start a fire

You're
Nothing like I ever knew
Somehow
You can't see I'm bulletproof
So I took the long road
Went the distance
To the bitter end
Oh can't you see I'm bulletproof

I was blind
To my fate
Walked the line and now I run
Cos I see
My mistake
Why did I let down my guard
Should have known
From the start
Like a shot right through my heart
I ignite
The spark
Just to find out who you are

You're
Nothing like I ever knew
Somehow
You can't see I'm bulletproof
So I took the long road
Went the distance
To the bitter end
Can't you see I'm bulletproof

Take it back
Take it back
Now I'm under attack
I can't believe I ever loved you
Sometimes we have
To face things
On our own

You're
Nothing like I ever knew
Somehow
You can't see I'm bulletproof
So I took the long road
Went the distance
To the bitter end
Can't you see I'm bulletproof

So take your best shot
Is that the best you've got?

I can't believe I ever loved you
