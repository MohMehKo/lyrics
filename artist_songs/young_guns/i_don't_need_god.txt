I sit here all alone in the church that we built
A symphony of sighs in the air
I fall on the sword to kiss the hilt
I don't feel a thing
Been excavating broken dreams
Tried to fix these crooked wings
Anything to get back to my true north
It don't matter now

This love's unstoppable
Impossible
Better off dead than entombed
Feels so illogical
Don't care at all
I don't need God I need you
Finally I'm slipping under
Truth be told I don't mind
When I'm drowing in your wonder
I can't feel it

This loves unstoppable
Impossible
Better off dead than entombed

Like roses on a grave
We were bright now we wilt
Though I exist
I endure
I still
I don't feel a thing

How strange the things we fear the most
Are always those we can control
I do whatever you want but it's never enough
It don't matter now

This love's unstoppable
Impossible
Better off dead than entombed
Feels so illogical
Don't care at all
I don't need God I need you
Finally I'm slipping under
Truth be told I don't mind
When I'm drowing in your wonder
I can't feel it
This love's unstoppable
impossible
better off dead than entombed
This love's unstoppable
Impossible
Better off dead than entombed

Feels so illogical
Don't care at all
I don't need God I need you
Finally I'm slipping under
Truth be told I don't mind
When I'm drowing in your wonder
I can't feel it
This love's unstoppable
impossible
better off dead than entombed
