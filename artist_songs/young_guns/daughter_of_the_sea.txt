Seems I'm exposed
Split in two a fault line cut right through me, 
Between my heart and my feet,
There's an apathy that I can't find my way around, 
But i can feel I'm getting nearer, 
I know that soon I'll be delivered.

I'm overboard, 
And I can't swim, 
God only knows, 
Why I let you in, 
You and me, 
And the siren songs you sing, 
I'm coming home

Man I'm deep, 
I'm drifting lost within myself, 
Cos I'm in league,
I'm in a tryst with the daughter of the sea,
And she will have her way with me, 

I'm overboard, 
And I can't swim, 
God only knows why I let you in, 
You and me, 
And the siren songs you sing, 
You've taken hold over me,

The anchor in my chest,
Begs me to stop,
Rest my limbs and go to sleep,
And as the waves crash down,
My ears ring with the sound,
The promise of the deep,

So say what you mean,
OR don't say anything,
Cos all I really want,
Is a place to close my eyes,

I'm overboard, 
And I can't swim, 
God only knows, 
Why I let you in, 
You and me, 
And the siren songs you sing,
So let the waves rush over me.
