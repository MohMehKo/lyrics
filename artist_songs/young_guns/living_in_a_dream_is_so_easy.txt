I spent forever searching when I had no need to
Kept trying to find myself in you
And now I finally see the thing that you could
Sometimes you're better off without

The end doesn't always justify the means

Honestly, no, I'm not quite sure that you ever understood a word
Ever understood a word
It's alright
All the lies we told
'Cause honesty is often worse

In my experience the truth is overrated
Our house of cards could never last
You're always misleading and undeceiving
Down to repeating the past

And the end doesn't always justify the means

Honestly, no, I'm not that sure that you ever understood a word
Ever understood a word
It's alright
All the lies we told
'Cause honesty is off the books
Honestly it often hurts

But living in a dream is so easy
Honesty is off the books
Yeah, living in a dream is so easy

It's time to tell the truth
The scene will fade to black
You never really loved what you never had
This is our final act
'Cause I just wanna feel
I know it hurts, but at least this pain is real

No, I'm not quite sure that you ever understood a word
Ever understood a word
It's alright
All the lies we told
'Cause honesty is off the books
Honestly it often hurts

But living in a dream is so easy
Honesty is off the books
Well, living in a dream was so easy
Honesty is off the books
Honesty is off the books
