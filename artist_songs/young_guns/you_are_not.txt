Lonely, lonely, undefined
You say you take your time,
I say you hide away

Lonely, lonely hard to shine
When they don't notice you at all
Sink further every day

You're only so lonely
And I never had a doubt,
You don't even know me
Still you pass your judgement out
When you belong
You're just a face in the crowd,
You're only lonely so lonely, like everybody else

Lonely, lonely, little fly
You say they pay you no mind
I say there's a better way
You hang yourself in your web
Drawn and quartered out
The more you hurt
The more you heal,
The more you'll figure out

You're only so lonely
And I never had a doubt,
You don't even know me
Still you pass your judgement out
When you belong
You're just a face in the crowd,
You're only lonely so lonely, like everybody else

You are not a diamond,
You are not a shining star
Doesn't mean that you're not perfect
Exactly as you are

You're only so lonely
And I never had a doubt,
You don't even know me
Still you pass your judgement out
When you belong
You're just a face in the crowd,
You're only lonely so lonely, like everybody else

You are not a diamond,
You are not a shining star
Doesn't mean that you're not perfect
Exactly as you are
