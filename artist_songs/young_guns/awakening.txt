I can't feel a thing
Hear the drop of a pin
Uncomfortably numb
Each day blends into one
My mouth is sewed shut
Soon breathing will stop
No air in my lungs
Oh, God, what have I done?

Colors are only in my memories
Something between this beat in front of me
Most of my life I spent hypnotized
No, I'm waking up
Yeah, I'm waking up

While you sleep safe in your dreams
What goes up, it must come down
(No rest for the wicked, no rest for the wicked)
And my soul's taken its toll
This is my awakening
(No rest for the wicked, no rest for the wicked)

Vision's blurred
I can't quench my thirst
The clock's counting down
I'm deafened by the sound
Breaking the surface finally
To calling the message inside me
The only one you can rely upon is you and yourself

Colors are only in my memories
Something else feels, it's beating in front of me

While you sleep safe in your dreams
What goes up, it must come down
(No rest for the wicked, no rest for the wicked)
And my soul's taken its toll
This is my awakening
(No rest for the wicked, no rest for the wicked)

I found the worst in me
No hope, no honesty
The feeling's self-paralyze
Destroy the kings and queen
You were the lock and key
Up here and down these lines
I'm waking up asleep

While you sleep safe in your dreams
What goes up, it must come down
(No rest for the wicked, no rest for the wicked)
And my soul's taken its toll
This is my awakening
(No rest for the wicked, no rest for the wicked)
And my soul's taken its toll
This is my awakening
(No rest for the wicked, no rest for the wicked)

No rest for the wicked
No rest for the wicked
No rest for the wicked
