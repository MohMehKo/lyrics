I'm always on the run
From all the things I've never done
But I can never escape

Fluid in my lungs
I've been treading water for so damn long

You burn the books you never read
Because of what you think they said

I'm not dead on arrival
Though I'm up against the ropes
So I'll stare into the darkness
Just to see how deep it goes

Neon and silhouettes
Stare at the light and not yourself
Seems we don't bury our dead

We watch but we don't learn
Entertained but unconcerned
And unaware

You burn the books you never read
Because of what you think they said

But I'm not dead on arrival
Though I'm up against the ropes
So I'll stare into the darkness
Just to see how deep it goes

We're told to watch others live our dreams
So we all sit staring at the screens
The numbing warmth of the neon blue
Can't give me something to hold on to

I'm not dead on arrival
Though I'm up against the ropes
So I'll stare into the darkness
Just to see how deep it goes.
