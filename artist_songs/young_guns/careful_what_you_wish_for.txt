In the days, I run red lights
Try to outrun the afterlife, but I froze
See you standing in the cold
And now we crash in a moment of passion
Yeah, we create an infinite destruction
Oh, you inspire me to get higher

Careful what you wish for
There's no turning back
There's no escape
Devils and details
Don't let the fire cut like a flame
Careful what you wish for
There's no turning back
There's no escape
Devils and details
Too much of heaven can hurt like hell

I sold my soul
I made a pact
With fingers crossed behind my back
I've lost all of my self-control
Ooh, I know my walls are turning in a second
Can't defy into a lesson
But it's a hard way
I let my heart break, yeah yeah yeah

Careful what you wish for
There's no turning back
There's no escape
Devils and details
Don't let the fire cut like a flame
Careful what you wish for
There's no turning back
There's no escape
Devils and details
Too much of heaven can hurt like hell

Hurts like hell
Hurts like hell

I sold my soul
I made a pact
With fingers crossed behind my back
Too much of heaven can hurt like hell
Too much of heaven can hurt like hell

Careful what you wish for
There's no turning back
There's no escape
Devils and details
Don't let the fire cut like a flame
Careful what you wish for
There's no turning back
There's no escape
Devils and details
Too much of heaven can hurt like hell

It hurts like hell
