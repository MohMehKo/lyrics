Standing on the edge, watching traffic pass
And these rivers of broken glass
Everybody wants to believe
There's something more to this
Yet to hear the word of a higher power
From the streets to the tallest tower
Haunted by the questions unanswered
My world begins to spin

Oh, and when it starts to light up
It hits me like an atom bomb
Oh, and sometimes that's enough
To free me from the undertow
This is where I belong

And all these city lights
Another endless night
Full of all possibilities
Raise your glass to eternity
I never felt so high
It's never been this right
And it's all about you and me
From tonight to infinity

It's easy to feel small when the world's so big
Like a puzzle piece that doesn't fit
Everybody's looking for something
To show them how to live

Oh, and when it starts to light up
The darkest corners of my soul
Oh, no hell or high water
Can keep me from euphoria
This is where I belong

And all these city lights
Another endless night
Full of all possibilities
Raise your glass to eternity
I never felt so high
It's never been this right
And it's all about you and me
From tonight to infinity

Oh it's you and me
Tonight to infinity
[x2]
This is where I belong

And all these city lights
Another endless night
Full of all possibilities
Raise your glass to eternity
I never felt so high
It's never been this right
And it's all about you and me
From tonight to infinity, ohh
