All eyes on me
What they see is not reality
I know I feel so incomplete
How is everyone else so fully realized

Oh, my mind plays tricks on me
Yet I'm not who I used to be
I can't recall, oh no

Take me away
Everyone's watching you
I know what it's like
I'm afraid
We're the same
We're lost can't hide the truth
I'm paranoid and so are you
Paranoid and so are you

It takes from me
This anxietyâ€”it leaves you hollowed out
I'm filling up with doubt
With all the parts that I left out
'Cause somewhere along the way I forgot just how to say

I know where I belong
I'm all the rights that I made wrong
They don't define me no more

Take me away
Everyone's watching you
I know what it's like
I'm afraid
We're the same
We're lost can't hide the truth
I'm paranoid and so are you
Paranoid and so are you

Look at you
Are you afraid?
They won't like what they see, oh
They're gonna get you
I know we're both the same
We're both the same
So don't be afraid

Take me away
Everyone's watching you
I know what it's like
I'm afraid
We're the same
We're lost can't hide the truth
I'm paranoid and so are you

I'm paranoid
We're lost can't hide the truth
I'm paranoid and so are you
Paranoid
We're lost can't hide the truth
I'm paranoid and so are you
