White light
Slowly pulls me under
Tattoos close my eyes
Your room is tainted with regret
Spreading the boxes underneath your bed
I can't help but wonder
If it's worth the fight
Do we get what we deserve?

What are you hiding?
Bury it down so easily
Save the last rights on a eulogy
Just bury it down, bury it down, bury me
Bury it down, bury it down, bury me

Why hide?
Watch you push me under
I won't change my mind
The final chapter I'll forget
Down the pages that I never wrote
I'll listen to my heart
Down here in the dark

What are you hiding?
Bury it down so easily
Save the last rights on a eulogy
Just bury it down, so we can't be seen
If we're not meant to be
Don't stand on ceremony
Lowered in the ground, so I can't be free
Bury me down, bury me down, bury me

Now I know for what it's worth
In every death there is a birth
So why don't you lower me down?
Every end there is a start
I'll listen to my beating heart
I know I'll find my way out

What are you hiding?
Bury it down so easily
Save the last rights on a eulogy
Just bury it down, so we can't be seen
If we're not meant to be
Don't stand on [?]
Lowered in the ground, so I can't be free
Bury me down, bury me down, bury me

Lower me down far away out to bury me
Lower me down far away out to bury me
