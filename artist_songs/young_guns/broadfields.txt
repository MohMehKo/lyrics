I used to hear the melody
The voice only I know
The rhythm and the rain
Beating down my window

It's clear to me that I can see
Through each and every pain
That I grew up and I forgot
To feel the way again

I've been lost by the city
Drowned by the sea
I've been up on the rooftops
Still I'm caving in

You can scream bloody murder
Loud as you want
I'm not listening now

Sing me something
To bring me down
Cos I can't find anything
Like that town

I don't need it anymore
Oooohhh
I let my heart break in the broadfields
It's the look between the fences
My hand unto the bridge
I swore that I would understand
The whispers in the trees

But the older I got
The more I felt at loss
Now I'm run through with rut

Covered in frost
I had wondered so low
Now that I'm here
I just wanna go home

Sing me something
To bring me down
Cos I can't find anything
Like that town

I don't need it anymore
Oooohhh
I let my heart break in the broadfields

Rain! Rain! Rain!
Carry me home
Wash away the...
Pain! Pain!
Shame that I've come to know

Rain! Rain! Rain!
Carry me home
Wash away the...
Pain! Pain!
Shame that I've come to know

I think that it's time
I think that it's time
I don't know.
