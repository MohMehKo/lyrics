He's not sure if he can win
The dice alone it barely spins
Another hand and then he'll quit
Take it all, I don't need it
You're born to lose
It's best to stick to what you know

Something's wrong in paradise
Leave the world behind tonight
Cause nothing's ever black and white
Because something's wrong in paradise
Something's wrong in paradise
Something's wrong in paradise

Only part of her exists
She's seen the way things turn to mist
So lift the veil and ride it out
Show me what you're thinking of
I'm alive, but I'm not sure if I have lived

Something's wrong in paradise
Leave the world behind tonight
Because nothing's ever black and white
Because something's wrong in paradise
Something's wrong in paradise
Something's wrong in paradise

No not every time is the same
Over complicate all these games
And we're all so terrified of change
But no one's fate would be to stay the same

Something's wrong in paradise
Leave the world behind tonight
Because nothing's ever black and white
Because something's wrong in paradise
Something's wrong in paradise (paradise, paradise)
Something's wrong in paradise (paradise, paradise)
Something's wrong in paradise
