Yeah I need meaning
As much as I need air to fill these old lungs of mine
I didn't notice but I've been holding my breath as long as I've been alive

The spots behind my eyes they glitter in the dark
As they get closer they illuminate their mark (woah)

Everybody stares into the headlights bearing down
But we don't care, standing in the glare
We didn't see them coming, headlights closing in

Everybody stares

Through my fingers everything was monotone and weak
Now all the colour brings me to my knees
I was so afraid of repeating myself
That I never said anything at all
The spots behind my eyes they glitter in the dark
As they get closer they illuminate their mark (woah)

Everybody stares into the headlights bearing down
But we don't care, standing in the glare
We didn't see them coming, headlights closing in

(I found you)
You give me meaning
In everything you do,
(I found you)
Now I've discovered
What I have got to do,

I'm broken and I'm bruised
I'm beaten black and blue,
Split at the seams but so are you

Woah

If you take me as I am, bitter and bland
I'd face the headlights, side by side with you

Headlights
Headlights
(Woah)

Headlights
Headlights
(Woah)

Headlights
Headlights
(Woah)
