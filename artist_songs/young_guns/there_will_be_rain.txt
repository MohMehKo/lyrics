When I was a kid
I filled bottles with messages of hope,
Now we kept clutching broken glass,
'Cos all my questions have been answered by a flood,
Even those I never asked.

All the storms that I've seen,
Are countless reasons not to believe.
But I know, that as long as there will be rain,
There will be clear skies after.

Every day under the sky,
I stood arms raised in imitation,
Watching birds in flight,
And now I'm older,
Youth has past me by,
But I keep reaching 'til I get what's mine.

All the storms, that I've seen,
Are countless reasons not to believe.
But I know, that as long as there will be rain,
There will be clear skies after.

No matter how far I go (far I go)
I know that you are by my side (by my side)
Together we'll see this through (see this through)
There's silence in our lives.

All the storms, that I've seen,
Are countless reasons not to believe,
But I know, that as long as there will be rain,
There will be clear skies after.

There will be rain,
There will be clear skies after.
There will be rain,
There will be clear skies after.
