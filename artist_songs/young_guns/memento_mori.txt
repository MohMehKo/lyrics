In my heart I feel a change
What once was now looks so strange
You're out at sea and I'm ashore
These wounds don't seem to wait
If you're a fist I'm a window pane
Like the moon we wax and wane

She says we're not gonna make it
This night is fading just like a photograph
It's bittersweet but I'll take it
They say that some things
Are just not meant to last
This night's fading like a photograph
This night's fading like a photograph
This night's fading like a photograph
Some things just aren't meant to last

Oh I constantly explain
You're the mist I'm the pouring rain
And slowly we evaporate
In these tombs I seal away
Precious little that still remains
To never see the light of day

She says we're not gonna make it
This night is fading just like a photograph
It's bittersweet but I'll take it
They say that some things
Are just not meant to last
This night's fading like a photograph
This night's fading like a photograph
This night's fading like a photograph
Some things just aren't meant to last

She says memento mori
Tonight ignore the warnings
We could be dead by morning
And I'm fading like a photograph
And I'm fading like a photograph

She says we're not gonna make it
This night is fading just like a photograph
It's bittersweet but I'll take it
They say that some things
Are just not meant to last
This night's fading like a photograph
This night's fading like a photograph
This night's fading like a photograph
Some things just aren't meant to last
