I carry my mistakes
And she carries them too
When all I see are bruises black
She shows me the blue

I remember the tears in the morning
The dread of the veil gently falling to the floor

'Cause I'll never know divinity
So inadequately I write
In meter and verse
She believes in God
But I believe in her

When my ship has run its course
She steers me back out to the sea
She won't let me run aground

I've seen the storms she's met
I've seen the tears in secret shed
She sees me as an eagle, though I am just a crow
She sees me as a diamond though I'm just a weathered stone

'Cause I'll never know divinity
So inadequately I write
In meter and verse
She believes in God
But I believe in her

I stole a glimpse of you in pain
I'll take the image to my grave
You look towards the heavens, and I look up to you
I kneel because there are no words
An act will have to do

She believes in God, but I believe in...
No divinity
So inadequately I write
In meter and verse
She believes in God
But I believe in her
