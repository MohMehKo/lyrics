It's a mad, mad, mad, mad world

Feel the smoke in the air
There's a flash of lightning and despair
But no-one cares
Broken glass turned to sand
Every road we built to promised lands
They lead nowhere

Ashes to ashes
Dust to dust
When you're on your own
Who do you trust

Trust your enemies
Worship the weak
We'll be okay
Shoot before you think
Take everything
It's a mad, mad, mad, mad world

It's a dream, it's a lie
It's a matter of fact
No more questions allowed
No more pushing back
Double think if you like if it helps you survive
There's no doubt in our mind 'til we open our eyes
Do we care when there is so much fear in the air
We feel it, we breath it everywhere

Ashes to ashes
Dust to dust
When you're on your own
Who do you trust

Trust your enemies
Worship the weak
We'll be okay
Shoot before you think
Take everything
It's a mad, mad, mad, mad world

Mad, mad, mad, mad world
Mad, mad, mad, mad world
Yeah

Trust your enemies
Worship the weak
We'll be okay
Shoot before you think
Take everything
Trust your enemies
Worship the weak
We'll be okay
Shoot before you think
Take everything
It's a mad mad mad mad world
