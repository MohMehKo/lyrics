I've been colourblind
Trapped in black and white
Built these walls so high
Kept myself inside
'Aint there more than this?
Ignorance is bliss
I'm going out of my mind
Wish that I could just climb
Yeah what's on the outside could it be different
I've got to know
I'm climbing up the walls
Can't be worse than what's inside

I don't know how it ends no
Don't know how it ends no
But this is how it starts tonight

I don't know how it ends no but it starts tonight
You're thinking black and white
Black and white
Stop
Stop thinking start seeing a new colour
You're thinking black and white
Black and white
Stop
Stop thinking start seeing in colour

Yeah it's dangerous outside safer undercover
It's a risk but if I climb could discover
technicolour
Seeing in black and white only gets you so far

I don't know how it ends no
Don't know how it ends no
But this is how it starts tonight

I don't know how it ends no but it starts tonight
Yeah the walls we build to keep us safe
Just keep us on our own
I don't know how it ends no but it starts tonight

You're thinking black and white
Black and white
Stop
Stop thinking start seeing new colour
You're thinking black and white
Black and white
Stop
Stop thinking start seeing a new colour

I don't know how it ends no
Don't know how it ends no
But this is how it starts tonight
I don't know how it ends no but it starts tonight

Yeah the walls we build to keep us safe
Just keep us on our own
I don't know how it ends no but it starts tonight
