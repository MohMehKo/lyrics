I see the vultures over head (over head)
They're circling for the waking dead (waking dead)
Walking the line
Mile after mile
Seems so much further than I ever thought
Have I lost my way?

So I stand at the gates,
Screaming "I am not afraid"
But there's, no-one listening to me.
Oh I know I'm to blame
For my hands amongst the flames
I just want to feel alive

As I stumble down this unlit road (unlit road)
My legs buckle underneath the load (the load)
Oh it twists and turns, my muscles burn
I keep on going to stop me from thinking
That I've lost my way

So I stand at the gates,
Screaming "I am not afraid"
But there's, no-one listening to me.
Oh I know I'm to blame
For my hands amongst the flames
I just want to feel alive

March on, march on
Until I'm at the gates
March on, march on

So I stand at the gates,
Screaming "I am not afraid"
But there's, no-one listening to me.
Oh I know I'm to blame
For my hands amongst the flames
I just want to feel alive

(I feel alive)
March on, march on
(I feel alive)
March on, march on
(I feel alive)
March on, march on
(I feel alive)
March on, march on
