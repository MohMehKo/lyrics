Turn the lights down low
and let the DJ go
until the speakers blow
stay up till the break of dawn!

Take a sip of Jack
you need a sip of that
there ain't no turning back

[Chorus]
Hey! I don't care
I don't care
Whenever there's a party
I'm the first one with a drink in the air
put em up, put em up!
We can share
Yeah!
Cause when we finish this one 
there will be another bottle right here!

Heeeeeey [8x]

When the basses low
you work it nice and slow
you let your body go
shake it till the break of dawn!

You can take a shot
of anything they got
they tryin' to table top
But

[Chorus]
Hey! I don't care
I don't care
Whenever there's a party
I'm the first one with a drink in the air
put em up, put em up!
We can share
Yeah!
Cause when we finish this one 
there will be another bottle right here!

Heeeeeey [8x]

We don't want this night to end
we wont sleep
that we'll do it again
