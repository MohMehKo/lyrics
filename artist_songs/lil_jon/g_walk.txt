[Lil Jon:]
Let me see you throw your motherfuckin' sets up (in the sky)
Throw your motherfucking rags out (wave em' high)
Pussy niggas keep on eyein' me (you wanna die)
I got shawty them in your deep (they gonna ride)
Bitch we too cruck to try to dance (I got that thang)
It's right here on my side (don't make me pay)
You must not know where the fuck we from (pick a side)
Eastside to the West nigga (and we don't hide)

[Soulja Boy:]
G walkin' through the club
Haters gettin' that mug
I gave your bit*h a hug
And she got wetter than a tub
I'm hot nigga (I'm hot nigga)
G walkin' on yo block nigga
80 grand spent, tell the jewler make my watch bigger
Soulja Boy blowed up like a fuckin' ball
All I need is ten minutes in a club with Lil Jon
Get my goons in this bit*h, so shawty don't press yo luck
Chairs flyin' in the club, quack, quack, bit*h you better duck

[Chorus:]
Swag to the left, swag to the right
Soulja Boy and Lil Jon gettin' crunk all night
G walkin' with the realest with some pants on
Tell everybody in the club, turn their motherfuckin' swag on
G walk do it (G walk nigga, gangsta walk nigga)
G walk do it (G walk nigga, gangsta walk nigga)

[Soulja Boy:]
We not playin' boy, I'm not playin' hoe
Fuck swag, bitch I got mojo
No homo, I got them thangs cocked
25 bans all wrapped in one not
Soulja Boy shawty, let arm, right arm shawty
27 tattoos shawty
Walk inside the party
Polo on my body
G walkin', all my goons get retarted (look)

[Lil Jon:]
I don't give a fuck
Yeah that's what's up
Thank you too tough
You get touched up
I sick a hoe on ya, you get sucked up
She let them goons in, that's how you're fucked up
But it don't even matter
Fuck that little chatter
I'm in the club with it, I make them niggas splatter
I shake them bottles up, we make that liquor slpatter
Cause I'm a crunk nigga and it don't even matter

[Chorus:]
Swag to the left, swag to the right
Soulja Boy and Lil Jon gettin' crunk all night
G walkin' with the realest with some pants on
Tell everybody in the club, turn their motherfuckin' swag on
G walk do it (G walk nigga, gangsta walk nigga)
G walk do it (G walk nigga, gangsta walk nigga)
