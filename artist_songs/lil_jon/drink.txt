First off Imma proud of this
I walk in the club with the counts bitch
Straighten up you gotta focus this
My glass half empty, pour some shit
Matter of fact go ahead and drink that
Couple more shots, they wake Africa
I peep that, now I need that
You can pussy like a record, go ahead and leak that
Is real fool to do up in the blaze
Party rock rule we doin bout the case
Champagne is like a players mades
When a girl's act naughty and spray 'em up in the face
Yeah, it feels like college
I'll be the dude walking around with the beer goggles
We surrounded by miles and it looks like 4th of July when they bring them bottles

Take the bottle to the head and one fucking more
