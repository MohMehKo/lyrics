[Jay Sean:]
I was lost
I was frozen
Walking down the streets alone
When I saw this place was open, tonight
And the girls they were rocking
And the alcohol was flowing
And I knew right away this was my life
Oh what a night,
Oh what a night,
Oh what a night

[Lil Jon:]
Feels so good
Feels so right
Let's make a toast
To the night
It's gonna get crazy
So hold on tight
Let's have a ball
Live your life
Let it go
Let it loose
Release it all
No excuse
Have no cares
Have no fears
Let's act a fool
Up in here

[Claude Kelly:]
I was lost
I was frozen
Walking down the streets alone
When I saw this place was open, tonight
And the girls they were rocking
And the alcohol was flowing
And I knew right away this was my life
Oh what a night,
Night [x8]

[Lil Jon:]
A lot of smoking
A lot of drinking
A lot of singing
A lot of dancing
A lot of freaking
A lot of women
A lot of kissing
A lot of sinning

[Jay Sean:]
I was lost
I was frozen
Walking down the streets alone when
I saw this place was open, tonight
And the girls
They were rocking
And the alcohol was flowing
And I knew right away this was my life
Oh what a night
Oh what a night
Oh what a night

[Lil Jon:]
What a night

[Claude Kelly:]
Night
