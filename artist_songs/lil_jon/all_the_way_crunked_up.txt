All the way crunked up
That's my middle name

I'mma do my thang
I'm staying in my lane
I'm staying in the trunk
They know of I'm off da chain
They know the Pastor CRUNK!!
Waka Waka Flock go and get the glock
Niggas think they're hot
Why don't you take me to their spot
I got ammunition
I'mma act a fool
Any competition
Bend them with the tool
P.T. on the cruise if you reppin' be or not
I'm drinkin' double shots
Tryina' straighten up my knock

You know that we crunked up!

Felt like 20 could un nigga WHAT?!
Horse shit back
Headed for my back
Crunked to the max and my dreads gone wild

Struggling like I'm frenzy
