Yeah she straight out da hood wit the ghetto class
Pretty ol' face and a fat ol' ass
Got her own money but she love to ball
Said she can't wait for a thug to call
She don't post much, got these hoes confused
She got wit a winner y'all chose to lose
Pretty ass face big bottle of booze
Rollin' up j's, sippin Bud Light brews
Oh yeah she look good wit da tights on
And she love to fuck a nigga wit da lights on
Yeah she love to fuck a nigga wit da lights on
She love to fuck a nigga wit da lights on

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Okay, we boo bop and par-tay
I guess you would say I'm Dr. Bombay
Tryin' to find some peace of mind
What spots my eye, a cutie pie
My time is yours if you want it
We can get loose, get right or get blunted
We'll be kickin' it, diggin' it
Body on baby so igggg-a-nent
I wanna borrow you
But I'll have you back home by tomorrow boo
Eloquent, delicate
You da subject, I'm ya predicate
Let it in, set it in
I wanna see how wet it get
Freak by nature
Do what I did to amaze ya
4 nuts, doughnuts, glaze ya
Non-argumentive
You lookin' at the Dogg so I know I'm a get it
Time will reveal
Rhyme wit a skill
On time what a deal
I'm smokin' on some Buddha Tie
Just me and my cutie pie
This is the melody
One way, one day, let it be
Just you and me
Cutie pie
