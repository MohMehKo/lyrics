Bend over, won't you pop that pussy for me [x4]
Pop that pussy and shake that ass [x4]
Big old booty, now make it bounce
Pop that pussy, let it all hang out
Bend over, a let me see it
Go ahead bitch, get straight busy
Hey, when they go
Go with it like a motherfucking red truck
Let yourself go
Bend over, make your knee touch your elbow
Like a motherfucking freak hoe
Play with it like a dildo
Prob hot like some chicken wings
Hey, a do the damn thing
Fuck them hoes, they can't hang
Do it, that be sticky girl, you so damn freaky girl
Twirk your thing
No draws, motherfucker G-strings
Bend over, won't you pop that pussy for me [x4]
Pop that pussy and shake that ass [x4]
Don't grind on that thing, wind on that thing
Get up on a nigga
Bend over, let it hang
Go and touch your toes
Show me what you bout
Make that booty wobble
Go ahead and work it out
Arch in your back, make your booty clap
Throw it on a nigga, make a nigga throw it back
Shake it like Beyonce
Shake it like a dog
Do it with no hands from the windows to the wall
Bend over, won't you pop that pussy for me [x4]
Pop that pussy and shake that ass [x4]
