[Pleasure P:]
Lemme see you go round an round [x4]
Staletos, she in the middle of the floor
Need a medal for all the junk up in her trunk
Shawty dance like stripper
She dance like a stripper
She dance like a stripper
When she dips in your patron
Get to the party (party) like she workin on the floor
Shawty got it (got it) when she drop it outta control
Shawty dance like a stripper
She dance like a stripper
She dance like a stripper
When she pop that catalogue

[Lil Jon:]
Shake it off (shake it off)
Shake it down (shake it down)
Don't stop (don't stop)
To the ground (to the ground)
Pick it up (pick it up)
Put it down (put it down)
Lemme see you go round an round
Put it up (put it up)
Push it back (push it back)
Make it jump (make it jump)
Make it cry (make it cry)
Like that (like that)
Like that (like that)
Make a nigga wanna hit it from the back
Yo dick
Yo back
Pop that ass and that cat
Get it girl, that thing ain't to fat
Grind the dick just like that

[Chorus:]
Round an round you go (go) [x4]
Back to Pleasure P instead of got the party
(Party) like she workin on the floor it's:
When her body (body) let's her work it on the pole

[Shawty Putt:]
Heart breaker
Money maker
Booty shaken on the floor
Couple shots and patrons
She start dancin like a HOEEE
Bend it over
Touch them toes
Girl you do that like a pro
You know you bad with all that ass
Show me what it's made for
Shake it to the left
Shake it to the right
Shake it to the front
Now shake it back
Pop that back
Twist the cap
What you do with all that giiiirl
Round an round you go (go) [x4]

[Chorus]

[Pleasure P:]
Ladies on the dancefloor
Ladies by the bar
Ladies in the sound club
Shake it like a star
If it's just on girl
Bring it up to show the world
If it's just on girl
Bring it up to show the world

[Lil Jon:]
How low can you go (go) [x4]
Take it to the floor (floor) [x4]

[Chorus]

Lemme see you go round an round [x8]
