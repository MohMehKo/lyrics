Black day is dawning
All prayers unanswered, laid to rest
If there’s a god he ain’t here now
In daunting darkness we will march
Towards the end with desperate hearts
Too tired to hope, too scared to dream

Let innocence fade, make no sound
Let blood that we’ll shed stain the ground

No turning back now, the orders are clear
It’s time to attack, let the shadows appear
Heeding the call, brave, standing tall
Relentless and ready to die

There’s fear in the wind, there is death in the air
Thousands of souls screaming out in despair
Falling for honor, dying for freedom
Making the last sacrifice

Rising higher flames will burn
A mournful choir of souls that yearn

Red rain is falling
Baptized in blood and sin we see
Everyone was someone’s son
A soldier fighting for someone
Just a man defending what he believes in

If we found out that we were betrayed
Misguided and fallen from grace

No turning back now, the orders are clear
It’s time to attack, let the shadows appear
Heeding the call, brave, standing tall
Relentless and ready to die

Rising higher flames will burn
A mournful choir of souls that yearn

Let innocence fade, make no sound
Let blood that we’ll shed stain the ground

No turning back now, the orders are clear
It’s time to attack, let the shadows appear
Heeding the call, brave, standing tall
Relentless and ready to die

Rising higher flames will burn
A mournful choir of souls that yearn
