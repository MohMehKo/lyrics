The night turns to dawn
The city’s left behind
Those who’ve been blind they will be saved
White stripes on the road they’re guiding my way
Reciting my prayers the road is paved

Through all the years I’ve carried the flame
In the darkest nights as the lightning strikes
I’m bringing hope to those who walk in the shadows

As I drive alone
My mission is unknown
Will it be revealed for me cause

Now I’m calling out for

Power- streaming through me
I will let out the angel or the beast
This power- will make you see
As the lightning strikes your pain will be released

Free me- that’s what I hear you
Screaming- in misery
Free me- from this pain while
Screaming- kneel before mighty
Power- my power
This power- my power

Calling out for

Power- streaming through me
I will let out the angel or the beast
This power- will make you see
As the lightning strikes your pain will be released

Free me- that’s what I hear you
Screaming- in misery
Free me- from this pain while
Screaming- kneel before mighty
Power- my power
This power- my power
