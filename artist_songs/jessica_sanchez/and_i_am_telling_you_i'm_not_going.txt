And I am tellin' you I'm not goin'
You're best man I've ever known
There's no way I can ever go
No, no, there's no way
No, no, no, no, way

I'm not livin' without you
I'm not livin' without you
I don't wanna be free
I'm stayin', I'm stayin'
And you, and you
You're gonna love me

And I am tellin' you, I'm not goin'
Even though the rough times are showin'
There's just no way
There's no way

We're part of the same place
We're part of the same time, yeah
We both share the same blood
We both have the same mind

And time and time
We have so much to share
No, no, no, no, no, no
I'm not wakin' up tomorrow mornin'
And findin' that there's nobody there

Darlin' there's no way
No, no, no, no, way
I'm livin' without you
I'm not livin' without you
You see there's just no way
There's no way

Tear down the mountains
Yell, scream and shout
You can say what you want
I'm not walkin' out'

Stop all the rivers
Push, strike and kill
I'm not gonna leave you
There's no way I will

And I am tellin' you, I'm not goin'
You're the best man I'll ever know
There's no way I can ever, ever go
No, no, no, no, way
No, no, no, no, way

I'm livin' without you
I'm not livin' without you
Not livin' without you
I don't wanna be free
I'm stayin', I'm stayin'
And you, and you, and you
You're gonna love me
You're gonna love me, yes, ah

Ooh, ooh, love me
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh love me
Love me, love me, love me
Love me, you're gonna love me
