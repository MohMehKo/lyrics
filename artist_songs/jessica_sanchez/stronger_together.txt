It's been raining, it's been storming
Pouring on us way too long
And we're at that point of breaking
So we must keep holding on

We gotta be strong for each other
We must be there for each other
We gotta care if we wanna be free
We gotta raise up our voices
Stand up and make the right choices
So we can be what we know we can be

Don't you know that we are stronger together
Stronger, yes we are
We're so much more when we're united together
One mind, one soul, one heart

Come on, yeah
Come on, yeah

We're united in the spirit
There'll be better days to come
If you reach out, you can feel it
Cause it's there for everyone

Don't you know that we are stronger together
Stronger, yes we are
We're so much more when we're united together
One mind, one soul, one heart

Don't you know that we are stronger together
Stronger, yes we are
We're so much more when we're united together
One mind, one soul, one heart

This song is for the doubters and the shouters in the world
We're not buying what you're trying to sell
Love is so much greater than the haters in the world
It's for one, for all, ah, come on

Don't you know that we are stronger together
Stronger, yes we are
We're so much more when we're united together
One mind, one soul, one heart

Don't you know that we are stronger together
Stronger, yes we are
We're so much more when we're united together
One mind, one soul, one heart

Everybody
Everybody

We know we're stronger together
Together, we're stronger together
Stronger together we are
We know we're stronger together
Together, we're stronger together
Stronger together we are

We know we're stronger together
Together, we're stronger together
Stronger together we are
And we get stronger and stronger
And better and better and better
Stronger together by far
