I love ya
Like milk to a baby,
I'm craving you baby can't get enough of... you

And I need ya 
Like a chest needs a heart,
I'm a part of you boy and I know you feel it... too

Boy like MJ glitter and white socks  
We're like Whitney and the bodyguard,
Just like ATMs and credit cards, 
I was made for loving you, boy.

See there's some things that just won't change 
And I'll always love you the same
Money come and go but you complete me
Only you babe 
Believe me, yeah

Like black and white TVs
Or hits from the 80s
Like jump ropes and boomboxes,
This love is classic.

Like old school movies, 
Love letters and prom queens,
Weekend drive ins and chick flicks,
This love is classic

I trust ya
I will give you my heart in a beat and won't even blink,
Cause I know you got me... baby

I can see it,
You and me together forever and ever 
I'll never love another... baby

Boy like MJ glitter and white socks  
We're like Whitney and the bodyguard,

Money come and go but you complete me
Only you babe

Or hits from the 80s
Like jump ropes and boomboxes,
This love is classic.

Like old school movies, 
Love letters and prom queens,
Weekend drive ins and chick flicks,
This love is classic

Ohhh like clouds and rain,
sunshine and rainbows
where you go, I'll follow

Through the darkest nights,
I'll be by your side
Let my love be your light

Like black and white TVs
Or hits from the 80s
Like jump ropes and boomboxes,
This love is classic.

Like old school movies, 
Love letters and prom queens,
Weekend drive ins and chick flicks,
This love is classic

I'll never love, nobody like you
no no no-body like you
(This love is like a classic)

I'll never love, nobody like you
no no no-body like you
