If all the stars fell from the sky
The oceans and rivers went dry
The sun and the moon
Both ran away with the light
I'll fill the holes in your heart
Unbreak the strings on your guitar
Together we'll run
Nothing can tear us apart

I'll be there even in the darkest moments
I'll be there forever

Gonna hold on to you like crazy glue
I'm gonna hold on to you like crazy glue
No matter what I don't ever wanna lose you
If it's the last thing I do
I'll hold on to you like crazy glue

When I'm with you I'm complete
You're like the last puzzle piece
Every day, you always say to me
I'll be there even in the darkest moments
I'll be there forever

Gonna hold on to you like crazy glue
I'm gonna hold on to you like crazy glue
No matter what I don't ever wanna lose you
If it's the last thing I do
I'll hold on to you

I want you to know
I'll never let go
No, never
Some things are meant to stay together

I'm gonna hold on to you like crazy glue
I'm gonna hold on to you like crazy glue
No matter what I don't ever wanna lose you
If it's the last thing I do
I'll hold on to you
I'll hold on to you
Like crazy glue
Like crazy glue
