[Verse 1:]
He's got a way with words
So I got away from him.
He's got ocean blue eyes
And I just realized I can't swim.
He's got a spell he casts
With the way he laughs
Something his smile does
That I'd believe in fact that the world was flat
If he smiled when he said it was

Every lie so pretty
Don't you dare fall for it
That's what I tell myself as I lie here on the floor

[Chorus:]
So here I am, once again
Trying to smell the scent of plastic roses,
Roses

See as good as it feels
I know your love is no more real
Than plastic roses, than the roses
Roses

[Verse 2:]
Ignorance is bliss
But see I know it's a lie
Which in lies a problem with this
Is it wrong to pretend
I don't know that the truth exists
Can I make believe
I'm a fool just long enough
For one last kiss

Every lie so pretty
Don't you dare fall for it
That's what I tell myself as I lie here on the floor

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
Willingly the fool,
'Cause you can only do to me what I let you
Oh, so beautiful, this bouquet of deceits
But to me the roses never smelled so sweet
Smelled so sweet never smelled so sweet
Yeah

[Chorus]
