Ohhh
Ohhhh
Nooo
I ain't usually lost for words
This is gotta be a first
And I'm tryna find the reason why I'm stu-stu-stu-stutterin
Something buddy's happenin
I met a place I've never been
And there's got to be a reason why I'm stu-stu-stu-stutterin
Everytime you look my way
Something in me feels so strange
Need I'm startin to think you are why I'm stu-stu-stutterin
I said hey hey heyy heyyy
And my my my my my my my my my name is jasmine
And it's so frustrating cus I don't wanna let you down
My mind is racing
But it won't come up
Can't believe that I can't talk
But it's not my fault
Cus there's something that you do that's got me stu-stu-stu-stutterin
There's so much that I wanna say
But somethings getting in my way
And I got to figure out
How to stop stu-stu-stuttering
I said hey hey hey heyyy
And my my my my my my my my name is jasmine
And it's so frustrating cus I don't wanna let you down
My mind is racing
But it won't come up
Try to breathe but I'm suffocating
Just be me but it's complicated
I wanna tell you who I am, where I'm from, where I go, when I wanna be loved
I want you to know me better
Once I get my thoughts together
Should be so easy to tell you what I'm feeling
But I can't stop stuttering
Stuttering, stuttering da da, stuttering doo doo doo doo woah stuttering
I ain't usually lost for words
This is got to be a first
And I'm startin to think you are why I'm stu-stu-stu-stuttering
