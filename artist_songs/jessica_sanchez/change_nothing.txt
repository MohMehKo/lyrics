Everyday I'm wakin' up to deja vu
Some ones always telling me not to stick with you
Could it be the nights we spent fixing us
I never thought that we were really that messed up

Should have shut my mouth and kept it all to myself
'Cause now they've got me feeling I should be with somebody else

They say we don't fit together
I could do better
There's always something
They don't know the hell we've been through
'Cause when you hold me like you do
That's when I wanna change nothing

There were times when we would kiss with bitter lips
It don't matter when the good ones taste like this
Maybe we were broken more than once or twice
What we got bad or not I'm not gonna compromise

I should have never let their words 
Get under my skin
Cause all I ever wanted was to 
Find a way through this

They say we don't fit together
I could do better
There's always something
They don't know the hell we've been through
'Cause when you hold me like you do
That's when I wanna change nothing
That's when I wanna change nothing

Should have shut my mouth
And kept it all to myself

No... no...
Oooh... Yeah

They say we don't fit together
I could do better
There's always something
They don't know the hell we've been through
'Cause when you hold me like you do

That's when I wanna change nothing...
That's when I wanna change nothing...
That's when I wanna change nothing...

Oh that's when I wanna change nothing...
