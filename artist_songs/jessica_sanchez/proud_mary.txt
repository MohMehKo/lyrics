I left a good job in the city
Working for the man every night and day
And I never lost one minute of sleeping
Worrying 'bout the way things might have been

Big wheel keep on turning
Proud mary keep on burning
And we're rolling, rolling
Rolling on the river

I left a good job in the city
Working for the man every night and day
And I never lost one minute of sleeping
Worrying 'bout the way things might have been

Big wheel keep on turning
Proud mary keep on burning
And we're rolling, rolling
Rolling on the river
And we're rolling, rolling
Rolling on the river

River to to to to to to...

Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis
Pumped a lot of pane down in New Orleans
But I never saw the good side of the city
Until I hitched a ride in the river boat queen

Big wheel keep on turning
Proud mary keep on burning
And we're rolling, rolling
Rolling on the river
And we're rolling, rolling
Rolling on the river

River to to to to to to...

If you come down to the river
Bet your gonna find some people who live
You don't have to worry, cause you don't have money
People on the river are happy to give

Big wheel keep on turning
Proud mary keep on burning
And we're rolling, rolling
Rolling on the river

River to to to to to to...
