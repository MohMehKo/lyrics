Where have all the good men gone?
The players I'm meetin', they don't turn me on.
[?], yo hun
I get my own while you get some.
Keep me waiting by the phone,
Take me out don't bring me home.
You think this is a date we're on?
Where have all the good men gone?

Hands in the air for the gentlemen left out there
For the gentlemen in here who show the ladies that they care
Hands in the air for the gentlemen left out there
Where the gentlemen at, where the gentlemen at, where?
Come on boy, come on

Show me how you drop it
Put your money, put your money where your mouth is
Lift your hands, don't put your hands in your pocket
You don't gotta wear no suit to show some swaggin'

Hands in the air for the gentlemen left out there
If you're a gentleman then come on over and put it on me

I'm gonna give you a lesson in love
Get your game up, up, up
Open the door when I come
Open your mouth when I run

Where have all the good men gone?
Without a lady, no no, you would've never been born
Boy the [?] is all you've got
While we gotta teach you, wassup up up

Hands in the air for the gentlemen left out there
For the gentlemen in here who show the ladies that they care
Hands in the air for the gentlemen left out there
Where the gentlemen at, where the gentlemen at, where?
Come on boy, come on

Show me how you drop it
Put your money, put your money where your mouth is
Lift your hands, don't put your hands in your pocket
You don't gotta wear no suit to show some swaggin'

Hands in the air for the gentlemen left out there
If you're a gentleman then come on over and put it on me
Come on put it on me

Come now, bring on the chivalry
No less, no less is not enough for me
Come boy, bring on the chivalry
Treat me like a lady

Come now, bring on the chivalry
Turn it up, you will graduate with a degree
Come boy, you gotta bring on the chivalry
Treat me like a lady

Hands in the air for the gentlemen left out there
For the gentlemen in here who show the ladies that they care
Hands in the air for the gentlemen left out there
Where the gentlemen at, where the gentlemen at, where?
Come on boy, come on

Show me how you drop it
Put your money, put your money where your mouth is
Lift your hands, don't put your hands in your pocket
You don't gotta wear no suit to show some swaggin'

Hands in the air for the gentlemen left out there
If you're a gentleman then come on over and put it on me
Come on put it on me

Hands in the air for the gentlemen left out there
Where the gentlemen at, where the gentlemen at, where?
