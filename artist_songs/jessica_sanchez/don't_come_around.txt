Alone now locked up
Out in the cold now

Now you wanna buy me diamonds
And you wanna send me roses
But you know that the roads
With the shops are closed forever

Don't come around here no more
Na aah na ah na
Don't come knocking outside my door
Na aah na ah na

You can find another way to get back in
But you're not gonna break this heart
So no don't come around here no more

Doesn't make you feel like a man
When you're throwin those words to me
You never thought to pick 'em off the ground
And shut off them back in your face

You hate that I never was afraid
Sorry you can't get away
See only little boys like to fool like you
So I took it for you grow up tonight

Now you wanna buy me diamonds
And you wanna send me roses
But you know that the roads
With the shops are closed forever

Don't come around here no more
Na aah na ah na
Don't come knocking outside my door
Na aah na ah na
