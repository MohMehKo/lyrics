[Ne-Yo:]
You seem like every day is something else
Another reason to be stressing
[Jessica:]
And you just wanna run away
Said you just wanna run away
[Ne-Yo:]
You try to get out and enjoy yourself
But everybody’s acting so depressing
[Jessica:]
And you just wanna run away
Said you just wanna run away

So we about to hop up on this rocket
Get up outta here
Go somewhere where nothing ever goes wrong
'Bout to hop up on this rocket
Take to the sky
Everything is fly

Cause we ain’t even on earth tonight
We on a planet where the dudes got money and they're not afraid to spend it
(Ayo, ayo)
And everything is alright
(Ayo, ayo)
Cause we ain’t even on earth tonight
We on a planet where there ain’t no drama and the party’s never ending
(Ayo, ayo)
And everything is alright
(Ayo, ayo)

Cause we ain’t even on earth tonight
Pretty baby, no.
Cause we ain’t even on earth tonight
Oh.

And you’ll be dancing through the moments
Got my girls from Venus, grab your boys from Mars
And we’ll get away
Go somewhere and just get right

Cause we ain’t even on earth tonight
We on a planet where the dudes got money and they're not afraid to spend it
