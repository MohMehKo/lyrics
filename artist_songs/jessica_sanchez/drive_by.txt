I'll be honest, I get lonely sometimes
Just so I can hear your voice, I call your phone
And I'd be lying, if I said I didn't go too far,
Some nights I'm waiting in my car by your home

Oh oh, I couldn't forget you if I wanted to,
And I know it's crazy, but baby you're always on my mind
So I drive by, I drive by, (baby) I drive by,
It's crazy baby, you're always on my mind

I'll be honest, really miss you sometimes,
And I think of you every night, I can't sleep
And I'd be lying if I said I wasn't out of hand but,
If only you could understand what you do to me

Oh oh, I couldn't forget you if I wanted to,
And I know it's crazy, but baby you're always on my mind
So I drive by, I drive by, (oh) I drive by,
It's crazy baby, you're always on my mind

Hey, I can't keep it up, I don't know how to stop,
I can't control my love, so I drive by, drive by, drive by
I can't let go of you, and baby I'm so confused,
See what you make me do, I drive by, drive by, drive by

(I drive by, I drive by, I drive by...)

Crazy baby
I'm going crazy baby
It's crazy, baby you're always on my mind
Couldn't forget you if I wanted to
And I know it's crazy, but baby you're always on my mind
So I drive by, (crazy baby) I drive by, I drive by
It's crazy, baby you're always on my mind
So I drive by, so I drive by, so I drive by
