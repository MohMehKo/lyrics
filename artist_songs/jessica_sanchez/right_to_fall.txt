Your love belongs to me,
Don't you run, don't you hide.
Your love does something to me
Deep inside, I come alive.

'Cause you and I belong together
We've been hiding long enough
We can't care what they approve of
Can't let them tell us who to love

So let's fight for the right to live
Fight for the right to give all
Fight for the right to fall
Fall, fall in love

We're gonna love, off we
We're gonna love, off we
We're gonna love, off we gone
We're gonna love, off we
We're gonna love, off we
We're gonna love, off we gone

I've got the right to fall

If loving you was wrong,
I don't wanna be right
And I won't be surprised,
If I love you for the rest of my life

'Cause you and I belong together
We've been hiding long enough
We can't care what they approve of
Can't let them tell us who to love

So let's fight for the right to live
Fight for the right to give all
Fight for the right to fall
Fall, fall in love

We're gonna love, off we
We're gonna love, off we
We're gonna love, off we gone
We're gonna love, off we
We're gonna love, off we
We're gonna love, off we gone

I've got the right to fall
I've got the right to fall

So let's fight for the right to live
Fight for the right to give all
Fight for the right to fall
Fall, fall in love

I've got the right to fall
Yeah yeah yeah
Woah woah woah
I've got the right to fall, yeah
The right to fall
The right to fall
I've got the right to fall
