From the mouths of babes to the power of men
I make it all new again
Hold my hand, hold my hand 'cause I can't touch the ground
The carousel goes around, round and round
The addiction, the friction, it burns you alive
So illegal, no evil is seen with these eyes
I won't tell if you won’t and I will if you want
Nothing is sacred, don't care if it's wrong

I'm your Lolita, La Femme Nikita
When we're together, you'll love me forever
You're my possession, I'm your obsession
Don't tell me never, you'll love me forever

Doomed from the start, we can't stay apart
Everywhere I turn I'm trapped in your heart
There's no escape, secrets keep you awake
No running away, no saving the day
Wild and exciting I'm breaking you down
You're making a comeback, I'm taking your crown
Nursery rhymes I’m singing my dreams
I'm lost in the woods and you're baring your teeth

I'm your Lolita, La Femme Nikita
When we're together, you'll love me forever
You're my possession, I'm your obsession
Don't tell me never, you'll love me forever

Always stay close to me, don't think of leaving
Don't promise, I will keep our secret (secret, secret)

I'm your Lolita, La Femme Nikita
When we're together, you'll love me forever
You're my possession, I'm your obsession
Don't tell me never, you'll love me forever

Always stay close to me, don't think of leaving
And don't promise, I will keep our secret (secret, secret)
