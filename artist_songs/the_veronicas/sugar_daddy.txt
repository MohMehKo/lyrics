Watch me like a movie
Pin me on your screen
Meet me in the alley
With a diamond ring

Take me to an island
Sail me through the seas
Buy me a big garden
Pretty as can be

A little charm
You can flaunt me
As your own
I don't need much
Just your touch
Now take me home

Be my sugar daddy
Gimme something sweet 'cause I don't wanna be bad
Be my sugar daddy
Make me the star in every dream you have

Don't you wanna be
Don't you wanna be in love
Don't you wanna be
Don't you wanna be in love

We could watch some TV
Make love after we fight
I know it's hard to tame me, but
I want you to try

Not a little girl
You can flaunt me
As your own
I don't need much
Just your touch
Now take me home

Be my sugar daddy
Gimme something sweet 'cause I don't wanna be bad
Be my sugar daddy
Make me the star in every dream you have

Don't you wanna be
Don't you wanna be in love
Don't you wanna be
Don't you wanna be in love

Be my sugar daddy
Gimme something sweet 'cause I don't wanna be bad
Be my sugar daddy
Make me the star in every dream you have

Don't you wanna be
Don't you wanna be in love
Don't you wanna be
Don't you wanna be in love
