Ohh
Oh yea

Watch you walk away
I didn't say the words I wanted to say
Now I'm sitting all alone
thinkin' bout the times I had you here to hold

Giving you my reasons why
I feel this when we say goodbye

But I won't run around after you
And you know what you've found
And you know I'm in love with you
Everything changes when I see your smile
So stay a little while.

I miss you even more today
knowing that you're so far away
You tell me that you'll see me soon
But tell me just how long I have to wait for you

Giving you my reasons why
For asking you to stay tonight

But I won't run around after you
And you know what you've found
And you know I'm in love with you
Everything changes when I see your smile
So stay a little while.

And I won't run around after you
And you know what you've found
And you know I'm in love with you
Everything changes when I see your smile
So stay a little while.
Stay a little while.
