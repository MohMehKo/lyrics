Here we are, baby can't you see?
I would write you a symphony
About a heart too tough to break
About a love you can't replay

And If I had to,
I would give up the stars, the moon, everything
For you, you and me, me, to make it through
They say we'll never last

Baby the world is ours
Nothing can stop us now
They're not gonna bring us down
We'll never give in
It ain't over 'til...

Baby, the world is ours
No one will knock us down
Not gonna run us out
No matter what
It ain't over 'til I say it's over

No no no no
No no no no
No no no no

And so we'll rise above
The fit won't last, just don't care
Take away our love
They'll never understand this love

'Cause I know in the end
We are the ones that are free
We fight the fight for all the things we know we can be
They say we'll never last

Baby the world is ours
Nothing can stop us now
They're not gonna bring us down
We'll never give in
It ain't over 'til...

Baby, the world is ours
No one will knock us down
Not gonna run us out
No matter what
It ain't over 'til I say it's over

No no no no
No no no no
No no no no

Baby the world is ours
Nothing can stop us now
They're not gonna bring us down
We'll never give in
It ain't over 'til...

Baby, the world is ours
No one will knock us down
Not gonna run us out
No matter what
It ain't over 'til I say it's over
