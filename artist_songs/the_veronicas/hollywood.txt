Things are so different here
All truths, seem to disappear
And who you were it doesn't matter
My point is better view, make me look beautiful
And every face same old story

In Hollywood, Hollywood
Every sunrise ya get so close
Every sunset an overdose
No one cares but everybody knows oh, ohs

Bask in someone else's fame 
Live off, off the family
And who you are is all that matters
It's so hard, being young today
To your adds and pink cocaine 
And you'll go far for doing nothing

In Hollywood, Hollywood 
Every sunrise ya get so close
Every sunset an overdose 
No one cares but everybody knows oh, ohs

Every body wants to be someone
And everybody wants to be someone else
And when ya down they'll hand you a shotgun
just get me out, get me out of
Hollywood, Hollywood every sunrise ya get so close
Every sunset an overdose 
No one cares but everybody know
Get me out, get me out, get me out, get me out, get me out, get me out
