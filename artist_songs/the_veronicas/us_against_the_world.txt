Sometimes you feel like you just wanna die inside
They're kicking dirt in your face, making you wanna cry
Shake it off, shake it off, get yourself out of bed
When you feel like it's all coming crashing down
Here comes the rain and you think that you're starting to drown
Play it off, play it off, get it out of your head

'Cause it won't really matter
The bad's just gonna get better
And I won't let it bring you down

It's us against the world
Nothing's gonna stop us
We'll always have each other
You'll never be alone

It's us against the world
Nothing's gonna break us
No, we won't let it shake us
I want you to know
It's us against the world

When you feel like it's all coming crashing down
Here comes the rain and you think you're starting to drown
Let it go, let it go, it'll be alright

'Cause it won't really matter
The bad's just gonna get better
And I won't let it bring you down

It's us against the world
Nothing's gonna stop us
We'll always have each other
You'll never be alone

It's us against the world
Nothing's gonna break us
No, we won't let it shake us
I want you to know
It's us against the world

It's us against the world, oh

'Cause it won't really matter
The bad's just gonna get better
And I won't let it bring you down

It's us against the world
Nothing's gonna stop us
We'll always have each other
You'll never be alone

It's us against the world
Nothing's gonna break us
No, we won't let it shake us
I want you to know
It's us against the world
