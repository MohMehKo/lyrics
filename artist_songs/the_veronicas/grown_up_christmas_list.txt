Do you remember me?
I sat upon your knee
I wrote to you with childhood fantasies
Well, I'm all grown up now
Can you still help somehow?
I'm not a child, but my heart still can dream

No more lives torn apart
The wars would never start
That time would heal our hearts
Everyone would have a friend
The right would always win
That love would never end
This is our grown up Christmas list

As children, we believed
The greatest sight to see
Is something lovely wrapped beneath the tree
Well, Heaven surely knows
The packages and bows
Can never heal a hurting human soul

No more lives torn apart
The wars would never start
And time would heal our hearts
Everyone would have a friend
The right would always win
That love would never end
This is our grown up Christmas list
