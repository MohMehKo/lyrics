Did I say something wrong?
Why are you mad at me?
Is there something you don't like about me? 
Maybe it's the way I think

You go behind my back, 
Tellin all my friends that you hate the way I look,
You really can't stand me, 
you try to bring me down when I'm reachin out my hand,
Do you really think that it's worth it in the end?

Without love, without love,
Without love, without love,
we're never gonna make it,
No, we're never gonna make it,
no, no

If I met you face to face, 
Then maybe we can talk it out,
If you put yourself in my place,
would you like it if I put you down?

Show me who you are, 
You don't even know me,
When I turn my back, you always talk about me,
Pretending you don't hear me when I set it straight,
You make it more than clear, I'm the one you love to hate,

But without love, without love,
Without love, without love,
we're never gonna make it,
No, we're never gonna make it,
no, no

How do you sleep at night,
When you know it isn't right?
Be careful what you say,
Better think before it's to late,

Without love, without love,
Without love, without love,
we're never gonna make it,
No, we're never gonna make it,
no, no
