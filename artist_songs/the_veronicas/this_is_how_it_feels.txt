You keep calling my phone non-stop
Don't you know I won't pick it up?
You never leave a message
Look how you've changed

You got nothing to say, gettin' in the way
Show up at my house
You're gettin' so obsessive
Like I have time for you

Wasn't it me you didn't want?
Wasn't it me who was hanging on?
Now I'm done but before I go I want you to know ...

This is how it feels
When you wait for a call that never comes
Are you awake at night 'cause you miss someone?
This is how it feels
When the trust you had is broken,
And you're left to burn with your heart wide open

Oh Oh

You wanted me, not to tell me why
Why and how you had the heart to fuck up my whole life
That's just so you

And now I've moved on by myself
And maybe I won't forgive
I'll just forget you lived
And I hope it hurts

Wasn't it me you tried to blame?
Wasn't it me you threw away?
But before you go there's something you should know ...

This is how it feels
When you wait for a call that never comes
Are you awake at night 'cause you miss someone?
This is how it feels (oh oh)
When the trust you had is broken,
And you're left to burn with your heart wide open

You taught me how to hate you
When I was so in love
When I tried to save us it was not enough
So what the hell is different
'cause now that I am gone
You're crawling back to tell me
I'm the one

Oh Oh
This is how it feels
Oh Oh
This is how it feels

When you wait for a call that never comes
Are you awake at night 'cause you miss someone?
This is how it feels (oh oh oh, oh oh oh)
When the trust you had is broken,
And you're left to burn with your heart wide open

Do you only want me
'cause you can't have me?
Do you only want me
'cause I'm gone?
Do you only want me
'cause you can't have me?
Do you only want me
'cause I'm gone?
Do you only want me
'cause you can't have me?
Do you only want me
'cause I'm gone?
Do you only want me
'cause you can't have me?
Do you only want me
'cause I'm gone?

Oh Oh
