Hiding out in our secret place
In the cupboard where our mum wouldn't find us
Making up stupid words all day
Our own escape
Same face with a different name
Wishing that UFOs would come and find us
Pointing out every small mistake through each heartbreak

Where did those days go?
We're all growing up so fast
Wish that we could live forever
Through all the changes there is one thing that will last
It will always be you and me
Side by side on a motel floor
Waiting up for our daddy to call us
Doesn't matter where we are
Home's the two of us

Where did those days go?
We're all growing up so fast
Wish that we could live forever
Through all the changes there
Is one thing that will last
It will always be you and me
What would I do without you?
It's plain to see
We're incomplete without you and me

Where did those days go?
We're all growing up so fast
Wish that we could live forever
Through all the changes there
Is one thing that will last
It will always be you and me
It will always be you and me
