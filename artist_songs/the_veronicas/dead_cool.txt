I’m gonna tell you a story about a time
He came along and he stole me
I drove you crazy
You drove me right up the wall
You took me higher than holy

You’re in and you’re in and you’re in and out
You smoke me out like I’m a son of a gun
You use me up just for fun ‘cause you’re dead cool
You shoot your mouth off and you turn me on
Beat the devil and rock ‘cause you’re dead cool

Under the spell of a gypsy
A wanted man who likes to love me and leave me
He calls me up just to bail him out 
But then he’ll turn around and deceive me

You’re in and you’re in and you’re in and out
You smoke me out like I’m a son of a gun
You use me up just for fun ‘cause you’re dead cool
You shoot your mouth off and you turn me on
Beat the devil and rock ‘cause you’re dead cool

You smoke me out like I’m a son of a gun
You use me up just for fun ‘cause you’re dead cool
You shoot your mouth off and you turn me on
Beat the devil and rock ‘cause you’re dead cool

You never stay in one place for too long 
You say baby I got it wrong ‘cause you’re dead cool
I’ll show you things I know have never been done
But I don’t have time to come ‘cause I’m dead cool

You smoke me out like I’m a son of a gun
You use me up just for fun ‘cause you’re dead cool
You shoot your mouth off and you turn me on
Beat the devil and rock ‘cause you’re dead cool

You smoke me out like I’m a son of a gun
You use me up just for fun ‘cause you’re dead cool
You shoot your mouth off and you turn me on
Beat the devil and rock ‘cause you’re dead cool
