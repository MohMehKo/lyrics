She asked if you could stay
did ya think about me when
you almost turned away
did you think about me when
you picked up the phone
should have let it just ringing
And made it seem like everything
was the same as it had always been

Did ya think about me being half awake and crying,
Lying on the floor and waiting for the break of day
Didn't think about tearing me apart,
At any moment in the night you could have tried to make it right.
why, why, why?

Now in an after thought
were you thinking about me
Don't know what you did it for
Cause you were thinking about you, so
you want me to believe
you were thinking about me
It isn't hard for me to see you didn't stop for anything

How bout me being half awake and crying
Lying on the floor and waiting for the break of day
Didn't think about tearing me apart,
At any moment in the night you could have tried to make it right.

Give me one good reason why in time i should believe in you
you had me, you had it, everything
So close your eyes and remember all those lies
that you never say when you pretend that you
will be with me again

Did ya think about me being half awake and crying,
Lying on the floor and waiting for the break of day
Didn't think about tearing me apart,
At any moment in the night you could have tried to make it right.
why, why, why?

Did ya think about me being half awake and crying,
Lying on the floor and waiting for the break of day
Didn't think about tearing me apart,
At any moment in the night you could have tried to make it right.
why, why, why?
