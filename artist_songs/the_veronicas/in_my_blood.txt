When I look into your eyes
I wanna breathe you in to get me high
Crawl into this space inside your mind
Just leave me there, leave me there
Now you got me wanting more
I felt religion with you on the floor
The holy word that I've been waiting for
Baby stay with me, stay with me

We don't have to wait all night
To know if this is really love
We don't have to wait all night
Cause I can feel you in my blood

In my blood
In my blood

I just want us to unite
Feel the needle on my fourty-five
Live like we are running out of time
Just take me there, take me there
Grind you down into my bones
You're the magic dust that gets me stoned
You're the hallelujah on my throne
Baby stay with me, stay with me

We don't have to wait all night
To know if this is really love
We don't have to wait all night
Cause I can feel you in my blood

In my blood
In my blood

I don't wanna come down (I don't wanna come down)
I don't wanna come down (I don't wanna come down)

We don't have to wait all night
To know if this is really love
We don't have to wait all night
Cause I can feel you in my blood

In my blood
In my blood
In my blood
In my blood
