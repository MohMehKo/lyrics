It's three AM,
I start to cry.
I'm alone again.

I try so hard not to fall in love
but here I am.

And you couldn't even pretend
that you care if this was the end.

All the things you said to me won't even matter
Do what you want 
'Cause I'm not gonna save you baby. 
What's goin' on?
We don't care, We don't fight, 
We don't even know what's wrong or right now baby
What's goin' on?
What's goin' on?

There's nothing else I can say.
What can I do?
We might have worked out someday,
But it takes two.

And you couldn't even pretend
that you care if this was the end.

All the things you said to me
won't even matter
Do what you want
'Cause I'm not gonna save you baby
What's goin' on?
We don't care
We don't fight
We don't even know what's wrong or right
now baby
What's goin' on?
What's goin' on?
What's goin' on?
(All the things you said to me won't even matter)

And I couldn't even pretend
that I care if this is the end

(I'm not gonna save you baby)
All the things you said to me
won't even matter
Do what you want
'Cause I'm not gonna save you baby
What's goin' on?
We don't care
We don't fight
We don't even know what's wrong or right
now baby
What's goin' on?

All the things you said to me
won't even matter
Do what you want
'Cause I'm not gonna save you baby
What's goin' on?
We don't care
We don't fight
We don't even know
what's wrong or right now baby
What's goin' on?
What's goin' on?

But here I am...
