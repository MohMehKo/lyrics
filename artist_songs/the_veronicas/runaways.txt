Fooled you once
Fooled you twice, the shame is on you
Blame me now
I can't help the things that I do

I get too close
So close to love, that it disappears
My love can hurt
Hurt like a bitch, I'll admit it right here

I'm just a runaway, runaway heartache
I'm just a runaway, runaway

Breaking hearts ain't always easy
You better run from the devil in me
I'll be gone before you leave me
Baby, I was born to be free

I'm a runaway
You wanna stay but I only pass through
Don't burn yourself
You get too hot, I'll be playing you cool

I'm just a runaway, runaway heartache
I'm just a runaway, runaway

Breaking hearts ain't always easy
You better run from the devil in me
I'll be gone before you leave me
Baby, I was born to be free

Breaking hearts ain't always easy
You better run from the devil in me
I'll be gone before you leave me
Baby, I was born to be free

I'm just a runaway, runaway heartache
I'm just a runaway, runaway heartache

Please don't take it personal
Something that I can't control
One by one I watch 'em fall, all fall down
Told you I'm a runaway
Can't keep me inside a cage
Baby, I'll be gone before you know

Breaking hearts ain't always easy
You better run from the devil in me
I'll be gone before you leave me
Baby, I was born to be free

Breaking hearts ain't always easy
You better run from the devil in me (Devil in me)
I'll be gone before you leave me
Baby, I was born to be free (Born to be free)

Breaking hearts ain't always easy
You better run from the devil in me (From the devil in me)
I'll be gone before you leave me
Baby, I was born to be free
