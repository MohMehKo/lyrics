Don't know, what we're fighting for.
Who'd have known we'd fall, a second too late?
Crash down, one foot below the ground.
Did you hear the sound?
Of a smile that is fading.

When will it go?
When will it stop?
Is whirling in my head.
A part of me, still lives for you.
So don't ever forget..

Coz I belong, I believe.
We are one, you and me.
But we keep on falling into silence.
Out of luck, out of time.
What will it take? Do you realise?
Coz you know it's killing me,
To be left unseen.

Hey you, what's running through your head?
Is cupid lying dead?
While I'm sitting here waiting.
All the stupid little things,
That belong to you and me.
Will you really throw them all away?

Coz I belong, I believe.
We are one, you and me.
But we keep on falling into silence.
Out of luck, out of time.
What will it take? Do you realise?
Coz you know it's killing me,
To be left unseen.

I'm the one that's been trying.
Left it all up to me,
And I won't waste another day til you believe.
Baby I've been mistaken.
Didn't you ever mean?
Is there truth behind the words you said to me?

But we keep on falling into silence.
Out of luck, out of time.
What will it take? Do you realise?
Coz you know it's killing me,
To be left unseen.

Coz I belong, I believe.
We are one, you and me.
Coz you know it's killing me,
To be left unseen.
