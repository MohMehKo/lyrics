Saturdays, will never be, the same 
Its even hard mentioning your name 
Lookin back I don't know what went wrong 
But suddenly it's like I dont belong 

[CHORUS:]
So how long must I wait? 
And how long must I stay? 
Please let me know how to live. 
Cuz i dont ever wanna feel this way 
Again. 

Nuthin seems to matter anymore 
Why cant it be just like it was before? 
I hate you for the person i've become 
Take me back to where it all begun 

[CHORUS:]
So how long must I wait? 
And how long must I stay? 
Please let me know how to live. 
Cuz i dont ever wanna feel this way 
Again. 

Let me know, how to live 
Let me know 

[CHORUS:]
So how long must I wait? 
And how long must I stay? 
Please let me know how to live. 
Cuz i dont ever wanna feel this way 
Again.
