Another lonely night without him by my side
Trying to stop myself from getting close to him
You're in my head again but we should just be friends
But I know I'll change my mind again, 
I'll never see you differently 'cause

It's happening again
I think of what you said to me
Now I can't go back to how it used to be
I tried to run and hide
Push my emotions aside
'Cause I can't face the fact
The one good thing I found, I can't have

You say that we're not right and I don't wanna fight
But they can't see the way he makes me feel
The way he touched my face, I want him every day
I wish there was a way to make you see
Can't you tell it's killing me 'cause

It's happening again
I think of what you said to me
Now I can't go back to how it used to be
I tried to run and hide
Push my emotions aside
'Cause I can't face the fact
The one good thing I found, I can't have

I hate waking up each night
And knowing you're not there
Without you, nothing's right
Baby I just need you here, oh yeah

Another lonely night
I don't have you here by my side
I had to let you slip away
I gotta get you off my mind

It's happening again
I think of what you said to me
Now I can't go back to how it used to be
I tried to run and hide
Push my emotions aside
'Cause I can't face the fact
The one good thing I found, I can't have

It's happening again
I think of what you said to me
Now I can't go back to how it used to be
I tried to run and hide
Push my emotions aside
'Cause I can't face the fact
The one good thing I found, I can't have
