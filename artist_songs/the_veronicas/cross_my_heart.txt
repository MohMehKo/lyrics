It's hard to look away from the fire in your eyes
Don't wanna hear that we are out of time
Stay here next to me
I was hurt you brought me back to life

No I don't wanna make it stop,
No I don't wanna give you up

Cross my heart
Hope to die
Swear I'll never tell you a lie
Trust my words, hear my vow
Swear I'm never gonna let you down

We got a love that last forever
We got a love that last forever

Don't wanna hear it when they say we're too young
or what I need
Like a secret lock to wait too long
You have set me free
I was broken didn't wanna fall in love

No I don't wanna make it stop
No I don't wanna give you up

Cross my heart
Hope to die
Swear I'll never tell you a lie
Trust my words, hear my vow
Swear I'm never gonna let you down

We got a love that last forever
We got a love that last forever

I couldn't stand to see another hand upon you
Let me hold you for life
I will always be by your side

Cross my heart
Hope to die
Swear I'll never tell you a lie
Trust my words, hear my vow
Swear I'm never gonna let you down

We got a love that last forever
We got a love that last forever
