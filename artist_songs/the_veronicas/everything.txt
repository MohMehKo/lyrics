I want you mine 
Coz when I see your eyes
I'm wanting you to stay 
Why am I running away?
Coz when you hold my hand 
I try to pretend
I'm not feeling like I do
Do you feel it too? (Do you feel it too?)

When I close my eyes I see you (ooh ooh ooh)
Don't tell me this is wrong

Coz everything everything makes me think of you
And everything everything that I wanna do
I know you can see now when you look at me
I want you, so tell me now
Do you? Do you? Want me too?

When I see you out
I lie to myself
I hang on what she says
It's prefect in my head
Wanna go too far
Find out who you are
I'm too close to turn around
I think I fighured you out

And I want so bad to kiss you
Don't tell me that I'm wrong

Coz everything everything makes me think of you
And everything everything that I wanna do
I know you can see now when you look at me
I want you, so tell me now
Do you? Do you? Want me too?
Think of you
And everything everything that I wanna do
I know you can see now when you look at me
I want you, so tell me now
Do you? Do you? Want me too?

Am I crazy? I feel lost in time
You confuse me, have I lost my mind?

Coz everything everything makes me think of you
And everything everything that I wanna do
I know you can see now when you look at me
I want you, so tell me now
Do you? Do you? Want me too?
Think of you
And everything everything that I wanna do
I know you can see now when you look at me 
I want you, so tell me now
Do you? Do you? Want me too?

Do you? Do you? Want me too?
