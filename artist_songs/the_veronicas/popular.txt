Pop, pop! Pop, pop!

I hate to say it but they play this damn song in every club
But it's me so I'll show love
But it's me so show me love

When I walk into the room people stop and stare
It's like nobody else is there
You know it's me not you
Who said anything about you

Boys and girls pretend to know me, they try so hard
And I get what I want, my name is my credit card
Don't try to hate me because I am so popular..

Pop, pop, popular! Pop, pop, popular!

Most guys I dated got intimidated
So now I date up
If you know what it means so they shut up
If you know what it means so just shut up

'Cause I don't wanna give half away
On the date we don't make up
If you know what I mean when we wake up
If you know what I mean when we break up

Boys and girls pretend to know me, they try so hard
And I get what I want, my name is my credit card
Don't try to hate me because I am so popular..

Pop, pop, popular!

You always wanna be around me
So you know what it's like
When the world is at your feet
And you're VIP tonight
You've either you got it or you don't
And I'm sorry you won't
Get there by using me
Just go & do your own thing

Boys and girls pretend to know me, they try so hard
And I get what I want, my name is my credit card
Don't try to hate me because I am so popular

Pop, pop, popular!

Boys and girls pretend to know me, they try so hard

Pop, pop, popular! Pop, pop, popular!
