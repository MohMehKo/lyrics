Those times I waited for you seem so long ago
I wanted you far too much to ever let you go
You know I never could buy “I feel it too”
And I guess I never could stand to lose

It’s just a pity to say goodbye to you
Goodbye to you
Goodbye to you
Goodbye to you

How could I have loved someone like the one I see in you?
I remember the good times baby, now, and the bad times too
These last few weeks of holding on
The days are dull, and the nights are long

Guess it’s better to say goodbye to you
Goodbye to you
Goodbye to you
Goodbye to you

Cause baby it’s over now, no need talk about it
It’s not the same, my love for you’s just not the same
And my heart, and my heart, and my heart can’t stand the strain
And love, and my love, and my love (my love)

Goodbye to you (goodbye)
Goodbye to you
 Goodbye to you (goodbye)
Goodbye to you

How could I have loved someone like the one I see in you?
I remember the good times baby, now, and the bad times too
These last few weeks of holding on
The days are dull, and the nights are long

Guess it’s better to say goodbye to you (goodbye)
Goodbye to you (goodbye)
Goodbye to you (goodbye)
Goodbye to you (goodbye) 
Goodbye to you
