Say oh oh oh
Say oh oh oh

I'll tell you about a story that you wanna hear
We're bouncing off the walls but we don't care
Forget about the rules, we'll just let them slide
We're calling all the girls with the wild side

Well I don't want to compromise
No, I won't this time

I know things don't always work out like we planned
Say oh oh oh
Say oh oh oh
Somehow things are gonna play out in the end
Say oh oh oh
Say oh oh oh

(Say oh oh oh)

Welcome to the city where the fun won't stop
It's time to shake the world with the sound of rock
Forget about the cost, step up, don't be shy
'Cause this one's for the girls with the wild side

You won't have to compromise
No, you won't this time

I know things don't always work out like we planned
Say oh oh oh
Say oh oh oh
Somehow things are gonna play out in the end
Say oh oh oh
Say oh oh oh

Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh

I know things don't always work out like we planned
Say oh oh oh
Say oh oh oh
Somehow things are gonna play out in the end
Say oh oh oh
Say oh oh oh

This is for the girls with the wild side
