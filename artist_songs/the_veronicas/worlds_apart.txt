I'm gonna hold you for the last time.
I'm gonna cry but afraid not to let it show.
This is the hardest way to say goodbye,
Coz as you walk away I'm feeling so alone.

I don't understand,
You had to leave and I'm not part of your plan.
We both agreed but now I regret.
There are so many things I should have said...

But now, I've let you go,
I'm holding back the tears, I'm here, alone.
Forgetting all the years.
And now there's nothing I can do 
To bring you back to me, Ooh.
So we live our different lives, it's so hard
And there's no more you and I.
But we're worlds apart.

Sometimes it's hard to get to sleep at night.
Sometimes I think about the way it could've been.
I see you everytime I close my eyes,
I try to shut you out, instead I let you in.
I can't pretend,
I wanted it to end for you and me..

But now, I've let you go,
I'm holding back the tears, I'm here, alone.
Forgetting all the years.
And now there's nothing I can do 
To bring you back to me, Ooh.
So we live our different lives, it's so hard
And there's no more you and I.
And I'm missing you tonight,
But we're worlds apart.

What I'd give for one more day,
Just to say the things I need to say.
If only, time was not erased.

As you walked away I knew,
I couldn't explain to you.
And I can't pretend, 
I wanted this to end, for you and me...

But now, I've let you go,
I'm holding back the tears, I'm here, alone.
Forgetting all the years.
And now there's nothing I can do 
To bring you back to me, Ooh.
So we live our different lives, it's so hard
And there's no more you and I.
And I'm missing you tonight,
But we're worlds apart.

We are worlds apart.
