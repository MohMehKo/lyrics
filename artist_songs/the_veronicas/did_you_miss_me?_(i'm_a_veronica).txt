I'm a Veronica

Back with a vengeance, back with a song
All you motherfuckers got it wrong
I'm the villain, I'm the one
Yeah I was born just to take you on

Open your eyes up, step in the ring
Float like a butterfly, bee I sting
I'm like Snow White with a gun
shoot you down, bang bang
You're done

Did you miss me?
Did you really think that I was gone?
So baby tell me, did you miss me?
Did you really think that I was done?
I'm a Veronica

'Cause down under we don't take no prisoners
We don't take no prisoners

'Cause down under we don't take no prisoners
We don't take no prisoners

From my homeland to Hong Kong
By the time you find me I'll be gone
But you never thought I'd hit like that
Looks like hell? just got back

My best friends, my enemy
Oh who is me, I'll take 'em one by one
And if you get in my face then you'll get a taste
Even God would run son

Did you miss me?
Did you really think that I was gone?

'Cause down under we don't take no prisoners
We don't take no prisoners
'Cause down under we don't take no prisoners
We don't take no prisoners

I'm a Veronica

I'm on mission to the stars
I'm the love child living life on Mars
I'm the next king in line for the throne
Ascendancy let it be know
I won't stop, gonna run this town gonna sip
sip down
Gonna bring you out
'Cause if I'm not where you wanna be, then boy
step back up all of me
'Cause I don't need to follow you down

Cause i am so demand, don't know if i'm
coming or going
Yeah there's a glitch in your bitch, bitch, white
my empire keeps growing
Cause i am so demand, don't know if i'm
coming or going
Yeah there's a glitch in your bitch, bitch, white
my empire keeps growing

Did you miss me?
Did you really think that I was gone?
So baby tell me, did you miss me?
Did you really think that I was done?

'Cause down under we don't take no prisoners
We don't take no prisoners

'Cause down under we don't take no prisoners
We don't take no prisoners

'Cause down under we don't take no prisoners
We don't take no prisoners

'Cause down under we don't take no prisoners
We don't take no prisoners

I'm a Veronica.
