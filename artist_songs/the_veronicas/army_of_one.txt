It's unspoken
My heart is broken
Calling for freedom
Where are we going?
Open the same door
We always want more
Everyone's searching
Need something to die for

In the end, love won't stop
As long as we're here
Nothing is lost
Make up your mind
The time has come
So why does it feel
Like an army of one?
An army of one
An army of one

Have we forgotten?
Too busy running
All of a sudden
We're left falling
This is a moment
The river's an ocean
We try to cross, but
We drown in emotion

In the end, love won't stop
As long as we're here
Nothing is lost
Make up your mind
The time has come
So why does it feel
Like an army of one?
An army of one

Help, how do we win,
When we are so, so far gone?
When we know where we've been
Can we ever make it back to the start?

In the end, love won't stop
As long as we're here
Nothing is lost
Make up your mind
The time has come
So why does it feel
Like an army of one?

In the end, love won't stop
As long as we're here
Nothing is lost
Make up your mind
The time has come
So why does it feel
Like an army of one?
An army of one
