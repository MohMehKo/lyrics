All my life you've had an opinion
Doing things for the wrong reasons
Well not today

Don't you know I think for myself
I get on fine without anybody's help
Don't care what you say

I'm breaking your heart (but I'm breaking apart)
All you do is hold me down (hold me down)
Try to make me someone I don't know
I'm not the girl you'd thought you found

What would you do if I told you
You can't control my life
What would you say
If I left today with no regrets and no goodbye
What would you do if I told you
There is no more you and I
What would you say if I walked away and left you there to cry

I don't know what's coming over you
Or how we fell apart
I tried so hard but I don't believe in you
You're not the guy I thought I knew

What would you do if I told you
You can't control my life
And what would you say
If I left today with no regrets and no goodbye
What would you do if I told you
There is no more you and I
What would you say if I walked away and left you there to cry

What would you say if I said to you just go ahead and cry
