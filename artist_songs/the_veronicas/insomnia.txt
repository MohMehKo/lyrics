[Whispers] Sleep Sleep Sleep

I can't sleep most of the time
Try to cancel you from my mind
Never liked you that much anyway
Got to try sleep through to Saturday

Can't seem to keep my eyes shut
Can't stop to think about what what what
You said, you said to me when
I lost, I lost you again

Can't make the beat go away
Gotta get me outta this state
I gotta feel the rush on my face

I'm lonely, gotta look for a party
and dance with somebody tonight
Cause I'm lonely, feeling empty inside
Can't you make me feel alive

I-N-S-O-M-N-I-A Can't sleep
I-N-S-O-M-N-I-A Can't sleep

Don't look at me like that
What? You think I'm some kinda maniac
Who was asking for your opinion anyway
It's my life and you don't have a say

Gotta get, get outta this place
Can't stand to look at your face
I'm gonna get lost in the underground
I'll kill you if you follow me around

Can't make the beat go away
Gotta get me outta this day
I gotta feel the rush on my face

I'm lonely, gotta look for a party
and dance with somebody tonight
Cause I'm lonely, feeling empty inside
Can't you make me feel alive

I-N-S-O-M-N-I-A Can't sleep
I-N-S-O-M-N-I-A Can't sleep

Can't sleep
Can't sleep
Can't sleep

I-N-S-O-M-N-I-A Can't sleep
I-N-S-O-M-N-I-A Can't sleep
