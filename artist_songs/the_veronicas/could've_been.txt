Do you ever wish that she was me,
Ever close your eyes, and think about what could've been..
Could've been.

I find it hard to Breath,
When I sleep at night you haunt me inside my dreams..
Inside my dreams.

Look at me, In my eyes.
And tell me that you feel nothing inside.
Cause I can't wash you off my skin..
But I can't see you ever again.

Do you ever wish she was me,
Or am I left here missing you not missing me?
Not missing me..

Look at me, In my eyes.
And tell me that you feel nothing inside.
Cause I can't wash you off my skin..
But I can't see you ever again.

So I'll forget I love you,
Don't want you anymore..
I'll keep on lying to myself, cause we could've had it all..
And you should keep pretending that I'm only just a friend,
Can you look me in the eyes and say that its worth it in the end?

Look at me, tell me lies,
Tell me that you feel nothing inside.
Cause I can't wash you off my skin..
But I can't see you ever again.

Again..

Do you ever wish that she was me?
