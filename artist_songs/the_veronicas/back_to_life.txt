Haven't you heard that we're not right
Don't have a reason left to fight
Shut out this pain I feel tonight
I'm barely breathing

'Cause even our hearts don't understand
Our time's slipping through our hands
Not even God can make amends
And stop the bleeding

There are no rules, only consequences
Something we just can't undo
What can you do when you're weak and defenseless?
Running away from the truth

So get real, get a life
Get a grip, I'm gonna start tonight
Big deal, you and I
'Cause you never really got it right
Here we are, we don't have to pretend no more
And I'm all cried out inside
Make it real, make it right
Let it go, I'm gonna come back to life
Back to life

How do we get so lost in lies?
How did our fate get so denied?
Shut up and listen to me now,
There is no reason

I didn't dream for this at all
I didn't mean for us to fall

There are no rules, only consequences
Something we just can't undo
What can you do when you're weak and defenseless?
Running away from the truth

So get real, get a life
Get a grip, I'm gonna start tonight
Big deal, you and I
'Cause you never really got it right
Here we are, we don't have to pretend no more
And I'm all cried out inside
Make it real, make it right
Let it go, I'm gonna come back to life

I'm so sorry, I'm not sorry
Now we've reached the end of story
I'm not gonna follow this down
Don't you worry, worry 'bout me
This is not a safe place to be
I'm not gonna stay just to drown

There are no rules, only consequences
Something you just can't undo, woah

Get real, get a life
Get a grip, make it right, woah
Big deal, you and I
Get a grip, make it right, woah

So get real, get a life
Get a grip, I'm gonna start tonight
Big deal, you and I
'Cause you never really got it right
Here we are, we don't have to pretend no more
And I'm all cried out inside
Take a chance, make it right
Let it go, I'm gonna come back to life

Gonna come back to life
Back to life
Back to life
