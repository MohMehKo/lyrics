Walk into the room 
I look and I assume 
That you just like all the other guys 
I look into your eyes 
You got me mesmerized 
Your pulling me into your dreams 
Eyes are so intense 
From the lost suspense as 
If I havent seen your face before 
don't know why I feel
your just so so surreal 
I can't get you outta my mind 

Woah, Woah 
I dont even know your name 
Woah, Woah 
But I still feel the same 

How can I fall so hard for someone 
Who only has a face no name? 
Never felt this way 'bout anyone 
I thought you guys were all the same 
How can I fall so hard for someone 
How was I supposed to know 
Got his name I think about the wonder 
Save my broken heart and soul 

I've been hurt before 
The future I foresaw 
Thought about the way I felt again 
Will it be the same 
Is it me who's changed 
No chance of compromise, no 

Is it hard to see 
The future of you and me?
Is it just a dream I'm thinking of? 
The future I foresaw
I've been hurt before 
Then you walk into my life 

Woah, Woah 
I just wanna know his name 
Woah, Woah
Cause I still feel the same 

How can I fall so hard for someone 
Who only has a face no name 
Never felt this way 'bout anyone 
I thought you guys were all the same 
How can I fall so hard for someone 
How was I supposed to know 
Got his name I think about the wonder 
Save my broken heart and soul 

Woah, Woah
I dont even know your name 
Woah, Woah
Cause I still feel the same 

How can I fall so hard for someone 
Who only has a face no name 
Never felt this way 'bout anyone 
I thought you guys were all the same (all the same)
How can I fall so hard for someone 
How was I supposed to know 
Got his name I think about the wonder 
Save my broken heart and soul 

How can I fall so hard for someone 
Who only has a face no name (face no name)
Never felt this way 'bout anyone 
I thought you guys were all the same (all the same)
How can I fall so hard for someone 
How was I supposed to know 
Got his name I think about the wonder 
Save my broken heart and soul
