Welcome to the boom boom room
I like it when your with a perfume
Do you know what time it is?
Ooh, ooh, well yeah, yeah, ooh, ooh

Turn that CD player off, girl
Tonight we about to make a song
I'll treat your body like a instrument
I promise I won't do you wrong.

I'll push your buttons like a Casio
'Cause you a freak but you still classy though
She said she want me to show and prove
And then she followed me into my room
And all you heard was

Boom, boom, boom, boom
This is what it sounds like, baby
When I'm giving it to you
When I'm giving it to you
When I'm giving it to you
When I'm giving it to you

This is what it sounds like
When were makin' music
This is what it sounds like
When were makin' music

When I put that on repeat
She moan to the beat like

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
She moan to the beat like ooh
She moan to the beat like ooh
She moan to the beat like ooh

She moan to the beat like ooh
She moan to the beat like ooh

She moan to the beat like ooh

I'm just touching and tweaking
I feel ya body peaking
I'm sending signals where they need to be
To keep you moving to the melody

Oh girl and since our love while
I beat the 808 drum
And right before you think that the songs come in
Go and bring that beat back in and it sounds like

Boom, boom, boom, boom
This is what it sounds like, baby
When I'm giving it to you
When I'm giving it to you
When I'm giving it to you

When I put that on repeat
She moan to the beat like

Just to hear the sounds that we create
Like a symphony when love me make
A soundtrack of harmony, that's what I hear
When we make music, girl, me and you

Boom, boom, boom, boom
This is what it sounds like, baby
When I'm giving it to you
