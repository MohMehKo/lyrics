Yeah, I'm here
This time around baby
Take you for a ride
A knight ride that is

We're sitting at the light
Just minutes from the spot, and I
Should've never looked in your eyes
'Cause it's sending out a message to me

Telling me to put it in motion
I'm trying to maintain
But you keep on talking sideways baby
I see what you want
It's 'bout to be on
Ohh

We got the driver for the night
So what we waiting on?
He can't hear us if we
Just turn up the radio
Let's get it
Tell me if you're with me
Sex in the city, ohh

The city lights could set the mood
For us to set it off
Don't pump your breaks
Don't be scared
Baby take it off
Tell me if you're with me
Sex in the city, ohh

I got my hands on your thighs
Baby, just enjoy this ride
See them dipping running all lights
Boy you're body's really talking to me

I see I got you deep in your emotions
I could feel you getting closer
One more swerve it's gon' be over girl
I'm tryna to hold on
I don't wanna let go
You're turning me on, yeah

We got the driver for the night
So what we waiting on?
He can't hear us if we
Just turn up the radio
Let's get it
Tell me if you're with me
Sex in the city, ohh

The city lights could set the mood
For us to set it off
Don't pump your breaks
Don't be scared
Baby take it off
Tell me if you're with me
Sex in the city, ohh

Picture us doing 80 on the freeway
(Bumping and grinding switching
Lanes while inside you girl)
And we gon' ride this thing out 'til you get it
All while the city is looking at you

Sex, sex, sex, sex, sex
Sex, sex, sex, sex

We got the driver for the night
So what we waiting on?
He can't hear us if we
Just turn up the radio
Let's get it
Tell me if you're with me
Sex in the city, ohh

The city lights could set the mood
For us to set it off
Don't pump your breaks
Don't be scared
Baby, take it off
Tell me if you're with me
Sex in the city, ohh
