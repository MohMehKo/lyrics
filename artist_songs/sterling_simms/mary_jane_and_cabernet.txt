Yeah
Tryna smoke something
Drink something
You already know
Ready?

She call me early in the morn
Know she's all alone
I'm a take my time
Do it how we want
Just to set the mood girl
I brought some Mary Jane and Cabernet

Hold on hoe
Hold on hoe
Hold on hold on hold on hoe

Okay girl
I know you ain't come all this way just to play girl
Tell you what I'm gon' do
I'm a roll roll some up up up up
When I'm drinking you need a glass of [?] with a cup cup cup cup
Let's get right to it shawty
Chop chop and screw this party
Come on girl move your party
You said you ain't had that good in a minute
Well girl tonight's your night you'll soon see once I get up in it
Cause I'm a give it to you long girl
It's on girl
If you really want you can go 'head bring your home girl
I don't know what you're used to baby
Other niggas talking but I do it baby
Matter of fact I'm a show you better than I can tell you what we doing baby
Girl
Come on

She call me early in the morn
Know she's all alone
I'm a take my time
Do it how we want
Just to set the mood girl
I brought some Mary Jane and Cabernet
So just let the song play
The long way
The strong way
It's all day
It's always
This was all inspired by a little Mary Jane and Cabernet, Cabernet

Hold on hoe
Hold on hoe
Hold on hold on hold on hoe

Am I single, girl you tryna roll
No wife just chicks on the stripper pole
I'm so H-Town, hoe's face down
We just talking what's your clothes doing on the ground
That's game, I hit the free throw get 2 more take 'em back like a repo
Knock knock [?] like a peephole
Yeah I run it in like a sleeve
You can jack that ass up no Steve Orr
Show you why they call a nigga dirty 3 wood
Tryna fit your lines but your cocaine body so dope, let me hit that
We gon' make a lot of noise hope the cops don't come running when I [?] that
I'm just for real, we ain't lose a job tryna make a deal
Feel like X without the pill
Make her wet like a navy seal
Get naked when you work out
When you get off let me hurt that
7 11 you can serve that
Now blow that shit where the Purp at

She call me early in the morn
Know she's all alone
I'm a take my time
Do it how we want
Just to set the mood girl
I brought some Mary Jane and Cabernet
So just let the song play
The long way
The strong way
It's all day
It's always
This was all inspired by a little Mary Jane and Cabernet, Cabernet

Hold on hoe
Hold on hoe
Hold on hold on hold on...
