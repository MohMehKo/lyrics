Strip club shorty
Big boy bought it had to holla at her
Sound like she would fuck the wall in
So I said what's happening

Shorty what the business
Picture you and me ridin' 4-wheel spinning
5-star living 1st class flying
Ill change your lifestyle
Shorty I ain't lying

Put you in some Gucci heels
And let you walk around
Smoke a Latin blunt with ya
Then it's going down
Watch me do my thang

You fucking with Sean Paul
We can hit the bed
And throw her up against the wall
Yeah, you the shit
Ya matching panties with ya bra [?]

Yeah you looking good
But shorty gon take it off
Shorty what it called
It's nothing to a boss
If only for one night

Like Luther Vandross
Ima keep it trill
And you just do the same
And you just holla at me
When you here em call my name

You and me and tonight
Girl what do ya say?
(What do you say?)

(Ohh)

The way you pop it, shake it
Breaking it down for me
(Down for me)

(Be my jumpoff)
You know you bout be my jumpoff
(Be my jumpoff)
