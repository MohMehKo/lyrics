Come in this room and let me take control
I've got the kind of love you lookin' for
We got all night so I'm gonna make it count
I'll make sure the mood is right, I hope you're ready

Oh baby let your hair down
And bring your body close
Tonight I'm gonna show how
So everybody knows
Forget about the neighbours
Cause baby I don't care
Said there ain't a secret to what's goin' down tonight

[Chorus]
I'ma make you scream, ey
Soon as I lay you down
And in these sheets, girl I'm
I'm about to turn you out
And make you scream, yeah
Just tell me when you've had enough
Tonight there ain't gonna be no holdin' back
When I lay you down

Just to hear your voice, girl it turns me on
So let your body talk to me baby all night long
I'ma kiss your legs and push to the limit
Pull your hair while I'm up in it
Girl I hope ready cause the time is now

Oh baby let your hair down
And bring your body close
Tonight I'm gonna show how
So everybody knows

Forget about the neighbours
Cause baby I don't care
There ain't a secret to what's goin' down tonight

[Chorus]
I'ma make you scream, ey
Soon as I lay you down
And in these sheets, girl I'm
I'm about to turn you out
And make you scream, yeah
Just tell me when you've had enough
Tonight there ain't gonna be no holdin' back
When I lay you down

We'll use the light from the kinogen?
And we're gonna make love to Liz Cole?
I promise, when you feel it comin'
Said you gon' grab the band and sing my name
When you finally let it go

[Chorus]
I'ma make you scream, ey
Soon as I lay you down
And in these sheets, girl I'm
I'm about to turn you out
And make you scream, yeah
Just tell me when you've had enough
Tonight there ain't gonna be no holdin' back
When I lay you down
