(The number you have dialed has been changed)
(The new number is)

Pick up the phone, no one's home
I got the wrong number
Maybe I'm missing something
Or you done changed on me
All I wanna do is talk to ya

Work it out, it's hard
To leave things the way they are
I need you right here next to me
Operator could you help me?
Tryna talk to my baby

Line's been busy all day
And I been going crazy
I don't know what I'd do without her
Even though she ain't my girl
I know that she's the one

Although the girl ain't mine
I don't want to let her go, let her go
Let her go, let her go
(No)
I couldn't be the man she wanted so I had to
Let her go, let her go, let her go, let her go
(Now)

Now I'm dying inside because she found someone else
I can't believe my baby's gone and I'm by myself
(No)
I want to be the one to love her but I got to
Let her go, let her go, let her go, let her go
(Yeah)

All she wanted was love but I ain't give it to her
A commitment to us but I kept that here
But now I'm knocking at your door
No one's there when you ain't home

'Cause you told me you'd be
Leaving if I ain't step it up
Can anybody please help me
I've been looking for my baby

How'd I let her get away
My mistakes have caught up with me
And now I'm sitting here
Wishing you were here with me
But I know it's over because
You don't belong to me

Although the girl ain't mine
I don't want to let her go, let her go
Let her go, let her go
(No)
I couldn't be the man she wanted so I had to
Let her go, let her go, let her go, let her go
(Now)

Now I'm dying inside because she found someone else
I can't believe my baby's gone and I'm by myself
(No)
I want to be the one to love her but I got to
Let her go, let her go, let her go, let her go
(Yeah)

It hurts when you know you had a girl
C-cause she was one in a million
But she's gone
(she's gone)
She's gone
(all gone)

It's too late to get her back
I can blame myself for that
See it hurts cause I know I had a girl
And she was one in a million

She's gone
(she's gone)
She's gone
(all gone)
I can blame myself for that
But I want her back

Although the girl ain't mine
I don't want to let her go, let her go
Let her go, let her go
(No)
I couldn't be the man she wanted so I had to
Let her go, let her go, let her go, let her go
(Now)

Now I'm dying inside because she found someone else
I can't believe my baby's gone and I'm by myself
(No)
I want to be the one to love her but I got to
Let her go, let her go, let her go, let her go
(Yeah)

Let her go, let her go, let her go, let her go
(Yeah)
Let her go, let her go
