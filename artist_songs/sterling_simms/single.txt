Ay yo, hold on, let me tune my guitar
Before I drop these funky fresh melodies on you
You ready? 2, 3, 4

Can a thug let you know what's going on
In my mind? Girl, this wont be long
It something so mysterious about ya
That's why I want to keep you round
And everything about ya

You look like you were made yesterday
I see me wakin' up to you everyday
But girl, I'm only human
Now I'm weighin' options

I remember being single
Girls gone wild, steering wheel high
I remember being single
Eyes low on the dowlow, riding slowmo

I remember being single
Going where I wanna go
Ain't nothin like doing me
I remember being single
I remember being single

Now I gotta, I gotta get myself together, I'm trippin'
But you shoulda seen the way I was livin'
Chicks in skirts in every area code
I was wilin' outta control
Girl, you just don't know

I know you're perfect for me
So excuse me reminiscing
But girl, I'm only human
So I'm weighin' options

I was gettin' my grown man on doin' what I wanna
Catch me in the club just sippin' a corona
If I seen a dime best believe I gotta bone her
I remember them days

I remember being single
Girls gone wild, steerin' wheel high
(Steering wheel high)
I remember being single
Eyes low on the dowlow, riding slowmo
(Riding slowmo)

I remember being single
Going where I wanna go
(Nothin' like doing me)
Ain't nothin' like doing me
I remember being single
I remember being single
(Ohh, ohh, oh)

I mean it ain't like I don't appreciate
What I already got, I was a wild bull
Yanamean? I mean come on
Everybody can reminisce on how it use to be
But I still love ya baby

I remember being single
(I remember)
Girls gone wild, steering wheel high
(Steering high)

I remember being single
Eyes low
(Eyes low)
On the dowlow
(Dowlow)
Riding slowmo
(Slowmo)

I remember being single
(I was going where I wanna go)
(Ain't nothin' like doing me)
Going where I wanna go
Ain't nothin' like doing me

I remember being single
(Oh yeah)
I remember being single
(Ohh, hear me out right now)
