[Verse 1]
Its kinda funny when life throws a curve in 
next thing you know you sayin "how the hell I get here" 
thats the kinda situation that I'm in 
I talk about it and you tell me if you been there 
I got a shawty (uh huh) 
who's got a homie(uh huh) 
no matter what I do she wont let me goooo...... 
Damn I wish I woulda just said nooooo...... 
Cuz I know 

[Chorus]
(I know) 
you got a man in your life 
(I know) (I know!) 
I got a girl in my life (yeah) 
(I know) (this I know) 
we shouldn't be here this way 
cuz if these walls could talk I wonder what they say (wonder what they say) 
(ohhh baby I know) 

[Verse 2]
Now everytime I hear my phone ringing I'm scared 
cuz I'm thinking shawty's gonna put me out there 
I got way too much to lose to be playin 
don't know how to get her to hear what I'm sayin 
I say stop, she says go 
she yells yes, I say no 
oh man I'm goin crazy 
and I'm trippin cuz ain't no way I can explain this to my baby 
oh baby I know 

[Chorus]
(I know) 
you got a man in your life (you got a man in your life) 
(I know) (and I know....!!) 
I got a girl in my life (I got a girl in mine) 
(I know) (this I know) 
we shouldn't be here this way (ewwww yeahhh..!!) 
cuz if these walls could talk I wonder what they say (said I know just what they say) 
(ohhh baby I know) (baby!) 

[Bridge]
What is there to talk a (bout...)

[Chorus]
(I know) (I knoww...) 
you got a man in your life (you got a man..in your life) 
(I know) 
(and I got a girl in mine) I got a girl in my life 
(I know) (and that ain't right) 
we shouldn't be here this way (cuz we cant keep on living like this) 
cuz if these walls could talk I wonder what they say (and we gotta call it quits) 
(ohhh baby I know) (heyyy!) [repeat]
