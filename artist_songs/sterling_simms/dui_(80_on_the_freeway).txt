Ahh, what's up shawty?
Nothin', just chillin'
Just left the club
Yea man, I'm, I'm a lil' faded

Whatchu doin' tho?
Yea, I'm comin' over there yo
Yea, I mean, I'm, I'm drivin
I'm tipsy but yo, I'm gonna make it
Stay on the phone with' me tho'

I'm in my BM760
Twisted 'cause I've been poppin'
Bottles of Mo' and Remy
Drop the top for a minute
So the wind get in me

Pick up my cell, tell ya
Slip on ya favorite Vicky's, it's a secret
I won't keep you waitin' long
So just unlock the door

And meet me with' your panties on
I'm only two exits away
I gotta call you right back
'Cause them boys in blue are following me

I'm doin' 80 on the freeway
Gravin' ya body
Switchin' 'bout four lanes
Thinkin' about it

Police are behind me
Tryin' to stop me
But I keep on drivin'
'Cause I'm thinkin' 'bout ya body

I gotta hurry to ya, baby
The way we tear it up
You know it drives me crazy
Girl, I'm feelin' real freaky
Can't let 'em get me

Girl, I know they gonna arrest me
I done had a few drinks, baby
I done had a few dances
Now I'm ready to come and love my baby
But I don't know if I'm gonna make it, baby, no

I just can't let them boys stop me
'Cause they just may lock me
Up for a million years
I tried to fake 'em
But I couldn't shake 'em
I wish they would disappear

I'm doin' 80 on the freeway
Gravin' ya body
Switchin' bout four lanes
Thinkin' about it

Police are behind me
Tryin' to stop me
But I keep on drivin'
'Cause I'm thinkin' 'bout ya body

I'm doin' 80 on the freeway
Gravin' ya body
Switchin' bout four lanes
Thinkin' about it

Police are behind me
'Cause I'm DUI
But I keep on drivin'
'Cause I'm thinkin' 'bout ya body

Thinkin' 'bout ya body
Thinkin' 'bout that body, baby
Thinkin' 'bout that body
Thinkin' 'bout ya body, baby

Ooh baby
'Cause I wanna see it girl
Oh yeah, baby
Can't nobody stop me
I'm gonna do

I'm doin' 80 on the freeway
Gravin' ya body
Switchin' bout four lanes
Thinkin' about it

Police are behind me
Tryin' to stop me
But I keep on drivin'
'Cause I'm thinkin' 'bout ya body

I'm doin' 80 on the freeway
Gravin' ya body
Switchin' bout four lanes
Thinkin' about it

Police are behind me
'Cause I'm DUI
But I keep on drivin'
'Cause I'm thinkin' 'bout ya body
