She never seen the picture on my walls
She can't remember the last time that you called
We never see you when were out
You reside on the other side of town

Because of you I'm a better man
She should think of you as a best friend
Without you this story may not exist
I know the credit should point your way
Cause every single day she says

Thank you and I hug her
She should be thinkin too
Thank you and I tell her that I love her
She should be thankin you
Thank you and I tell her shes my everything
Cause she should be
Cause I know this much is true
My girl should be thankin you

She should be thankin you
She never heard my mother mention your name
When mine was down you were there like everyday
It took some time for me to get it right
By then you were gone
But I want you alone, yeah

Because of you I'm a better man
So she should think of you more like a best friend
And without you this story may not exist
I know the credit should point your way
Cause every single day she says

Thank you and I hug her
She should be thinkin too
Thank you and I tell her that I love her
She should be thankin you
Thank you and I tell her shes my everything
Cause she should be
Cause I know this much is true
My girl should be thankin you

Girl what can I say
You make me this way
Back then I didn't know what it meant
Now I seems I can't forget
And I know there's no room for us
And I respect you girl please trust
That I will always be thankin you

Cause every single day she says
Thank you and I hug her
She should be thinkin too
Thank you and I tell her that I love her
She should be thankin you
Thank you and I tell her shes my everything
Cause she should be
Cause I know this much is true
My girl should be thankin you
