Oh, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea
Oh, oh yea, yea, yea, yea
This is a B-A-D-D-R-E-A-M
Seems like when we have the best
We find a way to lose them
A B-A-D-D-R-E-A-M
Listen

How do I tell my mother, tell my brother
When they ask me about you
How do I tell my sister, tell my pastor
When they ask me about you

Now, now how do I explain this
When I know damn well this as good as it gets
She's usually right behind my shoulder
But now the moment
It feels it's over

And empty spots on my wall
Marked where her pictures have all come down
And the lonely voice in the hallway
Is the only sound
And I couldn't sleep this off

I can't believe she's gone
Somebody pinch me
(Somebody pinch me)
And tell me

That it's just a bad dream
Dream, dream, yea, yea
That it's just a bad dream
Dream, dream, yea, yea

How do I tell my homies
When they askin' why I'm all up in
The club like whoa, whoa, whoa
And how do I get past being lonely
Even when I'm all up on this shawty
Like whoa, whoa, whoa

It feels like I'm sleepin'
Under a ton of bricks
This [?] is all bad
The boy so sick
The boy can't eat
The boy can't breathe, no
Oh baby you got me

And empty spots on my wall
Marked where her pictures have all came down
And my lonely voice in the hallway
Will be the only sound
I couldn't sleep this off
(No)

I can't believe she's gone
(I can't)
Somebody pinch me
(Somebody pinch me)
And tell me
(Tell me)
That it's just a bad dream, dream, dream, yea, yea
It's just a bad dream, dream, dream, yea, yea

You got me tossin' and turnin'
Girl the center of my heart is burnin'
And while I'm awake
I'm meltin' down
Crushin' me floor by floor
I'm all torn down

I'm hurting, baby I need you
And I won't awake until I see you
And every other day I get up
And you not beside me
I know, that reality is the bad
Dream, dream, dream, oh oh
Bad dream, dream, no, yea

'Cause I couldn't sleep this off
I can't believe she's gone
Somebody pinch me
(Somebody pinch me)
And tell me
(Tell me)

That it's all a bad dream
A dream, a dream uh no
It's just reality, a dream
A dream, uh ohh

Oh, oh, oh yea
