Oh, ohh, ahh, ahh, oh yea, yea
Ohh, ahh, ahh, one time
(Ay)
Two times
(Ay)
Three times
(Ay)
Then bring it back one time

I promise that I won't be wasting your time
I'm tryna give you everything that's mine
You're my counterpoint and I'm tryna draw the line
And if I'm wrong then hell, I maybe blind

Be my baby, be my girl, be my shawty, be my world
Be my any and everything I adore
This future of ours, baby, I'm really looking forward to

(Being all you need)
'Cause the man that I wanna be
I can't be him without you with me
(Oh, ohh)
(baby, your love is all I need)

Baby, I hope you feel the same way
Don't let me waste the whole day
You got me singing like
(Ohh, ahh, ohh ahh, ohh ahh)
(Ohh ahh, ohh ahh, ohh ahh, ohh ahh)

Love's knocking at your door
You gotta open your blinds
Baby, I'm trying to sell you
This product of mine

Pieces missing out your puzzle
Match it with mine
And everywhere I turn
I keep seeing signs like
(Ohh, y'all look good together)

Like ohh
(Looking like sister and brother)
Like ohh, y'all act just like each other
Play it off like man whatever
And all I'm thinking 'bout

(Being all you need)
'Cause the man that I wanna be
I can't be him without you with me
(Oh, ohh)
(baby, your love is all I need)

Baby, I hope you feel the same way
Don't let me waste the whole day
You got me singing like
(Ohh, ahh, ohh ahh, ohh ahh)
(Ohh ahh, ohh ahh, ohh ahh, ohh ahh)

Baby, I'ma stay the same
Even though weather change
Baby, I remember back
When I first heard your name

Yeah, my momma knew
Your momma and that's how we were friends
And I swore to you that day I'd be here til the end

You got my heart, you got my mind
You got my love and even when we weren't together
It was you I thought of, so when the blessings
In the air, baby, you gotta receive it
Now my cards on the table
Baby, tell me you need me
(Need me)

(Being all you need)
'Cause the man that I wanna be
I can't be him without you with me
(Oh, ohh)
(baby, your love is all I need)

Baby, I hope you feel the same way
Don't let me waste the whole day
You got me singing like
(Ohh, ahh, ohh ahh, ohh ahh)
(Ohh ahh, ohh ahh, ohh ahh, ohh ahh)
