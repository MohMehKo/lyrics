I wanna live for ya
I wanna try for ya
I wanna stop bitchin'
'Bout what's inside for ya
I wanna change my ways
I wanna turn the page
I wanna write it better
Take time to recite it better

Use all my strength and all my mind
But I could never turn back the hands of time
And I know that shit but it's haunting me
This is how it's gotta be

I ain't cool with it, struggle
Nah nah nah I ain't new to it
Perfect, yeah I guess we all assuming it
That's why I say, why I say, why I say

I'm gonna grind for ya
Imma shine for ya
Go walk that line for ya
Been searching Imma find it for ya
We gonna see that day
When we won't be afraid
To show our true potential
I just wanna show my true potential

I ain't cool with it, struggle
Nah nah nah I ain't new to it
Perfect, yeah I guess we all assuming it

And Imma ride for ya
Like it's my last moment to say
That I'm alive for ya, die for ya, try for ya
Like that old song we play
I got something for you my friend, hey
I got something for you my friend, hey
I ain't talking 'bout credentials
I'm talking 'bout potential
I'm talking 'bout moving you, hey

Use all my strength and all my mind
But I could never turn back the hands of time
And I know that shit but it's haunting me
This is how it's gotta be

Ooh, I ain't cool with it, struggle
Nah nah nah I ain't new to it
Perfect, yeah I guess we all assuming it
That's why I say, why I say, why I say, why I say

I'm gonna grind for ya
Imma shine for ya
Go walk that line for ya
Been searching Imma find it for ya
We gonna see that day
When we won't be afraid
To show our true potential
I just wanna show my true potential

Hold back, hold back
We can fight but we ain't winning anymore
Run that, run that
Let's just live it like we ain't living the more life

Who cares what they say, they don't know 'bout us
Call my ass crazy, I'll still be shining

I'm gonna grind for ya
Imma shine for ya
Go walk that line for ya
Been searching Imma find it for ya
We gonna see that day
When we won't be afraid
To show our true potential
I just wanna show my true potential
