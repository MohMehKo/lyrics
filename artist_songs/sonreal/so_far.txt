So long to the old me, baby
You gon' get to know the new name
Shit was all good a week ago
But now things been gettin' so strange
Cause I'm so far, so far from the one you used to call me
I'm so far, so far from the man I used to try and be

When all these dreams they made up are no more
I'll make up some more
Used to make up shit
Then I threw that makeup all on the floor
And smeared all over everything
That I thought that you loved me for
I was searching for some help
Then I fell in love with myself, blah
Yeezy shoulda signed him, Khaled shoulda signed him
Way I murder shit, you think that Jeffrey Dahmer woulda signed him
Came up in the sticks, had the city on my mind
Dedicate this one to Nas, my version of my book of rhymes
Mama raised a pro prolific kid with a flow though
Black a la K-Ci, JoJo, anytime that I go go
For it like Forrest Gump, I'm forest like 401
And since I'm calling the shots, they call me son of a gun
My saliva and spit can split thread into fibers and bits
So trust me I'm as live as they come
Got a little cold, couple summers, no sun
'Til I found love and fallen to the one I've become

So long to the old me, baby
You gon' get to know the new name
Shit was all good a week ago
But now things been gettin' so strange
Cause I'm so far, so far from the one you used to call me
I'm so far, so far from the man I used to try and be

Extra, extra, read all the fuckboy about it
I've been double, triple dotted way before my ass was scouted
I was singing off key, but this dream was in my rearview
I just took it somewhere, not even fuckin' Siri knew
Pops was mad when I quit everything for this here
Driving home from practice, put the Land Cruiser in fifth gear
Yellin' at the boy like, "What the hell you really doing?"
Now we bullshit on the phone
He say, "I'm glad you showed and proved it"
So far from the old me, Uncle Sam gonna owe me
They all looked so surprised
When I said, "Rest in peace, Dobie"
Got my ear to the ground, I put my heart in the sound
I made a promise that I won't follow others around
'Cause following lead to death and they won't lead me to me
I took my time with this shit
And now time ain't coming for free
I made changes to make change with my A game
So if you ask me now, be prepared, 'cause I may say

So long to the old me, baby
You gon' get to know the new name
Shit was all good a week ago
But now things been gettin' so strange
Cause I'm so far, so far from the one you used to call me
I'm so far, so far from the man I used to try and be

So far from that backpack-wearing
Kid rapping that you're used to
So close to that man named Aaron
That made a name that you can never leave out
And so much for holding back my story
So close to giving you the new me
So far from staying up late nights
Ever since I found my One Long Dream
And so I say

So long to the old me, baby
You gon' get to know the new name
Shit was all good a week ago
But now things been gettin' so strange
Cause I'm so far, so far from the one you used to call me
I'm so far, so far from the man I used to try and be
