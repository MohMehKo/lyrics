[Hook 1:]
Wow, I really like the beat
I got some shit up on my chest I think it's time I preach it's time I preach
Yea yea it's time I preach [x2]
I don't got much shit to say then I don't make a sound (preach)
Number 1 at losing now they see me run the town (preach)
Climbing up the mountains can't seem to get me down (preach)
My homies that I came with be the only ones around (preach)

[Verse 1:]
Ain't too good at this trap shit
But I can do a backflip
Land on my feet on the beat I don't need no practice
I been at this - Got tactics
See the shit I'm doing right here that gon' get my ass around the atlas
Everybody talking this and that about the kid but if you look a little further you ain't gotta find a clue
Moment that you think you got me figured out me me figured out I be coming out the blue
White boy with no tattoos
I don't grip dezzy's like Papoose
But I got bangers and that's truth
Maybe this here moment been past due
Skating down the street with my pants low
I could write a hit song to a fucking banjo
Overtop of crickets with the cowbell ringing in the back played by a drunk homie named Samuel
Got one thing right sipping a little juice up on a Monday night
Dreamt about this shit way before I ever knew we one day might
Now I'm feeling super duper cool
Ain't nobody used to mess with us but now they super do
When they ask me why I do it I say I do it for you
S'why I got up in the stu' so I could drop you something new I'm sayin'

[Hook 2:]
Wow, I really like the beat
I got some shit up on my chest I think it's time I preach it's time I preach
Yea yea it's time I preach [x2]
I don't got much shit to say then I don't make a sound (preach)
Number 1 at losing now they see me run the town (preach)
Climbing up the mountains can't seem to get me down (preach)
My homies that I came with be the only ones around (preach)

[Verse 2:]
Who the hella hella am I hey
Pulling out that driveway
Wrote this shit on Thursday
Put 'er out on Friday
Hold it down everywhere we go
I'm the Lost Boy Rufio
On my fucking Judge Judy flow
Calling shots from the booth in the studio
Everybody wanna get a little bit of something
When you got it how we got it when we pull it out the oven
I'm just saying how I feel I ain't searching for no lovin'
But we get it anyway fuck give ya bro a hug and/'
I'm a probably give it back like twice as hard
New flow coming off twice as odd
Probably because I had like twice the odds
Against me before I even got to write a bar
I'm going off like I said I would
Ahead of my time like ya never ever bet I would
Redefined my par so I kinda found a better good
Even a better great I even found a better excellent
Rap about my life I don't rap about theirs
Sleeping on the couch before I got upstairs
Waking up at noon playing video games
Instead of living what I'm doing with my raps right here
Up up up and I been down that futon line was true
I was bumming at my job and got adopted by my crew
I had dreams to tell my story living loving what I do
Now when they ask me why I do it I say I do it for you
I'm sayin'

[Hook 3:]
Wow, I really like the beat
I got some shit up on my chest I think it's time I preach it's time I preach
Yea yea it's time I preach [x2]
If I don't got much shit to say then I don't make a sound (preach)
I was number 1 at losing now it seems we run the town (preach)
I was climbing up the mountains they can't seem to get me down (preach)
And my homies that I came with be the only ones around (preach)

[Bridge:]
Ain't nobody got nothing
Everybody got something
Consider this a Son thang
Everybody go ahead and run thang and just preach
Yea yea It's time we preach [x2]
I don't got much shit to say then I don't make a sound (preach)
Number 1 at losing now they see me run the town (preach)
Climbing up the mountains can't seem to get me down (preach)
My homies that I came with be the only ones around (preach)

[Hook 4:]
Wow, I really like the beat
I got some shit up on my chest I think it's time I preach it's time I preach
Yea yea it's time I preach [x2]
