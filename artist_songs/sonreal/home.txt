[Hook:]
Days just turn to nights and
Everything is new and
You just play your part and
I'll just play it too
That's when I'm coming home
That's when I'm coming home

[Verse 1:]
I been off on that road okay
I'll be damned if shit ain't go roll my way
Grew a little from them to doe days
I upped my mojo no polo spay I
B-lined for the city dreams from the city of rain
I brought the city of pain to give my city the light
And make my city a name
And... let em all know that the kiddy got game
Take it how ya wanna, I just do it how I do it
Never been about the glitter, always been about the music
Never been about the power always been on how I use it
Never been about a hit always been about the movement
And I been trying to get a long yep I been trying to lead the way
Yea I been trying to keep it real and I been dogging every stray okay
Do he sound like Drizzy? Do he sound like Cole?
Do he sound like Chance? Fuck it I don't even know
Fucking 8 years deep then a motha fucka blow
Ain't that some grind high fiveing time
I been creeping on the low - don't need no friends I got the bros
Don't need there's yep I got the flows
Yea yea I guess it's time I go when

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
Lately I've been giving zero fucks, I got zero problems
I got a 100 ways to get 0's with commas
Off a spreading art just like mural bomers
My city crowned me never crowned myself
I fucked around 'til I found myself
Got enough flow to go ground myself
Vrum Vrum I been going harder than a mutha fucka
Ever since I told my mommah I'm a be the biggest
I was smoking on a ciggy swinging hammers for a living
That was 04 I guess I was my own worst critic
Vancouver down to my stone
Don't need no liquor shots to my dome
To tell the truth about shit in the booth about shit
To prove this shit all on my own
And I been trying to get a long yep I been trying to lead the way
Yea I been trying to keep it real and I been dogging every stray okay
People change like numbers do and that's way before the pay
I was dreaming of this way before today so, don't take me to that place
