Uh, I woke up up on that Sunday Morning
Told 'em I'mma get 'er dude
I was writing while them people snoring
And I ain't talking 'bout no interview
Boy, boy, I'm so left field
I got joy, joy in my heart still for this rap shit
I bend backwards, no backwoods, but I'm high still
Off my last tour, I got new fans that got new shirts that got signed still
Marty McFly of the future but my raps got that 99 feel
I was ridiculed when I first started
White boy with them pun beats
Did a show, its like 30 deep, picture everyone up in they undies like
You know how that feel, bruh? That feel like real, bruh
My new shit bill ya right before this chorus kill ya

Whoa Nilly, finna run the town
We just 'bout to break it down like ain't no one around, nah nah
For my city, time we get it loud
Gotta make my mommah proud and go say "What's up now?"
Hit it
Whoa Nilly, finna run the town
We just 'bout to break it down like ain't no one around, nah nah
For my city, time we get it loud
Gotta make my mommah proud and go say "What's up now?"
What's up now?

I wrote this record while 30 thousand feet in the air
Stewardess complementing me on my side part
I say, "Thank you" as my eyes start drifting towards her breast
She say, "Excuse me, can you look up where my eyes are?"
Damn
Man, I'm buck 50 but Bam Bam when it come to banging these tracks out
I top rope a dip shit, promoters finna pull racks out
Last year I was Charlie Chapman, now I'm winning like I'm Charlie Sheen
Vancouver need me, read the ouija, all fingers 'round now point at me
Like damn, boy, thats trippy
Now I'm trippin' like Juicy J
Where I'm headed and where I'm at be 2 different things, I don't need to say
Dudes want that top spot but working like a low life
Yeah, I be that happy dude, but that's some shit I don't like
I'm saying

Whoa Nilly, finna run the town
We just 'bout to break it down like ain't no one around, nah nah
For my city, time we get it loud
Gotta make my mommah proud and go say "What's up now?"
Hit it
Whoa Nilly, finna run the town
We just 'bout to break it down like ain't no one around, nah nah
For my city, time we get it loud
Gotta make my mommah proud and go say "What's up now?"
What's up now?

What's up now? What's up, what's up, what's up now?
I just do it for the feeling that I get when you around, hey
This the shit that we dream about
This the reason I made that play
This the reason I skipped that class
This the reason I stayed up late
Cause ain't no sunshine without rain, without rain
Like there ain't no hit song, its just my pain when I sing
Fucking haters stay calm and hope I change, hope I change for you
Hop up on that wagon, all I'm saying, all I'm saying is

Whoa Nilly, finna run the town
We just 'bout to break it down like ain't no one around, nah nah
For my city, time we get it loud
Gotta make my mommah proud and go say "What's up now?"
Hit it
Whoa Nilly, finna run the town
We just 'bout to break it down like ain't no one around, nah nah
For my city, time we get it loud
Gotta make my mommah proud and go say "What's up now?"
What's up now?
