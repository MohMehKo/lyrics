I might not find the perfect line
To tell you just what's on my mind
Turn down the lights and close the blinds
Cause all we got is all this time

All I got is time for your loving
All I got is time for your loving
I fell in love with you for believing
Now all I got is time for your loving

You turned me to a better man
We used to argue 'bout my plans
I left 5 months to make it back
Now, I need you to understand

All I got is time for your loving
All I got is time for your loving
I fell in love with you for believing
Now all I got is time for your loving

You were there in them new song days, hey
Sleeping with me in a futon days, hey
Chilling with my shitty new song playing
And that's just so real, yeah, that's just so real to me
Right beside me when I crashed your car and
Right beside me when I wasn't for you
Right beside me when I fought so hard
Tryna explain how I could do without you
And all these flashing lights
Could never outshine what you gave me
Been searching all my goddamn life
For you to let me call you baby

Now all I got is time for your loving
All I got is time for home's loving
I fell in love with these girls for believing
Now all I got is time for your loving
All I got is time for your loving
All I got is time for your loving
I fell in love with you for believing
Now all I got is time for you loving
