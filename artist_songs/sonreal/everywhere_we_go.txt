Yeah, burd n keyz
Who that there, huh
You ain't gonna ask no longer right?
You ain't gonna ask no longer right?
You ain't gonna ask no longer, longer

[Hook:]
Who that there (hey)
Everywhere we go (we go)
Everywhere we go (we go)
Everywhere we go (they sayin')
[x2]

It's me, jean jacket with the chopped sleeves
Showin off a young homie (zzzz)
No no no I ain't doin (him him him) (na na na)
I'm doing me's me's me's me's
Grew up on the type of rap to really make you spit it
So if you see him kill it you ain't gotta ask who did it
Girls said they totally love the way that I'm singing
I said baby "that's the heart"
(They take the verses that I'm bringin like)
About one year ago, I was all on my own
We was trying to get on, so I put the pen to my dome
Wrote the realest shit in my life
Then I put it all in a poem
Critics, said that, I was, crazy, now er'body write they ass home

[Hook x2]

It's me, never talkin' bout no molly
Or I rap to get a hottie on my body like a goddy
I'm tourin' on the telly but I wrote this in the lobby
People ask me who I am, I just give they ass a copy like
"Take, that, shit, and, good news, baby I'm back!
Ain't gonna wear you, that's fact
You could tell by the way that I rap. Whoo!"
Came up in this motherfucker ain't nobody like it
Thought of what I thought up and you I'm gon' write it
Get up in the booth and now it's time that I recite it
Fuck waitin' to blow, you know I take that wicked lighter like
Dollar up in my pocket, tryna make this my own
Critics call my ass crazy now they writing their ass home

[Hook x2]

Cool kid, cool kid ay, tell me what you see
Cause if I see it I'mma be that too
Go ahead and follow me, follow me
New kid, new kid ay, its all I really be
Mama tell me way back I'm a star
Now I'm walking down the street everybody that sees says

[Hook x2]
