[Chorus:]
Why don't we make believe we're in love again
Who says the crimson moon doesn't shine
Where do people go when they're looking for that one of a kind

Why don't we make believe that we're sorry
Why must we hold it all inside
Where do lovers go when they're running and there's no place to hide

Always remember - the day we met in the pouring rain
You were content and - we went our seperate ways
No matter which way thw wind blows now, I'll hang on to it anyhow
Don't ever say it could never be the same

[Repeat chorus]

Always with me - holding hans on a summer day
You were content and - you took it all away
I didn't come here to change your mind, 
Lead you on and waste your time
All alone in the evening, getting day

Why don't we make believe

[Instrumental break]

[Repeat chorus]
