I sense there's something wrong
Not sure what it is
And it grabs me and it's cold

I gaze into the sun
I see myself
I've been bought and now I'm owned

Surrounded by the madness
It throws me to the ground
And kick dust in my eyes

Then I hear a voice
Begging me to search
For the truth that's inside
Salvation isn't far
Time is getting short
As the canyons open wide

No more waiting (boy you're running out of time)
Time is wasting (it's time to stop and start your life over)
Start life over (just turn around and you'll be on your way)

Like hungry rabid wolves
We devour anything
And everything in sight

We kneel like corporate beggars
Dream of only riches
You're never less at night

Anything we want...
Anything we need...
We're addicted to greed

There might be one more chance
If we listen to our hearts
And throw away the crown
Just tell her what you want
Show her how you feel
And slow the moment down

No more waiting (boy you're running out of time)
Time is wasting (it's time to stop and start your life over)
Start life over (just turn around and you'll be on your way)

No more waiting (boy you're running out of time)
Time is wasting (it's time to stop and start your life over)
Start life over (just turn around and you'll be on your way)

Time is wasting...(boy you're running out of time)
No more waiting...
Start life over...
You'll be on your way
