Run... they say it's Armageddon
Hide... we're very near the end
Fear... the promise of a nation
That's getting harder to defend

Come in, come in
Relax, relax
There's no secrecy
Please take more than I have
I know, I know
You are, you are
Trying to scare me
I've got nothing to spare
Save all the shit about spreading freedom
It sounds like scam to me

Holy war...
Show me what you've been concealing
All in the name of peace and love
What are we fighting for?
I thought the point was healing
Clearly I was dead wrong

Truth... beyond your comprehension
Lies... above and far beyond
Have faith that every execution
Will be televised onto your phone

Come in, come in
Relax, relax
There's no privacy
'Cause I am what I am
I know, I know
You are, you are
Trying to shock me
I don't easily scare
Spare all the shit about spreading freedom
It's a shameless lie to me

Holy war...
Show me what you've been concealing
All in the name of peace and love
What are we fighting for?
I thought the point was healing
Clearly I was dead wrong

Holy war...
Show me what you've been concealing
All in the name of peace and love
What are we fighting for?
I thought the point was healing
Clearly I was dead wrong

Holy war...
Show me what you've been concealing
All in the name of peace and love
What are we fighting for?
I thought the point was healing
Clearly I was dead wrong
