Every time you wake
I can see the smile in your eyes
How long will it take
Before I finally realize

It's time to let you go
And still my heart keeps holding on
And will I ever know
That the thought of loving you was right or wrong

I never meant to make you cry
Or meant to cause you pain
And if I had just one more chance
It wouldn't be the same
No it wouldn't be the same

All the tears that shine
Just the rain that's in your eyes
All the tears that shine
Reflections of your face and mine

All the tears that shine
(Tears that shine)

Every time you sleep
Do you ever dream of me?
Am I in too deep?
Having you is all I need

And every time you wake
I can almost read your mind
Is it a mistake
To err is human, to forgive divine

I look into the pool
Ripples form in soft salt water
And all I see is you
And a fool in love

Just a fool still in love...

All the tears that shine
(Tears that shine)
Just the rain that's in your eyes
All the tears that shine
(All the tears that shine)
Reflections of your face and mine

All the tears that shine

I look into your eyes
Ripples form in soft salt water
And all I see is you
And a fool in love

Just a fool still in love...

All the tears that shine
(Tears that shine)
Just the rain that's in your eyes
All the tears that shine
(All the tears that shine)
Reflections of your face and mine

All the tears that shine
(Tears that shine, all the tears that shine)

All the tears that shine
