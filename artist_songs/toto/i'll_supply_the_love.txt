[Chorus:]
You supply the night, baby,
I'll supply the love
You supply the night, baby,
I'll supply the love

I see a horseman in the sky,
It makes me turn and wonder why
I hear the same old fourteen reasons,
Must be the changin' of the seasons

[Chorus]

I met the girl across the sea,
She saved my life and came with me
A tender night of dark persuasion,
Could be my first and last occasion

[Chorus]

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus repeats 2x]

Baby, I'll supply the love, baby,
I'll supply the, I'll supply the love
