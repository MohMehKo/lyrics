You gave me too many chances
Now it's drivin' us apart
I keep on runnin' with the boys, girl
But then you knew that from the start
It must keep building up inside you
'Cause you never let it show
I know I'm hanging on the edge now
But I won't let go

I never meant to hurt you
But something was on my mind
Just give me one more chance
We can make it this time

Stay away, stay away from my heart
Stay away, stay away from my heart

If you gave me three wishes
I'd throw two of them away
I've seen that look in your eye girl
I'd use the last one this way
We've been from rags to riches
But your love can't be bought
I'm just a junkyard dog, girl
Who's afraid he's been caught

You're standing in the shadows
Watching everything that I do
And I know the way things must look
It couldn't be further from the truth

Stay away, stay away from my heart
Stay away, stay away from my heart

[Bridge:]
Remember how it used to be girl
Makin' love like it's the last time
We held each other close
Not knowing what we'd found
You felt the pounding of my thunder
As your rain was pouring down

[Instrumental break]

I never meant to hurt you
But something was on my mind
Just give me one more chance
We can make it this time

Stay away, stay away from my heart
Stay away, stay away from my heart
Stay away, stay away from my heart
Stay away, stay away from my heart
