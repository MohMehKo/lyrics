It's a feeling, I don't belong here
But a man's on the outside looking in
Wondering who's in his old armchair

It's a feeling, you never belonged to me
First you're on the up and up, I only look down and see
I only look down and see

You're fighting me, you knew me, all desires
No lock or key can hide the truth you're keeping from me

[repeat]
