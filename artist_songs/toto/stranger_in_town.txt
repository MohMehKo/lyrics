I remember it was late one night
in the middle of a dream
woke up in a pool of sweat
thought I heard a scream
Ran over to the window sill
stuck my head out for a peek
Dressed in black was a man I didn't recognise
running down my back street
My heart skipped a beat

[Chorus:]
You better watch out, there's a stranger in town
You better watch out, there's a stranger in town
You better watch out when he comes around
Don't make a sound

Got the morning paper and the headlines read:
"Danger to the queen"
Buckingham Palace better tighten things up
The son of a bitch is mean
Vendors on the corner just doin' their job
acting like nothing's new
Scotland Yard's still looking for him
but he doesn't leave a single clue

[Repeat chorus]

Who's this man who fell out of the sky?
What's he done and where's he live?
How can a man who's a criminal be a hero to the kids?
The old couple swear that the ripper's back
They say it's him all right
The young girl says it's Jesus and he won't be back again tonight
I wonder who's right ?

[Repeat chorus]

You better watch out...
