Hello girl
You're good to see
Love your face shining down on me
How does it feel with the warm winds blowing

Hello girl
You're good to know
Love your smile, I love your glow
How does it feel with the warm winds blowing

[Chorus:]
Must have touched a right part of me
A sign in your eyes
You came running in from the start
Connected all the right numbers
From the picture you were painting, of me

Listen girl
I can't let go
The time is right
I have to know what's it like
When the fire is burning

[Repeat chorus]

[Instrumental break]

[Repeat chorus two times]
