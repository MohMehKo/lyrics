Paint me a picture of two lovers, 
show me the lovers torn apart

You made me fall in love with you, 
the dance of lovers takes two
Somehow the music stopped, 
and so did our love

I tried to put the pieces together, 
and I got a grip on my life
They say there's one born every minute 
who holds on for a lifetime
What good is a lifetime if I can't be with you

[Chorus:]
I just wanna hold you, 
just wanna touch you, 
just let me love you
When I see your face, 
my heart cries out for you
I guess that fools never learn how to fall out of love

I do admit I really miss you, 
there are some things time cannot change
And I would be a liar babe,
if I told you I didn't care
'Cause it makes a difference, babe, when you're not there

[Repeat chorus]

I just wanna hold you,
just wanna touch you, 
just let me love you
When I see your face, 
my heart, my heart goes crazy baby
It's starts calling your name

I just wanna hold you, 
just wanna touch you, 
I just wanna hold you
When I see your face, 
my heart cries out for you
I guess that fools never learn how to fall out of love
