Took the long way to the shortcut
And the walls were made of stone
Took the low road to the highground
Had to feel it in my bones
Everybody wants some heaven
But nobody wants to die
It's been brought to my attention
You'll be dead a long time
Now ain't that a crime

Kick down the walls
Shake down the building
Help me bust out of this cage
Kick down the walls
Shake down the building
Must be time for a change

I went driving in the moonlight
There was no place left to go
I went digging in my coalmine
When I hit the motherload
If this world could work together
Like a big old human clock
It would run on till forever
It would never have to stop, never have to stop

Kick down the walls
Shake down the building
Help me bust out of this cage
Kick down the walls
Shake down the building
Must be time for a change

[Instrumental break]

You can't buy no protection
Don't care who you are
Spreading out in all directions
Now it's no hold barred
Everybody runs for cover
From the sun and sex and sin
If you think you got the answers
Buddy just you come on in
Step right in

Kick down the walls
Shake down the building
Help me bust out of this cage
Kick down the walls
Shake down the building
Must be time for a change
[repeats 2x]

Kick down the walls
Shake down the building
Kick down the walls
Shake down the building
Kick down the walls
Shake down the building
Kick down the walls
Shake down the building
