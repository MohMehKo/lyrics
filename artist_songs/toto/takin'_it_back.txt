I think I'll go it alone
You should've shown me if you cared
Lies will turn a heart into stone
Few would have known me if they dared

'Cause I'm takin' it back where it all began
The house on the cape
The place on the sand
I'd take it all back if it'd just make you understand 

Girl how I've tried to forget you
Now it would take more than I could buy
Sure I could lie to myself too
But that won't work seeing that I've tried

'Cause I'm takin' it back where it all began
I'd live in a shack
Eating out of a can
I'd take it all back if it'd just make you understand 

[Instrumental break]

Now that I'm feeling assured
You'd better watch your every move
Stop, think about every word
It's looking like you're going to lose

'Cause I'm takin' it back where it all began
The house on the cape
The place on the sand
I'd take it all back if it'd just make you understand 

You should've shown me if you cared [repeats out]
