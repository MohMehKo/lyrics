Times like these shake up the world
When you can't find the pearls
You once held in your hand

How can all these things keep changing so fast?
You can't count on anything to last
I just don't understand
How it can keep evolving?

I'm in a trace in a smile in a photograph
When I'm down and we talk and you make me laugh
That reminds me it's the little things in life
Ooh That matter

Through the window I can see
Sky's stretched to eternity
It's so easy to feel so lost

All around there are people full of fear
Inside things they've seen it clear
But the noise comes at a cost
And you're lost in a bad dream

Then a trace of a smile in a photograph
When I'm down and we talk and you make me laugh
That reminds me it's the little things in life
Ooh That matter

If you were standing here you'd take me in your arms
And hold me
And nobody can hold me closer
What I've been looking for all my life
Is right in front of me

It's how the sun bounces off a blade of grass
It's the memories that are in your past
Matchbox car with the wheel gone
Tub of ice cream with your favorite song

I'm in a trace in a smile in a photograph
When I'm down and we talk and you make me laugh
That reminds me it's the little things in life
That matter

Matchbox car with the wheel gone
Tub of ice cream with your favorite song

I'm in a trace in a smile in a photograph
When I'm down and we talk and you make me laugh
That reminds me it's the little things in life
That matter
That reminds me it's the little things
I'm gonna try
That reminds me it's the little things
That matter
That reminds me it's the little things
That matter

Now I know everything that I'm looking for
It's the sound of your key turning in the door

Now I know that it's the little things in life
Ooh that matter
Yes I know it's the little things in life
