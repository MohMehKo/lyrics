Reflections in my mind
Thought I can't define
My heart is racing and the night goes on
I can almost hear a laugh
Coming from your photograph
Funny how a look can share a thousand meanings
Well intented lies
Contemplainting alibies 
Is it really you or is it me I'm blaming?
A distant memory flashes over me
Even though you're gone I feel you deep inside

Dance beneath the light with that look in your eyes

I can't stop loving you 
Time passes quickly and chances are few
I won't stop till I'm through loving you girl

There a window in a heart
I've tried to look through from the start
You're never really sure what someone else is thinking
Someone's broken something new
Another altered point of view
Just a certain someone's conscience playing
I had it in my hand
I did not understand
What lives inside the wind that cries her name
Trying to catch a shooting star
What seems so close can't be far
I'm living in a dream that's never ending

I can't stop loving you 
Time passes quickly and chances are few
I won't stop till I'm through loving you girl

Dancing with that look that's in your eyes

I can't stop loving you 
Time passes quickly and chances are few
I won't stop till I'm through loving you girl

I can't stop loving you 
Time passes quickly and chances are few
I won't stop till I'm through loving you
Loving you
Yeah yeah yeah
Loving you 
I wonder when I'll stop loving you
Yeah
