I can hear you cry
From behind the door of your troubled mind
You locked yourself inside
A lonely prison of your own design

Do you feel the burn?
Does it ease the pain when you close your eyes?
Do you give in to your desire
Or live inside your tower of endless nights

I would burn it down for love
Watch the smoke roll out of my broken heart
Burn it down for love
There's no force on earth can keep us apart

Take my hand I'll lead the way
Through the darkest parts of these castle halls
No more masquerade
We'll fight ghosts and demons
And we'll breach these walls

I know you're still afraid
I'll guide you through these crumbling spires
Trust in me to light our way
With these glowing flames that only you inspire

I would burn it down for love
Watch the smoke roll out of my broken heart
Burn it down for love
There's no force on earth can keep us apart

Pure of heart and innocent
I can hear your voice from afar
I've had my share of loneliness
Can you hear me now, where you are

I would burn it down for love
Watch the smoke roll out of my broken heart
Burn it down for love
There's no force on earth can keep us apart
I would burn it down for love....
