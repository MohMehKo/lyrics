If you're dreaming, son don't you rise,
I never get lost, so deep into eyes
I won't give up until you give in, 
But I know you must realize

[Chorus:]
I could be good for you, 
you could be good for me too
I could be good for you, 
you could be good for me too

Everyone knows, but they don't know why, 
How much will a smile, you satisfy
Stars gonna shine, the way that you feel, 
So there is no reason to wonder why

[Repeat chorus]

[Instrumental break]

[Repeat chorus two times]
