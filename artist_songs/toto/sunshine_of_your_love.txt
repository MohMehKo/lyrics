It's getting near dawn.
The lights close their tired eyes.
I'll soon be with you, my love,
to give you my dawn surprise.
I'll be with you, darling, soon,
I'll be with you when the stars start falling.

I've been waiting so long
to be where I'm going
in the sunshine of your love.

I'm with you, my love.
The light shining through on you.
Yes, I'm with you, my love,
it's the morning and just we two.
I'll stay with you, darling, now,
I'll stay with you till my seeds are dried up.

I've been waiting so long
to be where I'm going
in the sunshine of your love.

It's getting near dawn.
The lights close their tired eyes.
I'll soon be with you, my love,
to give you my dawn surprise.
I'll be with you, darling, soon,
I'll be with you when the stars start falling.

I've been waiting so long...
