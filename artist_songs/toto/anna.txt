Anna please turn around
We'll work it out somehow
Anna don't turn me down
There's still a chance if we can hold out once more

'Cause we started out with love
That was more than enough
And that's a lot to give up

Even if you turn and walk away
Love will bring you back somehow
I will wait forever and a day
'Cause I believe without a doubt
The time will not run out on our love

Anna you gotta stay
It's just a stage we're going through
And Anna this all can change
If we turn the page we can start all again

'Cause we almost touched the sky
And it could never again be this right
Anna please change your mind

Even if you turn and walk away
Love will bring you back somehow
I will wait forever and a day
'Cause I believe without a doubt
The time will not run out on our love

[Instrumental break]

Even if you turn and walk away
Love will bring you back somehow
I will wait forever and a day
'Cause I believe without a doubt
The time will not run out
[repeats 2x]

And I believe without a doubt
The time will not run out
And I believe without a doubt
The time will not run out on our love
