Listen to my story
'Cause it may never be the same
And a young man in his glory
He may never see her again

[Chorus:]
Hey Miss Sun
What could I say
I tried to hold you
But the moon got in the way
It won't be long before the morning has you back in my arms

If I could just remember
What she told me with her eyes
'Cause Daisy ain't a member
And her eyes stare as I forage the skies

[Repeat chorus]

[Repeat chorus]
