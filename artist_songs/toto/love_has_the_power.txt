There is too much hatred, there is too much starvation, too much inhumanity

Some people get the kicks out of throwing bricks at me
No real reason, just jealousy
Angry words and bad attitudes is gonna get you nowhere

Watching you watching me, it's alright, cause love will make it right

[Chorus:]
Love has the power, 
it's strong as a tower you can lean on
Love is a fire,
a burning desire, it's so warm

Some believe in the almighty dollar, 
some don't believe in nothing at all
But there's a power that's within you, 
it will never never ever let you down

I believe we have the key to liberty and unity, are you listening

[Repeat chorus]

One hundred million voices singing 
(can you hear the voices singing)
No weak, no strong, no right, no wrong 
Imagine (you gotta keep imagining)
Impossible the skeptics say, 
Wait and see there's gonna come a day

[Repeat chorus]

Love has the power, 
It's strong as a tower you can lean on
Love has the power, 
It's strong as a tower you can lean on

There's no difference between black or white, the light of life
I can hear the children laughing
Men at war, stop your worries, give peace a chance, there's a new day dawning
Come together, come together, come together
(Wisdom is the mouth of peace, of innocence)
