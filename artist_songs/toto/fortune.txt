Mmmm... yeah yeah

Janey can't you look at me?
Take the opportunity to work it out
You said you won a bet on me
Then you say you think my luck is running out

It must have been a fantasy
I believed I was the only one

I thought I was a worldly man
But boy I learned a thing or two when I met you
I wagered big you took me down
C'est tellement familiar it's like deja vu

There's always been a part of me
Baby that knew you'd run away

Fortune favors unprepared
(Ready or not you fall in love)
Fortune favors unprepared
(Are you prepared for a broken heart)
Fortune favors unprepared

Ready or not...

You say you've had a tragic life
That I could never understand just how bad you feel
It cuts you like a rusty knife
Circumvent the storm and let me take the wheel

There's always been a part of me
That's been waiting for the rain

Fortune favors unprepared
(Ready or not you fall in love)
Fortune favors unprepared
(Are you prepared for a broken heart)
Fortune favors unprepared

I took for granted
That you'd be here waiting
Why am I forsaken
While another fool abandons you

[Guitar Solo]

Fortune favors unprepared
(Ready or not we all fall down)
Fortune favors unprepared
(Are you prepared for a second love)
Fortune favors unprepared

Ready or not...

Fortune favors unprepared
(Ready or not you fall in love)
Fortune favors unprepared
(Are you prepared for a broken heart)
Fortune favors unprepared

Ready or not...

Ready or not you fall in love...

Ready or not...

Don't be afraid of a broken heart....
