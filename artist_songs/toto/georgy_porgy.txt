Well I'm walking in my sleep
Well I'm talking baby can't you see
Well all we need is a simple song
For people that wanna dance
All we need is a simple song
So people let me hear you say
Na na na na na

It's not your situation
I just need contemplation over you
I'm not so systematic
It's just that I'm an addict for your love

I'm not the only holds you
I never ever should have told your my only girl
I'm not the only hold you
I never ever should have told your my only world

Just think how long I've known you
It's wrong for me to own you lock and key
It's really not confusing
I'm just the young illusion can't you see

I'm not the only holds you
I never ever should have told your my only girl
I'm not the only hold you
I never ever should have told your my only world

Georgy Porgy
Puddin' Pie
Kissed the girls and made them cry
