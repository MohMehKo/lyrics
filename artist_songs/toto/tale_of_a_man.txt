It's been forty days and nights
Since I've heard from you
Girl I cannot bring myself to ask you why
It's a fact that you're not here
I ain't accusing you
All I seek is simple answer from the sky

[Chorus:]
See the circle spinning 'round
Changing colors without a sound
Helter Skelter 
Doom's day plan
Was just another tale of a man

Let me down - let me down in you heaven
I can really see everything quite clear
I can almost reach my hand enough to touch you
Girl I have it save and sound
I've got it yeah 

[Repeat chorus]

[Instrumental break]

It's been forty days and nights
Since I've heard from you
Girl I cannot bring myself to ask you why
It's a fact that you're not here
I ain't accusing you
All I seek is simple answer from the sky

[Repeat chorus]

(Ooh I love you love you baby
Get down tonight)
