You're never alone in the world
You're never alone in the world
You believe in each and everyone of us
You're never alone in the world

I was born in the lost and found
Often raised in the underground
Then one day I opened up my eyes
Looked around and I realised

No mother
No father
No sister
And no brother
So I cry out
To the heavens
Could this be all there really is then someone said

You're never alone in the world
You're never alone in the world baby
You believe in each and everyone of us
You're never alone in the world baby

Someone said we were family
Can that be with all this poverty
Time to reach out and make a start
Hold each others hands and lift each others hearts

If you're thirsty drink the water from my hand
If you're hungry take my bread I'll understand
If you're lonely you can always share my bed
Could this be all there really is then someone said

You're never alone in the world
You're never alone in the world baby
No you're never alone
You believe in each and everyone of us
No
You're never alone in the world baby

If you're thirsty drink the water from my hand
If you're hungry take my bread I'll understand
If you're lonely you can always share my bed
Could this be all there really is then someone's dead

You're never alone in the world
You're never alone in the world baby
Never alone
You believe in each and everyone of us
You believe
You're never alone in the world baby

If you're thirsty drink the water from my hand
If you're hungry take my bread I'll understand
You're never alone in the, you're never alone in the
Could this be all there really is then someone said
