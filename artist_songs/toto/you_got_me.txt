Momma said be careful what you do
Don't you let just anybody talk to you
I can't hide the way you make me feel inside
I'm afraid if momma only knew
It feels right

If you want me
You got me
If you need me
You got me all night
And if you love me
You got me all night long

I confess I love the things you do
Your caress keeps me coming 
Back to you

If you want me
You got me
If you need me
You got me all night
And if you love me
You got me all night long

[Instrumental break]

If you want me
You got me
If you need me
You got me all night
And if you love me
You got me all night long
[repeats 2x]
