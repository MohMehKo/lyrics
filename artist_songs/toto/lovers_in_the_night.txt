It's just the soul that matters, and I don't know why
You know she's gonna make you cry, you know she's gonna make you cry
She'll have you walk beneath the ladder you were meant to climb
You know she's gonna make you try, you know she's gonna make you try

[Chorus:]
Ooh, you know we're lovers in the night
Ooh, you know we're lovers in the night

It's just the soul that matters, and keeps her satisfied
You know she's gonna make you cry, you know she's gonna make you cry
She'll have you wishin' that you had her come your way to shine
You know she's gonna make you try, ooh, you know she's gonna make you high

[Repeat chorus]

[Instrumental break]

It's just the soul that matters, and keeps her satisfied
You know she's gonna make you cry, you know she's gonna make you cry
She'll have you wishin' that you had her come your way to shine
You know she's

[Instrumental break]

[Repeat chorus two times]

Oh, you know we're lovers in the night
