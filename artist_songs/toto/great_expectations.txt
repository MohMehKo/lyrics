I have great expectations for you and me
And there's no obligations my love
We have sailed across the waters of a raging sea
And it's you that I'm thinking of

Hello to you good people everywhere
New world children handle her with care
There's no end to the challenges we face
Tight tide on the shores we navigate

We stand clear to the edge
So we won't hang by a thread

So raise your hand take a stand for each other
Lo let us share the waters

I've got one million reasons for us to believe in
There's nothing we can't change my friend
I've got great expectations for now and forever

There's no stopping the games you like to play
Am I the only one who doesn't think this is a game
Have you already heard
Live and die by our word

So raise your hand take a stand for each other
Lo let us share the waters

I've got one million reasons for us to believe in
There's nothing we can't change my friend
I've got great expectations for now and forever

I've got one million reasons for us to believe
There's nothing we can't change my friend
I've got great expectations for now and forever
