Stop, taking for granted
I am the one who's wrong 
You might be surprised 
Time standin' still
It seems like we don't belong
You'll realize
Start giving to me all you can
Stop telling me girl just where I stand

[Chorus:]
It's your turn you should show what you know to me
One I've not heard before
My concern you can't tell what you know to me
You can't say it all in a word

Life turns around
Time not to look away
And face what you see
Truth shows itself 
So watch everything you say
When you're talking to me
You find yourself just in time
No don't be afraid of what you'll find on the way

[Repeat chorus]

[Instrumental break] 

[Repeat chorus] 
No you can't say it all in one word...
