Don’t they know that there’s something going on?
What they’re harming with their indecision
But who will be left standing when I’m gone?
There’ll be nothing left but a vision

It’s too easy to turn a blind eye to the light
It’s too easy to bow your head and pray
But there are some times
When you should try to find your voice
This is one voice that you must find today

Are you hoping for a miracle
As the ice caps melt away?
No use hoping for a miracle
There’s a price we’ll have to pay

Don't they know that there's
Something they can do?
To be sure of tomorrow's tomorrow
And too late is too late for me and you
No more time left for you to borrow

And it’s too easy to turn a blind eye to the light
It’s too easy to bow your head and pray
But there are some times
When you should try to find your voice
And this is one voice that you must find today

Are you hoping for a miracle
As the ice caps melt away?
No use hoping for a miracle
There’s a price we’ll have to pay
Are you hoping for a miracle?
Are you hoping for a miracle?
