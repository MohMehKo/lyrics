If you're cool you'll be at Miranda Camp,
Summer Camp!
Only cool people can be at Miranda Camp.

So you wanna go camping, and play games and sing?
You need a summer fling? Girl, I know just the thing.
We can dance all day and play with hairs all night.
We can tell scary stories while the fire burns bright.
We can get really sunburned and then peel each other's skins.
Then we'll make friendship bracelets and become best friends.
We can swim, laugh, eat, sleep, sing and share gum.
My uncle likes to cuddle me until he, sleeps.
There's a talent show every single day, 
And if you're really really lucky you can be my new bae.
We can earn lots of badges and eat tree sap.
This perfect place I'm talking bout is called Miranda Camp.

If you're cool you'll be at Miranda Camp,
Summer Camp!
Only cool people will be at Miranda Camp,
Dance break! 

Watch me go!

If you're cool you'll be at Miranda Camp,
Summer Camp!
Only cool people can be at Miranda Camp,
Break it down.

Miranda Camp!
