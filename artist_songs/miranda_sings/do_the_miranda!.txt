Alright, alright, Alright!
Miranda Sings in the house!
Let's break it down, y'all! Alright!
Here we go!

Hey, you over there with the porny hair
I know what you need!
Hey, you there bro with the camel toe
Come on, just follow my lead

A new dance is here, and I fear my dear
That you're all lookin' like hoes
So cover your backs and your chestical cracks
Cause here is how it goes

Lift your legs up high, poke your neighbor in the eye,
Paint a rainbow in the sky, and wipe till it's dry,
Now twerk like me, but don't make it slut-ty
It's as easy as can be, now follow me!

Let's do it again!

Do the Miranda! (Oh yeah!)
Do the Miranda!
Do the Miranda! (Alright)
Do the Miranda!
Do the Miranda!
