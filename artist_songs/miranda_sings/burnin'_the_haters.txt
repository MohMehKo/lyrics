Get ready for this one haters
I'm about to diss you so hard

I was obviously born to be queen of the earth
I been beautiful and perfect since the day of my birth
Coming out the womb was as easy as can be
My placenta was small, I shot out like a pea!

It's obvi that your jealous cuz I'm clearly the best
It's not my fault god made me #blessed
You say your a hater but I know you're a fan
Sorry gotta go, I got a date with your man!

You wish you could be me but you're not
Burn!
You're really really cool, not!
Burn!
I know you are but what am I?
Burn!
Would you like to shake my hand? Psych!
Burn!
