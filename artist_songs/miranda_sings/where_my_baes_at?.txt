I'm about to break it down
Wiki Wiki
Here we go

Every time I look around, all I ever see
Is people being jealous, and they wanna look like me
I got Tyler, Ricky, Flula, Joshua, and Joey too
My uncle and Lohanthony, but I'm my favorite boo
I got a lot more, but I forgot who they are
Sorry not sorry, I'm just a superstar
I've got lots of baes, and you're wondering how I do
Take a little listen, and I'll find a bae for you

Hey, where my baes at? Where my baes at?
I got so many baes, man
I'll teach you how to get one too

But first let's do a dance break
Break it down
Here we go
This is how I twerk
Looking sexy
What up? What up?
Ok, this dance break is long enough
Can we keep going on with the song?

If you really want a bae, here is what you do
Wear lots of lipstick, and hold in all your poo
Sing to him lots, and tell him that you're great
Bring a daddy saddle on your first date
Call him every night, and call him every morn
Hide outside his window, and don't dress porn
Tell him he's your bae, and he's got no choice
But most importantly, don't forget to keep it moist

Hey, where my baes at? Where my baes at?
Hey, where my baes at?
Now you can get one too
Hey, where my baes at? Where my baes at?
I got so many baes, girl
Now you can get one too
