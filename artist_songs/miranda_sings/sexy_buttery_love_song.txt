Oh yeah,
I see you sitting over there
I'm about to make you mine

You're looking really sexy
And you're looking really hot
And I'm gonna make you my bae
You're looking really steamy
And you're looking really yummy
And I want you in my mouth all day

I'm gonna lick you up, sip you up, kiss you up and pick you up
Nibble on your buns today
No I'm not talking about you, I'm talking about your burger
So give it and now go away

The classic buttery jack, yeah
I'm talking about the classic buttery jack, yeah

Hey girl,
I've been thinking about you all day
I don't have a library card
But do you mind if I check you out?
My doctor says I'm lacking Vitamin U
Is your daddy a baker?
'Cause you've got some nice buns
Gourmet signature buns at that
You can be classic or bacon and swiss
You're so versatile

Melted garlic carby butter
All your buns are like no other flavors
Make me wanna kiss
Juicy quarter pound beef
Hey can I call you daddy
Love at profile own it's wings 

I'm gonna lick you up, sip you up, kiss you up and pick you up
The only thing I want is this
So don't you ever leave me, no don't you ever go
'Cause you're the only meat I'd miss

The classic buttery jack, yeah
I'm talking about the classic buttery jack, yeah

Oh no,
You left me all alone
I didn't think that it would turn this way
You broke my heart, why didn't you stay?
Oh no,
You left me all alone

Oh yeah,
I see you sitting over there
I'm about to make you my bae
