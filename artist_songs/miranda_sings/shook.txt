What up everybody, new year, new me,
You can smell me coming like asparagus pee,
I'm so sexy I'm just like a zit,
Cause that's what everybody stares at and you wanna touch it,
You might say I'm extra but I HATE that gum,
HATERS BACK OFF! Can't you read my bum?
I'm so lit burning hot like a rash,
Put your hands in the air if you're Miranda trash!

U-u-uh, you see me walking by and you are SHOOK,
U-u-uh, you looking at my moves and you are SHOOK,
U-u-uh, you look at my lips and you are SHOOK,
U-u-uh, I look in the mirror and I am SHOOK

Raindrop drop top, I'm my own Mascot,
Never gonna be a flop, I'm gonna rise to the top,
If life were a litter box, I would be the poo,
And you'd be the tiny pebbles that I stick to,
Now that I think about it you would be the poo,
And I would be the cat that disposed of you,
You can call me savage you can call me shady,
But I'm a woman of the lord and a pure lady

U-u-uh, you see me walking by and you are SHOOK,
U-u-uh, you looking at my moves and you are SHOOK,
U-u-uh, you look at my lips and you are SHOOK,
U-u-uh, I look in the mirror and I am SHOOK

U-u-uh, you see me walking by and you are SHOOK,
U-u-uh, you looking at my moves and you are SHOOK,
U-u-uh, you look at my lips and you are SHOOK,
U-u-uh, I look in the mirror and I am SHOOK
