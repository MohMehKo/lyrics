[Miranda Sings:]
Okay, you guys
I'm sick of being bullied around

Hey, guys, it's me Miranda
The famous Miranda Sings
I have haters who are mean, rude, nasty
And all those kinds of things

In my YouTube comments
They're always making a fuss
They wanna be just like me
Those haters are just jealous

Because they're haters
H-A-T-R-E-S

[Miranda Sings:]
They're jealous of my talents
Because I'm a five threat
Singing, dancing, acting, modeling, majitchening
And more to be discovered yet

They're jealous of my booty
Cuz I was bootiful when I was born
They're jealous of my clothing
Cuz I don't dress like porn

Because they're haters
H-A-T-R-E-S

They're jealous of my boyfriends
I have so many baes
But I just say "Yea rite"
Cuz haters gonna hate

They think by posting rude comments
They'd get me to slack off
But I'll just keep on singing and telling them
Haters Back Off!

Because they're haters
H-A-T-R-E-S
