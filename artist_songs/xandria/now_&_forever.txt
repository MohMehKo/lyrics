Millions of songs all these years in my soul
And when we met I just knew they're for you
Now your voice is singing them all
Your wings at mine we will never fall

On and on
We will fly now & forever
Side to side now & forever my love

Thousands of miles through the cold stormy air
There's really nothing that I wouldn't dare
I climb the eye of the hurricane
When the winds are whispering your name

On and on
We will fly now & forever
Side to side now & forever my love
