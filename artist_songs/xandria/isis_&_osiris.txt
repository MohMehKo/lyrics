"I am birth - I am death 
I'm an elusive symbol 
For eternal come and go 
For come and go 

I have come - I have gone 
I have shown you moira 
And her restless re-creation 
Your own re-creation" 

"Never, no never the day will go down on me 
Within knowing him by my side 
So this, o sothis, don't pass me again 
Before I know how to heal 
Who is shattered by the forces of the night"
