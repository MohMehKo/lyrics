Old as time long foretold
We all know how it ends before it has grown old
By the hand of the Queen our hearts shall be redeemed

Out for blood call the bluff on his heart for the queen
Takes the lead and foresees stakes decline here tonight
Play the game lead the way ready to crush and scorn
Blood will fall from her thorns for the queen is reborn

Here I am to live the tale the game is in my hands
Now up the curtain goes though you won't seize or understand
The play before your eyes the fury in my mind
The score unwinding

Your house of cards will come tumbling down
Better fold or pass tonight I'm

Out for blood call the bluff on your heart I the queen
Take the lead and foresee stakes decline 'cause the wild card is mine!
The wild card is mine!

How ignorant is the fool who wears the mask of a king
Whos is deaf to the truth screaming from within
Who so denies the world in his self-loving reign
That neither friend nor foe nor mirror could make him sane

King suicide you won't wither on your throne
Let it be known tonight I am

Out for blood call the bluff on your heart I the queen
Take the lead and foresee stakes decline 'cause the wil card is...
In the game on her way ready to crush and scorn
Blood will fall from my thorns call your bluff
For the queen of hears is reborn
And the wild card is mine!

Oh let the truth be told score before your eyes is unwinding!
Queen of Hearts reborn!

Old as time and long foretold
We all knew how it would end before it could grow old
By the hand of the Queen our lives and hearts were redeemed
And again the truth prevails or so it seems
