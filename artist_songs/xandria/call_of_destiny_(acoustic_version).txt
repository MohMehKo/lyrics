Though my tale starts cold and lonely
The promise that I heard coloured my world
To the - outline of a greater spectrum
Where chances are revealed fate will be sealed

Walk the path ford the stream 'till reach my dream

This is the moment my redemption
This is the day that all the stars align I gain my momentum
Every endeavour every measure led the way to overcome and say:
I've answered to thee call of destiny

Not a course for the faint-hearted
This journey that I'm on demands my all
I will - overthrow my tribulations
And value what they're worth let it be heard:

Gain control self-esteem 'till I reach my dream

This is the moment my redemption
This is the day that all the stars align I gain my momentum
Every endeavour every measure led the way to overcome and say:
I've answered to thee call of destiny
Call of destiny
Call of destiny
Call of destiny

Oh, I'll walk the path every stepping stone
Oh, I'll ford the stream! Time to live my, my dream

This is the moment
The day that all the stars align I gain my momentum
Every endeavour and measure led the way to overcome and say:
I am here today

Oh...
