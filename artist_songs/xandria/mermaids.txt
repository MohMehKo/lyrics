Sigh - for they make you feel alive 
Try - it's just one step aside 
Fly - over seas of drunken wine 
Lie - cause you'll never draw a line 

Don't dive too deep - too deep into the sea

Come and be a child of the blue 
We make the azure dream come true 

Cry - for they leave you cold and dead 
Ride - til the last of suns is set 

Don't dive too deep - too deep into the sea 

Come and be a child of the blue 
We make the azure dream come true 

I drift and fall - sapphire spear inside 
They come for me and softly close my eyes 

Fight - for this is your last chance 

Come and be a child of the blue 
Leave the past, we make it new 

You will always be our child
