Took sense and madness as they come, this circus life has left me on my own
My expectations were my home, but when the mirror cracks there’s so much left undone
Who betrayed and who deceived?
Loss of what I once believed

Feel I’m in a dream, scary scenes rush before my eyes
Wake up in a scream, this is real, where’s my paradise?
Drowned by circumstance, innocence crushed under this load
Will it ever end, where’s my life?

Disastrous certainties once felt, my vast collection of a better time to tell
Knowing my worst enemy
Weak and helpless, is this me?

Feel I’m in a dream, scary scenes rush before my eyes
Wake up in a scream, this is real, where’s my paradise?
Drowned by circumstance, innocence crushed under this load
Will it ever end, where’s my life?

Late comprehension, a new dimension, a newborn child and its fragile world

Feel I’m in a dream, scary scenes rush before my eyes
Wake up in a scream, this is real, where’s my paradise?
Drowned by circumstance, innocence crushed under this load
Will it ever end, where’s my life?
