My child, my fleeting hour has come
There's no mercy for me, no pardon
Close my eyes, I know you're overcome
And I have failed to guard you

Over mountains, through the meadows
You travelled far from home
By the hand of your father
I'm left, abandoned, alone

Hear my voice, remember who cradled you
Who loved you and swore to guide you
Through the darkest hours of your life
Return to me, if only tonight

Oh...

Hear my voice, remember who cradled you
Who loved you and swore to guide you
Through the darkest hours of your life
Return to me, my child
Let us reunite
