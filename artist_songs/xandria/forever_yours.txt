It feels like

Keeping and holding a star in the sky
Born to be born again with you
The days of thunder cry their goodbye
And for the first time I know what to do
I just keep on being one with you

Forever yours, forever yours
I'm here to stay
Cause in your arms, in your arms
I feel so save

Forever yours, forever yours
I'm here to stay
Cause in your arms, in your arms
I feel so save

Loving and fighting the mirror I need
Dearest I'm down on the ground
Waiting to see where to the storm leads
It's my blood that bleeds from your wounds
Dearest you're all that I need

Forever yours, forever yours
I'm here to stay
Cause in your arms, in your arms
I feel so save

Forever yours, forever yours
I'm here to stay
Cause in your arms, in your arms
I feel so save

And when I kiss you
Your lips are the only food I need
Your finger tips open
Spaces that make me complete
Dearest you're all that I need

Forever yours, forever yours
I'm here to stay
Cause in your arms, in your arms
I feel so save

Forever yours, forever yours
I'm here to stay
Cause in your arms, in your arms
I feel so save

Forever

Loving - fighting
Holding - losing
Giving - taking

Wanting forever you

Loving - fighting
Holding - losing
Giving - taking
