Abide with me or redeem me
Fall ends; winter is nigh
With a gentle voice, I'm guided to the void
Where loneliness roams

Rename me like a master from upon your bloody throne
I'll go forth here in silence and abandon my home
In the last light of noonday
I fell, wilted away
Oh mother, please come save me
From the dark night of the soul

I have come to see you reviled me
Reproved me with a sigh
Now from different shores, a made-up story's told
Through my tears of yore

Rename me like a master from upon your bloody throne
I'll go forth here in silence and abandon my home
In the last light of noonday
I fell, wilted away
Oh mother, please come save me
From the dark night of the soul

Oh...

Ah...

Rename me like a master from upon your bloody throne
I'll go forth here in silence and abandon my home
In the last light of noonday
I fell, wilted away
Oh mother, please come save me
From the dark night of the soul

Oh...

Oh...

Oh mother, please come save me from this emptiness
Lead me away
Lead me away
