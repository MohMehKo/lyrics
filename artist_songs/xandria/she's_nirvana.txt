Do you dare to taste her soul 
Do you like to trick control 
Did you think this world was real 
Realize this was the deal 

She's ether fire - burns away all the dire 
You will feel her touch for a while 

Do you see her through the waves 
Do you think it's her who saves 
With a blink of radiant eye 
Would you really dare to try 

She's like a fawn - just appears and then gone 
What reamins will be just this one song 

She's eternity behind her disguise 
You have almost seen a world in her eyes 
But you've known that it would never be born 
She's flown away like a leave in a storm 

She's bliss - she's ether - she's dark - she's nirvana
