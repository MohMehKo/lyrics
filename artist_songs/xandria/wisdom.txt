We scintillate like cedar stones
In plasma veil as ancient ones
In cold war years you were my fears
But just to gain the power to reign
Satan's blood in our veins
The pigfaced mud will be slayn
But noone dies when blackseas dry
And none kill, forever this will
Our wisdom be
Now you're asking
What are you living for
No sense of life
And none afterwards
What I call wisdom is a flower
That can seldom be found
But not in illusions
You only use to find
A way out
