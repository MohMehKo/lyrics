See hipocrisy, In bloodred shade all wisdom raped
They feed their curse with poisoned words
And lead us to their inferno
Fleed the angels' creed, their kingdoms rise built upon lies
The deaths we mourn, their lives forlorn
Feel welcome to their freak show

Oh see the sky turning black everywhere
Our revolution is here

Follow the secret call and see through the crystal ball
The time for the Oath has come, for ending the story
Walk through the open gate, behind you the broken land
Let's all make a final stand
Death to the holy

See humanity in golden chains, but full of stains
We walk their path, deceiver's wrath
Seeling all our freedom
Break the demons' wave to let us be in unity
In seach of mind, all that's behind the universe and its reason

Oh see the sky turning black everywhere
Our revolution is here

Seeking the truth
Wisdom shall rule

Follow the secret call and see through the crystal ball
The time for the Oath has come, for ending the story
Walk through the open gate, behind you the broken land
Let's all make a final stand
Death to the holy

(Hate ruling, dark ages, swords falling, death rages)
For thousands of years this plague has been ruining us.
(Greed killing. Truth murdered. No freedom. False order)
Destroying dreams, lives, the truth. We should have learned
How to save us all

Finding the truth
Wisdom shall rule

Finally our spell is cast, now make our freedom last
All of the rivers crossed
We won't be lonely

(Follow the secret call and see through the crystal ball)
I'll follow you - oh crystal ball!
(The time for the Oath has come, for ending the story)
For ending the story
(Walk through the open gate, behind you the broken land)
Oh I will walk through the open gate
(Let's all make a final stand)
Death to the holy (Death to the holy)

Once - once our time will come
We will all be one
Carry our flame to heaven
Burn forever!
