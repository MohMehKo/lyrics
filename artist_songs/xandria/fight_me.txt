I cannot turn away
From this obscurity
A nameless Force
Is stealing my face

Come and - try to - fight me
You will - never - break me

I know it's the final breath I'm taking if I let you win
So I cannot be the one forgiving or I'm giving in

Now I can see you
You were just hiding
You won't betray me
Cause now I know your name

Come and - try to - fight me
You will - never - break me

I know it's the final breath I'm taking if I let you win
So I cannot be the one forgiving or I'm giving in
