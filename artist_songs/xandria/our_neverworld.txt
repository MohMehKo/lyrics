I know that you feel like being a stranger
A yearning heart, a soul that has survived this darkness
A soul like mine, endlessly craving for more
Somewhere in a dream

We are one in our Neverworld
We are gone, say farewell to you all

Looking at you I can see beyond this prison
That locks you in, hiding your true incarnation
A radiant shine, a warmth that I have never
Felt Like this before â€“ and want to feel forever

We are one in our Neverworld
We are gone, say farewell to you all
The closer we are coming now the more it's getting real
Real for you and me

Together we can take a piece of never
Bring it back with us
And make this world our home

It's all there in the beauty of your heart
