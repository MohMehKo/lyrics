They call for me
Dance Of The Seven Veils
I have no choice
I'm nothing if I fail

Lonely Salomé, Dancing Salomé
Veil for veil away
Villain and prey

The first veil falls  -  illusion
The second one  -  innocence
The third one follows  -  pride
And four was my way back

Losing my dignity
With every move I make
I'm losing it
The veil falls

Freedom was long ago
With every step I take
I walk away
From this veil

Singing Salomé, Naked Salomé
Veil for veil away
Villain and prey

If there's one thing left to see
That's of interest
Then it's in my chest
The seventh veil is me
