I see the way that you look when you hear his name
I see his picture up in your frame
And you refuse to admit you still miss him but it's okay
You're a tower of strength when you're breaking down
But through the wall I can feel your cry
And when it's quiet you're screaming inside
And I break as I hear you
Loud as a bomb
Wanting a shoulder to cry on

I hear you
Tumbling fast
Here and now, you're afraid
Don't you worry
I'll teach you to fly before you fall away

It's in the moments when you're left all on your own
And it hits you from out of nowhere
You try to hide it sometimes unsuccessfully
With a smile that fades quickly

Your resistance to sadness is futile but
You're a fighter, can't stand defeat
You're a magician at hiding the hurt from you
But I see and I hear you
Loud as a bomb
Wanting a shoulder to cry on

I hear you
Tumbling fast
Here and now, you're afraid
Don't be scared
Don't be scared

Cause I hear you
Loud as a bomb
Wanting a shoulder to cry on, I hear you

Tumbling fast
Here and now, you're afraid
Don't you worry
I'll teach you to fly before you fall
