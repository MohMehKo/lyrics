I don't need you to love me
I don't need you to love

I've got..
I've got..
I've got my sister, I can feel her now
She may not be here, but she's still mine
I know..
I know she still love me

Got my children, I can't hold them now
They may not be here, but they still mine
I hope
They know I still love them

Got my house, it still keep the cold out
Got my chair when my body can't hold out
Got my hands doing good like they s'posed to
Showing my heart to the folks that I'm close to

Got my eyes though they don't see as far now
They see more 'bout how things really are now

I'm gonna take a breath
Gonna hold my head up
Gonna put my shoulders back
And look you straight in the eye

I'm gonna flirt with somebody
When they walk by
I'm gonna sing out
Sing out

I believe I have inside of me
Everything that I need to live a bountiful life
And all the love alive in me
I'll stand as tall as the tallest tree

And I'm thankful for every day that I'm given
Both the easy and hard ones I'm livin'
But most of all, I'm thankful for
Lovin' who I really am

I'm beautiful
Yes, I'm beautiful
And I'm here
