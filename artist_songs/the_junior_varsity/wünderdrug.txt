You may think its impossible
For just a couple of boys
Building an igloo in Illinois
And how the cold air
It dries our skin
We can't wait for summer
To come and warm our bodies again
Cause inside these heavy winter clothes
Yeah, I'm like a lit black cat
Awaiting to explode

We got time, we got time to get down
We got time, we got time to get down
We got time, we got time, we got time

Climb the tree in my front yard
Dodging rocks being thrown by younger arms
And in ten years I'll be on my own
And in ten years I'll be all alone

We got time, we got time to get down
We got time, we got time to get down
We got time, we got time, we got time

Open up and swallow me whole
And I couldn't find a reason to be afraid
And I wouldn't mind if that's the way it had to stay
And I never had to act a certain way
Now I'm afraid I'll never be the same
Open me up, swallow me whole
Feed this feeling that's in my soul
Take this song and rock and roll
Turn it off and lose control
