Struggling to keep my head above water
Looking back to what i used to live with
Talk you're losing site of me
I'm always out to make a scene

Slow down this isn't you
This isn't me trying to tell you
But that's how it seems
Talking has never come so easy
Forget you're forgetting me
Talk your losing site of as you should be

You say grow up i say trying
Is this how you wanted to see me
I can barely stand on my own 2 feet
But i'll show up with broken bones and burnt hands
And all is this why you wouldn't believe me
