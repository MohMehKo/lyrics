Confess I have kept 
All that I create
Confess I have killed 
All that I have kept
Pull up your shirt
Show some baby fat to the world
You know the commercials will walk with you

You're a flower
Wake up bastard

I could pretend dead if I want to
I could fake it
I could walk away if I got to
I could make it

I'm still losing
My virginities

This is how it feels
To know
Everyone's got something their running out of

This is how it feels
To know

I could pretend dead if I want to
I could fake it
I could walk away if I got to
I could make it
I could pretend dead if I want to
I could fake it

But you're fast asleep
I'm a failure
Come down faster
I'm still losing
My virginities
