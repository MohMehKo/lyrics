I'm going to be with you i said
And what it had to come to
I wanted to look and feel like you
And stand up as straight as arrows

I'll never really catch you
I gave my warning
But oh when I do
I thought i'd really catch you
I'm holding on

I stopped trying so hard
And forgot i've finally come so far
(i've come so far)
Hold your head up high
I've picked up on the basics 
And started on the exit

I've thought of everything I can
This knife, a rope, a match
I swear, I swear I'm thinking of you
I'm letting go at last
This must be perfect
I will accept no less in my own death
I hope that you come through

I stopped trying so hard
And forgot i've finally come so far
(i've come so far)
Hold your head up high
I've picked up on the basics 
And started on the exit

Subsequently, I can sleep all day
So get back to me
"And I know the meaning to life," he screamed
But you will die before you speak

We're growing, how have we stunted?
So what should he do to get back to me?
