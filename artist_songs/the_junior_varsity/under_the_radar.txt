Well I thought we were smart
We got caught again
Isn't it beautiful today
Somebody has to feel the same
It's all wrong, it's my fault
It's all wrong again
Swift judgement's come
And they already put a rope around my neck
Their power makes a pretty badge of pride
But they wear a good disguise
I'd like to think we're free to speak
How could you know you're reading minds
You're reading minds

Swinging away
We were only trying to be under the radar
Swinging away
We are the motion
We are the source of energy

Well I thought we were smart
We got caught again
Wasn't it beautiful today
I know you'll never feel the same
It's all wrong, it's all wrong
It's all wrong again
And now it all comes back to you
You've got find a new meaning
A higher view
Their power makes a pretty badge of pride
But they wear a good disguise
I'd like to think we're free to speak
How could you know you're reading minds
You're reading minds

Swinging away
We were only trying to be under the radar
Swinging away
We are the motion
We are the source of energy
Swinging away
We were only trying to be under the radar
Swinging away
We are the motion
We are the source of energy
And the sun will shine on us

I got sold to the owner of the highest bid
I got laughed at, mocked, and called a kid
I got caught in a trap, oh you know I did
You got caught in a trap again
We got caught
There's not any way to go
There's not any way to go
There's not any way to go

Swinging away
We were only trying to be under the radar
Swinging away
We are the motion
We are the source of energy
Swinging away
We were only trying to be under the radar
Swinging away
We are the motion
We are the source of energy
Energy, energy
