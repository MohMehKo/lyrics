Georgia's coming back to claim my brother's half
But my full blood stepped back
I work with mercy i'll put you down in the groudn
But this mercy's made up
Take all of the talk like its the blessed truth
But no one tells you
Just keep up the peace is what i say to me
It's a work i must do

Im headed to the coast
So i can check out all the beaches
Ps mom i love you all the way to jesus
I cut the ground and cracked the earth
A hole in december is worth the work
And all that it appears to be
This pet cemetary 
Is where i work

I'm home, hooray

I'm coming home with great intentions
Dont call me a quitter i've got great ideas
Just wait til i set one into motion
Send on straight to prison

Im headed to the coast
So i can check out all the beaches
Ps mom i love you all the way to jesus
I cut the ground and cracked the earth
A hole in december is worth the work
And all that it appears to be
This pet cemetary 
Is where i work

I'm home, hooray

Eyelids that weigh heavy are a blessing
And a mattress on the floor 
To hold me steady up and away

I'm home, hooray
