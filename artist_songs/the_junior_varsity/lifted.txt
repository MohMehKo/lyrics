Now here it comes if you like it or not
It's about an arm's length reach
Who would have ever thought
Just let me know if you're ready to stop
You'd be the perfect catch
For a small town cop
But he's coming up
Got a place in the sky
To keep us grounded
Not a cloud that's in sight
We don't talk about it

Tell me why would you walk away
When you know we've got everything you need
Now you're throwing it all away

God I hate to be such a major dissappointment
How did we survive
When you build a wall around yourself
You get used to the inside
If you ask me to describe
I couldn't find the words to say
I could hide out for a while
But I know I could never stay
Got a place in the sky
To keep us grounded
Not a cloud that's in sight
We don't talk about it

Tell me why would you walk away
When you know we've got everything you need
Now you're throwing it all away

Now I start to think
Well, don't knock until you've tried
But I swear it isn't like that
Yeah I swear it isn't like that
Tell me what you thought now
Because your first time could be your last time
And I can't say you won't regret it
But I can't say you will

Tell me why would you walk away
Tell me why would you walk away
When you know we've got everything you need
Now you're throwing it all away
