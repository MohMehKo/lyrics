You've got a good job and a great life
Strong belief in the afterlife
Spend all your time complaining
So you really should be thinking
Of those people you think you're above
I think I've seen this one before
Where the lead man stumbles through the door
Idolize his statue, like on the outside
But inside he's rotten to the core

You must think that it's so important
You can't keep your nights from your days
Now it's gotten too deep
And you can't fall asleep
You couldn't keep your ghost awake

You think you've got it figured out this time
Hoping that luck pays the bills
Nicotine and a drama queen is all you have left
But inside you're dying for more

You must think that it's so important
You can't keep your nights from your days
Now it's gotten too deep
And you can't fall asleep
You couldn't keep your ghost awake

Come on tell him you love
Help this man rise above this
Blasphemy and tyranny
Come on tell him you love
Help this man rise above
This blasphemy, this tyranny
The circuitry of everything
It's blinding me, it's crippling
You would be thinking that it's just so important
But I know we're supposed to be afraid
Now you've gone too far
You're not what you want to be
(Not what you want to be)
Now you're not what you want to be
