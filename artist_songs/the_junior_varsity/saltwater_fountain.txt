Strung up and tuned to the key of anxiety
He watches intently
Stayed up ruined another day of sleep
He drifts off immediately
And he's dreaming
Waiting for his heart to leave this throat 
Back to his chest
Sleeve's wet with water from his brow
Up to the surface

Talked up 
And beat to the point of nothing
He washes discretely 
Dressed up 
Covered from head to toe
Stripped down naked sleeping off the shame

Dreaming
Waiting for his heart to leave this throat
Back to his chest
Eyes wet his yawns from a lack of air in head

How could i breathe
With this elephant
On my chest
Just enough to live 
Wide eyed alive

How could i think
With my heart beating
Out of my chest
Im completely
Wide eyed alive

Thought process com back to me
I'm practiced but out of my league
I'll dress thius mannequin to mirrow image
Then quench my thirst on this
Salt-water fountain

How could i breathe
Wide eyed alive
Wide eyed alive

How could i think
Wide eyed alive
Wide eyed alive
