Arms that move in every direction
And two hands to help you reach
Legs that grow in the sun
When you're dangling your feet
There they run
You can run when you're standing on your feet

Try to define in your mind
The good that's in your life
It's not like, theirs or mine
So embrace it carefully
You dislike all the questioning
And I agree

Eyes that catch every imperfection
And a mouth that cannot speak
Soul chewed up in the sun
From the everlasting heat
Skin that can burn in the burn
But we're dancing anyway

Try to define in your mind
The good that's in your life
It's not like, theirs or mine
So embrace it carefully
You dislike all the questioning
And I

Your legs can kick around
Our pockets full of posture
Faster faster, we make ourselves

Try to define in your mind
So try to define in your mind
So embrace it carefully
You dislike all the questioning
You dislike all the questioning
You dislike all the questioning
And I agree
