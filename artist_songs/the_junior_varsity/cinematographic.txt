I'll sell you the things that you really don't need
You've got to make your friends
Feel like you're prettier than they will ever be

It's all subjective and it's all perspective
It's all confused and I'm not amused
But it's quickly changing everything that I thought

Grown up at eighteen
She said she read about it in magazine
She found at school
It's like they expect you to believe
You can drive your new SUV
Straight up to heaven

It's all subjective and it's all perspective
It's all confused and I'm not amused
But it's quickly changing everything that I thought
That I believed
Wish I'd forget everything that I want
Not that I need

If I had a car
Or better yet the drive
We're better off to drive on
I'd stop tossing and turning
It's almost my turn to drive
If you had a dream
With less caffeine and more laughing
And steadied your hands
I'd call that a plan
But I wouldn't give in to it
You are what you are
As you are, just for you
Change as you find that change is good for you
Be what you will be
Not for me, not for anyone but
You are what you are
As you are, just for you
