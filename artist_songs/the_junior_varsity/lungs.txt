If you don't listen enough
All the words in the world
Won't be leaving your tongue
If you think I'm being dumb
I wish I could clear myself
Just let me fill my lungs

Would you like to be someone where
Everyone else says
They look up to me

Actions beat your words and maybe
No one taught you to run
Just to play, just to play, just to play
Please show me where we all failed
So I can fix my words
It's time to celebrate

Would you like to be someone where
Everyone else says
They look up to me
And everything changes
But when it's quiet
I don't mind it, please just let me be
It's time for getting sleep

And all that you are trying to be
Someone where everyone else says
That they look up to me
The good dog that I am trying to be
You know that all I am trying to say was
If you think I'm being dumb
If you think I'm being dumb
I wish I could clear myself
Just let me fill my lungs

Would you like me to be someone where
Everyone else says
They look up to me
And everything changes
But when it's quiet
I don't mind it, please just let me be
It's time for getting sleep

Let me fill my lungs
Let me fill my lungs
