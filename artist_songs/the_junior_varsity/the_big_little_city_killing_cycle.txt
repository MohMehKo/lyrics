If trying seems so hard you'll know what to do
You'll know what comes next

Can someone tell me why this floor is better than the bed
Just roll 3 feet either way and i'm still on it
This sense of stability is what lacks in my life
Can someone live my life for me

This sense of stability is what lacks in my life
A helping heart a hand a head full of unrelated thoughts
Now someone tell me why this floor is better than the bed
Just roll with it

And i'm still on it
The easiest mistake i've made in years
Now won't you try for me
