I heard you're having trouble in St. Louis
From the look of it, it seems you kind of blew it
Well how could I grow tired of being useless
When the more I work, the more I seem to lose it
This could be the life inside of you
This could be the life

Please God, I never really wanted you to stop
I know prison is so much less forgiving than I thought
And then I thought

Are you growing tired of my excuses
They're the only thing I have to get me through this
Well it's like you said five years ago
The more you live, the more you should know
That's how it's supposed to go
This could be the life inside of you
This could be the life

Please God, I never really wanted you to stop
I know prison is so much less forgiving than I thought
Than I thought

So are you having trouble in St. Louis
From the look of it I'd say you really blew it
Blew it

So please God, I never really wanted you to stop
I know prison is so much less forgiving than I thought
I said lease God, I never really wanted you to stop
I know prison is so much less forgiving than I thought
Than I thought
