Locals read me
Like I'm not supposed to be where I should be
But I creep
To the backbone of my being

Raise your flags but keep your distance
Steal and skin go get your reasons
Raise your flags but keep your distance
Steal and skin

I fell right at home in my town
Happy day
And step out into the freezing morning air

Feels good to know that everyone here
Feels good to know that everyone waves by habit
But it makes my day by habit
But it makes my day by

I thought I'd be
Right where I wanted to be
So what now
I crashed the course
Could I get back on it?

Steal to live and thats my reason
Steal to live

I feel right at home in my town
Happy day
And step out into the scorching daylight air

Feels good to know that everyone here
Feels good to know that everyone waves by habit
But it makes my day by habit
But it makes my day by

Now I lay down and stare
Watch my walls
Find the friendly faces
Anyone I know

I feel out of place in my old town
Just a day
Another day

Feels strange to know that everyone here
Feels strange to know that everyone waves by habit
Just another day by habit
Just another day by
