Words like butterflies crash into my eyes
A kamakize flight right into my eyes
Words like razor blades slice into my veins
Exposing all my pain all that's left of me

When this shade of this shade of sadness
Little dead will dance again

Now i'm gone shove me away
There's nothing more or left to say
I had to live only to die
I always die
