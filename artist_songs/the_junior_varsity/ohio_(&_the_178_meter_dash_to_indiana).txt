It's back this time only it's harder
Take time rewind you could give a about this
Look at what you've been through
Look at what you've pulled me through
Man somehow this one tells me this could take a lot from me

If it's human nature for us to walk in circles
Then i must be the king of wrong turns wrong things to say
Long after this is over you'll want to
Give in give back what you think has been dealt to you
And this is what you've been through
Lost but not forgotten down but far from out i
Could use a change of key

And i'm back this time only i'm angrier
Take time for yourself
