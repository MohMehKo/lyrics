Like an ashtray
Hidden in
The corner of a room
That im not accustomed to

Hope you dont mind
If you know what i mean

Like a best friend 
Caught up in
A bed of razor wire
Dying to get out

Hope you dont mind
If you know what i mean

Could you arrest me for my actions?
Detest me for my habits?
I've been known to act on impulse
Insert a fist into the wall
Call it all coincidental
Keep it under the table

Just between you and me
This giddy get up's got to
Fix his bones with no insurance
Clean and cover up the wall
I am only accidental
Cut out badly as i'm drawn

Just between you and me
This played out party's parting

Hope you dont mind
If you know what i mean

Try to walk it off 
Dont walk to far from the herd
Try to work it off
Work you weary heart halt
