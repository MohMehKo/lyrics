The ast took my baby from me
And there is no touching here
You've got to trust in me
You were too used to it
You had to come back down

I thought i could keep it better
Together 
Forever in debt to each other

I thought i could keep it better
Together 
Forever in debt to each other

Jwcc bought and stole time from me
And this is what i've learned
Fuck the thrill of the chase
Race is socially designed
To bring you right back down

I thought i could keep it better
Together 
Forever in debt to each other

I thought i could keep it better
Together 
Forever in debt to each other

I can't find conclusions a glue gun 
A piece of work or two
To see another father-daughter brawl
Is just a wonderful waste of time
Back when the slate was clean
2002 i've not a clue
For the life of me
I can't think
I'm recalling

I thought i could keep it better
Together 
Forever in debt to each other

I thought i could keep it better
Together 
Forever in debt to each other

The portrait of
What it meant to be clean

The portrait of
What it meant to be clean

The portrait of
What it meant to be clean

The portrait of
What it meant to be clean
