Bigfoot step over me
Spare me from embarassing defeat
Numb to the thought existing
I'd be exstatic
Would the find complete the puzzle for me
I could be fiction from the entry
The entry

What do you think you know
I know its ok now
Lay down more stupid rules
That only i apply to

Im made for medusa
But hung up on how it feels to be a ceramic
And now you know

If i call it how i see it
I may never call it
Your teeth they talk and talk
And i never follow
If you repeat what you here
You wont be repeating, be repeating, be repeating
Anything to anyone

Im mad for medusa
But hung up on how it feels to be a ceramic
And now you know

Amelia i may never meet you
Maybe the oceans where you rest
Bermuda i may never see you
Just because no one's coming back
Along came a spider
That crawled inside her
Now i think im sick for christian's sake
But frozen with fear of god the earthquake
And now you know

Im mad for medusa
But hung up on how it feels to be a ceramic
And now you know
