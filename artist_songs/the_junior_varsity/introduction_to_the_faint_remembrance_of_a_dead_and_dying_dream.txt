Try to walk away and trip because i'm falling
But who's the one who left you there
Now and then i think i'll catch you
I'll never catch you never catch you before

Why need him when you say that you need him now
Through a cocaine nose
I suffocate did the way the one that's left
About him about him
Listen to what i'm saying to you
Listen because i won't
Back down i won't back down
I suffocate did the way the one that's left
About him about him

If this dream is dead then i'm dead
Dreaming
This dream is over
