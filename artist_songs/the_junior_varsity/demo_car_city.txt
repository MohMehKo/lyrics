I'm driving towards towers tops burning red
Sunny day and your real estate will drive me home
Stay off the main roads for me
Because i grew up in demo car city

This is how you waste a friend and i won't call you on it
This is what it's like to bend and i can't break for anyone
This is what i wanted when i had everything
This is how you waste a friend and I won't call you on it

When can i become when will this be routine
Because you know that's all i have for me
Stay off my back for me
