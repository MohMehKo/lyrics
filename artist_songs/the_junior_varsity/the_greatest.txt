I sought out to be the greatest
And my face among them all
We sought to be the greatest
At the bottom we stand
Together we fall
Since I'm out I'm being honest
A tall tale will do
And come on, climb up though you're tired
The higher we go the more we can lose
Thicker skin, you know we got to
Try to tough it out
Our flags flown upside down
We're in rough water
And twenty years has run you ragged
It's time to sink or swim
Where would I begin
Why even bother
Yeah I hope and I pray
Yeah I cry and beg

I tried to sit on the fence
And watch it sink in
I watch in sink in
So your baggage, store it away
It gets in my way
You get in my way
Don't worry about what happens now
Don't worry about the sky
It's on fire

Born again
Yeah I hope and I pray
Yeah I cry and beg

I tried to sit on the fence
And watch it sink in
I watch in sink in
So your baggage, store it away
It gets in my way
You get in my way
Don't worry about what happens now
Don't worry about the sky
It's on fire
Don't worry about what happens now
Don't worry about the signs
This world is coming to an end
I think we all know

Hey man, do you got a ride
No bike, no shoes to walk
Hey man, do you got the time
No time, no pocketwatch
Hey man do you got a life
Change me enough because I
Yeah I hope and I pray
Yeah I cry and beg
