So tired and half insane
I'm fed a steady diet of novacaine
But it's not enough to numb the pain
But when the sky, the sky comes falling down
And our burned up bodies reach into the ground
There's voices from all around
But we don't make a sound

So if this is the end
I hope it goes as planned

Good God damn, those boys are blue
You know it's good for them
It better be good for you
And what did they really expect us to do
Just keep quiet and don't be afraid
Just stay hungry for that minimum wage
We got a war to fight
And mouths to feed
So don't you complain to me

So if this is the end
I hope it goes as planned
You can't hide your bloody hands from me

Once I had this dream where
Everything's as good as it seems and
Love was really all that we needed
All that we needed
All that we needed
I wish I never wpke up

So if this is the end
I hope it goes as planned
Can't hide your bloody hands
(Can't hide your bloody hands from me)
So if this is the end
I hope it goes as planned
Can't hide your bloody hands
