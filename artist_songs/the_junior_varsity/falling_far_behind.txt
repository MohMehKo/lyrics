Sentimental whispers
Drawing through my breath
And i am hearing every word you said
All these distractions
Everything i know
Here i stand now
Nothing left to show

I am waiting, waiting on the line
Falling fast and falling far behind

Now i have these
Wasted thoughts instead
Circle everything
Cycle in my head
