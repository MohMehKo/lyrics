I wanted to tell you
If you don't make it out
I wanted to show you
Here's your ticket out
Been here forever
Because i've been around
Said leave for nothing
Nothing is here tonight

I will be there
I will be there
Fallin down tonight

I wanted to show you
That i understand
I've been here forever
Because i'm holdin your hand

And i want to tell you that i'm lying down
And i want to tell you this
