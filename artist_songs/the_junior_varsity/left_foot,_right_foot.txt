Watch me become what i wasn't to those who know me so well
I'll be home forever sorry fellow griggoneers
This is the first time
That i am dressed to kill someone else
This is the last time
I now keep to myself

I take back everything i said because everything feels different
I've become everything i hate but things are getting better
I learn from my mistakes because i have made so many
In this whole new hole a home for me

In my new city
I'll be stronger

And this is what i made this is where i'll stay
This is what you say
This is just a phase

And you're changing and
I'm changing
Why change things
