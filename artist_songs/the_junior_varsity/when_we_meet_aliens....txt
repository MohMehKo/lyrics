I see no ground or sky
I "don't not" see people
And sometimes I do

I have no time to waste
Searching for answers
To questions that have none
We'll all die, I can live with that.

You say you found a way to sit inside my skin
I say "don't worry" cause it's coming around again
I finally found a way to fit inside my skin
I begged "don't worry" cause I always come through in the end

Dont keep a collection
Piling up up
Counting all of your karma

But you are still
Searching for answers
To questions that have none
We'll all die, I can live with that.
