You spin me right round, baby
Right round like a record, baby
Right round, right round
You spin me right round, baby
Right round like a record, baby
Right round, right round

I get to know your name
Well if I could trace your private number, baby
All I know is that to me
You look like you're lots of fun
Open up your lovin' arms
I want some, want some

You spin me right round, baby
Right round like a record, baby
Right round, right round
You spin me right round, baby
Right round like a record, baby
Right round, right round

I set my sights on you
And I, I've got to have my way now, baby
All I know is that to me
You look like you're having fun
Open up you lovin' arms
Watch out here I come

I got to be your friend now, baby
And I would like to move in just
A little bit closser
All I know is that to me
You look like you're lots of fun
Open up your lovin' arms
Whatch out, here I come

You spin me right round, baby
Right round like a record, baby
Right round, right round
You spin me right round, baby
Right round like a record, baby
Right round, right round

I got to be your friend now, baby
And I would like to move in just
A little bit closer
And I, I've got to have my way now, baby
All I know is that to me
You look like you're having fun
Open up you lovin' arms
Watch out here I come

You spin me right round, baby
Right round like a record, baby
