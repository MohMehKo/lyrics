Something's got control of me
Feels like I'm in a trance
Electricity runs through me
Makes me wanna dance
Take me in your arms
'Cause I wanna dance all night with you
When you move I feel your magic running through me
I grow helpless as we dance the night away

Dance, dance
I can't control it
You're making me really want it
The way you move to the rhythm
It's taking over me
You dance
Dance
I want you badly
I'm in a trance
Come and help me
'Cause I can't stop going crazy
Just satisfy me, baby
Dance, dance

Hypnotizing rhythms make me move
At your command
I can be your slave
And dance all night if you demand
You make me lose my mind
And I can't take it any longer
I feel the power that you have
It's getting stronger
Baby, let's dance the whole night away

Dance, dance
I can't control it
You're making me really want it
The way you move to the rhythm
It's taking over me
You dance
Dance
I want you badly
I'm in a trance
Come and help me
'Cause I can't stop going crazy
Just satisfy me, baby
Dance, dance

You totally control
Every part of me
Don't you know what kind of vibe
You're sending to me?
Dance

Dance, dance
I can't control it
You're making me really want it
The way you move to the rhythm
It's taking over me
You dance
Dance
I want you badly
I'm in a trance
Come and help me
'Cause I can't stop going crazy
Just satisfy me, baby
Dance, dance
