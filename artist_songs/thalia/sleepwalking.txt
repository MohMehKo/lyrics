Red colors me
Left here, alone
That's how it feels
I'm lost, guide me

Tell me I'm sleepwalking
Tell me I'm dreaming all of this
Tell me I've gotta wake up soon

What have you done?
I'm down on my knees
Broken hearts cry with me
I can't wash your hands clean

Tell me I'm sleepwalking
Tell me I'm dreaming all of this
Tell me I've gotta wake up soon

Tell me it was just a nightmare
Tell me it was all a big mistake
Tell I've got to wake up soon

Tell me, wake me up
Tell me, wake me up
Tell me, wake me up

Tell me I'm sleepwalking
Tell me I'm dreaming all of this
Tell me I've gotta wake up - I've gotta wake up soon

Tell me it was just a nightmare
Tell me it was all a big mistake
Tell I've got to wake up soon

Tell me I'm sleepwalking
