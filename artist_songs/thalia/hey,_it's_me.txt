Hey, it's me 
I hope you'd still remember 
Your old friend and then 
We can talk and laugh again 
Hey, it's me 
I never thought I'd see you 
Once again and I just can't 
Believe you're right here with me 
Now, lookin' 
Starin' and talkin' 
Telling me things that you've 
Done all these years 

Hey, it's me 
The one who'll always care for you 
Oh, yes, it's me 
The one who'll always love you 
I just hope you still remember 
And I wish it crossed your mind 
All the memories that we have left behind 

Hey, it's me 
Now that you're back in my arms 
You'll see, I'll always keep you 
Here in my heart 

Hey, it's me 
I never thought I'd feel this love again 
And I just can't 
Believe you're right here with me 
Now lookin', lovin' and feelin' 
Sharing this love for the rest of our lives
