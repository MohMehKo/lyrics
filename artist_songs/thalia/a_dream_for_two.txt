[Verse]

With you
I can't control myself
You chip away the stone
And I become a puppet on a string
You dominate and rule
Don't lose time because this love is completely
automatic

It's
Passion all night long
Kissing all night long
A ritual of love our time to be alone
Connection of the souls
Lifts our hearts up to the heavens

[Chorus]

Oh yes I found a Dream for Two
Secret Heaven
So powerful it leaves us defenseless

I know this is a Dream for Two
Deep inside me
Down in the center of my soul
Your love surrounds me
Inside a world only for two

[Verse 2]

I'm
Feeling so confused
I shake with every move
You hypnotize me I lose all my fears
I fall down on my knees
And you completely take control

It's
A battle in my mind
The biggest of my life
You occupy the empty space inside
You keep my heart alive
I need your love to keep on breathing

[Chorus 2]

Oh yes I found a Dream for two
Secret heaven
So powerful it leaves us defenseless

I know this is a Dream For two
Deep inside me
Down in the center of my soul
Your love surrounds me
I know this is a Dream For two

Secret Heaven
So powerful it leaves us defenseless

I know this is a Dream For two
Deep inside me
Down in the center of my soul
Your love surrounds me
Inside a world only for us
Inside a world only for us

[Chorus 3]

Oh yes I found a Dream for two
Secret Heaven
So powerful it leaves us defenseless

I know this is a Dream For two
Deep inside me
Down in the center of my soul
Your love surrounds me
Oh yes I found a Dream For two

Secret Heaven
So powerful it leaves us defenseless

I know this is a Dream For two
Deep inside me
Down in the center of my soul
Your love surrounds me
Inside a world only for Two
