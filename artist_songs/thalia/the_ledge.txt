Can you see me on the ledge?
My feet are dangling off it
I see people below
I'll give them a show

There are cars speeding by
And there are stars in the sky
I don't need you to tell me
Not to jump into what I see

'Cause I can't, and I won't, no I could never hurt you
I can't, and I won't

Let's go back to the start
You walk in, a work of art
I just had to get to know you
Now look at all we've been through

From the first time I saw you cry
To those times I fell for your lies
I really wanted to quit
But, then you promised me this

From now on
I can't, and I won't, no I could never hurt you
I can't, and I won't

'Cause this is something I will always work for
This is us

And I said
I can't, and I won't, no I could never hurt you
I can't, and I won't

'Cause this is something I will always work for
This is us
