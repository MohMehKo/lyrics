Somewhere I have to be
Somewhere far, far from here
Paris, Rome, London, home
They're nothing like when I'm with you

'Cause I wanna kiss you
I don't know what to do
'Cause you don't want me to

Sinking ships and fragile minds
A golden watch that can't tell time
They don't mean that much to me
Passing things that I have seen

'Cause I wanna kiss you
I don't know what to do
'Cause you don't want me to

And I have traveled many lands
Fought through forests, ran through sand
I'm so glad to be away
Sometimes I wish you'd said to stay

'Cause I wanna kiss you
I don't know what to do
'Cause you, don't want me to

Maybe I should've told you
Maybe I should have stayed

'Cause I wanna kiss you
I don't know what to do
'Cause you might want me to

There's somewhere I have to be
Somewhere far, far from here
