I can do this, or I can do that
I can move around you, out of my hat
Baby I will, maybe all that
First you gotta tell me if you don't wanna be 
The one who picks me up whenever I am down
Baby there's nothing I can do for you
Now you gotta let me know what's it gonna be boy

[Chorus:]

What's it gonna be boy
You gotta let me know now
What's it gonna be boy
Cuz I just need to hear the word from you
Just let me know 
Whatever's on your mind
I can take care of anything you need
Baby just tell me what's it gonna be

[Verse Two:]

There can be rain, wherever I'm at
Cuz I can make the sun shine just like that
If I can make anything appear
Right before your eyes when it's not there
I can be that someone in your life
That makes everything right
Baby there's so much I can do for you
But you gotta let me know what's it gonna be

[Chorus:]

What's it gonna be boy
You gotta let me know now
What's it gonna be boy
Cuz I just need to hear the word from you now
Just let me know 
Whatever's on your mind
I can take care of anything you need
Baby just tell me what's it gonna be

[Verse Three:]

If you have a doubt, I'll prove it
I'm just tryin to baby, tryin to baby, trust me
Now there's nothing you can ask that I won't do
For you

What's it gonna be
Just let me know
What's it gonna be
Just let me know
Just let me know
What's it gonna be
Just let me know
Just let me know
If I can tell you anything you need

What's it gonna be boy (what's it gonna be boy)
Cuz I just need to hear the word from you
Just let me know 
Whatever's on your mind
I can take care of anything you need
Baby just tell me what's it gonna be

[Chorus:]

What's it gonna be boy
You gotta let me know now
What's it gonna be boy
Cuz I just need to hear the word from you
Just let me know 
Whatever's on your mind
I can take care of anything you need
Baby just tell me what's it gonna be
