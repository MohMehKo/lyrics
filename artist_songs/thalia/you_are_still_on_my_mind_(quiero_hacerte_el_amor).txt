There's no secrets left between us
When we kissed it didn't matter who'd see us
No one at all
But tonight were not together
I don't want to keep tossing and turning
I miss u that's all
And I can't stop thinking' about you
And I cant start letting you go
You are still on my mind
It's so easy to love you
I've got only one desire oooh baby
You are still on my mind
And I cant help but wonder
If you could love me one more time
Take my loneliness and break it
Every song brings back sweet memories Of love
Or was it real love?
Because tonight were not together
And I don't want to keep tossing and turning
I want u to call
'Coz I can't stop thinking about you
And I can't start letting u go
You are still on my mind
It's so easy to love you
And I'm wanting u more than ever
You are still on my mind
And I cant help but wonder
If you could love me one more time
You are still on my mind
It's so easy to love you
I've got only one desire oooh baby 
You are still on my mind 
It's so easy to love you 
I've got only one desire oooh baby 
You are still on my mind 
And I can't help but wonder 
If you could love me one more time
oooooh
