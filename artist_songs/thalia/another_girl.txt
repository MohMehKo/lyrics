[Chorus:]
I can give you up
I'm so in love
I will share you with another girl
I swear this true
I'll do anything
Cuz the taste of your loving was everything

[Verse One:]
I know about your girl at home
I know everything about you
I know it's her you're going to
At the end of every night
I can tell you want me
And there's something that you're missing
Other wise we wouldn't be here
Hugging and kissing

[Bridge:]
He's got the sex appeal
That turns me on
When talking on the phone
I know what's wrong
No I can't resist
The way we kicking it
I just can't leave without him

[Chorus x2]

[Verse Two:]
Everyday I tell myself
That it's time to do the right thing
Gotta walk away before
Your baby gets to know
But just as I pick up the phone
And I start to dial your number
The devil on my shoulder
Says 'Damn it girl don't let him know'

[Bridge]

[Chorus x2]

[Verse Three:]
We can go, if you wanna go
We don't have to make a show, never let it show
We can make it if you want, if you really want
I will share you with another girl
We can roll, if you wanna roll
We don't have to make a show, never let it show
We can make it if you want, if you really want
I will share you with another girl

[Chorus x4]
