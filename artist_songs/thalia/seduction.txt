[Verse]
I can't help all my feelings of temptation
Everytime you touch me
The way that you provoke me
I run away
Just gotta get away
Your kiss is pure Seduction
Your love is my addiction

Can't go back but I gotta let go
Your powerful desire
Has set my soul on fire
This world keeps turning, my heart keeps yearning
It's beating like a drum roll
You make me want to lose control

[Chorus]
My heart keeps racing
It won't slow down
I'm starting to get weak and I
Don't think I can take no more
Can't think straight
And I don't know what to do
I'm gonna lose my mind
Cause all I do is think of you
[x2]

[Verse]
Your Seduction's
A dangerous potion
Spreads like wild fire
All over every inch of me
There's no defense
Your love is too intense
I feel it in my body
You always keep on haunting me

Your Seduction's
A dangerous potion
Spreads like wild fire
All over every inch of me
There's no defense
Your love is too intense
I can feel it "Your Seduction"

[Chorus]
My heart keeps racing
It won't slow down
I'm starting to get weak and I
Don't think I can take no more
Can't think straight
And I don't know what to do
I'm gonna lose my mind
Cause all I do is think of you
[x2]

[Bridge]
Can't you see what your love is doing to me
I can't breath, I can't sleep
I don't know what to do
You took my heart and my soul
Got no choice
I'm so in love with you
I think I'm losing my mind

Your Seduction's
A dangerous potion
Spreads like wild fire
All over every inch of me
There's no defense
Your love is too intense
I feel it in my body
You always keep on haunting me

[Chorus / OUT]
