In this life I don't
In this life I don't
In this life I don't take chances

I try to stay safe
I try to stay safe
I play it safe inside of my walls

Now I'm gonna risk it
I'm gonna risk

The way that you smile
The way you dress in style
The way my heart runs wild for you

The forest trail we hiked
The bookstore we both liked
The poems I could write about us

Now I'm gonna risk it
I'm gonna risk

'Cause you know I'm as shy as they come
I won't pour my heart out for anyone
But this time it's exactly what I'll do
I'm gonna risk it all to say "I love you"

In this life I don't
In this life I don't
In this life I don't take chances

I try to stay safe
I try to stay safe
I play it safe inside of my walls

Now I'm gonna risk it
I'm gonna risk

'Cause you know I'm as shy as they come
I won't pour my heart out for anyone
But this time it's exactly what I'll do
I'm gonna risk it all and say "I love you"
I'm gonna risk it all and say "I love you"
