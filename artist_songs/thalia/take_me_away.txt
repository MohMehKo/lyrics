Take what you want from me
I'll give you the world, you'll see
My love, you are all that I need
And I'll always love you

'Cause I feel every heartbeat
When your skin and mine do meet
We'll walk in the sand with bare feet
And I'll always love you

Take my hand, take my heart, just take me away
'Cause I can't feel, and I can't breathe
My love's too strong, it'll all go wrong, do we belong?

You blew away my walls
And let me fall for your soul
I don't live unless you're around me
And I'll always love you

Broke my heart in pieces
When you walked away, so please
Don't say that it's over between us
'Cause I still love you

Love me then, love me now, I'll love you now
'Cause I am yours, and I want more
From your heart, can we restart, and never part?

Take my hand, take my heart, just take me away
'Cause I can't feel, and I can't breathe
My love's too strong, it'll all go wrong, do we belong?
