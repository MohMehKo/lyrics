All this time I've been trying hard to hear you
To understand you and to console you
I know your life, and it's never been that simple
But now's the time to close the circle

To start over again it's something scary
I know those bruises in your heart are there forever
But now's the time to start again stronger than ever
And show the world in your own way that you are never gonna go through this again

You know he never loved you, you know he never wanted you
He stabbed you in the back and he broke your heart in half
But that will make you stronger, no suffering, no longer
You learned from your mistakes and there ain't no coming back

Now go enjoy your life and you're gonna laugh so hard
You're never gonna cry once again for a guy
You know he never loved you, you know he never wanted you
But at least you learned somehow

But if now you cannot stop thinking of his love
And his kisses, and his caresses
If in the night can't sleep because you miss him
Just remember the thing you've been through

To start over again it's something scary
I know those bruises in your heart are there forever
But now's the time to start again stronger than ever
And show the world in your own way that you are never gonna go through this again

You know he never loved you, you know he never wanted you
He stabbed you in the back and he broke your heart in half
But that will make you stronger, no suffering, no longer
You learned from your mistakes and there ain't no coming back

Now go enjoy your life and you're gonna laugh so hard
You're never gonna cry once again for a guy
You know he never loved you, you know he never wanted you
But at least you learned somehow

But now's the time to start again stronger than ever
And show the world in your own way that you are never gonna go through this again

You know he never loved you, you know he never wanted you
He stabbed you in the back and he broke your heart in half
But that will make you stronger, no suffering, no longer
You learned from your mistakes and there ain't no coming back

Now go enjoy your life and you're gonna laugh so hard
You're never gonna cry once again for a guy
You know he never loved you, you know he never wanted you
But at least you learned somehow
