You're my angel, my angel
Sent from heaven above
Like a song in the night
You're my sweet lullaby
Please tell me you're mine

I need you close to me
Close to my heart
You took my breath away
Right from the start

Cover me with tender kisses
Wrap me with your sweet embrace tonight
Let me build my world around you
Let my loving arms surround you tonight

You're my angel, my angel
Make my dreams come true
Take my sadness away
All that's empty and gray
Please tell me you'd stay

Baby, wanna be with you forever
Sweet angel, I need you right now
Oh baby, baby, please
