I ran through the rain with you, in my mind
I held hands and laughed with you, in my mind
I took shelter from the rain with you, in my mind
Then we kissed under that roof, oh we kissed, in my mind

So, come meet me in my dreams that's where I'll be

I made pancakes in the morning for you, in my mind
I bought tickets to a concert for you, in my mind
Oh, I sang this song for you, in my mind
Then I leaned in for a kiss, oh we kissed, in my mind

So, come meet me in my dreams that's where I'll be
And can't you see me by the stream, a pleasant scene
To meet me

So, come meet me in my dreams that's where I'll be
So, meet me
