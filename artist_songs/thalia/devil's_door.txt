I used to be afraid of the dark
What once scared me I now find comfort in
And I lied so much I believed myself
And now I've got nowhere to run

'Cause I've been here before
Knocking on the devil's door
I'm gonna ask him, I'm gonna ask him
I'm gonna ask him to take you away from me
I'm gonna ask him to take you away

You don't wanna know what's behind my smile
I pretend like it's nothing when it's not
And I'll find a way to get back at you
So, now you've got nowhere to run

'Cause I've been here before
Knocking on the devil's door
I'm gonna ask him, I'm gonna ask him
I'm gonna ask him to take you away from me
I'm gonna ask him to take you away

'Cause I've got you on the floor
You're begging me "please, no more"

'Cause I've been here before
Knocking on the devil's door
I'm gonna ask him, I'm gonna ask him
I'm gonna ask him to take you away from me
I'm gonna ask him to take you away
I'm gonna ask him, I'm gonna ask him
I'm gonna ask him to take you away from me
I'm gonna ask him to take you away
