These muddy waters are flowing by my neck
I wade out further until you see nothing but my head

I'll drown with the sunset, maybe that's a lie
If not in this river, then the thoughts that are clouding my mind

Demons wage a war
They're coming for my soul
I'll fight until I win
Or, until I can't fight them anymore

Sunset river
Sunset river

I swim against the current, but it's pulling me down
Past tombs and clock-towers, past forsaken ghost towns

I float to an island, the sand is rough on my skin
How far have I gotten? Will I find my way back in?

Demons wage a war
They're coming for my soul
I'll fight until I win
Or, until I can't fight them anymore

Sunset river
Sunset river

I'll fight until I win
Or, until I can't fight them anymore

Sunset river
Sunset river
Sunset river
Sunset river
