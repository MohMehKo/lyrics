[Verse One:]

Here's my promise
A love to find the way
It's the answer
To the times we face
Here's my prediction
I'm gonna make a change
Pick ourselves up and
See the darkness fade

[Bridge:]

It's gonna be all right
Things are gonna get better
It's gonna be all right
Gotta keep on being strong

[Chorus:]

When you're down on my luck my baby
And you said that the world has changed
As long as we have each other
Love's gonna save the day
From the ray of light in the distant shinning
A little bit of hope in all this rain
As long as we stay together
Love's gonna save the day

Love's gonna save the day

[Verse Two:]

I'm on a mission
And you had proved my faith
Nothing's greater
Than the life we made
Got a resolution
To never be afraid
Until have you complete me
And leave my heart away

[Bridge:]

It's gonna be all right
Things are gonna get better
It's gonna be all right
Gotta keep on being strong

[Chorus:]

When you're down on my luck my baby
And you said that the world has changed
As long as we have each other
Love's gonna save the day
From the ray of light in the distant shinning
A little bit of hope in all this rain
As long as we stay together
Love's gonna save the day

[Verse Three:]

You give me the strength
To do many things
Stand by you
And you, give me the strength
To take me higher
And higher!

Love's gonna save the day
Talk about love's gonna save the day
Gonna save the day (yay!)

[Chorus:]

When you're down on my luck my baby
And you said that the world has changed
As long as we have each other
Love's gonna save the day
From the ray of light in the distant shinning
A little bit of hope in all this rain
As long as we stay together
Love's gonna save the day

[repeat chorus 2x]

Oh, my, yeah
Love's gonna save the day
(love's gonna save the day)
