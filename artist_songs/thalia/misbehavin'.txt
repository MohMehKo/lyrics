What's going on
You keep creeping out the back door 
The minute I'm gone
You've been actin' like some kind of stranger
For far too long
And my girls keep trying to tell me
That something is wrong
So stop playing dumb

[Bridge:]

You've been hanging up, 
Relieved while I'm home alone
I've heard enough
And I won't take anymore

[Chorus:]

Baby you're misbehavin'
You're telling me lies
Misbehavin' quit makin' me cry
Tell me I'm the only one in your life
You better step up before I say goodbye
You're misbehavin'
You're telling me lies
Misbehavin' quit makin' me cry
Tell me I'm the only one in your life
You better step up before I say goodbye

[Verse Two:]

I'm startin' to tell
That you really don't wanna be here
I know you too well
And it's breakin' my heart just the way you learn
So you gonna make a fool of me
You better think again
Or I'll be free
I walk away from you so easily
Just pushing you will see

[Bridge:]

You've been hanging up, 
Relieved while I'm home alone
I've heard enough
And I won't take anymore

[Chorus:]

Baby you're misbehavin'
You're telling me lies
Misbehavin' quit makin' me cry
Tell me I'm the only one in your life
You better step up before I say goodbye
You're misbehavin'
You're telling me lies
Misbehavin' quit makin' me cry
Tell me I'm the only one in your life
You better step up before I say goodbye

[Verse Three:]

You know I want to
You know I need to
But I can't carry on the way you treat me
You know I want to
You know I need to
I'm so confused
So baby come and save me
You know I want to
You know I need to
But I can't carry on the way you treat me
You know I want to
You know I need to
I'm so confused
So baby come and save me

[Bridge:]

You've been hanging up, 
Relieved while I'm home alone
I've heard enough
And I won't take anymore

[Chorus:]

Baby you're misbehavin'
You're telling me lies
Misbehavin' quit makin' me cry
Tell me I'm the only one in your life
You better step up before I say goodbye
You're misbehavin'
You're telling me lies
Misbehavin' quit makin' me cry
Tell me I'm the only one in your life
You better step up before I say goodbye
[repeat chorus 2x]

Goodbye
Quit makin' me cry
Goodbye
Quit makin' me cry
Goodbye 

Baby you're misbehavin' you're tellin' me lies
