I'll admit I'm not the best at words
I'm not the best at talking
But, I'm talking to you

I'll admit I never thought of this
I never thought that you would
Kiss me

But, no-no
No-no
No-no
It didn't change me

And I won't lie sleepless thinking of you
I'm sleepless thinking of someone
Oh, you don't know

And I won't lie there was no you and I
There was only that night
And now it's history

Cause, no-no
No-no
No-no
It didn't change me

And I forget if this was a mistake
If this was just temptation
Knocking at my door

And I forget the scars that lined your skin
Forget the color of your eyes
And the room we were in

Cause, no-no
No-no
No-no
It didn't change me

I said, no-no
No-no
No-no
It didn't change me

I said, no-no
No-no
No-no
It didn't change me

I said, no-no
No-no
No-no
It didn't change me
