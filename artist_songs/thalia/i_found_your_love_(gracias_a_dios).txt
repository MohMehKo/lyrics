Nothing really matters
And if I can't see you
A minute seems like hours
Everytime I'm with you
Nothing's really missing
And if I can't hold on
Oh,oh...life is not worth living
Only when I'm with you
Nothing really matters
And if I can't see you
A minute seems like hours
You are the chosen one, the one I dreamed of
You're the charming prince of my life
You are my fairy tale come true
I'm so grateful for my life
I'm so grateful for your love
Thankful that I'm with you, with you...
'Cause I'm very glad I met you
And at last I managed to find your love
'Cause I really do believe you
Everytime you say those words
Because now we are together
And our love will last forever
I'm very thankful, so very thankful
I found your love
I'm so grateful for my life
I'm so grateful for your love
I'm very thankful that fate has matched the two of us
I'm so grateful for my life I'm so grateful for your love
I'm very thankful that fate has matched the two of us
I'm so grateful for my life I'm so grateful for your love
I'm very thankful that fate has matched the two of us
Grateful for my life
Thankful for your love
I'm very thankful, so very thankful
I found your love
I'm very thankful, so very thankful
I found your love.
