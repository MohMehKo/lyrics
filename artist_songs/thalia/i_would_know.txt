Your shadow falls behind you
With a cigarette dangling from its mouth
That dusty road you're on winds forever
It might lead you astray

I would know
I would know

The fire you built will keep you warm
And protect you from the ghosts in the wind
But when you sleep the darkness will close in
And with it all the sins from your past

I would know
I would know

So, darling dream of the night, dream of the night
When morning comes it'll rise, the sun will rise
Let the fire burn in your eyes, burn in your eyes
You'll be alright, you'll be alright

I would know
I would know

And down the road you won't be alone
A figure dressed in boots will join you
And carry half the weight her shoulders
Together you will weather any storm

I would know
I would know

So, darling dream of the night, dream of the night
When morning comes it'll rise, the sun will rise
Let the fire burn in your eyes, burn in your eyes
You'll be alright, you'll be alright

So, darling dream of the night, dream of the night
When morning comes it'll rise, the sun will rise
Let the fire burn in your eyes, burn in your eyes
You'll be alright, you'll be alright

I would know
I would know
