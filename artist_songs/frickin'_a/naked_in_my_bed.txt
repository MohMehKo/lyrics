I met her at the pool 
yeah she was smokin' hot 
she told me maybe we should get together sometime 
she asked me if i could 
rub oil on her back 
and that was fine with me 
and then i had a crazy fantasy...we were 

Naked in my bed 
one fling no strings 
movin' all around the room 
chicka chicka boom boom...and then we did it 
on the floor 
against the door 
up on the sink where we did it some more 
the sun was hot and we were both burning red 
we were naked in my bed 

She read her magazine 
right in front of me 
the latest issue of cosmo she said i should 
check these positions out on page 69 
she pointed to this one...and said 
looks like a lot of fun..then we were

Naked in my bed 
one fling no strings 
movin' all around the room 
chicka chicka boom boom...and then we did it 
on the floor 
against the door 
up on the sink where we did it some more 
the sun was hot and we were both burning red 
we were naked in my bed 

Everyone will wonder where we've been
we can make up something oh but then 
we may never see the sun again

We were naked in my bed 
on top, don't stop
