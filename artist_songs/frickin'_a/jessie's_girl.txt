Jessie is a friend
Yeah I know he's been a good friend of mine
But lately something’s changed, that ain't hard to define 
Jessie's got himself a girl, and I wanna make her mine

And she's watchin' him with those eyes
And she's lovin' him with that body, I just know it
And he's holdin' her in his arms, late late at night

You know I wish that I had Jessie's girl
I wish that I had Jessie's girl
Where can I find a woman like that?

I'll play along with the charade
There doesn't seem to be a reason to change
You know I feel so dirty when they start talkin' cute
I wanna tell her that I love her but the point is probably moot

'Cause she's watchin' him with those eyes
And she's lovin' him with that body, I just know it
And he's holdin' her in his arms, late late at night

You know I wish that I had Jessie's girl
I wish that I had Jessie's girl
Where can I find a woman like that? 
Like Jessie's girl
I wish that I had Jessie's girl
Where can I find a woman like that
Where can I find a woman like that?

And look in the mirror all the time
Wonderin' what she don't see in me
I've been cool I'm a pimp with the lines
Ain't that the way love's supposed to be?

Tell me, why can’t I find me a woman like that?

You know I wish that I had Jessie's girl
I wish that I had Jessie's girl
I want Jessie’s girl
Where can I find me a woman like that? 
Like Jessie's girl
I wish that I had Jessie's girl
I wanna piece of Jessie’s Girl
Where can I find me a woman like that
