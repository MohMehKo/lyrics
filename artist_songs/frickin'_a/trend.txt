Woke up today 
looking through my email 
it's all triple x - explicit sex 
But I'm not horny 

Can't make it stop, the different colored soda pops 
striped toe socks, call the cops 
I can't take anymore 

I've got the perfect cel plan with nights and weekends free 
All the ringtones that I need 
But no one ever calls me 

I should paint myself green 
Walk around in a red g-string 
Cause I just don't fit in 
Turn my hat sideways 
put a band aid on my face 
You know that I.... 
Wish I could start a trend 

Checkin' out and in of the Paris Hilton 
Joe Millionaire - he's a has been
Flippin' through a hundred million channels 
But I still watch Road Rules 
Lose the pounds FLIP 
You gotta buy now FLIP 
Here's the number to save your soul FLIP 
Breaking news...another Michael Jackson scandal 

I've got the perfect cel plan with nights and weekends free 
More on-peak than I need 
But no one ever calls me 

I'll wear low rider jeans 
Put a barbell through my dingaling 
Cause I just don't fit in 
Turn my hat sideways 
put a band aid on my pretty face 
Cause I wish, I know, I could.... 
I would start a trend 

Nana nana na 
Nana nana na 
Nana nana na 

Then there's my girlfriend 
She's such a cutie 
She'd be a beauty 
If she could get an extreme makeover on that booty 
I could bend her over and she let me spank it 
Take off my jeans 
The zipper pinched my dingaling 
And I don't really fit in 
Throw my hat away 
Take that stupid band aid off my face 
And I...I wish there were 
One more way to tan your skin 
a reality show where no one wins 
If I would be myself 
Then I would start a trend 

If I'd just be myself
