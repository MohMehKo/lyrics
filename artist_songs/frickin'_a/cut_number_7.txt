I wrote a song 
That everyone loved 
With an acoustic guitar 
And a rhyming thesauras 

And I found an angle 
That no one had thought of 
The story wrapped 
in an undeniable chorus

And everyone fell in love with that song 
It must be the way that the melody 
marries the lyrics 
someone should hear this 
cut one is the song 

I booked a few gigs 
At every regional bar 
And sold thousands of copies 
From the trunk of my car 

An underground journalist 
said it was hot 
And it could really take off 
If track 2 got a shot 

He wrote I fell in love with that song 
It must be the way that the melody 
marries the lyrics 
someone should hear this 
cut two is the song

I landed a deal 
They loved my cd 
A&R was excited about 
Track number 3

But said the snare was too loud 
And guitar too distorted 
Let's get big named producer 
And just re-record it

Cause we all believe that is the song 
It must be the way that the melody 
Marries the lyric 
The public should hear it 
Cut 3 is the song 

The producer had never heard 
Demos this great 
And there was just something special 
About 5, 6 and 8

The record execs 
said the research was in 
they had made up their mind 
they're now goin' with track 10 

cause everyone fell in love with that song 
we couldn't believe they were serious 
they had to be jokin' no the public had spoken 
cut 10 is the one 

so the marketing geniuses 
developed a plan 
to spend lots of money 
and package the band 

Hit the road in a bus 
The show started to gel 
but we couldn't recoup 
with no records to sell 

but the fans fell in love with the songs 
they said where can we find the cd 
we just downloaded 3...free on kazaa 
la la la la... 

And radio said if a song had potential 
Cut 4 surely had it 
but nobody had the balls to add it 

So the record came out 
And it sat on the shelf 
There was no need to talk about songs 9 thru 12 
After the whole thing was over and done 
The public still talked about song number 1

Everyone fell in love with that song 
It must be the way that the melody marries the lyrics 
But no one would hear it 
They all fell in love with that song 
Yeah I may have written 
The greatest most passionate song no one's ever heard 
We should have just covered freebird
