Here I go, Driving by your house
Might as well throw some rocks at your window
Yeah But you don't seem to care, or maybe your not there
Probably out with someone else tryin' to keep in on the down low

Just so you know
I'm not taking this so well
Since I've been alone
I've learned how to... 

Cuss you out in Japanese
Organize my dvd's
Play solitaire again...and I
Hear that your doing fine
Smiling all the time
But you really rub it in...when you say you're over me
And you wanna be...just friends

Hey what about the promise that you made to me
That we'd always be together and you'd be there
Everyday I wake up
I found a box of notes you wrote
each one signed with x and o's
And b.s. - like I love you we're never gonna brake up 

Just so you know
I'm not taking this so well
Now that I'm alone
I've had time to...

Cuss you out in Japanese
Organize my dvd's
Smash my sister's violin...and I
Hear that your doing fine
Smiling all the time
But you really rub it in...when you say you're over me
And you wanna be...just friends

Here I go again...
I really miss you now it's time to

Beg pretty please I'm
Pouring on the cheese
My heart may never mend
And I've punched holes in all my walls
Closed down all the malls
Smashed my sisters violin...and I
Hung our picture by the bed
You're still living in my head
At least I can pretend...that you're not over me
Cause I can't be...Just Friends
