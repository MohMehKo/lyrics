My girl is unpredictable 
swears i'm the only one for her 
but never wants to be alone with me 

She says she's only havin fun 
and i hope that she 
will come running back to me...

She goes out every weekend 
yeah hangin' with all my friends 
no matter what i do i just can't win 
and i think, i think she's gonna dump me 

Stood me up on tuesday 
our 3 month anniversary 
i might not make it through the day 
well i think, think she's gonna dump me yeah...oh no 

I want her to wear my ring 
but she flirts with everyone but me 
it's like i've got a bad disease 

She says she's only havin' fun 
and it's killing me 
i hope that she's still mine...

and then she then she dumped me yeah
