Saturday morning she is
walking home from a random dorm room
her arms are crossed
she's staring at the ground

Her hair's a mess and falls in her eyes
And wearing what she wore last night
A sophomore
And independent bound

There she goes again
She don't need a boyfriend
She's gonna have her fun
And never let it go too far
But she'll party like a rock star

I saw her out dancing she was
Teasing all the freshmen
They were trying to make their moves
But getting shot down

Glitter on her eyelids in a
Low cut t-shirt and mini skirt
Catching every look
Owning every room in uptown

There she goes again
Goin' out with her best friend
Getting up on stage to play a little air guitar
And under that strawberry skin
She don't need a boyfriend
She's gonna have her fun
And never let it go too far
But she'll party hard
Party like a rock star

There she goes again
Skipping class at 8 am
Don't you fall for her
You'll be hangin on a broken heart

And under that strawberry skin
She don't need a boyfriend
She's gonna have her fun
And never let it go too far
But she'll party like a rock star
