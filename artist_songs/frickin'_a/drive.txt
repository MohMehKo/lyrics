We stood there, by your front door 
And I felt stupid when you said 
I think I need some time 
I was hoping that we could talk about it 
Why you feel like you've been missing out 
But then you went inside 

I thought I could get over you 
But as I pulled away 
I looked around my car...no way 

Because your cigarettes are in my back seat 
And I can't get very far listening to the CD mix you made me 
There's your lipstick on my floorboard 
Your footprints on the dashboard 
You're everywhere but by my side 
And I can't drive 

Now I'm passing all the places 
That we used to go like the road 
We used to make out on 
And that girl's house 
Who threw the party 
Where we finished all the alcohol 
And passed out on the lawn 

Now I'm staring at my phone 
Afraid in the unknown 
It's hard to just let go...when your 

Cigarettes are in my back seat 
And I can't get very far listening to the CD mix you made me 
There's your lipstick on my floorboard 
Your footprints on the dashboard 
You're everywhere but by my side 
And I can't drive 

And my video camera 
Holds all the memories 
I wish we could rewind 

But your cigarettes are in my back seat 
And I can't get very far listening to the CD mix you made me 
I can't drive 

Your cigarettes are in my back seat 
Your footprints on the dashboard 
You're everywhere...everywhere 
And I can't drive 

I can't drive
