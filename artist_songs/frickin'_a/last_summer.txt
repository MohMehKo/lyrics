Sneakin'out with you midnight in june
picked you up - couldn't stand to be apart
said you knew about an old abandon road
where we could park and be alone
we were trying to find ourselves
but we lost ourselves...at

17, time to waste
feelin' in and out of place
at the beach,
getting stoned on our way home

do we give it up or pull the plug
and carry this for years to come
and tell no one...about last summer
