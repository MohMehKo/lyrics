You better run just as fast as you can, I've got no reason to try.
You did it to me and I'm takin' a stand. You've got a reason to cry.

Fairy stories in a penny arcade.
You bought my love and I paid.
I'm not trying to make history.
You could have been good to me.

Fairy stories in a penny arcade.
You bought my love and I paid.
I'm not trying to make history.
You could have been good to me.

Spend my life makin' my love to you. I've got no reason to try.
Got no making up for making you do. You've got no reason to cry.

Fairy stories in a penny arcade.
You bought my love and I paid.
I'm not trying to make history.
You could have been good to me.
You better run just as fast as you can.
You better run just as fast as you can... [repeat and fade]
