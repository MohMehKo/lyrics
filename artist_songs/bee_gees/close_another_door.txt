Many years have passed, it seems,
And now I'm all alone.
I've sent the children far away
To some obscure unknown.

[Chorus:]
It's so sad,
So sad.
Close another door.
Listen to my eyes.
Close another door.
You're much too old to work,
So won't you run away?

When I was young, I used to say
That age won't bother me.
The life I had was very sad,
It all went out to sea

[Chorus]

And though the sun is in outside,
The rain is in my hair.
Now all my life is lived inside
My home is in my chair.

[Chorus]

Let me go.
Send me flowers and
Put me on a plane.
I've paid before,

But I've been told
At least I'm alive

I may be old but I've been told at least I'm still alive
Fly me up, and send me off,
I been working so, so very hard at being young but now I'm tired
I... I've been told, my arms, said let me work it out baby,
Work it, work it, work it out, let me try
