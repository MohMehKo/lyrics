Look out my window.I can see tomorrow.
Just a whole way of sorrow when the change is made.
And I've been cryin'.
Oh, Lord, I've been cryin'.
But I'll go on a-cryin' when the change is made.
Well, I've been a good man. Oh Lord, Lord, I've been a good man.
But what's good's a good man after the change is made? Yeah!
And I'm not forgettin' all the love, the love, the love I been giving.
I've got to go on a-livin' after the change is made.
And I been a-cryin'. Oh Lord, Lord, I been a-cryin'
But I got to go on a-cryin' after the change is made.
And I'm not forgettin' all the love, love I been giving.
'Cause I got to go on living
After the change is made.
[Music]
And I'm not forgettin' all the love, all the love I been giving
And I got to go on livin'
After the change is made.
And I'm not forgettin' all the love I been giving
But I got to go on living
After the change is made.
And I'm not forgettin'... [fade out]
