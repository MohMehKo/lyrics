One minute, women ,please,
I'd go down on my knees
to say to you with a word so true
"I love you"

I fail to understand
why you don't want my hand
I try to find what's on your mind
I wonder

Why don't you stop and see
Why you're not loving me:
Would it hurt to say "Hello"
or don't you know?

One minute, women, please,
I'd go down on my knees
to say to you with a word so true
"I love you"

Why don't you stop and see
why you're not loving me:
Would it hurt to say "Hello"
or don't you know?

One minute, women,please,
I'd go down on my knees
to say to you with a word so true
"I love you, I love you. I love you."
