[Verse 1]
What do you get for trying? Minute you're born you're dying.
The body is six feet down.The Lord says the soul sticks around.

[Chorus]
You can believe what you wanna but I know what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna believe in the Lord.
You can believe what you wanna but I know what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna believe in the Lord.

[Verse 2]
You think you live on laughter. But you don't know what's after.
Singing Hallelujah. I can know the Master.

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
When my life is over. Lie in fields of clover.
Waiting for my own girl. Living in a new world . Yeah..

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]

[Chorus]

[end]
I'm gonna believe in the Lord.
