Jingle jangle , my love wears silvery bangles
She likes to wander and that's why I'm under
the spell of her jingle jangle

We used to cry on each others shoulder
Now that I'm older , she wanders ahead
Now that she's found love , I still hear the sound of
silvery bangles , remain in my head

Jingle jangle , my love wears silvery bangles
She used to wander and that's why I'm under
the spell of her jingle jangle

mmm..... [fade]
