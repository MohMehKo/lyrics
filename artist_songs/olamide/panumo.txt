Haa haa nigaba ti mo broke walai no joke
Poverty fun mi lorun mo n choke
Them no dey pay me when I go show
Ti n’ba tun de’le mi garri ni ma soak
Now on the show with my boy Davido
Just begging them won dey the video
Big P patience that’s what they do
So I go trip you never gat the dough how
Now everywhere we go, the people show me love they don’t care about the gold
I’m killing every beat I’ve been killing every show
I’ve been making dreams come true achieveing my goals
Our enemies no coming closer
Oga you no know now I know sir
You said I rass like omo Mushin olosha
But now you say I don fat like Wande Coal osha

Won ni lagbaja kan o’leshe to tamedu
Won la awon ni igba kan ikoko baba ishasun, won underate mi
Ko ye ma soro were l’enu mo
Ko ye ma soro oshi ko panumo
Ko ye ma soro were l’enu mo
Ko ye ma soro oshi ko panumo

YBNL money badoo
Gat more haters now that I gat dough
I really don’t know why dey call me bragado
Cause I no dey attach with them as I dey go
Haa! I be one man MOPOL, I no dey any alliance
Local lo’san owo, packaging mi lo’san allowance
Se show Lekki, show l’Aja, show n London, se show Naija
I hold my coin and the clothes I gat
Okiri ni mi I no dey slow my guy
See bad man mi nursing me abses
Ass go there stand up assist
Bi Obinna, bi Pumpy, dem know how we does it
Badoo

Won ni lagbaja kan o’leshe to tamedu
Won la awon ni igba kan ikoko baba ishasun, won underate mi
Ko ye ma soro were l’enu mo
Ko ye ma soro oshi ko panumo
Ko ye ma soro were l’enu mo
Ko ye ma soro oshi ko panumo
Ko ye ma soro were l’enu mo
Ko ye ma soro oshi ko panumo
Ko ye ma soro were l’enu mo
Ko ye ma soro oshi ko panumo
Ko ye ma soro were l’enu mo
Ko ye ma soro oshi ko panumo
