Wake up in the morning
Think about my money
Wake up in the morning
Think about my money

Like Wale they gonna love me for my ambition
Ijebu lahun, Owo ma ka mi nishan
I don’t talk much but live by my money sure
I don’t play with my hustle, Oda bi ammunition
You no fit send me I be like straight bullet nigga
Ibile la won temi ba ka there wallet nigga
Mo le pa yan nitori One Naira
Messing with my money no good for your health like cholera

Wake up in the morning
Think about my money
Wake up in the morning
Think about my money

When I wake up in the morning
I say my prayers to the lord
Ma tun kun le waju mummy ko gbadura fun mi na
If I respect you, ko n se tori pe oju mi lo
I no dey fear anybody middle finger to the law
Hungry lion
Igo loju omo daran
Awa la ni igboro
West ati east side
Omo ita lawa
A kin se omo get inside

Wake up in the morning
Think about my money
Wake up in the morning
Think about my money
