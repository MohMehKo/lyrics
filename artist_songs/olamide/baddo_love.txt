Babe wanna spend time with you
Anywhere, I really wanna get high with you
But baby I’ll be gone till November
Thought I told you, you remember?
I’m on my way
Trying to get by…eh
Trying to get money
So we stay fly…eh
Meanwhile…eh
You shouldn’t cry…eh
When you need me and I’m not by your side..eh

Can’t call; tears keep falling
And I need you girl, you are bawling
Even when you sick of being lonely
Miss you to my one and only

Shawty, you can have the dough and have it all
My money is a profit, is a gain and a capital
Shawty you’re the only one, don’t even want more
Bye bye to you now
Baby girl I’m setting off

No be say I foolish
No be say I stupid
No be say I hate you or I no get you for mind
But hustle mi o easy
And everything get crazy
But no be say I hate you or I no get you for mind

Baby, I….will always love you
No be say I hate you or I no get you for mind…yeh
Baby, I….will always love you
No be say I hate you or I no get you for mind…yeh

Jesu
This love is a beautiful thingy
Feels like angels in heaven are singing
ahn…is that you?
Taking the lead chorus. is that you?
Right to my head, I keep hearing your voice
Babe to be honest, you are flawless
Too many times, you have seen me on TV
but you are the star, you’re the celebrity

Nobody, nobody, can take your place
You don’t know how much I miss you
So badly so badly
Can’t even hide my feelings cos its out there
Today imma grind
You dey on my mind
You cant understand
Why dem dey mad
hmm, I know this special feeling that we got
Na why dem they craze cos it’s so hard to find

No be say I foolish
No be say I stupid
No be say I hate you or I no get you for mind
But hustle mi o easy
And everything get crazy
But no be say I hate you or I no get you for mind

Baby, I….will always love you
No be say I hate you or I no get you for mind…yeh
Baby, I….will always love you
No be say I hate you or I no get you for mind…yeh

I’m on my way
Trying to get by…eh
Trying to get money
So we stay fly…eh
Meanwhile…eh
You shouldn’t cry…eh
When you need me and I’m not by your side..eh
