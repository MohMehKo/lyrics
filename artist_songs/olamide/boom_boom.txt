Me and my g’s, don’t dull na boom boom boom
We hit the road everyday like boom boom boom
We drive fast cars everyday like boom boom boom
And the girls they want it like boom boom boom
We hit it like boom boom boom

Am from the ghetto and you all ready know
[?]
Just here finna get my dough
Nbody can stop me ochapo
Don’t help me love me laye
I love myself yesh am so kanye
don’t like drunk mentality
Tony montana and davinchi
Raise it like niggha, see lewis anna
Only role with bad girls like rihanna
Am the future no Ciara
Hit the nail on the head Mc Hammer

Don’t downgrade me like naira and cefa
The last chick they told me i wouldnt get far
I make sure I make it, before i left her! RIP

Me and my g’s, don’t dull na boom boom boom

Notorious like my niggha BIG
Even if I get pop like my niggha YG
Get back on my feet like a B.O.J
Fuvk the niggha three times thriology
Am so very markaveli real life shii not very
Like jason the next is what am on to
Am olamide don’t call me John Doe
Fuvk that all shii left over,
Bad guy pabloescobar
Money long, got money the long thing
So chronic like am straight outta Compton

Don’t downgrade me like naira and cefa
The last chick they told me i wouldnt get far
I make sure I make it, before i left her! RIP

If you get the money, don’t give a damn
What they talk about you
Cause you know when you talk they never say shii
And they gonna battle

If dey ain’t get nothing to lose I don’t wanna battle
If the girl wanna get down
I can hit that we can do it in the car too

Me and my g’s, don’t dull na boom boom boom
