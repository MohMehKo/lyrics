[Intro]
Eh badoo, badoo, badoo

[Chorus]
She carry front, she carry back
She’s too packaged, I can’t leave her
She’s one of the reasons wey I get liver
Nothing in this world that I can't give her
I’m loving you, eh [2x]

She carry front, she carry back
She’s too packaged, I can’t leave her
She’s one of the reasons wey I get liver
Nothing in this world that I can't give her
I’m loving you, eh [2x]
