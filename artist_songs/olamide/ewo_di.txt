Every little thing she do dey blow my mind
Omo toh shan, you’re one of a kind
Please turn around let them see your back side, eh

Girl you are my L.O.V.E
Gat me going C.R.A.Z.Y
Everything about you is just amazing, keep it going, please keep the fire blazing
So amazing, so amazing, in a booty
Shake it, shake it, shake it
