Oh na na; ahahah
Eh yah

Baby we should get married
January tabi February
And baby we can be fine, be fine
I can't wait for you to be mine
Maybe we should get married
January tabi February
And maybe we can be fine, be fine
I can't wait for you to be mine

Eh, this kind of love am feeling
If you get warapa, mi o le fi e le
Extra miles I'll go cause am willing
That's my baby boo, e jo fi le
Have been going round and round like it's relay
I've never found nobody like you really
The fire in your eyes girl it's killing
All the loop holes baby, I would fill it
Kilode, kilo shele gan gan
I love you like Ijebu people love ifoko
Moti Jide but not Kosoko
Am tryna step up my game, I wanna be your oko

Cause time dey go time dey go, I know you love olulufe by wande coal
My voice is not spectacular and I know am local
I hope you like this ati f'auto tune so vocal

Baby we should get married
January tabi February
And baby we can be fine, be fine
I can't wait for you to be mine
Maybe we should get married
January tabi February
And maybe we can be fine, be fine
I can't wait for you to be mine

My baby turn around, turn around
Ewo kini bo se round, bo se round
Thank God that I found, that I found
Thank God that I found ya
My one in a million, you dey make me high, ponkiriyon
And the way you dey turn me on
I cannot paint the picture with a crayon
My baby go slow eh, my baby sweet like coslaw 
I love the bebe around you, the way you take it slow
Mo ko e je, mo ko e mu with no straw

Cause time dey go time dey go, I know you love olulufe by wande coal
My voice is not spectacular and I know am local
I hope you like this ati f'auto tune so vocal

Baby we should get married
January tabi February
And baby we can be fine, be fine
I can't wait for you to be mine
Maybe we should get married

And maybe we can be fine, be fine
I can't wait for you to be mine
