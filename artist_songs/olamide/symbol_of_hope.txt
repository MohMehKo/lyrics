On the beat his 2Kriss
2Kriss on the beat
YBNL is still the team
Uhnn! yeeh!

Olajuwon like Hakim
Ain't nobody like him
The street is keeping up religiously
I ain't talking about Hakim
I can now bigger than Tally poly Hakim
I'm doing real leaving my dream open the doors for my kin
To the next chapter, after
We cause disaster, we smoke up every corner in the wood like a rastas
My team is on a mission, vision is not to become stars
Let the people know there's God and give hope to youngsters
Kori ba mi shay, Ki nle lowo, kin de le l'ota
Ki moto tuntun jade, ki ma bere pe elo lon ta?
Awon ti won ta baalu, e le won bo taa
Won la won fe maa ba mi compete, maje ko gbo'n ta
All black errthing, eyin ojasi, erindin
Ball ko fun awon eruku ni street, wan ma ku everyday
Salute to awon omo oka to di street mu
Oluwa dariji awon to man fa gbo pelu hymm book

To ba fe sun kun ayo, let the tears drop
To ba fe pass message fun awon street, o le lo ear drop
To ba de fe rii future dada, o need eye drop
Symbol of hope l'emi je, let the beat drop
Symbol of hope l'emi je, let the beat drop
Symbol of hope l'emi je, let the beat drop

Asallam Alaikun, I know my success no be miracle
If you are destined to be great, omo nothing can shake you
People go hate you, friends and family go forsake you
Keep your eyes on the price, don't let the hate suffocate you
Ko de matter to ba de je alabaru ni Ketu
If you don't get your life together, omo life would get you, set you on fire
Bi t'omi gbona to wa nu kettle
Take you away from all the people way dem fit protect you
Eyin kule l'ota wa, inu ile l'asebi gbe
Teti s'oro nisyin ni mo nso, ko ma lo mase bi mpe
Iwo ni kan ni mighty igo
T'awon egbe e ba ti pe, ma ya olote
K'Olorun ma je ka r'ogun kani pe
Emi ti se iwonba titemi, se won ba titi eeh
Success story temi, ko le dabi ti tie
B'eni bodi ba lo so wi pe mo lo s'aajo nibi bayi "no"
Ise l'ogun ishe
Mano gere, wan fe gbae ni oh

To ba fe sun kun ayo, let the tears drop
To ba fe pass message fun awon street, o le lo ear drop
To ba de fe rii future dada, o need eye drop
Symbol of hope l'emi je, let the beat drop
Symbol of hope l'emi je, let the beat drop
Symbol of hope l'emi je, let the beat drop

It's been a long time coming
E lo bi awon to maa gbo mi
Every morning ni mo ma korin wow you're still yawning
Mo finesse, everyday they say they did it for money
Ki ni show business, if you're not making the profit
Reliable money making machine ni mo je ooh
Eni to ba bami d'owo poo, o di dandan ko jeun
Around here we don't joke, Olorun, ole lo ba omo je ooh
E sun s'eyin, bo ran yin ni ishe eru ke fi t'omo je ooh
6 years back to back ni mo meru le

Rappers dey try, I know but nobody wey near
Your excellency, won ti mo se yen lati genesis
Won de ni fun ni mercy, because already, won mo nemesis
Do what you like don't let them put you in a box
Stand on your ground, be yourself and fight for your cause
Live your life, press play and know when to pause
Na the street we they rep, na the street be source

To ba fe sun kun ayo, let the tears drop
To ba fe pass message fun awon street, o le lo ear drop
To ba de fe rii future dada, o need eye drop
Symbol of hope l'emi je let the beat drop
