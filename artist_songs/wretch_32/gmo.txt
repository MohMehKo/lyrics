[Verse 1 - Wretch 32:]
New flow, ayy, yeah
Baby Skye, come and give your dad a dance
Cuh you love me for my future, not my shattered past
And you trust me with your future, I'm a man at last
So if I ever break a promise or it seems that I'm dishonest
You can clap me in the forest in your camouflage, I'm playing
Daddy's always playing like every day it's raining
My son Skye on a cloudy day keep reigning
Didn't nobody say this shit would be smooth sailing
Lately I've been in a mood
It's like every day I hit the juice
Then listen to another million tunes
And hear about the feds are still killing youts
It's funny how the bigger picture always gets the little views
Imagine if a senior really tried to kill the kid in you
Tried to put the lid on you
Tried to stop the water that was flowing through your physical
Man, I hope these critics eat their words till they're critical
My first plan was just to make my first grand
Now the rasta man wan' see my first grand-
Child, I can hold it, I can teach it words and
And every weekend I'll take the fam to Kervans cause
I'm 32, only thing I'm missing is a wife
I'm a workaholic, all I'm missing is the time
I just want the qualities my mum brought to my life
I want that old-fashioned woman with that new-fashioned type
That's nice

[Verse 2 - Avelino:]
Yeah, let's go
Keep it real, all those who keep it real
Yeah, I don't give a fuck, at least it's real
Free Adidas without an Adidas deal
All down to my aura, I just wanna know how Rita feel
Can't lie, I never saw what we're becoming coming
Just the other day, the exit looked so welcoming
They want it for free until you wanna sell something
That's why I look up to 3, cause he went on to sell something
Mandem gotta be great, good enough is good for nothing
Had bare girls, never fell in love, I stood for something
This is their world, I know it never was, I wish it wasn't
Ironic how we needed machines to push the button
Now we've got technology
I'mma get a rap verse in an anthology
I'mma be the one they wanna be, I won't call them wannabes
If I wasn't me, I'm the one I'd wanna be
Cause they got dead lines, I'll come through in time
Meanwhile, I'm rapping 'bout emotions I ain't been through in time
In my yard where family members ain't come through in time
So I just locked myself away like I was doing time, yeah
I know you felt 'em, I've got bars all day
I wish I was around in F64 days
What I'd do in a day'd take you 64 days
Had mega drive back in N64 days

[Verse 3 - Youngs Teflon:]
Open conversation with brothers who used to bang out
And we agree on always to get the gang out
Normal travel at my shoes, can bring the fam out
These rappers claim their circles tight, I'd rather stand out
I was born for this ting, my six words, I'm Wretch
Would've made my own Av, I'm no longer on the bench
Attitude poor, I dress nice to cover up the stench
I'm just a vision of these places that I went
Getting pounds for my pence, was taught to stand tall
I never sat on no fence, and when the sign said "no ball games"
I hid eighths in the door frames
Cause I was fed up of the poor games
And Mummy smiled when she seen me on the TV now
But I'm just an IC3, wow
Got stopped the other day on the mains by some feds dressed plain
And somebody drove past playing my CD loud
You wanna see 'em right now, I'm kind of feeling
Wanted to hold me down but I don't want no ceilings
They're tryna find a meaning, I'm just tryna find a reason
Nowadays I love my own company, it's just the season
I said "I really want some kids"
She said "you're still acting like a kid"
But I just wanna feel alive
Cause now these kids are killing kids
