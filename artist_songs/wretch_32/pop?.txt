[Intro - Kano:]
You ain't never weighed the ounce, fought a bouncer
You ain't never hid no blocks in your mouth

[Verse 1 - Wretch 32:]
They say I'm lucky, I must be fucking lucky
Already paid my dues and they're running out of money
Got a different point of view, you should see em man, they're lovely
In my prime, should be running for the country
Instead I keep it gully
Hoods on in the restaurant, elbows on the table
Got my Stan Smiths on and my trousers down low
I still make it rain balls
So childish, so childish, and my CSA went on diamonds
We fought our way up here, don't wonder why we're unbalanced
So violent, so violent, you talk shit, we riot
I bought it, supplied it, it don't take no sidekick (amen)
And no sidekick, I came in on my own
When I'm ghost you can pop, pop, pop and have a toast

[Pre-Hook:]
Let the liquour pour out, let the ladies all drown
We be go insulting, how we gonna walk out?
Fucking up my liver, treat my body like a whore house
Used to be a Christian, now I'm in Dior wow

[Hook - Wretch 32 & Kano:]
Pop, pop, pop, pop
Pop, pop, pop pop pop then we're out

I ain't a pop star, I ain't a pop star
It just happens my face is ever so popular
I ain't a pop star, I'll make it pop darg
Even when I'm in 3s and 2s, pop pop pop then we're out

[Verse 2 - Wretch 32:]
Let's get it popping, let's really get it popping
Got a lot of money, I can afford all my problems
She said I'm a hot male, she wants to log in
That's the type of email that I've been getting too often
I'm a wrong'un, a problem, try and solve me, I'll drop em
Just flying, and swat em, two plus two, leave them forgotten
But that's simple maths when you're smart like me
Worth more dead when you're alive like me
Got a big will, I've got Black Eyed Peas
Have a drink on me

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook]

Even when I'm in 3s and 2s, slip
There ain't no reason to, slipping

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook]

[Outro - Kano:]
Three, two, pop, pop
Three, two, pop, pop
Pop pop pop then we're out
