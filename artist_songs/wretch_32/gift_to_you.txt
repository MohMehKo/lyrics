[Moelogo:]
There's no time like the present
There's no time like the present
There's no time like the present
Spend time in my presence
There's no time like the present
There's no time like the present
There's no time like the present
Spend time

[Hook - Moelogo:]
There's no time like the present
There's no time like the present (and that's my gift to you)
There's no time like the present
Spend time in my presence (and that's my gift to you)
There's no time like the present
There's no time like the present (and that's my gift to you)
There's no time like the present
Spend time in my presence

[Verse 1 - Wretch:]
They told me God is great, I know that God is great
They're really tryna fly me to Kuwait
I'm just a kid from the estate, who never had a fire for my place
But now I've got a place for my fire and some diamonds for the safe
And a 9 to keep 'em safe, but you don't wanna see a shooting star shoot 'em up
Bang bang when we shoot 'em up, bang bang bang bang when we shoot 'em up, yeah
I see a couple girls that I shouldn't do
I show them another world, man, wouldn't you?
Miss Uptown, let me put the hood in you
I put you on your toes, then I put your foot in shoes
Yeah, Kurt Geigers
I've been knighted, they call me Sir-viver
See, I love it when they feel say my time's up
My only call-in is a Rolex dial, blud
I'm looking for my other half, I only seem to find a quarter
Who hasn't played The Miseducation... to her daughter
It can all be so simple but she likes it when I'm hard
Love cuts deep and she's looking like she's scarred
Why you trust those niggas?
Why you fuck those niggas?
Matter of fact, fuck those niggas
Tryna make you Cinderella, you should chuck those slippers
Cut by the special cloth and the cut's so different
Wipe the slate clean

[Hook - Moelogo:]
There's no time like the present
There's no time like the present (and that's my gift to you)
There's no time like the present
Spend time in my presence (and that's my gift to you)
There's no time like the present
There's no time like the present (and that's my gift to you)
There's no time like the present
Spend time in my presence

[Verse 2 - Avelino:]
There's no time like my presence
Is your presence worth my time? What'd you reckon?
First things first, I don't ever come second
Young rapper but young rappers refer to me as their reference
Live a little cause I'm used to living little
A bit of drive, come, we skid a little
Scrabble with the words, didn't even scribble
Couple girls that swing both ways and I'm in the middle
Thank you lord, I'm from the manor so it's thank you, lord
DJ, wheel it like a brand new Porsche
Shawty said she got me, she gets me if she gets me Henny
Might just grab the mic and shout out all my niggas, Lenny Henry
Yo, they can't touch me cause I feel alone
I think I'm too streetwise for the roads
So it's Old Flame, Young Fire
Just tryna run the game, umpire, A... V

[Hook - Moelogo:]
There's no time like the present
There's no time like the present (and that's my gift to you)
There's no time like the present
Spend time in my presence (and that's my gift to you)
There's no time like the present
There's no time like the present (and that's my gift to you)
There's no time like the present
Spend time in my presence
