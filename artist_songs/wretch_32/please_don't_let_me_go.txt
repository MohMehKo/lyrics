[Verse 1:]
Listen hey look I didn't want to separate
But with bad gravity how we going to elevate?
Sometimes you get closer from a step away
And I would never say
(Please don't let me go)
But I just wanted her to hold me
It's funny I was trying to better her with the old me
If you don't wake up to love why go to sleep, in the cold sheets?
(Please don't let me go)
So none of us will fall down
And we can wear camouflage in the war house
I am not trying to run your life or walk out
So let your thoughts out
(Please don't let me go)
We can go our different ways
But that don't mean I want to see my son on different days
I say that with a passion like the lyrics on my page
And we will not live again so

[Hook:]
Please don't let me go I just want you to hold me
I don't want to be lonely I'm flying close to the ground
Please don't let me go I'm flying close to the ground, please don't let me go

[Verse 2:]
Now this is probably the first sign of madness
But as a boy I was going through mad stress
I took man of the house when my dad left
But I never had rent
(Please don't let me go)
At sixteen on a bad flex mum told me he was rolling for my bags then?
Look I was just going through a phase, never have since, I was just acting
(Please don't let me go)
Because I was close to a dead end
Because your stood on your own with your friends then
I said I was cool I was spending I was just pretending
(Please don't let me go)
But I thank God for all of that
Because you taught me how to walk without crawling back
And now I am running forward, no falling back, this is what you call a rap

[Hook]

[Outro:]
You bring out the best of me in every special way hey oh
It's the sound of my heart saying don't let go
Don't let go please don't let me go
I just want you to hold me I don't want to be lonely
I'm flying close to the ground
Please don't let me go my girl want you need you flying flying close to the ground

[Hook]
