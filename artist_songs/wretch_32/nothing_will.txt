Let it burn till we kill the whole game, yeah

[Verse 1 - Wretch:]
Mum said I had a mouth of gold
Now look at me with this mouth of gold
Over-the-counter flow
It might cost Â£100,000 though
Dressed in Diesel, I can Dhalsim though
Speaking for the people, we're unaccountable
Yeah, still we're counting though
Tryna get to Bishop's Avenue from a thousand road
Taught by the best, never walk fireless
More fire, get you chalked by your flesh
If you walk by my steps, uh, you see we talk wireless
Cuh the feds might stalk my address
I'mma pull up to my environment
There's only a problem if you're buying it
Think out the box before you lie in it
Or you'll probably get life before you die in it, init

Said if love won't bring you home
Nothing will, nothing will, yeah

[Verse 2 - Avelino:]
Mummy said I had a mouth of fire
Now look at me, Young Fire
Next up according to the ones prior
Rest in peace Robin Williams, you can't doubt fire
No, it's my time or the end times
Independent way before I read The Times
Two wrongs never made a right
But we was sold as slaves, don't tell me nuttin' bout selling white
Yeah, street niggas live and see killings
Gotta make a killing just to keep living
Money and women, I'mma see figures
Went from pina coladas to sex on the beach with 'em
Yeah, that's 0 to 100
I'm just tryna add some zero to 100
Cause I was in the villa with some villains
Now I'm tryna show these niggas that there's heroes in the dungeons

Started on an 8th, we whole ki flipping
Nothing was the same, my whole team different
Watch, chain, my whole team different
Phone's still ringing, though you know I'm slinging
