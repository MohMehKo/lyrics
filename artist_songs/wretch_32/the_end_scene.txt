Suicide, that ain't the way to go
But he was indecisive about a way to go
He had everything from cribs to the latest clothes
Plus he drove every whip that was made for road
He was a juggler, plus and old school smuggler
He used to send the youts to get the food from Columbia
Back and forth two north were his lavish thoughts
And that of course means Gs off your average call
Putting on weight while he's sat indoors
Watching Scarface like he ain't seen it
Rewinding the last scene and while
The last scene's rewinding he's daydreaming, woo
Thinking that that may be him
Cause he ain't never watched his life and then ain't seen his
And normally he hates these flicks
But there's something in this that he relates to, I think
It must be the role or the clothes or the powder
In some scenes, the coded erode the power
His reputation speaks for itself
He ain't speaking to you unless you speak for yourself
He fell out with his mum a few years back
Just cuh she knows his little secret
She'll still die lonely if she keeps it
Look, but she ain't got nothing that she'll miss
But everyone makes mistakes
But she can't stand him or his selfish ways
And now she's days from drinking herself away
Cuh it hurts that she lost her son
And in his words, "I ain't got a mum"
But it is worse, cuh they've lost their love
And it is stern, it is not a front

Let's go back to the start
Let's go back to the start
Let's go back to the start
Let's go back to the start

He's on his own with his cold heart
Cuh it gets kinda cold in the winter
Him and his wife, they ain't spoke since they split up
Separated then got divorced
She found out about his bit on the side
And he couldn't apologise cuh that'd be killing his pride
To tell the truth, he was living a lie
Cuh he said that he loved her but he didn't trust her
But he promised that he'd give it a try
Cuh she was there when he was penniless
He still thought she cheated but he never had the evidence
Some nights wishing for intelligence
Other times thinking 'bout the negligence
But when the time was nice
They lived a crisp style, sipping on the finest wine
They never slipped while chilling with their diamond ice
Watches cuh their time was priceless
But watch this, when the time was violent
He was into boxing, he was a silent fighter
But that was before he proposed
But he pledged that he'd change
But only if they got married
And he had a family of his own
I ain't saying that I found the answer
But the rich brother didn't die a father

Let's go back to the start

He's fascinated with wanting what he couldn't have
Some would say he was stuck in his stubborn shell
Cuh he was in love with his brother's girl
And his brother's like the quietest guy
I mean, Monday to Friday, 9 to 5
And if he works overtime it's to surprise his wife
Cuh he ain't never had the girl of his dreams around
And he was married to the girl that he dreams about
So he'd do anything to keep her
He'd rather be dead than have to leave her, he needs her
He looks up to his big bro
But he don't respect how he got rich though
You would think that he was envious or something
But I swear down, he never took a penny off his brother
He'd rather work for it all
He's a genuine guy, he's got his word and his balls
But his girl was his fool
Cuh he was back early with a little surprise
Two tickets, they were s'posed to visit Dubai
He ran straight in the room about to rip off his tie
And what he saw with his eyes made him wish he was blind
It was his lover and his brother
Laying down, they were making love to one another
Whoa, he dropped the tickets on the floor
Right by the knickers on the floor
He turned around, went downstairs
He was kicking for the door
He's tryna vanish, so he's looking for his car keys
He's panicking, he can't breathe
Finally he got in his car
And he drove to his mum's, then he got in his yard
He looked in his mum's face and his mum cried
Cause she knew about her son's wife's one lie
First she said she didn't have to tell him
Then she said she didn't know how to tell him
Then they're both bursting into tears, he was tryna figure out
Where he went wrong, he was searching through the years
Till they couldn't look each other in the eye
Cuh from there on, he couldn't see his mother in his life
Or his brother in his life
Or his lover in his life
Look, so he headed to his brother's
Drowning, he was gonna leave in the flames
Tears in his eyes as he speeds through the lanes
They say love hurts, he was really feeling the pain
He goes in with his spare key
Thinking what matters to his brother
Looking in the mirror like he's standing in the gutter
Then his brother pulls up outside
As he looks out the window, "come outside"
But he just wants to make him pay
So he pulls out the gun and begins to pray
I can't believe what he did that day
Suicide, that ain't the way to go
But he was indecisive about a way to go
Suicide, that ain't the way to go
But he was indecisive about a way to go

Didn't realise the story ended back where it starts
Let's go back to the start
Didn't realise the story ended back where it starts
Let's go back to the start
Didn't realise the story ended back where it starts
Let's go back to the start
Didn't realise the story ended back where it starts

Our father, who art in heaven
Hallowed be thy name
Thy kingdom come
Thy will be done
On Earth as it is in heaven
Forgive us our trespasses
And we forgive those
Who trespass against us
Lead us not into temptation
But deliver us from evil
For yours is the kingdom
The power and the glory
Forever and ever
Amen
