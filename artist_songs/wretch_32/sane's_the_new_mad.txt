[Verse 1 - Wretch 32:]
Flying around the globe, I'm a do it so big
It ain't that hard to tell that my spirit wrote this
Flyer than anything that I've paid for
Burning though paper
Funny what I do with no spliff
But there's nothing I can do with no drink
That's why that Disaronno got me feeling so crisp
See, I'm already sorted
You can tweet 'bout me like you done with poor Giggs
And now I'm drinking away my fears, I guess everything became so clear
I'm saying it's a new beginning and I'm hooked on loose women
So you just name the place I'm there

[Hook - Wretch 32 & Charlie Bernardo:]
If you ain't playing it safe no more
Let me hear you say sane's the sane's the new mad
Let me hear you say sane's the sane's the new mad
Let me see your hands up if you never been arrested
Got my hands down 'cause they got me on the next ting
Cah I have stolen so many hearts
And I just want to hold them and tear 'em apart

[Verse 2 - Wretch 32:]
Woke up this morning with a chick I don't know
Saying she ain't a fan but she's saying don't go
I use the X Factor line again, let's play Simon says
Now all you got to do is go home
And now I'm riding solo
You only end up in a frame when you take a photo
I say my stunners got me feeling stone cold
Now I feel to hop the bar like I got a pole-vault
And now I'm drinking away my fears
I guess everything became so clear
I'm saying it's a new beginning and I'm hooked on loose women
So you just name the place I'm there

[Hook]

[Bridge - Wretch 32:]
Che, ah the thought of paying tax
Made me throw up, throw up
Now I'm trying to stay relaxed like
A grown up, grown up
I need a stress release
This ain't bringing out nothing but the best in me
So I'm a turn it up, yeah
I don't give a motherfuck if it's hurting your ears
Cause it's a stress release
This ain't bringing out nothing but the best in me

[Hook]
