[Hook - EMO & Bobii Lewis:]
Pray that luck is on my side
Cause if all we have is life
How many friends should I lose
Before I find my worth now?
Pray that luck is on my side
Summer, don't take more lives

[Verse 1 - Wretch:]
They bury us in struggle, so they're selling out of shovels
All I see is Hennessy puddles
These RIP tees, they could last me a lifetime
Got me thinking 'bout my lifeline
So I'm thinking summer, don't kill me this year
Summer, don't kill me this year, I waited round for you
I buried three people, I've been breaking down soil
I've seen a bunch of flowers laid around for you
Little brother Lukey even got pronounced for you
Held his brudda in my arms, I could feel his blood boil
Had to comfort him, thinking summer done come for him
I was saying "our father", he's got his mum with him
Hard to be the rock when our whole ends crumbling
Don't know what's worse, all this death or the struggling
English roulette but we still put our trust in it
I just pray that we trust in him

[Hook - EMO:]
Pray that luck is on my side
Cause if all we have is life
How many friends should I lose
Before I find my worth now?
Pray that luck is on my side
Summer, don't take more lives
No, summer, no
Summer, don't take more lives
No, summer, no
Oh, summer, no
Summer, don't take more lives
No, summer, no

[Verse 2 - Avelino:]
Imagine tryna find what you've lost
In the lost and found, you're no longer around and I'm gone
Pour half the Dissy, we were pouring half the Dissy
You can still have a round or you're gone
Praying till my knees hurt, teamwork was meant to make the dream work
I saw Tottenham in pieces, 'rest in peace' T-shirts
How'd you end up going before me when you put me first?
Never saw this coming, if I did, it must've been blurred

[Verse 3 - Wretch:]
Yeah, I shed a tear for my granny
Making speeches to my family like I'm picking up a Grammy
Granny used to bet on them horses like a savage
When she went, we sent her with the horses in a carriage
Now I'm 30, my pen got me spending like I'm lavish
As a kid, my Granny sent for me to go to Pendarren
Oh Granny, I miss you, I need you
Every time I feel your spirit, I pree you

[Verse 4 - Avelino:]
Oh Kyrie, I miss you, I need you
Even though your people don't wanna be my people
Mo gave me my vision, I see you
They're calling me the one, my brother, you're my equal

[Verse 5 - Wretch:]
My unborn, I wanted to meet you
I guess sometimes, timing is so evil
Yeah
Yeah

[Hook - EMO & Bobii Lewis:]
Pray that luck is on my side
Cause if all we have is life
How many friends should I lose
Before I find my worth now?
Pray that luck is on my side
So summer, don't take more lives from me
No, summer, no
Summer, don't take more lives
No, summer, no
Summer, don't take no lives from me
No, summer, no
Summer, don't take more lives
No, summer, no
