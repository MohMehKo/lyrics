[Hook: Delilah]
As the darkness turns to day, only you stand in the way,
No stops when you're on a run, understand who you've become.
You're the fire in the rain, only greatness will remain,
Push up, yes I raise the bar, don't be afraid of who you are,
You are, you are, who you are,
You are, you are, don't be afraid of who you are

[Verse 1: Wretch32]
Growing up I liked G-banks,
But everyone was saying he was too cocky,
I noticed when you're the new champ,
There ain't nothing you can do properly,
That's why I'd rather run my race,
Before I think about how they judge my face,
I came to be the best so my training was immense,
24 hours and I won't even break a sweat,
I won't even take a rest cause to sleep when your dead's enough,
Main side of mileage on my price is still wearing off,
Had to put smiling to the side and get serious,
Wanna join me you're free to, that's the Wretch in ya,
I bet it feels like I'm directing ya,
Mr Tom-Tom going in and out your area,
It's a long run, you feel hate till you're scared of love,
I'm just trying to paint the picture, is it clear enough?

Push up, yes I raise the bar, don't be afraid of who you are,

[Wretch 32:]
Tell me if you're with me,
I said I'm traveling at wind speed, ye-e-eah,
Tell me if you're with me, yea
Because I'm traveling at wind speed, ye-eah.

[Verse 2: Wretch 32]
Wake up on a high, and then I cross my heart and hope to fly,
With one question on my mind,
If you gotta stay grounded how the hell do ya touch the sky?
Assuming we're born to die,
But it's what you do between that deters if you're alive,
You only kill your dream when you open up your eyes,
And impossible's just a word that we recite,
It's a word that we've relied on for way too many years,
When they've put a man on the moon, planes in the air,
Probably said Houdini was a fraud before he disappeared,
Zuckerburg never had a penny to a millionaire,
Are you listening with your vision ears, ride to the willful,
Off in different years, I've engaged in a busy year,
I died trying to make my paradise, but I'm living it.
