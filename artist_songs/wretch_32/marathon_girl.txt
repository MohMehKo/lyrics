[Hook - Yungen:]
I don't know if it's the money or the chain, but that money's on the train
That money will have your honey on the train
I've got my head in the clouds, man, I'm faded
Singing nothing was the same
Cause I'm icy and she like it
That watch pricey and she like it
She say I'm feisty and she like it
And she can do what she wants, she just gotta run me by it

[Verse 1 - Avelino:]
I feel good
Money in my jeans, I just hustled real good
Broke up with a bad one, I hope we're still good
I'm a cheater but a tiger, man, I give 'em real wood
The pinky cost a few pinkies
Don't wanna burst your bubble but I'll pull up with a Piggy lookalike
Sugar, I'm Suge at night, never look into a woman's eyes
I just womanise

[Hook - Yungen:]
I don't know if it's the money or the chain, but that money's on the train
That money will have your honey on the train
I've got my head in the clouds, man, I'm faded
Singing nothing was the same
Cause I'm icy and she like it
That watch pricey and she like it
She say I'm feisty and she like it
And she can do what she wants, she just gotta run me by it

[Verse 2 - Wretch:]
Whipping like the Django with my chain hand
Show my time and my money, baby, on the same hand
Staring at my bread, thinking I'm the bacon
Told her [?]
Didn't wanna do it cause she had a fake tan
Had to show my tiny temper, I was in my Ray Bans
Looking for a judge's house I can gatecrash
Rita Ora didn't holla, maybe Jessie J can

That watch pricey and she like it

[Verse 3 - Fuse ODG:]
No way
They say she has a history
She a good gyal in the jungle way
Word to my chain, she be swinging both ways
But she don't really know I'm on that
I tell her go slow, she's telling me long that
My baby go low, I'm hitting it from back
And I could never lose, I'm winning this combat
She [?] eye like my contact
She say I'm Mr Right, nobody can wrong that
She go the extra mile [?] congrats
My marathon gyal, my baby ran that, ayy
My marathon gyal, my baby ran that, ayy
My marathon gyal, my baby ran that, ayy
