[Wretch 32:]
Rolling through London, I been cruising a while
I see a man in a fued with his girl
About losing his child, she was crying him river I guess she in denile
And the car ain't tinted, and this ain't none of our business
So we ain't trying to stare too long, me and the driver looked like neither of us listening
And not one of us listening, we probably both had a row with our sisterin, while the whole street witnessed
Just gotta turn a blind eye and no winking
We still rolling, we shoulda took the other way
I'm still moaning
I shoulda kept that myself, still told him
So now he's going all the way, real sulkish
Clubs are closed, I'm gettin mad
Like would you take a look at these lads, trying to stop a cab like they can't see man
Alcohol is got em feeling like they can't be stabbed
And one of them's vomiting kebab and the other is hoppin on his back
And his girl tryin to pick him up, that's the one time that she gotta be the man

[Chorus - Daley:]
Taking the long way home again
Watching the world drive in the rain
There's motion but there's no change
It's the same old, same old race till it's over yeah

[Wretch 32 (Daley):]
Rolling through London, where we slipped on a junction
I don't wanna see anymore drunkerds
And I'm talking to myself cause I wanna conversation with a little more substance
And it's alright, it's in the brain
And what a surprise it's gonna rain
And we speed past the homeless and still act like we not got enough change
I guess summats gotta change, traffic light he stuntin in a range
Imagine I'm sat lusting at the paint, while the prostitute screamed that she never got paid
Cause she thinks that she never got raped
Still got the mind of a child
That only happens when you never get raised
Trapped in a cycle that you can never escape (woahh)
And this shit used to burn me (burn me yeah)
And that's why it's part of my verse B
Sitting in a back of a cab, guess this is part of my journey (part of life)
Cause this shit used to burn me (oh yeah)
Ant that's why it's part of my verse B (ba ba ba la la)
Sitting in the back if a cab, guess this is part of my journey (oh oh oh woah)

[Chorus - Daley:]
Taking the long way home again
Watching the world drive in the rain
There's motion but there's no change
It's the same old, same old race till it's over yeah

[Wretch 32:]
And these things used to burn me, but now they just part of my journey
And these things used to burn me, but now they just part of my journey
And these things used to burn me, but now they just part of my journey
And these things used to burn me, but now they just part of my journey (oh oh oh woah)

[Chorus - Daley:]
Taking the long way home again
Watching the world drive in the rain
There's motion but there's no change
It's the same old, same old race till it's over yeah

Taking the long way home again
Because there's no way home from here
So much for cycle, I'll start making my own way back when it's over, over, over
I'm making my own way
