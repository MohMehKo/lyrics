I've been growing over life since I only had a bike
From when I had to grind daily but weren't posted on the site
I'm married to the game but still a lonely man inside
Still I spit my insides out and set petroleum alight
But I will never jeopardise my flow
Neither will I sacrifice my soul, but
Change ain't a problem and if Jermaine's still in Tottenham
Then I definitely ain't da foe
I'm just a household name with a complex brain
And a compound range, tryna let the bits know that we can renovate from
Basements in estates to
Agents with a state
If you will never let a nigga put you in your place, then
Why don't you be the one to put you in your place?
And the amount you sold, you shouldn't be in a cage, you should've been in a Range
The tortoise and the hare should never be in a race
But the rabbits get bedazzled by carrots up in a chain
Growing Over Life, number five, that ain't its place
But next time I'll drop, I'll rectify my mistakes, bless up
