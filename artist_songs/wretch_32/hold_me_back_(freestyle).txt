There's one person that throws me off
My whole day, I'm like phone off
And I'm ok, I'm so gone
I'm in the sky, I know god
Play Wretchercise, get so strong
Lyrically, on Hawking's page
Physically in Usain's race
32 is my stage wage
But I don't talk bout money like that
Cause I got money like that
She dissed me when I left her
But she loves me when I'm back
But I don't give her love like that
You're gonna need strength tryna hold me back

[Hook:]
Back back
Fuck if none of y'all don't
Back back
Fuck if none of y'all don't rap
I could pull a bitch just turning my rap
I could pull a bitch just rap

Back back
Y'all don't, y'all don't
Back back
Y'all don't, y'all don't rap
I could pull a bitch just turning my rap
Who knew that
Who knew back

How you gonna hold me back?
You ain't got enough hands
I'm mobo without a MOBO
You want a BT. I'll bet cash
When I want a BT I'm just cash
I was on a hill, tryna get thrice
Cause I'm Rayman with that maths
So I make it rain man when I splash
And I don't wanna remix none of your tracks
You need to remix mine
Listening to your original
You need to remix that
And I'm flying so far forward
That my seat goes all the way back

[Hook x2]

God is all I need
Save your Illuminati tweets
No stars are out of reach
Don't trap air it helps them to breath
Fuck it even I don't rap
I press play on a spaz
I make bread go HAM
I see red go gam, god damn
Someone must've saved this kid
He said fuck the devil
Got an angel bitch
Got his mates of metal
For atheists, an instrumental
Gets blazed to bits, you froze
I've been laden up on my snow
You know why I'm cold
My cons don't exceed my pros
I just turned black and white to gold
And now I got zeros
And I couldn't be stuck with a oh

[Hook]

Yeah, Wretchroboy
I've been Mr Wretch quite a lot recently
This CD's just me venting man
I'm having fun
No freestyles on here though
I'm a gentleman, everything's on the house, ahh yeah
Wretchercise
