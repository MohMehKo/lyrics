[Verse 1 - Jada:]
Go a hundred miles per hour
On our sex to get you on it
Mind too busy, been pulling my weight
When it steers my way
Like this weed won't smoke itself
Got my finger on the trigger, saying
I'm gon' be alright
Ride the waves to the middle of the night
Ride the waves to the middle of the night

[Verse 2 - Bobii Lewis:]
Ride the waves to the middle of the night
Ride the waves to the middle of the night, yeah, yeah
If you was in the same boat
You couldn't test the waters
Drowning in my raincoat
Sinking to the corner
If you was on the same page
Would you believe the offer
Or read it in the same way?
If you don't read, you're illiterate
I'm just tryna smoke the game, no cigarette
With some weed, that's a splifferette
I don't follow rules, fuck it, we don't need a ref
I won't sink or swim

[Verse 3 - Wretch:]
They told me sink or swim, I told 'em neither
They told me paint a pic, I'm Mona Lisa
They told me save the kids, I rolled the weed up
They probably saw a ki before they saw Alicia
So who am I to fuck their dream up?
There's no I in team, so who am I to fuck your team up?
I had a couple bags before I ever had a teacup
I was talking to the kids but they don't listen to 3

[Verse 4 - Avelino:]
I just had a conversation 'bout a conversation that I had with myself
Losing battles that I had with myself
Man, I couldn't even breathe, I used to strangle myself
Weird how I had bars but couldn't handle myself
Rolling with two Gs without my hand on my belt
Even my girl's name was ringing, that was Patti LaBelle
They didn't wanna book me, I was sat on the shelf
That was the story of my life, man, that chapter was hell

[Hook - Bobii Lewis & Avelino:]
All I hear is echoes
Yeah, all I hear is echoes (man, that chapter was hell)
All I hear is echoes, echoes, echoes, echoes
Echoes, it's all I hear (I think that chapter would sell)

[Verse 5 - Wretch & Avelino:]
First time I touched a milli, had my hands on a Dell
Bet them niggas in the city couldn't fathom the smell
Niggas can't man their yard so they captain the jail
Rolling with dice, that was random as well
"Money Over Everyting", that's an anthem as well
Man, I earnt my stripes so that's why 3 stands in Gazelles
I remember when zig zags was the pattern as well
Now I wear my heart on my sleeve cause it's fashion as well, yeah

[Hook - Bobii Lewis & Avelino:]
All I hear is echoes
Yeah, all I hear is echoes (man, that chapter was hell)
All I hear is echoes, echoes, echoes, echoes
Echoes, it's all I hear
