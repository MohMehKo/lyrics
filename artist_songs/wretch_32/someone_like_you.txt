Nevermind, I'll find someone like you,
I wish nothing but the best for you

Flickin' through the pictures
I can see you chilling with my sisters
And I can see me in the background,
Talking on the phone, probably to another mistress
I guess I prove everybody right
But this ain't everybody's life
I bet nobody's hurtin' like I
Cause the heartache meant to break,
And we wasn't meant to divide
So I'm never supposed to be lying
We're fighting for this love
And we're never suppose to be dying
The topic of discussion
I'm never home and you're crying
You're crying me a river
I'm bit and so I just dive in
Lyrical arguments
Feels like we're in the house of parliament
But I ain't trying to play the prime minister
Turn the whole country against me, I can't pretend
That I don't need nobody
(You don't need nobody)
But I don't need no worries
(You don't need no worries)
So I left when you told me you're pregnant
(Told you I was pregnant)
Heartless, not even your screams could stop me
Free

Nevermind, I'll find someone like you,
I wish nothing but the best for you two,
Don't forget me, I beg,
I remember you said,
Sometimes it lasts in love,
But sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love,
But sometimes it hurts instead

Oh yeah, I
Phone you last week
You answered your phone and didn't speak
And I could hear your boyfriend in the background saying
Who's that? I wish he would've ask me
I see your true colors shining through
You've moved on, I guess I'm nothin' like you
Or am I stupid to assume that there's a cupid
And I'm hoping if he shoots, he finds me someone like you

I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited,
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it,
I'd hoped you'd see my face,
And that you'd be reminded that for me it isn't over,

Nevermind, I'll find someone like you,
I wish nothing but the best for you, too,
Don't forget me, I beg,
I remember you said,
Sometimes it lasts in love,
But sometimes it hurts instead,
Sometimes it lasts in love,
But sometimes it hurts instead.
