Said you might as well keep the chance by me
Since I'm walking with all eyes on me (seh wah?)
I said you might as well keep the chance by me
Since I'm walking with all eyes on me

Born as a hero
But know I've got love for my people
You know I shed blood for my people
Cuh round here good over evil
Born as a hero
But know I've got love for my people
You know I shed blood for my people
Cuh round here good over evil
Nah nah, nah nah, love in my ways
You know I love when they hate
Cuh they can get doof doof, one in their face
Cuh they can get doof doof, one in their face
Nah nah, nah nah, you know I'd go to war for you
.44 kicking down the door for you
Never scared, I'd go above the law for you
Cuh if the sun don't rise, make it fall for you, ayy

Up in my ends, they're killing my dargs
Tell me who's sane, I feel like Sadam
Rage in my veins, my feelings are numb
But they can get a doof doof if they feel like they aren't
Still deya, for mi chargie, chargie
Cuh mi still deya, for mi chargie, chargie
Cuh mi nah left it, and mi nah left it
Even when we're parting
God willing, I'm praying I can make a good killing
Got my mother still praying for a raise sending barrels to Jamaica
They're tryna send me to the judge
Cuh the gold crosses on me don't work, don't work

[KZ:]
Tired of the crime but the fire in my eyes
Can burn and burn (burn and burn)

Born as a leader
The Lord is my keeper
Pray I don't fall in the winter
Cuh the snow fall in the winter
Heart of a winner
Face of a killer
They say mi shaped like gorilla
That's how they get away when they kill us
Nah nah, nah nah, love in my ends
But mi no call all of dem friends
Cuh mi see their red eye through the lens
Doof doof when I slide in the Benz
Nah nah, nah nah, love in my ends, yeah
But mi no call all of dem friends
Cuh mi see their red eye through the lens now
Doof doof, peace sign on your head now, yeah

Up in my ends, they're killing my dargs
Tell me who's sane, I feel like Sadam
Rage in my veins, my feelings are numb
But they can get a doof doof if they feel like they aren't
Still deya, for mi chargie, chargie
Cuh mi still deya, for mi chargie, chargie
Cuh mi nah left it, and mi nah left it
Even when we're parting
God willing, I'm praying I can make a good killing
Got my mother still praying for a raise sending barrels to Jamaica
They're tryna send me to the judge
Cuh the gold crosses on me don't work, don't work
