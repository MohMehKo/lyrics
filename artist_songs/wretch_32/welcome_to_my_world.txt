[Hook:]
Welcome to my world
Welcome to my world
Welcome to my world
Welcome to my world

[Verse 1:]
Welcome to my Wretchrospective
I'm like welcome to my world, where no one's ahead of the Wretch
And every DJ says I'm the best
But I'm still underground, I'm just tryna get my legs on the steps
But the journey to success will be a hell of a length
It seems worth it but I don't wanna ask for help, I keep working
Ask myself, right through the grey shift, I write till the day's in
But somehow I've still gotta fight for the playlist
I'm creative, my writing's amazing
But everyone's waiting on the hit I ain't making
I make classics, my music's tragic
To live what you right, that's the true missed talent
Then they're telling me I shouldn't do rap
When I grew with that, reggae and bashment
I ain't the same as them anything clash men
I do music for the love, not tryna get a reload, squeezing in clubs
I do this for UK unplugged, Koko, Jazz Caf√©, O2 stuff
Run that and try and leave the whole room touched
Just with a few of my songs
That's my dream, if what I'm pursuing is wrong
I'mma leave, I'mma leave

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
I'm like welcome to my world, where the street ain't a problem
But tryna get sleep ain't an option
Because my son keeps crying but I must keep writing
Every day I'm getting up before the sun be rising
Tryna see funds so my son keeps shining
Passed through the drums and my mum keeps smiling
Cause she ain't been the same since my grandma died and
I've been away like I ain't had no time
Cause the world's on my shoulders, sun's in my face
Who on Earth tried to put a universe on tape?
With words I'm great, I'll soon be a star
And I can have a rally with Venus on Mars
I'm out of this world, I won't stop till it's 300,000 I sell
I'm so on my grind
I don't have time for a wife, I don't have time for a life
I'll live when I die, and that's metaphorically cause legends never die
I'll be sitting up in heaven, I'mma fly, I
Will not quit, this is my dream
And me and Z, we spent too much Ps
Cuh music always takes money
But I tell you this for free, it don't always make money
I've come this far and I've lasted our graft
But my chance is I'm gonna pass every artist

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
Look, I'm like welcome to my world, where they want more from my mixtape
But still say it sounds like an album, why'd they doubt it?
I'm an author that script writes
Over a beat, I describe
The world on the street, get an insight
It's subtitles when I spit rhymes
It's more like a film on a disc, I
Expose how I feel through a crisp mic
Wretchrospective, the movie
On the roads, emotion's a eulogy
On how it goes down is the truth I speak
Cause they can't paint it like I do
Spike Lee's close but he's missing the right tune
Jay-Z's close but he's missing the end scene
I've been both, I deliver a frenzy
I'm Wretch 32
