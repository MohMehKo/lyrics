Sky full of stars, hold me in your arms, I just wanna dance
(You give me something I can feel)
Now we're chest-to-chest, we can have a heart-to-heart
(You give me something I can feel)
Blinded by the lights but you guide me through the dark
(You give me something)
I'm hoping that we last cause even when we're apart
(You give me something I can feel)

These hoes ain't real like you, these hoes don't feel like you
Late night, wondering where I've been, but I peel right through
Just tryna be real by you
So unless I say I did and man, I didn't
And even though I seem distant, I'm just different
You're tryna have my cake and cancel all my wishes
I don't think blowing out my candles make a difference
Because you know you can't be them, you're screaming "carpe diem"
What's on your arm and leg cost an arm and a leg
I call you Barbie-head, you hit me back like hadouken
They're liking all your pictures but they know you can't be friends
Because they're way out of their depth, way out of their depth
I'm a gangster and a gent, we don't even half the rent
I float, give you butterflies and sting you in the Bent'
I'm the greatest, now let me show you what Ali meant

There's a sky full of stars, hold me in your arms, I just wanna dance
(You give me something I can feel)
Now we're chest-to-chest, we can have a heart-to-heart
(You give me something I can feel)
Blinded by the lights but you guide me through the dark
(You give me something)
I'm hoping that we last cause even when we're apart
(You give me something I can feel)

These hoes won't kill like you, these hoes ain't built like you
I must be one step from heaven, you should see my view
Just tryna reveal my truth
See, I ain't tryna L-I-E
Cause only God knows where the hell I've been
And sometimes it feels like the force is with you
Until I'm back with my Return of the Jedi speech
I'm a G with two Os and one D
From the roads, I rose up from the concrete
That means I'm hard as a nail, that makes it harder to fail
And they say love hurts only 'bout as hard as you feel
But all these trips could have us falling into debt
But the money won't determine my success
I mean the money won't determine what you meant
I mean what you mean, what'd you mean that I ain't worshipping your steps?
I used to have you walking on eggshells, we scrambled 'em
I mean, forget all your friends' tales, they're scandalous
See, they're just tipping your scales to turn you cancerous
Our picture's worth a thousand words, they should Michaelangel us
This is Davinchi, 3D in watercolour
I built a house without a label, I'm a Warner Brother
I bring the table to the table, I'm that sort of brother
See, I'mma feed you like I need you
Baby, look above us, can't you see the

Sky full of stars, hold me in your arms, I just wanna dance
(You give me something I can feel)
Now we're chest-to-chest, we can have a heart-to-heart
(You give me something I can feel)
Blinded by the lights but you guide me through the dark
(You give me something)
I'm hoping that we last cause even when we're apart
(You give me something I can feel)

You give me something I can't reel
You give me something they can't steal
You give me something
You give me something I can feel

[Laura Mvula:]
You give me something
You give me something
You give me something
You give me something
You give me something
You give me something
