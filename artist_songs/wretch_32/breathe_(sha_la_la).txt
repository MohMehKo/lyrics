3 bedroom house
6 live inside it
queuing up for the bathroom is a hype ting
staring out the window
all you see is rain and some little bit of lightning
chillin in the ends to the police show up
if one makes a joke then they get shown up
round ere your friends are your family
if ur dad aint around then the ends grows us
these are the times when you feel most neglected
our mum just sent you to the shop to get electric
and deep down you didnt wanna go, but if you ever let her know then you're livin on the road
and right now you're livin on the road, but its nice to know that you got the choice of going home
its wierd cuz its busy in the pitch, but you still cant catch who's pissin in the lift

[Chorus:]
(sha la la) I'm like just give it a rest man, I know best man please
(sha la la) police are still chattin, preachin I had it like please
(sha la la) cuz all the words I'm hearin got my eardrums burning like please
(sha la la) you got nothing good to say then just keep quiet and breathe

Livin paranoid that's what the game does
sitting there talkin how the world is a game
and how you scared of what change does
why would we leave estate it made us
mum keeps saying I should go and get a job
so that's the reason that we dont get along
saying she gonna send me to live with my dad
everyone's an influence and they leading me on
but she dont understand that I'm my own man
I can make me a grand or make her a gran
only thing changes is the number of the days
so with that selotape Imma stick to the plan
cuz its the only way I know how to live
and dont claim that you know how it is
cuz if you ever walk one mile in my shoes
you be slippin in the ends like you need better grip

[Chorus:]
(sha la la) I'm like just give it a rest man, I'm know best man please
(sha la la) police are still chattin, preachin I had it like please
(sha la la) cuz all the words I'm hearin got my eardrums burning like please
(sha la la) you got nothing good to say then just keep quiet and breathe
(sha la la)

Growing up we were ever so skint
that made it so hard tryin to be the fresh prince
I stopped combing my hair on purpose
just so my mom would make me get a fresh trim
lookin in the mirror while I'm gettin out the chair
mumbling to myself "what the fuck you done here"
but I didnt even say it cuz I know I gotta pay him
cuz when you growing up I know nothing aint fair
bodged trim, hoody up, trying to chat girls
she said I chatted up the rest of the world
said I sent texts when I never had credit
the truth is that I done it on free voicemail
I aint saying that I never had a good life
but every other night I had to watch brookside
the soaps are getting boring and its lonely at the bottom
one day I'm gonna make it out the hood life

[Chorus:]
(sha la la) I'm like just give it a rest man, I know best man please
(sha la la) police are still chattin, preachin I had it like please
(sha la la) cuz all the words I'm hearin got my eardrums burning like please
(sha la la) you got nothing good to say then just keep quiet and breathe

(sha la la) I'm like just give it a rest man, I know best man please
(sha la la) police are still chattin, preachin I had it like please
(sha la la) cuz all the words I'm hearin got my eardrums burning like please
(sha la la) you got nothing good to say then just keep quiet and breathe
