You and me failed to see nothing lasts forever

1st off look I still love you but that don't mean we have to stay together cause there ain't nuttin that remains forever, a fact of life you can't change the weather, bring back the nights when I gave you pleasure, and light the fire when it's pissing rain our seperation hit me harder than my father when I misbehaved, I'm still scarred but I don't miss the pain, I feel daft but hear I miss you babe, look after all my kids the same, jermaine, I nearly cried when my baby first smiled that just made it worth while so I told him, dissapear then I came back from a closed end I was even risking being back but shes moany, that's her problem? I don't really have a problem, hand my key n giv me the ammo for dem, infact if we werent debatin it's like were communicating my back she knew she'd be facin but I did prefer that option, it would be worser off iff we stayed and tried to sort it out, cah I know we woulda fought it out, she fort I'm superman just because she knows I can haw and drout so ud never get the water out, and my eyes can I cry, an my pride is my weakness I say I'm cool but I seem stressed there's no dirt still I see mess, I go church but I been blessed it won't hurt if I sleep more but I sleep less.

No it won't be easy, you will agree they can't stay forever

Look my eyes must be no good, how can we keep having beef when you don't cook, her reason being her decietful with cold looks, I'm tryna sleep and you creep through my phonebook deleting on no raunchin, eager to moan shush, I ain't here to fight, that's the reason I ain't there tonight, it ain't fair ITS LIFE, it's like you like it when I'm raring hype, but I ain't hyping you should find your baring fine I'm dissapearing it ain't like I'm caring it's just advice I'm sharing, with you, I didn't really think I should be wary wid u, did you think we'd live happy ever after all the nappys and the drama, I ain't a fan of carma but I believe we'll get our justice earths, cause when it's done it hurts believe when it's love it burns, I didn't wanna see a scene to our son in turns but in life you got alot to learn I wanna wake up to hear him speaking so atleast I hear him mutter words, you know I'm fly so I love the birds so I don't see why your suprised when I'm cluckin girl, ha chicken means nuffin girl, look I'm only joking but same way I ain't coping but the case is closed I think it's best we leave a open gate, but if you get in need and get inpatient maybe we can re evaluate the situation

You and me failed to see (I never saw it coming) nothing lasts forever (we're all living in some honeymoon period)
