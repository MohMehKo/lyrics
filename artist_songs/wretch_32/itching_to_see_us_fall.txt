[Hook - Wretch:]
Niggas where we're from are just itching to see our corpse
They wanna see us laid in the ditch, up in the morgue
When we're tryna do music, they're tryna see us lose it
But I don't understand why they keep thinking these thoughts

[Verse 1 - Ghetts:]
They don't like how I'm going on, I'm still going strong
Pricks are pissed cause they wish it was going wrong
They can't match me or catch me
I'm way too quick, you pricks are too slow, I'm gone
And I'mma make loads of em
Oh come on, my flow's the bomb, and I can spit on anything
Even a smoker song, I make the gyal dem soak their thongs
But every game has pros and cons, so every day I be focused on
Much more than the whips, much more than the chicks
Much more than the frozen tongue
Before [?] I never wrote a song, but
You can't class me as "up and coming"
You can't pass me, I'm up and running
Big [?] when I blast through, you must be bunning
Coke in a bowl, you cats ain't worth
What I throw in the pond, you're a dog, I'm a don and
I'mma tell niggas from this moment on
Bring any opponent, it's on
I don't care where any opponent is from
Local or far, far or local
I'm so advanced that he won't wanna spar
I won't have a bar, my bars are so cruel
Don't have a heart so you don't wanna start
Fresh to death, suited and booted
Truly exclusive, I do do this
My crew's a nuisance, who's the Judas?
I took a wrong turn, I was on the wrong firm
I was concerned that it was a long turn
That's right, I was moving clueless
It all backfired like useless shooters
I'm [?] and I'm moving ruthless

[Verse 2 - Wretch:]
Yeah, they wanna see me dead, with holes in my flesh, bleeding
Believe I'm vexed, I'm stressed out, I'm Wretch now
And plus I don't even know why they're so hot-headed
When it ain't even that season
Look, I'm tryna stay focused
But I'm still underground like rodents
Hating's our culture
They must think we wan' pray like vultures
I'm a target, he could say
Cause they wouldn't walk in Carlito's Way
I'm no prat, and I'll show that
With or without a strap, I won't bat
Away or down a piece, they ain't out for peace
They just let their dogs roam without a leash
I ain't letting my kids grow without a lease
I'll hold that down till I decease
But same way, said speed niggas
Wanna aim heat, get me, never gonna let me
Get through, they don't wanna let Wretch collect cheques
Forget Cosby's, I've got the best tunes
It's real, you can aim at my grill but I'm aiming for mills on card, star
You'd never hit me, if you shot in the air you'd never hit a star, star
And by the way this star shoots back
I ain't gonna stand there and take shots, I've already had my flu jab
I'm down to hit em up like 2Pac
I'm a devil with the metal, so I'll give you angel wings
You'll reside where the angels live
And they'll think I went boo, by the way that I'm taking wigs
