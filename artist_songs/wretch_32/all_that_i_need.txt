[Intro: Talking]
It's crazy, cah I remember when I never felt like this.
It was only the other day I was 'Lying Next to You'.
I remember I done ish, you forgave me.
Even though I 'Can't Say' (heh).
But we both know 'Nothing Lasts Forever'.
(Psssh) Listen

[Verse 1:]
Cah I am not with you no more
Your no good for me, your just bringing me down
My son shines in the rain while your giving me clouds
I once cried and complained now I'm kicking out
Cah I refuse to live in doubt, I don't trust you
It's weird 'cause I love you, but fear cannot love
Who it chooses to scare
Now I'm stress out losing my hair
What's next I ain't losing the year
Your supposed to be me crutch
As of lately you provoked me enough
Especially when I'm closed to being up
I'm finishing my album, your tryna kick when I'm down and
Focusing on other tings, a real women's supposed to be mothering
Not like holding a grudge and ting, when I'm in the studio late
And when I don't come home for a few of the days
Out the week, that just means that I'm doing it babe
Allowed to speak, of course you are
But don't force it cah
I never liked that you crossed the line
You said something that shouldn't even cross your mind
And that's a criminal sentence so do the time
Without me. I'm just doing I
Allow me I am through that wire
I'm now free I am moving higher
I'm proud to see that your cruising Aiya
(Huh) But I am not beside ya

[Chorus:]
All That I Need
Is my own space, I've been chilling on my own for days, I say
All That I Need
Is my own space, I've been chilling on my own for days, I say
All That I Need
Is my own space, I've been chilling on my own for days, I say
All That I Need
Is my own space, I've been chilling on my own for days

[Verse 2:]
We got one another one's on the way
And right now we don't know if that one's gonna stay
Plus I can't look my son in the face, cah I remember the day
That I told his mum chuck him away
But she never listened
She gave birth I was there to vision
It's a boy was the words I whispered
(Huh) And I remember that look on your face
When the nurse said push it again
Your like I can't mommy, I was like your pushing it babe
Your like it's hard bubby, the tears would fall on your face
I'm like gwan honey
Then I gave you a kiss on your lips
(Huh) It's weird that I'm picturing this
Cah fastforward as I listen to this (All that I need)
Piss'd
(Huh) Listen we learnt a lesson that we'll never dismiss
Cah I never thought we'll end up like this
(Huh) Cah perfect films always end with a kiss
And I swear we're at the end of the script
Cah everytime I try read you, I just remember the bitch
I try leave you, and then I end up in bits
I don't think this could ever be fixed

[Chorus:]
All That I Need
Is my own space, cah I've been chilling on my own for days, I say
All That I Need
Is my own space, I've been chilling on my own for days, I say
All That I Need
Is my own space, cah I've been chilling on my own for days, I say
All That I Need
Is my own space, cah I've been chilling on my own for days
All That I Need
All That I Need
All That I Need
All That I Need
All That I Need
All That I Need
All That I Need
