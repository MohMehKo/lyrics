[Verse 1:]
I used to see him every day
I used to rate this guy
Didn't know that they made chains that size
Had my whole house on a neighbors vibe
Lookin' out the window he's on a flagrant hype
First guy I saw with the butterfly baura, cut-a-guy aura
Had my mum sayin' you ain't touching my daughter
Way too bad breed half the youths on road, claimed they were family
They got out the beef if you said he's name
First guy rollin' when Fiesta's came
Offkey diss, capsule of that, champagne sipping with expensive taste!
Wait I'm talking back in the days when
You'll have a tiny little part in your fade when
It weren't BB Pins it was paging
He had Sticks and Stones like the cavemen
Yeah, Man I swear he was a Braveheart
He weren't really playin' games in the SEGA Park
No couple'o names tryna save their arse
Cause it put their mind at ease when they made him laugh
Yeah he had the world on his back and had the ends in his palms
Yeah He was the last man standing
Yeah because his friends didn't last
Uh man I swear he had a legacy
Yeah, street name straight legendary
Yeah, and now he's sitting in jail telling this same story like, I wonder if they remember me...

[Hook:]
How could he be that person my life's cold
When everybody saw you as a king
And then you get dethroned
Cause I don't wanna be that person
Like man she was cold
Cause everyone saw her as a queen
And then she gets dethroned...

[Verse 2:]
I used to see her everyday, young youth begging for a hug
With that cute smile I could never get enough
You'll only get a word if you're relevent enough
The type of angel causing hell up on the bus
Couldn't let her pass you had to chit-chat with her
Probably try and share your lickle Kit-Kat with her
Spending hours on the house phone
God knows you nearly got kicked out fi' her!
I'm like isn't it a shame
The only girl popping off the mrs single wave
The primary school queen secondary's dream
Legendary team the picture's in the frame
Cause you went to the dance just to draw her
And if you locked off the dance it was for her
Might of heard 'couple man fall out and two two's it was for her
So the looks started getting to her head
Every man's talking trying to get into her bed
And then she laid down with one too many
And the mad ting is not one of them's an ex
And when she was looking for a someone
Yeah It was preferably a someone
She found him they were living their dream
And this one guy turned her friends and her loved ones
When I saw her she didn't look right
But who am I to tell her that she didn't look nice
Now picture she with her man on a Prison V
He's asking her "Do the roads still remember me?"
