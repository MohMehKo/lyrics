Dreams
Getting lost in the world I live in
Don't you know we will shine
Cause what's a promise if it ain't worth giving?
Whoa, whoa

[Wretch 32:]
Yeah, my brother's keeper and my mother's leader
My sister Kida and my uncle geniuses
My auntie dissed me, I don't fucking need her
Guess all I'm missing is a cousin skeeter
I say my life's like a movie, should I star in it?
Wretchi Hendrix is playing that guitar with
Rhythm and blues, the same sad songs still on the news
Would you walk a mile as a black kid in their shoes?
As a kid, I found toys in my cereal box
Now the kids are in a box from them serial cops, popping
I lost my voice screaming about this
I guess it's in my genes to have a crease in my trousers
They do what ain't allowed, how can our people allow this?
Saying "don't have a cow, bitch", I feel to halal it
Sizzle and douse it, let it simmer
Sim Simma, I'm a nigga in a Bimmer
I'm a nigga in a Benz, I'm a nigga in a Porsche
My nigga, us niggas still on a horse
But it's way more pricey
The chain's all icey
We just went to the White House from the white street
Roley presidential, I don't even need a side piece
I'mma be successful, you ain't even gotta like me
You ain't even gotta help me, status on the selfie
When I need pounds, I'll be snacking on the wealthy
Eating till I'm healthy, speak until the world see
See no evil and hear no people
Or fear those people, we're soon equal
Hundred years ago, we couldn't even score a touchdown
Wonder why when they see us ball, they get the cuffs out
Cartier the bracelet, put initials on the cuffs now
Perfect my intellect to get effects if I dumb down
Just watch how my race run now

[Wretch 32:]
All I need is good food, good people, a good groove
Then it's good riddance to bad dudes with hood news
I don't even read The Sun no more, just hope the rain don't pour
That pot of gold's on that rainbow floor
See, I see beautiful colours, I see beautiful people
I see a beautiful mother, her insignificant equal
This made a beautiful person, I hope that it changes him
Cause when he gets his rains on him, there won't be no changing him
I done seen a mum strip to buy her son clothes
I done seen a dad shot, then get his skull blown
See, that's a match made in heaven on the same road
Do what you gotta do to get your rainbow
Your SMA gold, to make your chain glow
That's how the game goes, I see your halo
I know you're hurting but you gotta keep the faith, bro
Because your funeral won't take away the pain, bro
I mean, it's time we start moving like Columbus and shit
Getting to our destination, then be burning the ships
Cause there's no turning back now, the further you drift
And I won't let a million dollar man just Virgil my clique
See, I turned into a lion in the jungle I lived
But I see how they treat the lion in this circus I'm in
So now it's more brains, less bite, I'm working with it
But I still get to eat my dinner, have it served with a drink

[Wretch 32:]
Broken out of my sleep
That's the sound of police
I'm having memory loss
Like when my mother's telling me off
Don't tell 'em I'm wrong
You tell 'em I lied, I'll tell 'em I'm god
Is this a game of Simon Says?
Well, Simon says I hope the sirens end
They remind me of when

[Shakka & Wretch 32:]
My mummy told me I should smile more
Before you blink, it's over
No need to rush to grow up
My daddy told me I should smile more
Blue looks better in water
There's way more colours in your heart
Sunshine (my heart's red for you)
(Makes them green envy you)
Everybody loves the sunshine (even if our skies are grey)
(I'm still ocean blue)
