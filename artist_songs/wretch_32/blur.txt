[Intro:]
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-ohhh [x2]

[Hook x2:]
Yeah it's been a Blur
I've been throwing Stone Roses
Sipping on my Oasis
Feeling like the Verve
The drugs don't work
Only if you're Fred Durst

[Verse 1:]
Pocket half empty
But I'm living to the fullest
When I've had a shot
I think I can dodge bullets
If you wanna rock
Tell me you love The Killers
I might give you a job
You'll be working on our business
Just call me Lord Sugar
The sweetest that you been with
I'll never fire you
You'd be too hot to extinguish
I deal with power moves
Checkmate, game finished
The trick is not to lose
That's the only way you're winning
I know I'll never give in, yeah
Cause I've survived mosh pits
With some super fly drop kicks
Only my chains swinging
I ain't into boxing, no
I dont bob and weave women

[Hook x2:]
Yeah, yeah
Ain't it funny how your nightmares
Can turn into your dreams, yeah?
Yeah it's been a Blur
And it happens so fast
That you just can believe it
Yeah it's been a Blur

Yeah it's been a Blur

I do it my way
I'm a little too heavy for you lightweights
I drink 'til my baby gets a migrane
And then my head starts to rumble
This is mind games, this is how my life stays
That's how I stay ahead of myself
My attitude stinks, I can smell it as well
If you always get love you know how Federer felt
You can get around a waist
Just pretend you're a belt
And I ain't claiming to be free
For the past few months I've been raving every week
Started off a nightmare
Then it changed into a dream
Now I like my music loud
Can you turn it up for me?

[Hook x2]

Yeah it's been a Blur

[Bridge:]
Yo, Wretch, you ready?
Aw yeah
Woo
We don't want a Panic at the Disco
We just wanna live our life
But if you Blink 182 then your life
Will just pass you by
Yeah, yeah

[Hook x2]

Yeah it's been a Blur
Yeah it's been a Blur
