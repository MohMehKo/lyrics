[James Blake:]
I don't know about my
I don't know about my dreams

[Wretch 32:]
It's just me, one in this house, I'm getting lonely
Imma make time fly, I'm a roley
Stainless to steal, fameless to real
This guardian makes the papers for real
Snapshots coming out them raves all pissed
They're lucky that I never vomited
Sicker than your average, kissing on the actress
Saying don't go, I'm like welcome to my rap script
Welcome to my manual, things happen automatic
Imma stress casual, call it auto-swagging
But until I say you're allowed, babe allow me
Have faith in your taste, I'm halal meat
Mrs Doubtfire couldn't doubt me
I don't even have to stretch when I down seam
Got flames jumping out my neck when I'm round beats
A killer to you bounties, a nigga to you mounties
The doors of opportunities connect with my house keys
That's why you was looking so lost before you found me
Still soul searching, still hold hurt in
I'm driving down memory lane, they're road-working
Feeling like I'm missing the streets, so dirty
Almost like Christmas Eve, cold turkey
Happy that I'm living my dreams before 30
Laziness, that's a disease that needs surgery
I cut it out, used to run around
In a runaround, now I got a runner running round
And I don't even like that job
But for this family to gain someone has to take the loss
Someone has to play the boss, I don't like that role
You don't know how much heads top and tailed on the roads
You don't know how much friends helped me down to help me grow
That's why it takes so many friends to help me count my pot of gold
You can drown looking in my bowl
I got wind in my cells, one triple, triple oh
In a plaque that's nine carat gold
Worth platinum if you've done it with your soul, ahh yeah

[James Blake:]
I don't know about my love
I don't know about my loving anymore
I don't know about my dreams
