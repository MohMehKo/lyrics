[Intro]
That coulda never been me
Cah I forever been me
Hittin’ on another team
That coulda never been me
Cah I forever been me
Not livin’ out my dreams
That coulda never been me
Cah I forever been me
Hittin’ on another team
That coulda never been me
C’mon and get to know me

[Verse 1]
Look, at the age of fourteen, I felt the pressure on me
That’s why I never did sleep, that I never had dreams
I was forever on the street, I had a pair o’ off-keys
An’ a top of Dolce, an’ had a pair of cold sneaks
That help me run from police
Cah my mother’s so deep, she woulda sent me O.T.
Because she never got pees she was ever so pleased
When I got my own keys, at sixteen so sweet
Even tried to sell weed, but couldn’t get a whole key
I had to let it go peek, didn’t get to know pees
Until I got to eighteen, but still I never OD’d
Cah my foot was in the scene, I had to make it concrete
And now I feed my whole team

[Chorus]
They can’t believe the one they doubted
Is taking the house tonight
When I didn’t even try
Ain’t that what
You screamed and shouted
Cause I’ve made you change your mind
And I didn’t even try

You love it
How he does it
[repeated with adlibs]

[Verse 2]
An’ I ain’t never been tight, I’m like drinks on me
An’ I can do that all night, cah I got my shit right
I never blink or sleep, cah my dream’s my life
So the limit’s my sky, until into the ground I dive
But a legend don’t die so why the hell should I
I’ve got heaven on side, my little boy soon stride
When he gets his own stripes, I get him sponsored by Nike
It’s real talk no hype, cah his daddy’s been fly
I been cool no ice, I don’t stunt I style
It ain’t all about price, unless you get it on swipe
I pay cash no dice, so everything nice
Becah a rider got drive, I get head no lice

[Chorus]
They can’t believe the one they doubted
Is taking the house tonight
When I didn’t even try
Ain’t that what
You screamed and shouted
Cause I’ve made you change your mind
And I didn’t even try

You love it
How he does it
[repeated with adlibs]

[Outro]
That coulda never been me
Cah I forever been me
Hittin’ on another team
That coulda never been me
Cah I forever been me
Not livin’ out my dreams
That coulda never been me
Cah I forever been me
Hittin’ on another team
That coulda never been me
C’mon and get to know me
