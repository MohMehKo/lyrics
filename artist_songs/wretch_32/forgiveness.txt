[Verse 1:]
Feel like I'm slackin' with my children
Focusing on rap tryna back and shake the building
In a race with my own race, just to raise the roof
And I ain't talking 'bout the ceiling
Here's something to believe in:
No sleep, cause you're livin' what you're dreamin'
And it's the lesson in itself
I've my son to call me dad when I miss the parents evenings
Amazed I'm still breathin';
Every other shot I feel my insides bleedin'.
Grandad, turnin' in his grave,
Cah I promised that I'll be there for my gran when she's grievin'
I used to be a man of my word;
Now, time seems to have got the best of my sentence
In that case I'll have to adjourn,
Cause the thought of an excuse is just as bad as the intention

[Hook:]
Excuse me, my friend
I think I might've hit my head
Excuse me, my friend
I don't remember who I am
Cause I'm holdin' on tryna be somebody
But it won't be long before I need somebody
Forgiveness, asking for forgiveness (hey, hey, hey, hey) [x4]

[Verse 2:]
Went to church to pray for a top ten
Then I went number 5, I ain't been back again
But when my jewellery friend phones
Like they got new rings I'll most likely attend
Hoppin' out a new benz, start the car from outside
When is this gonna end?
My mum's still livin' in the endz,
Spent jibs on tha wrist before I put her with celebs
I'm still livin' like a wretch
All I hear is fuck, fuck
All the girls have got tourettes
And no I don't wanna bet
Even the odd bird wanna take me to the nest
I swear I only came for the music, but the more I touch notes,
It's like the more I get stupid
It's a gift and a curse, but before I play myself,
I'm a say this for the [?]

[Hook:]
Excuse me, my friend
I think I might've hit my head
Excuse me, my friend
I don't remember who I am
Cause I'm holdin' on tryna be somebody
But it won't be long before I need somebody
Forgiveness, asking for forgiveness (hey, hey, hey, hey) [x4]

[Outro:]
My shows home, go go this is my entrance
I raise the bar, pole volt it's rapathletics
A famous star on his own counting blessings
A loner no-one phones, I get the message
