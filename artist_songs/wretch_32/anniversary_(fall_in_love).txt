It's funny how we share those laughs, and a year goes fast,
I can't wait till another years goes past,
Grinding, trying make your ear lobes glass,
Diamonds, I put you in a pharaohs arms,
Lets raise those glasses, nobody claimed that we lost it,
We just overcame all the crosses,
Everyone staring at your frame when your passing,
Used to get me jealous,
I ain't changed I'm a bastard,
Only thing changed now I'm car sick, why?
Cause you're driving me crazy,
We just went half's on a baby,
When I have half on a scales,
One day we will have a bunch like bradies,
Right now we just gotta wait no creating,
I'm trying to stay on my feet cos I'm lazy,
Now u can never leave or replace love,
Cos if we make one it will break us.

[Bridge:]
We should make a toast, cos we just went from one year to another,
And I never thought that we'd be this close, we gotta fight when I ride you like a brother,
But your my lover, so lets make a toast, cos we just went from one year to another,
And I never thought that we'd be this close, we gotta fight when I ride you like a brother,
But your my lover.

[Chorus:]
Baby take my hand, your my everything,
We made it through the storm again,
You're my heart and you're my head,
They said we wouldn't last but,
Every year that passes,
We fall in love again, fall in love again, fall in love again.

Look, sometimes I feel like you mirror me, cos you remind me of myself when we disagree,
Arguments, always seemed verbal, literally, then we'd get hotter than an inferno physically,
Yeah and I never acted spiritually, then I saw mini me looking like a different me,
And, this is weird, isn't me, and this is Lauren Hill softly killing me,
Stung like I was hit with a wasp and a killer bee for the first time like I lost my virginity,
My head gone no guillotine, I still get my game on, don't finish me,
Yeah, and look we spring through the winter time, there ain't a season on earth where we didn't shine,
They never thought that we'd make it to the finish line,
Now were on our victory lap on a winner vibe,

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

And let's share those laughs cause the years goes fast, I can't wait till another year goes past,
Let's share those laughs cause the years goes fast, I can't wait till another year goes past,
Let's share those laughs cause the years goes fast, I can't wait till another year goes past,
Let's share those laughs cause the years goes fast, but I can't wait till another year goes past, 
Muah!
