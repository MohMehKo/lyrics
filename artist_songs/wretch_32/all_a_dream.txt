[Knox Brown:]
They say we cannot become
I asked them for their reasons, yeah
They say we cannot be one, oh no
Who said you rule this kingdom? Yeah

[Wretch 32:]
Shackles to Yeezys
We made the transition look easy
I'm never going back on my knees
I always stood for something, man, I fell for my dreams
Into a mosh pit where I saw blacks, whites and Asians
God's gift, now let us baptise the pagans
Them selfies, you can keep them to yourself
I'm painting pictures just to see a better world

[Wretch 32 & Knox Brown:]
They always wanna feed my brain with
Negative vibes but God gets in the way
They always wanna see struggle, yeah
They always wanna put something in my way
But bun that, fire fi dem
They start trouble, we riot again
But bun that, fire fi dem
They start trouble, we riot again

[Wretch 32:]
It was all a dream
It was all a dream
It was all a dream
It was all a dream

[Knox Brown:]
They say we cannot become
I asked them for their reasons, yeah
They say we cannot be one, oh no
Who said you rule this kingdom? Yeah

[Wretch 32:]
God willing
Now the odds are against us
Let's place bets on ourselves and make a killing
In this Stevie Wonder vision, I can throw the ribbon
I mean without a White House, yeah, I'm a president
They cannot eclipse me because of my melanin
Oh, no, no
You and I, you and I
They shoot us down every time we fly

[Wretch 32 & Knox Brown:]
They always wanna feed my brain with
Negative vibes but God gets in the way
They always wanna see struggle, yeah
They always wanna put something in my way
But bun that, fire fi dem
They start trouble, we riot again
But bun that, fire fi dem
They start trouble, we riot again

[Wretch 32:]
It was all a dream
It was all a dream
It was all a dream
It was all a dream

[Wretch 32 & Knox Brown:]
Hope you wish us well every time we try
Broken wishing wells don't keep our dreams alive
When we're wishing on a star, just let us shine
One can only try, one can only try

[Wretch 32 & Knox Brown:]
They always wanna feed my brain with
Negative vibes but God gets in the way
They always wanna see struggle, yeah
They always wanna put something in my way
But bun that, fire fi dem
They start trouble, we riot again
But bun that, fire fi dem
They start trouble, we riot again

[Wretch 32:]
It was all a dream
It was all a dream
It was all a dream
It was all a dream

[Knox Brown:]
They say we cannot become (It was all a dream)
I asked them for their reasons, yeah (It was all a dream)
They say we cannot be one, oh no (It was all a dream)
Who said you rule this kingdom? (It was all a dream)

They say we cannot become
I asked them for their reasons
They say we cannot be one
Who said you rule this kingdom?
