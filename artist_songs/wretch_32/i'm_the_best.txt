[Hook:]
Be the rest, or be the wretch
But you have no fucking idea

My son's getting bigger, now my daughter's getting naughty
My mum getting flashbacks at everything you taught me
Sorry I was waiting for my call-in when you called me
Have to pull my socks up, there's no one to do my laundry
Nowadays I sleep for four hours, then I'm up and out
No jokes, jesters never touch the crown
Even if I'm out of my head, I get out of my bed
And I treat the snooze button like it's running out
Used to run around, and run around
And now I walk away from a hundred thou'
They underestimated my value
They say gold's gone up and I ain't coming down
See I don't snap unless I'm playing cards
XYZee, I'm renowned, got a name on ours
People say that you lot are rich, man you make me laugh
I don't even check my amount, that don't make my art
Me, I'm tryna be here for the longest
Like, would you rather be the sea or the Loch Ness?
Would you rather have an ego or a conscience?
I guess sometimes the Robin Hood's the hostage
Take it how you want it but just make it how you wanna
For every smart guy, there's another dumb and dumber
For every girl I like, there's another tryna cuff her
Taking off her uniform, guess she moving undercover
Ten years in, still I do it for the love of it
I've just gotta thank my whole fam for putting up with it
Throw a shirt on a non-believer, tell him button it
Now I'm having parties in my house, I'm the government
Backbone stronger than it's ever been
Now I tell a snake do the beat or some heroin
Came for the game, I ain't playing but I better win
Remember there's a G at the end of everything

[Hook]

The difference is I'm just tryna make a difference
Nokia longevity, Instagram visual
Being popular is telling me, I'm tryna make it listen
I care about the fans, they care about the vision
Someone once asked me "legacy or cash?"
That's a no-brainer, most legends ain't brass
Rather invent a bus than drive a Maybach
You'll be crying to insure it, I'll be laughing to the bank
A little less flash, how I like to slide through
Nigga with the most drive chilling in the drive-thru
Baby is a little mac, let me supersize you
When you seem a little cold, I'll take you through the pie route
Cheryl taught me so much in a short time
They just made off me like with me and her having wine
Feeding her after titles, feeding their appetite
Never dating celebs cause all my business is mine
Yes, all my business is fine, nowadays I put my suit on
Words to percentages, guess that's how it moves on
Take a break, I'm getting my move on
I bust up in this bitch and I ain't even got my groove on
Nigga where I come from, fist fights and blades
Yeah you become bait when you become bait
You had to make a name before you could where you came
But over there I'm too sweet, like "Shirley, give me a plate"
I ain't back cause I never left
Why the fuck would I ever rest?
I was one witness from Pentonville [?]
What am I gonna do to give back? Who the hell are you
Prick if you was me, you wouldn't step up off that pedestal
If you was me, they wouldn't see you at the hood raves
See you at the funerals, bringing man to festivals
See you in the units where kids ain't got a second chance
And every glance looking at me like I'm edible
We've all got opinions on what I should be doing
If it was so easy, why don't you just do it?
I never got free food, and not once did I need you
But I still share my dreams true
I'm real like that, I feel like that
So when I'm rolling through my ends I still tilt my hat
To everybody showing love cause they feel I'm fam
They don't wanna take my high, they don't feel like crack
I love you
