[Wretch 32:]
I been a wretch from about 3 or 2
Cruisin on the tele it was on channel 2
My dad was in the riots so they came to seize you
Growing up I was a kid that everybody knew
More me, it's like I'm never in the mood
A true pisces my emotions in my tunes
It's an understatement to say it's over with me and you
I took a few shots but I'm soldiering it through
And now I'm looking at my boys turned men
Thinkin lord God we coulda been like them
Cause we ain't the type to fear our opponents
The road door closed when my career pass opened
It's like I'm drinking more than I'm thinking
Celebrating as I'm crossing off my wish list
I'm sleeping with both eyes open
I'm living my dream man, I don't wanna miss this

[Angel:]
I'm not the man you thought I should be
That's just the way we drop them jeans where I stay
I'm not the man you thought I should be
Just take a second get to know me

[Wretch 32:]
It takes a second just to look me in my eyes
It takes an hour just to listen to my life
It took me years just to push me to this hype
But it take a lifetime to try and duplicate my vibe I'm me
Smooth with my scratches and scars I'm free
2 minute stamp on the charts
And I'm sending a letter, I hope you receive it
Hand on my heart I'm a flow while it's beating
To put it in words, it coulda been worse
From the undergrounds I coulda been dirt
I took a right turn at a wrong place
Cause sometimes shortcuts are the long way
Gotta have strong faith
Now I'm pleading with my baby mamma
She tryin to tell me that I turned into a lady lover
Huh, I got my eye on the prize and I'm bringing home the bread
Let's make a toast, you can save the butter

[Angel:]
I'm not the man you thought I should be
That's just the way we drop them jeans where I stay
I'm not the man you thought I should be
Just take a second get to know me

I'm not the man you thought I should be
That's just the way we drop them jeans where I stay
I'm not the man you thought I should be
Just take a second get to know me

[Chipmunk:]
Hey yo wretch
Let me get this from here, yeah
Last month a 14 year old in my hood got stabbed and died
I used to cruise on my bike down that same side road that he lost his life
I fill a cup with tears and lick it back like a shot just to swallow my pride
Niggas would eat from your bowl and you keep down like a pin coulda hold a strike
You don't know what it's like
Getting cheese amongst a rats fam
From a town where robin could rob batman
Taxman underneath the taxman giving me that tax man
I'd rather die from death man
And everything ain't what it seems on these shelves
You parting red seas and A&R in ourselves
And you can still get a deal and get shelved
Getting signed won't necessarily help
All this fire in my tank
I've come too far to get shanked
I'm walking on water that others sank
And I'm laughing all the way to the bank
Power of the grime, lord on my side
Test me, I can make a preacher man grimes
From a council estate but yeah we made it
Best things can come from the worse places

[Angel:]
I'm not the man you thought I should be
That's just the way we drop them jeans where I stay
I'm not the man you thought I should be
Just take a second get to know me

I'm not the man you thought I should be
That's just the way we drop them jeans where I stay
I'm not the man you thought I should be
Just take a second get to know me
