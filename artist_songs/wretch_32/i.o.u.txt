(I.O.U)
(A, E, I.O.U)
The way, when no one else was there you held my hand
When I was weak you gave me strength to stand
An lady who taught me to be your man
I'll never forget that

Big sis' you're more like second mum
Mother's Day gifts you'll be getting a second one
Breath of fresh air, I will give you my second lung
Even when we do get it wrong we still get along
Remember when we had a cat and dog? We used to fight like Cat and Dog
Flickin' through the catalogue before I ever had a song but now you're in my catalogue
Yeah, you take me higher than any E with a capital
You know that I'm a G so I'ma always show you gratitude
First is, second mum, how am I gonna thank you all?
When mum wasn't here you'd be shouting in my ear
Canon jumped into gear, it was like you had a manual
Running out of words, this ain't a chapter, it's a verse
I'll be free by your side until they trap me in a hearse
I owe you everything I earn, everything is hers
I'll write an I.O.U cause what's the man without the words?

[Emeli Sandé:]
A, E, I.O.U, I vow forever
A, E, I.O.U, yes I remember
A, E, I.O.U, my best forever
A, E, I.O.U

First mum, second god
I pray we always get along
You're raising my princess, hope she reaches your echelon
I didn't know a queen had to be a king too
You worked every hour and you cooked and cleaned too
That little bit of flour made a three-course meal
That's why your hotels have always got a sea view
You were the first to give me breath, 
the first to help me with my steps, 
even the first to call me Wretch and now they call me 32
Any time I'm on the stage, man I feel your presence
If I only had a word I'd give you half the letters
And if I ever done time you'd do half the sentence
Lucky I never went, when I got my ass arrested
Cause you always kept me in when I was running the streets
And any time I came late you was gunning for me
I'm uncomfortable until you living comfortably
And I will never take a penny because I love you for free

[Emeli Sandé:]
Baby, I.O.U, I vow forever
Baby, I.O.U, yes I remember
Baby, I.O.U, my best forever
Baby, I.O.U

[Emeli Sandé & Wretch 32:]
The way, you loved me more than I did love myself
The one that I can trust like no one else
You picked me up and carried me from hell
And I just want you to know that

Baby, I.O.U, I vow forever
Baby, I.O.U, yes I remember
Baby, I.O.U, my best forever
Baby, I.O.U

Baby, I.O.U, I vow forever
Baby, I.O.U, yes I remember
Baby, I.O.U, my best forever
Baby, I.O.U
