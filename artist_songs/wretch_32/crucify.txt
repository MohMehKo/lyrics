[Hook - Bobii Lewis:]
You can't see without no direction
Excuse me if you think I'm blessed
I smoke my weed, listen to Sade
I ain't got time for no check
Cause the police got my people down here
The police shot my people down here
So you can keep my reservations
Cause I won't wait to vent for no one

[Verse 1 - Bobii Lewis:]
I don't know what you came here for
What do you take me for?
Wake up and praise the lord
I even pray for yours
They see evil, I see people
They see life, I see ghosts
Feed you bullshit, teach you bullshit
And you breathe it, fuck your smoke
I know I'm on another level anyway
I feel amazing, I hope you're doing OK
I wish the best for you but I can't keep you safe
So I lay low, on my wave, I might say so
Could have been different, could have been fatal
Wishing on a star and a rainbow
Tryna find a pot of gold on my way home
On my way home

[Bridge - Bobii Lewis:]
Judgement day was today
I love life, they wanna kill me
Right before I die, I'll rise
I'm crucified

[Hook - Bobii Lewis:]
You can't see without no direction
Excuse me if you think I'm blessed
I smoke my weed, listen to Sade
I ain't got time for no check
Cause the police got my people down here
The police shot my people down here
So you can keep my reservations
Cause I won't wait to vent for no one

[Verse 2 - Wretch 32:]
Grew up in a jungle where the lion kills another
Wears the mane, man, then roars "suck your mudda"
Grew up in an ends where a nigga's baby mama
Leaves the papa and then goes and fucks the brudda
Grew up in a place where the poor people suffering
The rich just going by the borough
I grew up in the scene where they don't want a chart-topper
They want to see us clash and kill each other, ahh
Should I scream?
Or should I Martin Luther King and have a dream?
Made my first bag when I was only 16
You times that by ten, you get half a sixteen
I've grown now
My new deal, I'm tryna hold out
Tell iTunes I need the whole cloud
I used to sell yay, watch the throne now
I'mma put my foot on the game until I'm thrown out
Renowned, the empire they could never diminish
Got a mill from Channel 4, could you handle them figures?
We can sign an artist or we can publish your lyrics
We ain't even started, that's just a humble beginning

[Hook - Bobii Lewis:]
You can't see without no direction
Excuse me if you think I'm blessed

Cause I won't wait to vent for no one

[Verse 3 - Avelino:]
Rich nigga, poor me
I don't think them man are ready
Yeah, I don't think they know that man are ready
Mmm, walk in my shoes, I never had Giuseppes
I rapped white then put in the banks, I'm Benny
Penny for my thoughts, just to hit the belly
I'd hit my jaw, paw-licker, I want Henny on my corpse
I'm in hell's kitchen and I'm ready for my chores
Ever since the mandem took the lead, it's been awks
Yeah, so turn the music up loud
I've been doing this for donkey, now the youts are buckwild
It was run with, I saw you get run down
Weekends in the lab, I guess the losers won now
Never listened to what my mama said
She said our father's prayer now my father's dead
If what goes around comes around, when does karma end?
I'm so close to taking shit too far again

[Bridge - Bobii Lewis:]
Judgement day was today
I love life, they wanna kill me
Right before I die, I'll rise
I'm crucified

[Verse 4 - Avelino & Wretch:]
Uh huh, I never thought I'd meet my idols
Never thought the youts I'd meet would idolise me, what are we, disciples?
Death before dishonour, that's our street survival
Niggas wait for them to throw us the book just to read the Bible
I'mma pedal to the meddle, tryna leave the cycle
Looking in the mirror, I can see my rival
They all want the Jigga wave until they see the Tidal
People multiply to take away and that's how they divide you
