[Chorus:]
I'm levels above that's blatant
Just check my punctuation
I'm coming to take it run with the game
Now under the sun's adjacent
I'm levels above that's blatant
Just check my punctuation
I'm coming to take it run with the game
None under the sun's adjacent

Capital letter who's better than Wretch over here or close
Who's had an exceptional year not most
Who's actually sped through the gears or drove
Question mark you guys ain't moving step up you level
I'm on the ground with the heat the devil the street the ghetto the scene (huh) who's hot full stop
After I slept with talent I divorced my nerves and my mixtape it recorded my birth
Of course I'm preferred check my verbs
The heat starts when my speech marks (Yeah)
When they cut the cord then I knew I must perform
My worst bars way above the norm
And that's no estimation exclamation 
New paragraph each time I write
Screw managers they just want a piece of the pie
You'd think they knew I move food
By the way they wanna eat of my lines
Comma look I can see through my eyes
I can hear through my ears
I don't wann get locked cause I'm fearing the years
Comma I'm already behind bars

[Chorus:]
I'm levels above that's blatant
Just check my punctuation
I'm coming to take it run with the game
Now under the sun's adjacent
I'm levels above that's blatant
Just check my punctuation
I'm coming to take it run with the game
None under the sun's adjacent

(Look) Who's better than Wretch over here full stop
Who's had an exceptional year
Question Mark I'm the greatest
Exclamation quotation

New paragraph capital I I'm gona capitalise and capture my hype
I'm that it's my time comma you slack in your prime full stop
(Look) Let me roll on semi colon you're a waste of time
Space line paper so in brackets I am greater
No hyphen (huh) and you won't forget me if you remember the titans
My writing stays at the highest peak I ride the beat
I won't fall I like my seat quotation so hot so blatant
I won't stop no patience is left in me I'm blessed indeed I'm next excuse me
I got manners I'm polite G even though I've goat manners behind me
Like T that's abbreviated slightly
Will I be the greatest likely I might be
Dash high percentage that's just my prospective plus my Wretrospective

[Chorus:]
I'm levels above that's blatant
Just check my punctuation
I'm coming to take it run with the game
Now under the sun's adjacent
I'm levels above that's blatant
Just check my punctuation
I'm coming to take it run with the game
None under the sun's adjacent

(Look) Who's better than Wretch over here full stop Who's had an exceptional year Question Mark I'm the greatest Exclamation quotation
