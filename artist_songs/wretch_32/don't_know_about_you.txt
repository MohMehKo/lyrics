[Verse 1 - Wretch 32:]
You think I could get used to this
From my chain they wanna see me on a crucifix
Wish people used their brain before they moved their lips
Then they'll have a horsepowered mind and a stupid whip
I guess I'll keep fuelling it
I've got a stomach full of fire imma keep it lit
Coming from crime now I'm too legit
Never judge a book by its cover till you read a bit
The reasoning I've got a new yard, I don't sleep in it
Used to want a key to get a key, now that dream's a myth
Time changed, my mind changed
Yours would seeing my figures in my frames
My niggas were like apes, now we go bananas
In the rave shots early, then pray that we die late
Your students and my game
Your pupils will dilate
And then I'll still tell you to drive safe

[Hook - Mark Asari:]
Sitting with this pen all day
Writing my life away
Hoping my mind don't change
Every other night I say
I can't give this up
I don't know about you
I don't know about you
I don't know about you
I don't know about you
I don't know about you

[Verse 2 - Wretch 32:]
Change your mind or let your mind change ya
I'm indecisive with myself, I'm a slight hater
I'm going for the belt now, my mind's made up
If I ain't tryna be the best then I ain't tryna wake up
Make a difference being different
Found out it's hard to make a living just living
A million ain't living, I guess it's just skimming
There's Branson's water island to go swim in
Now I'm thinking, there's always another level
That every day above ground is above the devil
Still niggas would feel the heat if they touch a kettle
Whenever you're skinning tea they get comfortable
Judgemental, I guess that's how they raised us
They had PTs, we just wanted trainers
They want 3D, when we've been watching danger
They have sweet dreams, and we just wanna wake up

[Hook]

[Wretch 32:]
Che, what you know about
Tryna turn the globe to your local town
They didn't wanna know but I broke em down
I done it with my eyes closed and an open mouth
