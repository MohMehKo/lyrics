Cause oh girl, I love you like cooked food

Chick King, the best thigh and the breast
Everybody wants a piece on the ends
I paid for it, I won't even pretend
Thought our shit was sorted till she got grease on my bed
And I went quiet on her
Yeah, hit the silence on her
She was weighting me down, I had to diet on her
She fucks with me cuh I'm getting chips
And I'll always have a wingman if she got relatives
No, baby, I'll let you know, baby
You're gonna kill me if I see you every day
Let me go, baby, uh, just let me go, baby
You know it's been a generation game
From my old lady, yeah, and her old lady
You're gonna feel me if I see you every day
In my postcode, and I won't say no, so
Why you acting like you don't know?

I love you like cooked food
Oh girl, I love you like cooked food
Even though I don't cook food
You know I love you like cooked food

You should never dress like you're under-priced
Cause they ain't seeing where you're coming from in life
Standing on the market, everybody wants a slice
Think your mother dropped the egg for them to cut you with the knife?
It's a cutthroat business, I trust no women
I give the world my heart and hope the love grows in 'em
And one day we'll have our own son or chicken
They're both born gold and they cluck no different
No way, I love it when you dress saucy
And the way you make it dip when you're naughty
Are you really gonna keep me fit till I'm fourty?
In casinos, tryna get chips to divorce me
All jokes aside, I'll get some fries with you
And I don't have a side chick because I side with you
Yeah, the weather's hot, I guess I'll fry with you
I'm tryna bubble like Coke and supersize the view

I love you like cooked food
Oh girl, I love you like cooked food
Even though I don't cook food
You know I love you like cooked food

Remember when I was hungry doing stick-ups on the ends?
You're the only one that kept me fed
I got my Ps up so I had to let 'em spread
Now everywhere I go, I'm dropping bread on chicken heads
I'm happy that I now see you all over the ends
Cause I can see the power in them legs
Think I can get some salad with them breasts?
If you can still fly, I'll stay with you till the ends

I love you like cooked food
Oh girl, I love you like cooked food
Even though I don't cook food
You know I love you like cooked food
