[Pre-Hook - Wretch 32:]
Buss the pussy open for a dolphin
Let me swim into your ocean
Free Willy for a moment
You ain't got a choice, you was chosen

[Hook - Wretch 32:]
Ice, frozen
Kodak, enjoy the moment
Ripped jeans and the way the leg drop like
My nigga Hulk Hogan
My nigga Hulk Hogan
My nigga Hulk Hogan
The way I ripped off my shirt like
My nigga Hulk Hogan

[Bridge - Avelino:]
Don't write my name on lists, write my name in lights
Told her she can love anybody
And I won't make a fuss but it made her fight
They're just tryna sink our relationship
I let them ride the wave, them I wave goodbye
Roll a paper plane, we can take a flight
Oh, he did you wrong? I can make it right
I can make it right

[Verse 1 - Wretch 32:]
She was home alone, Macaulay Culkin
Nah, really, she was coking
Whatever rocks your boat, keep floating
But that's something I don't indulge in
This relationship's open
Give a dog a bone and I bone it
That's a bonus
I'm a house nigga but I own it

Buss the pussy open for a dolphin
Let me swim into your ocean
Free Willy for a moment
You ain't got a choice, you was chosen

Roll a paper plane, we can take a flight
Oh, he did you wrong? I can make it right
I can make it right

[Verse 2 - Avelino:]
Bust the pussy open in the open
I'mma put 7Up if she's coking
Make her buss it till it's open
Funny thing is I'm so serious, I'm joking
It's 15, one homeless
Say nothing, that's the slogan
Rolled Dutch, she was smoking
I made her toke it for a token, ayy
