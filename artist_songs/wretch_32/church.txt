I should let the keys play
What you thankful for?

[Wretch 32 & Teni Tinks:]
I could've been in jail on a Monday
Instead I'm in church on a Sunday
(I'm grateful)
I could've been in jail on a Monday
Instead I'm in church on a Sunday
I'm thankful for that
(I'm so grateful)
I could've been in jail on a Monday
Instead I'm in a church on a Sunday
(I'm great and I'm full, I'm grateful)
I could've been in jail on a Monday
Instead I'm in church on a Sunday

We're walking past her that is
Man I see a couple girls that I was partying with
It's like Ciroc was holy water
They was asking for drinks
Telling me their life story
How they fathered their kids
I'm like who am I to judge
Throwing stones, in this glass house of mine
I should write an album, call it
"Growing Over Life"
I'm growing over time
Going ghost with poltergeists
If I disappear I'll only reappear in holy time
I mean rollie time cause the clock's ticking
This is money from forgiveness, this is not sinning
I say a prayer for the prisoners who did not listen
This ain't a verse from the Bible, but it's god written
Man, I know they're shutting doors on all your ideas
But I ain't never seen a prosecutor fight fair
I'm right here in your right ear, almost like Tyson on Evander
I got proper grammar, ain't got time for propaganda
I'm present in my ends, I'm almost like a pop-up Santa
But it's like the feds would rather see a MC with a hammer
Go broke again, nah, I won't go broke again
Rainy days made me hold my cleanse
And now I'm focusing, I'm Ford cars focused in
This song lets me know I'm king, oh yeah

[Wretch 32 & Teni Tinks:]
I could've been in jail on a Monday
Instead I'm in church on a Sunday
(I'm grateful)
I could've been in jail on a Monday
Instead I'm in church on a Sunday
I'm thankful for that
I could've been in jail on a Monday
Instead I'm in a church on a Sunday
I could've been in jail on a Monday
Instead I'm in a church on a Sunday

It's true stories, man, that story is true
You're winning if you're clean hearted, that's the glory in you
The good's glowing in your eyes like fluorescent lights
I pray you get a good run if you need exercise
But right now I'm trying to focus on the loyalty
I mean that first album, tenth album loyalty
I be like Prince, man, I'm living off my royalties
Cause, you see, music's in my roots, it's the soil in me
Until they put the soil on me
My mum gave birth, she was kicking and screaming
When she dragged me to church, I was kicking and screaming
Now I'm here with free will, I'm just living and dreaming
It's the cycle of life, guess it keeps on repeating
See, I had to paint the sky to see there isn't a ceiling
Guess the luxury of sight helped me kill off my demons
So you ain't cuffing me tonight, they'll be kicking and screaming
The whole ends is on my side and it's a mutual feeling
But I'm in drive though, I'm reminiscing on the high road
[?] used to send us home when we would fight, bro
Saw the whole ends shed a tear when she died, bro
That's the type of person that will always be alive, though
We all know them people in our life
But sometimes we gotta let them fly
Anybody special never dies
I'm giving you my growing pains, growing over life

[Loick Essien:]
In this world of sin
I nearly lost my innocence
And in my darkest hour
I still wouldn't go back
I still wouldn't go
Still wouldn't go
I still wouldn't go
Cause I'm grateful
Cause I'm grateful

[Choir x6:]
I'm grateful
So grateful
I'm great and I'm full
Yeah I'm grateful
