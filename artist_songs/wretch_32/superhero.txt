I'll be your super
I'll be your super
I'll be your superhero
I'll be your super
I'll be your super
I'll be your superhero

I'll be your superhero
I'll fly right by
I come to scoop you spend some dineros
Cause I'm that guy

Oh, babe,
Look, I'll be your superhero but just for the night
Confused my ego but just for the night
If you choose to leave home it's just for the night
Just for the hype... Why?
Cause if you live for today, I'll whisk you away
Superman style bring you to space
Choose a man like me think we're the same
Under links in a chain, babe
Cause I'm cooler than ice, I ain't cruisin' I glide
You should move with the times, cah they ain't smoother than I
Whoever told you I'm not that guy
Whoever told you that I'm not that fly
Pinocchio nose, that's one bad lie

I'll be your superhero
I'll fly right by
I come to scoop you spend some dineros
Cause I'm that guy

I'll be your superhero
I'll fly right by
(Superman style bring you to space)
I come to scoop you spend some dineros
Cause I'm that guy
(Choose a man like me, think we're the same)

Look babe I can make it thunder
Might save the day if I save your number
Might hate to wave babe but Wayne can wonder
And I ain't like him!
No, cah I'm nothin' like your ex-man, I'm something like an X-man
So assume I'm a mutant, I'm immune to the nuisance
My lines are slim!
And I ain't one to wait on you
And I ain't got my game on true
I ain't got a cape on
Ain't got an "S" on the chest that my chain's on - boo
Whoever told you I'm not that guy
Whoever told you that I'm not that fly
Pinocchio nose that's one bad lie

I'll be your superhero
I'll fly right by
(Superman style bring you to space)
I come to scoop you spend some dineros
Cause I'm that guy
(Choose a man like me, think we're the same)

I'll be your superhero
I'll fly right by
I come to scoop you spend some dineros
Cause I'm that guy

(I'll be your super
I'll be your super
I'll be your superhero)
I'll be your hero
I'll be your hero
I'll be your hero
I'll be your hero

Listen,
Babe, I'm cooler than ice, I ain't cruisin' I glide
You should move with the times, cah they ain't smoother than I
Whoever told you I'm not that guy
Whoever told you that I'm not that fly
Pinocchio nose, that's one bad lie
