Get money

They didn't pull up like us
Tour bus
With my face on it
Got links, I can even put my chain on it
I hope she can lip read
I'm in the corner, daring her to kiss me
Showing me her cups like drink these
I've got the queen's head, giving her the king's speech

Yeah, she kept tapping me
Give her the menu, what you having B?
Stop squinting up your eyes, you embarrass me
I ain't looking at the price, I am swagganese

[Hook]

Uh, uh, I keep it real
I'm gassed up and I ain't even on a pill
I'm gassed up, cause I been leaving on appeal
Man I don't know what I'm saying, I'm just saying what I feel

Yeah, yeah, fuck the doorman
We run the floor, fam
I'm the best shooter on the pitch
That's how I know I'm gonna score fam
And if I'm over here, they'll be over here
Looking like money, I don't have to spend the most in there
Call me Kid Cudi, day and night, got the chauffeur there
Told her that she'll have the best time, I'm a Roley rare

Yeah, she kept tapping me
Give her the menu, what you having B?
Stop squinting up your eyes, you embarrass me
I ain't looking at the price, I am swagganese

[Hook]

Uh, uh, I keep it real
I'm gassed up and I ain't even on a pill
I'm gassed up, cause I been leaving on appeal
Man I don't know what I'm saying, I'm just saying what I feel

Yeah, yeah
