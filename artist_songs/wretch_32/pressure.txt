Stay there, if you wan' stay there making complaints
I'ma change my own fate
I'm the same kid that was starving
Scraping on plates
Now I drive a new plate
Late night fighting those demons
Praying for a break
I just pray I don't break
You only get one shot
There is not a outtake, uh
I pray you make it out safe

Even my mum put pressure on me
And then my son put pressure on me
Even the slum put pressure on me
But pressure makes diamonds
Even my mum put pressure on me
And then my son put pressure on me
Even the slum put pressure on me
But pressure makes diamonds

Look what the pressure made
It made you make it
Singing "Started from the Bottom"
Cause you started from the bottom, in the basement
Look at what the pressure made
It made you make it
Singer started from the bottom
Cause you started from the bottom, in the basement

I'ma take you back to '03
See my olders used to have a cold steez
I swear, everything they wore was off-key
And I just wanna see them jackets on me
Remember Sticher in the coup with OG
Or Ratty when he had the cold Jeep
I swear everything they wore was on freeze
I mean everything they wore was on fleek
See the jungle where I live is concrete
I'm just tryna be a Mowgli
And everybody's trapping 'round me
But nobody ain't styling on me
I turned into the older that I always wan' be
I copped my first Q from C's
I'm tryna build my line, I can't sleep
Then I built my line and now I can't sleep
Now my neighbors dem are getting nosey
Cah I'm in and out, can't pass three
And my baby mother's getting lonely
And every day she says she wan' leave
Now the next ting, she saying she ah breed
I can't breathe
Cah now I gotta make some more P
But it's getting cat and mouse with the police
I just got a chase, had to dash a lil B
Came back couldn't even find E
And then the fucking feds even tried to take Z
And when they came back, man, the fuckers took P
They raided 6 yards it was 6:30
Federali looking like the army
So now I got the feeling that they're tryna swarm me
So now I'm only rapping on beats

Even my mum put pressure on me
And then my son put pressure on me
Even the slum put pressure on me
But pressure makes diamonds
Even my mum put pressure on me
And then my son put pressure on me
Even the slum put pressure on me
But pressure makes diamonds

Look what the pressure made
It made you make it
Singing "Started from the Bottom"
Cause you started from the bottom, in the basement
Look at what the pressure made
It made you make it
Singer started from the bottom
Cause you started from the bottom, in the basement

Now I got my whole fam banking on me
Cause if I don't provide then nobody don't eat
The Lord made a giant out of little old me
Cause pressure made I, man
Now I got my whole fam banking on me
Cause if I don't provide then nobody don't eat
The Lord made a giant out of little old me
Cause pressure made I, man, yeah

All the stresses, yeah
For us, adult adolescents
I been getting paid just to finish off my sentence
Same time my little brother's trying to finish off his sentence
We just wanna shine, we put diamonds in our pendants
Truth is, we're just trying to find some independence
Our descendants probably look and think we look horrendous
Which side is your preference? Love and hate got four letters
Those who wish me death, I just say they got a deathwish
Call them toy soliders, I can eat them for my breakfast
Put them in my eggs, leave them running till they're breathless
Or put them in the pan, let them sizzle till they perish
I'm a diamond and I'm precious, my diamond's from the pressure
