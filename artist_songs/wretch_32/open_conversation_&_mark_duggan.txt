Grown on me
Can't sing but I wrote you a song, that's grown on me
And my treasures have grown on me
Aware of the responsibilities, grown on me
And when I wear a suit and tie, it looks grown on me
I ain't changed, I'm just a new old me
Or did you know me?
Grown on me

(Music so gorgeous, got you feeling flawless)
(Music so gorgeous, got you feeling flawless)
(Mu-mu-music so gorgeous, got you feeling flawless)
(Music so gorgeous, got you feeling flawless)
(Music so gorgeous, got-got you feeling flawless)

[Wretch 32:]
Uh, I grew up on Eternal, I'm tryna be the same
Ever seen a flame in the rain?
No? Then you've never seen Jermaine
In his white-gold chain back in the day, just give me space
Yeah
Though I might have took a Galaxy
I never had a pound
Couldn't afford a Ford so I had to run around
What the fuck's an allergy?
All my niggas nuts
We weren't allowed in the youth club
Before we hit the clubs
They said enough was enough
So we had to give 'em more
When you see sides, I just wanna know you're sure
Are you sure?
Or do you sympathise?
You grew up on Kinder Surprise
I had licks and rice and had to drink my pride
One-on-one since six or five
Lost my marbles, looking down the drain
Tryna find 'em, I couldn't find 'em
(Look a little closer to home, you might find 'em)
I might find 'em?
Fuck that, I've got my skateboard
I've got my rucksack, I've got my 8 balls
I've got two sticks and I ain't playing pool
I know who's who, I'm from the same school
And it's hard knocks, where it makes you
Or it breaks you, I didn't snap in half
I just snapped in class
It's a miracle I didn't catch that charge
Ain't got time to waste
Night time, that's like my time of day
When you're 32 shade of grey
In this concrete jungle, you've gotta pave a way
Just don't let 'em take your Jane
(Can't take you, baby)
I start playing Jason when they get adjacent
You know how that movie goes
Click-clack, bang-bang, on my phones, 2Pac taught me that
Biggie Smalls taught me swag
Got my Versace shirt, put my car in reverse
I was hypnotised with Medusa in my lenses
Now I'm Medusa to my exes
Don't look at me, don't look at me
Unless you've got the whole booking fee
I used to have a hole in my jeans
Holes in my tee
Now I buy outfits for the whole of my team
You couldn't shot on the block I live
Moving Bobby Brown, that was just my prerogative
Just my prerogative
Driving cars with no indicators
I took a right turn with no indication
The only stimulation was ipi-dipi-dation
How many of my niggas I'll be seeing in the station?
I'm getting fed up
'Member they put the cuffs on me
Felt like I couldn't even stand up or breathe
Brother Mark never made it to custody
I see his kids now and again
I give them every cent that I've got up in my pocket
But it isn't enough
Cause when he saw me at the lights, he said give me your number
Got the same school shirt, now I'm wearing this jumper
Saying RIP
Just know you R-I me
Every verse from your coffin and I'm not stopping
Sick of money often, see Kamani often, see Shenaia often
See the pressures we had, tryna take it off them
Turned the hangman rope into straight white-gold
Cuh we rose from the dungeon
Zeros to the hundreds
And they can write books on us where we come from
That's why we're heroes on our junction

[Varren Wade:]

(Music so gorgeous, got you feeling flawless)
(Mu-mu-music so gorgeous, got you feeling flawless)
(Music so gorgeous, got you feeling flawless)
(Music so gorgeous, got-got you feeling flawless)

Who are the murderers?
Police are the murderers!
No justice? No peace!
No justice? No peace!
No justice? No peace!
We don't do this because we want to do this
We don't do this because we read in a book that it's a good thing to do
We do this because for generations, they've been killing black people all over the country
Poor and working class people all over the country
And always getting away with it

[Bobii Lewis:]
I heard it's all been love
Cupid, draw back your bow
We need to follow that arrow
While I'm on my feet
If they shoot me down, would you riot for me?
Riot for me
We need to follow that arrow
As long as we believe
Two tears falling like the innocent
Spirits in the wind
What's respect if they expect silence?
Oh
Sirens when we disrespect
Sirens when we disrespect
What's respect if they expect silence?
We hear sirens when we disrespect, yeah

[Avelino:]
I just lost my mind
I just lost my mind
Is it me or am I scared of the cops outside?
There's cops outside
There's an I in team but I'm on my side, I guess
Roses are red
Violets for the violence
Yeah

[Bobii Lewis:]
What's respect if they expect silence?
We hear sirens when we disrespect
