Fasten your seatbelt
I'm about to take you on a journey
On par with your dream world
A master at retail
Cah I'll be entering the charts with
A half of my pre-sales
A bastard that means well
Cause' everything I touch breaks
I should sign me a sweet girl
Fly me an email
And give your life to the game that's
The minor of details

Give your life to the game the most
The minor of details
Give your life to the game
So why would I be vex
I made it out of the hex
While nuff man got murked I came out
In a benz
And yet I'm still on the ends
With not one new friend
My whole circles in shape
We came first to the race
I came second on my second attempt
It was well worth the wait like
Every verse every day like
Every word every tape
Every person that ate I
Still got the same hunger
So I work every day why?
The closer I get now the further
My break time
Being safe ain't safe
But the combinations still the same
You do you and everybody commentates
On your game
That's just the way it plays
But I remember being eight
Thinking how do I get a chain?
Now I gave mine away
Because the goals got to change
Or you get caught offside in the crossfire
Everyone claims that they told
You to wait
Cah they just wanted you replaced

The dark side of my life
Where my heart weren't alive
The light side of my life
Where my dreams came to life
The dark side of my life
Where my heart weren't alive
The light side of my life
Where my dreams came to life

The reason I never had a heart
Is because I never had a chance
Playing monopoly thinking will I
Ever get a yard?
Now mayfair ain't far
But if I go, then did I really play my role
I walk around to show hope
I don't need to showboat
We all know I've got dough
Now I want to see my people
Evolve sho
I t ain't a sprint, it's a marathon
So I can't piggy back any tag alongs
If you weren't there when we were
Four in a travelodge
Then you'll only make me laugh
Carry on
You know you're your own man
When you're giving advice to your
Old man
You keep the roof over mums head
Cah you can't put a price on a
Home fam
Nevertheless everyone will forever
Suggest
That they can invest
That's intelligent stressi came to rap I
Don't penny you're cheques
I just wanna be heard
I wanna be first
I don't know it all like them wannabe
Nerds
But I am not the man of the hour
I'm the man with the power
Cah I just put my sun on the earth
Word

The dark side of my life
Where my heart weren't alive
The light side of my life
Where my dreams came to life
The dark side of my life
Where my heart weren't alive
The light side of my life
Where my dreams came to life
Where my heart weren't alive
The light side of my life where
My dreams came to life
The dark side of my life
Where my heart weren't alive
The light side of my life
Now it's in black and white
