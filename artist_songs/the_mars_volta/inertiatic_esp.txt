Now I'm lost 

Last night I heard lepers 
flinch like birth defects 
its musk was fecal in origin 
as the words dribbled off of its chin 
it said I'm lost 
I'm lost 

Now I'm lost 

Dolls wreck the minced meat of pupils 
cast in oblong arms length 
the hooks have been picking their scabs 
where wolves hide in the company of men 
it said I'm lost 
I'm lost 

Now I'm lost 

Are you peaking in the red 
perforated at the neck 

What of this mongrel architect 
a broken arm of sewers set 
past present and future tense 
clipside of the pinkeye fountain 

Now I'm lost 

It's been said 
long time ago 
you'll be the first and last to know 

You'll never know
