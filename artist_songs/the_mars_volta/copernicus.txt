Close the doors...
if you want to seen her breathing again
Blur the days...
sleeping is just not an option

How come every time I walk, you crawl?
Then you cut out all the letters that make up this note

I won't, I won't give up until I find out
until I find what happened to you

The solution inhaled from the rag I hold
holds a maximum vacancy
As I held you in crippled bandages
don't you stay up and wait for me

Left dangling in the wind...

You're not there...
I poke needles in the neck of a doll
She pokes back...
asking why can't I just let her lie

How come every time I walk, you crawl?
Then you cut out all the letters that make up this note

I won't, I won't give up until I find out
until I find what happened to you

The solution inhaled from the rag I hold
holds a maximum vacancy
As I hold you in crippled bandages
don't you stay up and wait for me

Left dangling in the wind...

Don't let the days escape
what I did brings more of them
And we'll be waiting just for them

Over my dead body
over the search they lead
They won't find them anymore
[x2]

The solution inhaled from the rag I hold
holds a maximum vacancy
As I hold you in crippled bandages
don't you stay up and wait for me
[x2]

Left dangling in the wind...
