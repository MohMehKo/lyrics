Just as he hit 
The ground 
They lowered a tow that 
Stuck in his neck to the gills 
Fragments of sobriquets
riddle me this 
three half eaten corneas 
who hit the aureole 
Stalk the ground 
Stalk the ground 
You should have seen 
The curse that flew right by you 
Page of concrete 
Stained walks crutch in hobbled sway 
Auto-da-fe
A capillary hint of red 
Only this manupod 
Crescent in shape has escaped 
The house half the way 
Fell empty with teeth 
That split both his lips 
Mark these words 
One day this chalk outline will circle this city 
Was he robbed of the asphalt that cushioned his face 
A room colored charlatan 
Hid in a safe 
Stalk the ground 
Stalk the ground 
You should have seen 
The curse that flew right by you 
Page of concrete 
Stain walks crutch in hobbled sway 
Auto-da-fe
A capillary hint of red 
Only this manupod 
Crescent in shape has escaped 

Pull the pins 
Save your grace 
Mark these words 
On his grave 
[x3]

You should have seen 
The curse that flew right by you 
Page of concrete 
Stain walks crutch in hobbled sway 
Auto-da-fe 
A capillary hint of red 
Everyone knows the last toes are 
Always the coldest to go
