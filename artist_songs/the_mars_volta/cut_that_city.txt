Neonecropopulace has no reflection 
Neocaeczaristic phallic ruins 
Just east of the river denial the techs are breathing 
Welcome to this neotokyo 
Gridlocks will warn the chromlech alarms 
Bouquet of cuticles 
Landscape tantrums 
Tramontane torching the tramontane 
I've heard the mumbling of citadels shifting on this richter scale 
The alleys will flow marble intercourse 
Roil the pantheon... of subterfuge 
Tramontane torching the tramontane 
This marabout isn't untouchable 
Indentured by servitude 
Neoinfidels - let's plug them in 
Neopolygraphic, trip chords 
Centrocircuiphobia the fallacy 
Welcome to neotokyo 
Tore the wings off seraphin, fed them to the anglophiles 
In this stag caberat the bark of buildings surged, through the whipping volt abode 
Go to the lexicon you sluggard, if you will.
