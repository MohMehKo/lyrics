Just don't know the layman's terms
to call the mess you bleed
Crawls beneath the surface
sought blood through a family tree

The date's been changed
with each new phase
I'm anxious bouts of nervous

What am I without the bruises?
These switches won't come on 
What do I do to lose it?
Beneath this distress call

Let the wheels burn, let the wheels burn
Stack the tires to the neck with a body inside
[x2]

Frames of infrared
keep scrolling into focus
Scarab claimed the busy signal
with the habits that you noticed

The date's been changed
with each new phase
I'm anxious bouts of nervous

What am I without the bruises?
These switches won't come on 
What do I do to lose it?
Beneath this distress call

Let the wheels burn, let the wheels burn
Stack the tires to the neck with a body inside
[x2]

Take in all the hostages 
into the Oval Office
Draw the curtains, part their hair
and pull the trigger softly

If they have become empty
then I'll just take you with me
One driver in your motorcade
is all it takes, is all it takes

Selling graves in teflon veins
is all it takes is all it takes

What am I without the bruises?
These switches won't come on 
What do I do to lose it?
Beneath this distress call

Let the wheels burn, let the wheels burn
Stack the tires to the neck with a body inside
[x2]
