The al sirat hides behind a wardrobe of eunuchs 
Seconds collide till the padisha scandal 
The cauldrons have eyes by way of racket and vice 
A brothel's bedpan filled with demimonde lice 
Dethroned by the comatorium 
De-loused in the comatorium 
The al sirat hides behind a wardrobe of eunuchs 
Seconds collide till the padisha scandal 
Tribunals installed now that the provoste has been de-frocked 
The labefaction is venal 
My how these tricks turn themselves 
In the wake of the inquisition limbless answers inoculated 
I've caught mono bobbing for barbed wire 
These nasty sores of ataxia will feel the sting of the opiate copulation
