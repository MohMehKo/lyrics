I'll be there waiting with a hook in your neck
Is the contact you've made deficient?
And your hand will break if you touch this fence
Please them 'til they're blind with cleft lens

What have you brought for my appetite?
What have you brought for my appetite?

I'll never perish with the albino horns of a thousand young born
Will you drink from the depths of my sea?
And your hand will break if you touch this fence
Please them 'til they're blind with cleft lens

What have you brought for my appetite?
What have you brought for my appetite?

I might not make it back again
The vervain is on the rise
Maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe
They've got to open wide
Got to open wide
Might of a serpent swallowing tail
Cycle recycled and I'm next to nothing

Help me come alive
[x4]

Place your ring finger on this debt
Am I living or am I dead?
Do what thou will tell them what I've found
The steps of a ladder from a diamondback's mouth

Help me come alive
[x6]

I ain't gonna hold my breath
[x2]
