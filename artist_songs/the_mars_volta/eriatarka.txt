And there are those who 
Hadn't found the speaking so wrong 
Is it wrong 
Of Pavlov lore 
They ran rampant through the floors 
Is this wrong 
Feels so wrong 
Happened on a respirator 
In the basements 
Are they gone are they gone 
Stung the slang of a gallows bird 
Rationed a dead letter pure 
Trackmarked amoeba lands craft 
Cartwheel of scratches 
Dress the tapeworm as pet 
Tentacles smirk please 
Flinched the cocooned meat 
Infra-recon forgets 
Now there are those who find 
Comfort in the breathing 
Wrong-is it wrong 
It houses the watchful eyes 
They're panting in a pattern in droves 
Are they gone 
Happened on a respirator bet 
In the basements 
Is it gone 
Are they gone 
Stung the slang of a gallows bird 
Sanctioned a dead letter pure 
trackmarked amoeba lands craft 
cartwheel of scratches 
dress the tape worm as pets 
tentacles smirk please 
flinch the cocooned meat 
infra-recon forgets 
evaporated the fur 
because it covers them 
if you only knew the plans they had for us 
evaporated the fur 
because it covers them 
if you only knew the plans they had for us 
They used to have pulses in them 
But impulse has made them strong 
They used to have pulses in them 
But impulse has made them strong 
Evaporated the fur 
Because it covers them 
If you only knew the plans they had for us 
Trackmarked amoeba lands craft 
Cartwheel of scratches 
Dress the tapeworm as pets 
Tentacles smirk please 
Flinch the cocooned meat 
Infra-reco forgets 
gotta be a way 
Of getting out 
Are you just growing old 
Trackmarked amoeba lands craft 
Cartwheel of scratches 
Dress the tapeworm as pets
