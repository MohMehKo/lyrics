I must have crawled through your bedroom door
in a fit of jealous breath
perched upon the Bacchus foot
of your unsuspecting bed

From the blossom rags in my jackal croon
to the stems of this cinquefoil
I give to you the shrapnel
with which to sprinkle in the soil

My ether turns flesh to gravel

And all the traps in the cellar go clickety clack
cause you know I always set them for you

Yeah, I set them for you!

And all the rats in the cellar form a vermin of steps
cause you know they're gonna take me to you

Yeah, to you!

And all the traps in the cellar go clickety clack
cause you know I always set them for you

Yeah, for you!

And all the rats in the cellar form a vermin of steps
