The ocean floor is hidden 
From your viewing lens 
A depth perception 
Languished in the night 
All my life,I've been 
Sowing the wounds 
But the seeds sprout 
A lachrymal cloud 

Nino preparate 
Que vas sufrir 
Nino preparate 
Salte veneno 
Nino preparate 
Salte de aqui 
Nino preparate 
Labios temblando 
Nino preparate 
Salte veneno 
Nino preparate 
Salte de aqui 
Nino preparate 
Brincan los cuerpos 
Vas a sufrir 

My nails peel back 
When the taxidermist ruined 
Goose stepped the freckling impatience 
All the brittle tombs 
Five hundred little q's 
I'm splitting hairs to 
Match the faces 

All night I'll hunt for you 
Let me show you what I mean 
Sangre 
Sonando 
De rabia naci 

Now this train don't lie 
An abortion that survived 
A lineage of 
Bastard mastacation 
All the severed proof 
Talons scratch my suite 
These are the feathers 
That replace them 

All night I'll hunt for you 
Let me show you what I mean 
Sangre 
Sonando 
De rabia naci 

Who do you trust 
Will they feed us the womb 
Chrome the fetal mirage 
Will they feed us the womb 
I found the remnants 
Of a crescent fang 
It cleaned my wing 
Down to the bone 
Umbilical syllables 
Left to decode 
There was no cradle 
I can taste it 
Come on now 

All night I'll hunt for you 
Let me show you what I mean 
Sangre 
Sonando 
De rabia naci 

Who do you trust 
Will they feed us the womb 
Chrome the fetal mirage 
Will they feed us the womb 
Bring me this plague 
She took a drink 
Those nicotine stains 
On his every word 
My scavenger quilt 
Will only hide the truth 
Bring me 
Bring me this plague 
I count the days to find 
What was left behind 
Only these names I clutch 
Will lead me to my home 
Somehow this river marks 
A wrinkle hand in mine 
And everyday that parts 
The water into two 
Mothers and feathers start 
To drown the living proof 
I can't remember these lakes of blood 
Wrapped in a blanket 
There sweats a cut 
Who do you trust 
Will they feed us the womb 
Chrome the fetal mirage 
Will they feed us the womb
