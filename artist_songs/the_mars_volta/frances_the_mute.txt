[In Thirteen Seconds]

It’s been thirteen seconds
Since you all last said
I’ve become the apparition
You predicted for my death
You said that flirting brings you
Closer to the end
You can bathe into the water
But you’ll never get the hint
And like a stain of bricks goes
Dancing by your head
Plucked from an icebox
Grafted on my skin
[repeat]

My coat has hid the marks
Mink hits the shovel fix
Near the sway of pendulums
Boar abrasions and a kiss
She said, "I’ll never let them hurt you
I’ll never let them in
What you took from me is mine
And what is mine I’ll never give"

[Nineteen Sank, While Six Could Swim]

Mascara glass in the molar weeds
Her ash, a serpent infancy
His eye patch pussed a gap of sand
Into his shiny sedative
More and more the dirt collects
You’ll never find her body now
In a closet festered in a secret air
Blonde underneath a blackened hair
He never knew the colony
Gestated in his bed
Mingle with the carnivores, you’ve something both in common now
Until one day his wasted breath,
Swollen throat and karma debt
Set foot inside a parlor, to find her drunken by receipts
He held her by the ankle
Gutted at the nave, yes gutted and depraved
He tied a rope around her legs
And let her hang for seven days

[Five Would Grow And One Was Dead]

This never happened, but I saw you leave
And crawl into a bed of broken windows
[repeated]
