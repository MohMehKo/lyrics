I've been waiting for so long 
For someone to 
Mend all the blame 
I've been searching for so long 
For something to 
anonymous 
avenge my name 
anonymous 
avenge my name 

you came here on time 
I just hope that it's not to late 
I've seen you at night 
Biting the frost of silence 
Can you cure us of this fate 
Mock the litany in its face 
Is that you moatilliatta 

I've been waiting for so long 
For someone to 
Mend all the blame 
I've been searching for so long 
For something to

Avenge my name

Hex zero rouge 
He'll hibernate no more 
The altars run dry 
Prefect dictate your final words 
does it sting of augur truth 
was your temple left in ruins 
is that you moatilliatta 

I've been waiting for so long 
for someone to 
mend all the blame 
I've been searching for so long
For something to 
Anonymous 
Avenge my name
Anonymous 
Avenge my name 

This is the altar 
The one that you let me die in 
On your knees 
How you wept 
Much like omerta 
The quiet has shielded all intent
On the ground it appears 
Like wrath 
Avenging the lamb as bait 
In a bed of nails you made 
Who is this effigy 
Is there straw dressed in these fields 

And now it won't be long 

I've been waiting for so long 
For someone to 
Mend all the blame 
I've been searching for so long 
For something to 
Anonymous 
Avenge my name
