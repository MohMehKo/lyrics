I'm bolted from within
from long conniving heights
The hale, it makes a special sound
that always stays into the night

She tells me I'm not capable
of what they accuse me
With no remorse I stand and say
that guilt is what I plead

My devil makes me dream
like no other mortal dreams
With a blank eye corner

The only way to see him
in the tunnel where he slept
By the longest tusk of corridors
numb below the neck

In my heart

Where he keeps them in
a vault of devil daughters

When I bend and kick in form
with twilight as my guide
In every home the ghost pays gossip
you can hear them if you try

When my quill begins to squirm
from the ashes in your urn
Your deviance is anything but faithful

My devil makes me dream
like no other mortal dreams
With a blank eye corner

The only way to see him
in the tunnel where he slept
By the longest tusk of corridors
numb below the neck

In my heart

Where he keeps them in
a vault of devil daughters

Everybody 
in my dead leaves 
Don't you hide these
branches waiting 

I've been watching
you four, two me
Don't resign me
I'm not waiting

My devil makes me dream
like no other mortal dreams
With a blank eye corner

The only way to see him
in the tunnel where he slept
By the longest tusk of corridors
numb below the neck

In my heart

Where he keeps them in 
a vault of devil daughters
