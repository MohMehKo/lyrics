I've seen the only living traces flicker in the sulphur
And the ones who do believe me place your favor
Before you lay your question down there's a matter of the payment
To you I slipped on crooked sores in conclaves that you bothered

Let me be your Tourniquet Man
Let me keep you as a favor
Let me be your Tourniquet Man
Let me keep you as a favor
When I hear your fingers, they will spell my name
As I trade the faces of the holders

Let me be your Tourniquet Man
Let me keep you as a favor
Let me be your Tourniquet Man
Let me keep you as a favor

I can't diminish anymore if I choose to dissolve in you
So much we can lose
I can't diminish anymore if I choose to dissolve in you
So much we can lose
I can't diminish anymore if I choose to dissolve in you
So much we can lose
