Do you recall it's name 
As it suggested beck and call
This face and heel 
Will drag your halo through the mud 
Ash of Pompeii
Erupting in a statues dust 
Shrouded in veils 
Because these handcuffs hurt to much 
Still scalpeing these ticketless applause 
And when they drag the lake there is nothing left at all 
sutured contusion 
beyond the anthills of the dawning of this plague 
said I've lost my way 
even if this cul de sac would pay 
to reach inside a vault whatever be the cost 
sterling clear 
blackend ice 
when they drag the lake there's nothing left at all 

I've defected [x4]

beyond the anthills of the dawning of this plague 
said I've lost my way 
even if this cul de sac did pay 
beyond the anthills of, beyond the anthills of said I've lost my way 
even if you, even if you, even if you reach inside a vault whatever be the cost 
sterling clear 
blackend ice 
when they drag the lake there's nothing left at all 

(this is my last insicion 
the stitches have defected 
drag me a vessel 
coveting all you know see and hear 
this is my last incision 
the stitches have fallen off 
Sterling clear blackened ice 
And when they drag they lake ther'es nothing left at all)
I've defected [x4]
