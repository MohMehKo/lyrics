[Soft Machine cover]

I know I cannot leave this place full of memories
Things like the way they knew us all over town
We used to walk the streets together
We could be seen
Past shops where people knew us, yeah people
Yeah they knew

[Chorus:]
Memories can hang you up and haunt you all your life, you know
Get so you cannot stay and yet cannot go

I could find out where she's gone today
I feel so unhappy
Streets seem so empty now
I want you with me

[Chorus]
