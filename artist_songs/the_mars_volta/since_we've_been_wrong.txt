Do you remember how you wore that dress?
It slit my sight beneath the eyelids
Do you remember what you said to me?
What course has given you the right to stray?

And in your living tomb I'm stuck but safe
The clocks are ticking fast with every breath

Since we've been wrong
I've been part awake
Since we've been wrong
You will never, ever know me
What took you so long?
I'm not sure all the way

But my heart, it asks just one more time
Are you still a mess?

One day a rain will come to wash away
The earth that held us was no island
I have become ingrown inside this skin
I'll find a way out through those eyelids

And all the days become a cast away
I seem to think I don't belong here

Since we've been wrong
I've been part awake
Since we've been wrong
you will never, ever know me
What took you so long?
I'm not sure all the way

But my heart, it asks just one more time
Are you still a mess?

I don't belong here, I shouldn't stay
What falls inside me grows empty
The walls between us will never break
Just seal it shut, it grows empty

Since we've been wrong
I've been part awake
Since we've been wrong
you will never, ever know me
What took you so long?
I'm not sure all the way

Since we've been wrong
I've been part awake
Since we've been wrong
You will never, ever know me
What took you so long?
I'm not sure all the way

But my heart, it asks just one more time
Are you still a mess?
