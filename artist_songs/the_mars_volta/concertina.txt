In denial 
Who will come clean all the ravenous debris 
In disguise 
Sideswiped by penance cerecloth sentencing 

This scapegrace will pay my barking harangue... are you listening? 

On the 14th you stole 
What hasn't grown old 

In denial 
File this under a bridge that he can't leave 

Will those shadows glare 
From that blank-rimmed stare 
In a vacancy hush 

Aunque me dejastes ahogado en el mar, acuestate en la tierra de la realidad de tu sueno, 
Manos me recuerdo solamente a ti te odio yo ya me voy

In denial 
Who will clean up all this ravenous debris 
In denial 
File this under a bridge that he can't leave 

And the storyville 
Sawbones couldn't tell 
The prescription to mend 
All the broken wills 
In the white lie wards
Don't you pretend 

Tangled in thorns 
To walk unborn 

And this debt will collect
All the sickness that infects

Suddenly drives up
Sentencing valley
Count all the handshakes
Syringe overflows

Tangled in thorns 
To walk unborn 

And this debt will collect
All the sickness that you infect
And this debt will collect
All the sickness you infect

And this debt
