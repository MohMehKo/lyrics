[a. TARANTISM]

You can't bend your crooked arms or fold your punctured proof 
The air is growing cold and there's nothing you can do 
Soon there'll be no gauze, inside the confessional 
Only rows of crows, defrocking every breath 

And one day you'll remember 
Behind the melting cones, 
I said, one day you'll remember 
Behind the melting cones, 
You always had a family 
In the burial of your home. 
In the burial of your home. 

Night forever more
Night forever more
Night forever more
Night forever more
Night forever more

And I'll peel back all of my skin 
I'll peel back and let it all run 
Peel back all of my skin 
Peel back and let it all run 
Peel back all of my skin

[b. PLANT A NAIL IN THE NAVEL STREAM]

[Instrumental]

[c. FAMINEPULSE]

Brick by brick, the night eclipsed 
Pricked by the cuticle thorns, 
Dried the sleep on nursery slits 
Into this life I'm born 
Havens just a scab away, 
I'd like to see you after just one taste 

Sink your teeth into the flesh of midnight 
Night forever more, 
Let them see it has begun 
The others I've become

[d. MULTIPLE SPOUSE WOUNDS]

No there's no light, 
In the darkest of your furthest reaches 
No there's no light, 
In the darkest of your furthest reaches 
No there's no light, 
In the darkest of your furthest reaches 
No there's no light, 
In the darkest of your furthest reaches 

No there's no light, no there's no time 
You ain't got nothing, your life was just a lie.
No there's no light, no there's no time 
You ain't got nothing, your life was just a lie.

[e. SARCOPHAGI]

The ocean floor is hidden from your viewing lens 
A depth perception languished in the night 
All my life, I've been sowing the wounds 
But the seeds sprout a lachrymal cloud
