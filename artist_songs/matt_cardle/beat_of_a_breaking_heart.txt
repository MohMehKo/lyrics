Forgive my heart, forgive my mind
They don’t understand
That I have no reason to lie
Could run but there’s nowhere to hide
Take me as I am

I can hear
The beat of a breaking heart
Soaking in tears but this time I’ve gone too far

I need your soul, I need your grace
'Cause you see through my disguise
I still got your taste in my mouth
I still feel your hands on my skin
And as I close my eyes

I can hear
The beat of a breaking heart
Soaking in tears but this time I’ve gone too far
And maybe tonight
I’ll fight not to fall apart
How are we here when it’s just the start?
