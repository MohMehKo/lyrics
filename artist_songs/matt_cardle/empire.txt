Losing love, losing my faith,
The only thing she left me was all of my mistakes
The hardest time, the darkest place
Through a crack in the window, I see your face
Shining, golden

Oh my love, you lift me up, oh my love
You come along and you fill my heart
Replace my faith
With a blinding light from a perfect place
And with all the love, all the love, all the love,
Is more than enough, to build an empire
Build an empire

Heal these eyes, they’ve seen too much
I’m burned out and broken, come and lift me up
Get me out of here, take me away
All that I have left, is a heart that needs to be saved
Shining, golden

Oh my love, you lift me up, oh my love
You come along and you fill my heart
Replace my faith
With a blinding light from a perfect place
And with all the love, all the love, all the love,
Is more than enough, to build an empire
Build an empire

Losing my heart, losing my faith, losing myself, now I’m unafraid
In your light I find myself again

Oh my love, you lift me up, oh my love
You come along and you fill my heart
Replace my faith
With a blinding light from a perfect place
And with all the love, all the love, all the love,
Is more than enough, to build an empire
Build an empire
