I was blessed
With an angel
But I kicked her to the floor
And it makes no sense
Little angel
Can I get you back once more

It’s chewing on my heart again
Make it stop, let’s start again

If I could be somebody else
I’d be somebody you love
Give you every little bit of my heart
Stitch you where you’re coming apart
Cause you’re somebody I love
Cause you’re somebody to me
But never was it ever enough
I just wrapped my chops around the fact that, oh
Your somebody ain’t me

I’m a tidy mess
Been a bad dog
Now I’m scratching at the door
Hell, give me house arrest
Train this animal
Teach me how to hide the claws
It’s chewing on my heart again
Make it stop, let’s start again

If I could be somebody else
I’d be somebody you love
Give you every little bit of my heart
Stitch you where you’re coming apart
Cause you’re somebody I love
Cause you’re somebody to me
But never was it ever enough
I just wrapped my chops around the fact that, oh
Your somebody ain’t me
