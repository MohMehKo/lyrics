Come on, summer lovin'
Come on, summer love

I'm so sick of this winter
My faith has frozen up
I need a new heart
I need a new home
I need somebody to heal
This broken old bones

But when I run 
The siren sings my name

Oh, I'm in chains
I'm a sucker for the pain
Nothing will change
'Til I learn to break away

Oh, I'm in chains
But I'll never feel ashamed
When I'm loving you
'Cause I'm loving you

Come on, self respect
Come on, self control

Got me so conditioned
I need to be absolved
I'm picking up sticks
I'm picking up stones

She smiles 
And all that she knows
They'll never be thrown
And as I run I'm falling for her games

Oh, I'm in chains
I'm a sucker for the pain
Nothing will change
'Til I learn to break away

Oh, I'm in chains
But I'll never feel ashamed
When I'm loving you
'Cause I'm loving you

No shame
You got me choking on your chain
No shame
You got me choking on your chain
No shame
You got me choking on your chain

No shame
I'm just your sucker
But when I run
A siren sings my name

Oh, I'm in chains
I'm a sucker for the pain
Nothing will change
'Til I learn to break away

Oh, I'm in chains
So why won't you let me 
RUN?

Oh, I'm in chains
I'm a sucker for the pain
Nothing will change
'Til I learn to break away

Oh, I'm in chains
But I'll never feel ashamed
When I'm loving you
'Cause, baby, I'm loving you
