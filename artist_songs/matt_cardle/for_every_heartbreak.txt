When I bend my mind I find, it’s crystal clear
When I stand alone I know, I have no fear
I feel sick inside at times, I feel you near
Pain is kind enough to remind me, I don’t need you here

I was coming undone, now I’m coming up swinging
Seemed like the end but it’s only the beginning
When there’s no hurt, there’s no healing
For every heartbreak there’s a reason

Twixt the broken hearts is a love we can recover
But the crime suggests I could think no less of her
You were my best friend, my leader and my lover
I could have laid with you till the end, like no other

I was coming undone, now I’m coming up swinging
Seemed like the end but it’s only the beginning
When there’s no hurt, there’s no healing
For every heartbreak there’s a reason
