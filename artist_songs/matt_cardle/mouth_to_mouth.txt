I can't feel
I can't breath
Condition critical
I can't feel my heart beneath
And my blood it runs so cold

No sign of life

I know what's happening to me
I don't need a doctor
You can give me what I need
In my heart and in my soul

Before I flatline

(Save me)

I'm going down
It's an emergency
I need you now
Won't you rescue me?

Without your kiss
No, I'm not gonna make it
Won't you help me out?
I need a little bit of
Mouth to mouth

Won't you help me out?
I need a little 
Mouth to mouth

I am man not machine
I am physical
Won't you put your lips on me?
Won't you pull my body close?

And bring me to life!

(Save me)

I'm going down
It's an emergency
I need you now
Won't you rescue me?

Without your kiss
No, I'm not gonna make it
Won't you help me out?
I need a little bit of
Mouth to mouth

Won't you help me out?
I need a little 
Mouth to mouth

(SOS)
(Save me)

Only you can save me!

Won't you help me out?
Won't you help me out?

I'm going down
It's an emergency
I need you now
Won't you rescue me?

Without your kiss
No, I'm not gonna make it
Won't you help me out?
I need a little bit of
Mouth to mouth

I'm going down
It's an emergency
I need you now
Won't you rescue me?

Without your kiss
No, I'm not gonna make it
Won't you help me out?
I need a little bit of
Mouth to mouth

Won't you help me out?
I need a little 
Mouth to mouth
