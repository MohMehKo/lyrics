Don’t say it’s over
Don’t breathe a word
How was I so oblivious?
I didn’t see how we got so deep down

When we were walking on water for so long
I didn’t notice the waves crashing over
I thought we were sailing somewhere
When did we start going under?

Now I see your colours
And now I hear your truths
I need something to pull us outta here
If we could get back up to the surface
Tell me could it be

Like we were walking on water for so long
I didn’t notice the waves crashing over
I thought we were sailing somewhere
When did we start going under, under?

'Cause you made me wanna fight
'Cause I found something to believe in
You made me who I am
And it’s so hard to see how
We’re so deep down

When we were walking on water for so long
I didn’t notice the waves crashing over
I thought we were sailing somewhere
When did we start going under?
