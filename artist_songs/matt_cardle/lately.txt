Too long staring at the same page
Through love and through rage
I wanna run, I wanna stay the same

Get loose, get lucky, get laid
We have dreams, they fade
I wanna run, I wanna stay the same

Lately, it won’t come together, it won’t come together
But my baby, it’s gonna get better, it’s gonna get better

Too long putting on a brave face, but
inside we can’t change
I wanna run, I wanna stay the same

Stand down, know your place
A bitter pill I won’t taste
I wanna run, I wanna stay the same

Lately, it won’t come together, it won’t come together
But my baby, it’s gonna get better, it’s gonna get better
