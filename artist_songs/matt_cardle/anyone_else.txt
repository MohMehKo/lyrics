Get up I’m ready baby, for a little more if you’re feeling it
On top go steady baby, are you ready, are you ready,
I know you’re not my lady, oh but I don’t care ‘cos I’m feelin’ it
I know it’s pretty crazy but I want it and you want it

I can’t stand to be with anyone else
Can’t stand it
Can’t stand it

To make a little love to you was all I ever really needed
I don’t wanna * these girls they only bring me down
I wanna look into your eyes and find a way to stay forever, forever
‘Cos I can’t stand to be with anyone else

Get up, get out now baby
You’re not the one I’m not feeling it
You don’t swing the way she swayed me,
Never ready, never ready
To put it pretty plainly, I miss the love I miss making it
I miss lying with my lady
Come and save me, come and save me

I can’t stand to be with anyone else
Can’t stand it
Can’t stand it

To make a little love to you was all I ever really needed
I don’t wanna * these girls they only bring me down
I wanna look into your eyes and find a way to stay forever, forever
‘Cos I can’t stand to be with anyone else
