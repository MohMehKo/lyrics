Some people walk blinded to the light
Head down just dragging their shadow behind
Some people don't wanna seem to ever change
But it's people like you
Who make it through the rain

And if you don't break
It's only gonna make you stronger
Only gonna take you closer

All the things in this life
That you thought you just couldn't bear
It's the pressure inside
Makes the diamond that's shining there

All the pain and the heartache
Can break you and chafe you like clay
Now you've come through the fire
And that makes you Porcelain

Porcelain

Some people make a diamond out of glass
Some people still win all though they finish last
Some people shine through the darkest night alone
Yet there's people like you
Who always gonna see the dawn

All the things in this life
That you thought you just couldn't bear
It's the pressure inside
Makes the diamond that's shining there

All the pain and the heartache
Can break you and chafe you like clay
Now you've come through the fire
And that makes you Porcelain

Porcelain 
You're Porcelain

All the things in this life
That you thought you just couldn't bear
It's the pressure inside
Makes the diamond that's shining there

All the pain and the heartache
Can break you and chafe you like clay
Now you've come through the fire
And that makes you Porcelain

And if you don't break
It's only gonna make you stronger
It's only gonna take you closer

Now you're Porcelain

I won't break
Just make me stronger
Just take me closer
