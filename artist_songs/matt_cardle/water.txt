Snow fall on the tree tops, the streets are bare
Bright lights in the windows, and up the stairs
All of your silence, and all of your songs
I still hear the choir, but you are gone

Can’t go back
Can’t fight this

Water, water
Teardrops are falling like rain
Brother, daughter
Still I hear you calling my name
Oh, I see your light
In the water, for all my life

Walking on a tight rope
Coming undone
‘Cos you were my hero
When I was young
We live but we never know
Were lost in the wind
A million candles just flickering
Can’t go back, can’t fight this

Water, water
Teardrops are falling like rain
Brother, daughter
Still I hear you calling my name
Oh, I see your light
In the water, for all my life

Oh, lifted high
Let me lay down at your side
Here I stay
Until your soul comes back to mine

Water, water
Teardrops are falling like rain
Brother, daughter
Still I hear you calling my name
Oh, I see your light
In the water, for all my life
