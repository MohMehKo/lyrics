Flickin’ channels in my hotel room
On a trip I always thought I’d take with you
My heart was lifted by a telephone ring
I thought you’d changed your mind
And say it's true

If only, if only
I’d seized the moment when you loved me
You’d be here with me

Reflections of a wasted love
You don’t know what you’ve lost until she’s given up
I had to lose you to learn
You don’t know what you’ve lost until she’s gone

Never thought that you’d have gone this far
Guessed I’d always have just one more chance
I never thought that you could break my heart
If only I could change our circumstance

If only, if only
I’d seized the moment when you loved me
You’d be here with me

Reflections of a wasted love
You don’t know what you’ve got until she’s given up
I had to lose you to learn
The clock's been tickin’, the clock's been tickin’
You don’t know what you’ve lost until she’s gone

Maybe it's all too late, 
(If you're never gonna tell me why, then I’m never gonna say goodbye)
Maybe it’s all too late, 
(If you're never gonna tell me why, then I’m never gonna say goodbye)

Reflections of a wasted love
You don’t know what you’ve lost until she’s given up
I had to lose you to learn
You don’t know what you’ve lost until she’s given up
Reflections of a wasted love
'Cause the clock's been tickin’, the clock's been tickin’
You don’t know what you’ve lost until she’s gone
