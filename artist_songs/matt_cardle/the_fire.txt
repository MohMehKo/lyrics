You held me over the fire
Why d’you have to prove it to yourself
I told you, nobody here is a liar
Would you burn me till there’s nothing left
So put me out, out
And while you push I’m trying to figure out, out, out

Just why you keep on begging, begging
Time and time again, to hear I love you, love you
Darling don’t you understand I do, I do, no doubt
Now I’m begging, begging, we gotta put this fire out

You take it down to the wire
You won’t surrender but I won’t let you fall, it’s your fight
Your courage I admire
You got my life, seems you don’t want it at all
You just put me down, down
And while you push I’m trying to figure out, out, out

Just why you keep on begging, begging
Time and time again, to hear I love you, love you
Darling don’t you understand I do, I do, no doubt
Now I’m begging, begging, we gotta put this fire out
