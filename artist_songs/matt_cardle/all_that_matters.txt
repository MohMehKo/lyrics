If you leave my life
Drown my head
I will understand
I'm a breaking man
Wont you read my mind
Hear my plans
Then you'd understand
You'd understand

But I don't need to tell you
Cause you already know
You can be yourself baby
But I just pray someday you'll find everything you need
Believe me

I just pray somebody loves you
Somebody somewhere
Cause I can't hear you cry
Not one second more
It's killing me

I just pray somebody loves you
Somebody somewhere
It's not the only thing that matters to me
The only thing that matters at all

I just pray somebody loves you
Somebody somewhere
It's not the only thing that matters to me
The only thing that matters at all
