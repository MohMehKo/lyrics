You tell me that you want me
You're thinking that you walk back in my life again
Saying you need me
But I've been hearing stories from mistaken friends

When someone said you sold me out
You sold me out
I tried to shut it out
But it's too late

All those tears I watched you fake
Thinking I was doing you wrong
And now I hear it's my mistake
'Cause you were never sleeping alone
When you were my girl
When you were my girl

I told you I was sorry
How could you lie so easily right to the end?
You wanna hold me
But I don't find it that easy to pretend

When someone said you sold me out
You sold me out
I tried to shut it out
But it's too late

All those tears I watched you fake
Thinking I was doing you wrong
And now I hear it's my mistake
'Cause you were never sleeping alone
When you were my girl
When you were my girl
When you were my girl
When you were mine

All those tears I watched you fake
Thinking I was doing you wrong
And now I hear it's my mistake
'Cause you were never sleeping alone
When you were my girl

All those tears I watched you fake
Thinking I was doing you wrong
And now I hear it's my mistake
'Cause you were never sleeping alone
When you were my girl
When you were my girl
When you were my girl
