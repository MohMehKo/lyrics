And now we're alone
Oh Baby, can I be open?
I think I'm ready for another one

Swallow your words
Because too many get spoken
And I don't wanna hear another one

So gimme your lips
And gimme the rest
Dig in with your hips
And put your hands on my chest

[?]
She's telling me

Baby, take me
I wanna feel your kind of love 
Tonight I want you on top
Giddy up!
I wanna get deeper in your love

I wanna feel your
Love

Never too much
'Cause I'm a little bit [?]
Can't help it
I can feel it comin' on

Never enough
So come on, feed me
Don't speak
'Cause any word I'm hanging on

So gimme your lips
And gimme the rest
Dig in with your hips
And put your hands on my chest

And now she's telling me

Baby, take me
I wanna feel your kind of love 
Tonight I want you on top
Giddy up!
I wanna get deeper in your love

She's saying

Baby, take me
I wanna feel your kind of love 
Tonight I want you on top
Giddy up!
I wanna get deeper in your love

I wanna feel your
Love

Everytime she breaks my body
And she bends my mind
Everytime she hits me
With that same old line

She said

Baby, take me
I wanna feel your kind of love 
Tonight I want you on top
Giddy up!
I wanna get deeper in your love

She said

Baby, take me
I wanna feel your kind of love 
Tonight I want you on top
Giddy up!
I wanna get deeper in your love

I wanna feel your
Love
