Use your eyes, oh father
'Cause I had a dream last night
I saw her body broke, still and cold where she lay
And it was all for nothing
This love I gave

And I pray you keep her safe
Bring her home, keep harm away
And I pray, don’t let me down
Bring her back 'cause I need her now
I pray, someone else can take her place
Don’t make it all for nothing
This love we made

She’s my best friend, oh mother
No other woman could turn my eye, drag me away
With the blessing comes the worry, and I worry
Don’t make it all for nothing
The love we made

And I pray you keep her safe
Bring her home, keep harm away
And I pray, don’t let me down
Bring her back 'cause I need her now
I pray, someone else can take her place
Don’t make it all for nothing
This love we made

Falling in love is like playing with fire
Pulling me down but it’s takin’ me higher
I know it’s my fault and I’m asking for favours
I needed a knife but you gave me the razor

I pray you keep her safe
Bring her home, keep harm away
And I pray, don’t let me down
Bring her back 'cause I need her now
I pray, someone else can take her place
Don’t make it all for nothing
This love we made
Don’t make it all for nothing
This love we made
