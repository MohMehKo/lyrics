Truth, dares, girls for which I never really cared
Affairs to forget
A search for ends that never really met

If I could only find this feeling
And find a love beyond this dream
It’s never been so clear that

I need someone to pull me under
I need someone, I start to wonder
Will I ever stop skipping like a stone
My heart keeps skipping like a stone
On the calmest river keep on
And I’ll never break the surface
‘Till it feels like home

Truth, dares, lust, affairs, girls for which I never cared
Success, deceit, lies, defeat making ends that never meet
I’ve been found, lost, paid the cost, a skipping stone that gathered moss
Trying to keep my heart above the water

If I could only find this feeling
And find a love beyond this dream
It’s never been so clear that

I need someone to pull me under
I need someone, I start to wonder
Will I ever stop skipping like a stone
My heart keeps skipping like a stone
On the calmest river keep on
And I’ll never break the surface
‘Till it feels like home
‘Till it feels like home

I need someone to pull me under
I need someone, I start to wonder
Will I ever stop skipping like a stone
My heart keeps skipping like a stone
On the calmest river keep on
And I’ll never break the surface
‘Till it feels like home
