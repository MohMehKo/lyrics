I'm here in your shadow
Broken on the floor
It will never be
The way it was before
I think you feel it, too
I'm not over you

When I look in the mirror
It's difficult to believe
That the man in the mirror
Staring back at me
Is blinded by the truth
I'm not over you

I'm not over you
I'm not over you
I tried to fight it 
But I know there's just no use
I'm not over you

If you need somebody
While you're playing solitaire
Just let me be that body
Even though you're in repair
I think you feel it, too
I'm not over you

I'm not over you
No, I'm not over you
I tried to fight it 
But I know there's just no use
I'm not over you

I should have been the one 
To make you happy
But I didn't pass the test
Just like all the rest

And every time I cry
I hear you laughing
Though I wish you all the best
It doesn't hurt any less

I'm missing you

I'm not over you
No, I'm not over you
No, I'm not over you
I'm not over you

And you feel it
