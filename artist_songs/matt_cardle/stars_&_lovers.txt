If all the tears could drown a fire
The stars would fall and time would stop
If I could reach a little higher
If Jupiter was close enough, ohh

I lost my place, I found the answer
I heard it on, the radio
If I return and take my chances
If only I could let her know

My heart is open and the skies on fire
I hear the drum and, I hear the choir
The universe it was made for us and
Oh oh, the stars and the lovers
A universe, made for us and
Oh oh, the stars and the lovers
So let go, hold onto each other

If I could run a million hours
And hold the oceans, in my hands
If I could have one superpower
It would be to make you understand

My heart is open and the skies on fire
I hear the drum and, I hear the choir
The universe it was made for us and
Oh oh, the stars and the lovers
A universe, made for us and
Oh oh, the stars and the lovers
So let go, hold onto each other

I lost my place, I found the answer
I heard it on, the radio
If only I could let her know

My heart is open and the skies on fire
I hear the drum and, I hear the choir
The universe it was made for us and
Oh oh, the stars and the lovers
A universe, made for us and
Oh oh, the stars and the lovers
So let go, hold onto each other
So let go, hold onto each other
