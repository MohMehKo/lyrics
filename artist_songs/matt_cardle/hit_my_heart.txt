If you can find heaven
I show you how to lose it
How to build a castle
And take it down brick by brick

I'm sick of running in circles
Living by the moonlight
Waiting for the moment
When my blues aren't black and white

So come on baby, show your face
Everybody knows your name
Show me just a little grace

You got me on my knees
So lift me up, love
'Cause my heart
Is begging for a beat
Come, and get it started
Love, love, hit my heart
Come, a little harder

'Cause my heart
Is begging for a beat
Come, and get it started
Love, love, hit my heart
Come, a little harder

I'm sending out a signal
The only way to lose it
Is come a little closer
And tear me up bit by bit

So come on baby, show your face
Everybody knows your name
Show me just a little grace

You got me on my knees
So lift me up, love
'Cause my heart
Is begging for a beat
Come, and get it started
Love, love, hit my heart
Come, a little harder

'Cause my heart
Is begging for a beat
Come, and get it started
Love, love, hit my heart
Come, a little harder

You got me on my knees
I just need a little bit of your love
So lift me up

Get me to my feet
I just need a little bit of your love
So lift me up

You got me on my knees
So lift me up, love
'Cause my heart
Is begging for a beat
Come, and get it started
Love, love, hit my heart
Come, a little harder

'Cause my heart
Is begging for a beat
Come, and get it started
Love, love, hit my heart
Come, a little harder

So lift me up, love
'Cause my heart
Is begging for a beat
Come, and get it started
Love, love, hit my heart
Come, a little harder

'Cause my heart
Is begging for a beat
Come, and get it started
Love, love, hit my heart
Come, a little harder

You got me on my knees
I just need a little bit of your love
So lift me up

Get me to my feet
I just need a little bit of your love
So lift me up
