It's where I am, it's where you are
Heal the cuts and wear the scars
We're wrecking balls in camouflage
The trouble is this trouble's ours

Like rebels falling into [?]
His devil hands on her angel face 
We can't run and hide from who we are
The trouble is this trouble's ours
The trouble is this trouble is ours

Oh, love
There's no doubt
It's real love
Trouble please, don't take her now
Trouble please, don't take her now

Sat alone through silent nights
Back to back in silent fights
With heavy words and heavy hearts
The trouble is this trouble's ours
The trouble is this trouble is ours

Oh, love
There's no doubt
It's real love
Trouble please, don't take her now
Trouble please, don't take her now

Sat alone through silent nights
Back to back in silent fights
We run and hide from who we are

The trouble is this trouble is ours
Trouble please, don't take her now

The trouble is this trouble is ours
Trouble please, don't take her now

The trouble is this trouble is ours

Oh, love
There's no doubt
It's real love
Trouble please, don't take her now
Trouble please, don't take her now
Trouble please, don't take her now
