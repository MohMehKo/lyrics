Here tonight and gone tomorrow
Now I’m coming back down again
The truths a bitter pill to swallow
Did I really mean all the things I’d said?

I guess I never realised, that the story had three sides
I guess I never realised, till I saw you in the sunlight
And you leave me falling

Faithless, we’ve taken it too far
The guilt weighs heavy on my heart
What they don’t know still hurts somehow
And is running away with my conscience now
Love I shouldn’t have let you down

The moment lay a path to follow
And I took it all the way
I stole, I lied, I begged and borrowed
Don’t let it come round again

I guess I never realised, that the story had three sides
I guess I never realised, till I saw you in the sunlight
And you leave me falling

Faithless, we’ve taken it too far
The guilt weighs heavy on my heart
What they don’t know still hurts somehow
And is running away with my conscience now
Love I shouldn’t have let you down

All the bridges that I burned
All the lessons that I've learned
All the tables that I turned
Have left me falling

Faithless, we’ve taken it too far
The guilt weighs heavy on my heart
What they don’t know still hurts somehow
And is running away with my conscience now
Love I shouldn’t have let you down

I’m faithless, we’ve taken it too far
The guilt weighs heavy on my heart
What they don’t know, it hurts somehow
Running away with my conscience now
Love I shouldn’t have let you down
