You’ve taken all we ever had
We’ll never get it back
Traded love for something else
Something I guess I didn’t have
You can dream in gold
But you’ll wake up penniless

Just because I’m broke
And you have my heart in a million pieces
Doesn’t make you a millionaire
You sold out, your cashing in
Oh you silly girl
And one day you’ll realise
I could have given you the world
You can dream in gold
But you’ll wake up penniless

Just because I’m broke
And you have my heart in a million pieces,
doesn’t make you a millionaire
And just because your gone
And you say I gave you a million reasons
Doesn’t make you a millionaire

If you come back down
Don’t be afraid to fall
And if you leave, promise me
You won’t take it all
You won’t take it all

You got a million pieces
But your no millionaire
