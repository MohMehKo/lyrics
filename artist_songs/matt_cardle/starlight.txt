Hearts are racing at the speed of light
Eyes are opening and rolling right
Sinking feeling it’s almost like
It wouldn’t matter if we died tonight

We are beautiful
Breakable
We’re gonna lose it all to the light

'Cause in time, we all burn as one, in the sun, in the sky
Like a shooting star, it’s just who we are

Pushin', pushin', pullin', movin' on
A sense of freedom we’ve been hanging on
I’ve cut the chord and now it won’t be long
Before we find out where it’s coming from

We are beautiful
Breakable
We’re gonna lose it all to the light

'Cause in time, we all burn as one, in the sun, in the sky
Like a shooting star, it’s just who we are

We are beautiful
Breakable
We’re gonna lose it all to the light

'Cause in time, we all burn as one, in the sun, in the sky
Like a shooting star, it’s just who we are
