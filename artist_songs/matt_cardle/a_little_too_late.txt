In crimson skies
I hear the devil cry
I'm done borrowing time
You went and cross the line
Must've lost your mind

We don't matter now
Forget it
It's a little too late now
'Cause you're getting away
Getting away from love
So don't keep running from the truth
It's a little too late now
It's a little too late now

We're gonna sink in a sea
To a place of tears
When you're spinning that way up
Tell me what are you trying to prove?
No matter what hand you play, you lose

It just don't matter now
Forget it
It's a little too late now
'Cause you're getting away
Getting away from love
So don't keep running from the truth
It's a little too late now

I'm taking it back again
The heart that was in your hands
But I will never forgive 
The way you can pretend 
Just feed me another lie
'Cause you played me for the last time

It's a little too late now
'Cause you're getting away
Getting away from love
So don't keep running from the truth
It's a little too late now
