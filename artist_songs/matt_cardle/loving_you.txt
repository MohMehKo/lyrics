Leave your door open
I wanna come over
The night
Is only young

I wanna get under
Your body
Take you over
Come undone

But why do we only give it up
Give it up in the dark
Cause I can't help thinking it's not enough
It's not enough for this heart

Who do you think about when I'm not with you?
Does somebody hold you when you let me go?
You can't hide, you can't lie
Cos baby I'm loving, loving, loving you

I could tell myself that I don't need you
I could try to run away from the truth
I can't hide, I can't lie
Cos baby I'm loving, loving, loving you

My door is open
Come on over
The night
Is still young

I wanna get over
Your body
Take you under
Come undone

But why do we only give it up
Give it up in the dark
And I can't help thinking it's not enough
It's not enough for this heart

Who do you think about when I'm not with you?
Does somebody hold you when you let me go?
You can't hide, you can't lie
Cos baby I'm loving, loving, loving you

I could tell myself that I don't need you
I could try to run away from the truth
I can't hide, I can't lie
Cos baby I'm loving, loving, loving you

Would it change if I asked you to stay
If I pulled would it push you away
But it's just the chance I'll take
Cause I want your loving

Who do you think about when I'm not with you?
Does somebody hold you when you let me go?
You can't hide, you can't lie
Cos baby I'm loving, loving, loving you

I could tell myself that I don't need you
I could try to run away from the truth
I can't hide, I can't lie
Cos baby I'm loving, loving, loving you
Baby I'm loving, loving, loving you
Baby I'm loving, loving, loving you
