I’ve been sleeping, with both eyes wide open
I’ve been waiting for a moment like this
Painted these faces, over and over,
Seen these same places, so many times before
Just leaves me wanting more, now I’m standing at your door

All the fears, wasted years, pay no mind to it,
Now it’s clear, Now I’m here,
For all the time that I used to care
Now I’m anyone, anywhere

I want love, I want freedom,
I wrote the books but I don’t read them at all
When the writings on the wall

All the fears, wasted years, pay no mind to it,
Now it’s clear, Now I’m here,
For all the time that I used to care
Now I’m anyone, anywhere

Whatever you want to feel, it’s alright
You’re whoever you want to be here tonight

All the fears, wasted years, pay no mind to it,
Now it’s clear, Now I’m here,
For all the time that I used to care
Now I’m anyone, anywhere
