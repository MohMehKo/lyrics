It's a kick in the head so close your eyes
Some say it's dead, but we're alive
And it has no use anymore

It's a losing game that I won't play
I know full well, it isn't here to stay
It has no use anymore

Just get a hold of your heart and set it on fire
You don't need it now, you'll be alright cause

Did you think it would hold you?
Did you think it would carry you?
Did you think it would save you?
Did you think it would see you through?
It's only love, it's only love

Don't let it push you to your knees
You don't have to fall, lean on me
It has no use anymore

Just get a hold of your heart and set it on fire
You don't need it now, you'll be alright 'cause

Did you think it would hold you?
Did you think it would carry you?
Did you think it would save you?
Did you think it would see you through?
It's only love, it's only love

Did you think it would hold you?
Did you think it would carry you?
Did you think it would save you?
Did you think it would see you through?
It's only love, it's only love

It won't hold you
It won't carry you
It won't save you
It won't see you through
It's only love, it's only love

Did you think it would hold you?
Did you think it would carry you?
Did you think it would save you?
Did you think it would see you through?
It's only love, it's only love

It won't hold you
It won't carry you
It won't save you
It won't see you through
It's only love, it's only love
