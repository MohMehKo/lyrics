I was thinking about my situation
Like I know you do the same
But now the sun is rising and i feel like smiling
Won't you help me once again

We all go through this
Got to make it fit
I know you feel the same as me
Did it fit this way
When you see my face
Won't you help me babe
So low, so low, I'm low
Low, so low, so low, and low

I see that things are changing
I'm just sitting thinking about my life and how it changed
But now the sun is rising makes me feel like smiling
Won't you help me once again

We all go through this
Got to make it fit
Won't you help me babe
So low, so low, I'm low
Low, so low, so low, and low

Did it fit this way
When you see my face
Won't you help me babe
So low, so low, so low, and low
