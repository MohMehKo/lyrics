I still believe
I still believe in us
But it's not you
It's me I trust
It's off the scale
It's into nothingness
Cause you're too frail
And you're getting worse

Ohhh
What am I?
What a sound
Why'd it take so long?

Forget
All you know
Feel the burn
Why'd it take so long?

Back to back
And I can smell your fear
Stand your ground
And know that I am here
Face to face
And stare me in the eye
Look at me
And tell me what am I?

Ohhh
What am I?
What a sound
Why'd it take so long?
Forget
All you know
Feel the burn
Why'd it take so long?

You've held on to me all this time
And it's all because you're at the end of the line
You've held on to me all this time
And it's all because you're at the end of the line
You've held on to me all this time
And it's all because you're at the end of the line
You've held on to me all this time
And it's all because you're at the end of the line

Ohhh
What am I?
What a sound1
Why'd it take so long?
Forget
All you know
Feel the burn
Why'd it take so long?

Ohhh
What am I?
What a sound
Why'd it take so long?
Forget
All you know
Feel the burn
Why'd it take so long?

Ohhh
What am I?
What a sound
Why'd it take so long?
