No big enough streets to revenge
Metal terrain won’t stop me
You found peace intolerable
You’re gonna burn this place to the ground
For you, success comes at a high price
For me, it is a journey
I hate to be beaten, but how do you win
When the opposition is yourself

We get up, we get up, we make history
We get up, we get up, we make history
We get up, we get up, we make history

We get up, we get up, we make history
We get up, we get up, we make history
We get up, we get up, we make history

You know, the guilt keeps chipping away
At what I have left of conscience
I need you to tackle the pain
Don’t let the weight of the world drag you down

For most of us it’s physical
I have not discovered
The ways to be taken along some road
'Cause the opposition is myself

We get up, we get up, we make history
We get up, we get up, we make history
We get up, we get up, we make history

We get up, we get up, we make history
We get up, we get up, we make history
We get up, we get up, we make history
