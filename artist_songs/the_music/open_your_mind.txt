I thought life was supposed to be
A lesson in itself
But each day I find it so much harder
Believe in what you feel inside
Cos there's no wrong and there's no right
Everyday I find it so much harder

What do you see when you close your eyes
How do you feel when you sleep at night
Maybe it's time you opened up your mind

Open your mind
Maybe it's time
Open your mind
Maybe it's time

So many times I've tried to find
A reason to this life
But every day I find it so much harder

What do you see when you close your eyes
How do you feel when you sleep at night
Maybe it's time you opened up your mind

How can I leave my past behind
How do I live the days gone by
Maybe it's time I opened up my mind

Open your mind
Maybe it's time
Open your mind
Maybe it's time

What do you see when you close your eyes
How do you feel when you sleep at night
Maybe it's time you opened up your eyes

Open your mind
Maybe it's time
Open your mind
Maybe it's time
Open your mind
Open your mind
Open your mind
Open your mind
Yeah
