I look around
And everywhere I see
People chasing a dream
But how long will it last?
Life will
Life will sink it's teeth
Facing reality
Is something we don't do

Ohh
Lately
Life has been a little crazy
I don't really know what's happening
I just wanna make it right

Ohh
Chasing
Chasing down the same old roads
Tryin' to find some inspiration
Why's it always seem so hard?

It's come to
Staring life in the eye
Standing up to the fight
But if you break it's over baby
Time will
Time will heal the pain
Like a needle straight through the vein
But if you break it's a cold, sharp entry

Lately
Life has been a little crazy
I don't really know what's happening
I just wanna make it right

Ohh
Chasing
Chasing down the same old roads
Tryin' to find some inspiration
Why's it always seem so hard?

Chasing
Chasing down the same old roads
Tryin' to find some inspiration
Why's it always seem so haaaaaard?
