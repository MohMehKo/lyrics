yeah I'm sensible I want peace
and I believe it's still inside of me
far from here they speak a thousand tales
of what we lost into an open fire
I think it's time for you to look around
and see your past is like broken glass

where are the feelings?
where are the feelings?
a false empire of burning fire
a burning fire is what you are
a burning fire gonna leave a scar
a burning fire is what you are
a burning fire gonna leave a scar

I've had enough I'm gonna hide no more
now I've spoke I'm gonna speak some more
politics are getting in the way
people telling me what I should say
I think it's time for you to meet the boys
we'll cut through you like silence cuts through noise

where are the leaders?
where are the leaders?
a false empire of burning fire
a burning fire is what you are
a burning fire gonna leave a scar
a burning fire is what you are
a burning fire gonna leave a scar

yeah I'm not inspired

I've had enough I'm gonna hide no more
now I've spoke I'm gonna speak some more
politics are getting in the way
people telling me what I should say
I think it's time for you to meet the boys
we'll cut through you like silence cuts through noise

where are the leaders?
where are the leaders?
a false empire of burning fire
a burning fire is what you are
a burning fire gonna leave a scar
a burning fire is what you are
a burning fire gonna leave a scar

yeah
I'm not inspired
