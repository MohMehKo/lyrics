The desperation, aching in my bones
It's like the fire that burns in you
I lie awake just to think of a reason
A simple plan to help me through

When I was down, I could see no future
But as I lift my head, I see
A nature has no way of knowing
But I do know, where I've been.

Yeah, I could lie here
Hell, I could lie here
But that is not what I live for
I lie awake just to think of a reason
You feed my soul up, you keep my song alive

My head is healthy, but still I stay strong
It's never easy digging off
Before the eye knows what did we seek
The principles that get me through

With every breath I pull into my lungs
Inspires me to open up
the dust is evil, the battle in my mind
... the glass with every touch

Yeah, I could lie here
Hell, I could lie here
But that is not what I live for
I lie awake just to think of a reason
You feed my soul up, you keep my song alive

Yeah, I could lie here
Hell, I could lie here
But that is not what I live for
I lie awake just to think of a reason
You feed my soul up, you keep my song alive

Into its home, like a symbol of hope
I turn around, but you are not there
... is in me and now I surrender
You feed my soul up, you keep my song alive

Yeah, I could lie here
Hell, I could lie here
But that is not what I live for
I lie awake just to think of a reason
You feed my soul up, you keep my song alive

Yeah, I could lie here
Hell, I could lie here
But that is not what I live for
I lie awake just to think of a reason
You feed my soul up, a symbol of hope

[Repeated]
A symbol of hope is
A symbol of hope

Yeah, I could lie here
Hell, I could lie here
But that is not what I live for
I lie awake just to think of a reason
You feed my soul up, you keep my song alive

Yeah, I could lie here
Hell, I could lie here
But that is not what I live for
I lie awake just to think of a reason
You feed my soul up, you keep my song alive

You keep my song alive
