I never want to be
I never want to be like you
I wanna be myself
But you make me out to be somebody else
And I live in pain
And I love the darkness of my mind
Cos it makes me feel
You know it makes me feel like I'm alive
I'm alive
Oh I'm alive

Far across the land
Yeah far across the land
They understand, they understand the lies
But nobody here want to question why
It's not what I need
But if I cut myself I'm bound to bleed
I don't want to die
But it makes me feel like alive
I'm alive
Oh I'm alive
I'm alive
Oh I'm alive
I'm alive
Oh I'm alive
I'm alive
Oh I'm alive

Don't make the same mistake
Don't make cessation, no

I'm sick of being the crowd
I'm sick of being the crowd
It's up to me
I'm not gonna crack
But the demons inside
Keep on coming back
I've got to fight the fear
I've got to know that how I feel is real
I've got to speak my mind
Cos it makes me feel like I'm alive
I'm alive
Oh I'm alive
I'm alive
Oh I'm alive
I'm alive
Oh I'm alive
I'm alive
Oh I'm alive

Let go

Oh I'm alive
I'm alive
Oh I'm alive
I'm alive
