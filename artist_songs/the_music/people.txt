Hey Monday morning, 
See what you're missing, 
I can't live my life like this boy, 
I said hey little lady, 
see what you're missing, 
I can't get enough of your love, 

she goes...out all alone and out on her own [x4], 

how many times do, 
I have to say this, 
your match is a light for me babe, 
I said hey little lady, 
see what you're missing, 
I can't get enough of your love, 

she goes...out all alone and out on her own [x4], 

all alone [x6], 

the people [x3], change the way you live now, 
the people [x3], change the way you live now,
