I've been waiting
Searching, lonely
Take me walking
Underneath the stars
Love is here
No end
They'll hold us here forever
Just you wait and see
The sky is just a diamond
Reflecting the sea

Darkness edging closer to me
Talk to no-one
Tell them nothing
Fight the feeling
Don't you bear your soul
Love is here
No end
They'll hold us here forever
Just you wait and see
The sky is just a diamond
Reflecting the sea

Die, Die

Oooooooh
Love is here
No end
They'll hold us here forever
Just you wait and see
The sky is just a diamond
Reflecting the sea
They'll hold us here forever
Just you wait and see
The sky is just a diamond
Reflecting the sea
