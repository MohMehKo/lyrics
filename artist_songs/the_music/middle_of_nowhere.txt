Everyday girl
I worry about the people
And how it must feel girl
When your lonely with no-one else
What is going on when
No-one is for real, man
If your'e lonely, then listen to my voice

I really love ya, yeah
I really really love ya
But I'll never know your name
I really love ya, yeah
I really really love ya
But I'll never know your name

Funny thing when I think
Is all these people dying
Then they wanna kill some more
Why can't we be lovers?
Why can't we be brothers?
Instead of making war

I really love ya, yeah
I really really love ya
But I'll never know your name
I really love ya, yeah
I really really love ya
But I'll never know your name

I really love ya, yeah
I really really love ya
But I'll never know your name
I really love ya, yeah
I really really love ya
But I'll never know your name
