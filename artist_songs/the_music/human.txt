Human
Human Yeah
Human
Human Yeah

I can hear the silence
Of what we used to be
And I can see the sign
of what you want to be

Human
Human Yeah
Human

You have so changed
In many different ways
But now I'm sure
That now I want it that way
You used to show me how
But now I know much more than you will ever, ever know

YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

YEAAAAAAAH YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!
