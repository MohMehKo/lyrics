Nnnnnooooo
Nnnnnooooo
Aaaahhhhh

Child
Give me your hand

Will you ever
Say never
Just remember
Cos it's not you
If you ever
Look into my eyes
You will see me
Yeah for real now
This is what you want
This is what
You've got to fly like the butterfly
Watch that demon be my guide
Ah fly like the butterfly
Watch that demon be my guide

If I ever
Say never
Just remember
Cos it's not you

You've got to fly like the butterfly
Watch that demon be my guide
You've got to fly like the butterfly
Watch that demon be my guide

So now I feel so cold
So now I feel so cold
So now I feel so cold
So now I feel so cold
So now I feel so cold
So now I feel so cold
So now I feel so cold

You've got to fly like the butterfly
Watch that demon be my guide

Look into the air
Say never
No never
