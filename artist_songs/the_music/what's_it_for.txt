What's this life like?
When all you have is what you know
Take her time to
Think of all the things you could have done
And I'll be waiting
And I'll be there and I'll be round

I hope your happy
With you money
What's it for anyway
I hope this life you live
Is all the same

What's it for
What's it for
What's it for
What's it for
What's it for
What's it for
What's it for
What's it for

I hope your happy
With you money
What's it for anyway
I hope this life you live
Is all the same

Ooh and you only go
You come
You go
You come
And you wanna go
Go go go away
No no

And you wanna get away
Then you'll a way to get away
Gonna find a way to get away
Gonna find a way to get away
Gonna find a way to get away
Gonna find a way to get away
Gonna find a way to get away
Gonna find a way to get away
