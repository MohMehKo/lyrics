Baby let's be honest
The best is yet to come
Mother's arms around you
The tears when you were young
Let us wander endlessly
Through the open fields
Look into the sky above
And dream of better days

Where is this love going?
Where is this love found?
Where is this love going?
Where is this love found?

And I want you to know
That I will never leave or walk away
But they will never understand
I want you to comfort me
Let me go my way

And I want you to know
That I will never leave or walk away
But they will never understand
I want you to comfort me
Let me go my way

Baby let's be honest
The best is yet to come
Mother's arms around you
The fear when you were young

Where is this love going?
Where is this love found?
Where is this love going?
Where is this love found?

And I want you to know
That I will never leave or walk away
But they will never understand
I want you to comfort me
Let me go my way

Baby let's be honest
The best is yet to come
Mother's arms around you
The two of you are one

Where is this love going?
Where is this love found?
Where is this world going?
Where is this world found?

And I want you to know
That I will never leave or walk away
But they will never understand
I want you to comfort me
Let me go my way

Let me go my way
Let me go my way
Let me go my way
Let me, let me
