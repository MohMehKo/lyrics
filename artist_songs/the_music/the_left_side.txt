My hands are before me
the principles of life like a forest
to reach out and touch it
the spines are in my hands and I'm bleeding

now get up people and show you want it
cos I'm not sure you do
now get up people and show you want it
cos I'm not sure you do

I'm not, I'm not gonna just sit here and let this go to waste
watching the clock tick on my life
oh no
this time, this time's gonna be different
cos I know what I want
listing the people I'm taking down
this is what I'm fighting for

come over to the left side
we got something for ya
my mind it weaves a tangled web

Now get up people and show you want it
cos I'm not sure you do
Now get up people and show you want it
cos I'm not sure you do

I'm not, I'm not gonna just sit here and let this go to waste
watching the clock tick on my life
oh no
this time
this time's gonna be different
cos I know what I want
listing the people I'm taking down
this is what I'm fighting for
