The whole world follows them
as echoes respond to sounds.
one thought leads to another thought
the mind is the battle ground.

you are holding on
To all that really matters
You wonder, why
All this had to happen

Why am I the last one to know, last one to know
you try
To get a hold on yourself, hold on yourself

The words I can't understand
They are like waterfalls
The world in the palm of my hand
One day I'll crush you all.

you're holding on
To all that really matters
You wonder, why
All this had to happen

Why am I the last one to know, last one to know
you try
To get a hold on yourself, hold on yourself

Why am I the last one to know, last one to know
Why am I the last one to know, last one to know

Why am I the last one to know, last one to know
you try
To get a hold on yourself, hold on yourself

Why am I the last one to know, last one to know
you try
To get a hold on yourself, hold on yourself
