I live a life of the simple kind
a lie it only covers
either way
you do it every other day
giving love is essential
whenever we come undone
so believe what you want to
whenever you come undone

someone to love me
somebody to talk to
I wanna be like everybody else
someone to love me
somebody to talk to
I wanna be like everybody else

Nobody can hurt me
unless I allow them
for it is I, for it is I that is in control
even includes myself
too much and I fall
too much and I fall
that includes myself man
cos ya too idle

someone to love me
somebody to talk to
I wanna be like everybody else
someone to love me
somebody to talk to
I wanna be like everybody else

you won't survive just because you're idle
come ride with me on a wave that's tidal
forced to stand down and brave the winter
if you reveal the cracks
then you will splinter

someone to love me
somebody to talk to
I wanna be like everybody else
someone to love me
somebody to talk to
I wanna be like everybody else
