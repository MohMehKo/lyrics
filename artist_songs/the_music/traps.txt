Is this nostalgia over mine love
'cause now I'm back here with you
The jewel in my crown you always were
And sometimes feelings deceive me

The sea gets so hard to understand
If whats in my head is real
The world can sometimes glide me down
The things I think I saw real

Now
I keep living in my life
Without
The thoughts I fought in to resign

Lies, they were lies
It's not enough to wake you up
Get a hold of yourself
Before I crash, I get to fall

The sea gets so hard to understand
If whats in my head is real
The world can sometimes glide me down
The things I think I saw real

Now
I keep living in my life
Without
The thoughts I fought in to resign

Lies, they were lies
It's not enough to wake you up
Get a hold of yourself
Before I crash, I get to fall

Lies, they were lies
It's not enough to wake you up
Get a hold of yourself
Before I crash, I get to fall

Now
I keep living in my life
Without
The thoughts I fought in to resign

Lies, they were lies
It's not enough to wake you up
Get a hold of yourself
Before I crash, I get to fall

Lies, they were lies
It's not enough to wake you up
Get a hold of yourself
Before I crash, I get to fall
