The emptiness that burns inside
See how they run see how they hide
All the animals come out at night!
All the animals come out at night!

Just a slave to the city
To indulge in the pity
The opaque substitution
For a real revolution

Strength in numbers
No one will come between us

The human use of human beings
Their emotions you fail to see
The adrenaline it burns a hole
The adrenaline it burns a hole

Just a slave to the city
To indulge in the pity
The opaque substitution
For a real revolution

Strength in numbers
No one will come between us
