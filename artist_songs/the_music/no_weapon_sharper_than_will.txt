No one can touch me when I am here
Your bitterness is driven by fear

There is no weapon sharper than will, I know
And I'm gonna keep stamping down until I know
I've got my fill

I'm 
not gonna live my life alone
Life
is at its sweetest near the bone
In your eyes
I see a heartbeat like a stone
let it go and throw your arms around the sun

I can't get no peace in mind
Despite how hard I try
Turn down your ignorance
And maybe you will understand why
Fashion makes weaker souls appear to be something they're not
No words, just images
Nobody has a heart

There is no weapon sharper than will, I know
I'm gonna keep stamping down until I know
I've got my fill

I'm 
not gonna live my life alone
life 
is at its sweetest near the bone
in your eye I see heartbeat like a stone
let it go and throw your arms around the sun

I'm 
not gonna leave my life alone
life 
is at its sweetest near the bone
in your eye I see heartbeat like a stone
let it go and throw your arms around the sun
