You've been talking in your sleep
I can't seem to understand it
All the dreams that I chase
I can't seem to put my hand on

All the poison that you speak
Running through me like a river
So you keep talking in your sleep
I can't seem to understand it

I am a victim you are the vanquished
I am a victim you are the vanquished
I keep roaring
You keep chasing
I am a victim you are the vanquished

If I feel nothing
Then why is my heart on my sleeve?
I work for money
It goes out faster than it comes

You call this living?
To me it's just about getting by
I'll take my chances
If you don't know, come ask me why

Well you've been talking in your sleep
I can't seem to understand it
All the dreams that I chase
I can't seem to put my hand on

I am a victim you are the vanquished
I am a victim you are the vanquished
I keep roaring
You keep chasing
I am a victim you are the vanquished

If I feel nothing
Then why is my heart on my sleeve?
I work for money
It goes out faster than it comes

You call this living?
To me it's just about getting by
I'll take my chances
If you don't know, come ask me why

(I can't seem to understand it)
Is that why is my heart on my sleeve?
I work for money
It goes out faster than it comes

You call this living?
To me it's just about getting by
I'll take my chances
If you don't know, come ask me why

If I feel nothing
Then why is my heart on my sleeve?
I work for money
It goes out faster than it comes

You call this living?
To me it's just about getting by
I'll take my chances
You work all your life then you die
