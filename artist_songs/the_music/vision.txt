I want you to feel it
There's enough of us here
I can feel it in the air around me
So near
Now we are shoulder to shoulder
in the same plan 

Without you I'm a broken man
Without you I'm a slave to their plan
I'll wash the evidence from my hands
and leave the guilt behind 

I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna react
I'm not scared, I'm not gonna be trapped 
There's no vision, there's no vision today
Still living, living in yesterday

I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna react
I'm not scared, I'm not gonna be trapped
There's no vision, there's no vision today
Still living, living in yesterday

I know I can feel it
Just as tangible and as vivid as the moment that I'm in
So clear
Swim through the sea of pretenders

Without you I'm a broken man
Without you I'm a slave to their plan
I'll wash the evidence from my hands
and leave the guilt behind

I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna react
I'm not scared, I'm not gonna be trapped
There's no vision, there's no vision today
Still living, living in yesterday

I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna react
I'm not scared, I'm not gonna be trapped
There is no vision, there is no vision today
Still living, living in yesterday

There's no vision. There's no vision. There's no vision, something is about to change.
There's no vision. There's no vision. There's no vision, something is about to change.
There's no vision. There's no vision. There's no vision, something is about to change.
There's no vision. There's no vision. There's no vision, something is about to change.

I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna react
I'm not scared, I'm not gonna be trapped
There's no vision, there's no vision today
Still living, living in yesterday

I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna react
I'm not scared, I'm not gonna be trapped
There's no vision, there's no vision today
Still living, living in yesterday
