We all know the situation yeah
We all know the fear will soon be leaving
And we all know it's gonna be ok
One way in and no way out
One way in and no way out
No way out

Sooner or later you're gonna have to face it
Cos we all know the future is the force
We all see the old will soon be leaving
Cos we are told it's gonna be ok
One way in and no way out
One way in and no way out
No way out

Right now I'm not in love
Right now I'm feeling hurt
Right now I'm not in love
Right now I'm
One way in and no way out
One way in and no way out
No way out
