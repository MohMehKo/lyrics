I feel pain in every part of me
Now poor girl come and settle on my knee
I crave the love that the people talk about
But in love do ya feel
Feel a spike, feel alive

Yeah my body can't get enough
Feel a spike
Though emotionally I'm lost
Have no inner love
Feel a spike

In a part of me
I forgot about the city around me
Though emotionally I'm lost
Have no inner love
Feel a spike, feel a spike

Forget, forget the notion
If you don't feel this emotion
My words, they run like water
Into the cave of the insecure
My body shakes with the feeling
If I don't have you to believe in
Right now I'm Still devoted
My time it ticks away slowly

The doors close and the walls come in on me
Her toes curl at the very though of it
She craves the love that the people talk about
But in love do ya feel
Feel alive, feel a spike

yeah her body's just coming up watch her writhe
Though emotionally she's lost
Has no inner trust
She's denied

In a part of me
I forget about the city around me
Though emotionally I'm lost
Have no inner love
Feel a spike, feel a spike

Forget, Forget the notion
If you don't feel this emotion
My words they run like water
Into the cave of the insecure
My body shakes with the feeling
if I don't have you to believe in
Right now I'm still devoted
My time it ticks away slowly

Forget, forget the notion
If you don't feel this emotion
My words they run like water
Into the cave of the insecure
My body shakes with the feeling
If I don't have you to believe in
Right now I'm Still devoted
My time it ticks away slowly
(My time it ticks away slowly)
(My time it ticks away slowly)
