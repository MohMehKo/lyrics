Way, way down in the darkest secrets
that you and me aren't told
There lives a man, who won't believe us
when we show him love.
But someday soon 
they will rise
Cut us down without thinking twice.

Cold blooded, cold blooded animal.
Cold blooded, cold blooded animal.
Still running, still running from ya.
Cold blooded, cold blooded animal.

Way, way down in the back of your mind
There lives a consciousness.
Not every child listens to reason
Some will get away.
But someday soon 
they will rise
Cut us down without thinking twice.

Cold blooded, cold blooded animal.
Cold blooded, cold blooded animal.
Still running, still running from you.
Cold blooded, you cold blooded animal.

We are writing, but when will they listen to us?
The time we've wasted
We keep running, we just keep running.
I find you hopeless, you're breaking, you're breaking again.
'till it's over, you get colder and colder.

Cold blooded, cold blooded animal.
Cold blooded, cold blooded animal.
Still running, still running from ya
Cold blooded, you cold blooded animal.

Cold blooded, cold blooded animal.
Cold blooded, cold blooded animal.
Still running, still running from ya
Cold blooded, you cold blooded animal.

Cold blooded animal.
Cold blooded animal.
