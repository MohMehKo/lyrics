When mountains are high
clouds and rain form on them
when waters are deep
dragons are born in them
flourish in my arms tonight
cherished in my arms tonight

come on
How do I get through it?
come on
put ya back into it
come on
something to believe in
come on
know yourself from within

a burden to pass
that holds you from yours fortune
a dormant fire that burns a hole
inside you
flourish in my arms tonight
cherished in my arms tonight

come on
How do I get through it?
come on
put ya back into it
come on
something to believe in
come on
know yourself from within 

come on
How do I get through it?
come on
put ya back into it
come on
something to believe in
come on
know yourself from within
