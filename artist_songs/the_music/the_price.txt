Came back the other day.
Thought I'd listen to what you got to say.
Instead I'm feeling you are ...
I just went down and I prayed,
For nothing but love,
Instead I've got hate.
Now I know, now I know.

Whatever you feel inside,
You all better run and hide.
I'm tired of your fucking lies.
I'm tired of your fucking lies.

For the last time I will say this to you.
You've got to think for yourself,
Because they're telling us lies,
Every one of us stands for something.
