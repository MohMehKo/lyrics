So to the world
I'll raise a glass and
Turn my back on life
I wish that you were here with me
Instead of by his side
I can't believe it's been this way forever
But when you need it
It makes it harder

I need love

I need love
Help me now

So come on help me girl

I just wanted to leave
I can't help myself
I want love to help me find a home
My lonely life is simply nothing without you
I can't believe it's been this way forever
But when you need it
It makes it harder

Girl, move
I need love

Help me now

Honey its time to go
Honey its time to go

To what you said
I was so foolish
In this time
Please remember
Honey its time to go
