Right now I'm crying out for someone
I feel it more than ever
If there is no-one that can show me
How am I to learn from my mistakes?

Cause there's nothing I can't do to stop the violence
Well there's nothing I can do to stop this pain
Cause I'm nothing without you
We're nothing without you

Well there's nothing I can do to stop the rain

Our island's calling out for someone
Our words they are marching for us
How I am falling like a broken cloud
But now the sun has burned into my eyes

Cause there's nothing I can do to stop the violence
Well there's nothing I can do to stop this pain
Cause I'm nothing without you
We're nothing without you

Well there's nothing I can do to stop the rain
Cause there's nothing I can do to stop the violence
Well there's nothing I can do to stop this pain
Cause I'm nothing without you

We're nothing without you
Well there's nothing I can do to stop the rain
