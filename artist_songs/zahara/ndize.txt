Ndihambile, ndibonile
(I have walked, I have seen)
Bandixelele bandinikile
(They told me, they gave me)
Ndingafunanga ndingabuzanga
(I did not want,I did not ask)

[Chorus]
Ndiza ndiza
(I will come, I will come)
Ndizaw'buya ndikuphathel'ntliziyo yam
(I will come back, bringing you my heart)
Uzuyenze msulwa yona
(Make it pure)

[Repeat Chorus X2]

Ndizam'kucinga aha
(I'm trying to think)
Ndiyahluleka aha
(I'm failing)
Ingqondo yam, iyakhawuleza
(My mind is wondering)
Kuyehla kuyasa
(From sunset till dawn)
kum uyafana
(I'm still the same)
Ndonakele hee
(I'm ruined)

[Sing Chorus Till Fade]
