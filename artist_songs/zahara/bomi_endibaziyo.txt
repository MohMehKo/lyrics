Amaxesha esphila kuwo bantu abasazani
Sijongelana phansi sikhohlwe ubuntu bethu
Abanye benza noma yini bazuze ilizwe labo

Aaaahh aaaahhh
Bomi Endibaziyo

[Anele and Neliswa:]
Have you ever tried to reach for gold in the rainbow's end
People always try to please the world
Losing themselves on the way

Rather be stuck in ages
Bomi Endibaziyo

Rather be stuck in ages
Bomi Endibaziyo

Mina ndi soze
Ndikhohlwe nge nhlonipho yethu
Nezithethelele ngizo phumelela

[Anele and Neliswa:]
Emihla yam elule emhlabeni
Hhaaaaa hhaaaaa hhaaaaa hhaaaaa haaaaa hhaaaaa
Rather be stuck in ages
Bomi Endibaziyo

Have you ever tried to reach for Gold in the rainbows end
People always try to please the world
Losing themselves on the way

Rather be stuck in ages
Bomi Endibaziyo

Rather be stuck in ages
Bomi Endibaziyo [x2]
