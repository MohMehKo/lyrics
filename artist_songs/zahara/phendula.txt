Nkosi yami phendula ngiyacela [x4] [Answer me my God, I ask you]

[Chorus:]
Phendula phendula phendula [x4] [Answer me, answer me, answer]

Sinikela kuwe sincamile ngokwethu [x4] [You sacrificed yourself for our sake]

[Chorus]

Umhlaba wonke, ujonge nguwe [You were pierced to save me]
Inhlphebeko yethu, Yaziwa nguwe [You know our suffering u]
Anezifo zethu, Sophiliswa nguw [Our illnesses, are healed by you]
Unovuyo lwetu, Luvela kuwe [Our joy, comes from you]

[Chorus]

Hau Afrika, Afrika...

[Chorus]
