Some people live their dreams
Some their destiny pass them by
Tell me the reason why nothing ever stays the same
Sorrow and shame whoo oo oo oo hoo oo oo
Only God knows how long it will take for me to reach my destiny [x2]

Everything maybe rushing on me
Everything maybe too slow on me
But I will be here holding it down
I know where I am going.....

Winning, loosing doesn't matter 
I will keep on trying
I won't give up 

Cause 
Everything maybe rushing on me
Everything maybe too slow on me
But I will be here holding it down
I know where I am going.....

People telling me it's a highway
And a ponder of letting go
But I know in each and every end of the tunnel
There will be a little light in the end
And I thought of taking the route everybody else
Oh yes has been taking
But I know I have to find my own destiny hoo hoo

Everything maybe rushing on me
Everything maybe too slow on me
But I will be here holding it down
I know where I am going.....
