Another bird has grown
another part of each of us is gone, yeah
Another right has been wronged
But we go on until, until
The words of each of us are all too real
till I am not able to feel how you feel
And I cannot say how long it will take for you to heal
But I believe you healed, you healed, you healed,
I believe you healed, you will, you will
someday your broken heart will mend, yeah yeah
And you will find your smile again, yeah yeah
So take your time, for time is what it's gonna take
And then you awake to find there's one less tear
I believe you healed, you healed, you healed,
I believe you healed, you’ll be healed, you will be healed [x3]
The world has let you down, aaah
The words could explain could not be found, uuh
For me to say I understand is not enough
All I can say is hold on, until,
someday your broken heart will mend, yeah yeah
And you will find your smile again, yeah yeah
So take your time, for time is what it's gonna take
And then you awake to find there's one less tear
I believe you healed, you healed, you healed,
I believe you healed, you’ll be healed, you will be healed [x2]
See I, I believe every word u spoke to me, yeah, yeah
When u said you never leave me by myself,
But I am facing this world all by myself, its ok, it is ok,
Coz when you're gone I'll have my guitar [x2]
I'll find it home where I left it sitting & waiting for me
Coz when you're gone I'll have my guitar
Coz when all of my friends are gone I will have my guitar
Coz when everybody is gone I’ll have my guitar
I'll find it home where I left it sitting & waiting for me
When you are gone
Coz when all of my friends are gone I will have my guitar
Coz when everybody is gone I’ll have my guitar
I'll find it home where I left it sitting & waiting for me
Aaah, I’ll have my guitar
I’ll have a guitar
