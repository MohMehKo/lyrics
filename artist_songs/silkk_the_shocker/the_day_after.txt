[Silkk talking:]
Yo, this for all my people stuck, who ain't gotta choice,I ain't forgot
About yall, I'm comin' back for yall uhn huh, never let 'em tell you
What you can & can't do, look I know they tried to tell me

[Silkk]
Growin' up I never really had much
An if I had it was bad, if I ever had luck
An searchin' tryna come up, tryna get a fast buck
Had so many doors I could of ran into but I past up
In tha middle of tha ghetto not knowin' it's bad
He was gone most of tha time, never really knowin' my dad
Seen death at a young age, learned to expect that
Tell me I was never gonna be nothin', I learn to accept that
I only knew life, never knew death til' my grandmother left here
It was confusion not to see her, just see pictures on tha dresser
All I knew was smiles, I never knew what cryin' was
I only knew tha truth, I never knew what lyin' was
I only knew livin', I never knew what dyin' was
I never knew what a funeral & why everybody was cryin' & hugs
Standin' on tha block all night just tryin' to define love
Growin' up in a place where it really wasn't designed for us
I could of been born son of a queen
Instead I was born son of a maid, forced to leave sons kids wit fiends
Never could undestand why they done these things
Why everybody smile when she there, left they become so mean
Until I gre up & realized there was nobody else
You need help you gotta do it yoself(that's real)

[Chorus: Silkk] (Erica Foxx)]
