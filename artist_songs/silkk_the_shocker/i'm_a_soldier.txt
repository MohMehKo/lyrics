When I get that thing, everybody look down and round and round
Got the M-1 spittin' fire, bring yo' set to the ground
Got the C-4 explosives in the black backpack
Big Ed be puttin' down like that!!!!!

[Mia X]
We come strapped in we roll thick

Bomb shit, boss bitch, mama set it off

The hard hitta still be the biggest mama nigga

So, bring it, bring it on, how you wanna do it, what?
Cuz next to other's knees, I cover fuckin' dust
Anten-Hut nah, take it to the battle field
shoppers gon run, while we kick our enemies doors
I ask the lord, they don't want no more?
Mama, drama, told ya' No Limit done took over

[Chorus]
