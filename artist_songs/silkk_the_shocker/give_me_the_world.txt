Yo, god father I come today to ask you a favor
Young Silkk i've always liked you, today before we make

My life started FUCKED up got me lost in the game they 
told me i was never going amount to nothing so started
slanging some cane you could love or hate it nigga wanna
see Silkk incarserated they complicated, contomplated that's why
I can't be faded I hate it they sucked up they mad that I made it
Young Silkk overated keep my dope overweighted (?) mercedes respect
with a nigga like I smash hand on four five surrounded by killers and
soldiers and bullet proof glass mob representing linger soliders kiss

world united for me

[Chorus]

your fingers send it in the mail you'll have my money by twelve send

Give me the World
Money and power it's my only plan
Give me the World
