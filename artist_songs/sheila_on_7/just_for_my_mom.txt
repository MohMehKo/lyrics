Sometimes I feel my heart so lonely but that's ok
No matter how my girl just left me I just don't care
Whenever the rain comes down and it's seems there's no one to hold me
She's there for me, she's my mom

Just for my mom, I write this song (just for my mom)
Just for my mom, I sing this song
It's just my mom, can wipe my tears (it's just my mom)
Just for my mom, can only hear

Trap in a subway, can't remember the day but I feel ok
Damped in damn situation, in every condition with no conclusion
Whenever the rain comes downand it's seems there's none to hold me
She's there for me, she's my mom

You may say I have no one,to cover me under the sun
You only get it from your mom
Mom...
