I was far away from home
Doing what I love and like to do
But these feelings come out of nowhere
I felt so bored and tired of it all

And suddenly the phone rang
It was you and me we spoke and laughed
Yeah we had so much fun on the line
It's unforgettable

I've been loving you since the first time
An hour conversation on the phone
So I wanna thank you for filling the emptiness in me
It's you who I’ve been dreaming of
I’ve been loving you since the first time on the phone

We'd met before but
Only few words came out of you
I never thought that I could make you mike

And suddenly the phone rang
It was you and me we spoke and laughed
Yeah we had so much fun on the line
It's so memorable

I've been loving you since the first time
An hour conversation on the phone
So I wanna thank you for filling the emptiness in me
It's you who I’ve been dreaming of
I’ve been loving you since the first time on the phone

Since the first time on the phone
It's you in my past, my present, and my future
[2x]

I've been loving you since the first time
An hour conversation on the phone
So I wanna thank you for filling the emptiness in me
It's you who I’ve been dreaming of
I’ve been loving you since the first time on the phone

(On the phone) since the first time
(On the phone) on the phone
(On the phone) it’s you in my past, my present, and my future
