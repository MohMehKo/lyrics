Tonight we're gonna rule the world again
Plug it in, steal the girls again
Scissor kicks, bitchin licks and
Leather chaps and finger taps and
Tonight we're gonna let the roof cave in
Raise hell, passing out again
Spandex, whipping necks and
Mic stands, leopard head bands

Plug in tune out lets start the show
Its time to throw down here we go
Don't touch that volume button
We don't care if the SWAT team comes knockin'

Hey ho, welcome to the jungle
Oh no, where is Mr. Bungle?
Holiday in Cambodia
Help me Knights of Cydonia
The bulls are on parade
There's anarchy in the UK
Cities all on flame with rock and roll tonight

Tonight we're getting metal signs and
They'll crowd surf, jump in time again
Guitars, whammy bars and
High fives, stage dives and
Tonight we're gonna melt your face and
There'll be pounding bass again
String bends, leather fringe and
Motorbikes, metal spikes and

Plug in tune out lets start the show
Its time to throw down here we go
Don't touch that volume button
We don't care if the SWAT team comes knockin'

Hey ho, hi my name is Jonas
Oh no, our parents might disown us
Rock you like a hurricane
There's Cherub Rocks in LA Grange
The Mississippi Queen
She just won't talk dirty to me
Story of my life is just rock and roll all nite

We got burn outs and in house we're down to play
And if your down with the sound let me hear you say
We're no sell outs so you can put your cash away
Cuz the basement stays open like early late

Hey ho, hit me with your best shot
On no, sabotage, I can't stop
The devil went down to Georgia
Pride and joy with a barracuda
It's raining blood on me
The cult of personality
The number of the beast is one.
