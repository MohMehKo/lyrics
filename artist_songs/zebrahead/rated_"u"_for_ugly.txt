Hit Me, Hit Me, Hit Me
With all you got
Just a superficial girl
who cares a lot
About attentions that you get
They connect the dots
To form a target on your back
Take your best shot
Who loves you?
Who needs you?
The paint's peeling off the wall
That's it, that's all.
Who loves you?
Who needs you?
The itch makes your skin crawl
That's it, that's all.

That's it
That's all
Head to the wall
Head to the wall

[Chorus:]
Life's staring you, breaking through
Hold on tight to the radio
It's sad but true
Coming to the end of your life starring you
Breaking through
Hold on tight to the radio
It's sad but true
Coming to the end of near you

Give me. Give me. Give me
Got no heart to rot
When the scars and insecurities,
they hit the spot
And the acceptance that you crave
Is all for not
Left a crosshair on your head
Take your best shot

Who loves you?
Who needs you?
Always waiting for a call
That's it, that's all
Who loves you? Who needs you?
Sets you up for a fall
That's it, that's all
Head to the wall
Head to the wall.

[Chorus]
