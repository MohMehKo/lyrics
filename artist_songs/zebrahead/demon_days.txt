Hey kid here's a problem better deal with it
Sit upon your throne like you don't give a shit
No ones there to catch you if you fall
Got your back against the wall

I got the rattlesnakes shakes
Going out of my mind
I think somebody cut my break line
The clutch is in 5
The latch has sprung a fucking leak
As the submarine dives
And everybody's got a nemesis
I know that you're mine
3, 2 , 1
Demon days counting down
Hey!
All for none when there is no one around
Hey!
3, 2, 1
Scream the sirens sound
Kill the king of arrogance
Lies line your crown
Hey!

Whoa oh whoa oh
Time is running out on you
Whoa oh whoa oh
And there's nothing you can do
Whoa oh whoa oh
I hate to tell you but your days are numbered
Time is running out on you

Hey kid see the problem better deal with it
Here's a wake up call you'd better answer it
I won't stick around to watch you fall
Got your back against the wall

I got an end of days rate
It's only 9.95
I'm picking fights with my fate
He says I won't stay alive
I see a mushroom cloud
Open into the sky
From down in the gallows
To avenge and to rise
3, 2, 1
Demon days counting down
Hey!
All for none when there is no on around
Hey!
3, 2 ,1
Scream the siren's sound
Kill the king of arrogances
Lies line your crown
Hey!
