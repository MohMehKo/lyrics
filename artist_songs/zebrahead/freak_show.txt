I can't strand straight
Got no life in my eyes
I kinda look as if
I'm just about to kiss it goodbye
I'm a shit faced disgrace
Get me outta this place
I'm de-desensitised 
Yeah I can't stand straight
This ain't no big surprise, no

I've had no sympathy
And too much alcohol
Nothing ever pleases me
You can't break my fall
Standing on the ledge and I think
I'll take a dive 
I arrived deprived, won't make it out alive

I'm going down down down 
Give it up and let it go
Na-na na na
Na-na na na
I'm spinning round round round
Blackout then we'll never know
Na-na na na
Na-na na na
Whoa - dynamite about to blow
Ain't it great to be a freak show
I'm going down down down
Give it up and let it go
Na-na na na
Na-na na na na

Can't concentrate 
Got no feeling inside
I kinda look
As if I'm wearing just another disguise
I'm a shit faced disgrace
Headed into outer space
I'm va-vaporised 
Can't concentrate
This ain't no big surprise, no

I've had no sympathy
And too much alcohol
Nothing ever pleases me
You can't break my fall
Standing on the ledge and I think
I'll take a dive 
I arrived deprived, won't make it out alive

I'm going down down down 
Give it up and let it go
Na-na na na
Na-na na na
I'm spinning round round round
Blackout then we'll never know
Na-na na na
Na-na na na
Whoa - dynamite about to blow
Ain't it great to be a freak show
I'm going down down down
Give it up and let it go
Na-na na na
Na-na na na na

Spin a million miles an hour
Took it too far with a centerfold
Crash out at basement parties
Fear and loathing taking hold
Tumble down the countdown's starting
But I can't stop the roll
I try to get up
But I've lost control

I'm going down down down 
Give it up and let it go
Na-na na na
Na-na na na
I'm spinning round round round
Blackout then we'll never know
Na-na na na
Na-na na na
Whoa - dynamite about to blow
Ain't it great to be a freak show
I'm going down down down
Give it up and let it go
Na-na na na
Na-na na na na
