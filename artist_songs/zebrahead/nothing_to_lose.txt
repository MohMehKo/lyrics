I feel like it's all been done before
Like everyone's living just to even the score
And one by one we're death to bore
Makes you wanna break out kick down the door

Don't ever give it up
You'll make it out alive
Live it up while dying 9 to 5
Just stand up and tear it down tonight (tear it down tonight)

Rise up rise up rise up
From the bottom all the way to the top
Never listen when they tell you to stop
Rise up rise up

'Cause I got nothing to lose
Got nothing to prove
I got nothing to lose
I'm not giving up, I'm not giving in, I've got no excuse
I got nothing to lose
Got nothing to prove
I got nothing to lose
I'm not giving up, I'm not giving in, I've got no excuse
I got nothing to lose

You can take your small minds and blow 'em away
Try and bring me down with the lies you say
Yesterday's gone, now today's the day
Lowlifes and hoodlums come out to play

They tell you listen up stop talking out of line
Busting out
Well now would be the time
Just stand up and tear it down tonight (tear it down tonight)

Rise up rise up rise up
From the bottom all the way to the top
Never listen when they tell you to stop
Rise up rise up

'Cause I got nothing to lose
Got nothing to prove
I got nothing to lose
I'm not giving up, I'm not giving in, I've got no excuse
I got nothing to lose
Got nothing to prove
I got nothing to lose
I'm not giving up, I'm not giving in, I've got no excuse
I got nothing to lose

On top we're making it pop
All upside down we don't drop
With all the scars that we copped
From all the fakers who flopped
To all the battles that taught us
Through the lessons they fought us
'Cause they said we were Raucourse but we just came to rock
Rise up rise up rise up
From the bottom all the way to the top
Don't you listen when they tell you to stop
Rise up rise up

'Cause I got nothing to lose
Got nothing to prove
I got nothing to lose
I'm not giving up, I'm not giving in, I've got no excuse
I got nothing to lose
Got nothing to prove
I got nothing to lose
I'm not giving up, I'm not giving in, I've got no excuse
I got nothing to lose

I got nothing to lose

I got nothing to lose
I got nothing to prove
I got nothing to lose
I'm not giving up, I'm not giving in, I've got no excuse
And I've
Got nothing to lose
