Gotto get up
Gotto open my eyes
I'm swimming through this haze
That's been around me for days
Don't wanna come down
But you were always around
And everyone's so strange
There is nothing that they can change

Take my hand
Show me how this all fits in your plan
Understand
That I don't need you
I just need to

Feel how does it feel
To crush the world in two
One last time
And I
Am wasted
Feel how does it feel
To scream without a sound
One more time
And I'm
Still wasted

Get me away
I'm thinking maybe someday
You'll find out who I am
But you don't give a damn
Closing my eyes
It's all the same to me
What I don't want to know
Is what I'm not going to see

[chorus]

Watch the world stop
I drop put my finger on it
Thinking back to the day you said
I could get up on it
Say that you have changed
I'm the same just a little loaded
Comin' in out of phase lost my place
Now I know I've blown it
Fall into a sea of your distress
And I confess that
I take less than your best
But you don't want
To give it away today
Blue sky grey
Nothing that you say
Take another trip
Take another fall
Take it all away

[Chorus]
