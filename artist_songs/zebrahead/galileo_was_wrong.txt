You're always running and you're gunning for a piece of the pie
A super spy so conniving with your eye on the sly
You're pulse slowing ego growing as your picking up pace
Heard ya burned all your bridges now you lose the race

So smash it up
Nothing left to prove
These strange days are all about you
Smash it up
You can't get through
The world does not revolve around you

Cause this will be the last time
That you ever mess with me
You want everything for nothing
But nothing is a something
And nothing here is free

A major thrashing as you're crashing no one left to obey
A killer angle try to strangle anything in your way
Self preservation on the station rocks your radio
A 1, 2 knock out you're a TKO

So smash it up
Nothing left to lose
These strange days are all about you
Smash it up
No matter what you do
The world does not revolve around you

The world's not enough
Ya still like it rough
More ego than tough
I'm calling your bluff
The bass drum erupts
Your blood pressure drops
Strictly corrupt
Till karma goes "What's up?"

Smash it up
I wanna lie to you
These strange days are all about you
Smash it up
Leave me black and blue
One day your world will dissolve around you
