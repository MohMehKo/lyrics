I am alive, I am awake 
Not like I'm not aware 
I just don't care 
You are alone, I am the same 
Not like I'm not aware 
I just don't care 
So if you wanna lie 
If you wanna lie with me 
Come on baby pull up your dress 
Let me see you 
If you wanna smile 
If you wanna smile at me 
Well don't worry baby I'm ok I'm ok... 

I feel this weight fall from my shoulders 
All the plans we used to make 
And all the lives we had to fake 
Now I've thrown it all away 
How easy we forget what happened 
Arguements are said and done 
Smiles are made, embarrassed ones 
Photographs remind me I can 
Look in to the past but I won't stare 

I am inspired you are afraid
Not like I'm not aware 
I just don't care 
You are a liar this is all fake
Not like I'm not aware 
I just don't care 
So if you wanna tread 
If you wanna tread on me 
You'll walk in a fight 
I'll make it slippery 
Or if you wanna yell (Yell) 
If you wanna make a scene 
Don't worry baby I'm ok I'm ok... 

I feel this weight fall from my shoulders 
All the plans we used to make 
And all the lives we had to fake 
Now I've thrown it all away 
How easy we forget what happened 
Arguements are said and done 
Smiles are made, embarrassed ones 
Photographs remind me I can 
Look in to the past but I won't stare 

I am alive, I am awake 
not like I'm not aware 
I just don't care 
You are alone I am the same 
Not like I'm aware 
I just doooooooooooon't

I feel this weight fall from my shoulders
Feel my past just make me stronger
All the plans we used to make 
And all the life we had to fake 
Now I've thrown it all away 
How easy we forget what happened 
Arguements are said and done 
Smiles are made, embarassed ones 
Photographs remind me I can 
Look in to the past but I won't stare 

Stare, stare, stare, stare, stare, stare, stare
I won't stare!! 
Stare, stare, stare, stare, stare, stare, STARE!!!!!!
