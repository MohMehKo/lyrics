Another reckless holiday
Another brain cell floats away
I've had enough, please wake me up ...if I'm dreaming

Half these friends, fading fast, burning out, into ash
Where you wanna go cuz I will follow?
What you can't stomach, I will swallow.
Dissatisfied, dissatisfied, dissatisfied
Its alright, alright
Don't worry everything's gonna be alright
Its alright
Don't worry everything's gonna be alright, alright, alright
Dissatisfied

If the best times only last
In a second come to pass
Where you wanna go cuz I will follow?
What you can't stomach, I will swallow.
Dissatisfied, dissatisfied, dissatisfied. It's alright, alright
Don't worry everything's gonna be alright
Its alright

Don't worry everything's gonna be alright, alright, alright
Dissatisfied

Another reckless holiday
Another brain cell floats away
I've had enough, please wake me up ...if I'm dreaming
Another never-ending night
Another long and sleepless life
I've had enough, please wake me up ...if I'm dreaming

Twenty more days since we've been gone, and I'm so sick of
Twenty more nights I've spent alone, and I'm so sick of
Twenty more days 'till I get home, and I'm so sick of being here
