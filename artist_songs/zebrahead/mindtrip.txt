Take a trip in your mind
Open up and find
All the shit that you never knew
Cuz choices is why
Women don't try
To color in a black and white VIEW
When reason inflicts
Jealousy and Theft
Reaction is all you can do
Jumped from behind,
Open up your mind
See what the fuck you can do

[Chorus] Cuz it's a mindtrip it's a mindtrip comin' on
it's a mind trip, it's a MIND-Trip
Cuz it's a mindtrip it's a mindtrip comin' on
it's a mind trip, it's a MIND-Trip
[End Chorus]
Lend out your ears
Intelligence sears
Ignorance is bread from the room
Cuz your fascist eye
You thought to cry
Everyone's here to make ROOM
Sit in the back and rub on your cock
Looking for something that's new
Jump from behind
Open up your mind
See what the fuck you can do
[Repeat Chorus]
Back to the front, to the front, to the front
Back to the front, to the FRONT
Back to the front, to the front, to the front
Back to the front, to The!
