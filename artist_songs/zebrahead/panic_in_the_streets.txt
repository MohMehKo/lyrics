Paranoid confusion
Disarray and disillusion
Working overtime
Giving up what's mine

Yeah, panic in the streets now
Party's in the basement
We scream for entertainment
Riots in the backyard
Feel it from the pavement
Products of our environment

If you wanna give up from the start
If you wanna watch it fall apart
If you wanna let it break your heart
But if you start now then you will never stop it

We're taking what we need
Party til' we bleed
Begging on our knees
Panic in the streets
Tonight, tonight we're alive

We're taking what we need
Party til' we bleed
Begging on our knees
Panic in the streets
Tonight, tonight we're alive
We're alive

Permanent vacation
Loss of breath and suffocation
Turn it up to ten
Fueled by medicine

Yeah, panic in the streets now
Party's in the basement
We scream for entertainment
Riots in the backyard
Feel it from the pavement
Products of our environment

If you wanna give up from the start
If you wanna watch it fall apart
If you wanna let it break your heart
But if you start now then you will never stop it

We're taking what we need
Party til' we bleed
Begging on our knees
Panic in the streets
Tonight, tonight we're alive

We're taking what we need
Party til' we bleed
Begging on our knees
Panic in the streets
Tonight, tonight we're alive
We're alive

Take a ride on the freak side, caught in a riptide
Pulling us down, leave your heart by the wayside
Grind motivation, no hesitation
Nothing left to lose but a punk rock nation

Sound the alarm cause' the tides are turning
To weather the storm with the rep we're earning
Try and stay calm with the music turnin'
Farewell to all of the bridges we're burning

We're taking what we need
Party til' we bleed
Begging on our knees
Panic in the streets
Tonight, tonight we're alive

We're taking what we need
Party til' we bleed
Begging on our knees
Panic in the streets
Tonight, tonight we're alive
We're alive
