On track
Never look back
When bad times seem to distract
You got to make your way, don't you know that

Don't wait
Till it's too late
Got to let the bad times fail to illuminate, right?

Cause I can always tell when your falling
I can hear you calling
I can see it in your eyes when you're stalling
But after all you know that I'll be around
To pick you up when you're down

You never gave yourself a rhyme or reason
I know some days are too hard to bear
And if you need a hand, I'm standing there

You're the one that gives me inspiration
Change the way I see every day
I want to make you feel the same

Don't say
That there's no way
Every bruise heals someday
You got knocked down and that's okay

Come on, it's on
Get a move on
Its about what you got to do, not the things that you've done

Cause I can always tell when you're falling
I can hear you calling
I can see it in your eyes when you're stalling
But after all you know that I'll be around
To pick you up when you're down

Just another lie, just another reason why
You don't trust it, confidence is busted
Your running but you're rolling on fumes
And if you need a hand, understand that we can get through

Cause I can always tell when you're falling
I can hear you calling
I can see it in your eyes when your stalling
But after all you know that I'll be around
To pick you up when you're down

Cause I always knew that you'd move on

And I always knew that you'd be strong
...can you feel it?
