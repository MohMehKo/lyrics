Hello operator, can you connect me home?
I am a space invader got this heart that is made of stone
Maybe I can catch you later cuz I hate to be alone
Back to back to back with all my broken bones
'Nother day another regret these scars don't bother me
They're here to drown the sunset
Come have a drink with me
Didn't mean to make ya upset with all my vanity
Back to back to back, the pressure crushing me

Come on and lose control...

Dance Sucka!
Whoa Whoa
Dance Sucka!
Now you wanna go
[x2]

I wanna meet my maker, can you get him on the phone?
Bet he's a caped crusader
Fighting crime when he gets stoned
My bass controls the fader, and now the speakers blown
Back to back to back wherever I may roam
'Nother day another defect will shine it's light on me
Magnifier on an insect burn it up in effigy
The predicate to a subject of a novelty 
Back to back to back adrenaline rushing me

Dance Sucka!
Whoa Whoa
Dance Sucka!
Now you wanna go
[x2]

Super duper hypertronic blast bionic burn baby [x4]

Come on and lose control...

Dance Sucka!
Whoa Whoa
Dance Sucka!
Now you wanna go
