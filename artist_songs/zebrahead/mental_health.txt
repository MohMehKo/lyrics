Let's go

The lights are on but there is no one home
Yeah I'm the type of guy that shouldn't be left alone
They say just one more night of observation
There's nothing like a permanent vacation

Hey ho
Break down like you want me to but I will not give control to you
Hey ho
Sniffed like a pound of glue forget all the things that you put me through
Hey ho
You left the residue now I'm nuts just like a blue cashew
I go psycho psycho psycho psycho

And all I want is to go home just for a bit hey hey hey
But these wadded rooms are the shit

Woah woah
I'm happy in my mental health
Woah woah
These conversations with myself
Woah woah
They say that only time will tell
Whatever I'm happy in my mental health
I'm happy in my mental health

One two one two three go

Now meet a friend of mine now where'd he go
He's probably sitting there but you will never know
They say just one more shot shoaw
Try not to resist they say lie down and bite on this

Hey ho
And let the shocks away cause the voices in my head are here to stay
Hey ho
Don't push your tests away but I get more drugs than the DEA
Hey ho
One day you'll do my brain they take your shoe laces away
You go psycho psycho psycho psycho

And all I want is to go home just for a bit hey hey hey
But these wadded rooms are the shit

Woah woah
I'm happy in my mental health
Woah woah
These conversations with myself
Woah woah
They say that only time will tell
Whatever I'm happy in my mental health
I'm in my mental health

Strait jacket bad habit
Cause I live for the habit
This static illmatic
Double dose is just like magic
Strait jacket let's have it
You pump up all my panic
Welcome this is my life
A padded room up in the attic

And all I want is to go home just for a bit hey hey hey
But these wadded rooms are the shit

Woah woah
I'm happy in my mental health
Woah woah
These conversations with myself
Woah woah
They that only time will tell
Whatever I'm happy in my mental health

Woah woah
Psycho psycho
I'm happy in my mental health
Woah woah
Psycho psycho
I'm happy in my mental health
Woah woah
Psycho psycho
I'm happy in my mental health
Woah woah
Psycho psycho
I'm happy in my mental health
