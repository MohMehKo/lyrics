Hold on tight yeah this city makes you crazy
Drive all night till the sun goes down
And maybe we will leave this dead end town for good

The scene is getting old and always dragging me down
And all the people who surround
Are always taking shit now
And these so called friends in this so called life
Will cut you into shreds overnight

Gonna leave this town behind me
No one's ever gonna find me
This town will be the death of me I know
No one's ever gonna find me
I'm a prisoner of these dead end streets I know
Oh oh oh

Don't look back
Put your money where your mouth is
Make a pact that we're never gonna break
This just might be the last you see of me

On these dead end streets
All the sorrows we drowned
And all the friends that were down
Are all long gone now
And the so called truths
Were just watered down lies
Now there's nothing left to do but bail tonight

Pack up your bags and grab the moonshine
Meet me out back at a quarter to nine
In the rear view mirror we shrink the skyline
Later to the takers cut them down to size
Pedal to the metal and fuck the goodbyes
