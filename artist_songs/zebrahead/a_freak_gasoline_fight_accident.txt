The world's gone to war we're facing devastation
All the ships have come to shore
It's a space invasion
Now they're breaking down the doors
Blood money donations
Only static coming through the radio station

Hey Hey
Show your teeth
Take a bite
Hey Hey
Ya can't compete
Wrong the right
Hey Hey
It's hard to breathe
Choke on another white lie
Can't accept defeat
We sell our souls to get by
Cuz nothing in this world is free

Here we go
Gasoline
Spark to flame
Set us free
Here we go
Energy
Light the fuse
To believe
Let's go

The cops broken in sound the evacuation
It's an eye for an eye blind retaliation
Survival of the fittest kills the strongest relations
Come and join the decline of western civilization

Hey Hey
Underneath
Sacrifice
Hey Hey
What you believe
To pay the price
Hey Hey
It's hard to breathe
Choke on another white lie
Can't accept defeat
We sell our souls to get by
Cuz nothing in this life is free

Sound the alarm
They breached our apathy
Fight or disarm
Let's start a mutiny
Sound the alarm
Pay em in effigy
Cuz nothing in this life is free
