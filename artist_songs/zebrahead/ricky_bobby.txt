You can try and try but you can’t beat me
Life is such a drag when the whole world’s falling apart
I’ll stand my ground, I won’t let you bleed me
You had the last laugh but you never had a chance from the start
You can try and try but you can’t beat me
The dam is gonna crack so come on now show me some heart
Feel the motherfuckin’ floor fall out beneath me
Life is such a drag when the whole world’s falling apart

Paranoia
Nice to know you
Hold on tight
Or lose control
Hypertension
Overload
Ain’t it cool?
Here we go

Whoa oh whoa oh oh oh
Just give me one second
Whoa oh whoa oh oh oh
Just give me one second to breathe

You got so fucking’ high now you can’t see me
Life is such a drag when the whole world’s falling apart
I never meant to lie, why don’t you believe me?
We were born to lose so you might as well aim for the stars
You bark and you bite now my brain is teething
If you want it so bad then come on baby show me your scars
You can try and try but you can’t beat me
Life is such a drag when the whole world’s falling apart

Paranoia
Nice to know you
Hold on tight
Or lose control
Hypertension
Overload
Ain’t it cool?
Here we go

Whoa oh whoa oh oh oh
Just give me one second
Whoa oh whoa oh oh oh
Just give me one second to breathe

Paranoia
Suffocating
The stress
Suffocating
The paranoia’s always waiting
The pressure
Suffocating

Whoa oh whoa oh oh oh
Just give me some time to breathe

Whoa oh whoa oh oh oh
Just give me one second
Whoa oh whoa oh oh oh
Just give me one second to breathe
Whoa oh whoa oh oh oh
Just give me one second
Whoa oh whoa oh oh oh
Just give me one second to breathe

Life is such a drag when the whole world’s falling apart
Hey hey hey hey
Life is such a drag when the whole world’s falling apart
Hey hey hey hey
