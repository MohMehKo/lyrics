I heard opposites attract
So you're stuck with me
I'm like Jack Kerouac, on the road for weeks
But when I come home you'll be there for me right?
Without you, I'll never make it
I got a sick sense that I got a reason to worry
And sometimes I'm dense but these thoughts come in a flurry
You say they're nonsense but I dreamt you left in a hurry
I don't think I'll ever make it alone
Annihilate
I'm wide awake
Don't walk away
I'm suffocating
Don't change your mind
Don't be the death of me
If you want me here I am
Counting down to a zero
I got a panic attack
Like you wouldn't believe
And my breathing's out of whack, like a drum machine
I know if I pass out, you'd resuscitate me right?
Without you, I'll never make it
Is it okay now or did you meet someone better?
Without a mohawk with a real job and a sweater
Leaving me shell shocked steady getting ready for a header
I don't think I'll ever make it alone
Standing on the edge of the great divide
You're pushing all the right buttons to make worlds collide
Would you stab me in the back like a homicide
Or leave me buried in your bullshit like a landslide
Are you biding your time with me waiting for someone better to come along?
As I sit and I scream this song
Are you biding your time with me waiting for someone better to come along?
If you are then I proved you wrong
Both ends burn
I'll be waiting for you
I won't turn
I'll be waiting for you
Both ends burn
I'll be waiting for you
