Look and start to stare into a new point of view
Trip between the lines of what they say that you can do
Break apart the prejudice that rules all the fools
Prove that they are wrong
To prove that they are wrong, yeah
Stare into the type of the division's that you're making
Hatred and misunderstanding are always mistaken
Punk mother fuckers want to ban what I be sayin'
So I break 'em off, so I break 'em off yeah

Pull back, one shot
Pull back, one

Rollin' by the beach
I see a dude with different skin than me
Instead of give a pound, I back track to cross the street
I ain't bullet proof, sucker could be trying to test me
Just to wet me up, stupid set me up
'Cause all I hate is part of a predominant salvation
Motivate to change or ride opinion of the nation
Regulate to live right die expectation
Just so you belong
Just so you belong

Stop the world, stop the world
Where do we get off?
Stop the world, stop the world
It's got me spinning around in circles
Stop the world, stop the world
Where do we get off?
And if I had my way
You know I'd stop the world
Stop the world

Piece to my enemy
Trying to get ahead of me
Anger is like ecstasy, drop it 'till you OD
Eats away your dignity
All you all come with me
Time to tear it up
Time to tear it up
Hype is not this point of view
You can lie to me, but to you be true
It's not what you say, it's all that you do
And you got the most juice in your youth

Pull back, one shot
Pull back one

Stop the world, stop the world
Where do we get off?
Stop the world, stop the world
It's got me spinning around in circles
Stop the world, stop the world
Where do we get off?
And if I had my way
You know I'd stop the world
Stop the world
Stop the world, stop the world
Where do we get off?
Stop the world, stop the world
It's got me spinning around in circles
Stop the world, stop the world
Where do we get off?
And if I had my way
You know I'd stop the world
Stop the world
