Hey man, are you doing alright?
Is that noose around your neck tied on too tight?
Ha ha, told you so
You got sucked undertow
One last chance to let the shit go
Get away get away, it's a raw deal
Down play, disarray it's a third wheel
Unplay everyday to know what's real
Mayday, mayday lost your ideal
There is no ideal
Feel me

High impact blindside tonight
When I was young, never compromised
Low impact blindside tonight
When I was young, never had to try
Blindside, woah
Blindside, woah
Blindside

Hey man, have you been up all night?
Do you got to get numb so you can feel right?
Ha ha, told you so
Too high, vertigo
One last chance to let it all it all go
Get away get away, it's a raw deal
Down play disarray, it's a third wheel
Unplay everyday you know what's real
Mayday, mayday lost your ideal
There is no ideal
Feel me

High impact blindside tonight
When I was young, never compromised
Low impact blindside tonight
When I was young, never had to try
Blindside, woah
Blindside, woah
Blindside

And the shot took a piece of me
Fade in, fade out, if that's what you got
Flash flood focus over me
Fade in, fade out, if that's what you got
And the shot took a piece of me
Fade in, fade out, is that what you got?

And the shot took a piece of me
Fade in, fade out
And the shot took a piece
Fade in, fade out
Of me

High impact blindside tonight
When I was young, never compromised
Low impact blindside tonight
When I was young, never had to try
High impact blindside tonight
When I was young, never compromised
Low impact blindside tonight
When I was young, never had to try
Blindside, woah
Blindside, woah
Blindside, woah
Blindside
Blindside
Blindside
