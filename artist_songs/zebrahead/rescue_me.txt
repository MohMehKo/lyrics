Another tragedy in the news
Someone shooting down the right to choose 
It doesn't seem at all that they chose the right way 
Another law I heard got passed today 
Someone's trying to take my rights away 
It doesn't seem to me they chose the right way 
It's out of my hands but stuck in my mind in time I find my spine is crooked in design I want to be so much more
(I wanna be so much) 
Rescue me 
Take this hand, by myself, alone I stand 
Rescue me 
From this world, from myself, before I grow old 
Someone rescue me 
Does anybody ever feel this way? 
Does anybody have the guts to say? 
It doesn't seem at all they chose the right way (yo man you're going the wrong way) 
Who am I to say I disagree? 
Who am I not to change a thing? 
Because I don't believe they chose the right way (hey man you're going the wrong way) 
[Repeat Chorus]
Here it comes again
Excuse too weak to stand on 
I'm falling off 
Too weak to stand on 
I'm falling off 
Too weak to hang on 
Falling for you to catch me (catch me) [x2]
I'm afraid 
That no one is changing 
who's to blame? 
Someone SAVE ME!! 
[Repeat Chorus]
