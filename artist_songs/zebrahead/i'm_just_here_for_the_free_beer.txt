Jumpin' off a rooftop
Makin' all the clouds pop
Come one and all it's time for a shake up
Fakin' is the new real
Liars makin' new deals
Watch it unravel
How dumb do you feel?

I don't really care about society
I don't really care go on and lie to me
I don't really care if we don't agree
I don't really care what you think about me

Mic check 1,2
Firewall breakin' through
Molotov's are fallin'
Pump up the volume
A minor threat like you
Paper wings torn in two
Kill switch stallin'
Pump up the volume

I don't give a fuck 'bout your revolution
I don't give a fuck 'bout your institution
I don't give a fuck and I ain't gonna listen
Whoa Oh
I don't give a fuck about your expectation
I don't give a fuck 'bout your motivation
I don't give a fuck and I ain't gonna listen
Whoa Oh

Crashin' in a new car
Burning like an old star
Rise for the fall of it all, it's a new war
Money make a mean shield
Blees as ya skin peels
Knees cuttin' gravel
How numb do you feel?

I don't really care about your anarchy
I don't really care if you're judging me
I don't really care about your jealousy
I don't give a fuck what you think about me

I don't give a fuck 'bout your revolution
I don't give a fuck 'bout your institution
I don't give a fuck and I ain't gonna listen
Whoa Oh
I don't give a fuck about your expectation
I don't give a fuck 'bout your motivation
I don't give a fuck and I ain't gonna listen
Whoa Oh

I really really care about what you're thinking
All of your thoughts
All the money you're making
I really really care about what you're drinking
How did you get so cool?

I really really care to hear about your day
All the cool people that you met today
I really really care about what you have to say

Naw just kidding... Fuck off!
