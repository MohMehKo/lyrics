Ladies and Gentlemen, Welcome to the show
We want it all, we want it now, we wanted you to know
So keep your hands and legs inside the ride and take it slow
It's bullshit by design, we're out to blow your mind

I ain't no Steve McQueen
I'm like a dead popstar in a magazine
I'm anyone left lost in quarantine
With pro tools cutting up the hit machine

So come and take more, take more
You can't help yourself, no
Escape more, escape more
You can't help yourself, no
Break more, break more 
You can't help yourself, no
Puked my heart out on the asphalt (heart out on the asphalt)
Don't think you're cut out for this

Save me from myself
This ain't a test,  state of emergency
Cause I can't stop myself
I'm trying my best
Tell me what else could go wrong

I dream like halloween
I got a knife in my back and a song to scream
I watch the walls cave in, inhaling gasoline
It's like that in the middle of this party scene

So come and take more, take more
You can't help yourself, no
Escape more, escape more
You can't help yourself, no
Break more, break more 
You can't help yourself, no
Puked my heart out on the asphalt (heart out on the asphalt)
Don't think you're cut out for this

Save me from myself
This ain't a test, state of emergency
Cause I can't stop myself
I'm trying my best
Tell me what else could go wrong

This is some good shit, where'd you get it?
You're such a fucking hypocrite, it's so appropriate
I'm feeling so delinquent and all degenerate 
This is some good shit, where'd you get it?

Save me from myself
This ain't a test, state of emergency
Cause I can't stop myself
I'm trying my best
Tell me what else could go wrong

Save me from myself
This ain't a test, state of emergency
Cause I can't stop myself
I'm trying my best
Tell me what else could go wrong

Thanks for coming to the show

It's bullshit by design
Straight out, just lose your mind
