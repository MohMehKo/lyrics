Yeah!

Sit back and sit in your hole
(Shut up you hypocrite)
Feels like I'm losing control
(Shut up you hypocrite)
When life is taking it's toll
(Shut up you hypocrite)
You gotta give it up, gotta, gotta let it go

Break apart, it's a start
Take it all away and hit explode
Hit the floor, hit discard
It's a long and winding row
You better buckle up cause' the end is starting
Degenerates gotta be the life of the party

Get up, get up!
All the saints and sinners
Get up, get up!
The losers and the winners
Get up, get up!
All the freaks and geeks
Get up, get up!
Wait til' they get a load of me

Sit back and sit in your hole
(Shut up and deal with it)
Hold on, we're losing control
(Shut up and deal with it)
Sometimes you don't even know
(Shut up and deal with it)
You gotta give it up, gotta, gotta let it go

[?]

Ain't there no where left to kill
Enjoy dispair, in the air
Think we just hit an all time low
You better cut your teeth cause' the pain is coming
Another let down, with this [?]

Get up, get up!
All the saints and sinners
Get up, get up!
The losers and the winners
Get up, get up!
All the freaks and geeks
Get up, get up!
Wait til' they get a load of me

Wait til' they get a load of me
Wait til' they get a load of me!

Break it all down, spawn in the underground
Take it all now as promises drown
I can show you how and keep you spellbound
Break it all, break it all, break it all
Hey! Hey!

Nothing to left to care
Even if it's just a little
Let a sharp tongue stare
cut you down the middle
Grind to a halt
with the bitterness tasting
Nothin sadder than latter,
life less wasted

Get up, get up!
All the saints and sinners
Get up, get up!
The losers and the winners
Get up, get up!
All the freaks and geeks
Get up, get up!
Wait til' they get a load of me
