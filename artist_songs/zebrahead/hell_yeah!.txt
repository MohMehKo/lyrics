Hell Yeah! Woooooo

Punk rock, trippin' with the flavour of hip hop
Spittin' out venom as I'm watching all your heads bob
Representing for the outcasts and the have nots
Fiending to find light in a world that has blacked out

Well middle fingers up (Yeah put em up)
We've had enough
We take our shots to the chin with a grin, we're tough
We know exactly why you're here, so make it clear (let's go)
We know you want to (Let's go, Let's go)

Hell Yeah! Hell Yeah!
We want control
Hell Yeah! Hell Yeah!
A scene to call our own
Hell Yeah! Hell Yeah!
Griop the microphone
And we're picking up speed like a rolling stone

Let's Go! We can't live forever
One note! The louder the better
So Let's Go! We're in this together
Can you hear me?
Hell Yeah! Let's Go!
Let's Go! We can't live forever
One note! The louder the better
So Let's Go! We're in this together
Can you hear me?
Hell Yeah! Let's Go!

Rising from the ash, counter clash and there is no doubt
Swinging from the rafter are the kids who never sold out
Holding out for hope, this shit is dope, hear the crowds shout
Fighting to survive, but one day we'll make them tap out

We'll raise your voices up (Yeah raise em up)
We've had enough
We're standing up and now we're being heard the gloves are off 
The voices loud, we have the crowd, the time is now (let's go)
We know you want to (Let's go, Let's go)

Hell Yeah! Hell Yeah!
We want control
Hell Yeah! Hell Yeah!
A scene to call our own
Hell Yeah! Hell Yeah!
Grip the microphone
And we're picking up speed like a rolling stone

Let's Go! We can't live forever
One note! The louder the better
So Let's Go! We're in this together
Can you hear me
Hell Yeah! Let's Go!
Let's Go! We can't live forever
One note! The louder the better
So Let's Go! We're in this together
Can you hear me
Hell Yeah! Let's Go!

Get up tonight
Stand up and fight
They are here 
They are inside, they're inside
And I can't go alone on this microphone
Is this on? Is this on?

This flow, definitive, make your throat hurt
A gagged voice with no choice is so limited
Hell Yeah! Come on!
Hell Yeah! It's On!
Bounce to the boom of the beat of the drum

Let's Go! We can't live forever
One note! The louder the better
So Let's Go! We're in this together
Can you hear me
Hell Yeah! Let's Go!
Let's Go! We can't live forever
One note! The louder the better
So Let's Go! We're in this together
Can you hear me
Hell Yeah! Let's Go!

Hell Yeah!
