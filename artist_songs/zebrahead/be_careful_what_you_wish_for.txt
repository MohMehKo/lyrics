This is me
I've got a nasty sense of humour and a case of high anxiety
If you please
I would rather be alone, than have the world around you judge me
So I've got my life together, but it's half of what it should be
So you think you can make it better?
You'd better help me, help me

Hang on but prepare
I can't live up to you
Hold on, Hold on
There's still a part of me that can't escape my insecurities
Hang on, this is me

Can't you see
I've got a perfect explanation but keep it deep inside of me
Pardon me
But if you really want to know
Well then you'd better learn to trust me
So you've got your life together, but you say you gotta have more
So you think I could make it better?
Just be careful what you wish for

Hang on but prepare
Can't live up to you
Hold on, Hold on
There's still a part of me that can't escape my insecurities
Hang on, This is me

Paint the perfect picture
But these pictures are deceiving
Cause the colours lost their place
And they're dripping down and bleeding
And they're running and running away
Packed it up and leaving
And these dreams turn to nightmares
Like a promise with no meaning

So be careful what you wish for
You just might get it
And if this is what you live for
You might as well forget it
You don't know what you wish for
The small print, never end
Be careful what you wish for
You just might get it (get it get it)
You just might get it (get it get it)
So hold tight

Hang on but prepare
Can't live up to you
Hold on, Hold on
There's still a part of me that can't escape my insecurities
Hang on, This is me (Be careful what you wish for)

Hang on but prepare
Can't live up to you
Hold on, Hold on (You just might get it)
There's still a part of me that can't escape my insecurities
Hang on, This is me (Be careful what you wish for)
(Be careful what you wish for) This is me
(Be careful what you wish for) This is me
