What the fuck is going on?
Let me set it straight on the topics that I'm flowing on. 
Like Chuck D, Public Enemy to the Nation. 
Or call me Busta' Rhymes cause that's my occupation.
Hip Hop make your body rock
Slam raw rapsand rhythms that make you pop lock
Hip Hop on the non-stop
Take it up a notch and watch the beat drop

I am where I am
I'm only here cause I want to be
I am where I am
You don't give a damn cause you're a wanna be

Now, my rhymes are so phat they make biggie look Small
and if you ain't down with that then we bound to brawl
cause i got heart like De La Jolia
and if you still don't know then I'll show ya. 
'Cause I'm a straight refugee like L-Boogie. 
Never go limp but I do it for the nookie. 
I got rhymes like Jennifer Lopez gots ass. 
Slap the backboard like Shaq as i dunk off a pass

[Chorus]

One two, one two here we go. 
I'm a straight pimp like Lewinsky is a ho. 
I could go psycho like Buscemi in Fargo. 
And, like Chris Tucker, hydroponics keeps me high yo.
Hip Hop make your body rock
Slam raw rapsand rhythms that make you pop lock
Hip Hop on the non-stop
Take it up a notch and watch the beat drop

[Chorus]
