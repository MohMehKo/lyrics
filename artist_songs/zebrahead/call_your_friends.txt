Let's go all night hangin' from the ceiling, tied up, pants down, just
another weekend
Won't remember tonight, wake up feeling like, what the hell happened?
what the hell happened last night?

Grab a beer, throw it back, take a hit, talkin' smack party yeah-rock the
party
Pull some strange, take a shot, rally back back yeah-rock the party

So I say
Lets make some bad decisions
Do things we won't remember
so call your friends tonight

Lets see through double vision
The best night we won't remember
So lets get fucked all right
Yeah call your friends tonight

Lets go all night
Footprints on the ceiling
Lights on, pants off, just another weekend
Won't remember tonight, wake up feeling like, what the hell happened?
what the hell happened last night?

Grab a beer, throw it back, take a hit, talkin' smack party yeah-rock the
party
Pull some strange, take a shot, rally back back yeah-rock the party

Lets make some bad decisions
Do things we won't remember
so call your friends tonight

Lets see through double vision
The best night we won't remember
So lets get fucked all right
Yeah call your friends tonight

[Solo]

Lets go all night
Footprints on the ceiling
Lights on, pants off, just another weekend
Won't remember tonight, wake up feeling like, what the hell happened?
what the hell happened last night?

Dude watch this
Dude, it's 8am

So I say
Lets make some bad decisions
Do things we won't remember
so call your friends tonight

Lets see through double vision
The best night we won't remember
So lets get fucked all right
Yeah call your friends tonight
