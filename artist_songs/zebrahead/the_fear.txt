I think that time has got the
Best of me, best of me
I wish the worship was mine
Apathy, apathy
For we live another day
Close it in, close it in
Technique I put me on the wall again

When I split right down the middle
Spill my insides
Hurts just a little
Split, split right down the middle
Swallow my pride
Choke, then I let go

Stop, wake up
These lies will help me find you
Fade in, fade out if that’s what you got
Girl give up, the truth can get you through
Can not deny
It can not be spoken

I think my instincts will get
Rid of me, rid of me
And my sins will weigh on me
Heavily, heavily
Will you remember reside
Fade away, fade away
Then I’m the one that should take all the blame

When I split right down the middle
Spill my insides
Hurts just a little
Split, split right down the middle
Swallow my pride
Choke, then I let go

Stop, wake up
These lies will help me find you
Fade in, fade out if that’s what you got
Girl give up, the truth can get you through
Can not deny
It can not be spoken
Stop, wake up
These lies will help me find you
Fade in, fade out if that’s what you got
Girl give up, the truth can get you through
Can not deny
It can not be spoken

Do you believe that it’s the dark before the dawn?
Do you believe
Do you believe that when you’re down you carry on?
Do you believe
I know the pressure makes you audible to love
I know that you can rise above

Losing pace, I can’t stay in this place
And I can’t, and I won’t, and I don’t need you
Losing face, what a shame and a waste
And I can’t, and I won’t, and I don’t need you

Stop, wake up
These lies will help me find you
Fade in, fade out if that’s what you got
Girl give up, the truth can get you through
Can not deny
It can not be spoken
Stop, wake up
These lies will help me find you
Fade in, fade out if that’s what you got
Girl give up, the truth can get you through
Can not deny
It can not be spoken
Deny, it can not be spoken
Deny, it can not be spoken
