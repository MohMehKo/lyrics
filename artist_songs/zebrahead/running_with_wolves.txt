Degenerate
Rock and Rolla
My right hand man
A pistola
Always on the take
Yeah take and let me go now
Wind em up
Wind em up
Hit em booya
Gonna shoot it straight
Jack no cola
Sticky grabbing hands
Bleeding ebola
Wanna know your fate?
Yeah wait and let me show ya
Light 'em up
Light 'em up
Go right through ya
Back to the front going side to side
You're fuckin out - danny mcbride
Runnin with the wolves we hunt the pride
We do what we want
Won't be denied

Call it an emergency
Victim of society
State of immaturity 
Where everyone's the enemy
This is not a test
This is cardiac arrest
State of immaturity 
Everybody
Call it an emergency
Victim of society

Check mate
Mind controller
One last stand
A rival loner
Whatcha got at stake?
Yeah, wake and let me show ya
Wind 'em up
Wind 'em up
I go right through ya
Mca the great split sober
You underestimate
I am the joker
Come and take the bait
Yeah over and over
Light 'em up
Light 'em up
A supernova

Back to the front going side to side
You're fuckin' out - danny mcbride
Runnin' with the wolves we hunt the pride
We do what we want
Won't be denied

Call it an emergency
Victim of society
State of immaturity 
Where everyone's the enemy
This is not a test
This is cardiac arrest
State of immaturity 
Everybody
Call it an emergency
Victim of society

Check the sun dial
We're going hostile
Delinquent menace to society's the profile
We got it going now it's on and on
From earth to outer space like the wrath of khan
A tension worldwide 
The battle bonafide
Pick a side, do or die, we're killing homicide
We got it going now it's on and on
From the heavens up above straight to hell we spawn

Call it an emergency
Victim of society
State of immaturity 
Where everyone's the enemy
This is not a test
This is cardiac arrest
State of immaturity 
Everybody
Call it an emergency
Victim of society
