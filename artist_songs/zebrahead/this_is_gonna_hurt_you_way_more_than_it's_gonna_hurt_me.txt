Must be yeah it must be
It's gonna be the time of my life
I see yeah I see
I see you in a different light
Whoa oh oh
Everything will be all right
Cause it must be
It must be
It's gotta be the time of my life

You spent your time building your case
Took a break just to spit in my face
It's not about you or who you screw
When they don't catch you
If you say so
Arsenic lips are laced
With such an epic fall from grace
It's all about proof and not the truth
I don't believe you
I want you to know

Oh life is better without you
So much better without you
Since you've been gone
Whoa oh oh
Oh life is better without you
So much better without you
Since you've been gone

Was the blood and guilt down down the drain
My own Andromeda strain
When I caught you nude with some dude
Now I can't trust you
Let it Go
Ice in you're veins
Sex lies and slow hydroplanes
So don't be rude
Set the mood
I still won't fuck you
I want to know
