In a cantina on Tatoine-a
a kereoki wookie sing-a
A hairy creature, with rugged features
Sang Van Halen's 'Little Dreamer'
And as he sang his tune
my girl started to swoon
As he escorted my love from the room
(Chewabaca Growl)

My girlfriend left me for a wookie
she said he ate a better cookie (yeah)
My girlfriend left me for a wookie
hope I find a wookie who loves me too.

His velvet jumpsuit, my cause was quite moot
the wookie elvis did sing quite cute
Sing under stop light, the mood was just right
for the wookie to score again tonight.
And as he sang his tune
my girl started to swoon
As he escorted my love from the room

My girlfriend left me for a wookie
she said he ate a better cookie (yeah)
