Our lungs are chokin' in the haze
Distortion comes in waves
Gotta get away from the lies and the liars
Hearts are hand grenades
Sharp like razorblades
Gotta make a break from the lies and the liars

Wind me up and then let me go
A sabotage low in every flow
Stacking em up like a domino
Knock em all down with a single blow
Burn a bridge just to watch it fall
Flood the engine to see it stall
Things so small make you feel so tall
Push my back up against the wall

A tall tale to tell
A hard sale to sell
A break down
You're lying to yourself
A tall tale to tell
You're just an empty shell
A break down
You're lying to yourself

Half-Truth and lies
Empty alibis
Cut me down to size
Turns out the jokes on you
You can't disguise
Better recognize
I won't sympathize
Turns out the joke's on you

Shoot me down with a ricochet
Poison tongue and a price to pay
Sweeping down like a bird of prey
To tear me apart right where I lay
Turn a question into a brawl
Mix some vengeance with alcohol
Break my will just to see me crawl
Push my back up against the wall

A tall tale to tell
A hard sale to sell
A break down
You're lying to yourself
A tall tale to tell
You're just an empty shell
A break down
You're lying to yourself
