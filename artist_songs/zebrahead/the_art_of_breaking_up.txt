Everybody welcome to the art of losing
I never thought that I'd be giving up
Take your best shot, it's ego-bruising
One for the road and I think I've had enough

I owe you! Pain and suffering
You owe me! A sense of humor
I know you! Want the last word
Too bad, goodbye!

And all the words that we're saying spinning in circles
Over and over I let this go
And now this game that we're playing getting us nowhere
What are we waiting for?

(Hey!) Let’s break it down
(Hey!) Let’s give it up
This is the sound of me bleeding: Whoa oh-oh!
(Hey!) Let’s break it down, the Art of Breaking Up
This is the sound of me leaving: Whoa oh-oh!

Take another jab and say that you hate me
Win another medal in the Art of Breaking Up
Pack up and threaten to leave me
Promise you I won't tell you to stop!

I owe you! An empty apartment
You owe me! My bank account
I know you! Want the last word
Too bad, goodbye!

And all this time that we're killing never returning
Over and over just let this go
And all the lies that we're telling getting us nowhere
What are we waiting for?

(Hey!) Let’s break it down
(Hey!) Let’s give it up
This is the sound of me bleeding: Whoa oh-oh!
(Hey!) Let’s break it down, the Art of Breaking Up
This is the sound of me leaving: Whoa oh-oh!

Here's the part where you are screaming: Whoa oh-oh! (Hey! Hey!)
Here's the part where I am leaving: Whoa oh-oh! (Hey! Hey!)
I've had enough
You've had enough
We've had enough; can’t take it…

Let me break it down, the Art of Breaking Up
This is sound of me bleeding: Whoa oh-oh

(Hey!) Let’s break it down
(Hey!) Let’s give it up
This is the sound of me bleeding: Whoa oh-oh!
(Hey!) Let’s break it down, the Art of Breaking Up
This is the sound of me leaving: Whoa oh-oh!

This is the sound of me leaving: (The Art of Breaking Up!) Whoa oh-oh!
This is the sound of me screaming: Whoa oh-oh!
This is the sound of me leaving: (The Art of Breaking Up!) Whoa oh-oh!
This is the sound of me screaming: Whoa oh-oh!

This is the sound (Hey!)
This is the sound (Hey!)
This is the sound of leaving: Whoa oh-oh! Whoa oh-oh! Whoa oh-oh!
