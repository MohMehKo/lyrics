This is disconnected
I got infected
No way out so then I wrecked it
A shadow or a stalker
Dopamine blocker
Good man down
What a shocker

All covered in kerosene
We're stuck in the middle of the cracks
And we are in between
All covered in kerosene
We're over the limit
Gimme alcohol and nicotine

It's the death of the party
Clouds around the sun
Innocence since departed
Kids load your guns
Right back where we started
We've come undone
It's the death of the party

After all this time
And the life that I wasted
To find I erased it all
All mine all mine
It's all burning up
And It's never enough
So this is my last chance to light up the sky
I'm burning It down tonight

Drugs are ineffective
I lost objective
We threw down poisoned perspectives
Psych out the psychotics
Somewhere chaotic
Underground
It's so exotic

All covered in kerosene
We're stuck in the middle of the cracks
And we are in between
All covered in kerosene
We're over the limit
Gimme alcohol and nicotine

It's the death of the party
Clouds around the sun
Innocence since departed
Kids load your guns
Right back where we started
We've come undone
It's the death of the party

And if you wanna come and take every little piece of me
Come at me
Cuz everything's diminishing
And if ya wanna suffocate me to get room to breathe
Act quickly
I'm my worst enemy
