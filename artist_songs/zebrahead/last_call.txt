Yeahhhh!

Let's begin
So we bend and break apart
Into a thousand little pieces just waiting to start it again
And defend all the lonely hearts
So throw another back before the feeling departs
We're breaking apart
Yeah!

Get out the way, kid
Countdown oblivion
Get out the way kid
We're breaking apart
Get out the way, kid
Countdown oblivion
Get out the way kid
We're breaking apart
You don't want it
Cuz it makes it harder to breathe
You can't drop it
Already got you down on your knees
You can't top it
It's everything you thought it would be
You can't stop it, stop it
Lie to me!

So if we're going down
Let's raise our glass
Another round
Let's drown it all away (All away)
And if we're going down
Let's smoke 'em if we got 'em now
I wouldn't want it any other way
Last call humanity!

This is the end
Pull the pin right from the start
Back from a million other reasons for why and why not scream-it-again
And ascend on the bullshit wrought
So you can squeeze the fuckin' trigger right into my heart
(We're breaking apart)
Yeah!

Get out the way, kid
Countdown oblivion
Get out the way kid
We're breaking apart
Get out the way, kid
Countdown oblivion
Get out the way kid
We're breaking apart
You don't want it
Cuz it makes it harder to breathe
You can't drop it
Already got you down on your knees
You can't top it
It's everything you thought it would be
You can't stop it, stop it
Lie to me!

So if we're going down
Let's raise our glass
Another round
Let's drown it all away (All away)
And if we're going down
Let's smoke 'em if we got 'em now
I wouldn't want it any other way
Last call humanity!

[Solo]

Strung out burn out covered in lies
Got to get some thicker skin to hide you thinner disguise
Gettin' manic with the pain swelling up in your eyes
Like a wave it smells up and cuts you down to size

You don't want it
Cuz it makes it harder to breathe
You can't drop it
Already got you down on your knees
You can't top it
It's everything you thought it would be
You can't stop it, stop it
Lie to me!

So if we're going down
Let's raise our glass
Another round
Let's drown it all away
And if we're going down
Let's smoke 'em if we got 'em now
I wouldn't want it any other way
Last call humanity!

(Oh yeah! Sweeeet!)
Let's Go!
