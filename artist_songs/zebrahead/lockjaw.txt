Lockjaw my skin raw
I've had it with you walking on me
Like an addict
Still manic
Scratching on the itch till I bleed
Seesaw on my last straw
Why you always wanna compete?
Irradic, start a panic
Fight apologize repeat
I defy you boxing me in

You're always boxing me in
Won't let it happen again
You're always boxing me in
Won't let it happen again

True crime in high times
Make no sudden movements just freeze
Like a cheap shot that's hard fought
I like you when you're down on your knees
My teeth grind, shoot blind
I'm always on the edge of my seat
Like a good cop to the bad cop
Fight apologize repeat
I defy you boxing me in

On and on again
I feel worthless
Start to brawl and then
Feel so small
On and on again
Say I'm helpless
Start and stall and then
Make me crawl
On and on again
It's never painless
Start to brawl and then
Feel so small
On and on again
Say I'm reckless
Start and stall and then
Watch me fall

You're always boxing me in
Over before it begins
Always the same in the end
Won't let it happen again
