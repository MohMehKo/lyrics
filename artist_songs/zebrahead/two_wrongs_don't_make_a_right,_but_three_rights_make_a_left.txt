Fuck it
I get the feeling tonight that it's going down
I get the feeling she might hit the fan
I get the feeling cause she left without a reason
But I don't care! She's a fucking nightmare!

Like a fool, back in school, run around on the weekend
Took a bit of time but now I see it like a bee can [uh oh oh oh]
When I'm not around you're with another dude streeking
Like bount chica bount bount chica bount-bount

I spy a girl gone wild weekend
I spy that you're hittin' up my best friend
I spy you're going down in the deep end
6-6-6, my antichrist girlfriend

I take back all the shit I gave you
I take back every word I said to you 
I take back everything except the part where I said we were through
I take back all the shit I gave you
I take back every word I said to you 
I take back everything except the part where I said we were through

Bust it
I get the feeling she might sleep with other guys
I get the feeling tonight she's not alone
I get the feeling cause he picked her up this evening
But I don't care! She's a fucking nightmare!

Smokin' kools by the pool
Saw your tail when I was peeking and
Went to grab a beer and heard the box spring squeakin'
Walked into the room and there you were freakin'
LIke bount chica bount bount chia bount-bount

I spy a girl gone wild weekend
I spy that you're hittin' up my best friend
I spy you're going down in the deep end
6-6-6, my antichrist girlfriend

I take back all the shit I gave you
I take back every word I said to you 
I take back everything except the part where I said we were through
I take back all the shit I gave you
I take back every word I said to you 
I take back everything except the part where I said we were through

Good riddance and goodbye, take your promise turned to lies
Take your lows and your highs like a rollercoaster ride
Like a polar tht's a bi lie woo!
That's a sigh of relief
so listen, I'm gonna tell you why

You're gonna get what you deserve
What goes around comes around, haven't you heard?
Like a boomerang bound to round the curve
You're gonna get what you deserve

I take back the life that I gave you
I take back all my fucking money too
I take back everything except the part where I said we were through
I'm taking back all the flowers that I gave you
I'm taking back all the dinners that I bought you
I'm taking back the time you stole my heart, my soul, are you even listenin'?

I take back all the shit I gave you
I take back every word I said to you 
I take back everything except the part where I said we were through
I take back all the shit I gave you
I take back every word I said to you 
I take back everything except the part where I said we were through
