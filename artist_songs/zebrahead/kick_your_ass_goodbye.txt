Watch the lights start to flicker
Every time you lie
Ammunition pull the trigger
Watch the bullshit fly
The mess gets bigger
When the well runs dry
A crack in the mirror
Hides blood shot eyes
Cuz you fucked it up for the last damn time
Now somethings got to give
It's gotta give
You let me down It's not the first time
This ain't no way to live
Ain't no way to live
With a word to the wise
Cut me down to size
Slow burn take a turn
Get on the rise
Find no easy way out
Try to cut the ties
With just one shot
Right between the eyes
When the skies up above come tumbling down
And life as you know starts crumbling round
And karma has you hanging on by a string
No one owes you anything

Kiss your ass goodbye
Kiss your ass goodbye
I finally realized
It's time I let you go
That's all you need to know
Kiss your ass goodbye

You could kill for less
Ya got an axe to grind
Keep your cards to your chest
Like a mastermind
With a plan to infest
Rage made you blind
And now all we got left
Got left behind
Because you fucked it up when you crossed the line
Now somethings got to give
Its gotta give
You let me down cut my lifetime
Now I'm bleeding through the sieve
Bleeding through the sieve
Now grab a hold tight
Like a parasite
Get smashed talk trash
Feed your appetite
The venom seeping in
Worse than the bite
And now I'm giving in
Just to prove you right
When the walls all around come rumbling down
And the lies that you spun spin back around
Ya get caught in your trap like a landmine spring
No one owes you anything

When the skies up above come tumbling down
And life as you know it starts crumbling round
And karma has you hanging on by a string
No one owes you anything
I'm not a stepping stone
A cast and broken bone
Live and learn that the hard ways
Overblown
It never fails whatcha reap is what you've sewn
And one day you're gonna find yourself alone
And the aftertaste will spark the pain
And all the lies you said were said in vain
Cuz you lost much more than you could ever gain
When regret is the only thing that remains
When the walls all around come rumbling down
And the lies that you spun spin back around
You get caught in your trap like a landmine spring
No one owes you anything
