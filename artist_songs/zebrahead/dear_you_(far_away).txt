Dear you 
What's your name? 
When did we start this crazy game? 
Pull up a chair 
Grab a drink 
I need something not to make me think 
And all in all 
It's all the same 
The days go on and on 
Eleven days and forty nights 
When's the last time that we kissed goodnight? 
I want to know who you're laughing with 
I want to know that there's more than this 
But all in all 
It's all the same 
It goes on and on 
Because you're far away
Jut like yesterday Wait to see you smile
And I'll be gone
So far away
Never ending day
Drive a million miles
And I'll be gone a while 
I never thought it would come to this 
I never thought of all the stupid shit I'd miss 
The way you looked when I made you mad 
We never missed the things that we never had 
And all the talk and all the time 
It goes on and on 
She said: 
'That's right, I don't want to leave now"
