Stutter step through another trap set by deception
Mention rejection
Always lies in your eyes
Settles in your action
lies in your eyes
Settles in your action
Jeopardize everything that I want
And I won't compromise anything anymore
In any way victimize myself any more
Liberty (YEAH)

[Chorus:]
Manipulations on my mind
Expectations well defined
Frustrate me
Liberate me
Cause everything's falling apart
You can't control me, You can't control me
Everything's falling apart
Now I can't see you
Doesn't matter what I do
I can't see you
Cause everything's falling apart

I got exposed to a deeper form of infection
Shout out "I need acception"
Always lies in your eyes
Settles in your action
lies in your eyes
Settles in your action
Criticize everything that I do
And I will overcome anything that's in store
Nevermore look up to you and adore
Liberty (YEAH)

[Chorus]

Manipulation on my mind
Inspect me - try to check me
Expectations well defined
Dissect me - want to wreck me
Violator of my own will
Accept me - reject me
Separate or SHOOT TO KILL

[Chorus]
