And so I'm bruised and beaten
Wake up from the floor that I've 
been sleeping 
Next to the radio you broke
Yea the hits just keep on coming

Summer skies alibi December lies
Nothing like a party to get you drunk and make you start a fight
I see the DJ look away
when you say you went home
The turntables turn the tables
You confess you weren't alone
And it just hit me

[Chorus:]
That's all my mistakes
Could never add up to the only one
that you just made
And all my headaches
Will never compare to the biggest one that you just gave

So I'm broken, bleeding
From this mouth you said
was no use keeping
And it's not so good so far
Your lipstick stains my neck
and gives me a new scar

Summer skies alibi December lies
Nothing like a party to get you drunk and make you start a fight
I see the DJ look away
when you say you went home
The turntables turn the tables
You confess you weren't alone
And it just hit me

[Chorus]

All my bruises are all I have to show
And all along I had nowhere else to go
Like your dagger stuck inside I'm stuck
Stuck inside some makeshift reality
where you meant the world to me
But finally getting free
and it just hit me

[Chorus]
