Cuz I'm a user, a shmoozer, a big dollar loser. 
That doesn't matter cuz my friends call me a brusier and I . . . 
get chicks, so many chicks want me (nope). 
Cuz I'm not funny, honey. A big oafy dummy. 
That doesn't matter cuz my friends say I'm money and I, get drunk, too many drinks want me (yeah). 

Yo, get out the get out the way of the money man. 
Ladies know I'm dope, so consider me contraband. 
Fella's are just jealous, cuz they're ponies and I'm mustang. 
Don't try to hang cuz I'm out with a big bang. 
Get get down, all the ladies wanna be with me. 
Get get down, all the fellas compete with me. 
Get get down, and I know that I'm trippin, but I really don't care cuz this is how I'm livin'. 

[CHORUS]
All the ladies wanna know me. 
They ignore me-intimidated by me. 
All the fellas, all the fellas wanna be me. 
They ignore me-intimidated by me. [x2]

Who needs them anyway . . . cuz I'm money. 

Cuz I'm a user shmoozer, a big dollar loser. 
That doesn't matter cuz I drive a land cruiser. 
And I, get chicks, too many chicks want me (psyche). 
Cuz I'm not funny, honey, a big oafy dummy. 
That doesn't matter cuz you know I play with money, and I, get drunk, too many drinks want me. 

Got a time bomb, tick tick tickin' just like Anthrax. 
Boyz wanna battle, so I bought me a battleaxe. 
Climax, your girl screams my name when we have sex 
(I should charge a sales tax, yeah). 
Get get down, all the ladies wanna be with me. 
Get get down, all the fellas compete with me. 
Get get down, and I know that I'm trippin 
But I really don't care cuz this is how I'm stickin'. 

[CHORUS x2] 

Everybody look at me! 
I'm pimp ass money. 
I know you wish, to get with this tonight. 

Everybody look at me! 
Flyer than Mr. T. I know you wish, to get with this tonight. 

Well who needs them anyway? [x2]
cuz I'm money. Get get down . . . 
I bring the static. Axl.
