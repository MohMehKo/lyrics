So you got a little time to waste
Well come on I'd like a little bit of pain to taste
So roll on and when you're watching your world fall apart
It's not the end or the middle it's the fucking start

Well everything little thing keeps adding up
And i know that life can be hard enough
And when you're struggling hard to breathe
Feels like your caught in a landslide
Knocking you down to your knees

We're on our own
Hearts ripped and torn
On a dead end road
But we want more
Hey!
We'll never let up or give up
Control is worth fighting for

You're the ones to blame
Fifteen seconds of fame
We're fucked up
And the world has gone insane
Whoa oh
Some things never change
You're the ones to blame
We'll never be the same
We're fucked up
And the world has gone insane
Whoa oh
Some things never change

It's all about the win, and not the chase
So watch out cuz time disappears with out a trace
So burn out and as you fall taking two to the heart
Ya ain't no victim to belittle your just playin' the part

When every little thing comes crashing down
You just need to take a good look around
When you're a walking catastrophe
You'll see the light at the end of the tunnel
You gotta believe
