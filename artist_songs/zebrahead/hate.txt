Why's this motha fucker looking at me
Is it something more than he wants to see
I got a gun and it's mother fuckin loaded
One more look and your daddy blows it because
All the shit you disgust me, and I hate you
Because your not like me
So
Me and my boy beat him down
3 against one, man he's a clown

So I never had a fuckin education
Sell a little drugs, to battle inflation
Sleep with a girl that I sometimes pay
Fuckin, better than being fuckin gay anyway
See one walking and it makes me mad
This I learned from dear old dad
Hate all the things you don't understand [x2]
Well
I hate all the things I don't understand [x6]
Nurtured with a fist
Sharp instead of a kiss
Glare instead of a weightless aginity
Boy don't fuckin think
Hate him because he's gay
See there's a lift when the mother fucker waits on you
Because I hate what I am
Hate what I am
I'm a man [x4]
Man
I'm a man [x4]
Man
I'm a man
