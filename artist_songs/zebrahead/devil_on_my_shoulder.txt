You'll never catch me now
You know I won't slow down
You'll never catch me
You'll never take me
You'll never catch me now
Another shot in the dark
Another fire and spark
A bullet wide of the mark
On the run
Loaded gun
Guilty from the very start

You'll never catch me now
You can't catch me
You'll never take me down
You can't break me

Whoa
Devil on my shoulder
I'm laying lower now my life is over
Whoa
Devil on my shoulder
I'm laying lower now my life is over

You'll never catch me now
You know I'm underground
You'll never see me
You'll never catch me
You know I won't go down
Another walk in the park
Another tooth of the shark
A bite as bad as the bark
On the run
Loaded gun
Guilty from the very start

You'll never catch me now
You can't catch me
You'll never take me down
You can't break me

Whoa
Devil on my shoulder
I'm laying lower now my life is over
Whoa
Devil on my shoulder
I'm laying lower now my life is over

Strappin on my six shooter
Who's that mean hombre?
Vengeance like a crooked Buddha
Coming to pay me back one day
Some say I'm a barracuda
Some say I'm a hand grenade
Runnig with a thousand looters
Looting through the vice parade
Just another shot in the dark
Like a wanted man
Just another fire and spark
Like a wanted man
Like a bullet wide of the mark
Like a wanted man
On the run
Loaded gun
Guilty from the very start

Whoa
Devil on my shoulder
I'm laying lower now my life is over
Whoa
Devil on my shoulder
I'm laying lower now my life is over
