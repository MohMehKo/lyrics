Lick my wounds and I feel pain
Watch my future go down the drain
Made my ruin now I'm aimed at you
Bane of the butcher we are through

Love kills Love kills
Like the cyanide living in a jagged little pill
Love kills Love kills
It's not for the faking it's just for the thrill
Stop I hate it!
Don't stop! I need it!

Now I will never be the same
And so I will never be the one to blame
But if I go crashing down in flames
Just wave at me
I guarantee it's you I'm taking with me 

Vanished truth I believed in you
Gave myself you bled me through
Crimes of youth grow better with age
In a living hell you're my war to wage

Love kills Love kills
Like a vendetta left breathing
so my guts will spill
Love kills Love kills
It's not for taking, it's just for the thrill
Stop I hate it!
Don't stop! I need it!

Now I will never be the same
And so I will never be the one to blame
But if I go crashing down in flames
Just wave at me
I guarantee it's you I'm taking with me 

In a wasteland 
So far away
I miss your bleeding heart
It's my last stand
I'd die to say
I miss your bleeding heart
In a wasteland 
So far away
I miss your bleeding heart
It's my last stand
I'd die to say
I miss your bleeding heart

Devoid of any feeling Devoid of disagreeing
Devoid of what I'm seeing
Devoid you left me reeling
I break!
Stop I hate it!
Don't stop! I need it

Now I will never be the same
And so I will never be the one to blame
But if I go crashing down in flames
Just wave at me
I guarantee it's you I'm taking with me 

Now I will never be the same
And so I will never be the one to blame
But if I go crashing down in flames
Just wave at me
I guarantee it's you I'm taking with me
