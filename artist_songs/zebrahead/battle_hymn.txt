Whatcha gonna do when they come kicking down your front door?
Will you lay down, surrender like you did before?
Suffocating on the broken promises you can't ignore
The pressure's mounting
Remember what you're fighting for
Lay down your arms take your pill sit still and obey
What's in the harm, kill your will
Find someone to betray
Lose control of your mind and soul in the modern day decay
The riot's starting 
Can the kids come out and play?

Whoa
Set 'em up
Knock 'em down
Light it up
(Cause) we run this town
[x2]

Batten down the hatches
Lock the windows cuz
They're breaking in
Out on the street let me hear your battle hymn
Keep your finger on the trigger
Notify your next of kin
Chance for survival, optimistically is one in ten
Give up the fight
Stand down and walk away
Like a dying light
Once bright now starting to grey
Did you lose control of your mind
And soul in a modern day decay?
The riots starting
Can the kids come out and play?

Whoa
Set 'em up
Knock 'em down
Light it up
(Cause) we run this town
[x2]

So laddie doddie, the system is shoddy
Just take your punches in bunches
And go exploit somebody
So come on, lose control of your mind and soul
In a modern day decay
The riots starting
Hey kids, come out and play!

Whoa
Set 'em up
Knock 'em down
Light it up
(Cause) we run this town
[x2]
