So you say you like the way I look
So you say you like the way I look
When I fall and no one's there to catch me
So you say you like the way I move
So you say you like the way I move
Into every storm I see above me
'Cause everybody's doing what they like
And what they like is not enough for me
I do not feel the same
Here we go 'cause

Tell me why we always sweat it
Everybody wants more but they never get it
Tell me why we always sweat it
Everybody wants more
(everybody wants everybody)
Tell me why we always sweat it
Everybody wants more but they never get it
Tell me why we always sweat it
Everybody wants more
(and everybody wants more)

What you want is never what you get
Here comes the wall, better lower your head
What you want is never what you get
You're going to fast

So you say you like the way I move
So you say you like the way I move
Into every storm I see above me

Breaker breaker one two
Break out to break through
You can swim slash drift where the tides take you
It's about your attitude
Extension of your latitude
Rejection of gratitude
What up, whatcha thinking dude?
Who said every day's gonna be fun?
Keep an eye on the web
Other people have spun
Who said every day's gonna be fun?
Best recognize or betcha you'll come undone

'Cause everybody's doing what they like
And what they like is not enough for me
I do not feel the same
Here we go 'cause

Tell me why we always sweat it
Everybody wants more but they never get it
Tell me why we always sweat it
Everybody wants more
(everybody wants everybody)
Tell me why we always sweat it
Everybody wants more but they never get it
Tell me why we always sweat it
Everybody wants more
(and everybody wants more)

What you want is never what you get
Here comes the wall, better lower your head
What you want is never what you get
You're going to fast

Grit your teeth, this is gonna be a bumpy ride
Loud and clear
Hi-fi, lo-fi
Hand fist, shape shifts to electrify
Sure enough showing up trying to climb sky high

Tell me why we always sweat it
Everybody wants more but they never get it
Tell me why we always sweat it
Everybody wants more
(everybody wants everybody)
Tell me why we always sweat it
Everybody wants more but they never get it
Tell me why we always sweat it
Everybody wants more
(and everybody wants more)
Tell me why we always sweat it
Everybody wants more but they never get it
Tell me why we always sweat it
Everybody wants more
(everybody wants everybody)
Tell me why we always sweat it
Everybody wants more but they never get it
Tell me why we always sweat it
Everybody wants more
(everybody wants more)

What you want is never what you get
Everybody wants more
What you want is never what you get
And everybody wants more
