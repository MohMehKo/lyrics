Well I'm half-dead, lying in a ditch
Life can be like a son of a bitch
I gotta know
Go
Say it ain't so
Hold on tight, know when to let go
Stick 'em up
Stick 'em up
Life is a hold-up
Taking what you got
And smoking what you rolled up
Taking every opportunity to watch you fold up
Stick 'em up kid
Stick 'em up kid

Hey
Why can't you see?
Life is the enemy
One foot out the door
Can't take it anymore
Hey
Why can't you see?
Life is the enemy
One foot out the door
Can't take it anymore

Yeah nothing's gonna stop me
Nothing's gonna drag me down
Yeah nothing's gonna stop me
I'll see you on the way back down
The way back down

Well I'm brain dead, wasting my time
Can't stop now going outta my mind
I gotta know
Go
Say it ain't so
Lost my grip but I'll never let go
Give it up
Give it up
This is a shake down
Building up your hopes
Just to watch 'em fall around
Breaking every branch, bust you up when ya hit the ground
Give it up kid
Give it up kid cuz

Hey
Why can't you see?
Life is the enemy
One foot out the door
Can't take it anymore
Hey
Why can't you see?
Life is the enemy
One foot out the door
Can't take it anymore

Yeah nothing's gonna stop me
Nothing's gonna drag me down
Yeah nothing's gonna stop me
I'll see you on the way back down

I heard you, shut up
I'm way too fed up
A trap got set up
Light it up, here we go
The ground just let up
It's tough to get up
Life throws you, step up
Light it up, light it up
You're dreamin', wake up
Don't fracture, break up
The structure, shake up
Light it up, here we go
I heard you, shut up
I'm way too fed up
A trap got set up
Light it up, here we go

[Solo]

Yeah nothing's gonna stop me
Nothing's gonna drag me down
Yeah nothing's gonna stop me
I'll see you on the way back down

Yeah nothing's gonna stop me
Nothing's gonna drag me down
Yeah nothing's gonna stop me
I'll see you on the way back down

Ya the way back down
