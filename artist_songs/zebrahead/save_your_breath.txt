I swear that I'm okay
Selfish bastard
You're falling faster than me (I'll take all of the blame)
Such a new disaster 
Come in last and then bleed (I swear that I'm okay)
Don't waste your time
Say goodbye
You can't save me (cos no matter what you say I can't get away cos)
I'm my own worst enemy

I'm a total fuckup
You're total fuckup
Everyone I know is fucked up too
Everybody shut up
Don't you wanna give up
Everybody else is just like you
I'm a total fuckup
You're total fuckup
Don't you wanna be a fuckup too?

I'll throw it all away
Break me down
Got me crawling on my knees (I close both eyes to aim)
Nothing lasts
Ashes, pixels and debris (I'll throw it all away)
Just save your breath
Don't need to lie
It's on me (no matter what you say I can't get away cos)
I'm my own worst enemy

I'm a total fuckup
You're total fuckup
Everyone I know is fucked up too
Everybody shut up
Don't you wanna give up
Everybody else is just like you
I'm a total fuckup
You're total fuckup
Don't you wanna be a fuckup too?

I can't trust me
My thoughts are rusty
The way I fuck it up
Man it's really a must see
Weak wrists and my veins are crusty
Cheap tricks
Motivation is dusty
Heading nowhere
So I pull the wheel
As I go through the windshield 
Of my automobile
No matter what ya say
I can't get away 'cos
I'm my own worst enemy

Don't you wanna be a fuckup

I'm a total fuckup
You're total fuckup
Everyone I know is fucked up too
Everybody shut up
Don't you wanna give up
Everybody else is just like you
I'm a total fuckup
You're total fuckup
Don't you wanna be a fuckup too?
