Kill the status quo
Take the long shot
Like a stones throw
From a blood clot
Check the sick flow
Give ya gut rot
And if ya don't know
My eyes are blood shot
Fuck a clean break
We're goin' insane
Up on a hand shake
Low on the food chain
Turn the wheel hard
Into the fast lane
Microphone scarred
With our blood stains
Take it back
Take it back
Here comes the pain

We are the kings of the here and now
We are the fallen, the lost and the found
We start a riot but don't make a sound
We are the kings of the here and now
Go!

Try to hitch a ride
Are you friend or foe?
Keep it all in stride
Push it down below
Got an axe to grind
Go blow by blow
Like we're going blind
Lets start the show
Take a double take
We will check our disdain
Caught up in the wake
Future down the drain
Is it real or fake?
Go against the grain
Crash into mistakes
Like a freight train
Take it back
Take it back
Here comes the pain

We are the kings of the here and now
We are the fallen, the lost and the found
We start a riot but don't make a sound
We are the kings of the here and now
Go!

We've had enough of it
We never take no shit
And we will never quit
We won't go away
We cross the thin red line
And we never waste no time
We won't be left behind
We won't go away

Fuck a clean break
We're goin' insane
Up on a hand shake
Low on the food chain
Turn the wheel hard
Into the fast lane
Microphone scarred
With our blood stains
Take it back
Take it back
Here comes the pain

We are the kings of the here and now
We are the fallen, the lost and the found
We start a riot but don't make a sound
We are the kings of the here and now
Go!

We've had enough of it
We never take no shit
And we will never quit
We won't go away
We cross the thin red line
And we never waste no time
We won't be left behind
We won't go away

We are the kings of the here and now
We are the fallen, the lost and the found
We start a riot but don't make a sound
We are the kings of the here and now
Go!

We are the kings of the here and now
We are the fallen, the lost and the found
We start a riot but don't make a sound
We are the kings of the here and now
Go!
