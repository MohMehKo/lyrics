Mother told me, yes she told me
I'd meet girls like you
She also told me stay away
You'll never know what you'll catch
Just the other day I heard
Of a soldier's falling off
Some Indonesian junk
That's going 'round

Mommy's alright, Daddy's alright
They just seem a little weird
Surrender, surrender
But don't give yourself away

Father says your mother's right
She's really up on things
Before we married Mommy served
On the WACs in the Philippines
Now I had heard the WACs recruited
Old maids for the war
But Mommy isn't one of those
I've known her all these years

Mommy's alright, Daddy's alright
They just seem a little weird
Surrender, surrender
But don't give yourself away

Whatever happened to all this season's
Losers of the year
Every time I got to thinking
Then they disappear
When I woke up, Mom and Dad
Were fuckin' on the couch
Rolling numbers, rock and rolling
Got my Kiss records oout

Mommy's alright, Daddy's alright
They just seem a little weird
Surrender, surrender
But don't give yourself away
Away..........
