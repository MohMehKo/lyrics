Goodbye miss misery
She waved her last goodbye
Headed for her brand new life
I'm not gonna miss you miss you
A comical tragedy
I gave you all the time
All the space that you'd ever need
I'm not gonna miss you miss you

Throw another one back
Drink to new beginnings
To the end of the line
And to you always winning
Watch our future fade to black
And the love lost thinning
Left a thorn in your side
You left my head still spinning

I'm not gonna miss you
And I'm not gonna miss you
Saying these five words to you
Will be the best thing that I ever do
Cause I'm not gonna miss you
I'm not gonna miss you

Goodbye miss misery
You told me not to beg
But now you're on your needs
I'm not gonna miss you miss you
You said love would rescue me
Here's your time here's your space
Here's your personal guarantee
I'm not gonna miss you miss you

Throw another one back
Drink to new beginnings
To the end of the line
And to you always winning
Watch our future fade to black
And the love lost thinning
Left a thorn in your side
You left my head still spinning

So goodbye
Is this how you imagined it?
If you're not down with it
You can bitch on the internet

Burn baby burn as I inhale the smoke
And you can justify your ways as I'm starting to choke
Cuz ya love to take your time when ya got your heel on my throat
Now I'm a good for nothing piece of shit
That's all she wrote
