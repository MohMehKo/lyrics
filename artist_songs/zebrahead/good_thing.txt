I don't believe a word you say
(Just say) Now we're waiting
I can't compete with you today
(Just say) That don't fuckin' phase me
I got more backbone so I guess that you can bring it on
I do not want a chance to show that I can tear it apart
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop staring at me
Stop staring

Take another stand, take your place and get high
Everybody's doing it and so am I
All I wanted were the good things, whoa
Give another day give a piece of my mind
Everybody's doing it so why can't I
All I wanted were the good things

It's so good okay I don't care what they all say
It's just another day, what a waste what a waste
She was in a movie, they'll just be getting booed
He's not like them, just like me
Keeping us from taking my fast Chevrolet
All I got to say what a waste, what a waste.
Just like every movie, another nervous fool
He's not like them, just like me
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop staring at me.
Stop staring

Leave it up to me, leave it up to me, leave it up to (up to me)
Leave it up to me, leave it up to me, leave it up to (up to me)
Leave it up to me, leave it up to me, leave it up to (up to me)
Leave it up to me, leave it up to me, leave it up to (up to me, yeah)

Take another stand, take your place and get high
Everybody's doing it and so am I
All I wanted were the good things
Give another day get a piece of my mind
Everybody's doing it so why can't I
All I wanted were the good things
The good things
