And all we really want
And all we really need
Is all right here
It's all I'll ever need

With a switchblade knife
Backs against the wall
Standing up we fight
Like a wrecking ball
Tossed outta sight
More lost than found
Strangers of the night
We're the underground

Better off dead we're the wounded and bled
Cuz the lies we were fed left us hanging by a thread
See the road up ahead is wearing right through the tread
Wish the skin that we shed shined like armour instead

From glass houses they cast their stones
To shatter and break our bones
Left us to fight for a place of our own

And all we really want
And all we really need
Is all right here
It's all I'll ever need
And all we really want
And all we really need
Is all right here
It's all I'll ever
All I'll ever need

With some broken glass
Writing's on the wall
Standing up we fight
Like a fireball
Left outta sight
Lights of downtown
Strangers of the night
We're the underground

Come on this is not a test this is civil unrest
So S.O.S as we fall down they can care less
A pressure pressed like a ten ton weight on the chest
They left a mess and an emptiness now
We're up next

Blood shot eyes keep the dream alive
Everybody rally round the battle cry
In the midnight sky watching trains go by
Everybody rally round the battle cry
