Here she comes again
Like good medicine
Every step she takes
My blood is flowin’
Her legs go on and on for days

She’s got a hold on me
I need the remedy
Just to hold her would
Be a cure for me
I can’t keep goin’ on this way

She’s at the top of her game
She know's nobody's name
The future’s lookin bleak
She’s outa my league
Look out
She’ll tear your heart out
Look out
She’ll rock your world there’s no doubt
She comes and goes when she wants to
I’d do anything she wanted me to
Who would blame me, legs like that

Here she comes again
She makes me wanna sin
My heart stops when I think about her coming
Her legs go on and on for days

She’s gotta hold on me
It’s a tragedy
That I will never get the chance to have her close to me
When she moves she takes my breath away

She’s at the top of her game
She don’t know my name
The future’s lookin bleak
She’s outa my league
Look out
She’ll tear your heart out
Look out
She’ll rock your world there’s no doubt
She comes and goes when she wants to
I’d do anything she wanted me to
Who would blame me legs like that

She’s breakin me down
She’s everywhere that I wanna go
Breakin me down
She gets me high when I’m feelin low
She’s breakin me down
She’s on the move like a rolling stone
Breakin me down
Just one look cuts me to the bone

She’s like that
Like that
She’s like that
Like that

Look out
She’ll tear your heart out
Look out
She’ll rock your world there’s no doubt
She comes and goes when she wants to
I’d do anything she wanted me to
Who would blame me with legs like that

She moves and she moves and she moves
She moves and she grooves and she moves
She moves and she moves and she moves
She moves and she grooves with legs like that
She moves and she moves and she moves
She moves and she grooves and she moves
She moves and she moves and she moves
She moves and she grooves with legs like that
With legs like that
With legs like that
With legs like that
With legs like that
