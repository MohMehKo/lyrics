You are my leading lady and I really wanted 
to say that you have some fine moves baby I hope that we can
Groove again someday and I can't forget 
the days when we danced all our troubles away

Fly daze, coming in waves
And the time rolls but disco remains
And the guys do it up with Travolta flair 
and all the girls got Farah Fawcett's hair
Where nothing will compare to the Huggy Bear style 
and the Bee Gee's drop the bomb that makes you go wild
And you get what you need on love boats bays 
where your soul is complete cause these are fly days

Fly daze, coming in waves
And the time rolls but disco remains
And Shaggy fights crime on a scooby snack 
so get down tonight shake your booty make contact
Cause DJ's kick down like Grand Master Flash 
and Chrissy smoked up all of Jack Tripper's hash
Where Bosley sneaks a peak as the angels 
play and your soul is set free cause these are fly days
