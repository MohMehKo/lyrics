Shut up 
I'm not like you 
Back off 
Don't smother me 
Fuck this 
I see through you 
Suffer me through 
Shut up I'm not like you [x3]
Suffer me through
Type a Fly away Don't lie 
I won't let you get the best of me [x3]
If I try, if I try 
Oh god 
I can't stand you 
Disappoint you 
With me 
One day you'll come down too 
Suffer me through 
[Repeat Chorus]
