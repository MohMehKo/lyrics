We got a bad case of no motivation
Another dose of we lost control
Whoa-oh
Bleed battling
Voices calling
Get up
Strike like a cannon ball
Whoa-oh
We've got a shit load of no concentration
Another shot of we lost it all
Whoa-oh
Unraveling
Asleep we're falling
Wake up
Reach for a ledge to hold
Whoa-oh

But I'm not going down, not going down, not going down without a fight
I'm not going down, not going down, not going down without a fight
Try to cut me down to size
I'm not going down, not going down, not going down without a fight

We got a problem and don't know the answer
Another glitch in the radio
Whoa-oh
Scene scattering
Our skin is crawling
Give up
Our eyes go to poison glow
Whoa-oh
We got a one-way ticket to destruction
Another crime scene in stereo
Whoa-oh
Pressure hammerin'
Clutch is stallin'
The lies
Crammin' it down our throats
Whoa-oh

But I'm not going down, not going down, not going down without a fight
I'm not going down, not going down, not going down without a fight
Try to cut me down to size
I'm not going down, not going down, not going down without a fight

Try to push me under like I'm coming all teeth and no bite
You try and pull on me
You try and pull on me
I got your fuckin number I wont hesitate to make these wrongs right
You got no hold on me
You got no hold on me

I'm not going down, not going down, not going down without a fight
Not going down, not going down, not going down

I'm not going down, not going down, not going down without a fight
Not going down, not going down, not going down without a fight
Try to cut me down to size
I'm not going down, not going down, not going down without a fight
