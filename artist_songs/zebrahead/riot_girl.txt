Here she comes, T-minus 3
Watch your back
Walk around the debris
Light the fuse
and if you're ready come on

She's my riot girl
She's my riot girl

Is it something that she might've just missed
Is it something that she can hit with her fists?
Light the fuse
and if you're ready come on
She's my riot girl

She's no steppingstone
She'll cut you to the bone
You're better off alone
When she's on, she's on!

Whoa-oh Whoa-oh
She's no minor threat
She's no minor threat
She's been bruised and bled
Whoa-oh Whoa-oh
She's no minor threat
She's no minor threat
She says love is dead
Whoa-oh Whoa-oh
She's hanging on by a thread
Take your crimes in stride and commit

There she goes smoking TNT
Down the hatch
Call the LAPD
Either way, she wants to riot come on
She's my riot girl
She's my riot girl
Give her something and she'll try to resist
Give her something she'll just swing with her fists
Either way, she wants to riot come on

She's my riot girl
She's my riot girl
She's no steppingstone
She'll cut you to the bone
You're better off alone
When she's on
She's on!

Whoa-oh Whoa-oh
She's no minor threat
She's no minor threat
She's been bruised and bled
Whoa-oh Whoa-oh
She's no minor threat
She's no minor threat
She says love is dead
Whoa-oh Whoa-oh
She's hanging on by a thread
Take your crimes in stride and commit

She's standing on the front line
Says she wants to light the fuse
Says that this is my life
It should be my right to choose
She's standing on the front line
Says she wants to light the fuse
Says that this is my life
It should be my right to choose
She only wants to burn it down
She wants to see them go , she don't need them
Send it right back into the ground
She says it a violent world, a violent world
leave you with all the bodies around
She's my riot girl
she's such a riot

She's no steppingstone
She'll cut you to the bone
You're better off alone
When she's on, she's on!

Whoa-oh Whoa-oh
She's no minor threat
She's no minor threat
She's been bruised and bled
Whoa-oh Whoa-oh
She's no minor threat
She's no minor threat
She says love is dead
Whoa-oh Whoa-oh
She's no minor threat
She's no minor threat
But she's seeing red
She's hanging on by a thread
Take your crimes in stride and commit
