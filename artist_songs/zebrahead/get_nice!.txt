A cheap thrill, new pill
Take a ride
I like it
It's a fresh kill, keep still
I'm on your side
I like it
It's all uphill, that shit'll make you cry
I like it
If you fly I'll buy
If you do I'll die

And we can hit the ground running til we start to bleed
And stay up all night, never fall asleep
If the world caves in, just count to 3
Go 1, 2, 3... Go

Somebody stop this world from spinning
Cause we're never giving in
And I can't stop from believing
We will rise again
Somebody stop this world from spinning
Cause we're never caving in
And I can't stop from believing
We will all rise up again

A new wave, nice save
Start a fight
I like it
It's a close shave, misbehave
And go all night
I like it
You're an enclave, so brave
Wound so tight
I like it
If you try, I'll try
If you do, I'll die

And we can hit the ground running til we cannot see
And party all night never fall asleep
If the walls cave in just count to 3
Go 1, 2, 3... Go

If you lose heart
Then you got to pull yourself up
A brand new start
When everything tensed up
Can't break apart
When you really get a sense that
You are not alone
Cuz I can hold on
If you throw your hands up
It won't be long
If you throw your hands up
We can prove them wrong
If you throw your hands up
