Set it off
No stopping me
Set it off
No stopping me
Waiting for another let down while
I'm lying wasted
Set it off
No stopping me
Set it off
No stopping me
Try to make the case I'm numb
From all the lies I tasted
Set it off
No stopping me
Set it off
No stopping me
Lashing out at last
cuz I wanna know what hate is
Set it off
No stopping me
Set it off
No stopping me
Looking out for a number one
And stepping on the faceless

Whoa...
Yeah! We're the wasted generation
Whoa...
On a permanent vacation

Set it off
No stopping me
Set it off
No stopping me
The havoc I can wreak slow to speak
I'm so spineless
Set it off
No stopping me
Set it off
No stopping me
Prey upon the weak and shame the freaks
I'm so mindless

Whoa...
Yeah! We're the wasted generation
Whoa...
On a permanent vacation

Set it off
No stopping me
Set it off
No stopping me
Embrace the doom and gloom
In my room, I hide with cowardice
Set it off
No stopping me
Set it off
No stopping me
Devour and consume
I leave nothing for the powerless

Whoa...
Yeah! We're the wasted generation
Whoa...
On a permanent vacation
