Breakin' in on out
check it out
yo, kick it!

Panic attacks
you never relax
a thermal detonation
anxiety, lobotomy another aggravation
we're on the verge of collapse
a body cast
drink it all in while it lasts
(breakin' in on out
check it out
yo, kick it!)
just another mistake
caught in the wake
can't tell what's real and what is fake
(breakin' in on out
check it out
yo, kick it!)

Same old shit
but to me it doesn't matter at all

Yeah we're all alright now 
but everything's all
messed up fucked up
you can't save us now
yeah we're all alright now
but everything's all
messed up fucked up
world keeps spinning round round round
everybody go

Knife in our backs
distorting the facts
a dying generation
society and anarchy
another irritation
Well we're drowning in waste
take a taste
ain't no shame in saving face
(breakin' in on out
check it out
yo, kick it!)
can't catch a break
no escape 
sex, lies and audiotape
(breakin' in on out
check it out
yo, kick it!)

Same old shit
but to me it doesn't matter at all

Yeah we're all alright now 
but everything's all
messed up fucked up
you can't save us now
yeah we're all alright now
but everything's all
messed up fucked up
world keeps spinning round round round
everybody go

It slams around
puts you down
tryin' to grab a hold
got no pot to piss in
don't you listen
to what you've been a told
now we're disappointed
broken jointed
freezing in the cold
life's a cheap trick
kind of a dick and
wants to watch ya fold but
so don't, don't look back
pressures all around
we're fallin', fallin' off track
it's all breaking down
it's calling, calling to attack
the world spinning round
we won't, we won't, we won't crack

Yeah we're all alright now 
but everything's all
messed up fucked up
you can't save us now
yeah we're all alright now
but everything's all
messed up fucked up
world keeps spinning round round round
everybody go
