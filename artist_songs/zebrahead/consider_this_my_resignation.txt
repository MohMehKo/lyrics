Cause I have
Why have us myself can't
Be somebody else
I never wanna be like
I never wanna be like you

Helpless job, take the big jab
Another thing another battle like a shit prom
Fall in a crib size in the free fall
Devils in the DJ score in call
Cut me down to size, break the ties
Fucking lies, fucking lies
Crash into machine
Pull into break me by own scream
Show me what you made off
(What you made off)
Show me what you made off!

Cause I am
I don't lose myself can't
Be somebody else
I never wanna be like you
(Whoa-oh whoa-oh!)
(Whoa-oh whoa-oh!)
Yeah, I can't
Leave this way, I don't care
What you said and I
I never wanna be
I never wanna be like you

Help me yo', look the bijou
Pull me in the school on cannon ball
Breaking my bones into the wall
Devil in here if you was me crawl
Catch it my demise, fucking lies
Fucking lies, alibis
Destroy all you see
Who let you break me by own scream
Show me what you made off
(What you made off)
Show me what you made off!

Cause I am
I don't lose myself can't
Be somebody else
I never wanna be like you
(Whoa-oh whoa-oh!)
(Whoa-oh whoa-oh!)
Yeah, I can't
Leave this way, I don't care
What you said and I
I never wanna be
I never wanna be like you

Whit my hand and life
So just supersize
Consider this my resignation!
With you wants collided
Cut me size or not
Callin kill by sociation
(No, no like you!)

Show me what you made off!
(What you made off)
Show me what you made off!
(What you made off)
Show me what you made off!!
(What you made off)
Show me what you made off!!!

Cause I am
I don't lose myself can't
Be somebody else
I never wanna be like you
(Whoa-oh whoa-oh!)
(Whoa-oh whoa-oh!)
Yeah, I can't
Leave this way, I don't care
What you said and I
I never wanna be
I never wanna be like you
