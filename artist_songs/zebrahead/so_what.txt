Waking up - another day to elevate
Eyes makin' figure eights, a hung over golden state
Rebel radio - through the stereo
Punk rock scenario telling me to let it go
Cuz when it feels like everyone's against me
Cops wanna frisk me and no one wants to kiss me
I stay up high so I'm floating like a ghost
And I make another toast to the coast with the most

So what
If there's a change in the weather
So what
If it doesn't get better
So what
If the loving ain't free
Cause I'm happy right here in the California breeze
[x2]

Skate around on the town with the summer set
Bummin' on a cigarette, hum like a turbo jet
On a plateau, I forgot to pass go
Kickin' it downtown ended up in the gallows
But when it feels like tomorrow's looking risky
The pressure's gonna twist me
And cynics come to diss me
I stay up high so I'm floating like a ghost
And I make another toast to the coast with the most

So what
If there's a change in the weather
So what
If it doesn't get better
So what
If the loving ain't free
Cause I'm happy right here in the California breeze
[x2]

Waking up - another day to elevate
Eyes makin' figure eights
A hung over golden state
I stay up high so I'm floating like a ghost
And I make another toast to the coast with the most

So what
If there's a change in the weather
So what
If it doesn't get better
So what
If the loving ain't free
Cause I'm happy right here in the California breeze
