READY STEADY CAN'T HOLD ME BACK
READY STEADY GIVE ME GOOD LUCK
READY STEADY NEVER LOOK BACK
LET'S GET STARTED READY STEADY GO

The scenery is being blown away as if it's rolling forward
Despite my desperation I won't miss my target

It'd be fine if this useless map were to burn to ash
Because I'd grab the buried truth in the palm of this hand

I came running through -quickly- in a total blur
My loud pulse throbs so violently it could rip me apart
Your voice -yelling- and resounding
There's simply no time to stop and stand around here READY STEADY GO

Even if I carry these countless scars with me
Quickly or softly, either way you aren't getting my soul

If I met with you on the other side of that hill
What should we talk about? I only think of that experience

I came running through -quickly- in a total blur
My loud pulse throbs so violently it could rip me apart
Your voice -yelling- and resounding
There's simply no time to stop and stand around here READY STEADY GO

READY STEADY CAN'T HOLD ME BACK
READY STEADY GIVE ME GOOD LUCK
READY STEADY NEVER LOOK BACK
LET'S GET STARTED READY STEADY GO

My heart -races- beneath that sky
I can't stop my racing senses from shouting out
I must -reach- you, surely just a little further
The hot rays of the sun reflect the other side of this path READY STEADY GO
PLEASE. TRUST ME
