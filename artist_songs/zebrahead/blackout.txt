Whoa-oh-oh
We will not break but we might bend
Whoa-oh-oh
I'll see you at the bitter end

Realize I've got nothing for you
Got blood on my hands
Yeah pain is a virtue
Understand that I'll do anything
Not to let you get the best of me
So tell me what you're gonna do

Blackout
Living in a blackout
Trying to rip your heart out
Shout out
Go get it
Go get it
Strung out
You can scream your lungs out
It's getting late it's dark out
You can scream your lungs out
Break out
Go get it
Go get it

Fuck your barcode
Time to go at it alone
We won't take it just to live to die another day
Kill the download
We're better off on our own
We won't take it just to live to die another day

We all fall down but we get back up
We all break down but we build it up
And we won't break but we might bend
We all fall down but we get back up
We all want more never get enough
We will not break but we might bend
See you at the bitter end

Realize what's given to you
Got lines on your face
Yeah scars are a tattoo
Understand that I'll do anything
Not to let you get the best of me
So tell me what you're gonna do

Blackout
Dying in a blackout
Crying both your eyes out
Break out
Go get it
Go get it
Burn out
Before you even start out
Falling down with no doubt shout out
Go get it
Go get it

Fuck your barcode
Time to go at it alone
We won't take it just to live to die another day
Kill the download
We're better off on our own
We won't take it just to live to die another day

We all fall down but we get back up
We all break down but we build it up
And we won't break but we might bend
We all fall down but we get back up
We all want more never get enough
We will not break but we might bend
See you at the bitter end

We all go spiraling down
We're losing valuable ground
Caught in the middle of dogfight
Hold tight now
Turn down the lights and don't blink
Hate to shudder to think
They're pulling back to attack
Got the kids screaming
Blackout
Living in a blackout
Trying to rip your heart out
Shout out
Go get it
Go get it
Strung out
You can scream your lungs out
It's getting late it's dark out
You can scream your lungs out
Break out
Go get it
Go get it

Whoa-oh-oh
We will not break but we might bend
Whoa-oh-oh
I'll see you at the bitter end

We all fall down but we get back up
We all break down but we build it up
And we won't break but we might bend
We all fall down but we get back up
We all want more never get enough
We will not break but we might bend
See you at the bitter end

See you at the bitter end
See you at the bitter end
