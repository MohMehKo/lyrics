You got to go loco, this ain't no joke yo
Too much hype on the television and radio
What you want to buy and what you want to be
'Cause what you want is right there on the TV screen
And you be down with what they're selling
MTV got everybody yellin'
Get off
Get off on it
Get off on what you want when you want it

Running and running through my head
They tell you it was good forever
But I know that it's now or never

These times are trying, kid ain't lying
'Cause everyone's got someting to sell when you're buying
What you want to look like and what you want to be
'Cause what you want is right there on the TV screen
And you be down with what they're selling
MTV got everybody yellin'
Get off
Get off on it
Get off on what you want when you want it

[Chorus]

Get off
Get off on it
Get off on what you want when you want it
Take it away from me
