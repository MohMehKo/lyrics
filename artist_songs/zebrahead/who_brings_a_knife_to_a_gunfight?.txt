You're gonna pay the price
Gonna roll the dice
Look on the bright side

Aha, aha, aha, aha!

Won't make it through the night
You bought a knife to a gun fight

Aha, aha, aha, aha!

You bite the belt hard 
And say goodbye to the west coast

Aha, aha, aha, aha!

Pick your poison, kill the noise and
Swallow what you hate the most

Aha, aha, aha, aha!

I wanna party party
We wanna party party
She wants to party party
We wanna party party

Hey! Hey! Hey!

We just wanna fuckin party!

Hey! Hey! Hey!

We just wanna fuckin party!

You got a lot to prove
Gonna make your move into the Spot Light

Aha, aha, aha, aha!

Always want to make it last
Falling fast breaking midnight

Aha, aha, aha, aha!

You lock the door alone
While you're feeding on your last post

Aha, aha, aha, aha!

You lick your wrist and blow a kiss
And cut in line to be a ghost

Aha, aha, aha, aha!

I wanna party party
We wanna party party
She wants to party party
We wanna party party

Hey! Hey! Hey!

We just wanna fuckin party!

Hey! Hey! Hey!

We just wanna fuckin party!

I wanna party party
We wanna party party
She wants to party party
We wanna party party
[x2]

Hey! Hey! Hey!

We just wanna fuckin party!

Hey! Hey! Hey!

We just wanna fuckin party!
