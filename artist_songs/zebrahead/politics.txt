Firewall, school halls, cop cars protecting
You are lying, buying everything they're feeding you 
My brother has a boss 
He searches with a cause 
They say your generation is lost,
But I can hear the boys (GO) and girls (GO), 
We are alive, boys (GO) and girls (GO), 
We are alive, boys (GO) and girls (GO), 
We are alive, boys (GO) and girls (GO), 

What about you?!
The politics of you!
The politics!

Oh life, with eyes wide open 
Defy, we can't be broken
Their lies, they must be choking
Take the politics of you and I just throw it all away 

Anarchy, energy, melody, 
Y&#65533;all got a voice so scream out loud and make a choice, 
And no cover has a cost, 
You've been double crossed, 
They say your generation is lost 
But I can hear the boys (GO) and girls (GO), 
We are alive, boys (GO) and girls (GO), 
We are alive, boys (GO) and girls (GO), 
We are alive, boys (GO) and girls (GO),

What about you?!
The politics of you!
The politics!

Oh life, with eyes wide open. 
Defy, we can't be broken. 
Their lies, they must be choking, 
Take the politics of you and I just throw it all away 

The politics of you (This was for the lost cause) 
The politics of you (Live with all the have-nots) 
The politics of you (Get ready for the onslaught) 
The politics of YOU!

Oh life, with eyes wide open. 
Defy, we can't be broken. 
Their lies, they must be choking, 
Take the politics of you and I just throw it all away
