I'm a mad man with a mission
Like a nightmare
Double visioned
This is warfare
Fell the kick drum
We be shining
Killin' redrum

Lock and loaded
Pull the trigger
In this movement
Growin' bigger
Burn the blueprint
Kill the silence
With a new spin
This is violence

Yeah
We are out of control now
I'll never act a role like you
Bring on the noise and shout out loud
We are out of control now

Ready for the game we're all going crazy
Come on just try to amaze me
No doubt we're out of control
But it feels right now free from the soul

Lock and loaded
Pull the trigger
In the movement
Growing bigger
Burn the blueprint
Go kill the silence
With a new spin
I'll show you what's violence

Yeah
Bring on the noise and shout out loud
We are out of control now

We are the ones that will stand up and fight
We are the fire the one shining light
Don't try and stop us don't ever let go
We are the ones fallen out of control

Yeah we're loaded
Now in line
With our fury so divine
Watch out cause here comes the sign

Take em all down and feel yourself roam
Shout it out loud the words of your own
Not anymore with their cheapest disguise
Had enough with all of that "likewise"

Yeah
Bring on the noise and shout out loud
We are out of control now

Stop the bleeding
Kill the headlights
Keep on speeding to the gun fight
Let the bass go
Can't be broken
Keep your head low
Stop the choking

Slice the track up
Clean incision
Never back up
No division
Burn the blueprint
Kill the silence
We are out of control

Yeah
Bring on the noise and shout out loud
We are out of control now

We are the ones that will stand up and fight
We are the fire the one shining light
Don't try and stop us don't ever let go
We are the ones fallen out of control

(Nah Nah Nah)

We are the ones that will stand up and fight
We are the fire the one shining light
Don't try and stop us don't ever let go
We are the ones fallen out of control

We are the ones that will stand up and fight
We are the fire the one shining light
Don't try and stop us don't ever let go
We are the ones fallen
We are the ones fallen out of control
