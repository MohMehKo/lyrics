I've got some oil and some matches 
You know i would do anything for you 
So whether for light or for ashes 
All of us burn for something 

The greatest risk, the greatest wonder 

Some of the time we are stolen 
Most of us live our lives as thieves 
So how could you know that i could be trusted? 
How could you know that i just know that i won't leave? 

Always waiting for someone to be sure 
Always praying that we'll be ready for 

The greatest wish, the going under 
The greatest risk the greates wonder 

You cannot give somebody joy 
But you can find it by trying 
You cannot save someone from death 
But you can love them while theyre dying 

Always waiting for someone to be sure 
Always praying that we'll be ready for 
Yeah i'm ready! 
So give me something pure 
The bravest wish, the going under 
The greatest risk, the greatest wonder
