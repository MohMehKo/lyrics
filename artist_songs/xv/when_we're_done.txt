[Hook:]
Not everybody lives, but everybody dies
So while a nigga here, I'm shooting for the sky
Landing on the moon, walking on the sun
Taking over the game, give it back when we done

Not everybody lives, but everybody dies
So while a nigga here, I'm shooting for the sky
Landing on the moon, walking on the sun
Taking over the game, give it back when we done, I'll give it back when we done

[Verse 1: XV]
Uh! 10 Thousand hands in the air, have you ever seen
Work 9 to 5 or 5 to 9, do you ever dream?
They in the red, but my sock is green
Proud like I've reached the clouds, fall of a beam
Dreams all lucid, films on Lucas, sound on surround and the crowd on stupid
Who that chick Dion, that's Dion on clueless
You suck around the money, sittin' in a?

Feel the dreams, They said I'm too corny
Funny I got they ears all on me
Fears all gone and my peers all wrong
So keep your 2 cents and every phrase y'all coin me
That's just common sense, all the hate I honored it
I don't leap, I Quantum it
I don't answer it, I problem it
I just drop shit, while they ask what a colonic is
Pinky you know what I'm pondering?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: XV]
They said I smiled too much to be a-hole, and these girls is too much for me to take home
Bad as Beyonce, could be a fiance, But she way too horny to have a halo
And these niggas ain't on me like I'm a J.Cole
More work for me, just more persons to see
That one day that kid out of Kansas could be a Jay Hov
Cut em I'm slack the same cats that knock the rap
I'm overly optimistic, maybe a dreamchaser
After some things that I've see on screensaver
Turn a lion's den into a king's lair
No wonder they say "Vizzy where you've been player"
Where the wild things are, where the kids wear crowns
When we don't eat supper, we just tear that bitch down
Said we was crowned, but we far from the ground
Crossed all our T's dotted I's

[Hook]

Hands in the air we reaching for something, believing in nothing
But fuck it man, we want everything

Uh-huh, we want everything
Uh-huh, we want everything

Hands in the air we reaching for something, believing in nothing
But fuck it man, we want everything

Uh-huh, we want everything
Uh-huh, we want everything

[Hook x2]
