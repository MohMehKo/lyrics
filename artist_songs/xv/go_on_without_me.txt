[Verse 1:]
We was just friends that would always run wild
Astronaut dreamin' we could never come down
When one night stands lead to a young child
So if we cut 'em always use a hat like Kung Lao
Way before those square dudes came to run round
We was kings of the city, thought we would run towns
Became friends in days, but took years to build it
It's funny how in seconds that all could come down
And it hurts now
We learn how to spit game and get turned down
Hoes got turned out, homies got shermed out
Teachers told us "Quiet down"
We left to burn that loud
And right, I'm learning now
But that's life, it turned out, I was right
Y'all was only about dreamin' when it's convenient
When we got recognized more than the voice of Morgan Freeman
Couldn't force you to make this something you believe in
So I said peace, I'll be leaving screaming

[Hook:]
Go on without me, why you beg me to stay
Good luck with tomorrow, because I'm leaving today
But I wish I could stay
Hey, I'm screaming
Go on without me, why you beg me to stay
Good luck with tomorrow, because I'm leaving today
But I wish I could stay, hey

[Verse 2:]
The metal detectors detected him
While the school districts neglected him
Police Arrested him
Told him he's like the rest of 'em
So gang life accepted him
Real niggas respected him
Real life rejected him
Dreams, that's all that's left of him
They said he showed signs that I didn't take directions from
That was my dawg, damn, I should've protected him
What we said in that parking lot, I should've questioned him
Made sure that his head was right, before I left with him
But it was that day, when his pops went and asked
He would just whoop his ass
For not taking out the trash
I don't know the dialogue, I just heard he got mad
Closed the bathroom door, all they heard was a blast
I'm in the hallway crying
The counselor giving me guidance
Wishing I showed you this life before you went and decided
Could I rewind and find a way to make you stay
And prove, that wasn't the only way
I say

[Hook:]
Go on without me, why you beg me to stay
Good luck with tomorrow, because I'm leaving today
But I wish I could stay
Hey, I'm screaming
Go on without me, why you beg me to stay
Good luck with tomorrow, because I'm leaving today
But I wish I could stay, hey

[Verse 3:]
Where was you when we were getting high
Riding on an L7 jet up in the sky
L.A. for the day, Vegas for the night
Tell me how'd you miss out on all this living life
But I get it right
Everybody get a price and some people afford to pay
In the long run I hope you come up nothing short of great
I just think it's sorta fake and there's probably more to say
But I've been carrying all this weight
That I've been sore all day
And I don't got time to sit and jog around questions
About the niggas I mess with and just who I'm addressing
Cause there's still some confessions
That I got to mail out
That I got to tell bout
Yea, I brought the real out
See, I might showboat but I'll never sell out
So that fuck your circle shit is all I ever yell out
That's what you do when you know your crew
Is tough as boots they fuck with you
You follow them, they don't follow you
So what you do, you told me

[Hook:]
Go on without me, why I beg you to stay
Good luck with tomorrow, because I'm leaving today
But I wish I could stay
Hey, I'm screaming
Go on without me, why you beg me to stay
Good luck with tomorrow, because I'm leaving today
But I wish I could stay, hey
So go on without me
I said, go on without me
Go on without me
I wish I could stay, hey
Go on without me
I said go on without me
Just go on without me
I wish I could stay, hey
