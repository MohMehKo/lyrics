Yeah
Look, Vizzy is a dreamer
And life is a bitch but god forbid if I leave her
Hated in my city since the day that I remeember
But I ain't ever tired of these kids like Angelina
And Brad,
I was a kid like Michael Jackson when I started to be bad
But cleaned it up in 2000 like lever
Either, you can hop around
Or you can turn this up loud and take a glimpse of how I put it
Dow ow ow ow ow ownnn
Finally found my sound, Helen Keller
And I'm taking that food out up yo mouth like Old Yeller
Satisfaction's overrated, I don't agree with failure
So I just kept making heat up in the basement like a cellar
Well uh, pipe down like draino
Just roll into a ball like kano
Cause they know,
I'll die on these tracks chasing perfection like a rainbow
Walking out the bank, smiling face
LMA O O O OOOO

[Chorus:]
I tell you what it is
And everything it isn't
You got a cool ride
I'm saving it for business
You got a lovely wife
I got a bunch of women

Cause that's just part of life
And this is part of livin' [x5]

That's just part of li I I I I've

[Big Sean:]
Big finna drop but it's not 9 7
I think they had enough, hot 9 7
Last real nigga, I am legend
You need inspiration, shit drop in my sessions
Oh that's ya favorite car? I buy it out (cash)
Oh that's ya favorite bitch? I try it out
SWimmin' in ya girl, then she handed me a towel
I said I.O.U like I'm tryna find a vow
And I'm a rock more Bathing Apes then Milo
Champagne by the cases, I don't grab the bottle
Drinks that I can't swallow
Then I throw ups and I feel hollow
My whole crew is takin' off
Man it could've been appolo
13, we ride around in escorts and jettas
I rather have a pilot, escort the jet uh
While you was in ya pj's waiting on shit to take off
I was in the pj, waiting on take off

[Chorus:]
I tell you what it is
And everything it isn't
You got a cool ride
I'm saving it for business
You got a lovely wife
I got a bunch of women

Cause that's just part of life
And this is part of livin' [x5]

That's just part of li I I I I've

[xV:]
And this is part of livin'
Bank account healthy, party with my children
Yo bank account is swayze, no wonder you illin'
I'm getting pages to take a walk around a buildin'
Brilliant, fillin' it the game like space that I'm a fill in it
My dream is to get a team that I could do some millions with
Everyday the MySpace plays, get a million hits
And I walk in the space and show my face
They take a billion pi I I I I ics

For my dream I'm already for it
Tryna see everything like a city tourist
I'm eating all these rappers food,
Show me where's the porridge
Somebody sleepin' in my bed and I swear she's foreign (ha)
So I advise you not to knock,
I give her the business like she just bought out all my stock
I became all the things I was taught not to mock
And when you got your eyes on the green, you told not to
St o o o o op

[Chorus:]
I tell you what it is
And everything it isn't
You got a cool ride
I'm saving it for business
You got a lovely wife
I got a bunch of women

Cause that's just part of life
And this is part of livin' [x5]

That's just part of li I I I I've
