[Verse 1: XV]
Yeah, Vizzy, it's crazy, hahaha
Uh, liquor over ice, livid over life
Better pay attention, before this shit is overpriced
I could handle-bars before I even rode a bike
And if it's quotes that you want, man I meet that quota nice
Looney Tunes the flow, going lunar as a solar night
Time it like a cobra strike, grinding like an overbite
Put it in the air, yeah Vizzy with the soda flight
Tell them lay the pen (pin) down and get X like bowling strikes
Cooler than chewin' polar ice in the South Pole
Going HAM like Pam, knock them out cold
You're so crazy, the crowd goes wild,
Hands go up and down like the Dow Jones
Well hello my dear, my name is Fizzy
I'm a cool rapper, but who is he?
I'm the "who done it", these niggas is "who did it's"
Ask who I am, I say dude listen
Look

[Chorus:]
Tell them how I do this, tell them why they play me
Tell them I guarantee, and tell them why they pay me
Tell them who I am, and tell them who I ain't G
Tell me why you love me, tell me why you hate me
Cause

[Kristina Rose:]
You Fucking Crazy, You Fucking Crazy (I heard that)
You Fucking Crazy, You Fucking Crazy (I heard that)
You Fucking Crazy, You Fucking Crazy (I heard that)
You Fucking Crazy

[Verse 2: XV]
You know I'm on one
Play no games, but on one
Say my name to no one, Lisa play my lonesome
Cause I'm as hot as four suns, Popular as four nuns
Kick that shit like Fee-fi, you spit that shit like Fo-fum
Who you know that come up out that middle state?
Getting props like real estate
Mamma raise an I'll kid, you can call me give-or-great
Don't chill, I'm chilling, come to make a building shake
Don't let me eat, I'm Ricky Henderson, I'll steal a plate
Take whoever you favor and do yourself a favor, man
Don't put my name by their's, put it by a greater than
What's your release date? Why you even making plans?
You niggas brick like Steve Carrel's anchorman
I make a pixie wanna go go get me
Cause you ain't never gonna feel goal, we kick it
So I'm part ridiculous, Eli Porter retarded
Tell them I did it, why they get me started?

[Chorus:]
Tell them how I do this, tell them why they play me
Tell them I guarantee, and tell them why they pay me
Tell them who I am, and tell them who I ain't cheat
Tell me why you love me, tell me why you hate me
Cause

[Kristina Rose:]
You Fucking Crazy, You Fucking Crazy (I heard that)
You Fucking Crazy, You Fucking Crazy (I heard that)
You Fucking Crazy, You Fucking Crazy (I heard that)
You Fucking Crazy

[Verse 3: XV]
Uhh, this is Mark Biller?, J Dilla, Atila the Hun
Go realer on drums, no feeling it's fun
My voice killing these bums, Ted Williams
And should I do it, they say 'yeah kill them'
Ok I do it like I knew I shouldn't
Prove it like they knew I couldn't
Blew up and they said I wouldn't
Nigga is you fucking stupid
The girls loving X, man,
They make him their next man
And ex man 'cause she ain't trying to fuck with mutants
One girl plus one girl, so there ain't nothing to it
Give them my Brett Hart, excellence of execution
FAS the biggest loser, but she saying that she done waited all this time
Now it's time to fucking lose it
She ain't trying to do shit, get that Ciroq in her
No chasing life vents she got an entourage with them
Bring your girl Nicki and we can have a m√©nage (Minaj) with her
She said she untouchable, well I'm Kevin Costner

[Chorus:]
Tell them how I do this, tell them why they play me
Tell them I guarantee, and tell them why they pay me
Tell them who I am, and tell them who I ain't cheat
Tell me why you love me, tell me why you hate me
Cause

[Kristina Rose:]
You Fucking Crazy, You Fucking Crazy (I heard that)
You Fucking Crazy, You Fucking Crazy (I heard that)
You Fucking Crazy, You Fucking Crazy (I heard that)
You Fucking Crazy
XV you fucking crazy, haha, don't laugh at me
