[Intro: XV]
Yeah
We on Squarian?
Hahaha
Yeah

[Verse 1: XV]
What planet did you come from?
With your nails, make-up and hair done
At my show hands up in the sun
Ask her what she's doing when it's done
We're gonna kick it, have a little fun
Played me in Street Fighter 4 and won
Chun Li kicks, hair in a bun, Marvel sweats, All Star Chucks
Watch you smoke, watch you drink
Range or coupe, what you think?
Bra all black, panties pink
I'm a see that by the end of the week
We take it slow I'll take you home
Your moms don't trip cause shit you grown
She said you're gonna let me sleep alone?
I said nah, she said come on

[Chorus:]
I don't know just where you came from
And I need you now (yeah)
If you leave me for the stars
There's something I'd ever allow

Yeah see, I knew she wasn't from here
That's why I called her foreign exchange student
Cause she's like fresh as fuck, Louis Vuitton, Alexander Wang and all that
But at the same time she plays Marvel vs Capcom 3
Listen' to The Pixies religiously and had like a 16 killstreak on Black Ops

[Verse 2: XV]
I don't know your circle circle
But you like this square right here
I know you ex hurt you, hurt you
But don't be scared, be scared
I take you high so high, up in the air, the air
George Clooney cool and I don't Bugs that's Looney Toons
You come back stage my crew is cool
Mass Effect 2 and watch kung-fu
Grabbing these snacks like Scooby Doo
Smoke till your eyes like Lucy Liu
She knows I ball cause she asks for shots
Hit a triple double when I pass the Ciroc
If love is blind than I'm Matt Murdoch
You ain't going home, well I'm glad you not

[Chorus: x2]
'Cause I don't know just where you came from
And I need you now
If you leave me for the stars
There's something I'd ever allow

Yeah so all the ladies or should I say Squarian women out there
This applies to, I wish I could send you some beautiful flowers
Or a teddy bears or something, but I can't
So I'm gonna have awesome sound and play the synth solo
Just for you baby, just for you, check it out

Is that vintage, preferably
Swag, swag, swag, swag
Hahaha,
Yeah

[Chorus: x2]
'Cause I don't know just where you came from
And I need you now
If you leave me for the stars
There's something I'd ever allow
