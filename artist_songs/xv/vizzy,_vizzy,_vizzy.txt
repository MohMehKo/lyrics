[Intro: XV]
Cooler than ya average
Bear with me
You know I got to the studio and I asked the beat if I was dope
You know what it said to me? (What it say?)
Hahaha, yeah! Uh huh
So, I heard you don't know my name

[Verse 1: XV]
My name is Vizzy Vizzy Vizzy Vizzy, X to the V
And I am really really really really feelin' my steeze
What's the dilly silly willy? Is you up on these things?
Cause I'm told I can't fold like the cuff on my jeans
They told me never ever ever give up on your dream
I tell 'em never ever ever will I do such a thing
I have high expectations, so the sky's where I'm facin'
Even broads that I'm datin', gotta succeed
You see I kinda kinda kinda never fit in the scene
The crowds I [?] won't let me in, so I'm out of they ring
Not the hipsters, not the gangsters
Not the skaters, not the ballas
I'm an agoraphobic gamer, myspace a [?]
But I'm comin' comin' comin' comin', out for the night
And I'm up to somethin' somethin' somethin' somethin' flyer than rights...
Brothers, colors as bright
Is that who I think it is?
Tell the kids that they right

[Hook: XV]
Cause when I step up in the spot, they gon' know my name
Cause when I step up in the spot, they gon' know my name
Cause when I step up in the spot, they gon' know my name
Cause when I step up in the spot, they gon' know my name
They gonna, know my name
They gonna, know my name
What is it?

Just call me. Vizzy vizzy vizzy vizzy, X to the V
Just call me. Vizzy vizzy vizzy vizzy, X to the V

[Verse 2: XV]
Check it, check it, check it, check it, check me out
Put on my record, record, record, every time I'm out
Everybody shout, if you know who I be
My name. Vizzy vizzy vizzy vizzy, X to the V
Okay, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen here
I been gettin', gettin', gettin', gettin' this all year
Is it X five or 15? Check my description
I was gettin' creamy, like my krispy
Lil mama, mama, mama, come get with me
Cause I'm a, I'm a, I'm a star make a wish when you see
And I'm the kid with the green
Backpack on my back, haters keep callin' scenes
I'm tryna say it's a wrap
Now am I showin', showin', showin', showin', showin' off?
Cause I'm fly like goin', goin', goin', goin'... gone
I'm just predicting the future
When all these hoes start saying, oh what a super

[Hook: XV]
Cause when I step up in the spot, they gon' know my name
Cause when I step up in the spot, they gon' know my name
Cause when I step up in the spot, they gon' know my name

[Verse 3: XV]
My name's Vizzy vizzy vizzy vizzy, X to the V
I'm like the Jigga, Pac and Biggie of the city I keep
Who would think that the nerd at school
Would be a trendsetter and make a bunch of words sound cool
Absurd yet true, that you're that fool
That couldn't get a kick out of a circus mule
I don't need now hammer to make me hurt this tool
And I ain't Bruce Banner but I make green look cool
Read your manual, it's all automatic
I step up in the spot and drop like roger rabbit
It gets lonely at the top, I guess I'm an attic
Get it? I'm an attic in this haunted house of rappers
Down the hole with the rabbit like Alice
I wonder if the land where I land's got a palace
Cause I wasn't playin' when I was sayin' I'm the king of the city
And my name is XV, but you can call me Vizzy

[Hook: XV]
Cause when I step up in the spot, they gon' know my name
Cause when I step up in the spot, they gon' know my name
Cause when I step up in the spot, they gon' know my name
Cause when I step up in the spot, they gon' know my name
They gonna, know my name
They gonna, know my name
What is it?
Vizzy vizzy vizzy vizzy, X to the V
Just call me. Vizzy vizzy vizzy vizzy, X to the V
Just call me. Vizzy vizzy vizzy vizzy, X to the V
Just call me. Vizzy vizzy vizzy vizzy, X to the V
