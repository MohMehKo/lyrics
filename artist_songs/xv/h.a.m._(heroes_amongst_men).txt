[Verse 1: XV]
Well, here's ya favourite martian
Bill Bixby, I'm lane switching and wheel twisting
Rubber buring, paper rolling, Why y'all kill switching
All about my capital, hold it down, shift keys
Miss me, let's see, I'm Dr Evil, I'd done ball forever
Take it easy cause these niggas will draw on whatever
And rest in Peace to Aaron Hobson
And the nigga ain't violent, but I carry options
These nigga be wylin'
Believe me bro, cold-ass flow is 3 below
And I got it made without a cleaning hoe
No freestyle but this joint is a freebie yo
I dead mic's no CB4, I'm dead nice
You meanies Joe, where do all the heroes go
The genius thing about you is your email bro
CC me with dough that you will forward and I reply with the details yo
But everything else is just considered spam
Throw it in the can when I land cause a nigga going HAM

[Chorus:]
Heroes Amongst Men
Hand me any mic but have your army manned cause
You know I go HAM

Heroes Amongst Men
Hand me any mic but have your army manned cause
You know I go HAM

Heroes Amongst Men
High As A Mountain while I'm flying by the fans
Going HAM
Heroes Amongst Men
Yeah, that's what I am

[Verse 2: XV]
Skinny denim jeans and a fitted low, brim action
All white vans you would think that I'm kidnapping
Lyrics cut deeper than my blades in my hands wrapping
Call that flow Hugh Jackman
Back when I was boom bappin'
Shawty came to say is you moving cause you packin'
What we need to go HAM
A handy cam a few napkins
Don't go slower than dancing to a ballad
Now I wanna Lance like Alice get it dressed up by a stylist
And Mr Chows giving my order the whores who doubt it
Like I heard you blowing up
Vizzy tell me all about it
Well I got a Caesar hit a thousand islands and blue cheese
Can you please at least put some dressing on my salad
Confess and someone tell Clark Kent I'm bout to steal his frame
Flash Gordon shoes and Professor X's planes
Dare Devil sunglasses, spider man first week is what I'm tryna do when I hit the streets
Cause my album Go HAM

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: XV]
Yeah, year of the Squarian
Zeroes that's prepared to win
Heroes we keep burying
Burn up the charts
This is [?] on the violin
Betting on X is like seeing the whole card deck before buying in
So get ya money up, the new cat that be running rap was like a runner up
Guess directions fucked him up
I'm four words that make you bring the track backwards on my tape
And repped him in so heavy that no other sideways
So 316′s up, but I be 619′ing
From off the top they grab the pen and the crowd is wildin'
I make them stand from the floor to the stands
No matter where I am I promise Fam I'm a go HAM

[Chorus]
