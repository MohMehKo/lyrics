[Colin Munroe:]
Hey little miss, greet ya, nice to meet ya
Shall we start a war?
Light it up and let my world collide, with yours
Hey little miss, greet ya, perfect match and make
On paper it's so wrong, but it's so right it must be fate
Never gonna take it back, never gonna let you down
A war like this could turn the world around

[Chorus: Colin Munroe]
This time, no need for missiles
To start a war
No one's loved like this before (before)
No need for missiles, I'm sure
This love is enough,
To start a war
To start a war
To start a war (Vizzy)
To start a war

[xV:]
Ay
She said baby let's make love
I said nah, let's make war
Then I started playing in a bush
But she screwed me out my seat, so I guess I'm gore
Ha, and all that I ask, that
If I take you home tonight I'm planting that flag
Cause you done made peace with my heart
But the whole world feelin' there's bombs over baghdad
And now now let's get oil rich
Enough to make all your ex boyfriends sick
And even though you wind me up
And I march to the beat of your heart,
Don't toy with this

And I just had to find a way to let you know
That if this blows, off the world go

[Chorus: Colin Munroe]
This time, no need for missiles
To start a war
No one's loved like this before (before)
No need for missiles, I'm sure
This love is enough,
To start a war
To start a war
To start a war
To start a war

[Colin Munroe: x2]
Never gonna let you go
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna lose a war
Never gonna turn around

[Chorus: Colin Munroe]
This time, no need for missiles
To start a war
No one's loved like this before (before)
No need for missiles, I'm sure
This love is enough,
To start a war
To start a war
To start a war
To start a war
To start a war
To start a war
To start a war [fading]
