[XV:]
3.30 in the mornin'
Wait is it 3.30 or 4.30?
Different timezones you know
Hahah, yeah
Vizzy, Zone
It's been a minute
But you know we finally made it
So I welcome y'all to the zone

[Verse 1: XV]
Uhh
Headphones blearing loud
I'm in my zone right now
Got a city on my back that I toll with brown
Every city that Vizzy got to go around
And ohh how I hate it cause this scenes
Just make me jaded niggas hatin' I can taste it
Like Mmm that's my favorite give me 2 of those
I been out here doin' shows
I remember when I couldn't even fill the first two rows
I thought I was bout to blow
Guess I didn't go to bed
City of the Lost Boys
They be acting so pretend
Niggas throw their Deuces "Christ"
Cause they gon be my Foe again
I'm behind that super ten
And somehow they know it's him
How can someone so unsocial be so social
I'm way to out-of-here to be so local
Mom tries tellin' me keep your Praise on
And you'll get love at the end like my first name was Face-On
I don't wanna grow old writing rhymes in Crayon
I'm so gone I'm looking for my house on my way home

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
In my mind it sounds like Ooo oo ooo
When I guard it feels like Ooo oo oooo
And when I'm Zone I'm feelin alright, feelin alright, feelin alright
And when I Zone I'm feelin alright, feelin alright, forget about it all

[Verse 2: XV]
Yeah
You plan to win when till the score changes
Runnin round ta figure out how to get out your maze
Sometimes I board planes with no destination
You should try an play it we call it Board/Bored games
And when you this fly you don't think what to fall on
So I roam with no minutes where do I even call home
No wonder I left this crazy planet ya'll long
Life's like amusement parks and misses my themes songs
Don't forget about Me, Miley, Wayne, Wall
I do this for Kansas so yo know I'm a brain ya'll
Don't get scared when you see those Red Trees talk and Toys walk
That just means that we are

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
In my mind it sounds like Ooo oo ooo
When I guard it feels like Ooo oo oooo
And when I'm Zone I'm feelin alright, feelin alright, feelin alright
And when I Zone I'm feelin alright, feelin alright, forget about it all

Hey wake up Baby...
