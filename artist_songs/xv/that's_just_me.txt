I like my beat loud I like my base up
Windows tinted so them hater can't see
But that's just me, yeah, but that's just me, aha
But that's just me, yeah, but that's just me, aha
I turn on x box, I pour some drink up, invite some honeys to the place where I be
But that's just me, yeah, but that's just me, aha
But that's just me, yeah, but that's just me, aha

I turn my beat up kick my feet up with a diva by the speakers
Never change for the streets, nah, I don't pay the leaders
And I don't got it made but don't that boy clean up
Flyer than Mario feathers, and jermey scott adidas
And yo girl, yeah yo girl, she ain't trying to see you
Yawning cause all your mac is tired like reba
Fire up the sativa
Never liked jocks so I'm hiding in the bleachers with a fine cheerleader
Down under with a square is where I sponge her
You kobe number 8, she no longer wants your number
Bummer dude
Been this way since I was thunder cat underroo's
Banging like a hummer with 22 inch suberwoofs
I'm a number 2, ketchup only apple pie kind of guy
Never been like one of you, only been like 1 xv
And a room with a bunch of views, in case they wonder what I love to do

I like my beat loud I like my base up
Windows tinted so them hater can't see
But that's just me, yeah, but that's just me, aha
But that's just me, yeah, but that's just me, aha
I turn on x box, I pour some drink up, invite some honeys to the place where I be
But that's just me, yeah, but that's just me, aha
But that's just me, yeah, but that's just me, aha

I mean, I'm in hollywood acting bad like Nicholas Cage
Face off for the sub that shit gonna bang
If she underage mang we send em away
Cause I ain't trying to get screened In a cinema way
Now you feeling awesome, dizzy good come from the cities hood
Deuce one to get out of the slums, I did pretty good
I would keep my dreams in my head but they don't fit me good
Trying to take the world for Barbie like kenny could
X box gamer score achiever, live show killer
Squarian believer, I'm a fresh t popping, fly ass nigger
Base low and let it blast nigger cause

I like my beat loud I like my base up
Windows tinted so them hater can't see
But that's just me, yeah, but that's just me, aha
But that's just me, yeah, but that's just me, aha
I turn on x box, I pour some drink up, invite some honeys to the place where I be
But that's just me, yeah, but that's just me, aha
But that's just me, yeah, but that's just me, aha

I'm like Jimmy neutron meets Hughy Newton
Rolls royce whipping, grey poupon
The square on top of his green like croutons
Kansas boy trying to blow up the planes no shoe bomb
Who's don, well they call him Vizzy, for prince I came, I keep a semi with me
Haters envy they just keep killin' me like Kenny
But they girl try to hit me like what you like vizzy?

I like my beat loud I like my base up
Windows tinted so them hater can't see
But that's just me, yeah, but that's just me, aha
But that's just me, yeah, but that's just me, aha
I turn on x box, I pour some drink up, invite some honeys to the place where I be
But that's just me, yeah, but that's just me, aha
But that's just me, yeah, but that's just me, aha
