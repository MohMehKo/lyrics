Hey, ya it's like
I wake up u gone
U wake up I'm gone
Same story different song ha ha
U kno? uh

N-n-now look at how the pinstripes suit ya
Baby wanna hop on that ass like Kouta
Baby u fly like Mario 3 s-s-super
Fell from the sky like a goom bug

Feelin up that brazzie brazzie luca
Tryna hold back but I read ya, Hoosier
Lookin at your eyes go hard like Medusa
Never been a loser, u just always flew up

I try to say bye but u just throw the duece up
Tryna hear my line but I just always lose ya
We go at it like bloods and hoovers
But we newer to your city than the cruisers

U r, make it hot
Let me cut like I did in a big paper rot
Wake up without your car in a vacant lot
Red light, yellow light slow
The green lights on and she go

[Hook:]
She go, I go
She go, I go
She go, I go
So I never get to see when
She go, I go
She go, I go
She go, I go
I don't kno where I'm gonna be when
She go, I go
I write your name up in the sky for u
(She go, I go
She go, I go
She go, I go)
U say hello and I say bye to u
(She go, I go)
Let's catch this flight with every fly to u
U kno I'm down hopin everything is fine with u
(So I never get to see when u go)

Let the song play
Just let the song play
Let the song play

Baby u should get in bed then
I got a warm pillow u can lay your head in
But we gota get up and chase that dough
L-l-like the gingerbreadman

It's like seven minutes in heaven
And I just want one more session
So I tie u up
Like the devilish desk man
Then I eat u up
Like a delicate dessan

Damn u fly
Change us in
And u do it like it's your proffession
Hit the story book jeans like dressin
Cooler than a senior
Newer than a freshman

U, u, u my new obsession
Even tho we ain't progressin
Cause u gotta leave and
I gotta leave and
We don't ever ever ask questions cause
When she go

[Hook:]
She go, I go
She go, I go
She go, I go
So I never get to see when
She go, I go
She go, I go
She go, I go
I don't kno where I'm gonna be when
She go, I go
I write your name up in the sky for u
(She go, I go
She go, I go
She go, I go)
U say hello and I say bye to u
(She go, I go)
Let's catch this flight with every fly to u
U kno I'm down hopin everything is fine with u
(So I never get to see when u go)

Let the song play
Just let the song play
Let the song play

[Chiddy Bang:]
She go, I go
Just another girl comin up through the world that raised me
And I'm aimin for the heart
But u gotta play it smart to make the girls go crazy

Do that, it's a new rap
And yo those double Ds got me in a boot trap
Take over and I say who that
And she love the way I'm live like a Roots track

Hey girl I'm in a quest for your love
And all that weak shit sound extra to us
She would love me if my name wasn't next to the bus
Cause she was still there when that nigga was catchin a bus

And I think that it's right to be said
U gotta learn how to live life on the edge

I'm the number one man
With a cumbersome plan
And that's to make love with my number one fan

[Hook:]
She go, I go
She go, I go
She go, I go
So I never get to see when
She go, I go
She go, I go
She go, I go
I don't kno where I'm gonna be when
She go, I go
I write your name up in the sky for u
(She go, I go
She go, I go
She go, I go)
U say hello and I say bye to u
(She go, I go)
Let's catch this flight with every fly to u
U kno I'm down hopin everything is fine with u
(So I never get to see when u go)
