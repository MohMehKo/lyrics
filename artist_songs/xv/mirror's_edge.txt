[Chorus:]
It feels like I'm runnin' on walls and I don't wanna touch the ground,
And if they say that I'm lost then I don't wanna be found,
It feels like I'm runnin' on walls and I don't wanna touch the ground,
And if they say that I'm lost then I don't wanna be found,
I'm on the mirror's edge

[Verse 1:]
Look, my life is unbelievable, even though, sometimes I wanna leave and go
And find a job, I'm so odd, still I got an even flow
Quiet kid, keep it low, mouth is closed wanna scream his soul
Til I'm in the place where the reapers go, I'm runnin' on walls and leapin' poles
My eyes are closed and all I know is I just don't,
Eva eva eva wanna eva fall down, neva neva neva will I touch that ground
I feel so high when girls say Hi and I can't hear em all
The crowd is loud the flash is massive ballin' all it feels like I'mm

[Chorus:]
It feels like I'm runnin' on walls and I don't wanna touch the ground,
And if they say that I'm lost then I don't wanna be found,
It feels like I'm runnin' on walls and I don't wanna touch the ground,
And if they say that I'm lost then I don't wanna be found,
I'm on the mirror's edge

[Verse 2:]
I was livin' like the rest of em, shit I didn't even mess with em
They all came part of the roster
I came in a flyin saucer
Dem dudes be like Who is he? Dem girls be like That's Vizzy
My line is always open, but I still get so busy, now dig me
Sometimes I ask how I have got in here here here here here
Life wasn't always sunny, but I found time to shear, yeah
Even though this height is lo-vel-y
I know gravity got a crush on me
But until that time, I'll be fine, cause it feels like I'mm

[Chorus:]
It feels like I'm runnin' on walls and I don't wanna touch the ground,
And if they say that I'm lost then I don't wanna be found,
It feels like I'm runnin' on walls and I don't wanna touch the ground, (And I don't wanna touch the ground)
And if they say that I'm lost then I don't wanna be found,
I'm on the mirror's edge

[Verse 3:]
What goes up must come down
That's the laws of physics, so I won't stick around
Remind them clowns of dat, I just hope ya'll got my back
When I stage dive from days, sky I brought a rocket pack
So I fly, from the winter to the summer, come up, find how I do
My career Springs cause I'm hot, and you Fall tryna get cool, get it?
Gon' and ask how I did it,
Flyin' through the sky with it
One day we'll all fall difference tween me and ya'll is all admit it

[Chorus:]
It feels like I'm runnin' on walls and I don't wanna touch the ground,
And if they say that I'm lost then I don't wanna be found,
It feels like I'm runnin' on walls and I don't wanna touch the ground,
And if they say that I'm lost then I don't wanna be found,
I'm on the mirror's edge
