Baby girl I'm cool, calm, collect
So what I gotta lose if I come correct?
If feeling you's wrong I don't wanna be right
But it'd feel right if you were on my left
I hear church bells, do you own a dress?
Cause' we can go to vegas like I own a jet

But till then baby can you just do this

Kiss me baby [x2]

Feed me momma [x2]

Shes standin there thick
Just from the side yeah
Shes tellin me that I'm gon like it
And I know that she know that I'm the flyest
Girl you got to admit that you got it
Yeah you got it [x4]

I can see you with it
I can see it in your eyes you don't wanna party with me
Baby we can get together
It's all like a star fish under the sea (yeah)

I wanna hit the spot like Cruella de Vil,
She said I'm sick and she wanna be I'll
Wanna see the matrix and I'm that pill
She swallowed me down now how you feel?
I pulled in you got everything I like
My favorite funk baby you my type
Ever since you left I ain't been right
But I know you come back like day and night
And I know you get down just the way I like
You want me to go down and I say I might
She like the fact I'm bright like neon light
Cause' she know I been around like crayon light
Kinda like a nerd but my flow is stupid
So fly walk her on the sky like Luke did
When we get down and you back in my town
All I want you to do is...

Kiss me baby [x2]

And I know that she know that I'm the flyest
Girl you got to admit that you got it
