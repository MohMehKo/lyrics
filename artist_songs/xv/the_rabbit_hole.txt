"This is the dimension of imagination,
It is an area which we call... "

Down the rabbit hole we go,
Where niggas will big you up for a feature when they all know they ain't fuck with you when you was a nobody,
Before you blown, the cold shoulders they shown are hugs now that you know,
Down the rabbit hole we go,
Where hos you know will call you out the blue askin' "How are you, " and tellin'
You that you are to come over when you are open,
When last time they saw you not a single word was spoken...

But, down the rabbit hole we go
Where everyone got an opinion they use at their illicit?
They lookin' in your eyes but do not see your vision,
They say they got your interest but who are you fuckin kiddin'?

Down the rabbit hole we go,

When they start to know who X is I get emails from my exes,
And my mom is feelin' jaded cause I can't reply to texts,
Don't know if I'm home or doin' a show in Texas...

Down the rabbit hole we go,

Where failure is not an option cause everybody is watchin',
I don't wanna be the topic of barber shop niggas talkin',
The vultures doin' circles cause the square got em hawkin now,

Down the rabbit hole we go,
Yeah, down the rabbit hole we go,
Uh, down the rabbit hole we go,

Hold on to your seat 'cause it's gon' be a bumpy road,
Where your girlfriend wanna sleep and you just gotta up and go,
The fast life got you addicted to something ~slow~,
Down the rabbit hole we go,
Where everybody is plottin' and ain't no way to stop 'em,
You always come around 'n you tell em that you got 'em,
Afraid of them thinkin' you just grew up and just forgot 'em,

Down the rabbit hole we go,
You like her, and she like you but nothin' ever grows
'Cause shes afraid of bein' another name that's in your phone
It's sad when you're a choice and she would rather choose alone
But, - Down the rabbit hole we go,
Yeah, down the rabbit hole we go,
Uh, down the rabbit hole we go,

Get used to your pictures you know they'll always get ya,
'Specially when  [?] in a club chooses to kiss ya,
Then they tag you on the Facebook, now your girlfriend think you dissed her.

You got time to sit and think when you in that window seat,
Prayin' for your downfall soon as you reach your peak,
So my eyes wide open I don't even try to blink...

Down the rabbit hole we go,
You just hope the end is near so  [?] your life is like a  [?],
Every hand shake and friendship is a career move, you feel yourself gettin' further from people that's near you.

Down the rabbit hole we go,
Take a pill to make you sleep,
Take a pill to make you go,
Take a pill to make a freaky?,
Take a pill to make you grow,
Heres a pill to hide the real,
And heres a pill to make it known.

Down the rabbit hole we go,
Yeah, down the rabbit hole we go,
Uh, down the rabbit hole we go,

Down the rabbit hole we go,
Down the rabbit hole we go,
Yeah, uh,
Down the rabbit hole we go...
