I could never find my car keys
And I have never pulled a map out
And the closest that I get to the outside world is my desktop background
But I done got all dressed up
Since I stepped out and impressed ya
It's sad when ya homeboys text ya saying
If you come we won't ask ya til next month

What a loner, owner of my sofa
Controller of my life with my remote controller
Outta this world, how am I solar
Message in a bottle, lemme finish my soda
Calls coming through but my phone ignores it
The world's outside, won't you go and explore it
Yo what them girls came for, go for it
One two three, now forfeit

I was just about to come out of my room
I was gonna turn off my xbox too
I was gonna step out the whip in a fresh outfit
And then I went and thought about you
Nevermind [x9]

Why be saying nevermind
Walking it with girls that is never mine
She find a new side, I mean she hella fine
And I be like, I holla at another time
What a loser, abuser of my computer
Open up the windows through windows
And watch it boot up
Playin tekken 6 as long as I get kazuya
Damn, I swear I used to seem much cooler
Used to step out fresh to the party world
Wasn't into her but she was such a barbie girl
And all she wanna do is go out
I wanna stay in
And she gonna show out
Roll with an entourage like my name was ari
Come on, bounce around like pong in atari
It's funny how they use to have parties and call me-
Coat checks turn to rain checks, I'm sorry

I was just about to come out of my room
I was gonna turn off my xbox too
I was gonna step out the whip in a fresh outfit
And then I went and thought about you
Nevermind [x16]

I was like
I'm a be gone so long I forget what my home look like
I was like
I'm a sit in traffic just blastin my music while I chill in my ride
I was like
I'm a see the girl of my dreams and this time I'm a say hi
I was like
This close to (this close to) supposed to (supposed to) thinkin I might
Huh

Nevermind [x17]
