It's these girls that be needy
Labels that be greedy
That keep me hitting these bottles hoping I find a Genie
No shave November, hair growing out in my beanie
Benny the Jet hit got chicks on my L7 weenie
Musical chair rhymes, they thinking it's there time
The game like Lebron's hairline, always receding
All I'm needing is a little space
Once I get a little taste
You niggas should grab a chair, no Triple H

Tech-Neek you a fool for this!
This feels soulful, but powerful
Chaka Shao Khan!

Welcome to the city of pretty women that can't take the now
And cry enough to turn a small lake into the Nile
Head's great, but they be a head case on file
With contraceptive pills she ain't take in a while
So I'm putting on a glove like OJ in the trial
For me to calm down, it's gon' take a while
Vegas for the night we got drinks at Tao
Like Calvin in Paid in Full
We pop Ace so wild
While, niggas who were hating all in our faces
24 hour diamonds, they all shapes and smiles
It was all hate til now
Now I'll take my bow, little hoes, weak little hoes
If this was 5th grade, I put put you in a figure 4
Used to keep a flag on us like Pookie's clothes
Just a bunch of Lost Boys, Bangorang, Rufio
Chaka meet Shao Khan
And in my downtime, since weed is a trend now, I sell it by pounds signs
And still deliver classics through Alpines
Squarians say, Vizzy blowin' up? It's 'bout time"

And this just the beginning...
You know how people say, "This is my year"?
Naw, this is my generation
Vizzy

This is that Chaka Shao Khan
Mortal Kombat bangin on that loud tom
When I spit that blacka blacka blaow rhyme
Losing my mind even though I sound fine
8 blunts deep, think I'm about to be on Cloud 9
Coupe changing colors, the new name is mood rings
Square in the circle, four eyes and 2 chains
Under the illest conditions, I'm winning: flu game
Hashtag Squarian, intergalactic crew name
