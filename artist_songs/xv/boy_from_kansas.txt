I don't drink or smoke I do my thing
I just do my songs make my beats
I just roll with my dogs keep my peace
But if ya'll want be I keep my peace
I don't club too much I stay at home
I like to cruise a lot don't answer the phone
I got my girl wrapped up don't need no more
I'm like not live too long I see the globe
I'm humble and cool ask my dudes
Like sez and bling, ace and dubes
Or stringer and block 7 and bounce
Or haters that know me around the town
I'm king of the city I make that crown
So if you want once we can battle it out
I have a lot to say so you can stay with the pen
You can break it down in the end

I'm just a boy from kansas
No matter where your from don't forget where you come from
I'm just a boy from kansas
When the heart is in your home you know that's where you from
I'm just a boy from kansas
You went all around the globe but you know that's where you from
I'm just a boy from kansas
Your still that boy from kansas just tell em where your from

I like only to rap benzes and blacks
I got homies who work homies who track
I done did more work never go back
I love spinning giving you my vision through tracks
I'm a city boy from the ICT
Don't confuse it with the country homie come and see
We the middle of the mat finger cause I rap like
East coast west coast bring it on back
I like air force 1s bakes is cool
I like chuck taylors or some skater shoes
You like this dude seems hella confused
Nah homie that's just how I do
You never knew
I'm complex
I went to black and white schools
Took a little from the bad took a little from the good
Took a white people hat brought it back to the hood
I'm sorry if I'm misunderstood

I'm just a boy from kansas
No matter where your from don't forget where you come from

You can catch me on the block with my crew
If I'm not posted I'll be driving on through
Chuck in the douce is up the cripps and bloodz
For trick whoever homie I show everyone love
Holla if you see me on your block if you see me on the grind
Just throw the boy a sign holla at me man
If I'm rolling through your city yea you see the boy busy
If I have the look fly take a flick man
I don't do much fair
I don't skate but I dress like a skater that's just who I am
I still rap for my d boys
Moving grems and all white like the ku klux klan
Rerun whatever side come through the middle
I'm a make the game take a break for the middle
If I was to die how would you describe me
This here is x to the v
