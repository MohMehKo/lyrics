So I'm
Watching T.G.I.S. Shows And Thinkin Bout
The Love Of my Life I Lost While On This Couch
I Just Felt Tremendous About My Girl
That I Took From This Boy That Wanted To Meet The World
Topanga, Oh My Topanga
Can I Make Ya Top Fall Down Like Janga, I'm Playin
Mr. Feeny Took My Letter I Was Trying o Tell Ya
That I Don't Mess With This Girl From Saved By The Bell
Um, Lisa Oh My. My Lisa
Always Been Fresh Since The First Day I Seen Ya
Admittedly I Cheated In Malibu With Stacy Than I See Ya
If You Could Come Back Boo I Need Ya

[Chorus:]
Nothing Really Matters, I Don't Really Care
Why'd Nobody Tell Me, I'm Gonna Be Here
That I'm Gonna Be Here
It's A Matter Of Extreme Importance
My First TV Love Affair

So I Don't Get The Big Deal On Why You Gotta Fuss
About Me Watching The Television To Much
I Told You We Don't Talk No More You Don't Trust
You Said U Dated Twins I Said I'd Never Discuss But
Tamara, Oh I Mean Tia
Rodger Used To Cockblock Everytime I Seen Ya
Then They Moved To College And I Ain't Heard From Neither
Then I Moved On To This Chick
That I Used To Call Six
Man I Loved Six
Blossom Introduced Us She Talk Tellin Quits
Things Was Good Until The Parkers Got Into Our Shit
And Nothings Been The Same Ever Since

[Chorus:]
Nothing Really Matters, I Don't Really Care
Why'd Nobody Tell Me, I'm Gonna Be Here
That I'm Gonna Be Here
It's A Matter Of Extreme Importance
My First TV Love Affair
