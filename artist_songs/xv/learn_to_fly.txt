[Hook: Betty Trouble]
I learn to fly
So you, you run to find the gun
To shoot me down
Before I got too high
I learn to fly
So you, you run to find the gun
To shoot me down
Before I got too high

[Verse 1: XV]
See, I grew up on that Northside
Where the ballers don't play courtside
They wear colors, and ride for they brothers
Throwin' they C's up and B's up and courts high
And I touched my first 45
When Jordan was wearing that 45
And I couldn't ball, I was like 4'5″
So I stayed inside writing up more rhymes
Well of course I, had problems with thugs
Who told me that I couldn't get any love
In the city I'm from, don't know why
I stayed here, never said bye
Dad said no, Mom said try
Shorty said "who? " Now says "hi"
Teacher sighs, says "what you gonna do? "

[Verse 2: XV]
More fire, more fire
As I get higher and higher
My bars get tighter than Rikers
When I get behind mics like I'm Myers
And lay on my bandwagon
Call it radio flyers
But if you roll it, come on then
I hope you saving your tyres
Don't buy my CD, just to see me
'Fore the day I expire
I am here permanente
I swear my name could be Kaiser
No fat lady's gonna sing
Skinny chicks in my choir
And life's a bitch
But I swear that bitch couldn't be finer
I asked my momma, where we go from here?
No clue till we die
So living like this our last is the move for the night
Called me a nerd in high school
Now my school is so high
I'm flying first class
Like my homeroom's in the sky
And I

Knew that I could when they told me I can't
Said I was good, I told 'em I'm great
Funny my hood, they told me I changed
I said yeah, only the game
Now am I here throwin' up squares
L & 7′s up in the air
They askin me "Vizzy you really prepared? "
I say "hell yeah, where's my chair? "
Keep yo throne, leave my wings
I am grown off something
Got me flyer and feeling super I am Mario 3
This is when no-one knew who I would be
Back then when no one would ever believe
Now they see cause I fly with my dreams in front of they eyes
Look
