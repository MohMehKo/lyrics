[Verse 1: XV]
Yeah, do I want this bad as I think that I want it?
Posters on the wall, you'd think that I'm wanted
Jessie James style, living without laws
A rebel without cause, and models without flaws
Sound good? Probably is
Texted Wiz asking him "where the party is? "
Still don't go out
Cause I always feel like the nigga nobody know 'bout
So til I am a Billboard charter
Record label Martyr
Hold my bottle in July for sparklers
Going from 500 comments online to hit the club fresh
And nobody comment on mine, I won't lie
Sometimes it kills to dream
But even Superman gets hurt by the green
But what I'm scared of is getting hits like a fiend
And then being high and it's not what it seems
Damn...

[Hook:]
What are you afraid of?
Afraid of, afraid of
What are you afraid of?
Nothing but you
What are you afraid of?
Afraid of, afraid of
What are you afraid of?
Nothing but you

[Verse 2: XV]
Yeah, baby I'm your boogie-man
She said Maybe we should be friends
Maybe we should be then
If that's all it takes for us to break
You could be my Rose but you chose to be the Vase
She said I froze when she said "Let's get a place! "
Like commitment is what I'm scared to make
She don't gotta go and look my mom in the face
With three marriages that she views as mistakes
Wait, you'll never be that to me
Hope you know that in case you ever come back to me
I know sometimes these 16′s are just raps to me
But me and your love grew so rapidly
I still see you sleeping in the bed with your back to me
How did our "forever after" not end happily?
Actually, I guess it's not goodbye
You can't open your eyes, baby
We ain't even high

[Hook:]
What are you afraid of?
Afraid of, afraid of
What are you afraid of?
Nothing but you
What are you afraid of?
Afraid of, afraid of
What are you afraid of?
Nothing but you

[Verse 3: XV]
Counting my blessings watching Inception
Feeling like my dreams come true like the totem fell over
'Fore the credits started rolling
But these are just previews, it all would come soon
I'm just living in it, like front rooms
Cause any minute it all could conclude
Chasing the high like running on blunt fumes
Came from the underground, creature from the Lagoon
She's so amazed by this life I live
But I cannot stay, one night to give
And I hate to say that I hit it and quit
But in the back of my mind I know she thinks that I did
And it kills me, tryna put my all into it
All those BBMs you sent
Have an "R" next to it
143′s turn to OMG's – TTYL, my flights about to leave
I know...

[Hook:]
What are you afraid of?
Afraid of, afraid of
What are you afraid of?
Nothing but you
What are you afraid of?
Afraid of, afraid of
What are you afraid of?
Nothing but you
