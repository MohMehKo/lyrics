Vizzy where your newer shit?
I'm underground slime, Ninja Turtle sewer shit
That joint I dropped in April
Make them hoes kneel like O'Neal
You retired from that green, I'm making more deals, so I'll
The shit I spit out of these two lips
Got me killing the game bring tulips
And I'm throwing out papers like looseys
So these girls wanna hang like nooses
And why waste aim on losers
When I'm gunnin' for the top, Tom Cruisin'
I John Hughes it, I John Holmes it, I go Hulk, and I go Hogan
Now tell me how I don't kill shit
When I stay bussing like field trips
The only time a nigga ever seen me
Is when he was watching a flim clip
And my old girl say I don't feel shit
Cause I won't stumple over her guilt trips
Miss her period, saying "I feel sick! "
Shit cut that out now, real quick
And I'm on my Uncle Phil shit
Throw out some jazz and get some cake
You think those little Nicki's gonna
Make you feel the bass?
I don't trust no one but God
Say my prayers and give him thanks
Porto-potties on the moon
Man, I shit in outer space

[Hook:]
Say I ain't gridin', say I ain't focused
I say "ok! I'm reloaded"
I see the top, that's where I'm going
I'm like "ok! I'm reloaded"

Bitch, I'm reloaded
