[Verse 1: XV]
Small town, big dreams
And a young boy, the age of fifteen
Had a premonition that his city would get seen
Now I'm winning, get Sheen in the city, uh
The home of a hero
Heroin stay back, this is dope on a needle
Do it for the people, with an anchorman ego
Sex panther cologne in a speedo
Coming live from
Everyday I have to
It's kamikaze blowing up cities you can't come back to
Through all of their don'ts I paid mad dues
I just want the world to feel me like a masseuse
Take em to Kansas,
I ran shit, no ringtones, no dances
Just real music coming out, the fucking answers
Painted ya'll a picture on this Just Blaze canvas

[Hook:]
Small town, big dreams
And a young boy the age of fifteen
Had a premonition that his city would get seen
Big dreams, big dreams, and
Big dreams
Small town, big dreams
And a young boy, the age of fifteen
Had a premenition that his city would get seen
Big dreams, big dreams, and

[Verse 2:]
I'm in the crib dropping shit, no baby diaper
Posted on twitter, showed them niggas that they ain't nicer
Given for free, but when I sell it better pay the piper
You want bars, well this page is Rikers
Thank ya'll the
My home is, I roll with
The coldest, so know this
I won't stop, so know this
I go in, show out
Then you, close in
The dub is gon blow out
Tell me who is gonna hit up
I'm cool not being you
Whether you ran to my music, or just walk through my tombs
Hope you feel it in your sole, like a rock in your shoe
Middle finger to the motherfuckers who thought I should move, away from
As I instruct this, get the memo
Kill instrumentals, as I'm instructed
Time to tell them about the kid from Kansa niggas can't fuck with
And I'm a show the world what the dub is, in the city of

[Hook:]
Small town, big dreams
And a young boy the age of fifteen
Had a premonition that his city would get seen
Big dreams, big dreams, and
Big dreams
Big dreams
And a young boy at the age of fifteen
Had a premonition that his city would get seen
Big dreams, big dreams, and

[Verse 3:]
Where I grew up, yeah where I grew up
Read rhymes that blew up, at bedtime they shoot up
Robble blocks, the one that wanna deuce up
Met Sev, we hooped up
That's where I first got stoned, looking for Medusa
And, music was my calling
Where I tried get to get rich bitch, Donnell Rawlings
I'm a heist, how it started, northeast brawling
Southeast walking in a town, needs small in
Due from
When I was at school, with that green backpack on my back fool
That's who, had a dream that my city would be seen
Passed the cliche, wizard of oz movie scenes
They don't know yo
Ain't from KC, but next to it like JoJo
And if you wanna see all kind liz, well here's some photos
No yellow brick road though
Just hit the concrete, made cotton and I'm home bro
Welcome to the (Wichita)
