[xV:]
Step up now, tell me what ya life's like
Is it worth something? What's the price like?
When I was still sleepin' with a night light
You was out there livin' in the night life
Like you ain't have a kid in ya hindsight
I was spelling 'dad' with my light bright
Just hoping you were looking for a clock
And one day you'd stop when you finally find time
And then when talkin' to my mom
And not know she sees you in my eyes
And she gon' get mad if I try to ask
'Do you know if my Dad gonna stop by? '
That play that you never saw
That ball that I never caught
All those years that we both have lost
Man, I hope you enjoyed it all

[Chorus: XV]
I hope you walk the moon
I hope you reach the stars
I hope you found the things that you already lost
I hope you have it all, I hope you have it all
I hope you have it all, I hope you have it all
I hope you got to see, everything you dreamed
I hope you saw the things, that you didn't see in me
I hope you have it all, I hope you have it all
I hope you have it all, I hope you have it all
I hope you have it all

[xV:]
I hope you live it, hope you get it
Hope you got it
I hope you find it, hope you see it
Hope you watch it
I hope you want it, hope you like it
Hope you love it
I hope you achieve it, hope you reach it
Hope you touch it

Blue skies, [?]
Big ring, nice wedding
New guy, you can walk into heaven
Mom is a teacher, Dad is a reverend
The best high heels you can step in
Cars are so big you can even fit a bed in
Middle school sweetheart, high school legend
Hotel suites, so high, yell on ledges
No cable, dinner at a table
Dozens of roses whenever he's able
Love so deep it's fatal
Is this the kind of thing that you wait for?
Well I hope you were patient baby
Once in these, it'll make you crazy
Once in these, it'll make you crazy
Once in these, it'll make you crazy

[Chorus: XV]
I hope you walk the moon
I hope you reach the stars
I hope you found the things that you already lost
I hope you have it all, I hope you have it all
I hope you have it all, I hope you have it all
I hope you got to see, everything you dreamed
I hope you saw the things, that you didn't see in me
I hope you have it all, I hope you have it all
I hope you have it all, I hope you have it all
I hope you have it all

[xV:]
I hope you live it, hope you get it
Hope you got it
I hope you find it, hope you see it
Hope you watch it
I hope you want it, hope you like it
Hope you love it
I hope you achieve it, hope you reach it
Hope you touch it
