[Verse 1: XV]
What got in her is all them girls that got in her
And when she heard that old nerd is newly popular
Getting looks of you on facebook, saying "X fine! "
This is when Urkel turned into Stephan
Unless I'm going crazy
And all of these ladies always like dude
I was like Common & Kanye: too shy, dude
Now they mad when I move how I move
That's how your hoes turn to foes like 2 times 2
See, I knew it would happen with the rappin'
And they lacking and they cashing
The kid in band class has got 'em on the bandwagon
Blast from the past, chicks in class, I was passing
Notes to, they checkmark the box they said no to
I'm a new man like Randy, you can't stand your old dude
So when I ask about him you say "me and him are so through! "
All of the time I gave you all of my time
Now I got none to give and I'm all on your mind but...

[Hook: x2]
Now it's up to you to say that you were wrong
When I knew all along you'd call my phone
And shawty
(You can only blame yourself)
When you just hear the tone
Don't leave a message and just leave me alone

[Verse 2: Emilio Rojas]
Remember when you left me?
You're right for me now
I couldn't get the time of day
Now you want nights at a time, right
But a threesome what I like right now
Life a bitch and karma's a bitch, I'm dyking it out
Like mama mama mama, you could be the one
Really I ain't fuckin with you, you should be a nun
If you want a reason from me, I would say because
I told you because, no love cause I'm over you
Over you, I roll with a chosen few
No one was as cold as you
Your heart is like some frozen food
When I would go to school I would get ignored
You toy with my emotions like pieces on a board
I'm Jordan in this sport, in at every turn
Before the kid was panic, it was never concern
Not a phsycician in a clinic asking "when you gon learn? "
Just tell that bitch, it isn't pimpin if you never been burned

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Cassie Veggies]
She heard me screamin, Jordan back on the team then
Started loving me more, the art of winning that war
These women don't love these artist, they asking take em to stores
And hosting to get em presents with money we made on tour
That's cold: but you know, life ain't fair
When I needed you most, you see your life wasn't there
When I leave here and coast, now my phone ring bare
Looking at it while we blow L's then press decline
I'm fine on all that, got too much on my mind in time to fall back
Caught up in the grind of you trying to crawl back
My heart is in these lines, hope this markers soon be fine
I hope these models love wine and these white jacuzzi towels
Roll with the winners, quick dinners
All good intentions, chasing dreams, like a J O B
See me shining, now I'm on a track with GLC
