As I hop on my bike
Imagine these Vizzy, you imagine these Vizzy as knights
Tryin' to save the world and get the girl
I'm like cloud strife
Sinra HQ, the industry hates you
So fight, for your right
And maybe not tonight
But someday, one day they all gonna believe
That everything they said that I'll achieve
It didn't come fast like highway speed
So I Tokyo drift to a place in my dreams
Tryin' to get paid money longer than Sepheroth
But everything is never what it seams
But I stay with hope, came here till I leave
The future of you final fantasy me
Ya diiig

Lookin' like a star, it's who I wanna be
How can I complain, my life kinda sweet
This place that I go, I never wanna leave
The future of you final fantasy me
My life bright like Tokyo scene
So I stay awake no holdin' on dreams
Where we bout to go, I hope that you see
The future of you final fantasy me

Lookin' like a star, it's who I wanna be
How can I complain, my life kinda sweet
This place that I go, I never wanna leave
The future of you final fantasy me
My life bright like Tokyo scene
So I stay awake no holdin' on dreams
Where we bout to go, I hope that you see
The future of you final fantasy me

Maybe Aeris was right
The promised land is near and I gotta get there by the night
Can't miss my flight
Tell me how you ever left everything with the hopes of bein' right
Well I might
Shine bright as halos and my flow bring energy like Mako
When I stay fresh like a day old
See what I've become, and that's when the hate shows
What try and take it outside like play close
Small time niggas just mad caus they ain't grow
No win nigga that's why you ain't blow
Never think they don't see what you can't show
I never once asked for what I ain't-o
So anyone ever say I'm juiced up
No way Jose can say go

Lookin' like a star, it's who I wanna be
How can I complain, my life kinda sweet
This place that I go, I never wanna leave
The future of you final fantasy me
My life bright like Tokyo scene
So I stay awake no holdin' on dreams
Where we bout to go, I hope that you see
The future of you final fantasy me
