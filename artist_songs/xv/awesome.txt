I'm A W E, some call me awesome
You don't wanna miss it like a very special blossom
Gator on my shirt, what did it lacoste him?
Jesus christ I'm good, please don't cross him
How rude! Step in these?
You don't gotta watch me, but please watch ya manners
And the girls I be meetin' be planters
Nuts, sayin' I should lay down green on a ring like?
I been on it for a while, tryna get my spot
Had a lukewarm buzz back when luke was hot
I was bumpin' Pink Floyd, all I wanted was my Puddin'
Labels deal tryna escape like Cuba
Gooding with the flow, first cd outsold a?
Sold out shows, girls tryna get a?
Good will huntin' got up out of the hood
Now he's coming to America cause that boy good

Now tell me what got 2 thumbs and knows how to spit rhymes
Two thumbs up, you gon' point 'em at this guy
Al Henderson? couldn't be this fly
So ask how I feel and you know I reply

[Chorus: XV]
Cause I feel so, awesome
How you feel, awesome
I guess that's, awesome
Shorty you fine and ya body is, awesome
Wanna roll? Awesome
Well let's go. Awesome
Hands in the sky like

[XV:]
Ay, I'm awesome
Everytime I lay it down
I think that I kill 'em, play possom
Tell 'em open wide when they see how I'm flossin' - ching!
Cooler than a peppermint, wayne's world excellent
Party on gobs - shwing!
Work at it harder than a mexican
That's why I can walk up into any restaurant
And close the whole - thing!
See, even G couldn't F with it
Semi colon dash parenthesis, text messagin'
That's a side smiley face, cause I'm a make the best of it
I assume you should make room for the hell of it
Boom. Where I come from is irrelevent
Cause my glory is all that I revel in
Plus I'm hotter than the pasta that the devil sent
And y'all can just deal with the rest of it

Now tell me what got 2 thumbs and knows how to spit rhymes
Two thumbs up, you gon' point 'em at this guy
Al Henderson couldn't be this fly
So ask how I feel and you know I reply

[Chorus: XV]
Cause I feel so, awesome
How you feel, awesome
I guess that's, awesome
Shorty you fine and ya body is, awesome
Wanna roll? Awesome
Well let's go. Awesome
