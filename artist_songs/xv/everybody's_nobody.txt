Day to day I stay awake, writing just to please the crowd
Yellin' through a megaphone that doesn't make a sound
The homie said "Enjoy the ride, take your time, be proud,
Cause once you make it to the top, the only place to go is down"
I see my life in versions, from the person in the stands
So when I'm higher than the ceiling, I'm still down with my fans
Home is where the heart is, so I never have to search
But now that everybody's fly, nobody's down to earth
And everybody Twitters, and everybody blogs
But nobody's sayin' shit, they just copy paste it all
That's how one person's opinion becomes everybody's thoughts
When the blind leads the blind, then everyone gets lost
Rappers think they the big cheese, ain't even made a single
That's why when I go out, I don't ever stay to mingle
And that's just rule of thumb, and I got four more fingers
But I just need one to tell these divas what I'm thinking
I'd tell you what my name is, but that don't really matter
All that really matters is that I'm one of the best rappers
And if you enjoy my chatter, then listen to the songs
And I'm a keep it short, so ya'll can sing along

Everybody's nobody, nobody is somebody
Somebody told me that I can be anybody
(And you will go far away, and you can go far away)
Everybody's nobody, nobody is somebody
Somebody told me that I can be anybody
(And you will go far away, and you can go far away)

It's funny when a girl starts to want me
Simultaneously when I end up in the magazine
She probably tell her friends about how she know me
All of a sudden, she own me then I hear the phone ring
Bitches jump on the reality show to be a star
Kissing a dude they wouldn't talk to at a bar
And the public fall victim to the ratings
What am I saying? I got a few of them of DVR
I think the world just got crazy more
I'm trying to figure out what Paris Hilton famous for
I know that MTV felt bad for what they did to Britney Spears
So they had the VMAs and gave her every award
DJ Booth nominated, that's a great look
Lost to a song with Lil Wayne that ain't have a hook
It's all good, it just overthrows my message
We always throwing money, and then came a recession
I'd tell you what my name is, but that don't really matter
All that really matters is that I'm one of the best rappers
And if you enjoy my chatter, then listen to the songs
And I'm a keep it short, so ya'll can sing along

Everybody's nobody, nobody is somebody
Somebody told me that I can be anybody
(And you will go far away, and you can go far away)
Everybody's nobody, nobody is somebody
Somebody told me that I can be anybody
(And you will go far away, and you can go far away)

Everybody's nobody, nobody is somebody
Somebody told me that I can be anybody
(And you will go far away, and you can go far away)
Everybody's nobody, nobody is somebody
Somebody told me that I can be anybody
(And you will go far away, and you can go far away)
