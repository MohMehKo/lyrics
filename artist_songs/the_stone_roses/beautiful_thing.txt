There was no crucifixion
Just lies to steal your mind
Now I know that you're thinking
That I'm running out of time

Sister must a missed you
I don't wanna steal your shine
There's method to my madness
Yeah there's reason to my rhyme

It's a beautiful thing that I say bye bye
Hear me, it's a beautiful thing so I stay so high
So soul sucking vampire
How you love to steal the vibe
All wrapped up in your addiction
So we'll have to say bye bye

It's a beautiful thing that I say bye bye
Hear me, it's a beautiful thing so I stay so high

Oh, your so hip, this ought to move on our tune
Oh, your so hip, this ought to move on our tune
It's a beautiful thing that I say bye bye
Hear me, it's a beautiful thing so I stay so high
Hear me, it's a beautiful thing that I say bye bye
Hear me, it's a beautiful thing so I stay so high

Is this your own reflection, you keep it in a safe
There's a secret combination, to naval gaze all day

It's a beautiful thing that I say bye bye
Hear me, it's a beautiful thing so I stay so high

Yeah you say you love John Lennon, you don't want the world as one
Fight always necessary, yes I have to sing my song

It's a beautiful thing that I say bye bye
Hear me, it's a beautiful thing so I stay so high

Oh, your so hip, this ought to move on our tune
Oh, your so hip, this ought to move on our tune

It's a beautiful thing that I say bye bye
Hear me, it's a beautiful thing so I stay so high
Hear me, it's a beautiful thing that I say bye bye
Hear me, it's a beautiful thing so I stay so high

It's a beautiful thing that I say bye bye
Hear me, it's a beautiful thing so I stay so high
Hear me, it's a beautiful thing that I say bye bye
Hear me, it's a beautiful thing so I stay so high

It's a beautiful thing that I say bye bye
Hear me, it's a beautiful thing so I stay so high
Hear me, it's a beautiful thing that I say bye bye
Hear me, it's a beautiful thing so I stay so high

Hey it's a beautiful thing
Hear me it's a beautiful thing
Hear me it's a beautiful thing
