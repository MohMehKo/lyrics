Open up your heart and let my love come in
Open up your heart and let my life begin
The sun's gonna shine, there'll be blue skies again
When you open up your heart and let my love come in.

I know you've been hurt by an old love affair
But darling, don't blame me I wasn't even there
Your long lonely nights I will bring to an end
When you open up your heart and let my love come in.

Open up your heart and let my love come in
Open up your heart and let my life begin
The sun's gonna shine, there'll be blue skies again
When you open up your heart and let my love come in.

[Instrumental]

Someone before me has treated you like dirt
Someone before me has made your heart hurt
Your long lonely nights I will bring to an end
When you open up your heart and let my love come in.

Open up your heart and let my love come in
Open up your heart and let my life begin
The sun's gonna shine, there'll be blue skies again
When you open up your heart and let my love come in.

When you open up your heart and let my love come in...
