Well, today's a gonna be my lucky day
Gonna let the good times roll
Today's the day she's coming home to stay
Gonna let the good times roll.

Gonna meet my baby by a quarter to ten
Gonna let the good times roll
Gonna be at the station when the train rolls in
Gonna let the good times roll.

Gonna let the good times roll
Gonna let the good times roll
Gonna be at the station when the train rolls in
Gonna let the good times roll.

[Instrumental]

Gonna kiss my baby gonna hold her tight
Gonna let the good times roll
Gonna hug her up with all of my might
Gonna let the good times roll.

Gonna meet my baby come face to face
Gonna let the good times roll
Gonna dance a little jig all over the place
Gonna let the good times roll.

Gonna let the good times roll
Gonna let the good times roll
Gonna dance a little jig...
