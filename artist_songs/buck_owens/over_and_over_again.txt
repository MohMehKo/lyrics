Over and over,
I've said that we are through
Over and over,
I've said I'm leaving you.

But when you say I love you
My heart goes in a spin
And over and over
I take you back again.

Time and time again I've said
This is the end
And told my heart forget
What might have been.

No matter what I'd do
I can't get over you
I love you
Over and over again.

[Instrumental]

Time and time again I've said
This is the end
And told my heart forget
What might have been.

No matter what I'd do
I can't get over you
I love you
Over and over again.
