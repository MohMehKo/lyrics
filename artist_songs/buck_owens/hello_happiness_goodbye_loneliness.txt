Hello happiness, goodbye loneliness
Farewell heartaches and so long strife
No more sadness only gladness
My little darling's coming home tonight.

Well, now she called me today
Said she's on her way
That she'd be in on the 6-0-10
Said we had a date
Warned me don't be late
Promised she never ever leave again.

Hello happiness, goodbye loneliness
Farewell heartaches and so long strife
No more sadness only gladness
My little darling's coming home tonight.

[Instrumental]

Well, we'll take in the town to turn it upside down
New Year is easy comin' early this year
Bad times are a gonna go and the good times are a gonna roll
My little darling's gonna soon be here.

Hello happiness, goodbye loneliness
Farewell heartaches and so long strife
No more sadness only gladness
My little darling's coming home tonight.

My little darling's coming home tonight...
