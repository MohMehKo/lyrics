Please don't take her from me
I'm not happy when she's not with me
Please don't take her from me

A quarrel we had and thus it began
I don't suppose you'd understand
I don't she don't want to be free
Please don't take her from me

I know by your kind what's on your mind
So don't wink your eye just let her pass by
She'll come back to me and happy we'll be
Please don't take her from me
