I got two arms that reach for you
I got two eyes that watch for you
I got a heart that's a beatin' true for you, you, you.
I take the moon from the sky for you
And I drain the ocean dry for you
I climb the mountains high it's true for you, you, you.

You you only you
You're what it takes to make my dreams come true
I got a little dog that wags his tail for you
I got a little boat that I'd sail for you
And I'd like to spend my whole life through with you, you, you.

[Instrumental]

I got something old and something new
Something borrowed and something blue
I got a ring laid away it's true for you, you, you.
I keep you happy and you'll never pine
I'll be yours and you'll be mine
And I'll be till the end of time with you, you, you.

You you only you
You're what it takes to make my dreams come true
There's a cute little house that I'll buy for you
The moment that you say I do
And there I'll spend my whole life through
With you, you, you. Yes me and you...
