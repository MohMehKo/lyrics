They say for everybody there is a fool
And that's the way it's always been between me and you
Anytime you're ready you treat me like a friend
'Cause you know that I'm just fool enough to take you back again.

Yes, I'm nobody's fool, nobody's fool
Nobody's fool but yours
And although you do me wrong I'll still tag along
'Cause I'm nobody's fool but yours.

[Instrumental]

You falsely accused me of doing you wrong
That's just an excuse you used to string me along
A toy you play with and when you are through
You throw me away and find somebody knew.

But, I'm nobody's fool, nobody's fool
Nobody's fool but yours
And although you do me wrong I'll still tag along
'Cause I'm nobody's fool but yours...
