Oh, I must have had rocks in my head
Well, I believed anything that you said
Like a puppy I rolled over and played dead
Oh, I must have had rocks in my head.

Many nights I've waited up till twelve o'clock
That's all over now my waitin's gonna stop
I get dressed up and I'll go out on the town
While I'll live it up and you can live it down.

Oh, I must have had rocks in my head
Well, I believed anything that you said
Like a puppy I rolled over and played dead
Oh, I must have had rocks in my head.

[Instrumental]

Well, I'm tired of talkin' to the walls
Tired of waitin' all alone for you to call
So when you see me dancing with a brand new girl
Then you'll know that I've got a brand new whirl.

Oh, I must have had rocks in my head
Well, I believed anything that you said
Like a puppy I rolled over and played dead
Oh, I must have had rocks in my head.

Yes, I must have had rocks in my head...
