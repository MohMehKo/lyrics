Touch me, touch the hand of a man
Who once owned all the world
Touch me, touch the arms that once held
All the charms of the world's sweetest girl
Touch me, maybe someday you may need
To know how it feels when you lose
Touch me, you'll know how
You feel with the blues.

Watch me, watch the eyes that have seen
All the heartache and pain in the land
And be thankful you're happy
Though standing so close to the world's bluest man
Don't forget me take a good look
At someone who's lost everything he can lose
Touch me, you'll know how
You feel with the blues.

[Instrumental]

Watch me, watch the eyes that have seen
All the heartache and pain in the land
And be thankful you're happy
Though standing so close to the world's bluest man
Don't forget me take a good look
At someone who's lost everything he can lose
Touch me, you'll know how
You feel with the blues...
