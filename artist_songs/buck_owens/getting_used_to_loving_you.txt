Getting used to loving you won't be easy
For the last love I had was untrue
So go slow, please go slow, won't you darling
While I'm gettin' used to loving you.

Getting used to loving you.
Getting used to loving you.
While I'm getting used to loving you.

[Instrumental]

Getting used to kissing you won't be easy
For the last lips I kissed made me blue
So be sure please be sure you don't hurt me
While I'm gettin' used to loving you.

Getting used to loving you.
Getting used to loving you.
While I'm getting used to loving you.
