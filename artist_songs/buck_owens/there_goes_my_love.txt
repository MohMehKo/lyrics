There goes the girl I used to know
There goes the girl that I love so
There goes the arms that used to hold me tight
There goes the reason that I sigh
There goes the reason that I cry
There goes the lips I used to kiss goodnight
There goes my love.

Well, you're the first love of my life
And you might be my last
I don't want to be just another
Boy in your past.

There goes the girl I used to know
There goes the girl that I love so
There goes the arms that used to hold me tight
There goes the reason that I sigh
There goes the reason that I cry
There goes the lips I used to kiss goodnight
There goes my love.

[Instrumental]

I've got a feelin' for you yet
That's with my night and day
Just because we're far apart
Don't make it go away.

There goes the girl I used to know
There goes the girl that I love so
There goes the arms that used to hold me tight
There goes the reason that I sigh
There goes the reason that I cry
There goes the lips I used to kiss goodnight
There goes my love...
