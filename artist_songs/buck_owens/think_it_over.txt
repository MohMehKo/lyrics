When I woke up this morning you were gone
The note on your pillow said so long
The things that seemed so right now seem so wrong
As I'm left alone to face each empty dawn.

Think it over, don't let love fade away
Think it over, is there nothing left to say
Leave your pride, meet me half way
Think it over, don't let it end this way.

[Instrumental]

Well, I'd be glad to take you back, again
And share with you my love that never end
Without you my world's not worth living in
So think it over, and let's try, again.

Think it over, don't let love fade away
Think it over, is there nothing left to say
Leave your pride, meet me half way
Think it over, don't let it end this way...
