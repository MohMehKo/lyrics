Oh, the bells started ringing and the birds started singing
And the clock on the corner struck two
Thunder started crashing and the lightning started flashing
And I knew I was falling for you

I was standing on the corner when I knew that I's a goner
The first time you came into view
My head started rocking and my knees started knocking
And I knew I was falling for you

Oh, the bells started ringing and the birds started singing
And the clock on the corner struck two
Thunder started crashing and the lightning started flashing
And I knew I was falling for you

(Well, you scared me half to death
I could hardly catch my breath
Your smile made my heart go boom
And when I looked into your eyes
I was almost paralyzed
And I knew I was falling for you)

Oh, the bells started ringing and the birds started singing
And the clock on the corner struck two
Thunder started crashing and the lightning started flashing
And I knew I was falling for you

Oh yes, I knew I was falling for you...
