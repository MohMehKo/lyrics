(Excuse me Miss but do you have any)
Blue Christmas lights
For my Christmas tree
I want some blue Christmas lights
Just as blue as me

The one I love has set me free
But I still got her memory
Give me blue Christmas lights
For my Christmas tree

(Pardon me but do you have any)
Blue Christmas lights
Blue they've gotta be
Blue Christmas lights
For that's how you left me

Although sweetheart you're far away
I'll kiss your picture Christmas Day
Under blue Christmas lights
On my Christmas tree

[Instrumental]

The one I love has set me free
But I still got her memory
Give me blue Christmas lights
For my Christmas tree

I'll have a blue Christmas
'Cause you're not here with me...
