Let the world keep on a turnin', let the fire keep on a burnin'
Let our love keep on a growin' to the sky
Let our ship of love keep sailin', keep the storm clouds far away
And hand in hand, we'll walk together side by side

Please don't pay me attention to someone that they should mention
As they saw me in the arms of Mary Jane
Oh, it's plain they're only jealous and their hearts are filled with malice
Their intention is to only bring us pain

Let the world keep on a turnin', let the fire keep on a burnin'
Let our love keep on a growin' to the sky
Let our ship of love keep sailin', keep the storm clouds far away
And hand in hand, we'll walk together side by side

When they try to cause us trouble, we'll politely pop their pubble
By ignoring any gossip they might start
So let the north wind keep a blowin', we'll be safe 'cause we'll be a-knowin'
That our love is safely locked inside our hearts

Let the world keep on a turnin', let the fire keep on a burnin'
Let our love keep on a growin' to the sky
Let our ship of love keep sailin', keep the storm clouds far away
And hand in hand we'll walk together side by side

Hand in hand we'll walk together side by side
Hand in hand we'll walk together side by side
