So you've found your Prince Charming
Was just a dream
There wasn't any Palace
And you weren't a Queen
In your faded cotton dresses
Anyone could see
But you're still Cinderella to me

Cinderella, Cinderella
This is not the way love should be
Cinderella, Cinderella
Won't you let me take you home with me

[Instrumental]

Our honeymoon may not be a fancy ball
You may not have a maid
And butler at your call
But I'll be more than any prince
Could ever be
And you'll be Cinderella to me

Cinderella, Cinderella
This is not the way love should be
Cinderella, Cinderella
Won't you let me take you home with me...
