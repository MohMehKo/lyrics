Here it is Christmas Day
And you're many miles away
And I wonder if you feel the way I do
In the air there's happiness
But in me there's loneliness
For all I want for Christmas dear is you

Presents wrapped in green and gold
Have no arms for me to hold
No lips to whisper softly I love you
Oh how happy I would be
To find you underneath my tree
For all I want for Christmas dear is you

[Instrumental]

Presents wrapped in green and gold
Have no arms for me to hold
No lips to whisper softly I love you
Oh how happy I would be
To find you underneath my tree
For all I want for Christmas dear is you...
