Well, here I sat high, getting ideas.
I ain't nothing but a fool to live like this.
Out all night, running wild,
Woman sitting home with a month old child.

[Chorus:]
I said, Dang me, Dang me
They ought to take a rope and hang me.
High, from the highest tree.
Woman would you weep for me

Beup Beup Beup Beup Beup Beup Buep
Beau Beau Beau Beum
One More time
Beup Beup Beup Beup Beup Beup Buep
Beau Beau Beau Beum

Sitting round drinking with the rest of the guys.
Six rounds bought, and I bought five.
I spent the groceries and half the rent,
Like 14 dollers and 27 cents.

[Chorus:]
I said, Dang me, Dang me
They ought to take a rope and hang me.
High, from the highest tree.
Woman, would you weep for me

Beup Beup Beup Beup Beup Beup Buep
Beau Beau Beau Beum
One More time
Beup Beup Beup Beup Beup Beup Buep
Beau Beau Beau Beum

Roses are red, and violets are purple
Sugars sweet and so is maple surple.
But I'm the seventh out of the seven sons.
My daddy was a pistol, I'm a son of a gun.

[Chorus:]
I said, Dang me, Dang me
They ought to take a rope and hang me.
High, from the highest tree.
Woman would you weep for me
