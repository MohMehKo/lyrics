I'm gonna live it up so you can live it down
I'm tired of being laughed at like like a clown
We'll see who's giving who the run around
I'm gonna live it up so you can live it down.

Well, they say that every dog's a gonna have his day
Well, now the time has come for this ol' hound to play
You'll find me where the lights're bright and gay
And while the sun shines I'll be a makin' hay.

I'm gonna live it up so you can live it down
I'm tired of being laughed at like like a clown
We'll see who's giving who the run around
I'm gonna live it up so you can live it down.

[Instrumental]

Well, you've had me by the nose now, long enough
But now I'm a gonna change and call your bluff
Stand back and gimme room to strut my stuff
And don't get in the way for the things might get rough.

I'm gonna live it up so you can live it down
I'm tired of being laughed at like like a clown
We'll see who's giving who the run around
I'm gonna live it up so you can live it down.

I'm gonna live it up so you can live it down...
