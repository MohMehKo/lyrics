It was with love my Saviour do me
To him it was with love, He led me from the dark
He gave me perfect gentle understanding
It was with love that Jesus won my heart.

It was with love he worked my transformation
Without his love this wonder could not be
And understanding well, my every evening
It was with love he heard this sinner's plea.

[Instrumental]

It was with love he spoke the invitation
Come follow me lay down your tools and gold
I'll love and serve my dear redeemer
Always it was with love that Jesus saved my soul...
