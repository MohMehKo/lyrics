I believe every lyin' word you told to me
When you whispered your sweet love belonged to me
How was I to know you would let me down
Well, that's how this lonely king won this lonely crown.

So long live the king, the king of fools
The king with the castle filled with gloom
A king whose treasures are just memories of you
Long live the king, the lonely king of fools.

[Instrumental]

When your fling is through
I know that you'll be back once more
And the king of fools will take you back just like before
You'll fool me till you find somebody new
Then once again, I'll be the lonely king of fools

So long live the king, the king of fools
The king with the castle filled with gloom
A king whose treasures are just memories of you
Long live the king, the lonely king of fools...
