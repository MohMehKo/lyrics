If I had you back again I'll tell you what I'd do
I'd dance a little jig of joy and turn a flip or two
My blue days would be over my long nights at an end
My heartaches would all vanish if I had you back again.

If I had you back again your sweet lips I would kiss
There'd never be a lonely moment only happiness
Hand in hand together we would find the rainbow's end
I'd walk the straight and narrow if I had you back again.

[Instrumental]

If I'd just one life to live I wanna be with you
And find again the feeling of a love that's sweet and true
I'd turn my back on everything my wild life I would end
I'd change my ways tomorrow if I had you back again.

I'd walk the straight and narrow if I had you back again...
