If I knew what made the world go round
Or made the raindrops tumble down
Then I'd know why I love you
If I knew what made the flowers bloom
Or made the Man up in the moon
Then I'd know why I love you.

If I knew what made the blue, blue sky
If I knew what made the robin fly
If I knew what made the chill of morning dew
If I knew what made the river flow
If I knew what made the north wind blow
Then I'd know why I love you.

If I knew what made the blue, blue sky
If I knew what made the robin fly
If I knew what made the chill of morning dew
If I knew what made the river flow
If I knew what made the north wind blow
Then I'd know why I love you.

Then I'd know why I love you...
