Each new day brings heartaches by the number
A memory of things that used to be
And each night alone I remember those kisses
That your lips once gave to me.

Take me back again, make me live again
Say those things you used to say to me
Kiss these lips of mine just like old times darling
Take me back again, again, again.

Day and night my love for you grows stronger
Every hour is filled with thoughts of you
And though you say that you love me no longer
That won't stop my arms from wanting you.

Take me back again, make me live again
Say those things you used to say to me
Kiss these lips of mine just like old times darling
Take me back again, again, again...
