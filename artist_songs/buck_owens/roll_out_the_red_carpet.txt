I'm gonna roll out the red carpet when you come home
I'm gonna treat you like a VIP
I feel like you ain't never known
Gonna have a brass band at the station
Gonna let 'em know what the united nation
I'm a gonna roll out the red carpet when you come home.

Well, I think I hear old 99 round in the bend
And I know it won't be long until you're in my arms again
I'm a gonna love you, hug and kiss you
Gonna let you know how much I miss you
I'm a gonna roll out the red carpet when you come home

I'm gonna roll out the red carpet when you come home
I'm gonna treat you like a VIP
I feel like you ain't never known
Gonna have a brass band at the station
Gonna let 'em know what the united nation
I'm a gonna roll out the red carpet when you come home.

[Instrumental]

Well, I worn out my best shoes walking the floor
And I won't sleep a wink till you knock on my door
Since I got a word that you was a comin'
The clock on the wall is about stop runnin'
I'm a gonna roll out the red carpet when you come home

I'm gonna roll out the red carpet when you come home
I'm gonna treat you like a VIP
I feel like you ain't never known
Gonna have a brass band at the station
Gonna let 'em know what the united nation
I'm a gonna roll out the red carpet when you come home...
