[Chorus - Buck & Rose:]
Will there be sweethearts in heaven
After we cross the line
If the angels have sweethearts
Then I want you for mine

[Buck:]
If I should go first and leave you behind
To face life alone, bare this in mind
[Rose:]
That I'll be a-waiting if heaven's my fate
To take you by the hand just inside the pearly gates

[Chorus:]
Will there be sweethearts in heaven
After we cross the line
If the angels have sweethearts
Then I want you for mine

[Instrumental]

[Buck:]
I'd be a tramp and sleep in the street
Or I'd be a begger with rags on my feet
[Rose:]
If I knew for sure when the time comes to part
Someday in heaven you'd be my sweetheart

[Chorus:]
Will there be sweethearts in heaven
After we cross the line
If the angels have sweethearts
Then I want you for mine...
