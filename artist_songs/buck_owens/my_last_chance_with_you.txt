Since you told me yesterday
There were things you had to say
I've been waiting for my last chance with you
Something big is on your mind
Like a spring you must unwind
So, I'm waiting for my last chance with you.

I'm preparing for tomorrow
When you'll break the news to me
I dare not show my sorrow
It's not a shoulder that I need.

I've a need for you to love me
And I tear somebody new
So I'm waiting for
My last chance with you.

[Instrumental]

I've rehearsed the scene all over
Pretending you were here
I've been practicing the presence of you
I've been wondering how you'd tell me
And planning what I'd do
While thinking bout my last chance with you.

If I don't win you tomorrow
Something tells me someone will
Wish I knew where I could borrow
Some love making skill.

I've a need for you to love me
And I tear somebody new
So I'm waiting for
My last chance with you...
