Well, a baby goes to candy, a horse he goes to hay
A tomcat goes for the nighttime they don't care much about they
A duck he goes for water, cool and deep and blue
A honeybee goes for honey, and honey I go for you.

Well, there never was a fool like a fool like me like a fool like me for you
And there never was a girl like a girl like you that could do the things you do
There never was a beat like my heartbeat like my heart beats for you
And there never was a fool like a fool like me like a fool like me for you.

[Instrumental]

Well, now a bo weevil goes for cotton and a flower goes for spring
A lover goes for the moonlight and a package goes for string
A banker goes for money the morning goes for dew
Well, a big bear goes for honey and honey I go for you.

Well, there never was a fool like a fool like me like a fool like me for you
And there never was a girl like a girl like you that could do the things you do
There never was a beat like my heartbeat like my heart beats for you
And there never was a fool like a fool like me like a fool like me for you...
