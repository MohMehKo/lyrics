When you're holdin' me, make sure that I'm the one to hold
Don't tell me that you love me it leaves me so cold
And please don't lie to me you know how that hurt
Don't wipe the tears that you cry for him on my good white shirt

When you're kissin' me, make sure that I'm the one you wanna kiss
Don't tell me that you miss me when it's him you really miss
And please me and think of him nothing could be worse
Don't wipe the tears that you cry for him on my good white shirt

Well, I dress my very best when I go out with of you
But I'd hate to think that I was just too well dressed blue
Don't love me for a little while what would that be worth
Don't wipe the tears that you cry for him on my good white shirt

Well, I dress my very best when I go out with you
But I'd hate to think that I was just too well dressed blue
Don't love me for a little while what would that be worth
Don't wipe the tears that you cry for him on my good white shirt

Don't wipe the tears that you cry for him on my good white shirt
