High as the sky is my love for you
Warm as the sun that comes shining through
Strong as a wave on the ocean blue
That's how I measure my love for you.

When I sleep all my dreams are just dreams of you
When I'm awake all my thoughts are of only you
I'd walk a mile just to see one little smile from you
That's how I measure my love for you.

[Instrumental]

When you're gone how I long for the sight of you
When you're near how I thrill to the touch of you
Right or wrong from now on I'll be a part of you
That's how I measure my love for you.

High as the sky is my love for you
Warm as the sun that comes shining through
Strong as a wave on the ocean blue
That's how I measure my love for you.

That's how I measure my love for you...
