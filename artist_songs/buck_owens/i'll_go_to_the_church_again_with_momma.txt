[Sang:]
I'll go to church again with momma
Someday in the sweet by and by
I'll go to church again with momma
Up there in the chapel in the skies.

[Spoken:]
You know when I was just a little boy
My momma used to take me to church
And we'd read the Bible, together
And we'd sing those wonderful old hymns
That just seemed to warm your heart, all over
Yes, I know those were the happiest days I've ever spent
When I went to church with momma

[Sang:]
I'll go to church again with momma
Up there in the chapel in the skies.

[Spoken:]
Now momma's gone to heaven to meet Jesus there
And I know she's happy there, Lord
And I know someday I'll meet her up there
And we'll sing and praise the Lord.
When I get to church again in heaven with momma

[Sang:]
I'll go to church again with momma
Someday in the sweet by and by
I'll go to church again with momma
Up there in the chapel in the skies...
