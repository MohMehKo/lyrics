Well, don't call my name out your window
I'm leavin', I won't ever turn my head
Don't send your kinfolks to give me no talkin'
I'll be gone like I said.

You'd say the same old things that you've been saying all along
Lay there in bed and keep your mouth shut till I'm gone
Don't give me that old familiar cussin', moanin', groan
Understand your man
Tidy your bad mouth and understand your man.

[Instrumental]

You can give my other suits to the Salvation Army
And anything else I leave behind
I ain't takin' nothin' that'll slow down my travelin'
While I'm untanglin' my mind.

I ain't gonna repear what I've said anymore
While I'm breathing air that ain't been breathed before
I'll be as gone as a wild goose in winter
Then you'll understand your man
You hear me talkin' honey, understand your man.

Remember what I tell you understand your man...
