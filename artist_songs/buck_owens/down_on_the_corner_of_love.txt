You'll find me hangin' around
It's there I'll be found
Down on the corner of love
Beneath the stars that shine
And the neon signs
I'll be down on the corner of love

When night starts to fall
And love starts to call
Down on the corner of love
You'll find me hangin' around
It's there I'll be found
Down on the corner of love

When it's late in the eve'nins
And I can't help but feelin'
That my heart you're a steelin'
'Neath the stars up above
When the sun goes down
And the moon comes 'round
I'll be down on the corner of love

When you're passin' by
Too lonesome to cry
Down on the corner of love
Just stop for a while
I'll teach you to smile
Down on the corner of love

A love that you had
Has treated you bad
Down on the corner of love
Forget what you knew
We'll start live anew
Down on the corner of love

When it's late in the eve'nins
And I can't help but feelin'
That my heart you're a steelin'
'Neath the stars up above
When the sun goes down
And the moon comes 'round
I'll be down on the corner of love

When it's late in the eve'nins
And I can't help but feelin'
That my heart you're a steelin'
'Neath the stars up above
When the sun goes down
And the moon comes 'round
I'll be down on the corner of love...
