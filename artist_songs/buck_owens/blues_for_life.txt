Well, I just got over one case of the blues
Now I've got another one that I can't lose
The pain of bein' lonely cuts like a knife
Looks like I'm gonna have the blues for life.

Yeah, the sun comes up and the sun goes down
The mean old blues will keep on comin' around
Looks like they're movin' right in to stay
I'm gonna be with 'em till my dyin' day,

Well, I'm up in the creek and I got no ore
Blues keep comin' round more and more
Don't know how it feels but it's been nice
Not to have to worry bout the blues for life.

[Instrumental]

Well, the guy next door really got it made
Stays every day layin' in the shade
Got no troubles nor grief nor strife
Never has to worry /bout the blues for life.

Yeah the sun comes up and the sun goes down
The mean old blues will keep on comin' around
Looks like they're movin' right in to stay
I'm gonna be with 'em till my dyin' day.

Well, I'm up in the creek and I got no ore
Blues keep comin' round more and more
Don't know how it feels but it's been nice
Not to have to worry bout the blues for life...
