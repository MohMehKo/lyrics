It seems like years and a million tears
Since you've left the old hometown
Now you've changed they say and the great white way
Is your new stomping ground.

Well, it's plain to see you've forgotten me
'Cause you never write or call
But I'll be around when they let you down
And I'll catch you when you fall.

I'll catch you when you fall
There's no one else but you
Now, you're flying high but honey by and by
You're gonna cry for love that's true.

So when you're uptown maybe
Starts giving you the stall
I'll be around when they let you down
And I'll catch you when you fall.

[Instrumental]

Well, I've heard it said they've turned your head
You're ashamed of us back home
But I'll bet the sound of a southern bound
Still chills you to the bone.

With your haughty pose and your uptown clothes
You're not fooling me at all
When you're feeling bad your ol' country lad
Is gonna catch you you fall.

I'll catch you when you fall
There's no one else but you
Now, you're flying high but honey by and by
You're gonna cry for love that's true.

So when you're uptown maybe
Starts giving you the stall
I'll be around when they let you down
And I'll catch you when you fall...
