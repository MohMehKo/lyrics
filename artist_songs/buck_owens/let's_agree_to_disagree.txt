The flame of love was burning high
We vowed to never let it die
But now you're growing tired of me
So let's agree to disagree.

Let's agree to disagree
There's nothing left for you and me
You won't be happy till you're free
So let's agree to disagree.

[Instrumental]

I'll miss you but I'll live somehow
In fact I miss you even now
But you don't want no part of me
So let's agree to disagree.

Let's agree to disagree
There's nothing left for you and me
You won't be happy till you're free
So let's agree to disagree...
