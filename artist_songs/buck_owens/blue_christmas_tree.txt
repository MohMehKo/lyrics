Dream is the color and joy it should be
But I've got a blue blue Christmas tree
You took the happiness God gave you and me
And all you left for Christmas is a blue Christmas tree.

Beneath it sets of package addressed to me from you
That I'm afraid to open I know it contains the blues
But merry Christmas darling wherever you may be
And I hope you will never have a blue Christmas tree.

[Instrumental]

Beneath it sets of package addressed to me from you
That I'm afraid to open I know it contains the blues
But merry Christmas darling wherever you may be
And I hope you will never have a blue Christmas tree...
