I heard no Christmas carols
As I walked down the street
I heard no Merry Christmas
From people I'd meet
It seemed you've made
The whole world blue
Christmas ain't Christmas
Dear, without you

I talked to a snowman
And to my surprise
When I spoke of you
He started to cry
Now that's pretty sad
To see a snowman
Turn blue
Christmas ain't Christmas
Dear, without you

[Instrumental]

No Christmas ain't Christmas
Since you went away
And now it seems like
Just any other day
Yes, you turned
My whole world blue
Christmas ain't Christmas
Dear, without you...
