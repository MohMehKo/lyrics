I'm goin' down, down, down,
Goin' down, down, down
Got nobody to love me now
I'm a sorrow bound bound bound
'Cause you're not around
Since you left I'm a goin'
Down, down, down.

Well I never thought my life would be so lonely
I never thought my head would hang so low
Well I love you my darling and you only
Don't know where you are but that's where I'd like to go.

I'm goin' down, down, down,
Goin' down, down, down
Got nobody to love me now
I'm a sorrow bound bound bound
'Cause you're not around
Since you left I'm a goin'
Down, down, down.

[Instrumental]

Well, quarrels so many was your reason
Could it be you never gave us time
For in your heart you desire a new one
If so then your heart is not with mine.

I'm goin' down, down, down,
Goin' down, down, down
Got nobody to love me now
I'm a sorrow bound bound bound
'Cause you're not around
Since you left I'm a goin'
Down, down, down.

Since you left I'm a goin' down, down, down...
