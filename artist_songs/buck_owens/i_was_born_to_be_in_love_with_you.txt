My arms were made to hold you
My lips were made to kiss you
My heart was made to know you
I was born to be in love with you.

My hands were made to touch you
My eyes were made to see you
My heart was made to know you
I was born to be in love with you.

I don't care how they talk about you
I don't care what they say
Nothing they do can make me doubt you
I'm with you all the way.

My arms were made to hold you
My lips were made to kiss you
My heart was made to know you
I was born to be in love with you.

I don't care how they talk about you
I don't care what they say
Nothing they do can make me doubt you
I'm with you all the way.

I was born to be in love with you...
