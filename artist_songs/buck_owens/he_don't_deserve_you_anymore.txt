When I found you, darling
Then he saw his big mistake
Saw what he was losin'
Felt his heart begin to break.

Please don't let him talk you back
The way he's done before
Why he's had a hundred chances
He don't deserve you anymore.

Let his eyes do the cryin'
Let his feet walk the floor
Let his heart do the breakin'
Like he's let yours break before.

Let his lips do the sighing
Let his heartaches start to sore
Let his arms do the aching
He don't deserve you anymore.

[Instrumental]

He took you for granted
And he only brought you shame
It was never his intention
To let you share his name.

The lonely hours you've waited now
Won't happen anymore
For it's his turn to feel the hurt
He don't deserve you anymore.

Let his eyes do the crying
Let his feet walk the floor
Let his heart do the breaking
Like he's let yours break before.

Let his lips do the sighing
Let his heartaches start to sore
Let his arms do the aching
He don't deserve you anymore...
