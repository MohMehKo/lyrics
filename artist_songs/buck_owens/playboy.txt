They call me a playboy
While I'm making my rounds
Chasing the bright lights
Of every night spot in town

Though I never show, son,
My heart's breaking in two
They may call me a playboy
But I'm just lonesome for you

I once had a real love
That was when I had you
Now, I'll never feel love
With anyone new

This false front I'm wearing
Is just to cover my blues
They may call me a playboy
But. I'm just lonesome for you

[Instrumental]

I once had a real love
That was when I had you
Now, I'll never feel love
With anyone new

This false front I'm wearing
Is to cover my blues
They may call me a playboy
But. I'm just lonesome for you

They may call me a playboy
But. I'm just lonesome for you.

They may call me a playboy
But. I'm just lonesome for you...
