My baby called me just today,
Said she's comin' back to stay
Without my baby I nearly lost my mind
But I'm gonna have love one more time.

I'm gonna have love one more time
All of my blues I'm gonna leave behind
Baby's comin' back and everything is fine
And I'm gonna have love, love, love, one more time.

[Instrumental]

Well, I've been hurtin' since she's been gone
But I'm through hurtin' from now on
I'm gonna hold to my baby like a clingin' vine
And I'm gonna have love one more time

I'm gonna have love one more time
All of my blues I'm gonna leave behind
Baby's comin' back and everything is fine
And I'm gonna have love, love, love, one more time.

Yeah, I'm gonna have love, love, love, one more time...
