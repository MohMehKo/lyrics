Well, when I saw you walkin' the avenue
Then I knew that you're for me
Yeah, you are just a pill that can fill the bill
So let's make the deal 'cause you're for me.

Don't tell me no, don't make me go
Can't you see that, you're for me
Come on baby, don't say maybe
Can't you see that, you're for me.

[Instrumental]

Well, stars that shine above
Fill my cup of love
When you're walkin' along with me
Yes and you've sure got the look
That can hit my book
Yeah, you just got a hook
'Cause you're for me.

Don't tell me no, don't make me go
Can't you see that, you're for me
Come on baby, don't say maybe
Can't you see that, you're for me...
