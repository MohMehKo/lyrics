You never think of givin', you only take
And you don't seem to care how many rules you break
Although I know you're wrong, I let you have your way
Anything to own your love just, one more day.

One way love that's all you have for me
One way love is just plain misery
I say that we're all through and then you call me up
And once again, I'm falling for your one way love.

[Instrumental]

I guess you never loved me and you never will
For it don't seem to matter to you, how I feel
So I'll play second fiddle if that's the only way
And hope that some day you'll come to my arms and stay.

One way love that's all you have for me
One way love is just plain misery
I say that we're all through and then you call me up
And once again, I'm falling for your one way love...
