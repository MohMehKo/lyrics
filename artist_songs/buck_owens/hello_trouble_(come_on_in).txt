Woke up this morning
Happy as could be
Looked out my window
And what did I see?
A comin' up my sidewalk
Just as plain as day
A well a here come trouble that I never thought I'd see
When you went away

Hello trouble, come on in
You talk about heartaches
Where'n the world ya been?
I ain't had the miseries
Since you been gone
Hello trouble, trouble, trouble
Welcome home

We'll make a pot of coffee
And you can rest your shoes
A you can tell me them sweet lies
And I'll listen to you
For I'm just a little part of
Of the life you've lived
But I'd rather have a little bit of trouble
Than to never know the love you give

Hello trouble, come on in
You talk about heartaches
Where'n the world ya been?
I ain't had the miseries
Since you been gone
Hello trouble, trouble, trouble
Welcome home
