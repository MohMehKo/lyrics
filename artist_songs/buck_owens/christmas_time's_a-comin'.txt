Well, there gonna be a big, fat turkey
There gonna be gravy and dressin'
There gonna be chicken and dumplins
Christmas time's a-comin'

There gonna be a lots a sweet sweets
Mincemeat, peach and pumpkin
Ain't that a gonna be somethin'
Christmas time's a-comin'

There's a gonna be a sleigh ride
Everybody's gonna go
We'll sing Christmas carols
As we ride through the snow

We're gonna call up the neighbors
And tell 'em to come a runnin'
Well, ain't that a gonna be somethin'
Christmas time's a-comin'

Well, there's a gonna be a sleigh ride
Everybody's gonna go
We'll sing Christmas carols
As we ride through the snow

We're gonna call up the neighbors
And tell 'em to come a runnin'
We're gonna have a celebration
Christmas time's a-comin'

Christmas time's a-comin'
Christmas time is here
