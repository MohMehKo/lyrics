Goodbye, good luck, God bless you
May you find what you're searching for
May your guardian angel walk with you
As you walk away from my door.

Oh, I made my first big mistake, dear
When I tried to be someone that I can't
And I can't live a life any longer
No I just can't be something that I ain't.

Goodbye, good luck, God bless you
May you find what you're searching for
May your guardian angel walk with you
As you walk away from my door.

[Instrumental]

Oh, you tried so hard to make me over
And do something that you were searching for
And there's no use to go on pretending
I could never live up to the part.

Goodbye, good luck, God bless you
May you find what you're searching for
May your guardian angel walk with you
As you walk away from my door...
