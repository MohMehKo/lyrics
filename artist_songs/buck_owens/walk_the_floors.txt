Since you went away I've had the blues
Everything is wrong since I lost you
Only God knows what I'm going through
Walk the floor and worry over you.

Haven't slept a wink since you've been gone
Don't know how I'll stand this very long
Only God knows what I'm going through
Walk the floor and worry over you.

[Instrumental]

Maybe someday you'll return to me
And things will be the way they used to be
Only you can make my dreams come true
Walk the floor and worry over you.

Haven't slept a wink since you've been gone
Don't know how I'll stand this very long
Only God knows what I'm going through
Walk the floor and worry over you...
