You find the thrill each time you let me down
You know if you need me I'll be around
And when all your love affairs come to an end
You know you can fool me again.

Fool me again, make my heart believe
That your sweet sweet love belongs to me
Yes, play the part and let my heart
Pretend come back and fool me again.

[Instrumental]

The same old line that keeps me hanging on
Is all I think about when I'm alone
And though I know how our love affair will end
Come back and fool me again.

Fool me again, make my heart believe
That your sweet sweet love belongs to me
Yes, play the part and let my heart
Pretend come back and fool me again...
