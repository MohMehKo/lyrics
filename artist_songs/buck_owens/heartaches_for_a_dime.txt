I called you on the phone to say I love you
That I'd stop by for you at nine
And my heart broke when you said it's all over
That someone else would take up all your time.

And that's a lot of heartaches for a dime
I'll never know what made you change your mind
I only know I've held you close and kissed you my last time
And that's a lot of heartaches for a dime.

[Instrumental]

I went downtown to join the merry makers
And told myself that here's where I belong
I thought that I could get along without you
Until I heard somebody play our song

And that's a lot of heartaches for a dime
I'll never know what made you change your mind
I only know I've held you close and kissed you my last time
And that's a lot of heartaches for a dime...
