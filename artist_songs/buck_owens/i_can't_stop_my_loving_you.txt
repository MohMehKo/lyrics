You turn your head
Each time I meet you
On the street
I brush your arm
As you pass by
But you won't speak
I call you on
The telephone
But can't get through
But I, can't stop my loving you.

Can't sleep at night
Can't hold you tight
Since this loneliness
Replaced the love we knew
I still hang around
Though you turned me down
For I, can't stop my loving you.

[Instrumental]

So many times
I've tried to find
Somebody new
To feel again
The feeling
I once felt with you
Though some one else
Is doin' things
I used to do
I can't, stop my loving you.

Can't sleep at night
Can't hold you tight
Since this loneliness
Replaced the love we knew
I still hang around
Though you turned me down
For I, can't stop my loving you...
