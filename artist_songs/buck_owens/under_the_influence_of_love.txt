She knew I knew that she was out to get me
But I just close my eyes and let it be
Now she walks by me like she never met me
I didn't even make a memory

For I was under the influence of love
I wonder now what I was thinking of
Yes I was so in love I let her
Hurtin' me though I knew better
Under the influence of love

Why did I let her do me like she done me
Why can't I get that woman off my mind
Although I know she never truly loved me
I wish she break my heart just one time

For I was under the influence of love
I wonder now what I was thinking of
Yes I was so in love I let her
Hurtin' me though I knew better
Under the influence of love
