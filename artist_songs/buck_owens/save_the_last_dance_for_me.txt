You can dance, every dance with the guy
Who gives you the eye, let him hold you tight
You can smile, every smile for the guy
Who holds your hand 'neath the pale moonlight
But don't forget who's takin' you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
Oh, darlin' save the last dance for me

Yes, I know that the music's fine
Like sparklin' wine, go and have your fun
Dance and sing, but while we're apart
Don't give your heart to anyone
And don't forget who's takin' you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
Oh, darlin' save the last dance for me

[Instrumental]

You can dance, go and carry on
Till the night is gone
And it's time to go
If she asks if you're all alone
Can he take you home, you must tell him no
And don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
Oh, darling,save the last dance for me

You can dance, every dance with the guy
Who gives you the eye, let him hold you tight
You can smile, every smile for the guy
Who holds your hand 'neath the pale moonlight
But don't forget who's takin' you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
Oh, darlin' save the last dance for me...
