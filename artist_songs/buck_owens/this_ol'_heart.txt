This old heart has been around
It's been up and it's been down
It's been walked on all over town
But it still looks for love to come around.

It's got memories of the past
Of love affairs that didn't last
It's been stood up by every girl in town
But it still looks for love to come around.

[Instrumental]

Are you the next one to come along
To give it hope and then do it wrong
Or will it be true love that last
And wipe out all the tears from the past.

Well, This old heart has been around
It's been up and it's been down
It's been walked on all over town
But it still looks for love to come around.

Oh yes, it still looks for love to come around...
