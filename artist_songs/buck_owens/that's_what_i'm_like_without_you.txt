Like a man without a future,
Like a chalk without a slate
Like a jail without a jailer,
Like a bird without a mate

Like a song without a title,
Like a morning without dew
Like a heart without a heartbeat,
That's what I'm like without you.

[Instrumental]

Like a city with no people,
Like a show without a stage
Like a prince without a princess,
Like a book without a page

Like a ship without a harbor,
Like the sky without the blue
Like a heart without a heartbeat,
That's what I'm like without you...
