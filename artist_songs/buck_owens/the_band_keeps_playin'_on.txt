You walked in with me
But you walked out with someone else
And left me sitting here
Alone all by myself.

I thought you were over him
But I was wrong
My world stopped
But the band keeps playin' on.

They just keep playin'
They don't notice you were gone
You walked right out on me
While they played our favorite song.

And before you reached the door
My teardrops hit the floor
My world stopped
But the band keeps playin' on.

[Instrumental]

Well, you said you'd forgotten him
And no more did you care
But when we walked in
Your eyes lit up as you saw him sitting there.

Well, he asked you to dance
And just like that you were gone
And my world stopped
But the band keeps playin' on.

They just keep playin'
They don't notice you were gone
You walked right out on me
While they played our favorite song.

And before you reached the door
My teardrops hit the floor
My world stopped
But the band keeps playin' on...
