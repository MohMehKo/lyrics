Back in my arms again
Back in my dreams again
Back to this lonely world of mine.
No need to call for me
Just come on home to me
You know you're welcome anytime.

I guess it wasn't in the cards
For our love to go on
I found you had another on your mind.
But if your deal don't work out
The way you think it should
Come on home you're welcome anytime.

Back in my arms again
Back in my dreams again
Back to this lonely world of mine
No need to call for me
Just come on home to me
You know you're welcome anytime.

[Instrumental]

Well, I've heard that your new love
Is not the love you've planned
You call me to say you change your mind.
If you were just another girl
I wouldn't care at all
But I love you so you're welcome anytime.

Back in my arms again
Back in my dreams again
Back to this lonely world of mine.
No need to call for me
Just come on home to me
You know you're welcome anytime.
