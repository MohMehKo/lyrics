I'll lay it on the line and
I'm a gonna make you mine
I think I better warn you
It's only just a matter of time.

Your as good as gone
Or my name ain't Don
I'm gonna make you mine
I'm tellin' you straight
I'm a layin' it on the line.

Well, the first time I looked
Into your big brown eyes
You really gave me a thrill
You were pretty and sweet
And everything neat
And dressed up fit to kill.

I knew right then
I had to win
Your heart and
I don't mean maybe
I'll lay it on the line
And I gotta make
You my baby.

I'll lay it on the line and
I'm a gonna make you mine
I think I better warn you
It's only just a matter of time.

Your as good as gone
Or my name ain't Don
I'm gonna make you mine
I'm tellin' you straight
I'm a layin' it on the line.

[Instrumental]

Well, I'm just a homegrown
Country man
That ain't been much to school
Oh, but I don't take much
Of schoolin' and such
To know that I want you
Yeah, I can feel
A need in me
Without you dear
I'm a hurtin'
I'm layin' it on the line
I gotta have you for certain.

I'll lay it on the line and
I'm a gonna make you mine
I think I better warn you
It's only just a matter of time.

Your as good as gone
Or my name ain't Don
I'm gonna make you mine
I'm tellin' you straight
I'm a layin' it on the line.

Yeah, I'm tellin' you straight
I'm a layin' it on the line...
