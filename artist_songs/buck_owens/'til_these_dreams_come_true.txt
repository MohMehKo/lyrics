The sun never shines that I don't think of you
And night always finds me a missin' you
But the only way I'm ever close to you
Is when I close my eyes and dream of you.

I dream of holding you tight each day and night
And kissing your sweet sweet lips
I dream of calling you mine, mine all the time
And I'll keep dreaming till these dreams come true.

[Instrumental]

Well, maybe it never was meant to be
And maybe you never were meant for me
But until I find a way to be with you
I'll keep dreaming till these dreams come true.

I dream of holding you tight each day and night
And kissing your sweet sweet lips
I dream of calling you mine, mine all the time
And I'll keep dreaming till these dreams come true...
