Well, if you got a Cadillac, boy
And a forty room shack, boy
A bucket full of money
And a tree full of honey.

But if you gettin' no huggin'
No smoochin' or a muggin'
Well, if you ain't lovin'
Then you ain't livin'.

Well, if you're ridin' on the gravy train
Instead of walkin' down lovers lane
You can't make hay, boy
You're goin' the wrong way, boy.

You gotta get a little honey
For it's better than money
Well, if you ain't lovin'
Then you ain't livin'.

[Instrumental]

Well, if they call you a big big man
'Cause you got a lot of bottom land
If you're kin to the president
And if you help run the government.

But if you get no attention
You better off on a pension
For if you ain't lovin'
Then you ain't livin'.

Well, if you got a string of long long cars
And you're smokin' them four-bit cigars
Well, you ain't so well to do
Unless you get a little coochy coo.

It takes a little of smackin'
Or your life is a lackin'
Well, if you ain't lovin'
Then you ain't livin'...
