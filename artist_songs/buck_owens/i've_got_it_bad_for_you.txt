I worship the ground that you walk on
I breathe every breath for you
I live every day to make you happy
Yes, I've got it bad for you.

I hurt every time someone hurts you
I cry every time they make you blue
I live every day to make you happy
Yes, I've got it bad for you.

I know I'd die if you ever should leave me
For my whole world turns around you
I live every day to make you happy
Yes, I've got it bad for you.

Yes, I've got it bad for you...
