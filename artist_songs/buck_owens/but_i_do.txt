I didn't think that I'd miss you but I do
I didn't think I'd feel lonely but I do
I didn't think that everyday would be so long while you're away
I didn't think that I'd love you but I do.

Do you long for someone's arms like I do
Do you wish that you were here like I do
Do you think our love would last if we'd forget about the past
Do I want our love to live yes I do.

[Instrumental]

Do you wish that God would bind us like I do
Do you wish that joy would find us like I do
If you wish that you could spend life with me until the end
Then you'd feel our love like I do.

I didn't think that I'd miss you but I do
I didn't think I'd feel lonely but I do
I didn't think that everyday would be so long while you're away
I didn't think that I'd love you but I do...
