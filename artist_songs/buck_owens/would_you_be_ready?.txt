There are lots of hard times
Christians living round us every day
Six days for earthly pleasure
Leaving one day off to pray.

But they're standin' face to Saviour
If it was a judgement day
Would they be ready
If Jesus came today?

Would you be ready
If Jesus came today?
Would you be ready
To follow in his way?

Would he take you by the hand
Or would he have you turn away
Would you be ready
If Jesus came today?

[Instrumental]

Well, he tells us in the Bible
Just exactly what to do
You'd better read it brother
It's meant for me and you.

Better have your answer ready
If today should be the day
Would you be ready
If Jesus came today?

Would you be ready
If Jesus came today
Would you be ready
To follow in his way.

Would he take you by the hand
Or would he have you turn away
Would you be ready
If Jesus came today?..
