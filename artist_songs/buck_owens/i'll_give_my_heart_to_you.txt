If you'll hold me close and kiss me
Promise that you'll always miss me
Say you'll never never, never be untrue
If you swear you'll always love me
And you'll place no one above me
Well, then I'll give my heart to you.

If I'm number one in your heart
If you're sure that we'll never part
If you're ready now to make my dreams come true
Well, then I'll give my heart to you.

If you'll hold me close and kiss me
Promise that you'll always miss me
Say you'll never never, never be untrue
If you swear you'll always love me
And you'll place no one above me
Well, then I'll give my heart to you.

[Instrumental]

Well, if you're all through painting the town
If you're ready now to settle down
If you're sure I'm the only one for you
Well then, I'll give my heart to you.

If you'll hold me close and kiss me
Promise that you'll always miss me
Say you'll never never, never be untrue
If you swear you'll always love me
And you'll place no one above me
Well, then I'll give my heart to you...
