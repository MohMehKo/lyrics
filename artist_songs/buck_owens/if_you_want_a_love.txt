If you want a love that never will die
A love that will always be by your side
If you want a heart that beats just for you
Well, that's the kind that I have in mind if you want my love.

If you want a kiss that will never grow cold
If you want two arms to have and to hold
A tender caress when each day is through
Well, that's the kind that I have in mind if you want my love.

[Instrumental]

If you want to spend your lifetime with me
If you want a love through eternity
If you want a home that's made just for you
Well, that's the kind that I have in mind if you want my love...
