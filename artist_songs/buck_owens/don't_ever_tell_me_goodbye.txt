Hurt me as much as you want to
If tears make you happy, then I'll cry
Do anything that you want to
But don't ever tell me goodbye.

Break my heart if that brings pleasure
And take the twinkle from my eyes
Do anything that you want to
But don't ever tell me goodbye.

Don't tell me goodbye whatever you do
For I just couldn't live if I ever lost you.

Tell our friends that it's all over
Say that the fault was all mine
Do anything that you want to
But don't ever tell me goodbye.

Oh, don't ever tell me goodbye...
