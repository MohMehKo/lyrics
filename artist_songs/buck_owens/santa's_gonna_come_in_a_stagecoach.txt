Well, I've been sorta worried
About Santa Claus this year
'Cause we live way out west
And it didn't snow out here
Well, I'm a tellin' you not to worry
'Cause I just got the word
Everybody listen closely
And I'll tell you what I heard

[Chorus:]
Santa's comin' in a stagecoach
'Stead of his trusty sleigh
He'll have horses instead of reindeer
To carry him on his way
'Cause the weatherman had some problems
He couldn't get snow you see
Santa's gonna come in a stagecoach
When he visits you and me

[Instrumental]

Well, Santa can't bring his reindeer
He'll leave him far away
But don't you worry about him
He's gonna be here Christmas Day
He's gotta big red stagecoat
With jingle bells and all
And there's gonna be merry Christmas
A merry Christmas for all

[Chorus:]
Santa's gonna come in a stagecoach
'Stead of his trusted sleigh
He'll have horses instead of reindeer
To carry him on his way
'Cause the weatherman had some problems
He couldn't get snow you see
Santa's gonna come in a stagecoach
When he visits you and me

Santa's gonna come in a stagecoach
When he visits you and me...
