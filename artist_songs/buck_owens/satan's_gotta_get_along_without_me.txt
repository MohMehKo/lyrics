Well, now since I turned old Satan down
I know for sure I'm heaven bound
There ain't nothing he can do to stop me
Since he showed me heaven's light
I know for sure I'm headed right
Satan's gotta get along without me.

Well, now Satan's gotta get along without me
'Cause I've been Satan's sin for evermore
Satan's gotta get along without me
'Cause I'm goin' to heaven with my Lord.

[Instrumental]

Well, now Satan might have had a chance
Though once he had me in his grasp
But that was a long, long time ago
Since I've broke the chain of sin
I know for sure that he can't win.

I'm a goin' to heaven with my Lord.

Well, now Satan's gotta get along without me
'Cause I've been Satan's sin for evermore
Satan's gotta get along without me
'Cause I'm goin' to heaven with my Lord.

Yeah now, I'm a goin' to heaven with my Lord...
