Why don't my mommy stay with my daddy and me
Why does my daddy cry when I ask where can you be
Why don't you come home then we won't be alone
Why don't my mommy stay with my daddy and me

Each night he's so lonesome cause he don't understand
That you'd rather be dancing to a honky tonk band
I don't know what to tell him when he climbs upon my knee
And ask why don't my mommy stay with my daddy and me

Why don't my mommy stay with my daddy and me
Why does my daddy cry when I ask where can you be
Why don't you come home then we won't be alone
Why don't my mommy stay with my daddy and me
