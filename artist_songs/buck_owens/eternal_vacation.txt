Some people are taking vacation
Traveling both far and near
Ever stop and think about Jesus
Ever see him to have a care
It seems that I cannot be like them
While on earth life's burdens I bear
And I prepare to meet Jesus
And rest eternally there.

Yes, someday I'll take a vacation
One that never will end
When I'll cross old river Jordan
My Saviour will welcome me in
For me the gates will swing open
And I'll have a mansion within
There I will rest up in heaven
A rest that never will end.

[Instrumental]

Yes, some people own fine mansions
Some live in much luxury
Never having a thought about Saviour
Of where they'll spend eternity
And though I cannot be like them
I'm building my mansion on high
Yes, someday I'll rest up in heaven
And leave this old cruel world, goodbye.

Yes, someday I'll take a vacation
One that never will end
When I'll cross old river Jordan
My Saviour will welcome me in
For me the gates will swing open
And I'll have a mansion within
There I will rest up in heaven
A rest that never will end...
