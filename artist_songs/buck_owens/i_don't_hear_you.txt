I hear the bluebirds singing,
I hear the robins too
I hear the church bells ringing
But I don't hear you.

I see little things marked his and hers
A constant reminder we're through
I hear the rain on my window
But I don't hear you.

[Instrumental]

I hear the children playing
I hear the clock striking two
I hear the mailman whistling
But I don't hear you.

I see little things marked his and hers
A constant reminder we're through
I hear the rain on my window
But I don't hear you.

Oh, but I don't hear you...
