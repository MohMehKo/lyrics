I'd give up wordly ambition
I'd give up my wordly ways
And I took my trust in Jesus
I know he'll take me all the way.

I'll go all the way with Jesus
All the way to heaven's door
I'll go all the way with Jesus
And stand on heaven's golden floor.

[Instrumental]

Oh, I know my Saviour love me
For he forgave my every sin
And when old Gabriel's trumpet
Sounds at heaven's gate He'll let me in.

I'll go all the way with Jesus
All the way to heaven's door
I'll go all the way with Jesus
And stand on heaven's golden floor...
