I've been all over the world
But no other girl ever thrilled me
The way that you do
Ain't it amazing how I love you.

Well, I left my Gracie
And I cought a big train
Searching for wealth and fame
But every clickety-clack
Of the railroad track
Seemed to bring out my Gracie's name.

Well, ain't it amazing Gracie
How much that I love you
I've been all over the world
But no other girl ever thrilled me
The way that you do
Ain't it amazing how I love you.

Well she's not the prettiest girl
In the world I know
She's not the smartest one too
But she's always there
And I know she cares
And I know her little heart is true
Well ain't it amazing Gracie.

[Instrumental]

I met a lot of pretty girls
Wherever I'd go
None could ever take her place
'Cause everytime I'd look into their eyes
I keep a seein' my Gracie's face
Well ain't it amazing Gracie...
