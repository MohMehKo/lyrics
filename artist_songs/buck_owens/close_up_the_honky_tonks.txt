She's in some honky tonk tonight I know
She's dancing where the music's loud and lights're low
In a crowded bar she likes to hang around
And as long as there's a honky tonk she'll never settle down
So close up the honky tonks lock all the doors
Don't let the one I love go there anymore
Close up the honky tonks throw away the key
Then maybe the one I love will come back to me

I wish I had the power to turn back the time
And live again the hours when she was all mine
But it hurts to see her running with that crowd downtown
And as long as there's a honky tonk she'll never settle down
So close up the honky tonks...
