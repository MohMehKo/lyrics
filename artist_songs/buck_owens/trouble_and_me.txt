Trouble and me we're old buddies you see
I've stuck by him and he's a stickin' by me
Well, goodbye honey, be thankful you're free
And that you're not stuck with ol' trouble and me.

Trouble and me we keep a bummin' around
I'm picking 'em up and laying 'em down
Well, officer we're only passing through town
Looking for somethin' that we'd never found.

Trouble and me we're old buddies you see
I've stuck by him and he's a stickin' by me
Well, goodbye honey, be thankful you're free
And that you're not stuck with ol' trouble and me.

[Instrumental]

Well, once I thought that trouble had found someone else
I came close to findin' a place for myself
About that time he came back with a frown
And trouble and me had to find a new town.

Trouble and me we're old buddies you see
I've stuck by him and he's a stickin' by me
Well, goodbye honey, be thankful you're free
And that you're not stuck with ol' trouble and me...
