I've tried so hard for so long to be part of your plan
But I can't go no longer not knowing where I stand
If your heart beats for someone else and our love has grown cold
Oh darling, if I'm losin' you, I've got a right to know.

I've got a right to know just where I stand
I've got a right to know if I'm your man
If fate has changed the plans we've made the happiness I know
Oh darling, if I'm losin' you I've got a right to know.

[Instrumental]

I've tagged along through right and wrong because I worship you
To prove my love there's not a thing that I wouldn't do
Yes, I've stood by through tear dimmed eyes and hoped it didn't show
Oh darling, if I'm losin' you I've got a right to know.

I've got a right to know just where I stand
I've got a right to know if I'm your man
If fate has changed the plans we've made the happiness I know
Oh darling, if I'm losin' you I've got a right to know...
