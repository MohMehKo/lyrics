Oh, you must pray every day, pray every day
Pray to God up above
You've got to go all the way, get down on your knees
And pray show him all your love.

When your life is lonely and everything is wrong
And you don't know what to do
Just get down on your knees and look up to heaven
And say a prayer or two.

Oh, you must pray every day, pray every day
Pray to God up above
You've got to go all the way, get down on your knees
And pray show him all your love.

[Instrumental]

If old Satan comes a knockin' on your door don't let him in
He's got his eye on you
Don't be tempted my friend 'cause all he is a sin
And he'll only bring sorrow to you.

Oh, you must pray every day, pray every day
Pray to God up above
You've got to go all the way, get down on your knees
And pray show him all your love...
