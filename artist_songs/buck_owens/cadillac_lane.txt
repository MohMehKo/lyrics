I wish I was a rich man a livin' on Cadillac Lane
And I'd tour the world in a great big shiny plane
I'd go to all the famous places like Italy, Rome and Spain
If I was a rich man a livin' on Cadillac Lane.

I wish I was a rich man a livin' on Cadillac Lane
I'd had my own private car on some big railroad train
I'd never have to work again for the doggone thing
If I was a rich man a livin' on Cadillac Lane.

[Instrumental]

Well, there's a lotta rich people livin' on Cadillac Lane
Eatin' caviar and a drinkin' pink champagne
But I've got your love and to me that's everything
And I'm not so sure about the people on Cadillac Lane.

I wish I was a rich man a livin' on Cadillac Lane
I'd had my own private car on some big railroad train
I'd never have to work again for the doggone thing
If I was a rich man a livin' on Cadillac Lane.

But who needs to be a rich man a livin' on Cadillac Lane?
