Only you, can make my dreams come true
Only you, can turn my skies to blue
Love like ours, should not be far apart
Only you, can break my heart.

[Instrumental]

Only you, can end these sleepless nights
Only you, can make things turn out right
You and you alone, can keep us far apart
Only you, can break my heart.

Only you can break my heart...
