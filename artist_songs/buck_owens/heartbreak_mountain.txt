Well, I'm goin' up on Heartbreak Mountain
Yeah, I'm goin' up on Heartbreak Hill
I'm goin' up on Heartbreak Mountain
'Cause I've lost my will to live.

It was six o'clock yesterday mornin'
When my sweet baby packed up to leave
It was six o'clock yesterday mornin'
And I ain't done nothin' but grieve.

Well, I'm goin' up on Heartbreak Mountain
Yeah, I'm goin' up on Heartbreak Hill
I'm goin' up on Heartbreak Mountain
'Cause I've lost my will to live.

[Instrumental]

Well, I cried and I begged and I pleaded
For my sweet baby not to go
Like the leaf that's caught in a whirl wind
Where she's gone now I'll never know.

Well, I'm goin' up on Heartbreak Mountain
Yeah, I'm goin' up on Heartbreak Hill
I'm goin' up on Heartbreak Mountain
'Cause I've lost my will to live.

[Instrumental]

Now why does a man let a woman
Turn him into a hollow shelf
And walk up and leave him behind her
Like a ship at sea with no sail.

Well, I'm goin' up on Heartbreak Mountain
Yeah, I'm goin' up on Heartbreak Hill
I'm goin' up on Heartbreak Mountain
'Cause I've lost my will to live...
