It must be that time again the snow is falling
In the air there's happiness that you can't see
From the little country church the bells are ringing
Oh, it's Christmas time for everyone but me

[Chorus:]
Oh, it's Christmas time for everyone but me
The lights are shining brightly on the tree
It's the season of the cheer
How I wish that you would here
Oh, it's Christmas time for everyone but me

[Instrumental]

Oh, everything is nothing, dear without you
And it's hard to live with just a memory
For, I need your love to give each day a meaning
Oh, it's Christmas time for everyone but me

[Chorus:]
Oh, it's Christmas time for everyone but me
The lights are shining brightly on the tree
It's the season of the cheer
How, I wish that you would here
Oh, it's Christmas time for everyone but me...
