I'm a-going down, down, down to the river
And there ain't nobody gonna have to hold my hand
I'm a-going down, down, down to the river
Gonna bury my troubles in the river bottom sand

You said goodbye to me this morning
And slowly walked out of my life
I don't know how I'll live without you
I only know I've gotta try

I'm a-going down, down, down to the river
And there ain't nobody gonna have to hold my hand
I'm a-going down, down, down to the river
Gonna bury my troubles in the river bottom sand

The telephone has started ringing
Friends call to see if it is true
I don't know words to say it's over
I only know that I love you

I'm a-going down, down, down to the river
And there ain't nobody gonna have to hold my hand
I'm a-going down, down, down to the river
Gonna bury my troubles in the river bottom sand
