Oh, I'm the number one heel in the country
I'm the top of the list it's plain to see
And you're the number one fool that still loves me
Number one heel is all I'll ever be.

You gave me your love with no reservation
My every wish was your every command
You built all of our future together
Your broken heart wasn't part of the plan.

Oh, I'm the number one heel in the country
I'm the top of the list it's plain to see
And you're the number one fool that still loves me
Number one heel is all I'll ever be.

[Instrumental]

Oh, I made such beautiful speeches
And the pictures I painted seemed real
Trusting you, you had no way of knowing
That I'd turn out to be such a heel.

Oh, I'm the number one heel in the country
I'm the top of the list it's plain to see
And you're the number one fool that still loves me
Number one heel is all I'll ever be...
