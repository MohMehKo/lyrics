After you leave me, after you're gone
I'll sit here crying so blue and alone
And when the door closes
I'll close my heart too

After you leave me what will I do
After you've taken the beat of my heart
After you've torn my world all apart
My life will be worthless here without you
After you leave me what will I do

[Instrumental]

After you've taken the beat of my heart
After you've torn my world all apart
My life will be worthless here without you
After you leave me what will I do
