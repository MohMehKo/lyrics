I'm as sad as a bird that can't sing
I'm lonely as a bell that can't ring
I'm blue as the sky up above
I'm just someone with no one to love.

No one,
No one,
I'm just someone
With no one to love.

[Instrumental]

I'm as sad as a leaf in the wind
I'm lonely as a man with no friend
I'm cold as a hand with no glove
I'm just someone with no one to love.

No one,
No one,
I'm just someone
With no one to love.

I'm just someone
With no one to love...
