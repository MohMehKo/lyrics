If you fall out of love with me don't let me know
If someone else is on your mind don't let it show
For I'd rather have your lie I could never stand goodbye
If you fall out of love with me don't let me know.

If you find somebody new don't let me know
If your love for me is through don't let it show
If I ask you please don't say darlin' turn and walk away
If you fall out of love with me don't let me know.

[Instrumental]

If your love for me is gone don't let me know
If someone else is in your dreams don't let it show
Close your eyes so I won't see for I don't want sympathy
If you fall out of love with me don't let me know...
