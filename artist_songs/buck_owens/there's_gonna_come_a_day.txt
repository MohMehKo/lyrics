There's a gonna come a day you're gonna sit and cry
There's a gonna come a day you're gonna sit and cry
When your new love leaves you and wanders far away
Remember what I'm a tellin' you, there's a gonna come a day.

There's a gonna come a time you're gonna be all alone
There's a gonna come a time you're gonna be all alone
You're gonna reach to touch me but I'll be far away
Remember what I'm a tellin' you, there's a gonna come a day.

There's a gonna come a day you're gonna sit and cry
There's a gonna come a day you're gonna sit and cry
When your new love leaves you and wanders far away
Remember what I'm a tellin' you, there's a gonna come a day.

[Instrumental]

There's a gonna come a time you're gonna look around
There's a gonna come a time you're gonna look around
You're gonna open your big blue eyes but it's gonna be too late
Remember what I'm a sayin' now, there's a gonna come a day.

There's a gonna come a day you're gonna sit and cry
There's a gonna come a day you're gonna sit and cry
When your new love leaves you and wanders far away
Remember what I'm a tellin' you there's a gonna come a day...
