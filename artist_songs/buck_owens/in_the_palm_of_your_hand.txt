I dance every time you pull the string
I cry every time you treat me mean
I lie when I say we're only friends
I know I'm right in the palm of your hand.

In the palm of your hand that's where you've got me
Yes, Loving you is messin' up my mind
But try, yes I may, I just can't stop me
You've got me right in the palm of your hand.

[Instrumental]

I laugh every time you have a fling
I hurt every time you cause a scene
I lie when I say we've reached the end
I know I'm right in the palm of your hand.

In the palm of your hand...
