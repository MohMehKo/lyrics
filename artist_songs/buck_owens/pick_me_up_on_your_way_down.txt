You were mine for just awhile,
Now you're putting on the style,
And you never once looked back,
To your home across the track,

You're the gossip of the town,
But my heart can still be found,
Where you tossed it on the ground,
Pick me up on your way down,

[Chorus:]
Pick me up on your way down,
When you're blue and all alone,
When their glamour starts to bore you,
Come on back where you belong,

When you learn these things are true,
I'll be waiting here for you,
When you tumble to the ground
Pick me up on your way down,

[Instrumental]

They have changed your attitude,
Made you hoggie, and so rude,
Your new friends can take the blame,
Underneath you're still the same,

You may be their pride and joy,
But they'll find another toy,
When your true love can't be found
Pick me up on your way down,

[Chorus:]
Pick me up on your way down,
When you're blue and all alone,
When their glamour starts to bore you,
Come on back where you belong,

When you learn these things are true,
I'll be waiting here for you,
When you tumble to the ground
Pick me up on your way down...
