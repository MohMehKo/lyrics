There'll be no other
To make me cry
There'll be no other
To make me blue
I can't deceive you
I'll always believe you
There'll be no other
While I'm lovin' you.

No, other arms
No, other kisses
To thrill me now
So I'll be true
Each night I'm sayin'
To him I'm prayin'
There'll be no other
While I'm lovin' you

[Instrumental]

Though I might find love
I'll never try
'Cause your my first love
My heart's with you
My only heads out
I can't forget thou
There'll be no others
While I'm lovin' you

No, other arms
No, other kisses
To thrill me now
So I'll be true
Each night I'm sayin'
To him I'm prayin'
There'll be no other
While I'm lovin' you...
