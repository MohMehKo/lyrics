Diggy Liggy Li and Diggy Liggy Lo
Fell in love at the fais-do-do
The pop was cold and the coffee chaud
For Diggy Liggy Li and Diggy Liggy Lo.

[Refrain:]
Diggy Liggy Li loved Diggy Liggy Lo
Everyone knew he was her beau
No one else could ever show
So much love for Diggy Liggy Lo.

[Instrumental]

There's a place they find romance
Where they do the Cajun dance
Steal a kiss with ev'ry chance
Show their love with ev'ry glance.

[Refrain:]
Diggy Liggy Li loved Diggy Liggy Lo
Everyone knew he was her beau
No one else could ever show
So much love for Diggy Liggy Lo.

[Instrumental]

Finally went to see her Pa
Now he's got a Pa-in-law
Moved out where the Bayou's low
Now he's got a little Diggy Liggy Lo.

[Refrain:]
Diggy Liggy Li loved Diggy Liggy Lo
Everyone knew he was her beau
No one else could ever show
So much love for Diggy Liggy Lo...
