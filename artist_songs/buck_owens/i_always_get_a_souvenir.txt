I'm not a stamp collector but I've got a hobby too
Bringin' home a souvenir, trinkets old and new
Feathers from a rooster fight, a whistle from a fair
I always get a souvenir to prove that I was there.

Well, I've got a piece of silky thread from bashful Mary's gown
A nugget from a stream of gold and a red nose from a clown
A horseshoe from a rodeo, a claw from a bear
Well, I always get a souvenir to prove that I was there.

I always get a souvenir everywhere I go
Well, I've got some little something from every girl I know
A pair of fuzzy bobby socks, a lock of curly hair
I always get a souvenir to prove that I was there.

[Instrumental]

Well, I took a burned out piston from a winning racer car
Well, I've even got a G string from Gene Sheppard's guitar
I've collected everything, soap to silverware
I always get a souvenir to prove that I was there.

Well, now I'm not bragging when I say with women I have dealt
Well, you can tell I've been there by the notches on my belt
Yes, I've collected different things from every love affair
I always get a souvenir to prove that I was there.

I've got a fine collection but you're my pride and joy
You're the one I like the best, you make me a happy boy
To trade you for a million things hon, I wouldn't dare
'Cause you and me are gonna get me another souvenir...
