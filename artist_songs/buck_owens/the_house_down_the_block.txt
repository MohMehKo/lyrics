The house my family lives in just down the block
Many times I passed there but I never stopped
I go on all alone a wishin' I could be
In that house down the block with my family.

When we meet upon the street I just bow my head
They don't know how often I wish that I was dead
To our name I brought the shame but still I long to be
In that house down the block with my family.

[Instrumental]

When Gabriel blows his trumpet and time will be no more
When mem'ries fade, my daddy's faith I'll walk up to the door
The tears that fall won't start at all and God will let me be
In that house down the block with my family...
