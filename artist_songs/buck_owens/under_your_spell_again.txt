[Chorus:]
You've got me under your spell, again,
Sayin' those things, again
Makin' me believe that you're just mine.
You've got me dreamin' those dreams, again
Makin' those things, again,
I've gotta take you back just one more time

I swore the last time that you let me down
That I wouldn't see you if you came around,
But I can't tell my heart what's right or wrong
And I've been so lonely since you've been gone

[Chorus:]
You've got me under your spell, again,
Sayin' those things, again
Makin' me believe that you're just mine.
You've got me dreamin' those dreams, again
Makin' those things, again,
I've gotta take you back just one more time

[Instrumental]

Well, everybody tells me that I'm a fool
That, I never should have put my faith in you
And way down deep inside I guess I know it's true
But no one else can make me feel the way you do.

[Chorus:]
You've got me under your spell, again,
Sayin' those things, again
Makin' me believe that you're just mine.
You've got me dreamin' those dreams, again
Makin' those things, again,
I've gotta take you back just one more time...
