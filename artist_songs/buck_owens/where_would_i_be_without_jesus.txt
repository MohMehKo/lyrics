When my burdens get heavy
I just kneel down and pray
I ask God to work 'em out
Not mine, but his own way.

Safe in his arms, what a relief
For without Jesus where would I be?

Where would I be without Jesus
Where would I spend eternity
Lost in the world full of sorrow
Without Jesus where would I be?

[Instrumental]

In Chapter 14 of John verse 2 and 3
He says he's preparing a place for you and me
With him on my side that's all I'll ever need
Oh, without Jesus where would I be?

Where would I be without Jesus
Where would I spend eternity
Lost in the world full of sorrow
Without Jesus where would I be?...
