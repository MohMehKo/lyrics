My house of mem'ries is all that I own
I live in mis'ry now that you're gone
A constant reminder of what used to be
Is torturing me in my house of mem'ries.

My house is a prison where mem'ries surround me
There's no place to hide me for your mem'ry can't find me
My house of mem'ries is all that I own
I live in mis'ry now that you're gone.

My house is a prison where mem'ries surround me
There's no place to hide me for your mem'ry can't find me
My house of mem'ries is all that I own
I live in mis'ry now that you're gone.

I'm all alone in my house of mem'ries...
