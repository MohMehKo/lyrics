We were made for each other
I'm for you (you're for me)
There will never be another
I'll be yours eternally.

For as long as the world turns
And the leaves of autumn fall
Long as there's a star in heaven
I'll be waitin' for your call.

We were made for each other
I'm for you (you're for me)
There will never be another
I'll be yours eternally.

[Instrumental]

(For as long as the wind blows
Long as summer follows spring
Long as winter brings the snowflakes
I will love you constantly.)

We were made for each other
I'm for you (you're for me)
There will never be another
I'll be yours eternally...

No there will never be another
I'll be yours eternally...
