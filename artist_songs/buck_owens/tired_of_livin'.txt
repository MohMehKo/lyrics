Well, I'm tired of livin' and I'm scared of dyin'
I can't get ahead and there's no use a tryin'
Things would better change and I ain't a lyin'
Somethin' better happen pretty soon.

Yeah, the people workin' around and everyday
Are gettin' promotion and raisin' pay
But I keep a workin' the same old way
And somethin' better happen pretty soon.

Yeah, the man next door owns a forty room shack
Rides around ever day in a big Cadillac
But I'm still walkin' that's a fact
Seems somethin' better happen pretty soon.

Well, I'm tired of livin' and I'm scared of dyin'
I can't get ahead and there's no use a tryin'
Things would better change and I ain't a lyin'
Somethin' better happen pretty soon.

[Instrumental]

Well, everybody's got a girl to call his own
But I keep on a livin' all alone
Like a king without a throne
Somethin' better happen pretty soon.

Well, my brother Bill, he's a never broke
He has worked so slick and that ain't no joke
If things don't change I'm afraid I'll croak
Somethin' better happen pretty soon.

Yeah, I'm tired of livin' and I'm scared of dyin'
I can't get ahead and there's no use a tryin'
Things would better change and I ain't a lyin'
Somethin' better happen pretty soon...
