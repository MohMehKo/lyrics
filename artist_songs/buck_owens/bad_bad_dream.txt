Somehow I'm not gettin' through to you
For you don't treat me like you used to do
I see a far away look in your eyes
And I'm afraid that we're saying goodbye.

I had a bad bad dream last night
I dreamed that someone else was holding you tight
Another's arms were holdin' you
Another's lips were kissin' you
I had a bad bad dream last night.

[Instrumental]

Oh, I don't hardly know you anymore
For you don't act the same as before
Hold me close and whisper I love you
And that my bad bad dream won't come true.

I had a bad bad dream last night
I dreamed that someone else was holding you tight
Another's arms were holdin' you
Another's lips were kissin' you
I had a bad bad dream last night...
