Well, I betcha didn't know
I betcha didn't know that I was gonna love you so
I betcha didn't know
I betcha didn't know I ain't never gonna let you go.

Well, I can tell by that look in your eyes
That there's somethin' you're wantin' to say
You done found somebody new
And now you wanna go away.

Well, I betcha didn't know
I betcha didn't know that I was gonna love you so
I betcha didn't know
I betcha didn't know I ain't never gonna let you go.

[Instrumental]

Well, I ain't a been hanging around for my health
'Cause you're rough on a good man's heart
And you better postpone all of your pains
'Cause we ain't never gonna part.

Well, I betcha didn't know
I betcha didn't know that I was gonna love you so
I betcha didn't know
I betcha didn't know I ain't never gonna let you go.

[Instrumental]

Well, there ain't no use in you a squirmin' around
And lookin' at me that a way
For I ain't never gonna let you go
And I really mean what I say.

Well, I betcha didn't know
I betcha didn't know that I was gonna love you so
I betcha didn't know
I betcha didn't know I ain't never gonna let you go.

No, I ain't never gonna let you go...
