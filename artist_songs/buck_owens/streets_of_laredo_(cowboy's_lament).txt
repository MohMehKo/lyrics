As I walked out in the streets of Laredo
As I walked out in Laredo one day
I spied a young cowboy all wrapped in white linen
Wrapped in white linen as cold as the clay

So, beat the drum slowly, play the fife lowly
Play the death march as they carry me on
Take me to green valley, lay the sod o'er
I'm shot in the chest and I'm dying today

Let sixteen gamblers carry my coffin
Let sixteen cowbows sing me a song
Take me to green valley, lay the sod o'er
For I'm a young cowboy and I know I've done wrong

So, beat the drum slowly, play the fife lowly
Play the death march as they carry me on
Take me to green valley, lay the sod o'er
I'm shot in the chest and I'm dying today...
