When a man loves a woman
The way that I love you
He's just asking for trouble
For a one way love won't never do

He can't see the forest for the trees
He can't hear the wind blow for the breeze
He can't see the rainbow for the blue
When a man loves a woman
The way that I love you.

When a man loves a woman
The way that I love you
He's just asking for trouble
For a one way love won't never do
