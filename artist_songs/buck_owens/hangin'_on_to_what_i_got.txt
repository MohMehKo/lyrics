Well, everybody got something on their mind
That they like to talk about
Well, I got something that I'm proud of
And it's a worth shoutin' about.

Oh well, I don't want a string of big fine cars
And I don't want no fancy yacht
Well, I'm a tellin' you that I'm a happy man
And I'm a hangin' on to what I got.

I got a girl with two brown eyes
And arms to hold me tight
And I don't care if the sun don't shine
And daylight turns to night.

Well, if a dollar bill is not worth a dime
And if the whole world goes to pot
Well, I'm a tellin' you that I'm a happy man
And I'm a hangin' on to what I got.

[Instrumental]

Well, I'll not worry about the world
And what it's a comin' to
Or if old Lady Jones has got a new hat
Or if the brown had turned to blue.

Well, if the London Bridge is a fallen down
Or if old Big Ben has stopped
Well, I'm a tellin' you that I'm a happy man
And I'm a hangin' on to what I got.

I got a girl with two brown eyes
And arms to hold me tight
And I don't care if the sun don't shine
And daylight turns to night.

Well, if a dollar bill is not worth a dime
And if the whole world goes to pot
Well, I'm a tellin' you that I'm a happy man
And I'm a hangin' on to what I got.

Well, I'm a tellin' you that I'm a happy man
And I'm a hangin' on to what I got...
