If the windows need washin'
If the grass needs mowin'
If the paint on the shutters is gone
If the kitchen sink is leakin'
If the backdoor's a squeakin'
You've left her lonely too long.

You've left her lonely too long too long
Too many nights you left her all alone
So if you started hurtin' then there's one thing for certain
You've left her lonely too long.

[Instrumental]

If there's no curtains on the windows
No clothes in the closet
If the clock on the mantel run down
If the floor you've started walkin'
And if the neighbors have started talkin'
You've left her lonely too long.

You've left her lonely too long too long
Too many nights you left her all alone
So if you started hurtin' then there's one thing for certain
You've left her lonely too long.

You've left her lonely too long...
