Oh, let's stop kickin' each others hearts around
It's not the thing to do
Let's pick them up dust them off
And start our love anew.

Let's be fair and let's don't dare
To try to hurt the other
Let's stop kickin' our hearts around
And let's love one another.

We've said goodbye a thousand times
Then made up again
Always coming back for more
To see which one will win.

I love you and you love me
On this we can agree
Let's stop kickin' our hearts around
And go on lovingly.

Oh let's stop kickin' each others hearts around
It's not the thing to do
Let's pick them up dust them off
And start our love anew.

[Instrumental]

You called me on the phone
But I hung up on you
Then I called back up to apologize
For doing things I do.

You can't understand the things I do
Or things I say
And I can't accept the way you change
From day to day.

Oh let's stop kickin' each others hearts around
It's not the thing to do
Let's pick them up dust them off
And start our love anew...
