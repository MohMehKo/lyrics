Santa looked like daddy
Or daddy looked like him
It's not the way I had him pictured
Santa was a much too thin

He didn't come down the chimney
So momma must have let him in
Santa looked a lot like daddy
Or daddy looked a lot like him

Well, they thought I was fast a sleepin'
They thought I was tucked in bed
They never thought I'd come a peepin'
Or that I'd hear what was said

Santa put his arm around mama
And mama put her arm around him
So if Santa Claus ain't daddy,
Then I'm a gonna tell on them

Well, Santa looked like daddy
Or daddy looked like him
It's not the way I had him pictured
Santa was a much too thin

He didn't come down the chimney
So momma must have let him in
Santa looked a lot like daddy
Or daddy looked a lot like him

[Instrumental]

I never saw Dancer or Prancer
I never heard the sleigh bells ring
I never saw the Red Nosed reindeer
Like they show on the TV screen

But he sure brought a lot of presents
So Santa Claus he must have been
Well, he sure looked a lot like Daddy
And daddy looked a lot like him

Well, Santa looked like daddy
Or daddy looked like him
It's not the way I had him pictured
Santa was a much too thin

He didn't come down the chimney
So momma must have let him in
Santa looked a lot like daddy
Or daddy looked a lot like him...
