A man can be happy without money
But he must have some love in his life
I've lost you and now I'm so lonely
Lonely, 'cause no love have I.

I'd trade my life for a beggar
If he had someone close by his side
Sometimes I can't keep from crying
Crying 'cause no love have I.

[Instrumental]

I know that I must keep on living
But it's so hard to hold my hand high
My wordly possessions mean nothing
Nothing 'cause no love have I.

I hope you'll be happy in your world
I've wondered since we've said goodbye
I've prayed that you'll always have someone
And never say no love have I...
