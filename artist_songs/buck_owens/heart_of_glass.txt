Oh, heart of glass
I keep mending you
Every time
She breaks you in two.

How many more
Heartaches now
Must she put us through
Until she stops breaking you.

[Instrumental]

Oh, heart of glass
I hear she's back in town
I know it won't be long
Until she'll be around.

Picking up again
The pieces of the past
Oh, tell her no
Walk away heart of glass

Don't let her break you again
Heart of glass...
