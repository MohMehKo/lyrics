Wham bam, thank you ma'm, I'll be on my way
Thank you but no thank you, not today
First thing is matrimony next thing is alimony
Wham bam, thank you ma'm, I'll be on my way.

I'm just too young to get married you see
There's too many places that I'd rather be
There's a lotta other fishes in the deep blue sea
So wham bam, thank you ma'm, that's not for me.

Wham bam, thank you ma'm, I'll be on my way
Thank you but no thank you, not today
First thing is matrimony next thing is alimony
Wham bam, thank you ma'm, I'll be on my way.

[Instrumental]

I'm not the kinda guy to buy a ring
I'm afraid of weddin' bells and rice and things
I'm just too restless I'll never settle down
So wham bam, thank you ma'm, I'll see you around.

Wham bam, thank you ma'm, I'll be on my way
Thank you but no thank you, not today
First thing is matrimony next thing is alimony
Wham bam, thank you ma'm, I'll be on my way...
