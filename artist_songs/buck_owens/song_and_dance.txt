Song and dance, song and dance
You're gettin' tired of your new romance
You're back now beggin' for another chance
Singin' that same old song and dance.

Well, you bought a ticket and you caught a train
You waved at me through the window pane
But you'll be back and it won't be long
And you'll be singin' that same old song.

Song and dance, song and dance
You're gettin' tired of your new romance
You're back now beggin' for another chance
Singin' that same old song and dance.

[Instrumental]

Well, you said you's gonna make you some brand new plans
And that you's gonna find you a brand new man
That's the same ol' song that I've heard before
And that's the same ol' dance on the same ol' floor.

Song and dance, song and dance
You're gettin' tired of your new romance
You're back now beggin' for another chance
Singin' that same old song and dance.

You're back now beggin' for another chance
Singin' that same old song and dance...
