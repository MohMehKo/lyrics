Every night I go out somebody asks me
Whatever happened to you
I just say that I haven't seen you lately
And then I say my friend I thought you knew.

That we split the blanket down the middle
'Cause we could never get along
We split the blanket down the middle
That's all you can do when love is gone.

[Instrumental]

Well, I tell 'em that we tried and tried to make it
But we couldn't solve what was the use
To hang on to love it's only mis'ry
Ao now I'm fancy free and foot loose.

Yes, we split the blanket down the middle
'Cause we could never get along
We split the blanket down the middle
That's all you can do when love is gone...
