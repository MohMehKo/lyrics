When the road is rocky and heavy is your load
When the sky is cloudy and the sunshine's gone
When your life is troubled and nothing's going right
Bring it to Jesus he'll show you the light.

Well, bring it to Jesus and he'll show you the way
Bring it to Jesus and he'll brighten your day
When your life is troubled and you can't sleep at night
Bring it to Jesus and he'll show you the light.

[Instrumental]

Well, Jesus is the Saviour the light of the world
The only way to heaven so we read in his word
Tell him all your troubles and let him make 'em right
Bring it to Jesus and he'll show you the light.

And he'll show you the way
Bring it to Jesus and he'll brighten your day
When your life is troubled and you can't sleep at night
Bring it to Jesus and he'll show you the light...
