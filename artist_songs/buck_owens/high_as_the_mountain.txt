They say that too much water has run under the bridge
That we never can live down the past
That once your love has ended it never can return
But that's not so, for we both know, that our love will last.

High as the mountain
Deep as the sea
Tall as the tallest, tallest tree
That's how much I love you
That's how much you love me
High as the mountains
Deep as the sea.

[Instrumental]

It might be they're just jealous and don't want to understand
That our love will pass the test with room to spare
But it's just their conscience talkin' of their broken dreams and plans
For it shows and we both know that our love is fair.

High as the mountain
Deep as the sea
Tall as the tallest, tallest tree
That's how much I love you
That's how much you love me
High as the mountains
Deep as the sea...
