I stopped at a roadhouse in Texas,
It was a little place called Hamburger Dan's
And I heard that old jukebox a-playin',
A song about a truck drivin' man

Pour me another cup of coffee,
For it is the best in the land
I'll put a nickel in the jukebox,
And play The Truck Drivin' Man

The waitress just brought me some coffee
I thanked her but called her again
I said, "That ol' song sure does fit me
'Cause I am a truck drivin' man"

Pour me another cup of coffee,
For it is the best in the land
I'll put a nickel in the jukebox,
And play The Truck Drivin' Man

I climbed back on board my old semi
And then like a flash I was gone
I got them ol' truck wheels a-rollin
I'm on my way to San Antone

Pour me another cup of coffee,
For it is the best in the land
I'll put a nickel in the jukebox,
And play The Truck Drivin' Man
And play The Truck Drivin' Man
