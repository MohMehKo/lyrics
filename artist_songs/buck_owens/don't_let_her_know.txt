Lips, make a smile on my face
Eyes don't let her see you shed a tear
Heart don't let her hear you skip a beat
And pride don't let her know how much I care
Don't let her know
Don't let her know how much I care

[Instrumental]

Laugh, dance and sing so she won't notice
The hurt that's still burning deep inside
And don't let her see the way I tremble
Don't let her know how much I cry.
Don't let her know
Don't let her know how much I cry...
