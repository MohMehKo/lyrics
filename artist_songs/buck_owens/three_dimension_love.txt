It's deeper than the ocean higher than the sky
Longer than the highways that we travel by
Truer than the stars that shine in the sky
My three dimension love for you will never die

It's sweeter than the flowers that bloom in the spring
Prettier than water in a mountain in stream
Brighter than the sun that shines on high
My three dimension love for you will never die

If you would listen to the reason you would know I ain't a teasing
You'll what I say is true
You'll know I'm not a faking when I say my heart is breaking
The love I have for you
