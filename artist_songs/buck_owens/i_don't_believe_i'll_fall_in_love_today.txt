I don't believe I'll fall in love today
For if I did I know I wouldn't stay
I just can't make my heart find someone new
It's always much too busy lovin' you

[Chorus:]
Each night I pray I'll wake at dawn and find
Another in my heart and on my mind
Then I'll awake and hear my poor heart say
That I don't believe I'll fall in love today

[Instrumental]

I don't believe I'll fall in love today
Old memories of you stand in the way
You come between us like you always do
Somehow they never measure up to you

[Chorus:]
Each night I pray I'll wake at dawn and find
Another in my heart and on my mind
Then I awake and hear my poor heart say
That I don't believe I'll fall in love today...
