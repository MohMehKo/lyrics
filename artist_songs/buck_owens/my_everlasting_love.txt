It's deeper than the ocean and higher than the sky
Longer than the highways that we travel by
Truer than the stars that shine in the sky
My everlastin' love for you will never die.

Well, it's sweeter than the flowers that bloom in the spring
Prettier than water in a mountain stream
Brighter than the sun that shines on high
My everlastin' love for you will never die.

If you would listen to the reason
You would know I'm not a teasin'
You'll know what I say is true.
You'll know I'm not a fakin'
When I say my heart's a breakin'
With love I have for you.

Well, It's deeper than the ocean and higher than the sky
Longer than the highways that we travel by
Truer than the stars that shine in the sky
My everlastin' love for you will never die.

[Instrumental]

If you would listen to the reason
You would know I'm not a teasin'
You'll know what I say is true.
You'll know I'm not a fakin'
When I say my heart's a breakin'
With love I have for you.

Well, It's deeper than the ocean and higher than the sky
Longer than the highways that we travel by
Truer than the stars that shine in the sky
My everlastin' love for you will never die...
