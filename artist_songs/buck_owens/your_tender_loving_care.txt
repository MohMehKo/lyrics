I don't need the ship that sail to ocean
I don't need fancy clothes to wear
I just need your sweet sweet lips to kiss me
I just need your tender loving care.

Winter needs the north wind and the snowflakes
Springtime needs the flowers soft and rare
I just need to feel your arms around me
I just need your tender loving care.

[Instrumental]

Day goes by so slow when you're not with me
Nights are long and oh so, hard to bare
Everything is nothing dear without you
And I'm nothing without your tender loving care.

I just need your tender loving care...
