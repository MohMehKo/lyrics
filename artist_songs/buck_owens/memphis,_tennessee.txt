Long distance information, give me Memphis, Tennessee
Help me find the party, try to get in touch with me
She could not leave her number, but I know who placed the call
'Cause my uncle took the message, and he wrote it on the wall

Help me, operator, get in touch with my Marie
She's the only one who'd call me here from Memphis, Tennessee
Her home is on the southside, high up on a ridge
Just a half a mile from the Mississippi Bridge

The last time I saw Marie, she was a waving me goodbye
With hurry home drops on her cheeks that trickled from her eyes
We were torn apart because her mom would not agree
And tore apart our happy home in Memphis, Tennessee

Help me, operator, more than this I cannot add
Only that I miss her so and all the fun we had
Marie is only six years old, information, please
Help to put me through to her in Memphis, Tennessee
