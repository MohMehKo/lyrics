The first time you hurt me
I thought I'd die
The second time it happened
I cried all night.

They say a heart can stand
Just so much grief and pain
But a fool in love keeps loving
They never change.

There's no fool like an old fool
That's loved and lost at least a hundred times
There's no fool like an old fool
That keeps on falling for the same old line.

[Instrumental]

You call and say you're sorry
That you let me down
I take you back
'Xause you're what makes my world go round.

And though I know my chances
Are so very small
I'd rather have a part of you
Than none at all.

There's no fool like an old fool
That's loved and lost at least a hundred times
There's no fool like an old fool
That keeps on falling for the same old line...
