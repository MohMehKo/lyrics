Someday, someway, somewhere you will see
Jesus will call for you and for me
And we'll all be together as our new life begins
When Jesus calls all his children in.

When Jesus calls all his children in
When the trumpet sounds that's when we will walk in
Yes we'll walk the streets of Glory with Jesus hand in hand
When Jesus calls all his children in.

[Instrumental]

Someday those pearly gates will swing wide
For all of God's children to walk inside
What a wonderful feeling that will be then
When Jesus calls all his children in.

When Jesus calls all his children in
When the trumpet sounds that's when we will walk in
Yes we'll walk the streets of Glory with Jesus hand in hand
When Jesus calls all his children in...
