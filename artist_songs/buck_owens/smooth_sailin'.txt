There's a gonna be smooth sailin' from now on
'Cause my cheatin' baby's gone.
Diamond rings, I can't afford
So I threw her overboard
Smooth sailin' from now on.

Well, I've satisfied my hanker
And I've got somebody new
When I could loose my anchor
I saw the last of you

There's a gonna be smooth sailin' from now on
'Cause my cheatin' baby's gone
Maybe I'll have peace of mind
'Cause I know just what I'll find
Smooth sailin' from now on.

[Instrumental]

I've got me a new baby all my own
And I'll never sail my ship alone
From her head to her feet
She's got all those others beat
Smooth sailin' from now on.

I'll be the skipper
And we'll have a little crew
She and I and kisses
And Oh yes, Mr. Moon.

There's a gonna be smooth sailin' from now on
'Cause my cheatin' baby's gone
Maybe I'll have peace of mind
'Cause I know just what I'll find
Smooth sailin' from now on...
