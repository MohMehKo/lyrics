Only you and you alone can take this lonely from my heart
And put a happy feeling there and make it grow
Only you and you alone can kiss my lips and hold me close
And whisper in my ear you'll always love me so.

For it's you and you alone
That lets me live and breathe and smile
And walk the highway to the stars that's in your eyes
If you'll let me I will love you more than life itself
And keep you If you'll only say forever you'll be mine
Only you and you alone only you and you alone.

[Instrumental]

Only you can make the stars come out to sunshine golden yellow
And keep birds a singing songs of love's delight
Only you can take my heart and make it burst with love and tenderness
And filled with love and laughter every night.

Only you and you alone can let me tell the world
That you're my girl and keep all other lovers from your life
Only you and you alone can let me feel that life's worth living
If you'll only say forever you'll be mine
Only you and you alone only you and you alone...
