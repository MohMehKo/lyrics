She's out there somewhere
I don't really care
I'm proud to say that we had
Just a casual affair.

We drifted together
Then drifted apart
And I crossed her name
From my heart.

But, I'm lying again, yes, lying again
One kiss from her could start me crying again
If you could see behind this game of pretend
You'd see my heart crying, I'd be lying again.

[Instrumental]

If she ever phones
Please say that I am not home
Just tell her I'm busy
And to leave me alone

I hope she's happy
For I plan to be
A she's
Just a memory to me

But, I'm lying again, yes, lying again
One kiss from her could start me crying again
If you could see behind this game of pretend
You'd see my heart crying, I'd be lying again...
