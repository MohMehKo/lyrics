Once my heart was heavy
I was living in sin
But then I found Jesus
And he took me in.

And he saved me, saved me
And from sin set me free
Yes, he saved me 'cause he loved me
Yes, Jesus saved me.

Once I thought I'd never find
Peace of mind
But I gave my heart to Jesus
And he saved this soul of mine.

And he saved me, saved me
And from sin set me free
Yes, he saved me 'cause he loved me
Yes, Jesus saved me.

[Instrumental]

So if your heart is burdened
I'll tell you what to do
Just put your trust in Jesus
And he'll save you too.

And he saved me, saved me
And from sin set me free
Yes, he saved me 'cause he loved me
Yes, Jesus saved me...
