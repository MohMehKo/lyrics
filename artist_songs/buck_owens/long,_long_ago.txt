Since you and I parted in silence and tears
So broken hearted we've suffered for years
Your cheek was pale and your hand was so cold
I remember you saying as you turned to go.

That I'd cry in my sleep and your name I would call
Your face I would see every night on my wall
That I'd waken in the morning in tears to recall
You're tellin' me darling so long, long ago.

[Instrumental]

If we should meet after long, lonely years
If I should greet you with silence and tears
But if I'd reach to touch you, oh, so you will know
I remember you're tellin' me long, long ago.

That I'd cry in my sleep and your name I would call
Your face I would see every night on my wall
That I'd waken in the morning in tears to recall
You're tellin' me darling so long, long ago.

I remember you darling from long, long ago...
