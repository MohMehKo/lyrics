If you see me walking round in circles
If you see me staring at the sky
If you think I still miss you since you left me
Congratulations, you're absolutely right.

If you think life's been empty since you left me
If you think that I cry for you at night
If you think I take you back in a minute
Congratulations, you're absolutely right.

[Instrumental]

If you think that I try to call your number
If you think I drive by your house at night
If you think I still love you like I used to
Congratulations, you're absolutely right.

If you think life's been empty since you left me
If you think that I cry for you at night
If you think I take you back in a minute
Congratulations, you're absolutely right...
