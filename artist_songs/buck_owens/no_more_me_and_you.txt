No more floors to walk
No more walls to talk
No more dreams to dream
No more schemes to scheme.

No more happiness,
Only loneliness
No more skies of blue
No more me and you.

[Instrumental]

No more lips to kiss
No more arms to miss
No more jealous fights
Only sleepless nights.

No more friends to face
Love's gone without a trace
No more skies of blue
No more me and you...
