If you don't want to run around
If you will really settle down
I'll take a chance on loving you.
If you will be my very own
If you'll be mine and mine alone
I'll take a chance on loving you.

Well, there's lots of pretty girls
In this wide wide world
But none I've seen can hold a light to you.
You're the cutest the sweetest
The nices the neatest
And I'll tell you what I'm a gonna do.

If you don't want to run around
If you will really settle down
I'll take a chance on loving you.
If you will be my very own
If you'll be mine and mine alone
I'll take a chance on loving you.

[Instrumental]

Well, did you really mean it
Or did I just dream it
When you said I was the one for you.
Now, don't make me regret it
Too late to forget it
The day that I fell on love with you.

If you don't want to run around
If you will really settle down
I'll take a chance on loving you.
If you will be my very own
If you'll be mine and mine alone
I'll take a chance on loving you...
