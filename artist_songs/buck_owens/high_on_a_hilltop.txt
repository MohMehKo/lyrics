High on a hilltop overlooking a city
I watched the bright lights as they gleam
For somewhere you're dancing in some dingy bar room
And the lure of the gay life takes the place of our dream

High on a hilltop my heart cries, Oh Lord
Forgive her she knows not the way
And give me the power to believe and some day
High on a hilltop together we'll pray

[Instrumental]

I can vision a rounder with a line so smooth
With a promise of riches for you
But you see not the danger for you're silly with booze
And from high on a hilltop I see the devil in you

High on a hilltop my heart cries, Oh Lord
Forgive her she knows not the way
Just give me the power to believe and some day
High on a hilltop together we'll pray...
