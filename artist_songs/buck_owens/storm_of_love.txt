There's a storm of love a brewin'
Now, I'm a losin' you and nothin' that I do can make you stay
When you love me too my skies were always blue
But now the storm of love is on its way.

Everybody thought that we were perfect you and me
That we'd always be together for eternity
But the forecast wasn't quite the way it seemed to be
And the cloudy sky is all that I can see.

There's a storm of love a brewin'
Now, I'm a losin' you and nothin' that I do can make you stay
When you love me too my skies were always blue
But now the storm of love is on its way.

[Instrumental]

Like a leaf in the wind, what's my destiny
Without you I see only misery
Yesterday the weather changed now you grow cold to me
Now a cloudy sky is all that I can see.

There's a storm of love a brewin'
Now, I'm a losin' you and nothin' that I do can make you stay
When you love me too my skies were always blue
But now the storm of love is on its way...
