I don't want to be a movie star with riches and things
And I don't even care if anybody knows my name
I don't want to be the president, he's got too much to do
Well, I just want someone to love and that someone is you.

So darlin' put your arms around me
And let your charms surround me
And tell me that you love me
'Cause I want no one but you.

[Instrumental]

I don't want a Cleopatra, she might cheat on me
She had too many boy friends back in history
I don't want to be a millionaire, to sail the ocean blue
I just want someone to love and that someone is you.

So darlin' put your arms around me
And let your charms surround me
And tell me that you love me
'Cause I want no one but you.

Oh no, I want no one but you...
