Oh, you told me you had found another
That I no longer fit into your plans
Don't apologize I said, for it don't matter
But you know what a liar I am.

With a smile on my face I wished you well, dear
With the happiness at last you say you've found
But if you knew how I've tossed and I've tumbled
Then you'd know what a liar I am.

[Instrumental]

I watched you walk away with your new love
Watched my dream world tumble to the ground
I told all of our friends I'm glad it's over
But they know what a liar I am.

With a smile on my face I wished you well, dear
With the happiness at last you say you've found
But if you knew how I've tossed and I've tumbled
Then you'd know what a liar I am.

Now you know what a liar I am...
