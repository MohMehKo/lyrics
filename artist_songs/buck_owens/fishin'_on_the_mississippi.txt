Well, I'm fishin' in the middle of the Mississippi River
And the water's too muddy to drink
Big catfish bitin' on the little pole
And my baby's waitin' on the bank

Well, you tried to make a livin' on the Mississippi River
It's a mighty hard life to live
But I'm gonna build a house for my pretty little baby
And I'm gonna build it on the hill.

Well, maybe if I'm lucky I'll catch a catfish
And I'll sell 'em for a dollar bill
Then I'm gonna buy another board and a pocketful of nails
For my little house on the hill.

Well, I'm fishin' in the middle of the Mississippi River
And the water's too muddy to drink
Big catfish bitin' on the little pole
And my baby's waitin' on the bank

My pappy told me there's sure gonna be
A lotta hard times a comin' around
But I'd rather go a fishin' on the Mississippi River
Than livin' in a cold, cold ground.

Well, I can't make whiskey like all the others
Oh, my baby would set me free
I have to go runnin' down Mississippi River
When the law come callin' on me.

Well, I'm fishin' in the middle of the Mississippi River
And the water's too muddy to drink
Big catfish bitin' on the little pole
And my baby's waitin' on the bank.

Well, I'm fishin' in the middle of the Mississippi River
And the water's too muddy to drink
Big catfish bitin' on the little pole
And my baby's waitin' on the bank
