Fe fe fi fi fo fo fum
I smell smoke in the auditorium

Charlie Brown, Charlie Brown,
He's a clown that Charlie Brown
He's gonna get caught
Just you wait and see
(Why's everybody always pickin' on me?)

That's him on his knees
I know that's him
Yelling seven come eleven
Down in the boys gym.

Charlie Brown, Charlie Brown,
He's a clown that Charlie Brown
He's gonna get caught
Just you wait and see
(Why's everybody always pickin' on me?)

Who's always writin' on the wall
Who's always goofin' in the hall
Who's always throwin' spit balls
Yeah, who (who me) yeah, you

Walked in the classroom cool and slow
Who called the English teacher Daddy-o

Charlie Brown, Charlie Brown,
He's a clown that Charlie Brown
He's gonna get caught
Just you wait and see
(Why's everybody always pickin' on me?)

[Instrumental]

Who's always writin' on the wall
Who's always goofin' in the hall
Who's always throwin' spit balls
Yeah, who (who me) yeah, you

Walked in the classroom cool and slow
Who called the English teacher Daddy-o

Charlie Brown, Charlie Brown,
He's a clown that Charlie Brown
He's gonna get caught
Just you wait and see
(Why's everybody always pickin' on me?)..
