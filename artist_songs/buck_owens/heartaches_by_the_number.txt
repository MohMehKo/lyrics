Heartache numbers one
Was when you left me
I never knew that I could hurt this way
And heartache number two was when
You come back again
You came back but never meant to stay

[Chorus:]
Now I've got heartaches by the number,
Troubles by the score
Ev'ryday you love me less,
Each day I love you more
Yes, I've got heartaches by the number,
A love that I can't win
But the day that I stop counting,
That's the day my world will end

[Instrumental]

Heartache number three
Was when you called me
And said that you were coming
Back to stay
With hopeful heart I waited for
Your knock on the door
I waited but you
Must have lost your way

[Chorus:]
Now I've got heartaches by the number,
Troubles by the score
Ev'ryday you love me less,
Each day I love you more
Yes, I've got heartaches by the number,
A love that I can't win
But the day that I stop counting,
That's the day my world will end...
