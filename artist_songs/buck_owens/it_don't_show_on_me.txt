You can't know the feelin' inside me that is stealin'
You can't know cause it don't show on me
You can't hear me sighin' or see my heart a cryin'
You can't know cause it don't show on me
Abuse doneuse refuse missuse that I got from you
But you can't know the feelin' cause it just don't show on me

You can't know the heartbreak and you can't feel the heartache
You can't know cause it don't show on me
You can't know I'm lonely and longing for you only
You can't know cause it don't show on me
Abuse doneuse refuse...
