She got a special way
It makes me happy everyday
What do the old folks say
She's finer than frog hair split four ways

When I'm feelin' low
She reminds me that there's always tomorrow
I kinda wonder if she knows
My sun comes up just to hear her crowe

She don't just own me
She has grown me
In her secret garden deep in love's holler
Wherever she goes
I know she knows
That I will always follow
She's got me chain and collar
She owns the deed
She owns the dollar

We know we're a good match
That's why at our hips, we're attached
She's such a good catch
Got me grinning like a goat
At a briar patch

She makes me feel just like a king
I'm always happy for what each day brings
She never loses sight of the important things
But she's wild as a junebug on a string

She don't just own me
She has grown me
In her secret garden deep in love's holler
Wherever she goes
I know she knows
That I will always follow
She's got me chain and collar
She owns the deed
She owns the dollar

She don't just own me
She has grown me
In her secret garden deep in love's holler
Wherever she goes
Lord I know she knows
That I will always follow
She's got me chain and collar
She owns the deed
She owns the dollar

Oh, she owns the deed
She owns the dollar
