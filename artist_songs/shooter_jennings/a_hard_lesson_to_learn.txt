Well I heard jimmy rogers sing
On my daddy's old record machine
Something bout a when you got love
All you got is love to lose
And if I learned one thing about hank
Is that him and his kid like to drink
Living whiskey bent, feeling lovesick blues
Straight to hell
I'm a whiskey drinking, new low sinking
Love em and leave em kind

And if it's worth keeping, you better believe it
I'm loosing it with my mind
Anything I pick up from one of them songs
Just a new way not to get burnt
But it's the same old bottle
Same old blues
The same hard lesson to learn

Well I heard that old george jones
Bottomed out from all the no shows
Girl I'm watching my heroes run away like hall up pow
And a little like a rolling stone 
I ain't worth it if I gotta be alone
I'm a lost highway, the devil collects the tolls
I'm a whiskey drinking, new low sinking
Love and leaving kind

And if it's worth keeping, you better believe it
I'm loosing it with my mind
Anything I pick up from one of men song
Just a new way not to get burnt
But it's the same old bottle
Same old blues
The same hard lesson to learn

[solo]

Anything I pick up from one of men song
Just a new way not to get burnt
But it's the same old bottle
Same old blues
The same hard lesson to learn
It's the same old bottle
Same old blues
The same hard lesson to learn.
