When the radio goes dead
And the airways get filled with fear instead
They're gonna come for my head
And the things that I've said
When the radio goes dead
When the radio goes dead

When the censors have won
Last record has been spun
Last song has been sung
And my time is done
When the censors have won

I'll go when I'm ready
One minute there's static
The needle goes red
Is anyone out there?
Is anyone listening?
Will anyone remember what's been said?

The all-seeing eye
Each hour of each day comes with a price
And I'm still asking why
They've leveraged the sky
The surveillance in the name of security
And then the radio goes dead

Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye...
