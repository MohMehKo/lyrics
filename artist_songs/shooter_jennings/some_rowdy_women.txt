[Verse 1:]
Well the songs I make, they ain't for livin'
And the things I take, they ain't for givin'
I'd gladly trade all my big city livin'
For some rowdy women and a honky tonk tonight

Well my mistakes give me my reputation
But them old sad songs were my education
And when I drift back home, I start to missin'
Some rowdy women, to pacify my mind

[Chorus:]
Cause I have been high, I have been low
I've lost my mind, and I stole the show
I'd gladly trade all my big city livin'
For some rowdy women and a honky tonk tonight

[Verse 2:]
I nearly had one wife, she took to leavin'
Because of all my lies, she stopped believin'
and now I'm nine miles high, let me be forgivin'
For givin' some rowdy women, a little piece of my mind

[Chorus:]
Cause I have been high, I have been low
I've lost my mind, and I stole the show
I'd gladly trade all my big city livin'
For some rowdy women 
For some rowdy women and a honky tonk tonight
