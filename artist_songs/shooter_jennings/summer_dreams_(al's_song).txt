Summer dreams blow like leaves through these city streets
With the autumn they are gone
Busy people shuffling don't know where they're going
They just go till they hit a wall
Not me no no not me

I want to go where the air is clean
For awhile let the stream carry my pain
Waste away the days until it's time to ride away
Into the cold desert sunset and the warm mountain rain

Going to throw my damned old phone off the downtown bridge
Leave my briefcase on the train
Going to walk a mile right up this island
And go away before I go insane

You don't know but there's a lonesome cowboy
Underneath these cold city clothes
I have the mind to leave it all behind
And go where a high-rise won't grow
I wanna go

I want to go where the air is clean
For awhile let the stream carry my pain
Waste away the days until it's time to ride away
Into the cold desert sunset and the warm mountain rain

Summer dreams blow like leaves through these city streets
With the autumn they are gone
Busy people shuffling don't know where they're going
They just go till they hit a wall
