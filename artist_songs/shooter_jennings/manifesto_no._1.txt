Moved out of my apartment and you moved out of my old town
My life has remained so lonely since you ain't been around
And to think how far I traveled, honey, just to see you one more time
But if that's how you say hello well you can kiss my ass goodbye

So let your hair down, get out of that skirt
Oh but leave them high heels on
I'll be in the back on my black Cadillac
When Jesus finally comes to call His children home

So let your hair down, get out of that skirt
Oh but leave them high heels on
I'll be in the back on my black Cadillac
When Jesus finally comes to call His children home
Don't get up

Gonna climb a mountain when I get to the top I'll find a honky tonk
Where I'll sit and I'll drink wondering where you've gone
And to think how far I've traveled just to get your off my mind
But if that's how you say hello well you can kiss my ass goodbye

So let your hair down, get out of that skirt
Oh but leave them high heels on
I'll be in the back on my black Cadillac
When Jesus finally comes to call His children home

So let your hair down, get out of that skirt
Oh but leave them high heels on
I'll be in the back on my black Cadillac
When Jesus finally comes to call His children home
Oh yeah, I'll be in the back on my black Cadillac
When Jesus finally comes to call His children home
