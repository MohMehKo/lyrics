Every time I think I smell that sweet southern rain
it takes me to a station on the long black train
I wanna hear the wind blow, and feel the earth move below me
despite of all the good times, I gotta rest my soul

So I'm gone, yes I'm gone
gone to Carolina, where I know that I belong

Yes I'm gone, yes I'm gone
gone to Carolina, where I know I have a home

Every time I think I see your face in a crowd
it's like a bell inside of me, and it's ringin' out loud
I've been so high for so long, there's nothing tried nor true
I'm thinking bout coming down, to lay a little on you

And I'm gone, yes I'm gone
gone to Carolina, where I know that I belong

Yes I'm gone, yes I'm gone
gone to Carolina, where I know I have a home

Take me home

[solo]

Yes I'm gone, yes I'm gone
gone to Carolina, where I know that I belong

Yes I'm gone, yes I'm gone
gone to Carolina, where I know I have a home

Yea, come on
