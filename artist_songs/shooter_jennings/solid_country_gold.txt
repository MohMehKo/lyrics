Well I been sinking like a rock in this high society
'Cause all that means so much to them, don't mean shit to me
If I were in to money, fame and power, I'd be sold
But I know I tried, and I just can't find that solid country gold

But now I was born in Nashville but I left there long ago
'Cause they built music city by sacrificing soul
L.A. ain't much different, accept they got them fancy clothes
And there's nary a sight or a leaving light of solid country gold

'Cause they say country music ain't quite all it used to be
But they can't see the country for all the goddamned trees
If you give me to a guitar and my woman on the road
I'll give to you my family, my solid country gold alright

Now baby I been thinking 'bout where you and I should go
You sell your apartment, and I'll shake off my load
We'll take it down to Texas where we'll kiss that yellow rose
And find ourselves some loving in solid country gold

Well they say country music ain't quite all it used to be
But they can't see the country for all the goddamned trees
If you give me to a guitar and my woman on the road
I'll give to you my family, my solid country gold

Oh 'cause they say country music ain't quite all it used to be
They can't see the country for all the goddamned trees
And if you give me to a guitar and my woman on the road
I'll give to you my family, my solid country gold yeah
Yes, I'll give to you my family, my solid country gold, alright
