I found a letter just yesterday
And what it say, I can't disclose
I read that letter and every word that it say
And my heart, it just froze

Ain't it a shame? Ain't it a shame?
Ain't it a shame? Such a sad, sad shame
My baby's been runnin' around
All around this town, with another man

I packed her stuff up, put it on the front porch
When she gets home, she'll surely see
You know it was so hard goin' through our life together
Figurin' out what belongs to you and what belongs to me, yeah

Ain't it a shame? Ain't it a shame?
Ain't it a shame? Such a sad, sad shame
My baby's been runnin' around
All around this town, with another man

So many times I've forgiven her
So much time, I could never get it back
And I don't wanna know how long it's been goin' on
I just wanna leave this town and never look back

Ain't it a shame? Ain't it a shame?
Ain't it a shame? Such a sad, sad shame
My baby's been runnin' around
All around this town, with another man

Ooh, ain't it a shame?
