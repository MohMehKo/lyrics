If I go crazy
or if I pull through
its only a matter of time
till I loose my reason 
the way I lost you 
its only a matter of time

Frauline I miss climbing your vines
one taste of your fruit and I grow as high as the tall tall pines

And if I go crazy 
or if I pull through 
its only a matter of time 
till I loose my reason 
I've already lost you 
its only a matter of time

I'm fine honey 
I'm not loosing my mind
I'm just watching the bubbles as they sink and I fly 
become one with the blue sky

If I go crazy 
or if I pull through 
its only a matter of time
till I hit bottom
the bottle hits bottom too
its only a matter of time
