Well, my mama tried to keep me out of trouble
But the devil wouldn't have it that way
Oh boy, pray and stay humble
Were the last words that I heard her say

And tonight I'll be drivin', way past cryin'
It's last time that I let you down
If I hadn't broken her heart it wouldn't be so hard
To lay her into the cold, cold ground
It's the last time that I let you down

Well, my woman, she's all packed and she's leavin'
Said I crossed that line one too many times
Talk about drinkin' and ridin', hell raisin'
Lord, no, I gave her the ride

And tonight I'll be drivin', way past cryin'
It's last time that I let you down
If I hadn't broken her heart it wouldn't be so hard
To watch her, not turn her down
It's the last time that I let her down

And I pray that I stay out of trouble

Cause tonight I'll be drivin', way past cryin'
It's last time that I let you down
I'll be goin' under the den until this road ends
Maybe then I'll turn it around
It's the last time that I let you down

Yeah, it's the last time that I let you down
Oh, it's the last time that I let you down
