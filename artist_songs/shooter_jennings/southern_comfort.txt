Take me home

Well, I came to Cali on a highway from Nashville
It's all a gamble for the fortune and fame
My education came from reading the road signs
Just another fool who got lost in the game

And I'm going back again
'Cause it's blowing in the wind
That's carryin' me home

Oh, southern comfort
Don't leave me low
Oh, southern comfort
Keeps calling me home
Yeah

And all these actors, man, they're living in castles
And with the earthquakes they'll sink in the sea
Who makes a living off of heartbreaks and hassles?
And scientologists make no sense to me

So I'm going back again
'Cause it's blowing like the wind
That's carryin' me home

Oh, southern comfort
Don't leave me low
Oh, southern comfort
Keeps calling me home

Oh, southern comfort
Don't leave me low
Oh, southern comfort
Keeps calling me home

Oh, southern comfort
Don't leave me low
Oh, southern comfort
Keeps calling me home

Oh, southern comfort
Don't leave me low
Oh, southern comfort
Keeps calling me home

Oh, southern comfort
Don't leave me low
Oh, southern comfort
Keeps calling me home

C'mon take me home
