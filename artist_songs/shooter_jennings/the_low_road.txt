Ooh, when I was to school somebody was taking on me
Just be dirty play dirty and asking my knees
Let all the cowardice and according me
Took my sculpture out of rout, took all difficulties
My diary all is torment to the verse I just care to be 
It cares all the sensity, how I can make
The hallows it grows, the large is coming down
Sometimes you got to make it up, and take the low low road
Sometimes you got to make it up, and take the low low road
Be less the same upon the problems betweens
That have myself to love it two time chasin'
When she love I want to die, I didn't mean to live
The man walks and never assisted with all kinds of sweet
My loneliness is saved, so you got try hard
You'll find a woman that will love you, but the men that you loved
But the hallows it grows, the large is coming down
Sometimes you got to make up, and take the low low road
Sometimes you got to make it quick, and take the low low road
When I took myself to nature I didn't take me longer
We realize that helping, no play long
I mean look inside of mother, but my heart is my fault
I keep going in my rather to be alone
My diary all is torment to the verse I just care to be
All care the sensity, how I can make
The hallows it grows, the large is coming down
Sometimes you got to make up, and take the low low road
Sometimes you got to make it up, and take the low low road
Sometimes you got to make up, and take the low low road
Sometimes you change or never change, and take the low low road.
