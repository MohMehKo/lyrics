When I was just a young boy, 
my daddy came to me, said son 
Out in this world theres a lotta things 
that'll make you feel like your supposed 
to be. You don't have to read the good book, to be a good man just the same. 
And forget about the money, money ain't brought nothing to your daddy but pain. 
It ain't easy. 
It ain't eeaasyy... 
But you'll be alright 
Now it's 15 years later, and I'm out on the road, and it's been 4 years to day he died, and they won't even play us on the radio.
And I think I've found my way alright without him here to catch me now and again,
I just keep on moving along, keeping my mind on my song, and trying to figure out love. 
And it ain't easy. 
It ain't eeaasyy. 
But I'll be alright. 
Any other fool, any other fool would throw this away. 
Any other fool, yeah. 
I wanna take a minute to thank you, for all the things that you done,
yeah you gave me a light in the dark of night, when there was no place to hide, no where to run. 
And it ain't easy. 
It ain't eeaasyy... 
It ain't easy, it ain't easy. 
But you'll be alright. 
We'll be alright. 
It ain't eeeeaaaassssy...
