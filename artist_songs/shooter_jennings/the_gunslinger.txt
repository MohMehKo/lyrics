Stepped off of the train in this town 
may look kind of strange, kind of rough all around 
You don't know what I've been through 
But you'd better not stare better watch your mouth boy 
Don't be fool! No need to be scared, 
but you need to be aware you think you own this town, huh,
I don't care the emperors they bear,
I'm just looking for some brothers in arms
and the woman with the long dark hair.

But don't call me an outlaw no, 
I'm a motherfucking gunslinger 
You wanna run your mouth all day long 
You'd better keep your eye 
on my motherfucking trigger finger 
Do you feel me punk?
Do you feel me punk?
Do you feel me punk?
Do you feel me punk?

Some people think they know me 
Think they can predict me, 
Think they gotta dis me, 
When I'm not around and when I come darking the door, 
They get weak in the knees and crumble like a castle to the ground 
'Cause they know I ain't taking no shit 
I got a woman who left me, 
white with a heart of cold stone 
When they see the black in my eyes, 
they see a man so deep in the red that it chills them to the bone.

But don't call me an outlaw no, 
I'm a motherfucking gunslinger 
You wanna run your mouth all day long 
You'd better keep your eye 
on my motherfucking trigger finger 
Do you feel me punk?
Do you feel me punk?
Do you feel me punk?
Do you feel me punk?

I'm just cold as the day is long 
and I'm lost in a lonesome song 
so you best just move along
Gotta a right to be wrong 

Oh, don't call me an outlaw 
I'm a motherfucking gunslinger 
You wanna run your mouth all day long 
You'd better keep your eye 
on my motherfucking trigger finger 
Do you feel me punk?
Do you feel me punk?
Do you feel me punk?
Do you feel me punk?

I'm just cold as the day is long
and I'm lost in a lonesome song 
so you best just move along
Gotta a right to be wrong
