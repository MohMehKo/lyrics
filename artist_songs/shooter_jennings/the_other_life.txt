This life is a dream 
When I wake up I feel your face 
smiling over at me. 
And you tell me that you love me, 
And I light up when you touch me and this life 
is all that I need. 

But heaven was just illusion 
One hell a better conclusion 
To this life with you.

So I stay out late at night 
Tryin' to hock a room with my guitar 
And sing my "poor me's" at another lonesome bar 
Unrehearsed, diyin' of thirst 
and cursed with the other life. 

And sometimes I sit and look at old pictures 
and air another unanswered prayer 
But I won't look too long 'cause I'm just not that strong 
so I pretend for a moment you still care.

And like these pictures that life would frame 
There ain't a song that I would not trade
for one minute with you. 

So I stay out late at night 
Tryin' to hock a room with my guitar 
And sing my "poor me's" at another lonesome bar 
Unrehearsed, diyin' of thirst 
and cursed with the other life. 
Yeah the other life. 

So I stay out late at night 
Tryin' to hock a room with my guitar 
And sing my "poor me's" at another lonesome bar 
Unrehearsed, diyin' of thirst 
and cursed with the other life. 
Oh the other life
With the other life.
