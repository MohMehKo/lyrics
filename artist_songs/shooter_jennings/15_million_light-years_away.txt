Well we tried, and tried to get it right
Come close, a few times too
But lunatics run the asylum
And animals run the zoo
Criminals are heroes, police break the law
And philosophers are all finding out
They don't know nothing at all, no

[Chorus:]
One day we're gonna get ourselves together
Just when, I don't know, I can't say
It may be tomorrow, it could be today
Or 15 million light-years away
15 million light-years away

The man who makes the rules,
Throws a smile your way and he
Lies to you once again
When right is wrong, and wrong is right
The whole damn world is in a spin

[Chorus] 

The world ain't what it should be
Humanity ain't humane.
And the good lord give the free will
To make the same mistakes again
Well I've tried, I've tried to get it right
Come close, a few time too
With that in mind it seems very strange
There's one thing, maybe two
Lunatics run the asylum
And animals run the zoo....

[Chorus]
