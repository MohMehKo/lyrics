Mama can't you see what's my reality?
Somebody always gotta push me around. 

There ain't nothing that the teachers ever gonna teach me 
All just wanna break me down. 

If you can see what's inside of me 
You will understand well I got to be free.

Mama, its just my medicine 
Oh mama, its just my medicine. 

It's up on mine I can't be who I wanna be 
Oh I can't even fly with you best. 
All this wind, it won't hit me, 
my boss just wanna speak me 
Mama, can you hear my word?

In my room with my baby watch
I can [?] both chain nowhere touch. 

So mama, its just my medicine
Oh mama, its just my medicine.
Yeah yeah 
Oh mama, its just my medicine 
Oh mama, its just my medicine. 
Yeah yeah. 

Oh mama!

But don't close much, too heavenly far 
Can't you see mama I ain't hurting no one 

Mama, its just my medicine 
Oh mama, its just my medicine. 
Alright let's have a little fun!
When I say let's fly you say hell high, alright?
Oh let's give this thing a try let's fly, hell high
On earth all way to the sky, let's fly! hell high!
To the fallest depths of the mind let's fly! hell high!
Come through all space [?] let's fly! hell high!Hell high!
Hell high, hell high!

Mama, its just my medicine 
Yeah mama, its just my medicine.
Its just my medicine, my medicine, oh yeah 
Mama, its just my medicine 
Oh mama, its just my medicine.
