With a bag, a bottle and this old guitar 
In the back of some bus on the road 
I'm living the high life with nothing to show 
But a love that's letting me go 
Your heroes turn out to be assholes 
And the light in the tunnel that you're chasing is a train 
The singer's in key the guitars in tune 
But the song is still slipping away 
The lights of the city paint a stage in the night 
For two hearts breaking in time 
Wild horses are cursed with their freedom in mind 
And a hunger left burning inside
