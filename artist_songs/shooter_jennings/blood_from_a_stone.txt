There was a time when I would lie and say I needed you
'Cause I didn't have nowhere else to go
Yeah, you go your way, I'll go mine
We'll get together, have ourselves a good time
There ain't no use, tryin' to squeeze blood from a stone

Oh, I will go on without you
This ain't the first time I've been high and dry
If I should hold on I'll try to
I'm gonna have to fight but I will get by

The best friend I got said if you can wake up every day
And ask yourself how can I be a better friend
Yeah, when the angels come they're coming down to take you away
You're the one who's gonna have to pay in the end

Oh, I will go on without you
This ain't the first time I've been high and dry
If I should hold on I'll try to
I'm gonna have to fight but I will get by

Yeah, come tomorrow I'll start again
Yeah, I'll never need you and lose myself

Oh, I will go on without you
This ain't the first time I've been high and dry
If should hold on I'll try to
I'm gonna have to fight but I will get by

Oh, I will go on without you
This ain't the first time I've been high and dry
I should hold on I'll try to
I'm gonna have to fight but I will get by
