Slow Ride on a slow train
Gonna get back home and 
Tell ‘em where I came from

Slow Ride on a slow train
Gonna get back home and 
Tell ‘em where I came from

Every night when I close my eyes
My head hurts so bad
that it blows my mind

Every night when I close my eyes
My head hurts so bad
That it blows my mind

Got a devil on my shoulder 
And that ain’t nothing new
I keep doin’ what he says
Cause there ain’t nothing else to do

Oh if you got the money
I know where to spend it honey
Gotta get myself straight
Before I lose my cool

Slow Ride on a slow train
Gonna get back home and 
Tell ‘em where I came from

Slow Ride on a slow train
Gonna get back home and 
Tell ‘em where I came from

The only thing in my days of chains
is this woman in my bed
and this age in my brain

The only thing in my days of chains
is this woman in my bed
and this age in my brain

Slow Ride on a slow train
Gonna get back home and 
Tell ‘em where I came from

Slow Ride on a slow train
Gonna get back home and 
Tell ‘em where I came from

Slow Ride on a slow train
Gonna get back home and 
Tell ‘em where I came from

Slow Ride on a slow train
Gonna get back home and 
Tell ‘em where I came from

Woo hoo woo hoo
Yeah
Woo hoo woo hoo
Oh yeah
Woo hoo woo hoo

Woo hoo woo hoo
Yeah
Woo hoo woo hoo
Oh yeah
Woo hoo woo hoo

Slow Ride on a slow train
Gonna get back home and 
Tell ‘em where I came from

Slow Ride on a slow train
Gonna get back home and 
Tell ‘em where I came from
