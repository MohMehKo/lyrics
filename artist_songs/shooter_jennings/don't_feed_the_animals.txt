Things get tougher when the sun goes down
In the streets and alleys, all the animals collide
Don't feed the animals
Things get tougher when the sun goes down
In the streets and alleys, all the animals collide
Don't feed the animals

I am an animal
And I'm gonna tear you limb from limb
I am an animal
And I'm gonna tear you limb from limb

I saw you staring through your long, brown hair
I caught your scent from way over there
You say that you're stayin at the Sunset Marquee
And you gave me a key to room 116
A couple more drinks and we're feelin the booze
So we trudged up to your hotel room
But your momma never thought when you came out of the womb
That you'd throw yourself to animals

You sing your song like a bird in a cage
But deep down inside
Your mom kept you safe 'til you were of age
I bet your daddy never thought you'd be an animal

Things get tougher when the sun goes down
In the streets and alleys, all the animals collide
Don't feed the animals
Things get tougher when the sun goes down
In the streets and alleys, all the animals collide
Don't feed the animals

I am an animal
And I'm gonna tear you limb from limb
I am an animal
And I'm gonna tear you limb from limb
