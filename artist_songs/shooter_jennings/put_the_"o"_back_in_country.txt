Let's put the O back in country

Well I'm rollin' like a freight train
Comin' straight at you
Playing hillbilly music like I was born to do
You know that ain't country music you been listenin' to

Oh, so are you ready for the country
Are you ready for me?
Better get ready for the country
Ain't I a sight to see
You know there ain't no soul on the radio
Let's put the O back in country

Pickin' easy listenin', ain't what I do best, no
But they say in country music, it's either hit or miss
Well, if you're talking about record sales
You can sound scan this, yeah

Oh, are you ready for the country
Are you ready for me?
But better get ready for the country
Ain't I a sight to see
Oh, you know there ain't no soul on the radio
Let's put the O back in country

You take a little country and a little rock and roll
A little Neil Young and a little George Jones
A little Merle Haggard and a little bit of the Stones
And a little Cash and a whole lotta Waylon

Are you ready for the country
Are you ready for me?
Yeah, better get ready for the country
Ready for me

Yeah, are you ready for the country
Are you ready for me?
Better get ready for the country
Ain't I a sight to see
Yeah, you know we need a little soul on the radio
Let's put the O back in country
