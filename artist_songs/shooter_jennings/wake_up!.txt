They say good fences 
Make good neighbors

For you my friend 
This might be true

But you still gotta put 
The boards on the windows
To the soul inside of you

That t.v. in the corner
That's their greatest tool
They poison you mind 
When you're a child

With their fear 
And their guilt 
And their rules

They teach you that you're just a number
As they program you in school
So by the time you're out 
In their world on your own
You've been trained not to bite
The hand of the cruel

Wake up!

Don't believe that the system is failing
Don't believe that the planet is dead

They'll keep all the food for their fat fucking bellies
And the starving will kill or be fed

And they'll try to turn me against you
So divided,we'll turn to them
Because anything strong cannot be conquered from without
Before first being conquered from within.

Don't let them get you down.
Don't let them get you down.

Don't let them get you down.
Don't let them get you down.
Don't let them get you down.
Don't let them get you down.

Life is a movie,we are all actors
Don't let them edit you out.

Life is a movie,we are all actors
Don't let them edit you out.

Don't let them get you down.
Don't let them get you down.

Don't let them get you down.
Don't let them get you down.
