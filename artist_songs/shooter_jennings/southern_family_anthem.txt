[Verse:]
Granny's got a secret that she's dyin' to hide,
two cousins got married on our daddy's side.
They're a dark mass hangin' from our family tree.
Instead of whiskey, Uncle Albert drank Kerosene.

[Chorus:]
We're sullen by God, our name is mud.
We got eachother's backs, 'cos we got the same blood.
Let the stock market crash, we'll always be free.
We may be trash, but we're a family.
We may be trash, but we're a family.

[Verse:]
Well the whole town knows Cousin Billy is gay.
All the sideways stares finally made him move away.
Brother Daryl ain't daddy's and everybody know,
But we can't tell Daddy cuz he might explode.

[Chorus:]
We're sullen by God, our name is mud.
We got eachother's backs, 'cos we got the same blood.
Let the stock market crash, we'll always be free.
We may be trash, but we're a family.
We may be trash, but we're a family.

[Verse:]
Nephew Jimmy killed a man, got a life in a cell.
His brother Payne is singin' his way through hell.
'Cos Mama's on crank, Daddy's got Hep-C,
Yeah, We all die together, we're a family.

[Chorus:]
We're sullen by God, our name is mud.
We got eachother's backs, 'cos we got the same blood.
Let the stock market crash, 'cos we'll always be free.
We may be trash, but we're a family.
We may be trash, but we're a family.

We may be trash, but we're a family.
