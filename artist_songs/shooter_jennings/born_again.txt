She was a beautiful machine
Built on getaway dreams
She flew higher than the moonbeams
Leavin only her tailstreams
And she never made a sound
About the news that she found
We all fear without a doubt
Soon her jets would be burning out

Mama said all I needed was within
Things were easier back then
When the world begins to spin
Feels like I'm shedding off my skin
And the moon looks like a grin
Feels like I'm being born again 

I remember better days
When she stepped up to the runway
They almost died she used to say
Her words like aerial ballet
How on the seventh silver flight
They were lost and the sky was white
They found god that night
Like a lost satellite

Up so high that we could touch the sky
The heavens unfolding beneath us
And we knew we never gonna die
Cause the hell that we raised was between us
Mama said all I needed was within
But things were easier back then
And when the world begins to spin
Feels like I'm shedding off my skin
And the moon looks like a grin
Feels like I'm being born again
