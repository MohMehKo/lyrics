I’m a rattlesnake and I make no bones
And I’m in too deep like “No Show Jones”
I like a little sugar in my coffee
Somebody’s givin’ you sugar and baby it’s not me

That’s okay, I’ve got a plan of my own
Yeah I got a couple numbers I don’t keep in my phone
Gonna call ‘em up and see who’s around
Gonna spend a couple nights in the dark downtown

She gonna love me right and you love me wrong
Tonight lemme put on some more cheatin’ songs
Put on some Whitley or a little bit of Gosdin
Baby don’t wait up ’cause I’m playin’ possum

Yeah Yeah

Been spendin’ my night in the honky dives
Well I know a few drunk who’re still alive
They call me up to tell me where you been
That you been hangin’ out with the likes of him

That’s all right, baby, I been makin’
I been makin’ moves while you been drinkin’
I’m gonna get what I need from a red light bed
Don’t bother callin’ I turned off my cell

It takes a little moonshine to make a black rose blossom
Baby don’t wait up I’m-a playin’ possum
Playin’ possum

She gonna love me right, you love me wrong
So maybe baby put on some more cheatin’ songs
Put on a little Keith Whitley or a little Vern Gosdin
Baby don’t wait up I’m-a playin’ possum

I’m-a playin’ possum
I’m-a playin’ possum
I’m-a playin’ possum
I’m-a playin’ possum
I’m-a playin’ possum
I’m-a playin’ possum
I’m-a playin’ possum
