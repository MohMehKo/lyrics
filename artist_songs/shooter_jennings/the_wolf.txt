Buyin' a pack of Winston Lights
at the news stand and five and dime
I caught a borrowed glance at the problems of the world

Everything either too high or low
Am I country enough or too rock-n-roll
And God bless poor Anna Nicole

Can't find no shelter from the storm that's coming on
Yeah stick together, or just die like the other dogs
I just can't weather this feeling like I don't belong
In the midst of helter skelter, I just can't find no shelter for The Wolf

Oh, no no

I keep on writing my songs to sing, along this two bit smoke parade
I never wanted the money, and I never wanted fame
Like everyone else who rides my name
Who's poised to push right me in front of that train
And make out like pirates, while I sink in the rain

Can't find no shelter from the storm that's coming on
Yeah stick together, or just die like the other dogs
I can't weather this feeling like I don't belong
Oh, the midst of helter skelter, I just can't find no shelter for The Wolf

Ohhh, no no nooo

{Just can't find no shelter}
No, na no, na no, na no, na no, na no, no
{Just can't find no shelter}

I just can't find no shelter for The Wolf

Oh, no shelter, from the storm that's coming on
Yeah stick together, or just die like the other dogs
Oh, I just can't weather, this feeling like I don't belong
Oh, the midst of helter skelter, I just can't find no shelter
Oh, the midst of helter skelter, I just can't find no shelter for The Wolf

Oh, no no nooo
