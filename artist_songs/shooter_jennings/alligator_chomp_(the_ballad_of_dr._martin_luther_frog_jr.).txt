A long time ago in a swamp far, far away... 
Where Louisiana meets Texas and the snakes fall off the tree 
The critters are gettin' restless, gettin' greedy and mean 
The frogs all hate the toads, crocks all hate the gators 
Ain't nobody gettin' along, they ain't teams, man, they just players 
(Oh no) They all hatin' 
They don't know 
They all gonna get it! 
(Oh no) They all hatin' 
They all green, they don't see 
They all gonna get it! 
Trees fell in the river, cuttin' off the water to the swamp 
But the critters didn't feel the tremor, chasin' tails around the stump 
Birds flyin' by could spot it from the sky but only one froggy knew 
That a gator with them big ol' teeth could chew down trees like a piece of meat 
But the frog stood on up and used a little froggy voice 
Y'all don't see we gotta get it together, right now we gotta make a choice! 
Before the frog got his next word out all anybody saw was a gator mouth 
Swallowin' the froggy whole, while the toads and the crocks all cheered about 
(Oh no) They all hatin' 
Swamps dryin' out, they don't know 
They all gonna get it! 
(Oh no) They all hatin' 
They don't see 
They all gonna get it!
