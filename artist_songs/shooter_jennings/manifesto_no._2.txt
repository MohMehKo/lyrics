If I get to drunk tonight, Jesus gonna drive me home 
If I get to drunk tonight, Jesus gonna drive me home 
If I get to drunk tonight, Jesus gonna drive me home 
Drive me home, drive me home, drive me home 
If I get locked up tonight, Jesus gonna go my bail 
If I get locked up tonight, Jesus gonna go my bail 
If I get locked up tonight, Jesus gonna go my bail 
Go my bail, go my bail, go my bail 
When I go through hell tonight, Jesus gonna ride shotgun 
When I'm closin' on a state line, Jesus gonna ride shotgun 
Caught my woman with another guy so I had to shoot her with a shotgun 
Jesus, come and get me my good Lord
