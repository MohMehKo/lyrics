[Verse]
You made together forever
In a little way today
This one is a blessed one
Don't you wish they could all be that way
There's a diamond in this city
Cuts through alleys and gray skies
Even through days of darkness
There's always a ray of light

[Chorus]
God Bless Alabama
The wild wandering rose
Shes got some angels 
Watching out down the road

[Verse]
Keep it simple when life gets crazy
Sometimes it's crazy all the time
Good things aren't a dime a dozen
When you find a good thing, you gotta treat it right
Were all hopeful dreamers
And I bet you'll be one too
There are many roads to follow 
The only safe one is the truth

[Chorus]
