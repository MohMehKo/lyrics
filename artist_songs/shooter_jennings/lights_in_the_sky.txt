The lights in the sky
Tell me that I love you
Tell me that I need you
Lights in the sky
Tell me that I want you

Gotta have a sense of love
As I watch you from the shadows
I am haunting you
You can cut up anyways
One for all the days I'm obsessed with you
And I covet you
Can't you read the signs?

The lights in the sky
Tell me that I love you
Tell me that I need you
The lights in the sky
Tell me that I love you
Tell me that I need you
Lights in the sky
Tell me that I want you

The kind of fear I've seen
Is the kind I want to protect you from
And it will be done
'Cause I long for you
I am whole, you are wanting
I will devour you
I will become you
I'm a slave to the signs

The lights in the sky
Tell me that I love you
Tell me that I need you
The lights in the sky
Tell me that I love you
Tell me that I need you
Lights in the sky
Tell me that I want you

Just one dance
I assure you I mean you no harm
I'm sorry to catch you off guard
I'll cut you free
If you'll just dance with me

The lights in the sky
Tell me that I love you
Tell me that I need you
The lights in the sky
Tell me that I love you
Tell me that I need you
Lights in the sky
Tell me that I want you
Lights in the sky
Tell me that I want you 
Lights in the sky
Tell me that I want you 
Lights in the sky
