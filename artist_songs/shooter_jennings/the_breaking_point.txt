She came to me with dust in her mouth
She [?] and looking like a millionaire
I could see she'd reached her breaking point
I could see she'd reached her breaking point
Just like me

Spend all your love on the silver cup
And all your gold on the second place love
Ain't no way to make you happy
Only one thing could make me happy
And that's you

And I, I don't want no money from you
Oh, no promises that you'll be true
Yeah, you can do what you wanna do
All I ask is that you
Yeah, you push it to the breaking point
Yeah, you push it to the breaking point
Yeah, you push my to my breaking point

She's the sorceress and I am her jester
I am her captain, and I am her vessel
And time is a theif of the twilight of life
Burns like a cigarette in the hand of a wasted life
And I'll take my time with you

And I, I don't want no money from you
Oh, no promises that you'll be true
Yeah, you can do what you wanna do
All I ask is that you
Oh, you push it to the breaking point
Yeah, you push me to my breaking point
Yeah, you push me to the breaking point

You, yeah, you push it to the breaking point
Yeah, you push me to my breaking point
Yeah, you push it to the breaking point

Queen of spades, radiates with light
My love for you couldnt be more strong
It's hard for you and me
All I ask is that you
Oh, you push it to the breaking point
Yeah, you push me to my breaking point
Yeah, you push it to the breaking point
