Chaos is hanging around.
Put your ear to the ground and shudder from the sound.
The death machine ain't slowing down.
It's gaining pound for pound.

A gas mask is a good tool in the summer of rage.
The building mass graves within the states.
You and I they'll vaccinate.
They're preparing us for an all out police state.

Hush,hush little child your world is going wild.
Can't trust nothing but the love in your momma's eyes.
Hush,hush little child salvation's in your smile.
Just wish I could be alive to see the whole thing in her eyes.

Our only weapon's total defiance.
Let our love for our neighbors guide us.
Speak loud when they try to silence.
Withhold when they try to fight us.

Hush,hush little child your world is going wild.
Can't trust nothing with the love in your momma's eyes.
Hush,hush little child salvation's in your smile.
Just wish I could be 'round to see the whole thing in her eyes.

Hush,hush little child your world is going wild.
Can't trust nothing with the love in your momma's eyes.
Hush, hush little child salvation's in your smile.
Just wish I could be 'round to see the whole thing in her eyes.
