So it comes to the end of the day
And I'm checking out of my hotel room today
It's been two years since I've seen your face
The girl beside me reminds me how you taste

Since I've seen you, I've been beaten down and bruised
And everyday I'm feeling more and more misused
I never thought that I would be without your love
Years gone by, you're still the one I'm thinking of

Sweet Savannah, you shine so bright
May the evening bring your favorite night
Sweet Savannah, you been gone so long
But I've got to move on

It's gettin' cold, I put my jacket on your back
And we smoke a cigarette, the last one in the pack
I still remember exactly what you said
That you had demons that you couldn't put to bed

Now I'm leaving, yeah, I'm moving out west
And it's time for us to lay our history to rest
I still remember a tear drop in your eye
But you know I couldn't stand to see you cry

Sweet Savannah, you shine so bright
May the evening bring your favorite night
Sweet Savannah, you been gone so long
But I've got to move on

So now I close on this Hollywood night
Where this counter-culture cultivates an emptiness inside
Would it be different if you were still here in my life
Would I be sober, and would you be my wife?

Sweet Savannah, you shine so bright
May the evening bring your favorite night
Sweet Savannah, you been gone so long
But I've got to be movin' on
