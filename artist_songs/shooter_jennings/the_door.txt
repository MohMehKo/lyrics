I've heard the sound of my dear old mama crying 
And the sound of the train that took me off to war 
The awful sound of a thousand bombs exploding 
And I wondered if I could take it anymore 

There were times when they almost drove me crazy 
But I did my best and took it like a man 
And who would think in my lonely room I'd hear it 
The one sound in the world my heart can't stand 

To hear that sound and to know its really over 
Through tear stained eyes I watched her walk away 
And of earthquakes, storms and guns and war 
Lord, nothing has ever hurt me more than that lonely sound 
The closing of the door 

And of earthquakes, storms and guns and war 
Lord, nothing ever hurt me more than that lonely sound 
The closing of the door...
