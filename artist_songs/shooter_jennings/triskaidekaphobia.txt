When I check in to 1410 
I know what room I'm really in tonight.
Screams from the room coming down the hall 
Take me back to a place that I can't recall in my mind.

The jack of hearts will break me,
Makes me feel like Judas, baby.
Does he ever float through your mind?
The jack of hearts is aching, 
Silent like a fucus, baby.
Does he ever crash into your mind?

Fear of God and fear of black power,
Fear of the end of the burning tower, collide.
When all of a sudden the door blows open,
Wind starts howling, knocking candles out and she arrives.

The queen of hearts will break me,
Makes me feel like Judas, baby.
Does she ever float through your mind?
Queen of hearts is aching, 
Silent like a fucus, baby.
Does she ever crash into your mind?

King of hearts will break me,
Makes me feel like Judas, baby.
Does he ever float through your mind?
King of hearts is aching. 
Silent like a fucus, baby.
Does he ever shoot into your mind?
