The sun don't burn fast enough for me 
In a cloud of smoke my conscience becomes clean 
A long and lonesome road I've travelled to be free 
And I carry no one and no one carries me 
And I sleep away the days and ride the night 
To another lonely town and lonely night 
But I'll ride away with my freedom in my hands 
To die another day in the broken promise land 
Yeah, I'll ride away and I'll leave you with the sun 
To a life some would call tragic 
I was born unto the gun and I practice 
Bad Magick 
The wind at my back, the desert at my feet 
I know no love, my only fried is my steed 
No one called family, my ties are severed clean 
My mother is the mountain, my father is the stream 
If you see me young lady, just turn and walk away 
I'll be gone in the morn before you wake
