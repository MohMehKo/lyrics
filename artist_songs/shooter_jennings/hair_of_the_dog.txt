[VERSE 1:]
It's a long long road of livin
I wouldn't wanna be sendin
The wrong idea that I'm gettin soft.
I just keep on gettin lost
I don't care too much
If I ever find my way back home.
The railways are too rusty
The roads are just too dusty
I sit and watch the day die all alone.
It's just me and the sun
But pretty soon he's gone
When he goes away, I'll go get stoned.

[CHORUS:]
I drank all last night
Til the crack of dawn
I was pickin to my favorite country songs.
Singing, It won't be long
Til I'm dead and gone
I woke up this morning 
To the hair of the dog.

[VERSE 2:]
I remember sweet young fame
Or maybe it was a dream
She was beggin me to come home when I could.
This whole life protests me
It's a curse and a blessing
A glimpse of where
My daddy stood

[REPEAT CHORUS]
