O darlin' that satin gown
So beautiful you shut my mouth
No need to read our love aloud
Go on and put those candles out
And gone to me 

Had a feeling since I was three
That there was something else inside of me
That I didn't want the world to see 
You're the one that brought that out of me

She is a diamond, who shatters like glass
She lives in color, in a world white and black, and after it all

There were times when things got bad
I didn't want to see the love you had 
There were friends and lovers in my wake
Like a lighthouse you sailed me in safe

She is a diamond, who shatters like glass
She lives in color, in a world white and black, and after it all
