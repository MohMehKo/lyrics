Well, I push my load across the land
Livin' the life of a travelin' man
Dusk brings down another day
Gonna swallow up time and throw it away

[Chorus]
Zero to sixty, she's the next big thing
They tell me it's a steal
Drive all night just to ease the pain
Don't look away
Stay steady at the wheel

You try to sing a familiar tune
Howlin' the words under a bloodshot moon
Blacklight troubadour, push on through
As heartbreak sits right next to you

[Chorus]
Zero to sixty, she's the next big thing
They tell me it's a steal
Drive all night just to ease the pain
Don't look away
Stay steady at the wheel

Steady at the wheel
