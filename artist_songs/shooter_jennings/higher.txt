Well if life's a bowl of cherries
Why is mine the pits
Well I feel like crap from the bottom of my boots to my hat to my fingertips
I wanna get drunk get stoned get high and hang out with my friends
And all I need is a woman's warmth
And that's where you come in

I wanna get high and then get higher
Every city is just a little bit different in the same way
I wanna get drunk and then get drunker
Live every minute to the limit till the end of my days

Well the bus pulls up the honky tonk
And there's a line around the honky-block
Ya know, that's what these crackers love to see
Ya see I threw out my fishing line and honey I caught you
When after the show in the back of the bus 
Oh sweetheart I know what you wanna do

You wanna high and then get higher
Every city is just a little bit different in the same way
Wanna get drunk and then get drunker
Spend every minute to the limit till the end of my days

Now sit down honey I'm gonna tell you the truth for the first time
Oh no dinner no movie no flowers no malls no suit no tie no cell phone calls no promises popcorn roller skates diamond rings
or makin' cakes no brand new fast cars ice cream candy bars checkin' in callin' back no (do you think I'm fat) kiss me once
kiss me twice damn you feel nice thank you dear do you think I might see you next year?

Stoned and then get stoneder
Every woman's just a little bit different in the same way
I wanna get drunk and then get drunker
Yeah live every minute to the limit till the end of my days
Oh yeah spend every minute to the limit till the end of my days
