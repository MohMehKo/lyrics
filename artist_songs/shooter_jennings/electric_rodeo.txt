It's been 16 months since I've been back home 
I make a lot of money I don't know where it goes 
All I know is the guitar and the bottle 
My daddy was a loaded gun 
He said: it ain't no fun livin' on the run, son 
But everywhere I go trouble seems to follow 
So I ride 
And I pick my songs at night at the next big show 
My friends they come and they go 
And love moves a little too slow 
When you're riding with an Electric Rodeo 
Now I can't complain I do alright 
Singin' my songs in a different town every night 
Lookin' for a woman to keep me warm tonight 
From California to the dirt of New York 
From Dallas, Texas to the streets of Baltimore 
Wishin' I was home with a little girl of my own 
And I ride
