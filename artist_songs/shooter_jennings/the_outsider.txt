Times are changing you bet
Seems the older I get
The less I seem to fit
In a young person's world!
And the higher I climb,
The more I see design
How they keep us all confined
Rubbing oyster of their pearls!

[Chorus:]
And I am the outsider
A horse with no rider
I am the fighter
When the darkest day is done!
And I am the survivor
Not lay down and die-er
Long distance driver
And I will overcome!

My daddy he picked cotton
Not a day was misbegotten
But everyone's forgotten
About his climb to the pearly gates.
And next to him I had an easy road
But I have my own heavy load
A bitter kiss has been bestowed
Upon the son of a rebel saint

[Chorus:]
And I am the outsider
A horse with no rider
I am a fighter
When the darkest day is done!
And I am the survivor
Not laying down and die-er
A long distance driver
And I will overcome!
Yes I will!

Every human has a right
To form a union, rise up and fight
From six minutes to midnight
With an old flowing cup...
For every child born a bastard
For every momma's life that's past her
For every inside job disaster
We ain't giving up!

[Chorus:]
And I am the outsider
A horse with no rider
Shelter provider
When the judgement day has come!
And I am the survivor
Not lay down and die-er
Ain't no [?] can fighter...
And I am only one
