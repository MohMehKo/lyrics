I blew in on Tuesday, and shook off my blues day

And glady indulged in some tea
In the time you'd been biding were the songs you'd been writing
So you glady sang them to me
We talked about old times, the good times, the bad times
And how deep down we're still the same
And we talked about women and the hard times we're livin'
And how some things just never change

[CHORUS]
Oh old friend, I might have gone crazy
If I'd lived alone a moment too long
I'll keep you strong, don't let me get lazy
When the rest of the world leaves me blue
Old friend, thank God I still have you

'Til 3 in the morning we sat there recalling
The times of when we were young
While nights on the town when the world had us down
And the pimps and the songs that they sung
And you'll smoke and you'll ask me how did my life just pass me
Is it something that I'm doin' wrong
And I'll say the answers to all of your questions
Is why we've been friends so long

[CHORUS]
Oh old friend, I might have gone crazy
If I'd lived alone a moment too long
I'll keep you strong, don't let me get lazy
When the rest of the world leaves me blue
Old friend, thank God I still have you

When the rest of the world leaves me blue 
Old friend, thank God I still have you
Oh I'm sure glad I do
