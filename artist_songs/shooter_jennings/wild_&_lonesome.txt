The night just seems to drag on forever
Waiting for that cleansing morning call
Running from the mirror,
So I don't see it any clearer
As fireworks bright and loud, burn out and fall

Wild and lonesome
Wild and lonesome
You're blowing through life son
Like a Texas dust storm
Wild and lonesome
Like a child who wants someone to play with
And keep him warm

Bottle full of venom's used for drowning
The ever-loving woman all my time
Take another toke, keep on smiling, life's a joke
Keep on going till I forget the things I've done

Wild and lonesome
Wild and lonesome
You're blowing through life son
Like a Texas dust storm
Wild and lonesome
Like a child who wants someone to play with
And keep him warm

When I finally see the line on the horizon
She illuminates the sky before my eyes
And before I get the chance to ask her for the dance
The poison once again left me immobilized

Wild and lonesome
High and stoned some
You're blowing through life son
Like a Texas dirt storm
Wild and lonesome
Like a child who wants someone to play with
And keep him warm
Someone to lay with, feed him
And keep him warm
