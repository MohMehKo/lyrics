Now darling, I know we've had our problems lately and you've left me after all these years and I know I probably could've treated you better along the line I've seen my mistakes like that time that I took you to Waffle House and you made me mad and I made you walk home in the rain but you never got my sense of humor anyway no you never laughed at my jokes 

I never meant to hurt you 
I never understood the hillbilly things I do 
If our love don't work now darling maybe later 
You can't see the tears behind my aviators 

And oh I know I probably should've come home more often on those long lonely winter nights but you know out of all those women I was always your number one
And I'm sorry about that time I got drunk and hit on your mom and slashed your daddy's tires but I figured they had it coming and I'm sorry about that time that I accidentally shot your dog while I was hunting and I told you he ran away oh wait a minute I told you that didn't I? Oh darling 

I could never share those secrets of my heart 
I feel so much closer to you now that we're apart 
If our love don't work now darling then maybe later 
You can't see the tears behind my aviators
