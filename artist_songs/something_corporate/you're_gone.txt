taking steps back through the words i should've said to you
they all got lost 
you went away 
well i feel sick and you just don't care anymore 
anymore 
hours to be with you 
minutes of me in you
and i can't feel this happening 
so tie my hands back 
and make me feel you coming down 
coming down...

and you don't care 
your face is on a billboard 
and you're everywhere 
you don't care much for interviews 
you're gone you're gone you're gone you're gone
you're gone you're gone you're gone you're gone away 
if you don't like being hurt then please don't stay 

it's hard to wave goodbye from aeroplanes
when i just don't think that you can see 
i taper off
and say its never worth the pain 
but sometimes it is...

and you don't care 
your face is on a billboard 
and your everywhere 
you don't care much for interviews 
you're gone you're gone you're gone you're gone
you're gone you're gone you're gone you're gone away 
if you don't like being hurt then please don't stay 
if you don't like being hurt then please don't stay 

god i wish that i could make this right
i wish that there was something worth the time 
for her to give to me.
a phone call from LA is my present 
there's nothing left for me to give 
I wish I could 
and I know that I should but 
you know I know I won't 

and you don't care 
your face is on a billboard 
and you're everywhere 
you don't care much for interviews 
you're gone you're gone you're gone you're gone
you're gone you're gone you're gone you're gone away 
if you don't like being hurt then please don't stay 
if you don't like being hurt then get away 
if you don't like being hurt then please don't stay
