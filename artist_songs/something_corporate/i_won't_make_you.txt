I'm under attack again my dear, I'm in the way
Got no resolutions, no clever anecdotes to say
And still if I yell at the top of my lungs will it be the same?
I'd fly you a flag, I'd bury this pen into my veins

I wanna feel through you tonight
But I won't make you
I won't make you

The telephone number I got for you says nobody's home
The best thing I can think to do right now is leave it alone

And you had an apology in your mailbox since last July
It's funny when you find the words to say you find no reply

I wanna feel through you tonight
But I won't make you
I won't make you

Scream my name just one more time

But I won't make you
I won't make you

And it's been hours now

To be here like this
And just to lay you down
And just to taste your lips
And just to keep me up
God I'm tired of sleeping
And just to lay inside you
And just to know this feeling

I wanna feel through you tonight
But I won't make you
I won't make you

Scream my name just one more time

But I won't make you
I won't make you
