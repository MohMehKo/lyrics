Another lonely night in Amersterdam
The stars are coming out in waves
And I miss my Miss America from Park Hotel
But I'm too stoned to call it a day

When everything you wanted 
Is hard to hide behind your lies
And I'm locked in my hotel room 
Turning over our goodbyes

I will write this down for you
So you can read it
I will hold my breath for you
Till I can't feel it

Another lonely night in Amsterdam
The water's moving through the sound
The blood is boiling in my veins
and the food I can't keep down

And I don't care if you don't love me
And I don't care if you don't change
And I could live inside the shadow that I cast for you
If it meant that you would stay
And I'll be home before the morning comes,
You won't have to be alone

I will write this down for you
So you can read it
I will hold my breath for you
Till I can't feel it
You don't have to see me this way,
'Cause this way I'm okay
I will write this down, 
I will write this down

Oh love, I'm tangled up again
Oh love, when does this twisting end?
When does this twisting end?

I will write this down for you 
So you can read it
I will hold my breath for you
Till I can't feel it
You won't have to see me this way
Cause this way I'm okay

I will write this down for you,
So you can read it...
