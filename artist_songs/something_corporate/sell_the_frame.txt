Where are you?
& how did ever you find me here?
I get confused
Watching my hands like I'm so scared
I feel confused
I've gone from the house where we first met
When you're gone i will forget

Sell the frame & I am on the way
With nothing better
Board the train & you'll be fast asleep
It's never different
Sell the frame but don't forget
The pictures are worthless, when it's wet
Sell the frame & I am on the way

Where are you?
Does it hurt you to laugh, knowing that I'll be gone?
So long, it's wrong
The blinds on our faces that we've drawn
There's no lamp
Or flood light to show what I can't see
It's what you stole from me

Sell the frame & I am on my way
With nothing different
Sell the frame &
But never better
Sell but don't forget
The picture is worthless when it's wet
Sell the frame & I am on my way

On the tracks we've got less left
She cannot see me, out in her sky

Sell the frame & I am on my way
With nothing different
Sell the frame & I'll be back asleep
But never better
Sell the frame but don't forget
The picture's worthless when it's wet
Sell the frame & I am on my way

Where are you?
Does it hurt you to know
I'm gone?
So long
