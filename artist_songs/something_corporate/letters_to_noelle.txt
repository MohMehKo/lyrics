Letters to Noelle
Marked up cardboard boxes fell
I fell with them
Crushed like them
I am

Letters to Noelle
Years of waiting, nothing fading
Emptied out my pen
Carved the rest into my hand

Letters to Noelle
Written from my darkest cell
Filling up my wishing well
Waiting on their return

But the driveway's clear
You pray for silence
Step into my quiet violence
Do you see pictures in my words?
Standing still, I'm moving faster
Searching out my next disaster
You're gonna get what you deserve

Letters to Noelle
I see them in a box inside a case
That she keeps locked up in a place
I'll never be

Letters to Noelle
I emptied out my veins onto a page
Set to a scream you just can't gauge
She cannot see what's inside of me

But the driveway's clear
You pray for silence
Step into my quiet violence
Do you see pictures in my words?
Standing still, I'm moving faster
Searching for my next disaster
You're gonna get what you deserve

But the driveway's clear
You pray for silence
Step into my quiet violence
She smiles, takin' off her shirt
Standing still, this world moves faster
On her back my next disaster
You're gonna get what you deserve

But the driveway's clear
You pray for silence
Step into my quiet violence
Do you see pictures in my words?
Standing still, I'm moving faster
Searching out my next disaster
You're gonna get what you deserve

Letters to Noelle
Tied on ribbons in my brain
Obsession don't give way to pain
I know that now

I know that now.
