I can hear ticking clocks,
Running rampant in me,
Chiming in apogee
Waiting for the synergy
Of her and me waiting on the light
And I never say goodnight
Never say that I'm always right

Now in you girl
I'm content to drown
You're so high and I'm so down
This night'll end sooner but much sooner now
I'm awake in you and you're asleep in me
All the things I'll never be
Make me wonder could you see
And I said

Wait, till I hit the ground harder
Wish I could wait, to hear your heartbeat fast
Wish I could wait till I missed her flavour
My days are numbered here
And I don't want to be the last one home
Don't want to be the last one home

Though I'm weak inside
I'm thriving just the same
Still calling out your name
Wondering who it is that I should blame
Stabbing hard and buried
Consciousness and fear
Forgetting others I hold dear
Wondering maybe could you hear
And I said to

Wait, till I hit the ground harder
Wish I could wait, to hear your heartbeat fast
Wish I could wait till I missed her flavour
My days are numbered here
And I don't want to be the last one home
No no no
The last one home
(oh here we go...)

And I said,
There you are baby
Just waiting on the sun
Just staring at the sky
Said when will he be done
And I said there you are baby
Waiting on the sun
Staring at the sky
Said when will he be done
When will he be done

And I wish I could wait, till I see you shaking
Wish I could wait to pull out of this one fast
Wish I could wait till I taste your flavour
And maybe I can savour every last drop
And I said

Wait, till I hit the ground harder
Wish I could wait, to hear to hear your heartbeat fast
I wish I could wait to see you shaking
My days are numbered here
And I don't want to be the last one home
The last one home
The last one home
