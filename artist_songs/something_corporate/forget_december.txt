On Christmas morning, outside was pouring
All was hopeless in this home
And no one's speaking, no one creeping
to see if she was on the phone
And you were quiet, this routine riot
was all but practical to me
and if we see it, why can't we beat it
can we let each other be?

Forget December, it won't be better
Than I remember it before
and this month only, will be so lonely
and not so holy anymore

New Years Eve came, but nothing had changed
all the problems just got worse
we sat in silence
no routine science could heal the sickness we rehearse
and if I'm talking, my words are mocking
the deaf ears they have fallen on
These words are tainted with years of jaded
Innocence that's all but gone

Forget December, it won't be better
than I remember it before
and this month only, will be so lonely
and not so holy anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore
Forget December, it won't be better
than I remember it before
this month only will be so lonely
and not so holy anymore
Forget December it won't bet better
than I rememebr it before
a silent night won't feel quite right
It's not so silent anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore

On Christmas morning, outside was pouring
all was hopeless in this home
