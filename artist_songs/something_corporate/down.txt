Let's get drunk
You can drive us to the harbor
Wish upon a star but
Do you know what stars are?
Balls of fire, burning up the black space
Falling from the landscape
Exploding in the face of God

Let's get crazy,
Talk about our big plans
Places that you're going
Places that I haven't been
Build my walls up
Concrete castle
Keep this kingdom free of hassle, yeah

Yeah
Yeah

I hear sound echo in the emptiness
All around but you can't change this loneliness
Look what you've found, I've fallen down

Taste the saline rolling down your cheekbone
Tell me that you're alone, tell me on the telephone
Feel your heart it  breaks within your chest now
Try to get some rest now, sleeps not coming easy for a while, child

Child, yeah

I hear sound echo in the emptiness
All around but you can't change this loneliness
Look what you've found, I've fallen down
Down, down
Down, down

I hear sound echo in the emptiness
All around but you can't change this loneliness
Look what you've found, I've fallen down
Look at what you've found, I'm falling down
Look at what you've found, I'm falling down
