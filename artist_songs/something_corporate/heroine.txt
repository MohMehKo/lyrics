[This song is an early version of "Punk Rock Princess". It's done only on piano with no other instruments. There is a change in lyrics near the end of the song so it's not completely the same as "Punk Rock Princess"]

Maybe when the room is empty, maybe when the bottles full,
maybe when the door gets broke down love can break in. 

Maybe when I'm done with thinking, maybe you can think me whole,
maybe when I'm done with endings this can begin. 

this can begin, this can begin

If you could be my punk rock princess I could be your garage band king.
You could tell me why you just don't fit in and how you're gonna be something.

Maybe when your hair gets darker, maybe when your eyes get wide,
maybe when the walls are smaller there will be more space.
Maybe when I'm not so tired, maybe you could step inside,
maybe when I look for things that I can't replace.

I can't replace, I can't replace

If you could be my punk rock princess I could be your garage band king.
You could tell me why you just don't fit in and how you're 'gonna be something.
If I could be your first real heartache I would do it over again.
If you could be my punk rock princess, I could be like heroine. 

it was this time last year
your so much different now
you watched the traffic clear
you hear the cars spin out

I never thought you'd last, I never dreamed you would.
You watch your life go past, you wonder if you should.

If you should be my punk rock princess 
So I could be your garage band king
You could tell me why you just don't fit in 
and how you're gonna be something
If I could be your first real heartache 
I would do it over again
If you could be my punk rock princess
I could be like heroine. 

Whoa oh, you know you only burn my bridges
Whoa oh, You know you just can’t let it sink in
Whoa oh, you know you only burn my bridges
Whoa oh, You know you just can’t let it sink in
You could be my heroine
