close your eyes, and i will be swimming
lullaby's fill your room, and i will be singing
singing to only you
dont forget ill hold your head
watch the night sky fading red

but as you sleep, and noone is listening
i will lift you off your feet, ill keep you from sinking
don't you wake up yet, cause soon ill be leaving you
soon ill be leaving you, but you won't be leaving me

in the car, the radio leaves me searching for your star
a constellation of frustration driving hard
singing my thoughts back to me, and watching heartache on TV

but as you sleep, and no one is listening
i will lift you off your feet, i'll keep you from sinking
don't you wake up yet, cause soon i'll be leaving you, soon i'll be leaving you
but you won't be leaving me

don't forget i'll hold your head, watch the night sky fading red

but as you sleep, and no one is listening
i will lift you off your feet, i'll keep you from sinking
don't you wake up yet, cause soon i'll be leaving you
soon i'll be leaving you, but you won't be leaving me
