He graduated with a degree in Poli-Sci 
Premeditated what he would do until he died 
And then he faded into a never-rising sky 
Surfaced in the airforce, then learned how to fly 

Mulligan goes to war 
Mulligan goes to war 
The days are gone 
when he could tell you what he's fighting for 
Mulligan goes to war 

Flew helicopters with a patriotic grin 
Built up brick walls, rarely letting people in 
Had his pitfalls and he lived a life of sin 
That life is over now, the new one must begin 

Mulligan goes to war 
Mulligan goes to war 
The days are gone 
when he could tell you what he's fighting for 
Mulligan goes to war 

We all gotta go sometimes 

Made his living selling real estate 
Met his first wife, she came much too late 
To save the low man, he was slowly growing mad 
He lost his business, the economy went bad 

Mulligan goes to war 
Mulligan goes to war 
The days are gone 
when he could tell you what he's fighting for 
Mulligan goes to war
