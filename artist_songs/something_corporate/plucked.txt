(This goes out to the radio stations going out to you...) 

Lucy, I've confessions 
I don't think you ought to know 
Lets just sit back 
Forget about what's past 
You see my longs are wet with age 
Beyond what I can show 
This is the first time 
It's not the last 
it's not the last 

And it's been long since i've moved 
Long since I've grooved on 
And now my empty chorus falls on empty ears 
Since I left LA days ago 
The concert made me crave the shows 
And times when I could be more cavalier 

Don't you look away too long 
You see I've got something you might need 
Don't look away too long 
I said you may not believe and I just may concede 

Holding onto what is right 
The truth escaped me twice last night 
In clouds of smoke and scattered ash 
With visions of an empty hall 
While wiggers crowd the shopping malls 
And overzealous DJ's that ghetto blasted rap 

Don't you look away too long 
You see I've got something you might need 
Don't look away too long 
I said you may not believe and I just may concede 
hey.. 

(Chicka uh) 

Lucy, I've confessions I dont think you want to know 
let's just sit back 
forget about what's past 
you see there are places that we shouldn't go 
and not so fast 

Don't you look away too long 
You see I've got something you might need 
Don't look away too long 
I said you may not believe and I just may concede 
don't don't don't don't 
look away too long 
You see I've got something you might need 
Don't look away too long 
I said you may not believe and I just may concede
