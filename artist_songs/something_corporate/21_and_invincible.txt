some days go by, i wish i was famous
or maybe religious, so i could go to heaven
just like you
i can have a big house, complain about taxes
payoff my ex'es, ain't that living
no one makes fun of me, cause i can't stand up for myself

whoa, 21 and invincible
whoa, can't wait to screw this up
and woah, 21 and invincible
i'm in power for the hour
guess today's gonna blow us away

i've got a girlfriend
she tells me she needs me
and she loves me
we'll probably get married
oh no, and everyone will bit their tongues so hard they'll bleed

when mom hears this song
she'll tell me im crazy
and she'll say to me 
"son you're much too young, go have some fun don't waste your youth like i did"

and whoa, 21 and invincible
whoa, can't wait to screw this up
and woah, 21 and invincible
i'm in power for the hour
i guess today's gonna blow us away

and it's been autumn since the day that i met you
if i had bottomed must i crawl out alone
and i dont wish you know the secrets of summer at all

and whoa, 21 and invincible
whoa, can't wait to fuck this up
and woah, 21 and invincible
i'm in power for the hour
i guess today's gonna blow us away
