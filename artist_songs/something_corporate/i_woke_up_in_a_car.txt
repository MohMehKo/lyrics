i woke up in new york city 
from my sleep behind the wheel 
caught a train to Poughkeepsie
and time stood still 

she wrote me a letter from san diego 
to qualify her luck 
these flights connect through arizona 
but i think i'll stay stuck 

so here i am 
here i am 
well i woke up in a car 
i traced away the fog
so i could see the mississippi on her knees 
i've never been so lost 
i've never felt so much at home 
please write my folks and throw away my keys 
i woke up in a car 
i woke up in a car 

i met a girl who kept tattoos for homes 
that she had loved 
if i were her i'd paint my body 
until all my skin was gone 

she wrote me a letter as we passed through rockford 
she said she won't forget 
maybe i do maybe i don't 
but i know i haven't yet 

so here i am 
here i am 
well i woke up in a car 
i traced away the fog
so i could see the mississippi on her knees 
i've never been so lost 
i've never felt so much at home 
please write my folks and throw away my keys 
i woke up in a car 
i woke up in a car 

and maybe i could live forever 
if not ever i had known
that you'd be waiting here whenever i am all alone

but here i am 
well i woke up in a car 
i traced away the fog
so i could see the mississippi on her knees 
i've never been so lost 
i've never felt so much at home 
please write my folks and throw away my keys
