Staring into the intersection
she thinks that she can fly and she might
holding on in a new direction
she's gonna try it tonight
the closer i get to feeling
the further that i'm feeling from alright
the more i step into the sun
the more i step out of the light

Jessica's covered in a blanket
on a sunday porch
thinking of the weekends
she would party in the city
she doesn't have a flame
she'd prefer to burn out
like a torch
If she gets nowhere in life
At least she knows she's pretty

She said
Hey Now The Straw dog's out in the street
Hey now there's chemicals in the clouds
Hey now they're calling all the police
But they won't get to us anyhow

The moon is shining now
And shadows are what's left of all the noise
simple silhouettes and cut outs
As if we had a choice
he listens closely now
swears that he can hear a voice
that's calling him

and saying

Hey now the straw dog's out in the street
Hey now there's chemicals in the clouds
Hey now there calling all the police
but they won't get to us anyhow... No

What does it take to be a super hero in my world?
make no mistake that these villains always get the girl
we can escape and then we'd skate away from all of this
but no one ever does

She's saying

Hey now the straw dog's out in the street
hey now there's chemicals in the clouds
hey now they're calling all the police
but they won't get to us
No they'll never get to us
hey now the straw dog's out in the street
hey now there's chemicals in the clouds
and they're calling all the police
but they won't get to us
na na na na na na na na now
