It's a good year for a murder
she's praying to jesus, she's pulling the trigger
there's no tears, cause he's not here
she washes her hands, and she fixes the dinner
but soon they'll be coming to rush her away
no one's so sure if her crime had a reason

reasons like seasons
they constantly change
and the seasons of last year
like reasons have floated away
away with this spilt milk
away with this dirty dish water, away
seventeen years, and all that he gave was a daughter

"it's me and the moon," she says
i got no trouble with that
but i am a butterfly, you wouldn't let me die
"it's me and the moon," she says

and it's over, but it just started
the blood stained the carpet
her heart like a crystal
she's lucid and departed
a life left behind, she can find in her mind gone away

away with these nightmares
away with suburbia
shake down away
you marry a role and
you give up your soul til you break down

"it's me and the moon," she says
"i got no trouble with that, but i am a butterfly, you wouldn't let me die"
"it's me and the moon," she says

but what do you say we go for a ride?
what do you say we get high?
but i'm so tired of days that feel like the night

"it's me and the moon," she says
and i got no trouble with that, but i am a butterfly, you wouldn't let me die
i am a butterfly, i am a butterfly, i am a butterfly
