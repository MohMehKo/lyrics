[Originally by Bjork]

While you are away my heart comes undone
Slowly unravels in a ball of yarn
The devil collects it and with a grin
Our love in a ball of yarn

He’ll never return it (when you come back we’ll have to make new love)
He’ll never return it
(when you come back we’ll have to make new love)
