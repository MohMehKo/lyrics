Tonight I watch the lights go out in your house
Wondering how I could get so deep
And you could still get to sleep
In vain I blame my trembling on the cold air
And I can't hide that I've relied on you
Like yellow does on blue

[Chorus:]
And, you're my good feeling.
I'm kneeling inside her room
She paints me blue
And you are my reason
For breathing.
Inside her room, she paints me blue again. (again)

Atlanta started raining on me
And teenage love was underground
Tonight I break the surface
Atlanta started raining on me
But no young girl was claiming me
And naming me
And destiny gets nervous and

[Chorus]

And you're my good feeling.
I'm kneeling inside her room
She paints blue and
You are my reason
For breathing.
Inside her room she paints me blue again.

Atlanta started raining on me
on me
Atlanta started raining on me
on me
