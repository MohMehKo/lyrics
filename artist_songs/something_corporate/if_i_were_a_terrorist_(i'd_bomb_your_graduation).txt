She's out of school again 
But she won't be calling from where she is going 
the lines are jammed this time 
what could a girl like her need with a slacker like me 

If I were a terrorist 
I'd bomb you're graduation 
If I were a terrorist 
there'd be no hesitation 

So I'm going on tour with the band 
She said "stay for the summer" but she don't understand 
That the radio plays what they want you to hear 
and I want them to play you your love song this year 

If I were a terrorist 
I'd bomb you're graduation 
If I were a terrorist 
there'd be no hesitation 
The cameras are flashing 
Her black robe is passing 
and there I am chilled to my bones 
This is the year my girlfirends leaving home 

She'll probably end up with a frat guy 
She'll probably get pinned while I sleep in the van 
I'm sure she'll be home for thanksgiving 
I'll send her a picture of me making out with a fan.... And..... 

If I were a terrorist 
I'd bomb you're graduation 
If I were a terrorist

and there I am chilled to my bones 

This is the year my girlfirends leaving 
this is the year my girlfriends leaving 
this is the year my girlfriends leaving 
home
