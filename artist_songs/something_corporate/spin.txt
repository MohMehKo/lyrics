So you've been knocked and you've been thrown 
And you've run all the way back home 
Saying you were searching for a reason 
And you cried years so much before 
You won't cry much anymore 
Roll with the punches 
Gonna leave it all behind 
These highway signs are 
A sign of the time 

If you wanna spin 
Get yourself back in the game again 
Throw down your money 
Maybe you could win 
But this world won't stop 
So never stop, just spin 

I've been there once or twice before 
Destiny knocking at my door 
But destiny only seemed to erase 
The happiness once where the ruins replaced 

And you said this world treated you cruel 
Played with your head, then played you the fool 
Leave it all behind, don't let it get you down 
If anything, you can be a clown 

If you wanna spin 
Get yourself back in the game again 
Throw down your money 
Maybe you could win 
But this world won't stop 
So never stop, just spin 

And this place is cold 
And you're feeling older now 
And your body hangs 
And you fear you won't get out 
Suck it up, breathe it deep 
Wake up from this creeping sleep 
Turn around and around and around and around 
Yeah, just spin 

If you wanna spin 
Get yourself back in the game again 
Throw down your money 
Maybe you could win 
But this world won't stop 
So never stop, just spin
