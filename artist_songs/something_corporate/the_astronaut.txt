i've been sleeping with ghosts 
i've been watching stars 
crawling out of the sky 
and i've been hoping 
i'm close to the space man movies 
i call my life 

and i've been climbing ladders through time 
i've got tunnel vision 
but i'm doing fine 
and i've been 
watching stars coming off of the wall 
and maybe if i'm lucky i can catch them 
before you fall 
and you are not alone 

calling out to the astronaut 
i need some of what you've got 
i need to be high 
crawling out of the world she brought 
calling out to the astronaut 
i need to be high 

and i've been holding 
this microphone 
and i've been shouting out 
but i think we're alone 
and i've got platinum vision 
and a tin foil touch
i've got you to propel me 
but i still need so much 
not to be alone 

calling out to the astronaut 
i need some of what you've got 
i need to be high 
crawling out of the world she brought 
calling out to the astronaut 
i need to be high 

and you are not alone 
you are not alone 
you are not alone 

calling out to the astronaut 
i need some of what you've got 
i need to be high 
crawling out of the world she brought 
calling out to the astronaut 
i need to be high 
calling out to the astronaut 
i need some of what you've got 
i need to be high 
disappear in the world she brought 
calling out to the astronaut 
i need to be high 

and i've got you to propel me 
but i still need so much
