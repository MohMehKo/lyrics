When it all just fits 
No more waiting up 'till midnight 
To see if he comes home 
And it sinks in 
Through these holes in your old bed sheets 
You might spend your life alone 
And you don't want to be alone 
no not alone 

When you think too much 
And you came to another game 
Despondent out of touch 
And you reach so hard it makes you fall 
For these hands that let you go 
That shouldn't let you go at all 
that shouldnt let you go at all 
no not at all 

I don't know what its like to be you babe 
but from the looks I don't think I want to 
and I know I've been hanging on tight 
so maybe it just might mean I want you 
yeah babe I want you 

You know what I mean 
When I say that I come from a place that hurts 
You fit in my scene 
And try to make everything work 
You watch me turn green 
I come down, yeah but I might never land 
You said you'd understand 
But you don't want to be there 
When it goes down again 

bop bop bop bop bop ba da [x6]

Staring at the ceiling 
Gives me another feeling 
About who you are 
And you know I was really thinking 
I could be another Lincoln 
If I got this far 
If I got this far 
driving in my car 
and Then I started holding on to these I couldn't keep 
And the wise ass called me faggot 
But I feel more like a creep 
and these things creep 
I watch them creep 
and I dont get no sleep 

And I don't know what it's like to take it slow 
and from the feel I don't think I want to 
no I dont want to 
and I now know 
And I know that it seems I'm Letting go 
And things I know, I know would haunt you 
and I don't want to haunt you 

You know what I mean 
When I say that I come from a place that hurts 
You fit in my scene 
And try to make everything work 
You watch me turn green 
I come down, yeah but I might never land 
You said you'd understand 
But you don't want to be there 
When it goes down again 

You know what I mean 
When I say that I come from a place that hurts 
You fit in my scene 
And try to make everything work 
You watch me turn green 
I come down, yeah but I might never land 
You said you'd understand 
But you don't want to be there 
you don't want to be there 
you don't want to be there 
When it goes down again 
when it goes down again
