I met you last month at a party 
You brought me up, you brought me down 
You came to me last night as an apparation 
Now you came around 

What's with you and all your talk of independence? 
What's with me and my lack of innocence? 

Keep it locked up inside the pocket 
And maybe I will sleep 
I'll be right there inside the pocket 
And you'll be knee deep 

My palms were sweaty and my heart grew big 
My leg, my leg was shaking 
How badly I wanted you with me 
You came to me and said "This could be something" 
I'll take something over nothing anyday 

What's with me and the way that I've been lately? 
What's with you and the way you make me feel? 

Keep it locked up inside the pocket 
And maybe I will sleep 
I'll be right there inside the pocket 
And you'll be knee deep 

And I'm scared 
'Cause these things fall apart 
Electric baby 
And I've known it from the start 
So please forgive me for being like I am 
But I'll take you if I can 

Keep it locked up inside the pocket 
And maybe I will sleep 
I'll be right there inside the pocket 
And you'll be knee deep 

Oooooooh.
