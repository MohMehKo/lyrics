Climbing out of the sky a man who could fly and a painting anyone could play.
It's a comic book crush that taught you to trust.
Staring out of the stands at a rock n roll band
and a hero no one else could save, it was never much but it's all that you gave.

And I wonder if you wonder, or did your stars finally explode?
Did the thunder pull you underneath the haze?
I'm amazed, then I let go. 

Little minds let little pain burn big old dreams with little flames,
and you don't think I understand.
Little holes in parachutes won't leave you falling,
if they do, it's because you want to land. 

Climbing out of his chair to fix the T.V. glare is a man
but no one knows he's there.
It's a Dramamine dream that kept them alive but lost.
She's got her plastic friends and a brand new Benz and she laughs,
"Hell, sometimes life ain't fair"
It's a comic book crush that got them nowhere. 

These elevator doors are closing again you leave before I planned.
I taste you walking down the hall.
You left your perfume on the nightstand.
