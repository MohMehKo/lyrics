i close my eyes 
thought i was lost but i was stranded 
i go outside 
to my surprise the sky had landed 
i thought it made more sense 
if i could only keep you guessing 
i was a fool to think 
that i should stop you from undressing 
now i'm believing all the words you say 
that i can't say back to you 
to you

so i fall 
i don't wanna feel this small 
you know i just can't handle this 
handle this at all 
and i'll just fall 
i let my heartbeat drop 
i falter as the music stops 
and you watch me as stall 
and wonder when i fall 

i kiss your neck 
i feel you breathing on my shoulder 
still i'm perfect 
it must be you cause now it's over 
i was so close 
that was the most that i have ever been through 
now old cassettes and cigarettes 
will be the ones to save you 
how can you ask for me to stay 
when all you ever do is go? 
just go 

and so i fall 
i don't wanna feel this small 
you know i just can't handle this 
handle this at all 
and so i fall 
i let my heartbeat drop 
i falter as the music stops 
and you watch me as i stall 
and wonder when i.. 

go on 
you've kept me waiting
go on 
and watch me as i fall 
i don't wanna feel this small 
you know i just can't handle this 
handle this at all 
and so i fall 
i let my heartbeat drop 
i falter as the music stops 
and you watch me as i stall 
and wonder when i..
