A train crashed 
And everything slows down 
I was wishing I could get out of this town 
These dreams we've had 
Have never made you cry 
And I am not a twinkle in your eye 
But I've got to get out of here 
Cuz you drive me up the wall 
I've got to get out of here 
Cuz I can't stand to fall 

And If I die 
see you won't be so close to me 
And I won't be the one 
Who sticks around 
If I'm awake 
see you won't go to sleep, I promise 
And I won't be the one 
Who lets you down 

Tailgates, long talks 
And your superficial friends 
Shiny, silver Fords 
That lead us to dead ends 
And I said do you lick these salty wounds 
That you, yourself condone 
I sit, wait, and I'm all alone 
But I can't go home 
'Cause you're my home 

If I die 
see you won't be so close to me 
And I won't be the one 
Who sticks around 
If I'm awake 
see you won't go to sleep, I promise 
And I won't be the one 
Who lets you down 
No, I won't let you down 
No, I won't let you down 

Tell me where you are tonight 
And is everything alright? 
Do you remember what I said, 
While he's sleeping in your bed? 
tell me now you Smile hard 
cuz i don't smile much so far 
And is he everything you need? 
Is he everything I couldn't be? 
Does he make everything match better? 
Bring you all the shiny weather that you want 
And is he everything 
everything I'm not 

And If I die 
You won't be so close to me 
And I won't be the one 
Who sticks around 
If I'm awake 
see you won't go to sleep, I promise 
And I won't be the one 
Who lets you down 
no, I won't let you down 
no, I won't let you down 
I won't let you down 
I won't let you down
