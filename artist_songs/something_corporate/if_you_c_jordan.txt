I have a story, a bitter anthem for everyone to hear,
about this kid who just don't like me and that's a solid fact.
They say he's hunting me and as you see I'm all swelled up with fear
cuz I can't get him off my back. 

[Chorus:]
If you see Jordan, if you see Jordan,
He makes me sick, he makes me sick
High school's over, high school's over
and you still won't quit.

You tried to fight me down at Tyler's beach and man I think that's great.
You nearly cried and said to yell at you like I do at all the girls.
Then you drove home real quick, did you make it in time to masturbate?
There's one too many of you in this world. 

[Chorus]

You say its chivalry, but its jealousy that led us to this song.
Won't play it often just at least until you're gone.
You'll stop at nothing but the real thing and everything up to that's pretend.
You tried to brainwash all my friends. 

[Chorus]

Fuck you Jordan, fuck you Jordan, 
You make me sick, you make me sick
High school's over, high school's over
I don't care if you dye your hair, 
You'll always be a little redhead bitch
