It's been a bad day,
another bad day and all I want to do is look at you and know I'm okay.
From where I'm sitting these shoes ain't fitting and I'm walking backwards,
looking down, don't see the sky I see the ground. 

Above
below you look and so you wonder,
where the time has gone of looking up, tomorrows on the way.
Above
below you look and so you say,
when I wake up in the morning is it 'gonna be another ugly day? 

She sits in church its 2 pm and look whose back from work again.
I guess they thought your better off, without this life, without a job.
From where I'm sitting these shoes ain't fitting and I'm going nowhere,
killing time, just trying to feed my bleeding mind. 

It's been a bad day,
another bad day and I cross my heart and hope to die
these dreams of yours are 'gonna fly.
