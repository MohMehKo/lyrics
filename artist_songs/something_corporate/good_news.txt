she's trapped inside her room 
with reruns on the screen 
old books and movies 
but she can't stop thinking 
i'm torn between myself 
my radio my friends 
i want to write this one off over and over and over again 
and then she looked at me to scream 
"my castles are falling" 
but i can't look into the street 
without everything changing 

i want to read good news 
i want to be innocent again 
i want to read good news 
but nothing good is happening 

she waits all day 
she stands a stranger in her skin 
she moves the science with her hands 
she lines her walls 
with every paper she can see 
these words consume her 
but they never set her free 
and then she looked at me to scream 
"my castles are falling" 
but i can't look into the street 
without everything changing 

i want to read good news 
i want to be innocent again 
i want to read good news 
but nothing good is happening 

i want to read good news 
i want to be a little kid again 
i want to read good news 
but nothing good is happening 
i want to read good news 
i want to go to sleep at night again 
i want to read good news 
but nothing good is happening
