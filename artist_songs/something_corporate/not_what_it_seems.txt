A long day 
If ever these questions were yours what would you say 
you don't know 
but I'm writing the answers on cheap paper napkins 
and now he's turning off 
and now she's shutting down 
and it's not what it seems 
nothings the same when you give it away 
no its not what it seems 
it's just what you think it is 
and these fights 
they climb through my veins like its mecury rising 
and these nights 
I seem to remember a home that was better 
and now he's turning off 
and now she's shutting down 
and its not what it seems 
nothings the same when you give it away 
no its not what it seems 
its just what you think it is 
and now he's turning off 
his family's breaking down 
and it's not what it seems 
nothings the same when you give it away 
no it's not what it seems 
its just what you think it is its just what you think it is 
no its not what it seems 
nothings the same when you give it away 
no its not what it seems 
it's just what you think it is just what you think it is 
it's just what you think it is 
what you think it is
