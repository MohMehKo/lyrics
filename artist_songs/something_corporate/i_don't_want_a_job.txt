Departures are so hard
You claim
Packing up your things
Your necklaces and rings
Your darvidan and morphine

You can't believe the actor
Smacked her
Gave her a black eye
There's something in a western winter
Where it's easier to say
Goodbye, Goodbye

These yellow lights
are turning red (turning red)
You starve your heart
You starve your head
And when it's over
You go back to bed

I don't want a job
I don't want to go to school
I don't want a job
I've got more important things to do

You keep in touch with old friends
I keep in touch with you
Your begging me to make
Every little word count
I don't now but I used to
You still do drugs
I still play games
You prefer not knowing I call you names
In flights of fancy
Grandeur and fame
Goodbye goodbye

These yellow lights
are turning red (turning red)
You starve your heart
You starve your head
And when it's over
You go back to bed

I don't want a job
I don't want to go to school
I don't want a job
I've got more important things to do

Wake up to the thought of you
It's December, remember
How cold it was in my garage
You sat with your legs crossed
and your heart lost
mine lost in losing you
Street lights like a christmas tree
But the fires aren't burning
Cuz it's 80 degrees
and I'd like to have you alone
In my favorite cologne
With the air on your hair
and we're still getting stoned
It's a shame the games we play
But I like it that way

These yellow lights
are turning red (turning red)
You starve your heart
You starve your head
And when it's over
You go back to bed

I don't want a job
I don't want to go to school
I don't want a job
I've got more important things to do

More important things to do
Than you
