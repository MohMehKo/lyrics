At Cavanaugh Park 
Where I used to sit 
All alone in the dark 
And dream about things 
That I cannot say 
You always said denstiny 
Would blow me away
And nothing's gonna blow me away 

At Cavanaugh Park 
Where you used to take me 
To play in the sand 
And said to me, "Son, one day you'll be a man. 
"And men can do terrible things." 
Yes they can 

And there was never any place 
For someone like me to be 
Totally happy 
I'm running out of clock and that 
Ain't a shock 
Some things never do change 
Never do change 

At Cavanaugh Park 
We used to get high 
Watching teams as they fought 
They loved my friend Adam 
But he always got caught 
Man, that kid made fucking up look cool 
Aren't we all so cool? No, No...

And there was never any place 
For someone like me to be 
Totally happy 
I'm running out of clock and that 
Ain't a shock 
Some things never do change 
Never do change 

Never do change 
Never do change 
Never do change 

At Cavanaugh Park 
Where I used to think 
That this life would be good
And I would do things 
That I thought that I should 
And no one's going to tear me down 

And there was never any place 
For someone like me to be 
Totally happy 
I'm running out of clock and that 
Ain't a shock 
Some things never do change 

And there was never any place 
For someone like me to be 
Totally happy 
I'm running out of clock and that 
Ain't a shock 
Some things never do change 
Never do change 
Never do change 
Never do change
