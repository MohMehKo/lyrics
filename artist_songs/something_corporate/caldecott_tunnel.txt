They're closing down the caldecott tunnel, 
so tonight I'll dream she's the bridge. 
I never knew there'd be distance between us, 
what I've done cannot be repeated... 
And I've got scars I'm willing to show you, 
you had heart that I'll never see, 
she had answers to all the wrong questions, 
It's funny these answers are all that I need. 

Carry me, carry me softly, 
let her down easy so she doesn't know. 
Carry me, carry me waiting, 
Let her down easy so she can let go. 

Tore down your freeway, 
built her an airplane, 
It's crazy the things we made in the sky. 
So picture me drowning, 
pretending I'm happy, 
we end up regreting the things.. 
We don't try. 

Carry me, carry me softly, 
let her down easy so she doesn't know. 
Carry me, carry me waiting, 
Let her down easy so she can let go. 

Here with my problems 
I don't need the light, 
they're bigger than darkness and darker than night. 
I leave on a promise of something that shines, 
perfection aint perfect 

a leaver will find. I find this all the time 

Carry me, carry me softly, 
let her down easy so she doesn't know. 
Carry me, carry me waiting, 
Let her down easy so she can let go.
