Light breaks underneath a heavy door 
And I try to keep myself awake 
Fall all around us on our hotel floor 
And you think that you've made a mistake 
And there's a pain in my stomach from another sleepless binge 
And I struggled to get myself up again 

I wanna hang onto something 
That won't break away or fall apart 
Like the pieces of my heart 

And globes and maps are all around me now 
I wanna feel you breathe me 
Globes and maps I see surround you here 
Why won't you believe me? 
Globes and maps they charter your way back home 
Do you wanna leave or somethin? 

And dreams came around you in a hazy rain 
You opened your mouth wide to feel them fall 
And I write a letter, from a one-way train 
But i don't think you'll read it at all 

And globes and maps are all around me now 
I wanna feel you breathe me 
Globes and maps I see surround you here 
Why won't you believe me? 
Globes and maps they charter your way back home 
Do you wanna leave or somethin? 

And I can't take this anymore 
Well I know that I can't take this anymore 
I can't take this anymore 
Cuz I know someday I'll see you walk out that door 

And globes and maps are all around me now 
I wanna feel you breathe me 
Globes and maps I see surround you here 
Why won't you believe me? 
Globes and maps they chart your way back home 
So Do you wanna leave? Do you wanna leave? 
Globes and maps they chart your way back home 
Do you wanna leave or somethin?
