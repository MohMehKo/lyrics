Your face
Lights up the sky on the highway
Someday
You share your world with me
Someday

You mesmerize me, with diamond eyes
I try to fool myself to think I'll be alright
But I am losing all control, my mind, my heart, my body and my soul.

Never in my life have I been more sure
So come on up to me and close the door
Nobody's made me feel this way before
You're everything I wanted and more

To speak or not too, where to begin
A great dilemma I'm finding myself thin
For all I know you only see me as a friend
I try to tell myself wake up fool
This fairy tale's got to end

Never in my life have a been more sure
So come on up to me and close the door
Nobody's made me feel this way before
You're everything I wanted...

Never in my life have I been more sure
So come on up to me and close the door
Nobody's made me feel this way before
You're everything I wanted and more

You're everything I wanted.
