You're the night in my days,
That I fight to keep from coming
You're the life when I pray, that I feel.
I tried to tame you,
I tried to open your mind.
I tried to save you,
You said it's just a waste of time
'cuz you are meant to explode one day
'cuz you are built that way,
Yeah you are built that way.
[Chorus:]
I delight in my pain,
And I'm shattered like your promises
Though I tried to be sane,
I'm just shattered like,
Shattered like your promises.
Had you been drinking?
Had you been messing up your life?
Like you did mine, not long ago.
That's good for ego,
That's good for motherfucking ego
Like I need it.
Still, while the record company waits
Until our song are say it of lack
But I'm too crazy and
I'm too weak and I'm too busy
Remembering how to smile
And how to be happy.
[Repeat Chorus]
I delight in my pain,
And I'm shattered like your promises
Though I tried to be sane,
I'm just shattered like,
Shattered like.
I'm just shattered, shattered, shattered...[x3]
