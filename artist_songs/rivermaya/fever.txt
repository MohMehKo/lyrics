You're so good to me
A question
Your intentions
You're so naive
Ripe for the pluckin'
Pretty to bleed
We look so good together
You seem so right for me
You promised me heaven
It seemed so right
A special today on roses
I'm so hot from dancing, dancing, dancing
Got some tips from the butcher
A slab of shit
Just like you
We look so good together
You seem so right for me
You promised me heaven
It seemed so right
Like sun and fire
Like dream and sleep
Like a bird's flight
Through a forest deep
Two streams we die
In the open sea
Like destiny
Like destiny...
We look so good together (follow me, go follow me, go follow me)
(I'm dancing)
You seem so right for me (follow me, don't follow me)
(I'm dancing, I'm dancing)
You promised me heaven (follow me, don't follow me, don't follow me)
(I'm dancing)
You promised me heaven (you promised me...)
Heaven (home...)
Heaven (home...)
