Suddenly I was high
Suddenly you did not glitter at all

Suddenly I forgot your face and
All of the things I liked
Finally I was able to control

I'm through with hurting you and
You won't like the answer
So, don't ask me how I'm doin'
I've never been better

Suddenly I'm a locomotive
Glimmering in the sun
Suddenly I just felt like I had won

Over my loss of faith in kindness
Over my fear of you
Hurting me time and again unintentionally
