Well, if you're happy then I'm blue
'Cause I'm not so far, but not with you
And I can't see, why we can't see each other
I telephone but you're sleeping forever

I hate you for the things you do but I love you
And curse you for your beauty,
That makes me make some poetry 'bout love
And I don't think you even think about me
If only you were smiling, and if I was your reason
Tomorrow, I could die

I can only pray my absence will change you
Pretend that you're the one who needs my love
But you celebrate, 'coz yes why should you miss me?
When you know darn well I'd die, just to bring us together

And this is not a love song, don't even think its your song
