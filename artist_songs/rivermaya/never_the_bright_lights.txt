I see the people walking down the streets at night
They all look like they long for a fight
It's like a dream where everybody is for sale
In a country where they're angry and the sky is pale

We always want something more, hell, we want it all
Then you can go back to your life, if that's what it's called
It's such a terrible fate to be young and ugly
And be faced with so much uncertainty

You better keep your sanity
You better keep your sanity

Bright lights go up, big city come down
Bright lights go up, big city come down
Bright lights go up, big city come down
Bright lights go up, big city come down
