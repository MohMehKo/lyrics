And can I be pissed and you cool?
And can you be fire and me ice?
And can we be Wolverine and Bambi?
And if I should drown, will you smile?
Well, if you'd be guillotined that's nice,
I'm laughing so hard, you'll think I'm Satan
There certainly ain't no future,
Like one and one and one ain't three
There's apes in my pillow,
Clowns in your Electric Spanish fly tea
