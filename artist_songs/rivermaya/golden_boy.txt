Native sun arising
Concrete walls are falling
Down into the sea
Are you as happy as me?

Native sons are sleeping
Concrete walls are calling
Peg questions, give no clue
Am I as happy as you?

[Refrain:]
He's just a local boy
It's good he doesn't know
It's good he doesn't know
He's just a local boy

Native walls are calling
Concrete sons are falling
Are you as happy as you?
Peg questions give no clue

Native walls arising
Concrete sons are sleeping
Am I as happy as me?
Down into the sea

[Refrain]

Native walls arising
Concrete sons are sleeping
Peg questions, give no clue
Lost boys, ocean zoo

Native sun arising
Concrete walls are falling
Down into the sea
Are you as happy as me?

[Refrain]
