Wake up it’s time to eat your breakfast
Count-off no need to fix your golly gosh haircut

You just need to be there right away, anyway
Sing and dance, gotta make me wanna stay
Not surf away, no

Rattle my mind before you get your big bucks
But, hey, it’s worth every single second on the boob-tube
Don’t make me lose

You just need to be there right away, anyway
Sing and dance, gotta make me wanna stay
Not surf away, no

Oooh girl, you sure know how to flash that smile
Curves, they swing every single time
Errr, I think I forgot my lines
Don’t worry I’ve got it covered
Phew! That’s a close call
After, don’t wanna watch those soap shows
Longer, I wish noon-time shows were
Over, I guess the show is

You just need to be there right away, anyway
Sing and dance, gotta make me wanna stay
Not surf away, no
