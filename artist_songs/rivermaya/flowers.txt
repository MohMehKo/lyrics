Someone's gone away
Forever
Someone's gone away
Too soon
Did they take him
Up to Heaven
Or did they take him
To the moon?
Nobody answers
Sll her questions
So she gazes at the skies
Maybe someday
When she's all
Grown up
She'll join them
In their lies.
And just before
She turns away
She crafts a little smile:
"someday I will take this flowers to the sky."
