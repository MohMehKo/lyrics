Has the world come to an end
When all you see is just a dream
I hear tomorrows coming
Will I wait and smile again

Will I ever know (how this life means so much to me)
Will I ever know (am I awake to see it through the day)
Will I ever end (is this confusion part of the game)
Will I ever see (my sanctuary)

I hear my mothers scream again
Cut off these ears will someone please
Chase the shadows of the dark
To keep from falling on my knees
Is love an emotion of the past
A memory fading to prey
It doesn't seem tomorrow
Will I ever be the same again

I need to where I belong
To stop this emptiness
Is there a better world than this
Until the color fades
Run away and see
My sanctuary
Look around for a long forgotten dream
An enchanted fairytale
Wanting to play other games
But its always been the same
Run away and see
My sanctuary

Look around for a long forgotten dream
An enchanted fairytale
Wanting to play other games
But its always been the same
Run away and see
My sanctuary
