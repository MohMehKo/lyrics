20 million diamonds
Crown the sky tonight
Silence for two lovers everything 
They tell me whispering's a virtue
And holding hands' their game
'Tis cold, it's cold

And as I watch the candle turn this night to day
My life collects another yesterday

Alone in the darkness
I am waiting for the one
While the lovers wait for the sun
Lay I Waiting for the one

Stalk the streets do lovers in this town tonight
20 million heartbeats holding hands 
For them, it's darkness that's most precious
But tell me who can I embrace 
The cold? There's no one here to hold

And as I watch the candle burn this night away
My life collects another yesterday

Alone in the darkness
I am waiting for the one
While the lovers wait for the sun
Lay I waiting for the one

Who'll light the darkness with her name 
Heal this blackout pain

Alone in the darkness
I am waiting for the one
While the lovers wait for the sun
Lay I waiting for the one

I'm Waiting for the one
Waiting for the one...
Waiting for the...
