Is it unfair
Would you be aware
If I might
Catch you in a stare

Now tell me if it's okay
If I walk past your door today
I'm runnin out of happy things to say

But I don't need a funny line
'Cause nobody laughs at a castle
That's crawling down
With every word you
Every game you
Every hate

Come on now tell me
Would it be a better day for you
If you bring me down?

You got your coat and tie
And you're lookin' so cool
In front of the TV camera
All that just to tell us we'll be gone

Now tell me is it all okay
If I tell you you're fuckin' gay
Don't anyone have a happy thing to say

But I don't need a funny line
'Cause nobody laughs at a castle
That's crumbling down
With every word you
Every game you
Every hate

Come on now tell me
Would it be a better day for you
If you bring me down?

Kill me a little
Kill me a little every day
Is it unfair (is it unfair)
To be aware (come on kill me)
If I might ever catch you in a stare

But I don't need a funny line
'Cause nobody laughs at a castle
That's crumbling down
With every word you
Every game you
Every hate

Come on now tell me
Would it be a better day for you
If you bring me down

Why don't you tell me
Would it be a better day for you
If you bring me down

Bring me down
Bring me down
Bring me down
