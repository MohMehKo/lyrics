A candle light dinner for two
But there’s only me and there’s no you
Waiting for the flowers to bloom
It consumes my world
Thoughts reach up to the moon
It’s understandable that I’m not thinking right
My heart is leading the way
It contradicts my mind but I say

Two different people, one way or another, will find a way to make it work
Some little time for each other is good for the soul
Happily ever after, if you want to live
Look for another side of each other

When can time and logic follow? 
So I guess in the meantime I’ll watch a movie by myself
Not feeling lonely I have some friends to keep me company
But if, when the time comes that I see who’s meant to be with me
Whoever that’ll be
It doesn’t have to be destiny because

Two different people, one way or another, will find a way to make it work
Some little time for each other is good for the soul
Happily ever after, if you want to be
Look for another side of each other
