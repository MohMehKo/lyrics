Good morning, baby
Are you still mad at me?
I guess I couldn't blame you,
I instigated this big mess
I acted Imbecilesque; yeah I know

That I could've heard you
Had I've been listening, but,
Instead my arrogance
Divided us and now I'm
Messed up big time, like my guitar

'Coz I love you, but I've hurt you
And though I wish that I could make you smile;
There is nothing that I can do,
Except send a little song across the miles

I'm terribly sorry
And I hope you forgive me
I am terribly sorry, baby.

I acted totally inept, self-centred imbecilesque

'Coz I love you, but I've hurt you
And though I wish that I could make you smile;
There is nothing that I can do,
Except send a little song across the miles

I'm terribly sorry
And I hope you forgive me
I am terribly sorry, baby.
