I cant let go
I cant let go
Don't want to be on my own
Cant live and die all alone

You promised me forever
We took our oath together
That we will live
Happily ever after
But now it doesn't matter

Once I was a dreamer
Perfect pictures in my head
Now I am just a sleeper
Seeking comfort in my bed
Coz now it doesn't matter
