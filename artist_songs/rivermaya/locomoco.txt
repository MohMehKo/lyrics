We will all be fine
We will just follow the line
Change the train we may go faster
A better life from here on after
Service and hospitality, and always on time

Locomoco

From the slaughter house
To the place of the mouse
Please take us anywhere but
Here where a broken heart's just
An opened mind filled with juicy lust
And medicated disgust

Locomoco

We will never stop now
We're just enjoying the ride
You can never stop us now
We don't care what the neighbors say
We make some noise
It's just insane
But after all the hate we take a bow

Locomoco
Baby come on
