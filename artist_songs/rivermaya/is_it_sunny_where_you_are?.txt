Are you really who you think you are?
Are you really who you are?
Are you really who you say you are?
Are you really who you are?

It√¢s been raining like the southern army where I stand
Is it sunny where you are?

Are we really who we think we are?
Are we really who we are?
Are we really who we say we are
Are we really who we are?
