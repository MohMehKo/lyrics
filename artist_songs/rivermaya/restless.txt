Change your view
Change your mind
Try to tell your self you’re control
Somehow you try to find
A little sense in madness
Turn Away
You were mine
Once before
Complication said it had to end
Crazy whispers in my head again

Call it a restless mystery when you
Find yourself in love with yesterday
Close the door behind you
Walk away
Nothing’s gonna change
I’ll love you anyway

Eyes on you
Across the room
Remember you said later no goodbye?
Guess its true
Don’t you try?
Playing games with destroy again
