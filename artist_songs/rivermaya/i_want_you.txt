I don’t know why, I can’t deny
There’s something in the way you close your eyes
I can’t resist even if I try

I want you in my arms tonight
It’s not right to just ignore you
And let you escape my might

I can’t keep sane
Can you feel my pain
Impure thoughts running in my brain
It’s flying like an aeroplane

I want you in my arms tonight
It’s not right to just ignore you
And let you escape my might
