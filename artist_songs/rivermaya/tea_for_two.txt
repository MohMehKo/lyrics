And when the lights go crashing through the smoke
It makes me think if were rich or broke

And I will do anything for you
And I will do everything for you

We would keep in touch
Like screw and nut
A time for sex, a time for tea

And when the shit goes flying through the fan
It makes me wonder if weâ€™re dog or man
