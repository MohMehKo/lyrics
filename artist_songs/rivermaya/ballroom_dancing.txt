Am I real? Do the words I speak before you make feel
That the love I've got for you will see no ending?
Well if you look into my eyes then you should know
That you have nothing here to doubt nothing to fear
And you can lay your questions down 'cause if you'll hold me
we can fade into the night and you'll know

The world would die and everything may lie
Still you shan't cry 'cause time may pass
But longer than it'll last I'll be by your side
Take my hand and gently close your eyes so you could understand
That there's no greater love tonight than what I've for you
Well if you feel the same way for me then let go
We can journey to a garden no one knows

Life is short my darling tell me that you love me
So we can fade into the night and you'll know
The world could die and everything may lie
But you won't cry 'cause time may pass
And everything won't last but I'll be by your side
Forever by your side so you won't cry
