I don't know what to do
Is that the light, moving away from you
It's always the same
Nothing ever changes
Am I just too tame
Is it time to grow
Or is it time to wander
How can we be so low

Here we are again
But you're still by my side
Three sides to every story
But maybe none is right

Here we are again
Three sides to every story
But maybe none
Maybe none

Hide away, your tears
Hold on to your fears
We are stuck here
No fast forwards
One day takes a year
No one can help you
No one can save me
But you...

Here we are again
But you're still by my side
Three sides to every story
But maybe none is right
Here we are again
Three sides to every story
But maybe none
Maybe none

Say hello to yesterday
Not forever will I stay
In your arms I lay
Blinded by the Darkness
