Goin out on a Saturday
We think its so passe
My girl and I got a new religion
Home is where we stay

Stare at each other for
Couple of hours or more
What are you thinking
Cos you are beautifully smilin
Boy, do I look good in
My own reflection
Its psychological
I'm really only happy in heaven

Stranded in your eyes
And I don't wanna come down
Suspended in your smile

Turn off the TV set
And mobile telephones
Turn off the universe
For even just a moment
I gotta concentrate
No interruption
Beautiful opium
Tonight you've got me
Happy and high.
