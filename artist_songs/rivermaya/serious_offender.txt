She is a catwalk siren
Trapped in the latest fashion
In a seven eleven
She make you dream of heaven

She pull the strings of passion
With clinical precision
She is realization
Of your imagination

She plants a gaze upon you
She feels her skin and sighs
She make you think
She wanna bang bodies
Anywhere baby

But its got to be now
Don’t you believe her
She’ll play you for a joke
The flesh is willing
And your spirit chokesa

She’s a serious offender
She’s a serious offender
