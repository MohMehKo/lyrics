Am I real? Do the words I speak before you make you feel,
That the love I lay for you will see no ending?
Well if you look into my eyes then you should know,
That there is nothing here to doubt, nothing to fear,
And you can lay your questions down cause if you'll hold me
We can fade into the night and you'll know

The world could die, and everything may lie,
Still you shan't cry
Cause time may pass, but longer than it'll last
I'll be by your side

Take my hand, and gently close your eyes so you could understand
That there's no greater love tonight than what I've for you,
Well, if you feel the same way for me, then let go
We can journey to a garden no one knows.
Life is short my darling tell me that you love me
So we could fade into the night and you'll know

The world could die, and everything may lie,
Still you shan't cry
Cause time may pass, and everything won't last
But I'll be by your side,
Forever by your side,

So you won't cry
