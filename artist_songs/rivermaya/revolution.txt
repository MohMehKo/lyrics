I could be a dreamer
I could be insane
But we don't need no Superman
To paint a brighter day

We only need to gather
A million little flames
And if you sing along
I'm/we're gonna find a way

Here we come [2x]

Revolution!
Revolution!

We gotta come together
Believe in what I say
We haven't got forever
Foxy lady come my way

Here we come [2x]

Revolution!
Revolution!

How long must we sing this Song [2x]
