I took a taxi to the pub
I'm drinking all the pain
That seem to leave with every gulp I make
And with tears my eyes were sore
My friend tells me not to drink that vodka chronic
With my coke

He tells me drink it straight
Straight no chaser
Alright now

Its been a while since I last indulged
Myself in this its been a while since I've seen you
And since that day you ran away
Everybodys tellin me not to think of you
Just drink the rum instead

I want to shoot it straight
Straight no chaser
