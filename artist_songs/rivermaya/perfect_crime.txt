Wasted time
The clock kept ticking
Wasted son
How can you keep living
Consider yourself the lucky one
For how long, we don't know
I'd hate to see you go

Pretend to be
Hide behind false melodies
Like a tree
You cast a shadow over me
A gallon of mistakes
Oh disgusting memories
That make vast yellow seas

Nobody knows but you
It's all about what you do
Perfect crime
Nobody knows but you
It's all about what you do
Not in time

Nobody knows but you
It's all about what you do
Perfect crime
Nobody knows but you
It's all about what you do
Not in time

Nobody knows but you
It's all about what you do
Perfect crime
Nobody knows but you
It's all about what you do
Not in time

Not so perfect, not so perfect crime
Not so perfect, not so perfect
