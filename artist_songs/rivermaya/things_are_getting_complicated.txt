The world is churning too fast
How long does time last?
All the questions get debated
Things are getting complicated
It's a little too intense
It don't make any sense
Please excuse me, I'm sedated

This is too complicated
[Repeat chorus]

Find you hands off life's guide
Or die young in empty cradle
I don't feel elated
This is going to be complicated
