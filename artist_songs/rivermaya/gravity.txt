Somebody save me, 'coz my mind is a train
And it don't have a destination, and it don't know my name
It keeps runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin',
well, that kinda explains,
why I see every single madness, but I cant see what is plain

Education's a (teacher/preacher), but it don't teach me how to kiss
I ain't no (preacher/teacher), but believe me when I tell u this...

What goes up, must come down
You'll never get it til ya turn it around
What goes up, must come down

No I don't believe in pictures, nothing can hold the world still
And I don't believe in predictions, maybe just gravity
We keep runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin',
well it makes no sense to me,
we struggle with equations, simplicity's the key

Well, it took me years to years, to learn what I knew all the time

I'm feelin' high, I'm feelin' low, and there's where to go
I'm feelin' high, I'm feelin low, do you love me?

Down up, down up, Gimme some of the funky chicken,
Groovy! Kiss!
