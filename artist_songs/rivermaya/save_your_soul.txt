A pig on the hill watching over you
How can you hide, what can you do
Don't you know she's using you now
And she will never stop until you die
But you can have a way out
Do what she does and pretend to cry

Smile and stare at the long lost pain
No one knows what you might gain
You know that it wouldn't be wise
To listen to her magic lies
Don't be fooled by her biggest thighs
She's just an oversized squid in a disguise

Save your soul
