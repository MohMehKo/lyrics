You don't know what you don't know
Never reason with the undertow
Can I splash into your sea?
Got me wishing

We are magic in the world
Secret like the evening wind so
Silent as the messages we speak
When you are dancing with me

Like a refrigerator snow
Hold me tight until it's time to go
Playing monopoly with me
Roll the dice cause

We are magic in the world
Secret like the evening wind so
Silent as the messages we speak
When you are dancing with me

Feed the fire inside with what you want to know
No more heroes

We are magic in the world
Secret like the evening wind so
Silent as the messages we speak
When you are dancing with me
