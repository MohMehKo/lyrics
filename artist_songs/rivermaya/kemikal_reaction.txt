I’ve been staring at a wall
The only thing missing is a sign that says “dead end up ahead!”
I have not gone AWOL

You’ve got the questions
I have no answers
We feel the same
We have different reactions

I can’t stop thinking about what will happen next
No, I’m not worried
I’m excited
Maybe too excited

Just waiting for myself to come back
I’m alright
I just had to be emotional for a few days

You’ve got the questions
I have no answers
We feel the same
We have different reactions

I can’t stop thinking about what will happen next
No, I’m not worried
I’m excited
Maybe too excited
