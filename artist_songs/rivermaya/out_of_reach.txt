You are the best
That I've ever seen
Out from your apartment
And into my dreams
Up on the rooftop
The comets and me
One of 'em tells me
You're out of reach
Out of reach
Don't turn your head this way.
I need a magic potion
To make you feel
The same way that I feel
O, static photograph
(the one that you wouldn't give to me)
Stolen from your
Best friend's diary
(the one that I stole from her)
Talk to me.
Ttttttttaaaaaaaallllllllkkkkkkkk
Ttttttttoooooooo mmmmmmmeeeeeeee!!!!!
Beatificent scenery
From seventeen
Rows behind you.
I whisper a thought
Pretending you would hear.
I was never gonna
Ever call you
Was never gonna
Waste my time.
Was never gonna see you
But I just changed my mind.
