In a far away land
Yeah I'm the man
Lying in the sand
Yeah without a plan

I believe in mother nature
there's no problem with the future

In my kingdom of tiles
Armed with different styles
I'm taking easy coz I've got my
squeezy! Squeezy

Now its oh so dark
The sun has finally gone
will I see a shark
Or man-eaters in park

I believe in mother nature
there's no problem with the future

In my kingdom of tiles
Armed with different styles
I'm taking easy coz I've got my
squeezy! Squeezy

It's time for the matress
Just for VIP access
Well you can wacth
but you cant touch
yeah you cant touch
