When you ran away it burned like hell
But if you ever feel the need to hold someone before you
Just call me I won't keep you waiting
'Cuz I know one day
You'll come back again
I know you will
I'll wait
Won't be long
You'll come back to me again
Just before you sleep don't you ever think about me?
Don't ever miss the way we kiss
Honey can't you see you've got the means in your possession
Just call me
With a sleight of hand you tricked the one saved you
With a robber's mask you stole his heart
Darling, can't you see dreams of you still guide me
Just call me
