There's got to be one good afternoon
Undescribable magic powers can make this come true

I don't see any changes, any changes
In time, there'll be no one else to follow you
Only if I could see a cavalry of different voices
helping hands, holding a pole, with bright white fabric

There's got to be something I can do
Make a song that could make you sing with me
Only then I can be as happy as unity
Ride with me, take a stroll into humanity
Can you see a fruitless waste of energy
Efforts, in time, will be a part of history

Knock, knock, knock, knock
Where have you been?
Talk, talk, talk, talk
All that you've been doing
