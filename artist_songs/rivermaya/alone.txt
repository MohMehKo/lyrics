Sometimes you need someone to talk to
But nobody seems to be there for you
Just look at the sky and you will see
What a pretty sight, I’m sure you’ll agree
Stars light up the sky at night
Stars watch over you when you cry
Life’s too short to be so lonely
Just let your mind sail across the deep blue sky
Talk to a star like you and me
Don’t be ashamed, say what you want to say
Tell your secrets and make your wishes
It’s time for bed, tomorrow will be a new day
Stars light up the sky at night
Stars light up your hopes and your dreams
You don’t have to fly to reach them
Talk to a star, it’s not as hard as it seems
