She's so fine it's just amazing
I can't help but just keep staring
Like a magic spell found only in my eyes
That I can share
That I will share
Like a rainbow brought up in the sky
And she don't care
'Coz she don't care

She's so fine it's just amazing
I can't help but just keep staring
Like a smile that hides away her pain
That she can share
That she will share
Look into her eyes and you will see
That she don't care
'Coz she don't care

I'm amazed that the world can be
So beautiful
So beautiful
