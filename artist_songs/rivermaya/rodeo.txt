Rhinestone kid on a freeway star
An '87 pickup and a red guitar
Playin' like an angel with a broken wing
A song of true love for his girl Darlene
They haven't seen each other for a year or so
Man, he misses her like we all miss that tv show
Where he first performed that love song 'bout a year ago
Well, if ya haven't heard it yet then this is how it goes...
Ro-De-O-uh-oh-oh-oh
Like the buffalos do it by the wishing well
'Cause they haven't got no money for a cheap motel
Ro-De-O-uh-oh-oh-oh
What sweeter thing could happen to a boy an' a girl?
We gotta do it like mechanical rabbits from hell, yeah
It was the sweetest song playin' on the radio
From the edge of Alabama down to Mexico
It was a number one hit but Darlene didn't know
Whom her fav'rite song was fo'
But everytime she hears it, her heart, like a gong
Would tremble for the man for whom she longs
...For whom she longs...
And 'en she starts to sing along...
Ro-De-O-uh-oh-oh-oh
We gotta do it for a reason, gotta do it for fun
We gotta sparkle like tequila in the hot... Hot sun, yeah!
Ro-De-O-uh-oh-oh-oh
We gotta do it like Sinatra used to do "My Way"
An' in the background there's that Beck dude singin' Odelay
