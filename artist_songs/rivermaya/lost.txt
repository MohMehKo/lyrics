I look around
There's no one I know
I look around
There's no one I know
Well if going out
To party tonight
In this town where there's
A whole lot of dim lights
A-you may crash into
Somebody who's lost
Maybe that's me.
I move around
There's no one I know
I move around
There is no one I know
And if you'll crash into this
Party tonight
In this town where there is
Nothing but dim lights
A-you may bump into somebody
Who's lost
Maybe that's me.
