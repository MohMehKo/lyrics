Another day of pretending blending in
Going around town in your chalmeleon skin
The people you see think they're your friend
What they don't know won't hurt them
Hiding behind your charming smile is a kindness

That's as smooth as a file
You got out to town only with friends you need
You don't really like them but on them you feed

You drink their wine and suck their blood
And when you're through you leave them in the mind

Going all over the place greeting
People with the appropriate face

There's a tupperware party for people like you.
Once you get there, I'm sure you know what to do
There;s plastic food and plastic drinks and plastic girls galore
And there's lots of room on the dancing floor
