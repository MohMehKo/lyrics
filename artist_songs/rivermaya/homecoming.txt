I get chills every morning
They make me strong
They make me strong
By the lamp, by the table
Your clothes are gone
I'm all alone
While the sun is out to play
I look back and I just
Wait for you my love
Until the sun breaks free
I packed my bags for the journey
You said goodbye, our last goodbye
When I'm gone will you miss me?
I'm not letting go, I don't know
While the sun is out to play
I look back and I just
Wait for you my love
Just wait for you my love
Until the sun breaks free
Lover come home, lover come home...
While the sun is out to play
I look back and I just
Say I can't be wrong
Just say I can't be wrong
It's you I want to be with
Lover come home, lover come home...
