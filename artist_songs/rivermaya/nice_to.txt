Let’s go, today, to somewhere we’ve never been
Where to? Who Cares? You know what I don’t even care!
All I know is there’s no turning back, no, there’s not turning round
Cheers to the world we’re enjoying the view
The view

(Oooh)
Turn them away
Turn them away now
(Ooooh)

Nice to!
Nice to know (hooo)
Nice to know you are around
Nice to know, nice to know, nice to know!

Let’s go tonight have you ever seen the sunrise on the other side?
Doesn’t matter that can wait until we get back
Get back
Scream what you feel, let them wonder what’s going on
Cheers to the world I’m enjoying the view
With you!

(Oooh)
Turn them away
Turn them away now
(Ooooh)

Nice to!
Nice to know (hooo)
Nice to know you are around
Nice to know, nice to know, nice to know!

Celebrate life (at the end of the day)
Use your illusions (then cast them away)
Open your eyes in the dark and you’ll still see the light (never end the world will)
Never end the world
We’ll always remember (always remember)

Nice to know (hooo)
Nice to know you are around
Nice to know, nice to know, nice to know!
