Like summer with rain
Not your ordinary Sunday
I feel happier with you than with anybody else
Now it's time for me to feel the love we now possess

For you, for me
We just had to be together
Do you believe?
I don't think we need

Like summer with rain
Not your ordinary Sunday
I've been waking up to endless possibilities

To answer
It's you, for me
We can make this last forever
It's you, for me
We can live the dream forever
Do you believe?
I don't think we need
I don't think we need
