And she'll say she'll
Make you feel allright
And she'll say she'll love you
More than life
Like a living fairy tale
You've got to believe her
So behold
The greatest show on earth
Ladies and gentlemen
The Princess of disguise
And she don't love you for
Just your money
(Money don't turn her on at all)
Funny, when I lie I feel so funny
(Funny, I feel that today)
Like a modern heart attack is
How much you need her
So put your hands together
The princess has arrived...
