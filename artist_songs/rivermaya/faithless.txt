Your so-called friends
Your so-called career
The time on your hands
The lover you cheat on every Monday night
Your sense of protection
Your chord progressions
You had the world

Indebted to no one
But your electronic diary
Well, that’s impressive
You’re so complete!

Until we tumble we are faithless
Until our senses fail were faithless
Until we falter we are faithless
Until there’s nothin’ left to hold on to

The turn of events
The twister called fate
It came without warning
They gave you no freakin’ sign
So now you’ve got zero
Now you’ve got nil

How does it feel?
Until we tumble we are faithless
Until our senses fail were faithless
Until we falter we are faithless Only in darkness
Can we plainly see
The hand that saves
And sets us free
