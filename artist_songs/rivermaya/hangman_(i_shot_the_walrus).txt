Koo-koo-ka-choo I shot the eggman
Under an April morning sky
Immersed in capuccino,
And dirty magazines
Like David Sylvian in my dreams
So from the second floor
A violent sound like laughter
Someone screams "St. Francis Square police!"
Pictures in the pond,
Floating rather pointlessly
Sont les mots qui vont
"Please knock me down!"
Everyone says he was first
To be king of the underground
Finally, finally, dottee Home and free
Portobello weekender just you and me
