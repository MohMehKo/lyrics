Spare me words of wisdom
It won't change the truth
There's a hole in your head
And the devil's in your shoes
Thursday gave me freedom
From the psycho-saving art
Monday showed you someone
Could tear your pride apart
I don't need no wild angel candy
Wild angel candy, can't take (it/you) no more
Save your words of wisdom
It don't change the truth
There's a whore in your bed
And your pride don't fit in your boots
Thursday gave me freedom
From my baby-sitting part
Monday showed you someone
Could tear your soul apart
