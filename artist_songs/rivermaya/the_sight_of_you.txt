Indecisions are eating me up inside
I need a pill to expectorate my pride
What's wrong with me?
I'm losing control

I was never good with gravity
It seems so simple yet so strenuous
I can see a thought bubble
And it goes something like

Hi! Can I be your friend just for tonight?
We don't even need to talk
Just speak with our eyes
Just the sight of you is more than enough

The hand that moves all day
Tick, tock, tick, tock
I think I'm so out of tip-top shape

Huffin' and puffin' she blew my heart away
Blew my heart
Please, please, please
Feel free to burst my bubble

Can I ask for a favor?
I hope you don't mind
Will you let me know, will you let me know?
When your status changes to
Out of a relationship
