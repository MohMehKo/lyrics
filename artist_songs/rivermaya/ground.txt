Could you sleep tonight
And be dreaming tight in your heaven?
Your warm heaven

Would you be feeling right
When children cold outside
dream in rain?
Dream in rain

Would you come down
From your pedestal?
Could you try and touch the ground?

Every day the mirror
stares you in the eyes
of your face / see your face

Can you watch television?
Ain't it like the mirror?
See disgrace / see your face.

Would you come down
From your pedestal?
Could you try and touch the...

Maya on the dying tree,
The cockfight honesty
The sidewalk vendor's
glorious symphony
Could you stare
Would you care,
would you Save your prayers
Save a prayer
Say a prayer
For the children of the rain
