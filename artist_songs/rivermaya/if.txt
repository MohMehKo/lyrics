If I could choose to live my life
There'll be no ifs to say
If I would choose to hold your hand
There'll be no words to say

Without thought, without pride
Leave the things that seem to weaken us
Without fear, leave your lies
Let the magic turn your life around

If I would choose to touch you there
Will you touch me there too?
And if you choose to stay with me
I'll spend my life with you

Without thought, without pride
Leave the things that seem to weaken us
Without fear, leave your lies
Let the magic turn your life around

If I could choose to live my life
There'll be no ifs to say
If I would choose to hold your hand
There'll be no words to say

Without thought, without pride
Leave the things that seem to weaken us
Without fear, leave your lies
Let the magic turn your life around
