Fly far away from this town
Time to call the airline
Until there’s no one around
Nobody we know

Forget about the time
The sum will remind you
Starlight surrounds your smile
What do we do now?

Tempted to go slow
Wasting our time again
It doesn’t matter anyway

Take a long walk down to our favorite place
Where nobody else goes
Laugh about all our favorite things
That nobody else knows

Tempted to go slow
Wasting our time again
It doesn’t matter anyway

This is an occasion where we smile at what we hear
Try to close your eyes and feel the light
I don’t have a reason but I do believe in you
Never mind what the world says
All I know is that were closer
Closer

Tempted to go slow
Wasting our time again
It doesn’t matter anyway
