Why are you still in bed?
You think it's still alright
Should quit while I'm ahead
While it's alright
Stop holding tight

I can't get over this
'Coz I'm useless
And my mind says
I don't belong with you
I guess I need to
Take my cue

It's so empty and tense
It ain't alright
Am I making sense
I hope it's alright
We'll see the light

'Can't stay here in the dark
Where I'll drown in tears
Dont' wanna cry no more
'Can't stay here in the dark
Where I'll drown in tears
Dont wanna cry no more
Let's just close the door
