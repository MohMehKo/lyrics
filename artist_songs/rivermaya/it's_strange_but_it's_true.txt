Ive got you on my mind
Its strange but its true
I'm runnin out of time

I smile like I'm blind
Declarin' well be fine
Divided by the great wide ocean
But isn't it bizarre
I couldn't make my heart
Believe me

Oh its strange but its true
I'm gonna miss you

Its strange but its true
I couldn't seem to say
It strange but its true
I long for you to stay

Alas its got to be
Goodbye for you and me
The best that I can do is make it easy
So girl turn away
Before ya hear me say
Don't leave me

It's shreddin me to strips
Your laughter and your lips
I'd have to cope without their daily magic
So baby bye bye
Now hug me real tight
And squeeze me
