Every drop of golden rain
That drives away the singing pain
Like the wizards skill full hands
A drop could heal this ailing land

Like a little mustard seed
Sown with all you noble deeds
Though alone you have a home
A shining throne

The winds have shown
Here and hereafter
The innocents laughter
The leave will turn green
I have seen i have seen

All your tears all your tears
The ageless years
The war the hate
Come change in fate
(it's getting late)

Peace will come to hold this line
And heal the wounds of passive time
And reapt the fruit in season
And shed the rhyme and reason

Set the sound of homily
To holding hands in unity
You can see the clear blue sky
Do yo believe love never dies?
