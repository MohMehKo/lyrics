Esmerelda
One touch was all I needed to know
You were the one for me
My fate and my destiny
For true love is never easy to find
I never dreamed this day
Would ever come my way
But suddenly I realized
My chance for happiness
Can't be found in some make believe world
Where damsels are in distress

Cause paradise is any place where I can be with you
And leave behind the heartache and the pain that I've been through
Safe in your arms
Safe from the world tonight
For you are my paradise

And I know I could never have dreamed
A feeling so heavenly

Cause paradise is any place where I can be with you
And leave behind the sorrow and the pain that I've been through
Safe in your arms
Safe from the world tonight
For you are my paradise
