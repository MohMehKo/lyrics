She's got heavy equipment
She'll turn your head in an instant
She like to rock and roll all night long

She's a one woman wrecking crew
Playing the part of an ingenue
In your personal tragedy

Veiled in a false innocence, so clever
The poison catalyst of your self destruction

She's a homewrecker
Like a real steam roller
She's gonna drive you into the ground

She's a heartbreaker
A real mischief maker
You know she'll walk away & never look back

Just a near fatal attraction
Maybe a psychotic reaction
You just can't stop yourself, right or wrong

Your tangled web of sin
Put you in the state you're in
Trapped by her passionate design

Sentenced to loneliness, forever
Destined for emptiness & down on your knees

Just a near fatal attraction
Maybe a psychotic reaction
You just can't stop yourself, right or wrong

Your mind's in disarray, left all alone to play
In the wreckage of your shattered dreams

But can you escape, no never
And there won't be any happy endings
