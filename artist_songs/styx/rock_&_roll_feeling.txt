well I've got this crazy feeling
it's a sickness in my soul
well I can't play no 9 to 5 games
hangin' loose is all I know

I get a buzz when I think about ya
riding high's where I belong
gonna get my things together
so if you want come on along

it's a good feeling
it's a rock and roll feeling
it's a good feeling
it's a rock and roll feeling
yeah yeah yeah

well you know that I am coming
and I'm already on my way
so baby don't you worry 'bout tomorrow
you know it seems like a month away

well we got here just this morning
and we're goin' at the light of dawn
well we've only got a short time
so mama won't you keep things going strong

it's a good feeling
it's a rock and roll feeling
it's a good feeling
it's a rock and roll feeling
yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah
