You come to me girl
Tears are in your eyes
Your head's bowed in sorrow
You whisper your good-byes

There's nothing I can tell you
To make you want to stay
So let me ask one question
Before you slip away

After you leave me
Where can I go?
After you leave me
What will I do?

I've seen this moment coming
For such a long, long time
I've laid awake for hours
Rehearsing every line

But now that it's here girl
Can't think of anything to say
So let me ask one question
Before you slip away

After you leave me
Where can I go?
After you leave me
What will I do?

Every time that
I get next to her
I'm hung up in this ring of fire

If I love her
Should I let her go
Or should I beg on a bended knee?

How much longer
Lord, I just don't know
I just can't take it girl
I'm breaking up o'er you

After you leave me
Where can I go?
After you leave me
What will I do?

After you
After you leave
