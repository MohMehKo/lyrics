Well I was born too late to be a Rolling Stone
I don't know Jerry Lee I never me John & Yoko
Standin' with a strat, I'm rock 'n' roll's bastard son
Go out get drunk get wild have fun
I don't got a million dollars don't drive a Cadillac
Give me half a chance 'cause I'm not dead yet

I'm not dead yet
I'm not dead yet
I'm a mad dog fighting with the wall against my back
You better get a bigger gun I'm not dead yet

I've been machine-gunned handgunned hijacked left for dead
Dive-bombed napalmed nuclear warheaded
Dropped from a jet plane with no parachute
Shot by a firing squad & raped by a business suit
I'm dancin' on a land mine baby one leg left
And I can still crawl and I'm not dead yet

Well you're bigger tougher meaner rougher
Dirtier and uglier and sneakier and trickier
You wanna shoot me with a gun, cut me with a knife
Take your bare hands baby rip out my eyes
You knocked me to the floor then you bit me in the neck, well
Hit me again cause I'm not dead yet

I'm not dead yet, no no
I'm not dead yet
Well I'm a wild card hidin' in the middle of the deck
You better get a bigger gun, you better get a bigger gun

Well there's a mugger in the alley there's a sniper in the hall
There's a girl at the bar wants to get me by my balls
And the hangman is hangin', if I autograph the noose
Lee Harvey Oswald's brother's on the loose
Mafia hit man with a bullet for my neck
Some day he's gonna get me but I'm not dead yet

I'm not dead yet
I'm not dead yet
I'm a wild card hidin' in the middle of the deck
You better get a bigger gun, you better get your poison pen
