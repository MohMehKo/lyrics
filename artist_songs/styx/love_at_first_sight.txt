Driving past your house again
I feel the same way I did then
I get weak, just thinking about you
It all began so easily
A look from you a glance from me
Then our eyes met like thunder & lightning

You and I, strangers lost in a moment
Eye to eye
We were caught unaware of the passion inside us

Love at first sight
I know that this can't be happening
No, not to someone like me
Love at first sight
So rare, and so exciting
I only hope this love we found can last

I'm not a man who acts this way
But lately I can't concentrate
And I don't sleep, just dreaming about you
I try to reach you on the phone
But voices there say you're not home
And my heart aches, thinking I've lost you

One more time, seeing your face in the moonlight
One more chance to be caught unaware
Of this passion inside us

Love at first sight
I know that this can't be happening
No, not to someone like me
Love at first sight
It's hard to keep your balance
Moving past the point of no return

If you need some time
To understand your feelings
If you need some time away
I'll be waiting for you
With open arms my love

All that night
We made love in the moonlight
Eye to eye
We were so unaware of the passion inside us

Love at first sight
I know that this can't be happening
No, not to someone like me
Love at first sight
So rare, and so exciting
I only hope this love we found can last
