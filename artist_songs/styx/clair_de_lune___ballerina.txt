It seems you finally had to choose
I guess there was no other way
Between my love and satin shoes
I knew the words you'd have to say

It all began so long ago
That the memory's hardly clear
But when I seen you dance I know
Half your love I'll always share

Ballerina when you dance there's music
Colored lights illuminate your movement
Crowded halls anticipate your gentle smile

Ballerina from the first I knew that
You would always have to dance I knew that
There would surely come a day when you would go
Baby I know...

Dance for me, I beg of you, dance for me
Dance for me, ballerina, dance for me

Ballerina when you dance there's music
Colored lights illuminate your movement
Crowded halls anticipate your gentle smile
