Children of the land
Don't wear a frown upon your face
Come on and join your hands
We're all a part of the human race

The music is here
To let you leave your fears behind
Come on along don't do me wrong
Let's see what you might find

Children of the land
Children of the land
Don't misunderstand
We're all children of the land

Don't trust anyone else
To run your life and set your goals
You've gotta be able to live with yourself
When you are getting old

Others are getting blamed
For messing your life around
It's your own fault if you complain
For letting it get you down

Children of the land
Children of the land
Don't misunderstand
We're all children of the land

Children - come on children now
Children - yeah
Children - I said children yeah
Children - come on children now
Children - of the land
Children - of the land
Children - I said of the land
