another new day takes up on you
a fanfare wakes the land
the naked lives just a shining down
at the dawn of the common man

outside in the madding crowd
he laughs along the way
traffic city, what a pity
it doesn't have a word to say

troubled people, billions of people
they can't seem to understand
the ringing ears are unable to hear
the sounds of the natural plan

yeah yeah yeah
