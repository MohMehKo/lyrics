A child is born in the world tonite, underneath the full moonlight
And on the nightway a fire starts, diesel engines & broken hearts
The girls wanna dance and the boys wanna fight
Gonna get rockin' in the world tonite
The black cat howls and the mad dog bites
Somthing gonna happen in the world tonite

Now up in heaven the starts align, stirring up the world tonite
In the jungle the power's strong, and tribes are restless all night long
And the girls wanna dance, the boys wanna fight
Gonna get rockin' in the world tonite
Tension's rising, you can cut it with a knoife
Sticky situation in the world tonite
The world tonite
Big moon staring at the world tonite

Young blood run free,
You can be anything you wanna be
Young blood run wild
You've got the will of a king and the heart of a child

Yeah so gimme a beat cause here I come.
Tonite's the night I'm
Gonna bang my drum. Gotta million watts on the tip of my tongue
And I feel like a trigger on a loaded gun.
Crank up the station. Shake the foundation. Wake up the nation
We got a situation where someone's got a button, connected to a bomb
And it don't matter whose side you're on
They can have it all back by the morning light,
All we want is the world tonite.

Girls wanna dance, the boys wanna fight
Gonna get rocking in the world tonite
Read all about it in black and white
Everybody gone crazy in the world tonite
