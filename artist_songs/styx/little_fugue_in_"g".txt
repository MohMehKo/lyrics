Get your eyes open wide
And take a good look there outside
You're not here to be denied
Let them have it
Sail them rivers, fly those skies
Thirty-thousand suns to rise
And among them your true love lies
You're gonna find it

Little Face
Little Face
You got big things coming
Bigger than you ever dreamed
Little Face
Little Face
I am beside you running
On this good ol' boy you can lean
You can lean

See Little Face I understand
I won't force you on command
You can meet your own demands
And I will help you

See Little Face
Little Face
We got big things coming
Bigger than you ever dreamed
Little Face
Little Face
I am beside you running
On this good ol' boy you can lean
You can lean

And if the law should ever catch you
Doing things you shouldn't ought to do
Count on me to raise your ball 'cause
I've done worse than you could ever do

Little Face
Little Face
I ame beside you running
On this ol' boy you can lean
You can lean
You can lean right here
Little Face
