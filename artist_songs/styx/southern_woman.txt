first met you in a southern town
on a warm November day
you made me smoke like a whirlwind
I knew we had nothing to say
love me but don't try and make me stay

southern woman
take my soul but don't you take my life
southern woman
make me feel good but don't you tell my wife

[guitar solo]

once again in the early spring
I touched your raven's crown
your wild eyed stories of rare delight
like to knock me down
it's getting so damn hard to put you down

southern woman
take my soul but don't you take my life
southern woman
make me feel good but don't you tell my wife

[instrumental solos]

southern woman
take my soul but don't you take my life
southern woman
make me feel good but don't you tell my wife

southern woman
take my soul but don't you take my life
southern woman
make me feel good but don't you tell my wife

southern woman
yeah
