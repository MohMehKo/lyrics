Reoccurring symptoms
Answer the baleful howl
Bringing me dreams of darkness
The doer of all that's foul
Raping the minds of infants
Sower of unplanted seeds
Full moon warrior
Doer of sordid deeds

Witch Wolf
Night Rider
Why do you call for me?

Thirteenth hour madman
Bringing my soul to fire
Visions of my sweet Beulah
To torment soon retire

Witch Wolf
Night Rider
Why do you call for me?

Got my one-way ticket
on this hell bound train
I can't seem to stop falling
I bear the wrath of Cain

Witch Wolf
Night Rider
Why do you call for me?
