I was waiting all alone last night
When they cancelled all remaining flights
And I was suddenly aware, I was being so unfair
To turn and run from you again

So I called you on the telephone
And I said hey girl I'm coming home
Cause I know my words were cruel
And that I acted like a fool
But I'm gonna make it all up to you

And I don't care what people say
Cause I'm gonna love you night & day
Oh baby if you still want me
Still need me, all you gotta do is let me
Walk right up to your door

I'm makin' my way back to Chicago
I'm makin' my way come rain or shine
I'm gonna find true love waiting for me
I'm gonna make it all work out for good this time

Let's go walking by the beach tonight
And watch the sun come up on Lake Shore Drive
Then I'll take you in my arms
And I'll keep you from all harm
Cause I know everything is gonna be alright

And I don't care what people say
Cause I'm gonna love you night & day
Oh baby if you still want me
Still need me, all you gotta do is let me
Just walk right up to your door

I'm makin' my way back to Chicago
I'm makin' my way come rain or shine
I'm gonna find true love waiting for me
I'm gonna make it all work out for good this time

I'm makin' my way back to Chicago
I'm makin' my way come rain or shine
I'm gonna find true love waiting for me
I'm gonna make it all work out for good
Know it's understood
I'm coming home to stay this time
