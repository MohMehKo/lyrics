welcome my friends
to a place that may seem
most disturbing
quite unnerving

lend me your dreams
and we'll add what we need
to be free
terminally

we'll fly to a spot
where I know there is not
any sorrow
no tomorrow

people just laugh
cause they know how it feels
to have loved
and be loved

don't you worry
ain't no need to hurry
all you really need
is love

bah bah bah bah bah

now you may say
tell me more of this place
so inviting
and exciting

here and above
children love without doubt
and can be
they can be

listen my friends
carefully to direction
to get there
and you know where

love is the place
skewed to matter and space
for us all
for us all

don't you worry
ain't no need to hurry
all you really need
is love, love, love
