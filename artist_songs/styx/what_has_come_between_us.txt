look at all the people
looking at their dreams
smiles upon their faces
tell me what they see

look at all the people
have they gone astray?
living for tomorrow
with dreams of yesterday

lovely lady
tell me what you feel
as a child were you mild
does it make it so unreal?

lovely lady
feel so insecure
when you give all yourself
how can you be sure?

what has come between us
what has made us sad
childhood's forgotten
yet it's hiding in the past

what has come between us
there's something in ourselves
lines upon our faces
saying no more time for rest

lovely lady
tell me what you feel
as a child were you mild
does it make it so unreal?

feel so insecure
when you give all yourself
how can you be sure?
