every day I get the feeling
when you move on down the street
wondering when I'll be your lover
and you'll make my dream complete

the way you walk is so inviting
that I quiver and I shake
the way you move it makes me wonder
how much more can I take

I'm gonna make you feel it
basically that's what I say
I'm gonna make you feel it
cause you want it just that way

every time that we're together
my head starts to rock and roll
I get this strange electric feeling
that I simply can't control

I'm gonna make you feel it
basically that's what I say
I'm gonna make you feel it
cause you want it just that way

[guitar solo]

I'm gonna make you feel it
I'm gonna make you feel it
I'm gonna make you feel it
