Sun's always falling
Weightless and free
Now when you close your eyes
Just breathe, breathe with me

Let go
Release
Let go of the way you're feeling
Release, over and under till you return to me

The sky's always falling
Weight underneath
And when you close your eyes
Just breathe, breathe with me

Let go
Release
Let go of the way you're feeling
Release, over and under till you return to me

Let go of the way you're feeling
Release of the way you are
Let go of the way you're feeling
Release, over and under till you return to me

Let go
Release
Let go
Release
