Mondays, moody mondays
Watch out, I'm the window
Lose my sense to communicate

Monday, moody mondays
Headphones close the world down
Finding ways to spin this week around

Mondays, moody mondays
Falling to the warzone
Check my pulse, cause I'm losing faith

Monday, moody mondays
Shades on eye, the head low
Watching all these people fade away

Mondays, moody mondays
Monday, moody mondays

Mondays, moody mondays
Headphones close the world down
Finding ways to spin this week around

Mondays, moody mondays
Monday, moody mondays
Mondays, moody mondays
Monday, moody mondays
