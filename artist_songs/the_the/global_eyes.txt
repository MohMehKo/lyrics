Mobilize
Globalize
Hypnotize
Homogenize
Shut your eyes
Don't criticize
It's a big surprise
Ain't telling ya lies
Truth hides in plain sight
Kentucky Fried Genocide

Bruised
Screwed
Pickled &
Tattooed
Tried to resist
But destined to lose
Nobody listens
But it's breaking down the door
Only the paranoid really know the score

Mobilize
Globalize
Hypnotize
Homogenize

Market Force is the new dictator
Manipulator & annihilator
Mobilize, globalize
Hypnotize, homogenize
Shut your eyes, don't criticize
It's a big surprise
Ain't telling ya lies
Truth hides in plain sight
Kentucky Fried Genocide
