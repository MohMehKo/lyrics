"The sky is glowing with anticipation,
& casts a shadow across the nation
A dust is rising from the heat of the sun
I'm drinking... for the thirst to come.

But I am, contemplating oneness,
summer's here... but I hardly noticed.
There's no reason to be singing
there's no reason to be here at all...

Occupation, I don't have one
I'd lie in bed, until the cows come,
I'm snowed up, inside my window,
Buried in sand up to my elbows

But I am, contemplating oneness,
summer's here... but I hardly noticed.
There's no reason to be singing
there's no reason to be here at all...

World wars & the fate of nations
the sky is glowing with anticipation
I'm wasting away with worry
& my heart just skipped a beat
But then again...

I felt much calmer
I opened up a can of instant karma
a yoga posture for self awareness
& the devil rides out of
YOUR LIFE!!!
