I paint my lips pillarbox red
It reminds me of the country
Where I was born and bred
Roots lie deeper than bones
So back in time I go
Through the tobacco smoke veil
On the perfumed trail
Where only childhood knows

I lift my face
To feel the rain
Everything's changed
Though it seems the same
The shallow hugs
The muted rage
The weeping skies
The shadowless days
I love and I hate this place
I ran away but I couldn't escape

I paint my lips pillarbox red
It reminds me of the country
Where I was born and bred
Roots lie deeper than bones
So back in time I go
Through the saloon bar doors
Onto the chewing gum floors
Where only childhood knows

I lift my face
To feel the rain
Everything's changed
Though it seems the same
The sarcasm
The bitter remarks
That pierce the chest
And wound the heart
The shallow hugs
The muted rage
The weeping skies
The shadowless days
I love and I hate this place
I ran away but I couldn't escape

I paint my lips pillarbox red
It reminds me of the country
Where I was born and bred
I paint my lips pillarbox red
It reminds me of the country
Where I was born and bred
