There's a tear in my beer
'Cause I'm cryin' for you, dear
You are on my lonesome mind
Into these last nine beers
I have shed a million tears
You are on my lonely mind

I'm gonna keep drinkin' until I'm petrified
And then maybe these tears will leave my eyes

There's a tear in my beer
'Cause I'm cryin' for you, dear
You were on my lonely mind

Last night I walked the floor, and the night before
You were on my lonely mind
It seems my life is through and I'm so goddam blue
You were on my lonely mind

I'm gonna keep drinkin' till I can't move a toe
And then maybe my heart won't hurt me so

There's a tear in my beer
'Cause I'm cryin' for you, dear
You were on my lonely mind

Lord, I've tried and I've tried
But my tears I can't hide
You were on my lonely mind

All these blues that I've found
Have really got me down
You are on my lonely mind

I'm gonna keep on drinkin' till I can't even think
'Cause in the last week I ain't slept a wink

There's a tear in my beer
'Cause I'm cryin' for you, dear
You were on my lonely mind
