Hey man, I got what you need! 
And have you ever wanted something so badly
that it possessed your body and your soul
through the night and through the day
until you finally get it!
And then you realize that it wasn't what you wanted after all.
And then those selfsame sickly little thoughts
now go and attach themselves to something, or somebody, new!
And the whole goddamn thing starts all over again!

Well, I've been crushing the symptoms
But I can't locate the cause.
Could God really be so cruel?
To give us feelings that could never be fulfilled.  Baby!
I've got my sights set on you.  I've got my sight set on you
And someday, someday, someday, you'll come my way.
But when you put your arms around me
I'll be looking over your shoulder for something new
'cause I ain't ever found peace upon the breast of a girl
I ain't ever found peace with the religion of the world
I ain't ever found peace at the bottom of a glass
sometimes it seems the more I ask for the less I receive
sometimes it seems the more I ask for the less I receive
The only true freedom is freedom from the heart's desires
and the only true happiness....this way lies.
