Tumble from your bed
Gonna watch the bathroom mirror reflect the past
As the sands of time slip discreetly through the cracks
Of the floorboards in your room
And through the crack in your other looking glass
Keep on making those pointless decisions everyday
You'll be in another world tonight anyway
Just relax and let your memory serve you
Up the path
Through your heart
And out through the holes in your eyes
You only think you have everything
There remains a little hollow in your heart that you're unable to feel
And that pain behind your eyeballs tells you merely
All's not well with yourself
Keep on making those pointless decisions everyday
You'll be in another world tonight anyway
Just relax and let your memory serve you
Up the path
Through your heart
And out through the holes in your eyes
