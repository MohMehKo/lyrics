Weary blues from waitin'
Lord, I've been waitin' too long
These blues have got me cryin'
Oh, sweet mama, please come home

The snow falls 'round my window
But it can't chill my heart
God knows it died the day you left
My dream world fell apart

Weary blues from waitin'
Lord, I've been waitin' too long
These blues have got me cryin'
Oh, sweet mama, please come home

Through tears I watch young lovers
As they go strolling by
Oh, all the things that might have been
God forgive me if I cry

Weary blues from waitin'
Lord, I've been waitin' too long
These blues have got me cryin'
Oh, sweet mama, please come home
