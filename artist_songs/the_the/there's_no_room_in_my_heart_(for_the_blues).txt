There's no room in my heart for the blues
Love is satisfied to either win or lose
Darling, if our pathways part
Let there be no broken heart
There's no room in my heart for the blues

There's no room in my life for a sigh
We'll be strong enough to face our last goodbye
Darling, if our romance ends
Let us part the best of friends
There's no room in my heart for the blues
