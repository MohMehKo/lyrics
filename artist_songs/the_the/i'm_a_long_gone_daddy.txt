All you want to do is sit around and pout
And now I got enough, so I'm getting out
I'm leavin' now, I'm leavin' now
I'm a long gone daddy, I don't need you anyhow

I've been in the doghouse so doggone long
That when I get a kiss I think that something's wrong
I'm leavin' now, I'm leavin' now
I'm a long gone daddy, I don't need you anyhow

I'll go find a gal that wants to treat me right
You go get yourself a man that wants to fight
I'm leavin' now, I'm leavin' now

I'm a long gone daddy, I don't need you anyhow

You start your jaws a waggin' and they never stop
You never shut your mouth until I blow my top
I'm leavin' now, I'm leavin' now
I'm a long gone daddy, I don't need you anyhow

I'm a gonna do some ridin' on the midnight train
I'm takin' everything except my ball and chain
I'm leavin' now, I'm leavin' now
I'm a long gone daddy, I don't need you anyhow

I'm leavin' now, I'm leavin' now
I'm a long gone daddy, I don't need you anyhow
