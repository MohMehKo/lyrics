I'll be your baby
And I don't mean maybe
If you'll be a baby to me
I'll be your darlin'
And there'll be no quarrellin'
If you'll be a baby to me

I can plow and milk the cow
I'll even do the churnin'
You just look through your cookbook
And keep the home fires burning
Baby, I'll be your baby
If you'll be a baby to me
