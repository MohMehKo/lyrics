Fee fi fo fum
Smell the blood of a gullible bum
Brain dead bored bought into the fraud
BiggerHarderFasterMore!
Trying to find some way of stopping
Struggling home with bags of shopping
Gotta buy gotta-gotta buy-buy
Gotta buy, gotta-gotta-gotta-gotta buy

Don't even like it
But you've just gotta try it
You don't even want it
But you're gonna buy
Gonna-gonna-gonna buy it

Always someone on the TV screen
Trying to sell you something you don't want or need
Sponsored by this, brought to you by that
Even as you slump in the back seat of a cab
But if it ain't you
Well, what're you gonna do?
There's always someone
Right behind you in the queue!

Don't even like it
But you've just gotta try it
You don't even want it
But you're gonna buy
Gonna-gonna-gonna buy it
You don't even need it
But you've just gotta have it
You don't even want it
But you're gonna buy
Gonna-gonna-gonna buy it

Fee fi fo fum
Smell the blood of a gullible bum
Who should've been happy
Could've been content
Who got everything he set out to get
But what is the use of possessing the world
When you do not even possess your self?
What is the point of selling your soul
When there's nothing to buy
And nowhere to go?
