In my solitude
You haunt me
With reveries of days gone by
In my solitude
You taunt me With memories that never die

In my solitude
I'm praying
Dear Lord above
Send back my love

I sit in my chair
I'm filled with despair
'Cause no one could be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude
I'm praying
Dear Lord above
Send back my love
