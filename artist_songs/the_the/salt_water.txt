W-w-wave upon wave
Roll upon roll
Tiny it shrinks
Then huge it blows
Gotta be sharp
Gotta be strong
Things get w-w-weird
Before they go wrong
And he knows that once he starts
He just can't stop
Next life he's coming back as a dog

Blindin' his eyes
Rushin' thru his veins
Tricklin' down thighs
Again
