Monday morning I looked the mirror in the eyes
I think I'd kill myself if I ever went blind
Your life is slipping away
You find out you're older than you thought were today

You've gotta stay optimistic
It gets harder by the second
We all know we're edging our way toward the end

There's people on the streets
Throwing rocks at themselves
'Cause they ain't got no money and they're living in hell
But there's animals down the road adding fuel to this heat
It never did take much guts to be a sheep

Saturday night and I was laying in my bed
The window was open and raindrops were bouncing off my head
When it hit me like a thurderbolt
I don't know nothing and I'm scared that I never will
You pray to your god that you'll never feel so much pain again
But the agony has just begun

Moving on
Opening doors
Life just doesn't seem that simple anymore
And in case I don't see you again
I hope you feel glad that you knew me
While I was here
