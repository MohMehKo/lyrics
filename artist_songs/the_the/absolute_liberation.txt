It's like the scenes in my dreams revisited
You see I live in a seashell, free from the world
Sometimes it feels like a living hell
But I've got to keep a distance from the real world
Sometimes I'm grateful for the peace of mind
Sometimes it seems that I'm becoming like the people I hate
With phoney looks and phoney books and phoney ways of talking
They play with fire and evil
Cushioned by the knowledge of their security
But ignorance is bliss
I've got a feeling that words can't explain
A blood of glue pumps its way through my veins
I'm struck dumb with mental impotence
As the feelings in my head explode in a fountain of ignorance
Sometimes I feel like a poor little soul who fell in love
With someone who didn't love him
A thousand unknown pledges that lie rotting inside a bleeding heart
But don't you think you're just looking for reasons to fortify yourself?
I'm clogging up my mind with perpetual dreams
My actions speak louder than me
I've got a feeling that words can't explain
A blood of glue pumps its way through my veins
And it looks like it's moved its way to my legs
I'm struck dumb with mental impotence
As the feelings in my head explode in a fountain of ignorance
You weigh in without an ounce of common sense
And you know that you've forgotten more than you'll ever know
You only read to avoid thinking
And your head empties when you've got no one to boast to
Without the lubrication of inspiration, you're all washed up!
But I live in a seashell, free from the world
I've got a feeling that words can't explain...
