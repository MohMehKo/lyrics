Love me tender, and kiss me quick
Come alive to the sound of music
Under the Monday morning blues
My heart belongs to no one else but you
When your lover turns out to be a figment of your imagination
Shut yourself in mind and thought and contemplation
My cares were carried away by the ebb tide of a sea of sleep
But I woke up inside a dream
Of my tongue melted to my teeth
I try to keep a smile on my face to hide the pain inside
I sit staring out my bedroom window watching the world pass me by
Sometimes I see clearly and my problems are defined
And this change of heart brings a change of mind
But when I'm thinking in circles my emotions are a mess
And this burning soul is like a flame upon my flesh
