Your bed
At night
Awake
Uptight
Your hopes
Your fears
Your lips
God's ears
Days come.. and go
Beauty dissolves into skull
Time keeps spinning round
History thunders down
Every step of the climb
Led you to this place and time

There's no more power in darkness than in light
There's no more truth above you than inside
The deep down truth, the deep down truth

Your heart
Your mind
Uncoiled
Unblind
Ego undressed
All time compressed
Into that shadow on the wall
From the raindrop waterfall
Crawling down the misting glass
To the future from the past
Every step you take
Leads you from this time and place

There's no more strength in hatred than in love
There's no more truth beneath you than above
There's no more truth in sadness than in joy
There's no more tenderness in girls than in boys

The deep down truth
There's no more truth in hope than in grief
There's no more truth in a saint than a thief
There's no more truth in fate than in chance
There's no more truth in your mind than your heart
There's no more justice in peace than in war
There's no more time behind us than before

The deep down truth, the deep down truth
The deep down truth, the deep down truth
The deep down truth, the deep down truth
