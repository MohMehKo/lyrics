I walked out
You left me
You know I'm hurting for you
It seems now that it's over
But there is nothing I can do
I don't know
Why does love do this to me
I don't know
I don't know

Jackie came, she went away
Deep in the valley, I kissed her that day but
It seems I'm thinking of you
But I'm still thinking about myself

I don't know
Why does love do this to me
I don't know
I don't know

I miss you
You know that
But when I see you sometimes
I'm cut up and I'm broken
There am I asking you how you are

Jackie came, she went away
Deep in the valley, I kissed her that day but
It seems I'm thinking of you
But I'm still thinking of someone else

I don't know
Why does love do this to me
I don't know
I don't know
Yeah yeah yeah yeah...
