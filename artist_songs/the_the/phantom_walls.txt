Sensed but unheard
As the curtain softly stirs
It is not just a memory
But it lives and breathes
Watching over you whilst you sleep
Kneeling beside you when you weep

Hey, don't be afraid
Don't try to run away
Because pain can be your friend
As it explains

The answers to your questions
Consoles you in blue reflections
Listens to your soul's confessions
Then leads you in new directions

So open your heart again
And feel the walls dissolve
Something's whispering to you
It's time to let go
Because the only thing that stays the same
Is that everything must change
Everything must change

Hey, embrace your pain
You cannot run away
And pain can be your friend
As it explains

The answers to your questions
Consoles you in blue reflections
Listens to your soul's confessions
Then leads you in new directions

And all the while that you were waiting
For love to keep the light from waning
It's pain that stops the heart from hating
That cures the mind of hesitating
That helps the soul in separating
From everything that it's been blaming
Everything's changing
