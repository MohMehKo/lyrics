Oh, the rain is slowly falling
And my heart is so sore
Six more miles and leave my darlin'
Never to meet no more

Six more miles to the graveyard
Six more miles long and sad
Six more miles and leave my darlin'
Leave the best friend I ever had

Oh I hear the train a-coming
Bringing my darlin' home
Six more miles to the graveyard
And I'll be left here all alone
