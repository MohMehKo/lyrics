Mirror, mirror on the wall
You've watched me grow since I was small
So what will I regret the most
The things I do or the things I don't?
The deeper you peer into my soul
You'll find that I already know

But I can't say it
Because I can barely face it
My life is halfway through
And I still haven't done
What I'm here to do

Even though the chances flowed
I sat and watched the hours fold
In upon themselves
To stop their hands revealing

What I can't say
What I can barely face
My life is halfway through
And I still haven't done
What I'm here to do
My mummy said
What you give is what you get
And the only thing worth having
Is happiness

But trapped inside my bones
Fear, desire
And hope are on fire
And will expand like smoke

And fall down like rain
Again
Again
Again
