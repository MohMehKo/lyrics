Someday you'll call my name
And I won't answer
Someday you'll reach for me
I won't be there
For you've grown tired of all the love I gave you
But someday, you'll wish that I still cared

All these years
How I've loved you
Still I know I claimed you for my own
Someday you'll call my name and I won't answer
For someday, you'll find yourself alone

When your hair has turned from gold to silver
And your eyes are dimmed by passing years
You'll remember, darling, what I told you
There'll be no one then to dry your tears

There'll come a time in your life, dear
When you'll meet someone who will care
Someday you'll call my name and I won't answer
For someday you'll find that I'm not there
