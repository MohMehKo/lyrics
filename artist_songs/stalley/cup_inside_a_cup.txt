Hey

Pioneer sounds banging out the coup
Cup inside a cup, hanging out the roof
Faded
Eyes high red, keep my pupils shaded
Elated Benz, freshly painted
Skating
You know my daily operating
Get money, keep away from hating
Staying sucker-free, my only occupation
Laying with a bad dub, playing doctor-patient
Go all bling around my neck dangling
Darling
This is pimpin' at it's finest
Black bottles and blue dreams sitting by the grinder
While the Chevy's outside, sitting on wires
Full time grinders, only niggas in my circle
Do one of them harm and I will hurt you
We be [?] breaking curfew
Break bread, never break the circle
Was taught breaking loyalty will haunt and curse you
So every nigga behind me now will be behind my Hearse too

Side cups slowly ghost
This killer got this cup inside
Side cups slowly ghost
This killer got this cup inside
Side cups slowly ghost
This killer got this cup inside
Only crazy nigga I'm the man

Soak up the city as I sip slow
On my porch as I watch the little kids grow
Up in to hustlers, dope criminals
Fascinated by cars and cars stereos
My granny said it's my fault because they all want to mimic you
Pretty women fly clothes and some tennis shoes
And they all wanna get it too
They might grow up and actually really want to get at you
So watch it mister flashy, or watch kinda flashy
And these niggas ask me 'Why don't you show them love? '
'And your click been the same since a little part'
Well since I'm blowing up, niggas started to showing up
Hate started to accumulate, niggas was trying to kill my ball
And I've been light years ahead of these motha...
Ma, full of that purple stuff, so all that griefing and beefing
Go ahead and muzzle it up

Side cups slowly ghost
This killer got this cup inside
Side cups slowly ghost
This killer got this cup inside
Side cups slowly ghost
This killer got this cup inside
Only crazy nigga I'm the man
