On this savage journey...

I ain't seen my lady in days
I been out on these streets so long
Late night to the early morn, I been such a rolling stone
And I just wanna make it home (make it home)
To you (to you, to you, to you)
Blinded by all these street lights
Up late, can't sleep nights
My stomach growling, I ain't eating right
My mind gone, I ain't thinking right
I ain't tryna just be getting by
Don't want a slice, I want the pie
American dream and days of a heathen running up in your building at night
Messed up, this ain't trick or treat
One wrong move they finna squeeze
We ain't come for peace, you can bend your knees and pray all day
They waiting on me to get an a-okay, then the can gon' spray
But today's your day, I'm a let you live, I'm a let you pay
Back everything you ever said to me
So start with the thing that you said to me
I was worthless, I'd never make it
Go ahead! Spill that hatred
You are now face to face with the Third Row
Pharaoh who be down on Death Row
You says to me but I'll let you, you let go
Chevy filled up on Petrol
Times like this I just roll
Avenue that Avenue I'm doing more than just passing through
I'm after you bringing traffic through
Banging out niggas with attitude
Yeah my niggas stay with a little attitude
So like I said before don't act a fool

Yeah yeah yeah, uh
I just wanna make it home to you, to you, to you, to you
I've been out on these streets so long, late night to the early morn
{Late night to the early morn, I've been such a rolling stone}
I just wanna make it home to you, to you, to you, to you {Late night to the early morn, I've been such a rolling stone}
I've been out on these streets so long, late night to the early morn

Motherfucking Roma!
Stoned up
Feeling like I'm in a coma
Hold up
I got some money I should tend to
Gotta get to it, I don't mean to Matthew Kemp you
But shit you
Ain't heard a nigga thorough
It ain't perfect, but I work
And that purple that I got got me on slurring all my words
That's my word, that's my boy too
Y'all don't really know what I was gon' do
Now me stylin', your meek
Wanna see Ross get the A-Rod loot
Big play, hot juice
Drama called and you're Carl Lewis
My opponents so obtuse
Even if they alone in our top two
I'm in Ohio watching Kyrie and Samardo hoopin'
Work loud, chokin'
On your reefer, it's all smoking

Yeah yeah yeah, uh
I just wanna make it home to you, to you, to you, to you
I've been out on these streets so long, late night to the early morn
{Late night to the early morn, I've been such a rolling stone}
I just wanna make it home to you, to you, to you, to you {Late night to the early morn, I've been such a rolling stone}
I've been out on these streets so long, late night to the early morn
{Late night to the early morn, I've been such a rolling stone, rolling stone, rolling stone, I've been such a rolling stone}
{Late night to the early morn, I've been such a rolling stone, rolling stone, rolling stone, I've been such a rolling stone}

Well the whole idea of the American Dream is is there really something out there to be looking for? Is there a... you know, you know, as college students here, you know, that's the kinda thing, you know, we're all looking for it, you know, to find out, you know, that's why, why we're all here, right guys?
