I be their topic of discussion
Long beard, they love him
Lumberjack button to the top
Sway shoes, away of you on the watch
Time ticking slower through these boulders
Rolling through these quarters
Blue dream aroma from the pot
My new thing is right and I think a lot
Just shot all the inspiration for
I can see them hating, that ain't nothing new dog
I've seen it before the hue blow in that old school too dog
I was just ignoring it, five speed, flooring it
The dream, I was exploring it
Tryna live enormous in a farm house
Tall spouse also S Thompsonish
Wrote a lot of consciousness
Now I'm just mobbing with them gangsta kids where lamas grip
Down to protect me if the drama's thick
Kamikaze bomb the end slash philanthropist
Always speak to God but the devil they be dancing with
Under the pale moon light my Star Trek took flight
So anyone tryna shoot me down my niggas gon handle it
Pitch black, one candle lit
Praying for these niggas that wish me bad and can't handle it
I wrote my own manuscript
Follow no rules, nigga I'm cool

I'm cooler than the polar bear's toe nails
Oh hell, there we go again
Weed smoke in the wind
15 inch red line spin
Nigga I'm not kiddin'
About what you talkin' 'bout
Nigga I'm cool
Don't want what you sellin'
Nigga I'm cool
I can put you on the game
But nigga I'm cool
I ain't tryna side with lames
Nigga I'm cool

They fantasize about my life style
If they could kill me right now for everything I write down
They would do it, no hesi
Now that I found love like the lake great heavy
It's a fine line to every money endeavor
See I've been cold
No sweater when I'm locked in
And focused, I'm a go go getter
I've been told no better
I am one with a vendetta
I ain't letting up nigga, it's your passion in my heart
Right next to that dark hole that's leading to my cold shoulders
All a part of the man that stayed sharp
All my pees and queues
X-ing out your marks, niggas better dot
When I get to throwing shells like Mario Cart
I may even hit your head or go straight to your heart
I'm send you off the bed, I ain't waiting on dark
And I'm a do it myself, I ain't waiting on dark
Got the nerves look at me funny like I'm hatin' on y'all
Like I'm supposed to stand here and take the fall
But Tony told me all I got is my word and my balls
And Scarface told me I was invincible dog

I'm cooler than the polar bear's toe nails
Oh hell, there we go again
Weed smoke in the wind
15 inch red line spin
Nigga I'm not kiddin'
About what you talkin' 'bout
Nigga I'm cool
Don't want what you sellin'
Nigga I'm cool
I can put you on the game
But nigga I'm cool
I ain't tryna side with lames
Nigga I'm cool
