I took some time off just to see the world
I live hoppin' in my Jordan 4's
The box logo T
Bermuda shorts, clean resorts, full of tan women
Cooler feel, cold bottles in them
Stretched out like the 7th indent
My 7th heaven is some miles away
But I'll just sit here, American dream in this beach here today
Leave my troubles in the past years and try and stay humble
When the clouds clear cause nobody was around here
When everybody doubted yea
Now it's open letters and gift mail
Kind words from strangers that don't sit well
And every chick I meet is out to get mel I feel
Safe on this island, all my thoughts are locked away
Safe on this island, a treasure full of diamonds
Gems for the rhymin', I drop them every now and then
Black and Mild, smoke through the wind
Ashes on the pages of my journal made from snake skin
Staring in the ocean where the greats swim
I'm thinking 'bout jumping in
Came a long way from jumping tens
Switches on the Impala, tires so skinny I was bouncing on rims
(Popping my color)
Listening to a pimp, UGK ish
I was underground then and still underground now
Difference is I'm under palm trees, not trying to be found

Close my eyes and breathe (just breathe)
And suddenly, I can feel a breeze (feel a breeze)
Let yourself float away cause you spent every day strugglin'
I know that my escape is an island, just an island away

They said don't let this money ever change me
Or let MMG play me
Or none of these music niggas downgrade me
They say in the land of many I'm king
A savior to the whole dream
The same player who kept his goal clean
Khaki starch and his shirt sting
Shoot strings held my pants up
Now I'm hoopla dancing with my thumbs up
Scuba diving in my sun trups
Scrooge McDuck with these big bucks
Green fingers from this paper countin'
Made enough last year to put my mama next to mountains
But who's counting, drowning
Or should I say basting in his glory
Poor boy, the wealthy man is Hawal in my story
When it's all said and done, in this life I had fun and did what I love
Had no regrets, held no grudge
White doves and seagulls remind me of my travels
Spread my wings and fly away
Don't cry if I should die today
I left my mark every mile I stay
Collect my thoughts and paddle away
You can collect my thoughts and paddle away

Close my eyes and breathe (just breathe)
And suddenly, I can feel a breeze (feel a breeze)
Let yourself float away cause you spent every day strugglin'
I know that my escape is an island, just an island away

I was underground then and still underground now
Difference is I ain't tryna be found
I ain't tryna be found
I was underground then and still underground now
Difference is I ain't tryna be found
