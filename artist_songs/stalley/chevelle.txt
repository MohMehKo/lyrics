[Intro:]
O-O-O-Ohio

[Hook - Rashad:]
Chevelle, chevelle, chevelle (chevelle)
Chevelle, you know me well (know me well)
Got me gassing you up, taking you out on the town
Poppin' the trunk, showing you off
So sexy when your top's down

[Verse 1:]
I just wanna show you off to the whole world
Make everyone mad especially my ol’ girl
I ain’t gassin’ when I say you my only girl
Those new shoes and new coach you betta go girl
Go girl you know it’s yo world
You so thorough, twerk for me that talk is so real
Made her steal my super woman foreal
I spent 4 bills just to make that ass fat
And put four 12s in it to make that ass clap
Now you boomin’ yea you boomin’ how I like it
You stay clean with that bubblegum light scent
Dark tent our alone time is well spent
Whip the city cruising on the road trips
You my ride or die my down ass chick
My first crush my first love since a little ass kid
I hung posters of you hoping one day that I get
A chance to show you how deep this love for you is

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
She’s so systematic, she’s so Afrocentric
She’s so black and strong, she’s so wide and long
She won’t never let me get lost she loves to take control
But yeah she know who’s the boss, and she love when I floss
Round the city top down flashing them all
Big blunts burning smoke flowing like an exhaust
Engine purring cat wet feel the bass and like that
I fishtail she throw it right back she love when I get under her
Grip the wheel and talk to her, her skin so soft and comfortable
She do whatever I want her to, the whole city in love with her
Kids huddle around her pointing at her curves
Tellin’ me I can’t wait to get older and find a girl like yours
They wanna sit inside and listen to all her words
Her volume loud I bet your father smiling down on us
The first time I took you out we sat by the curve
Conversing all night long listening to Lavere

[Hook]

[Outro - Rashad:]
Chevelle, chevelle, chevelle chevelle
Chevelle, you know me well (you know me well)
Girl you know me well, girl you know me well (Oooh)
