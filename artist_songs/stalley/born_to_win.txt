Fresh out the bed, hit the... for some kicks
Holler at my guys for exclusives
Bump into Christmas cds, 2 for 6
On the same corner we used to sit
Rapping all night about what we gonna get
When we famous and rich
Or how we gonna change up our neighborhood and kids
I reminisce so vivid, the picture's so exquisite
The childhood so admitted, to the joys of the city
Crashing ball parks, all the boys there with me
Playing till the lights or my mom come get me
And the game is 16 I was trying to score 50
All you hear from the sidelines is this guy can't stick it
It's just one of them days that the sun shines brighter
I'm just one of his... I'm perfectly... it's amazing

[Chorus:]
And it don't stop right there, the game can't stop right here
Cause I'm born to win, yes we gonna win
No the game can't stop right here
Cause I'm born to win, yes we gonna win
No the game can't stop right here
Cause I'm born to win, yes we gonna win
No the game can't stop right here

Roof top cookout talking to my man
Trying to put him onto something he ain't know
He asked how we consider equal man and form...
I told the money don't make the man that's for sure
And cause you walk around with a spotlight... that's a silly... glow
That's why I love this neighborhood, it taught me everything I need to know
About the rest of the globe
And when I'm 300 miles away,
I just close my eyes and come back home
I'm rich and tradition, hold my city up like good wills and suspension
I'm just an everyday man, blue collar to the bone, I can lend you a hand
I got the same game plan that everyone knows
Work hard and trying better myself
Life comes in... enjoy
The weathers I felt, so I give you this letter for help
Just love yourself, city... from everyone else
And life don't get no better than that, and that's...
And life don't get no better than that, and that's...

[Chorus x2]
