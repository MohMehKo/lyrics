American made, I'm on the savage journey
Will I'm earning my stars and stripes won't let these niggas burn me
See it takes time for niggas to learn me
I've been through so much and shit, I ain't close to thirty
Still young in all my glory
Wait, let me tell this story
Hey, been through hell and back
Funny how I'm still intact
Move with the steel in fact
I ain't never pilled a cat
Not saying that I'm over that
Pressure got me ready to squeeze it
When I do, no turning back
A renegade in combat
The red wings and a ball cap
Nigga I am all that
Anxiety and feel you call that
America's nightmare in all black
Ghost in the flesh, I'm all that
I'm mobbin' what you call that
In the front line where they fall back
Chest out, head high
You can say I'm 'bout that life
Never had to think it twice
Never had to think at life
This is just those basic instincts
Eyes never blinkin' twice
Focused and fixated
They never thought I'd make it
Not out of stall county bliss
Look at the sharks and bounties
Grooms and crackheads around me
You would've thought that this would drown me
Are you with the family?
Get down and count it
Montans always said I was a average
But she did say I was a savage kid
And this journey was prevalent
Before I'm hell bent
On success I smell it
Righter than a nose and rightfully I chose
To go where no one before me would ever go
