This beat my right to passage
Cold glasses filed with liquor
Cigars packed in
Shorty laughing, we ain't got in mind
Goofy, white wine
Got 'er loose, now she tryna do me
Cameras flashing, recorders, all to turn into a movie
She working for that leading role
I ain't tryna leave this off
I get lost on lovers role, end up on Misery Bully
Pain can be the biggest bully
Rough you up with head knuckies
Always been that bad cookie
Never sweet and never soft
Heart to the f-in core
Seems like I've been here before
So before you get to chasin' tears, I'm a run in extinct from here
Don't want that tape for eight to air cause that could last for years
Man I've done it myself, couldn't forgive or forget
But I wanted to help, from the next lady
But the next lady was just as crazy as the previous lady
I was previously in Chevy, reminiscing on each and every
Woman that gave me a headache, gold turned into some dead weight
If you mirror headaches
See them right behind me, started feeling like a car chase
So I'm pushing the speedometer, pedal to the floor
Switch lanes, don't wanna be here no more

I'm speeding down lover's lane
Must have tripped a wrong turn
I wants to go the other way
The music on blast and I'm runnin' out of gas and I gotta find this out way yea
Strawberry lights and they fuckin' my sight, traffic jam on the interstate yea
Get around the world and I'm looking for my girl but I'm thinking that it's too late yea
All these lovers in my way [x2]
These lovers in my way [x2]

Traffic jam packed in this loud pack
Just finished so I'm looking, where's my moud at?
Window slightly cracked like drizzle outside
Cupid arrows falling on my windshield
It's hard for me to hide
Half hearts and pocket lips falling from the sky
I'm just hopin' it's my high
Clear my eyes and focus
It's getting late outside
Delivery on with pry, not a good mixture
On my dashboard is a picture of my lady
Damn, I sure miss 'er
Or maybe, I'm just lonely baby
I'm feeling slightly crazy
One minute I'm trying to find her
Next minute I want to run from her
Maybe all my time's up
I've been sitting too long staring at my passenger's seat
Trying to figure out why you gone
My personality too strong
Too caught up on lose wrong
Saying you can move on
When I really want you to hold on
That was just me being silly
I just really want you near me
I wish that you can hear me
Over all these loud engines
I love you and I'm done pretending
This road got me optimistic
Not to mention, I seen you follow me the time from a distance

I'm speeding down lover's lane
Must have tripped a wrong turn
I wants to go the other way
The music on blast and I'm runnin' out of gas and I gotta find this out way yea
Strawberry lights and they fuckin' my sight, traffic jam on the interstate yea
Get around the world and I'm looking for my girl but I'm thinking that it's too late yea
All these lovers in my way [x2]
These lovers in my way [x2]
