Hey, hey, hey
Yeah we crawl up to the top in this savage world
Probably... probably headed,
That's mine to talk!

So don't get too comfortable,
Cause it's a long way down!

A rebel with a cause, here to take it off
See that crown that you wear?
It's time to take it off!
Red cross in the mighty grip
We bare arms, talking' never bite the lip
This is true warrior music, we're central list
Black listed from these black Instagram lists
Even though we're struggling black kids
The fact is we're just hustling so the dirt lift'
A savage raised in the jungle
Among [?] and daemons in these jungle
We do anything just to live up in this jungle
No trees, just concrete, it's hard to breathe up in this jungle
But we rumble in this jungle, six degrees up in this jungle
No separation, always hard to leave up this jungle.
And we wonder why we turn bad when we come past this jungle
Cause we done see and had enough bad
While living through this struggle!

[Hook:]
Yeah we crawl up to the top in this savage world
Probably... probably headed, that's mine to take
So don't get too comfortable, no, no!
Sit still on the top of the world now
Nothing's [?] can't leave the place
So don't get too comfortable,
Cause it's a long way down!

Black mens, black love, the hood terrorist
Intelligent, psychopaths, the world scared of us!
The skin of a million slaves, they don't tearing us
Show up at your master's door, ain't no fearing us.
We berry love, seen slug with this rapping message
We've been in the trap too long, we just want our leverage
Gave in time, set to hell, now we want our heavens
Kings and Alexander McQueen and some Jordan sevens
[?] rebellious scary can't suck their tails in
Before we're marching' to tell in
And tell salvation or they take my hands and jammed'
Crucified by Lucifer, only sick of being poor
Guess we got the show in, no choice to do it right or bad
We were forced in,
Poor souls with poor pockets searching for a fortune
Crawling out this hole, we was tossed in
Coming from that crown that you floss in!

[Hook:]
Yeah we crawl up to the top in this savage world
Probably... probably headed, that's mine to take
So don't get too comfortable, no, no!
Sit still on the top of the world now
Nothing's [?] can't leave the place
So don't get too comfortable,
Cause it's a long way down!
