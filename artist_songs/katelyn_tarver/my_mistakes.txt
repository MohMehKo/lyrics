I remember when 
You swam across the night 
We pushed away the starry sky (the starry sky) 
And everything we said 
Was echoed with a smile 
You promised me we'd stay awhile, but just awhile 

I thought that it could last 
But the sun came out so fast 
And chased away all the dreams I had 

Hold me close to let me go 
You tell me yes when it's a no 
You never know, so walk away 
It's no use, don't bother saying 
That you'll miss me when you're busy 
'Cause all your circles keep me dizzy 
We'll never know, so walk away 
I've had enough, I can show what it takes 
To learn from my mistakes 

So, now you wanna talk 
To say we'll just be friends 
The conversation never ends (it never ends) 
So, save your empty words 
I've heard them all before 
And I can't take it anymore, I'm making sure 
That this time it will last 
The sun will never pass 
I'll chase away the shadows that we had 

Hold me close to let me go 
You tell me yes when it's a no 
You never know, so walk away 
It's no use, don't bother saying 
That you'll miss me when you're busy 
'Cause all your circles keep me dizzy 
We'll never know, so walk away 
I've had enough, I can show what it takes 
To learn from my mistakes 

I'm giving you back the things you gave me 
All your maybes make me crazy 
I'm so tired of waiting around for you 

You hold me close to let me go 
You tell me yes when it's a no 
You never know, so walk away 
It's no use, don't bother saying 
That you'll miss me when you're busy 
'Cause all your circles keep me dizzy 
We'll never know, so walk away 
I've had enough, I can show what it takes 
To learn from my mistakes 

I can show what it takes 
To learn from my mistakes
