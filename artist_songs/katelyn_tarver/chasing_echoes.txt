Like a photo
Like a second thought
Always silent
I just think a lot

I still wonder
Am I still stuck in your head
In your head

Like I'm waiting
Like I'm strained to feel
I can't understand
I wanted you still

I still wonder
Am I still stuck in your head
In your head

Are you really gone
Are you moving on
Tell me tell me
Where did we go wrong
Are you really gone
I sing you this song
Will you tell me
Where did we go wrong
I can't let go
I can't let go
Now I'm left here chasing echoes

Standing frozen in the memories
What you're taking is still lingering
Every promise
Every whispering 
In my head
In my head

In the shadow of my reverie
A distraction to forget the need
It's the truth to what I could see
In my head
In my head

Are you really gone
Are you moving on
Tell me tell me
Where did we go wrong
Are you really gone
I sing you this song
Will you tell me
Where did we go wrong
I can't let go
I can't let go
Now I'm left here chasing echoes

Chasing echoes
Chasing echoes
I can't let go
I can't let go

Like a photo
Like a second thought
Always silent
I just think a lot

I still wonder
Am I still stuck in your head
In your head

Are you really gone
Are you moving on
Tell me tell me
Where did we go wrong
Are you really gone
I sing you this song
Will you tell me
Where did we go wrong

Are you really gone
Are you moving on
Tell me tell me
Where did we go wrong
Are you really gone
I sing you this song
Will you tell me
Where did we go wrong
I can't let go
I can't let go
Now I'm left here chasing echoes
