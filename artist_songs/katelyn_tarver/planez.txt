Catch you rollin' through the city
Ridin' with the top off
Man, my wave's so big when you in it
Mess around to get lost
Tell my girl to let her hair down
What that shit cost?
Tell me, baby, if you're about that life right now,
I hope it ain't talk. No

I could put you in the mile high club, what's up?
Let's take a trip.
Have you ever read the world is yours
On a blimp?
Till it be free, baby spread your wings and your legs in sky like a plane, if you got that I'm the pilot.
Can't nobody see ya thirty thousand feet on your knees in the prudence make it like I can't be without it.
Get high, baby roll one. Tell him now not to go up.
Lovin' the feelin' the turbulence go when we turn up.
When we land, we can roll out. Show you somethin' you ain't know about.
Tonight we be takin' off like we got cameras to show out.

I got you in the air. Your body in the air
How we feel up here?
You can scream as loud you want. Loud as you can.
Ain't nobody gonna hear.
Would you like it better if I hit the west coast?
Tell me if you're about that life right now,
I hope it ain't talk. No

I could put you in the mile high club, what's up?
Let's take a trip.
