You're like a flashlight
All in my face I
Just wanna turn you off

Like all the other guys
You like my brown eyes
Told me like eleven times

I don't wanna know
What kind of car you drive
Sick of these county guys
Killing my summer nights
You think this is going well

I hate to tell you
But I don't think this is going your way
I hate to tell you
You're not the one that's leaving with me

You're like a sad song
When nothing's going wrong
Just wanna turn you down

Don't wanna hear about
What's in your bank account
Wish someone would help me out, yeah

Yeah, I don't really care
What kind of clothes you wear
Sick of these county guys
Killing my summer nights
You think this is going well

I hate to tell you
But I don't think this is going your way
I hate to tell you
You're not the one that's leaving with me

Mhm... you're not the one
Yeah, I don't wanna know
Sick of these county guys
Killing my summer nights
You think this is going well

I hate to tell you
But I don't think this is going your way
I hate to tell you
You're not the one that's leaving with me

I hate to tell you
But I don't think this is going your way
I hate to tell you
You're not the one that's leaving with me
