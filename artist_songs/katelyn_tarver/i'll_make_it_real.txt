On this path there are so many roads,
Many roads to choose from
A few seem pleasant but I know where they lead,
Their happiness is an illusion
As I wander around, and it reaches twilight
I will be all right if my light shines bright
I can see myself now, far along my path
Though I may be weary my life will be right

I have a dream of what I can be
I'll make it real, I'll make it real
Have faith in me, just wait and see
I'll make it real, I'll make it real

I won't change my face to hear them say, 
Hear them say 'I like you'
And I won't change my heart to hear anyone say,
Hear anyone say 'I love you'
As long as I stay true to myself
Everything will take care of itself
As I take a breath, and look to my future
I won't want to trade places with anyone else

I have a dream of what I can be
I'll make it real, I'll make it real
Have faith in me, just wait and see
I'll make it real, I'll make it real

My dream - I can make it real
My dream - true to what I feel
I won't be intimidated
I'll make a path to my destiny

I have a dream of what I can be
I'll make it real, I'll make it real
Have faith in me, just wait and see
I'll make it real, I'll make it real
