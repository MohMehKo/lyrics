I woke up wondering
Questioning
How'd this begin?
How'd things get so out of place?
Feels like we're keeping score
Everyday's like before
But we both losing this game

They'll be times we
Fight, they'll be tears
We cry but it's just you and I
On this road

So will you know
When to hold me
And not let me be lonely
When I won't let you in
And sometimes when I'm angry
Will you know how to face me
Put me together again

And even when I need space
And don't mean the words that I say
Please don't go too far away
So when it feels like we're breaking
Will you know how to hate me
And love me again

I know there's part of me
That handles things so stubbornly
When you don't see it my way
People know we're both to blame
And pointing fingers everyday
You know it's never gonna change

They'll be times we
Fight, they'll be tears
We cry but it's just you and I
On this road

So will you know
When to hold me
And not let me be lonely
When I won't let you in
And sometimes when I'm angry
Will you know how to face me
Put me together again

And even when I need space
And don't mean the words that I say
Please don't go too far away
So when it feels like we're breaking
Will you know how to hate me
And love me again

So will you know
When to hold me
And not let me be lonely
When I won't let you in
And sometimes when I'm angry
Will you know how to face me
Put me together again

And even when I need space
And don't mean the words that I say
Please don't go too far away
So when it feels like we're breaking
Will you know how to hate me
And love me again

So when it feels like we're breaking
Will you know how to hate me
And love me again
