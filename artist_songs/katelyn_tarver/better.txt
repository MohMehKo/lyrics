You don't call me enough
And I call you too much
You'll find this wasting time
And I'm always in a rush

Sometimes it's easy with you
And sometimes it's tough
But I'll never give you up
I guess I love you too much

Now I'm not so scared of forever
You'd like to stay sweeter
'Cos I know that you'll be there

Even when we don't have it together
We still have it better
We still have it better
With you it's always better, better, better, better

You make me believe in me
When I think I'm not enough
My tears fall easily
And you're there to catch them all

You see my crazy
Sometimes daily
And you still keep me around
Well I think it's safe to say that you've got me figured out

Now I'm not so scared of forever
You'd like to stay sweeter
'Cos I know that you'll be there

Even when we don't have it together
We still have it better
We still have it better
With you it doesn't matter where wind or wherever, yeah through any weather

Even when we don't have it together
We still have it better
We still have it better
With you it's always better, better, better, better

Now I'm not so scared of forever
You'd like to stay sweeter
'Cos I know that you'll be there

Even when we don't have it together
We still have it better
We still have it better
With you it doesn't matter where wind or wherever, yeah through any weather

You see my crazy
Sometimes daily
And you still keep me around
Well I think it's safe to say you got me figured out
