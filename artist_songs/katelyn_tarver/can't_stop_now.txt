I like to think I'm something of a mystery
I like to play hard to get me
I'm usually the one who takes the lead
But you're giving me a taste of my own medicine
It's making me feel dizzy

I'm a real tough girl but you're bringing me down
I put my defenses up but you're finding your way around
And I fought so hard but it started to feel good, so good
So you can't stop now

How did you turn the tables on me
Why am I confused I'm normally the centerpiece
This knight stripped me from my armor if this is karma
Boy I just can't wait to see what's coming around for me

I'm a real tough girl but you're bringing me down
I put my defenses up but you're finding your way around
And I fought so hard but it started to feel good, so good
So you can't stop

Now I surrender, you're in control
If you're gonna start me up
Then baby let's go

I'm a real tough girl but you're bringing me down
I put my defenses up but you're finding your way around
And I fought so hard but it started to feel good, so good

I'm a real tough girl but you're bringing me down
I put my defenses up but you're finding your way around
And I fought so hard but it started to feel good, so good
So you can't stop now
