I'm lookin forward not lookin back
I'm losin time not keepin track
I'm tryin to keep my heart in tack
I'm tryin to give what I gave back
I'm just a girl with crazy dreams
I see the sun and everything hold onto what I believe like lovin and me

It's good every thing will turn out like it should
I know that I'm gonna get a little bit right a little bit wrong
Still gonna sing my song it's good so good
Like it should be, oh like it should be

I see the world through brighter eyes
I find the beauty where it hides
I'm gonna keep that light alive
I'm gonna smile at the sky
I'm just a girl with crazy dreams
That never end up how they seem
I like that mystery of living trusting you and me

It's good, everything will turn out like it should
I know that I'm gonna get it a little bit right, a little bit wrong
Still I'm gonna sing my song It's good, so good
Like it should be.
Oh, like it should be.

It's good, everything will turn out like it should
I know that I'm gonna get it a little bit right, a little bit wrong
Still I'm gonna sing my song.
It's good, everything will turn out like it should
I know that I'm gonna get it a little bit right, a little bit wrong
Still I'm gonna sing my song,
It's good, so good
Like it should be, yeahhhh.
Oh, like it should be, ohhhh like it should be.
Oh, like it should be.
