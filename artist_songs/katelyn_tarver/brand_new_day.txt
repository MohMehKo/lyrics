Cause it's a brand new day aah
So come along with me
Are you going my way aah
It's time for you to see
It's a brand new day ahh
A new reality
And everything's okay aah
People come together

Sometimes you get turned around
What looks up comes falling down
Hear the voices in your head
Sometimes you can't even breathe
The feelings drops you to your knees
But it don't matter what they say

Cause it's a brand new day aah
So come along with me
Are you going my way aah
It's time for you to see
It's a brand new day ahh
A new reality
And everything's okay aah
People come together

I know you're tired and you're broke
And you're the punch line to a joke
You keep waiting for the end
And maybe you just got it wrong
Can't you see that you belong
You just need to find your way

Cause it's a brand new day aah
So come along with me
Are you going my way aah
It's time for you to see
It's a brand new day ahh
A new reality
And everything's okay aah
People come together

Don't give up
I know it's hard to see when you are down
You're not alone/you're not the only one
So let it go
Cause you will always find the answer
And the day has just begun

Cause it's a brand new day aah
So come along with me
Are you going my way aah
It's time for you to see
It's a brand new day ahh
A new reality
And everything's okay aah
People come together
