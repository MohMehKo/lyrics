Twenty-something, living easy, always time to waste
Boys out calling, girls out breezy, giving them a chase
Another jacket, no one in yet, feeling ten feet tall
Driving slow, my speakers blowing, lmfao

Oh, where does the time go?
Oh, where does the time go?

If I knew then, what I know now
But what do I know now?
What do I know now?
And all my friends, still hangin' around
But what do we know now?
What do we know now?

Little older, little colder, rough around the edge
Met somebody, calls me honey, still don't make my bed
Life don't always sparkle, but it's turning me to gold
Wo-oh, where does the time go?

If I knew then, what I know now
But what do I know now?
What do I know now?
And all my friends, still hangin' around
But what do we know now?
What do we know now?

Life don't always sparkle, but it's turning me to gold, oh
Where does the time go?

If I knew then, what I know now
But what do I know now?
What do I know now?
And all my friends, still hangin' around
But what do we know now?
What do we know now?
