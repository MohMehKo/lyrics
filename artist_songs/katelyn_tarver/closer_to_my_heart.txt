I called you on the phone and I left you a message
Told you everything I was feeling inside
Suddenly I wish you were right here beside me
Cause, baby, I'm feeling so lonely tonight
But there's no chance for romance
If you don't want wait for a slow dance
Up on that roller coaster

Baby, ahha
Everyday you get close to my heart
And it's making me crazy ahha
Cause every time I look over there you are

I never thought nobody could drive me so crazy
And if you say you love me I'll always be yours
You and me together is something I treasure
I know you're the one and it's worth waiting for
But there's no chance for romance
If you don't want wait for a slow dance
Cause I see for you and me
Up on that roller coaster

Baby, ahha
Everyday you get close to my heart
And it's making me crazy ahha
Cause every time I look over there you are

If this is how it's meant to be
Then take me in your arms, baby
Tell me I'm the only one
We will always be together
Cause I would never doubt something so real, baby
Love is all you make me feel, yeah yeah
