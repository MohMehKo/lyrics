Little bird up in the sky
Are you up there looking down on me
Feel so happy I could fly
(Cause) love has lifted me right off my feet
I never knew that it would be so sweet
Ever since you caught my eye
Something crazy has come over me (and)

I wanna be your everything
And I'm one step closer (yeah)
I wanna be your everything whoa oo oo

Little one I need to know
Are you real or is it just a dream
Everything you touch is gold
Everyday without you incomplete
Do you remember when we met that night
You were the only one that I could see
And I knew you would be mine
Find your love and it will set you free (and)

I wanna be your everything
And I'm one step closer (yeah)
I wanna be your everything whoa oo oo

And if you love me I will say
Sha la la la la la la la la la
We'll be together everyday
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah
Cause no one makes me feel this way

I wanna be your everything
And I'm one step closer (yeah)
I wanna be your everything whoa oo oo
