What do you get when you fall in love
A guy with a pin to burst your bubble
That's what you get for all your trouble
I'll never fall in love again 
I'll never fall in love again

What do you get when you kiss a guy 
You get enough germs to catch pneumonia
After you do he'll never phone you
I'll never fall in love again
I'll never fall in love again

Don't tell me what it's all about
Cuz I've been there and I'm glad I'm out 
Out of those chains those chains they bind you
That is why I'm here to remind you

What do you get when you fall in love
You only get lies and pain and sorrow
So for atleast until tomorrow
I'll never fall in love again
I'll never fall in love again

Cuz I've been there and I'm glad I'm out
Out of those chains, those chains, they bind you
That is why I'm here to remind you

What do you get when you give your heart
You get it all broken up and battered
That's what you get a heart that's shattered
I'll never fall in love again
I'll never fall in love again
I'll never fall in love agaaaain
