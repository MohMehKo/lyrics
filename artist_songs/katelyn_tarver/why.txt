You broke my heart 
You promised you never would leave me all alone waiting by the phone 
For your call to me 

I gave you my everything 
As perfect as two could be 
Now I just can't see, it was you and me 
Wondering where we'd gone 

Tell me why 
Do I cry at night, hold my pillow tight 
Over you and I 
No I can't deny 
What I feel inside 
Won't tell me the reason 
Won't show me a sign 
Tell me why 

I took a chance 
And you promised me romance 
Never thought I'd be, feeling lost and weak, what's come over me 
So now that you're gone (now that you're gone) 
Though it's hard to move on, time to say goodbye, there's no one more try 
Yeah, we're set and done 

Can you tell me why 
Do I cry at night, hold my pillow tight 
Over you and I 
No I can't deny 
What I feel inside 
Won't tell me the reason 
Won't show me a sign 

Can you tell me why you think that I won't get over you 
There's nothing holding me back from finding somebody new 
Can you tell me why, why, why 
Why, why, why 

Why 
Do I cry at night, hold my pillow tight 
Over you and I 
No I can't deny 
What I feel inside 
Won't tell me the reason 
Won't show me a sign 

Can you tell me why 
Do I cry at night, hold my pillow tight 
Over you and I 
No I can't deny 
What I feel inside 
Won't tell me the reason (the reason) 
Won't show me a sign 
Tell me why
