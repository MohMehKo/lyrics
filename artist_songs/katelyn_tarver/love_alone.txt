I told you my heart's leaning towards you, a little more than I knew something was scaring you.
Is it too much or too fast or too forward?
Should I step back and pretend I don't feel this way?
I don't wanna tell a lie, I don't wanna have to hide.

It's on the line I've waited for a sign,
I see it in your eyes, I, I know you really feel the same.
I need to know if I should raise or fold, my heart is stuck on hold,
I, I wanna know which way to go.
I can't love alone, I can't love alone.

I tried not to fall so far for you, now I can't get away from anything you say.
You make me feel nervous and stupid whenever I tell you I'm tired of playing games.
I don't wanna tell a lie, I don't wanna have to hide.

It's on the line I've waited for a sign,
I see it in your eyes, I, I know you really feel the same.
I need to know if I should raise or fold, my heart is stuck on hold,
I, I wanna know which way to go.
I can't love alone.

Oh, I can't stay here wonderin' if you want me.
If you don't take me, you should leave.

It's on the line I've waited for a sign,
I see it in your eyes, I, I know you really feel the same.
I need to know if I should raise or fold, my heart is stuck on hold
I, I wanna know which way to go.
I can't love alone,
I can't love alone,
I can't love alone.
