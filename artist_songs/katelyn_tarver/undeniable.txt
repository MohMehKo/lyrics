I don't know where you came from
I don't know how
You got underneath my skin, I can't get you out
Why can't I hang on to my senses
I try and I try but it makes no difference it's

Illogical, uncontrollable, impossible boy how can it be
What you do to me
It's so irresistible, unpredictable, unstoppable
And I can't help but fall
If this is what you call undeniable

Maybe I think too much I over analyze
My heart is feeling what my head wants to deny
What's done is done and I can't ever change it
I'm so far gone and I don't know how to explain it - it's so

Illogical, uncontrollable, impossible boy how can it be
What you do to me
It's so irresistible, unpredictable, unstoppable
And I can't help but fall
If this is what you call undeniable

The snow will fall in winter, the moon will pull the tide
Some things will never change so why even try

Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na

It's so
Illogical, uncontrollable, impossible boy how can it be
What you do to me
It's so irresistible, unpredictable, unstoppable
And I can't help but fall
If this is what you call undeniable

Illogical (na na na na na)
Uncontrollable (na na na na na)
Impossible (na na na na na)
(What you do to me) (Undeniable)
Irresistible (na na na na na)
Unpredictable (na na na na na)
Unstoppable (na na na na na)
