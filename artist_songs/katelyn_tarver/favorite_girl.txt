Hey you with the blue eyes, baby
Have you seen me here before
You got something they don't have
And I'm liking it more and more

And I try to let it go
But you keep me coming back
And I try not to let it show
Oh, oh, oh

I wanna be the one that you think of
When you're driving all alone
And you wish that you could call me on the phone
Just so that you can say, "Hey, you're my favorite, hey, you're my favorite girl."

I don't really fall like this
And never come so easily
But with one look, I'm hooked
And I can't move, baby now you're all I see

And I try to let it go
But you keep me coming back
And I try not to let it show
But oh, oh, oh

I wanna be the one that you think of
When you're driving all alone
And you wish that you could call me on the phone
Just so you can say, "Hey, you're my favorite, hey, you're my favorite girl."

So if i tell you now
Say it all out loud
Will you stick around
Or will I freak you out
Oh, please don't run away
Just wanna hear you say that you feel the same

Please don't run away
Just wanna hear you say
That you feel the same

I wanna be the one that you think of
When you're driving all alone
And you always wanna call me on the phone
Just so that you can say, "Hey, you're my favorite, hey, you're my favorite girl."

I wanna be the one that you think of
When you're driving all alone
And you wish that you could call me on the phone
Just so you can say, "Hey, you're my favorite, hey, you're my favorite girl."

Hey you with the blue eyes, baby
Have you seen me here before
You got something they don't have
And I'm liking it more and more
