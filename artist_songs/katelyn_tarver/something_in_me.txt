At the end of my street
That's where we all meet
Talk about nothin nowhere to go
You're into that scene
But inside I could scream
It's a desert where nothin can grow
I would stay here of I could
But I know it would do no good
Maybe someday you will understand

Something in me wants to reach with both hands
Go over the edge and see where I land
Something in me wants to know what's out there
It's something that I've gotta do
It's not you it's something in me

You're bathed in the light
Each night after night
Watching your life pass you by
I know you had your dreams
But now it just seems
You've settled for less why should I
I know you're scared that I'll get hurt
But don't you think it's so much worse
To give it up before you even try

Something in me wants to reach with both hands
Go over the edge and see where I land
Something in me wants to know what's out there
It's something that I've gotta do
It's not you it's something in me

If I listen to my voice
It leaves me no choice
I would stay here if I could
But I know it would do no good
Maybe someday you will understand

Something in me wants to reach with both hands
Go over the edge and see where I land
Something in me wants to know what's out there
It's something that I've gotta do
It's not you it's something in me
