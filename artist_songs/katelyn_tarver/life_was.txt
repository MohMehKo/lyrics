Life was so ordinary
Until you set my heart free
I'm everywhere you whisper to me
Just look around and you will see
You're broken unless you can bend
It's easy once you understand
That if you've given you will receive
A little faith is all you need

There is no love without love
There is no love without love
There is no love without love

There's always a choice that you make
And sometimes you feel your heart break
But if it's meant to be you will be
You'll answer your destiny
Life was so incomplete
Until you became part of me
I won't let go I won't slip away
Tomorrow's a brand new day
