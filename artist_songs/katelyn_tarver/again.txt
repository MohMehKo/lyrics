Are you what you say you are, do you mean the things you say 
Don't you think we've come too far to play this guessing game 
You tell me that we'd do if I don't worry anymore 
But I can't read between the lines 

So I'm thinking about what's really real 
And I'm wondering how you really feel 
Are we hanging on, or falling off the edge 

Cause again, and again 
What you said, man it's been running through my head 
And again, you pretend to be my everything 
My friends oughta know, that you're never sure 
That I'm losing you again 
Again and again and again 

You never tell me anything until it's way too late 
I'm guessing about what secret sins keep pulling you away 
Years of going round and round are never gonna last 
There's only so much lost and found and up and down before we crash  
So I'm thinking about what's really real 
And I'm wondering how you really feel 
Are we hanging on, or falling off the edge 

Cause again, and again 
What you said, man it's been running through my head 
And again, you pretend to be my everything 
My friends oughta know, that you're never sure 
That I'm losing you again 

You say that you love me like never before 
It's hard to believe with one foot out the door 
And I don't think I can take it anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore, again and again 
Again and again and again 

Again, and again, what you said, man it's been running through my head 
And again, you pretend to be my everything 
My friends oughta know (my friends oughta know), that you're never sure (that you're never sure) 
That I'm losing you 

'Cause again and again, what you said, man it's been running through my head 
And again, you pretend to be my everything 
My friends oughta know, that you're never sure 
That I'm losing you again
