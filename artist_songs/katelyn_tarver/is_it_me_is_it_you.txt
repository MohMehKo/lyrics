I remember the day we first met 
I fell so fast 
You made me feel like there was hope again 
Everything came so easily 
That spell you cast on me 
Had me going crazy spinning round and around 
And suddenly the fall stopped raining everyday 
Now I'm all confused I really hate feeling this way 

Is it me is it you 
Who I am, what you do 
Maybe I'm not sure but I'm so into you 
How I wish you could see 
Just how great things could be 
Is it me, is it you 

I finally heard from you again 
It's been a while 
And I feel you're pulling me back in 
You said that you've been missing me and 
I fall again so easily 
Today I'm all you need 
But then tomorrow comes and it's like you don't even know my name 
I try to play it cool but boy you're driving me insane 

Is it me is it you 
Who I am, what you do 
Maybe I'm not sure but I'm so into you 
How I wish you could see 
Just how great things could be 
Is it me, is it you 

Even though you make me crazy 
I still can't shake this feeling 
Can't you let me know 
Is it me is it you 
Will I ever know the truth 
And just when I let you go 
You say hello 

Is it me is it you 
Who I am, what you do 
Maybe I'm not sure but I'm so into you 
How I wish you could see 
Just how great things could be 
Is it me, is it you 

Is it me is it you 
Who I am, what you do 
Maybe I'm not sure but I'm so into you 
How I wish you could see 
Just how great things could be 
Is it me, is it you
