Sorta been a two way street
But you never walked my way
I gave you my everything
But you didn't do what you should've done
And left me halfway

So much for stickin it out 
Guess it doesn't matter now
No difference with or without

Cause I was 
never apart of you group so
I'm gonna push on through it
You think I'm missing out on you
But I'll show you what I can do

So thanks for giving up on me 
Turns out it's just what I needed
To be
A little more free

I never slowed my pace
Too scared of being erased
Can't be here running in place 
So you can keep it 
Hear this 
I don't need your name

Cause I was 
never apart of you group so
I'm gonna push on through it
You think I'm missing out on you
But I'll show you what I can do

So thanks for giving up on me 
Turns out it's just what I needed
To be
A little more free

You took me up and down 
You took me round and round
Yeah you made me dizzy Then
You let me hit the ground

So now I'm movin on
This ain't where I belong
Watch me now
I'll prove you all wrong

Never apart of you group so
I'm gonna push on through it
You think I'm missing out on you
But I'll show you what I can do

So thanks for giving up on me 
Turns out it's just what I needed
To be
A little more free

A little more free
A little more free

So Thanks for givin up on me
Turns out it's just what I needed
To be 
A little more free
