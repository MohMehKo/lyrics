Every single day
I wanna tell you how I feel
But I never get past the butterflies
And I just don't know if I can deal
Are you really into me
'cause I know I'm into you
But I don't wanna take another step
Until you say ya feel it too

It looks like rain
And that's alright with me
I'm standin here just lookin for the chance to
Make you see
Sometimes a little rain is all you need
So let it come and wash all over me

You can ask my friends
They'll say I'm talkin all the time
But whenever you try to say hello
I freeze and then you say goodbye
But I'm not tryin to be cool
It's just that I'm a little shy
And I wanna be straight with you tonight
Wanna tell you that you're the one I like

It looks like rain
And that's alright with me
I'm standin here just lookin for the chance to
Make you see
Sometimes a little rain is all you need
So let it come and wash all over me

Over and over
I try to get closer
But I always end up alone
I search for a sign
That you wanna be mine
But until then I'm takin it slow

It looks like rain
And that's alright with me
I'm standin here 
Just lookin for the chance to make you see
Sometimes a little rain is all you need
So let it come and wash all over me

It looks like rain
And that's alright with me
I'm standin here just lookin for the chance to
Make you see
Sometimes a little rain is all you need
So let it come and wash all over me

It looks like rain
And that's alright with me
I'm standin here just lookin for the chance to
Make you see
Sometimes a little rain is all you need
So let it come and wash all over me

It looks like rain
And that's alright with me
I'm standin here just lookin for the chance to
Make you see
Sometimes a little rain is all you need
So let it come and wash all over me
