We both know without a work 
We've got this chemistry
Like a man I don't settle for less than the best
Ain't afraid because I am willing to pass my test
So I'm watching you, wanting you, 
Hoping you're willing to do
What I need you to do, yeah!

Keep your eyes on the prize 
Keep you mind off alibis
Keep my heart satisfied and I'll make you mine
Keep your eyes on the prize 
Keep those tears from my eyes
Keep my love justified or I'll say bye-bye

Gonna say it - a guy stops playing
When he finds the one who's right for him
But only time will show the things I need to know
Before I let you in
Like a man I don't settle for less than the best
Ain't afraid because I am willing to pass my test
So I'm watching you, wanting you,
Hoping you're willing to do what I need you to do, oh!

Keep your eyes on the prize 
Keep you mind off alibis
Keep my heart satisfied and I'll make you mine
Keep your eyes on the prize 
Keep those tears from my eyes
Keep my love justified or I'll say bye-bye

Keep your eyes on the prize 
Keep you mind off alibis
Keep my heart satisfied and I'll make you mine
Keep your eyes on the prize 
Keep those tears from my eyes
Keep my love justified or I'll say bye-bye

The best things in life are worth waiting for
If you give me the time I can be sure
That everything I see can be mine
And I know what to do in the meantime

Keep your eyes on the prize 
Keep you mind off alibis
Keep my heart satisfied and I'll make you mine
Keep your eyes on the prize 
Keep those tears from my eyes
Keep my love justified or I'll say bye-bye

Keep your eyes on the prize 
Keep you mind off alibis
Keep my heart satisfied and I'll make you mine
Keep your eyes on the prize 
Keep those tears from my eyes
Keep my love justified or I'll say bye-bye

Keep your eyes on the prize 
Keep you mind off alibis
Keep my heart satisfied and I'll make you mine
Keep your eyes on the prize 
Keep those tears from my eyes
Keep my love justified or I'll say bye-bye
