A million points of  light ascending to the sky
monuments in darkness standing watch untill the sun will rise
screaming to an emptiness of how we deified ourselves
with our hands over our eyes, claiming all of creation
what inspires in us this madness that our existence should be defined
by a light that can't be seen by anyone?
what inspires in us this madness that our existence should be defined
by a light that we can't see?

A million points of  light ascending to the sky
monuments in darkness standing watch untill the sun will rise
I can't see this all as progress
how did we come this far when we see ourselves as deities
claiming nature for ourselves?
by our actions we betray the instincts in our race
by our blindness and stupidity we killed everything, we kill everything

Can someone see our self destruction?
are we reminding ourselves that our existence is so delicate
that without this light we are no more?
that without this light we've made we are no more

A million points of  light ascending to the sky
monuments in darkness standing watch untill the sun will rise
we torch the earth until it bleeds, rain ashes from the sky
just to make a light that no one can see 
we cut the earth until it bleeds, rain ashes from the sky
just to make a light. Just to make a light we kill everything
by our blindness and stupidity we kill everything

in 1000 years what will be our legacy a million lights that no one could see?
a million points of light
