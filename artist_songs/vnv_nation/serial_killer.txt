In a face a view, through eyes this world collides
I am voiceless in my angst
And nothing can take us back to innocence
Short, sharp, bloodlust reality
In despair I reach for night

In water purity reigns to be resolute
And as a land we clean our minds, reap our belongings
Sew our angers and our strengths
All too obsessed by weakness
We have brought ourselves to meaninglessness

So easy to control, bring to harm
A gathering of fools unjustified, on a mountain
And I collect my thoughts
And I rise above all that despises me

Comprehend the ways of man and under a flag
We salute or burn, there is blood on both shores
With hardened mind I traveled, with hardened mind I conquered 
A freedom so ironic, so despicable, so hypocritical

There is anger resolute
Rears its familiar head on the TV screen
In a dozen bags a life was placed
In a breath he smiled and waved

For five minutes at a time the power held true
And without consternation our laws are lost
Lost to butchers, lost to child killers, lost to narcotic ritual
Another tag, another headline
Another smiling photograph shall stay 10 winters long forever

And where are the angels to guard?
Where is the god of men and children?
He is stalking the minds of dark poor souls
And I know it's right, because I know it's time for freedom

To kill another and to kill another
And to kill another child of the flag
'Til there are none left... and another
And to kill another, and to kill another...

Gaze upon what you've become
And take a look at what you've done
You'll repent for what you've done
Raping my daughter, raping my son
