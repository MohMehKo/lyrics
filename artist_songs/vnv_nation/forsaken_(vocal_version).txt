When I have nothing left to feel
When I have nothing left to say
I'll just let this slip away

I feel these engines power down
I feel this heart begin to bleed
As I turn this burning page

Please forgive me if I bleed
Please forgive me if I breathe
I have words I need to say
Oh so very much to say

And whose life do I lead?
And whose blood do I bleed?
Whose air do I breathe?
With whose skin now do I feel?

I'm supposed to walk away from here
I'm supposed to walk away from here

(Help me.)

And whose life do I lead?
Whose blood do I bleed?
Whose air do I now breathe?
I'm convinced there's nothing more

The day you died I lost my way
The day you died I lost my mind

What am I supposed to do?
Is there something more?

The engines power down
Like a soldier to his end I go
Because I'm convinced
That there is nothing more

And whose life do I lead?
Whose air do I breathe?
With whose skin and whose blood do I feel?
What happens now?
Have I done something wrong?

Forgive my need to bleed right now
Please forgive my need to breathe
But I've so much to say
And it wouldn't matter anyway
You're not here to hear these words that I must say
And I'm convinced inside
That there is nothing more

Whose life do I lead?
Whose air do I breathe
Whose blood do I now bleed?
With whose skin now do I feel?

I have nothing left to say
I have nothing left to feel
Am I supposed to let this go now,
Let darkness come and take you away?

(If you're frightened of dying, and you're holding on
You'll see the devils are tearing your life away.
If you've made your peace, then the devils are really angels
Freeing you from the earth.)
