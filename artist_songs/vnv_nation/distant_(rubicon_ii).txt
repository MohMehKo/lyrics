The paths that I once tread have all but gone
Only embers now smoulder where bridges once burned
I feel alive and yet I fear what may happen now
I know I can't return

And I hear me say again, "Oh, let me not return."
Damn the illusions of redemption and the hopes that held me here
I will oppose all that would befall me, with this rage inside of me
I'll defy what I would become

The solitude and anger that do battle inside me
Will always guide me to the answers that I know I may not see
They are the bonds that hold me tighter, they are the chains that weigh on me
One day I know they will be gone

Can I start again and erase this pain
By casting doubts into the waters,
Asking judgement of the sea?
Though fortune may guide to the fools
I have no wish to be free
Until I am gone.
