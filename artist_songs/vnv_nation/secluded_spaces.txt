It seems so long ago now
That I was sitting here
Taking in everything
Taking in everything

I stopped to look around me
And as far as I could see
Across this precious land
Shadows painted by the sun

I don't think I remember
How long I waited there
Watching everything
Watching everything

My thoughts began to wander
And I then realised
Every moment I had lived
Everything that I had seen
Pass like this moment now
Pass like this moment now

As clear to me as now
Is the moment when I knew
That I can let it go
It's time to let it go
With it came the feeling
Strange I'd waited for it
I think all my life

A thousand words burst forward
From my very soul
I didn't feel alone
I didn't feel alone
I didn't feel alone
I didn't feel alone
