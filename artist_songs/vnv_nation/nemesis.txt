Everybody wants to live in a lie
But why should we delude ourselves?
It's not as if we can't see something's wrong
Where's the duty to what's right?
Intentions end with empty words
And chaos replaces order

Those who shout the loudest impose their will
Upholding laws that serve the few
Declaring peace while the sirens sing
In the name of progress, the name of madness
Drum beats faster, crowd shouts louder
And chaos replaces order

I want justice for the voice that can't be heard
Vindication for every suffering and hurt
Let retribution hold dominion over earth
Because Judgement Day's not coming
Judgement Day's not coming soon enough

Because Judgement Day's not coming
Judgement Day's not coming
Judgement Day's not coming
Judgement Day's not coming soon enough

I want justice for the voice that can't be heard
Vindication for every suffering and hurt
Let retribution hold dominion over earth
Because Judgement Day's not coming
Judgement Day's not coming

I want justice for the voice that can't be heard
Vindication for every suffering and hurt
Let retribution hold dominion over earth
Because Judgement Day's not coming
Judgement Day's not coming soon enough

Soon enough
