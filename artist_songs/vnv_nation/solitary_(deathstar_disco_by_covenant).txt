Set me aflame and cast me free.
Away, you wretched world of tethers.
Through the endless night and day
I have never wanted more.
Always thought that I would stand
Before the faceless name of justice.
Like some law unto myself,
Like a child of God again.

And if rain brings winds of change
Let it rain on us forever.
I have no doubt from what I've seen
That I have never wanted more.
With this line I'll mark the past
As a symbol of beginning.
I have no doubt from what I've seen
That I have never wanted more.

In this picture stands a man,
Far away, alone and distant.
Like a solitary field
In some nameless foreign land.
All around him points of light
Start to dim and cease transmitting.
Shadows fell on futile games
And then there was nothing more.

With a line I'll mark the past
As a symbol of beginning.
To the gods whose names we've lost
And the names who gave in vain.

And if rain brings winds of change
Let it rain on us forever.
I have no doubt from what I've seen
That I have never wanted more.
With this line I'll mark the past
As a symbol of beginning.
I have no doubt from what I've seen
That I have never wanted more.

Set me aflame and cast me free.
Away, you wretched world of tethers.
Through the endless night and day
I have never wanted more.
I always thought that I would stand
Before the faceless name of justice.
Like some law unto myself,
Like a child of God again.

And if rain brings winds of change
Let it rain on us forever.
I have no doubt from what I've seen
That I have never wanted more.
With this line I'll mark the past
As a symbol of beginning.
I have no doubt from what I've seen
That I have never wanted more.

And then there was nothing more.
