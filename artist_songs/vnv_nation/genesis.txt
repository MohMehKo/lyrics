Breathing in an air
Permeated, soaked in darkness
Emanating from within
Resonating like a scream no one can hear
I wear this chaos well
Though none should save me
Desperation keeps me here
My need for innocence, the place where I began
The abyss becomes me
I wear this chaos well

Are these not words of heresy
A venom on my lips, a poison?
My spirit impurified in everything I choose to say

With you, I stand in hope that God will save us from ourselves
Every cry a wasted moment, until another day is lost
Even lands we once called home lie undiscovered and unknown
Only heaven's silence for an answer
And did our laughter, did our tears have some purpose after all?
Did we toil in vain in hopes that wisdom came from what we'd done?
Even lands we once called home lie undiscovered and unknown
Only heaven's silence for an answer

Are these not words of heresy
A venom on my lips, a poison?
My spirit impurified with everything I choose to say

If I would shed my skin
The layers left, but not the lessons learned
Would not undo what I have done
Or grant forgiveness in some better days

With you, I stand in hope that God will save us from ourselves
Every cry a wasted moment, until another day is lost
Even lands we once called home lie undiscovered and unknown
Only heaven's silence for an answer
And did our laughter, did our tears have some purpose after all?
Did we toil in vain in hopes that wisdom came from what we'd done?
Even lands we once called home lie undiscovered and unknown
Only heaven's silence for an answer
