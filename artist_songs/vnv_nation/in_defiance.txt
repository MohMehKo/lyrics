I think back upon the person
I knew you to be
Righted the wrongs in the name
Of all you believed

The one who brought the fight
Who never said die
Never letting fate decide

Be all you hope for
you are the best you could be
All that in tribute of all
That you had achieved

No time for words
From those with nothing to say
Never letting fate decide

Unto the end and back again
Defiant to the last man
Until there is nothing left
to fight against
No surrender

Unto the corners of the Earth
Defiant to the last breath
Until there's none left standing
No surrender

Conjured the ground upon which
you've only stood
Buried the conflicts that had
Preyed on your mind

Those strengths in action
That only courage achieves
Never letting fate decide

Unto the end and back again
Defiant to the last man
Until there is nothing left
to fight against
No surrender

Unto the corners of the Earth
Defiant to the last breath
Until there's none left standing
No surrender
