Our domain, this kingdom come
Now godless lands whose ways are lost.
Without the strength to carry on.
All values lost, all virtue none.
Did you think you'd be saved
By burning flags to cleanse yourselves of shame?
Or are you afraid, are you afraid, 
As you stare back at your face?
Or are you ashamed, are you afraid,
By destroying what the gods once gave?
Do you think that you'll be saved?
Do you think that you'll be saved?

And I believe that we'll conceive
To make in hell for us a heaven.
A brave new world.
A promised land.
A fortitude of hearts and minds.
Until I see this kingdom's mine,
I'll turn the darkness into light.
I'll guide the blind.
My will be done until the day
I see our kingdom has been won.

No more the servants of the weak
Devoid of thought or light to seek.
I'll leave no walls, no stone unturned.
Every tower must be razed 
To the dust from which it came.
And none will be spared, no remnant saved.
And are you ashamed, are you afraid,
Of the gods and idols that you have made?
Do you think you'd be saved
By the gods and idols you have made?

None will be saved.
None will be saved.
None will be saved.

And I believe that we'll conceive
To make in hell for us a heaven.
A brave new world.
A promised land.
A fortitude of hearts and minds.
Until I see this kingdom's mine,
I'll turn the darkness into light.
I'll guide the blind.
My will be done until the day
I see our kingdom has been won.

Do you think that you'd be saved?
Do you think that you'd be saved?

None will...
None will...
None will be saved.

And I believe that we'll conceive
To make in hell for us a heaven.
A brave new world.
A promised land.
A fortitude of hearts and minds.
Until I see this kingdom's mine,
I'll turn the darkness into light.
I'll guide the blind.
My will be done until the day
I see our kingdom has been won.
