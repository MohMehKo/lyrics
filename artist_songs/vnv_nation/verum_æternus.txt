If you and I
Had been anything less
Than these tormented souls
We would never have gone so far
To become what we are

If you and I
Had never seen the world
Through the eyes of a child
We would never have wanted to stop time
Sleepers passing by

If you and I
Had been anything less
Than these disenfranchised minds
We would have looked the other way
As we passed each other by

And for the things I know
From the broken all I ask
Is to look beyond this place
Stop staring at the ground
Thinking only what went wrong

I know there are days
Too dark or hard to take
I hope you know
This is just one day you'll have to face
This is not the whole of your life

This is one day
This is one day
This is one day
One day
Out of all of your life

One day
Out of all of your life
