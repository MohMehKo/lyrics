Enveloped in a sentiment
A sound that rushes over me
Engage an impulse to pretend
I have a faith that's pure

You must not forget how to dream
Please indulging everything
Entertain the thoughts you have the strength
Of those you want to be
Cheers and tribute may greet your saviours
Still your reckless thoughts will survive
Anachronistic and impulsive
Did I tell you that I am anachronistic and impulsive?

And what will happen?
Will I dream?
I am too scared to close my eyes
For a second, please hold me
None can change in me these things that I believe
But I don't know what happens now
I am too scared to close my eyes
