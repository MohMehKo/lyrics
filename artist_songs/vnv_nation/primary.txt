Straight ahead, in lines, cannot deviate
Speed maintained at a constant pace
The limit pushed until the limits break
The senses sharp, no failures, no mistakes

The spark ignites
We're engaging our engines
Only first and best
There's no second place

I can't stop
It's too late
Leaning up, accelerating
Far from ground, the sense
That gravity's decreasing

No time for thought
Only rate of change
Can't impede the rush
Once the countdown begins
Strong as steel
Testing all configurations
Machine control
Fused and integrated

This is life
This is real
This is not a simulation
The wake, slipstream
Collide, disintegration

I can't stop
It's too late
Leaning up, accelerating
Far from ground, the sense
That gravity's decreasing

No air to breathe
There's no atmosphere around me
I can't think, I can't speak
My speed is still increasing

Contact lost, no means
No means of communication
Moving faster now
On course to destination

I can't stop
It's too late
Leaning up, accelerating
Far from ground, the sense
That gravity's decreasing

No air to breathe
There's no atmosphere around me
I can't think, I can't speak
My speed is still increasing
