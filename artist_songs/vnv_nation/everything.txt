Don't tell me it's the end of everything
It always seems the darkest before the light
So fragile and breaking apart
Finding solace in the knowledge of what's right
All that's holy, sacred and divine
Guarding over all within its sight

Embracing with all of your heart
Give me your body and your soul
In greatness take all in your stride
Lend your courage to the task, to the masses hope and pride

Don't tell me it's the end of everything
It always seems the darkest before the light

You're changing and biding your time
All the while you're praying you'll be saved
You're hiding your beautiful mind
Unaware of what it means to embrace it and defend

So don't tell me it's the end of everything
It always seems the darkest before the light

Don't tell me it's the end of everything
It always seems the darkest before the light
The glory in the epic of life
Comforting, ensuring it survives

And don't tell me it's the end of everything
It always seems the darkest before the light
Embracing with all of your heart
Give me your body and your soul
In greatness take all in your stride
Lend your courage to the task, to the masses hope and pride

Don't tell me it's the end of everything
It always seems the darkest before the light

It always seems the darkest before the light
