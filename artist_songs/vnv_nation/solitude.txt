Set me aflame and cast me free.
Away, you wretched world of tethers.
Through the endless night and day
I have never wanted more.
I always thought that I would stand
Before the faceless name of justice.
Like some law unto myself,
Like a child of God again.

And if rain brings winds of change
Let it rain on us forever.
I have no doubt from what I've seen
That I have never wanted more.
With this line I'll mark the past
As a symbol of beginning.
I have no doubt from what I've seen
That I have never wanted more.

With this line I'll mark the past
As a symbol of beginning.
I have no doubt from what I've seen
That I have never wanted more.

With this line I'll mark the past
As my symbol of beginning.
I have no doubt from what I've seen
That I have never wanted more.

I have never wanted more.
I have never wanted more.
I have never wanted more.

Set me aflame and cast me free.
Away, you wretched world of tethers.
By the light of what I've seen,
I have never wanted more.
