The carousel begins to slow
I’ll take my chances
So far removed I’ll fail to see
The recklessness I’ve shown
In all my words and deeds
The good in other souls
I never fail to see

Can you see the light
As far as the eyes can see
From this point above the world
Where mortals dare their destiny
As it radiates
May I witness open-eyed
Let me remain where there is light

In want of courage
It is as a shield for me
In want of hope
It reassures and carries me
As it radiates
May I witness open-eyed
Let me remain where there is light

Letting go was never easy
Risking all for what I wanted
Never needed
Deliberated whether I should
Serve the cause of greater things
As we moved worlds apart

Can you see the light
As far as the eyes can see
From this point above the world
Where mortals dare their destiny
As it radiates
May I witness open-eyed
Let me remain where there is light

The greatest words
Would still fail me now
These emotions I cannot describe
I want to be where
I don’t need to hide myself
And remain there
Until the end of time

The gods play games
With mortal hearts
As the carousel goes round
As I looked on
I saw the crowds who gathered
Walk away

Can you see the light
As far as the eyes can see
From this point above the world
Where mortals dare their destiny
As it radiates
May I witness open-eyed
Let me remain where there is light

In want of courage
It is as a shield for me
In want of hope
It reassures and carries me
As it radiates
May I witness open-eyed
Let me remain where there is light
