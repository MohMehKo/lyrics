I sat above them all and watched for days
I felt as though my own kind
Were all that mattered and kept me sane
I gathered them to me
Watched their hunted pass away
As if direction had finally come
A resurrection for all ourselves

I have never felt so proud
As I do now
Like the sun is placed behind me
Feelings that matter never end

One day we'll see our names
In stone where fires burn
The great who silent stood among you never
Praised nor never known
Our thoughts defined the passing days
Sensed the spirit, seized the age
After all these years to dream again
Like smiling children with faces raised
Cheering their path, tomorrow's glory days

And we who were so scorned
Will always wish to make their end
Our words to still their voice
Our hands to break their worthless necks

One day we'll see our names
In stone where fires burn
The great who silent stood among you
Never praised nor never known
Our thoughts defined the passing days
Sensed the spirit, seized the age
After all these years to dream again
Like smiling children with faces raised
Cheering their path, tomorrow's glory days

And we who were so scorned
Will always wish to make their end
Our words to still their voice
Our hands to break their worthless necks
