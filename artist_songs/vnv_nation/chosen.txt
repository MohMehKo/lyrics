Orders shouted in a strange guttural tongue that resounded 
along the walls of the houses, which seemed dead and deserted, 
while, behind the closed shutters, eyes watched the conquerors, 
who, by right of war, were now masters of the city and of the lives 
and fortunes of its people. 

In their darkened ruins the inhabitants have given way to the same 
feeling of panic which is aroused by natural cataclysms, those 
devastating upheavals of the Earth, against which wisdom and 
strength alike are of no avail. 

Though the same feeling is experienced wherever the established 
order of things is upset, when security ceases to exist, when all that 
was previously protected by the laws of man and nature is suddenly
placed at the mercy of brutal, unreasoning force. 

The earthquake, burying a whole people beneath the ruins of their 
houses, the river in spate, sweeping away the bodies of drowned 
peasants, together with the carcasses of cattle and rafters torn from 
roofs, and the victorious army slaughtering all who resist, making 
prisoners of the rest, looting by right of the sword, and thanking their
god to the sound of cannon. 

All these are terrifying scourges which undermine all our belief in 
eternal justice and all the trust we have been taught to place in divine
protection and human reason.
