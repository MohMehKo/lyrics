Lend me your deepest wisdom
Give me a sinner's chance
Learned spirits, won't you inspire?
Bear all my thoughts and wishes
To sacred places I'd reside
Where hope is born, where hope survives

Oh fallen lovers, won't you rise?
Fallen demons, won't you fight?
Your hearts were never made of stone

You who tempt the fates
You who've journeyed oh so far
To apparitions in the haze
Rise up you earthbound demons
Rise up before me now and fight
Your time has finally come

And take me back before the years
And memories are worn with time
Before the hourglass is drained
Before the colors start to fade
