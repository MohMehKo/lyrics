I long to feel my heart burned open wide, til nothing else remains, 
except the fires from which I came.
Like parted souls, divided for an age, awe and wonder I´d embrace, 
and the world anew again. 
But now, this picture from me fades. 
From still´s cold hand there´s no reprieve, light the fire in me.

Shine, shine your light on me.
Illuminate me, make me complete.
Lay me down, and wash this world from me.
Open the skies, and burn it all away. 
'Cause I've been waiting, all my life just waiting, 
for you to shine, shine your light on me.

I dreamed the world, with my eyes open.
But time moved on and then, new worlds begin again.
Oh my heart, in this universe so vast.
No moment was made to last, so light the fire in me.

Shine, shine your light on me.
Illuminate me, make me complete.
Please shine, shine your light on me.
No hesitation, make me complete.

Lay me down, and wash this world from me.
Open the skies, and burn it all away. 
'Cause I've been waiting, all my life just waiting, 
for you to shine, shine your light on me.
