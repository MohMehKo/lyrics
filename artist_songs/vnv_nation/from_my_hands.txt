So much I've thought
I'd have to say
Though I try to speak
My meaning strays
We can't avoid
The facts that brought us here
I've come to say goodbye

The lies I try
To tell with my own eyes
An act of pride
A wilful compromise
Please understand
How torn I am
When I walk away from here

I lament
The moments we won't share
If I am far too sentimental, I apologize
Please understand
This is who I am
And who'll I'll still be 
When I've walked away from here

You know I'm not unkind
When I say 
In the future 
The past is just the past
No going back 
No change of heart 
But this is now 
Time will not defer

My thoughts betray
So easily confess
How long I'll wait here
After you have gone
Nothing ends
But I won't believe that now
Please don't walk away from here

And when alone
When I remember days
Nothing will change 
A single fact of who you were to me
Oh come what may 
Forever to the end
I find it so hard to let you go

Hush now
Let it go now
There's no need 
For sad goodbyes

Hush now
Let it go now
I know it's time to go
Time to let this fall 
From my hands
