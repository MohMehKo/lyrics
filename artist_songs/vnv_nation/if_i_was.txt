The light of day is fading
To bid the darkness in
When empty smiles can never hide the hollowness within
My thoughts race by like the scene outside
Through the windows of the train
I could cover my eyes but never hide
From the promises I made

If I was a better man
Or a poor man or a king
Would I have the strength to start again
Walk the path that called to me
Somewhere out there waiting
Is a place where I'll know peace
Calling out and beckoning 
Be I a poor man or a king

The station long departed
My fate entrusted to the rails
No certain destination
Except the life I'll hope to make
But were the choice presented
Couldn't relinquish or bequeath
The walls I built around the truth 
I closely guard within

If I was a better man
Or a poor man or a king
Would I have the strength to start again
Walk the path that called to me
Somewhere out there waiting
Is a place where I'll know peace
Calling out and beckoning
Be I a poor man or a king

Give me your hand
Take your place here next to me
Let us walk this road together
No matter where it leads
Put aside your burdens
Put away your fears
Or I'll carry them as I'd carry you
Until the very end

Somewhere out there waiting
Is a place where we'd know peace
That calls to us
That beckons us
The place where we'd be free

Put aside your burdens
Put away your fears
I'd carry them as I'd carry you
'Till the very end

Put aside your burdens
Put away your fears
I'd carry them as I'd carry you
Until the very end

Somewhere out there waiting
Is a place where we'd know peace
Calling out and beckoning
A place where we'd be free
