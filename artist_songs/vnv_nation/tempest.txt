These are not words, they're only feelings
There are no sounds that you can hear
There is no form that you can touch
There are no colors for you to see

The only sound is a distant thunder
A tempest rages so far away from me
I walked for miles and I started running
Towards the sound and storm where you might find me
Towards the sound and storm where you might find me

And I ran until I had the feeling
That the tempest I had heard surrounded me
Here my heart so filled with loving
Cried out and told of wonders that I feel
Cried out and told of wonders that I feel

Here my heart is so filled with loving

And I tell myself, I keep repeating
That your ways are bringing you to me
And I tell myself, I keep repeating
That your ways are bringing you to me

And I tell myself, I keep repeating
That your ways are bringing you to me
That I will find my true salvation
That these ways of mine are bringing you to me

That I will find my true salvation
That these ways of mine are bringing you to me
I tell myself, I keep repeating
That your ways are bringing you to me
Are bringing you to me

Because here my heart, so filled with loving
Crying out the wonders that I feel
Here I will find my true salvation
And my ways are bringing you to me

I tell myself, I keep repeating
That your ways are bringing you to me
Bringing you to me
