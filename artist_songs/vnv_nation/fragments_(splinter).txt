See the faces etched in stone
The frozen faces of multitudes
The songs of youth that sing forever
Immortal thoughts of a myriad of souls
That echo forth and on forever and on forever
All great things to come onward now 
and on forever and onward now
All great things to come

Immortal thoughts of a myriad of souls
That echo forth like songs of a multitude
And on forever and on forever
Onward now and on forever and onward now
All great things to come

We few, we lucky few
Once more to the breach, dear friends, once more
All great things to come

The hall of ages to welcome them
The cheers of many
The cries of parting souls
The golden years
All great things, all great things
All great things to come

That echo forth and on forever
And onward now, onward forever
And onward now and on forever
Bravest thoughts of futures past
That echo forth and on forever
And onward now, all great things to come
Onward now, on forever, and onward now
All great things to come
