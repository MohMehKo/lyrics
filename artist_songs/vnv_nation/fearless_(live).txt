So many little things followed me
So many little things that bothered me. But I found my answer.
From all the chaos that followed me I have found my answer.
I've told you before don't follow me because I am not your answer.

I am not alone, I am not afraid, I am not unhappy.
These are the words I say to myself everyday.
I am not alone, I am not afraid, I am not unhappy.
Tell me what ritual I should have today.
But I'm not alone. I've resolved so many things and set myself free.

I am not alone, I am not afraid, I am not unhappy.
The words I say to myself every day.
I am not alone, I am not afraid, I am not unhappy.
Such a stupid ritual to have to say to myself everyday.
I'm not alone but I found my answer and set myself free. I'm not unhappy.

I'm not alone and I'm not unhappy.
Not alone and I'm not unhappy.
I'm not afraid and I'm not unhappy.

I'm not afraid. I'm not afraid.
I am not alone. I am not afraid. I am not unhappy.
These are the words I say to myself everyday.
I am not alone. I am not afraid. I am not unhappy. I'm not afraid.

I am not alone. I am not afraid. I'm not unhappy.
The words I say to myself everyday.
I am not alone. I am not afraid. I am not unhappy.
Such a stupid ritual to have to say to myself everyday.
I'm not alone but I found my answer and set myself free. I'm not unhappy.
