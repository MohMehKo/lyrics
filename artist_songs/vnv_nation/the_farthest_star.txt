The will to greatness clouds the mind
Consumes the senses, veils the signs
We each are meant to recognize
Redeeming graces cast aside
Enduring notions, new found promise
That the end will never come

We live in times when all seems lost
But time will come when we'll look back
Upon ourselves and on our failings

Embrace the void even closer still
Erase your doubts as you surrender everything

We possess the power
If this should start to fall apart
To mend divides
To change the world
To reach the farthest star
If we should stay silent
If fear should win our hearts
Our light will have long diminished
Before it reaches the farthest star

Wide awake in a world that sleeps
Enduring thoughts, enduring scenes
The knowledge of what is yet to come
From a time when all seems lost
From a dead man to a world
Without restraint, unafraid and free

We possess the power
If this should start to fall apart
To mend divides
To change the world
To reach the farthest star
If we should stay silent
If fear should win our hearts
Our light will have long diminished
Before it reaches the farthest star

If we fall and break
All the tears in the world cannot make
Us whole
Again

We possess the power
If this should start to fall apart
To mend divides
To change the world
To reach the farthest star
If we should stay silent
If fear should win our hearts
Our light will have long diminished
Before it reaches the farthest star
