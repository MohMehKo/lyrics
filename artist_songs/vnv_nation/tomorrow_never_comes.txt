Heaven help us, we've lost control
This should be our finest hour
But we're racing towards the end of days
Pulling back from the brink despite our best efforts
The volume increases and the beat goes on
All the players marching to a different drum
The rhythm of the war dance
The beat goes on

What will become of us?
If there's no one to watch over us?
If we should face the certainty of our destruction
Forfeiting everything
Pointless cries
futile dreams
There'll be no laughter
There'll be no tears
When tomorrow never comes

This isn't a game
Turn the safety off
Still we want more, so the beat gets faster
Everyone must play cause fame will find you
Put your face on the cover of a loaded magazine
We're proud of ourselves
Our greatest inventions, methods of killing, have reached perfection
All the players marching to a different drum
The rhythm of the war dance
And the beat goes on

What will become of us?
If there's no one to watch over us?
If we should face the certainty of our destruction
Forfeiting everything
Pointless cries
futile dreams
There'll be no laughter
There'll be no tears
When tomorrow never comes

As the warning sirens sound
And the world is at an end
Render unto night
Creations torn asunder
What will become of us?
Is there no one to watch over us?
There'll be no laughter
There'll be no tears
When tomorrow never comes
