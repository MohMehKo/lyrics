Show me the ways
give me the means
to pull away the veil of time
to find the path from which we strayed
to destinations far and wide
electric streets and railway lines
a line of stations to guide us home
the need for metal towers
machines of radiant design
they're silent witness to a golden age
glowing wireless
light the night
so we tuned ourselves away to the lonely songs of satellites
voices from distant cities tell
of empires conquered in our minds
and heroes of the world to come
take me back before the years
before the colors start to fade
a fraction of the grain of time
is all I need so you might understand
I would not falter
I would not hesitate
the generators never rest
turbines drive the onward march of time
onward and forward
to another day
engines of a forgotten time
electric streets and city lights
to the highways that will guide us home
a need for signal towers
machines of intricate design
they're silent witness to the golden age
glowing wireless
light the night
so we tuned ourselves away to the lonely songs of satellites
voices from distant cities tell
of empires conquered in our minds
and heroes of the world to come
take me back before the years
before the colors start to fade
