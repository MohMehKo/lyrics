Procrastinating, pretending to worry
Solving problems by pushing them aside
Wasting time like we've all the time in the world

Deliberation instead of solution, another term for blatant lies
Biding time like we've all the time in the world

And I'm not the only one who thinks we're trying to say
To the heavens and all who hear us: Behold all we have made!
We bring destruction, we bring war without an end
And then we live in hope that tomorrow never comes
That it never comes...

We conquer paradise just to burn it to the ground
And we build a future to honour pasts we've left behind
We bring destruction, we bring war without an end
And then we hope that tomorrow never comes
That it never comes...

The problems get worse before they get better
We find excuses to divert our eyes
Let tomorrow deal with what we could have done

And if you think we're the future, that we build tomorrow
When was the last day without a war?
We speak of greatness that we have never been

And I'm not the only one who thinks we're trying to say
To the heavens and all who hear us: Behold all we have made!
We bring destruction, we bring war without an end
And then we live in hope that tomorrow never comes
That it never comes...

We conquer paradise just to burn it to the ground
And we build a future to honour pasts we've left behind
We bring destruction, we bring war without an end
And then we hope that tomorrow never comes
That it never comes...

It's just you and me now
It's just you and me now
It's just you and me against the world

We conquer paradise just to burn it to the ground
And we build a future to honour pasts we've left behind
We bring destruction, we bring war without an end
And then we hope that tomorrow never comes
That it never comes...
