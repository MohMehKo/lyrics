The writing is set, are we ready out to play out the scene?
Discarding direction, instinctively playing the leads.
Cast in dangerous roles, cameos of us in our lives,
Try to  outshine the spotlights, lines we've improvised.

Precious lies, words that we say to ease our minds,
Hide our face behind a mask contrived,
Lose ourselves a thousand times inside.
This is where we draw the line,
There's nothing else to give but what you see,
Only sacrifice, blood, and tears.

To a flickering light, impressions unfold on the screen,
Silhouetted in half-truths, bathe in the glow of a silver dream.
Living life off the stage, tragedy to victory,
Shadows of past lives in the final scenes.

Precious lies, words that we say to ease our minds,
Hide our face behind a mask contrived,
Lose ourselves a thousand times inside.
This is where we draw the line,
There's nothing else to give but what you see,
Only sacrifice, blood, and tears.
