I have walked through the forest 
I have walked alone a long way 
But I just kept on going 
Picturing your smile so it wouldn’t fade away 
It won’t fade away...

I watched you seared, I felt your beauty 
I’ve seen your rack along the way 
But you just kept on going 
Holding on so tired so you wouldn’t sleep away 
You won’t sleep away…

Your era struck my heart 
And that is where it will stay 
My eyes are stinging as I feel you walking away 
What happen to you later?
Does it sound the same way? 
If you're lost, if you're lost, I will stay

We’ve lived through of life 
From all over tears 
That keeps come back down 
Build up from all these years
Your era struck my heart 
And that is where it will stay 
My eyes are staying as I see you walking away...

Your era struck my heart 
And that is where it will stay 
My eyes are stinging as I feel you walking away 
What happen to you later?
Does it sound the same way? 
(If you're lost, if you're lost) [X2]
I will stay, I will stay
