Reach for my hand
As you fall in the dark
Imprinted on me
You have left your mark
I wanna keep you safe
And run to where you are
Lost out in the sea
I will be your ark
I will be your ark...

Take the sky and take the land
Take the moon and the stars
It's all in your hands
All of my soul, it feels so empty
But this whole in my heart feels so heavy

It's you that shines the light
And all of this time
You are always with me
You're everything that's right
I know when you're scared
You're fighting to be brave
I wish that you could see
That it's you I'm trying to save
It's you I'm trying to save...

Take the sky and take the land
Take the moon and the stars
It's all in your hands
All of my soul, it feels so empty
But this whole in my heart feels so heavy

(Whoa, whoa)
Heavy (whoa, whoa)
Heavy (whoa, whoa)
Heavy (whoa, whoa)

Take the sky and take the land
Take the moon and the stars
It's all in your hands
All of my soul, it feels so empty
But this whole in my heart feels
This whole in my heart feels
This whole in my heart feels so heavy
