Trees breeze and they sway,
A bruised heart and kids play
it's all about you
it's all about you

The birds sleep and they sing
the wind blows, everything,
it's all about you
it's all about you

You're the broken one who wants to win,
when you're down and on your knees,
here is something that you can believe

When the world won't let you in
when your walls come closing in
when it feels like you can't win,
you've got me until the end

When it feels like you're alone,
and you can't find your way home
when you're outside looking in,
remember you've got me until the end

Weeks crash and days hush
a new life, a new rush
it's all about you
it's all about you

I scream and I see
I know everything about you
everything about you

When the world won't let you in
when your walls come closing in
when it feels like you can't win,
you've got me until the end

When it feels like you're alone,
and you can't find your way home
when you're outside looking in,
remember you've got me until the end

Like your first time in the dark
you held your breathe,
your pounding heart
I drift alone somewhere else

You keep talking to yourself,
I swear I heard you cry for help
it's you and me and nothing else

When the world won't let you in
when your walls come closing in
when it feels like you can't win,
you've got me until the end

When it feels like you're alone,
and you can't find your way home
when you're outside looking in,
remember you've got me until the end

When the world won't let you in
when your walls come closing in
when it feels like you can't win,
you've got me until the end
