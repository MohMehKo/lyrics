I remember the time when we were flying high
And nothing could bring us down

With the wind in our hair, no we didn't care about 
Falling to the ground

Those summer nights would call our names 
And we'd sneak on out the door

We'd lie in the grass under the over pass
Who could have asked for more

Looking back, we made those moments last
But our lives, how they go by so fast
Somethings I remember 
And somethings I forget
But one thing I want you to know 
Is that our love will never end
I've got no regrets, 
No regrets

We walked the path of our lives
And somethings are gone

Through the wind and the rain
And the fog and the haze
We're reminded where we come from

So we can let go
And go past in the sun

But hold onto those dreams 
This goes for everyone

Looking back, we made those moments last
But our lives, how they go by so fast
Somethings I remember 
And somethings I forget
But one thing I want you to know 
Is that our love will never end
I've got no regrets, 
No regrets

[Break:]

Looking back, we made those moments last
But our lives, how they go by so fast
Somethings I remember 
And somethings I forget
But one thing I want you to know 
Is that our love will never end
I've got no regrets, 
No regrets
