You know, you know what I've spoken
All that matters is forgotten
You know, you know what you cost me
You turned your back and now you lost me
You went to hide while she saves me

With the breath that she gave me
She touches from above
It comes from all the love
And it saves me, she saves me

I know, I know you're so sorry
Well, it's too late and it's too haunting
You know, you know, you know my story
Can't take it back, it's too daunting
And now you're running away

(While she saves me
With the breath that she gave me
She touches from above
It comes from all the love
And she saves me, she saves me) [X2]
And she saves me

You watched me fall, slowly fading
Slowly sinking, all the while I was thinking
You help me, now I'm on my feet
You're looking weak
You're such a cheat, you're such a cheat
It wasn't you, it was her that saved me

With the breath that she gave me
She touches from above
It comes from all the love
While she saves me, she saves me
While she saves me

With the breath that she gave me
She touches from above
It comes from all the love
While she saves me, she saves me
And she saves me...
