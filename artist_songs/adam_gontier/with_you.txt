Have you considered I'm just a nervous bird?
Or maybe wounded is a better word
It doesn't matter, it just really hurts
In all the chatter, your thoughts are always heard

I know the sound, your voice spins me 'round
As you whisper in my ear
I blink as you stare, you see I'm not scared
With you I can't be bare, with you I can't be bare

Have you noticed my pulse is revived?
You're like a temple, it's keeping me alive
But I'm the person who gave myself away
You brought me back, somehow you knew the way

I know the sound, your voice spins me 'round
As you whisper in my ear
I blink as you stare, you see I'm not scared
With you I can't be bare, with you I can't be bare

You know the sound, your voice spins me 'round
As you whisper in my ear
I blink as you stare, you see I'm not scared
With you I can't be bare, with you I can't be bare

But I know the sound, your voice spins me 'round
As you whisper in my ear
I blink as you stare, you see I'm not scared
With you I can't be bare, with you I can't be bare
