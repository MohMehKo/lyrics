Didn't you hear me when I said
I won't take it anymore
I won't be your mat lying on the floor
Do you miss me when you think of me lying all alone
Did you really think my heart is made of stone

It's the hurt we never wanted
What we wanted we never got
It's the missing that will kill you
Knowing that you've missed your shot

You know I heard you when you said
You can't take me anymore
So I tried to shut you out and I tried to close the door
There's something in here we cannot ignore
There's something in the air
Keeps us coming back for more

It's the hurt we never wanted
What we wanted we never got
It's the missing that will kill you
Knowing that you've missed your shot

And I don't wanna feel this again
We're running in circles
When will it end
Will it end

It's the hurt we never wanted
What we wanted we never got
And it's the missing that will kill you
Knowing that you've missed your shot
Knowing that you've missed your shot
We know that we've missed our shot
