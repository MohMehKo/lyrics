Guilt is the game that you play with yourself
Either betraying your conscience or blaming someone else 
Get defensive, aggressive or block out everyone 
but eventually you'll find the day will come 
When you find the answers to the way you are today 
The "why's" and the "who's" they don't matter anyway 

Blame your mother 
Blame your father 
Blame it all on me 
Or you can look in a mirror and see the reality 
That the guilt will make you crazy 
It'll make you live in fantasy 
We only have one life to live 
It's your time to change and make things right 
How will you sleep tonight? 

With a guilt lying beside you 
Holding your hand, whispering you lullabies in a dreaming head 
You are lying and you are growling, 
You're scaring of everyone and you're running for safety 
When you find the answers to the way you are today 
The "why's" and the "who's" they don't matter anyway 

Blame your mother 
Blame your father 
Blame it all on me 
Or you can look in a mirror and see the reality 
That the guilt will make you crazy 
It'll make you live in fantasy 
We only have one life to live 
It's your time to change and make things right 
How will you sleep tonight? 
How will you sleep tonight? 
How will you sleep tonight? 
How will you sleep tonight? 

Guilt is a game that you play with yourself 
Either betraying in your content 
So blaming someone else...
