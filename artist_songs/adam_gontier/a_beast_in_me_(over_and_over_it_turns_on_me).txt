Here we go again, it's madness
I swear I don't mean things I scream at you
This hate inside of me, it's sadness
I can't control the stupid things I do

Over and over and over again
It turns on me, it's a beast inside me
A beast in me that I don't even know

Here I go again, relentless
The mirror shows the red in my eyes
This human being I was once before
Is now a scary story filled with lies

Over and over and over again
It turns on me, it's a beast inside me
A beast in me that I don't even know

(The cages don't work
The chains don't hold me down
I'm digging my way through the past
And clawing at the ground) [x3]

The cages don't work
The chains don't hold me down
I'm digging my way through the past
And clawing out, clawing out

Over and over and over again
It turns on me, it's a beast inside me
A beast in me that I don't even know

Over and over and over again
It screams at me, it's a beast inside me
A beast in me that I cannot control

A beast in me, there's a beast in me
A beast in me
