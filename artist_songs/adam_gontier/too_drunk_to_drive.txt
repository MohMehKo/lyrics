You're too drunk to drive
But you came here anyway
You're lucky to be alive
I think that you should stay
All the love that I gave you
And all the promises that were made to you

I'm so glad that you came here
We could take this from the start
This long distance thing
Is tearing us apart
All that you gave me
Didn't come straight from you heart

You don't have to lie
I know what you said
Here's the knife
Stick it to your friends
All the love that I gave you
And all the promises that were made to you

I'm so glad that you came here
We could take this from the start
This long distance thing
Is tearing us apart
All that you gave me
Didn't come straight from you heart

Your too drunk to drive
But you came here anyway
Your lucky to be alive
I think that you should stay...
