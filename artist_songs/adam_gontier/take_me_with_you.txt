If I could just try to reach out from the dark
To put my dizzy head beside my heart
And if I could just lie in silence here for a while
I'd picture all the times you made me smile...

I want you to know...

That if you go, you'll take a piece of me
The world I know would be brought down to its knees
And a pain inside would be too much for me to bear
So if you have to leave,
Promise that you take me with you there

If we could just stop time from going so fast
We take the moments in and we make them last
And if we could just try to look back at our lives
Back when we were young and we felt so alive

I want you to know...

That if you go, you'll take a piece of me

The world I know would be brought down to its knees
And a pain inside would be too much for me to bear
So if you have to leave,
Promise that you take me...

I'll do my best to move on
Try my hardest to be strong
But I know you're always beside me
And every lonely road I walk on
Will hear me singing this song
'Cause it reminds me of you

If I could pretend
Pretend it's a dream
It's not as bad as it seems

If you go, you'll take a piece of me
The world I know would be brought down to its knees
And a pain inside would be too much for me to bear
So if you have to leave,
Promise that you take me...
And if you have to leave,
Promise that you take me with you there
