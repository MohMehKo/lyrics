There's threats in the truth, we deny it
We pray somehow, we can fight it
Oak trees with the breeze, yet still violent
Each time we hear cries, there is silence

We won't take life for granted
And we won't be afraid

We will never forget, and we will never let you down
When the moon lifts, and the sun sets, and the world spins around
All that I know, is that when we go, and our bodies touch the ground 
We are far beyond the clouds

What's worth all the rage and the envy?
A burden to cross, but it's so heavy
All the fear that we have has been filed
In the heart, in the mind, of a child

So don't take life for granted,
And never be afraid

We will never forget, and we will never let you down
When the moon lifts, and the sun sets, and the world spins around
All that I know, is that when we go, and our bodies touch the ground
We are far beyond the clouds

Remember when we climbed the trees?
Remember when we ran free?
Why is it that we can't see
What this life really means?

I know what really matters
Cause I've got my memories
And I know what really matters
Cause I've got my memories

We will never forget, and we will never let you down
When the moon lifts, and the sun sets, and the world spins around
All that I know, is that when we go, and our bodies touch the ground

When the moon lifts, and the sun sets, and the world spins around
All that I know, is that when we go, and our bodies touch the ground,
We are far beyond the clouds
We are far beyond the clouds
We are far beyond the clouds
