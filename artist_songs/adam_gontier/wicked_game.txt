The world was on fire and no one would save me but you
It's strange what desire will make foolish people do
And I'd never dreamed that I'd meet somebody like you
And I'd never dreamed that I'd knew somebody like you

No I don't wanna fall in love
No I don't wanna fall in love
With you
With you

What a wicked thing you played to make me feel this way
What a wicked thing to do to make me dream of you
What a wicked thing to say you never felt this way
What a wicked thing to do to make me dream of you

No I don't wanna fall in love
No I don't wanna fall in love
No I don't wanna fall in love
No I don't wanna fall in love
With you

The world was on fire and no one would save me but you
It's strange what desire will make foolish people do

No I don't wanna fall in love
No I don't wanna fall in love
No I don't wanna fall in love
No I don't wanna fall in love
With you
