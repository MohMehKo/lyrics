We were young souls 
On the junk-yard
Now we are stunned minds 
Full of junk-goods
But I feel your heartbeat
Just like mine 
I feel your heartbeat
All the time

And we were bound to the city life
Flashlights when we're falling into the night
Focused on what you feel
Just when you were calling her love that day

And we were bound to the city life
Flashlights when we're falling into the night
Focused on what you feel
Just when you were calling her love that day

We were young souls 
On the junk-yard
Now we are stunned minds 
Full of junk-goods
But I feel your heartbeat
Just like mine 
I feel your heartbeat
all the time

And we were bound to the city life
Flashlights when we're falling into the night
Focused on what you feel
Just when you were calling her love that day

And we were bound to the city life
Flashlights when we're falling into the night
Focused on what you feel
Just when you were calling her love that day
