After all that's been really tough for us
Trying to make it for you
Knowing that it could be the last, thing I've done for you
It's the end as a-a-always, confused
Spend my time, trying to read our past
Remembering that feeling

Don't fool, run away
'Cause there is someone who wants you to stay
Don't fool, run away
'Cause there is someone who wants you
Wants you to stay-eh-eh-yeah-eh-eh
Wants you to stay-eh-eh-yeah-eh-eh
Wants you to stay-eh-eh-yeah-eh-eh
Wants you to stay
Wants you to stay

After overcoming hour after hour
Ignoring all your demons
You'll collapse on the cover of your darkness
Strangling with feelings
Yes it is yes, but a-a-always confusing
Be the one that you always wanted to be
Can you really see then?

Don't fool, run away
'Cause there is someone who wants you to stay
Don't fool, run away
'Cause there is someone who wants you
Wants you to stay-eh-eh-yeah-eh-eh
Wants you to stay-eh-eh-yeah-eh-eh
Wants you to stay-eh-eh-yeah-eh-eh
Wants you to stay
Wants you to stay

Don't fool, run away
'Cause there is someone who wants you to stay
And don't fool, run away
'Cause there is someone who wants you
