I've never been running so far, so immense far, when will I fall into your arms?
I want to try to stand the pain, of my long-time-hurting feet
And what about you, you drunken soul, is that your own will to go?
On and on until I die, or are you going to give up now?

To give up now
To give up now
To give up now

I've never been so real, so immense real, when will I fall into your heart?
I want to try to stand the pain, of my long-time-hurting feet
And what about you, you drunken soul, is that your own will to go?
On and on until I die, or are you going to give up now?

I've never been running so far, so immense far, when will I fall into your arms?
I want to try to stand the pain, of my long-time-hurting feet
And what about you, you drunken soul, is that your own will to go?
On and on until I die, or are you going to give up now?

I've never been running so far, so immense far, when will I fall into your arms?
I want to break those certain rules, I want to dance the waltz with you
And what about you, you drunken soul, is that your own will to go?
On and on until I die, or are you going to give up now?

To give up now
To give up now
To give up now

I I've never run so re e e e e e e e e e e al
I I've never run so re e e e e e e e e e e al

I've never been so real, so immense real, when will I fall into your heart?
I want to try to stand the pain, of my long-time-hurting feet
And what about you, you drunken soul, is that your own will to go?
On and on until I die, or are you going to give up now?
