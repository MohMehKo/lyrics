They say that I'm 'bout to lose you tell me why
It's been a lot of confusion still we try
They say that I'm 'bout to lose you tell me why
It's been a lot of confusion still we try

Need to make some time
Who's to say, If I'm alright
And take another lie
Til they drop the common lie
Then how to tell a lie
Who's to blame for such a try
Want to make it right
With you, Just gotta hold me tight

They say that I'm about to lose you tell me why
It's been a lot of confusion still we try
They say that I'm about to lose you tell me why
It's been a lot of confusion still we try

Need to make some time
Who's to say, If I'm alright
And take another lie
Til they drop the common lie
Then how to tell a lie
Who's to blame for such a try
Want to make it right
With you, Just gotta hold me tight

We need to make some time
Running for the common lie
We need to make some time
Running for the common lie
We need to make some time
Running for the common lie
Running for the common lie
