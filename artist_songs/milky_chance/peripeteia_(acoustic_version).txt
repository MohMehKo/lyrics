Broken hearts made of stone, Did we lose our sensitivity?
You can find them all alone, watching flaming dreams go by
You're trying to catch the break of dawn, Blame it on your curiosity
So eternally, your inner dreams come back and out into the sun
Into the sun

Now we have a lot of love to give
But it's not with each to all the misery
I dream of a past that we could have
Feel like we made up so entirely
We have a lot of love to give
But it's not with each to all the misery
I dream of a past that we could have
Feel like we made up so entirely

You stick around, You got it bad but no one's out there you can listen to
It seems to be so hard to find the colorful state of mind
But still you're trying to catch it all, Blame it on your own philosophy
Eventually, your inner dreams come back and out into the sun
Into the sun

We have a lot of love to give
But it's not with each to all the misery
I dream of a past that we could have
Feel like we made up so entirely
We have a lot of love to give
It's not with each to all the misery
I dream of a past that we could have
Feel like we made up so entirely
Entirely
Entirely
Entirely
Entirely
