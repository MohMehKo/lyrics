Take me to loveland
And no one's gonna find me
Cause I'm leavin' this old place
I don't care

Nothing is too far
I handle that
Oh trust me
When we're leavin' this old place
I don't care

Like she has flowers in her hair
And you, have flowers in your mouth
'Cause your heart is upside down
And you get dizzy because of her charisma
She will love you like a twister
And you'll be swept away,
And you'll be swept away

Like we were so, so, so-o, so, so-o, so in love
Like we were so, so, so-o, so, so-o, so in love

Take me to loveland
And no one's gonna find me
Cause I'm leavin' this old place
I don't care

Nothing is too far
I handle that
Oh trust me
When we're leavin' this old place
I don't care

Like she has flowers in her hair
And you, have flowers in your mouth
'Cause your heart is upside down
And you get dizzy because of her charisma
She will love you like a twister
And you'll be swept away,
And you'll be swept away

Like we were so, so, so-o, so, so-o, so in love
Like we were so, so, so-o, so, so-o, so in love
Like we were so, so, so-o, so, so-o, so in love
Like we were so, so, so-o, so, so-o, so in love
