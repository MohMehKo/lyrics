You came up in my heart
Like the sun and the stars
Maybe I'll be the moon
So we can shine pretty soon
Then we drift through the night
When it's getting too cold
I notice you'll be around
Living stories you've told

There's nothing ever out there but some gathering clouds
I just wanna take care of you my love
There's nothing ever out there but some gathering clouds
I just wanna take care of you my love

Of you my love
Of you my love
Of you my love
Of you my love

And then she stuck in my head
Like a radiant rose
Make me dreaming away
Feels like getting too close
I just want you to stay
Just don't leave me alone
Many times I was wrong, But your truth loving is strong

It's not the ever of it, But some gathering clouds
I just wanna take care of you my love
It's not the ever of it, But some gathering clouds
I just wanna take care of you my love

Of you my love
Of you my love
Of you my love
Of you my love
Of you my love
Of you my love
Of you my love
Of you my love
