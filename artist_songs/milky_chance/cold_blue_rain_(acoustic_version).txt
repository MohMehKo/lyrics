Cold blue rain
I don't wanna think about it
Same old place
Makes me wanna think about it
See your face
Remembering that I'm mad about you
So I embrace all the things that you do

I know that we'll be forever
Forever together as one
And our hearts will share the same shelter
We share a place under the same sun
I know that we'll be forever
Forever together as one
And our hearts will share the same shelter
We share a place under the same sun

Ay! Yea-aay

Cold blue rain
I don't wanna think about it
Same old place
That I won't ever want to leave
Feel your face
Knowing that I'm mad about you
So I embrace you
Make me feel like my dreams come true

I know that we'll be forever
Forever together as one
And our hearts will share the same shelter
We share a place under the same sun
I know that we'll be forever
Forever together as one
And our hearts will share the same shelter
We share a place under the same sun

Yea-aay, yeah

Under the same sun
Under the same sun
Under the same sun
Under the same sun

Under the same sun
Under the same sun
