Cold blue rain
I don't wanna think about it
Same old place
Makes me wanna think about it
See your face
Remembering that I'm mad about you
So I embrace all the things that you do

I know that we'll be forever
Forever together as one
Our hearts will share the same shelter
We share a place under the same sun
I know that we'll be forever
Forever together as one
Our hearts will share the same shelter
We share a place under the same sun

My heart is running for your love
My heart is running for your love
My heart is running for your love
My heart
My heart is running for your love
My heart is running for your love
My heart is running for your love

Cold blue rain
Standing right in front of me
Same old place
That I won't ever want to leave
Feel your face
Knowing that I'm mad about you
So I embrace you
You make me feel like my dreams come true

I know that we'll be forever
Forever together as one
Our hearts will share the same shelter
We share a place under the same sun
I know that we'll be forever
Forever together as one
Our hearts will share the same shelter
We share a place under the same sun

(Yeah
Under...)

My heart is running for your love
My heart is running for your love
My heart is running for your love
My heart
My heart is running for your love
My heart is running for your love
My heart is running for your love
My heart
