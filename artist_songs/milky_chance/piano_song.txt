I want you to sit me down
Let it go, Just wasting come
I was listening to the crooked sound
Of a life that was way too loud
You're asking me, I don't ever crow
I'm just trying to turn it into the blue
Is it something that we have to found
Out of nothing on a fragile ground
Out of nothing on a fragile ground

Have you ever seen, How far it is
To the place where we oughta dream
Can you better hear the storming folks
Whispering in fear, roars the most
Have you ever seen, How far it is
To the place where we oughta dream
Can you better hear the storming folks
Whispering in fear, roars the most

I want you to lock that door
That has always made you want to move
Will you ever find a way out there
Returning to the room we used to share
You're asking me, I don't ever crow
I was trying to turn myself into you
Is it something that we have to found
Out of nothing on a fragile ground
Out of nothing on a fragile ground

Have you ever seen, How far it is
To the place where we oughta dream
Can you better hear the storming folks
Whispering in fear, roars the most
Have you ever seen, How far it is
To the place where we oughta dream
Can you better hear the storming folks
Whispering in fear, roars the most
