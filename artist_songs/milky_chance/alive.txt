Think they saw us to share the school
Something we need to look every on
But that is made up past the moon
Fit in the numb for our love
Then you do your thing aside
Promise at least I get in steady
All that I want is that you found
Something that makes you stop believing

I felt my love for you this time
Other side, I'm feeling so alive
You didn't feel anything at all
After all, Makes me feeling small
I felt my love for you this time
Other side, I'm feeling so alive
You didn't feel anything at all
After all, Makes me feeling small

Plenty of time we need to grow
Let's take the truth and slow it down
There's a lot of love we have to show
Maybe it's something faking out
Many times we were in trouble
I can't deny that I have made some
But in the end there's things to know
That I was stressed, rushing and breathing

I felt my love for you this time
Other side, I'm feeling so alive
You didn't feel anything at all
After all, Makes me feeling small
I felt my love for you this time
Other side, I'm feeling so alive
You didn't feel anything at all
After all, Makes me feeling small
