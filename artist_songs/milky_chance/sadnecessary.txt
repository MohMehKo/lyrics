Mirror, mirror,
Who's the happiest
Is it the lover or is it the beloved
And mirror, mirror,
Can I blame you for this
When heartbreakers came around

You shot my heart
Like a bullet all alone
No when you leave me
Just carry me slow home

Mirror, mirror,
Can I blame you for this
When heartbreakers came around

Sadnecessary is what you promise me
All I can do is to follow the tears
Deep down the hollow is what you promise me
All I can do is to follow

Sadnecessary is what you promise me
All I can do is to follow the tears
Deep down the hollow is what you promise me
All I can do is to follow

Mirror, mirror,
Who's the happiest
Is it the lover or is it the beloved
And mirror, mirror,
Can I blame you for this
When heartbreakers came around

You shot my heart
Like a bullet all alone
When you leave me
Just carry me slow home

Mirror, mirror,
Can I blame you for this
When heartbreakers came around

Sadnecessary is what you promise me
All I can do is to follow the tears
Deep down the hollow is what you promise me
All I can do is to follow

Sadnecessary is what you promise me
All I can do is to follow the tears
Deep down the hollow is what you promise me
All I can do is to follow

Uuuhh [repeats]
