Nevermind when the birds ain't flying
and those heavy clouds just standing still
'Cause it's you filling up the wind 

Nevermind when the crocodiles 
don't let you walk along the riverside 
'Cause it's you leaving that stupid fight 

Nevermind when those birds don't fly
and them heavy clouds just standing still
'Cause it's you living that stupid dream 

Nevermind when those crocodiles 
don't let you walk along the riverside 
'Cause it's you leaving that stupid fight 

My ego is dying in this cold century
Don't let me fall into the riverstorm 
My ego is dying in this cold century
Don't let me fall into the riverstorm

Please let you open these days
Mama said, oh please let you open 
Please let you open these days

Mama said, oh please let you open

Mama said, oh please let you open 
Please let you open these days
