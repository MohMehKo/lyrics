[Milky Chance:]
Getting through to you
Is what I'm aiming for
Won't you hear me now
Like you've done before

Are we going round in circles
Are we running out of time, Are we
Are we losing something precious
Are we hanging onto something special
I think so

[Milky Chance & Izzy Bizu:]
'Cause when you're conquering
My day and night
Easing, The pain inside
Got me laughing, All of the time
Keep the bad things out of my mind
Out of my mind

[Izzy Bizu:]
Eyes caressing my skin
Undressing my every flaw
Ooh will we sink or swim
We're blinded on an empty shore

[Milky Chance & Izzy Bizu:]
Are we going round in circles
Are we running out of time, are we
Are we losing something precious
Are we hanging onto something special
I think so

[Milky Chance & Izzy Bizu:]
'Cause when you're conquering
My day and night
Easing, The pain inside
Got me laughing, All of the time
Keep the bad things out of my mind
Out of my mind

[Izzy Bizu:]
I don't mind wasting time
Let's stop and smell the roses
I don't mind wasting time
Let's stop and smell the roses
Ooh, How I know the odds are set high
As ever need to hang me out to dry
Ooh help me please my hands are tied
Don't have the courage just to tell you goodbye

'Cause when you're conquering
My day and night
Easing
The pain inside
Got me laughing
All of the time
Keep the bad things out of my mind

(Out of my mind)

[Milky Chance & Izzy Bizu:]
'Cause when you're conquering
My day and night
Easing, The pain inside
Got me laughing
All of the time
Keep the bad things out of my mind
Out of my mind
'Cause when you're conquering
My day and night
Easing, The pain inside
Got me laughing, All of the time
Keep the bad things out of my mind
Out of my mind

[Izzy Bizu:]
I don't mind wasting time
Let's stop and smell the roses
I don't mind wasting time
Let's stop and smell the roses
