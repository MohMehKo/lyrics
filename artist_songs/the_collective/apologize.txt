I'm holdin' on your rope,
Got me ten feet off the ground.
And I'm hearin' what you say,
But I just can't make a sound.
You tell me that you need me,
Then you go and cut me down,
But wait...
You tell me that you're sorry,
Didn't think I'd turn around,
And say...

That it's too late to apologize.
It's too late.
I said it's too late to apologize.
It's too late.
It's too late to apologize.
Yeah!

I'd take another chance,
Take a fall, take a shot for you.
I need you like a heart needs the beat,
It's nothin' new.
Yeah, yeah
I loved you with a fire red,
Now it's turnin' blue,
And you say...
Sorry, like an angel
Heaven let me think was you...
But I'm afraid...

It's too late to apologize.
It's too late.
I said it's too late to apologize.
It's too late.
It's too late to apologize.
Yeah!
It's too late to apologize.
Yeah!

It's too late to apologize.
It's too late.
I said it's too late to apologize.
It's too late.
It's too late to apologize.
Yeah!
It's too late to apologize.
Yeah!
It's too late to apologize.
Yeah!
It's too late to apologize.
Yeah!

I'm holdin' on your rope,
Got me ten feet off the ground.
