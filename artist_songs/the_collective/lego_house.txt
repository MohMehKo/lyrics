I'm gonna pick up the pieces,
And build a Lego house
When things go wrong
We can knock it down

My three words have two meanings,
There's one thing on my mind
It's all for you

And it's dark in a cold December,
But I've got ya to keep me warm
If you're broken I'll mend ya
Gonna keep you sheltered
From the storm that's raging on

I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now

I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you any time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now

I'm gonna paint you by numbers
And colour you in
If things go right we can frame it,
And put you on a wall

And it's so hard to say it
But I've been here before
And I'll surrender up my heart
And swap it for yours

I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now

I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you any time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now

Don't hold me down
I think these braces are breaking
And it's more than I can take

And it's dark in a cold December,
But I've got ya to keep me warm (keep me warm)
If you're broken I'll mend ya
Gonna keep you sheltered
From the storm that's raging on

I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now

I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you any time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now

I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now

I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you any time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
