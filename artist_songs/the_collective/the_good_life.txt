I wanna give you the good life! 

Just hold my hand and close your eyes
I'm gonna take you for a ride
Baby we're going somewhere new
Our future looks so clear tonight
No stars reflecting in your eyes
Wish I could capture it for you

I'll be right by your side through the lows, through the highs
If you trust me I'll show you the place as I know

I wanna give you the good life
Woah oh oh, woah oh oh
Let's fly around, see every city in one night
Woah oh oh, woah oh oh
I'll change the world, I wanna give you the good life, yeah
Gotta leave this town
I wanna give you the good life
The good life, the good life

Just spin the globe and close your eyes
There's not a place to fall and fly
Take off and cross the ocean blue
Even a million metres high
Some baggage never leaves your side
Just like I won't be leaving you

I'll be right by your side through the lows, through the highs
If you trust me I'll show you the place as I know

I wanna give you the good life
Woah oh oh, woah oh oh
Let's fly around, see every city in one night
Woah oh oh, woah oh oh
I'll change the world, I wanna give you the good life, yeah
Gotta leave this town
I wanna give you the good life
The good life, the good life

Let's take every street
We'll see everything
All I need here is you
Baby come with me
What will be will be
I'll do all I can do

Miss Independent can we talk for a minute
I gotta let you know all these feelings that I'm feeling
Your smile just got me reeling
Forgive me in advance for the time that I'm stealing
I just wanna be your hero I could never be a villain
You're thrilling and every side of you is undefinable 
You make me skip a line or two like double dutch is what I do, show
Girl, the good life is calling
I'm all for your falling in love

I wanna give you the good life
Woah oh oh, woah oh oh
Let's fly around, see every city in one night
Woah oh oh, woah oh oh
I'll change the world I wanna give you the good life, yeah
Gotta leave this town
I wanna give you the good life
the good life, the good life

Let's take every street 
We'll see everything
All I need here is you
Baby come with me
What will be will be
I'll do all I can do

I wanna give you the good life
