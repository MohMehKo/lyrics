[VERSE 1]
This one's for those, those who fall in love, yeah.
This one's for who knows what it does when you get your heart torn into pieces 'cause the one you want won't give you a reason why.

[PRE-CHORUS]
She's out there playing with your heart, won't give it back, no.
You can't move on; she comes, she goes - that gives you more hope. 
She sees you tryin' just to get by and then she finally says no.

[CHORUS]
Maybe I was mistaken when your lips got closer to mine.
Thought that you were my angel, but you slipped through my fingers tonight.
Baby, I thought I'd seen the light,
Thought I had this right,
Everything aligned...
Everything but you, baby.
We didn't really make it this time -
Maybe in another life.

[VERSE 2]
I guess you thought you'd have a little fun,
And I guess I was never really number one.
But they say you don't know what you're missing, no
Till that day comes when you lose what you needed.

[PRE-CHORUS]
She's out there playing with your heart, won't give it back, no.
You can't move on, she comes, she goes, that gives you more hope. 
She sees you tryin' just to get by and then she finally says no.

[CHORUS]
Maybe I was mistaken when your lips got closer to mine. 
Thought that you were my angel, but you slipped through my fingers tonight.
Baby, I thought I'd seen the light,
Thought I had this right,
Everything aligned...
Everything but you, baby.
We didn't really make it this time -
Maybe in another life.

[BRIDGE]
Sometimes the one you love can really make you go insane.
Sometimes the feeling's right, but she will throw your heart away.

[CHORUS]
Maybe I was mistaken when your lips got closer to mine. 
Thought that you were my angel, but you slipped through my fingers tonight.
Baby, I thought I'd seen the light,
Thought I had this right,
Everything aligned...
Everything but you, baby.
We didn't really make it this time -
Maybe in another life.

In another life
Another life
Maybe, maybe in another life
Maybe in another life
