Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
The right stuff

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
The right stuff

First time was a great time
Second time was a blast
Third time I fell in love
Now I hope it lasts

I can see it in your walk
Tell it when you talk
See it in everything you do
Even in your thoughts

You got the right stuff, baby
Love the way you turn me on
You got the right stuff, baby
You're the reason why I sing this song

All that I needed was you
Oh girl, so right (so right)
All that I wanted was you
You made all…
My dreams come true

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
The right stuff

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
The right stuff

Your first kiss was a sweet kiss
Second kiss had a twist
Third and your fourth kiss
I don't wanna miss

I can see it in your walk
Tell it when you talk
See it in everything you do
Even in your thoughts

You got the right stuff, baby
I love the way you turn me on
You got the right stuff, baby
You're the reason why I sing this song

All that I needed was you
Oh girl, so right (so right)
All that I wanted was you
You made all…
My dreams come true

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
The right stuff

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
The right stuff

People always told me be careful what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
She came and stood right by me
I could smell her sweet perfume
This happened way too soon
She called me to her room

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
No no no, no no no

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
