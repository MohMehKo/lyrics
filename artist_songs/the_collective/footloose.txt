I've been working so hard (so hard)
I'm punching my card (my card)
Eight hours for what?
Oh, tell me what I got

I got this feeling,
That time's just holding me down (holding me down)
I'll hit the ceiling
Or else I'll tear up this town

Tonight I'm gonna cut loose, footloose
Kick off the Sunday shoes
Please, Louise, pull me off a my knees
Jack, get back, c'mon before we crack
Lose your blues, everybody cut footloose

You're playing so cool (so cool)
Obeying every rule
I dig a way down in your heart
You're burning, yearning for some

Somebody to tell you
That life ain't passing you by
I'm trying to tell you
It will if you don't even try

Tonight I'm gonna cut loose, footloose
Kick off the Sunday shoes
Oowhee, Marie, shake it, shake it for me
Whoa, Milo, c'mon, c'mon let's go
Lose your blues, everybody cut footloose

DJ break it down on the 1's and 2's
We hit the floor two-steppin' to this new age groove
Straight fitted skinny jeans boogie shoes are a must
Trust them all white Nikes, can't nobody touch us uh
Gimme the rhythm I'll flow, I'm the brother who steals the show
Can't nobody stop when I get into my zone
Keep it fresh all day got one thing to say
DJ let it play, causeï»¿ we came to party, okay!

We got to turn you around
And put your feet on the ground
Now take a hold of your soul
I'm turning it loose

Loose, footloose, kick off your Sunday shoes
Please, Louise pull me off a my knees
Jack, get back, c'mon before we crack
Lose your blues, everybody cut footloose
Footloose kick off your Sunday shoes
Please, Louise, pull me off a my knees
Jack, get back, c'mon before we crack
Lose your blues
Everybody cut, everybody cut
Everybody cut, everybody cut
Everybody cut, everybody cut
Everybody, everybody cut footloose
