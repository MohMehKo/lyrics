Life is a mystery,
Everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

I hear your voice, it's like an angel sighing
I have no choice, I hear your voice
Feels like flying
I close my eyes, oh God I think I'm falling
Out of the sky, I close my eyes
Heaven help me

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

Like a child, you whisper softly to me
You're in control just like a child
Now I'm dancing
It's like a dream, no end and no beginning
You're here with me, it's like a dream
Let the choir sing

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

I'm calling out, baby are you there?
Let your love rain down, answer my prayers,
She's my fallen angel, I'll fix these broken wings,
Bring you to your feet, so you can fight for me my everything,
Walk with me by my side, keep my head up high,
Sometimes I need you here to wipe these tears fromï»¿ my eyes,
And I promise I'll never leave, keep my heart up on yo sleeve,
Girl I say a little prayer every night before I sleep.

Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me
