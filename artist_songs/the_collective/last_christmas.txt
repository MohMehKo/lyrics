Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance but you still catch my eye
Tell me baby do you recognize me
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me

Merry Christmas, I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying "I love you", I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kiss me now, I know you'd fool me again

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Surrounded by love and never felt so alone
The memories of us hold me all year long
I know I put you through it, something I never meant
But you cannot regret all the time that we spent
Christmas is here, the season of giving
But I'm only living half of life with you missin'
I thought you'd be here when the lights went down
But when the dark came round
You couldn't be found

A crowded room, friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God I thought you were someone to rely on
Me, I guess I was a shoulder to cry on

A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man undercover but you tore him apart
Whoa no…
Now I've found a real love
You'll never fool me again

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man undercover but you tore him apart
Oh, next year…
I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone special

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
