Ooh baby, I'm feeling sexy and free
Like glitter's raining on me
You're like a shot of pure gold
I think I'm 'bout to explode

I can taste the tension like a cloud of smoke in the air
Now I'm breathing like I'm running cause you're taking me there
Don't you know…
You spin me out of control

(Ooh ooh ooh ooh)
We can do this all night
Make this love so skin tight
Baby come on
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh)
Boomin' like a bass drum
Sparkin' up a rhythm
Baby, come on!
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh)

Rock my world until the sunlight
Make this dream the best I've ever known
Dirty dancing in the moonlight
Take me down like I'm a domino
Every second is a highlight
When we touch don't ever let me go
Dirty dancing in the moonlight
Take me down like I'm a domino

You got me losing my mind
My heart beats out of time
I'm seeing Hollywood stars
You strum me like a guitar

I can taste the tension like a cloud of smoke in the air
Now I'm breathing like I'm running cause you're taking me there
Don't you know…
You spin me out of control

(Ooh ooh ooh ooh)
We can do this all night
Make this love so skin tight
Baby come on
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh)
Boomin' like a bass drum
Sparkin' up a rhythm
Baby, come on
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh)

Rock my world until the sunlight
Make this dream the best I've ever known
Dirty dancing in the moonlight
Take me down like I'm a domino
Every second is a highlight
When we touch don't ever let me go
Dirty dancing in the moonlight
Take me down like I'm a domino

Ooh baby baby, ooh baby baby
Ooh baby baby, dancing in the moonlight
Ooh baby baby, ooh baby baby
Ooh baby baby, dancing in the moonlight

They try to break us down but we get back up,
The reason I breathe is because of our love
They push and they shove but baby just trust
The feelings that we share will always be enough
The first time I fell was in love so electric
Connected the first time I spoke with perfection
Arrested my heart, never had another chance
I fell like a domino into your hands

Rock my world until the sunlight
Make this dream the best I've ever known
Dirty dancing in the moonlight
Take me down like I'm a domino
Take me down like I'm a domino
