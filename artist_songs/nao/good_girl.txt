He wanted a good girl
I wanted a god
And lights never change
We're anchored
He wanted the green light
He got the carmine
The lights never change
Stop I'm amber
I'm feeling the truth
I'm seeing the only one that matters is you
I'm running on empty
And I know that my friend is on the edge of breaking
But, but you don't care, no honey

Should tell him I don't want him
Should tell him I don't need him
Tell him lies, all good, it's all good
Should tell him I don't want him
Should tell him I don't need him
Tell him lies, all good, it's all good

I still want it
I still want it
He wanted an angel
Didn't get the part
The lights never change
Please do remain in amber
He wanted me silent
I wanted to scream
But he never changed so I still remained
The amber
I'm feeling the truth
I'm seeing the only one that matters is you
I'm running on empty
And I know that my friend is on the edge of breaking
But, but you don't care, no honey

Should tell him I don't want him
Should tell him I don't need him
Tell him lies, all good, it's all good
Should tell him I don't want him
Should tell him I don't need him
Tell him lies, all good, it's all good!

Should've known it
Should've known it
Should've known that you don't care

And I should tell him I don't want him
I should tell him I don't need him anymore
No no nooooooo

Should tell him I don't want him
Should tell him I don't need him
Tell him lies, all good, it's all good
