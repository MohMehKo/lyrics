Your reflection increases in the bed
Your wide smile and wooded footsteps
Your silver hair, your red checked shirt
Buttoned to your apple
Laugh until it hurts

Do I believe in golden gates?
Don’t know the answers
Are you an angel or a saint?
Or just my truth?

I don't know what exists
Or when the Heaven’s over
I know for sure

If perfect's out there, it’s you
If perfect's out there, it’s you

You're more than blissful
A sleeve that wears your heart
Coloring the spectrum
Lighting up the dark

Count the time
Awake before you sleep
Think of Mona Lisa, smiles for your dreams

Do I believe in golden gates?
Don’t know the answers
Are you an angel or a saint?
Or just my truth?

I do hope God exists
Or when the Heaven’s over
I know for sure

If perfect's out there, it's you
If perfect's out there, it's you

If perfect's out there

Who knows what is beautiful?
Who says what is beautiful?
Who knows what is beautiful?
Who says what is beautiful?

If perfect is out there, its you
If perfect is out there, its you

If perfect is out there...
If perfect is out there...
It's you
If perfect is out there
It's you
