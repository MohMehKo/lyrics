Tell me what you're thinking
Could I help decide
With apple cherry kisses
Do your lips read mine

Your chocolate on my tongue
I can taste what love really feels like
My tongue is numb still I take the bite
Of your requited touch
I do like the taste of
Our troubled love cause

How would it feel if I gave you up
You'd be craving me like a honey plum
No Apple cherry kisses
How would it feel

Is it me you're missing
Could I change your mind
With Apple cherry kisses
Do your lips decline

Your chocolate on my tongue
I can taste what love really feels like
My thoughts are lost if I take the bite
Of your requited touch
I do like the taste of
Our troubled love cause

How would it feel if I gave you up
You'd be craving me like a honey plum
No apple cherry kisses
How would it feel

Our love, complicated
Tough love, underrated
Broke hearts, instigated
Life apart, overrated

Our love, complicated

How would it feel if I gave you up
You'd be craving my like a honey plum
No Apple cherry kisses
How would it feel
