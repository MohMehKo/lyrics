Imagining you touch my
Traces in the bed
Run your fingers through the cotton sheets
Smelt the oil from my hair

When I drip my perfume on your pillowcase
That's when you know I was there

Would you like to know that I'm really here?
Witnessing my clothes are draped on the chair
If you want it, then you got it
Don't you waste it
You know you have it

When I drip my perfume on your pillowcase
And then you'll know I was really there

You know I'm worth the wait
I'll take your breath away
It feels like, ooh
And when your dawn awakes
I'll take your breath away
It feels like, ooh

Calling when you had a few, I'm blushing
Hanging up for hours, hitting something
I know you miss me when you play those silly games
It's not an optical illusion

When I drip my perfume on your pillowcase
And then you know I was there

And you should know I'm good fruit
And I won't leave you thirsty
Everything's about you
I will put you first
And I know it gets lonely
But you won't go unheard
That's how you know I'm there

You know I'm worth the wait
I'll take your breath away
It feels like, ooh
And when your dawn awakes
I'll take your breath away
It feels like, ooh
You know I'm worth the wait
I'll take your breath away
It feels like, ooh
(It feels like, ooh, It feels like, ooh, It feels like, ooh)
And when your dawn awakes (And when your dawn awakes)
I'll take your breath away (I'll take your breath away)
It feels like, ooh (It feels like, It feels like, ooh, It feels like, ooh)
