You call me to tell me what's up with you
Huh
We're living on top of the world it seems
Way up here in a higher place
What's our time? Are you coming over?

Thinking I can hold onto, oh
Clouds that I keep falling through

Just wanna get to know ya
Just wanna get to know ya
Cause you don't even know me
(Just want to...)
Just wanna get to know ya
(Just want to...)

Like a fire, you're burning me up
Oh
Take cover
Cause we're gonna float up to this feeling of a higher place
It's our world
It's our world

And maybe we can hold onto, oh
These clouds that I keep falling through

Just wanna get to know ya
Just wanna get to know ya
Cause you don't even know me
(Just want to...)
Just wanna get to know ya
(Just want to...)

So you call me and tell me what's up
And tell me what's up
So you call me and tell me what's up
And tell me what's up with you
So you call me and tell me what's up
And tell me what's up
So you call me and tell me what's up
And tell me what's up with you

And maybe we can hold onto, oh
These clouds that I keep falling through

Just wanna get to know ya
Just wanna get to know ya
Cause you don't know me
(Just want to...)
Just wanna get to know ya
(Just want to...)

You don't know me
Me
You don't know
Me
