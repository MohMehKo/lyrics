Just to hear your name
We can at least turn the world upside down
It makes me wonder
Do you feel the same thing?
Are we allowed?
We all got jungle fever
No law of attraction holding us down
We don't have to fight it
Whatever they say won't affect me now

No matter what they think, I'm all for you
When I'm by your side, just walk on through
I think that we should tell them (just tell them)
We don't give a

Did the world come to an end?
Did we turn it upside down?
Stuff is spinning 'round
It makes me wonder
How cruel, I chose to laugh
Let you walk somehow
We all got jungle fever, yeah
Who cares what they think?
Break those boundaries down
Don't have to fight it, now
Just following your heart's all we need from now

No matter what they think, I'm all for you
When I'm by your side, just walk on through
I think that we should tell them (just tell them)
Oh, no
We don't give a
Yeah
No matter what they think, I'm all for you
When I'm by your side, just walk on through
No, no, no, no, no
We don't give a

We don't give a damn what's on your mind
It's alright
You're not worth a minute of our time
It's alright
However we choose to live our lives
It's alright
I think that we should tell them

No matter what they think, I'm all for you
When I'm by your side, just walk on through
I think that we should tell them (just tell them)
Oh, no
We don't give a
Yeah, yeah
No matter what they think, I'm all for you
When I'm by your side, just walk on through
I think that we should tell them
No, no, no, no, no
We don't give a
