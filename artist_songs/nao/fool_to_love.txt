I was a fool to love
I was a fool to love you
I was a fool to love
I was a fool to love, love you

Hey lonely, sorry that I'm leaving you, my friend
Don't own me, on my back and teasing me again
Again, aga-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeain
Again, again, aga-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeain

And I bet you, hide from me this pleasure over pain
But who loved you is seasoned up, it rains on me again
Again, aga-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeain
Again, again, again

I was a fool to love you
I was a fool to love
Yeah, we could've had it all, oh oh oh all
I was a fool to love you
I was a fool to love
Yeah, we could've had it all, oh oh oh all
I was a fool to love you
I was a fool to love
I was a fool to love you
I was a fool to love
I was a fool to love, love

It's funny how we play these mindless games, my friend
They hold me back with insecurities again
Again, aga-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeain
It's time for a stronger me, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

So I'm giving you up, giving you up
It's the only way, I'm not gonna save us
Got over my self-doubt
You won't have to tell me again
Again, aga-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeain
Again, again, again

I was a fool to love you
I was a fool to love
Yeah, we could've had it all, oh oh oh all
I was a fool to love you
I was a fool to love
Yeah, we could've had it all, oh oh oh all

My goodbye to you
Self-assurance is taking me over
Yeah yeah yeah
It's time to let you slip from my shoulder
I'm wise and I'm older
Yeah yeah yeah

I was a fool to love you
I was a fool to love
Yeah, we could've had it all, oh oh oh all
I was a fool to love you
I was a fool to love
Yeah, we could've had it all, oh oh oh all
I was a fool to love you
I was a fool to love
I was a fool to love you
I was a fool to love
I was a fool to love
