Writing you a four secret page letter
I'm hoping that it landed at your door
And picked you up from where I had been
Missing years before
Whispering "you don't know me"
Not gonna pray that bit closer

You got me missing you and more
On the other side an angel surely
Held you and restored
All the colours that you're made of
My silver, red and gold
I just wanna feel you nearer
Not gonna pray that bit closer

So tell me again
Do you want me?
You want me, you want me
Tell me again
You want me
You want me now, you want me
Tell me again
Do you want me?
You want me, you want me
Tell me again
You want me now

So you heard it all before
And I haven't even told you
That you're mourning at your door
It's so clear that it's afraid
Just here I am, riding to your door
And I don't wanna hear it's over
Maybe I'll pray that bit closer, yeah

So keep me on your life support
Maybe your breathe is all I have, yeah
I know you've been here years before
But trust me this time, have no doubt
Oh, woah

So tell me again
Do you want me?
You want me, you want me
Tell me again
You want me
You want me now, you want me
Tell me again
Do you want me?
You want me, you want me
Tell me again
You want me now

Tell me again
I hope that matters to you
Tell me again
I hope that matters to you
Tell me again
I hope that matters to you
Tell me again
I hope that matters to you, you, you
Tell me again
I hope that matters to you
Tell me again
I hope that matters to you, you, you
Tell me again
I hope that matters to you
Tell me again
I hope that matters to you, you, you
Tell me again
I hope that matters to you
Darling, oh, tell me again
I hope that matters to you, you, you
Tell me again
I hope that matters to you
Tell me again
I hope that matters to you, you, you
Tell me again
I hope that matters to you
