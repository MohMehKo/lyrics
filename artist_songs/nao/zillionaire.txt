If I was full of riches
Holding on to millions
I'd fly up to your bedroom
Window watching you
You're lovely like September

If I can make you wonder
With riches from my foolish heart
I'd bury you in treasure
In the currency of feathers

And I promise we'd be richer than a millionaire, a zillionaire
Be richer than a millionaire, a zillionaire
We'd be richer than a millionaire, a zillionaire
Be richer than a millionaire, a zillion
We'd be richer than a millionaire

Take my heart and treasure
So make us hard to measure
You find my looking key
And open box of dreams
Of you you're my September

You just gotta try
To see your smile has find you
You smile so much to me
I'll give you my pennies
To freeze it til December

And if I told you over over
And make you smile and richer
Then all the money out to us could ever offer

We'd be richer than a millionaire, a zillionaires
Be richer than a millionaire, a zillionaire
We'd be richer than a millionaire, a zillionaire
Be richer than a millionaire, a zillion
We'd be richer than a millionaire, a zillionaire
Be richer than a millionaire, a zillionaire
We'd be richer than a millionaire, a zillionaire
Be richer than a millionaire, a zillion
We'd be richer than a millionaire
Be richer than a zillionaire
Be richer than a zillionaire
