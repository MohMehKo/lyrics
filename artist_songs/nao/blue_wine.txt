I've been holding onto fires in the night time
Thinking how I'm seeing mirrors daylight
Drinking red, but bleeding only blue wine
And I keep up alright
Whispered prayers and messages to heal my
Breaking into rivers on a real time
Drinking red, but bleeding only blue wine

I'm breaking into slow motion
I'm watching me in slow motion
Sweep me up from cold oceans
I'll make it through broken emotion

I've been waking up to freeze the sunrise
Hoping it's a way to reach the high life
I knew it all, stepping out to find I know nothing at all
And I've been drinking red, but bleeding only blue wine

I'm breaking into slow motion
I'm watching me in slow motion
Sweep me up from cold oceans
I'll make it through broken emotions
I'm breaking into slow motion
I'm watching me in slow motion
Sweep me up from cold oceans
I'll make it through broken emotion
