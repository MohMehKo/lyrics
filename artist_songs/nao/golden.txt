Perfect to some already
Like I'm a certain ready
Still got to hold on traffic
We're in the post so lonely
Going from rags to riches
Just lightning boots
So just remember
Who brings it, so come here babe
Cause when it's gone, when it's lost
Good prints, so come here to get
We thought that close is never
Waging a war ain't clever
Still got to tell our story
Eyes on the field of glory
Don't need to talk about us
Stick around and just remember
Who brings it, so come here babe

Oh, no disappearing higher, lost in time
Good brings, so come here to get

[Hook:]
Kinda like it golden
Let's take the sun come down again
Do you like it golden?
Hope the sun comes 'round again
[x2]

Building the something steady
It's half the thing go straight in
Is like the black or gold
Just a smile on top
Going from west to east
Just lightning boots
So just remember
Who brings it, so come here babe
Oh, no disappearing higher, lost in time
Good prints, so come here to get, oh no

Cause when it's gone, when it's lost
When it's gone
Good brings, so come here to get

[Hook x2]

Cause when it's gone
When it's lost
When it's gone
[x3]

Good brings, so come here to get
