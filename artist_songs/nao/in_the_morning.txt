He can't bear to leave me, in the morning
I'm too blind to see him, in the morning
Buried all my feelings, I'm withholding
It's not fair to let him fall

I tried to leave him signs
Give him warning
Are they hard to recognize?
You're still falling away cause I can't tell him
I don't love him anymore

I've got to let him go [x4]

He's falling even deeper, didn't see it coming
His heart belongs to me, but I'm still running
Away cause i can't tell him
I don't love him anymore

I can't be who he wants me to be, in the morning
I can't see whom he wants me to see, in the morning
But i can't wait to tell him
I don't love him anymore

I've got to let him go [x4]

I need him in the evening
I need him more and more
But when i wake to see him
He's not even on my mind

I've got to let him go [x4]
