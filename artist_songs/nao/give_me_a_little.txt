I bet you give it a little, more time
It's all that you need
A moment in mine
Don't give it a
Yeah, they chain me up so I won't talk about it
One needing a minute
Don't know all about it
Give it a little
Give it a more time
Oh-oh, take it from me

So give a little
Take it off
Give another moment
Take it off me
Give another
Take it off
Give another moment
Oh take it from me

Give me a little, give me
Give me a little, give me your
Give me a little, give me
Give me a little, give me your

Oh baby give it, more time
The world doesn't need average to colour the lines
Who gives a damn, they don't chain me up so don't fuck with it
One minute maybe can change it
Baby give it a little, give it more time
The world will give you something
Wait don't let it pass
It's time for them to notice
Have it in your grasp
The world will give you something
Wait don't let it pass, no
So maybe give it a little
Give it more time
Oh-oh, take it from me

So give a little
Take it off
Give another moment
Take it off me
Give another
Take it off
Give another moment
Oh take it from me
(Take it from me)

The world will give you something
Have it in your grasp
The world will give you something
Have it in your grasp
Don't wait for them to notice
Make it your own path
The world will give you something
Have it in your grasp, oh

So give a little
Take it off
Give another moment
Take it off me
Give another
Take it off
Give another moment
Oh take it from me

Give me a little, give me
Give me a little, give me your
Give me a little, give me
Give me a little, give me your
