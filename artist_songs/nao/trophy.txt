You make me nervous
Turning red
I'll take my time
Tripping over words and I'm seeing colours
Can I change your mind?
And age ain't but a number
Do you care?
On the other side
I'm more than just a number
Kinda rare
Would you like to try?

If you think that I'm a trophy you (better change your mind)
Better change your mind (I ain't your trophy, oh, no no)
Oh no, no
If you think that I would want you to (you're wrong all the time)
Better get in line (get in line)
Better get in line

Baby, I'm no trophy to you
Baby, I'm no trophy, no no
Baby, I'm no trophy to you

Light up the circus for the cage
Better say your line
Tripping over heels and I'm seeing metals
Hanging of the side
So trash me from your number
Do you care?
Would you even notice me?
I'm more than just a number
Kinda red
Can't afford to purchase me

If you think that I'm a trophy you (better change your mind)
Better change your mind (I ain't your trophy, oh, no no)
Oh no, no
If you think that I would want you to (you're wrong all the time)
Better get in line (get in line)
Better get in line

No, no, no, no
I think about it
Would you let me?

[A.K Paul:]
I know you talking about me
You can't escape now from me
You make angry, but you knew you know I get it
But I'll make up to you
Check up to see what you mean
Get your slice to you
You know I'd give you

[A.K Paul & Nao:]
Right now need to give you protection
Right now need to give you protection
Right now need to give you protection
Right now need to give you protection
Right now need to give you protection
Right now need to give you protection
Right now need to give you protection
(You know I'd give it)
Right now need to give you protection
(You know I'd give it)
Right now need to give you protection
(You know I'd give it)
Right now need to give you protection

Ooooh
Yeaahhh
