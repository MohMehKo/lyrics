Oh, I doubt you're good but it fits
As long as you take me there
Don't care if you're sure to come on in
As long as you're taking me there
If you roll the dice there's a chance
As long as you take me there
I don't even care about it
Just as long as you're taking me there

We could be, we could be, we could be
So as long as you're taking me there
We could be, we could be, we could be
So as long as you're taking me there

I see what you're saying, I hear you baby
Oh I hear you baby
You're loving your choice without me, I wanna take you there
So I see my mistake, that's why I came
I'm gonna take you there
We're growing apart, missed a lead
I'm gonna take you there
(We don't even care about it)
I'm gonna take you there

We could be, we could be, we could be
So as long as you're taking me there
We could be, we could be, we could be
So as long as you're taking me there
Well they don't know I take you there

Oh I'm taking- oh I'm taking- oh I'm taking you there
Oh I'm taking- oh I'm taking- oh I'm taking you there

I'm almost there now
We make over, the play to hold is over, I sway
Cause I need to deal with the fever too
Boy just take me there

And I know the bliss, you look down to this
Gonna do you right I swear
We're okay to you, I feel it too
Just let me take you down
Take me there

I'll get you there, yeah
