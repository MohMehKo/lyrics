Pick a number
Take a name
Falling on the roses
Falling on the roses

Start a fire
Burn it up
Falling on the roses
Falling on the roses

Is this love love love love love, love again
And will it be enough to keep me from running away again
Is this love love love love love, love again
Oh will it be enough
I wanna be in love again

Make it easy
Break apart
Falling on the roses
Falling on the roses

I'll be over you
Before it ends
Falling on the roses
Falling on the roses

Is this love love love love love, love again
And will it be enough to keep me from running away again
Is this love love love love love, love again
Oh will it be enough
I wanna be in love again

It's hard to be alone
The tides have come
With wasted words
And things I've always known
They don't mean shit without your love

Love love love love, love again
And will it be enough to keep me from running away again
Is this love love love love love, love again
Oh will it be enough
I wanna be in love again

Is this love love love love love, love again
And will it be enough to keep me from running away again
Is this love love love love love, love again
Oh will it be enough
I wanna be in love again
