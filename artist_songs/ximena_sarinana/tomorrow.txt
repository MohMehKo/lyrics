I'm tired of following instinct as
a way to truth
They're telling me to stay away from you
Every day's and open window
If I grow a little bolder
But I'm not sure that love's a strong limb
to survive when times get colder.

All of me is less of you
and I still want you here tomorrow
And When the sun is out and I am whole
we'll see if you're still around tomorrow

Torrid romance has always
been a thing for me
I'm such an easy target to deceive.
I've trying to cheat my shadow
to buy dome time with you tonight
But strength is key and I'm all out of.
I will have to leave you do it.

All of me is less of you
and I still want you here tomorrow
And When the sun is out and I am whole
we'll see if you're still around tomorrow
