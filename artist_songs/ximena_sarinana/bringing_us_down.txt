I'm looking at the candles I have burnt
Wondering if a brighter one will come
The past is gone
when you look into the dark
How I long to go back to the start

Will you spare me some integrity
in this game of cards
Will you give me a bit of sympathy
for the tired hearts.

And Something 's bringing us down
Trying to turn things around
And something's bringing us down
You know and I know we're running out

Someone should have told me life was hard
Keeping it from tearing us apart
You're out, I'm spent
We're not getting very far
We both forget to remember who we are

Will you give me a bit of sympathy
for the tired hearts.

And Something 's bringing us down
Trying to turn things around
And something's bringing us down
You know and I know we're running out
