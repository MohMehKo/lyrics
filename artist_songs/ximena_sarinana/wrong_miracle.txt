La La La La...

I am a million years old
a million years old oh yes its true
I got the wrong Miracle
the wrong Miracle cuz all I wanted was you.

La-La-La...

I am a ship in a bottle
a monkeys tail, a blue lagoon
I got the Wrong Miracle
the wrong Miracle cuz all I wanted was you
No matter how happy I am
There is always something in the air
the sudden thoughts the smallest thing,
remind me of what could've been
should I have walked the other way?

I have a lovely man, a quiet life oh yes I do.
I got the wrong Miracle
the wrong Miracle all I wanted was you the
wrong miracle cuz all I wanted was you
no matter how happy I am there is always
something in the air the sudden thoughts
the smallest thing
remind me of what could've been,
If I have gone the other way
would you be here with me today?
here with me today..

La la La la La La...

Wrong miracle all I wanted was you the wrong miracle 
all I wanted was you,
The wrong miracle but I guess it would do.
