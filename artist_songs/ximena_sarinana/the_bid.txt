We're on the right road,
the stakes getting higher
I'm bled out from trying
To keep it together
The luck that befalls us
Has bent over sightly
More than what you
were willing to give me

The bid can never get so high...

I don't think you notice me
Don't know who I really am
Maybe if you lost me
You would see...

Maybe you're over
this hyper-ambition
It takes more than you
to create an opinion
I'm too proud to understand
experience's messages.
That few thing in real life
prove to be ageless.

The bid can never get so high...

I don't think you notice me.
Don't know who I really am,
Maybe if you lost me
You would see...
