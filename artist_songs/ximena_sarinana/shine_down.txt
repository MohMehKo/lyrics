Catching up
You need to run
has left me out of breath
Your faith in me is in my hands
Dusty habits of the shelf, breaking
some of them beyond repair,
Making more than what
I want to put you through.

All I am is moving underneath me
Empty hands are hanging from the celling
My will to learn is not enough to fix this
All you need is someone to believe in.

Honesty
Your eyes reveal a stark curiosity
A rocky path is hard to beat.
We like Thickening the plt
giving everything we ever got
Letting down the ones
who knew it from the start

All I am is moving underneath me
Empty hands are hanging from the celling
My will to learn is not enough to fix this
All you need is someone to believe in.
