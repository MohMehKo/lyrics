I am bent on a craving
Time to change out of date and
there is always someone else
In the making

I will go if you let me
for the ones who'll impress me
I can fail in and out of love very quickly.

I though he was ready
to mend my broken heart
I fell when he told me
he liked to play guitar
I know I can be naive,
give myself entirely
For a man who looks like he
knows his way 'round casually.
till someone remind me that
He was fond the Godard

I am known to be fooled by
simple ones covered in lies
The know how yo hypnotize
with their dull eyes.

I though he was ready
to mend my broken heart
I fell when he told me
he liked to play guitar
I know I can be naive,
give myself entirely
For a man who looks like he
knows his way 'round casually.
till someone remind me that
He knew about modern art.

I though he was ready
to mend my broken heart

he liked to play guitar
I know I can be naive,
give myself entirely
For a man who looks like he
knows his way 'round casually.
till someone remind me that
He lived in Echo Park
