I'm in the task of looking back
wondering if I am still on track
With what I believe to be the score
love is fair, nothing more.

Knife in the water's cutting in
bearing the cost of look you
gave when you left me for the prize,
didn't care for goodbyes.

I got lost in the way
I was so caught up I forgot
How to remember
In the end all we have
is a common ground
that will save us from each other

My heart is beating like a drum,
leaving behind what I've become
To follow the lead of broken dreams,
nothing is what it seems.

I got lost in the way
I was so caught up I forgot
How to remember
In the end all we have
is a common ground
that will save us from each other

We're alone,
we don't want to look around,
we don't care,
we just want it all right now.
I'm scared
that the world is crashing down.
Open up
sympathy is all we've got

I got lost in the way
I was so caught up I forgot
How to remember
In the end all we have
is a common ground
that will save us from each other
