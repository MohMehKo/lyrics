Your say you're made of simple stories,
there isn't much to tell.
But each look can fill a room with past
regrets, you've kept them to yourself.
I'm bold to try and dig in deeper,
there's waters in the cave.
But I'm not the kind who likes to wait
and see if promises were met.

And it's the lies you live in
take you bye surprise and in them
I will never tie your loose ends
We can stop pretending
I know who you are.

This game is probably never ending,
there's always mote to see
It's easy to begin to lose control
over a strong curiosity.
You are the pieces in the puzzle,
the answer I need to find
To prove that everyone will let you down
if you just give them the time.

And it's the lies you live in
take you bye surprise and in them
I will never tie your loose ends
We can stop pretending
I know who you are.

And it's the lies you live in
take you bye surprise and in them
I will never tie your loose ends
We can stop pretending
I know who you are.

Where do I stand
When will I learn how to trust you?
Will I become
what I'm afraid to discover?
Will anything change
When you take the blame
again again and again?

And it's the lies you live in
take you bye surprise and in them
I will never tie your loose ends
We can stop pretending
I know who you are.
