Hmmmmm,yea,hmmm,ooooh, 
I see you everyday girl, 
And there's something I'd like to tell ya, 
if you just listen to the words

[Chorus:]
Oooh, you can wear my jacket
(to let them know you're mine)
Hold my hand girl,
(you know I ain't ashamed)
to know what love is,
(but I gotta feel this way)
You're the one hey hey, you're the one
[repeat]

I watch you in the halls everyday
I wanna stop you girl but I don't know what to say
And looking at you girl makes me feel crazy
My friends wanna play but I ain't got time for the games
They say Lil' Chris why you actin like this?
And I really don't know why I'm actin like this,
got them butterflies in my stomach and they're ready to fly
So talk with me, oooh just walk with me.

[Chorus x2]

Can't wait to walk you home from school 
and you don't even ask cause you know I want to do it
And if you want some candy girl, let's go to the store
Get whatever you like, do you want a little more?
I especially love the love notes that you write
And I can't go to sleep till I read them every night
And this feeling that I'm feeling babe it's a natural high
And it feels good girl you make me feel real good girl

[Bridge:]
Oh I know I never really knew what love is
Till the day we had our first kiss
And now I'm gonna love you forever (I'm gonna love you forever)
Ooh ooh ooh I know I can't say what the future is
But rest asure I'm going cherish this 
I feel like I'm gonna love you forever girl
(I feel) (I feel)

[repeat chorus til fade]
