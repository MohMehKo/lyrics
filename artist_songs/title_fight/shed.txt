You're cold like the blood that runs through your veins.
I've been told there's a black spot next to your name
that you can't seem to erase.
You shed your skin, you change your face,
but you're all the same.
You're all the same.

Shed your skin.
Find a better body to fit in.

I've lost track of all the times you betrayed.
I've lost faith in the friendships I have made.
I'd drag you down and put you in your place.
But shed your skin, you change your face.

Shed your skin.
Find a better body to fit in.
Shed your skin.
Find a better body to fit in.
