Can I tell you everything? 
All I ever wanted was to be interesting. 
You said you don’t mind.
Lie to me one more time. 
I’m boring, no fun at all. 
I put my head right through the wall. 
I try to make myself feel.
No luck this time. Try again next year.

I’ve led myself to believe 
The world has turned its back on me. 
How’s that for comforting?
I just want to be interesting.

I’m sorry if you don’t see me 
As much as you deem necessary.
You say you care for your friends. 
Did you lie or just pretend?

I never wanted sympathy, just wanted to be something.
I never wanted sympathy, just wanted to be something.
I never wanted sympathy, just wanted to be something.
I never wanted sympathy, just wanted to be something.

I’ve led myself to believe 
The world has turned its back on me. 
How’s that for comforting? 
I just want to be interesting.
