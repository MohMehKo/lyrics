You’re calloused, but you don’t even know 
I’m picking at my scabs
I’ll let all the bruises show

I’ll never forget what all these feelings meant
Flying home for a funeral was my last regret

I hear a telephone three thousand miles from home
Do you even really care?
Your heart is just a stone

I’ll never forget what all these feelings meant
Flying home for a funeral was my last regret
I’ll never forget what all these feelings meant
Flying home for a funeral was my last regret
