Another floor-
a different ceiling than the night before.
Where am I?
While you're back home
life goes on and on and on and on.

This strange routine sometimes weighs down on me,
But I wouldn't trade it.
Not for anything.
Maybe there's nothing only this moment.

As cars pass by-
Live fast.
Drive slow.
Stay alive.
Where am I?
While you're back home
time goes on and on and on and on

This strange routine sometimes weighs down on me,
But I wouldn't trade it.
Not for anything.
Maybe there's nothing only this moment.
