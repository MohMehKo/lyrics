First things first, I'm prepared for the worst tonight
And all this adding up is pulling me back down

So you better keep your distance
You're stupid, worthless, just for instance
Honestly, you're on to nothing
By thinking what you thought was something
You better keep your distance, watch your step
And don't forget that I know where you sleep at night
I know where you sleep at night

All your support is wearing thin
Your hope for hope is at an end
I'll watch your world cave in
You are neck deep in lies you can't keep
I'm on to you

So you better keep your distance
You're stupid, worthless, just for instance
Honestly, you're on to nothing
By thinking what you thought was something
You better keep your distance, watch your step
And don't forget that I know where you sleep at night
I know where you sleep at night
