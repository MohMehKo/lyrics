I've seen you here.
Never alone, you're always near.
Do you regret
Being used are you used to it yet?

Don’t throw me away
I want to be your toy forever
And I say "Don’t throw me away
I want to be your toy forever"

Alone in my room
Straight from the ones you knew
Heard it’s hard to relate
When I can’t screw my head on straight

Don’t throw me away
I want to be your toy forever
And I say "Don’t throw me away
I want to be your toy forever"

Don’t throw me away
I want to be your toy forever
And I say "Don’t throw me away
I want to be your toy forever"
