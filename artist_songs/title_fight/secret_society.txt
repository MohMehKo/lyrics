I made promises that I can’t keep.
I fell asleep.
I was the one who locked the door.
I lost the key.
Told me lies straight to my face,
but I guess that’s fate.
I said, “everything is fine with me.”
I lied through my teeth.
I’ve lost all of my self respect.
I’m such a wreck
I’m running out of air to breathe.
I think it’s time for me to leave my friends all behind.
Watch me hurt, or are you blind?
I think it’s sad you’ll never know.
My true feelings will never show.

I made promises that I can’t keep.
I fell asleep.
I was the one who locked the door.
I lost the key.
Told me lies straight to my face,
but I guess that’s fate.

I’ll be you and you’ll be me
I’ll be you and you’ll be me
My secret society
