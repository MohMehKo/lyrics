I see my breath with every word.
Frozen in time, looking back at me can still be heard.

Looking out from a window seat.
My conscience surrounding in everything I see.

I see my breath with every word.
Frozen in time looking back at me can still be heard.

All along I've done this on my own.
I heard your voice and now it's gone.
