Memorial Day came and went again
and I feel the same-
how much you've changed.

I've heard all about where you've been
and how you are now, but I'm still remembering
how last year's parade's crowded streets left me
with a longing for nothing more.

Memorial Day came and went again
and I feel the same-
how much you've changed.

And I'll let you take a stab at me.
Maybe then you'll know what I mean.

Last year's streets at summer's end
left me with a longing for something more.

I'll let you take a stab at me.
I'll let you take a stab at me.
