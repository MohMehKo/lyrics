My father said, "Don't be so scared"
Driving home all alone you're in a hospital bed
I closed my eyes
Ignored the signs
Tried to wake up from a dream it's not working this time

If I said your name 27 times
Would that bring you back to life?
If I said your name 27 times
Would that bring you back to life?

Do you remember your lucky number?
Your superstition has me buried six feet under

If I said your name 27 times
Would that bring you back to life?
If I said your name 27 times
Would that bring you back to life?

Do you remember your lucky number?
Do you remember your lucky number?

If I said your name 27 times
Would that bring you back to life?
If I said your name 27 times
Would that bring you back to life?
