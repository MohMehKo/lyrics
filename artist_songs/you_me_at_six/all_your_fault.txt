if this is the end
and these white coats and this medicine
is my new comfort zone
and my new best friend.

shall we cue the violins
cause this life is made of violence
sixteen, he's already on his way
next victim, the clouds and the pearly gates

when the room goes quiet
nobody knows
and it's all your fault
and it's all your fault

wish that I was younger
wish that I was smart enough
to keep my composure
keep my head straight

oh you can be my headache
and i'll make your name famous
you say,
showing you just how cool he is
the powders could be the catalyst

when the room goes quiet
nobody knows what to say
and the room goes quiet
and they don't (and it,s all your fault)
and it,s all your fault

When the room goes quiet
nobody knows what to say
this is the part when we say what a shame
this is the part where we shoulder all the blame

my friends owe it to themselves
to get a grip and cherish their good health
don't want the room to go quiet
and have to think of things to say

when the room goes quiet (goes quiet)
and the room goes
and it's all your fault
and it's all your fault
