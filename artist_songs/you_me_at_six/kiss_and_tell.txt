You're so good, you're so bad
That everybody wants to be your man
You're so good, you're so bad
Everybody wants to be in your hair
Under your skin and in those clothes
On those lips... But me.

Kiss and tell everybody else
That you're at your best
When I'm makin' making baby steps

You make the rules up as you go
So, I've gone and made some of my own
You make the rules up as you go
So, I'm gonna send your love home
What did you expect from me?
I said there's so much more that you won't see
What did you expect from me?
I said I'm smarter than him you see

Kiss and tell everybody else
That you're at your best
When I'm makin' baby steps
And I'm sick and tired of being the good guy
And I've done my time
You should hit the back of the line

I know you don't need to tell me [x12]

I know you don't
I know you don't
Need to tell me, tell me.
I know you don't
I know you don't need to tell me, tell me

Kiss and tell everybody else
That you're at your best
When I'm makin' baby steps
And I'm sick and tired of being the good guy
And I've done my time
And you should hit the back of the line
