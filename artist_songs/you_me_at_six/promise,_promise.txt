Tie a noose around my neck, and kick away the chair baby.
You've got me right where you need.
Cut the words you're about to wake when
We've got you right where you always are (open up your eyes)

Let me know
Let me know
Let me know
Let me know

Come on, cut the ropes.
Come on, cut the ropes.
Cut, cut the ropes. (ropes)
Cut, cut the ropes.
Cut the ropes.
Cut the ropes.

Let me know, can't you let me know?
Let me know.
Let me know.

Try to promise, promise everything,
Try the words so we can break,
Promise promise everything.
Eggs are so that I can weep. (?)
Promise promise everything,
So I can believe in what you say.
Promise promise everything,
Eggs are so that I can't leave.

Just won't you let me know then?
Just won't you just let me see?
Just won't you let me know, Dad?
(Just what can you want me to see? I can't see this.)
Just won't you just let me see? (Until I leave.)

Tireless, despite us. Just playing this, WHAT?

Let me know (why won't you?)
Let me know
Let me know (Promise promise everything, try the words so we can break,)
Let me know (Promise promise everything, try the air so we can leave!)
