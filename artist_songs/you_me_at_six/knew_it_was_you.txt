(whoa oh, whoa oh-oh, whoa oh)
(whoa oh, whoa oh-oh, whoa oh)

i broke it down as we built
i made a sound just to be heard
i made mistakes just to feel guilt
i made some traps just to see some hurt

you talk a lot about what you don't know
you say you wanna stay but always go
you've lit a spark, but you'll never glow
you've got no chance in this hell

should i, do i even care at all?
could i, will i be there to watch you fall?

(whoa oh, whoa oh-oh, whoa oh)

worthy of my time? i think not
always on my mind? afraid not
suspecting the worst, i do a lot
it's not called lazy, it's called an art

you talk a lot about what you don't know
you say you wanna stay but always go
you've lit a spark, but you'll never glow
you've got no chance in this hell

should i, do i even care at all?
could i, will i be there to watch you fall?
should i, do i even care at all?
could i, will i be there to watch you fall?

watch you fall, watch you fall
watch you fall, watch you fall

should i, do i even care at all?
could i, will i be there to watch you fall?
should i, do i even care at all?
could i, will i be there to watch you fall?
