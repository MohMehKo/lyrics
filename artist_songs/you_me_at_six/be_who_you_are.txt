I stick on the best guess record and sit outside in the sun,
Pull a chair next to you,
See that you are the one.
Show me joy division,
Show me dead man's bones,
Just a summer romance,
Look how far we've grown.

It won't always be summer,
It might be Autumn too.
Winter might come join in,
But I'll be next to you.

'Cause you are, my little star,
I said you are, my little star,
I said yo-ou are, my light in the dark
Don't change.

Just be who you are. [x3]
