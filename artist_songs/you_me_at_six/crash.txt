Wait, where you say you've been?
Who you been with?
Where you say you're goin'?
Who you goin' with?

Keep me on my toes,
Keep me in the know.

Wait, keep me in your skin,
Keep me in your chest.
I'll wait for it to start,
I'll wait for it to end.

Keep me on my toes,
Keep me in the know.

But when I looked at her,
I thought of only you.
If only there was proof I could use to show it's true.

We were young,
We were in our teens.
It wasn't real love,
Spent behind bars.
Oh it's sad to think,
We just let it be.
Prisoners of love.

It's so easy for it to be,
Something second guessed.
Easy to read,
Don't let it become,
A meaningless routine.
It's meaningless to me.

But when I looked at her,
I thought of only you.
If only there was proof I could use to show it's true.

Just crash, fall down,
I'll wrap my arms around you now.
Just crash, it's our time now,
To make this work second time around.

We grew up,
We worked and changed our ways.
Just like wildfire,
Been burning now for days.
Tearing down those walls,
Nothing's in our way.
I said, nothing's in our way.

And I know,
I've said this all before,
But opposites attract.
We try and run away,
But end up running back.
And all I want to do,
All I want to do,
Is lie down and...

Crash, fall down.
I'll wrap my arms around you now.
Just crash, it's our time now,
To make this work, second time around.

Oh crash, fall down.
Just crash, fall down.
Just crash, fall down.
Just crash, fall down.
