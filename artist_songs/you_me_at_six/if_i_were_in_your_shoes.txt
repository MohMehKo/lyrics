There's something you don't know
I've walked you off to keep you on your toes.
There's something you didn't know,
I've grown some bones, so I can walk you off.

Tonight, tonight, everything's alright, tonight, tonight.

If I were in your shoes I'd run a thousand miles just to tell you.
If I were in your room, using just my eyes I would tell you,
I would tell you

There's something you didn't know
you've got your teeth in me and it hurts.
And I'm a lie away from saying what I really think,
this is the bottom of the bottle saying swim or sink
and you don't even need me now.

Tonight, tonight, everything's alright, tonight, tonight.

If I were in your shoes I'd run a thousand miles just to tell you.
If I were in your room, using just my eyes, using just my eyes,
I would tell you.

If I were in your shoes I'd run a thousand miles just to tell you.
If I were in your room, using just my eyes I would tell you.

If I were in your shoes
In your shoes, in your

And I'm a lie away from saying what I really think,
this is the bottom of the bottle saying swim or sink
and you don't even need me now.
