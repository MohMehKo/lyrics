When you see a ghost
Of someone that you used to know
You understand
What it is that you had
It's happened again
You go and get away with it
This room went cold
After you walked in

And if your past calls
Don't you pick it up
It's got nothing new to say
I know that people change
The memories stay the same
And leave without a trace
Whoa

Are you waiting on someone who
Can make you feel a little more like you
Are you waiting on someone to
To make you feel, to make you feel brand new

It don't feel right
Letting you walk away
What have I
What have I got to gain?
A fill in the gaps
Of your first, second and last chance
It's not what you planned
Your history holds you back

And if your past calls
Don't you pick it up
It's got nothing new to say

Are you waiting on someone who
Can make you feel a little more like you
Are you waiting on someone to
To make you feel, to make you feel brand new
And I hope they do
Woah

Are you waiting on someone who
Can make you feel a little more like you
And are you waiting on someone to
To make you feel, make you feel brand new
And I hope they do
