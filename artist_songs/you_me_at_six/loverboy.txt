Hell had you by the throat.
You never got to heaven but you got real close.
Your past has you in a choke hold
You deserve it from what I've been told.

I call my bluff, say, "What do you want?"
I'm looking down at you from the top.
I beg for attention in small doses.
Leave the scene smelling of dead roses.

Loverboy, you play those hearts like toys.
Don't you feel bad, don't you feel bad, feel bad for them?

This is your night with arms wide open.
I'm the option you shouldn't have chosen.
Scared of the dark, the door's wide open.
This is the night you'll regret in the morning.

Loverboy, you play those hearts like toys.
Don't you feel bad, don't you feel bad, feel bad for them?

Given the choice would you do it again?
Of course I would, of course I should,
Well, I'm your friend, friend with benefits.
