And at the start, I was wishing I could be anything you'd want.
I've been living with strangers here that haunt my thoughts.
Nice guys finish last, I take pride in that.
Can't change it now, broke free from my past.
We walk the same streets, but have different views.
You see change, I see cavalier youth.

So love me like you used to
When I couldn't lose you
Why is it goodbye?

And at the end judges pointed out my flaws,
With so much ease.
You have brought up my self-esteem just to suck it out of me.
I'm not broken, but I'm close to the edge.
Need fewer enemies, then I have friends.
I hope that I will see you there.
I hope I will see you there.

So love me like you used to
When I couldn't lose you.
Why is it goodbye?
Just love me like you need me,
Oh just can't you need me?
Why, why? Can now the things that matter most,
The things I can't decide, if I want.
So this time I will realize,
This time I will sacrifice.
Whatever that it takes.
Whatever that it takes.

So love me like you used to
When I couldn't lose you.
Why, why?
Just love me.
Just love me.
Just love me.
