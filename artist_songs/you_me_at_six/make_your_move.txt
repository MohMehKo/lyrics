Make your move
Hold your breath
Hope that you
Have something left
Wait your turn
To call the shots
Play your hand
Watch your luck

And are you gonna be there?
And are you gonna be there?
I think you know

No
No
You're under my skin
You're under my skin
No
No
I've got no time for you
I've got no time for you

So you've seen it
All before
I heard you watch
From afar
Caught in the headlights
Of your love
Stuck in first
First on time

And are you gunna be there?
I think you know

No
No
You're under my skin
You're under my skin
No
No
I've got no time for you
I've got no time for you

Got me right where you want me, don't you?
Got me right where you want me, don't you?
Got me right where you want me, don't you?

Now that you know

No
No
You're under my skin
You're under my skin
No
No
I've got no time for you
I've got no time for you, you
