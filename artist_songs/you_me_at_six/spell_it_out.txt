I'm not a saviour
I ain't no traitor
They're the ones who lie to you
Is this the end
End of an era
Spent too long living in fear
My darkest days have come
And pulled me under
I want my moments in the sun

Should I spell it out for you?
No one here is bullet
No one here is bulletproof

In all this mayhem
You've made me feel again
But some of me won't be saved
I've tried to change
I've got my ways
Losing grip and sanity

I know, I know, I know, I know,
I know it's such an awful thing
For me to do
I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't
I won't give up on me
If you don't too

Should I spell it out for you?
No one here is bulletproof
And what are you to do
Than battle on, battle on through?
Battle on through

Should I spell it out for you?
And no one here is bulletproof
And what are you to do
Than battle, battle on through?
Should I spell it out for you?
For you
For you

I'm not a saviour
But I ain't no traitor
They're the ones who lie to you
