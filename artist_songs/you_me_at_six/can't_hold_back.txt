Feels like I've been here before
Name ain't on the door
What are those cold eyes for?
I don't think I know
He's in all black
And he thinks he's all that
That's for sure
A word in his ear
My initials appear
What's the score?

I think I've figured it out
You and I, we will not work
'Cause when my back is turned
You find a way to make things worse
I call for calm
But the storm comes first

I can't hold back
Can't hold back on you tonight
I won't hold back
Won't hold back on you tonight
Won't hold back no

You've got that passive going on
Regression coming on strong
I see no reason to lead you
I follow, I follow you

Oh when you figure it out
Your time has come and gone
Lost your bottle
Lost your touch
And now all the bets are off
The curtain call on your cover up

I can't hold back
Can't hold back on you tonight
I won't hold back
Won't hold back on you tonight

Nobody wants to be alone
Nobody wants to be alone
Nobody wants to be alone
Nobody wants to be alone
Nobody wants to be alone
Nobody wants to be alone
Nobody wants to be alone
Nobody wants to be alone

I wanna go if you are going
I wanna roll if you are rolling
You've got your leather on and got me falling
Shoes with red soles, you're taking me home

I can't hold back
Can't hold back on you tonight
I won't hold back
Won't hold back on you tonight

You and I, we will not work
'Cause when my back is turned
You find a way
You find a way to make it worse
