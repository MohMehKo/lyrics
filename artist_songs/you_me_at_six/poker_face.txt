I wanna hold em like they do in Texas, please
Fold em, let em hit me. raise it, baby, stay with me
Luck and intuition play the cards with Spades to start
And after he's been hooked, I'll play the one that's on her heart

Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohhhh, ohh oh oh ohh oh oh
I'll get her hot, show her what I've got
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohhhh, ohh oh oh ohh oh oh
I'll get her hot, show her what I've got

Can't read my, can't read my
No, she can't read my poker face
Can't read my, can't read my
No, she can't read my poker face

P-p-p-poker face, p-p-poker face
P-p-p-poker face, p-p-poker face

I wanna roll with her, a hard pair we will be
A little gambling is fun when you're with me
Russian Roulette is not the same without a gun
And baby, when it's love, if it's not rough it isn't fun, fun

Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohhhh, ohh oh oh ohh oh oh

Can't read my, can't read my
No, she can't read my poker face
Can't read my, can't read my
No, she can't read my poker face
She can't read my poker face
She can't read my poker face
She can't read my poker face
She can't read my poker face

I won't tell you that I love you, kiss or hug you
I won't tell you that I love you, kiss or hug you
I won't tell you that I love you, kiss or hug you
I won't tell you that I love you, kiss or hug you

Can't read my, can't read my
No, she can't read my poker face
Can't read my, can't read my
No, she can't read my poker face
She can't read my poker face
She can't read my poker face
She can't read my poker face
She can't read my, she can't read my poker face
