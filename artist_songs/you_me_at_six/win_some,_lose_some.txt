If I'm gonna die I'm not gonna die on my knees.
If there's bigger plans then someone read them out to me.
Has this life been a rehearsal for better things?
Or have you been wasting your time, your time with me?

Get away, get away, get away from me.
I'm moving on, moving on to better things.
And I got no time to explain what you see.
So let me lead the blind indefinitely.

Yes, you win some and you lose some.
I've been losing for a while now.
And you win some and you lose some.
And I've been keeping count.
I said oh, my hope is gone.
I said oh, my hope is gone.

In this life I sing till I get chest pains.
I'm in a different district, Hunger games.
I don't know if we'll make it anymore.
Put me, put me on a pedestal.
Let's see, let's see if I rise or fall.
At least I'll be in the fight, I ain't scared anymore.

Yes, you win some and you lose some.
I've been losing for a while now.
And you win some and you lose some.
And I've been keeping count.
I said all my hope is gone.
I said all my hope is gone.

Get away, get away, get away from me.
I'm moving on, moving on to better things. [4x]

Yes, you win some and you lose some.
I've been losing for a while now.
And you win some and you lose some.
And I've been keeping count.

Yes, you win some and you lose some.
I've been losing for a while now.
And you win some and you lose some.
And I've been keeping count.
I said all my hope is gone.
I said all my hope is gone.
I said all my hope is gone.
