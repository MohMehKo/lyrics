I wanna be,
I wanna be wherever you are,
I was around,
I was around from the start,
I've got you in my sights,
I want you there the rest of the nights.
And I'll say...

Are we gonna live forever?
Are we gonna live forever?
No.
Are we gonna live forever?
Are we gonna live forever?
No.

I'll tie myself, I'll tie myself all into knots.
I get so lost, yeah I feel so lost in my own skin.
It might take time, it might take faith.
The things we build, they'll never break,
And there some nights, we're world's apart,
Not this time, no goodbyes

And are we gonna live forever?
Are we gonna live forever?
No.
And are we gonna live forever?
Are we gonna live forever?

We're the wild ones,
We're the wild ones,
When you're gone there's no one to lean on,
And it's me, myself,
We're the wild ones,
We're the wild ones,
When you're gone there's no one to lean on,
And it's me, myself and I

You and I will go so far,
You and I will light the dark,
You're the better half of me,
You're the only half I need,

And are we gonna live forever?
Are we gonna live forever?
No.
And are we gonna live forever?
Are we gonna live forever?
No.

And we're the wild ones,
We're the wild ones,
When you're gone there's no one to lean on,
And it's me, myself,
And we're the wild ones,
We're the wild ones,
When you're gone there's no one to lean on,
And it's me myself and I

Are we gonna live forever?
Are we gonna live forever?
Are we gonna live forever?
Are we gonna live forever?
Are we gonna live forever?
Are we gonna live forever?
Are we gonna live forever?
Are we gonna live forever?
