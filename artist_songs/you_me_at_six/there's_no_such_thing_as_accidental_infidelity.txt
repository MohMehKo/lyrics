I've got a question
Did you think that we would ever believe you?
And on the note of rejection
The line you walk is getting thin, so thin
Your green eyes are potent
But last night I know who you were with
And you're a snake in the grass
And always that has been

Go back home now and go back to sleep
And we say, go back with someone else who
Who wants you more than me

Just one more question
Why do you throw your words around town
Like they answer nobody's questions
All ears, your chase comes out at night
Oh well, the whistles cry
We're supposed to drop like flies

Go back home now and go back to sleep
And we say, go back with someone else who
Who wants you more than me

Was it something I said?
Something I did that made you destroy all we've built
And it was something you said
Something you did that made me think that you weren't real

Go back home now and go back to sleep
And we say, go back with someone else who
Who wants you more than...
Who wants you more than me

Go back home now, go back to sleep
And go back with anything cause
I know you'll think of me [x2]

(Go back home now, go back to sleep)
(And we say, go back...)
