Hold on, where did you get those little facts from?
The last I heard we hadn’t changed for anyone
To celebrate you paste your hate for attention
And hang it high for everyone to see

I said too many things that I meant
And you don’t think for yourself
And you chose to believe anything that you hear
But I wouldn’t do that to you
Even though you do that to…

Confused, to whom and where I go with all my good news
The forum said it so fuck it must be true
How can I ever even think to trust you?
So I'm gonna cut you, cut you, cut you loose

I said too many things that i meant
And you don’t think for yourself
And you chose to believe anything that you hear
But I wouldn’t do that to you
Even though you do that to me [x2]
