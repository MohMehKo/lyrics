Oh have some heart and hold it to your chest
We weren't in love, we were too young
We throw our words around as if they were not gold
They are

Oh maybe someday I will be something more
Real with arms and legs so I can walk away
and stay away forever and some more

I'll stick around and watch this town fall down to it's knees
You can pray the day that you hope is coming round real soon
I will run and stay away in a place that I don't know well of
You can chose a different song that you will soon love

The names will vary, the names they will change
But the game, the game it stays the
Oh here are the reasons that hurt me the most
Call off the search I'm coming home
People I want, but not on the hurt
Not without reason, not for a girlsame.
Oh love, we want the ones that we will grow to hate, to hate

It's just so
oh no, oh no...

Maybe someday I'll deserve something more
A home in which I will turn to grow
I plant the seeds so that we can become something more, something more

I'll stick around and watch this town fall down to it's knees
You can pray the day that you hope is coming round real soon
I will run and stay away in a place that I don't know well of
You can chose a different song that you will soon love

Oh here are the reasons that hurt me the most
Call off the search she's coming home
People I want, but not on the hurt
Not without reason, not for a girl
