It's been a long time coming
This breakdown in our sights
And I just keep on running
Back for the same fight
I'll look at you
Not a single word comes to mind
I'll think of you
Maybe in another life

You, if you could I know you would
Choose letting go of something good

I've got a feeling
I've got a feeling
Nobody knows that you've got a heavy soul
I've got a feeling
I've got a feeling
Nobody knows that you've got a heavy soul

Looks a lot like heartache
The kind that mine can take
Oh, I just keep on running
Back for yesterday
I feel removed
When I'm in full bloom
Can I count on you
Can you, can you too

You, if you could I know you would
Choose letting go of something good

I've got a feeling
I've got a feeling
Nobody knows that you've got a heavy soul
I've got a feeling
I've got a feeling
Nobody knows that you've got a heavy soul

A heavy soul
I can see it
Can see what you think of us
It's a lovely old face
In a time, any place
And what are you waiting
What are you waiting
What are you waiting for
I don't think that you know
Any more than I know
(Any more, any more)
Oh, what are you waiting
What are you waiting
What are you waiting for
I don't think that you know
(Any more, any more)
Any more than I know

You, and if you could I know you would

I've got a feeling
I've got a feeling
I've got a feeling
That you've got a heavy soul
I've got a feeling
I've got a feeling
I've got a feeling
That you've got a heavy soul
