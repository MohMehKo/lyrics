Well I need you,
my bed's without you,
Oh no,
This one,
Only excusing on the ice,
Surprise,
Watch out,
I wouldn't trust you with the words,
Let that be a lesson learnt.

The lights are on, and it's time to be me, make on business,
With the promise you kept, that keeps me here.

But don't you know,
We're on the road, gotta get the right insurance,
Play with matches you're gonna get burnt,
Let you know with your dial tone,
But I still wait for your call.

Watch out honey now,
My bed stripped down the wall,
Push me, Back there,
One night of love went from me to him, to her,
I love great big smile, cameras, don't lie,
Not even for you sweetheart.

One day, I'll see you on the big screen,
In a film called 'Who shot the prom queen?'
You'll be an extra on the sidelines,
Just like a co star, sign

But don't you know,
We're on the road, gotta get the right insurance,
Play with matches you're gonna get burnt,
Let you know with your dial tone,
But I still wait for your call.

Still wait for your call,
Still wait for your call,
Still wait for your call,
Still wait for your CALL,

And say you're fine, last time,
I still wait for your call and say you're fine, the last time,
I still wait for your call.

(The last time, The last time)

Your call. . .

Please speak up, I can't hear you.
Please speak up, I can't hear you.

YOUR CALL.
