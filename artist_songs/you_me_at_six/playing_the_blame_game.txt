You're not on my list of things to do
'Cause I've already done you
And I'm protective, it's so cute
But only when it suits you
Is this all in vain?
Can these words explain?

Desperate minds mean desperate measures
You've got to get this one together
You're young and in love
That should be enough

At least you'll have nice thoughts of me
When I'm cheating on you in your dreams
I told you before, my closet's clean
And that these bones don't belong to me
Try this one for size
Try me one more time
You hold me down
By keeping me around

Desperate minds mean desperate measures
We got to get this one together
You're young and in love
That should be enough [x2]

You hold me down
By keeping me around
No one takes me home
And No one takes me home [x2]

Desperate minds mean desperate measures
We got to get this one together
You're young and in love
That should be enough
Young and in love (that should be, that should be)
Young and in love (that should be, that should be)
