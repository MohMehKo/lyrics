It's a been a day
It's felt like an age
Since I have seen you
A face to face so we can say what we need to
I know you've changed
You don't look the same
We all make mistakes
These growing pains, it's just a phase we have to go through

I've been wasting all this time
Trying to keep you off my mind, yeah
You off my mind, but no more
I've been wasting all these nights
Trying to keep you off my mind, yeah
You off my mind, no more

And how long should I wait (should I wait, I wait)
To feel myself, feel myself again?
Cause I know that you hate (you hate, you hate)
When we're side by side but going two separate ways

I've been wasting all this time
Trying to keep you off my mind, yeah
You off my mind, no more
I've been wasting all these nights
Trying to keep you off my mind, yeah
You off my mind, no more

What are you searching for?
What are you looking for?
I don't think you know
I don't think you know, no

I've been wasting all this time
Trying to keep you off my mind, yeah
You off my mind, hey

I've been wasting all this time
Trying to keep you off my mind, yeah
You off my mind, no more
I've been wasting all these nights
Trying to keep you off my mind, yeah
You off my mind, no more

What are you searching for?
What are you looking for?
