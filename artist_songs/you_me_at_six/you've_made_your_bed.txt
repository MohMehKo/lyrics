I'm so glad that your lipsticks on,
Back seat of your best friends car,
well we were onto something here.
Oh no wait you will call it off and space is on the cards,
Who'd drink to that, I wont drink to that.
Oh Over hill will you teach me the games that you play so well
And I'll drink to that, who'll drink to that?

You've made your bed, so sleep in it, but never call me again.
You've made your bed, so sleep with him,
But know I'm the best you'll get.
I wrote this song so you would know why I look up to everyone.
Cant blame a girl for trying, even though she keeps on lying more, more

Here's a list of the things you said and I won't get over it,
You want to know, you, want to know and.
The games that girls will play,
Makes me move away so i can train,
Train myself to trust again.
Oh Over hill will you teach me the games you play so well and,
I'll drink to that, will you drink to that?

You've made your bed, so sleep in it, and never call me again.
You've made your bed, so sleep with him,
But know I'm the best you'll get.
I wrote this song so you would know why I look up to everyone.
Cant blame a girl for trying, even though she keeps on lying more, more

Are you on or off? You on or,
Are you on or off? You on or.

I wrote this song so you would know why I look up to everyone.
Cant blame a girl for trying, even though she keeps on lying more, more

These words will convince you to never love me again,
You want to be friends, but I won't do it.
These words will convince you to never sleep with me again,
And you don't, and I don't do friends.
