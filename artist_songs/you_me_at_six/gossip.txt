Woah woah woah woah woahoah,
Woah woah oh woah woah,
Woah woah woah woah woahoah,
Woah woahoahow.

You’ve been looking at me like you’ve got something to say,
You got flaws in your step you’re miles away from anything,
a-a-a-anyway.
Lets get to the point,
The words that fell from your lips,
Didn’t mean anything; they didn’t mean shit, to you or him.

But tonight, but tonight, we will be alright;
Yes the champagne is on ice for you and I.
And tonight, and tonight,
We will be alright,
Coz we got it all, and all what's left inside,
Let’s just keep on talking.

I smell your scent on my skin and the clothes that I wear,
It’s a thought in my head and I can’t shake it,
Of you and him.
Sh-sh-sh-shake it,
I am at the party too,
I am in the room next to you,
With my back to the door and you was on the floor,
And you look desperate.

But tonight, but tonight, We will be alright;
Yes the champagne is on ice for you and I.
And tonight, and tonight,
We will be alright,
Coz we got it all, and all what's left inside
Let’s just keep on talking.

And don't let me down, and don't let me down,
And don't let me down, and don't let me down,
And don't let me down.

But tonight, but tonight, we will be alright;
Yes the champagne is on ice for you and I.
And tonight, and tonight,
We will be alright,
Coz we got it all, and all what's left inside
Let’s just keep on talking.

Woah woah woah woah woahoah,
Woah woah oh woah woah,
Woah woah woah woah woahoah,
Woah woahoahow.
