Everybody loves the original,
Everybody's got time to be cynical
Old enough to know better by now,
It’s the greatest joke don’t go letting me down

Hold my drink, this just got physical
I’m on a new wave, it’s getting visceral
Going toe to toe to see how you go
I’m in pain. So, yes, it is painful

Oh, heart of mine
Sing a sad song, sing a sad song
Warning you
Oh, heart of mine
Sing a sad song

And it’s a fresh start fever
Who wouldn’t want to be here?
Welcome to the future
Dream a little bigger

As for now I reserve judgments
Until these chains, chains are redundant
The brave die young and that’s all right for some
But I'm after something long term, long term

Let’s make resolutions
I’ve only got problems and no solutions
You’re just someone to the world
But you’re the world to someone else who told you

Oh heart of mine
Sing a sad song, sing a sad song
Warning you
Oh, heart of mine
Sing a sad song

And it’s a fresh start fever
Who wouldn’t want to be here?
Welcome to the future
Dream a little bigger

And it’s a fresh start fever
Fresh start fever
Welcome to the future
Dream a little big dream a little bigger

You’re a hard act to follow
So I stare down this empty bottle
But there's no message at the bottom
So how do I solve it

I’m a hard act to follow
I know we sink so slo-o-ow
Shallow is as shallow does
Keep a track on all those scars

I said you’ve got a chip on your shoulder
Getting worse now you’re older
Getting hard now you're sober
[Explicit:] There's your life, it's fucking over
[Clean:] There's your life and now it's over

And it’s a fresh start fever
Who wouldn’t want to be here?
Welcome to the future
Dream a little bigger

And it’s a fresh start fever
Fresh start fever
Welcome to the future
Dream a little big dream a little bigger
