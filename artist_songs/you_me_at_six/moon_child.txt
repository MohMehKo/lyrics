Hello! I'm your worst nightmare
And you're my biggest fear
I can tell by the smell of your breath
That you've been talking shit
This room is full of them
With smiles from ear to ear
Here's a place of such a quick fact
We'll soon disappear

Woah, woah
And everyone just wants to see us
Woah, woah
And everyone just wants to see us

Please just get in, quit that
Look at what you've done
You're all just out for yourselves
Looking out for number one
When we, we move on
But when we, we move on
But when we, we move on
We won't remember you

Woah, woah
And everyone just wants to see us
Woah, woah
And everyone just wants to see us fail!

And I will lick my wounds
Because they taste of you
And I will lick my wounds
Because they taste of you

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey

Woah, woah
And everyone just wants to see us
Woah, woah
And everyone just wants to see us
