You're pretty from afar, but far from pretty
I wish this room would stop spinning
So I could make up my mind
Decide what's wrong, decide what's right
And I'll decide this one in the light
Where I feel alive
My head's filled with thoughts of discontent
Time with you is time not well spent
So I will run and hide

I wish, I wish you didn't exist
It's a shame you do
Your plans are sad and not enough
Not foolproof

It takes one, it takes one, it takes one, takes one to know one
You're never gonna get it, no, you're never gonna, you're never gonna get it
It takes one, it takes one, it takes one, takes one to know one
You don't know me at all

Dropping names a day, you must be tired
You're gonna spend your life on the outside
I'll laugh in my spare time
You want to talk, and it says a lot
That on the back foot you don't say that much
You are in a reflective mood

I wish, I wish you didn't exist
It's a shame you do
Your plans are sad and not enough
Not foolproof

It takes one, it takes one, it takes one, takes one to know one
You're never gonna get it, no, you're never gonna, you're never gonna get it
It takes one, it takes one, it takes one, takes one to know one
You don't know me at all

Are you gonna be, are you gonna be there for
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be there for
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be there for
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be there for
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be there for
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be there for
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be there for
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be there for
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be there for
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be there for
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be there for
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be there for
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be there for
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be there for me?!
There for me?! Oh!

Are you gonna be, are you gonna be there for
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be there for
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be there
And are you gonna be, are you gonna be there for
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be there for
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be there for
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be there for
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be there for me?!
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be there for (It takes one to know one!)
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be there for (It takes one to know one!)
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be there for (It takes one to know)
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be there for (It takes one to know one!)
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be there for (It takes one to know one!)
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be there for (It takes one to know one!)
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be there for (It takes one to know)
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be there for (It takes one to know one!)
