You've should seen me last night,
Working the room had their chests going tight,
I got a theory, all I need is one drink.

I've got you breathing all heavy and deep,
Gasping for air and down on your knees,
You're in love, but for as only as long as you're wanted.

You never miss a beat, but.

You're the best kept secret, rolling off my tongue, some say you're
as easy as they come and I say, what a way for the ice to break. [2x]

Break down, you've always been so proud
And just look at you now.
You're a bad smell in this room.
"I don't wanna, I don't wanna be bad news." [2x]
But you are, but you are.

I would walk through hell with a smile on my face.
Just so I could make my mark on the hottest place.

You're the best kept secret, rolling off my tongue, some say you're
as easy as they come and I say, what a way for the ice to break.
[Until the end]
