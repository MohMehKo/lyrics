I know something you don't
It comes and goes
Like the strength in your bones, woah
So keep your mind at a rest
I'll never let the two of us be friends
Does it hurt?

Underdog, just look at the mess you made
It's such a shame, a shame
We had to find out this way

You must have the must have moment in your hands
And it's sad to think that this season I'm gonna change
Just not face to face
It ain't broke, so don't fix it

Underdog, just look at the mess you made
It's such a shame, a shame
We had to find out this way
Revenge loves company, three makes it a crowd
So wash your mouth, sit this one out

And I'm down,
Down but definitely not out (definitely not out)
Yeah, why did you call me again?
I bet I bet we don't make it (I bet we don't make it)
Cause I never take advice from my (friends)
Friends in very high places
They're only making bets to themselves,
Selves they're very, very selfish,
We'll keep you in mind in the end

Underdog, just look at the mess you made
It's such a shame, a shame
We had to find out this way
Revenge loves company, three makes it a crowd
So wash your mouth, sit this one out
