They say that problems come
come in pairs and I am number one
so take a look at your friends
Oh Envy is a terrible thing
Oh you, you're so smart,
so smart you that didn't call my bluff
Oh you should, should just run.

If you run
If you run

If you run away you won't stay
and that's so cool,
Is it like you wanted it to
(Are you scared?)
Sing, take it away take it away
it's easy to stay, easy to stay
when you know everything

Stop
You had us all convinced
you were something, something you couldn't miss
But what did we really miss?
you say..
you'll give it up, and you'll give it up away,
you'll give it and give it up away,
give it up, give it up, give it away

If you run
If you run

If you run away you won't stay
and that's so cool
Is it like you wanted it to
(Are you scared?)
Sing, take it away take it away
it's so easy to stay, easy to stay
when you know everything
ohhhh....

I've got one good reason to keep you on your feet
I got another in the back, home in the seat. [x4]

I've got one good reason to keep you on your feet
I got another in the back, home in the seat. [x4]

You're so cool (Woo!)

You run around, just running your mouth
About your hometown, that's booing you know,
but you're so cool, you're so cool oh.
