Yeah we are
Talking about
Plastic girls,
With egotistic guys
Oh yeah talking about
It looks void
Oh how we lie
So you can
Brace yourself that
Oh this is...
(This is just a waste of time!)

And tongue and cheek
I'm naive
Can't you please
Stay with me

Breath in, breath out
Well let's do something different
Breath in, breath out
(Can you taste it yet? Can you taste it yet?)
Breath in, breath out
Well let's do something different
Breath in, breath out
(Can you taste it yet? Can you taste it yet?)

What do you think of me? Yeah!
Nothing to you anymore
Here's some words
Write down
To give to you so you know what you've lost

Tongue and cheek
I'm naive
(I'm naive)
Can't you please
(Please)
Stay with me

Breath in, breath out
Well let's do something different
Breath in, breath out
Breath in, breath out
(I've got your courage...)
Let's do something different
(I've got your courage... Just the same song)
Breath in, breath out

On and on
It's just the same old song we're singing
On and on, just the same
On and on
It's just the same old song we're singing
On and on, just the same
On and on
It's just the same old song we're singing
On and on, just the same

On and on
It's just the same old song we're singing
On and on
(On and on)
Just the same
