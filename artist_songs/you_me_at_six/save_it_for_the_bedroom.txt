Keep your hands to yourself, these lips belong to someone else
And you know that you, will never get on it, it
Keep your lies to yourself, every lie I've heard from someone else
And you know that you, you'll never get on it.

Well I sussed you good, you knew I would
Oh haven’t you heard you're just another mark on my shirt
Another night and another girl
Oh well I taste so good
You knew I would

So who's keeping score on who is a whore
With you by my side, that look in your eyes
I hope you don't

Go home and wash your jeans, 'cause there's dirt on the knees
And jealously doesn’t sit with me
You love, I love you too, below the waist I’ll start charging you,
'Cause that’s just how the players play the game
And my winning streak, is missing.

So who's keeping score on who is a whore
With you by my side, that look in your eye
I hope you don't

So who's keeping score on who is a whore
With you by my side, that look in your eye
I hope you don't

You whore.

Save it for, save it for the bedroom
Save it for, save it for the bedroom
(Save it for, save it for the bedroom, save it for, save it for the bedroom)
[5x]

Well save it for the...
Save it for the bedroom
Oh, I'll save it for the...
Save it for the bedroom
