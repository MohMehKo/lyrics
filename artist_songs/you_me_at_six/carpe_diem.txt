We sat outside 'til we were numb
Two Coronas and limes and our thoughts.
We talked of our life and how far we'd come.
It took a while, but we waited for the sun.

Carpe diem 'til the very end.
I have no regrets.
Carpe diem 'til the bitter end.

Do you know, when you get old, you'll look back and sweeten your soul?
You took me apart to see inside.
You took me away to feel the life.
We're California dreaming.

Carpe diem 'til the very end.
I have no regrets.
Carpe diem 'til the bitter end. (You know)
Carpe diem 'til the very end.
I have no regrets.
Carpe diem 'til the bitter end.

Oh, everybody knows you're a risk worth taking.
Option worth attention.
I can't figure this one out for now.

It's carpe diem till the very end.
I have no regrets.

[2x]
Carpe diem 'til the very end.
I have no regrets.
Carpe diem 'til the bitter end. (You know)
