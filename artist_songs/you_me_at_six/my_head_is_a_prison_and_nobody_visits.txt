I wrote this song, just to piss you off
This is a war between my body and tongue
You think you got it
Come, show us what you've got

I move away and watch you move through the walls
If this is a game, then I'll sit out
Everyone's a winner
With a heart that small

Keep me up, keep me up
Oh I won't sleep tonight
These rules were made so long
And you know they're right

I saw her coming like a storm
I saw her come like I did before
The weight of the world is on my shoulders
But I just need someone else to hold it

And I don't know why we're here
Is it to love of love and fear
Everyone's a winner
With a heart that small

Keep me up, keep me up
Oh I won't sleep tonight
These rules were made so long
And you know they're right

Give her up, give her up
Cause you're gonna die tonight
She'll lead you on, spit you out
Just to prove that she is right

And I know it was wrong to lie
But I need you to keep us alive
So if you and I collide
Which one of us
Which one of us
Will survive?

Keep me up, keep me up
Oh I won't sleep tonight
These rules were made so long
And you know they're right

Give her up, give her up
Cause you're gonna die tonight
She'll lead you on, spit you out
Just to prove that she is right

Oh we know, we know it's right
We know
Know, we know it's right
And it's right

Know, we know it's right
We know
Know, we know it's right
And it's right
