All those dirty words that you said, did you mean it, did you now.
You're biting at the hand that feeds you, like a stray for some scraps.
Everybody you once knew has turned their backs.
And everyone that you once loved has sold you out.

Everyone I know, they faked it from the word go and I need to know why.
That everyone I love has been swimming with the sharks and I don't know why.

Does defeat leave a taste in your mouth, one that you could live without
Everyone that you once knew has turned their backs.
And everyone that you once loved has sold you out.

So tell me how does it feel?
