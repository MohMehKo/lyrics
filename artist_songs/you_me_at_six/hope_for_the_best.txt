Where the hell are all my friends.
We used to live for the weekends.
We don't live twice, just let that sink in.
I said where the hell are the good old days.
The days we didn't need a stage.
Just to have a room that's full of fakes.

Oh I hope for the best
I prepare for the worst
If you were in my shoes,
You would know, you would know how it felt.

You're always there for the highs, and never for the lows.
You always focus on my cons, and never on my pros (never on my pros).
You've got to keep the dream alive, or else it will die.
I long for the simple days when things were less contrived.

Oh I hope for the best
I prepare for the worst
If you were in my shoes, you would know, you would know how it felt.

And I don't know how, yeah I don't know how.
We're gonna make it through this, gonna make it through this.
Oh I don't know how, oh I don't know how.
We're gonna make it through this,
Gonna make it through.

Oh I hope for the best
I prepare for the worst
If you were in my shoes, you would know, you would know how it felt.
You would know, you would know how it felt.
