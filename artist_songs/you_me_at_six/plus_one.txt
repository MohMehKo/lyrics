Wait up, for my call
Cause I want, it all
I've chased for so long
My time has come

I don't say much
With poise or grace
I'll come of age
In this town on this...

Day
Is the wrong time, the wrong place
To say this to your face

Come close, come here
Come loud and come clear
That look in your eye
Says you're mine on this...

Day
The wrong time, the wrong place
To say this to your face
But I want you and I need you
Every single night and day

Keep your, keep your cool
You hold the cards
You make the rules

And I want you and I need you
Every single night and day
The right time, the right place
To say this to your face
And I want and I need you
Every single night and day
