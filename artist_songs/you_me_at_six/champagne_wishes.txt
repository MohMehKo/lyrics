Champagne Wishes for everyone this year
A toast to the cynics as they claim free cheers
Small minds don't daydream as big as you or me
If this is the last straw let's all live in scrutiny.

[Chorus]
There's nothing left, so why should we care?
Forward with haste and back with regret
There's nothing left, so why should we care?
Forward with haste and back with regret we're all lost
We are all lost, we are all lost, we are all lost, we have all lost our minds.

Champagne Wishes for those who don't feel missed
Lonely islands with no one to confide in
I've not given up yet, this is in the air...

[Chorus x2]
There's nothing left, so why should we care?
Forward with haste and back with regret
There's nothing left, so why should we care?
Forward with haste and back with regret we're all lost
We are all lost, we are all lost, we are all lost, we have all lost our minds.
