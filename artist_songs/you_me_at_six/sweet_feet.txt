Save your breath
And I'll talk instead
And you'll just drop dead and stay away from me

You've got me wrapped around your fingers
But I've got you figured out
And I'm down but not out

She said, love is, love is for the blind
And you gave yours without your eyes
So why is more shy?

I hate to say I told you so
You're never gonna let this go
With every little look she gave and every move she made
She's got you on the tip of your toes.

Catch your breath
I know you're upset
But I am resilient
To end this test

I got you down
Into a silence
And I've got evidence
That your down and your out

She said, love is, love is for the blind
And you gave yours without your eyes
So why is more shy?

I hate to say I told you so
Your never gonna let this go
With every little look she gave and every move she made
She's got you on the tip of your toes.

You know, this is how it goes
Nothing lasts forever
That you should know
And how it shows
You on the ropes
You feel so low
Just know, I am with you

Hate to say I told you so
I'm never gonna let this go
With every little look I'll give
And every move I make

I hate to say I told you so
You're never gonna let this go
With every little look she gives and every move she made
She's got you on the tip of your toes
(Oh oh oh oh oh whoa whoa)
On the tip of your toes
(Oh oh oh oh oh whoa whoa)
(Oh oh oh oh oh whoa)
(Oh oh oh oh oh whoa whoa)
(Oh oh oh oh oh whoa)
