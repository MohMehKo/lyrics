This is the calm before the storm,
Three words through your bedroom door.
And everybody knows that,
It is the place to start.

Why say something safe,
When I can blow you away.
It's a game only liars play,
Stop swinging above your weight.

So take off
All of your clothes.
There ain't no shame of taking names,
My heart isn't in the home.

So take off
All of your clothes.
There ain't no shame of taking names,
My heart isn't in the home.

This is a stab in the back,
That I have been waiting for,
You've had me running in circles,
Loosing my head at all costs.

And it isn't a secret,
If you can't keep it.
So I disguise the lie,
Cut you down, down to size.

So take off
All of your clothes.
There ain't no shame of taking names,
My heart isn't in the home.

So take off
All of your clothes.
There ain't no shame of taking names,
My heart isn't in the home.

Cowards are golden,
And I know the words hurt.
Bones we can fix,
And lessons we'll learn.

Cowards are golden,
And I know the words hurt.
Bones we can fix,
The lessons we'll learn.

Cowards are golden,
Cowards are golden,
Cowards are golden,
Cowards are golden,

Cowards are golden,
And I know the words hurt.
Bones we can fix,
The lessons we'll learn.

Cowards are golden,
And I know the words hurt.
Bones we can fix,
The lessons we'll learn.

You mean more.
You mean more.
You mean more.
You mean more.
