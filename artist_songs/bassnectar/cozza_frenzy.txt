Automatic when we
Splatter data in the
20 double bins up front
Cozza frenzy

Automatic when we
Splatter data in the
20-20
Double-double
Bins up front

Shoot beams
Lightening
Laser
Blinding
Taser
Mic fiend
Melting in rhyme schemes
Spittin' hype things
As I ignite things
Tryna do the right thing
Phaser
Tightening

When we bend the
Waves in a frenzy
All night day dreams
Bangin' on 18's
Sneak a poem in dirty zones
Super soaked in honeycomb
Hologram or telephone
Coming out your speaker cones
