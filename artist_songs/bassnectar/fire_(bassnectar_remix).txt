When I think you do right
You're so wrong
You speaks words of I love you
But you know how to break me
So come and take me

Wanna play in your fire
Wanna play in your fire 
I keep playing with fire and fire
I keep playing with fire

I keep burning down
I keep burning down

When it gets too bright
I get lost
Sometimes I feel like I'm falling
But I know how to break you
So let me take you

Wanna play in your fire
Wanna play in your fire
I keep playing with fire and fire
I keep playing with fire

I keep playing with fire and fire
I keep playing with fire
I keep playing with fire

I keep burning down
I keep burning down
I keep burning down
I keep burning down
