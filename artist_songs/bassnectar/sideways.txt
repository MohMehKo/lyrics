Yeah, yeah, yeah
I tell 'em we can do it all day
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I tell 'em we can do it all day

I tell 'em we can do it all day, all night, all type
When I alight, take flight when I like
That mega hype vibrate your satellite
Everyday is a Friday, living in my life
God-like, mega-bright, so make room
The 8's boom, big-up tunes to zoom to
We bust through shortcuts and highways
Time flies by in a daze, it's got me seeing sideways

It's got me seeing sideways
It's got me seeing sideways
It's got me seeing sideways
Time flies by in a daze, it's got me seeing sideways
It's got me seeing sideways...
