I, I, I, I, I do what I wanna do wanna do what I...
I, I, I, I, I do what I wanna do (wanna) what I what I want.
I, I, I, I, I do what I wanna do wanna do what I...
I do what I wanna do, I do what I like.
[x2]

[CHORUS:]
I do what I wanna do that's all that ever matter.
Never been one to chase what those other people been after.
Fame mean nothing to me, their names mean nothing to me, so if you saying I've changed, it's clear that you never knew me.
I do what I wanna do, I do what I like, I do what I like, I do what I like.
I do what I wanna do, I do what I like, you get with my crew so we can ride all night. (all night, all night, all night, all night...)

MAKE SOME NOISE. NOOOISE. [x6]

[CHORUS]

MAKE SOME NOISE. NOOOISE. [x3]

Druuuunk Heavyweight.
Lorin's in the place.
Let it crash like a million tons.

No rest for the wicked.
It's always ridiculous.
Never out done.

We gone to correctional.
Strictly professional.
Multi-directional, style
Aiming straight for your head.

We think the unthinkable.
Sink the unsinkable.
Break the unbreakable.
Keep it going crazy in here.

[CHORUS]
