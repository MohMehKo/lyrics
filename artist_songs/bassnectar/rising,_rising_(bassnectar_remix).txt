Lift up your eyes
Lift up your arms
Lift up your eyes
Lift up your arms

I'll untie you
From the strings caught in your wings
And I'll try to fill in the gaps, all of the cracks
They left behind

I'll untie you
From the strings caught in your wings
And I'll try to fill in the gaps, all of the cracks
They left behind

I'll untie you
From the strings caught in your wings
And I'll try to fill in the gaps, all of the cracks
They left behind
