You know we came to get down
You know we came to get down
You know we came to get down
You know we came to get down

Look, let’s level up
Pedal to the metal when I play the cut
Doing double time like Double Dutch
They a dime a dozen so I double up
These late nights finna pay off
Won’t take flight, no days off
My blood pumpin', my blades sharp
Young save her, tryna save her
You feel the music 'til the mind fade back
Comin' with the Bassnectar beside they back
Part another plan where ya find me at
With a limelight past I’ll be right, right back
These late nights, take flight
No days off, take flight
My blood pumpin', my blades sharp
Young save her tryna save her

You know we get down
You know we came to get down
You know we came to get down
You know we came to get down
