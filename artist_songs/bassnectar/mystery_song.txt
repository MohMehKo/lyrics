Ride up in a mystery
Voices in my head
Asking for an answer but they question me instead
Cover all that pretty sound
Danger up ahead
One more and you'll get it
So I'll follow you instead

If you want it
You can taste it
Lalalala
If you need it
You gotta chase it
Lalalala
If you want it
You can taste it
Lalalala
If you need it
You gotta chase it
Lalalala
Lalalala

Caught up in a mystery
No one to attend
Back in the beginning
But she started at the end
Blinded by a century
Dodging any threat
Pulled in all directions but it's too late to forget

If you want it
You can taste it
Lalalala
If you need it
You gotta chase it
Lalalala
