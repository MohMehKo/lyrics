I had a way then losing it all on my own
I had a heart then the Queen has been overthrown
And I'm not sleeping now, the dark is too hard to beat
And I'm not keeping now, the strength I need to push me

You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone

'Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home.
Calling, calling, calling home
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone

I had a way then losing it all on my own
I had a heart then the Queen has been overthrown
And I'm not sleeping now, the dark is too hard to beat
And I'm not keeping now, the strength I need to push me

You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone

'Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home.
Calling, calling, calling home
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone

Show the lights that [2x]

You show the lights that stop me turn a stone
