I wanna see the future
I wanna follow to the edge
I wanna stay forever
Hit so good, gonna knock you out

Inhale endlessly
Chase the memory
Feel the melody
Need the remedy

Inhale endlessly
Chase the memory
Feel the melody
Take control and I'm
Dreaming

I wanna see the future
I wanna take you all the way
I wanna make it louder
Hit so good, gonna knock me out

Inhale endlessly
Chase the memory
Feel the melody
Need the remedy

Inhale endlessly
Chase the memory
Feel the melody
Take control and I'm
Dreaming
