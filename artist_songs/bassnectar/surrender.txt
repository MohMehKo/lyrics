From the moment you dream
It's not always as it seems
If you still believe
It's all you'll need

When you give, you feel more alive
When you love, you step into the light
Standing on the edge, you are part of me
And you leave the past behind

Let it all align, let it all
Let it all align, let it all
Let it all, all
Let it all align, let it all

In the end, time is like the night
In the might, time is like the light
Send the message out, like an echo
Orbiting, like a satellite

Let it all align, let it all
Let it all align, let it all
Let it all, all
Let it all align, let it all
