The light came back, back into my life again
I believe I can't find the ceiling
And I love you people, but for real
Fuck you people, I've had it up to here

If you so much as look at me wrong
I'm coming down on your head and your home, count on it
I'll protect every fire I've built with my life, with my life

Talk is cheap, but not that cheap; I believe I can fly
I'm kicking up dirt, pulling down trees one by one
Cause the youth of today are still asking for favors
They can't figure out why everyone hates us
When I'm light, alright, I'll defend everyone, every friend
Even when I'm tired

If you so much as look at me wrong
I'm coming down on your head and your home, count on it
I'll protect every fire I've built with my life, with my life

Do you know what I mean?
Cause it means the world to me
Do you know what I mean?
Cause it means the world to me
Do you know what I mean?
Cause it means the world to me
Do you know what I mean?
Cause it means the world to me

Don't flinch, count to three
And throw me down the stairs please
Don't flinch, count to three
And throw me down the stairs please
Don't flinch, count to three
And throw me down the stairs please
Don't flinch, count to three
And throw me down the stairs please
And throw me down the stairs please!
