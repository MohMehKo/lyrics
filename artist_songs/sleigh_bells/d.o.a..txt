Wipe the blood from your nose
how come nobody knows
how the chorus should go
how the chorus should go
how come nobody knows

do you know how it feels
when the rain hits the roof
but the roof of your mouth
it’s not wet anymore

put the one by the two
cut the rest into lines
but there’s blood on the door
and you’re feeling just fine
but you ran out of time

wipe the blood from your nose
how come nobody knows
how the chorus should go
remember who you are
