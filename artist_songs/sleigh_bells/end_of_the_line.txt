The nightmare lies in the mourning
when the birds are bleeding
and you hope the day will come
but you’re never gonna live this down

wish it away with the blame
you could just stop breathing now
you didn’t want it enough
and you tap and you cut
and you start with the heavy breathing
you’re parallel to the dark
but they’re still not leaving
but you try and talk
you’ll do anything but you’re never gonna keep it down
don’t leave me now, don’t leave me now

[chorus:]
it didn’t have to be this way
you know it didn’t have to be
but it’s the end of the line
so goodbye

can you hear me
can you see me
well it’s the end of the line
so goodbye

now you talk to yourself
and you wonder why nothing ever changes
how you’re gonna fall so far so fast
who you gonna blame this on
I don’t care anymore in the morning
when the birds start bleeding now
and it’s all the same

I was faced to the wall
with the mirror crashing down
and you stood so tall
but you fall and you’re never gonna get back up
you didn’t want it enough
am I central now, am I central now I was central how

[chorus:]
it didn’t have to be this way
you know it didn’t have to be
but it’s the end of the line
so goodbye

can you hear me
can you see me
well it’s the end of the line
so goodbye

no one loves you
up above you
no one hears you
no one sees you

no one loves you
up above you
no one hears you
no one sees you

[chorus:]
it didn’t have to be this way
you know it didn’t have to be
but it’s the end of the line
so goodbye

can you hear me
can you see me
well it’s the end of the line
so goodbye
