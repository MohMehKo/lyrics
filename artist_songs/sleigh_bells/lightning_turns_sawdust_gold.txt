If you count to ten
I'll show you how to shake the pain like it's cinnamon
Draw a line in the sand
Watch me put a batter in it like silver and lightning

I was dreaming of a dead-end street that we used to run down
I was dreaming of a dead-end street that we used to run down
I was dreaming of a dead-end street that we used to run down

We are running around 'till our hearts break down
There's no need for that now
We're all running around 'till our hearts break down

Take a deep breath before you do something drastic
Knocking off heads with your military tactics
Red blood versus plastic
You reach the ground and shatter

I was dreaming of a dead-end street that we used to run down
I was dreaming of a dead-end street that we used to run down
I was dreaming of a dead-end street that we used to run down

We are running around 'till our hearts break down
There's no need for that now
We're all running around 'till our hearts break down
There's no need for that now

Like silver and lightning
Like silver and lightning
Like silver and lightning
Like silver right into the ground
