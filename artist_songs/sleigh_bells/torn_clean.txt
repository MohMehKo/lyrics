Torn clean, ooh, torn clean

Just like we're running please downhill
Spring clean believe
I love you, striptease, please me
Get beneath me or above me
I love both, all of it, everything
Damn, I love these in front of me
It's all in front of me
It's so breezy
It's so easy
Get beneath me or above me
I love both, all of it, everything
