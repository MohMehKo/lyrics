Take a picture at the Gallows Pole
The Atlantic below
Cause we're singing on a sinking ark
Getting ready to go
Then it's bombs away every day
Swinging like a baseball bat
I hate to be the one to tell you this
But, somebody's got to say it

This one fights sociopaths
This one fights the Devil
Another day, a torrent of disappointment
Ripping through my mind

Most of the time damnations and accusations
Drift in and out of view
Pointed at me, pointed at you
Whatever happened to the era I imagined?

Fuck all your lips and your cheekbones
Whatever happened to the era I imagined?
Fuck all your lips and your cheekbones
Whatever happened to the era I imagined?
I can't even begin to express my distress
Fuck all your lips and your cheekbones
Whatever happened to the era I imagined?

What went wrong nowhere, man?
The sun came up, a tragedy
All around, don't look down
Chin up, bravery
Where is the era of strength and integrity?
Don't look down

You can't go back the way you came
Full speed ahead
You can't go back the way you came
Full speed ahead
