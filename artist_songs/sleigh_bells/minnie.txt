[Verse 1:]
Gossip on heavy today
Let it crash on the cake and they call it
Led by the violent days
Shorty want a taste of the models
It's getting all over your face
Put a break in the gas like a devil
Sick of my name, disgraced
You can't be proud if you gonna lay down

[Bridge:]
Minnie, Minnie go count your pennies
I'm sorry to say you don't have many
Minnie, Minnie go count your pennies
I'm sorry to say you don't have any

[Hook:]
God save you, I'm a demon
Heartbreaker, not a looser
Minnie, rebel
Minnie, rebel
God save you, I'm a demon
Heartbreaker, not a looser
Minnie, rebel
Minnie, rebel

[Verse 2:]
So girls crowding in the rain
Cause you're sitting by the window pane
Tired of the violent grace
Sneak fear in their hearts like a devil
And if it comes to this, well then it comes to this
Minnie, you can be a big
You and me could be the dream team
Minnie, you can be a big

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Outro:]
Minnie, rebel
Minnie, rebel
Minnie, rebel
Minnie, rebel
