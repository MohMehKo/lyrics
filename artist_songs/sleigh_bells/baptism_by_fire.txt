Heart
I wanna listen, I wanna listen to your
Heart
I wanna listen, I wanna listen to your
Heart
I wanna listen, I wanna listen to your
Heart
I wanna listen, I wanna listen to your

A black cloud rolls over and offers its soul
A lack of faith in love is shown
A cruel satire of rock and roll
Soulful, cheap, and rightly so
Go, get in line
Get the chemical kids flipped their lids
Became one with the katydids
And if you die, I might be dead a long time

Every second I waste is a second to hate
But time slips away with nothing to say
I don't know where you are headed
Maybe to Hell, maybe to Heaven
The situation is desperate
Never mind your intentions
Oh, o-oh, o-oh

When you love something so much
Almost nothing can't go wrong
You better take my advice while I'm calm still
When your dream is made of everything you're afraid of

Hold on, cause you're the definition of brave
But when you're focused, you could put a laser to shame
But you forgot about the rules of the game
You can learn about the meaning of pain
Go the wrong way down memory lane
Don't take machetes to the sugar cane
Sleepwalker woke up you were never the same

I see the judges all drown, just drunk on context
Still my eyes went up and down the index
Head's up, but my mind's all cloudy
Jet black and blue like Windex
It's dark out there
Oh, o-oh, o-oh

When you love something so much
Almost nothing can't go wrong
You better take my advice while I'm calm still
When your dream is made of everything you're afraid of

Heart
I wanna listen, I wanna listen to your
Heart
I wanna listen, I wanna listen to your

You can scream at the wall, like a basket case
But when your casket waits, become depraved
Hold on

Heart
I wanna listen, I wanna listen to your
Heart
I wanna listen, I wanna listen to your
Heart
I wanna listen, I wanna listen to your
Heart
I wanna listen, I wanna listen to your

When you love something so much
Almost nothing can't go wrong
You better take my advice while I'm calm still
When your dream is made of everything you're afraid of
