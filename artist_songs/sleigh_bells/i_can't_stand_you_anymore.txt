I've got excuses for days
I'm borderline so you noticed
With every move that you make
I'm well aware of your methods
You are distant and cold
The excessive rapture that shutters me
Attraction, distractin'
Permanent in rays of oblivion

Bombs don't compare to the trouble you bring me
I just can't stand you anymore
You're killing me, but I'm killing me too
I just can't stand you anymore
I just can't stand you...

Confession!
I'm manic and breathless
It's exhausting, I'm digressing
Sometimes I cease to exist
So why even bother?
Who died and made you boss?
Because there's no one there, the stakes are so high
Attraction, distractin'
Why do you do this to me?

Bombs don't compare to the trouble you bring me
I just can't stand you anymore
You're killing me, but I'm killing me too
I just can't stand you anymore
Bombs don't compare to the trouble you bring me
I just can't stand you anymore
You're killing me, but I'm killing me too
I just can't stand you anymore
I just can't stand you...

I said it wrong, I fucked it all up
But you know what I mean, yeah you know what I mean
Came out all wrong
Sometimes we come out all wrong
Cause I was blind half of the time
I realize the fault is all mine

Bombs don't compare to the trouble you bring me
I just can't stand you anymore
You're killing me, but I'm killing me too
I just can't stand you anymore
Bombs don't compare to the trouble you bring me
I just can't stand you anymore
You're killing me, but I'm killing me too
I just can't stand you anymore
I just can't stand you...
