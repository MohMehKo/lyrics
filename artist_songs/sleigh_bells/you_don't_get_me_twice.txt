[Pre Chorus:]
You don't get me twice
I got your heart in a vice
You don't get me twice
I got your heart on ice
You don't get me

Are you telling lies with your pretty eyes?
You're in a trouble, yeah
You don't get me twice
Are you telling lies with your pretty eyes?
You're in a trouble, yeah
You don't get me twice

You don't get me twice
You don't get me

[Chorus:]
Twenty, twenty three
Twenty, twenty, twenty three
Twenty, twenty three
Twenty, twenty, twenty three
Twenty, twenty three
Twenty, twenty, twenty three
You can't find me, the American dream

[Verse 1:]
It started storming, storming
So early in the morning
It started storming, storming
So early in the morning

I receive no warning, now that's heart warming
Alright, the weather's boring
Well, let me tell you a story

[Pre Chorus:]
You don't get me twice
I'll get your heart on ice
You don't get me twice
I'll get your heart on ice
You don't get me

[Chorus:]
Twenty, twenty three
Twenty, twenty, twenty three
Twenty, twenty three
Twenty, twenty, twenty three
Twenty, twenty three
Twenty, twenty, twenty three
You can't find me, the American dream

[Breakdown:]
If you can't fine me, the American dream
If you can't fine me, the American dream
If you can't fine me, the American dream
If you can't fine me, the American dream

[Verse 2:]
Don't you ever think it could be considered a sin
I hope you fasten me in to blow another hole in
It's the position I'm in and I'm telling you
Please lock the truth, you know I gotta
Don't do anything, could be considered a sin
I hope you fasten me in to blow another hole in
It's the position I'm in and I'm telling you
Please lock the truth, you know I gotta

[Outro:]
Maybe, just maybe
Maybe if you ask me
Maybe, just maybe, baby
Maybe if you ask me nice
