[Verse 1:]
When I heard youre still alright
I must admit, I laughed, I cried
I found a stranger to act out
I tell the truth, oh leave me down
I've lived my only tale or die
I cut my bangs so short I sighed
But dear, love is a contact sport
Doing bunny hops and Ill never stop

[Chorus:]
If you, could you? would you?
Just because you can doesn't mean you should
Is that understood? Oh oh
If you, could you? would you?
Just because you can doesn't mean you should
Is that understood?

[Verse 2:]
Terminator X and you're snapping the necks
Running down the street, always chasing boys there
Love sucked, love sucked
He gave up up up up
Just a nowhere to go, I was feeling just fine
Now I'm burning, cause you cut me in line
Love sucked, love sucked
He gave up up up up

[Chorus:]
If you, could you? would you?
Just because you can doesn't mean you should
Is that understood? Oh oh
If you, could you? would you?
Just because you can doesn't mean you should
Is that understood?

[Breakdown:]
The pleasure of your company
Look what its done to me
The pleasure of your company
Look what its done to me

There's a heart in my chest
Where a hole used to be
There's a hole in my chest
Where a heart used to be

I'm sending gummy bears to the electric chair
