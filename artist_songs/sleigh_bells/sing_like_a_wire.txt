[Verse 1:]
Static in the sentence, static in the dirt
Singing like a hunter, shaking, I go wild
Burn your body, I can see your burning fire
They sing everything

[Hook:]
Sing like a wire
Sing like a wire

[Verse 2:]
Sleep for a while, you can sleep beside the fire
Dreamed I was a hunter with a never ending thirst
By the middle of July you were buried in the dirt
Looking in the dark, saying your goodbyes
Looking in the dark, saying your goodbyes
We sing everything

[Hook]

[Breakdown:]
We're down in the mix
Let me hear the kicks
We're down in the mix
Let me hear the kicks
We're down in the mix
Let me hear the kicks
We're down in the mix

[Hook x4]
