Starting line
Now I'm really, really racing
Stepping on throats, clipping the knees
All that flesh and blood
The real thing
I can see the sun
Going down so rapidly

Free of wreckage
Down below licking streets
I believe deeply
In decency (indecency)
And when I'm conscious, I am cursed
Shark teeth the size of pick-up trucks
All that flesh and blood
The real thing

And when you die
I wanna die, I wanna die with you
And lay us down for good
And lay us down for good

Still torn down by a symphony
I need something warm
Like jet blast
Cool breeze, cool G
I'm having a hard time
Remembering what's important to me
A lifetime just waiting around
For moments like these
(A lifetime just waiting around)
For moments like these
(A lifetime waiting around)
For moments like these

And when you die
I wanna die, I wanna die with you
And lay us down for good
And lay us down for good

And when you die
I wanna die, I wanna die with you
And lay us down for good
And lay us down for good

All that flesh and blood
The real thing
All that flesh and blood
The real thing
All that flesh and blood
The real thing
All that flesh and blood
The real thing
