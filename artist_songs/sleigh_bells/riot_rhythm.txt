You've got a smart best friend, she's OK
Have you had a smile today
Push the door and take your seats
I've been seen playin' for keeps

Dear heart, don't stop fighting
Prepare, ride the lightning
It's like heart-heart-heartbeat
Just like banging rhythm

You've gotta march!
ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
ah ah ah ah ah ah ah

You've gotta march!
ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
ah ah ah ah ah ah ah

You've got a smart best friend and she's OK
Have you ever felt that way
Straight A kids like a treat
She stands up and takes the heat

Dear heart, don't stop fighting
Prepare, ride the lightning
It's like heart-heart-heartbeat
Just like banging rhythm

You've gotta march
ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
You've gotta march
ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
