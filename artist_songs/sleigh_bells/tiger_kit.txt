[Verse 1:]
I was fastening in, I was dealt a dream
I was thinking in symmetry
Tiger found you there, cause I kept you there
Seeing double, believe me
Tearing down walls if you put on that ring
And the center were races, but they do you no favors
Looked up in the scene, you're a delicate thing

[Hook:]
You're gonna jump, like a detour, in front of all of these people
Oh, how sorry life is, like a Hollywood sequel
You think you'll land on your feet but you'll die in the streets
Look away, look away, oh, just go back to sleep

[Verse 2:]
We were in the kitchen and the famous killer's face
Thanks for the memories, I might remember these
When they stand in the water and threw out the dice
Thanks for the memories, I might remember these
Never trust a tiger can't be tamed
Feeling under the weather, can you keep it together
Is that your sister's beretta cause you're light as a feather

[Hook]

[Outro:]
Music's just the tiger can't be tamed
Music's just the tiger, can't be tamed
Music's just the tiger, can't be tamed
So make like a banana and split
