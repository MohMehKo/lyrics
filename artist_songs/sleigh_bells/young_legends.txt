[Verse:]
Stop and you can hope that you want it
Stop and try, open a quick stop
Shopping out, talking about war
Why you gotta be like
Love lost without the captain
Take your time, you always act like
I'm just knocking at your door
Will you be around now

[Hook:]
Young legends die all the time
But I don't mind, don't close your eyes
Don't say goodbye, I'll be your kind
Don't do it, don't do it
Young legends die all the time
But I don't mind, don't close your eyes
Don't say goodbye, I know you'll try
Young legends die and so will

[Verse:]
Stop, you had everything counted
You never doubted, 
one, two, three, only a day away
Where you gonna go now?
Shut me down, got to let go
Underground we'll last forever
So if [?] on your way down, let's go now

[Hook]

[Breakdown:]
Young legends die
Young legends die
Young legends die all the time
Young legends die all the time

[Hook:]
Young legends die all the time
But I don't mind, don't close your eyes
Don't say goodbye, I'll be your kind
Don't do it, don't do it
Young legends die all the time
But I don't mind, don't close your eyes
Don't say goodbye, I know you'll try
Young legends die and so will

And so will
And so will
And so will
