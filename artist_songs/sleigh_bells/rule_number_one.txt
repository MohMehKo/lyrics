Two tornadoes touch down in Kansas
Instinct takes over, instinct commands us
Mostly O.K., but I'm bleeding profusely
Mostly O.K., but only on Tuesdays

The six other days I'm pacing the ring
Ripping down stars while I deal with this thing
God only knows the hell that I chose
Ripping down stars while I stand on my toes

Two tornadoes touch down in Kansas
Instinct takes over, instinct commands us
Stare at the moon in a memory lapse
Wind up the clock, total collapse

Pop rocks and coke make your head explode
Pop rocks and coke make your head explode

From the field I can see you in the stands
Drinking lemonade spinning like a ceiling fan
So haunting, so confusing
Ice cream is goose, Linus and Lucy

Rule number one can't escape my throat
Pop rocks and coke make your head explode

Two tornadoes touch down in Kansas
Instinct takes over, instinct commands us
Mostly O.K., but I'm bleeding profusely
Mostly O.K., but only on Tuesdays

The six other days I'm pacing the ring
Ripping down stars while I deal with this thing
God only knows the hell that I chose
Ripping down stars while I stand on my toes!
(Stand on my toes)
Stand on my toes!
Ripping down stars while I stand on my toes!
(Stand on my toes)
Stand on my toes!

From the field I can see you in the stands
Drinking lemonade spinning like a ceiling fan
So haunting, so confusing
Ice cream is goose, Linus and Lucy

(But Derek..)
It's Monday night
And you're high as a kite watching Lion King
You can't feel a thing, but your knee hurts
Heartbeats are speeding by

It's the fight of your life
Are you proud of yourself?
Are you doubting yourself?
Are you proud of yourself?

You lost it, bought a rifle, took it home
Put it in the corner of your closet
But it's not on your mind yet, oh no
No it's not on your mind yet

I'm gonna stand on my toes ripping stars down
There will be no end to my rainmaking
I'm gonna stand on my toes ripping stars down
There will be no end to my rainmaking

It's the fight of your life
Are you proud of yourself?
Are you doubting yourself?
Are you proud of yourself?
