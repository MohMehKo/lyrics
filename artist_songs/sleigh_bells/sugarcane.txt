[Verse:]
So so sleeping on the ground tonight
I couldn't breathe so I had two of these
Sugarcane bounce the same when it touches the heat, when it touches the heat

Hurricane always came when the seasons complete
I was late, whyd you step back? You were already there
You could take from the lead but you don't even care

[Pre-Chorus 1:]
I've attempted but become so desperate to win
We only talk about your damn charades
I've attempted but become so desperate to win
We only talk about your damn charades

[Pre-Chorus 2:]
The grass may be greener but you can't even smell
How did the king included you?
The grass may be greener but you can't even smell
How did the king included you?

[Chorus:]
Beware, beware
Beware, beware
Beware, beware
Beware

[Verse:]
Knock, knock, getting on your knees tonight
Kicking the boys, you want me back
But the dead was alive when I go to the beach
How could I leave? How could I leave?

Hurricane always came when the seasons complete
Yellow hair over there, now Ive got to compete
With a bang on the hand and there's something in the air

[Pre-Chorus 1:]
I've attempted but become so desperate to win
We only talk about your damn charades
I've attempted but become so desperate to win
We only talk about your damn charades

[Pre-Chorus 2:]
The grass may be greener but you can't even smell
How did the king included you?
The grass may be greener but you can't even smell
How did the king included you?

[Chorus x2:]
Beware, beware
Beware, beware
Beware, beware
Beware, beware
