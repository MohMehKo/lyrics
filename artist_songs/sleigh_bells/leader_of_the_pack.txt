Do you remember when
you used to sleep at night
and when somebody dies
you see them lifting
but you know, you know
it’s not over

do you remember when
you had no need for lies
and now your mother cries
and nothing matters much
you know, you know
it’s not over

don’t you know
he’s never coming back again

do you remember when
you used to walk on by
and now your run and hide
pretend they never knew yo
know you, know that it’s over

don’t you know
he’s never coming back
don't you know
he’s never coming back again
