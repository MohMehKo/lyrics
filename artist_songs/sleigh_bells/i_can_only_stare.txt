I can only stare into the field for so long
I can only stare into the field for so long

Watching you from the chair
Dragging a brush through your hair
You're just right over there
You know I'm grieving, giving off heat, oh
Cross my heart, hope to die
You and I, you and I
Why aren't we sharing the breath
Till there's nothing left but carbon dioxide
Why won't you let me come over
And do what you want me to? Ooh

I can only stare, I can only stare
(You see, it's pulling my heart down, it's pulling my heart down)
I can only stare, I can only stare
(You see, it's pulling my heart down, it's pulling my heart down)
I'd like to go back there but again
I can only stare, I can only
I'd like to go back there but again
I can only stare, I can only

Do you know how I feel
Knocking on your door
Till my knuckles bleed?
I can't perform miracles
It's dedication time, oh oh oh

I can only stare, I can only stare
(You see, it's pulling my heart down, it's pulling my heart down)
I can only stare, I can only stare
(You see, it's pulling my heart down, it's pulling my heart down)
Will my knees buckle if my head
Never fully heals, never fully
Will my knees buckle if my head
Never fully heals, never fully
