[Verse 1:]
If you're sure you'll be
Show me a way
That's it, come now
I saw it just when you said it
The world is round
If you start to learn how to rise
I can go that high
If you start to run out of words
I can fill that time

[Pre-Chorus:]
The king you swore was wonderful
I felt the rise with bad lies
The king you swore was wonderful
I felt the rise with bad lies

[Chorus:]
Never could've known if you ever go because
Say that you love and you'll never love
Never could've known if you ever go because
Say that you love and you'll never love

[Verse 2:]
When their heads are turned dont say it
Not if you come down
Just a joke in the wind against all your family
When we teach a love
When you smile and you fell apart
I cannot fix that
That's your debt and you have to pay it
Just to have good fun

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Outro:]
And I could make him see
And I could make him see
And I could make him see
Until youre feeling alright
And I could make him see
And I could make him see
And I could make him see
Until youre feeling alright
And I could make him see
And I could make him see
And I could make him see
Until youre feeling alright
And I could make him see
And I could make him see
And I could make him see
