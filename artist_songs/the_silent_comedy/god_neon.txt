Hot nights, spot lights aren't saving souls.
Self-serve, no need for the self control. 
Oh, God neon, God neon knows.
God neon, God neon sold us all down the river.

Heel click, breeze whip off the limo door. 
Quick bop, whiff smoke, caught flash the bulb. 
Light every hole 
The city's always moving, city's got a lot it should be.
I know the grass is always greener but the city's got a hold on me.

God neon, God neon knows [x4]

Grip tight, smooth ride to the seventh floor. 
Drip rights, drip blood, drip ride the bull, as far as it'll go. 
City's always moving, city's got a lot it should be. 
I know the grass is always greener but the city's got a hold on me.

God neon, God neon knows [x8]

City's always moving, city's got a lot it should be.
(God neon, God neon knows)
City's always loosing, city's got a lot of [?]
(God neon, God neon knows)
City's always moving, city's got a lot it should be.
(God neon, God neon knows)
I know the grass is always greener but the city's got a hold on me.
