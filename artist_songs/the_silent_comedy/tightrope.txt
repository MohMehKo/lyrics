I was born on a tightrope, bright with hope and oblivious
I could not keep my eyes closed, now I know we are hideous
Grinning from ear to ear...

Take me away from here like you said
And I will be grateful with what I have left
Dance in the aisle for me and hold out your hand
And take me away my dear

I grew up in a lifeboat tied to shore by the winter wind
I was made to be set afloat not star of the show ever glittering
In center ring, not a clue...

Take me away from here like you said
And I will be grateful with what I have left
Dance in the aisle for me and hold out your hand
And take me away my dear

I am not at the end though, I wont go at the peak or near
I will die in a foxhole, arm to shoulder with atheist
Praying just, lord not here...

Take me away from here like you said
And I will be grateful with what I have left
Dance in the aisle for me and hold out your hand
And take me away my dear
