Hey little darlin’, you better beware
If you find yourself creepin’ in your lover’s head

You’ll find some secrets your lover left
In the dusty floorboards and the dusty shelves

Waaaaooooooooo
Waaaaooooooooo

Hey there creases, you folded hole
Fifty percent and you’re still unknown

Your eyes are dark, but your hair is gold
I’m gonna’ break you from crown to sole

Waaaaooooooooo
Waaaaooooooooo

Leave that liquor, your boys and bones
Bright red capsule, your sticks and stones

The final chapter, you’ll write alone
In the shiny bathtub of your tiny home

Waaaaooooooooo
Waaaaooooooooo
