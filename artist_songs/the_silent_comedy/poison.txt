Your body went black with the bitters drained
Satin got strapped to a wooden base
Hammer heads clap for the liquid lace
Battery brat and a wicked fade

But if the ladle gets licked, then the suspect’s headed for hell to pay

Scissor-cut slacks and a broken vase
A little high fashion and summer steak
Hanging my hat where the stumbles stray
Lift a gate latch and you’re giving way

But in a fifty-ounce fish, there’s a full shot stiff of the Everglades
