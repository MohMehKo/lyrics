It's in dark rooms we explain ourselves
When it's time can we contain, ourselves
So I'll raise a glass to toast, your health
If we know something
We're not saying

We were not born yesterday
We cannot afford to fame away
And I won't let time go slowly by
Before you
And I get a break..(yeah yeah...YEAH)

There's a lot we should leave to change
But I stand here hoping that, inside
So if you would kindly turn...your back
If we know something, we're not sane

We were not born yesterday
We cannot afford to fame away
And I won't let time go slowly by
Before you
And I get a break..(yeah yeah...YEAH)

Lalalala lalalala-la lalalala lalalala-la-la lalalala lalalala-la-la
