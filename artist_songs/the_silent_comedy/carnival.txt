It was at seventeen that she was like an unbroken mare
It was the likes of he that put her in an ugly despair
She despaired and he always was leaving
She would jump but her building isn’t tall
And she’d really only likely break her leg from the fall

La la la
La la la

She’s counting dishes up that she has broken up on the floor
She only needs one place setting now so she thinks she’ll break more
She broke more and then she started cryin’
She would never see him walk through the door
And she realized she’d never needed him before

La la la
La la la
La la la

She got real sad and walked down to the bar right next to her house
She’d always been real quiet, real quiet, you know like a mouse
Like a mouse and then she started drinking and she climbed on the piano to sing
And she sang about that he had never really meant a thing
This is what she said

Oh la la la, La la la la, La la la la, La La La
Oh la la la, La la la la, La la la la, La La La
Oh la la, La La La And she’s cryin’

She will never see him walk through her door
But she knows now that she doesn’t want him anymore

La la la
La la la
La la la
LA LA LA!!!
