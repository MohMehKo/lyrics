We were walking in a circle, hand in hand
And your feet were sinking deeper in the sand than mine
You had sold me the mansion in your head
I would cut your hair and you would dye it red as fire
As a crackling fire

And I would hold the phone
So you were not alone
I had to take you home, you couldn't even drive

You had smiled when you told me you were brave
And that your life was in other hands to save, not mine
I saw the mansion you had made me love ignite
And as you were fading, it was growing bright with fire
With a crackling fire

And when you tried to stand
You had to take my hand
You said "I think your plan will be splitting from mine"

We made a pile of all your remaining clothes
Where you’re heading now you won’t be needing those, it’s fine
We soaked the pile till it dripped with gasoline
And then I lit a match as if I’d never seen a fire, fire, fire
It was a big roaring fire

And your heart beat failed
And it stopped leaving its trails
But the last thing you exhaled while you were alive was

I am alright
I am alright
I am alright
I am alright
I am alright
I am alright
And I'm doing just fine
I am alright
I am alright
I am alright
I am alright
I am alright
I am alright
And I'm doing just fine
Yeah
