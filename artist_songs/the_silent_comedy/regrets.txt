Wakin’ up on a train
Watchin’ the sun risin’
Through the lens of last night’s dirty deeds
I’m runnin’ from my past
There’s no way around it
To forget your troubled memory
Well that’s the only thing that I need

And in a way I wish I could remember
I know it’s best if I forget
How you left me cryin’ that September
On the anniversary of when we met
When you start livin’ your life without regrets

Every new town I see brings sweet salvation
And every back-alley fight, well it wipes my slate clean
Every bar I close, and field I wake up in
They all bring me one step closer to the only thing I need

In a way I wish I could remember
Oh I know it’s best if I forget
How you left me cryin’ that September
On the anniversary of when we met
When you start livin’ your life without regrets

So I’m just regret
Yeah I’m just regret
Oh just one of life’s little missteps
Yeah I’m just regret
Just a little regret
Just another one lyin’ on your doorstep
So I’ll drink away your memory until there’s nothing left
