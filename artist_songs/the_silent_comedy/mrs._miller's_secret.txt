Nobody knows Mrs. Miller’s secret
‘Could give her your heart, but you might as well keep it
For forty days and forty nights, I’ve been searching for the truth by candlelight

Mrs. Miller she’s gonna’ drive me home
You know she can’t sleep when she’s all alone
She says to drink this, she says to take that
She’ll show me what’s what down by the train tracks

Nobody knows Mrs. Miller’s secret
‘Could give her your heart, but you might as well keep it
For forty days and forty nights, I’ve been searching for the truth by candlelight

Mrs. Miller she doesn’t live alone
She shares a big house with her sweet, sweet son
You see their friends come, you see their friends go
They keep their shades drawn all across their windows

Nobody knows Mrs. Miller’s secret
‘Could give her your heart, but you might as well keep it
For forty days and forty nights, I’ve been searching for the truth by candlelight
