I met you in the garden
Putting flowers in a vase
I grabbed and took your pruning sheers away
We drank at sunset stables and cursed the olden days
Well they were wrong but we will get away
Yeah well they were wrong, that’s what I say

You said that God is evil
If, in fact, He does exist
But you’re betrayin’ me with a kiss
Yeah well you’d betray me if we ever kissed

Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooh
I’m speaking your impossible name
Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooh
I’m speaking your impossible name

So fly down to Bermuda and write it in the sand
And lead the native wealthy by the hand
They will forget their cancer and abused exalted state
You can tie them down and bribe all their maids
Yeah we’ll tie them down, come on you’ve got it made

Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooh
I’m speaking your impossible name
Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooh
I’m speaking your impossible name

Well God said you were evil
And he took your soul away
But you deny it, even to this day
You blackmailed heads of corporations
Left them in your wake
You killed a banker with sabotaged brakes
Now the killing’s over, come on take a break

Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooh
I’m speaking your impossible name
Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooh
I’m speaking your impossible name
Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooh
I run from your sweet, hostile embrace
