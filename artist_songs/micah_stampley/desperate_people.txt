I've seen the God of wonders
Work miracles for me
Those with gifts and talents
Spoke prophetically
The mantles of Elijah, Paul and Timothy
I want to see that power at work inside of me

Cause I'm tired of the status quo
There's gotta be more than this
There's gotta be more, gotta be more
There's gotta be more than this
Cause desperate people do desperate things
And we're pressing in
There's gotta be more
Gotta be more
There's gotta be more than this

There's a people rising the faces shining bright
They speak the name of Jesus
As they're walking toward the light
Yeah, we will seek his power
His presence and his grace
And we won't stop pursuing
Till we see him face to face
Oh, we are desperate people we want more more Lord
We are desperate people we want more more Lord
