Jesus, the crucified
Took my place
Now I can have eternal life, life

Light of the world
Your name I praise
Highly lifted up
Redemption's song is what I sing

Crucified, Crucified for me
Crucified so that I may live

Bruised, despised
Alone and betrayed
Christ the King of Kings
What a precious gift my Savior gave

Bread of Life, Emmanuel
Bright and morning star
May the Son of God be forever praised
Forever praised.

Because of God's love
You hung on that cross
Bled for my life
I will never forget, what you've done
Paying that price; the greatest sacrifice

You gave your love
You shed your blood
Laid down your life for me
You sacrificed that I might live eternally with thee
