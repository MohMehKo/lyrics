We are alive filled with Your glorious life
Out of the dark into Your marvelous light
We are waiting with expectations
Spirit, raise us up with You

Let the Church rise from the ashes
Let the Church fall to her knees
Let us be light in the darkness
Let the Church rise
Let the Church rise

Moving with power, bringing Your name to the earth
Singing Your praises, lifting up glorious songs
We are moving with His compassion
Spirit fill our hearts with You

Let the Church rise from the ashes
Let the Church fall to her knees
Let us be light in the darkness
Let the Church rise

Let the Church rise from the ashes
Let the Church fall to her knees
Let us be light in the darkness
Let the Church rise
Let the Church rise

Let Your wind blow
Let Your wind blow
Let Your wind blow
Revive us again Lord
Let Your wind blow
Let Your wind blow
Let Your wind blow
Revive us again Lord
Let Your wind blow
Let Your wind blow
Let Your wind blow
Revive us again Lord
Let Your wind blow
Let Your wind blow
Let Your wind blow
Revive us again Lord
Let Your wind blow
Let Your wind blow
Let Your wind blow
Revive us again Lord
Let Your wind blow
Let Your wind blow
Let Your wind blow

Let the Church
Let the Church rise from the ashes
Let the Church fall to her knees
Let us be light in the darkness
Let the Church rise

Let the Church rise from the ashes
Let the Church fall to her knees
Let us be light in the darkness
Let the Church rise
Let the Church rise

Let the Church rise from the ashes
Let the Church fall to her knees
Let us be light in the darkness
Let the Church rise
Let the Church rise
