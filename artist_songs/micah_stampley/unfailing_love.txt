God we thank you for your love,
Thank you for your redeeming power 
Thank you for hanging there in our place unconditional 
You never said a word 
So you loved the world so much that you gave your only Son

I see you hanging there
I see your nail pierced hands
For me you paid the price for me

I see your wounded side
I hear your lonely cry
For me you paid the price for me

[Chorus:]
It was unfailing love (Yes)
Grace by your blood
Come and pour over me 
Till all I see is your unfailing love

(OOOOOOOO unfailing love Hallelujah)

I see the crown of thorns
I hear them laugh and scorn
For me you paid the price fore me
(For me Yeah)

I see the Father's eye 
Turn from his bleeding Son
For me you paid the price for me

[Chorus:]
It was unfailing love
Grace by your blood
Come and pour over me 
Till all I see
Is your unfailing love

(Unfailing love)

[Chorus:]
Unfailing love
(Grace by)
Grace by your blood 
(Come Pour over me God)
Pour over me
Till all I see (Yeah)
Is your unfailing
