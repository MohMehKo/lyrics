My soul will thrist
My heart will long
My gift will offer
An empty song
Without You in my life

I'll lift my voice
But I'll still be lost
You will not hear
Unless I draw near
Said I need You in my life

[Chorus:]
Can't even imagine You
Not being with me
My life would be worthless
How would I be free
So I'll never let You go

Forever I'll cry out
And never find peace
A life of despair
A soul of defeat
So I'll never let You go

If you ever rejected me
Where would I go
Who would I be
Without You in my life?

I'll pass away
Like yesterday
No hope to come
No place to run
Said I need You
In my life, I

[Chorus]

(Go)
I'll never let go
(Go)
I need You in my life
(Oh)
Oh, I'll never
(Oh)
Never let you go

Can't even imagine You
Not being with me
My life would be worthless
How would I be free
So I'll never let You go

Forever I'll cry out
And never find peace
A life of despair
A soul of defeat
So I'll never let You go

Never let You go [7x]
