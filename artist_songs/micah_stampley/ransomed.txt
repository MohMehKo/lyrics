Come a fallen soul
A debut he didn't know
Cause I couldn't pay
Ransom any way
For redemption (oh right)
Took away my shame
Although I was to blame
I gave it all up
Because victory's on his side
Of redemption
Oh oh oh [3x]
Jesus paid it all
Oh oh oh [3x]
Jesus paid it all
He has set me free
I know I'm free in deed
My past has been erased
My sin and my disgrace

Has been canceled
Died and then he rose
All power he holds
Got up from the grave
Loosed my every chain
I've been ransomed
Oh oh oh [3x]
Jesus paid it all
Oh oh oh [3x]
Jesus paid it all
I'm free (I'm free)
I'm free (I'm free)
I'm free (I'm free)
Jesus paid it all (Jesus paid it all)
(Come on and say) I'm free
(If you've been freed) I'm free
(Declare it tonight) I'm free
Jesus paid it all
