Oooohhh
Yhyhhhyh
Lend your song to me

I will worship u with a song in the desert breeze
I will worship with the drumbeat on your holy hill
I will worship u as an instrument of your righteousness
I will worship u with the words you wanna hear

[Chorus]
Lend your song to me [x8]

U can trust me
And I will sing to u with my voice my voice
And I amplify the sound of heavens with pipes

And I will offer up myself a holy sacrifice here I am
And I'll drink forever more from the river of new life

[Chorus]
Lend [x17]

I can hear the sound of heaven like a mighty rushing wind
I can hear the sound of heaven rushing rushing me in [repeat till end]

Give me a sound
Can u hear it I can hear it
Ooohhh ooohhoh
