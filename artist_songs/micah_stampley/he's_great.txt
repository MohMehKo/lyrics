Great is Your love
Great is Your power
Great is Your wisdom
So we worship You
Great is Your knowledge
Great is Your strength
Now and forever yes
We worship You

Hallelujah

Great is Your goodness
Great is Your wrath
We bow before Thee
Just to worship You
In Your dominion
And in Your grace
We lay prostrate
Yes
We worship You

(Glory to You)

In all Your splendor
And in Your honor
In all Your beauty
Lord, we worship You
Here in Your presence
We give You reverence
In adoration
We'll forever
Worship You

Lord
I love You

He's great
He's great
He's great
Our God is great

You're great
You're great
You're great
Father
You're great
