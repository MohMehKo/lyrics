Different colors
Different expressions
But when we worship
We sing to an audience of one
We are salt and light
The world must see us unified
A city ought to shine
And we are called to rise

One heart, one mind, one spirit
One voice the world will hear it
Lord make us one
One heart, one mind, one spirit
One voice the world will hear it
Lord make us one

Motivated by the purpose for our life
Dedicated to the cause of Jesus Christ
We are salt and light
The world must see us unified
A city ought to shine
And we are called to rise

One heart, one mind, one spirit
One voice the world will hear it
Lord make us one
One heart, one mind, one spirit
One voice the world will hear it
Lord make us one

Let's join tonight
In a song to him
Lay aside
Our selfish pride
Reconciled to Him

One heart, one mind, one spirit
One voice the world will hear it
Lord make us one
One heart, one mind, one spirit
One voice the world will hear it
Lord make us one

One People we are one people
