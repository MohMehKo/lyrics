I am troubled, yet not distressed.
Perplexed, but not in despair.
Cause I'm a vessel full of power,
With a treasure, none can compare.

Persecuted, but not forsaken.
Cast down, but not destroyed.
I'm a vessel full of power
With a treasure, from the Lord.

[Chorus:]
I'm a vessel full of power
With a treasure from the Lord.

So thank you father for your power
It has resurrected me.
Oh, the painful circumstances
That my poor soul could not flee.

Bruised and battered but not broken
Brought my sin back, From sin I am free
Cause I am a vessel, got a whole lot of power
With a treasure, delivered me.

[Chorus:]
Thank you father
For your power, it has resurrected me.
Oh, the painful cirmcumstances
That my poor soul could not flee.
Oh, oh, oh, oh,

[Lead 1:]
I'm the vessel full of power
With a treasure from the Lord

[Chorus:]
I'm the vessel full of power
With a treasure from the lord [x3]

I'm a vessel, you're a vessel full of power
You've got power from the Lord.
I'm a vessel full of power
Treasure from the Lord

I'm a vessel, full of power with a treasure from the Lord.
