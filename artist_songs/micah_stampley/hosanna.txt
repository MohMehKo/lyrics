Running and seeking your face
Finding our place lost in your grace
Hidden covered encased
Destined to win finish the race

There is a sound to be heard
From the sons of the earth
Show his glory and worth
Let it ring from the mountains be heard
In the valleys and streams
Let the high praises ring

Hosanna in the highest
Hosanna in the highest
Hosanna in the highest
Hosanna, hosanna
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, OH, Oh, OH, Oh, Oh, OH, Oh, OH
