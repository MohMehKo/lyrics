As the deer panted for the water brook
So my soul longs after you
And as the lion preys the antelope
Let me hunger, drive me too
All consuming one surround us
Let your glory tenderize our hearts

We will search for you
We will find you're nearer still
When we've died to our own will
You'll be revealed
You'll be revealed in us

Fall, Rain Fall
Rain Fall on us

We need your rain
We need your rain
Let it fall. Let it fall
