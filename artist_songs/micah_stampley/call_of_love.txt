For the broken and the shamed
Let me heart burn
Like a flame
Let me be the conduit of perfect love
Guided by compassion's face drawn by love for the human race
Till I'm open to me purpose let justice reign

Let me heart be open to the call of love
So I'm not so self consumed in my own world
Let my voice speak for the helpless little child who
In hiding and in silence cries out loud

For homeless destitute
The addicted and abused
Let me be the conduit of perfect love
Guided by compassion's face drawn by love for the human race
Till I'm open to me purpose let justice reign

The call of Love
The call of Love
The call of Love
Let me response to the call of love
The call of love
