Come
And capture our hearts
Saturate our thoughts
Manifest Lord now
Don't let
Your glory depart
We need the glory
We need the glory
So we won't live here
The same way we came
Purify our hearts
With a fresh
Burning flame
We need your fire
To fall down like rain
Holy Spirit

We need the glory
Send down the glory
Shekinah glory
The weight of your glory
