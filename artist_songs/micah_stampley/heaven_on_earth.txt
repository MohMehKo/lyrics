Heaven, Heaven on Earth!
Oh, oh, oh,oh!
Heaven, Heaven on Earth!
The spirit of the Lord is upon me,
His anointing is empowering,
The kingdom of the Lord is within me,
And He's calling me to the Heavenlies.

[Chorus:]
To be seated in heavenly Places,
Just like Heaven,
Just like Heaven on Earth!
To be walking in His favor and grace is
Just like Heaven,
Just like Heaven on Earth!
Oh, oh, oh,oh!
Heaven, Heaven on Earth!
Oh, oh, oh,oh!
Heaven!

Marching in the spirit of unity,
To our community show His ability,
The will of the Lord for His children
Is to demonstrate, perpetuate

[Chorus:]
To be seated in heavenly Places,
Just like Heaven,
Just like Heaven on Earth!
To be walking in His favor and grace is
Just like Heaven,
Just like Heaven on Earth!

Oh, oh, oh,oh!
Heaven on Earth!
Oh, oh, oh,oh!
Heaven on Earth!
