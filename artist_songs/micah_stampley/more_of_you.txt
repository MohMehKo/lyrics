Let us be a generation the most hungry for you
Let our song bring a latter rain
We wont be satisfied until your glory falls down
We press into a place of your glorious grace
Let us wake up outta sleep and a rise to a place of authority in the earth the whole earth waits for the manifestings of sons let us be the ones let us be the ones...

[Chorus]
More of you is what we need
None of us displayed
so only you can be seen
show us how to love and be more like you
oh lord our maker and king more of you

Let us be a generation the most hungry for you let our song bring a latter rain we wont be satisfied until your glory falls down we press into a place of your glorious grace let us wake up outta sleep and arise to a place of authority in the earth the whole earth waits for the manifestings of sons let us be the ones let us be the ones

[Chorus]

You give pleasure out of living sacrifice I only surrender too you everything I have is at the foot of the cross its the only place I can run tooo 

[Chorus]
