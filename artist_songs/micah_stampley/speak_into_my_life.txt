Oh Lord speak into my life
I am a living sacrifice
Your word says live and not die
Oh Lord speak into my life

[Chorus:]
Oh Lord speak into my life
(I am)
I am a living sacrifice
(your word)
Your word says live and not die
Oh Lord speak into my life

One word I'm living this moment on a word
Not just any word but a word from you
A word that says I'm healed delivered and set free
There are no more chains holding me

Could have belonged on that rocky road
If I would have kept my eyes on the problem
I would have surely fell
I heard a voice say whose report do you believe
I said oh Lord one word's all I need
Come on and help my say oh Lord!

[Chorus]

One word, one word, one word, one word is all I need [repeat]

Your word says live and not die
Oh Lord speak into my life [repeat 4x]
