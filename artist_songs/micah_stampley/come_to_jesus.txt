Weak and wounded sinner
Lost and left to die
Oh raise your head for love is passing by

So come to Jesus
Come to Jesus
Come to Jesus and live

Now your burdens lifted
Carried far away
The precious blood has washed away the stains

So sing to Jesus
Sing to Jesus
Sing to Jesus and live

Like a new born baby
Don't be afraid to crawl
And remember when we walk sometimes we fall

So fall on Jesus
Fall on Jesus
Fall on Jesus and live

Sometimes the way is lonely
And steep and filled with pain
So if your sky is dark and pours the rain

Then cry to Jesus
Cry to Jesus
Cry to Jesus and live

Oh and when the love spills over
And music fills the night
And when you can't contain the joy inside

Then dance for Jesus
Dance for Jesus
Dance for Jesus and live

And with your final heartbeat
Kiss this world goodbye
Then go in peace and laugh on glory's side

Then fly to Jesus
Fly to Jesus
Fly to Jesus and live

Come to Jesus
Come to Jesus
Come to Jesus and live
