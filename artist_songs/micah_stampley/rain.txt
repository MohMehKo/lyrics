Wisdom and power
Be unto You
Amazing grace
Rain through and through
One thing that I
Desire and seek
That I may dwell in your house
And inquire of You

Justice and Jury
Lion and Lamb
You are the Holy
And Great I Am
Knowledge and strength
Is what you give
To those who love your Word
And pursue your will [repeat 1 time after chorus]

Rain Love
(Rain Joy)

Rain Peace
(We need all of You)

Rain Grace
(Rain Power)

Rain Strength
(We need all)
(We need all)
[repeat]

Send your latter rain
Oh God, in this place
Oh Lord, we need your rain

Arise, Oh Lord
Let your kingdom come
For you are the same
The risen One

This song is to you
God of Righteousness
We give thanks
For your rain (for your rain)

Rain Love
Rain Joy
Rain Peace
We need all of You

Rain Grace
Rain power
Rain Strength
We need all
We need all

Rain Love
Send down your latter rain

Send down your latter rain [7x]
