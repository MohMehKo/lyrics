We want to go higher
We want to go deeper into you, Oh God
Oh take us to another place God
Take us to another dimension God
By your spirit and your glory
We want to experience you
In a new way
Take us to new realms in your glory
Another place
Another place
Another place
Take us to another place

We're in another place in Him
We're in another place in Him
[Repeated throughout the remainder of the song as the lead ad-libs]
