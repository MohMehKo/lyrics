I wanted to be with you alone
And talk about the weather
But traditions I can trace against the child in your face
Won't escape my attention
You keep your distance with a system of touch
And gentle persuasion
I'm lost in admiration could I need you this much
You're just wasting my time

Something happens and I'm head over heels
I never find out till I'm head over heels
Something happens and I'm head over heels
Don't take my heart
Don't break my heart
Don't throw it away

I made a fire and I'm watching it burn
Thought of your future
With one foot in the past now just how long will it last
No have no ambition
It's hard to be a man when there's a gun in your hand
Oh I feel so...

Something happens and I'm head over heels
I never find out till I'm head over heels
Something happens and I'm head over heels
Don't take my heart
Don't break my heart
Don't throw it away

Something happens and I'm head over heels
I never find out till I'm head over heels
Something happens and I'm head over heels
Don't take my heart
Don't break my heart
Don't take my heart
Don't break my heart
Don't take my heart
Don't break my heart
Don't throw it away
