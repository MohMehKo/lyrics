Good times for a change
See the luck I've had
Could make a good man
Turn bad

So please, please, please
Let me, let me, let me
Let me get what I want
This time
Get what I want this time

Haven't had a dream in a long time
See the life I've had could
Make a good man turn bad
So for once in my life
Let me get what I want
Lord knows it would be the first time
Lord knows it would be the first time

So please, please, please
Let me, let me, let me
Let me get what I want
This time

So for once in my life
Let me get what I want
Lord knows it would be the first time
Lord knows it would be the first time
Lord knows it would be the first time
