Feels like fire
I'm so in love with you
Dreams are like angels
They keep bad at bay
Love is the light
Scaring darkness away

I'm so in love with you
Make love your goal

The power of love
A force from above
Cleaning my soul
Game on burn desire
Love with tongue of fire
Purge the soul
Make love your goal

I'll protect you from the hooded claw
Keep the vampires from your door
When you are down I'll be around
With my death-defying love for you
Envy will hurt itself
Let yourself be beautiful
Like flowers and pearls and pretty girls
Love is like an energy
Rush inside of me

The power of love
A force from above
Cleaning my soul
Game on burn desire
Love with tongue of fire
Purge the soul
Make love your goal

The power of love
A force from above
Cleaning my soul
Game on burn desire
Love with tongue of fire
Purge the soul
Make love your goal
Make love your goal
Make love your goal
