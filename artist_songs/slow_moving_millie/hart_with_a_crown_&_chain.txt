The night she finally fled she ran until her feet bled
She felt the shadows creep but kept just ahead

Memories of its hold. She thought she'd been so bold
She felt the chain was gone she thought that it was over

But now she's longing for the gold that used to hold her
Tethered to the ground, her footing wasn't found

White and vain, a hart with a crown and chain
Sweet and pained a hart with a crown and chain
Will never escape again

And now that she is turned loose and now that she is turned free
And now that she is is all she was supposed to be
She'd dream of capture in the night
She knew she wouldn't fight

White and plain a hart with a crown and chain
Sweet and pained a hart with a crown and chain
Will never escape again

The night that she was caught she didn't cry she didn't struggle
She felt the tightness round her chest, knew it best
Feet stuck to the ground
She didn't make a sound

White and plain a hart with a crown and chain
Sweet and pained a hart with a crown and chain
Will never escape again

White and plain a hart with a crown and chain
Sweet and pained a hart with a crown and chain

Aaahooohh

Will never escape again. 
Will never escape again. 
She'll never escape again.
