Been in and out of love since I was 19
Opening my heart has left a bloodstain
And I don't know how to make a man stay
Maybe I've been putting my heart out in the wrong way

And I'm bleeding
I'm alright with it
Darling, I'm alright with it
I'm bleeding out
I'm alright with it
Darling, I'm alright with it
It's just a bloodstain

Thought I found the one when I was 23
And when it was done, it nearly killed me
I've got a little heart, not built for one night
I give it all away even when I know it isn't right

And I'm bleeding
I'm alright with it
Darling, I'm alright with it
I'm bleeding out
I'm alright with it
Darling, I'm alright with it

I'm gonna pull myself together
Gonna wait til it's forever
Gonna find someone who'll stay
Who's not afraid of what I'm asking for
I know love is never easy
With the scar it's gonna leave me
I would rather love and bleed than never feel love at all

And I'm bleeding
I'm alright with it
Darling, I'm alright with it
And I'm bleeding out
I'm alright with it
Darling, I'm alright with it
It's just a bloodstain
