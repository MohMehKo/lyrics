If time is on our side, 
Then maybe we're missin' a sign somehow
Waitin' on a moment, 
But it never comes around
Walkin' on the sidewalk like all the 
Concrete is made of glass
All we need is a breakthrough, 
But we're too afraid to crash

Maybe we're goin' under, 
Maybe we're both about to break

We're not goin' up, 
We're not goin' down,
We're sideways, we're sideways

Maybe a smile could save us,
Or maybe we're just a few tears away

We're not goin' up,
We're not goin' down,
We're sideways, we're sideways
We're sideways
We're not goin' up,
We're not goin' down,
We're sideways, we're sideways

Built this house on fault lines
Outta the things that we never say,
We see the doors wide open, 
But we stay another day,
Lets stop movin' sideways,
I know it's hard, but let's start again.
Standin' up for something could be worth it in the end.

Maybe we're goin' under, 
Maybe we're both about to break

We're not goin' up, 
We're not goin' down,
We're sideways, we're sideways

Maybe a smile could save us, 
Or maybe we're just a few tears away

We're not goin' up,
We're not goin' down,
We're sideways, we're sideways
We're sideways

We're not goin' up,
We're not goin' down,
We're sideways, we're sideways
We're sideways

We're not goin' up,
We're not goin' down,
We're sideways, we're sideways
We're sideways

If something's on our side,
Then maybe we're missin' a
Sign somehow

We're not goin' up,
We're not goin' down,
We're sideways, we're sideways
We're sideways

We're not goin' up,
We're not goin' down,
We're sideways, we're sideways
We're sideways
