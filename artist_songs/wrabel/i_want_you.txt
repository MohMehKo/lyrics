I'm all fucked up
And honestly, it's been killing me
Honestly, it's been killing me tonight
I don't wanna call
I'm calling you cause I'm drunk tonight
Pick up the phone or I'll call a million times

Why do I try
When I know you're out there
Sleeping with someone else?
When will I learn
That love is just not fair?
And I can't control myself
I want you

Ooh, I want you babe
I want you
Ooh, I want you babe

There's only heights
High enough for the both of us
High enough to forget I'm still in love
And this cheap champagne
I hate the taste, but I take a sip
Celebrate in the way you fucked me up

Why do I try
When I know you're out there
Sleeping with someone else?
When will I learn
That love is just not fair?
And I can't control myself
I want you

Ooh, I want you babe
I want you
Ooh, I want you babe

Oh no
Don't know why I want you when I know you're the wrong thing
Don't go
You're the only thing that makes me feel something
Oh no
Don't know why I want you when I know you're the wrong thing
Don't go
You're the only thing that makes me feel something
And I want you

Ooh, I want you babe
I want you
Ooh, I want you babe
I want you

Ooh, I want you babe
Oh, I want you
