It was the winter
You wore a winter coat
We took the longest drive down a winding road
I roll my window down
You didn't like the smoke
Now my windows up and I'm all alone
Ohhh whoa

You used to run track 
You liked the quarterback
I was the wallflower
One people stared at
You said you had to go back to Ohio
Now it's summertime and I'm all alone
Ohhh whoa

Give it, Give it time
Give it time, ole time
Give it, Give it time
Give it time, ole time
Give it, Give it time
Give it time, ole time
Give it, Give time
Give it, time ole time
Ohhh whoa
Ohhh whoa

I booked the next flight
The middle of the night
When I got there, looked like we'd be alright
I met your family
They were nice to me
Now I'm flying home and I'm all alone
Ohhh whoa

Give it, Give it time
Give it time, ole time
Give it, Give it time
Give it time, ole time
Give it, Give it time
Give it time, ole time
Give it, Give time
Give it, time ole time
Give it, Give it time
Give it time, ole time
Give it, Give it time
Give it time, ole time
Give it, Give it time
Give it time, ole time
Give it, Give time
Give it, time ole time
