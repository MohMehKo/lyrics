It's coming around again
Feeling all in your head
You never let me in
We could be beautiful
You've got the bluest eyes
The colour of you and I
I know it's hard sometimes
We could be beautiful

Oh it's true
You're the colour if you only knew
Every star in the sky that's you
If you saw you the way that I do
We could be beautiful
We could be beautiful

We could be beautiful
We could be beautiful

We could just drive around
Pack up and leave this town
I don't have it figured out
But we could be beautiful

Oh it's true
You're the colour if you only knew
Every star in the sky that's you
If you saw you the way that I do
We could be beautiful
We could be beautiful

We could be beautiful
We could be beautiful

It's coming around again
We could be beautiful
