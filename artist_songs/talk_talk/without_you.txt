Well, I know
Those you don't understand you criticize
And I know
I can never mean anything within your eyes

Stop acting like that
Everybody needs to rearrange
You got to understand
Nothing could ever stay the same

Without my love
What would it be without you?
Without my love
What would I be without you?

Well, I know
If I don't understand, you'll sympathize
And I know
If I've never seen everything, you'll realize

While I'm acting like that
Everybody seems to rearrange
I got to understand
Nothing can ever stay the same

What would it be without you?
Without my love
What would I be without you?
Without my love
What would I be without you?
Without you

Stop acting like that
Picking on my needs, you turn away
I got to understand
Nothing can ever stay the same

Without my love
What would it be without you?
(The story ends)

Without my love
What would it be without you?
(The story ends)

Without my love
What would I be without you?
What would it be without you?
What would I be without you?
(The story ends)

Without my love
What would I be without you?
What would it be without you?
