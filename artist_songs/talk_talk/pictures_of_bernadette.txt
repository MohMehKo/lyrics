Change
I was flying
Seems my life is dying

How can I confess
I've given everything that I had and still you left

How can I forget
I'm getting visions of you inside my head

Change
I'm no closer
How can I reproach her

How can I pretend
I'm living like a king in a land that's heaven sent

How could I suspect
I'd get a message from you to say you'd left

Recollection sees the sun upon your hair
How I feel it
Love we used to share

Recollection sees the sun upon your hair
How I feel it
Love we used to share

How could I accept
Of giving everything that I had and still you left
