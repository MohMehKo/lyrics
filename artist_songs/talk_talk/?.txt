It's OK
If you don't like the words I say
Throw 'em away
But sing it just the same

Oh, no! In sigh! A-ha ha!
I'll get them back again
Back again

It's OK
But I won't grieve three years again 
Let's hit it away
Why don't we think and play?

Oh, no! In sigh! A-ha ha!
I'll get them back again
Back again

Yeah, hey, ha
Yeah, hey
Hey ha, hey-hey, hey ha

Yeah, hey, ha
Yeah, hey
Hey ha, hey-hey, hey ha

It's OK
If you don't like the words I say
Throw 'em away
But sing it just the same

Oh, no! In sigh! A-ha ha!
I'll get them back again
Back again
Oh, no! In sigh! A-ha ha!
I'll get them back again
Back again
Back again
