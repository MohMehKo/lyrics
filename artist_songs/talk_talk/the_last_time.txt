One by one 
every courtesy is gone 
and the show begins
Bring on the clowns
Pain is quiet
I've laughed at silence 
for the last time

Let the show begin 
for the last time

Sometimes one, 
sometimes each of us is wrong 
but the show begins
Bring on the clowns 
blind to reason
These eyes are dreaming 
for the last time
Let the show begin
for the last time
Let the show begin

Bring on the clowns
Smiling sweetly 
doubt may leave me 
for the last time

Let the show begin 
for the last time
Let the show begin

Let the show begin
for the last time,
for the last time

Let the show begin
for the last time,
for the last time

for the last time,
for the last time,
for the last time
