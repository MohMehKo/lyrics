Well it got too much
After the accident

Must have dropped away

I don't like to read the news 
D'you know anything I'm going through

Did you see my photograph
It was on page ten
I swore to everyone

D'you know anything I'm going through

Its so hard to sleep at night
To sleep at night

I don't like to read the news
D'you know anything I'm going through

And she calls
