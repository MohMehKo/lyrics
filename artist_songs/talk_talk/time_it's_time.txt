Nobody knows how long
Rustling leaves unrhyme
Lullaby breeze unsung
Babel of dreams unwinds in memory

As bad as bad becomes
It's not a part of you
And love is only sleeping
Wrapped in neglect
Time it's time to live

Kissing a grey garden
Shadow and shade
Sunlight treads softly

As bad as bad becomes
It's not a part of you
Contempt is ever breeding
Trapped in itself
Time it's time to live

As bad as bad becomes
It's not a part of you
The wicked and the weeping
Ramble or run
Time it's time to live
Time it's time to live for living

Now that it's over
Rest your head
