RELAX YOUR STARE
It's laughing in my face
My foes beware
I'm tired of losing grace
The child's not there
The priest is losing faith
Defile my care
And stumble to the flames

People crying, People crying
My confusion
Are there illusions?
...Hate

THE DICE WON'T LOSE
They've everything to gain
Devout prepare
The stones along my grave

People crying, People crying
My confusion
Are there illusions?
...Hate

Don't say a word
If I've been away too long
I found out it's wrong
I found out...
I DON'T NEED HATE
