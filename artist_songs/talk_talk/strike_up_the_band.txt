Driving in the back seat around the town
Listen to the lights, I want to see the sound

Of music playing in my head
I never heard a word you said

The beats are kicking in
Your ears don't hear a thing
Strike up the band

Looking for reaction without the crowd
Looking in the doors I get the run around

You never heard a word I said
I've seen this music in my head

The beats are kicking in
Your ears don't hear a thing
Strike up the band

You never heard a word I said
I've seen this music in my head

The beats are kicking in
Your ears don't hear a thing
Strike up the band
