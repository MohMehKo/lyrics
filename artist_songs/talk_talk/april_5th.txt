Here she comes
Silent in her sound
Here she comes
Fresh upon the ground

Come gentle spring, come at winter's end
Gone is the pallor from a promise that's nature's gift
Waiting for the colour of spring

Let me breathe
Let me breathe the colour of spring

Here she comes
Laughter in her kiss
Here she comes
Shame upon her lips

Come wanton spring, come for birth you live
Youth takes its bow before the summer the seasons bring
Waiting for the colour of spring

Let me, let me breathe

Let me breathe
Let me breathe you
Let me breathe
Let me breathe you
Let me breathe, let me breathe
Let me breathe, let me, let me, let me breathe
Let me breathe, let me breathe
Let me breathe, let me breathe
Let me breathe

Let me breathe
Let me, let me breathe
Let me breathe
Let me, let me, let me breathe
Let me breathe
