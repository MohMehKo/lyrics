And when you're hanging round
waiting on the other side of town

Kick a stone on a painted wall.
And when the riot comes keep your head and keep your loving charm

Living life is a glamour show - but it's another word
it's another word.
All soldiers have a cause giving life upon graffitied walls
As a way to pass the time.
I saw a father's fear for a leader standing over here.
'Who's the King' say's a passer by - but it's another word
it's another word
Word - word

And when you're hanging round
waiting on the other side of town
...
Word - word
it's another word
word
word.
