From the place that I stand to the land that is openly free
Watching rivers run black by the trees that are vacant to greed

Gotta give it up
Gotta get a second chance
Gotta give it up
Gotta get a second chance and the jokes just started

Gotta give it up
Give it up, give it up
Gotta give it up

Or tell me why I'm so wrong
Where does love come from
If you've sold your reasoning out?

How can I learn if I don't understand what I see
If I'm giving this mess, take a walk through a nightmare so real

Gotta give it up
Gotta get a second chance
Gotta give it up
Gotta get a second chance and the jokes just started

Gotta give it up
Give it up, give it up
Gotta give it up

Tell me why I'm so wrong
Where does luck come from
When you've never been without?

Give it up
Give it up, give it up
Gotta give it up
Give it up, give it up
Gotta give it up

Tell me why I'm so wrong
Where does love come from
If you've sold your reasoning out?
Or tell me why I'm so wrong
Where does luck come from
When you've never been without?

You can't do that
You can't do that
You can't do that
You can't do that
