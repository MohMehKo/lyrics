Everybody's laughing

Brilliant sky
Set the sails, our hearts are open
Don't cry
I believe release is in your smile

The tide shall turn to shelter us from storm
The seas of charity shall overflow
And bathe us all

Walk on by
Make believe our exile's chosen
Untied
I can see our freedom's in your mind

The tide shall turn to shelter us from storm
The seas of charity shall overflow
And bathe us all
