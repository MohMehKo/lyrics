Well the daylight drags me out of bed
And the nightlife drags me home
In the meantime I drag round half dead
Restin up for later on

Well I wrack my brain to easy my mind
But I always edge my bet
On the tail of every trend I find
But I don't feel nothin' yet

Lookin' for the good life
It's just about to make me loose my mind
Lookin' for the good life
It's keepin me miserable all the time

As a child a dream is all it takes
To get you through the night
Now it costs me every dime I make
Just to say I feel alright

Lookin' for the good life
It's just about to make me loose my mind
Lookin' for the good life
It's keepin me miserable all the time

Well I looked in the books and the movies
And I sat through the tv shows
Got the Vcr and the ja'causezi
And I statr at the speakers on the stereo

And my conscience just keeps raging
Until I wish it was back down low.

Lookin' for the good life
It's just about to make me loose my mind
Lookin' for the good life
It's keepin me miserable all the time
