I can travel to a place,
Where the horizon meets the sky,
Or to find that perfect moment,
When the day gives into night.
I want to be like the sun,
That surrenders to the sea,
With no clear separation,
Is what I want my life to be.

I want to be so much a part of you,
When the world sees me,
And love shines through.
A living example of what grace can do.
I want to be so close,
That my heartbeat,
Is You living inside of me.
O Lord I wanna blur the lines.

Looking back at all the moments,
Of black, and white, and grey,
When the things I thought were certain,
Were just slightly out of place.
I might need to ask some questions,
When I'm searching for the truth,
But at the end of the day, Lord,
You're the one I run to.

I want to be so much a part of you,
When the world sees me,
And love shines through.
A living example of what grace can do.
I want to be so close,
That my heartbeat,
Is You living inside of me.
O Lord I wanna blur the lines.

I wanna be a living marker,
Where the shore becomes the tide,
And I am washed in waves of mercy,
Where Your arms are open wide.
Oh, so much a part of you,
When the world sees me,
And love shines through.
A living example of what grace can do.

I want to be so close,
That my heartbeat,
Is You living inside of me.
O Lord I wanna blur the lines.
O Lord, I wanna blur the lines,
I wanna blur the lines,
I am washed in waves of mercy.
