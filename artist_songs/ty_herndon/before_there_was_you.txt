A church with no voices raised, singing loud in heavenly praise
Is just four walls 'round a silent room
That was me before there was you

A ship with no guiding star aimlessly drifting near and far
With no harbor to sail into, that was me before there was you

That was me before there was you
The last dark cloud in a sky of blue

On a lonesome wind just passing through
That was me before there was you

A world where darkness fell like a coin down an empty rail
Where no wish had ever come true, that was me before there was you

That was me before there was you
The last dark cloud in a sky of blue
On a lonesome wind just passing through
That was me before there was you
