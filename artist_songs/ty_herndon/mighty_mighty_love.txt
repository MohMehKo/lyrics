Ohhhhh...
On the day that God said
Let there be light
He said let there be love,
He thought of you and I.
All was put in motion,
Mountains rose,
The stars were set,
Still waters moved.
With so much foundation behind us,
Destiny proves

[Chorus:]
We've got a mighty, mighty love
I feel it when we're touchin'
A power starts rushin'
Yeah this is somethin'
Been a long time comin'
Oh baby what we have here
Is a future with no fear
The horizon is so clear
The universe demands
Together we stand
On this mighty, mighty love.

I knew I would find you
Some sweet day.
Step into my life
Everything would change.
It started with a look
That became a smile
Turned into a kiss
And now here we are.
There is no question in heaven
No doubt here on earth

[Chorus]

We can stare right into the face
Of whatever comes
We'll rise above it all
With this mighty, mighty

[Chorus]
