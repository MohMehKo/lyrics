Come here right now
Let me see those lips up close girl
Whisper sweet something's in my ear
Your breath on my breath
Get tangled up together and you draw me in
Skin on skin let's do it again
And give me some

[Chorus:]
Sugar when I wake up in the morning
Sugar when I'm fallin' asleep
Sugar anytime, anyplace, anywhere, anyway, any day of the week
Baby you know I got this cravin'
Can only be satisfied by you
I need something sweet like a honey needs a bee
So come on over here and pour that sugar on me

Give me some sugar

One kiss that's it
I'm like a kid hooked on candy
You've got me bouncin' off the wall
True love that's us
That's what makes it even sweeter
When you pull me close
You give me a dose of what I love most
Give me some

[Repeat Chorus]

Baby you know I got this cravin'
Can only be satisfied by you
I need something sweet like a honey needs a bee
I need something sweet like a honey needs a bee
I need something sweet like a honey needs a bee
Pour that sugar on me
Give me that sugar
Hey
Give me that sugar
Give me that sugar
Yeah
Give me that sugar
Give me some sugar baby
Give me that sugar
