I'd walk through fire, 
Take on the shadow, 
I'd do anything for you my love

I'd risk it all, 
Without thinking, 
All I can think about is holding on

When my heart feels like it's flying up above the rain
Caught up in emotions, that I can't explain
It's a never ending feeling I can't get enough of
I can't live without you baby
Thats what I call love

Money talks
People listen
Some they don't understand what it's all about
Cause it can't be bought
Its only given
Now that it's come along 
There ain't no doubt

When my heart feels like it's flying up above the rain
Caught up in emotions
That I can't explain
It's a never ending feeling I can't get enough of
I can't live without you baby
That's what I call love, yeah

Well I thought I'd looked in ever corner
And I swore I'd opened every door
But just when I can't get enough
I finally found the love that I'd been
Searching for

When my heart feels like it's flying up above the rain,
Caught up in emotions 
That I can't explain
It's a never ending feeling I can't get enough of
I can't live without you baby,
Thats what I call love
I can't live without you baby, 
That's what I call love
