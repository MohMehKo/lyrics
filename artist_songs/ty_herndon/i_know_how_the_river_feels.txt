They say for everyone
there's that certain one
out there, somewhere
I'd been looking hard
searching every heart
Getting nowhere
Didn't know I was making
my way to you

Now I know how the river feels
When it reaches the sea
And finally finds a place
It was always meant to be
Holding fast, home at last
Knowing the journey's through
Lying here with you
I know how the river feels

Miles of loneliness, now
make perfect sense
Here beside you
Tears like waterfalls, they
were worth them all
Just to find you
And these are the last arms
I'll run to

Now I know how the river feels
When it reaches the sea
And finally finds a place
It was always meant to be
Holding fast, home at last
Knowing the journey's through
Lying here with you
I know how the river feels
