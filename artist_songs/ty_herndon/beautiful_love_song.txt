The stars are out tonight
As far as we can see
I feel so alive
With you here next to me
It's like a beautiful love song

[Chorus:]
Baby this love
Baby this love ain't ever gonna die
Never gonna die
Baby hold on
Baby don't you know that you and I
You and I
We're like a beautiful love song, yeah
We're like a beautiful love song

Shine your light on me
Me and my heart
Girl I know love will set us free
And lead us safely trough the dark
Like a beautiful love song

[Repeat Chorus]

We're like a beautiful love song
