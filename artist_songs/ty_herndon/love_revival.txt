I need to be close to you,
I long for you.
And if we could just break through,
We'd find that feelin'.
Then I'd see the light come back in your eyes,
Like a new believer, just baptized.

We need a love revival.
To shout and sing about,
A romance, slow dance.
Give us one more chance.
We need a love revival.

In the deep and dark of our hearts,
A white tin is glowin'.
Filled with memories and future dreams.
Feel the light it's throwin'.
Oh, and God is tryin' to show us,
It's time for love to grow us.

We need a love revival.
To shout and sing about,
A romance, slow dance.
Give us one more chance.
We need a love revival.

(We need to shout and sing.)
Revival.
(Just give me one more chance to love you.)
(How I loved you.)

Then I'd see the light come back in to eyes,
Like a new believer, just baptized.

We need a love revival.
To shout and sing about,
A romance, slow dance.
Give us one more chance.
We need a love revival.

(We need to shout and sing.)
Shout about it.
(Just give me one more chance to love you.)
(I want to love you, yeah.)
I want to love you.
