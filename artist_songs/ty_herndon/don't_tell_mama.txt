I was headed noth on highway five, one star lit sunday night
When a pickup truck flew by me out of control
As I watched in my headlights he swerved left and then back right
He never hit the brakes as he left the road

I found him lying in the grass among the steel and glass
With an empty whiskey bottle by his side
Through the blood and tears he whispered in my ear
A few last words just before he died

Don't tell mama I was drinking

Lord knows her soul would never rest
I can't leave this world with mama thinking
I met the lord with whiskey on my breath

I still think about that night and how that young man died
And how others sometimes pay for our mistakes
The last thing on his mind as he left this world behind
Was knowing someone else's heart would break

Don't tell mama I was drinking
Lord knows her soul would never rest
I can't leave this world with mama thinking
I met the lord with whiskey on my breath
