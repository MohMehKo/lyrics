All of my life I fought hard for the things I have wanted
Caught up in blindly believing the strongest survive
But here in your eyes I see everything
I ever dreamed of and I am afraid
If I rush in, if I move in too fast
I just might frighten my one chance away

It's easy to be strong, I've done it for so long
But this time I have to remember
This time to get what I want, I have to surrender
Here I stand helplessly willing and waiting for your love
When want became need my heart had no choice at all
What will you do now, it's up to you now
It's so hard to wait but I will
God give me wisdom, god give me the strength
And the courage to simply stand still

It's easy to be strong, I've done it for so long
But this time I have to remember
This time to get what I want, I have to surrender

Here I am take me, somehow you saved me
From a lifetime of not being all love could make me

It's easy to be strong, I've done it for so long
But this time I have to remember
This time to get what I want, this time I have to be tender
This time to get what I need, I have to surrender
