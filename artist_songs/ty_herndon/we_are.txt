We are two ordinary souls
Who walked that lonely road
For days and nights on end

And we searched a million faces
And all those lonely places
For the smile of one true friend

What are the chances out 
In life's parade
Of two hearts embracing 
In this masquerade

[Chorus:]
We are the ending of a prayer fulfilled
We are the fire that others long to build
A poet's vision that has come this far
We dreamed of something real and now we are

We feel we are love's great design
Our thoughts can intertwine
Though both of us are strong

And we know we'll stumble
There's no doubt but we ain't walking out
That thinking don't belong

Heaven worked too long, 
Too hard to get us here
So we'll love each other 
And just let him steer

[Chorus]

A poet's vision that has come this far
We dreamed of something real
