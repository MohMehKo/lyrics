The stars are set like diamonds in the sky
But you're the only jewel I see tonight
Like this river rolling through the dark
Your love courses deep inside my heart

Strong as any force of nature
I need you every breath of my life

I'd move heaven and earth for you
I'd steal the tides right from the moon
I'd lift the street to the angels feet
If you say the word
I'd fight for you, I'd die for you
In my last breath, I'd cry for you
Baby that's what your love is worth
I'd move heaven and earth

Every time you're holding me I swear (every time your holding me)
For you there's not a cross I would not bare 
And baby when we kiss my heart has wings (baby when we kiss)
Love can do some supernatural things
And if a mountain stood between us (stood between us)
I'd roll up my sleeves and tear it down

I'd move heaven and earth for you
I'd steal the tides right from the moon
I'd lift the street to the angels feet
If you say the word
I'd fight for you, I'd die for you
In my last breath, I'd cry for you
Baby that's what your love is worth
Oh, Id move heaven and earth
-I'd move heaven and earth-

Oh there's no secret to this power (there's no secret)
I draw all my strength from your sweet love 

I'd move heaven and earth for you
I'd steal the tides right from the moon
I'd lift the street to the angels feet
If you say the word
I'd fight for you, I'd die for you
In my last breath, I'd cry for you
Baby that's what your love is worth
Oh, I'd move heaven and earth

I'd move heaven and earth
