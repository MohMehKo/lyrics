Right about now 
She's happy to let the morning 
Sun through the window kiss her face 

Right about now 
I'll bet she's finishing up her crossword 
And loving the way her coffee taste 

Right about now 
I wish I was more that just a memory to her 
I didn't listen somehow 
When 
She said 
You'll miss me if you go 
And I swore 
Before I slammed the door 
I'll never think of you again 
Oh I was so wrong back then 
And she so 
Right about now 

Right about now 
Shouldn't I be the one 
Who's better for all the time that's past 
Oh and shouldn't I be 
The one who's telling friends 
I'm happy to be alone at last 

Theres nothing right about now 
It's just like she promised on the day I left her 
What goes around comes around 

When 
She said 
You'll miss me if you go 
And I swore 
Before I slammed the door 
I'll never think of you again 
Oh I was so wrong back then 
And she was so... right about now... right about now 

Shouldn't I be the one
