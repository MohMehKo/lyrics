I only needed coffee, aisle four is where she caught me off guard
Seemed like a lifetime between her goodbye
And by the way, how have you been?

She talked about the weather,
I thought of nights I held her so close
Oh there I go, thinkin with my heart again

Her smile brought back the best times
Sweet memories of nights together
Stirring up those old feelings
That got me thinking about forever with her

She said "I must be going, there's someone waiting for me outside"
And I died
Oh there she goes and here I go
Thinkin with my heart again

Her smile brought back the best times
Sweet memories of nights together
Stirring up those old feelings
That got me thinking about forever with her

I only needed coffee, aisle four is where she caught me
Thinkin with my heart again
