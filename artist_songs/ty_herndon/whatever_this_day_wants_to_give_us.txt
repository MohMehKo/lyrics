There's a whole lot of worry
Outside the window
A whole lot of people
They have no hope at all
They see a storm cloud coming
And they all start running
They're so certain that the sky's about to fall
But that ain't us baby

[Chorus:]
We'll greet the sun in the morning
Happy for the good Lord's grace
Knowin' that we're strong enough
For anything that comes our way
We'll take the good with the bad
And send another prayer to Jesus
For whatever this day
Whatever this day wants to give us

We've seen some hard times
Been no bed of roses
But we must be stronger for it
'Cause baby we're still here
As long as we're breathin' 
I don't see no reason
To borrow tomorrow's trouble
And live today in fear
Oh come what may baby

[Chorus x2]
