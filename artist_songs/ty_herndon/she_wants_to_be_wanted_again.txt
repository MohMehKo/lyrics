She gets the kids up and off to school
Works never done till the day is through
Same ole routine over and over again

There's a lot of this world that she's never seen
She married young, the boy of her dreams
And to this day, that's something she wouldn't change
But she longs for the way he used to whisper her name

She wants to be wanted, she knows that she's needed
She wants moonlight and romance, soft music and a slow dance
She wants him to hold her like he's never touched her
That's how love began, she wants to be wanted again

It's friday night and he's on his way home
She's made plans for them to be alone
Took the kids to her mama's, they're gonna spend the night
And she's hoping he'll notice how her new dress fits her just right

She wants to be wanted, she knows that she's needed
She wants moonlight and romance, soft music and a slow dance
She wants him to hold her like he's never touched her
That's how love began, and she wants to be wanted again
