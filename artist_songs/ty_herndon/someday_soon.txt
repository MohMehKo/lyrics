Everything familiar feels so new to me
I might look the same
But I'm not who I used to be
The clock still chimes
The world still turns
I don't know how I live this life here without you
Oh, but someday soon 

Love is gonna build a bridge
From me to you
Faith is gonna find a way
To pull me through
And we will be together once again
Someday soon 

Only God knows why it has to be this way
There's no easy answers
There's no words to say
The light that guides me through the dark
Is knowing that these arms will hold you strong and true
Baby, someday soon 

And love is gonna build a bridge
From me to you
And faith is gonna find a way
To pull me through

Ohhhh Love is gonna build a bridge
From me to you
Faith is gonna find a way
To pull me through
And we will be together once again
Someday soon 

(We'll be together, ooh we'll be together, we'll be together)
Someday
