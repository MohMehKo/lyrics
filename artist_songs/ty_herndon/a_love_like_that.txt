You've been whisperin things I've never heard
Love's been redefined, it's more than just a word
I never thought I'd fall again
But roads divide and new roads begin
So it could take a lifetime to find someone like you

I've been lookin for a love like that
Once you start it you can't turn back
I get the feelin that I'm lookin at
The answer to my prayers

Cause when you lay me down you set me free
My heart stops when you touch me
I've been lookin for a love like that

Each time it felt so right
It always turned out wrong
I know it was you
I wanted all along

I thought it was impossible, but I think I found my miracle

I only needed someone who needs me like you do

I've been lookin for a love like that
Once you start it you can't turn back
I get the feelin that I'm lookin at
the answer to my prayers

Cause when you lay me down you set me free
My heart stops when you touch me
I've been lookin for a love like that

I want an earth shaker
A risk taker
One hell of a love maker
Somebody that wants nobody but me

I've been lookin for a love like that
Cause when you lay me down you set me free
My heart stops when you touch me
I've been lookin for a love
I've been lookin for a love like that
