Take our sorrows
Take our tears
Heaven's not so far
From here

Though we struggle
Hear us pray
There will be a better day

Show us mercy
Give us rest
Hold the weary
To your breast

And for the child who
Lost his way
There will be a better day

[Chorus:]
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
There will be a better day

Sweet forgiveness
Shining light
Lift the darkness
Of the night

Help us find 
The strength to say
There will be a better day

[Chorus]
