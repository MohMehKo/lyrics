There's a lipstick kiss on the rim of a starbuck's coffee cup
I can smell Chanel mademoiselle on the pillowcase when I'm waking up
She's here but she ain't when she leaves she stays undercover all over the place

[Chorus:]
And I 
I've never seen nothin' like her in my life
She's got the gift that keeps on givin'
Like a long goodbye like a stuck in your head song
Singin' all day long can't be wrong
Her love's so right on
It'll stay with you even when she's gone

There's a picture on my phone I click on a million times a day
Lingers in my mind like a vintage wine so good I get a buzz on the after taste
There she goes again makin' my head spin
She's the trip I keep a fallin' in

[Repeat Chorus]

She's the mystery to me that makes perfect sense

[Repeat Chorus]
