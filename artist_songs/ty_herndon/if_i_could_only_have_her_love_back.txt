Don't need to be rich,
Don't have to be smart,
'Cause without even tryin',
She can remind you,
How lucky you are.
She's a beautiful thing.
And what makes it a crime,
Is I took someone I love,
Too long for granted.
No wonder she left me behind.

Baby, if I could only have her love back.
I swear I would change if she,
Would give me one more chance at,
To lift her up where she belongs.
She loved me right and I loved her wrong.
So I'm cryin' out for mercy.
What do I have to do to have her forgive me?
Am I just wastin' my time,
Wonderin' if I could only have her love back?

She gave all of herself,
Always thinkin' of us.
Honesty was all she,
Ever wanted from me, 
And I never gave her enough.
Now it's easy to see,
But so hard to survive.
Oh, the one big mistake,
Is gonna mess up my heart,
For the rest of my life.

Baby, if I could only have her love back.
I swear I'd change if she
Would give me one more chance at,
To lift her up where she belongs.
She loved me right and I loved her wrong.
So I'm cryin' out for mercy.
What do I have to do to have her forgive me?
Am I just wastin' my time,
Wonderin' if I could only have her love back?

I may be dreamin', lyin',
Deceivin' myself,
But I still have to try.
Every ounce of my bein',
Struggles for meanin'
Without her here in my life.
Baby, now I'm cryin' out for mercy.
What do I have to do to have her forgive me?
Am I just wastin' my time,
Wonderin' if I could only have her love back?

I need her love back.
I want her love back.
I want you back, baby.
Mmmm-mmm.
