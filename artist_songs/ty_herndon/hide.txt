We're in a room full of people and your
Talking to yourself again till you
Find your closest friend, the door

Let's take a walk out in the sun
You say "Why? The clouds will come"
Just like all the times before

How can you survive
On whiskey and goodbyes
Does it satisfy, baby..

[Chorus:]
Don't go off and hide
So scared of what the world will find
I can help you if you need it
You may not care for love
You made it clear, you're minds made up
I can make your heart believe it

It will take your breath away
Just try, you'll be amazed
It'll bring new life to the dead

You just know without any proof
It can turn lies into truth
Yes, the best medicine you can get

Won't you take my hand
Before you slip back there
And get nowhere

[Chorus]

Oh, make your heart believe it
I can't watch you drown, drown
Sink to the bottom like a stone, cold
Unaware that you're even going down, down
You do it, oh so naturally

[Chorus]

I can help you if you need it
Let's take a walk out in the sun
I know the clouds will come
