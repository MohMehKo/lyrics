In your face now don't ignore me, what's your name and what's you story
Is this empty chair here for me-girl don't turn away
Something tells me you're a libra, do they say you look like reba
Hope I don't seem over eager in your face

Cause in your face there's heartache-you can't hide it
And on your lips love's left a bitter taste
In your eyes there's tears that don't need crying
And honey I'm just trying to put a little smile in their place in your face
In your face is my reflection, honey you ain't seen rejection
Let me tell you how she left me, laid my love to waste
Though I ain't no pickup artist, let me crash your pity party
Make you laugh and put a sparkle in your face

Cause in your face there's heartache-you can't hide it
And on your lips love's left a bitter taste
In your eyes there's tears that don't need crying
And honey I'm just trying to put a little smile in their place
In your face

Cause in your face there's heartache-you can't hide it
And on your lips love's left a bitter taste
In your eyes there's tears that don't need crying
And honey I'm just trying to put a little smile in their place in your face
