I didn't mean to break your window, I was tryin' to wake you up
But when I saw you out last night it hit me like a truck
I tried to call all day at work, didn't they give you my fax
Hey I want my goodbye back

I had a momentary temporary lack of self control
I said this and I said that, I was really on a roll
It's been downhill ever since my good sense jumped the track
And I want my goodbye back

My doctor says I'm better now, but I still feel the pain
I showed him your picture, he said man you are insane
He asked me for your number and now his left eye is black
And I want my goodbye back

I had a momentary temporary lack of self control
I said this and I said that, I was really on a roll
It's been downhill ever since my good sense jumped the track
And I want my goodbye back

I might have been insensitive but I have learned a lot
I know what I can live without and I know what I ain't got

I had a momentary temporary lack of self control
I said this and I said that, I was really on a roll
It's been downhill ever since my good sense jumped the track
And I want my goodbye, baby you know why
I want my goodbye back
