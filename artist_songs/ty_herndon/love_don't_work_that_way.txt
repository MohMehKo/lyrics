I've got a friend all caught up in keepin' up with mr. jones
So high up that ladder he can't see
His wife left him three weeks ago, he don't even know she's gone
Hey, buddy, if you're askin' me

Love don't work, love won't work that way
It's a two heart assembly line
Workin' nights and overtime day after day
Code-a-phone apologies can't fill a woman's needs
Can't take a lover's place
Love don't work, love won't work that way

I used to work eight hour weeks, trying to buy the best for her
Workin' my life....workin' her love away
But she met me at the door one night and threw my heart a curve
All she had to say

Love don't work, love won't work that way
It's a two heart assembly line
Workin' nights and overtime day after day
Code-a-phone apologies can't fill a woman's needs
Can't take a lover's place
Love don't work, love won't work that way
