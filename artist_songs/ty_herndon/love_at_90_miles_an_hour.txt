It was a dusty july morning, she was headed into town
Me and bob were stringing barbwire and digging holes in the ground
I thought I'd seen an angel when she rolled her window down
And when I heard heaven calling boys, I didn't stand around
She was the ranchers only daughter and her mama's little girl
But I had me 14 dollars so I promised her the world
She said I caught her eye the day her daddy hired me on
She dropped the hammer on that mustang, like a bullet we were gone

Love at 90 miles an hour's a little hard to understand
She was almost an angel, I was almost a man
She didn't hear her conscience and I didn't have a clue
Love at 90 miles an hour's all we had to hang on to

Next morning at the bar j, another dusty july day
Bob met me at the barn door with my bedroll and my pay
Her daddy crossed the backyard, lord I thought he had a gun
She had to drag me in that mustang cause I was too scared to run

Love at 90 miles an hour's a little hard to understand
She was almost an angel, I was almost a man
She didn't hear her conscience and I didn't have a clue
Love at 90 miles an hour's all we had to hang on to

Well it took a couple years for the dust to settle down
But now we're raising us a family on the other side of town
Someday we'll buy some cattle and a bigger piece of land
But when our daughter learns to drive we're gonna fire the hired hand

Love at 90 miles an hour's a little hard to understand
She was almost an angel, I was almost a man
She didn't hear her conscience and I didn't have a clue
Love at 90 miles an hour's all we had to hang on to
