You get a lot of pretty days and some where the sun don't shine
You make a lot of friends along the way, you leave a few behind

You just get one
You just get one
You just get one true love
You just get one
You just get one true love
You just get one

You get a lot of songs that make you smile
And some that make you cry
You could travel for a million miles

And never find a reason why

You just get one
You just get one
You just get one true love
You just get one
You just get one true love
You just get one

You just get one
You just get one
You just get one true love
You just get one
You just get one true love
You just get one
