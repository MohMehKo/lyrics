I call her name I hear her voice
But I know she's somewhere else
Shadows fall around my heart
As I whisper to myself
What kind of fool can't see
That she's really gone
She let go
But I'm still holdin' on

[Chorus:]
Don't know if I can break away
From a slow moving memory
Still livin' in yesterday
With a slow moving memory

Feels like I move in circles 
Everywhere I go
Dragging this ball and chain 
That's wrapped around my soul
There's a life after her
Or so I'm told
But that's a life
That I may never know

[Repeat Chorus]

I've tried to move on
I try to be strong
I pray someday she'll be long, long gone

[Repeat Chorus]

From a slow moving memory
From a slow moving memory
With a slow moving memory
From a slow moving memory
With a slow moving memory
