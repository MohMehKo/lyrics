She was just a girl runnin from the city
I was just a farm boy lookin for a good time
Neither one of us was out to fall in love

She was gettin gas at Thompson Station
I was buyin parts for the old man's tractor
When she looked at me, I knew it was more than love
We talked and she smiled
And I swear, it about drove me half wild

Love came alive in a New York Second
Just the way it's meant to be I reckon
Felt so good, it just keep's gettin
Better all the time she's with me

Love came alive in a small town minute
Came along and swept us both up in it
The Texas sky ain't got no limit
Every since her sweet love came alive

She was on her way up to Colorado
Stopped to see a friend down in Beaumont
It's something how life takes it's twists & turns
She asked me how to get to the local diner
I said I'll tell you if you let me join you

She said fine and love began to burn

We laughed and she smiled
And I swear, it about drove me half wild

Love came alive in a New York Second
Just the way it's meant to be I reckon
Felt so good, it just keep's gettin
Better all the time she's with me

Love came alive in a small town minute
Came along and swept us both up in it
The Texas sky ain't got no limit
Every since her sweet love came alive

Love came alive in a New York Second
Just the way it's meant to be I reckon
Felt so good, it just keep's gettin
Better all the time she's with me

Love came alive in a small town minute
Came along and swept us both up in it
The Texas sky ain't got no limit
Every since her sweet love came alive

Every since her sweet love came alive
