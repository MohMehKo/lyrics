I've been ridin' through the storm, feelin' weary and forlorn
Outside the shelter of your tender arms
It'd been forty days and nights since we said our last goodbye
And there ain't a single rainbow in sight

The sky keeps right on cryin', I keep callin' out your name
Can't find the will to keep on tryin
Got a heart full of sorrow and a hat full of rain
I'm soaked clear to the skin, there's a cold chill settin' in

And this 'ol harley's shakin, like a willow in the wind
I've been up and down the coast, runnin' from loves ghost
It's the good memories that hurt the most

The sky keeps right on cryin', I keep callin' out your name
Can't find the will to keep on tryin
Got a heart full of sorrow and a hat full of rain

Got to find the will to keep on tryin'
I got a heart full of sorrow and a hat full of rain
