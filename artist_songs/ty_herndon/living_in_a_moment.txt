Well the world just lost two lonely people
The world just lost two broken hearts
The odds were against it but baby here we are
In our own little place in our own little corner
This old cold world just got a little warmer
For the rest of my life I'm gonna hold you in my arms

[Chorus:]
And when they carve my stone all they'll need to write on it
Is once lived a man who got all he ever wanted
Tell me something who could ask for more
Then to be living in a moment you would die for

If I never get rich on what money can buy
It don't matter to me and I'll tell you why
I've got it all when I'm holding you this way
I'll live to love you I'd die to keep you
Safe inside these arms that need you
I'll be loving you with the very last breath I take

[Chorus]

Ashes to ashes dust into dust
I'll lay beside you forever in love

And when they carve my stone all they'll need to write on it
Is once lived a man who got all he ever wanted
Tell me something who could ask for more
Then to be living in a moment
Loving every minute
Tell me something who could ask for more
Then to be living in a moment you would die for

Living in a moment
I would die for
