Sometimes the mountains tower high above you
Sometimes the currents just too fast to swim
Life can carry you all kind of places.
Journey On.

Sometimes in the moment of your weakness
When you're on the edge of giving in
You hold your heart before it falls to pieces.
Journey On.

Journey On - hold your head above the water
Journey On - you can weather out this storm
Journey On - there's a better day coming
A better world than you have ever known

Journey On - someone's waiting by the river
Waiting there to take you by the hand
So make the most of all that you've been given
Journey On.

Anybody's ship can take on water
You gotta make the choice to sink or swim
Just grab a piece of rubble from the wreckage
Journey On.

Too many times your heart will leave you stranded
You bear the scars of where you've been
Don't be afraid to ask for new direction
And Journey On.

Journey On - hold your head above the water
Journey On - you can weather out this storm
Journey On - there's a better day a coming
Oh, a better world than you have ever known.

Journey On - someone's waiting by the river
Waiting there to take you by the hand
So make the most of all that you've been given
Journey On.

Journey On
Journey On.
