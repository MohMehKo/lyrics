It's amazing to me in a world full of wonders,
How wonderful she makes me feel.
I've been everywhere under the sun,
And there's nothing that can even compete,
With her touch. It's incredible,
Her love, some kind of miracle.

I don't need to take a plane, fly a mile above the rain,
Stand upon a mountain, have the world at my feet.
She's just got to smile that smile,
There no other place in the universe I'd rather be,
Than in the arms of the one who loves me.

It's a powerful thing to walk through the doorway,
Of somebody's heart and somebody's soul.
Now and for always wherever you are wherever you go.
And no high can be higher than her eyes looking into mine.

I don't need to take a plane, fly a mile above the rain,
Stand upon a mountain, have the world at my feet.
She's just got to smile that smile,
There no other place in the universe I'd rather be,
Than in the arms of the one who loves me.

The way she loves me.

Oh, I don't need to take a plane, fly a mile above the rain,
Stand upon a mountain, have the world at my feet.
She's just got to smile that smile,
There no other place in the universe I'd rather be,
Than in the arms of the one who loves me.
