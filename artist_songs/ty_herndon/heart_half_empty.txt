There's some leftover wine in the cupboard
'Bout a half a glass left for the road
Here's a toast to the time we were lovers
Then I'll go
Should I laugh or should I cry
Love you, hate you, live or die

Is my heart half full or half empty
Is our love like the wine in this glass
You drink like there's no tomorrow
(And we were) so sure it will (would) always last
Will the memories taste sweet as they linger
Or the bitterness stay on my tongue
Is my heart half full of the love you gave me
Or my heart half empty
(Is my heart half empty)
'Cause your love is gone

Your bags are all packed in the hallway
The boxes are stacked on the lawn
You kiss me goodbye just like always
And you're gone
Trembling hands or nerves of steel
Someone tell me what to feel

Is my heart half full or half empty
Is our love like the wine in this glass
You drink like there's no tomorrow
(And we were) so sure it will (would) always last
Will the memories taste sweet as they linger
Or the bitterness stay on my tongue
Is my heart half full of the love you gave me
Or my heart half empty
(Is my heart half empty)
'Cause your love is gone

Should I laugh or should I cry
Love you, hate you, live or die

Is my heart half full or half empty
Is our love like the wine in this glass
You drink like there's no tomorrow
(And we were) so sure it will (would) always last
Will the memories taste sweet as they linger
Or the bitterness stay on my tongue
Is my heart half full of the love you gave me
Or my heart half empty
(Is my heart half empty)
