You were the first one I ever hurt for
I was afraid of holdin' your hand
Out on a back road I told you I love you
You made a country boy feel like a man

[Chorus:]
Somewhere a lover lives for a moment
When he can touch her and give her his heart
Somewhere a strong man waits for a woman
And nothing in this world can keep them apart

I laughed at the way you were, so funny to look back now
Oh you were all, all I dreamed of

Sometimes I wonder if we would have lasted
If I was a fool to ever give you up

[Repeat Chorus]

Oh your still on my mind on a thin shadowed ledge
No matter what I do or say
But the river of time can take off the edge
But they can't take the rock away

[Repeat Chorus - fading out]
