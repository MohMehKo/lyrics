I watch it all spill out
I watch it all spill out
And then you tell me just how wrong I am.
And it drifts too far
I let it drift too far
Then you hit me with the wink of an eye.

Close your eyes
It's safe for you, safe for you.
Forfeit your mind.
It's safe for you, safe for you.

I see it all come around
I see it all come around
And then you tell me just how right I am.
Yeh, you like it now
Bring the enjoyment back
Then you hit me with that look of surprise.
