Bruised, but I won't tell about that
I can't escape the monotony of hate
And forgiveness can not become me
You can not come back to me
I won't sink to this (wonderful)
The tongue is in the cheek
If only my will was not so weak
You're so wrong, and so wrong
At least I think I've learned a lesson
'cause I can look back with retrospect
But not to ponder, and not to wonder

You are so wrong
I couldn't build it up to take it down
And I get you're so strong
I couldn't build it up to take up down

Hands appear at night
I feel as though I've been awake for days
But I shed my skin, and I shed my sleep chains
Look the other way as you come my way
You look slimmer and your breasts look better than ever
What the fuck?
No one ever sees, no one ever hears
All they can do is breathe, stop and touch

You are so wrong
I couldn't build it up to take it down
And I get you're so strong
I couldn't build it up to take up down
