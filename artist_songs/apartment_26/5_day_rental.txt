You would not believe what I saw 
One hundred million faces 
Screaming at me from behind a wall 
They cut the wire, those bastards. 

It wasn't enough to bleed and never enough 
To lure you down the corridor 
Yeah, my room's right at the end. 
Set to expel, and I was 
A steady increase, yes I was 
And I'm getting ready to return it to you. 

And now I'm so far gone 
Just thinking about it. 
I haven't changed my mind 
So forget about it. 

I'm unafraid of those approaching dogs 
Yeah, fuck them I'm five times their size 
Cut off the balls, gauge out the eyes 
Turn down the sound and adjust the lighting. 

I don't have enough to feed you and 
Your mouth full of uncertainty 
The image that I'm left with 
Is both pleasing and confusing. 
I will put up a fight and I will end up forgetting 
To return it to you. 

Now I'm so far gone 
Just thinking about it 
I haven't changed my mind 
Yeah, forget about it. 
It is not enough to beat 
No not enough to warrant you breaking my bones 
I said I'm so far gone 
Just forget about it. 

Be kind. rewind.
You'll get a fine. 
I'm getting ready to return it to you. 

Now I'm so far gone 
Just thinking about it 
You haven't changed my mind 
Yeah, forget about it. 
It is not enough to beat 
No not enough to warrant you breaking my bones 
Now I'm so far gone 
Just forget about it.
