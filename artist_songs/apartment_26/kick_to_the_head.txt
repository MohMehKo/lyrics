I tread the field again 
And awake myself with my intentions. 
As my deep sleep subsides 
I do my best not to disrupt the rest. 
My shape relies upon 
A kick to the head, but I'm safe 
Oh no, it seems as though a thought just leaked out. 

I see something, a smoke blurred vision 
Of preconceived notions. stop the snap-around with twisting action. 

I feel it kicking at my head 
Trying to tell me 
Not to let up where I stand, now. 
Well, I tell you... 

I tend to fall apart 
When I end up in this situation. 
Watching the passing time 
I hope we can escape the t.v. set. 
All clues are telling us 
We could have turned left at the last light. 
Oh no, I think I've gone and let another thought out. 

I feel something, a spatial essence 
I came out screaming. stop the snap-around with twisting action. 

There's something kicking at my head 
Trying to tell me 
Something I must ignore 
To make it. 

I feel it starting to fade. responsible for another downfall. 
Try to resist the change. twists inside you until you pull it out. 

Signal, enter, trusting, warmer, through. 

Signal, say no, signal, signal the downfall. down. 
Signal, say no, signal, feel, say no, say no, signal. feel. 

I see it starting to fade. put down the plan for the perfect downfall. 
Try to resist the change. twists inside you until you just pull it out. 

I'd really like to. I really like you. [till out]
