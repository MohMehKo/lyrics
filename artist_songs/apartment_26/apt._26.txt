Repetition of my mind inside decline
I'm sick of all the people telling me to read between the lines
Deja vu? True, Inside it is you.
I know I live inside a world who hates my mind
but I don't mind the hate
Again, again baby bitch socialist
Synchronize the synthesis, belive in your existance
I hate you, but could not change you, so

I wonder what he said, either way I'm dead
Stupid inset, stupid inset
I wonder what she said, all the way my friend
Stupid inset, stupid inset

The repetition of our minds, beside and behind
I'm sick of all the people telling me to read between their lines
Deja vu? True. Inside it is you
I know I live inside a mind who hates the world so I reinvent.

I wonder what he said, either way I'm dead
Stupid inset, stupid inset
I wonder what she said, all the way my friend
Stupid inset, stupid inset

Synchronize the synthesis. Believe in your existance
I live inside a world who hates my mind so I reinvent
I live inside a head you hates the world so I reinvent. I reinvent.
I reinvent.
Deja vu? True. Inside it is you
I know I live inside a world who hates the world so I reinvent.

I wonder what he said, either way I'm dead
Stupid inset, stupid inset
I wonder what she said, all the way my friend
Stupid inset, stupid inset
