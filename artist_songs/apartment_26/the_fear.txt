She lays naked and stretched out
Like I could only help her when she's moist
Waiting on the floor
She could have been just about anything
But she thought that 'cause it didn't work
To leave herself in her own private world
And in this world, she is beautiful
And in this world, she is beautiful
She is beautiful to me

It's only right when it's not mine
It's only right when I run from the fear
It's only right when it shouldn't be
It's only right in her would full of you

And you're not mine when I run from you
What it could have been in a world full or fear

It's only right when it's not mine
It's only right when I run from the fear
It's only right when it shouldn't be
It's only right in her would full of you
