The situation is critical.
Evacuate, alarm, strapped down and still.
Flicked switched will detonate; 
Causing me no harm till I'm cut to size.

I call to memory times I
Hold you down like that.

Does anyone believe it's me
That I'm trying to rescue?
There's something like a void I feel,
And I'm dying to tell you.

It's causing us no harm,
So hold me open, calm me down
Like that.
