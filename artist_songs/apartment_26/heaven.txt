The exit passes you by
As they proceed to dance
A shadow disrupts my light
Eternally almost over
Can you still hear me down there?
I set my sites at the core
There is not enough here for us all
In heaven everything is fine
You've got your good things, and I've got mine
In heaven this could be divine
So much better kept in your mind

You tore apart the inside
Leaving the outside clean
I'm shouting at the brick wall
Just to hear my own echo
Each and every day
Taken the wrong way.

[Chorus]

Who knew?
Illusions that re-define
So much safer kept in your mind.

[Chorus]

In heaven
In heaven everything is fine
Everything is fine
