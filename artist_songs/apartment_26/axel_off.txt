With strong intent I set the goal
Now spin the wheel, let the dice roll
I just try to be aware!
Arms stretchin out to take it all
Now spin the wheel and answer the call.
I just try to be aware.
I'm so enlightened by every corner of this box I chose
To live in. impatiently I wait.

Feeling alright?
You're the one I lean toward.
Gonna get it right
You're the one I lean toward.

What kind of purpose do you have?
I never meant to make you mad
Just try to be aware!
I wait for you, to keep the peace
Drippin with sweat and filth and grease
You should try to be aware!
Oh the stakes are increasing
You know it's just a business to me
Oh the insanity
Just take it by the scruff of the neck

[chorus]

You say you don't feel safe
So cover up your head
Quit lookin over there
Where do you want to go?
Feel free to take a seat
Just try to be aware!

That I am the devil
Dressed up like you 
To lure you into a
False sense of security oh wait ...

[chorus]
