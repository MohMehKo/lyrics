If I gave it all, I'd have nothing to give
If I gave it all, I'd have nothing to give you
If I gave it all, I'd have nothing to give
If I gave it all, I'd become void

If I let you know, I know that you'd forget
If I let you care, I'll have a fate of regret
What could I do to prepare for the backlash?
Crash, smash, how long will it last?

If I gave it all, I'd have nothing to give
If I gave it all, I'd have nothing to give you
If I gave it all, I'd have nothing to give
If I gave it all, I'd become void

When I come back, don't expect me to be here
Life is like a re-run; commercial free
Sponsored by the sacrifice of individuality
Easier to take away what was never missing

If I gave it all, I'd have nothing to give
If I gave it all, I'd have nothing to give you
If I gave it all, I'd have nothing to give
If I gave it all, I'd become void

Six double five three two one
You could not know just what it's become
Six double five three two one
You could not know just what it's become
Six double five three two one
You could not know just what it's become

If I gave it all, I'd have nothing to give
If I gave it all, I'd have nothing to give you
If I gave it all, I'd have nothing to give
If I gave it all, I'd become void

If I gave it all, I'd have nothing to give
If I gave it all, I'd have nothing to give you
If I gave it all, I'd have nothing to give
If I gave it all, I'd become void
