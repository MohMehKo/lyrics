I'm drowned out like I'm supposed to be
Nobody doubts your sanctity
I'm not alone, but I'm supposed to be
And so I doubt your faith in me

This isn't real. I can not feel. I do not want.
Anymore
I am alive, but it's not mine. I do not want
Anymore
If all I say turns to be true
And everything comes back to you
Then everything inside me figures out what I'm supposed to be

I shout out. Nobody's listening
And they don't care. Believe in me
You're all cried out like you had asked to be
You're all alone, no sympathy

This isn't real. I can not feel. I do not want.
Anymore
I am alive, but it's not mine. I do not want
Anymore
If all I say turns to be true
And everything comes back to you
Then everything inside me figures out what I'm supposed to be

Anymore [x4]

She bows down, persuasive to the skin
Both touch and taste pass into me
They're not alone
Sometimes I wish you're me
And then I doubt you'll come to be

This isn't real. I can not feel. I do not want.
Anymore
I am alive, but it's not mine. I do not want
Anymore
If all I say turns to be true
And everything comes back to you
Then everything inside me figures out what I'm supposed to be
