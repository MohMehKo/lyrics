Accumulate into one 
The second half has begun 
And I'm not the judge. 
Innocent are hung 
Remain unsung 
And I hold a grudge. 
Take a stab in the dark 
And then it comes as a shock 
Finger on the pulse. 
Everything that can 
Happens to the man; 
See the mannequin smile. 

When I am running out 
I am running out. 
I am running out. 

Switch the moon and the sun 
Shield and the gun 
Clip after clip. 
I'd love to stay and watch 
Make mine what you clutch; 
Empire slips. 
The weight is too much to hold 
Excuses old 
I realize. 
Everything that can 
Happens to the man 
See the mannequin smile. 

You don't get it like I get it. (you don't get it) like I do. 
You don't get it like I get it. (you don't get it) like I do. 

When I am running out 
I am running out. 
I am running out. 

Empire slips. 
Excuses old 
I realize. 
Everything that can 
Happens to the man 
See the mannequin smile. 

When I am running out 
I am running out. 
I am running out.
