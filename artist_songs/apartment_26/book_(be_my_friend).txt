Alright fine. Go on be like that. 
See how much it matters when the crowd begins to chatter 
About you and the state you're in 
Doesn't mean a thing doesn't mean a thing. 
I resign, not even born. 
Expect the worst to happen and no more disappointments 
It doesn't mean a thing, doesn't mean a thing (no!) 
Say goodbye to it, say goodbye to id. 

Like a savior, coming down 
You got just enough time now rest assured. 
The savior is coming down 
You got just enough time now rest assured 
If you want to step up and be my friend 
Sorry sir, you can't contend 
If you wanna step up and be my friend 
Sorry baby, you can't come in. 

I'm not blind, I can see where this is going 
My lips are sealed and I'm not even speaking 
That's fine, cause I get it now 
My level of excitement just enough so you dot notice 
What did I say? what did I say? 
Better check the records, make sure everything is covered. 
Turn around, come on, shake it up shake it up. 
It doesn't mean a thing. 

Like a savior, coming down 
You got just enough time now rest assured. 
The savior is coming down 
You got just enough time now rest assured 
If you want to step up and be my friend 
Sorry sir, you can't contend 
If you wanna step up and be my friend 
Sorry baby, you can't come in. 

The savior is coming down... you got just enough time, now rest assured... 
Don't mean a thing if it aint got that swing. 

The savior 
Is coming down (it's coming, it's coming) 
If you want to step up and be my friend, sorry baby you can't contend. 
If you want to step up and be my friend... sorry sir you can't contend. 

WHAM-O !!!!!
