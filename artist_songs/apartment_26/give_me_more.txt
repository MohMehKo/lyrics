Give me more 
Like that 
We watch it settle down 
And capitalize on whatever moves 
Grab a little bit for your friends 
Before they catch you. 
You better hide yourself away 
Now they've set off to come capture you. 
Get rid of that evidence 
They're gonna catch you. 

Help me decipher 
Secrets. please don't tell. 
Can I borrow some sugar? 
Give me more. 

On my own 
They're gonna get you 
And all stretched out 
They're on their way now 
It feels like I've been here for hours 
And I am all stretched out. 

Then when you show your hands 
See them glow eight shades of red 
Bit late to think of alibis 
Just answer the question. 
Here's where the truth comes out 
Veil lifted, your secrets out 
Quit crying innocence 
They've already got you. 

Help me decipher 
Secrets. please don't tell. 
Stand up! make us proud! 
Carry on your back. 
Hold on, you're not done yet 
Finish what you started. 
Can I borrow some sugar? 
Give me more.
