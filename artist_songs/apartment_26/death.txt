I love the sound of your tears
I can't listen anymore
Are you choking on your words?
He never got on his knee
If one little push is all it took
Maybe one would help to realize
You're the edge on which I live 
I stare but I see nothing
You're not here to guide me
Can't break the flow - one more push

Give it to me
You should know that I'll take more from you
Give it to me
You should hope that I will not cut you out

Take one last look as me and tell me if I change
Or just give in to temptations around me
Maybe when I come back I'll be known a little more
But then I could be known less
Misconceptions made me

Give it to me
You should know that I'll take more from you
Give it to me
You should hope that I will not cut you out

Sounds are not so clear
Distortion making clearer
(Hounded/Handed) out kisses
Slow it down, but make it faster
Finish up the beinning
Shine the light on my shadow
Relaxation techniques
Pointing at an arrow
Reach out your arms to be held
Stretch out your mouth to be loved
Can't break the flow - one more push

[x3]
Give it to me
You should know that I'll take more from you
Give it to me
You should hope that I will not cut you out
