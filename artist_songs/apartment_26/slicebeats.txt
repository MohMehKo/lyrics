All of this here for me
With nothing left to be
Unwilling to succeed, my head up in the clouds
I feel I left behind when i set out to find a new beginning
But I feel I have betrayed you

I'm changing, and I'm not coming back
Distance yourself from me
Once you stop infinity
You had your chance and it passed

[Chorus (x2)]
This is where it began, so this is where I am
So much has changed and nothing's changed at all

Through the stress you undress
You forgot how coming home all alone would have wrecked you
He is not who you thought you had wanted
But intead he is dead, resurrected
I feel I left behind when I set out to find a new beginning
But I feel I betrayed you

I'm changing, and I'm not coming back
Distance yourself from me
Once you stop infinity
You had your chance and it passed

[Chorus (x2)]
This is where it began, so this is where I am
So much has changed and nothing's changed at all

Another one born today. Another one went away
Another false hope today. Another hope went away

[Chorus (x2)]
This is where it began, so this is where I am
So much has changed and nothing's changed at all

You told me to go
But when I do, it's not good enough
You told me to learn
But when I try, it's to intrusive

This is where it began, so this is where I am [x9]
