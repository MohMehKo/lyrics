I'm just a selfish man
You will not let me be, no.
Give you whatever I can
Somehow I'm the enemy.
I hope you understand
It's not my job to explain
You are the lucky one
I am the selfish king.

Because I remember what you told me.
I'm the one that you adore
Get you through this stupid world
Make you laugh and make you cry
I'll be sticking 'round a while.

Now I want you
Go go go go go go go !

No time for also-rans
No place for apologies, no.
I got a simple plan
Tell me are you in or out now?
Just an idea of mine
This here's decision time
You think the game is won
I'll put you to an end.

Because I remember what I told you.
You're the one that I adore
Get me through this stupid world
I must be crazy, don't know why
I'll be sticking 'round a while.

I am the selfish king, my rules will keep you in
Mishaps and dumb mistakes? go on and pull the other one.
I am the selfish king, livin out a tired reign.
You better play my game, unless you know another way.

I remember.... I remember what you told me
Because I remember what I told you
[chorus...]

Now I want you
Now I want you
Now I want you
Now I want you!
