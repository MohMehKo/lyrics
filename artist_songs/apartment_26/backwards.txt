Finished looking for the answers
Now I'm looking for the questions
I can look into your mirror and see inside your head
See my reflections and this is what I've bled
I look right into your mirror but I can't see me

[Chorus (x2)]
Everything's gone backwards
Nothing's what it seems
I awake from my nightmares
Smash the mirror, smash the dreams

Backwards into future
Now you're making up for lost time
I hide under the shadow and try to hide my name
Eyes that will question and this is what I mean
I look back into your mirror
But still don't see me

[Chorus (x2)]
Everything's gone backwards
Nothing's what it seems
I awake from my nightmares
Smash the mirror, smash the dreams

[x3]
Smash the mirror
Smash the dreams

[Chorus (x2)]
Everything's gone backwards
Nothing's what it seems
I awake from my nightmares
Smash the mirror, smash the dreams [x3]
