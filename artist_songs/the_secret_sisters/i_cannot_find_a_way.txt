So long, so long
How we barely hanging on
By a threat, my foolish head.
Isn't sure we can ever get on
Somewhere within a little voice is telling me to try again

I cannot find a away to say goodbye
When I decide to give my heart it is no longer mine!

Farewell, it's hard
I don't believe we are better off apart
Let's see, it's true,
Cause I don't know how to be away from you.
So stay with me,
Next to you is where I really wanna be!

I can't find away to say goodbye
When I decide to give my heart it is no longer mine!

My heart chose you,
It doesn't listen when I tell her what to do!

I can't find away to say goodbye
When I decide to give my heart it is no longer mine!
