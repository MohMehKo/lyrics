I'd never tell a man to ask my Daddy for my hand.
I've got a thousand tales about the temper of that man.
He'd shoot a man who came within a mile of my young frame.
But I know that you will take the risk so I can take your name.

You've got the ring; I've got the keys and sixty miles a head.
Iuka, Mississippi, where the two of us will wed.

Take me down to Iuka, Mississippi 'fore he knows the two of us have up and gone.
Take me down to Iuka, Mississippi we can run away and never come home.
Never come home.

My daddy finally knocked a little sense right into me.
So I asked around until I found the Justice of the Peace.
The bruises on my body can't be hidden anymore.
So park your car upon the hill, I'm headed out the door.

Step easy so my daddy doesn't hear us sneak away.
Hang around, he'll shoot you down, that's why we just can't stay.

Take me down to Iuka, Mississippi 'fore he knows the two of us have up and gone.
Take me down to Iuka, Mississippi we can run away and never come home.
Follow close behind me, not much further now.
Oh, it's just a shadow, I didn't hear a sound.
Ain't no way he heard us, ain't no way he'll come.
I hear someone breathing, hold my hand and run.

Somewhere in the river there's a gun the devil owned.
Somehow everybody knew that everything was wrong.
A noose up in the maple tree; the old man's gonna pay.
Two headstones for two lovers who finally got away.

Take me down to Iuka, Mississippi 'fore he knows the two of us have up and gone.
Take me down to Iuka, Mississippi we can run away and never come home.
Take me down to Iuka, Mississippi 'fore he knows the two of us have up and gone.
Take me down to Iuka, Mississippi we can run away and never come home.

Never come home.
Never come home.
Never come home.
