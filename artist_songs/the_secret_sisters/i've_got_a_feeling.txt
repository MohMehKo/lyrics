I've got a feelin'
That you're gonna leave me.
I've got a feelin'
You're gonna put me down.

I've got a feelin'
You tried to deceive me.
I've got a feelin'
That you've been running around.

No matter what I say my words drift away from you
No matter how I try still I never satisfy
Tell me why. Tell me why.

I've got a feelin'
You wanna say good bye.
I've got a feelin' but I'm too proud to cry.

No matter what I say my words drift away from you
No matter how I try still I never satisfy
Tell me why. Tell me why.

I've got a feelin'
You wanna say good bye.
I've got a feelin' but I'm too proud to cry.

to cry..to cry..to cry..to cry..to cry..to cry
