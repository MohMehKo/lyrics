I’ve got a bad habit
One that I’ve been trying to keep
Killin’ me slowly from the inside out
Making me, making me sin

There ain’t no cure for my problem
No program or patch, I don’t get
Cause this little habit grows stronger
With the rise and fall of your cheer

I’m trying to quit you
And it’s making a mess
I can see
Shaking hands they can hard
It’s gonna tear me apart
I just know it
I’ll never be free
I can’t break this bad habit
Cause this habit is breaking me

I’ve got a bad, bad habit
When I just can't seem to keep
Wasting my place and taking years from my love
It seems I get older to quit, older to quit

I’m trying to quit you
And it’s making a mess, I can see
Shaking hands they can hard
It’s gonna tear me apart
I just know it
I’ll never be free
I can’t break this bad habit
Cause this habit is breaking me

I’ve got a bad, bad habit
I’ve got a bad, bad habit
I’ve got a bad habit...

I can’t break this bad habit
Cause this habit is breaking me
