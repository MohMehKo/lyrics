Please don't say goodbye
Give me another try
I'm black and blue
Worrying over you

You stand the whole night
In the kitchen door
Can't help but wonder what you're waiting for
I know you'd rather be anywhere but here

Baby, listen!

Have you forgotten all your promises?
The simple magic and the quiet kiss
How did we go drowning in these tears?

Oh, wo, wo wo beggin' please,
Won't say goodbye,
Give me another try
I'm black and blue
Worrying over you

I tied a ribbon and I walked the floor
I know you didn't love me anymore
Your heart belongs to someone new

Baby, listen!

If you believe me then it's not too late
And I'll be praying all the while I wait
I still belong to you

Oh, wo, wo wo beggin' please,
Won't say goodbye,
Give me another try
I'm black and blue
Worrying over you
