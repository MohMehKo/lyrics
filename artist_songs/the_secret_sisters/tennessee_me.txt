Come, Come Tenessee Me
Tenessee Me waiting here
I'm lonely tonight but feeling alright
Why don't you come over here?
Why don't you come over here?

Oh, Oh Tenessee Me
Tenessee Me see me loving you
See me by the fire side light
Come and see me through the night
Tenessee me through the night

If you chose the world to see
Just leave your heart in Tenessee

Plain, Plain Tenessee Me
Living just a mile away
I'm nothing special but I can hold you
If you want to, you can stay
Tenessee Me won't you stay?

Please, Please Tenessee Me
See me lookin' in your eyes
Tenessee Me wants to love
Wants to love you all my life
Let me love you all my life
