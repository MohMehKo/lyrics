'Go to the river Jordan', said the prophet to the king
'Wash in that murky water seven times and you'll be clean'
Yeah, that deep rollin' river's gonna make you new and whole
And the faith acquired in you will save your soul

Let's go down to the river, raise our voices and pray
And get ourselves a snow white robe to wear
Take away all the stains, remove each and every one
In the name of the Father and the Son

Jesus said to John the Baptist, burry me in that cold grave
In the Jordan's icy water, I will show you all the way
And a light came down from Heaven saying this is My own son
And I sure am please with what has just been done

Let's go down to the river, raise our voices and pray
And get ourselves a snow white robe to wear
Take away all the stains, remove each and every one
In the name of the Father and the Son

I'm looking for the river Jordan, that old life giving stream
Within it's wave of mercy sweet forgiveness ever teamed
I'm a weary broken soul living in a house of clay
And that river's gonna wash my sins away

Let's go down to the river, raise our voices and pray
And get ourselves a snow white robe to wear
Take away all the stains, remove each and every one
In the name of the Father and the Son
In the name of the Father and the Son

Bury me, bury me river Jordan...
