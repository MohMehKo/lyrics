I know it's not a perfect world
But tonight I'm the perfect girl
I had a man but he just lied,
Good luck, good night, goodbye

You think I need some company
You're sitting awful close to me
You're getting cozy and you're making eyes
Good luck, good night, goodbye
Good luck, good night, goodbye

Your words just make me doubt it
So just forget about it
If love hurts, who really needs it anyway
I hate to burst your bubble
But all I see is trouble
This is a game that I won't play

Call me crazy, call me mean
You're the last thing that I need
Give another girl a try
Good luck, good night, goodbye

Hey, hey, oh, oh, woo wee, no, no
Yeah, yeah oh my, my
Good luck, good night, goodbye
Good luck, good night, goodbye

There ain't no way around it
Don't wanna think about it
If love hurts, who really needs it anyway?
I hate to burst your bubble
But all I see is trouble
This is a game that I won't play

I've felt the pain that lovers feel
I've got the scars that just don't heal
Go on, don't waste your time
Good luck, good night, goodbye

Go on, don't waste your time
Good luck, good night, goodbye
