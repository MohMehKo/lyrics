I'm living on a lonely island
And I love this ocean full of misery
I'll die here, on my lonely island
Unless you give back your sweet love back to me

I can't seem to take it
I'm blue as I can be
I'm blind to any other lovers' charm

I know I can make it
Without your love for me
I've got to have you back
Here in my arms

I'm living on a lonely island
And I love this ocean full of misery
I'll die here, on my lonely island
Unless you give your sweet love back to me
