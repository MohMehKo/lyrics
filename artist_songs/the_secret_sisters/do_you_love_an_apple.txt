Do you love an apple?
Do you love a pear?
Do you love a laddy
With curly brown hair?

Why, yes, I love him
I'll never deny him
I'll always love him
Till the day that I die

Before I got married
I wore a black shall
But after I married
I wore bugger-all

But still I love him
I'll never deny him
I'll always love him
Till the day that I die

He stands on the corner
A fag in his mouth
His hands in his pockets
He whistles me out

But still I love him
I'll never deny him
I'll always love him
Till the day that I die

Do you love an apple?
Do you love a pear?
Do you love a laddy
With curly brown hair?

Why, yes, I love him
I'll never deny him
I'll always love him
Till the day that I die
