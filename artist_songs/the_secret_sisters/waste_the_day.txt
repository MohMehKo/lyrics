Waste the day
Waste the night
I want you to be alright
When I'm gone I hope your bed's still warm
And that you find another charming girl to hold

You tight
Waste the day
Waste the night
Just like you wasted mine, pretty baby

Wouldn't take a special girl
To hold you as you dream
Just a pair of loving arms is all you need
But she wouldn't last too long
In the morning she'd be gone
Did you notice I'm still here
After all these wasted years?

Waste the day
Waste the night
I want you to be alright
When I'm gone I hope your bed's still warm
And that you find another charming girl to hold

You tight
Waste the day
Waste the night
Just like you wasted mine, pretty baby

Waste the day
Waste the night
I want you to be alright
When I'm gone I hope your bed's still warm
And that you find another charming girl to hold

You tight
Waste the day
Waste the night
Just like you wasted mine, pretty baby
Just like you wasted mine, pretty baby
