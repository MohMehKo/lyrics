Oh, tell me, why, baby, why, baby, why, baby, why
You make me cry, baby, cry, baby, cry, baby, cry?
Lord, I can't help but love you 'til the day that I die
So tell me, why, baby, why, baby, why, baby, why?

Well, I got a crow I wanna pick with you
Just like last time when the feathers flew
You're runnin' wild kickin' up your heels
A-leavin' me at home with a hand full of bills

Lord, I can't live without you, you know it's true
But there's no livin' with you so what'll I do?
I'm goin' honky tonkin', get as tight as I can
And maybe while I'm there, I'm gonna find a new man

Oh, tell me, why, baby, why, baby, why, baby, why
You make me cry, baby, cry, baby, cry, baby, cry?
Lord, I can't help but love you 'til the day that I die
So tell me, why, baby, why, baby, why, baby, why?

Well, I don't know but I've heard 'em say
That every little dog's a-gonna have his day
You'd better pay attention, don't you dare forget
'Cause I'm just a little bitty puppy yet

Well, I caught you honky tonkin' with my best friend
The thing to do was leave you but I shoulda left then
Now I'm too old to leave you but I still get sore
When you come home a-feelin' for the knob on the door

Oh, tell me, why, baby, why, baby, why, baby, why
You make me cry, baby, cry, baby, cry, baby, cry?
Oh, Lord, I can't help but love you 'til the day that I die
So tell me, why, baby, why, baby, why, baby, why?

Tell me, why, baby, why, baby, why, baby, why?
