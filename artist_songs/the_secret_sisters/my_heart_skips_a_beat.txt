Oh, my heart skips a beat
When we walk down the street
I feel the tremblin' in my knees
And just to know you're mine
Until the end of time
Makes my heart skip a beat

Well, I did a double take the day I met you
And my heart turned a flip as I stood next to you
And I knew right there I never could forget you
For you are my every dream come true

And my heart skips a beat
When we walk down the street
I feel a tremblin' in my knees
And just to know you're mine
Until the end of time
Makes my heart skip a beat

You came into my life without a warnin'
And you turned my cloudy skies from gray to blue
You're my sunshine that comes up every mornin'
Yes, you are my every dream come true

And my heart skips a beat
When we walk down the street
I feel a tremblin' in my knees
And just to know you're mine
Until the end of time
Makes my heart skip a beat
