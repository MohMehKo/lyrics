Let there be lonely, I'm ready to grieve
The love I've been holdin’ on to
I've tried so hard to keep sayin’ you're mine
Now it's time, now it's time

Let there be hurtin’ I'm craving the tears
That have burned in my eyes for so long
I want to feel every drop of the pain
As I cry, as I cry

I'm gonna’ suffer the aching I've earned
Mark this one down as a lesson I've learned
'Cause the only way out of here
It's the only way out of here

Let there be daggers that tear through my skin
Down to my heart where the whole thing begins
Make me a new one and I'll love again
Until then, until then

Let there be lonely

It's the only way out of here
Oh the only way out of here

Let there be lonely I'm ready to grieve
the love I've been holding on to
I've tried so hard to keep sayin’ you're mine
Now it's time, now it's time
