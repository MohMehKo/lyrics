Baby I see you’ve been up to nothing good
I got a hunch you would leave me if you could
You only keep me around for the company
If you wanna know the truth, I don’t wanna be apart
But I don’t like the way you’ve been careless with my heart
You gotta straighten up, but baby you won’t
Who’s gonna love you if I don’t?

You think I’m in the dark, you think that I can’t see
The way you like to play when you are away from me
Boy anybody could see that you are doing me wrong
Who’s gonna love you if I don’t?

Who’s gonna love you if I don’t
Who’s gonna give you what you want
Who in the world will put up with your little schemes?
You better get yourself in check
Out of my own self respect
I’m gonna walk away and leave you all alone
Who’s gonna love you if I don’t?
Tell me who’s gonna love you if I don’t?

Let me make it clear, am I getting through?
Nobody that you meet when you’re hunting someone new
Is gonna stick around the way I always do
I don’t think you see what you got when you got me
I’m laying down the rules, this is how it’s gotta be
You’re gonna change your ways
Or honey, I’m gone
Who’s gonna love you if I don’t?

Who’s gonna love you if I don’t
Who’s gonna give you what you want
Who in the world will put up with your little schemes?
You better get yourself in check
If you’ve got any self respect
I’m gonna walk away and leave you all alone
Who’s gonna love you if I don’t?
Tell me who’s gonna love you if I don’t?
Baby who’s gonna love you if I don’t?
Who’s gonna love you if I don’t?
