I told the daffodils
I told the Whippoorwills
Just how pretty your smile
Yes, I told them all about you

I told each little bird
Every little single word
That you say is worthwhile
Yes, I told them all about you

I told the moon and every little star
That shines above
'Bout the way you roll your eyes
And how you love

Each little honey bee
Knows there's gonna be
A honey moon for two
Yes, I told them all about you

I told the daffodils
I told the Whippoorwills
Just how pretty your smile
Yes, I told them all about you

I told each little bird
Every little single word
That you say is worthwhile
Yes, I told them all about you

I told the moon and every little star
That shines above
'Bout the way you roll your pretty eyes
And how you love

Each little honey bee
Knows there's gonna be
A honey moon for two
Yes, I told them all about you

I told the daffodils
I told the Whippoorwills
Just how pretty your smile
Yes, I told them all about you

I told each little bird
Every little single word
That you say is worthwhile
Yes, I told them all about you

I told the moon and every little star
That shines above
'Bout the way you roll your pretty eyes
And how you love

Each little honey bee
Knows there's gonna be
A honey moon for two
Yes, I told them all about you
Yes, I told them all about you
