never before would he even thought it
take her life away
nothing could give her peace but leaving
careful what you say
he sees the pain
that no one else is seeing
he feels the pain
that no one else is feeling

[pre-chorus:]
not you've gone past the point
you can't take
now you've gone past the point
you can't stop all the suffering
stop all the pain

[chorus:]
old man stop the pain
now your life is stained
[repeat]

had it been the other way around
there's nothing I would change here
for my sake, for her sake
hey, it's not a life I'm ending
hold on to nothing
i'll set you free

[pre-chorus]

[chorus]

go to sleep softly and know this
i'm gonna take away the only thing you have left
because you can't speak to ask
i will send you on your way

it's the way it's gotta be
to set her free
take another shot old man
it's the way it's gotta be
you know what you are ending

[modified chorus]

it's the way it's gotta be
to set her free
take another shot old man
it's the way it's gotta be
old man
