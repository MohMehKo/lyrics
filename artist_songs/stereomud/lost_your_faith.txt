brace for the hit
is it too late?
did you wait undiscouraged?
you didn't think
condescending
was your thick skin cut too deep?
stop pretending
bow your head
accept your fate

[pre-chorus:]
you've come so far
don't hesitate

[chorus:]
you lost your faith
you know, you know
you lost your faith
you know, you know
you lost your faith
am I hitting on something you hate?
you lost your faith
you know

did they stick it in your face?
drag you down and humilate
did you change?
try too hard, overcompensate?
social reject
was it always like this?
did you infect?
bow your head
accept your fate

[pre-chorus]

[chorus]

are you lost undecided?
with the more that I say
i will say this to you one more time
don't you know that you're bothering me

[pre-chorus]

[chorus]
