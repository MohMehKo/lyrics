what's the matter with you?
can't you face me?
i can't imagine the things that you're thinking
nevermind your apologies
come
are we closer now?

[chorus:]
wait
you're nothing but a trick
with your selfish ways
you're nothing but a trick
and I'll see you fade
[repeat]

closer
are we closer now?

what's the problem now?
do you hate me?
i can't imagine the way
that you're feeling
so much animosity
come
are we closer now?

[chorus]

are we closer now?

[chorus]

you're nothing but a trick
you're nothing but a trick
are we closer now?
