When will I be homeis what you want to know
But all I can say is I don't know when
Can't see to find my way... and it's killing me slowly

Please don't forget me I am out here trying to find you...

Show me some kind of light I can barely see it
Don't want to think that it's hopeless
Show me some kind of light I can barely see it
Don't want to think I'm lost

Everytime I left it was so far away
No I never thought that it would be like this
Wish I could thank you for the patience that you gave me
It's all I, I can can do so don't give up on me
Hope you know it's your faith that's guiding me

Please don't forget me I am out here trying to find you...

Show me some kind of light I can barely see it
Don't want to think it's hopeless
Show me some kind of light I can barely see it
Don't want to think I'm lost

Please don't forget me

Show me some kind of light I can barely see it
DOn't want to think that it's hopeless
Show me some kind of light I can barely see it
Don't want to think I'm lost

If I'm out here without your light
I can never find my way home
