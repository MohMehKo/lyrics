I want to say I want to do better
I need to start a new life
First thing's to let go of the time that's passed us by
I'd  like to be the one that you call for
When you're not sure what's right
Hope I'm not asking too much because I miss you

I watched you crawl... I made you suffer
I'm so sorry I let you down
I am coming home to you as fast as I can
This time I won't let you down no

How can I get back
It's been on my mind for far too long
I can never get it back
But if you would let me in I swear
I'll be a better man
I'm so sorry I wasn't there

I believe it's hard for you to picture
You and me and everything's nice
This time I'm going to make sure I'm always in your life
If it takes a little longer than we thought
For us to work this out
I hope at least you know I've always missed you

I watched you crawl... I made you suffer
I'm so sorry I let you down
I am coming home to you as fast as I can
This time I won't let you down no

How can I get back
It's been on my mind for far too long
I can never get it back
ALl the time I wasted
But if you would let me in I swear
I'll be a better man
I'm so sorry I wasn't there

I am coming home
I am coming home
This time I won't let you down I won't hurt you

How can I get back
It's been on my mind for far too long
I can never get it back
All the time I wasted it
But if you would let me in I swear
I'll be a better man
I'm so sorry I wasn't there
