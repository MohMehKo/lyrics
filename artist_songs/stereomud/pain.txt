With every form you come 
you surprise me 
hypnotize me 
with every breath i take 
you're depriving 
suffocating...choking 

Now the time has come 
when i tell myself 
there's nothing more i can take 
then you show me 

willi t matter right now? 
if i'm already numb 
that's what you do to control me... 
to control me 

so much sadness from me 
that's the way i feel 
all the madness from me 
that's what makes you real 
i don't want your 
pain pain pain pain 

with every cut you make 
you expose me 
cause you know me 
with every bottle drank 
you can drown me 
cause you found me...out 

now the time has come 
when i tell myself 
there's nothing more i can take 
then you show me... 

will it matter right now? 
if i'm already numb 
that's what you do to control me... 
to control me 

so much sadness from me 
that's the way i feel 
all the madness from me 
that's what makes you real 
i don't want your 

pain pain pain 

with every form you take 
with every cut you make 

so much 

pain pain pain pain 

so much sadness from me 
thats the way i feel 
all the madness from me 
thats what makes you real 
i dont want your 

pain pain pain 

so much sadness
