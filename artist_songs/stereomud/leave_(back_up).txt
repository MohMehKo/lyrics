this won't be what you want to hear
coming from me
i'm tired of hiding my hate inside from you
i can't take it all right now
i think you should

[pre-chorus:]
just stay away, get away, run away
so far away that you're never gonna see me
you don't wanna face the reality
that you'll never be nothing more
nothing less to me
[repeat]

[chorus:]
back up, back off
you're always pushing me
back up, back off
you're right on top of me
get out, get out, get out
what do you want from me?
the hate inside of me
you bring it out of me

so beautiful
you're confusing me
it's hard to let go
how did I make it this far away from you?
i've heard all the lies that won't come true
i wish you would 

[pre-chorus]

[chorus]

go on get out, go on get out
why are you always pushing me?
what you should do
what you should do 
is leave 

[pre-chorus]

[chorus]

Do you feel like everyone else feels?
