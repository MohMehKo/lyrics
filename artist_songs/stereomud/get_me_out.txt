there is nothing more for me to give
took it all away and walked out again
no matter what you say to me
it's what you did
face it, face it
i'm feeling confident it's going to end
you're crazy if you think that I'm staying here
nothing left for me to say
i'm outta here
outta here, outta here

[pre-chorus:]
you drive me straight into rage
i can't wait

[chorus:]
get me out of this place I don't want to be
take me out of this place I don't want to be
get me out of this place
can't you hear me?
get me out
get me out
get me out of here

like a rat you put me in a maze
with every single turn it's only walls I face
leaving me here to die without a trace
face it, face it
i'm taking all the strength I have within
push myself further than I've ever been
and I won't leave without you knowing this
know this, know this

[pre-chorus]

[chorus]

come and get me if you think you can
i'll be right here where I've always been
i'll be the rat that gets away
i'll be the rat that gets away

life's too short for all your time
to throw away

[pre-chorus]

[chorus]
