the longest day
the longest day of my life
and honestly I'm right on the edge
of descending
big finger point
i'm not afraid
it's starting to be the way
that I want it

[pre-chorus:]
tell me
what else left to say?
tell me

[chorus:]
don't bring me down from here
me down from here
[repeat]

as simple as a lack of communication
can you tell me?
if not the case
then why in the fuck did you judge me
big finger point
i'm not afraid
it's starting to be the way
that I want it

[pre-chorus]

[chorus]

did you think that
we would forget this?

[pre-chorus]

[chorus]

there's nothing left to say
there's nothing left to say
