You're more than my addiction
You're the beautiful one that I have found
You're my secret and I've waited
For far too long
You've been such an affliction
Condescending to me I will hold you down
Till I show you what it's like to be betrayed
You'll never stop looking for you

You want for me to forget
What I have felt for so long

I will find you in the darkest room you hide in
I will find you and you know I will

You're your own contradiction
It's misleading when you smile and scream
You're confusing at the same time
Abusing me abusing me
And no matter what you think
How convincing you are you can't fool me
'Cause I know you and I'll show
You ya feel the same
You'll never stop me looking for you

You wait for me to forget
What I have felt for so long

I will find you in the darkest room you hide in
I will find you and you know I will

You don't have to hide from me anymore
'Cause I know everything about you
No you don't have to hide from me anymore
'Cause I'm coming to find

I will find you in the darkest room you hide in
I will find you and you know I will

Give in give in
Can't escape from me
Give in...
