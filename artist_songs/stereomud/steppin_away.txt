i thought I made it so clear
you made a change in my life
i watched you disappear
tell you the truth
i'm not lonely

[chorus:]
now you're stepping away from me
one foot at a time
now you're stepping away from me
hope it's the last time

cold and lonely
what's your biggest fear?
feeling empty inside
don't want to see you come closer here
i'd hate to say it's just over

[chorus]

cold and lonely
cold and lonely
inside

[chorus, repeat chorus]

cold and lonely
cold and lonely
