It happened and I want you to see
What it has done look at me right now
So dar gone that there is no turning back
Had I never fell into this
I wonder where I would be right now
But I don't know

Because I've fallen into nothing
What's your reason to be here with me
I've fallen into nothing
What's your reason to be here with me why

Handed all the cares that you had
To someone who would not give them back
But that's no excuse for where you are at
And I think you want to believe
That you are somewhere you've never been
And you feel nothing

Because you've fallen into nothing
What's your reason to be here with me
You've fallen into nothing
What's your reason to be here with me why

I believe you're lonely and need someone
To help you get through all this
If you sink too deep you'll never know that
Have you ever thought what you did
Would lead you to right where you are at
Guess you don't know

Because we've fallen into nothing
What's your reason to be here with me
We've fallen into nothing
What's your reason to be here with me why
