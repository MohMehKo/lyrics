Something I need you won't let me have
Don't shut me out you don't know me yet
Are you finding it hard to keep the peace between us
There's always something that you want to say to me

You don't listen... you don't understand
In your mind you know...

Everything but you don't
Everytime that you don't listen
How does it feel to be right all the time
How does it feel now you can't control me

You never let me finish what i'm saying
And you can't handle it when I'm right
Don't know when or if ever you will even hear me out
There's always something that you have to say to me

You don't listen... you don't undetrstand
In your mind you know...

Everything but you don't

Everytime that you don't listen
How does it feel to be right all the time
How does it feel now you can't control me

Don't try to tell me what's right or wrong
You don't know everything, it's just your opinion
No one likes a control freak cause they always think
They have all of the answers

You don't listen... you don't understand
In your mind you know

Everything but you don't
Everytime that you don't listen
How does it feel to be right all the time
All of the time, all of the time, you think you know...
Everything but you don't
Evertime that you don't listen
How does it feel, to be right all the time
How does it feel now you can't control me
