You have a fear of living not me
I will not take anything for granted
Not even the breath I breathe
Make me feel alive... still I can't describe
What is happening, determind to tun but...

I'm crawling... I'm crawling down

You cannot define this
There is nothing else like it

The addiction's here make no mistake
I will not take anything for granted
With every step I take, makes me feel alive
Still I feel the further I go I'm determined to run but...

I'm crawling... I'm crawling down

You cannot define this
There is nothing else like it, no no
You cannot define this
There is nothing else like it

It's how you react, no it's not what you say
You're running from nothing you're running away

You cannot define this
There is nothing else like it, no no
You cannot define this
THere is nothing else like it

Cannot define this...
