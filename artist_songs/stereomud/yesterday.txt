I cannot believe we did it
WHen everybody thought we couldn't
Did anything it took admit it
Looking back we won't forget
Everything we've seen
And everything we've been... how did this begin
Someone said to me... how's it going to be... if it ever ends

I don't know... will it end... i don't know when...

We'll never forget what we did yesterday
I don't foresee it
Faced it all did our best we learned from yesterday
A lesson

There's such a long way that we came
Still got a long way we're going
We're never going to be the same
We carry no regret
Did everything we could
With everything we had... since we first began
Someone said to me... how's it going to be... if it ever ends

I don't know... will it end... I don't know when...

We'll never forget what we did yesterday
I don't foresee it
Faced it all did our best we learned from yesterday
A lesson

We'll never forget what we did
No we'll never forget what we did
We'll never forget what we did
Yesterday
