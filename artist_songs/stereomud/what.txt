within this hour he'll be higher
maybe more than he has ever been
won't be his last time
he lights the fire to pretend
this is something that will never end
too tired to wait for tomorrow

[chorus:]
what
takes him away
gives him breath to say
what
not a thing
just a lesson for another day

he hides in shadows from his silence
in the dark he fools himself again
won't be his last time
he faces nothing
that's his comfort in a place
that he has always been
when he comes down he can't remember

[chorus]

say when
say when
say when
[repeat]

time
he wants some
time
he needs some
time

[chorus]
