Synthetic pathetic the words you tell me
You try to trick me
Hypotonic demonic and always scheming
Won't let me be
Erratic fanatic you move too quickly
You can confuse me
Heretic genetic a new condition
Your twisted mind drops down

What you think
You don't know me
What you think
You don't know me

Never want to do anything but bring me down
You just bring me down you bring out my hatred
Never want to do nothing but bring me down
You just bring me down you bring out my hatred

The logic methodic you're never changing that's how you think
Sadistic statistic what's the matter don't you like the pain
Frantic you panic there's no escaping cause you ran too late
Realistic horrific you can't stop me you see me coming drop down

What you think
You don't know me
What you think
You don't know me

Never want to do nothing but bring me down
You just bring me down you bring out my hatred
Never want to do nothing but bring me down
You just bring me down you bring out my hatred

Can't justify the pain you put me through [4 times]

you make me bleed from the back stabbing
You make me hate with your attitude
Lied from the start you told me everything but the truth

Never want to do nothing but bring me down
You just bring me down you bring out my hatred
Never want to do noting but bring me down
You just bring me down you bring out my hatred

You make me bleed from the back stabbing
You make me hate with your attitude
Lied from the start you told me everything but the truth
