What you say sounds familiar
I've been waiting for someone like you
Let me ask you one to another
Do you believe that there is something out there

Does it test your life
Your patience your pride
Will you lose your mind or will you make it

Can you tell me what it is that I'm searching for
Searching

What you're saying sounds familiar
I've been waiting for someone like you
Let me ask you one to another
Do you believe that there is something out there

Does it test your life
Your patience your pride
WIll you lose your mind or will you make it

Can you tell me what it is that Im searching for
Maybe why I've been looking all my life
Can you tell me what it is that I'm searching for
Maybe I can find the reason why

As I wonder I discover
An emptiness that I can't fill until I find it
I'm getting close it's becoming clearer
But when I find it it will I know that it's the answer

Does it test your life
Your patience your pride
Will you lose your mind or will you make it

Can you tell me what it is that I'm earching for
Maybe why I've been looking all my life
Can you tell me what it is that I'm searching for
Maybe I can find the reason why

I feel like I'm searching
Don't know what I'll find
I feel like I'm searching
Don't know what I'll find

Can you tell me what it is that I'm searching for
Maybe why I've been looking all my life
Can you tell me what it is that I'm searching for
Maybe I can find the reason why

Still searching
