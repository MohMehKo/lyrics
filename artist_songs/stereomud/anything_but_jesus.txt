I'm not your savior I'm as simple as a lost sheep
But you think I know everything
I'm just like you I'm trying to figure out this bullshit
So why ya looking up to me
I... don't want to hear
Don't want to hear the questions
I got no answers anyway
Say... see I don't know
See I don't know what you want
I never said I knew everything

I don't want to be I don't want to be jesus in your lost head
I don't want to be I don't want to be jesus your jesus I said
Anything, anything but jesus in your lost head
I don't want to be I don't want to be jesus your jesus I said

There's no mistakes there's only lessons I believe that
You've got to find out your own way
So don't you make me into someone that I can't be
That will never appeal to me
I... don't want to hear
Don't want to hear the questions
I got no answers anyway
Say... see I don't know
See I don't know what you want
I never said I knew everything

I don't want to be I don't want to be jesus in your lost head
I don't want to be I don't want to be jesus your jesus I said
Anything, anything but jesus in your lost head
I don't want to be I don't want to be jesus your jesus I said

Strike down on me when I don't have the answers
Don't strike out at me look for the answers

I don't want to be I don't want to be jesus in your lost head
I don't want to be I don't want to be jesus your jesus I said
Anything, anything but jesus in your lost head
I don't want to be I don't want to be jesus your jesus I said

I'm not your savior see I can't help you so why ya looking up to me!
