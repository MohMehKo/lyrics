was something missing
the walls were closing in and
i tried to face them
i tried to face my fears

[pre-chorus:]
it didn't matter to me
one more morning's missing

[chorus:]
cause I thought I'd never see it
i thought I'd never see sunlight
because I thought I'd never see it
i thought I'd never see sunlight

as shadows close in
the sound of silence screaming
invisible nothing
invisible something's here

[pre-chorus]

[chorus]

i just prayed for light
sunlight
sunlight

it didn't matter to me

[chorus]

i said I thought I'd never see it
sunlight (four times)
i thought I'd never see it
i thought I'd never see sunlight
