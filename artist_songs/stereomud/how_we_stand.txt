how long has it been?
it's good to see everything turned out
how we wanted it
how about the friends
we know that caved in
we never stopped
we never rested

[chorus:]
see me here
cause I'm still standing
see you there
i watch you
watch you stand
[repeat]

we face the turbulence
up or down
here's the cards we're dealing with
how come our friends could never read them?
you and I have never rested

[chorus]

we'll sleep when we die
we'll sleep when we die
