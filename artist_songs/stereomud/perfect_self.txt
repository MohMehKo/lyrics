settle down you all
can't you hear the footsteps
down the hall?
you're waiting for the scream
of your conscience call
and everyone starts dying

what the fuck is wrong
i said that I would always
find my way back home
now everyone I love
has been left alone
and everyone starts dying

it's you and I
begging for life
it's you and I

[chorus:]
seems like in death
we all become our perfect self
last chance to pray
and rid our self of the pain
[repeat]

help comes when I don't even want it
do you really believe that I need it?
seems like in death
i'm alive
[repeat]

[chorus]

are we closer now?

[chorus two times]

seems like in death
i'm alive
help comes when I don't even want it
seems like in death
do you really believe?
