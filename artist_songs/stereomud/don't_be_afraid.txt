you don't like them stepping on you
you don't like they make fun of your name
you don't like they tell you what to do
when you just try to fit in
and they're all laughing
you're left there standing
don't know what to do

[pre-chorus:]
when you feel hurt and afraid
don't show it bothers you
don't give yourself away
eyes keep closing
and your mind's exploding
and your anger's growing

[chorus:]
can you stand up for yourself
don't be afraid
watch out for yourself
don't be afraid
close up your fist
you are not afraid

don't know how it began
don't know who said it
don't know who you can trust
are they lying?
it's hard when you pretend
that they're not pointing
their fingers feel like someone's pushing you

when you feel better afraid

[pre-chorus]

[chorus, repeat chorus]

don't be afraid
don't be afraid
don't run, run, run
feel your eyes keep closing

[pre-chorus]

[chorus, repeat chorus]

don't be afraid
