When the silence embraced you did I
Leave you all alone to cry
When it happens at all the same time
It never seems right

When it's you against everything you can't imagine
It's me that runs to you so I can listen... listen... listen

It's automatic you bring your walls up
In spite I'm shut out I try
But you can't open to find
That it's never alright

When it's you against everything you can't imagine
It's me that runs to you so I can listen... listen... listen

I'm tired of breathing for you
So tired of breathing for you
I'm tired of breathing for you

It's a shame that you never think twice
If you only would realize... what you're doing

When it's you against everything you can't imagine
It's me that runs to you so I can listen... listen... listen

[Chorus]
How did I get to be so lucky
When all of the things did mean nothing
Everytime you needed someone I carried you all the way

When it's you against everything you can't imagine
It's me that runs to you so I can listen... listen... listen

[Chorus repeats twice]
