I looked into her face again
The penny dropped and I stuck out my can
She was holding her ballerina case
I was stuck in the back of the place
I turned around and she laughed in my face
She took me up to her higher wall
She took me up there just to let me fall and I'll sing you

Another love song
Another love song

I looked into her face once more
Sit you back so I can tell you a little story
You look better from behind
You look better from behind
You look better from outside
She took me up into her flying clay
She took me up there just to blow away and I'll sing you

Another love song
Another love song

I begged her, begged her, begged her please
You skinny fatcher I could take your little stamen
I only asked you for the time
I only asked you for the time
I only asked you for a sign
She took me up into the bell I go
She took me up there just to let it blow and I'll sing you

Another love song
Another love song
Another love song
