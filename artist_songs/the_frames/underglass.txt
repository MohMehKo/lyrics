Your will it drifts forever in the open air
my head, it looks forever but theres no one there
don't say, you'll wait forever then you disappear
I'll stay, I'll stay forever if you want me here

Cause I'm always thinking about it

How can I accept your disappointment man
it's not exact, it's no science man
I want it less than you ever have
I will not accept your disappointment man.

Damn straight, cause there's always someone who'll compare
I'd wait, I'd wait forever if you want me here
but I'm always wrong about it

I will not accept your disappointment man
it's not exact, it's no science man
I wanted less than you ever have
how can I accept your disappointment man.
