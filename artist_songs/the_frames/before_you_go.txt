You ain't got far to go
Come down for the fiesta
Come on fiesta, love me long

She's incognito
She lives in the parade by the sea, near the sand
And I wish she'd come take my hand
And we'll blow

Baby there's one thing you should know
Before you go
Baby there is one thing you should know
I can't stop loving you
I can't stop loving you
I can't stop loving you

I'm saved now, I'm saved by your hand
And all the logic and language and loss
I'd throw it all away for the dancer
She's running upstairs now and she's made till the end

But you see she's incognito
I've seen a lot of dares and they come and they
Stay and they go
Ah but, no, no, no she said no, she said
Turn on your record player

And baby there's one thing you should know
Before you go
Baby there is one thing you should know
I can't stop loving you
I can't stop loving you
I can't stop loving you

But how far will it go
And baby there's one thing you should know
Before you go
Baby there is one thing you should know
Before you go
Baby there is one thing you should know
I can't stop loving you
I can't stop loving you
I can't stop loving you
