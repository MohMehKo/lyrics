Leaving, but never far enough
Like a ship caught in the bay
We'll show each other where it hurts
And well make the fuckers pay
And what is it we don't do well enough
That were constantly afraid.
And clearing up the pieces when your gone
But the silence always stays

The silences and formlessness is gone
With the hand that rocked the babe
Well forgive each other what is done
There's no one we could blame
And neither side is sure enough to move
There's something in the way
And still for all the wisdom that we've got
We're suffering the same

Buried in the work what never ends
And silently we fade..
And we walk on.. on..
