I was thinking about your face
Rolling up the river
I was worried what you thought
And I'm sorry if I can't remember
But there's no time for crying
Only time for trying now
I remember your name
'Cause you sang it to me often
I was lying down beside
The river where we met
And now you face is hiding something
Something is burning
And I'm gonna wait for you
I've got to send this tape to you
And I'm gonna wait for you
'Cause I know something about you
Something about the things you do
Something about your voice
That reams in the good stars
It reams in the good stars
There's a road that follows everywhere you go
I stole your golden chaser
But I never meant to steal
Its not in my nature
But if you try again I'll fall
And if you want to save it all
Then all you have to do is give
Give me that look again
Give me that look
'Cause I'm gonna wait for you
I've got to send this tape to you
And I'm gonna wait for you
