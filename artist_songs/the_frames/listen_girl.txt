Listen girl I might
If you ask me very nice
I just might tell you the truth
Because you give me love and I like it
And charming as you might be
Listen girl you like it to

All of the corner kids
They're looking for joy
Dreaming of playgrounds and toys
Well they're dreaming no more
'Cause they've been there before
And now they just sit and absorb

Like when I couldn't get out of bed
Oh I could hardly walk
But I come here to muse
I come here to talk

To say listen girl ...

And the fluids
That hold me in my mind
A candle in the way
To falling back in time
And beer
The wilful little tout
That brightens up my nights
But hoodoo when I'm awake
