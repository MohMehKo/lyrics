There's a black tinted sunset
In the prettiest of skies
Lay back, lay back
Rest your head on my thighs
There is some awful action
That just breeds from my hand
It's a breathe from the deep
So exquisitely grand

And you were always on my mind
And you were always on my mind
And you were always on my mind
And you were always on my mind

Well I would not have moved
If I knew you were here
It's some special action
With motives unclear
Now you'll haunt me, you'll haunt me
'Til I pay for what I've done
It's a payment which precludes
The having of fun

And you were always on my mind
And you were always on my mind
And you were always on my mind
And you were always on my mind
And oh I got a new partner riding with me
I got a new partner now

Well the sun's fading faster
And we're ready to go
There's a skirt in the bedroom
Lying pleasantly low
And the loons on the moor
Or the fish on the flow
Well my friends, my friends
Still will whisper hello
We all know what we know
It's a hearts one to know
When you think like a hermit
You forget what you know

And you were always on my mind
And you were always on my mind
And you were always on my mind
And you were always on my mind
And oh I got a new partner riding me
I got a new partner riding with me
I got a new partner riding with me
I got a new partner now

And you were always on my mind
And you were always on my mind
And you were always on my mind
And you were always on my mind
