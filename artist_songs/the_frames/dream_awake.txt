There's a point to all this dreaming
To every man his just desserts
And every time I caught you leaving
I had to dream awake
I had to dream awake

For every time I came home screaming
And got sent away, with no warning at all
I had to dream awake
I had to dream awake

There's a calling, a calling, a calling
To everyone, who lost something
Who had to dream awake
Who had to dream awake
To take us under now
Take us under now

There's a fight were not conceding
Where words get mixed
And the point is lost
Where we have to dream awake
We had to dream awake
To take us under now
Take us under now

There's a warning, a warning, a warning
To everyone, who took something
