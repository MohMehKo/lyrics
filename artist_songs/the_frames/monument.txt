I built a monument to every word that's passed between us
I built a monument to stand through history
And I'll watch the hourglass the time will pass
And you'll rue the day love you ever strayed so far from me

I built a monument to make the time more easy passing
I built a monument to stand up straight and free
When all's been said and done the time will come
And it might be soon love, you'll see it more romantically

I built a monument to all we were
I built a monument to me and her
And now she's coming back
The roof is cracked and the walls are falling
As all those bitter words will flow back to the sea

I'll watch the hourglass the time will pass
And you'll rue the day love you ever strayed so far from me

I built a monument to all we were
I built a monument to me and her
