You're telling me I should forget you
But why?
And you're talking like I never knew you
But thats a lie

And you're playing out your game again
Why are you never on my side?
And you're telling me I should forget you

Come on the guy's a fake
What do you love him for?
And it was my mistake
Just kicking in his door
And if it's just a game
Then what are we crying for?

And you're telling me I will regret you
But so
And you're talking like I should expect to
But you'll never know

And he's left you in the rain again
And you were always on my mind
And you're telling me I should forget you

Come on the guys a fake
What do you love him for?
And it was my mistake
Just kicking in his door
And if it's just a game
Then what are we crying for?

I don't know anymore

Come on the guys a fake
What do you love him for?
And it was my mistake
Just kicking in his door
And if it's just a game
Then what are we crying for?

And you're telling me I should forget you
