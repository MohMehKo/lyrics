When you look and find
You('ve) lost your place
To the girl behind
With the honest face

Ain't that the way..

And your heroes
They pass by on broken feet
With the girls they find
Between the roof and street
On a thin escape

And I can't explain where the blood goes
And I can't explain cause I don't know
It finds a way

And the wise, they talk of honesty
While the boats, they keep pointing
Always set for sea
And a fool's escape

And there's a note, I found
Reminding me, not to wait
That you'd come and look for me
And not to wait

And I can't explain where the love goes
And I can't explain cause I don't know
It finds a way

Ohhhh, ooooh, ooooh
