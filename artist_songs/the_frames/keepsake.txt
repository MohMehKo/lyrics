Maybe its all we cant take
keeps us always returning
I'm keeping this as a keepsake
and everything else I'm burning

and maybe its cause you cant wait
keeps you always regretting
I'm keeping this as a keepsake
and everything else forgetting

when were down, down, down,
all the way
can we run away.

and maybe it cause I cant say
keeps you always believing

and maybe its cause you cant say
keeps me always believing
ill give you this as a keepsake
and right after that I'm leaving

and maybe its all we cant take
keeps us always returning
ill give you this as a keepsake
and everything else I'm burning..

I cant sleep..

they're hunting me down like an insect
chasing me down like an insect
crushing me down like an insect
stamping me out like an insect
running me down like an insect
