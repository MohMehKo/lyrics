I run my hands along the rail
Like I'm banging on a dead nail
I pull your mask around your face
And pack your castle in a big case
You're not a sage
But you know you're always on a big stage

I'm gonna live forever
I'm gonna live forever
I'm gonna live forever
I'm gonna live forever

He was just a guy with his plan
Pitchin' rubbers with his rain-tan
I took a date from the two day dance
I kissed my girl in pretty blue pants
Got to shake your hand
You know I've always been a big fan

I'm gonna live forever
I'm gonna live forever
I'm gonna live forever
I'm gonna live forever

On holiday when she was away, I was always
Never gonna, ever gonna
I'm gonna live forever
I'm gonna live forever
I'm gonna live forever
I'm gonna live forever

Stop right there, I got a dare
You pull your plan and dig your heal
Spin your castle on a bent wheel
Pull your mask around your face
And throw your hands into a big space
I'm not just gonna stand like I'm
Waiting for the big hand
I'm gonna live forever!
