I could've loved you girl like a planet
I could've chained your heart to a star
But it really doesn't matter at all
No, it really doesn't matter at all
Life's a gas

I could've built a house on the ocean
I could've placed our love in the stars
But it really doesn't matter at all
No, it really doesn't matter at all
Life's a gas

But it really doesn't matter at all
No, it really doesn't matter at all
Life's a gas

I could've turned you into a priestess
I could've burned your fates in the sand
But it really doesn't matter at all
No, it really doesn't matter at all
Life's a gas

But it really doesn't matter at all
No, it really doesn't matter at all
Life's a gas

I hope it's gonna last
