Even if you have a friend
And you give her half your life
Don't think you can't blow the whole thing down
And I could say it is my place
To speak of you so openly
Cause you never hid your hand from anyone

And we're in this boat together babe
And we said it when we pushed away the shore now
And we're in this boat together babe
And you'll bare your soul to anyone

And if i had a wish
I'd give it straight to you now
Cause you look so unsure of when you're coming down
And if you're coming down

And we're in this boat together babe
And we said it when we pushed away the shore now
And we're in this boat together babe
And we're left without a leg to stand

And we're in this mess together babe
And we said it when we pushed away the shore now
And we're in this mess together babe
And only the truth can get us back up on the shore
