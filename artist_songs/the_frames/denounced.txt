Are you feeling so abandoned 
Have your crutches all been stolen and broken 
Now sometimes you've got to fall 
Just to remember how far from the bottom you are 

Have I got your full attention 
Cause these words don't come so easy now 
We know what's gonna happen 
This is getting us nowhere 
And we've been there 

I did denounce this 
And here I am with you 
Before we lose the rest 
Lets go with what we've left 

Are you holding it together 
Are you facing all the hardest and roughest parts 
The sign we passed along the way 
Said you've come this far 
Now you're on your own 
And I'm stopping here 

I did denounce this 
And here I am with you 
Before we lose the rest 
Lets go with what we've left 

I did denounce this 
And so did you 
Before we lose it all 
Let's try to call it off 
I did denounce this
