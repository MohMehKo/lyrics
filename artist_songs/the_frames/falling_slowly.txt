I don't know you but I want you
All the more for that
And words fall through me
And always fool me
And I can't react

And games that never amount
To more than they're meant
Will play themselves out

Take this sinking boat
And point it home
We've still got time,
Raise your hopeful voice
You have a choice,
You've made it now

Falling slowly, eyes that know me
And I can't go back
And moods that take me and erase me
And I'll paint it black

Well you have suffered enough
And warred with yourself
It's time that you won

Take this sinking boat
And point it home
We've still got time,
Raise your hopeful voice
You had the choice,
You've made it now

Take this sinking boat
And point it home
We've still got time,
Raise your hopeful voice
You have a choice,
You've made it now

Falling slowly, sing your melody
I'll sing it loud

Loud
