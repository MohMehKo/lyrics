The books that you gave me, they had no pages
No picture book stories to put inside my song
And the heroes you made me, they had no faces
No chisel jaw features to carve my own on

And there's a right road
And there's a wrong wrong road

So I dropped your book you held so high
For to question is believe
And I know you said you needed time
But I never thought you had the balls to leave

And there's a right road
And there's a wrong wrong road
I see your card come tumble down
And I know your future now
I see your card come tumble down
I watch the wheel go spinning round
I see your card come tumble down
And I know your future now
I watch the wheel go spinning round
And I watch your future going down

And there's a right road
And there's a wrong wrong road

I was a featureless face till you came along
Now I'm carved by your diamond, won by your song
And I feel that it's right
But I know that it's wrong
And all the love and care and respect
I had for you is long gone

Right road
Wrong road
Wrong road
