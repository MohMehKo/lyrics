If you come, come alone
Please don't take anyone else
'Cause we're never alone
And tonight I want you for myself
Take it back, take it back
Those words that you never can help

And the side you'll never get to see
Is the part I keep from everyone
And the side you'll never get to reach
Is a lie, is a lie

Will you dance, monkey dance
Don't have me repeating myself
'Cause you came here by chance
And I'll knock you right down again

And the side you'll never get to see
Is the part I keep from everyone
And the side you'll never get to reach
Is alive, is alive

And the side you'll never get to see
Is the part I keep from everyone
And the side you'll never get to reach
Is alive, comes alive
