Out of the darkness and into the cold 
trying to take something 
that's good for the soul 
watching the chances scatter and fall 
and spinning the wheel 
cause you've lost control 
and we can dance, dance the poison 
right out of your soul 
and we can dance, dance the devil 
back into his hole 
sitting with people 
who are draining your strength 
always trying to find somewhere 
that nobody's been 
and living your life with one good intent 
and we can dance, dance the poison 
right out of your soul 
and we can dance, dance the devil 
back into his hole 
there is no life I know 
that compare to pure imagination
