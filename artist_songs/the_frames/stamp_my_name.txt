A girl by the water, the day's lovely daughter
Come to a [?], queen of the harbour
Give me your hand and say that you will
Empty your suitcase out in the bay

A girl on the steps in the black velvet dress
You touched my shoulder and you left with the rest
And my eyes they followed you 'round the bend
And I stood here hoping you'd turn around again

And I stamp my name on you, yeah
There was nothing better to do

Our lady of laughter, sister of Jesus
Look at my face now, I can hardly believe this
There's some people might think me absurd
Absurd, absurd, oh what a wonderful word, oh yeah

Now I stamp my name on you, yeah
It's all I want to do, all I want to do yeah
