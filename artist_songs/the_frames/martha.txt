Hey Martha why are you crying?
Is it for the same reason you were crying yesterday?
Don't you know a bad situation when you see one?
Get out, just leave baby, go today
Well I'm just waiting for you to open me up
Just hoping you'll drink from my broken cup
I'm just a lonely boy who knows
Nothing else but you, my Martha

Hey Martha what are you saying?
You say you got to figure it all out for yourself
Well time won't wait, and you're not special
Don't you think it's time you took me down off your shelf
I won't claim to be the saviour of your soul, no
I wouldn't want that kind of thing at all
I'm just a lonely boy who knows
Nothing else but you, my Martha

Hey my my my Martha
Hey my my my Martha

Hey Martha the boat is leaving
Pretty soon they are going to be
Calling the last of us on
Please don't please don't make me leave without you
Don't make this a very sad and unhappy song
You know I tried to say well it doesn't matter
I tried to throw away everything I thought was true
I'm just a lonely boy who knows
Nothing else but you my Martha

Hey my my my Martha
Hey my my my Martha
Hey my my my Martha
