Who knows what the day brings?
When the girl on the palace steps sings
I'm sorry the breakdown was mine
I missed all the signs, I can't read your mind
And before you go run off again
And cry to your friends
Would you look through the frost, and see
Here behind my cold eyes, my heart it is wore
My eyelids are sore

And you were wrong
And you were wrong

And so when my song it was sung
I went to the grass, and I sat in the sun
To bask underneath my own dredge
Do I follow my heart, do I have far to go
And I'd lie 'neath the shade of our bones
With the heart of a star,
'Cause I live on my own stone

And you were wrong
And you were wrong

Who knows what the day brings?
When the girl on the palace steps sings

You were wrong
You were wrong
You were wrong
