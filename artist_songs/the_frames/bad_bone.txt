There's a bad bone inside of me
All my troubles started there
And all the cracks are adding up to be
A little more than you can bare

When I met you, you were bitter still
From a scar you're never gonna show
And I was cursed with a jealousy
That's killed every love I've ever known

And when the anger that you feel
Turns to poison in your soul
And then the scars you only feel
Will start to show

You were naked on the balcony
And I was waiting in your bed
You said I pleased you only partially
But I knew my hunger would be fed

All my thoughts of going clear
And getting out before my time
Have died with you upon the vine
Have died with you upon the vine
To die with you upon the vine
To die with you upon the vine
To die

So if you'll lead the way

There's a bad bone inside of me
