Down on my check
eat on my bet
Cool and the gang play on the radio

Back on the block
Picking the locks
And I'm hitching a ride out of this no good town

Late on my rent
And my money's all spent
And I'm running away where no one can find me

And I wonder what they'll say now
If we get lucky, babe
And I'd wonder what they'll say now
If we went all the way

Playing the cards and slipping too far
And I'm lying awake
And what have I got to show for it all?

I'm late on my rent
My money is all spent
I'm hitching a ride out of this no good town

And I wonder what they'll say now
If we get lucky babe
And I wonder what they'll say now
If we go all the way
