Let go of the wheel
And forget how to steer
It's all downhill from here
Forget all the words that you heard
And shuffle them till they're unclear
It's all downhill from here

And if I held the key to all time
Then all of your time would be mine

Pick up something to throw
And see how far it'll go
And forget all you know
We'll throw our thoughts over the pier
And send them all into the mire
And wait there, until they all disappear

And if I held the secret to faith
Then all of your faith would be mine

So let go of the wheel
And forget how to steer
It's all downhill from here

And when you're flying past 
In your carriage of glass
Will you get time to ask
Or will it all be too fast
And when you're getting cold in your
In your carriage of gold
Will you hear all I told
Or be too precious to hold

And if I held the door to all love
Then all of your love would be mine
And if I held the whole world in my hands
Then all of your world would be mine
So let go of the wheel
And forget how to steer
It's all downhill from here
It's all downhill from here
It's all downhill from here
