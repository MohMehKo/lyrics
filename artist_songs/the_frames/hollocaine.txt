It's like they always say
The truth is coming out
Driving us away
Your headlights heading south
You turn your head to leave
'Cause there's nothing here for you anymore
But I am not afraid to stay
Got no need for the bible
It's all in here
It's all in here

And all I need for my survival
Is what you say
Is what you say
I told you once, twice
Somewhere in the tunnel
There's a light that shines for me
To brighten up the darkest place
And watch as the world goes
Burning to the ground
Turn back she said
"I just want to go over there and check it out"
I've got no need for the bible
It's all in here
It's all in here

And all I need for my survival
Is hollocaine
Is hollocaine
