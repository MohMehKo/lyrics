Come back, show your face
Can't you see
You're too good for this place
Can we leave?
It's not your fault, what they say
Don't believe

Or would you rather suffer in silence?
And defeat
Or would you rather suffer in silence?
Needlessly

Ah come on, show the way
I'll believe
Welcome back, you've been away
How's it been?

Or would you rather suffer in silence?
Needlessly
Or would you rather suffer in silence?
And defeat

You don't have to suffer in silence
And defeat
You don't have to suffer in silence
Needlessly
You don't have to suffer in silence
And defeat
You don't have to suffer in silence
Needlessly

Wake up
It's your love calling

You don't have to suffer in silence
And defeat
You don't have to suffer in silence
Needlessly
