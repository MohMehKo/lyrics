Looking through the valley floor
I saw a changing man
And all the places they were
And as I walk beside you now
I feel there is no more we can say
But I'd never do nothing to hurt you love

And if we look back now
And see how far your tiny ship has come
And if we look back know
We see how willingly some bridges burn

You know I think its a shame
You don't talk at all
Maybe you just don't hear me call
But I've been doing very well
I play those games no more
I'm just getting on
But I'd always come running to catch you

And if we look back now
And see how easily these tables turn
And if we look back know
We see how willingly some bridges burn

And if we look back now
Maybe we can forgive ourselves for all we've done
For all we've done
And if we look back now
And see how far your time of rest has come
And if we look back now
We see how willingly these bridges burn

Bridges burn
