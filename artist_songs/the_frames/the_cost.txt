Love has been the cause
Of all this suffering
And what has been our loss
Has been it's gaining
So lay your burdens down
And stop your crying

Will we let it burn
Burn us down, burn us

Low have been the odds
Of our reuniting
And where now can we turn
When we've got nothing

Will we let it burn
Burn us down, burn us
And maybe it'll turn
Us around
