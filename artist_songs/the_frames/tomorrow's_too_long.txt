Cover yourself from the storm
Cause forever has just come and gone
And tonight the wind blows in cold
And we don’t know what tomorrow will hold
And the waiting is keeping you strong
But tomorrow is too long

Gather yourself for the ride
And whatever you can’t carry you should leave behind
And the lights are fading on the shore
And tomorrow is so far to go
Tomorrow is so far to go
