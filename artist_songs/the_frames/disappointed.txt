The future takes us where it leads
Our heads just go beneath the waves
Time tells all and we obey
But how can I be mad at you
You did what you did
And you followed through
You were the one who always said
'Forget it and move on'

But I'm not sad, I'm just disappointed
And I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed

Well the years they get on top of you
The working load it tallied up
And you went down
Beneath it all like anybody would 
And I'm just ambling on in this town
I can't get out and it drags me down
And these words don't really fit what I'm feeling now

But I'm not sad, I'm just disappointed
And I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed

And you're not lost, you're just misdirected
And we're not going, oh nowhere
