She was in a class of 44 beautiful dancers
And I watched her pirouette around the stars
In her poms
And I must have told her one thousand times
In my mind, that I loved her
I got drunk one night, she was on the steps
She touched my shoulder
oh oh oh oh

I was young and full of grace
When I stepped into the fire, with my dancer
She had barely come of age
But she was egging me on, all the way down
And I told her as the ship sank
That I loved her
And I told her as we walked off of the plank
I was all hers
Oh oh oh oh

Step 2, 3, 4, jump 2, 3, 4
Step 2, 3, 4, jump 2, 3, 4
Step 2, 3, 4, jump 2, 3, 4
Step 2, 3, 4, and jump
That's good
