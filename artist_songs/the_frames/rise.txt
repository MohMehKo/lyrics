Breathing in the night
There's nothing else I'm needing now
The wind is at my side
And so are you
And together we will rise

Above all these word and promises we couldn't keep
Together we will fly above it all
But sometimes we will fall
From the light
But it shines on us tonight
And together we will rise
And together we will rise

And surely it's a sign now,
That everything's in tune to some kind of higher plan
Surely it's a sign
That you were right
And there's the secret line
That we've been denied
But we're crossing it tonight
And together we will rise
And together we will rise

Sometimes we will fall
From the light
But it shines on us tonight
And together we will rise

Pass this line
That we're crossing here tonight
But together we will rise
And together we will rise
We will rise, we will rise
