There's only so much that you have
And you've got to keep it safe
You've been spreading it round the place
Now it's gotta come back this way

And you're giving it all away
You're giving it all away

And you're lying through your teeth
You said you found a song to sing
And you're riding on a wave
whatever helps you get along

And you're giving it all away
You're giving it all away
You're keeping nothing for yourself
You're just giving it all away

And there's so much that you know
And there's so much that you don't
Can you not accept its all the same?
Just accept it's all the same

And you're giving it all away
You're giving it all away
You're keeping nothing for yourself
You're just giving it all away
