It's just a lie I guess
Working every hour that heaven sends
Just making sense of this
Never any wiser for the falls
And every time we get
Far away enough to see it clear
It comes right out at you
To pull the wonder out of everything
So hold it in your hand 

And I'll just be curious to see now
How you'll make it by yourself
When your walking out ahead
Unaware of anything
And tomorrow as we're looking
Who the history books will blame
You'll be walking out ahead
Not caring anyway 

Seven times removed
From the one's who thought they had it down
But don't it go to prove
Nothing cuts you like the lies of a friend
So hold it in your hands
'Cause you can't just switch it off

And I'll just be curious to see now
How you're going to make it by yourself
When you're walking out ahead
Unaware of anything
And tomorrow as we're looking
Who the history books will blame
You'll be walking out ahead not caring anyway
It's the perfect opening line
It's the perfect opening line
It's the perfect opening line 

And I'll just be curious to see now
How you're going to make it by yourself
When there's everything to lose
And nothing left to win
And tomorrow as we're looking
Who the history books will blame
You'll be walking out ahead
Unaware of anything
And tomorrow as we're fighting
Over which way was the best
You'll be walking out ahead
Not caring anyway

It's the perfect opening line
It's the perfect opening line
