My evergreen 
You are always gonna be 
No winter winds 
Can take you far from me 
These tides of time 
Have carved a few new lines 
Oh but they've never changed my mind 

My evergreen 
Beside me you will be 
When all the world was cold and golden 
Your colours ceased to bleed 

Oh my evergreen 
You are always gonna be, gonna be 

Keep on, keep on 
Cause your season's gonna come 
When all these storms have passed and done 
This distance will be gone 
And I swear we will be one 
When this race has all been run 

And I stole to see the hail 
Falling down in through your hair 
Through your hair 

Oh my evergreen 
Oh you are always gonna be
Oh my evergreen 
Oh you are always gonna be, gonna be
