So, if you ever want something
And you call, call
Then I'll come running
To fight, and I'll be at your door
When there's nothing worth running for,

When your mind's made up
When your mind's made up
There's no point trying to change it
When your mind's made up
When your mind's made up
There's no point trying to stop it

You see, you're just like anyone
When the shit falls all you want to do is run, away
And hide all by yourself
There is no one, who is gonna run to help

When your mind's made up
When your mind's made up
There's no point trying to change it
When your mind's made up
When your mind's made up
There's no point even talking
When your mind's made up
When your mind's made up
There's no point trying to fight it

So, if you ever want something
And you call, call
Then I'll come running
