Come help me out I'm sick from the fight
From inserting a laugh where there's none
Show me where this joke got tired
Tell me you know cause I'm slow catching on..

Your trying to break me down with your tuneless song
That kept me up all night
Take me to the fair where the lifeless singers
Will let you ride up beside them sometimes

And your putting a line
Where there should be not a line
And your building divides..

Come cut me out I got caught in the wire
From believing the filtering downs
Show me where the stakes got higher
Just goes to show how slow we've become

And your putting a line
Where there should be not a line
And your building divides
And putting a line 
Why are you building divides
Is it some failing in your life
