I'm living out in the old house 
And fighting on the stairs 
And staring at the windows 
Breeze blowing through the years 

But if I don't get out of this town 
Then something is gonna break 
'Cause I gotta find my own way now 
Through this thick malaise 

Well I don't know where else I can turn now 
Makes me often wonder when are we gonna learn 

You're wearing too much make-up 
Going to the dance 
And you're looking over my way now 
But some people out there take a chance 
But your glow in this light is so becoming now 

If I don't get out of this town 
Something's gonna break 
I'm waiting to find my high/house soon 
And rummage through the age 

Sometimes it feels like we don't stand a chance 
And we go, we go with something pure in our hearts
