Well I've got my head, pressed against the pane
We're watching the rain, we live in the day
The sun splits the trees
I was down on my knees and I begged you to stay

But you lived by the sword and you died by the sword
I stood by my word, cause it's all I had
To keep me in line, to beat me in time
And keep you out of my mind

Well if you could see all that I see
Then you'd believe all that I scream
This is my last song to you

I kissed you under bridge, up on the stage
Been screaming your songs to a crowd of just one
Turn it to sieve, and I was baking the bread
You're a liar she said

Hey but if you could see all that I see
Then you believe all that I scream
This is my last song to you
This is my last song to you
Yeah, my last song to you
