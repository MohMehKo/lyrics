Hand me down the picture
Of you leaving unsaid
I know how simple it gets
But say by chance I need you
Will you always be there?

And I will lie with you neath the beeches
On the strand again

I'm learning to hand it over
To whatever Lord there be
And in the same old colours
I'll be dressed for thee
But it's not about that though is it?
It's about you and me

And I will lie with you neath the beeches
On the strand again

I hung your feet
That famous painting above my bed 
And you told me a story 
About some guy who kept his head 
He drowned neath the Southport 
Neath the pier where we stand

And I will lie with you neath the beeches
On the strand again
