There was a head on collision
At my front door today
One man died
And another man tried to stop it

There was a head on collision
At my front door today
One man died
And another man tried to stop it

I was hanging on the pole
When I saw what happened
I went to tell my ma,
But she was sleeping

I was hanging on the pole
When I saw what happened
Don't take that man away
It was not his fault

Telegraph poles are good for climbing
But don't touch the live wire
At the tip of the barrel
Telegraph poles are good for climbing
But don't touch the live wire
At the tip of the barrel

You know this means everything to me
But I'm not sure if I'll be here tomorrow

But I'm not sure if I'll be here tomorrow

But don't touch the live wire
At the tip of the barrel
