Am I making sense?  Am I making time?
Well I, I put it by
And I can't wait to try
Masquerade!
The world's a stage
A hundred faces for you to play

Well it's hard to believe
I'm spinning all this way
I'm spinning all this way 
Round and round in my head
Roll over again let your heart do the spin
And listen to nothing I have to say
What did my momma say
I was always making songs for her

Over my song, over these days gone on
You come to a special place
Where you can go in straight
Masquerade!
You send me down your massive chain
You send me down your massive chain
And you base the frame
What did my momma say
I was always making songs for her
There's a better way
