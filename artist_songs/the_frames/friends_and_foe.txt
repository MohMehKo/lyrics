Turning with the listless
And staying close behind
And the arms that once held you
Have receded
Over time

And the little love I had
For all my friends and foe
And the little lines we've drawn between us all have
Taken hold

In the early morning walking
And the pressure in the night
And the walls that held you with us
Have fallen
Out of sight

And the little love I had
For all my friends and foe
And the little lines we've drawn between us all have
Taken hold

And the little love I had 
For all the friends I know
And the little time we got to share was worth it
After all

Now we work it out in silence
And the subplot to the end
And it's falling out of favour
I've seen it
Where I am

And the little love I had
For all my friends and foe
And the little lines we've drawn between us all have
Taken hold

And the little love I had
For all the friends I know
And the little time we got to share was worth it
After all
