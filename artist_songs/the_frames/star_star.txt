Star, star, teach me how to shine, shine
Teach me so I know what's going on in your mind
'Cause I don't understand these people
Saying the hill's too steep, well
They talk and talk forever
But they just never climb

Falling down into situations
Bringing out the best in you
You're flat on your back again
And star, your every word I'm heeding
Can you help me to see?
I'm lost in the marsh

Star, star, teach me how to shine, shine
Teach me so I know what's going on in your mind
'Cause I don't understand these people
Saying the world is sleeping
They toss and turn forever
But no rest will they find

Star, teach me how to shine

Star, star, teach me how to shine, shine
Teach me so I know what's going on in your mind
