You said you kissed the foot of the saviour
Felt his confession in your sleep
Well I'll be your saviour, if you'll do me that favour
And if you want I'll bathe you
In the blood of the lamb

I love you, but you're too young to know
And even if I am thinking of you
I won't let it show

When you're like this
You could be thinking anything at all
When you're like this
I might as well be talking to the
I might as well be talking to the wall
I love you, but you're too young to know
And even if I am thinking of you
You'll never know

There's no stone, stick, bone, name, thrown
Swear to god

But you, but you, but you, but you
But you, but you, but you, but you
But you, but you, but you, but you
Amalama ah but you, amalama ama ramble on
I love you, but you're too young to know
And even if I am thinking of you
You'll never ever ever ever ever ever know
It's too late for you to go
