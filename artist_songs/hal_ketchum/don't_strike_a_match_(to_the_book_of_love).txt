There are dreams that come to me in the night
And some are precious and fine
Lately all of my dreams of you are the hurtin' kind
Lyin' beside you, I miss the heat and I feel so alone
I'm afraid if I fall asleep you'll be gone

When it's late at night and I close my eyes
I know what I'll be dreamin' of
See the flames go high, watch the ashes fly
As you strike a match to the book of love
Honey, don't strike a match to the book of love

Imagination will run so wild, I can't believe that it's true
And I don't want to imagine me without you

When it's late at night and I close my eyes
I know what I'll be dreamin' of
See the flames go high, watch the ashes fly
As you strike a match to the book of love

When it's late at night and I close my eyes
I know what I'll be dreamin' of
See the flames go high, watch the ashes fly
As you strike a match to the book of love

Honey, don't strike a match to the book of love
No honey, don't strike a match to the book of love
