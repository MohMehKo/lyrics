I stood up for you when you married
Thought you were one lucky guy
You had the world in your pocket
She had that look of love in her eye

Called me at one in the morning
To tell me what you're going through
It's not working out like you wanted
I'm not the one to be telling this to

'Cause brother when you say she's not all that you dreamed of
I say you're dreaming too much
'Cause I know she's more than some damn fool deserves
I know she's somebody's love
Yes, I know she's somebody's love

I've watched her raising your children
She was there when the going got tough
Just when she needed your loving
You strung her along on just barely enough

So brother when you say she's not all that you dreamed of
I say you're dreaming too much
'Cause I know she's more than some damn fool deserves
I know she's somebody's love

And if I had your luck this time
You'd be gone, she'd be mine
All of my friends would say
There goes that lucky guy

Brother when you say she's not all that you dreamed of
I say you're dreaming too much
'Cause I know she's more than some damn fool deserves
I know she's somebody's love

Yes, I know she's somebody's love 
Oh, I know she's somebody's love
