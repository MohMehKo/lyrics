Old habits die hard, some wounds never heal
We got what we came for, this is part of the deal
I can't forget you, I can't even try
Sometimes it seems like somebody died

Old soldiers die hard, old hearts beat slow
Old friends go easy, old lovers just go

Some fools never learn, ain't that what they say
I turned for a moment, you turned away
You had your reasons, God only knows
If it bothered you baby, it never showed

Old soldiers die hard, old hearts beat slow
Old friends go easy, old lovers just go
Old soldiers die hard, old heads hang low
Old friends go easy, old lovers just go

I keep telling myself that it's alright
But I know that later on tonight

Old soldiers cry hard, old hearts beat slow
Old friends go easy, old lovers just go
Old soldiers die hard, old heads hang low
Old friends go easy, old lovers just go
