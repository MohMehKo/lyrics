Close your eyes, you've got a long day comin'
Your mama will be callin', that old rooster will crow
Close your eyes, you've got a long day comin'
You should have been sleepin' a long time ago

There are certain things in life
That do not go the way we plan them
There are mysteries to Love
You're too young to understand them

These are not tears
Just smoke in my eyes
Smoke from the bridges
I'm burning tonight

Close your eyes, you've got a long day comin'
Your mama will be callin', that old rooster will crow
Close your eyes, you've got a long day comin'
You should have been sleepin' a long time ago

Guess it's time to say goodnight
I've sung you every song I know
Let me stand and watch you dream
One more time before I go

Tomorrow you'll wake
And you'll wonder why
There's so many miles
Between you and I

Close your eyes, you've got a long day comin'
Your mama will be callin', that old rooster will crow
Close your eyes, you've got a long day comin'
You should have been sleepin' a long time ago

Close your eyes, you've got a long day comin'
You should have been sleepin' a long time ago
