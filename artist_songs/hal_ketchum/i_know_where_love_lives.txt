Love don't hang out in a grand hotel
Got no satin sheets, got no servant's bell
Ain't in Bel Air on some big old yacht
Ain't in a beach house on Monserrat 

There's a house on the edge of town
It's a little old, it's a little run down
Full of laughter and tears and toys
Crazy things only love enjoys 

[CHORUS:]
I know where love lives
I know where love lives
She's sitting on the back step in the evening air
With sea green eyes and her chesnut hair
You keep your mansions of gold, buddy,
I don't care
Cause I know where love lives 

You keep all that your fortune brings
All your fancy words, all your precious things
No matter what all your money buys
It's in the arms of love
That true treasure lies 

[CHORUS]

I know where love lives
Keep your mansions of gold
Keep your mansions of gold
