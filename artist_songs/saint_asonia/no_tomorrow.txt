Have you ever stepped out on the ledge
Have you ever been pushed right to the edge
Have you ever stared darkness in the eyes
It's time to come clean with all those lies

We want a new beginning
We want a song we'll be singing if this world should ever stop

Spinning
Get your hands up
Don't you stop screaming
From the top of your lungs
I want to feel it
From Tennessee to Montecito
Live like there's no tomorrow

Do you ever wonder why you're here
Have you ever felt so full of fear
Soon it will all become so clear
We want a new beginning
We want to take it from the top, we want a song we'll be singing
If this world should ever stop

We want a new beginning
We want to take it from the top
We want a song we'll be singing if this world should ever stop

Spinning
Get your hands up
Don't you stop screaming
From the top of your lungs
I want to feel it
From Tennessee to Montecito
Live like there's no tomorrow

We want a new beginning
We want a song we'll be singing if this world should ever stop...
If this world should ever stop...

Spinning
Get your hands up
Don't you stop screaming
From the top of your lungs
I want to feel it
From Tennessee to Montecito
Live like there's no tomorrow
Live like there's no tomorrow
Live like there's no tomorrow
