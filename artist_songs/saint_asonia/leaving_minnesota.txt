I wanted to try so hard
But she had no interest
In seeing me or my face again
Feels like a bullet in my chest

Now I'm leaving Minnesota
Would have been nice to have seen ya
In the middle of self-realization you've lost me along the way
And now I'm leaving Minnesota
But I've got nowhere to go, yeah
In the middle of self-realization you've lost me along the way
Me along the way

I heard you cried when you spoke of me
I can't help but think it's all a lie
Like they say, if you love something
Let it free
And let it fly

So now I'm leaving Minnesota
Would have been nice to have seen ya
In the middle of self-realization you've lost me along the way
And now I'm leaving Minnesota
But I've got nowhere to go, yeah
In the middle of self-realization you've lost me along the way

Lost me along the way
Lost me along the way

Now I'm leaving Minnesota
Would have been nice to have seen ya
In the middle of self-realization you've lost me along the way
Now I'm leaving Minnesota
But I've got nowhere to go
In the middle of self-realization you've lost me along the way
You've lost me along the way
