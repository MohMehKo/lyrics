Hold onto me
Like we're the only ones that see
The sky above us falling down
And breathe in my ear
Like we're the only ones that hear
The mountains crashing down

I had wasted most of my life
Playing games that I knew I'd lose
Let me sing to you, just sit here don't move
I just wanna waste some time with you

So take my hand
I don't understand
How they kept us apart for so long
And smile so I can see
That it's really you in front of me
'Cause that's still just so hard to believe

I have wasted most of my life
Playing games that I knew I'd lose
Let me sing to you
Just sit here don't move
I just wanna waste some time with you

Forcing back the tears
Over all the years
Boarding up the door
And throwing my hope to the floor
I could not forget
Now it all makes sense
That you're here with me
And I never never want to leave

I would've wasted most of my life
Never even knowing you
Now you sing to me and I still don't believe
That you wanna waste some time with me

Let me sing to you, just sit here don't move
I just wanna waste some time with you
And now you sing to me and I still don't believe
That you wanna waste your time with me
