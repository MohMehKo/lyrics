Here I go, I need to confess this
I've been scared for so long and you have been the witness
I know you're looking for some answers
But I still lie awake at night wondering who I really am
Over and over and over again it speaks to me
There's a voice inside me, the only child that was left alone

I know that you're hurt
Your cries are so loud
One day I'll be the one to make you proud
Maybe for your sake I'll just walk away
'Cause I can't watch you drown in the flood of me

Here I sit in the dark, defenseless
I'm saying sorry in my head for the things I've done to the ones I love
I surrendered myself long ago
But there's something that's inside of me
It's too strong and takes a hold
Over and over and over again it speaks to me
There's a voice inside me, the only child that was left alone

I know that you're hurt
Your cries are so loud
One day I'll be the one to make you proud
Maybe for your sake I'll just walk away
'Cause I can't watch you drown in the flood of me

Now this page is turning
And this house is burning
Gotta get out of here today
It's always me you're blaming
I'll never be the same
And now the stains of you will never wash, never wash me away

I know that you're hurt
Your cries are so loud
One day I'll be the one to make you proud
Or maybe for your sake I'll just walk away
'Cause I can't watch you drown in the flood of me

And I know that you're hurt
Your cries are so loud
One day I'll be the one to make you proud
It's the voice in me
The voice in me
You're the voice in me
