Why am I so numb?
Why do I feel so dumb?
When it's just you and I
It's that look in your eye
How do you do this to me?
Make me feel so alive
Why did you do this to me
So I can't survive?

I feel so alone now
There's no way out now because

Without you I can see
I would be just another
Sad junkie, mindless freak
Losing sleep dying slowly
Dying slowly

I know it's not your fault
There's nothing wrong here at all
But when it's just me and you
I feel there's nothing I can do
I feel there's nothing I can say
I'm so scared of the day
When this fucked up world tries to take you away

I feel so alone now
There's no way out now because

Without you I can see
I would be just another
Sad junkie, mindless freak
Losing sleep dying slowly
Dying slowly

I've never been so loving
I've never felt so low
I wanna just be something more than dying slowly
Dying slowly
I'm dying slowly

Why am I so numb?
Why do I feel so dumb?
Why should I even try
When I can't survive

Without you I can see
I would be just another
Sad junkie, mindless freak
Losing sleep dying slowly
Dying
Dying
Dying slowly
