Get away from me
Hide your shame from me
Get away somehow
You drag me down
Denial so bad
Just wait and see
I don't owe you anything
And you don't own me!

I will not forget
Don't burden me with all of your problems.
Don't weigh me down with all of your fears.
Cutting you out of my life forever
To tear apart this pain that I feel

Everyday's the same,
Driving me insane
Just take one step back
I'm getting my life on track
Realizing now, how you break me down
I'm in such a better place
Without you around!

I will not forget
Don't burden me with all of your problems.
Don't weigh me down with all of your fears.
Cutting you out of my life forever
To tear apart this pain that I feel

The pain that I feel

The pain that I feel

Tear apart, oh
Tear apart, the pain that I feel.

I will not forget

Don't burden me with all of your problems.
Don't weigh me down with all of your fears.
Cutting you out of my life forever
To tear apart this pain that I feel

Don't burden me with all of your problems.
Don't weigh me down with all of your fears.
Cutting you out of my life forever
To tear apart this pain that I feel
