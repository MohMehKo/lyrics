Well you can tell everyone I'm a down disgrace,
drag my name all over the place.
I don't care anymore.
You can tell everybody about the state I'm in,
you won't catch me crying cause I just can't win.
I don't care anymore.
I don't care anymore.

I don't care what you say.
I don't play the same games you play.
Cause I've been talking to the people that you call your friends,
and it seems to me there's a means to an end.
They don't care anymore.
And as for me I can sit here and bide my time,
I've got nothing to lose if I speak my mind.
I don't care anymore.
I don't care anymore.

I don't care what you say.
We never played by the same rules anyway.
I won't be there anymore, so get out of my way.
Let me by.
I've got better things to do with my time.
I don't care anymore.
I don't care anymore.
I don't care anymore.
I don't care anymore.

Well I don't care about what you say,
cause everyday I'm feeling fine with myself.
And I don't care about what you say,
Hey, I'll do alright by myself, cause I know.

Cause I remember all the times I tried so hard,
and you laughed in my face cause you held the cards.
I don't care anymore.
And I really ain't about what you think I mean.
Cause all I wanted for you, was just to let me be.
I don't care anymore.
You hear I don't care anymore.

I don't care what you say.
I never did believe you much, anyway.
I won't be there no more, so get out of my way.
Let me by. I've got better things to do with my time.
I don't care anymore.
You hear, I don't care anymore.
I don't care no more.
...
No more. No more...
