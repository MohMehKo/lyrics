Sometimes I drink a little too much
I've been known to smoke, cus and fight just because
I've run out of breath doing my best to keep up with these demons
And I've let down, Momma and Jesus

Gunna run out of road
Before I run out of threat
I've found a line to cross every chance I get
If the wild runs out if I ever settle down
God knows it ain't no secret
It's all about the grace,
Of Momma and Jesus

So I'm gunna shoot this last light out
Get a little lost before I get found
I'm gunna burn this last one down
Then turn it around
For Momma and Jesus
Run out of reasons
For not giving up on me

You can go to hell
From running your lips
You crushing out love like a cigarette
That same old story, I'll change, I'm sorry
But the only ones forgive me
Are me, Momma and Jesus

So I'm gunna shoot this last light out
Get a little lost before I get found
I'm gunna burn this last one down
Then turn it around
For Momma and Jesus
Run out of reasons
For not giving up on me

Yeah I'm gunna shoot this last light out
Get a little lost before I get found
I'm gunna burn this last one down
Then turn it around
For Momma and Jesus
Run out of reasons
For not giving up on me

Not giving up on me
Yeah Momma and Jesus
