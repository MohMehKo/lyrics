I was born for the fast lane
A rambling fever in my veins
Firestones on a roll, that’s how goes
On the road again

I said to heck with the rear view
Cuz what’s already behind you
Is a damn good reason for keeping your back to the wind
That needle pinned

Ride on with your cold chrome and metal
Ride on with your knees digging in to your saddle
Like a bat out of hell
Got the world by the tail
When it feels that good to be gone
Ride on

I always act like I don’t care
When the blacktops going nowhere
Keep my head down, tough it out
Don’t think about how life ain’t fair

Ride on with your cold chrome and metal
Ride on with your knees digging in to your saddle
Like a bat out of hell
Got the world by the tail
When it feels that good to be gone
Ride on

Full speed ahead
Forget the breaks
Slam the gas
Don’t look back
And ride on
Ride on

Like a bat out of hell
Got the world by the tail
When it feels that good to be gone
Ride on
Ride on

Yeah I was born for the fast lane
Ride on
