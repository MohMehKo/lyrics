When there's still a little month at the end of the money
When your runnin' out of room
Between your back and that wall
When the tide won't turn
And your life won't learn when the heart keeps hurting
When your hope gets here with that wrecking ball

Fight like hell
Don't you back down
Answer that bell
Stand your ground
Don't you give up
When the going gets tough
Fight like hell

When you drank too big
And the town keeps talking
When the told you so's get a little too loud
When your job gets jacked, can't catch no slack and the odds keep stacking up
And your about to throw in the towel

Fight like hell
Don't you back down
Answer that bell
Stand your ground
When the going gets tough
Fight like hell

When the rain keeps fallin', fallin' on you,
The weight of the world is weighing on you
And all's you got is the end of your rope
When your heart keeps breaking, aching on you,
Haters keep hating on you
There ain't really but one way to go

Fight like hell
Don't you back down
Answer that bell
Stand your ground
Don't you give up
When the going gets tough
Fight like hell

Fight like hell
Fight like hell
Fight like hell
Fight like hell
Fight like hell
