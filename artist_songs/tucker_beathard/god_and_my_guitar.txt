Time keeps ticking and hearts get broken
Hope goes missing and doors keep closing in on you
Ain’t that the truth? Ain’t that the way it goes some times?
The rug keeps pulling out from underneath you
Ships coming in and then it starts to leave
There ain’t no silver left in them clouds
And then the sky comes crashing down
I got something to lean on when times get hard
It’s God and my guitar.

There was something about Katie that felt like forever
She made tattoos and red lipstick look good together
I guess you could say I was swept away
But she wasn’t rolling like that
I could still hear the sound of the car door slamming
The gone in the gravel
The feeling of damn it I want her back
But I guess that that’s the way it goes sometimes
So I sat there and poured out my heart
To God and my guitar.

I’ve prayed and played ‘em in the ground
But they ain’t ever let me down so far
And they’ve seen the crazy I can be
They take the best and worst of me
They’re the only ones that see beyond my scars
It’s God and my guitar.

I’ve prayed and played ‘em in the ground
But they ain’t ever let me down so far
And they’ve seen the crazy I can be
They take the best and worst of me
They’re the only ones that see beyond my scars
It’s God and my guitar.
It’s God and my guitar.

I’ve prayed and played ‘em in the ground
But they ain’t ever let me down.
