Hey its me, I'm just wondering where you are?
I woke up late, I think the game is about to start.
You know where I'll be, 
Just sitting here at home, let go Tennessee.

Its me again, you won't believe what just went down.
3rd and goal, fake reverse and around, even fooled the referees.
Just had to let you know, its 7-zip Tennessee.

By the way I meant to say, that I'm sorry about last night.
I didn't mean to make you cry. But did you really mean goodbye?
I swear to God I'm going to change, turn this fool I've been around.
I believe in miracles, cuz hell I'm watching one right now.
Girl you wont believe, its going into half, 10-nothing Tennessee.

We scored again, so I called to say it got real close,
but just like you we pulled away.
Almost out of reach, but it ain't over yet, Hold on Tennessee!

I swear to God I'm going to change, turn this fool I've been around.
I believe in miracles, cuz hell I'm watching one right now.
Girl you wont believe, 2 minutes left, its looking good Tennessee.

Should have been another best day of my life.
But girl I feel, kinda like the Crimson Tide.
With time running out on me.
No Hail Mary chance, 20-10 Tennessee.
