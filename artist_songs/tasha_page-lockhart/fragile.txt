It's just me and you
And I have some questions
Why do we hurt?
Why is everything a lesson?
What I call a test
You call a blessing
Why's it so hard to believe?
Why should I pray?
If you know the ending
I feel like I'm lost
Right from the beginning
And if I'm your child
Why is everyone else winning?
Help me to see what you see

[Chorus:]
That we are, we are limited by time and space
We are, we are homeless, come take us away
We are, weak and sometimes we may fall too far
But each time you'll catch us
Cause you know how fragile we are
Each time you'll catch us
Cause you know how fragile we are

So many things
I don't understand
Like how you allow
Pain in your plans
You tell me to trust
My life in your hands
And walk on the water with you

[Chorus:]
But we are, we are limited by time and space
We are, we are homeless, come take us away
We are weak and sometimes we may fall too far
But each time you'll catch us
Cause you know how fragile we are
Mhhmm mmmmm
Each time you'll catch us
Cause you know how fragile we are

We too weak to fight
We fall but we wanna be right
So we call you all day and all night
Oohh my only option is you

Cause you are, you are bigger and smarter than me
You are. you are working on what I shall be
I made mistakes
But you kept me from going to far
And each time you catch me
Cause you know how fragile that we
Are, we are limited by time and space
Ohhhhuuhhh
We are, we are homeless, come take us away
OOohhhh
We are weak and sometimes we may go too far
But each time you'll catch us
Cause you know how fragile we are
Ooooouhhhhuuuuu
Each time you'll catch us
Cause you know how fragile we are
Mmmmm
Each time you'll catch us
Cause you know how fragile we are
