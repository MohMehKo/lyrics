Back when I was seventeen
Like every other girl I used to have big dreams
But then I got introduced to some other things...
And suddenly the church girl I was originally
Became different
See the wrong things can call your name
I chose to answer when the Spirit said walk away
And now I live with circumstances that I can't erase
I just wish I could go back now to yesterday
'Cause it was different

But there's not a hole too deep
Naw
That God won't reach down and save me, me
See He cleaned me up and made me new
Said welcome back and now I'm standing here in front of you
Hey

I'm different
Y'all I'm not the same
Ever since I met the savior
See my life has changed
I must admit back in the day I did some crazy things
But that's my past
See my past has now passed away
Y'all I'm different
See I'm different
Y'all I'm not the same
Ever since I met King Jesus
Now my life has changed
I must admit back in the day I did some crazy things
But that's my past
See my past has now passed away
'Cause I'm different

I'm human
I'm gon' make mistakes
If and when I do please show me some grace
'Cause though it may be me who messed up today...
It may be your turn tomorrow
Then I bet you'll say
Something different
'Cause what goes around comes back around
Those you hurt on the way up
Will be there when you're down, down
I used to be the same way
But one Sunday morning something in my heart changes

I'm different
Y'all I'm not the same
Ever since I met the savior
See my life has changed
I must admit back in the day I did some crazy things
But that's my past
See my past has now passed away
Y'all I'm different
See I'm different
Y'all I'm not the same
Ever since I met King Jesus
Now my life has changed
I must admit back in the day I did some crazy things
But that's my past
See my past has now passed away
'Cause I'm different

But there's not a hole too deep
Naw
That God won't reach down and save me
See He cleaned me up and made me new
Said welcome back and now I'm standing here in front of you

You can see it
I'm different in my walk
Different
Others see it
Different
In how I talk
How I'm different
I can see it
Different
In how I pray
Different
I start to shed some tears
Different
Each word I say
See I'm different
They tell me
I'm different
Like day and night
Different
I used to go off quick
Different
I'd cuss and fight
But now I'm different
I'd blame everyone else
Different
For my mistakes
I was different
If someone got too close
Different
I'd push away
But now I'm different
But then Jesus
Different
Came in my life
Different
Saw my potential
Different
And made it right
See I'm different
Not just religion
Different
But something real
Different
It's what I know now
Different
Not what I feel
Different
You can't tell it
Different
Like I can
Different
Look at me
Different
I'm born again
Different
It wasn't easy
Different
What I've been through
Different
I'm stronger now
Different
Now I can help you
Different
You'll be different
Different
