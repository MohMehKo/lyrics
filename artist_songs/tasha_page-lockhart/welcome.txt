Every morning paints a new beginning
And each season hears its name
Every seed we know dies before it grows
Cuz everything in life must change

This carousel in time will come full circle
Even winners sometimes lose
Just be sure you know
We all reap what we sow
So be careful which road you choose

Welcome to this thing called life
It's a mystery words can't explain
So relax and hold on, the ride won't last that long
Cuz everything in life must change

All around the world we feel winds blowing
Waking to a different day
Still hunger has no cure
The rich forget the poor
It feels like wintertime in May

See everybody needs another someone
Through the turbulence of life
Cuz loneliness is loud
Turn it down somehow
Just let me know I'll be alright

Welcome to this thing called life
It's a mystery words can't explain
So relax and hold on, this ride won't last that long
Cuz everything in life must change

Welcome to reality,
The beautiful dance of joy and pain
Remember every touch
Be careful who you love
Cuz everything in life must change

Do, do doooo...
La, la la

If you listen close, you'll hear one calling
Like a whisper through the plains
On the hill you'll see a ladder and the King
who says, "Walk with me, I will never change"

Welcome to this thing called life
It's a mystery words can't explain
So relax and hold on, the ride won't last that long
Cuz everything in life must change

Welcome to reality,
The beautiful dance of joy and pain
Remember every touch
Be careful who you love
Cuz everything in life must change

Nothing ever stays the same
There's only one who'll never change
