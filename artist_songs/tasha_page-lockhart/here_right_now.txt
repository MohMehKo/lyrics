I'm not supposed to be here right now
See I was so down
I can't believe how I'm here right now
Thank God I'm here right now

Can you believe it?
Everything it happens for a reason
See there was a season
God if I'm honest, I thought you forgot my name
That is the reason
You never get caught up in what you see and
Soâ€”don't stop believing -in me and you
I know we'll make it through someday

Whatever winds blow our way
Put a smile on your face
We're too close now
Don't let me ever hear you say

I'm not supposed to be here right now
See I was so down, I can't believe how I'm here right now
Finally I'm living with no fear right now
I love what I see, it's me
You'll get no tears right now
Cuz I'm here right now

Never stop dreaming
God He gave you dreams for a reason
And every disappointment has meaning
Don't think about leaving
We're going to make it through someday

Whatever winds blow our way
Put a smile on your face
We're too close now
Don't let me ever hear you say

I'm not supposed to be here right now
See I was so down, I can't believe how I'm here right now
Finally I'm living with no fear right now
I love what I see, it's me
You'll get no tears right now
Cuz I'm here right now

After the rain, after the scars
And my mistakes
Still can't believe God knows my name
You call it luck, I call it grace

It's a new day the Lord has made
I shall rejoice and celebrate
Whatever they think
Don't care what they say
Look at us now

I'm here right now
Tried to walk away
So glad I stayed
I'm here right now

I'm not supposed to be here right now
See I was so down, I can't believe how I'm here right now
Finally I'm living with no fear right now
I love what I see, it's me
You get no tears right now
Cuz I'm here right now
