Faith is the substance of things hoped for
Evidence of things not seen
It's trust and confidence in God's words
Oh faith, come alive in me

Faith is the substance of things hoped for
Evidence of things not seen
(ooohhhhh)
It's trust and confidence in God's words
Oh faith, come alive in me

Oh faith come alive in me
Open my eyes to see
That where I am
Is not my reality
Faith come alive in me
Faith come alive in me

I can move mountains if I just believe
In your word you've given me
The power to conquer anything
Oh faith come alive in me

Oh faith come alive in me
Open my eyes to see
That where I am
Is not my reality
Faith come alive in me
Faith come alive in me

Faith come alive in me
Open my eyes to see
That where I am
Is not my reality
Faith come alive in me
Faith come alive in me

Come alive
(oohhh ooo ohhh ooo oh ahh)
Come alive
Faith come alive in me

To walk
(walk into my destiny)
To live
(to live a life that is pleasing unto you)
To become
(to become all that you have promised)
Come alive
Faith come alive in me
(to be healed)
To be healed
(from all sickness and decease)
To be free
(from the chains that were holding me)
Come alive
(come alive, come alive)
Come alive
Faith come alive in me
(come alive)
Come alive
(activate your faith, all you got to do is)
Come alive
Faith come alive in me
