This is the story of the history of night
From the beginning it has never seen the light
It takes a while to never understand
It holds the gift of darkness in it's hand

This is the story of the monkey and the snake
The monkey hit that sucker with a rake 
The snake then bit the monkey on the hand
And now the monkey's singin' in a band
