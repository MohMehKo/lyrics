Fatboy
We went down to Leroy's, double-barrel sun
Varmints always whippin' ass on Leroy
Devil-rabbit costume, gettin' on was fun
Always whinin' "Stop the war on fatboy"

Stop abusing Martians
Stop reducing calories
Clip your eggs together
Monkey one
Keep gettin' on - part of the plans that were made
Keep gettin' on - part of the plans that were made

We held up the donut just before the sun
We all argued who would service fatboy
Fatboy has the knowledge, knowledge overcome
Super hand of wonder it's the fatboy

Stop abusing Martians
Stop reducing calories
Clip your eggs together
Monkey one
Keep gettin' on - part of the plans that were made
Keep gettin' on - part of the plans that were made

Fatboy claims he's triplets, I believe each one
Always, always lying, it's the fatboy
If I claim I'm triplets it's knowledge overcome
Super hand of wonder is this fatboy

Stop abusing Martians
Stop reducing calories
Clip your eggs together
Monkey one
Keep gettin' on - part of the plans that were made
Keep gettin' on - part of the plans that were made
Keep gettin' on - fatboy's everything made
Keep gettin' on - fatboy's everything made
