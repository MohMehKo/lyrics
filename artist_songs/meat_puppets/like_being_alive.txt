Tie me up 
Get it right 
Pull the knots
Good and tight
Toss me in a car
Take us out for a ride
This is almost like being alive

I'm not here, I'm nowhere
Someplace else, I don't care
Give me half an hour
Lock the door when you arrive
This is almost like being alive

Night is here
Time stands still
All things move outside will
Lock me in the shower
Stamp the door when you arrive
This is almost like being alive
Give me half an hour
Let me know when you arrive 
This is almost like being alive
This is almost like being alive...

Oh, I'm drifting away
Just imagine being eaten by a giant doo-doo log with teeth
