The original one went off in colors
Side by side with the neighborhood doll
There's a snake in the grass the barefooted hiker
Passes by on the way to nail his card up on the wall

Been said the original one
Was all through when the game had begun
Hot damn, electric solution for everyone
And all in all when the fashion is learned
You're better off temporarily burned
Hot damn, electric solution for everyone

Half a buck will buy an original master
Just a little spare change for the old bridge troll
There's a turn in the road the bicycle rider
Passes by on the way to nail his heart up on the wall

Been said the original one
Was all through when the game had begun
Hot damn, electric solution for everyone
And all in all when the fashion is learned
You're better off temporarily burned
Hot damn, electric solution for everyone

The original one was never on TV
Went hauling off stars in the back of his truck
To a place in the woods for cleaning and cooling
Shine them up for a bit and nail those stars up on the wall

Been said the original one
Was all through when the game had begun
Hot damn, electric solution for everyone
And all in all when the fashion is learned
You're better off temporarily burned
Hot damn, electric solution for everyone

Been said the original one
Was all through when the game had begun
Hot damn, electric solution for everyone
And all in all when the fashion is learned
You're better off temporarily burned
Hot damn, electric solution for everyone
