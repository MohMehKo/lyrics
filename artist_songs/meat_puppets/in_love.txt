Sand man walks the islands
Over corals bay
Wishes balanced captive
Pushing time away
In love...
Disappearing pictures
Falling from the sky
Sandman in the shallows asking
How'd I ever get so much
In love...
In love...
Sometimes always captures
Always slips around
Love is linen shrouded
And floats like lion down
In love...
