Six straight rolls in a blind man's game
Half a dozen snake eyes all the time
Holler to an echo
Roll those hollow dice
To the other side
Another time

Got lost on the water
Wound up on the sand
Gaze out through the darkness
With the light in the palm of your hand
To the other side
Another time

I got to say this has nothing to do with the other side
I'll bet they wish they were 'round the corner on some crazy ride

Every time the walls tumble down
Build up new ones on the changing ground
Works about as well as water in your hand
The new ones are always the tallest ones around
The other side
Another time

You lay out in the water
The light in the palm of your hand
Goes moving through the water
Like the motion of a far off land
To the other side
Another time

Some wins and losses
They hear what they like
Rubbin' toes and burnin' trail
Headin' down the pike
To the other side
Another time
