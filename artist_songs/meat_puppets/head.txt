If I only can't decide
The crystal eight ball's on the table
Thanks for nothing
Here's my only prayer
Thin air

Long ago
The other night
Far, far away

As the head falls off the table
Crashes to the floor and shatters
Dust and glass are blowing everywhere
Down there

Through the wall I hear you laughing
You're so special I don't like you
You will always be my only friend
No end
