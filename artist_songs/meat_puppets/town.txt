Nowhere an hour is the speed that I fly
Greeted by vapors when I do arrive
Don't mind my story
It'll only drag you down

In a one trick town
One sick clown
Instincts on a high wire
The rain flying around
In a one trick town

The sun is a spark from the axe that I grind
The bright night of wishes, a wish to unwind
The river in winter has froze to the ground

To the one trick town
One sick clown
Instincts on a high wire
The rain flying around
In a one trick town

Nowhere an hour is the speed that I fly
Greeted by vapors when I do arrive
Don't mind the memories
They will only drag you down

In a one trick town
One sick clown
Instincts on a high wire
The rain flying around
In a one trick town

One trick town
Don't mind the memories
They will only drag you down

In a one trick town
Don't mind the memories
They will only drag you down

In a one trick town
