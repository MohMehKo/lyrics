I'm not you no matter what you do
No matter what you see I'll always be a chimpanzee
You're not me no matter what you see
The things I say and do should be of no concern to you

The time-wire is bending in spaces unending 
In lights array
In black-silver lining the blood rose is timing
Its charmed decay

I'm not you no matter what you do
No matter what you see I'll always be the other me
If frogs fell from the air I'd have to say I didn't care
I'd have to put them down and move off to some frogless ground

The time-wire is bending in spaces unending 
In lights array
In black-silver lining the blood rose is timing
Its charmed decay

I'm not you no matter what you do
No matter what you see I'll always be the other me
You're not me no matter what you do
The things I say and do should be of no concern to you

Time-wire is bending in spaces unending
In lights array
In black-silver lining the blood rose is timing
Its charmed decay

The time-wire is bending in spaces unending
In lights array
In black-silver lining the blood rose is timing
Its charmed decay
