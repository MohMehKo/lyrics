Insanity is our saving grace
Like cannonballs, exploding in space
And everyone is lying in bed
Happily, they're swallowing feathers

Amazing, just a taste of blood
I tried to slap the face of an alien
Amazing, everyone's requiring a taste of blood
I'd like to say you're amazing

Suddenly I'm feeling quite well
Lovely, the sickening smell
And everyone is lying in bed
Happily, they're swallowing feathers

Amazing, just the taste of blood
I tried to slap the face of a changeling
Amazing, everyone's requiring a taste of blood
I'd like to say you're amazing

Suddenly I'm feeling quite well
Lovely, the sickening smell
And everyone is lying in bed
Quietly, they're swallowing feathers

Amazing, just the taste of blood
I tried to slap the face of an alien
Amazing, everyone's requiring a taste of blood
I'd like to say you're amazing

Goddamn the human ape
Everyone's requiring a taste of blood

Amazing, just the taste of blood
I tried to slap the face of an alien
Amazing, everyone's requiring a taste of blood
I'd like to say you're amazing
