All these nights have made me crazy
I can't seem to come around
Days of hiding in the sunshine
Feeling nighttime's falling down
Oh, I see another moon over me
Oh, I see another moon over me
All these lies have got me thinking
Maybe this is just a thought
Soon my ship of thoughts is sinking
Slipping through the thinking knot
Oh, I see another moon over me
Oh, I see another moon over me
Pulling back the veil are monkeys
Hidden there are monkeys more
Someone spills a jar of honey
Sticky monkeys crawl the floor
Oh, I see another moon over me
Oh, I see another moon over me
Oh, I see another moon over me
Oh, I see another moon over me
