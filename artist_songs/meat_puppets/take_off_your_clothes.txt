It's alive she said
It's a dream, a lie
It's a lie she said, come alive, alive

Oh my god I must be dreaming
If this is a dream, then why am I screaming
Take off your clothes there's nothing showing
Out of the sun a cold wind's blowing
All the lights have started popping
Once it starts it's always stopping
Take off your clothes there's nothing showing
Out of the sun a cold wind's blowing

You're a dog she said, come alive, alive
Like a dog lay down on your side, your side

Oh my god I must be dreaming
If this is a dream, then why am I screaming
Take off your clothes there's nothing showing
Out of the sun a cold wind's blowing
All the lights have started popping
Once it starts it's always stopping
Take off your clothes there's nothing showing
Out of the sun a cold wind's blowing

It's a lie she said, come alive, alive
It's a dream, again, come alive, alive

Oh my god I must be dreaming
If this is a dream, then why am I screaming
Take off your clothes there's nothing showing
Out of the sun a cold wind's blowing
All the lights have started popping
Once it starts it's always stopping
Take off your clothes there's nothing showing
Out of the sun a cold wind's blowing
