Well the moon was more than we could hope for
We sure know a real good time
Green black box with whatever's inside
Nighttime creeping from behind
We'll take him up to the cottonwood
Show him a real good time
Up in the canyon away from the river
Sure that's the mountain line
Well maybe someday I'll find what I'm after
And drag it away from my mind
Maybe someday I'll find
One more mountain line

Will the blue affect him
Is the night too fine
Eyes that follow steppin' out the river
Underneath the mountain line
Well I don't throw myself in the water
The fire's burning stronger with the rain
All it took me was a little understanding
Before I learned to move with the flame
Maybe someday I'll find what I'm after
And drag it away from the mine
Maybe someday I'll find
One more mountain line
