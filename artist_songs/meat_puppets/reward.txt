We played for you and you did not dance
we wailed and you did not listen
and John came neither eating nor drinking
and you said he is possessed by a demon
the son of man came eating and drinking
and you said he is a friend of tax collectors
but what can I say about you?
You are like children in the marketplace
Shouting to your playmates
he who receives a prophet because he is a
prophet will receive the prophets reward
he who receives a righteous man because he is a
righteous man will receive a righteous man's reward
