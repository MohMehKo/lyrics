Later on when the TV's on
Later on in the empty lot
Watch the scene just fade away
And you really don't know, you really don't know

There's a place where you can go
That's what you stick your money for
You drink down till you fall apart
And you really don't know, you really don't know

What to do yeah, you know what to do, you know where to go
You're talking to the people that you don't know
There's na na, nothing that you don't know
There's na na, nothing, oh no, that you don't know

What to do, yeah, you really don't know
You really don't know what to do
What to do, yeah, you really don't know
You really don't know

Hurry people get on your train
Don't be waiting for the working day
It takes time to unfold your faith
And you really don't know, you really don't know

What to do, yeah, I really don't know
I really don't know what to do
What to do, yeah, I really don't know
I really don't know
