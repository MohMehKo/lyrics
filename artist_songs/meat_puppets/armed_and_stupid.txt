Blue showers - stars open
New pennies for heaven

And the sun wants a place in the sky
As it spins all around
And the rain thinks that it was only dreaming
As it kisses the ground

No feeling poor shooting
Find trouble so soothing

And the sun wants a place in the sky
As it spins all around
And the rain thinks that it was only dreaming
As it kisses the ground

No body - pure science
No body - no essence

And the sun wants a place in the sky
As it spins all around
And the rain thinks that it was only dreaming
As it kisses the ground

And the sun wants a place in the sky
As it spins all around
And the rain thinks that it was only dreaming
As it kisses the ground
