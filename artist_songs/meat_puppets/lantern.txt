The moon won't rise
It turns to dust in my eyes
Dust in my eyes, dust in my eyes
Dust in my eyes, dust in my eyes

In the Canyon, getting hard to see the light
Bring the lantern, setting fire to the night

The water's still dry
I can't get the mud from my eyes
Mud from my eyes, mud from my eyes
Dust in my eyes, dust in my eye

In the Canyon, getting hard to see the light
Bring a lantern, setting a fire to the night
In the Canyon, getting hard to see the light
Bring a lantern, setting fire to the night

The cold dark bites
The pair of things in my sight
Dust in my eyes, dust in my eyes
Dust in my eyes, things in my sight

In the Canyon, getting hard to see the light
Bring a lantern, setting a fire to the night
In the Canyon, getting hard to see the light
Bring a lantern, setting a fire to the night

In the Canyon, getting hard to see the light
Bring a lantern, setting a fire to the night
In the Canyon, getting hard to see the light
Bring a lantern, setting a fire to the night

In the Canyon, getting hard to see the light
Bring a lantern, setting a fire to the night
In the Canyon, getting hard to see the light
Bring a lantern, setting a fire to the night
