There's a place across the way
And it's boarded up and gray
And my friends keep going back there
And my friends say

I want time and money... no peace of mind
If I can keep from running I won't fall behind

I have seen a lot of things
And pulled a lot of strings
And the world keeps walking backwards
And my friends say

I want time and money... no peace of mind
If I can keep from running I won't fall behind

There's a place I'd like to go
Where it is I'd like to know
Then I won't keep talking backwards
And my friends say

I want time and money... no peace of mind
If I can keep from running I won't fall behind

I want time and money... no peace of mind
If I can keep from running I won't fall behind
