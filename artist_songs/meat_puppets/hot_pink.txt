Hot pink volcano in the heart of the tornado
Is shaking the lemonade tree
Hot pink forest is backed by a furnace
That boils the lemonade free
And it all went down
Tomorrow is a number
Hot pink apple with the sweet golden dimple
Has stuck its claim in me
Hot pink rubber comes in every color
And every style that you please
