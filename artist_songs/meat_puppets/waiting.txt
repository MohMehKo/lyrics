Everything's cool and everything's fine
And everything drives me out of my mind

Look at them waiting in a dream
Look at them waiting in a dream

Everything's big and everything's bright
And everything's flying around in my mind

Look at them waiting in a dream
Look at them waiting in a dream

Everything's cool and everything's fine
And everything drives me out of my mind

Look at them waiting in a dream
Look at them waiting in a dream
Look at them waiting in a dream
Look at them waiting in a dream
