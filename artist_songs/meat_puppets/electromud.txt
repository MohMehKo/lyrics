It's the only dance there is
You'll be judged when you're through
This is a dance contest
This is a marathon
Do the electromud
You've got no choice
Sensitize your body
Do the electromud
Come on don't you doubt us
We're all much too ignorant
If you've gotta go to the bathroom
Then go for christ's sake
