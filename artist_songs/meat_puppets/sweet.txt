And if they fade we might see them better
'Cause as they are we can't see them at all
It's a parade with a band and a boat full of sound
A mechanical monkey that walks on a ball

And they're passing by and the crowd is crying... rah
And they're stopping waving
To the people raving... rah

Here comes a float with a shimmering mermaid
Kisses are blown to the folks one and all
Riding a goat is a lizard in formal attire
Cracking its whip as the ticker tape falls

And the wind is crying and the cloth is flying... rah
And they're stopping waving
To the people raving... rah

And so they fade and everything's better
And I don't care if I see them at all
Back to the place where the sun never shines on their skin
Back to their place in the shadows they crawl

And they're passing by and the crowd is crying... rah
And they're stopping waving
To the people raving... rah

And the wind is crying and the cloth is flying... rah
And they're passing by
And the crowd is crying... rah
