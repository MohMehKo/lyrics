Twenty-one little pink salamanders pass me by tonight
Twenty-one little red tongues are flickering in my sight
Amphibious thoughts are flowing with the salamanders showing
Of the "touch of evil" tinted black and white
Seventeen fat ripe rats hold stacks of juniper pie aloft
Thirty-four clever rat hands are juggling tarts on high
These rodents know the craving for a slice, a sliver or shaving
No request for satisfaction is denied
Open wide, open wide
Twenty-one little pink salamanders pass me by tonight
Twenty-one little red tongues are flickering in my sight
These amphibians know the craving for a slice, a sliver or shaving
No request for satisfaction is denied
Open wide...
