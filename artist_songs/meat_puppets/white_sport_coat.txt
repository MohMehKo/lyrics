A white sport coat and a pink carnation
I'm all dressed up for the dance
A white sport coat and a pink carnation
I'm all alone in romance

Once a long long time ago
To the prom you said you'd go
Now I'm all alone, it seems
Someone else will hold my dreams

A white sport coat and a pink carnation
I'm in a blue, blue mood
A white sport coat and a pink carnation
I'm all alone in romance

Once a long long time ago
To the prom you said you'd go
Now I'm all alone, it seems
Someone else will hold my dreams

A white sports coat and a pink carnation
I'm all dressed up for the dance
A white sports coat and a pink carnation
I'm all alone in romance
