When the moon is up and shining
On the fields a long time bright
Where the crops one time grew
There's a black and gold horizon
Through the trees in the purple moonlight
Welcome to what you knew

There's a place inside the shadows where the stillness
Covers up a night so blue
And it traps the lonely whirlwind there and hides it
From view

In the idle some grow restless
And imagine something more right
Sometimes don't think it through
So they saddle up the ponies and they ride off into the night
One time more, sometimes blue

Sometimes then the only colors they can dream of
Double back and catch a few
Of the crazy moonlight dragons they've been chasing
Through the hills

Now the mist is growing thicker
And it's getting harder to play
Sometimes now mostly true
So they gather 'round the fire and they lie the time away
Sometimes blue, sometimes blue

There's a place inside the shadows where the stillness
Covers up a night so blue
And it traps the lonely whirlwind there and hides it
From view
