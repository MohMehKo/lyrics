Moonlight flickers, blue and gold
No one listens, the stories sold
And hey, it's gonna fracture time
Hey, it's gonna fracture time

Hard as a sun who rides in the western wind
My hands in fire but I can't feel the heat
Torn from the wind
Torn from the very breath I am made of
And incomplete

The screw is turning beneath the crown
The porch lamps burning and no one's home
And hey, it's gonna fracture time
Hey, it's gonna fracture time

Hard as a sun who rides in the western wind
My hands in the fire but I can't feel the heat
Torn from the wind
Torn from the very breath I am made of
And incomplete

Hard as the sun
Hard as the sun
Hard as the sun
Hard as the sun

Hard as the sun that rides in the western wind
My hands in the fire but I can't feel the heat
Torn from the wind
Born of the very breath I am made of
And incomplete

Hard as the sun that rides in the western wind
My hands in the fire but I can't feel the heat
Torn from the wind
Born of the very breath I am made of
And incomplete

Hard as the sun that rides in the western wind
Hard as the sun that rides in the western wind
Hard as the sun that rides in the western wind
