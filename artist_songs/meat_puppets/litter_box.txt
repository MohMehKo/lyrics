We're all in the gutter but I'm
looking the rats and
when I'm hungry I don't fuck around
and I'm not afraid to strew around my scraps
here's a rat carcass for your front lawn
your personal possessions I don't give a darn
maybe you can keep it to keep warm
don't blame me for what goes out my window
I know it was out there in the first place
and besides, I did it for our own good
