I believe in everything
In the whores and the silver ring
I believe in everyone
But the flame has just begun

And I will I quit can't stand the sight of it
And I am I know in the path of your evil glow

I believe in the gathering
I believe in the plastic king
I believe in everyone
But the flame has just begun

And I will I quit can't stand the sight of it
And I am I know in the path of your evil glow

I believe in the rotten rope
I believe in the cantaloup 
I believe in the haunted house
I believe in the Mickey Mouse

Don't believe in humanity
Think they got the best of me
I believe in carpentry
Gonna build a galaxy

And I will I quit can't stand the sight of it
And I am I know in the path of your evil glow

And I will I quit can't stand the sight of it
And I am I know in the path of your evil glow

And I will I quit can't stand the sight of it
And I am I know in the path of your evil glow

And I will I quit can't stand the sight of it
And I am I know in the path of your evil glow
