This house is so damn big that we all hide forever inside
We do it daily but the beneficial remains unrealized
This is the big house
nobody ever leaves
The whole thing vibrates slightly
I can feel that youâ€™re afraid
Frightened is a state of mind
States of mind are harmful
They make you think that think that things are about to become undone
