More and more I find
I thought I lost what I left behind
On and on it goes
Through the door and away it goes

So I'll find myself a new pair of shoes
Make myself a new pair of shoes

Up and down my spine
Feeling broken and now I find
That's the way it's been
My bottom teeth are made of tin

Find myself a new pair of shoes
Make myself a new pair of shoes
Grow myself
Steal myself
Make myself a new pair of shoes

Down and out of time
Slipping underneath the slime
Out the monkey hole
Pay for things I thought I stole

Can you tell my the way it oughta feel
When I'm walking down the road
And I'm looking for a deal
Can you tell 'bout the way I better go
When the sun is coming up
And my shadow starts to show

Hiding out in a cave up in the hills
With a rabbit and a rooster
And some elevating pills
See me round every Monday afternoon
With eleven dog eared doughnuts
And a giant pink baboon

More and more I find
There's not a lot that I left behind
On the lawn it grows
Find the wind and the way it blows
