I realize and I
I gotta get away
I feel alive and I
I go be dead today
I eat some flies and I
I pick ticks off my eyes and
Fry some broken auto parts and
Fly electric monkey carts

Gotta run gotta hide
Gotta get away
Gotta run gotta get away

I see the sky and I
Crawl in a hole and die
I see the rain and
Ride your brand new choo choo train
Find that lovely lizards fly
Try some brain goo picnic pie
Blind no arms no head no leg
Fried another rotten egg
Babe's born to beg

Don't you cry for me
Don't cry for me
Set your neighbors free
Then count to three
Neath the rotten log
Inflatable dog
Long and made of gold
And the corpse is growing cold

I realize and I
I gotta get away
I feel alive and I
I go be dead today
I eat some flies and I
I pick ticks off my eyes and
Fry some other auto parts and
Fly electric monkeys carts

Gotta run gotta hide
Gotta get away
Gotta run gotta get away
Molten human spray
