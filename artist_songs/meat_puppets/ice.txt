How could they be in the sea, the fence across the smokey field
and here inside these raging roads, these deformed fires have been defused
all across the faceless plain the winds have grown to feed the flame
and here beside this flowery pond the snakes have come to feed upon

And the wind blew away in fear
And the smoke blew from here to here

[Chorus:]
(The) ice is on the vine
smoke is on the wire 
Eyes on fire  
[x2]

How could they begin to see the smoke across the stokey tree
and here inside the faceless plain the winds have blown to feed the flame
Drag into this flowery pond the snakes have come to feed upon
beneath the limbs and giant leaves the storm is raging on unseen

And the wind blew away in fear
And the smoke blew from here to here

[Chorus]

Drag into this flowery pond the snakes have come to feed upon
beneath the limbs and giant leaves the storm is raging on unseen

And the wind blew away in fear
And the smoke blew from here to here

[Chorus x5]

Ice on fire [x3]
