He's got a kind of stupefying attitude
You almost see those little wing shoes
Like a light, almost shining through the air
He's a touchdown king
The air is energy whenever he's around
With bolts of lightning from the ground
Like the wind, almost flying through the air
He's a touchdown king
He's had some hard breaks on the wrong side of the line
Time and time again he's out of time
Like the wind, almost flying through the air
He's a touchdown king
The air is energy whenever he's around
With bolts of lightning from the ground
Like a light almost shining through the air
He's a touchdown king
