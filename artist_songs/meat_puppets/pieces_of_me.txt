Once I was something but I can't remember
Whatever that something should be
Once I was something but I can't remember
Whatever that something should be

Mostly I'm scattered with castaway matter
The usual stuff that you see
Hours and hours of televised time
And occasional pieces of me

Once I was something but I can't remember
Whatever that something should be
Hours and hours of televised wind
And occasional pieces of me

I still got the hole where my heart was
And the head where my mind used to live
And the rest of my body was once kidnapped by aliens
Who took most everything I've had to give

There's palm trees and milky machine guns
And sunsets that melt like a gem in the sea
Hours and hours of televised wind
And occasional pieces of me

And I still got the hole where my heart was
And the head where my mind used to live
And the rest of my body was once kidnapped by aliens
Who took most everything I've had to give

There's palm trees and milky machine guns
And sunsets that melt like a gem in the sea
Hours and hours of televised wind
And occasional pieces of me

And once I was something but I can't remember
Whatever that something should be
Hours and hours of televised time
And occasional pieces of me
