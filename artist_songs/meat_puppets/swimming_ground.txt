The sun is up and beating down
Hot enough to melt the ground
A little water would do us good

The clouds would help us if they could
They'd send showers of pouring rain
Get everything wet again

We could go and float around
In our favorite swimming ground
The best place I ever found

Wasn't close to any town
Was a little swimming ground
Everything just floating around

Out to lunch and out of town
Pretty close to falling down
A little water would do us good
