Can't feel the time, the world has always seen a change
This song is my only one, it's a long and lonely one
And I write another one but this sons is never done

Can't put it down, it doesn't need a thing
This song is my only one, it's long and lonely one
And I write another one but this song is never done

I wite it down, it always please away
This song is my only one, it's a long and lonely one
And I write another one but this song is never done

This song is my only one, it's a long and lonely one
And I write another one but this song is never done
