You don't know where the edges are and where do they go
You don't know anything about it at all
I don't know how they're drawn and how do they grow
I can't say anything about that at all

They fly... they fly
Lines slip away without a trace... lines slip away

Try and stare, rub my eyes... there's nothing there
Try and stare at nothing at all
Stay a while, the latest thing is already out of style
Stay a while and nothing is in fashion at all

They fly... they fly
Lines slip away without a trace... lines slip away

You can't hear, see another one and watch it disappear
You don't hear anything about that at all
So it goes, gypsy lines twist and erode
So it goes anytime you get close at all

They fly... fly... fly... fly
Lines slip away without a trace... lines slip away
Lines slip away without a trace... lines slip away

They fly... fly... fly... fly
