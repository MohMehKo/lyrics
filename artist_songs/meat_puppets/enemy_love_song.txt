I thought that it was over
These seem to be the days of wine
You've done as you please
We're all so relieved

I wanna be a rainbow
Laid out across the stormy skies
You've done as you please 
Now down on your knees

There's a shudder in the evening wind
I can feel it in my ear again
Like a rabbit and a carrot fit away

There's a shudder in the evening wind
I can feel it in my ear again
Like a rabbit and a carrot fit away

You turned into a monster
I hope your new life turns alright
You've done as you please
We're all so relieved

There's a shudder in the evening wind
I can feel it in my ear again
Like a rabbit and a carrot fit away

There's a shudder in the evening wind
I can feel it in my ear again
Like a rabbit and a carrot fit away

No is a better number
I'll do a better job for free
You've done as you please
Now down on your knees

There's a shudder in the evening wind
I can feel it in my ear again
Like a rabbit and a carrot fit away

There's a shudder in the evening wind
I can feel it in my ear again
Like a rabbit and a carrot fit away

There's a shudder in the evening wind
I can feel it in my ear again
Like a rabbit and a carrot fit away

There's a shudder in the evening wind
I can feel it in my ear again
Like a rabbit and a carrot fit away
