I want to watch the sun
Burn the backs of my eyes out
While my heart plays a tune
I want to roll on the ground
Eat shit off the ground like a pig
If I could be oriented
I would be happy
This is not all
There is much more on the floor
Than there is on the table
Like pins and half-tendons
Leaked like glue from a tube
A random search reveals
Worms at the base of my spine
But my eyes have yet to decay
I've been left here
With my torso and my eyes
To keep a watch on the place
Where glass birds keep a watch
On the big yellow ovaries
