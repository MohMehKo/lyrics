As I'm lying there
Cold comforts blown from nowhere
And blue light is on the ground
And the coloring
Is changing reflecting everything
From cold mirrors all around

I see candles
On the mountain
I see the vampires
That surround them

Shaking shaking
I see the candles on the mountain

In the still of the night
We stop breathing from this atmosphere
For no air is all around
And the running vein
Is sung softly by the candle light
To cold waters underground

As I'm lying there
Cold comforts blown from nowhere
And blue light is on the ground
And the coloring is changing reflecting everything
From cold mirrors all around
