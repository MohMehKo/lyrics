I wanna be
I wanna be right out there
And watch it blow right out of the radio

I gotta be
I gotta be like something
And watch my face come out of the radio

Never listen
Never listen
Never listen
Never listen

A bell has gone
About to be half open
And watch it blow straight out of the radio

Never listen
Never listen
Never listen
Never listen

You gotta dream
About a thing or something
And let 'em all flies out of the radio

Never listen
Never listen
Never listen
Never listen

Never listen
Never listen
Never listen
Never listen

A bell has gone
About to be half open
A bell has gone
About to be half open
