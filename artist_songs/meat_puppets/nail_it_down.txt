In or around this cold and broken sight, in the heat of events got one thing right
I walked through an invisible fire; I got burned I remember and I still got the scar
Like the loosened connection on your personal circuit
Don't need a hammer just to nail it down, nail it down--nail it down 

You know the thing with the sideways glance; In the heat of a moment there's a little chance
Little face with a painted grin comes the realization you must backwards walk in
If it tries to escape you through an open window 
Don't need a hammer just to nail it down, nail it down--nail it down

Step aside to miss the opening verse; catch the full on blast of what's a little worse
Within a pond down inside somewhere there's a rustle of quiet and the salt of the air
If it tries to escape you through an open window
Don't need a hammer just to nail it down, nail it down--nail it down

Like the loosened connection on your personal circuit
Don't need a hammer just to nail it down, nail it down--nail it down

If it tries to escape you through an open window, nail it down,
nail it down, nail it down, nail it down, nail it down, nail it down, nail it down, nail it down
