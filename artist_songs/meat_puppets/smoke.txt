They say the good times are for hire
But not by everyone, everyone
They say the stars are made of fire
They'll light up anyone, anyone

There must be smoke in my eyes
I feel the flames but I can't see the light
And I know there's stars in the sky
But smoke has made it hard to see tonight

I found a secret I can't hide
And I'm keeping it, I'm keeping it
Don't know if I can sleep at night
Let me sleep on it, let me sleep on it

There must be smoke in my eyes
I feel the flames but I can't see the light
And I know there's stars in the sky
But smoke has made it hard to see tonight

There must be smoke in my eyes
I feel the flames but I can't see the light
And I know there's stars in the sky
But smoke has made it hard to see tonight

There must be smoke in my eyes
I feel the flames but I can't see the light
And I know there's stars in the sky
But smoke has made it hard to see tonight
