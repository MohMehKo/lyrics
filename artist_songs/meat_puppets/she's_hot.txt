She's hot I know
It's good she told me so
It's good she's not
I will she knows

I don't know what my name is
I don't know anything at all
Anything from A to Z
If you remember me at all

She's hot I know
She's hot she told me so
It's good she's not
It's hot she knows

I don't know what my name is
I don't know anything at all
I only know where she is I'll go
If I could read the writing on the wall

This is too much
She's hot and it's so
She is too much
It's good I know

I don't know what my name is
I don't know anything at all
Anything from A to Z
I only know I'll answer when you call
