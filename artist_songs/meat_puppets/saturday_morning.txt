C'mon everybody you know what I mean
won't spell it out for you it's so plain
we're gonna play some numbers this you'd better believe
yes we surely are and we're gonna achieve
don't start talking about bangin' the walls
it isn't gonna happen these are well-guarded halls
don't start talking about how thing's gonna change
you know we don't believe you, we think you're deranged
just give us your money and tell us we're swell
we'll play some tunes for you and then go to hell
