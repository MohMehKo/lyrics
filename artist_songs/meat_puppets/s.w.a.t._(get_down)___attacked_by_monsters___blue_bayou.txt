Well get down, get down, pull your panties down
All I wanna do is stick my uh-uh-uh in you
Get down, get down, pull your panties down
All I wanna do, is get down
Montego, Montoya, 
And all the other ladies, c'mon pretty mama
Well get down, get down, pull your panties down
All I wanna do is put my uh-uh-uh in you 
Get down, get down, pull your panties down
All I wanna do, is get down
Get down, get down, pull your panties down 
All I wanna do is put my uh-uh-uh in you 
Get down, get down, pull your panties down
All I wanna do, is get down
Well, get down, get down, pull your panties down
All I wanna do is put my uh-uh-uh in you
Get down, get down, get down in this town
All I wanna do, is get down
Well, get down, get down, pull your panties down
All I wanna do is put my uh-uh-uh in you

This part of the medley is an early version of "Attacked by Monsters,"
With jibberish variations of "Kokomo" for verses and a variation on the chorus:
"Attacked by dogshit." 

Goin' back some day, come what may, to Blue Bayou
Goin' back some day, come what may, to Blue Bayou
Where the fishin' boats set their sails afloat
If I could only see
That familiar sunrise thru sleepy eyes how happy I'd be
Goin' back some day, come what may, to Blue Bayou
I'm goin' back some day, come what may, to Blue Bayou
Where the fishin' boats set their sails afloat
If I could only see
That familiar sunrise thru sleepy eyes how happy I'd be
I'm goin' back some day, come what may, to Blue Bayou
Goin' back some day, come what may, to Blue Bayou
Where the fishin' boats set their sails afloat
If I could only see
That familiar sunrise thru sleepy eyes how happy I'd be
That vermillion sunrise thru sleepy eyes how happy I'd be
That familiar sunrise thru sleepy eyes how happy I'd be

Thanks a lot, everyone.
