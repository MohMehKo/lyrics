You're the one and the every one
I got a list of the things that you've done
Life's dirty and you know that it's true
Take a look at what is coming out of you

You love me, you love me, you love me
My lamb, hovering in the moonlight
You love me, you love me, you love me
My lamb, hovering in the moonlight

Little cheap and it's never untrue
We never met but I feel it in you
Ever think there is nothing that's wrong
In a world that is totally blasted

You love me, you love me, you love me
My lamb, hovering in the moonlight
You love me, you love me, you love me
My lamb, hovering in the moonlight

Little cheap and it's everyone
Never met but it's comin' out of you
Ever think that it's everything wrong
In a world that is totally plastered

You love me, you love me, you love me
My lamb, hovering in the moonlight
You love me, you love me, you love me
My lamb, hovering in the moonlight
You love me, you love me, you love me
My lamb, hovering in the moonlight
You love me, you love me, you love me
My lamb, hovering in the moonlight
