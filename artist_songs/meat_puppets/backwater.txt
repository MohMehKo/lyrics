And when I wake up in the morning
To feel the daybreak on my face
There's a blood that's flowing through the feeling
With a knife to open up the sky's veins

Some things will never change
You just stand there looking backwards half unconscious from the pain
It may seem rearranged
In the backwater swirling there is something that will never change

And when I should have been done a long time
Laughs and says I'll find ways
Just when we shelter under paper
The rockets come at us sideways

Some things will never change
You just stand there looking backwards half unconscious from the pain
It may seem rearranged
In the backwater swirling there is something that will never change

It may imply
Good vibes
Flow from time
Oh loosed on

And when I wake up in the morning
To feel the daybreak on my face
There's a blood that's flowing through the ceiling
With a knife to open up the sky's veins

Some things will never change
You just stand there looking backwards half unconscious from the pain
It may seem rearranged
In the backwater swirling there is something that will never change

Some things will never change
You just stand there looking backwards half unconscious from the pain
It may seem rearranged
In the backwater swirling there is something that will never change
