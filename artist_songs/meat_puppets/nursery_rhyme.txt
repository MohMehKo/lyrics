The rabbit hole opened so in they all went
And the height of the evening was when you said
We got computers inventing the perfect head

So we all put on our gowns and a truck brought loads of hay
And out of the fog flew a rubber baby
And we opened up the ground and shaped the straw and clay
And out of the fog flew a rubber baby

The donkey receivers were happy and free
And they built them a camp by the shiny sea 
They got computers invented in just a week

So we all put on our gowns and a truck brought loads of hay
And out of the fog flew a rubber baby
And we opened up the ground and shaped the straw and clay
And out of the fog flew a rubber baby

Now in the beginning they just came and went
And they used to pretend they were heaven sent
We got computers that fix all the rust and dents

So we all put on our gowns and a truck brought loads of hay
And out of the fog flew a rubber baby
And we opened up the ground and shaped the straw and clay
And out of the fog flew a rubber baby

And we opened up the ground and shaped the straw and clay
And out of the fog flew a rubber baby
So we all put on our gowns and a truck brought loads of hay
And out of the fog flew a rubber baby

And we opened up the ground and shaped the straw and clay
And out of the fog flew a rubber baby
