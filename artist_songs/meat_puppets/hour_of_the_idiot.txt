Everything starts to multiply
Then it's burning bright
Here aboard this tiny craft
That fact that changes fished in last

This is the hour of the idiot
Wonderful time, we're declined to take command
This is the mirth of human brilliance
A wonderful hour of the idiots at hand

Everything never feels
Pretty sure I screamed grief
This has to be my lucky day
A second help is on its way

This is the hour of the idiot
Wonderful time, we're declined to take command
This is the mirth of human brilliance
A wonderful hour of the idiots at hand

Engines start to multiply
Everything fills my heart
Here aboard this tiny craft
That fact that changed this switched in last

This is the hour of the idiot
Now is the time we've come to take command
This is the mirth of human brilliance
A wonderful hour of the idiots at hand

This is the hour of the idiot
That was a time when the crime could take command
This is the mirth of human brilliance
A wonderful hour of the idiots at hand
