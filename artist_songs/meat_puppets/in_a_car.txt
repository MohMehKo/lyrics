He said, you don't even know
He just said you fell on your head
Through and out the doorway

I know, you were in a car crash
Oh my goodness, no

I saw him, out this door
Car is blown, and out of order
Now, all I can see
I'm in the middle, Someone's dead

Oh No! Get out now
Someone's dead
No, mercy, turn around

How? How? How? You Don't Even know!
