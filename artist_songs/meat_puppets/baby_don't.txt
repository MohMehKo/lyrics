Baby don't blink, lightening speed
Anything is alright with me
Chase that rabbit, up the tree
Anything is alright with me

Honey dripping, plastic flowers
Timeless spaces between the hours
Disappearing down the stream
Water dance itself into the sea

Baby don't move, even breathe
Anything is alright with me
Run in circles till you get free
Anything is alright with me

Red light mansions, toothpick towers
Action figures, special powers
Fancy footwork, shoes for snakes
'Causes I'm so you cannot use the breaks

Baby don't blink, lightening speed
Anything is alright with me
Nail your shadow to a tree
Anything is alright with me

Up the country, down the street
Everybody never meet
Love to see it, stand in line
Hear I'm sorry but not some other time

Baby don't blink, lightening speed
Anything is alright with me
Chase that rabbit up the tree
Anything is alright with me

Lock the door, swallow the key
Anything is alright with me
Run in circles till you get free
Anything is alright with me

Anything is alright with me
Anything is alright with me
