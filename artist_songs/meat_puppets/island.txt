Someday on the moonwalk everything was right
Bounced on the overflow history of life
Somewhere in the afterglow peeling it fell
And it's good to see the happiness far

You're the grass, you're the trees
You're the thing that makes the wind
You're the roots of the sky
You're an island

You never move, you never sleep
You're the thought I cannot keep
You're a denizen of the deep
You're an island

Always in the never glades
Purple wings in five picture 
Golden eyes and I
Somewhere in the afterglow peeling it fell
Where it's coming from no one can ever tell

You're the grass, you're the trees
You're the thing that makes the wind
You're the roots of the sky
You're an island

You never move, you never sleep
You're the thought I cannot keep
You're a denizen of the deep
You're an island

Somewhere on the earth now everything is cool
Drinking from the after flow splash becomes a pool
Somewhere in the after glow peeling it fell
Where it's coming from no one can ever tell

You're the grass, you're the trees
You're the thing that makes the wind
You're the roots of the sky
You're an island

You never move, you never sleep
You're the thought I cannot keep
You're a denizen of the deep
You're an island

You never move, you never sleep
You're the thought I cannot keep
You're a denizen of the deep
You're an island

You're the moon, you're the glass
Down stone the donkeys ass
Up above the heavens laugh
You're an island
