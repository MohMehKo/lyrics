In my downtime
Been to the sun, I've been to the sun a hundred times
In my downtime
On that shit life
Been to the sun, I've been to the sun a hundred times
On that shit life
You don't know what you've been missin'
Oh my God, you been caught itchin'

Arf, arf arf
In my downtime
Been to the sun, been to the sun a hundred times
In my downtime
On that shit life
Been to the sun, I've been to the sun a hundred times
On that shit life
You don't know what you've been missin'
Oh my God, you been caught itchin'

Arf, arf arf
You don't know what you've been missin'
Oh my God, you been caught itchin'

Arf arf, arf arf arf
