A long time ago
I turned to myself
And said you, you are my daughter

I saw that the image
I saw there was well
So you are my daughter

Well then maybe we've got
Something to talk about

Who told you so
That gold burns slow
Like coal camper's candles
All lost in the snow

And you were my daughter
Well then maybe we've got
Something to talk about

Lay down, you're on
The warmth that I'm weaving
Is for you and only you

Lay down, you're on
The warmth

Up on the sun
Where it never rains or snows
There's an ocean
With a wind that never blows
And if you see it closer
Then the finer points will show
Not too much more, too much more
Not too much more, too much more
Not too much more, too much more
Not too much more, too much more

Up on the sun
Where it never rains or snows
There's an ocean
With a wind that never blows
And if you see it closer
Then the finer points will show
Not too much more, too much more
Not too much more, too much more
Not too much more, too much more
Not too much more, too much more
