Fiery spider
Candy stars in bloom
Crystal fire fractures 
Sparks into the room
Shadow seams have opened
Right inside the blaze to
Catch the spinning
Light...
Flaming river
Burning in the sky 
Falls in silence
Over land to dry
Gathering the elephants
Turning light to day
Beneath the current
Light... 
Luminescence
Essence of the will
Time and fire
Turning burning still
Upon the hour table 
Dreams of light are laid
But I'm not sleeping 
Light...
