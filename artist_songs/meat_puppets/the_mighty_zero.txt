Four sides of curves
You call it round
It's saying nothing 
Doesn't make a sound
Doesn't lift a finger
But it's working all the time
Got to know it well
Cause it's always on my mind
Always on my mind

Hidden between the lines
The unsung hero
Taking the time to find
The mighty zero

It's just a number
You can count it on your hand
But I still don't seem to get it
There's nothing to understand
To understand

Woke up this morning
Pulled on my shoes
Nothin's goin' on
But I got no time to lose
Can't seem to see it
Don't seem to care
How you supposed to taste it
There's nothing there
There's nothing there

Nothing there at all
The invisible hero
But you can write it on the wall
The mighty zero

It's just a number
You can count it on your hand
I still don't seem to get it
There's nothing to understand
To understand

Nothing there to show
No big deal no
How would you like to know
The mighty zero
