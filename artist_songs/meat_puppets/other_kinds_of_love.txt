Love is sweeter than honey
Honey is sweeter than wine
Wine is sweeter than tangerines
Tangerines are blind

I know the earth between my feet
I know the skies above
I know that's where the angels meet
To spread unearthly love
Today I walked among them
I could not get enough
They did not even see me
As they did their angel stuff

One takes the staircase
One holds the wheel
One ties the cotton
To the tire maker's heel
Not hand to picture
What I'm thinking of
Many many other kinds of love

Wheels start a-turnin'
A lotta turns make rain
Rain swells the river
And the river floods the plain

I know the earth between my feet
I know the skies above
That's where the angels meet
To spread unearthly love
Six or seven others
Spilled out on the floor
They begin to multiply
There are hundreds more
