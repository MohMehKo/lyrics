This diamond flow I hear, this shiny hole I wear
This broken rock we breathe was once a lifeless square
We welcome you to here, it isn't so I fear
We wouldn't want to stay another perfect day

Vines break the stone and they twist around everyone
Blanket of weeds
Signs stand alone and they don't point for anyone
Blanket of weeds

To walk across this field, this diamond field of seeds
They break and block the sun across a dying sea
The warming of the stone, the blood begins to freeze
The diamond dust it turns and floats upon the sea

Vines break the stone and they twist around everyone
Blanket of weeds
Signs stand alone and they don't point for anyone
Blanket of weeds

This diamond flow I hear, it isn't so I fear
We wouldn't want to spoil another perfect year

Vines break the stone and they twist around everyone
Blanket of weeds
Signs stand alone and they don't point for anyone
Blanket of weeds

Vines break the stone and they twist around everyone
Blanket of weeds
Signs stand alone and they don't point for anyone
Blanket of weeds
