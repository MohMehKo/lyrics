One more drop then I'm gonna stop it
Climb back on a one-way rocket now... rocket now
One more hit then I'm gonna quit it
Then I'm gonna hit 'til I can't stop it now... stop it now

And a thing was here before from an unseen distant shore
Paint the feeling on a sign while I sing in pantomime
Paint the feeling on a sign while I sing it

One more time 'n' then I'm gonna get it
Find that thing and finally wet it down... wet it down
Wet that down and don't be stoppin'
Don't be stoppin' 'til I set it down... set it down

And a thing was here before from an unseen distant shore
Paint the feeling on a sign while I sing in pantomime
Paint the feeling on a sign while I sing it

One more drop then I'm gonna lock it
Take that key to the shop and hock it now... hock it now
Get messed up 'n' then I'll be cleaner
Messed up where the grass is greener now... greener now

And a thing was here before from an unseen distant shore
Paint the feeling on a sign while I sing in pantomime
Paint the feeling on a sign while I sing it

Paint the feeling on a sign while I sing in pantomime
Paint the feeling on a sign while I sing it
