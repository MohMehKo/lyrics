Stupid stars 
They've been in my eyes too long
Hanging down 
Calling ever to no one

And they say there's a tiny kingdom
not too far away
And it rains on the plaster ring
and watch it melt away

Stupid stars 
You could sell them for a song
Never mind 
Warm became the sun

And they say there's a tiny kingdom
not too far away
And it rains on the plaster ring
and watch it melt away

Stupid stars 
They've been in my eyes too long

And they say there's a tiny kingdom
not too far away
And it rains on the plaster ring
and watch it melt away
