On this day we were miles away, we saw a clock up in the sky
The hands lay on the show to pay, number fallen on its side
This day 
Just one note that was all she wrote and the sound blew down the walls
The one boat that was set to float took a trip right down the falls
In two ways we could cut the haze and we never used a knife
In those days there was zero waste, now the waste of time is life
