Now you know, now you know
Now you know the reason why
The rain clouds grow, the skies are low
And the river's getting high

Going down, going down
Going down in the icy water
Going down, going down
Going down in the icy water
Oh the river rose, the sun came up and the sky was melting
Oh the river rose tonight
Oh the river rose, the sun came up and the sky was melting
Oh the river rose tonight

Now we go, now we go
Now we go to higher ground
Bring the kids, bring your clothes
Bring yourself before you drown

Going down, going down
Going down in the icy water
Going down, going down
Going down in the icy water
Oh the river rose, the sun came up and the sky was melting
Oh the river rose tonight
Oh the river rose, the sun came up and the sky was melting
Oh the river rose tonight

Now the sky is clear of clouds
And the water pulls away
So we go, so we go
Back to the river anyway

Going down, going down
Going down in the icy water
Going down, going down
Going down in the icy water
Oh the river rose, the sun came up and the sky was melting
Oh the river rose tonight
Oh the river rose, the sun came up and the sky was melting
Oh the river rose tonight
Oh the river rose, the sun came up and the sky was melting
Oh the river rose tonight
Oh the river rose, the sun came up and the sky was melting
Oh the river rose tonight
