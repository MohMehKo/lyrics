Well they say it's a rotten shame
Everyone is for now to blame
It's the end and it's all the same
Rotten ghost without a name

Go away is the other thing
Nothing more than the other wing 
On fin, one cotton ball
Copper green on a plaster wall

Here I am maybe again
Hear I am maybe again
Like a monster hanging from a tree
Here I am maybe again

Wood, metal, cars and war
They don't do it anymore
No fruit, cottonseed
They're not worth the price of weed

Cheese, shot, shattered bones
They're not worth a garden gnome
[?] boxes, yellow tape
They're not worth another shape

Here I am maybe again
Hear I am maybe again
Like a monster hanging from a tree
Here I am maybe again

Seen riding, seen flying, seen riding, seen flying

And they say it's a rotten shame
Everything is for now to blame
In the end when it's all the same
Rotten ghost without a name

Go away, that's another thing
Nothing more than the other wing
One fin, one cotton ball
Copper green on a plaster wall

Wood, metal, cars and war
They won't do it anymore
They're not worth the price of weed
Nothing more than a cotton seed

Here I am maybe again
Hear I am maybe again
Like a monster hanging from a tree
Here I am maybe again

Here I am maybe again
Hear I am maybe again
Like a monster hanging from a tree
Here I am maybe again

Well they say it's a rotten shame
