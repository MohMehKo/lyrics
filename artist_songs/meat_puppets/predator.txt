This rendered me silent
Tuneless, only petrified
Roads leading to nowhere
Twisting through it's silver hair

In time I got me the lucky right
To see it in an apple light
I'll always remember right
To see it in an apple light

Sleep, asleep in an old chair
Stupor of another time
Thoughts circling nowhere
Captured in a bed of lime

Once while I was watching
Something got a piece of me
Now, now I can tell you
Why I am incomplete

Now the predator is in sight
It sees me in an apple light
I'll always remember right
To see it in an apple light
