They are not stars, 
burning in the sky at night. 
No, no they're candles, 
in astro-flight. 

They are not men, 
walking on the streets below, 
what are they really, 
no body knows. 

They are not stars, 
We are not human. 
I don't know 
the reason why. 

A firefly is not a candle, 
not a flower in my eye. 
And so, a rose is not a rose, 
by any, any other name. 

Things remain... 
Unexplained. 

I am a tree, 
dancing on the ocean floor. 
The air is water, 
On desert shores. 

There is a face, 
Hanging on the salty moon. 
Trees singing, 
this silent tune. 

They are not stars, 
We are not human. 
I don't know 
the reason why. 

A firefly is not a candle, 
not a flower in my eye. 
And so, a rose is not a rose, 
by any, any other name. 

Things remain... 
Unexplained. 

They are not stars, 
We are not human. 
I don't know 
the reason why. 

A firefly is not a candle, 
But a flower in my eye. 
And so, a rose is not a rose, 
by any, any other name.
