Here's a question, which one is right, now?
Now replyin', chicken equals cow
And cows don't mean a thing
Here's the righteous spring

Got a big head and it only keeps growin'
And the wind in my thought, it keeps blowing
And I don't know a damn thing anyway

And I'ma put my ass on the line in this song
And you can kiss this if you think that I'm wrong
And I don't know a damn thing anyway

Here's the answer, nothing goes unsung
Now replyin', cross it off your tongue
Words don't mean a thing
One more noise will sing

Got a big head and it only keeps growin'
But the wind in my thought, it keeps blowing
And I don't know a damn thing anyway

I'ma put my ass on the line in this song
And you can kiss this if you think that I'm wrong
And I don't know a damn thing anyway

Got a big head and it only keeps growin'
But the wind in my thought, it keeps blowing
I don't know a damn thing anyway

I'ma put my ass on the line in this song
And you can kiss this if you think that I'm wrong
And I don't know a damn thing anyway

Got a big head and it only keeps growin'
And the wind in my thought, it keeps blowing
I don't know a damn thing anyway

And I've been knocked into a hole and I'm standing
Turn into a troll and I'm remanding
And I don't know a damn thing anyway
