Rocket the grapes from the vine
Turn all the icing to lead
Turn all the lights off on yesterday's flowers

Shuts down again and again
Fills up again and again
Flashes of lightning in a river of love
Falls down again and again

Once more again do we find
Reality lingers behind
To bury our memories in a hole by the road

Falls down again and again
Fills up again and again
Flashes of lightning in a river of love
Falls down again and again

Once more again do we find
Reality lingers behind
To turn all the lights out on yesterday's flowers

Shuts down again and again
Fills up again and again
Flashes of lightning in a river of love
Falls down again and again

Shuts down again and again
Fills up again and again
