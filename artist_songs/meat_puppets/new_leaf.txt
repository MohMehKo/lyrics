Back before the days, back before the water
The invisible waves slammed the primal notion
They said you were wrong, though you had connected
These watery songs cleverly perfected

[Chorus:]
Dispensary of predictable mind
like a new leaf, from the old days
unfolding now the most ridiculous mind
like a new leaf in the old ways

These slippery shoes never fit the sailor
all scattered and bruised since it left the railing
it wouldn't behave, bad at problem solving
so it couldn't be saved, all these things revolving

[Chorus]

Back before the days, back before the water
The invisible waves slapped the primal notion
they wouldn't behave, bad at problem solving
so it couldn't be saved, all these things revolving

[Chorus x2]

[Chorus]
