Maybe you won't have to hit me again 
Maybe you won't try to slap me for lying
I did what you heard and I can admit
That I'd do it again in a second tomorrow 
Little or nothing makes much of a difference 
So I took the chance not to bother with trifles 
You mind your business and I'll pick the slack up
and you'll never notice how much I have borrowed
And we say, "That's how it goes,"
And we stay, watching the mess that we've made as it grows
I took a long drink of some kind of water
That ate up my thoughts and dried up my conscience
I'd be the first to admit what my faults are
But change is a problem and I'll be resistant
Little or nowhere is closer than ever
And I got the feeling we're stuck till tomorrow
Carry on fishing and I'll keep my hat on
and together we'll see just how much we can borrow
And we say, "That's how it goes,"
And we stay, watching the mess that we've made as it grows
Maybe you won't have to hit me again
Maybe you won't try to slap me for lying
I did what you heard and I can admit
That I'd do it again in a second tomorrow
Little or nothing makes much of a difference
So I took the chance not to bother with trifles
You mind your business and I'll pick the slack up
and you'll never notice how much I have borrowed
And we say, "That's how it goes,"
And we stay, watching the mess that we've made as it grows
And we say, "That's how it goes,"
And we stay, watching the mess that we've made as it grows
