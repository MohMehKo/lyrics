Of all the people I've known
This one, you, you really hit home
Half a dozen of one thing
And a decade of another

You tried to change the time
When you stole it from your mother
I'd put my hat on my head if I had one
Lord knows what he's got in store
Everything is shaped by a cross
And you'd do as easy as the next one

Better open my eyes now
Everything at the door
Best keep my eyes closed
I want to see the lights of Elenore

Of all the people left unknown
You taught me how to be alone
Elenore Moth-god, daughter of the hot-rod
Light like liquid moss covers up
The gray hard rock
