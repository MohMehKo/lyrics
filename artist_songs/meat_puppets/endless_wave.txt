I have always been a monster 
And though it seems a game of fools
And I have always come out losing
When it's someone else's rules

The song across the endless sea
Sends a wave that crashes over me, over me
The song above the giant roar
The endless wave that crashes over me, over me

I could never make the journey
And I can hardly even swim
That's why I'm so fascinated
Just how deep I've been pulled in

The song across the endless sea
Sends a wave that crashes over me, over me
The song above the giant roar
The endless wave that crashes over me, over me

Here's the horns of my dilemma
What's behind the siren's song
Do I crawl to my own drummer
Or am I being dragged along

The song across the endless sea
Sends a wave that crashes over me, over me
The song above the giant roar
The endless wave that crashes over me, over me

The song across the endless sea
Sends a wave that crashes over me, over me
The song above the giant roar
The endless wave that crashes over me, over me

The song above the giant roar
The endless wave that crashes over me, over me
The song across the endless sea
Sends a wave that crashes over me, over me
