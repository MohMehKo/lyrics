You're caught in the darkness 
And you will see
Just call my name and I'll be there
You cannot touch me 
You would not dare
I am the chill that's in the air
And I try to get through to you
In my own special way 

...I can't seem to... my mind 
I can't seem to... my mind
Make a joke and I will sigh and you will laugh and I will cry
Take a look into my mind and you will see...
Can you help me, help me find my brain?
Aw yeah
Finished with my woman 'cause she could not help me with my mind
People tell me insane because I am crying all the time
I don't know... 
...those things in life that I can't find
Can you help me, help me find my brain?
All right

When I first met you, you were mine,
Can't forget you or your disguise
You introduced me to my mind
And left me wanting you and your kind
Right now! 
My life was empty, (forever) on a down,
Until you took me, showed me around
My life is free now, an' I can't see
I love you sweet leaf but you can't hear me
Right now!
