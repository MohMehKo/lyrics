I see it, I get it, to find it below
You know me, your fire, but I can't let go
In silence through canyons of motion we start
Beyond us these motions emerge from the dark
Now I'm tied up in circles
So I won't fall apart
Tied up and tangled strings on your heart
It's clouded in mystery surrounding your heart
It stumbles to finish before it can start
In silence, through canyons of motion we start
Beyond us these motions emerge from the dark
Now I'm tied up in circles
So I won't fall apart
Tied up and tangled strings on your heart
Strings on your heart...
I see it, the emotions surrounding your heart
I get it to stumble before it can start
Beyond us through canyons of motion we start
Beyond us through canyons emerge from the dark
Now I'm tied up in circles
So I won't fall apart
Tied up and tangled strings on your heart
Now I'm tied up in circles
So I won't fall apart
Tied up and tangled strings on your heart
Strings on your heart...
