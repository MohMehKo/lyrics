We love, that's why we're here
oh yes, we hold you all so dear
and now this one's for you
a love offering for your ears
our fans hold us in highest esteem
faithful, that's how it seems
and now straight from our hearts
a love offering, so bold so new
(it never stops, it never starts)
oh yes, it's for sure my life's call
entertaining for folks short and tall
you've bee n so kind for all these years
we'll never be able to repay you all
(how can I hold back the tears?)
