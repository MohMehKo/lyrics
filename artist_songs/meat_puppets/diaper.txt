I am a chemical reaction
To a practical solution
And I'm trapped out in the middle
Of a lake of my pollution
If I don't give myself a break
I might just give myself
A tummyache
Some things appear out of the blue
Directionless
So what
I'm tried and true
This is a registered denial
Of a toxic situation
But I have really grown to cherish
All of my vile habituations
The air in my crib's gettin strange
It looks like my diaper
Needs a-changin'
Sometimes it seems nothin will do
Directionless
So what
I'm tried and true
I am a permanent example
Of a passing fascination
And I am trying hard to swallow
All of the beautiful information
Sometimes it seems nothing will do
Directionless
So what
I'm tried and true
The air in my crib's gettin strange
It looks like my diaper
Needs a-changin'
Some things appear out of the blue
Directionless
So what
I'm tried and true
Sometimes it seems nothing will do
Directionless
So what
I'm tried and true
