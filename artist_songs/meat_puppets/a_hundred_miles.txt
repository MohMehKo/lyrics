I've got a question, I got to know
I see right what I'm looking for
I see, I see, I see

I got no hurry, I've got no fight
I know it's all in the hidden light
I know, I know, I know

I can't see it with my eyes
But I can feel it
And it might just be
A hundred miles away 

I can't see it with my eyes
But I can feel it
And it might just be
A hundred miles away 

I've got no business, I got no right
And I know, that's not very nice
I know, I know, I know

I can't see it with my eyes
But I can feel it 
And it might just be
A hundred miles away

I can't see it with my eyes
But I can feel it 
And it might just be
A hundred miles away

I can't see it with my eyes
But I can feel it
And it might just be
A hundred miles away

I can't see it with my eyes
But I can feel it
And it might just be
A hundred miles away

I can't see it with my eyes
But I can feel it
And it might just be
A hundred miles away

I can't see it with my eyes
But I can feel it
And it might just be
A hundred miles away
