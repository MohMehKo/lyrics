I'm dead, got nothing to lose
the biggest fucker around's gonna give himself
the blues trying to make trouble for a dead man
what's that, you're mistaken
the spot you wanted most has already been taken
and it's been taken by your own self
no reason for a hasty retreat
you're dead just a little bit too
perhaps you've forgotten all the things you can't do
like letting your belly get swollen
from lack of food
and every broken rock or bone
or blue-green god tree or the smell of damp
or the touch of you reminds me
of the you we once knew
