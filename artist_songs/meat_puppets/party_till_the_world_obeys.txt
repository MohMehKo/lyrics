They draw the line you cannot see
They build the cage that sets you free
They drop the word from up above
They crack the whip you've grown to love
Say what? Say what?
Party till the world obeys...

They pull the load with all your might
And make you blind to fix your sight
You fly on wings into their snare
They sell you tickets to thin air
Say what? Say what?
Party till the world obeys...
