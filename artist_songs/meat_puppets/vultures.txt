Vultures circle the sky 
Burning the ground from on high

[Chorus:]
Maybe I've been wasted
and maybe I'm amused
but mostly this just seems like a whole lot to lose
in such a small time
in such a small time

We killed it off before it could fly
hunted it down and then watched it die

[Chorus]

Vultures flying in code
burned the tongues from the road

Maybe it's amazing
and maybe I'm confused
but mostly this just seems like a whole lot to lose
but mostly this just seems like a whole lot to lose
in such a small time
in such a small time
