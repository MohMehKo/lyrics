Backdoor swinging open from the yard
Sterno-boy is carrying a sword
Chasing cats 'n' rabbits in the bushes and the garbage bins
Chasing cats and rabbits in the yard

Down, don't make me down
Don't let me be here down on my knees
You're a waterfall of color
You're a waterfall of color

Blacktop needs another coat of paint
Turns to mud and gravel when it rains
Washing off the coloring, tearing up the underthings
Washing off another coat of paint

Down, don't make me down
Don't leave me here down on my knees
You're a waterfall of color
You're a waterfall of color

Running off the fire-jelly boy
Come back when you cannot hang around
Take your little plastic sword
Go and hit the running board
Tell your mama fire-jelly boy

Down, don't make me down
Don't leave me here down on my knees
You're a waterfall of color
You're a waterfall of color

Down, don't make me down
Don't leave me here down on my knees
You're a waterfall of color
You're a waterfall of color
