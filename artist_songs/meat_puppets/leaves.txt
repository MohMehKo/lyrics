One afternoon as dusk was nearing
I saw something I thought worth hearing
Something that's been around so long
Now listen to my new year's song
Who ever made up the calendar was wrong
It's new years all year long
Each year is a minute
Only full of the leaves in it
Now Daddy said this to his son
I know for sure this can be done
We'll cover up our tracks and then
Walk back the other way again
Who ever made up the calendar was wrong
It's new years all year long
Each year is a minute
Only full of the leaves in it
One day in a forest clearing
I saw different things appearing
And now it's been around so long
Now listen to my new years song
