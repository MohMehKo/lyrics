I, drawin' of a sunshine, I
I, an X ray of a dream, I
And a boat that's out on water
Up the river made of sand

I, drawin' every mountain, I
I, postcard in my hand, I
And a boat that's out on water
Up the river made of sand

Move the picture from the wall to the shelf
And the picture said "I love myself"
Swearin' at the rain as it felt
And the rain said back "I'm not myself"

I, come to the desert, I
I, monkey on my back, I
And a boat that's out on water
Up the river made of sand

Move the picture from the wall to the shelf
And the picture said "I love myself"
Swearin' at the rain as it felt
And the rain said back "I'm not myself"

Move the picture from the wall to the shelf
And the picture said "I love myself"
Swearin' at the rain as it felt
And the rain said back, "I'm not myself"

Move the picture from the wall to the shelf
And the picture said, "I love myself"
Swearin' at the rain as it felt
And the rain said back, "I'm not myself"
