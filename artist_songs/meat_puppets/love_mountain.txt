There's a mountain, it's so high
You cannot see the top from the naked eye
That's the mountain where we live
Mountain of love we got so much to give

Gonna head on out to where the flowers bloom
Stop for awhile on the way to the moon
It's raining but I feel so fine
It's raining, raining bright sunshine
It's raining but I feel so fine
It's raining, raining bright sunshine

There's a river, it's so wide
You cannot swim across to the other side
That's the river where its lives
River of love it's got so much to give

Gonna head on out to where the flowers bloom
Stop for awhile on the way to the moon
It's raining but I feel so fine
It's raining, raining bright sunshine
It's raining but I feel so fine
It's raining, raining bright sunshine

There's a mountain, it's so high
You cannot see the top from the naked eye
That's the mountain where we live
Mountain of love we got so much to give

Gonna head on out to where the flowers bloom
Stop for awhile on the way to the moon
It's raining but I feel so fine
It's raining, raining bright sunshine
It's raining but I feel so fine
It's raining, raining bright sunshine

It's raining but I feel so fine
It's raining, raining bright sunshine
It's raining but I feel so fine
It's raining, raining bright sunshine

It's raining but I feel so fine
It's raining, raining bright sunshine
