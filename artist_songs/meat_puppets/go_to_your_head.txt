You say you want nothing, that's alright
'Cause nothing is easy and nothing'll last you all night
In pieces and pieces and pieces go under the spell
They say you must be well

Let it go to your head
Say you want nothing and kill you instead
Let it go to your head
Say you want nothing

Night once again and the dust-devils rise
In dreams their fingers pry open your eyes
Little by little by little it all goes to hell
They say you must be well

Let it go to your head
Say you want nothing and kill you instead
Let it go to your head
Say you want nothing

Not saying nothing, that hasn't been said
And nothing is easy to say so I'll say it instead
Little by little by little take down the light
They say you must be right

Let it go to your head
Say you want nothing and kill you instead
Let it go to your head
Say you want nothing

Let it go to your head
Say you want nothing and kill you instead
Let it go to your head
Say you want nothing
