With a mind that's sick and crazy
Put together like a baby in a fist fight
Here comes an angel flying 
Like a moth to a backyard bug-light
One mind two hearts somehow got torn apart and healed
But never grew together
Like a rock tied to a feather

The ocean's parted for the boiling ice cream vendor
The condor circles in the vapor up above
The misses cheering
As the worm departs the apple
The old machinery
Has registered its love

In the air there is a rumbling
It sends the two hearts tumbling 
Into a pool of thick black tar
Sink to the sky and hand like a black star
Tunnel of love sincerely
I miss your poor heart dearly
I wish I never had killed you
The blue birds sing so sweetly

The ocean's parted for the boiling ice cream vendor
The condor circles in the vapor up above
The misses cheering as the worm departs the apple
The old machinery has registered its love

Push the button
Cross the water
Push the button
Cross the water

Tunnel of love sincerely
I miss your poor heart dearly
I wish I never had killed you
The blue birds sing so sweetly
Twinkle, twinkle, little monkey
You know that I'm a junkie
I'll give you love and hate
I think I know which way, now

The ocean's parted for the boiling ice cream vendor
The condor circles in the vapor up above
The misses cheering as the worm departs the apple
The old machinery has registered its love

The ocean's parted for the boiling ice cream vendor
The condor circles in the vapor up above
The misses cheering as the worm departs the apple
The old machinery has registered its love

Push the button
Cross the water
