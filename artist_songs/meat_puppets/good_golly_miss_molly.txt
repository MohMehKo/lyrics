Good golly miss Molly, sure like to ball,
When you're rockin' and a rollin', can't hear your mama call

From the early early mornin' to the early early night,
When I caught miss Molly rockin' at the house of blue lights,
Good golly miss Molly, sure like to ball,
When you're rockin' and a rollin', can't hear your mama call

Mama, papa told me 'Son, you better watch yourself',
If they knew about miss Molly, have to watch my pa myself,

When you're rockin' and a rollin', can't hear your mama call
