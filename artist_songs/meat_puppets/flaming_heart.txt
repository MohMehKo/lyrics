Praise the sight
Someone dropped a ball on me
Damn the wind
Giving life to sails
Human sin
Couldn't stir a fire in me
Damn the night
As the powders fail

And one beam of light is falling
From a single crazy eye
And it sweeps the inside sky
From east to right
Flaming heart, burning out

Pray tonight
Someone burns a name on me
Damn the sight
Painted on my eyes
Back to life
Passing through the wall to me
Feel the fire
Violet, black, and white

Late tonight
Someone pinned a tail on me
Later on
Someone robbed me blind
Took my life
Took my box of chicken teeth
Take the blame
Trusted enemy
