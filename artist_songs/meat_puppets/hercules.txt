If you don't look you won't see
Everybody is Hercules
If you don't watch you won't be cool
And nobody will like you 

You just experienced the latest invention
In a place that's too miserable to mention
And someone did some things to you just the other day
That are just too dirty for me to want to say

Well you just experienced the latest thing
I know it's just another thing
Just when you think that you're safe and alone
There comes a big, fat zombie with a taste for your tail-bone

If you don't look you won't see
Everybody is Hercules
If you don't watch you won't be cool
And nobody will like you

You got a problem?
I think I got a problem
I've just been molested by a prehistoric goblin
From Mars with a Martian eyeball
And it's just like a jelly fish nailed to a wall

If you don't look you won't see
Everybody is Hercules
If you don't watch you won't be cool
And nobody will like you

I see a spider-man vigorously jumping
Up and down on a little pink dumpling
Never-Never Land sparkles in the midst
Of the dust of a table being beaten by an ape fist.

If you don't look you won't see
Everybody is Hercules
If you don't watch you won't be cool
And nobody will like you

If you don't look you won't see
Everybody is Hercules
If you don't watch you won't be cool
And nobody will like you
