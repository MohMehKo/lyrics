Down in the valley
There's an animal kingdom 
You can't even see it
Till the sun goes down
Up in the mountains
There's beautiful rings
On fingers that dance
To invisible sound
Up in my head
There's an animal kingdom
I am the king
Of the animals there
Up in the mountains (my head)
I'm a beautiful singer
To birds that dance
On invisible air
