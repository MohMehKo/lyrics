Put off the light
Draw the line at anything natural
Flesh is fine
Redefines the meaning of natural
Nothing could own us.

Draw the wine, raise the glass to all the unnaturals
Raise the glass, raise it high to all the unnaturals
Nothing could own us.

Rub your eyes sending it back
Before where it came from...
Rub your eyes sending it back
Before where it came from...

Drop the lamp, try to find if anything's happening
Drop the lamp, stumble to find if anything's happening...
There's nothing below us

Rub your eyes sending it back
Before where it came from...
Rub your eyes sending it back
Before where it came from...

Put off the light
Draw the line at anything natural
Flesh is fine
Redefines the meaning of natural
Nothing could own us.

Rub your eyes sending it back
Before where it came from...
Rub your eyes sending it back
Before where it came from...

Rub your eyes sending it back
Before where it came from...
Rub your eyes sending it back
Before where it came from...
