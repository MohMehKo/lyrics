Love flies on wings
Listen to the angels sing
Love flies on wings
Put it in the calibrations
Show it to be ornamental
Wrapped up, crapped on, torn up, thrown away 
Love flies on wings 

Oh be joyful
Try knock 'em stiff 
Send in the clowns
Popskull

Here come the clowns
Welcome all to tiny town
Send in the clowns
Put it on the burner
With an extra shot of bubble water
That's right you take no more little dribble
Here come the clowns

Oh be joyful
Try knock 'em stiff
Send in the clowns
Popskull
