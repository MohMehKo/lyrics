Coming down from the mountain
I have seen the high and mighty
I will go again someday
But for now I'm coming down
Coming down from the mountain
I have seen the lofty glory
I will go again someday
But for now I'm coming down

I have seen the information
On the lighter side of dumbness
I have heard the new statistics
And the stomping on the ground
Picking slowly up the rockslide
One thing always seems apparent
If the climb becomes too much
I can always turn around

Waking up from my slumber
To misunderstand another
Though they call it terra firma
It dissolves beneath my feet
Looking through a pile of garbage
For some worthless piece of paper
That's been hidden there for me
To give meaning to my day

I have seen the information
On the lighter side of dumbness
I have heard the new statistics
And the stomping on the ground
Picking slowly up the rockslide
One thing always seems apparent
If the climb becomes too much
I can always turn around

Going down to the desert
To the dirty filthy desert
I'll be crawling through the sand
For at least a couple days
Going down to the desert
There are things there worth avoiding
And it always makes me cross
When those things get in my way.

I have seen the information
On the lighter side of dumbness
I have heard the new statistics
And the stomping on the ground
Picking slowly up the rockslide
One thing always seems apparent
If the climb becomes too much
I can always turn around

Coming down from the mountain
I have seen the high and mighty
I will go again someday
But for now I'm coming down
Coming down from the mountain
I have seen the lofty glory
I will go again someday
But for now I'm coming down

Coming down from the mountain
I have seen the high and mighty
I will go again someday
But for now I'm coming down
Coming down from the mountain
I have seen the lofty glory
I will go again someday
But for now I'm coming down
