Quit it give it up, ring that bell
You climb the walls, might as well
Like golden roses fallin' down
Ringing out all over town
Somewhere in the ballroom
Rain begins to fall
The dancers twisted on
Through the thunder and the walls

There is a haze out on the field
There is a fender over the wheel
A string of crows flyin' out the haze
Settles on the fender will not go away
Backwards to the sunset
On a horse without a brain
Met the moon one evening
As I stood out in the rain

Quit it give it up, ring that bell
Quit it give it up, might as well

Dynamite lyin' round
Blowin' up, blowin' down
Peekin' up, diving in
Rosie Ribbon howls let's do it again
Feeling too far sideways
Flashin' in the pan
Dove in through the window
Stumbled to a stand

Baby give it up, ring that bell
Quit it, give it up, might as well
