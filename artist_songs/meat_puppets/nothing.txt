I fall towards a flash of light
That burns the seed of life away
No thing is changed
Nothing arranged
No thing will ever be

There's no place
Clear dry space
I'm a hole in this time
In a time full of holes
You see it
I'm nothing

My heart is gone I missed the point
I sleep to dream I'm wide awake
Nothing is near or far away
Nothing awaits to be

Here I stand
Tongue in hand
I'm a hole in this time
In a time full of holes
You see it

I'm nothing
I think perhaps I'll live to lie
Awake to fall asleep to fall
Into a trance in which I dream
I lived and walked upon
