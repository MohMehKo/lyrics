Maybe you think that you're nylon
You seem to say
You are children of the world 
And maybe you think

You're an astronaut from stars
Wide your honesty and your pearls
Jokes are a greeting in your garden
From your side you say everything

And I think it's common lie
It's on the rise, it's on the rise
And I think it's common lie
It's on the rise, it's on the rise

Maybe you think it's pornography
You seem to say 
I'm the people of the world
And maybe you think you're a genius

Retard of bloom
Your banner is unfilled
Now you're selling the touch of your hand
How much salvation can my stomach stand?

And I think it's common lie
It's on the rise, it's on the rise
And I think it's common lie
It's on the rise, it's on the rise

Maybe you think that you're nylon
You seem to say
You are children of the world
And maybe you think

You're an astronaut from stars
Wide your honesty and your pearls
Jokes are a greeting in your garden
From your side you say everything

And I think it's common lie
It's on the rise, it's on the rise
And I think it's common lie
It's on the rise, it's on the rise

And I think it's common lie
It's on the rise, it's on the rise
And I think it's common lie
It's on the rise, it's on the rise
