Try to hold it but it vanishes from my hands
Try to swim in it, I wind up on cold sand
Try to cut it but I cannot make the knife go
Try running but my legs are moving too slow
So I wait for the wind, burn my head again

A million dollars doesn't buy you much of anything
'Cause nothing you can feel good really stays
So I wait for the wind and burn my head again
And I won't feel the rocks when I'm diving in

It's like I tell, it won't be so
I'll see it, I'll see it
These eyes are really made of stone
I don't see it, I don't see it

Makes me dizzy but I always like a good spin
Think I'm treading in the puddle that I'm standing in
So I wait for the wind, burn my head again

It's like I tell, It won't be so
I'll see it, I'll see it
These eyes are really made of stone
I don't see it, I don't see it

It's like I tell, It won't be so
I'll see it, I'll see it
These eyes are really made of stone
I don't see it, I don't see it

It's like I tell, It won't be so
I'll see it, I'll see it
These eyes are really made of stone
I don't see it, I don't see it
