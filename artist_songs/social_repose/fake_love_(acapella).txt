I've been down so long it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face
I've been down so long it look like up to me
They look up to me
I've got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face

Somethin' ain't right when we talkin'
Somethin' ain't right when we talkin'
Look like you hidin' your problems
Really you never was all in
No you can't son me, you won't never get to run me

That's when they smile in my face
Whole time they wanna take my place
Whole time they wanna take my place
I can tell that love is fake
I don't trust a word you say
After your mistakes

I've been down so long it look like up to me
They look up to me
I've got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face

That's when they smile in my face
Whole time they wanna take my place
Whole time they wanna take my place
I can tell that love is fake
I don't trust a word you say
After your mistakes

I've been down so long it look like up to me...
