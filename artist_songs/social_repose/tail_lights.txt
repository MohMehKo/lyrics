Last thing I remember
Was the rain beating down on the hood of your car
As I watched your tail lights bleed into the sun
Empty strings of absent words
A verbal beating you did not deserve
I stand there motionless
As she screamed

Darling I can't even make you smile
It seems that all you want to give me is your apathy
And I feel like I should go
What's the point of happiness
If being happy kills a better part of me, why can't you say
I spent one year four months with you
And only about half of that felt true
Let's lay this to rest, it's for the best

I lay my head down on the table
I start to feel upset
One night, one more fight, are we ever gonna be alright
A temperamental seems out of sight
I lay there and stare down my shadow and all I could think of was how she screamed

Darling, I can't even make you smile
It seems that all you want to give me is hostility
And I feel like I should go
What's the point of happiness
If being happy kills the better part of me, why can't you say
I spent one year four months with you
And only half of that felt true
Let's lay this to rest, it's for the best

It's 3 PM on a Sunday
I didn't try to get out of bed
Just another day, just another week, just another sorry excuse to write this song
(I can still see the tail lights fading)
