Put your arms in and hold me tight
your kiss kills with every could have been
I'll wipe away the tears down your face
But where were mine?

I could have been the sand between your toes
But you're the coast and I am lost at sea
It saddens me that I'll see you go
But you and I know our love did fade

When you come undone
I'll be the only one
To carry you down the path
Through the sand and fog

The serrated heart will have time to mend
Even thought it had to break and bend
A clever mind to calculate
What had gone wrong!

And the Architect will come down from space
Just to put you back in your place
But you and I know the truth
we are alone

When you come undone
I'll be the only one
To carry you down the path
Through the sand and fog

And when the dust has burnt away
I'll be wishing that I had stayed
But for the last time we'd speak our minds
And say goodbye

When you come undone
I'll be the only one
To carry you down the path
Through the sand and fog
