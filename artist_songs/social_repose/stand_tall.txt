Sometimes I have these thoughts
What happened to kicking back the dawn?
And I've started fighting wars with myself
But what's so fun about a party of one?

I stand tall
When they want me to fall
I don't care what my peers say
I'm gonna do this my way
My way

I'm tired of living
Below my feet
Going wherever pop culture leads
I made up my mind:
I will swallow my pride
I'm doing what feels right
But it will come overnight

I stand tall
When they want me to fall
I don't care what my peers say
I'm gonna do this my way
My way

My way
My way

Avoid the path
Of least resistance
All I need is a little persistence
To find my way

I'll find my way!

I'll stand tall
When they want me to fall
I don't care what my peers say
I'm gonna do this my way
