I said to leave it when I've hit a brick wall
I tied you to something you could never beat
There was a hint
A spark to ignite
A fire beneath your skin
I climbed down the wall
And got burned to life
We buried our love
And got buried alive

I just want your crazy manic love 
I don't need to sleep
I don't need my friends
I just want your every second wrapped around my neck
Don't let me breath
Take me under

You are my ruines that love has end
That kind of makes my reasons break and bend
Break and bend [x4]
Bend...
[?] you watch me burn

Watch me burn [x3]
(Burn)
(Watch me burn)

[?]
I tried convincing you to be a disaster 
One have a heart can't nearly try to fill a hole

I just want your crazy manic love 
I don't need to sleep
I don't need my friends
I just want your every second wrapped around my neck
Don't let me breath
Take me under

You are my ruines that love has end 
That kind of makes my reasons break and bend
Break and bend [x4]
Bend...
[?] you watch me burn

Watch me burn [x3]
(Watch me burn) [?]
(Watch me burn) I tried convincing you to be a disaster
(Watch me burn) One have a heart can't nearly try to fill a hole
Watch me burn
