I have no idea
Where I'm going
And I have no clue

Where I belong
But I know a place
Where I can go
When aligns
Are louder than drugs
(Louder)
(Louder)
Last few nights
With every color in the specturm
All I fell is my heart
And that bass drum
And if you ask me where
I was one hour ago
I'd pull you in and
Say "girl you don't wanna know"
You don't wanna know
You, you don't wanna know
Staggered in
Blacked out
Bruised up
I'm the center stage cruising like a cannonball
Had enough
Not yet
I'm wrecked
But I wouldn't go and blame it on the alcohol
I can feel your heart beat
Right over the bag bean
And it's killing me
When the sun sets
I forget the concept
That I've rated alone
Face down
On the ground
Who's gonna stay
Come round when my luck runs out
Free fall
Desolve
My pace has slowed to a crawl
Stagger in
Blacked out
Bruised up
I'm a center stage cruising like a cannonball
Had enough
Not yet
I'm wrecked
But I wouldn't go and blame it on the alcohol
Stagger in
Blacked out
Bruised up
I'm a center stage cruising like a cannonball
Had enough
Not yet
I'm wrecked
But I wouldn't go and blame it on the alcohol
Stagger in
Blacked out
Bruised up
I'm a center stage cruising like a cannonball
Had enough
Not yet
I'm wrecked
But I wouldn't go and blame it on the alcohol
