Darling I love you
But you love your demons more than you could ever love me

I'm watching a slow motion accident
There's enough time to look but not react
I wanna help you while you're still intact
Am I wasting my breath
You're staging yourself for sudden death

Tell me all your stories
Tell me where you've been
Were all those thoughts just works of fiction
Do you feel lonely, misunderstood
I can feel it too, yeah it surrounds you
Give me every word, tell me where you bleed
Did your Father leave you with no room to breathe
A steady decline, I'll toss you a rope
But its up to you to try and not lose hope

Darling I love you
But you love your demons more than you could ever love me

I won't ask you again
Your silence speaks for itself
I can't relate to the fact how you torture yourself like that
Make me understand, this is not a demand but I don't know what else to do
Tell me what I am to you
Another blip on your timeline, I see right through you
What good is my help when you can't help yourself

Tell me all your stories
Tell me where you've been
Were all those thoughts just works of fiction
Do you feel lonely, misunderstood
I can feel it too, yeah it surrounds you
Give me every word, tell me where it hurts
Did you lose your Mother right after birth
A steady decline, I'll toss you a rope
But its up to you to try and not lose hope

Are you losing yourself
No I'm not losing myself
Are you losing yourself
I'm not losing myself
Are you losing yourself
Fine I'm losing myself

Tell me all your stories
Tell me where you've been
Were all those thoughts just works of fiction
Do you feel lonely, misunderstood
I can feel it too, yeah it surrounds you
Give me every word, tell me where it hurts
Did you lose your Mother right after birth
A steady decline, I'll toss you a rope
But its up to you to try and not lose hope

Darling I love you
But you love your demons more than you could ever love me
