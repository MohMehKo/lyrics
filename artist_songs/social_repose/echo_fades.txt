I am not a mistake,
I'm just learning how to live.
I am not broken,
I'm just missing pieces to the whole
I did not break your heart,
But left a couple scars.
I don't feel numb,
But I can't feel you anymore!

Your body's warm, but there's no pulse
I can't feel you anymore!
You look alive, but all I see is a ghost.
(Two, three, four)

It would be nice, to disappear.
To find a quiet place away from here.
I heard your sound, since I drift away
The echo finally begins to fade.

Sometimes I feel worthless,
But there's no worth when you fall.
I did not give up,
But you can't expect rust to turn to gold
I will not lay down,
Yet here I am on my back.
I will always get up
Despite your weary sound!

If you throw me down, I'll take you with me.
Despite your weary sound!
You lie so well, but so do I.
(Two, three four)

It would be nice, to disappear.
To find a quiet place away from here.
I heard your sound, since I drift away
The echo finally begins to fade.

You're just a body with a mouth, you can't stop talking.
You're just a pair of legs,
You can't keep walking away.
Your skin is pretty thin for a girl that thinks she's shocking.
I see through you.

(I can't feel you.)
I pull you down, once again
Don't hold back; you can't pretend.
People age, we aren't the same
Self-destruction tried to suck the life out of me
And all this time, I swear to god, I've tried to flee.
Give me peace or leave me be.

It would be nice, to disappear.
To find a quiet place away from here.
I heard your sound, since I drift away
The echo finally begins to fade.

It would be nice, to disappear.
To find a quiet place away from here.
I heard your sound, since I drift away
The echo finally begins to fade.
