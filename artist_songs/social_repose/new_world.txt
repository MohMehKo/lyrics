I would have run to a whole new world
Where the sun casgades my face
And the tide keeps rolling in

To wash away the pains of growing old
Take my hand, we'll fall in love and start a new life in a whole new world
Where there is no pain, no fear, no regret just the sound of the sea singng you to sleep
Take my hand we'll fade into the night
Make our way to a whole new place and time
Give me your hand (your hand, your hand, your hand...)

I will run to a whole new world
Where the sun casgades my face
And the tide keeps rolling in to wash away the pains of growing old
Take my hand we'll fall in love
And start a new life in a whole new world
Where there is no pain, no fear, no regret just the sound of the sea singing you to sleep
Take my hand we'll fade into the night
Make our way to a whole new place in time
Give me your hand (your hand, your hand, your hand, your hand...)
