I feel it a lot
Everyday
In my head
You're here to stay
You breathe me in
I push you out
If you were silence
I'd scream and shout
You broke me apart
You broke me apart
And I won't forget
You broke me apart
And I won't forget
And maybe it was a dream I slept away
But I can't forget all the better days
Come back to me one more time
I swear that I'll make you mine
We were a beautiful disaster
Who couldn't fall in love faster
Come back to me
One more time
I swear that I'll make you mine
We were a beautiful disaster
Who couldn't fall in love faster
Pick me up
Off the ground
Ate my words
Didn't make a sound
You put my heart into your palms
This is where it belongs
Pick me up
Off the ground
Ate my words
Didn't make a sound
You put my heart into your palms
This is where it belongs
Forget
Come back to me
One more time
I swear that I'll make you mine
We were a beautiful disaster
Who couldn't fall in love faster
Fall in love faster
Come back to me
One more time
I swear that I'll make you mine
We were a beautiful disaster
Who couldn't fall in love faster
