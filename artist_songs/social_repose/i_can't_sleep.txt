5AM dawn breaks hands shake
I can't dream if I'm living in a sun filled tree house
Nicotine
A calming seam
A crutch makes me lean
I don't need to live
I just need more caffeine

The days grow short
The nights never end
I wake up I've missed the sun again
A spaded after thought
This means nothing if I can't remember what I've been taught

Everyday
feels the same
Every night
I feel no pain
Cause I can't sleep
(Cause I can't sleep)
The only time I feel alive
Is when I fall asleep
My body's cold 
The walls painted black
And I can't seem to sleep

The hours blend
My brain can't seem to send a signal to my body
Please just turn off
My anxiety
Won't leave me be
One more minute I'm about to be set free

The days grow short
The nights never end
I wake up I've missed the sun again
A spaded after thought
This means nothing if I can't remember what I've been taught

Everyday
feels the same
Every night
I feel no pain
Cause I can't sleep
(Cause I can't sleep)
The only time I feel alive
Is when I fall asleep
My body's cold 
The walls painted black
And I can't seem to sleep

The only time I feel alive
Is when I fall asleep
Everyday
feels the same
Every night
I feel no pain

Cause I can't sleep
(Cause I can't sleep)
The only time I feel alive
Is when I fall asleep
My body's cold 
The walls painted black
And I can't seem to sleep

Cause I can't sleep
