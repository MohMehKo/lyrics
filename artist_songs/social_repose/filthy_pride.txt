Heavy-handed
Rapid fire
Infatuation
With my filthy pride
To a senseless beating
Crippled and barely breathing
I tore off my skin
I'll hang from this noose
This is what happens when I show you my demons
Repeating the cycle that turns love into indifference
When I chase after affection, it won't chase after me
I get confused on why we always part so violently
But honestly
The day I met you
I started dying

Oh...
I should've known a little better
Good things never last forever
Oh...
My heart in repose
I need you the most
Oh...
Feed me to the wolves
Like I don't have a pulse
Oh...
'Cause the day you said "no"
I started dying

Pointless madness
I am clueless
Thoughtless choices
I ruin myself
Tear into me like an unknown disease
Give me your damage
I'm begging you, please
She said, "Depression isn't sadness,"
"It's a certain sense of apathy that hangs directly over me."
She'll wrap herself around my neck
I'm too numb to feel the entropy

Surrounding me
Because the day I met you
I started dying

Oh...
I should've known a little better
Good things never last forever
Oh...
My heart in repose
I need you the most
Oh...
Feed me to the wolves
Like I don't have a pulse
Oh...
'Cause the day you said "no"
I started dying

You make me happy...
You'll make me kill myself
I can be happy with you
But I can't be happy if I'm dead

Oh...
I should've known a little better
Good things never last forever
Oh...
My heart in repose
I need you the most
Oh...
Feed me to the wolves
Like I don't have a pulse
Oh...
'Cause the day you said "no"
I felt alive
