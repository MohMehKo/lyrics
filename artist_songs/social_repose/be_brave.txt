I keep on falling down
Trying to find my way back home
She doesn't love you

But you're, all that she's got
So be Brave
And hold on a little longer

And what's the point of living
When you've got nothing left to prove

And I ask myself
What's the point of living,
When you got nothing left to prove
When you got, nothing left to, prove
