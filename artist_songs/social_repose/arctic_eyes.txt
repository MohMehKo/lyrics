Eyes go arctic
Skin begins to harden
A shattered sense of worth quickly leaves the room
Splitting down end to end once again
Punching through the thick white noise
Yearning for a sign of relief
Semiautic love hides the wounds
That cannot be healed without a crutch

Just remember all love has a beginning
All love has an end
Once the room meets the horizon
You can never come back
Once you leave this story
Don't try to backtrack
Cause I meant every word that flows through my mouth
You wanted a way out
So whatcha crying about?

Holding onto that spark
Without it things get so dark
Impenatrable silence coats the walls
A lack of sound the bullet to end it all
Pleading pleas
Crying foul
A needless struggle
Simple solutions to endless problems
A gaze that could burn a hole in the sun
Whatever makes you feel like you've won

Just remember all love has a beginning
All love has an end
Once the room meets the horizon
You can never come back
Once you leave this story
Don't try to backtrack
Cause I meant every word that flows through my mouth
You wanted a way out
So whatcha crying about?

Years will pass
We will meet again
Different place, different time, we'll be different people.
