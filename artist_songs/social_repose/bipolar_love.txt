Heart palpitations a simple flicker into a spark
I'll fall down that hole if I can climb my way out
Deeper into the fold I can't turn back now
Playing the echo game to hear if you feel the same

Got a stranglehold on my heart
I'm sorry dear, I must depart
I can't stop my brain from loving you
And I can't help myself from...

Falling in and out of love over and over again
I can't explain what you do to me (it happens over and over again)
I can't seem to find a way out of this cycle
You come in as I leave, it happens over and over (Aye!)

You'll play my heart, I'll waste your time
You'll be begging me to try and rewind
We fight and make up, so in bipolar love
We kiss and breakup, don't worry I'll come back again

Got a stranglehold on my heart

Falling in and out of love over and over again
I can't explain what you do to me
I need to find myself a way out of this cycle
You come in as I leave

We kiss and breakup, don't worry I'll come back again
So, when I return... Will you be there as my friend?
Just like a magic trick... I made you disappear
