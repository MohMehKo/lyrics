What the hell did you think would happen?
When you moved out west and used that pen
To sign your name on the dotted line
And objectify who you've created

It's not that hard to have your name on
Hollywood boulevard
That's what you tell yourself
Cause that's what you want to hear
And you know you're gonna hear it

You're all used up now
Yeah, they hung you out to dry
You made your father cry
But let's be honest here
You don't care about that guy

It's not that hard to have your name on
Hollywood boulevard
That's what you tell yourself
Cause that's what you want to hear
And you know you're gonna hear it

So you think that you'll go far
Just by being who you are
That's what you tell yourself
That's what you want to hear

It was a simple distraction and you can't remember
The place where you came from
A fatal attraction
Your imagination caused over reaction
And now all you need is your home
But your old home was a house full of people that need you
And they were the ones that would never deceive you
But you took a chance and went out on your own
And now look at you
Look what you've done

It's not that hard to have your name on
Hollywood boulevard
That's what you tell yourself
But you're wrong

You're so
Wrrrrrrongggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg

It's not that hard to have your name on
Hollywood boulevard
That's what you tell yourself
Cause that's what you want to hear
And you know you're gonna hear it

Please come home
You won't be judged
Anymore
