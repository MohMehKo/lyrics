Hey there darling
You'll blink your life away
And he'll be waiting here wishing you had stayed
But if you stay here fearing the unknown
You'll regret not being alone

Hey there darling
You'll blink your life away
And he'll be waiting here wishing you had stayed
But if you stay here fearing the unknown
You'll regret not being alone

Travel far away, see the world and say
"Yes this is where I'd like to be"
Leave a note less than three

She'll pack up her things at the crack of dawn
All the road ahead goes on and on
Her father asks her
"Please don't go?"
But there are things past this place she would like to know

Hey there darling
You'll blink your life away
And he'll be waiting here wishing you had stayed
But if you stay here fearing the unknown
You'll regret not being alone

Travel far away, see the world and say
"Yes this is where I'd like to be"
Leave a note less than three

A sense of wonder kills her fear
Driving west to disappear
Her dreams grow brighter, they spark and burn
She will never return

Hey there darling
You'll blink your life away
And he'll be waiting here wishing you had stayed
But if you stay here fearing the unknown
You'll regret not being alone

Travel far away, see the world and say
"Yes this is where I'd like to be"
Leave a note less than three
