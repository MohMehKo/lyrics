Give me drugs to ease the pain
For I am week and full of distain 
Laying in this hospital bed
I may be week but I'm not nearly dead

And the truth is I don't have any legs to stand on 
And life can be bare when your health has come and gone

I will not wither away not here, not in this place 
No I won't 

Wither 

Wake me up once again
I reply with a why, not when 
Lift me up, I want to go
My brain say yes but my body says no

And the truth is I don't have any legs to stand on
And life can be bare when you health has come and gone

I will not wither away not here, not in this place
No I won't 

Wither

And the truth is I don't have any legs to stand on
And life can be bare when you health has come and gone
