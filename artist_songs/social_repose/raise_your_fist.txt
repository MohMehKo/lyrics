Burnt earth, shattered hearts
Hopeless desolation
Endless anticipation for reconciliation

Raise your fist hear the sound of the enemy
They want submission, we want a war
Senses fleeting
We won't be the ones repeating past lives
The world will hear our battle cries
March, march, march
We'll be dancing in the dark
Put your weapons in the air you have the wits to embark against a nameless villain lusting for destruction
You bring the moves and I'll bring the motion

So move

Drumroll of the shotguns feeling up your heartbeat
Backbeat of the shells keeping us in motion
Extension to the past we have the will to ignite this city
The world is ours

Senses are fleeting
We won't be the ones repeating past lives
The world will hear our battle cries
March to the far
We'll be dancing in the dark
Put your weapons in the air you have the wits to embark against a nameless villain lusting for disaster
You bring the moves and I'll bring the motion
So move
