I looked into your eyes and saw a stale blur
I remember when our concert was falling apart
What a shame, I had to break your shallow heart
But it pays to be the dark side of the ark
Even if I let you have those very last words-

(Words) [x8]

I remember when-
I always had something good to say
(Good to say)
But that's before I went and threw it all away
Because words are steep, and I am born
Someone say were lying on the bathroom floor

Call your mother, call your father
Cause' we might not make it out
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight might get a little messy
Call me a fake, I will call you a liar
Let's be friends if were not

I watched your face as to tell you the truth
I start to love you but, I'd rather hold on to my youth
The years will pass on by and you'll forget me

(Get me) [x8]
(Get-)

I remember when-
I always had something good to say
(Good to say)
But that's before I went and threw it all away
Because words are steep, and I am born
Someone say were lying on the bathroom floor

Girl, don't fall out back when the weight of the world's on your shoulders
I remember when you held a smile
Long enough to forget all your problems
Like an easy solution (easy solutions)
As wanted for me
Your bored, you bleed, my girl

I try so hard to forget-
(You)

Always had something good to say
But that's before I went and threw it all away
Because words are steep, and I am born
Someone say were lying on the bathroom floor
