Write me a letter
A face in the hall
Hiding from someone
Afraid of the fall

And she's waiting for someone (waiting for someone)
To take her back to where she came from
And she'll wait alone for hours (waiting all alone)
She won't mind because there's someone

In a story she remembers
She remembers in the letter
And the tears locked up inside her
Make her heart break open wider
Shuts her eyes and takes the picture from the wall
