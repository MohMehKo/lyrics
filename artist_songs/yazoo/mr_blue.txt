Winter sounds crying like an old man slowly dying
And the only sound, the wind that fills the trees
Even colder comes the moon
And though it never seems too soon
Sudden stillness as the rainfall starts to freeze

I'm Mr.Blue
I'm here to stay with you
And no matter what you do
When you're lonely, I'll be lonely too

I'm Mr.Blue
I'm here to stay with you
And no matter what you do
When you're lonely, I'll be lonely too

A young girl, she is shaded
Bears the scars that never faded
Of the baby that was born on Christmas day
While the heaven sing their song
A child's life is never long
'Cause the food supplies will only last a day

I'm Mr.Blue
I'm here to stay with you
And no matter what you do
When you're lonely, I'll be lonely too

I'm Mr.Blue
I'm here to stay with you
And no matter what you do
When you're lonely, I'll be lonely too

Patriot emotion is the cause of the commotion
After all there's really no one here to blame
Soldiers taking orders 'cause we must defend the borders
Of our nation and the other side's the same

I'm Mr.Blue
I'm here to stay with you
And no matter what you do
When you're lonely, I'll be lonely too

I'm Mr.Blue
I'm here to stay with you
And no matter what you do
When you're lonely, I'll be lonely too

I'll come to you at night
When all the world is sleeping tight
And lie beside you till the early morning dew
You can't hear me, you can't see
But you can feel me when you read
The folded letter she left addressed to you

I'm Mr.Blue
I'm here to stay with you
And no matter what you do
When you're lonely, I'll be lonely too

I'm Mr.Blue
I'm here to stay with you
And no matter what you do
When you're lonely, I'll be lonely too
