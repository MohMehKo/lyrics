You say it's time to leave
Now, babe, I can't believe
That you have the strenght to go now
I won't stand in your way
I'd be standing there all day
Ain't that something we both know now

You play your games, but the fact remains
I'm the only one that can hold your reins

[CHORUS]
Didn't I bring your love down?
Didn't I bring your love down all night?
Didn't I bring your love down?
Didn't I bring your love down all night?

If you think you need a change
Well, I'm sure we can arrange
For you to get on your own for a while
But I don't need to worry
'Cause you'll get back in a hurry
I know that you like my style

You play your games but the fact remains
I'm the only one that can hold your reins

[CHORUS]

You play your games but the fact remains
I'm the only one that can hold your reins

[CHORUS]

[CHORUS]

Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I
All night?
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I
All night?

[CHORUS]

Oh
Oh
Oh
All night
Oh
Oh
Oh
All night

(Didn't I bring your love down?)
(Didn't I bring your love down) all night?
(Didn't I bring your love down?)
(Didn't I bring your love down) all night?

Didn't I bring your love down?
Didn't I bring your love down?
Didn't I bring your love down?
Didn't I bring your love down?
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
All night
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
All night
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I
All night?
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I
All night?
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I
All night?
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I
All night?
