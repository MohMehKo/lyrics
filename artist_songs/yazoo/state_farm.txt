High & dried, tyre rubber starts burning 
Fill her up now before the table starts turning 
Souped up, jacked up, cracked up, stacked up 
Louie's got the gear 
And Charlie's got his back up 
And don't it make you feel good? 

Says she's a dirt box 
You're like a cannibal 
Somebody feeds her, sure ain't the State Farm 
Who buys the tickets and who buys the clothes 
Puts the liquor in her stomach and the powder up her nose 
Move. That's right 
And don't it make you feel good? 

Don't mind me honey 
I'm just looking 
Smelt your chicken 
And I watched you cooking 
Souped up, jacked up, cracked up, stacked up 
You're a bad stain 
And you need to be cleaned up 

And don't it make you feel good? 
And don't it make you feel good?
