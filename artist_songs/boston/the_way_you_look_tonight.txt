Look beyond the world you know
Maybe hope will come back your way
And I've heard a tree can grow
Out of the ashes of yesterday

I've been taken, I'm falling into the night
And your spell, I can't break it
It's calling me to your side, and
And everything's alright

Ooh, the way you look tonight
Ooh, the way you look tonight
Yeah, the way you look tonight

Once, we had a chance before
I remember like yesterday
But when you opened up your door
I couldn't find a word to say

What I'm feeling, I'm falling back into faith
In a world of believing, I thought it -
it might be too late, and
Oh, too late tonight, but, now everything's alright

Ooh, the way you look tonight
Ooh, the way you look tonight

You don't need to say anything at all
Believe in my love this time
I'll catch you when you fall
Yeah - hey

You blew me away, and like they say
I know the time is right
I waited so long, this can't be wrong
The way you look, the way you look tonight
