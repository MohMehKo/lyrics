Someday, when all the clouds are gone
Life could just roll along
If all the skies were clear
I would fly so far from here
But when there's nowhere else you can hide
You can not let them take your pride
Ooh, don't let their hate get inside, 'cause

I don't care what they could say
It's gone on for too long
It's just ain't fair when they act that way
Someday they'll see the right from wrong, ooh

This world, you wonder if no one's real
Survive on the love they steal
And life comes so easily
But it just seems so unfair to me
And then you get so outnumbered you fall
Well, maybe you just walked too tall, ooh But really, I don't think so, and

I don't care what they could say
It's gone on for too long
It's just ain't fair when they act this way
They can't see the right from wrong, ooh

Someday if all the clouds could go away
Someday if life could go on day to day

Stand for your hope in tomorrow
I'll be by your side all the way, yeah
Yeah, I'll stand by your side today

I don't care what they could say
It's gone on for too long
It's so unfair when they act that way
They're gonna see the right from wrong
