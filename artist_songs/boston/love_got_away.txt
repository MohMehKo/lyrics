Love in your mind is so real
I thought I knew, but in your eyes
It's so hard to find what's the deal
You wake up and realize

Love got away, got away from me ... oh
Love got away, got away from me, so

I thought I'd stop by on my way
I hope you don't mind
Can you tell me why, night and day
You're still on my mind?

[Chorus]

Hey, hey I need your love
Ooh, I don't know
if words are enough
This time,
I gotta get back in your love ... oh

Love is a journey night and day
Bringing me to you
And now I've got to hurry on my way
Is there anything I can do?

[Chorus]

Yeah, yeah
I need your love

Ooh, and,
I just wanna find my way, comin' back to you
You're here in my mind every day,
in everything you do, and
Your love is the power I obey,
every night and day, and
Livin' hour to hour, day by day,
for every word you say

Oh, I'm on my way, I hope you don't mind
Ooh, night and day, you're on my mind ... yeah
Ooh, on my way, I think of you
Ooh, night and day, is there anything I can do?
