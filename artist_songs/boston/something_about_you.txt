When I was younger I thought I could stand on my own
It wasn't easy, I stood like a man made of stone

But there was something about you
I want you to know
It brought a change over me
It's startin' to show
I've got this feelin' inside
gotta have ya, have ya, ain't no good to hide

It isn't easy
To show what I'm feeling inside, girl
It isn't easy
I know, when you believe in a man like me

When I get angry I say things I don't wanna say
I really mean it, I don't want to leave you this way

I couldn't help my reaction
I want you to know
I lose control over you
I just wantcha to know
Got this feeling inside
gotta have ya, have ya, ain't no good to hide

It isn't easy
To show what I'm feeling inside, girl
It isn't easy
I k now, when you believe in a man like me

But there was something about you
I want you to know
It brought a change over me
It's startin' to show
I got this feelin' inside, gotta have you, have you
Ain't no good to hide.

It isn't easy
To show what I'm feeling inside, girl
It isn't easy
I know, to believe in a man like me
Like me, can'tch see
I gotta gotta have you

But there was something about
Yeah there was something about you.
