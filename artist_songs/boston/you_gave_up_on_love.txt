You say love is all you need
So the story goes
There's no changin' what you believe
But you're the one who knows

You gave up on love
You gave up so easily
Guess you're not so tough
You gave up on everything love could be

Saw the way so long ago
Guess it was beyond us
You won't say but you still know
You just broke your promise

You gave up on love
You gave up so easily
Guess you're not so tough
You gave up on everything love could be

Hey, you run to me but it's just not enough
Hey, you couldn't see that you had to be
You had to be in love

You gave up on love
You gave up so easily
Guess you're not so tough
You gave up on everything love could be

You gave up on love, hey
You gave up on love
And you gave up on everything love could be
