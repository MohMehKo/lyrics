Can'tcha say you believe in me?
Can'tcha see what you mean to me?

Everyday I think of you,
You're on my mind.
Some things in the past
Are better left behind.
Every night I dream of you,
The images as clear as day.

Can'tcha say you believe in me?
Can'tcha say you believe in me?
You know that where there's a will there's a way.
Can'tcha say you believe in me?
Can't you see what it means to me?
Don't leave me alone tonight,
'Cause I still love you.

We've had our time apart
And I knew right from the start
I could never change
The way I feel about you baby.
We can sit here all night long
And separate the right from the wrong
But love won't wait.

Can'tcha say you believe in me?
Can'tcha say you believe in me?
You know that where there's a will there's a way.
Can'tcha say you believe in me?
Can't you see what it means to me?
Don't leave me alone tonight,
'Cause I still love you.

Ooohh, still in love with you
You know I need you baby, to stand by me.
Can't you see I need you, baby.
Oooh, I'm still in love with you.

Can'tcha say you believe in me?
Can'tcha say you believe in me?
You know that where there's a will there's a way.
Can'tcha say you believe in me?
Can't you see what you means to me?
Don't leave me alone tonight,
'Cause I still love you.

I love you
