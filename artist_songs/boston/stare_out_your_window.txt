She's downright into herself, it's so untrue
She's dolled right in so well, this can't be you
So come down, so come see
You don't want to wake and believe
You don't know, you don't dream
But somehow you make me so dizzy

I wanna stare out your window
You don't want to let me in
Let me in
I wanna stare out your window
You don't want to let me in
Let me in

She's calling out to her friends, just give me two
She words right under her breath, they don't want you
So come down, so come please
You don't want to make me believe
You don't know, do not tease
Somehow you make me so free

I wanna stare out your window
You don't want to let me in
Let me in
I wanna stare out your window
You don't want to let me in
Let me in

So come down, so come please
You don't want to make me believe
You don't know, do not tease
Somehow you make me so free

I wanna stare out your window
You don't want to let me in
Let me in
I wanna stare out your window
You don't want to let me in
Let me in
