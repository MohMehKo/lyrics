Dreams slipping away, just like sand in the tide
Like words you'll never say, it's so wrong, but feels so right

And now, lost in a dream I sail on your sea
Somehow in my fantasy I believe in dreams

We could settle down, wouldn't fool around
Wouldn't have a doubt if you were in love
If you'd feel the same, I'd do anything,
We could find a way, if you were in love with me
oh, oh, if you were in love with me

Hope, time after time, with my heart on my sleeve
And love will find me tonight, in my dreams when you leave

Oh I, I just dream about you, it brings me to my knees
I can't hide what I feel about you, I want to beg you, please

We could settle down, wouldn't fool around
Wouldn't have a doubt, if you were in love
If you'd feel the same, I'd do anything
We could find a way, if you were in love with me
Oh I, I dream about you

And now, I'm lost in a dream ... I sail on your sea
Somehow in my fantasy, I believe in dreams

Oh, oh if you were in love with me
Oh, oh, if you were in love with me

We could settle down, wouldn't fool around
Wouldn't have a doubt if you were in love with me
If you'd feel the same, I'd do anything,
We could find a way
If you were in love with me
