Ooohh, still in love with you
You know I need you baby, to stand by me.
Can't you see I need you, baby.
Oooh, I'm still in love with you.

Can'tcha say you believe in me?
Can'tcha say you believe in me?
You know that where there's a will there's a way.
Can'tcha say you believe in me?
Can't you see what you means to me?
Don't leave me alone tonight,
'Cause I still love you.

I love you
