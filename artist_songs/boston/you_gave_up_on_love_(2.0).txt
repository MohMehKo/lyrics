You gave up on love
You gave up so easily
You gave up on love

You say love is all you need,
so the story goes
There's no changin' what you believe
But you're the one who knows

You gave up on love,
You gave up so easily
Guess you're not so tough
You gave up on everything love could be

Saw the way so long ago,
Guess it was beyond us
And you won't say but you still know
You just broke your promise

You gave up on love,
You gave up so easily
Guess you're not so tough
You gave up on everything love could be

Hey, you run to me but it's just not enough
Hey, you couldn't see that you had to be
You had to be in love

You gave up on love, you gave up on everything
You gave up on love, you gave up on everything
You gave up on love, you gave up on everything

You gave up on love,
You gave up so easily
You gave up on love, hey,
You gave up so easily
You gave up on love
And you gave up on everything love could be
