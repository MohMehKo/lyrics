I stand on my own
And wonder if you've ever been alone
with all the world around you
Say the word; I'd be there
And like a fool I'd go anywhere
just like the day I found you

Tell me what you see
Tell me you believe in my love
Tell me what you need
Tell me you believe in my love

I don't understand what to say
You take my breath and then you walk away
Your life goes on without me

And you can look right at me
But in your eyes it's a mystery
What do you feel about me?

Tell me if it's real
Tell me what you feel in my love

Tell me what you see
Tell me you believe in my love

Tell me what to give
Tell me I can live for your love

Tell me not to leave
Tell me to believe in your love

I don't really know what to say
I don't know how but I could learn to pray
If praying makes you hear me

I could stay on my own
and wonder if I'd have ever known
I just want you near me

Tell me if it's real
Tell me what you feel in my love
Tell me what you need
Tell me you believe in my love
Tell what to give
Tell me how to live for your love

Tell me what you see
Tell me to believe in your love
