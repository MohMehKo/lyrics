Hey
I've got no place to be
And no one I'd rather see
I won't mind if you can find
The time to stay with me
Oh I've got no time for wastin'
Gotta live a life when I can
I won't hide if you decide
To let me be your man

When I get close to you, not much to say
I get that same old feeling I had in my younger days

And I can show you the way
It's just a game we play
It's easy, takin' it day by day

Hey
You know I would concede
And I think we both agree
You and I can testify
That love is what we need
Just take a look around you, livin' for the future is blind
I believe what we can achieve will soon be left behind

The things I try to say are so hard to find
If you doubt what your love is about it can ease you mind

And I can show you the way
It's just a game we play
It's easy, takin' it day by day

Hey
I've got no place to be
And no one I'd rather see
I won't mind if you find
That you're in love with me
Well we got no time to worry
Gotta live a life when I can
I won't hide if you decide
To let me be your man

And I can show you the way
It's just a game we play
It's easy, takin' it day by day
