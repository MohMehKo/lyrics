On my mind just one thing
You and me doing some things
No particular one place, oh no O-pen
Open to changes, positions, and angles
Tonight I ain't no angel, oh no

Boy what you waiting for?
It's open house why don't you take a tour
You got the keys so open up the door
Oh you all I need, boy I been lookin forward to you
I'll be waiting

I been thinking bout you
Can't get you off my mind
And if I gave it to you, boy could you love me right
But I won't have to wonder
If you just come on over

Boy could you drive me crazy
Take me for a ride
Would it be amazing
If I was yours tonight
But I won't have to wonder
If you just come on over

Sent me a message
He don't usually text me
Sayin he want me for breakfast, oh oh
Said if I can take it
We can make an arrangement
And I ain't have the strength to tell him no, no

Boy what you waiting for?
It's open house why don't you take a tour
You got the keys so open up the door
Oh you all I need, boy I been lookin forward to you
I'll be waiting

I been thinking bout you
Can't get you off my mind
And if I gave it to you, boy could you love me right
But I won't have to wonder
If you just come on over

Boy could you drive me crazy
Take me for a ride
Would it be amazing
If I was yours tonight
But I won't have to wonder
If you just come on over

Got my patience running out, oh yeah
I want you right here right now

I know what I want, oh yeah
