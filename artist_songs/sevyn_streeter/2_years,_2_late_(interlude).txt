[Sevyn:] I have a big heart, I love really hard. If I love you once, I love you forever. If my ex came back and really tried to have a conversation with me, and he's now begging me to have 30 minute conversations, when he had 2 years

By ignoring someone is the best way to get them back

Man that's the best way to hurt yourself

Once you respond, all that does is show them that you still care
