Tried to say you had less boy don't (do it)
If you say I'm on your mind (show it)
I just want you to (prove it)

'Cause I want you too, baby
You too, baby, want you too, baby
(I really, really, really, really want you too)

But now we know that I want you,
And you want me
But this ain't right I give no fucks.
Bout yo dough, I got my own, I got my own
Ever since I walked in caught your eye,
But now my life tryna find out if we could chill, if we could vibe when I got time

'Cause you loving how your
Girl get down on this shit
How I'm sounding right now on this shit
Got you thinking 'bout making part two
Swerving your legs
'Cause the ladies wanna hear
Me talk wild on this shit
So I'm a make 'em proud on this shit.
You think we only want
You for your money, and it's funny and that's why I came back top down

Swerving your legs.
