[Sevyn Streeter:]
I love when you pulling up in your jeep
Bumping all your beats
J's on with your shades on
Just to bring me something to eat
You the man up in these streets
But when it comes to my heart
That don't mean a thing no oh

[Chris Brown:]
Baby hop in my ride
Ooh it's hot as hell outside
Got the top down with the doors closed
With my hand upon your thigh

[Sevyn Streeter & Chris Brown:]
Drive slow ooh
Take your time

[Bridge - Sevyn Streeter & Chris Brown:]
Every little thing you do
Got me feeling some type of way
When you give me that thunder
You make my summer rain
(Oh-oh-oh-oh oh [x2])
Everyday everyday

[Hook - Sevyn Streeter & Chris Brown:]
And it won't stop, boom-boom, boo-oo-oo-oom
And it won't stop, (boom-boom, boom-boom) boo-oo-oo-oom
With every single part of me
My love for you is constantly
Forever and ever on repeat, on repeat
And it won't stop, (boom-boom, boom-boom) boo-oo-oo-oom

[Sevyn Streeter:]
I love when we pulling up to that beach
Sand down in my feet
Sun down, nobody round
That's one hell of a scene
You rocking my body
Rock rock the boat, Aaliy-ah
Don't it sound famil-iar

[Chris Brown:]
And you sound like: uh uh, aye aye
Looking up into spa-ace
It's just me and my ba-ae
And we feel so amazing

[Sevyn Streeter & Chris Brown:]
Oh oh oh ooooh, all night (woah)

[Bridge - Sevyn Streeter & Chris Brown:]
Every little thing you do
Got me feeling some type of way
When you give me that thunder
You make my summer rain
(Oh-oh-oh-oh oh [x2])
Everyday everyday

[Hook - Sevyn Streeter & Chris Brown:]
And it won't stop, boom-boom, boo-oo-oo-oom
And it won't stop, (boom-boom, boom-boom) boo-oo-oo-oom
With every single part of me
My love for you is constantly
Forever and ever on repeat, on repeat
And it won't stop, (boom-boom, boom-boom) boo-oo-oo-oom

[Sevyn Streeter & Chris Brown:]
Everyday, everyday, I can't wait
You take my breath away from me
Here's my heart, you got the key
Put that on eternity, I love you to infinity
Infinity, infinity, infinity, infinity
Now everyday, my everything
And when I think about it
Oh it be making me weak baby
I won't ever stop, my heart won't skip a beat baby
And little beat going on, going on, going on

[Hook - Sevyn Streeter & Chris Brown:]
And it won't stop, boom-boom, boo-oo-oo-oom (I'm so in love with you, girl)
And it won't stop, (boom-boom, boom-boom) boo-oo-oo-oom
With every single part of me
My love for you is constantly
Forever and ever on repeat, on repeat
And it won't stop, (boom-boom, boom-boom) boo-oo-oo-oom
And it won't stop

[Chris Brown:]
Said I'm rocking your body
Rock-rocking your body (won't stop)
Rock-rocking your body baby (won't stop)
Said I'm rocking your body
Rocking your body to sleep

[Sevyn Streeter:]
And it won't stop, boom-boom, boo-oo-oo-oom
And it won't stop, boom-boom, boom-boom, boo-oo-oo-oom
Yeah
