And I ain't with that sharing shit
I don't wanna know how she makes you feel,
Keep all that away from me, far away from me, far from me.

Whatever whatever whatever it is
It doesn't matter to me baby, I'm yours
You're still my baby to the core
Call me crazy crazy crazy crazy I'm yours
I ain't going nowhere, you're my life support,
Call me crazy crazy crazy crazy.
Call me crazy crazy crazy crazy.

Lock me up in your arms forever
And never set me free, no, free, throw away the key
Damn right I be on that obsessive shit

Whatever whatever whatever it is

Call me crazy crazy crazy crazy.

Whatever whatever whatever it is
It doesn't matter to me baby, I'm yours
You're still my baby, to the core
Call me crazy crazy crazy crazy I'm yours
I ain't going nowhere, you're my life support,
Call me crazy crazy crazy crazy. [x4]
