I-I'm saving all the love
I'm saving all the love for you (for you, I...)
I'm saving all the love
I'm saving all the love for you

Ridin' round town in your black Impala
With my baby, yeah, that's my partner
Look the other way when they tryna holla
So unbothered, we're so unbothered
See I got niggas slidin' in my DMs
Stevie Wonderin' if I'mma ever see 'em
But I don't pay that shit no mind
No, I don't pay that shit, no doubt, no doubt
I just curve 'em from the A.M. to the P.M
Oh, baby, you're the reason
That none of these niggas can touch me
Ain't none of these niggas that lucky
No, no, no, no, no

Only you, yeah, it's only you that get my attention
Only you, I swear it's only you, ain't no competition, no
'Cause, baby, you give me everything that I've been missin'
That's why I'm saving all my love for you

(I'm saving all my love...)
Yeah yeah, saving all my love
Saving all my love for you
(I'm saving all my love...)
Saving, saving all my love, I'm saving all my love for you
Give it to nobody else, you got it all to yourself
Just keep doin' what you doin', baby
And I'mma keep saving all my love for you
Saving all my love for you, saving all my love for you
(I-I'm saving all the love
I'm saving all the love for you)

Yeah, if I had a hundred I would break you off a fifty
Yeah, I know you'd do the same, I know you'd split it with me
Yeah, all ya team Michael Jordan Scottie Pippen
Long as we got each other, I ain't trippin'
You the one, you the realest, you the realest

Only you, yeah, it's only you that get my attention
Only you, I swear it's only you, ain't no competition, no
'Cause, baby, you give me everything that I've been missin'
That's why I'm saving all my love for you
