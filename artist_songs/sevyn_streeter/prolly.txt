(Sevyn, Gucci)
Prolly, prolly

Did I go too far tonight?
I don't know, prolly
Did I almost start a fight?
I don't know, prolly
Did I spend too much tonight?
I don't know, prolly
Are these niggas tryna fuck?
I don't know, prolly
Prolly, prolly, prolly, prolly, prolly

Snapchat be so lit yo, oh I
Feelin' bent like a limbo, oh my
Careless as a whisper,
Cup filled with liquor
He roll his swisher
She on me like Twista, oh
Prolly like that
Flirting with disaster, huh, you bout to cum fast
Hm, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Get it by my face I don't like that
I won't apologize for nothin'
I'm on the edge like a rectangle
Make you outta lines or some
Prolly, prolly

Did I go too far tonight?
I don't know, prolly
Did I almost start a fight?
I don't know, prolly
Are these niggas tryna fuck?
I don't know, prolly
Did I spend too much, did I?

[Gucci Mane:]
I'm in a 4 AAGTB, with my shooter right behind me in a SRT
AK's, AR's, 223's, I'd rather hear Free Gucci than RIP's
Neck full of stones, RIP to Pimp C
Drunk so many pints damn near OD'd
Now the feds, ATF, and the local police
Say I'm a career criminal, ACC
Party-party-party hard little nigga
I tear the club down then I shut them all down nigga
That's your girl? That's your word? I could prolly get her
We in Californ', then I'm prolly with her
Yeah you gettin' money but I'm prolly richer
Think Chanel Blue cause I'm prolly bitter
The way she think about it and the way I figure
Ain't no prolly, I'm that nigga

[Sevyn Streeter:]
Oh-ohh, did I go too far tonight?
I don't know, prolly
Oh-ohh, did I almost start a fight?
I don't know, prolly
Oh-ohh, are these niggas tryna fuck?
I don't know, prolly
Oh-ohh, did I spend too much? Did I spend too much?

Where my freaks at?
Where my freaks at?
I got one bottle, two bottles
Three bottles, plus one more
In the club now, work tomorrow
So I ain't even trynna go home right now
I'm already out of body
I'm already out of body
Don't blame me for my desire
When you find me, you'll find a good time
Prolly
