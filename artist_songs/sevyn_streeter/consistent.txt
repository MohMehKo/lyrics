At least he's consistent, oh well
It's like he plays a game of checkers with my heart
At least he's consistent, oh we-ell
And though I knew he was

He keep it coming like oh I, oh I

And though I knew he was (oh I, oh I)
At least he's consistent, oh well
It's like he plays a game of checkers with my heart (oh I, oh I)
At least he's consistent, oh we-ell
And though I knew he was
He keep it coming like
