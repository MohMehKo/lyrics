Fuck a mattress, being on the floor
Iâ€™mma need ya to do a little more yea oh

The shower is overrated
Baby I'm anticipating tonight
Here's what we gon' do

Turn the bed upside down, flip me round
Gravity's left the building
I'll be on top, really I'll be on the bottom
'Cause we gon' be having sex on the ceiling

Take me higher, take me higher boy
Switch it up one time, 180, drive me crazy
Baby we gon' have sex on the ceiling

I don't never ever wanna come down boy
I'mma have you standing up when I'm around boy
So whenever you get that feeling
Baby we gon' have sex on the ceiling

Nothing beneath us but the carpet
Maybe some furniture, let's get it started

Boy my body is orthopedic
Victoria, gave me the secret
And I've been saving it for you

Want you to take me up, up, up, up
I'm so tired of dropping it low
To the top don't stop, let's go

Turn the bed upside down, flip me round
Gravity's left the building
I'll be on top, really I'll be on the bottom
'Cause we gon' be having sex on the ceiling

Take me higher, take me higher boy
Switch it up one time,
180, drive me crazy
Baby we gon' have sex on the ceiling

I don't never ever wanna come down boy
I'mma have you standing up when I'm around boy
So whenever you get that feeling
Baby we gon' have sex on the ceiling

Want you to take me up, up, up, up
I'm so tired of dropping it low
To the top don't stop, let's go
Want you to take me up

Baby take me (up), little higher (up)
You can be my (up)... one desire
I'm so tired of dropping it low
To the top don't stop, let's go

Turn the bed upside down, flip me round
Gravity's left the building
I'll be on top, really I'll be on the bottom
'Cause we gon' be having sex on the ceiling

Take me higher, take me higher boy
Switch it up one time,
180, drive me crazy
Baby we gon' have sex on the ceiling

I don't never ever wanna come down boy
I'mma have you standing up when I'm around boy
So whenever you get that feeling
Baby we gon' have sex on the ceiling

Sex on the ceiling
Sex on the ceiling
