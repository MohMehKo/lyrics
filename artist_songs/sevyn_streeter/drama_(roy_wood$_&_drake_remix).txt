She got a little bit of drama with her friends [x7]

Yeah, no need to pretend
She got a little bit of drama with her friends
What a time it is to be young 
Oh, what a life to live only one
I can't feel my face let the party begin
Only bad bitches in my clique
Lookin like Pam & Gina times 10
You a 10, you a 10 Ima a plus 10
Why you in the club tryna fight wit ya man?
Drink in one hand, phone in the other hand
You do this every time we go out my nigga
But you know that is and oh no [x2]

Yeah, you so fuckin rude
You here wit yo crew
You killin the mood
Wit yo attitude
We tryna get loose
Drama is for you
Take that L, you lose [x2]

No need to pretend 
She got a little bit of drama with her friends [x7]

Every girl that I know has been in this position
Every girl that I know, know exactly how that shit be goin
That one friend, every time you up is always fighting with her nigga
He might as well came to the club cause it feel like he already with us

I just wanna pour some more, then I wanna pour some more

All your words are champagne showers high up like the Eiffel tower
You deserve much more than him, they should never fall for ours

You killin the mood
Wit yo attitude
We tryna get loose
Drama is for you
Take that L, you lose [x2]
