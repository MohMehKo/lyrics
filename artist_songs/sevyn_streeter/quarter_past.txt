[Emanny:]
I ain't doing nothing, but I'm sure you already are
It's late in the morning, so let me get my ass up off this couch
I know by 12 am you gon' be where the fun is
I'm gonna be out with my niggas doing the same shit
I can't stop thinkin' bout you in every position
So, when the lights come on get home to me
It's 3 am

And bring your body here here here
Making love on the way upstairs stairs stairs
Let's call in the night right here here
Inside these sheets, let the time and the roles play
It's a quarter past three

[Sevyn:]
Would you say three was too many?
I love you, let me love you (past three)
Three words when you come to mind
It's all yours
Just meet me at the door, and work our way to the bed
That's If we make it, we got time, to take it
And every girl that wanna have you tonight
I'ma put it on you boy
And the ladies they wished they had a nigga like you in they life
Cause everytime every morning I be thinking
Thinking bout all night, all night, oh-oh
I heard your voice inside my head saying to me
So, when the lights come on come home to me
It's 3 am

Come bring your body here
Love on the way upstairs
Let's call in the night right here
Inside these sheets, let the time and the roles play
It's a quarter past three (three)

[Both:]
I ain't in this club for loving, no no
You know I ain't leaving with nothing, no no
You can't get no better
Me and you together
So, how when both get in, you know what it is

You bring your body here here here
Making love on the way upstairs stairs stairs
Let's call in the night right here
Inside these sheets, let the time and the roles play
It's a quarter past three (three)

Would you say three was too many?
I love you (let me love you past)
I love you
I love you
Every minute brings you closer to me
It's a quarter past three
