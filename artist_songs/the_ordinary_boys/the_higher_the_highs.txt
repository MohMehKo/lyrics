Will you still love me when its all over?
Will you still love me when no one does?
Will you still need me when no one needs me?
Will you still want me when I'm all washed up?

What did I ever do to deserve you?
Oh, what have I done?

[Chorus:]
The higher the highs, well the harder the fall
The faster the rat race, the slower the call
I know it's all lies, but just tell me some more
The higher the highs, well the harder the fall

I will be waiting when fate is frowning
I will be here when all the money's spent
Not only the frantic can be romantic
Will you still want me, oh just say yes

When fate comes to claim back the common
Please say you'll stay?

[Chorus:]
The higher the highs, well the harder the fall
The faster the rat race, the slower the call
I know it's all lies, but just tell me some more
The higher the highs, well the harder the fall

What did I ever do to deserve you?
Oh, what have I done?

[Chorus x2:]
Well, the higher the highs, well the harder the fall
The faster the rat race, the slower the call
I know it's all lies, but just tell me some more
Oh, the higher the highs, well the harder the fall
