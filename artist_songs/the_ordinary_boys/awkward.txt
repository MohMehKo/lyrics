I, was only joking
I, shouldn't have talked to you that way
I thought it might be funny
Didn't really know what I should say

I had to fill the silence
How come the jokes always on me?

Now, you're barely talking
Your body language says it all
I'm in the bad books
I didn't think this through at all

By god, you're mad at me
That I had to write this song to say

That I'm awkward
Sometimes out of order
Now It's hopeless
Cause I can't keep my mouth shut

I'm floored
So please be patient
And tell me something I don't know

You're giving me one last warning
Still got a long long way to

By god, you're mad at me
That I had to write this song to say

That I'm awkward
Sometimes out of order
Now It's hopeless
Cause I can't keep my mouth shut

My heart's in the right place
My heart's in the right place
My heart's in the right place

I'm awkward
Sometimes out of order
Now It's hopeless
Cause I can't keep my mouth shut

I'm awkward
Sometimes out of order
Now It's hopeless
Cause I can't keep my mouth shut

But my heart's in the right place
My heart's in the right place
My heart's in the right place
