No gun shooting for rudi tonight
No retributing, everything is alright
Rudi the message is very clear
I can see by the stars above
Rudi, Rudi's in love

You can stay at home while the other rude boys go to shanty town
You'll be havin fun while the other rude boys are still messin round
With that lovely girl that has made you turn from your retributing ways
Rudi, Rudi's in love

When the other rude boys see how happy you are
There be no messin 'round
And when the other rude boys see how happy you are
There'll be no body left in shanty town

No gun shooting for rudi tonight
No retributing, everything is alright
Rudi the message is very clear
I can see by the stars above
Rudi, Rudi's in love
Rudi, Rudi's in love
Rudi, Rudi's in love
Rudi, Rudi's in love
