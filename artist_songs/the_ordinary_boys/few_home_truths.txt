When it's sunny it rains
When it rains it pours
But I can't remember what I came here for
But when I see the look
That's in your eyes
I bit my tongue and it's lie upon lie
We're all so sex obsessed
We're so straight and clean
But I just wanna stay in and watch TV
Watching people do
What I'm to scared to try
I steal their lives with lie upon lie

It's my secret life in the bus lane
It's much easier just to complain
Making life much harder than it has to be

I've been working overtime
I've been busy telling lies
A few home truths never break the ice
Don't you trust me?

When I get stale, my dear
Your time will come
I'll be the best boy to ever treat you wrong
I'll give you reels and reels
How I'm confused and floored
Baby, baby I just got bored

And I'll unload my soul
My theory is tried and true
You hang on words I only wish I knew
We all fill our minds
With data ready made
Just trying to rattles somebody else's cage

It's my secret life in the bus lane
It's much easier just to complain
Making life much harder than it has to be

I've been working overtime
I've been busy telling lies
A few home truths never break the ice
Don't you trust me?

I've been working overtime
I've been busy telling lies
A few home truths never break the ice
Don't you trust me?

I've got a plan and its going well
I might pull it off you can never tell
A few home truths send me straight to hell
Don't you trust me?
