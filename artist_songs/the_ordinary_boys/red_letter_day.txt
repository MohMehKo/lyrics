You like to buy, and buy the best
Its not been that long since you were penniless
So you flaunt your success
You spend on yourself and you spend on finesse
And the ones who felt your wrath, need constant reminders your not going back

You invest in the profane
Your license plate reads like a mundane campaign
and you collect and obtain, your porcelain figures are rare and hand-made
But those who're in your way can be rest assured they'll be you one day

Just throw it all away, review your fate and seize the day
You'll throw it all away, it never mattered anyway
This red letter day is bigger than you'll ever be so
Throw it all away, seize the day

You let us know you made the grade
All your Italian suits are tailor made
You obsess on the well paid
One of these days deeper needs will invade
We throw it all away
Well the flames they can bite as you live for the day

Just throw it all away, review your fate and seize the day
You'll throw it all away, it never mattered anyway
This red letter day is bigger than you'll ever be so
Throw it all away, seize the day
