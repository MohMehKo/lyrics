Yeah maybe I'm right,
Or maybe I'm wrong,
We can fight for one single way to get along,
And we've all got to not shake down,
And I'm only missing the point,
And I guess that's the way I'm trying to generalize.

So I told my problems,
You're never going to get me,
If I'm too busy.
A social conscience,
Well I saw it on the TV,
At least it keeps me busy.

Oh maybe sometimes I find it hard to comply,
With people that don't look you in the eye,
And it's because of the commercial breakdown.

And I'm only missing the point,
It's what the media say and then expect your head to turn away.

So I told my problems,
You're never going to get me,
If I'm too busy.
A social conscience,
Well I saw it on the TV,
At least it keeps me busy.
Well am I right?

And I used to think that these things happen for a reason,
I used to think that these things happen for a reason....
