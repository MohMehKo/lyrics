Whilst we float on this molten sea
We wear our colours so heroically
Were only living in GMT
Everyone else is just a refugee

Ah I wake up, I'll take up
It's about time for a shake up
When pride is blind you know were only stuck in second gear
So wrap up; never give up
It's about time to deliver
Without the man who drives you [?]
You know I'm staying in

Were on an island in the sea
Were on and island we never leave
Were on an island in the sea
Were on and island we never leave

Well we feel subsequent resent
And overseas we like to represent
Cause nothing but embarrassment
We had nothing but our good intent

Ah I wake up, I'll take up
It's about time for a shake up
I'm talking loud; that doesn't mean you can't be understood
So â€¦ up; never give up
It's about time to deliver
I think it's about time we got to meet the neighborhood

Were on an island in the sea
Were on and island we never leave
Were on an island in the sea
Were on and island we never leave

Were on an island in the sea
Were on and island we never leave
Were on an island in the sea
Were on and island we never leave
