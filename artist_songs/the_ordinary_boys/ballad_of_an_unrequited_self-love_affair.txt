It's such a complicated situation
it always ends up in a fight
what I wouldn't give for some isolation 
but I'm gonna stay with me tonight

I catch my gaze across the bedroom
we only need some time alone
lost in a haze of self indulgence 
oh what's indulgence on your own?

it's an unrequited self love affair and it's not fair
I need to be there for myself but I'm not there

I am a danger to myself, let alone anyone else
I am a danger to myself, oh oh oh

I've such a needless need for vindication
I've gotta show myself you see
if only for stealing all the covers 
and for taking advantage of me

I like to tell myself "I love you" 
even if from behind grinding teeth
sometimes I'm sure I half believe it
am I getting the better of me

it's an unrequited self love affair and it's not fair 
I need to be there for my self but I'm not there

I am a danger to myself let alone anyone else 
I am a danger to my self oh oh oh

it's an unrequited self love affair and it's not fair
I need to be there for myself but I'm not there
