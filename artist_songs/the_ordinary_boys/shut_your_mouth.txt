It's that old dirty feeling
That just will not come clean
Like eating digestives
After brushing your teeth

And it's staining your fingers
And it's under your nails
It's eating you insides
Is it shame? Is it guilt?

You can't just run away
Run a thousand miles a day
'Cause you've been burning the candle at one end again
No you can't just run away
Run a thousand miles a day
Oh come on
Shut your mouth and open your eyes

It's that soaring sensation
That you choose to ignore
When you swear that it's over
Ah you just want it more

And the memories take journeys
And the past seems so full
But the photos you flick throgh

Seem so achingly dull

No you can't just run away
Run a thousand miles a day
'Cause you've been burning the candle at one end again
No you can't just run away
Run a thousand miles a day
Oh come on
Shut your mouth and open your eyes

You can't just run away
Run a thousand miles a day
'Cause you've been burning the candle at one end again
No you can't just run away
Run a thousand miles a day
Oh come on
Shut your mouth and open your eyes

Shut you mouth and
Open your eyes
Shut you mouth and
Open your eyes
Shut you mouth and
Open your eyes
Oh come on
Shut your mouth
