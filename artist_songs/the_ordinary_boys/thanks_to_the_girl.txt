In at the deep end again my friend,
You'll get water up your nose again,
But is it harder to swim clasped hand in hand,
Is it harder to stand for a madder man?

In at the deep end again my friend,
Still feeling sorre from a dirty weekend,
Has it been so long since we did nothing?
we do it so well oh they're off the coffee,

Thanks to the girl,
NO really THANKS!
You stole our boy,
And spat him back!

Is that what your hoping for?
A kitchenette on the eleventh floor,
And i don't mind,
Your not around but im doing fine,
I'm alright,
You said we'd be tight to the bitter end,
Girls come and go but what about friends?

Is it good fun staring at well gromed hands?
Your cheapy cab spending cash in hand,
They're hard to scare, the gang of one,
Are you showing off to yourself again?

In at the deep end again my friend,
still feeling sore from the dirty weekend,
Girls can get whatever they want, and the girl wants you,
