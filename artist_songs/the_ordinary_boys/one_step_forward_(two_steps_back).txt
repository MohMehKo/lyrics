You slouch in smoky corners of this town
Fake sentiments follow you around
You drop jokes like they're dragging you down

You cling onto a vintage way of life
Don't accept that it should be left behind
Pitiful puns like a constant rewind

And this can't be your somewhat fair
Just pointing out what isn't there

Ah one step forward, two steps back
Punch lines like a heart attack
Your tolerance will never crack
So its one step forward, two steps back

It's odd what people will laugh at sometimes
If they feel that it's rude to draw the line
When they feel that they have to incline

But the underlying hatred stuck inside
Primitive bias and the pride
You drop jokes and we kick them aside

And this can't be your somewhat fair
Just pointing out what isn't there

Ah one step forward, two steps back
Punch lines like a heart attack
Your tolerance will never crack
So its one step forward, two steps back

And this can't be your somewhat fair
Just pointing out what isn't there

Ah one step forward, two steps back
Punch lines like a heart attack
Your tolerance will never crack
So its one step forward

Ah one step forward, two steps back
Punch lines like a heart attack
Your tolerance will never crack
So its one step forward, two steps back
