Hey men have died trying to obtain this valuable information you know,
But I will give it to you for free

Are we moving on to mediocre things?
I don't want to sit and wait to find out what the new year brings
Until the days I had nothing to lose
Nothing ventured, nothing gained
I'll turn up everything to you

If I could close my eyes and wish it all away
Cause I don't have the strength to make you stay

Love is a four letter word
Swear like you mean it
Swear like you mean it
Because the more you say it, the more it hurts
Love is a four letter word

I'm outnumbered when I'm next to you
If I remember not to be myself
Maybe we'll pull through
Cause honesty always got me nowhere
Promises are there to break
So never promise that you care

If I could close my eyes and wish it all away
because I don't have the strength to make you stay

Love is a four letter word
Swear like you mean it
Swear like you mean it
And as your leaving the more it hurts
Love is a four letter word

When I say I'll always love you
Its not a promise its a threat
And when you say you're mine forever well
[?]

Love is a four letter word
Swear like you mean it
Swear like you mean it
The louder that you shout it
The less its heard
Love is a four letter word
Love is a four letter word
