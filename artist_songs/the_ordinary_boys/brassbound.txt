Waiting for the right words to say
But I won't find them anyway
To let you know my true intentions
wo wo woah
You must know what you state is wrong
You let it carry on and on
It's too late to talk about prevention

Too brassbound to talk about it
‘Cos you don't care
But I'm all ears
And you're not going anywhere

Moderate to satisfy your mood
You're wrapped up on being rude
You're only coming for reaction
wo wo woah
This held high above the crowd
Hold it firm hold it proud
You found your human interaction

Too brassbound to talk about it
‘Cos you don't care
But I'm all ears
And you're not going anywhere

Think for a minute
Maybe a minute or two
And if your hearts still in it
Then it will hit you

Think for a minute
Maybe a minute or two
And if your hearts still in it
Then it will hit you

Too brassbound to talk about it
‘Cos you don't care
But I'm all ears
And you're not going anywhere

But I'm all ears
And you're not going anywhere
But I'm all ears
And you're not going anywhere

Think for a minute
Maybe a minute or two
Think for a minute
Maybe a minute or two
