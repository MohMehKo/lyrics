Eat Drink and be miserable
While it's a miracle that we're still here at all
As we sink another belly-full
Another cherryfalls bouncin' off the wall
If we live in the dead of night
Then it's a constant fight to be a socialite
Back tides through darkened rooms
With a look of gloom we'll never leave too soon
We're so scared of finding out
What scares us and we're growing up
And knowing what it means
To be bursting at the seams
Souled up and fueled up to our ears
To leave our fears behind
We all know that that just cannot last
Don't live too fast...

Smoke, joke and be unrestrained
And when the sun comes up we're gonna feel your pain
As we piss it all down the drain
For another week of a tired campaign
We're so interchangable
When you've seen one well you've seen us all
But that is just the way we like to be
In trouble but trouble-free

We're so scared of finding out
What scares us and we're growing up
And knowing what it means
To be bursting at the seams
Souled up and fueled up to our ears
To leave our fears behind
We all know that that just cannot last
Don't live too fast...

We're so scared of finding out
What scares us and we're growing up
And knowing what it means
To be bursting at the seams
Souled up and fueled up to our ears
To leave our fears behind
We all know that that just cannot last
Don't live too fast...
