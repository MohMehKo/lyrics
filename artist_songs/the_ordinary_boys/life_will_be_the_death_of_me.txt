Well it is our birth right to be discontented
Don't tell us that the world is lemon scented
You say you've had it much harder
Tell me exactly how

No it doesn't have to be so complicated
Not every little thing has become outdated
But we don't have to leave our chair
To go anywhere

Life will be the death of me
Sitting in between four walls
Life will be the death of me
There's no reason to leave at all

We just don't need this weighty pressure
I'm sure you must think it's for the better
But listen kids whatever it is
I'm sure it's no big deal

So let's try to look from a wider angle
And please let's not fly off the handle
I know I can ensure you that
We haven't partied hard enough

Life will be the death of me
Sitting in between four walls
Life will be the death of me
There's no reason to leave at all

Life will be the death of me
Sitting in between four walls
Life will be the death of me
There's no reason to leave at all

Life will be the death of me

Life will be the death of me
Sitting in between four walls
Life will be the death of me
There's no reason to leave at all

Life will be the death of me
Sitting in between four walls
Life will be the death of me
There's no reason to leave at all
