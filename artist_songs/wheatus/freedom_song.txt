(dah, dah, dance with me)
(ooh, ooooho [x4])
I am cold I am old I am poor on the floor with the door slamming in my face
watching all of my love erased, brother I will always wonder why
You were right I was wrong I could never get along with the stars in your outer space
Watching all of the light erased, brother I will always wonder why.
you can blame your whole damn life on me and then run away so easily
If you turn and look then you will see what may come as a surprise. 
You’ll see me dancing me around in circles coz your hurt will never ever work on me
That’s because this is a freedom song and I don’t care where it all went wrong, its all about getting away from you just like I always wanted to
Its not enough that I paid your price, you’re gonna need me to make everything alright, aren’t you?
Well my brother that’s something I can’t do. (ooh, oohoo)
I am poor I am old I am cold on the floor you’re out the door staying at someone else’s place
I’m watching all of our love erased, lover I will always wonder why
you were right I was wrong I could never get along with the stars in your inner space
Watching all of our love erased, lover I will always wonder why.
You can blame this whole damn thing on me.
Run away with someone new you meet. Know that he’ll be all I could never be. 
Oh then why does it make you cry to see me dancing round in circles 
coz your hurt will never ever work on me.
that’s because this is a freedom song
and I don’t care where it all went wrong
its all about getting away from you, just like I always wanted to
Its not enough that I paid your price, you’re gonna need me to make everything alright. 
Aren’t you?
Well now lover that’s something that I can’t do.
I know I said it’s a freedom song, but now I think that I got it wrong. 
Its not about getting away from you, not like I always wanted to. 
And now I know that I paid the price coz I won’t need you to make everything alright. 
And I know that it’s just something that you can’t do.
