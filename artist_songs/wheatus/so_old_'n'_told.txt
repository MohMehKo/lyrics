When I was a boy there was some terrible shit that went down. 
But still I hung around, to see if it would get better.
And when I was a lad, well I was lonely and I was sad. 
But still I hung around, to see if it would get better.
And when I was the boss, well there was so many things that I lost. 
But still I hung around, to see if I could win.
But I’m getting so tired of this contest, who comes out on top man I couldn’t care less.
This smile you see I can do coz I practiced and I ain’t ever gonna check this sadness.
You trust truth bare witness.
This shit is old, my angers been in control since like forever, on my eleventh year.
And what they stole, man I can never be whole not I ever, not even when I am no longer here.
So I built a wall, I built it sturdy and I built it tall. You cannot get around. 
It’s covered all in big graffiti.
That nothing can erase. Coz it’s a permanent mark of disgrace that I will always feel whenever I look in a mirror.
You know I tried to hide, I tried to cover it all up inside. 
But it still it comes around. Still it comes around.
I can never be normal unless I fake it, you say that you can but I know you can’t take it.
This song might be long but on truth it’s a statement that I ain’t gonna ever shake the memory of that basement. Trust.
This shit is old, my angers been in control since like forever, on my eleventh year.
And what they stole, man I can never be whole not I ever, not even when I am no longer here.
And in the night-time, imaginations breed deadly violence, inflicted my friends.
Carry my brother, I think I’d rather, you had it better, write my own letter, found by my mother read it to no one in the end.
But when I dream I dream of paradise, one where I live somebody else’s life.
Why can’t I live somebody else’s life?
Before this fear was here I was alright.
Before this fear was here I was alright.
Before they led me down the stairs.
