This is a story about a friend of mine
He is abnormally intelligent
He could bust a phatty rhyme, even when he got up in the blunt
But that all changed when the girl who he lives with came to town
He let here take him away from me so I had to ask him how
That's when he said, "She takes advantage of me! She takes advantage of me! 
She takes advantage of me! She takes advantage of me! 
She even knows when I pee! I think eventually she'll make a meal out of me."

[Chorus]
Because her love is a mutt from hell that I can't live without
Your love is a mutt from hell that I can't live without
One of these days I swear I'm gonna get out
'Til then your love is a mutt from hell that I can't live without.

That's why I'm talking to you now.

Sarah lives with Bradley now, I guess that is how she wants her shit
He needed a place to stay, so it's of mutual benefit
I stopped by on my way to Pomona yesterday
She sat down and spilled her guts to me
That's when I thought she would tell me she's gay
Instead she said, "He takes advantage of me! He takes advantage of me! 
He takes advantage of me! He takes advantage of me! 
He even knows when I pee! I think eventually he'll make a meal out of me."

[Chorus]

That's why I'm talking to you now;
Talking to; That's why I'm talking to,
That's why I'm talking to.
Talking to; That's why I'm talking to,
That's why I'm talking, talking, talking to you NOW!

Because, your love is a mutt from hell that I can't live without.
