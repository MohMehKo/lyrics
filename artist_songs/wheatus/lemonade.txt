Just tell me his name,
Just tell me you didn't get laid in our bedroom.
And was it the same?
Just tell me if his dick is bigger than mine.
Do you remember the way it was when I was home,
Before I left you all alone.

I wanna be eighty on the porch drinking lemonade with you
And its all that I can think about
Since you told me that you cheated
Eighty on the porch drinking lemonade with you
And its all that I can think about
When you told me that you cheated on me

I knew that you would
I knew cos ya told me IT RUNS IN YOUR family.
And I did the same
So I guess that I deserve half of the blame
Do you remember the way it was for us
Before all of the blow jobs on the bus

And its all that I can think about
When you told me that you cheated
Eighty on the porch drinking lemonade with you
And its all that I can think about
When you told me that you cheated
Told me that you cheated on me

What should I care about the long run
What should it matter to me?
I always knew I'd end up with no one
And now I know the end is here
Cause you've replaced me

Just tell me his name
Just tell me you didn't get laid in our bedroom
Just tell me his name
Just tell me if his dick is bigger than mine
Just tell me his name
Just tell me you didn't get laid in our bedroom
Just tell me his name
Just tell me you didn't get laid in our bedroom
