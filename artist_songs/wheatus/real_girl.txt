It has been a while
Since I have met a real girl
Since I have met somebody who I wanted to tell
All my secrets to

And I was never perfect
I don't think I ever will be
But I will try to fix myself and stay here
Just in case you come along

And all of these perfect, dancing, soul-mate lovers
How did they ever find each other?
Will I know that when I know you know me?

So the day when I die
I can die with a smile
If I know that I was everything you needed
Real girl

I had a dream that you were spinning
High above the city
I watched you from the darkness of the suburbs
In the far unlit unknown

And I was just a kid then
But you were a superhero
Too smart for all the villains in their emerald towers
Gunning for your soul

You were the perfect colour
Bright green lady
When they hear this they'll know I'm crazy
But all that I am crazy for is you

And the day when I die
I can die with a smile
If I know that I was everything you needed
Real girl

And all of the mistakes I made
They write the dreams that sometimes fade
Before I wake up to this life
That I was sure would have no wife in it
Unless you came along
In the miracle you prove me wrong
And we become unstuck in time
The universe would be all yours and mine

But it has been a while
Since I have met a real girl
Since I have met somebody who I wanted to tell
All my secrets to
