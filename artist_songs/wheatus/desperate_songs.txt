I know I'm a little erratic and sometimes my chickens are chasing my rabbits 
Do you think you can stand it? I don't have the right to stand here and demand it 

And just like you the paranoia keeps me up at night so late but 

If you believe in desperate songs, I promise that one day I'll learn how to write them 
And then you and me can be free, as long as we learn all our desperate songs 

I know I'm a little bit spastic, but I build my castles with paper and plastic 
You don't look like you can stand it, but when I'm done you'll say superfantastic 

And just like you the softest earthquakes shake me out of bed at midnight 

And if you believe in desperate songs, I promise that one day I'll learn how to write them 
And then you and me can be free, as long as we learn all our desperate songs 

Do you remember the panic 
That you and I felt when the small was gigantic 

And just like you the heavy metal keeps me up at night so late but 

If you believe in desperate songs, I promise that one day I'll learn how to write them 
And then you and me can be free, as long as we learn all our desperate songs
