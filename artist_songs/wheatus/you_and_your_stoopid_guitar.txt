They said lets go to the show,
Can't wait to see them I love that video.
Lets catch the opening band.
Matt said the singers this girl with long red hair
But when she started to play
Thats when he got in her way.
And he was not Brian May.

and I kept trying to hear her
Cause I thought maybe she'd have something to say
But you kept runniing her over
Chasing the fucking spotlight 'round the stage
Oh you think you're so ill
and you're all up in my grill
You and your stoopid guitar.

Ever since I was a kid
Wanted to play on a six string like they did
And join a travelling band
Could have conquered the world with my left hand
And I then I'd sit back and swing
So that the singer could sing
Cause that was always her thing.

But I'm still trying to hear her
Cause I thought maybe she'd have something to say
And you're still running her over
Chasing that fucking spotlight round the stage
Oh you think you're so ill
And you're all up in my grill
You and your stoopid guitar

I'd say nobody plays it like they used to
Just saying no body plays it quite as bad as I do
Not saying nobody plays me like they used too, boo hoo.
Nobody plays, no body plays-ays-ays-ays...
