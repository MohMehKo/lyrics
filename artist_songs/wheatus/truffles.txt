You, you think yer such a bad ass
You think yer such a rough neck
Well I saw you outside eating truffles with yer mom on the patio
I think it's really sad though and tell yer girl ta quit buggin' me
'Cause I saw her outside suckin' dick 
In the bathroom of the bus of the Iron Maiden cover band;

[Chorus]
When your pencil neck breaks, when your bird chest caves in . . .
I'm gonna win
When your pencil neck breaks, when your bird chest caves in . . . 
I'm gonna win

Me, I'm just another gringo, a bitter jalepeno
But I gets more montequilla in a week than your bitch ass gets in a lifetime
You're steppin' on a land mine
Your gonna shoot yer eye out
I'm thinkin' what in the Sam Ham Hill is goin' on wit yer moms in the clogs and the skirt
Wouldn't fuck'er for my country with a flag on her face and a stolen dick.

[Chorus]
You, you think yer still a bad ass,
You think your still a rough neck
Well let's take this outside
