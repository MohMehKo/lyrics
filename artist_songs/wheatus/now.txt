Now we are all strangers in the TV Lands
Now we are all stranded on our own island.
None of us can fit inside the paradigm, anymore.

Now even the darkness can be stolen,
Now we are a bumper sticker slogan.
Now I'm gonna have to learn it all, again.

Now is not a time for making future plans
Now is not a place where you and I can stand.
Now is not the time to try to tell the truth.

Now we are a lie inside the cameras eyes
Now we have a hundred thousand reasons why
But none of us are ever gonna get it right.

Now I have to live with what we might have been.
Now that everything we know is wearing thin.
Now I'm gonna have to find a way, to leave.

Now even the darkness can be stolen,
Now we are a bumper sticker slogan.
Now I'm gonna have to learn it all, again.

Now is not a time for making future plans.
Now is not a place where you and I will stand.
Now is not the time to try to tell the truth.
