When I look at your face I see dirt; 
All the sunshine you blow up my a** starts to hurt; 
And I don't really mind if I'm nothin' in your eyes; 
It's no surprise to me; 
There's a rocket I built; 
It's under my kilt; 
It's coming to blow you away. 

I was a jerk; 
I did the work for somebody else's dream; 
I took the chance; 
I lost my pants; 
In somebody else's dream tonight.

Now you're calling me up to get paid; 
And if you don't get paid then you'll never get laid; 
But I really don't have any money; 
I say goodbye; And you'll have to depend on your size; 
'Cause the thing that I built;
It's under my kilt;
It's coming to blow you away.

I was a jerk; 
I did the work for somebody else's dream; 
I took the chance; 
I lost my pants; 
In somebody else's dream tonight.

Now I think that I'm going to bed, 
As the image of you and yer crap leaves my head; 
Cause it's t-minus 20 tomorrow, rocket flies; 
And it doesn't depend on the size; 
'Cause the thing that I built;
It's under my kilt; 
It's coming to blow you away.

I was a jerk; 
I did the work for somebody else's dream; 
I took the chance; 
I lost my pants; 
In somebody else's dream tonight
