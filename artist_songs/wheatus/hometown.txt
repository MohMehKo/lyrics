I'd trade all my sunshine, for twin towers to hide behind 
and find you there 
And I left on that sunday 
To come home on a tuesday 
Well I never 
I never thought I'd have to stay and watch the world explode 

And I swear it was beautiful before they sent those airplanes 
And I thought I would show them to you just like my dad did 

Home town come tumbling down 

When she came on that sunday 
I took her home the long way 
So she could see 

And she asked when they made it 
And would they ever change it 
I said no way 
Half of what you see and none of what you hear believe 

And I told her I that they remind me of Motown, sixties, skinny ties, 
What they thought the future looked like where the Jetsons lived. 

Home town come tumbling down 

So we sat down and we cried 
And we ran to the front line 
And some came home 

And I stay off the expressway 
Nothing to see there anyway 
That view sucks now 

But there was a time the Brooklyn traffic couldn't get me down 

I swear it was beautiful I hope they build it tall again 
Til then your imagination is all that you will have
