She's a pretty girl
She doesn't know it's over
She doesn't know that my plane leaves tomorrow
She's ringing in my ear
She redefines the night call
Hang up the phone again turn off the ringer

Heaven only knows what she wants from me
But I won't wait around enough to see

Cuz I'm running away from your arms tonight
And she won't let me go without a fight
I can honestly say right now
You don't understand me
You don't understand me

So we fight again
And the night turns into sunrise
I know getting up for work will be a hell hole
She's like the mission man
She's screaming about Jesus
And maybe when I'm deaf then she can save me.

Heaven only knows what she wants from me
But I won't wait around enough to see

Cuz I'm running away from your arms tonight
And she won't let me go without a fight
I can honestly say right now
You don't understand me
You don't understand me

Now she wants to know
If I ever really loved her
If I ever meant that shit about a wedding
I said that months ago
I can't believe that she remembers
And now the secret's out that I'm a jackass
And now the secret's out
And now the secret's out
And now the secret's out
And now the secret's out
And now the secret's out
And now the secret's out
And now the secret's out
And now the secret's out
Oooh. Oooooh. Oooooohoooo. Oooohhoooyeah.
