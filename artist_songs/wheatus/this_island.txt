I met the King of England once but the guys in the deli back home they don't believe me. 
I ride my bike all around round my home town where nobody knows me. 

And I think that the problem is mine they I should take 
And take a more positive line on the situation when solutions are staring me right in the 
Face it we've run out of time 
But if you do what I say everything will be fine 
Well 

No thanks I'd rather sit here and die on this island 
Can't you see I need this to end and be dead.

I had a dream about a song. It was so strong. 
It made all the rights wrong 
I tried to write it all down. Capture the sound. 
You won't believe what I found. 

But the good turned to bad,
sad and mad when I played it it sounded like more like a fad
that had lasted a little too long than it had and I realized that this was as good as it got.
There's no snowballs in hell cause it's too fuckin hot so 

No thanks I'd rather sit here and die on this island 
Can't you see I need this to end and be dead.

Yeah I thought that I knew who I was what did I know 
off nothing or all the above I did I mention 
those hip new ideas I got from you last week 
they sucked all the life out of life in a heartbeat 
and ripped mine right out of my chest aand the kids saw right through but you already knew that was true since 
you tried it the 1st time in 1989 when 
you were the one in my shoes and some asshole 
like you told you what you should do when you do what 
you do and you had to do it like he wanted you to 
have you learned how to live with regret yet 

I can't keep these these things in my head 
If I turn out like you I will wish I was dead
