When the summer comes we'll get on our aeroplanes and go back to where we came from. 

Summertime 

It's a surprise. But I think I'll survive. 

When this is done we can have our loved ones back just in time the the new hijack. 

Blue and black 

It's a fact. It's the act we act in side. 

Oh god how good would it be if you trusted me and I believed in you? 
Oh god what good could we do? No happy ending tune. 

When the summer comes we can burn our penguin clothes and go home 
where no one knows us. 

Sunnyside 

It's a sign....shinny like a dime. 

When this is done we can die a thousand times all alone and unrecognized. 

Summertime 

Never mind. Oh I hate to say good bye. 

But oh god how good would it be if you trusted me and I believed in you?
Oh god what good would it do?
If I believed in you.
If I believed in you.
But this is a no happy ending tune. 

Oh god how good would it be if you trusted me and I believed in you? 
Oh god what good could we do?
If you trusted me and I believed in you.
Oh god what good would it do?
If I believed in you.
If I believed in you. If I believed in you.
If I believed in you.
If I believed in you. If I believed in you. 

But this is a no happy ending tune
