I had a dream, about the devil today
He had on one of your t-shirts
And what does it mean
When you say
I don’t think its gonna work.
You didn’t have to go and leave me lonely 
when you could have just left me alone.
He had a house in the dream
It was shallow and small
We had to live in it sideways
And inside was a scene
There was blood on the walls
There was a murder with board games
And if its only a dream
I’m inside
How come it feels like I’m awake?
Why did you have to go and leave me lonely 
when you could have just left me alone?
I tell you the truth about it, I know why you did it, 
what for, and I don’t really have dreams
anymore. Not since you walked out that door.
There’s no need to fight about it, know what you needed me for. 
Something new for the poor
And now you walk out my door.
Tell you the truth about it, know what you did it for. 
I don’t have dreams anymore. Not since you walked out that door.
