I don't get to see you that often
Here we are again and it's Christmas time 
When you flirt you are relentless... how I love to be defenseless
Yeah once again you corner me... once again I do believe

That I'd never write a song about you
All the same I play your game till your boyfriend looks over
No, I'd never write a song about you
'Cause it shows I think he knows, that you're taking me over again

Roll it back again to the beginning
You're all up in my grill and it's Halloween
You think you're cute without your costume
And you caught me in the front room
You said you don't like my attitude
I bet your boyfriend thinks it's rude

And I'd never write a song about you
All the same I play your game till your boyfriend looks over
No, I'd never write a song about you
'Cause it shows I think he knows, that you're taking me over again

You don't seem to like my new girlfriend
So now it's not the same 'cause I won't play your game
And you say it doesn't matter... but your hold on me is shattered
Once again your corner me... once again I do believe

I'd never write (never write) a song about you [x4] 

'Cause I'd never write a song about you
All the same you play your game till your boyfriend looks over
No I'd never write a song about you
Cos it shows I think he knows, that you're taking me over again
