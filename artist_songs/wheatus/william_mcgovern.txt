Here we are
Trying to locate the rainbow stream
There I go over and under again
He thinks he knows where I am without seeing me
And there I stand in the shadow
He casts behind and I am ready holding the net he will need
[?]flies start to rise again

This is the story about William McGovern
He lives undercover
Come rise
Come fall
He doesn't know it yet I feel the pain
[?] we never speak cause he'd run away
And I think he's a little like me

Hey father, sing me a song about rock n' roll
I remember Led Zeppelin 2 in your living room
And I need to be what you would be if you were free
There I stand in the spotlight in your imagination
Brother, holding the rhythm I'll need
To keep nightmares from haunting him 

This is the story about William McGovern
He lives undercover
Come rise
Come fall
He doesn't know it yet I feel the pain
[?] we never speak cause he'd run away
And I think he's a little like me
I think he's a little like me
I think he's a little like me

Hey father
Only the names have been changed...

Hey father, sing me a song about rock n' roll
