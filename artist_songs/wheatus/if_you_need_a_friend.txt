None of the people I know seem to be sleeping well at night
Everyone's diagnosed with some kind of nervousness or fright
Where did the peaceful dreams of our childhood go?

None of the people I know seem to be living their own lives.
Everyone's under control, trapped in a cubicle to die
Where did the glory dreams of our childhood go?

you know you sound crazy when you're screaming til you're bleedin'
and it may sound like its not true, I've done that to believe it
and if you should need it

If you need a friend, don't be afraid to call me up again
Up again, up again, up again, up again.

Part of the gardner estate, was a concert made of paint
Ours to behold we were told, ten million times it weight in gold
Out her museum one night concert did go.

I had a painting I loved, red graffiti on black gloss
It was lost in the travels we made, back in our homes we should have stayed.
Up on the internet auctioning block it did go.

I know it sounds crazy, but these colours make our feelings
When these things are stolen, it is worse than crime, it's killing
And if God is willing.

When you need a friend, you won't have anyone to call you up again
Up again, up again, up again. up again.

It's the middle of the night, and everythings alright.
I'll go to bed alone again
Yeah everythings alright, but the dim street light, is flooding in the room again.
And empty spaces that are next to me are a little freer than I care to be.
It's still the middle of the night, yeah everythings alright.
I'll go to bed alone again.
It's free, a little freerer than I care to be.

If you need a friend, don't be afraid to call me up again
If you need a friend, don't be afraid to call me up again
If you need a friend, don't be afraid to call me up again
If you need a friend, don't be afraid to call me up again, up again.

If you need a friend, don't be afraid to call me up again
If you need a friend, don't be afraid to call me up again
If you need a friend, don't be afraid to call me up again, up again.

If you need a friend, don't be afraid to call me up again
If you need a friend, don't be afraid to call me up again, up again

If you need a friend, don't be afraid to call me up again
If you need a friend, don't be afraid to call me up again
If you need a friend, don't be afraid to call me up again, up again, up again, up again.
