Bumping around in the back
In the dark I see people
Huddled around the girl
She is the one in the back of the bar with a photo
Of Nixon and Mary-Jane

I am the one in the back of the bar with my hat on
I'm chillin with Mary-Jane
She is a chick who knew Dick
And she kicks to me old school
Like she gonna have a cow

It's alright it's alright it's alright it's alrite
When we're huddled around the girl
It's alright it's alright it's alrite it's alri-i-ite
When we're huddled aroud the girl

You had a hold on me but just for a while
And I finally found out
What it is that she's all about
You had a hold on me but just for a while
And I finally found out what it is
That she's all about

Fuck the Police coming straight for my underwear
Young brother got it bad, 'cause it's brown

You had a hold on me but just for a while
And I finally found out
What it is that she's all about
You had a hold on me but just for a while
And I finally found out what it is
That she's all about
And I finally found out what it is
That she's all about
And I finally found out what it is
That she's all about
