Cough up the rent Mr. Kent
And don't try to blame it on the government
Your wife is a clown she's in town, she gets with some other guy
Are you gonna finish your fat? 
Cause I'd like to give it to my kitty cat
The big fat look is coming back. 
You skinny people are screwed. 
And I know you're right
Yeah I know it's time.

[Chorus]
Here we go again another humpem dumpem situation
Here we go again another humpem dumpem situation
Here we go again, here we go again
Now I know what you're like and I don't think I like it.

The newspaper says to get bent;
Man I'd like to say that to the President
He got the L. in the House, I guess he already did
She looks like she finished here fat
She then turned around and ate my kitty cat
She coughed up a hair ball or two and laughed her way to the bank
And I know it's right
Yeah, I know it's time.

[Chorus]

Here we go again.
