We met at Amys party
I stick with Chuck cause he brings me luck, Chuck whats up
With the girl over there, with the hair, she likes you.

You're not from around here, you come from a place where stars at night
are big and bight, you're light, it blinds me.

Put me on a plane. I am not afraid.
Just don't tell me, that you're leaving.

Take me back to Texas with you.
Take me back to Texas with you.
Take me back to Texas with you, girl.

I think I missed the last train,
If I could just sleep here on the floor, 
I promise I will will expect more.
This reminds me of high school
Or maybe what high school would have been,
If you were there and I were cooler.

Put me on the plane, I am not ashamed.
Just don't tell me that you're leaving.

Take me back to Texas with you.
Take me back to Texas with you.
Take me back to Texas with you, girl. Girl.

Put me on a plane. I am not afraid.
Just don't tell me that, you're leaving.

Take me back to Texas with you.
Take me back to Texas with you.
Take me back to Texas with you, girl.

Take me back to Texas with you.
Take me back to Texas with you.
Take me back to Texas with you, girl.
