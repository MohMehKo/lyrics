She stands on the deck hear,
To watch all the landslides,
She's waiting for myrtle,
Can't wait 'til she drives by,
She's focused on football,
Making her plants grow,
You'd think he'd have noticed,
Become what she needs,

Not today, not today,
She says go away,
Go away, go away,
She says keep it all inside,
Not today, not today,
She says go away,
Go away, go away,
She says keep it all inside,

I'll marry a nice man,
And move out to Northport,
And sell my camero,
To live in a white house,
And have my twa corbies,
And make up some cut lips,
I'll live in a white house,
I am Susie Brown,

Not today, not today,
She says go away,
Go away, go away,
She says keep it all inside,
Not today, not today,
She says go away,
Go away, go away,
She says keep it all inside,
Nahoohoo, nahoohoo,
Nahoohoo, nahoohoo,

Now I'm not a DJ,
I play one in real life,
You've heard all my records,
The hits cut like steak knives,
Role out the red carpet,
Like leaves through the winter,
Now I'm not a DJ,
I'd sure like to be,

Not today, not today,
She says go away,
Go away, go away,
She says keep it all inside,
Not today, not today,
She says go away,
Go away, go away,
She says keep it all inside,
Nahoohoo, nahoohoo,
Nahoohoo, nahoohoo,
Nahoohoo, nahoohoo,
Nahoohoo, nahoohoo.
