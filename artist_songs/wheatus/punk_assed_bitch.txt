She wriggles and she wraggles, she jiggles and she jaggles
You stand and watch her pass by, your line of vision ass-eye
You think that cause she smiles, that you turn all her dials
But you don't see them later, while in the elevator
You nag her and you swagger, you think you're gonna shag her
A man about the town-a, get funky, let's get down-a, machismo and machasma, it turns into miamsa
But you have got no class, no style, no social skills, no comprehension

[Chorus]
I can't deal with this idiot, yeah I must admit that he's a punk ass bitch

You open up your mouth-a, amazed at what comes out-a Its just a testimony
That you're full of bologna, that you're a stupid shit-ass, a meathead, guido, pass-gas
That you have got no class, no style, no social skills, no comprehension

[Repeat Chorus 2X]

You know you want to spangle, but you can't seem to angle
One gives you attitude-a, your reason to be rude-a
You think that cause she smiles, that you turn all her dials
But you don't see them later, while in the elevator
You nag her and you swagger, you think you're gonna shag her
A man about the town-a, get funky, let's get down-a, machismo and machasma, it turns into miamsa
You have got no class, no style, no social skills, no comprehension 
You open up your mouth-a, amazed at what comes out-a 
It's just a testimony, that you're full of bologna,
that you're a stupid shit-ass, a meathead, guido, pass gas
But you have got no class, no style, no social skills, no comprehension

[Repeat Chorus 2x]
