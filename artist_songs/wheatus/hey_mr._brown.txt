Man I think it's just a little sleazy
You said you was like butter but you're cheesy
To treat me like I'm spinner bait you can't wait, go fish off some other dock.

[Chorus]
Hey, Mr. Brown, don't have a cow.
Just compensate me!
Hey, Mr. Brown, don't have a cow.
Just compensate me!
Hey, Mr. Brown, don't have a cow.
Just compensate me! You're gonna have to prove it to me.

If I don't call you back your head spins
If I told you what I think you'd shit your linens
"It's just another interview, nothing new" 
But they don't even know my name.

[Chorus]
