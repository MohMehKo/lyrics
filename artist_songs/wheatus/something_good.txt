Cocaine eyes 
Been livin the lie 
Looks like another big night on the credit card babay 

Buttchew makin' em smile 
Yeah you drivin' 'em wild

I'm droppin' rhyms to suit the times 
Buttchou don't hear me though 
And I could be just what you need and you would never know. 
You're way to busy playin' DJ on the stereo ..eo 
But you don't spin it like I feel it no 

The center of my mind is a dark place that wishes it wouldn't do what it would 
Do what it would 
And every mistake that ever made is sayin' I didn't do what I should 
Do what he should 
And if you wanna see me smilin' yer gonna hafta 
Do something you never would 
Do somethin' you never would 
Play somethin' good 

The bigger the size

To make the company smile 

You just sit back and let em do all the talkin' now don't cha

Sign for your life and they will get you on the radio 
Check out the line around the block and say I told you so..eo
