Pornography!

I pretend i cant hang up the phone
Cos if i do then he gets you
And ill be in this room alone
Staring at the carpet
Wondering how they made it
And you would i should not be afraid
Im better off alone and free
Cos no-one can put up with me
And your mom don't like me either
Now I don't have to meet her

You and me
We end up in catastrophe
But i have got one more thing to add
OK so im a jerk
And im a weirdo
And even if im lucky ill amount to zero 
But i thought that you'd love me anyway
I'm so not even worth it
But baby no-ones perfect
Yeah, I thought that you'd love me anyway,
Anyway

You're not the type of girl who takes advice
Still all that shit your parents said 
Still bouncing round inside your head
"You two will never make it
If you build it he will break it"

You and me
They sum us up so poignantly
But i have got one more thing to add
OK so im a jerk
And im a weirdo
And even if im lucky ill amount to zero
But i thought that you'd love me anyway
I'm so not even worth it
But baby no-ones perfect 
Yeah, I thought that you'd love me anyway,
Anyway

Maybe youll never play the guitar
Maybe youll never sing in harmony with me
Maybe you cant rock the ac/dc
Well hell still aint a bad place to be when your with me
Anyway

OK so im a jerk
And im a weirdo
And even if im luckly ill amount to zero 
But i thought that you'd love me anyway
I'm so not even worth it 
But baby no-ones perfect
Yeah, I thought that you'd love me anyway...
Anyway

And the end goes like this
