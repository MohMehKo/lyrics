Cock back, lock and load 
I got my aim, I'm ready to go 
I hit the target
Right where her heart is 
I'm a killer, love killer, love killer

The way she move like Shakira 
Clock's ticking, there's no time to give up
Had one, two shots of tequila 
Thanks for a good time I feel ya 
The way she move like Shakira 
In and out of love I'm a killer 
Killer, killer, killer, killer, killer

Now tell me do you like it, you like it  
Tell me how you want it, you want it
Tell me do you like it, you like it
Tell me how you want it, you want it

Tell me do you like it, you like it
Tell me how you want it, you want it
Tell me do you like it, you like it
Tell me how you want it, you want it 
Killer, killer, killer, killer
Killer, killer, killer, killer

In another magazines, load up 
What you saying to me Hun? Hold up 
Ya keep saying there's no man above me 
Do I love her, but she love me 
Silence, I never start lying 
You fuck the night in the car till she start coming 
Set a man who get gassed of a girl
But say the wrong thing then the wrong chicks start coming 

The way she move like Shakira 
Clock's ticking, there's no time to give up
Had one, two shots of tequila 
Thanks for a good time I feel ya 
The way she move like Shakira 
In and out of love I'm a killer 
Killer, killer, killer, killer, killer

Now tell me do you like it, you like it  
Tell me how you want it, you want it
Tell me do you like it, you like it
Tell me how you want it, you want it

Go set me free
I'm something like a killer, killer, killer 
Go let me free 
Killer, killer, killer, killer
