My words watch over me
How much sleep does a human need
We'll take shifts and keep looking out
There's not a sound
Time keeps marching on again
And on again, and on again

You speak words so well
Let me lick my wounds in peace
That's all I need
A home that I'll never know

And I'll always bite
Bite off the hand that's feeding me
I muzzle myself, I'm choking to death
And I miss my hell
And I'll always be a part of it
A part of it

My words watch over me
How much havoc can one human wreak
Cast my net far and wide
Amongst all the debris, its always you I find
And every time
A home that I'll never know

And I'll always bite
Bite off the hand that's feeding me
I muzzle myself, I'm choking to death
And I miss my hell
And I'll always be a part of it

When push comes to shove
And I can step up
And I'm here to prove
That I'll always be a part of it
And I'll never kneel, and I'll never quit
I'll always be feared
And I'll always be a part of it
And I'm going to stand
I'll keep on fighting, I'll keep my place
And I'll never swear
On keeping a promise I can't deliver
