[?] run as fast as your lungs go
Multiply slower than the slowest worm
Spread myself like candle [?]
In spite the fear of letting go

And you ricochet
Where are my manners?
As you spill and swing
I'm keeping the peace

My name resonates for less than yours
Your name ripples when the edge of lakes
Spread yourself like fireworks
In spite of fear of only living once, you let go

And you ricochet
Where are my manners?
As you spill and swing
I'm keeping the peace
[x2]

As you ricochet
And you bash and you bruise
A look back is enough to ensure
I follow you

And you ricochet
Where are my manners?
As you spill and swing
I'm keeping the peace

And you ricochet
Where are my manners?
As you spill and swing
