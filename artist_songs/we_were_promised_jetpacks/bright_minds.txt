There was a hand that I couldn't shake,
A black silverware of a slithering snake,
It was never enough, enough is enough,
Trying to keep the pieces like maintaining a buzz

There was a cloud that wouldn't break [?]
Talking all sullenly I was kept in the dark
I could never survive, I could never relax
If you could cut detention there was explaining to haves

There was a calm that preceded the storm
A [?] position and I'm raising alarm
It was never enough, enough is enough,
I'm hanging in awareness when they're causing a fuzz

There was a code that I couldn't break
It's getting more frustrating for me each passing day
I could never survive, I could never relax
Imagine my elation when it's finally out

Bright minds think alike
The fools minds they knock their heads
It's all pretense

There was a song that was more than [?]
We should have stopped together but we've crumbled apart
It was never enough, enough is enough,
I'm steady [?]
How can [?], the room
Bored loneliness trumpered [?] and I'm [?] the mood
I could never survive, I could never relax
I've got to keep my axe before I [?] attack

There was a hand that I couldn't shake,
A black silverware of a slithering snake,
It was never enough, enough is enough,
Trying to keep the pieces like maintaining a buzz

Doorman forget all doors
Shelter as [?]

Bright minds think alike
The fools minds they knock their heads
It's all pretense
It's a buffer
