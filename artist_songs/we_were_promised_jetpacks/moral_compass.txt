Watch out, summer's gone
My condolences
Reach out, I know right from wrong
My moral compass says
"Stand up, shake it off"
That's all I've got
Surprise yourself, jack-in-the-box
Spring coil

Shaking head to toe
The adrenaline still flows
I'm terrified you'll leave
Come put my mind at ease

You've been young and you've had your fun
It's a slippery slope that we slide along
Leeches come and suck my blood
Rid me of all the bugs I've caught

Terrified you'll leave
Come put my mind at ease
Watch out summer's gone
Reach out, I know right from wrong
Stand up and shake it off
You know I want to get what I've got
Leeches come and suck my blood
Take out all the bugs I've caught
Light up like it's your parade and you must learn you're to celebrate
Watch out, summer's gone
Reach out, I know right from wrong
Stand up and shake it off
Surprise yourself, jack-in-the-box

No recourse, no alternative
No regrets and no accidents
Shaking head to toe
No recourse, and no try agains
Adrenaline still flows
I'm terrified you'll leave
Just put my mind at ease
