Just a come back
Another come back
Far too orchestrated
Far too Calculated

A conductor
Just a conductor
Pointin' at me
and hearin' me speak

'Cause I'm a conductor
A simple conductor
The electricity just
Pouring through me

You're a habit
Another bad habit
Keep biting my nails in case
All else fails for us

'Cause you are a fine wine
Another fine, fine wine
Pointin' at me
And hearin' me speak

You're a conductor
A simple conductor
The electricity just
Pouring through me

Like electricity
Pouring through me

Like electricity
Pouring through me

Like electricity
Pouring through me

Like electricity
Pouring through me
