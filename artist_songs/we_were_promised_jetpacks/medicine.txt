I have torn through the pages of the years I have wasted
And I've stolen all my stories, that I've copied and pasted
Is this about me now? Still about me now
I fought in an army that only fights boredom
And I've caught all my allies who were only there in peacetime
Is this about me now? Still about me now
I've ignored all the warnings and the constant reminders
And I've read the instructions, well I'll never guess
Is this about me now? Still about me now

Bring me back to life
I've stumbled and staggered too many times 
Bring me back to life
Too stupid and stubborn to put up a fight.

I have torn through the pages of the years I have wasted
Then I've stolen all my stories and I've run out of patience
Is about me now? Still about me now
Give me my medicine my spoon and my bottle
And you can't blame a chancer so beat me to an anvil
And let me sleep it off, let me sleep it off

Bring me back to life
I've stumbled and staggered too many times
Bring me back to life
Too stupid and stubborn to put up a fight

Can't resist, I'm a little out of practice
I'm carved in cement, to hold off the darkness
The thoughts to think illuminate my brain

Bring me back to life
I've stumbled and staggered too many times
Bring me back to life
I've stumbled and staggered too many times

Waitin' for the fight, I'll gamble with my spine
I'm ready for the fight, to toughen up my spine.
