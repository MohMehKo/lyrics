I've been walking in circles and squares,
in circles again
Kept chasing my tail
it would help if I knew where it ends

Life in a coma
could be quite fun
And I could play architect 
and nobody's son

Where are we going
its still warm outside
I'll open those curtains
straight in my spine

And I've been walking in circles and squares,
in circles again
Kept chasing my tail
it would help if I knew where it ends

I followed that dark horse
to see where he'd go
Straight through the forest
and out on to the road 

And where are we going
its still warm outside
I crept through the front door
and into the night

Where are we going 
its still warm outside
I'll open those curtains
straight in my spine

Its a dark light 
when you're always staying inside
Its a dark light
when you're always staying inside

So why should I stop laughing?
Holding your microscope
You can see my whole world
I don't know where I go...

So why should I stop laughing?
Holding your telescope
You can see my whole world
I don't know where I go...

So why should I stop laughing?
Holding your microscope
You can see my whole world
I don't know where I go...

You can see my whole world
I don't know where I go...
