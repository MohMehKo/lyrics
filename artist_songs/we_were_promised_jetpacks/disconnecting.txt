White noise
Filled my head
I stay stern
I lost track of
My sense of time

My perception
Of what's important
Has been changed
I'm connecting
All my dots
That I misplaced

Wild fate
You've maintained
You're half the [?]
That you used to be
Wildfire
You keep spreading
Further than I expected you
Wild flower
You've blossomed
I never planned on planting you
White dove
You're more peaceful
[?]
Anyone could be
Sweetheart
You've fallen right into my lap
[?]
I'm selfish and [?]
You're selfless
Take all my pain
And crush it and smoke it
[?] maze
Right time
Right face
Right time
