There was a time when I wasn't evenly spread
There was a shadow of doubt
I crossed all my fingers
My arms and my legs
Now I'm hiding behind
And I'm wandering fast
To a wonderous past

There was a time
When I wasn't brave
Something about those planets
Just didn't align

And I was a number
I wasn't even or odd
And I felt somewhere inbetween

I looked up above and my number comes off
And my bubble it burst
With the clouds that disperse that I didn't make

Wintered, withered, and worn out now
I'm leaving behind
I'm wandering fast
To a wonderous past

There was a time
When I wasn't brave
Something about those planets
Just didn't align

You were the wallflower
That grew in my house
The safety in numbers is something
That you've never allowed

It's my pain
It's my pain
It's my pain

There was a time
When I wasn't brave
Something about those planets
Just didn't align

You were the wallflower
That grew in my house
The safety in numbers is something
That you've never allowed
