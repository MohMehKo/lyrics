I’m forever leaving the party
Making excuses and waking up early
At times I just catch myself in the mirror
Repeating the phrase “Just keep it together”
You break through and appear out of nowhere
We go back, we go forth but we’ll all pass forever
Now I have no more fear of darkness
Until someone’s finger is over the light switch
I pretend I am slowly easing the pressure
But I’m always acutely aware of the danger
Right on the cusp and the next step is crucial
The night gone to hear the sound of you breathing
Now I have no more fear of the darkness
Until someone’s finger is over the light switch

I keep it composed
I keep it so poised
I keep it together
Keeping the ship
From sinking the treasure
Pull us apart
Tear us apart
Then bring us together
Put up with pain, to stick with the pleasure

I keep it composed
I keep it so poised
I keep it together by
Keeping the ship
From sinking the treasure
You drew us apart
You tear us apart
Then bring us together
I’m filled up with pain, I’m filled up with pain, I’m filled up with

And I have no more fear of the darkness
And I have no more fear of the darkness
And I have no more fear of the darkness
Until someones finger is over the light switch
