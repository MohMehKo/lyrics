When peace was breached and barefoot I ease
My curiosity has gotten the best of me

Can't catch a hold of my breath
Sleeping in my pillow sweat
So paralyzed and fighting
I suffer in silence
Face first in my pillow sweat
Trying to catch a hold of my breath
I'm in limbo
I'm hallucinating

My nerve is mute
Feels like I'm crying out
You've disappeared
In set of panicked fear

I can't catch a hold of my breath
Sleeping in my pillow sweat
So we'll stalling and violent
And either and silent
Sleeping in my pillow sweat
I can't catch a hold of my breath
I'm in limbo
I'm hallucinating
I'm in limbo
Hallucinating
