He died alone.
He died on impact.
And all this talk of death,
Has really brightened up my week.
And the smell of sweat,
Really helps me sleep.

We act alone.
We act on impulse.
And all this talk of death,
Has really brightened up my week.
And the smell of sweat,
Really helps me sleep.

He died alone.

We act alone.
We act on impulse.
We act alone.
We act on impulse.
We act alone.
