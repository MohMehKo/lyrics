It's you and me
I've been working on my peace sign
I've been working like a dog all day
I've been walking over egg shells
I've been slipping on the yokes as well
Sing it back to me
There's letters on the pavement
I find it hard to breathe

Come sit with me
I've been thinking about your bee stings
I've been thinking about my bad night out
I've been fucking up the punch lines
Forgetting all my jokes as well
Sing it back to me
There's letters on the pavement
I find it hard to breathe

It's hard to breathe
I've been taught to take it easy
I've been taught to flung my arms as well
Taught to take in my surroundings
All the different colours shapes and smells
Sing it back to me
There's letters on the pavement
Staring up at me at me

Through hundreds of people
You know I will settle my scores
Through hundreds of people
You know I will settle my scores
