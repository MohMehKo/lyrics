All they do is talk, all we do is get it in
All they do is lose, all we do is win
All they do is talk, all we do is stack cash
All they do is hate, all we do is akkt bad

And that's it, and that's it, and that's it, and that's it
And that's it, and that's it, (that's all folks) and that's it, and that's it
