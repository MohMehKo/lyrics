We be gettin cash they be gettin mad
Blowing money fast call it akktin bad
They be tryin do it I already did it
We don't talk about it we just go in get it

I'm drippin in sauce and stayin on fleek

I'm dripping in sauce and stayin on fleek
We be grindin hard and stayin on feet
They be hatin on us lookin so weak
Killin on the internet Slayin on the street
Heavy in the rap game you alreadi know
Don't confuse the rap game wit the TV show
