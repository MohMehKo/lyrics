Young lyric I got old cash smashin on the gas
I got hates getting so mad cuz we akktin bad
Please remember like a flashback you was so wack
I just got a new coach bag you look so sad
I'm a beast you a lab rat all I hear is trash
Why you asking where the flow at where the door at

I ain't trippin bout no competition I do what I do
Princess of the real game I won't never lose
Most city's I was rapping in the hallway I was killin shows
10 years old I'm on worldstar call me lyrikkal
In they so fake bet ya haters won't come around the h
If you ain't down wit team lyric you goin have to stay
I ain't waitin on nobody else I never hesitate
I just made yall a hit show time to celebrate
Try to get me to do anything you goin have to pay
We ain't listening to anything haters have to say
Anyway I'm still in the game like I'm spouse to be
In real life I'm the future queen they bow down to me
They like clowns to me talking loud but that ain't stopping me
You so live why they crowning me and why you copying me

Its young lyric I'm the best kid girl who hot as me
I can tell from the way you move you are not a g
I would take over the whole mall like a shoppin spree
Oh girl you a broke girl lyric got you beat
YL call me greedy can't see me without defeat
You know me I been doing this they all rap cuz of me
I would take you out the rap game please don't play wit me
You ain't ready why would I care what you say to me
Aw man he ain't cold as me she ain't cold as me
You would never go as hard as me or bouth  a bob wit me
Don't get it twisted up I am not that shy girl on tv
Please believe I move like a boss they silents in these streets
I'm a bad akktin junky you a flunky
Hood don't like you but they love me gettin money
You won't beef girl you hungry I want them hunnits, hunnits
