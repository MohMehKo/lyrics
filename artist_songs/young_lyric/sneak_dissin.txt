Haters sneak dissin they ain't sayin no names
Fake girls hate weak rappers throw shade
Hold up [x4]
Haters sneak dissin they ain't sayin no names
Still droppin hits make the kids go cray
Haters sneak dissing they ain't sayin no names
Fake girls hate weak rappers throw shade

Still drippin hits got the Rap Game turnt up
Hollow-tips burn but ya words can't hurt us
All I know is that Akkt bad get to it
Ain't about the cash then it sound real stupid
All I see is haters on my timeline
Majors checkin for me so it's grind time
Started at the bottom making independent moves
Took it to another level on Lifetime
Still got it can't nobody stop it
Killin competition look at em they all copy look at em they all sloppy
I got em all droppin when you talkin about lyric they know that I been about it
Aye, careless what you say tho I was writing back when you was eatin playdough
From being a young G to spittin on TV
To a princess all about the pesos
Back in the booth I'm a beast I'm a savage
They borin and basic I'm way above average
Better be ready you comin for me
Cuz that list on TV don't mean nothing to me
I hop out and show out and do what I please
Got Euros from units that move overseas
Who is this girl right here talkin to me
Everyone see that you copyin me
Give em some credit though at least they trying
Need all they help they can get cuz they dying
Say what you want cuz we know that you lyin
Hate to lose don't care if you see me cryin

Haters sneak dissin they ain't sayin no names
Fake girls hate weak rappers throw shade
Hold up [x4]
Haters sneak dissin they ain't sayin no names
Still droppin hits make the kids go cray
Haters sneak dissin they ain't sayin no names
Fake girls hate weak rappers throw shade
