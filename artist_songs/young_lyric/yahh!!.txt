Hol up, hol up, hol up, hit it
They can't stop me, I ain't finished
Haters need to mind they binness
You lookin just like a witness
Hol up, hol up, hol up, hit it
They jus talkin they ain't wit it
I just paid the block a visit
They like girl u finally did it
Hol up, hol up, hol up, hit it
If I want it, ima get it
I'm about to kill em wit it
Don't stop, get it get it

Hol up, hol up, hol up, hit it
Don't stop get it get it
I am on a money mission
Laughin at the competition
Young and I'm fly and I came wit it.. fresh on the scene I don't play it
They want that heat and I stay wit it.. I stay on fleek and I slay wit it
I took a loss but I came back, I hit the booth and I blaze tracks
Studio that's where I stay at, I am not new we go way back
Killin, drippin, sauce
H-town, in the, buildin, and we, in here, goin off
Keep my, name, outcha, mouf, girl, you don't, wanna, cross
Young, lyric, from the, h, makin moves jus, like a, boss 

Yahh!
Hol up, hol up, hol up, hit it - yahh
