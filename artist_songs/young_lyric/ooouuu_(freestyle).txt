Yeah they hate but they weak though
Tryna win the Rap Game with a cheat code
Copying and lying and disrespecting the G code
But this is real life not a TV show
Ayo XO where the track bruh
JD where the stacks though
Killed the game on Lifetime you already know
Now I gottem screaming "YAHH" on the radio
Boss moves gon be too cold
Raised in the hood I will not fold
If I want it I'm coppin two of those
Steady under pressure the flow is precious like solid gold
To these kids I'm a hero
Cause I came from the gutter this that casino's
We be hittin lyrics like a free throw
They be throwing shade but I peep though
They be like "she won?", I be like "we won"
Coming for the princess isn't she dumb
No ghost writer well you need one
Where yo hits at we ain't see none
This is something you can't hide from
I'm respected that's something you can't buy hun
I've been killing the competition since day one
Whole rap game full of my sons
Ayo Tan what they flexin for
Like they ain't been copying since I hit the door
Like I ain't why they even watch the show
Like we ain't in the streets really getting dough
Life's great what you mad for
All of that hate making me laugh bruh
Tryna diss me but you trash though
Can't lose when you grinding harder and stack more
Find me where the cash at
Talking Lifetime Fresh Empire racks
Fell up in the stu wearing all black
Streets begging me back so I'm bout to kill the track
Yeah we lit and the flow sick
Sold out shows we killin I'm so thick
Y'all lookin like magicians with no tricks
Jealous girls mad cause I'm young and so rich
I can never lose what you thought
Lyric got it lit man I'm cause
Drippin on em shout out to the sauce
Private G6 taking off
I was taught to move like a boss
Keep yo goons on deck when I floss
I don't never care what it cost
2017 I'm going up
OOOUUU
