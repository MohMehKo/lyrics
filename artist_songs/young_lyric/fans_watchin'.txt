Chain hang, on the side, akktin b.a.d.,
Miss juicy couture, skinny jeans, and my 23's
Miss thang, diamond rings by johnny dang
I'm the youngest in the game, everybody know my name
It sound dead, when u drop it, I hop on it, make it live
And got greedy when my daddy said the limit is the sky
I be chilling in disguise, when I'm blowing up the mall
And I'm styling on whoever out there hoping that I fall 
Labels never fed us, still I got my bread up
I'm so far ahead, I might stop and let em catch up
Independent marketing, is it working?, obviously
Took over the internet, now it ain't no stopping me
Plus I'm bout to kill em wit the hottest album on the street
L-y-r-i-c, flyer than a helicopter
Bad akktors, houston, we have a problem..

Imma keep it real cuz my fans watchin [x3]
Drop top head boppin
[x2]

Nothing to something, dreams to, reality
They following the lioness, big cat diary
Princess, honestly, this is child psychology
Hating cuz I'm taking full advantage of technology
Everybody watching me, now we getting paid for that
First class on the money train and you ain't even in the back
Spitting, wrecking all these tracks, it's a wrap if lyric on it
Yeah I hear em asking 4 it, promise they don't really want it!!
Miss me jeans, new j's and a juicy shirt
Kilt the all star, candy red louie purse
I'm real, ask about me in the hood
Mlk sundays, like its all good
Getting pics from my fans, rocking overseas
Hopping outta private plane down in south beach
See the negativity is what I can't stand..
YL who I do it for? all my fans!

Imma keep it real cuz my fans watchin [x3]
Drop top head boppin
