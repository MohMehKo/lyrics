You say we're irreplaceable
I met you when my heart was full
Now it's running empty
We went from irresistible
To something we don't even know
And it's terrrible I know

Why you, why you wanna call this love
All we ever do is lie there's no
Dirty little secrets when everyone you know knows me
Why you, why you wanna keep this going
Why we tryna be something knowing
Every little secrets, no we can't keep this up

All my friends know your friends
And now nothing's in confidence
When there's no one in between us
You and me we're too tied up
Got a screenshot from an unknown number
Someone you know doesn't like you
Won't pretend I'm any better
It's messed up but we don't stop
We're too tied up
We're too tied up
We're too tied up
We're too tied up

I can feel it in your kiss
Maybe we're both over this
Come on say something
Not like you not to answer back
Don't you dare blame it on my hands
Wrapped around your neck

Why you, why you wanna call this love
All we ever do is lie there's no
Dirty little secrets when everyone you know knows me
Why you, why you wanna keep this going
Why we tryna be something knowing
Every little secrets, no we can't keep this up

All my friends know your friends
And now nothing's in confidence
When there's no one in between us
You and me we're too tied up
Got a screenshot from an unknown number
Someone you know doesn't like you
Won't pretend I'm any better
It's messed up but we don't stop
We're too tied up
We're too tied up
We're too tied up
We're too tied up

All my friends know your friends
And now nothing's in confidence
When there's no one in between us
You and me we're too tied up
Got a screenshot from an unknown number
Someone you know doesn't like you
Won't pretend I'm any better
It's messed up but we don't stop
We're too tied up
We're too tied up
We're too tied up
We're too tied up
