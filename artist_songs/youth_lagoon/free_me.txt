Burning up the chimney 
Shots suspicions fully gone
Nobody does truly on their own
On their own

The earthquakes your voice creates 
A silence to my home
Nobody does truly on their own
On their own 

I've been caught in the water 
Since I turned 8 years old
What started as a spark
Burned down the household

Free me
Free me

I've felt heaviness creep
Since I turned 8 years old
What started as a phantom
Took over the world 

Free me
Free me

As the roof caves in
Ambers light my skin
Lying on the floor
Undressed

The taste of green tea drips
Onto my cracked lips
From the table by
The bed

Holy white (holy white)
Holy white (holy white)
Shield my head from the sun

Holy white (holy white)
Holy white (holy white)
Shield my head from the sun

I've been caught in the water
Since I turned 8 years old
What started as a spark
Burned down the household

Free me
Free me

I've felt heaviness creep
Since I turned 8 years old
What started as a phantom
Took over the world

Free me
Free me
