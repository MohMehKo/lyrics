Oh, everybody wants to think they’re not what they ate, that their body’s great
Oh, everybody wants to think that they’re good at heart, when they’re full of hate
Oh, everybody wants to think that their luck will change, when there’s no such thing
Oh, everybody wants to think that they won’t grow old, yet they keep aging

I’ve been underneath the canopy, lost in a spell
I shut up every time you look at me, but you can’t tell
In skin, the psyche has a tendency to trust what’s untrue
I’ve been underneath the canopy, wasting for you
