My legs are limbs
My shoes are cold stones
All I want is for you to come back home
I've yelled your name
Through fields alone
All I want is for you to come back home

Sorrow screams that terrible tone
Leave me deeper though the world of see unknown
Sorrow screams that terrible tone
Loud man flashes wearing suits without cologne

And if they fabricate us
Place a crux in anyone
To "Gretzky-safe", you can crack
And we can still imagine what we had
We will be the faces of the future at last
