As the foxes hunt
All the chickens start to run
Next thing I know my neck no longer has a front
All the wars are made
I won't sleep until my grave
I am young but I am brave and I am not your slave

I will swear to you now that I'm not what they say
I have a sickness in my head that won't go away
And by the time the bugs eat their way out of my skull
Will you still say 'I love you'? Will you still want my soul?

As the lions hunt
All the zebras start to run
But I refuse to be called somebody else's lunch
Cause all the wars are made
I won't sleep until my grave
I am young but I am brave and I'm not your slave

I will swear to you now that I'm not what they say
I have a sickness in my head that won't go away
And by the time the bugs eat their way out of my skull
Will you still say 'I love you'? Will you still want my soul?
