You camped out in my mind
and told me evil things
like a demon I cant find
but I named you.
I named you.

Standing over my
bed you opened up
and I wont wake up this time
and I blame you.
I blame you.

I will not hear you out
you tried to drown me once
at the bottom of the lake
I jumped off
this rope's gone

Bobby sung it all
Brother you know me
But it's come to stop your gun
Your spirit
Won't be there.

Remember
When we were kids on road trips
And your family was pissed
And the whole town, we all scared them
And I lay there
Put a spring into my head
