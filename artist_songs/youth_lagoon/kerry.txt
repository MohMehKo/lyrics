Kerry made his way to Vegas
Hiding from the cops and cages
He lived in hell three years
Longing to sleep with heavens...

Kerry struck a sea not golden
Turned it into powder glow
He made the whole room snow
Long in the blizzard
He never felt so cold

Kerry fell in love with kin
And pills at the same time
I'm not sure what bothered him
But it ate him up inside

Move the brush around
Lick the paint from off the ground

Move the brush around
Lick the paint from off the ground

Move the brush around
Lick the paint from off the ground

Kerry fell in love with kin
And pills at the same time
I'm not sure what bothered him
But it ate him up inside

Used to be Las Vegas that made him feel alive
Now instead of succeeding, he'd rather just survive
There's nobody faster, he's running so light
There's nobody faster than Kerry inside
