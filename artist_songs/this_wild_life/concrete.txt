I’ve got feet like concrete, and a head like lead
God I feel so heavy, I give up and head home
I just want to be left alone

Woah,
I treated you with honesty honestly, you promised me, promised me
Woah,
You said that you were sorry you’re far away, you’d always come back for me
You’re break, breaking your word, I don’t care what you’ve heard
Cause you’ve fucked up, yeah you fucked up
Yeah, I thought we’d live off love but it was not enough, not enough

And I just need a day, to shed this dead weight, and to get my head straight
I just want to let go, I just want to be left alone

Woah,
I treated you with honesty honestly, you promised me, promised me
Woah,
You said that you were sorry you’re far away, you’d always come back for me
You’re break, breaking your word, I don’t care what you’ve heard
Cause you’ve fucked up, yeah you fucked up
Yeah, I thought we’d live off love but it was not enough, not enough
It was not enough, it was never enough
Yeah, thought we’d live off love but it was not enough, not enough

Woah,
I treated you with honesty honestly, you promised me, promised me
Woah,
You said that you were sorry you’re far away, you’d always come back for me
You’re break, breaking your word, I don’t care what you’ve heard
Cause you’ve fucked up, yeah you fucked up
Yeah, I thought we’d live off love but it was not enough, not enough
Woah,
I treated you with honesty honestly, you promised me, promised me
Woah,
You said that you were sorry you’re far away, you’d always come back for me
You’re break, breaking your word, I don’t care what you’ve heard
Cause you’ve fucked up, yeah you fucked up
Yeah, I thought we’d live off love but it was not enough, not enough
