You should not get what you have not earned
What I do from here is none of your concern
It didn’t work, yeah I know it hurts
But it’s gotta give before it gets much worse

Oooh, gotta give up on you, oooh
Oooh, gotta give up on you, on you

We’ve got a lot of history
But there’s too much space between you and me
You have plans, yeah I have dreams
But do I have the guts in me
To leave, leave, pack my shit and leave
Leave, leave

The irony gets the best of me
I’m sad that we split, but you’re still happy
What I gave to you was more than memories
What you took from me wasn’t worth anything

Oooh, gotta give up on you, oooh
Oooh, gotta give up on you, on you

We’ve got a lot of history
But there’s too much space between you and me
You have plans, yeah I have dreams
But do I have the guts in me
To leave, leave, pack my shit and leave
Leave, leave, oh

You never cared enough, you never earned my trust
You just took what you could get
You never lift me up, I never feel your love
I know exactly what this is

I’m tired of the weight when you lean on me
If I fell you would never stay to carry me

We’ve got a lot of history
But there’s too much space between you and me
You have plans, yeah I have dreams
But do I have the guts in me
To leave, leave, pack my shit and leave
Leave, leave
