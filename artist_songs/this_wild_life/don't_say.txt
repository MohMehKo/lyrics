You left me here and I didn't care
I'd follow you almost anywhere
I didn't mind that you left
Just don't say it's over
Was life so bad on the West Coast?
Is desert air what you needed most?
You're on my mind even though
I know that it's over

And I can't wait forever for you to grow up
I swore I'd never have to give you up at all

Oh, but won't you get away, get away
Get away
Won't you get away, get away
Oh, oh won't you get away, get away
Get away
Won't you get away, get away
And just give me some space

I'm much too young to be in love
A year behind never catching up
I'm scared to death when we share blood
You're never sober
You fight and shove when you're angry
Were you stable before you met me?
You kick and scream when we're ending
There's no way it's over

I can't wait forever for you to grow up
I swore I'd never have to give you up at all

Oh, but won't you get away, get away
Get away
Won't you get away, get away
Oh, oh won't you get away, get away
Get away
Won't you get away, get away
And just give me some space

Did you forget the way you felt in my bed?
The way it felt when I said that you're all I have
Did you forget to pack your heart when you left?
When we're apart I'm a mess, but you're all I have

You're all I have, you're all I have
You're all I have

Won't you get away, get away
Get away
Won't you get away, get away
And just give me some space
Won't you get away, get away
Get away
Won't you get away, get away
