When I'm falling down, back to the ground
I know that you'll be there for me
When I'm not around, up in the clouds
I know that you'll be there for me

Nobody else can have me the way that you do, oh
Nobody else is holding me down besides you, oh

It's too bad I had to scream and yell
But what you can't tell
Is what you came for is gone for now
Keep holding me down, when you hear this sound

When I'm falling down, back to the ground
I know that you'll be there for me
When I'm not around, up in the clouds
I know that you'll be there for me

Been down before, broken asleep on the floor, oh
I need you more, but something has fallen apart, oh

It's too bad I had to scream and yell
But what you can't tell
Is what you came for is gone for now
Keep holding me down, when you hear this sound

When I'm falling down, back to the ground
I know that you'll be there for me
When I'm not around, up in the clouds
I know that you'll be there for me

When I'm falling down, back to the ground
I know that you'll be there for me
When I'm not around, up in the clouds
I know that you'll be there for me
