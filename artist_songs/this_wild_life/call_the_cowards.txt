[Intro:]
You know you can’t fight it, leaving is so hard.
Do anything to win, anything to get you far.

Call the cowards, they’re knocking at your door.
Heartless, giftless, you’re spineless to the core.

[Pre-chorus:]
You know me, you know me too well.
To put this on the shelf.
I know you, I know you too well.
To let this go but still...

[Chorus:]
I really hate to say I told you so, 
But now you’re left with nowhere to go.
Get high and dry is all you wanna do.
Do anything to be anyone but you.
Anyone, anyone. You know we’ll still be around.
Yeah we’ll still be around.

Try to find your way straight to the top.
Cause your dreaming never seems to stop.

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus:]
I really hate to say I told you so, 
But now you’re left with nowhere to go.
Get high and dry is all you wanna do.
Do anything to be anyone but you.
Anyone, anyone. You know we’ll still be around.
While you’re stuck to the ground.

[Intro]

[Chorus]
