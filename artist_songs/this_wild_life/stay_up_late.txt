I was hoping that you'd stay
‘Cause tonight I wanna stay up late
I was hoping that you'd say
That you were feeling lonely just like me
I'm still hoping that you're happy
‘Cause you know I can barely stand up straight
I'm still hoping that I can be, everything that you would ask of me

But am I
All wrong
Long gone
Too far from your heart
Last year was hard
I fell apart

I know you don't feel this way but
I'll try to convince you so
If it's lost
Or if it's fate
I hope you pick up this late

I know you don't feel this way but
I'll try to convince you so
If it's lost
Or if it's fate
I hope you pick up this late

I've been missing how we'd pretend
Cause tonight I really need a friend
We pretended we were happy
Maybe we can try and start it again
But am I
All wrong
Long gone
Too far from your heart
Last year was hard
I fell apart

I know you don't feel this way but
I'll try to convince you so
If it's lost
Or if it's fate
I hope you pick up this late
I know you don't feel this way but
I'll try to convince you so
If it's love
Or if it's fate
I hope you pick up this late

Ooooh…

I never thought that we'd end up like this
But the cycling it makes me sick
It's a long shot and I can't tell
It's another coin in the wishing well
Another coin in a wishing well

Honestly if I'm being honest with myself
I know which way you fell
You don't love me I can tell

I know you don't feel this way but
I'll try to convince you so
If it's lost
Or if it's fate
I hope you pick up this late
I know you don't feel this way but
I'll try to convince you so
If it's love
Or if it's fate
I hope you pick up this late

I hope you pick up this late
I hope you pick up this late
