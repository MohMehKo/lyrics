There's a lump in my throat from the words that yours
I've covered the bone then I drove it home
Gotta cut you out from in my head.

Don't leave me be
'Cause I don't know if you can
Be alone with me
Alone with me.

You don't, or you won't, just love yourself
And I can't even stand to ask for help
But I'm begging you to let me out
Yeah I'm begging you to let me down.

You can't, or you won't, just let this end
And I can't even tell just where you went
But I'm begging you to let me in
And I'll love you 'cause I know you can't.

Love you 'cause I know you can't
Love you 'cause I know you can't.

Times have changed but you stay the same
So get under the rock for another day
If you're listening then meet me half way.

Don't leave me be
'Cause I don't know if you can
Be alone with me
Alone with me.

You don't, or you won't, just love yourself
And I can't even stand to ask for help
But I'm begging you to let me out
Yeah I'm begging you to let me down.

You can't, or you won't, just let this end
And I can't even tell just where you went
But I'm begging you to let me in
And I'll love you 'cause I know you can't.

It's not about what's best but what's best for you
I can't love myself living like we do
You're not alone
You're not alone.

If you shut me out I'm kicking that door down
Gotta stop stop living so deep underground
Before you're gone.

So don't you, don't leave me be
'Cause I don't know if you can
Be alone with me
Alone with me
Alone with me.

You don't, or you won't, just love yourself
And I can't even stand to ask for help
But I'm begging you to let me out
Yeah I'm begging you to let me down.

You can't, or you won't, just let this end
And I can't even tell just where you went
But I'm begging you to let me in
And I'll love you 'cause I know you can't.
