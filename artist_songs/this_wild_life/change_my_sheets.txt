Change my sheets, a brand new me
I'll start again, I'll keep it cleaned
Cause I've been circling the drain
It seems for days, but maybe it's just me
And I've been calling out your name

But where did you go? [x4]

Bleach my stains, forget my pains
Let's talk it all out now
Cut my knees begging you please

But where did you go? [x4]

I guess it's true 
That I don't know what to do 
That I don't know what to do
Without you
I guess it's true 
That I don't know what to do
I still don't know what to do 
Without you

Slowly I'm falling through each of your stories
The bottom seems near now remember you told me
I'll never feel that way again, I'll never feel that pain again
I'm spread thin like water on cement
I can't seem to get to where you went
Come back to me

But where did you go? [x3]

Change my sheets, a brand new me
I'll start again, I'll keep it cleaned

But where did you go?
