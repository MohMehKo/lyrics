People grow up but they never change
you say you've worked things out but you're still the same
Keeping your word means nothing to me
cause you made a mess cause you're such a wreck from this

I gave you all of me
but you're so damn reckless
cause you gave it away, you gave it away 
and you made a mess cause you're such a wreck from this

But I'm never going to take you back
cause you're nothing but a heart attack
I can't take it
do you ever get tired of hearing 
take you back
cause you're nothing but a heart attack
I can't shake it
do you ever get tired of hearing

And you left your love for me
when you went down deep
and left your long beach scene
for a selfish dream
Keeping your word means nothing to me
cause you made a mess because you're such a wreck from this

I gave you all of me
but you're so damn reckless
cause you gave it away, you gave it away 
cause you made a mess cause you're such a wreck for this

But I'm never going to take you back
cause you're nothing but a heart attack
I can't take it
do you ever get tired of hearing 
take you back
cause you're nothing but a heart attack
I can't shake it
do you ever get tired of hearing

You said you miss me and you're lonely
You fucked up badly and you're sorry it ended this way
It ended this way
You always wanted the best of me and never the rest of me

But I'm never going to take you back
cause you're nothing but a heart attack
I can't take it
do you ever get tired of hearing 
take you back
cause you're nothing but a heart attack
I can't shake it
do you ever get tired of hearing
