I've got a feeling that we're closer to the end than where we began
So just let me go, send me home, give me away
And throw me away

I think we're better off just being friends than to sleep in one bed
Without facing you, tasting you. What's with you these days?
Did our love go away?

Cause I'm a brick wall bound to fall, my head into the pavement
You don't want me at all, so leave with what you came with
I know I can't go on, with this feeling in my blood
You've fallen out of love, and I think I've lost my touch

Yeah yeah, I'll come back if you ask
Because this bath is getting colder
And its water is black with my stains
When you threw me away

Cause I'm a brick wall bound to fall, my head into the pavement
You don't want me at all, so leave with what you came with
I know I can't go on, with this feeling in my blood
You've fallen out of love, and I think I've lost my touch

Who will want me now, now that I've fallen from your clouds?
Who will want me now, now that I've fallen from your clouds?
Who will want me now, now that I've fallen from your clouds?
Who will want me now, now that I've fallen from your clouds?
Who will want me now, now that I've fallen from your clouds?
