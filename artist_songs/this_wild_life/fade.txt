Swear I could leave you if I tried
I said I'm leaving and I might, but you stay as I fade
I only want you late at night, to lose my mind between your thighs
It's okay if I fade

But don't mistake physical affection for emotional connection
God you know I miss it, but girl you know I'm distant
Never meant to fuck with your head

And I fade, and I fade away, away
Try to change, but I stay the same, the same

If I'm a mess when you get back
It's cause I drank all that I had
Would you stay as I fade?
I needed someone here to hold
To save me from a night so cold
It's okay if I fade

But don't mistake physical affection for emotional connection
God you know I miss it, but girl you know I'm distant
Never meant to fuck with your head

And I fade, and I fade away, away
Try to change, but I stay the same, the same

I'm trying to let you go
I'm trying to let you go
I'm trying to let you go

And I fade, and I fade away, away
Try to change, but I stay the same, the same

But don't mistake physical affection for emotional connection
God you know I miss it, but girl you know I'm distant
Never meant to fuck with your head
