Hit the reset, I'm starting again
I'm in the thick of it, does it hurt a little bit?
Eyes are still red, I can't see the end
I'm in the thick of it, does it hurt a little bit,
To watch me go?

Don't cover me up, California
I hardly know you
I've waited enough, Arizona
The summer's over
So come back home, so come back home

Hit the reset, I'm starting again
The hardest part of this, is knowing what I've missed
He loves you better than I ever did
The hardest part is still, just knowing that you will
Still let me go

Don't cover me up, California
I hardly know you
I've waited enough, Arizona
The summer's over
So come back home, so come back home

Hit the reset, we're starting again
I'll always love you, I always did
Hit the reset, hit the reset

Don't cover me up, California
I hardly know you
I've waited enough, Arizona
The summer's over
So come back home, so come back home
