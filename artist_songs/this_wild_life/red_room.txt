Let me know when you've had enough
I'm six drinks deep and I'm feeling rough
Let you know that I'm headed home
But you don't even care at all

I've got to go before I get worse
I'm eight drinks deep when it starts to hurt
I miss you so but we both know
That you don't even miss me at all

I sent a one eyed text a little too honest
Between the ninth and tenth I think I lost my head
Make my way to bed with someone else instead

But I'm missing (you)
If I could take it back
Give everything I have
So we could start again
But I'm missing (you)
If I could take it back
Give everything I have
So we could start again

The morning hurts when I wake alone
The scent of clothes from the night before
Holding tight to my broken phone
But you don't even miss me at all

I sent a one eyed text a little too honest
Between the ninth and tenth I think I lost my head
Make my way to bed with someone else instead

But I'm missing (you)
If I could take it back
Give everything I have
So we could start again
But I'm missing (you)
If I could take it back
Give everything I have
So we could start again

But I'm missing (you)
If I could take it back
Give everything I have
So we could start again
But I'm missing (you)
If I could take it back
Give everything I have
So we could start again
