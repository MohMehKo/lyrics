I'm jealous of the life you're living
I never made the best decisions
I learn the hard way or not at all
I wouldn't answer when you called

I never know where I am heading
I feel like there's something missing
I made my choice and found my voice
I never know what's down this road

Sometimes when I drive
Southbound windows down the 405
The summer air, we're singing loud
We can take this road almost anywhere

And sometimes, yeah, I'm fine
I'm Northbound hoping that I'll be alright
I need you here right by my side
I'm learning how to really live my life

I'm moving slower now than ever
I try to hold it all together
My eyes are wide yet my mind is tired
I fall asleep in between your lines

I wonder, was it worth this last year?
If things get worse will you still be here?
I made my choice and found my voice
Will you still be here if I go?

Sometimes when I drive
Southbound windows down the 405
The summer air, we're singing loud
We can take this road almost anywhere

And sometimes, yeah, I'm fine
I'm Northbound hoping that I'll be alright
I need you here right by my side
I'm learning how to really live my life
