We all lie just to get by
It feels fine for a little while
I can't keep it up for long
Cause I'm spinning a web and I'm stuck and it's fucked
But I know this will hurt
Cause when I'm hurt, I treat you worse

I miss your skin, I miss your touch
I never thought it'd hurt this much
I hate this feeling in my gut
I wish you would quit me, I wish you would just leave
Cause I can never walk away
And so it's up to you to break me

And I'll try to say goodbye
I'll be fast to save you time
I can't help but stay the night
You're alarmed and you're hurt and I just make it worse
When I run through your veins
Cause when I'm hurt, I treat you worse

I miss your skin, I miss your touch
I never thought it'd hurt this much
I hate this feeling in my gut
I wish you would quit me, I wish you would just leave
Cause I can never walk away
And so it's up to you to break me

You can have my body, just not my soul
Can't give what's not mine anymore
Have my body, just not my soul
You can have my body, I've lost control
Can't live on my own anymore
Have my body, just not my soul
Have my body, but not my soul
Have my body, but not my soul

I miss your skin, I miss your touch
I never thought it'd hurt this much
I hate this feeling in my gut
I wish you would quit me, I wish you would just leave
Cause I can never walk away
And so it's up to you to break me
