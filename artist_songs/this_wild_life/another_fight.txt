We say the worst things to the ones we love
use words to cut deep things, thing's I'm wishing up
When I feel like I'm trapped I fight dirty
Forget about the shit that I said at 10:30
I don't even know what we're doing here
I'm turning into the person i was last year
I don't even know what we.re doing here
I'm losing everything that I love

It's just another fight
Just give it one more night
cause you know I hate moving on
It's just another fight
Just give it one more night
You know I'll never say when I'm wrong
But I'm wrong

I'll take it back
I'll take back all of my actions
We'll make it work shut out all the distractions
I wasn't proud, proud of how you were treated
You know I always hate the way I get what I needed

I don't even know what we're doing here
I'm turning into the person i was last year
I don't even know what we're doing here
I'm losing everything that I love

It's just another fight
Just give it one more night
cause you know that I hate moving on
It's just another fight
Just give it one more night
You know I'll never say when I'm wrong

And nobody knows me like you do

I'm so ashamed, so ashamed of my actions
now take it back, take it back

We say the worst things to the ones we love
use words to cut deep things, thing's I'm wishing up
When I feel like I'm trapped I fight dirty
cause when I feel like you're trapped

It's just another fight
Just give it one more night
cause you know that I hate moving on
It's just another fight
Just give it one more night
You know I'll never say when I'm wrong

And nobody knows me like you do
