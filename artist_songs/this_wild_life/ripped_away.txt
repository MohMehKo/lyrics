Was I lying right through my teeth
when I said I was trustworthy
I said I’d never ever live this way
I’m turning into everything I hate

Well I was reckless with your love
I know I never gave you enough
Well I was reckless with your love
I know I never gave you enough

Well is it all slipping away from me
I can’t be anything you want me to be
All, ripped away from me
I can’t be anything you want me to be
My heart is heavy and it keeps me to the ground
My eyes are swollen cause I can’t have you around
All ripped away from me, 
I can’t be anything you want me to be

I didn’t have the strength to just come clean
Feeling weak and hurt it seems
That I can never look you in the face
Don’t have the spine to go to your place

Well I was reckless with your love
I know I never gave you enough
Well I was reckless with your love
I know I never gave you enough

Well is it all slipping away from me
I can’t be anything you want me to be
All, ripped away from me
I can’t be anything you want me to be
My heart is heavy and it keeps me to the ground
My eyes are swollen cause I can’t have you around
All ripped away from me, 
I can’t be anything you want me to be

What can I do? What can I say?
After all I pushed you away
If you ever forgive me now it would be too soon
What can I do? What can I say?
After all I pushed you away
If you ever forgive me now it would be too soon

Well is it all slipping away from me
Well is it all ripped away from me

Well is it all slipping away from me
I can’t be anything you want me to be
All, ripped away from me
I can’t be anything you want me to be
My heart is heavy and it keeps me to the ground
My eyes are swollen cause I can’t have you around
All ripped away from me, 
I can’t be anything you want me to be

I can’t be anything you want me to be
I can’t be anything you want me to be
I can’t be anything you want me to be
I can’t be anything you want me to be
