Don't say you want it, it's clear that you're haunted
There's a ghost in you, that you can't lose
You say you don't need it, you're clearly defeated
What's left to do, but break in two?

It's not like it was just yesterday
Remember the days we chose to waste?
Still trying to fill your place
It's not like it was just yesterday

Feeling exhausted, I know that you want this
I'm the ghost in you, that you can't lose
He's stripping your armor, abandoning Father
He'll leave you soon, it's what we do

It's not like it was just yesterday
Remember the days we chose to waste?
Still trying to fill your place
It's not like it was just yesterday

Is it a waste of time trying to make this right?
I've got no peace of mind if you're not in my life
Should I let you go, and be with someone new?
Should I say I'm happy for you, for you?
And pretend I'm happy for you, for you?

It's not like it was just yesterday
Remember the days we chose to waste?
Still trying to fill your place
It's not like it was just yesterday
