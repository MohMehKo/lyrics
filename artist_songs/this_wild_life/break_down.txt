I just can't keep this running
It's been seven years still nothing changes
I'm always waiting 
On you to break down
One record in my car
A quarter tank won't get me far
I'm stuck in third, stuck in the dirt
A warm forty to quench my thirst

Nowhere to go
All alone
Singing your song
You're not in shotgun

Forget my pain, forget my name
I've told you time and time again
That when you break down I break down
Forget directions or bad intentions
I'm lost without your headlights
And when you break down I break down

I guess I'm always running
Twenty seven years still I can't change it
I'm always waiting
On you to break down
We made love in your car
The backseat so uncomfortable
I went right in, and cried again
That smell still lingers on my skin

Nowhere to go
All alone
Singing your song
You're not in shotgun

Forget my pain, forget my name
I've told you time and time again
That when you break down I break down
Forget directions or bad intentions
I'm lost without your headlights
And when you break down I break down
