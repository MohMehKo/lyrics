You know you never seem to mind
When I show up late in this broke down car of mine
To pick you up and take you out
We make the best of our short time
And though it's not enough you assure me that it's fine
With windows down let's go for a ride

Cause when I mess up, you never give up your love
Yeah I'm a fuck up, but you swear I'm enough
And all I know that's true, is just how much I miss you
Hold up, you're running away
I swear I told ya, it gets better today
And all I know that's true, is just how much I love you

You know you never seem to mind
When I get off late and wanna stay in for the night
We'll watch some Sunny it'll be alright
And when my world is upside down
You're always planted firmly, so firmly on the ground
We'll lay together without a sound

Cause when I mess up, you never give up your love
Yeah I'm a fuck up, but you swear I'm enough
And all I know that's true, is just how much I miss you
Hold up, you're running away
I swear I told ya, it gets better today
And all I know that's true, is just how much I love you
