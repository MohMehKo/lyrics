Now I've been bouncing back
To get on track and take,
take blame for my mistakes
Those days where I was off
and chasing dreams never meant for me
Better days are just ahead of me

Get up or get out
Don't even think about it
Put up or shut up
Don't give a shit about it
Get up or get out
Don't even think about it
Put up or shut up
Don't give a shit about it
Say what we wanna say
and never look back
Say what you wanna say
Go on and trash talk

Now I've been tracing back
My footsteps down the line,
learning how to make this life mine
And see who I should be
Just to be yourself and you'll learn to see that,
I'm always free in a way you'll never be

Get up or get out
Don't even think about it
Put up or shut up
Don't give a shit about it
Get up or get out
Don't even think about it
Put up or shut up
Don't give a shit about it
Say what we wanna say
and never look back
Say what you wanna say
Go on and trash talk
Say what we wanna say
and never look back
Say what you wanna say
Say what you wanna say

Get up or get out
Get up or get out
Say what we wanna say
and never look back
Go on and trash talk!

You're green with envy 'cause now we're ready
We're taking chances and making memories
Tell me how it feels when you see me leaving

Get up or get out
Don't even think about it
Put up or shut up
Don't give a shit about it
Get up or get out
Don't even think about it
Put up or shut up
Don't give a shit about it
Say what we wanna say
and never look back
Say what you wanna say
Go on and trash talk
Say what we wanna say
and never look back
Say what you wanna say
Go on and trash talk
