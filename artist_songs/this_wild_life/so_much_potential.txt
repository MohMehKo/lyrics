You're not right baby.
You're not the person that I used to know.
Conscience is fading.
Your heart's escaping with nowhere to go.

It used to be me that gave you everything
Now I see someone else is on top of things
Baby I still believe, that you've got what I need
Make it right for tonight bring it back and

Visit me in my sleep 
Just like when we were kids, steal the car and drive to me
Woah woah woah ah oh 
Young love so much potential
With covers kept above, and insecurities below we're singing
Woah woah woah ah oh 
Young love so much potential

You're messed up lately,
Going back on everything you said
Love drives me crazy.
Whatever happened to that girl I met?

It used to be me that gave you everything
Now I see someone else is on top of things
Baby I still believe, that you've got what I need
Make it right for tonight bring it back and

Visit me in my sleep 
Just like when we were kids, steal the car and drive to me
Woah woah woah ah oh 
Young love so much potential
With covers kept above, and insecurities below we're singing
Woah woah woah ah oh 
Young love so much potential

I'll wait for you but not forever, it's up to you get it together.
I'll wait for you but not forever, it's up to you get it together.
I'll wait for you but not forever, it's up to you get it together.
I'll wait for you but not forever, it's up to you get it together.

Visit me in my sleep 
Just like when we were kids, steal the car and drive to me
Woah woah woah ah oh
Visit me in my sleep 
Just like when we were kids, steal the car and drive to me
Woah woah woah ah oh 
Young love so much potential
With covers kept above, and insecurities below we're singing
Woah woah woah ah oh 
Young love so much potential
