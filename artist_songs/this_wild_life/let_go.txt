I think I'm done, done needing your love
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
I'm burning bridges faster than ever before
I think I'll sink deep into me
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
I'm burning even faster

I'm learning when to let go
I'm learning when to let go
I'm learning when to let go
I'm learning when to let go

I think I'm done, done feeling this numb
I'm seeing you in color for the first time
I've never felt better leaving you behind
I won't stay here, here cause you don't care
I'm learning lessons that I never could before
I'm burning even faster

I'm learning when to let go
I'm learning when to let go
I'm learning when to let go
I'm learning when to let go

Wondering if you're wandering
Do you regret almost everything?
I'll try to breathe easier
I hope this gets easier

All alone searching in the cold
Holding on to a shred of hope
I'll try to breathe easy now
I hope you find peace somehow

I think I'm done, done needing your love
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
I'm burning even faster

I'm learning when to let go
I'm learning when to let go
I'm learning when to let go
I'm learning when to let go
