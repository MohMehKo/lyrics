We were the first out of the gates
And so you learned from our mistakes
You know it's me you'll have to thank, but you say 
You're dead to me

You sing of ships like the son of a sailor man
Paying your dues is easy when you own land
You never say it to my face man to man cuz
You're dead to me

I'm over it you never quit talking shit
And lately I'm getting tired 
Of taking the high road when you're so low
You've got to let this go
I'm over it you never quit talking shit
And lately you're such a liar
Sometimes I wish that you'd just explode
You've got to let this go
You've got to let this go

You've gotta learn to mind your own manners
You rat that slanders
So watch your words and I'll watch mine too
You're dead to me

It's such a joke when your words all blow out like smoke
I'll let this go when you hang it up by the ropes
See how it goes, there still may be some hope
You're dead to me

I'm over it you never quit talking shit
And lately I'm getting tired 
Of taking the high road when you're so low
You've got to let this go
I'm over it you never quit talking shit
And lately you're such a liar
Sometimes I wish that you'd just explode
You've got to let this go
You've got to let this go

Call it an ender
We've said what we wanted to say
Well drop the anchor
Until our words wash away
Call it an ender
'Cause you'll always be a friend to me

I'm over it we've gotta quit talking shit
'Cause lately I'm getting tired 
Of taking the high road and feeling so low
You've got to let this go
I'm over it we've gotta quit talking shit
'Cause lately I'm uninspired
What will it take for us both to grow
You've got to let this go
And I've got to let this go
Let this go!
