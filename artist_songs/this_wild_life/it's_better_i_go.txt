You saw right through it
I knew I blew it
It's always the same thing
I can't do it
I told you I,
I'm spread to thin
And nobody wins, nobody wins!
And words are such clumsy things
So I'll leave this to Pen...

I left a note on your bed
I'm never coming back
I'm stuck in the rut
I can barely deal with that
You're fighting for us but I'm begging you don't
It's better I go, cause I know that you wont!

You just won't go!

You deal with the same shit
But just wont quit.
You truly believe in change,
I'll change my own ways!
But your better off without me,
And without this, without this!
And words are just clumsy things
So lets make this, The End.

We're both headed in different directions
And will we ever meet up, up? 
We're both left with different intentions
But maybe loves not enough ahh
We're both headed in different directions
And will we ever meet up, up? 
We're both left with different intentions
But, since when has love not been enough?
