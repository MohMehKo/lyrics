I'm losing trust in you
These things I never ever do to you
I'll find a back door
I'll run for it
A back door
I'll run for it
I'm losing faith in you

It's alright, it's alright
I was second best but you're still stuck in my head
It's alright, it's alright
Taking slower breathes but I'm still the same mess
All my days are coloured grey
I'll find a way to make you say.

It's alright, it's alright
I'll be second best
But you're still fucked in the head

You know I'd wait for you
And so you use it when you need to prove
That I can't find a back door
Or run for it
A back door
Or run for it
I've lost my faith in you

It's alright, it's alright
I was second best but you're still stuck in my head
It's alright, it's alright
Taking slower breathes but I'm still the same mess
All my days are coloured grey
I'll find a way to make you say

It's alright, it's alright
I'll be second best
But you're still fucked in the head

You don't know what you're missing
I can't get it through your thick fucking head
You heard what I said

I couldn't change your decision
I fought day in day out
Until my knuckles bled
You loved him instead

I don't know what else to do
'Cause I've got nothing left to lose but you

It's alright, it's alright
I was second best but you're still stuck in my head
It's alright, it's alright
Taking slower breathes but I'm still the same mess
All my days are coloured grey
I'll find a way to make you say

It's alright, it's alright
I'll be second best
But you're still fucked in the head

It's alright, it's alright
I'll be second best
But you're still fucked in the head
