We've been waiting for this all year
Now it's about that time so get ready for it
What you've been missing has been right here
Follow the music and the lights living for the moment
Getting shitty on a Saturday
Cross the bridge over to 6th gotta make it happen
Our friends are pulling in the driveway
It's about that time so get this party cracking now

All our friends are out back, get off your ass and let's go
All I'm saying is that I don't think I'll remember at all

After tonight
It's alright, you'll be fine
Just have a good time
After tonight

I've gotta place to crash, everything is set
Hanging out with kids that we just met
So come to the party, bring all of your friends
'Cause tomorrow we'll do it all over again

We leave our worries at the front door
'Cause it's that kind of place that always helps you to remember
What we've been waiting all this time for
Nothing to prove, with my dudes better late than never
I wouldn't have it any other way
Fireworks and skating, never knew what we were thinking
We don't care if it's getting too late
'Cause it's about that time so get this party cracking now

All our friends are out back, get off your ass and let's go
All I'm saying is that I don't think I'll remember at all

After tonight
It's alright, you'll be fine
Just have a good time
After tonight

I've gotta place to crash, everything is set
Hanging out with kids that we just met
So come to the party, bring all of your friends
'Cause tomorrow we'll do it all over again
All over again, let's go!

Never left alone
Never missing home
It helps me to know that I'll stand with my friends till the end

It's about that time so get ready for it
Never live our lives with regret
It's about that time so get ready for it
So get ready for it

After tonight
After tonight
There's nothing left to lose

After tonight
It's alright, you'll be fine
Just have a good time
After tonight

I've gotta place to crash, everything is set
Hanging out with kids that we just met
So come to the party, bring all of your friends
'Cause tomorrow we'll do it all over again
'Cause tomorrow we'll do it all over again
