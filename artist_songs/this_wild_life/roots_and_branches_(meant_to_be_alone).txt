We lay on our backs out on the front yard
Holding your right hand, I say life’s been so hard
The shade of the tree we planted
It grew strong with roots and branches
But it’s just not ours anymore
We build these walls high, they blend into the sky
Thick skin and bones defend us from outside
The way we lost it all, I think it made you strong
But I don’t feel that anymore

I feel nothing at all, yeah I trip and I fall
Running straight into walls while you’re suffering withdrawals
When will I ever get a better hand?
I am losing my hope and it hurts in my throat
Have my back to the coast at the end of my rope
Oh, will I ever be a better man?

Am I meant to be alone?

We lay on our backs on the hood of my car
Holding my right hand, you point out the North Star
Show me the way ahead, guide me with light I said
Cause I can’t see straight anymore
Everyone left me all at once then
Honestly, I couldn’t even blame them
I’ve been a shitty friend
I don’t know where you went
I just can’t handle any more

I feel nothing at all, yeah I trip and I fall
Running straight into walls while you’re suffering withdrawals
When will I ever get a better hand?
I am losing my hope and it hurts in my throat
Have my back to the coast at the end of my rope
Oh, will I ever be a better man?

Am I meant to be alone?
