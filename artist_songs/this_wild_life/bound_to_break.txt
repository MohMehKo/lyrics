You get me so worked up my ears are red hot
Pressure me to be something that I'm not
Well forget it you can't have it I'll never fit your mold
This shit is getting old
I try to be the one that you can count on
I fought it tooth and nail but you were just gone
So forget it you can't have it I'll never be the one
I am the setting sun

I"m reckless and selfish
I'm feeling defenseless
Even at my best
I'm still feeling like a mess
I'm not proud of who I've been
I know I've gotta grow
I live with a temper
That never gets better
It's ripping me to shreds
It's still burning in my head
I'm not proud of who I've been
I know I've gotta grow

I know I overreact to every comment
It takes me deeper than ever into resentment
So forget it you can't have it I'll never fit your mold
This shit is getting old
I know I question myself at every moment
Every flaw on the surface you make me show it
So forget it you can't have it I'll never be the one
I am the rising sun

I'm bound to break if I stay the same
With all my weight I will force a change
Cause in my skin is the sunlight
And in my heart there is still a fight
