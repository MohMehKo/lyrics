Diamonds 'round her neck and she's driving me mad
I would take her out if I got the chance
All night long, I think of what to say
I really think she needs someone like me

To take her out for a quick two-step
Something that she ain't seen yet
I really wanna be her man
Someone who understands, someone who understands
I-I-I'm letting loose, I can't wait to see you...

Shake, shake, shake, shake
Shake, shake, shake, shake
Woo, woo, woo, woo
Woo, woo, woo, woo
Wait, wait, wait, wait
Wait, wait, we've got nothing to lose
Shake, shake, shake, shake
Shake, shake, shake, shake
Woo, woo, woo, woo
Woo, woo, woo, woo
Wait, wait, wait, wait
Wait, wait, we've got nothing to lose

Diamonds 'round her neck and she's here at last
I need to make a move, I'm taking my chance
All night long, I thought of what to say
I really think she's need someone like me

To take her out for a quick two-step
Something that she ain't seen yet
I really wanna be her man
Someone who understands, someone who understands
I-I-I'm letting loose, I can't wait to see you...

Shake, shake, shake, shake
Shake, shake, shake, shake
Woo, woo, woo, woo
Woo, woo, woo, woo
Wait, wait, wait, wait
Wait, wait, we've got nothing to lose
Shake, shake, shake, shake
Shake, shake, shake, shake
Woo, woo, woo, woo
Woo, woo, woo, woo
Wait, wait, wait, wait
Wait, wait, we've got nothing to lose

Listen up, it's my profession, life is never worse wrestling
If you haven't just to make it better then you've got to take it
And shake, move, yeah, you've got those moves
You got those moves that make me say "I love you"
I can't wait, I'm coming through, I'm going...

To take you out for a quick two-step
Something that you ain't seen yet
I really wanna be your man
Someone who understands, someone who understands

Don't stop, don't stop
Someone who understands
Don't stop, don't stop
Someone who understands
Don't stop, shake it
Don't stop, don't stop
Someone who understands
Don't stop, shake it
Don't stop, don't stop
Someone who understands

Shake, shake, shake, shake
Shake, shake, shake, shake
Woo, woo, woo, woo
Woo, woo, woo, woo
Wait, wait, wait, wait
Wait, wait, we've got nothing to lose
(Shake it)
Shake, shake, shake, shake
Shake, shake, shake, shake
Woo, woo, woo, woo
Woo, woo, woo, woo
Wait, wait, wait, wait
Wait, wait, we've got nothing to lose

Shake, show me what to do
Go on move
Go and I'll move
Go and I'll move
Don't stop baby
Don't stop, don't stop
Don't stop baby
Don't stop, don't stop
Don't stop baby
Don't stop, yeah, yeah
Don't stop, don't stop
