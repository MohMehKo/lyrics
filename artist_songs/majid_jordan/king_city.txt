Dressed up, red Corvette
In the middle of the night
Word is out, lay low
It’s just a matter of time
More room for the woman
Gotta hold on tight
Bright lights, King City
I gotta say goodbye to you
You’re so damn special
But you, you’re driving me wild

King City
You’re driving me wild, King City

One way, driving in the middle of the night
Speeding, demon, chasing light
Found me a lady that’ll hold on tight
Bright lights, King City, I better say goodbye to you
You’re so damn special
But you, you’re driving me wild

King City
You’re driving me wild, King City

We really gotta get there
When we gonna get there?
I really gotta see that
I really gotta get there
To see King City
Wild, King City
King

King City
You’re driving me wild, King City
