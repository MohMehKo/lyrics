What are you doing, you're making things seem convoluted
Taking simple throwing it out the window
You fore go an emotional
Hope I may have had your single impulsive decision so vital
Come girl won't you take out your rifle
Shoot down all my high points and
Start with me, start with me
Start with me, start with me
I knew, I knew
I knew, I knew

Oh what a man I used to be
Find me a place to gather my feet
Told you I wanted this, you tell me to leave
But I wouldn't, cause everything was just alright
And I hate you, I knew, I knew
[x2]

In a minute so funk appealing (I knew)
In a minute, (I knew), so funk appealing (I knew)
In a minute, (I knew), so funk appealing (I knew)
In a minute, (I knew), so funk appealing (I knew)
In a minute, (I knew), so funk appealing (I knew)
I knew...
