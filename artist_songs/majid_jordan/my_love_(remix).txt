[Verse 1 - Majid Al Maskati:]
I had an idea in my head
I pictured this going differently
I meant every word that I said
You should have spent more time listening
All the things that I put a hold on
All for you to hit me with a hold on
What makes you so ready right now
After I waited on you for so long

[Chorus - Majid Al Maskati:]
Why you wanna be my love, is it just for show?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love, love
Why you wanna be my love, is it just for show?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love, love

[Interlude - Majid Al Maskati:]
Why you want
Why you want
Why you want
Why you want, love
Why you want
Why you want
Why you want
Why you want, love
Why you want
Why you want
Why you want
Why you want, love
Why you want
Why you want
Why you want
Why you want, love

[Refrain 1 - Majid Al Maskati:]
All the things that I put a hold on
All for you to hit me with a hold on
All the things that I put a hold on
All for you to hit me with a hold on
All the things that I put a hold on
All for you to hit me with a hold on
What makes you so ready right now
After I waited on you for so long

[Interlude]

[Bridge - Drake:]
You got your trophies
I know how you like to show em off and shine em, and line em up
I'm not your trophy, baby
I won't let you show me off or shine me, or line me up, no
You got your trophies
I know how you like to show em off and shine em, and line em up
I'm not your trophy, baby
I won't let you show me off or shine me up, or line me up, no

[Refrain 2 - Majid Al Maskati:]
What makes you so ready right now
After I waited on you for so long

[Outro - Majid Al Maskati:]
Why you want
Why you want
Why you want
Why you want, love
Why you want
Why you want
Why you want
Why you want, love
Why you want
Why you want
Why you want
Why you want, love
Why you want
Why you want
Why you want
Why you want
