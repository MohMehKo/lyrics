Black cloud over my bed
There’s no use trying to pretend
I’m losing myself again
I’m not feeling a hundred percent
Been thinking about what you said
Staring at the beast with teeth blood red
All those things they did
It’s you I try to protect

I’m hoping, I’m not the only one that keeps recalling
All those memories, they used to happen so often
Look at me (look at me), I'm still (I'm still)
Searching, for you (you)

[Chorus:]
I cared for you, when no one did
I swear to you, when no one did
I dare for you, when no one did
I swear to you, I still do (still do)

Black cloud over my head
I’m through trying to pretend
Wishing I could call you again
Please answer when you see my name
Thinking ‘bout what you said
Staring at the beast with teeth blood red
Knowing no one else will stare
A couple hundred people caught up in the past

I’m hoping, I’m not the only one that keeps recalling
I’ve got those days in mind so very often
Look at me (look at me), I'm still (I'm still)
Searching, for you (you)
(For you, for you, for you)

[Chorus]

Broken connections, resurrections
(For you)
Broken connections, resurrections
(For you, for you)

I’m hoping, I’m not the only one that keeps recalling
All those memories, that used to happen so often
Look at me (look at me), I'm still (I'm still)
Searching (for you) for you (you)

[Chorus]

(Still do, still do, I still do)
(I still do, yes, still do, yeah, I still do, yeah)
