Been a long day to run
Where can we be soon
Been a good to run
While they follow beats and they march their drums
Been a good day for fun
While they crowd the streets and they carry guns

You wanted love
Brought us higher
Give us your thief and your liar
You wanted love
You brought us fire
Give us your thief and your liar

Tell you what
Here's the plan
Give you what ever I can
Take it now
No time to waste
Its mine if you misbehave
