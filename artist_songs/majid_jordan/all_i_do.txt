You call, you say, just let it be
I care, I say you mean too much to me
It's real, there's no one else I found

[Hook:]
I feel, really need to figure this out, just you and I
Only wanted to find, whatever makes you smile
Only wanted to find, cause all I ever do is think of you
Too much, you mine, you mine
Cause all I ever do is think of you, my love
You mine, you mine
Help me make it up

How come, you say you need a better man?
When you're the one who came to me for everything
I guess it's true what they say about, the one

[Hook]

I guess we're here, once again
Just two of us talkin'
It's real, there's no one else I found
I feel, we really need to figure this out, just you and I
Only want bathe in silence, only wanna live forever
Only wanna keep things quiet, only wanna be together
Be together, be together...

Cause all I ever do is think of you, too much
You mine, you mine
Cause all ever do is think of you, my love
You mine, you mine
Help me make it up with you
