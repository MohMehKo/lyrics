[Verse/Hook:]
Time is running out on us
Hate to say, we gotta rush again
We'll get there in the end

There's little left of what we have
The good, the bad, the sometimes sad
I'll be there in the end

I'll be there in the end
[Repeat]

[Hook]

I'll be there in the end [4x]

Do you want to be there [2x]
Do you? Do you?

In the end

[Hook]

I'll be there in the end [8x]
