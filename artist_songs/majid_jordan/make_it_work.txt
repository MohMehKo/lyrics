I don't wanna be the one to say
Cause saying it will make it real
Tell me, am I going crazy?
Why do I feel

I've been having lots of troubles here lately
I don't wanna do these things but you make me (You do)
Something in my heart feels vacant
I can't even pretend, no, I won't even pretend

Cause it's just another day
It's just another day
Just another day
All I keep on thinking is work
Make it work, make it work
Make it work, make it work
Make it work, make it work

I'm trying to make a good impression
I don't even know what that would be
I'll give you all of my confessions
Between you and me

I've been having lots of troubles here lately
I don't wanna do these things but you make me
Oh something in my heart feels vacant (Something)
I can't even pretend, no, I won't even pretend

Cause it's just another day
It's just another day
Just another day
All I keep on thinking is work
Make it work, make it work
Make it work, make it work
Make it work, make it work

I make it work with you, make it work with you
I make it work with you, know I-I-I
I make it work with you, make it work with you
Swear you know it's...
Just another day (It's just)
Just another day (Just, just)
Just another day (Not just)
All I keep on thinking is work
Make it work, make it work
Make it work, make it work
Make it work, make it work
I make it work with you, make it work with you

Cause it's just another day (It's just)
It's just another day (Just, just)
Just another day (Not just)
All I keep on thinking is work
Make it work, make it work
(I make it work with you, make it work with you)
Make it work, make it work
Make it work, make it work

I'm tryna make some conversation
