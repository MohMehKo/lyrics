Got no music on the radio
You can't fight what you do now, no
People outside won't let it go
Never forget, never never, no no
No music on the radio
You can't fight what you do now, no
People outside can't let it go
People outside can't let it go
Got no music on the radio
You can't fight what you do now, no
People outside won't let it go
Never forget, never never, no no
No music on the radio
You can't fight what you do now, no
People outside can't let it go
People outside can't let it go

You tried to change the way I feel
I can't feel a thing
You tried to change the way I feel
I can't feel a thing
You tried to make me feel the same
I just cannot feel a thing
You tried to make me feel the same
I just cannot feel a thing
A thing
A thing
A thing (Take control)
A thing
A thing
A thing
(Take control, yeah....of your soul)
