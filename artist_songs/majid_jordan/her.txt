[Hook:]
I got her, in the palm of, my hand
She knows I love her
I got her, thought I lost her, again

But life's so quick, sometimes
Just blinking you might miss it when you close, your eyes
It's been, a while, since we kicked it but the answer's on her lips tonight

[Hook]

I'm on, the way
To finding out exactly how to treat her right
Another day, and I've been waiting
But I've been waiting my whole life, to find
Someone like her

[Hook]

I'm glad we made it this far
Sometimes you just don't know
So many days spent apart but now
I'm finally yours (so won't you)

Move my body, do it right
Left, right, side, side
Not about to waste my time, waiting all night
[x2]

[Hook]

She knows I got her
She knows I love her
She knows I got her
She knows I love her
She knows, she knows
But it's cool because
It's me she loves
She knows, she does
