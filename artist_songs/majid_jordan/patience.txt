It's not your love
It's not for us
It's not our time to give
So I'm not gonna give it up
It's not your love
It's not for us
It's not our time we give
So I'm not gonna give it up

You can try to make me believe
But oh, just turn the cheek
Like you did to me
It's not your love
It's not for us
It's not our time to give
Cause I'm not gonna give it up

Waiting for you felt like it would be easy
But it's so hard
Feeling like I would be there
And now I just don't even care
It's so hard, it's so hard

[Hook]

I can't go to sleep at night, sleep at night
I can't go to sleep at night, sleep at night
Without you it just ain't right, just ain't right
Without you it just ain't right, just ain't right
I can't go to sleep at night, sleep at night
I can't go to sleep at night, sleep at night
Without you it just ain't right, just ain't right
Without you it just ain't right, just ain't right
I can't go to sleep at night, sleep at night (I'm so tired with it all)
I can't go to sleep at night, sleep at night (I'm so tired with it all)
Without you it just ain't right, just ain't right
Without you it just ain't right, just ain't right
I can't go to sleep at night, sleep at night
I can't go to sleep at night, sleep at night
Without you it just ain't right, just ain't right
Without you it just ain't right, just ain't right

Loving you, loving...
It's easy, so easy
Loving you, loving...
It's easy, so easy
Loving you, loving...
It's easy, so easy

It's not your love
It's not for us...
