[Bridge:]
Look at you, tired and you're so confused
Nothing new, everything left to lose
Look at you, tired and you're so confused
Nothing new, everything left to lose

[Hook:]
Give me a reason for loving you
Give me a reason to use
Cause I'd be better off with you I will be
Give me a reason for loving you
Give me a reason to use
Cause I'd be better off with you I will be
Cause I'd be better off with you I will be
Cause I'd be better off with you I will be
Cause I'd be better off with you I will be
Cause I'd be better off with you I will be
Cause I'd be better off with you I will be
Cause I'd be better off with you I will be

[Bridge]

Give me a reason for loving you, yeah [x15]
