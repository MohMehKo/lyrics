Ooh
Everything’s swaggering
Uh

At the crib you can find me
Prolly in the stu
Prolly with the crew, sitting right beside me
Prolly sipping
Prolly got some chos chilling
And those main girls Prolly know, so they stay tripping
Got us on the phone politicking
Saying something slicking
Prolly saying that we can kick it on the weekend and its
Prolly back to the drinking
Back to inking these rhymes
Back to clearing my head
Back to thinking I’m fine
Matter fact I’m good, I feel like a million bucks
I’ll Prolly be making that shit
I’ll Prolly be living it up
Prolly be hearing my name, girls be giving it up
You making irrelevant money, call that Milwaukee bucks
I’m making a name
Prolly making a killing
I’ll be digging the fame
Prolly touching the ceiling
Prolly loving the feeling
Prolly getting it in
Prolly acting a fool
And I Prolly do it again, ha

Prolly, Prolly, Prolly, Prolly getting it
Prolly, Prolly getting it heyy
Getting it, getting it, getting it, getting it woo
Prolly getting it, act like you know

Pool side chilling, 30 rack of brew gone we still killing
Sometimes sunshine’s in the state I’m from
You ain't with that you Prolly dumb, ha haa
Take another sip of the brew
I ain't about the v neck I stick with the crew, ooh
Quit asking who I’m sticking it to
I’m sick of dudes acting bitch made I do what I do, yeeah

Prolly, Prolly, Prolly, Prolly getting it
Prolly, Prolly getting it heyy
Getting it, getting it, getting it, getting it woo
Prolly getting it, act like you know

Gotcha chick like ooh
Gotcha chick like glue
But she ain't sticking to you
She sticking to this dude
Cos I’m sicker than you ha
Ha ha, swag
