Oula, I gotta boula
Chips, rum and cola
Remote controller sitting on a sofa watching Oprah
Talking to 'Hova
Talking about hip-hop
Talking to corner
Talking how he made his money
But he had to kick rocks
Overcame the obstacles
All the gossip possible
Overcame the people that told him it was impossible
I just want to do it to it
And I got less to worry 'bout
We about to get it in
If you ain't with it, hurry - out!
Yeah, yeah, It's show time, no apollo
Geez, just follow me
This ain't halloween
Take the mask off
Fake ass half-off rappers
Talk shit, act hard, back off after
The band wagon filling up
Back off faster
These days I got my twenty-twenty on
You be talking plenty shit
But only when the hennies gone
I fly above it
Matter fact I fuggin' love it
Get your money's worth and then I probably see you out in public
(Get your money's worth and then I probably see you out in public)
Rocking at my shows
You say that you dont like the music
You just like the hoes
I bet you like the mirror then
You getting kinda close
Ha-ha, you bitch-ass
Worst thing I ever did is ditch class
And I still get the bad broads
They want - the bad boys
I'm in - the venue and I'm making mad noise
Get on my damn level
Less trouble give me bass
Got the best show on earth
So I'm yelling: "Give me - space"

It's a lotta rappers talking how they won't shine
I'm the only one doing it so they won't mind
What's the boy to do? Keep Grinding!
Pedal to the metal till that boy to keep grinding
Grinding, till that boy keep grinding
Pedal to the metal till that boy to keep grinding
Grinding, till that boy keep grinding
Pedal to the metal till that boy -

Same old, same old, It's no problemo
I'm hot and I'm faded I'm flamethrowed
You stay current, I change flow
Wait for them and then amigo
Off the handle get to ripping this shit and changing it into this angle
We the shit, what's the smell?
Man they want it, I can tell
They say don't give shit away for free
But Imma do it, what the hell?
Power to the people Moe
I gotta tell it how it is so the people know
Yeah, yeah, this is my shit
I don't want some crowd, man
I want my spit
I know it's the Sunroom
But I'm still going
So what if I'm the underdog, man
I'm still going
You might not know but it's my time
I give you hot rhymes 'n hot lines
I kill beats and kill mic's without trying
Say something
I dont hear it though
Closer than my dreams but I still ain't near it though
So I work harder than the competition, here we go!
(Work harder than the competition, here we go!)
Off to the races
I'm on my shake and bake
Ricky Bobby on them choes
Gas in the tank
And I'm on fire, nobody is as hot as me
Projecting first overall in the lottery
But I stay cool
The only way they call me a bus is when I take them to school
So no darcos
Non-stop shots till the bar close
For the crew that'll never leave my side like cargos are gone

It's a lotta rappers talking how they won't shine
I'm the only one doing it so they won't mind
What's the boy to do? Keep Grinding!
Pedal to the metal till that boy to keep grinding
Grinding, till that boy keep grinding
Pedal to the metal till that boy to keep grinding
Grinding, till that boy keep grinding
Pedal to the metal till that boy -
