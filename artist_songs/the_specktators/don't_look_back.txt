It was never like
"When I grow up I'mma be a rapper
Make hits for new school and backpackers
Get chicks and rap magazine covers
Sell out shows, the whole scene love us"
It was more like
Good grades, hoopin'
Free time out in the driveway shootin'
Live for the summertime
Wake up, nothing to do? Go to sleep, do it another time
But time moved on and we reminisced
Like "remember that?" or "remember this?"
Living in the past wasn't cutting it
Saw it coming and I had to get in front of it
Committed to the task now
Built it from the ground up
Took a leap of faith, never lookin' back down
Fought it everyday, still do
Scared of what'll happen if this shit fall through

[Hook:]
All my dreams could be gone in an instant
How did I let it all slip away?
Hell no
Oh my damn, this that shit
Don't look back, I don't miss that shit
Oh my damn, this that shit
Don't look back, I don't miss that shit
Oh my damn, this that shit
Don't look back, I don't miss that shit
Oh my damn, this that shit
Don't look back

It's not easy, nobody believe me
I said I would drive, nobody gave the keys to me
Push, everybody got two pennies though
Every rapper got a Bentley and a centerfold
Crib down in South Beach, hundred thousand dollar chain
I just wanna eat good, I just wanna rock J's
They don't hear me though, let me say it loud
"Look, Mom, Dad, I'm a rapper, aren't you proud?"
I'mma break the mold though
Childhood gang name, same damn logo we started with
Look where we are with it
I pack everything I own in my car and split
They can talk but they can't say shit to me, that shit don't get to me
Need this pen that I write with to get me the right side of history

[Hook]

Ain't no way we fallin' off now
Put your hands in the sky tonight
Ain't no way we fallin' off now
Say the word and we ride tonight
Ain't no way we fallin' off now
Put your hands in the sky tonight
Ain't no way we fallin' off now
Say the word and we ride tonight
Don't look back, don't look back

[Hook:]
Oh my damn, this that shit
Don't look back, I don't miss that shit
Oh my damn, this that shit
Don't look back, I don't miss that shit
Oh my damn, this that shit
Don't look back, I don't miss that shit
Oh my damn, this that shit
Don't look back
