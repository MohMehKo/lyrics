Do-do that thang, girl move your body
Whoa girl move your body, n bring it over to papi
I’m tryna make you my main, my main shorty
I ain’t leavin this party till your numbers in my pocket
But I don’t know your name, but I know you got it
Whoa girl I know you got it, so let me claim it and cop it
And I don’t know who you came with, but I know one thing
You should leave with me yeah

That thang, that thang you do, I can’t put my finger on it
But every time the DJ plays a banger, you lay claim up on it
It’s like the dance floor has your name upon it
Girl I got the picture, but its nothing without your frame upon it
Dang you got that thing, got them lames hangin on ya
They keep pulling money out, and you? You keep drankin on em hah
I see that passion for your fashion’s great
You could wear seven belts, and you’d still fascinate
I don’t know what it is, and you don’t gotta tell us
You got the fellas, and you got the ladies hella jealous
Cuz girl you got that thang, got that body language
I can read it read it, and I know exactly what it’s sayin
Quit playin, girl I just want your name
I’m not worried about where you’re going, I’m just happy that you came
And if you let me get to know you, I can make you feel the same
But for now just do it, do it, d-do it, do that thang, ay!

Do-do that thang, girl move your body
Whoa girl move your body, n bring it over to papi

But I don’t know your name, but I know you got it
Whoa girl I know you got it, so let me claim it and cop it
And I don’t know who you came with, but I know one thing
You should leave with me yeah

Look around and I caught your eye, don’t try to act like I’m not your guy
You’re so fly, that’s no lie
Only reason that this girl’s by my side cuz she’s not so shy
She’s not mine
Look over here and see me not tryin
She’s selling out, I’m not buying. I am only eyein you
Tryin to get a sign or two, dyin to get behind you
You’re just buying your time, tryin to be deciding who you’re about to ride with
I could be your sidekick. Put you on some fly shit, I could be your pilot
Take these 7 d-d-digits down, and you can d-d-dial it
Cuz th-th-th-that thang is calling and you know I’m picking up
These other chicks in the club are thick but you know they ain’t thick enough
You’re so good at being bad, and I ain’t mad at it
Got you permanently on my mind it’s like I tatted it
Ooh baby, ooh baby I see me with you baby
What you say we get the crew and bid this place ado baby? Yeah
I ain’t think that thing would get me but it did
Now I gotta kick it with you girl and find out what it is

Do-do that thang, girl move your body
