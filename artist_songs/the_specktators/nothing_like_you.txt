[Verse 1: Packi]
I know
You gotta lotta men tryna get at you
But none of them understand you like I do
Like I do
And you know me better than anyone has ever known me before
I swear it's true, I swear it's true
So don't ask me
About the past, girl
I've already told you about the last girl
She ain't nothing like you, how could she be? [x2]
Nothing like you

[Verse 2: MirImage]
She ain't nothin', she ain't nothin' but a friend, we had something in the past
Don't make it more than what it is
Girl I care for you, you know I'm there for you
ain't nobody else gettin' this love for you
Girl why you actin' so damn insecure?
She's pretty but you're way more beautiful
Don't let these girls
(Get in your mind)
They just met
(I made you mine)
You ain't gotta worry 'bout a damn thing

[Hook: MirImage]
She ain't nothing like you, how could she be? [x4]

[Verse 3: Packi]
Okay, look, baby
You know we talk still and you think I'm crazy
I'm not though
You worried every time I looked at my phone
I thought so
Wish that I was perfect, but I'm not, though
Gotta quit your worrying, gotta know I'm into you
If I don't be answering my phone then I got shit to do, do
That I call you back when I'm done, though
I'm running late to that one show, and my gas tank, that run low
And I miss you in that front row
But I kiss you when I'm backstage
That girl just a chapter of my life, you every last page
Girl focus, you know this
They see you and they notice you the shit girl, the coldest
I'm tryin' not to blow this
She ain't nothin'
Nah, she ain't nothin'
She ain't nothin'
She ain't nothing like you
Oh, oh, oh, oh
She ain't nothin'
Nah, she ain't nothin'
She ain't nothin
She ain't nothing like you
