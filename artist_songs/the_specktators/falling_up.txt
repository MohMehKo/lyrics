Falling, oh oh oh oooh oooh ooh
Oh oh oh oooh oooh ooh falling, falling
I’ll feel like I’m falling up
I’ll feel like I’m falling up
I’ll feel like I’m falling up
Falling up, falling up (yeah)

I’ll feel like I’m falling up
I’ll feel like I’m falling up
I’ll feel like I’m falling up
Falling up, Falling up [x2]

Uh
So I’m feeling good, I’m great as gravy
They say chill, but I say craaazy
I say pay me, baddist chick here that’s my baby
What’s good?
I had one more drink than I Prolly should
But I feel amazing
I’m fucking with this party so its banging
Yeah that’s right, ain't went this hard since last night
Like, I’m on some newness
They talk it, we do this
Walk in like who this dude is
We the speck, I thought you knew this
I thought you knew this
Better recognize what this crew is
Talk business about it
Talk about my shows they crowded
Talk about my shit, but just know your bitch can’t live without it
I live for this I’m in that moment
(In that zone) I’m in that zone and
Feels like we made it d-don’t it
Another level that I’m on it

I’ll feel like I’m falling up
I’ll feel like I’m falling up
I’ll feel like I’m falling up
Falling up, Falling up [x4]

Messing with my crew, crew
Putting heads on that new, new
Buzzing like that brew do
Got your woman doing that voodoo
Like oh, my damn, this was never part of that plan
But I take it, take it, I take it and I stay away from fake shit
Like word, that’s real, how that feel, like the sweetest thing
Team of the year, and every verse I write is sweet sixteen
That’s nothing, I’m cruise control keeping it a hundred
Trying tell me what to do but they ain't gunna
Every rapper got that team, but my team they rush it
And every rappers talking weed, but I’m a be the bluntest
They jocking us, we on stage, they rock with us
We in the stu, they blog it up
We got that heat, we fogging up

I’ll feel like I’m falling up
I’ll feel like I’m falling up
I’ll feel like I’m falling up
Falling up, Falling up [x8]
