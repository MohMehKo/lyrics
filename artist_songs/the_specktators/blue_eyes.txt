[Verse 1: Packi]
Okay. See, see
I was never looking for someone to call my lady
But you came into my life and all I can think about is you lately
That free spirit, I like
You just keep it up, and I might
Turn one night into a lifetime, making you feel alright
You're fresh off of that break up, and you're living life for yourself now
Independent, that grown woman, you too mature for that meltdown
Single life and you 'bout it
Friends got you surrounded
Act like it's a coincidence, you always at the bar that I'm found at
It's cool though, I'm right there with you
Nights like these always get your hopes up and those walls down
Fell right back into love, go figure
But you, got me, feeling it, too
I don't know if it's just the ambiance, or that record on, or it's you

[Hook: Knox]
I'll be blown away
Into another place
When I see your face
And your blue eyes, your blue eyes
The stars come crashing down
I'll still be around
Cause I can't help to drown
In your blue eyes, your blue eyes

[Verse 2: Packi]
I'm all types of caught up in this moment
Don't want it to end and we go our separate ways
Ask your friends if they'll let you stay
I'mma need another minute of your time to blow your mind and make you mine
I swear I've never done this previously, so please don't leave, I know you'll miss me
That's a garuntee, you'll stay there with me, we'll be care and free, love
I'm addicted to everything you do, I'm in need of that drug
Ocean deep in those blue eyes
Not a cloud in those blue skies
Looking at you, I think I finally found out where that truth lies

[Hook: Knox]
I'll be blown away
Into another place
When I see your face
And your blue eyes, your blue eyes
The stars come crashing down
I'll still be around
Cause I can't help to drown
In your blue eyes, your blue eyes

[Verse 3: Knox]
My love goes on, and on, and on [2x]
My love goes on, and on, and on, and on, my love

[Verse 4: Packi]
My love goes on, and on, and on [2x]
My love goes on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on
And I say, don't fight, don't fight the feeling
Don't fight, don't fight the feeling [3x]
My love goes on, and on, and on [2x]
My love goes on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on [fade out]
