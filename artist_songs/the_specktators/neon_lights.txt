Lights, camera, action, gon tell me when to go
This is our year, boy, if ya didn’t know
I hop in the whip n go, rollin down the win-a-dow
City full of hopefuls, lookin for a winner though
Guess it’s L-Town, cuz to win in it is difficult
But I’m not your typical, I am the reciprocal
Iller than the realest spitter, really every syllable
Everything I say is real, some of it is literal
Most of you are fake, so my circle’s at a minimal
What you gonna do? I'mma be the man
Young dude with my green tight. Peter Pan
Taking off and I’ll never land, never land
Effo-effort turned my dream into the effi-effin plan

From a dream to the real thing, I see my name in them neon lights
Livin life in the fastlane, they say I changed, but I’ll be alright
Put my name in the neon, neon
Get a hold of my crew, tell em we on, we on, hey
Pack your bags we gon be on flights
To the biggest cities, lookout for these neon lights aahh
Ne-on, Ne-on, Ne-on…lights, where they at?

Maaaan, I’ve been ready for this moment
People had their shot sh-shot and they missed on it
I was working my ass off. They dissed on it
But when I make it I bet they want an assist on it
Maaaan, you must be J-Kidding
You say hold up, me say get it
You say do it, me say did it
City in my palm boy, middle of the mitten
Whatchu know about that man? I see through you feline’s like cat scans
That’s why I kept my crew close
Soon as I make this bread, we gon have a new toast, yup

From a dream to the real thing, I see my name in them neon lights 
Livin life in the fastlane, they say I changed, but I’ll be alright 
Put my name in the neon, neon 
Get a hold of my crew, tell em we on, we on, hey 
Pack your bags we gon be on flights 
To the biggest cities, lookout for these neon lights aahh

I wanted this since I could listen to a rap song
Chillin with my headphones still in, backpack on
Now I’m on stage with a frickin snapback on
People in their whips with a frickin Speck track on, dang
Everybody know what my slang is, sayin my name, know who my gang is
I just wanna be famous
Money talks, and pretty soon it’ll be speaking my language
You could talk shit, but I speaka no lame-ish
Your girlfriend ain’t leavin with who she came with
Haters never gonna get to me
You could stay pissed at me, cuz you ain’t shit to me. What now?

From a dream to the real thing, I see my name in them neon lights 
Livin life in the fastlane, they say I changed, but I’ll be alright 
Put my name in the neon, neon 
Get a hold of my crew, tell em we on, we on, hey 
Pack your bags we gon be on flights 
To the biggest cities, lookout for these neon lights aahh

Big city dreamin. All the lights beamin
I like the feelin. What a nice evening
Big city dreamin. All the lights beamin
I like the feelin. I like the feelin

I like the feeling, I’ll forever let it last
I'mma treat it like a dummy, I'mma never let it pass
You could take it to the bank, you could throw it off the glass
I'mma take it to the top and I'mma do it awful fast
That’s…that’s…that’s where I'mma try and go
Me, money, and music, that’s a love triangle
Haha haha I got a lot to buy
You can’t block the fresh, you can’t swat the fly
Ain’t no ‘I’ in stop, ain’t no stopping I
Purchase me some diamonds, call that rock-a-bye
Bye-bye to the broke days and the no ways, hello to the okays
Bye to the middle of winter wishin for snow days
Hi to the, hi to the, hi to the show days
Bye to the slow days, hi to my fast life ticket
And hi to the chicks with a ass like Nicki, ha

From a dream to the real thing, I see my name in them neon lights
Livin life in the fastlane, they say I changed, but I’ll be alright
Put my name in the neon, neon
Get a hold of my crew, tell em we on, we on, hey
Pack your bags we gon be on flights
To the biggest cities, lookout for these neon lights aahh
Ne-on, Ne-on, Ne-on
