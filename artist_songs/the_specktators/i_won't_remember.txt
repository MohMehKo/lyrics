The word is we gettin' wild tonight
It's gettin' loud
I might get in the crowd, alright then

[Hook:]
I'm gone, I know that, keep goin'
Don't hold back
Don't hold back
Don't hold back
Tonight
I won't remember a thing at all
I won't remember a thing at all
A thing at all

Yea, Uh
So what I'm tipsy?
Tell me what the lic read
I'm in there no question
No time for second guessing
No doubt about it
I'm bided by it
Done did so and I'm wasted
I'm ridin' round and
I'm out of town
But my people here
They embrace it
Alright then, let's do it
Big as hell tonight then
I don't need that taxi
Or that back seat
Or that ride, then
It's on and it's popin'
Hands up and bass droppin'
Face melt and place hoppin'
Help me out, say somethin'
Ok [x3]

[Hook]

Yea
I'm good off that brew
Who got the liquor?
I'm off that too
We go hard, don't be shy
You came with us, so I thought you knew
Girls all on that DJ
With that fat ass, that DK
That's automatic, that's PK
So we run it back like replay
Alright then, let's do it
Big as hell tonight then
I'mma need that whiskey, Coke, vodka and Sprite then
It's like that, for really
No hands on the willy
They all know the dealy
Say somethin' if you feel me

[Hook]
