Uh…we used to be so perfect
I would give you anything, but you were so worth it
Talkin to you, girl, I was so nervous
Even if I never showed it on the surface
That was the purpose, I had to be cool
I had to learn how to love, had to be schooled
I had it bad, I had to be with you
I thought you were the one, guess I had to be fooled. Dang
And it’s never been the same
You took a lot of me, but you never took blame
You took aim at my heart, bang
Now it’s heartbreak, and a need fresh start (start) for my heart’s sake
And it’s hard to take, cuz God knows, girls like you are hard to make
Nowadays I wake up, and I’m on my own
No more good morn-in texts, waitin on my phone
And I know you’re (Gone)

Look to my right side just to realize you’re… (Gone)

I wanna forget ya, get ya outta my head and outta the picture
The problem is, when I try and sleep,I think about your promises
And honestly theres a lotta things ya didn’t keep
You said you’d be there, so I took the leap
We said a lot of shit maybe talk is cheap
Maybe I should known I was in too deep
But every time ya fall in love the hills too steep
Now I’m dealing with the consequence
I guess I shoulda had some common sense
To know at some point you would drop the bomb
And since ya did, I haven’t been able to get rid of the memories
You pretend to be a friend to me now, but you’re never defending me
When did we become enemies…girl
What MADE ya CHANGE your mind was it them or me?
I don’t know, used to make me stay now I gotta go?

Look to my right side just to realize you’re… (uhuh, man)

And it’s all the same
When we’re together, you never stay
You just walk away, how could you just walk away
Yeah it’s all the same
When we’re apart I go insane
Just wanna be your everything
Haha… but
