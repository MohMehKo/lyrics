Palm trees out my window, never thought I be here right now
Balcony with my dream team, can't help but think it's our year right now
Girls I ain't really talk to back home all wanna hit my phone right now
Tellin' me that they miss me, beggin' me to come home right now
I know they want what they can't have but it's good for my ego
She tell me that she love me after every glass of that Vino
And I love that shit for real even though I don't love that chick for real

I'm on Pacific time
(Coolin' with the homies, got a brew in my hand)
Pacific time
(Way before they knew about me, I knew I was the man)
Feels like we, meant to be
Here in the city of Angels, home of the Dodgers
Straight out of the winter in Michigan
Where they park the cars in the garages
I be on the 405, November night with windows down
Girls wanna play games still? That's cool with me
Cause I win those now
I'm so

[Hook:]
PA-CI-FI-C
I'm out here chillin'
You know where the 'F' I be [x4]
Pacific time

Like working these bars, they said that won't take me far
But I'm further than I've ever been and I'm steady climbin' these charts
Times like right now, I'm nice right now
Be dumb If I took your advice right now
Small circle, my team good
So don't look at me for a slice right now
Fresh out of these stake holders, know every name on my payroll
And these girls tell me they catchin' flights to come see me and then layover
Bullshit but I entertain it
They blow smoke but I can explain it
They know the kid about to blow so they make arrangements
Pacific time

(Coolin' with the homies, got a brew in my hand)
Pacific time
(Way before they knew about me, I knew I was the man)
Feels like we, meant to be
Here in the city of Angels, home of the Lakers
We gonna take off
Only question is how long it'll take us
Meantime, I put emotions to the side
Replace that with a ocean to the side
What a view right? We do the do-right crew
Give a damn what you like
I'm so

Shoutout my people in MI that ride for me
I know the people that'd die for me
Hollywood got a monopoly on what I'm tryna be
That's why I'm movin' in on all of they property
Probably question the timing, it's not early
Everything I do, I do that shit properly
Look what I gave you for free
You can't be mad at me now that I'm eating my broccoli
Mixtape prodigy, you don't mind
I like albums don't lie to me
I'mma be putting them out until no one on top of me
All of the local kids all wanna copy me
Most of the locals here show 'em what not to be
That's why this rappin' is more than a job to me
Sign a deal now man, that's basically robbing me
First one to sign me is hitting the lottery
Boy
I'm so
