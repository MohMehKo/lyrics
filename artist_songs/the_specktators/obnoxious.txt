Oh shit, this is so not proper
Kickin' it with the mitten state showstopper
Michigan repper, middle of the hand
Thumbs up to your cho, middle finger to the man
Yessir
Lookout bro, the pen’ll kill
Sleeping on the fire man? This ain’t even been a drill
Way over your head, like some bad brain
You’re not on the bandwagon yet, that’s a damn shame
But that’s fine, that’s fine, that’s fine
You’ll be hittin snooze for the last time, last time
You call your chick daily, I call that chick mine
If I put the D-on then she’ll call me Primetime
Man you couldn’t kill the cat if you hit it nine times
I’m an emcee, squared, so she give me Einstein
This shit right here? It’s perfect-o
Put it on a blank check, I'mma be successful

Whoa, you know what it is
I got this. (What?) Hotness. Go ahead stop this
Nah, you know what is bro
You know what is ho, you know what it is, you know, you know (whoa)
I got-I got-I got-I got got this
(What?) The throne boy, go ahead watch this
I mean I’m thrown boy, faded, unconscious
I mean I’m in my zone, K? I’m obnoxious

Oh, you bit off a little more than you could chew
I could take your flow and do it better than what you could do
Look at you, lookin' at me, what is it you staring at
I look at you only cause I wonder why you’re wearing that
Dang, I’m in a different league than these other boys
And I’m tired of hiding it, time for me to make some noise
Bang
Put my foot in the game, now I’m a shoe-in
I can’t stop doing my thang
Packi, locked in the stu writin' fuego
They don’t like to say it, but guarantee you they know
So they don’t step on the team
Or maybe they do, but it don’t make a blip on the screen
For real, I don’t know what the deal is
Your shit was wack, then you talked, now it still is
Zip it up, your jaws droppin, pick it up
Take the camera for me and Moe, your chick wants a pic of us, bitch

Whoa, you know what it is
I got this. (What?) Hotness. Go ahead stop this
Nah, you know what is bro
You know what is ho, you know what it is, you know, you know (whoa)
I got-I got-I got-I got got this
(What?) The throne boy, go ahead watch this
I mean I’m thrown boy, faded, unconscious
I mean I’m in my zone, K? I’m obnoxious

This ain’t even difficult
I be runnin' through these bars like they were invisible
Turnin' heads, what is this a physical?
Music is medicinal
But get me on a beat and it's condition will be critical
Cause I stay floss like dentists do it
And I rock mics like Lenox Lewis
But I never tie-son, I'mma stay getting wins for the city I’m from
How about that
I’ll be an outcast till I count stacks
Sippin on, damn I cannot even pronounce that
Trampoline booties, look at how they bounce back
Imma do it big, I don’t see how you could doubt that
Gimme hotels and the whole crew (Gimme that)
Gimme warm weather and a cold brew (Gimme that)
And a dope stu (yup), and some cool choes (hey)
I could say the name (REFS), but you already know

Whoa, you know what it is
I got this. (What?) Hotness. Go ahead stop this
Nah, you know what is bro
You know what is ho, you know what it is, you know, you know (whoa)
I got-I got-I got-I got got this
(What?) The throne boy, go ahead watch this
I mean I’m thrown boy, faded, unconscious
I mean I’m in my zone, K? I’m obnoxious
