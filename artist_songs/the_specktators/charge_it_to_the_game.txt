I know you think you bad, I know I told you that
We could do some things, but don't let it go to your head, girl
You looking at the come up, everything the same
But we about to blow and so tonight we charge it to the game

[Hook:]
Charge it to the game, charge it to the game
Charge it to the game, it'll never be the same
Charge it to the game, charge it to the game
Charge it to the game, want the money and the-money and the
Charge it to the game, charge it-charge it to the game
Charge it to the game, charge it-charge it to the game
Charge it to the game, charge it-charge it to the game
Charge it to the game, it'll never be the same

Don't let me get in my zone, don't let me get in my zone
You can ask me about other girls but don't ever get in my phone
That's how you lose me now
'Cuz I got a buzz hotter than a bad bitch up in a jacuzzi now
When I'm on the come up, I could buy the whole bar
So I did, and my boys like "Excuse me? How?"
Damn, I'm a loose cannon these days, success got me used up
Got a few people hanging around me I ain't never seen and a couple things I ain't used to
Gotta get a grip before the kid slip
Drop the ball, the come ups, the process, not to fall
But I never got shit when I shopped at mall
But I couldn't choose a fit so I copped them all
That's ballin' to me like Hov callin' to me
Saying hold the Roc up but that's stallin' to me
I've been waiting patient, ain't hear my songs on the radio station
Ain't it ironic how they get a boy to run around
But they never wanna give me rotation?
Ain't it ironic how they hesitate to get me on the stage
And I get a standing ovation? Yeah
Proving 'em wrong since day one
So when they tell me that I ain't got the money for it
I tell 'em that I know, but I'm coming for it
Running for the pay dirt, say word I don't [?] my bank broke 'cuz
But I play her, so please don't say shit to me
Everybody telling me that I better slow down
Even my people can't get to me
I just

[Hook]

Charge it to the game, want the money and the-money and the
Fame and the fortune, rolling down Rodeo breaking necks
I don't make no friends, I make connects
I'mma go from taking shit to taking meetings with execs
I've been hot since'97, word to Flex!

I am a problem, I'mma keep knocking until somebody open up
I'mma get a mill at 25, I did everything before I was old enough
This ain't a front, this ain't a flex
This is me saying I'm next, this is me knowing I'm dope, saying I'm blessed
This is me feeling myself, this is me banging my chest
This is me going too far, this is me losing myself
This is me drinking too much, this is me losing my health
Rap game underdog, going on the heavyweight champ
I ain't losin' my belt!
You can take it to the bank, bet that
Charge it to the game
Used to spell the name wrong on flyers, now it's on the check
They know my name, yup
Moe-T said it's time to step my-my game up
So when I look back on this year, this gon' be the year we came up
