Look
I try to be fly, I try to be floss
I can’t speak intern
I try to be boss
The problem is, life’s like Twitter
Everyone’s a follower
And we’re always running out of characters
So I’mma be a breath of fresh air for you, inhale
Name a rapper with more bars who’s not in jail
I drop on any mix like it’s half white, half black
Run through lines like a mad type, halfback
Snap from the track like the center in a shotgun
My flow’s rare, it’s not done
You got ice man, I’m top gun
You got ice man, I’m top gun
This is that heart attack flow
Yeah, that hot sauce
Never had a shark attack, yo, but I drop jaws
Wait stop pause, let me tell you something funny, uh
When someone with no dough raps about all their money
Stop lying, you ain’t rich dummy
I already know you’re good for nothing like your chicks tell me
Yeah

Let it ride, I’mma keep going
I got one more

Don’t even hit nofe[?]
Don’t flip like
Uh
I kinda like that acapella shit
I give all my work for free, I don’t sell a bit either
Your girl works for me, she ain’t sell a bit neither
Sometimes I’m on that mellow shit
Tonight I brought the fellows wit
But I don’t need no fellowship to tell I’m sick, hell’o quit, yeah
Who am I, just a common attraction
On top of my bars, numerator of the fractions, yeah
They say I’m too pop, too electronic
I say I’m too hot and I’m too chronic
You ain’t no 2Pac, yo dufonics
You think your shit’s sick, then I’ll poop on it
I got that bubonic, that contagious shit
I got that high caging, engaging shit
Set fire to the page and the stage and shit
But still, still
It’s hard for me to get a break knowing that I can’t stop
Hard for me to take charge knowing that I can’t flop
Got a foot in the door, but I’m never a shoe in
There’s still a lot of people who haven’t been clued in-to the movement
The plan, the blueprint for improvement
Sit back, relax, and I’ll prove it
Yeah, that’s the proof
Right
