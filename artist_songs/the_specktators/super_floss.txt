Yeah, ey, turn my headphones up!
Floss, always Floss!
Ain't nobody messin with me when I grip the pen
I'm the illa illest shit to hit this city in a min
I'm the bomb ay? Sippin on gin spittin synonyms
Sleeping on me dumby? Time to get your second wind
I've been winning for a minute, you not on your second win
You don't have a W, ya reckon that I'm wreckin it
I reckon that you're checkin me out, I'm just checkin in
Youngin in the game so they tell me I'm developing
Hell if I'mma stay irrelevant
To these unintelligent benedicts
Acting like they know rap and they invented it
Wanna be a hip-hop head? Then get ahead of it
Either way hater stay the hell out of my element
Yeah!
I'mma shine boy, you ain't getting none of it
Automatic with my 16's, like a gun in it
This is my town and I'm runnin it
Ain't no gaps in my raps, they wouldn't be holy with a nun in it
Skip the hook, I'mma flow to the fullest
My words are my weaponry, boatload of bullets
Finger on the trigger
Mess with me and it's a recipe for me to teach a lesson
G I'll go ahead and pull it bang!
Wussup...that's your girl that your cussin out
You're mad she's at my show to see what all the fuss about
Front row in that shirt that she's busting out
That'll teach you to trust a ho, man shut your mouth
I ain't for no games bro keep it to yourself
Why you wearing baby GAP, keep those clothes on your shelf
Hah I'm only kidding, but really tho
Drop it to the floor baby, go'on take it really low
Yeah I'm just living life and enjoying it
Staying sucker free and it works like I'm employing it
Okay. Word I'mma kid from the burbs
I don't hide it, I just take a beat and ride it better than the herbs
Get it through your thick head I'mma problem
Don't tie me to wack dudes cuz I'm not them
Gon tie me to my crew cuz I got them
REFS in this Beotch. Boy that's the squadron
And I'm the emcee that ya slept on
Better get up or expect to be stepped on
I'm prepped with a pep in my step now
So step down, I take a big city, turn it to a Speck town
What you know about the kid who spits spherical lyrical circles
Around these turtles, guess I'll be the hare in this race
If you don't see me, you got hair in your face
I don't need a scrabble board to put a square in his place
You got a chip on your shoulder, and got a ape on your back
I got my city on my shoulder, and a cape on my back
You wanna step to Superman, you'll get a lesson, infact
I got a message for you hacks, you ain't messing with Shaq
My shit is super floss, my shit is super floss
I don't speak in turn, I'm a super boss
Super this, super that, let's get super sauced
My shit is super floss, my shit is super floss
My shit is super floss
