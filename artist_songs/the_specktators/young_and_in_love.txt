Wussup cutie? What you up to?
Not much huh? You should come thru
We could rent a flick, maybe cuddle up
It's whatever girl, we got that puppy love
Yup, I just gotta hold you
I still got a lotta things that I gotta show you
You don't really know me
I don't really know you
But I think I like that
And I know you like it too
Cuz we...not worried bout a damn thing
She could give damn bout what another man think
It's all about us two
Just me, plus you
We could do whatever girl
I ain't tryna rush you at all
And I ain't tryn be an adult
Two kids playin around, layin around
Doing nothing but laughin and paintin the town
I put that smile there, nobody takin it down

We just...young and in love [7x]

What you wanna do? Mall or the movies?
Take a lil walk in the fall with the cool breeze
I'm good, long as you are
Bring you to my old hood, take you on a tou-ar (tou-ar, tou-ar)
And that's Speck shit
When I'm with you, I ain't worried bout the next chick
I don't even see one...I'm seein reruns of this
Ain't no telling what's gon become of this
All I know, I want me some of this
Get my friends to come meet some of this
Summer love, but the heart knows no season
Now the colors on the trees leavin
Talkin to you on the phone for no reason
I don't mind
We've been waiting for this love a long time
So let's overdose
They said we couldn't be young and in love
I'll take both of those hah

We just...young and in love [7x]

It really ain't complicated
Ain't no point in that, no point in that
Ain't no point in that, nah ain't no point in that, no point in that
This love ain't complicated
Ain't no point in that, no point in that
Ain't no point in that, nah ain't no point in that, no point in that
