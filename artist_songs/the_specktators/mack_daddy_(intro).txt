Uh
Mack Daddy in the building,
Sunroom flow, yeah give you that feeling,
Oh so appealing,
Jump touch the ceiling,
5 bucks to my name feel like a million damn,
Pull up to the spot like the man,
You pull up to the spot like ham,
Ladies like hey, play my jam,
I’ll be like, I’ll be like, I’ll be like urr yes mam

Where the squad at whodewho
Prolly where the broads at with the bootydoo I’m a
Little late, feeling the gift faded
See a lot of ladies looking beautiful girl
What’s cracking, whole lot of nothing
Said you really don’t gotta man, but you bluffing
I don’t really give a daaaamn, I’m posted
I’m about to get ass time and she knows it like wow
For now I’m a chill out
Fill up the solo boy, let it spill out
Relax everything’s alright
Its the return of the Mack and I’ll be here all night like..

[Fading:]
Be here all night like [x6]
