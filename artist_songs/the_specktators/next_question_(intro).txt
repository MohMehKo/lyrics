It’s my time, bout to give you that, wait hold up, wait bring it back
K I’m ready now, here we go again, now I’m settled down, now I’m goin in
K the truth is, I’m nervous
What if this don’t serve it’s purpose
What if it’s worthless, what have I learned man
What have I earned man, do I deserve this?
Uh...Gee, I don’t know
But..Gee, I do G-O
So hard you can’t knock that
Turning down shows, what you know bout that
Not about the cheese, I’m all about the craft
All about the floss, not about the plaques
Not about the glam, not about the glitz
I’m all about the fam, I’m all about the hits
Next Question, where the REFS at?
That’s your girlfriends ass? Where the rest at?
This is my time, my zone, my city, my home
But I’m gone…till I make it to the tip top
Till the wheels fall off and I need a pit stop
This hip hop…it’s my drug
And I can’t get enough, I’m addicted to the love…and the hate
And the hugs and the shakes
And the phonies and the fakes
But I know I got the homies and they won’t let me fail
They got me on track, and I won’t derail
Got me like sonic, I don’t chase tail
Tail chase me cuz they think I’m ill (eww)
Hah and that’s real
So this life, I gotta have it
When you see my CD, gotta grab it
When you see me, see Packi
I ain’t change, I just picked up a new habit
I'm gonna wreak havoc on this rap shit
Man everything I want I’m gonna have it
Then I'mma be ballin in Florida
Cuz the way I heat verse is magic
Packi are you the illest?
Uhuh
Packi are you the realest?
Uhuh
Packi shouldn’t you be getting more attention?
Uh…you’re damn right next question
