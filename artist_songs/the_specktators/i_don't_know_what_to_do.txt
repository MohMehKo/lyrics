Yeah
You ever have a girl that...you just can't get off your mind
You saw her that one time...but you know she's gotta be the one right?

How can I get to you?
Touch you, feel you, admit to you
I see you see you in my sleep, think of you all night
You're my spark in the dark, my match; I don't need the light
Then I wake up, open my eyes, and we break up
But I'm excited for tonight when we make up
You and me gonna be caked up
Why can't you be in my life though?
Stop hiding in my dreams at night yo
I'm rising high tryna get my sunshine
That's you. Gotta find you...make you mine
I'm flyin high tryna go for you, but when I touchdown I'mma go for two
Cuz I want it all and my all is you Ms. Flawless
I don't know what to do

[Hook:]
I don't know what to do
Yeah
About this dream and you
I wish it would come true
Somebody help me out yeah
Somebody help me out please
For real tho
You got me, You got me
You got me, girl you got me

You got me so caught up
Feels like I'm drownin, soak it up
Dreamin about you, so I don't get up
My eyes stay closed, they don't open up
So maybeeee
I'll see you again
Stories in my head
I think you're the end
Or I want ya to be
I ain't tryna be friends
You're my dream girl
So I'm tryna see you in bed
Hah get it? Good
I really should
Wake up, but it's just getting really good
Somebody pinch me
She in love with me
Which me? This me? Or the me in this dream?
I gotta figure it out
Like what do I do?
How do I say, what I really feel about you?
I just don't know baby
You might not be real, but then maybe...

[Hook]

Alright, I wanna wine and dine you
But I'm outside my mind tryna find you
Some love is blind. Mine is too, but mine is true
What would I do if life was minus you?
Why would God put you in my dreams but choose to leave you out of reality
My mentality is shook. Writing verses and you got me hooked
I see you when I close my eyes, now I wanna look
But what do I do? What do I say?
How do I keep you around for just another day?
Or night. You left, now I ain't feelin right
Every other girl that I see I don't really like
Yeah where you hiding at, residing at
Get outta my mind with that
I gotta find you, close my eyes and count to ten
No more playin around, I'm playin to win
