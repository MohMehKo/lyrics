[Sample 1 - Babyface:]
She's a special kind of girl that makes her daddy feel proud
You know the kind of girl that stands out in crowds
Found the tender roni, and the roni is so right
I think I'm gonna love her for the rest of my life

[Verse 1 - Packi:]
P-P-Pow Pow! End of the semester, call it summertime,
There she goes already, walking 'round in something fine,
I'm like Damn, that's that chick, that's that chick that's gon' be mine,
I know there's alot of fish but imma go drop her a line,
Wait, who's that girl, who's that chick,
I just fell in love 3 times in 5 minutes, somebody tell me what is up,
Summer love, got the ladies trying their best,
dressed in less clothes, showing off ass & chest, buuut

[Chorus - Packi:]
There's something bout a sundress that gets me, every time,
and I swear, that girl right there is never gon' leave my mih-h-h-h-hind,
Believe me girl, I know she could be the, she could be the sweetest girl,
Believe that, you would never leave that, if you ever seen this girl,
There's something bout a sundress,

[Verse 2 - Packi:]
Lordie-Lordie, Lordie there's a lotta shorties when the sun is out

then her friend came out, its 50-50, damn,
Feeling like the man, then I saw her looking hot, now I'm feelin like a fan,
Whoa, hold up, nothing like a fine ass chick with a cold one,
Only thing better is if she's wearing, you know whaaat

[Chorus]

[Sample 2 - Babyface x2:]
The truth about roni, she's a sweet old girl
About the sweetest little girl in the whole wide world,
She'll make the toughest homeboy fall deep in love,
Said once you had a roni, you will never give her up.

[Sample 1 - Babyface:]
She's a special kind of girl that makes her daddy feel proud
You know the kind of girl that stands out in crowds
Found the tender roni, and the roni is so right
I think I'm gonna love her for the rest of my life
