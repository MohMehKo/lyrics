[Verse 1: Packi]
She said she loves me, but she don't want a kid like me
She said she needs me, but she don't wanna mess around
And she knows, I don't blame her at all
But I gotta do this for me
Uhh, just another dreamer
The difference is; I won't stop until I get it
She been there for every step, wonders why I'm not committed
All that I can say is I been grinded
And timing isn't everything but everything takes time and
She just wanna talk about all that we have in common;
I just wanna talk to my brothers about this mountain that we climbin'
This shit is getting real I can no longer pretend
First I couldn't see the beginning, now I can't see the end

[Hook: Packi & Moe T]
Don't hold me too closely, you knew me, don't know me
Least that's what you told me again
You said you loved the old me but things changed
You became lonely I'm sorry, I'm only a man
I need that; Mulla, champaign
World tour, that campaign, that crew I came up with
To make sure I can't change
Give back to my people, give back to my fam, give back to my studio and give back to my fans
Amen, Amen. 2:30 a.m
You sleeping now, you're young and I be sleeping when I'm dead
If I don't sleep when I'm behind it, I won't sleep when I'm ahead
My competition in the mirror; I'm competing 'till the end

[Verse 2: Packi]
Hold on. Hold ooh-ooh-oon, where did all the time go?
I know, I knooh-ooh-oow
I said; I'll be there for you, lately I've been on my ooh-ooh-oown
You deserve better (Better, Better, Better) than a kid a like me
I-I-I can't stop the pain, I can't be your everything
My dudes, they depend on me, they bet on me, they get 'em things
I'mma do it, yeah I'm sorry didn't mean to put you through it
I still feel the same but everything around is moving, the room is spinnin', the ground is shakin'
The rumors spreadin', the conversation is money making, they taking so long
Fake friends; they have the patience to wait and they gone
This that shit that bring them back, I'll just shrug 'em move along

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Packi]
Quote me, I won't let nothin' slow me
I think I care too much and so it's better that I'm lonely
Some people they provoke me, two year later they promote me
Since, oh wait, I did it my way and don't anybody owe me
But they holler at a spittah, they know I got that flame
They put me on the show because they know I got that name
But baby either way they sweatin'
We gotta wait and see, all I know is that they threatenin'
All they've heard is what I give away for free
Oh my, right? It get like that, drop one verse and they quit like that
Least two years behind these old heads
But I'm ill and I'm still talkin' shit like that
Bottom line; I'm doing me
Bottom line; they know it
Bottom line; I'm doing fine
And gettin' where I'm going
(I need that) Mulla, champaign
World tour, that campaign, that crew I came up with
To make sure I can't change
Give back to my people, give back to my fam, give back to my studio and give back to my fans
Amen, Amen. 2:30 a.m
You sleeping now, you're young and I be sleeping when I'm dead
If I don't sleep when I'm behind it, I won't sleep when I'm ahead
My competition in the mirror; I'm competing 'till the end
