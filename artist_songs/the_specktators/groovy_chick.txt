And it, and it, goes like this
Fine little thing from the west side, man
I can get in trouble on a coast like this
Girls run around in they best outfits
And the sun's out, and my drink never runs out
Beach when the sun's up, bar when the sun's down
Walking sunset strip with a sundress
Strawberry blonde hair down, man I'm obsessed
Walks like a model with a butt, though
Split a bottle of moscato in the cut, though
That type chick, that type killa
Live like Timbo, smooth like Thriller
I'm like "woah, how I go about this?"
Not used to the wife type
But I'm already seeing me with this girl
And this girl might just change my whole life

She a groovy chick, straight out of a movie chick
She a groovy chick, and I just might be in love
She a groovy chick, straight out of a movie chick
She a groovy chick, and I just might be in love with this groovy chick

Hey fashionista, I'm a backpack rapper
It's nice to meet ya
Got a new song, you can be the feature
Never done this? I can be your teacher
Girl just let loose, don't gotta tell her twice, though
Drink in her hand, only thing about her ice cold
Warm heart with a free spirit
Had her heart broke but the girl don't fear it
She dive right in, head first
Hope for the best, never even expect the worse
All about her attitude, cool chick
Everything she do is on cue like a pool stick
Jump out the pool quick, gotta go to school, shit
Hop in the drop top, good with the cool whip
You know? That skirt off
Told me dinner tonight, she don't do dessert off
And groovy

She a groovy chick, straight out of a movie chick
She a groovy chick, and I just might be in love
She a groovy chick, straight out of a movie chick
She a groovy chick, (and I just might be in love)

And she don't wanna go
She don't wanna go
Man I hate to see her leave
And she don't wanna go
She don't wanna go
I just need her here with me

She a groovy chick, straight out of a movie chick
She a groovy chick, and I just might be in love
She a groovy chick, straight out of a movie chick
She a groovy chick, and I just might be in love

She a groovy chick, straight outta movie chick
With a booty and oooh she thick
And I wanna be who she with, choosy chick
Yeah, something 'bout two's and shit, losing it
Grab the booze and hop in the jacuzzi with
Cold drinks and a hot tub with a good girl
Now tell me that that's not love
Rock the boat, till that thing don't float
We going overboard, baby grab that rope
Come closer, oh that other chick?
She don't come close to you
What am I supposed to do?
I think about other girls but it's mostly you
