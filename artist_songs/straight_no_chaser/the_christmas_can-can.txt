Christmas, Christmas time is here,
And Christmas songs you love to hear
Thoughts of joy and hope and cheer,
But mostly shopping, shopping, shopping

Christmas, Christmas time is here,
The sleigh bells and the red-nosed deer
Songs and songs we love to hear
All played a thousand times each year

Heard this same song twenty times
And it's only Halloween (Joy To The World)
(I saw three ships come sailing in on Christmas Day on Christmas Day)
It's not even cold outside (deck the halls with boughs of holly)

Christmas, Christmas time is here,
(Hark The Herald Angels Sing)
And Christmas songs you love to hear
(Joy To The World)
Thoughts of joy and hope and cheer,
But mostly shopping, shopping, shopping

Christmas season
Starting sooner every year
It's October,
Stores with plastic Christmas trees

Ransack the mall,
Shop 'til you lose your mind
Spike the eggnog,
Sit back and watch Rudolph, Frosty, Tiny Tim, and Scrooge, the Grinch, or Charlie Brown

It's time...

It's time to do the Christmas can-can
If you can't, can't dance, well, that's OK (not going to do the kick line)
All you need is a tree, some lights about a thousand presents
Wrap them up and pray for snow

Run to your closet
Find your Christmas sweater
Screaming carols all the way (fa-la-la-la-la)
Maine all the way to California it's the Christmas can-can Halloween to Christmas day

It's the most wonderful time of year
We're running mad with Christmas cheer
Hey, what's troubling you, my friend?
It's not fair if you're Jewish, Jewish (not fair if you're Jewish, Jewish)

Dreidel, Dreidel, Dreidel
I made it out of clay
You realize that Christmas ain't the only holiday

Hey, he's right who made these laws?
Look! Wait! Here comes Santa Claus, Santa Claus, Santa Claus, Santa Claus, Santa Claus (Santa, Santa, Santa, Santa, Santa, Santa, Santa, Santa) (Guys? Guys!)

Hey, Santa do the can-can
Help them if you can-can
Join in the parade
(I'm gonna go grab some Chinese food)
All you need is a tree, some lights about a thousand presents
Wrap them up and pray for snow

Run to your closet
Find your Christmas sweater
Screaming carols all the way (fa-la-la-la-la)
France all the way to Indiana
It's the Christmas can-can
That's the end

Wait for our ending
We should share this holiday
Hava Nagila happy Hanukkah to you,
A happy Hanukkah to you, a happy Hanukkah to you
A merry Christmas, Hanukkah and also Kwanzaa.
Merry Christmas, happy Hanukkah, and merry Kwanzaa, too
