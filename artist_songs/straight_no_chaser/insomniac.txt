I can see you
Don't even know you
Fallin' into the sheets at night
Place my hands flat on my chest
I feel the heartbeat back the night
I've tried counting the sheep
And I talk to the shepard
And played with my pillow forever, ever
I sit alone and I watch the clock
I breathe in on the tick
And out on the tock

[Chorus:]
I can hear your bare feet on the kitchen floor
I don't have to have these dreams no more
And I found someone just to hold me tight
Hold the insomniac all night

I dig my head down deep
So I can't hear the cars
Outside on the street
And the stars are laughin'
They get a kick out of my misery
I've tried everything short of Aristotle
Took Dramamine and whiskey bottle
Pray for the day when my ship comes in
And I can sleep the sleep of the just again

[Chorus 2x]

Hold the insomniac all night...
Hold the insomniac all night...
Hold the insomniac all night...

Hold me and keep on holding me
Won't you hold me and keep on holding me
Won't you hold me and keep on holding me
Won't you hold me... keep... on...
