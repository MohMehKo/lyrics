Sometimes I feel like
I don't have a partner
Sometimes I feel like
My only friend

Is the city I live in
The city of angels
Lonely as I am
Together we cry

I drive on her streets
'Cause she's my companion
I walk through her hills
'Cause she knows who I am

She sees my good deeds
And kisses me windy
Well, I never worry
Now, that is a lie

I don't ever wanna feel
Like I did that day
Take me to the place I love
Take me all the way

I don't ever wanna feel
Like I did that day
Take me to the place I love
Take me all the way

She knows who I am

It's hard to believe that
There's nobody out there
It's hard to believe
That I'm all alone

At least I have her love
And the city she loves me
Lonely as I am, together we cry

I don't ever wanna feel
Like I did that day
Take me to the place I love
Take me all the way

I don't ever wanna feel
Like I did that day
Take me to the place I love
Take me all the way

Hold on, hold on, love me
Hold on, hold on, love me
Hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on

Under the bridge downtown
Is where I drew some blood
Under the bridge downtown
I could not get enough

Under the bridge downtown
Forgot about my love
Under the bridge downtown
I threw my life away

Away, yeah, yeah
Away, yeah, yeah

Oh no, no no, yeah, yeah
Oh no, oh no, yeah, yeah
