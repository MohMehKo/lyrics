We may only have tonight
But till the morning sun you're mine all mine
Play the music low and swing to the rhythm of love
My head is stuck in the clouds
She begs me to come down
Says "Boy quit foolin' around"
Told her "I love the view from up here
The warm sun and wind in my ear
We'll watch the world from above
As it turns to the rhythm of love"

We may only have tonight
Till the morning sun you're mine all mine
Play the music low and swing to the rhythm of love
My heart beats like a drum
A guitar string to the strum
A beautiful song to be sung
She's got blue eyes deep like the sea
That roll back when she's laughing at me
She rises up like the tide
The moment her lips meet mine

We may only have tonight
But till the morning sun you're mine all mine
Play the music low and swing to the rhythm of love
When the moon is low
We can dance in slow motion
And all your tears will subside
All your tears will dry

Ba-ba ba-ba ba-ba ba-ba ba-ba ba-ba
Da da-da dum Da da-da dum

Wise men say only fools rush in
But I can't help falling in love with you
We may only have tonight
But till the morning sun you're mine all mine
Play the music low and swing to the rhythm of love
Play the music low and swing to the rhythm of love
And swing to the rhythm of love
