I've been really tryin', baby I wanna get it on with you
Tryin' to hold back this feelin' for so long I wanna get it on with you
And if you feel like I feel, baby I wanna get it on with you
Then come on, oh, come on I wanna get it on with you
Whoo, let's get it on I wanna get it on
Ah, babe, let's get it on
Let's love, baby
Let's get it on, sugar
Let's get it on
Whoo-ooh-ooh

We're all sensitive people
With so much to give
Understand me, sugar
Since we got to be
Let's live
I love you
There's nothin' wrong
With me lovin' you
Baby, no, no
And givin' yourself to me can never be wrong
If the love is true
Oh baby

Don't you know
How sweet and wonderful life can be?
Whoo-ooh
I'm askin' you, baby
To get it on with me
Ooh, ooh, ooh

I ain't gonna worry, I ain't gonna push
Won't push you, baby
So come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, baby
Stop beatin' 'round the bush

Oh I wanna get it on
Lovin' me
I want to get it on
You don't have to worry that its wrong
Cause if the spirit moves you, let me groove you good
Let your love come out
If you believe in love let's get it on
This minute

Sanctified, sanctified
Let's get it on
I wanna get it on with you
