Snow

Oh, the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful, hey
And since we've no place to go
Gonna let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

And it doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've brought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Gonna let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
Let it snow

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

Oh, the fire is slowly dying
And my dear, we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so, love me so
Gonna let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

Let it snow, gotta let it, gotta let it snow
Gotta let it, gotta let it snow
Gotta let it, got to let it, gotta let it
Got to let it snow, oh

The weather outside if frightful
But by the fire it's so delightful, just let it snow
The weather outside if frightful
But by the fire it's so delightful, just let it snow

It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've brought some corn for popping, just let it snow
The fire is slowly dying,
And my dear, we're still goodbying, just let it snow

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

Oh, the fire is slowly dying
And my dear, we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so
Just let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

Let it snow, snow
Gotta let it, gotta let it snow
Gotta let it, gotta let it snow
Gotta let it, gotta let it, gotta let it snow
