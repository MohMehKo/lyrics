Girl I must warn you
I sense something strange in my mind
The situation is serious
Let's cure it 'cause we're running out of time
And it's all so beautiful
Relationships they seem from the start
And it's all so deadly
When love is not together from the heart
Yeah, check it out
It's driving me out of my mind
That's why it's hard for me to find
Can't get it outta my head
Miss her, kiss her, love her, that girl is poison

She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind it, but what do you mean I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
People always told me be careful of what you do
Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And momma always told me be careful who you love
Be careful what you do for the lie becomes the truth

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

She's so fly, she'll drive you right out of your mind
Steal your heart when you're blind
Beware she's schemin', she'll make you think you're dreamin'
You'll fall in love and you'll be screamin' demon

Who will dance on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice

Poisonnn

Don't think twice

It's driving me out of my mind
That's why it's hard for me to find
Can't get it outta my head
Miss her, kiss her, love her, that girl is poison

Billie jean is not my lover
Billie jean is not my lover
Poison
Billie jean is not my lover
Billie jean is not my lover
She is poison
