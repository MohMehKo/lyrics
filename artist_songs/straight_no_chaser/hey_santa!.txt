When are you going to Atlanta?
Can I hitch a ride with you old man?
'Cause my gal lives in Dixieland

Santa don't bring me any toys
Just bring my baby and a bottle of joy
Maybe just a taste for Uncle Roy
We all know Santa is a good ole boy

Could you bring along a bottle of Peppermint Schnapps?
'Cause Randawg here is really tops
I got no time for holiday shops
'Cause I got a band that's really hot

Santa don't bring me any toys
Just bring my baby and a bottle of joy
Maybe just a taste for Uncle Roy
We all know Santa is a good ole boy

I'd like a little kiss now I supposy

Hot buttered rum, hot buttered rum
Well, you hear me holler now you'd better come
Seven come eleven, seven come eleven
Baby just died and gone to heaven

Hot buttered rum, hot buttered rum
Well, you hear me holler now you'd better come
Seven come eleven, seven come eleven
Baby just died and gone to heaven
