Oh holy night, the stars are brightly shining
It is the night of the dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth

A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees, oh, hear the angel voices
Oh night divine, oh night, when Christ was born
Oh night divine, oh night, oh night divine

A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees, oh, hear the angel voices
Oh night divine, oh night, when Christ was born
Oh night divine, oh night, oh night divine

Oh holy night, oh holy night, oh yeah
Oh holy night, oh holy night, oh yeah
Oh holy night, oh holy night, oh yeah
