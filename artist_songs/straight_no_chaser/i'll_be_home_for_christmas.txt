I'll be home for Christmas, you can plan on me, me oh
Please have snow and mistletoe and presents on the tree
Christmas Eve will find me, oh, where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas if only in my dreams

I'm dreaming tonight of a place I love even more than I usually do
And although I know it's a long road back I promise you, oh

I'll be home for Christmas, you can count on me
Please have snow and mistletoe and presents on the tree
Christmas Eve will find me where the love light gleams
You know I'll be home for Christmas, ooh, if only in my, only in my dreams
