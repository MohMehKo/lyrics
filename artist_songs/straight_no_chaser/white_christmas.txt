I’m dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know.
Where the treetops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow.
I’m dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write.
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white.

I’m dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know.
Where the treetops glisten
And the children listen
To hear those sleigh bells in the snow
I’m dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases
May all your Christmases
May all your Christmases be white
And may all your Christmases be white
May they be white
Christmases be white.
