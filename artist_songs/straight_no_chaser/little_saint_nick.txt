Oh, Merry Christmas Saint Nick
(Christmas comes this time each year)
Ooh, ooh

Well, a way up North where the air gets cold
There's a tale about Christmas that you've all been told
And a real famous cat all dressed up in red
And he spends the whole year workin' out on his sled

It's the little Saint Nick
Little Saint Nick
It's the little Saint Nick
Little Saint Nick

Just a little bobsled, we call it old Saint Nick
But she'll walk a toboggan with a four speed stick
She's candy apple red with a ski for a wheel
And when Santa hits the gas, man, just watch her peel

It's the little Saint Nick
Little Saint Nick
It's the little Saint Nick
Little Saint Nick

Run, run, reindeer, run, run, reindeer
Run, run, reindeer, run, run, reindeer
He don't miss no one

And hauling through the snow at a frightenin' speed
With a half a dozen deer with a Rudy to lead
He's gotta wear his goggles 'cause the snow really flies
And he's cruisin' every pad with a little surprise

It's the little Saint Nick
Little Saint Nick
It's the little Saint Nick
Little Saint Nick

Ah, Merry Christmas Saint Nick
(Christmas comes this time each year)
Ah, Merry Christmas Saint Nick
(Christmas comes this time each year)
Ah, Merry Christmas Saint Nick
(Christmas comes this time each year)
