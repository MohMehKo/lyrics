Sittin' in the morning sun
I'll be sittin' when the evening comes
Watching the ships roll in
Then I watch them roll away again, yeah

Sittin' on the dock of the bay
Watchin' the tide roll away, ooh
Sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wastin' time

I left my home in Georgia
I'm Headed for the Frisco Bay
I've had nothing to live for
Like nothing's gonna come my way

I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay
Watchin' the tide roll away, ooh
Sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wastin' time

Looks like nothing's gonna change
Everything remains the same
I can't do what ten people tell me to do
So I guess I'll remain the same

Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river

Left a good job in the city
Workin' for the Man every night and day
And I never lost one minute of sleepin',
Worryin' 'bout the way things might have been

Big wheel keep on turnin'
Proud Mary keep on burnin'
And we rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river

Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis
Pumped a lot of tane down in New Orleans
But I never saw the good side of a city
'Til I hitched a ride on the riverboat queen

Big wheel keep on turnin'
Proud Mary keep on burnin'
And we rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
Said we we rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river...

Left a good job in the city
Workin' for the Man every night and day
And I never lost one minute of sleepin',
Worryin' 'bout the way things might have been

Big wheel keep on turnin'
Proud Mary keep on burnin'
And we rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river

Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
Rollin'
