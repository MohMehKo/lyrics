On the 1st day of Christmas my true love gave to me
A partridge in a pear tree
On the 2nd day of Christmas my true love gave to me
2 turtle doves and a partridge in a pear tree

On the 4th day of Chris

On the 3rd day of Christmas my true love gave to me
5 golden rings!
4 calling birds, 3 french hens, 2 turtle doves
And a partridge in a pear tree

On the 9th day of Christmas my true love gave to me
(On the 8th day of Christmas my true love gave to me)
9 ladies dancing, 8 ladies dancing
(8 maids a-milking, 7 maids a-milking)
7 ladies dancing, 6 ladies dancing
(6 maids a-milking)
5!
Better not shout, you better not cry
You better not, in a pear tree

On the 9th
No!
On the 8th
No!

On the 7th day of Christmas my true love gave to me
(Deck the halls with boughs of holly)
7 swans a-swimming, 6 geese a-laying
(Here we come a-wassailing, among the leaves so)
5 golden rings!
(Fa la la la)

4 calling birds, 3 french hens, 2 turtle doves
(Here we come a-wassailing among the leaves so green)
The boar's head in hand bear I bedeck'd with bays
And partridge in a pear tree

On the 11th day of Christmas my true love gave to me
11 pipers piping, 10 lords a-leaping
(Ding, dong)
9 ladies dancing, 8 maids a-milking
(Ding, dong)
7 swans a swimming, 6 geese a laying
(Ding, dong)
5 golden rings, 4 calling birds
3 french hens, 2 turtle doves
And Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer!

On the 12th day of Christmas my true love gave to me
I have a little dreidel, I made it out of clay
And when it's dry and ready, a dreidel I shall play
Oh dreidel, dreidel, dreidel
Sorry...

On the 12th day of Christmas my true love gave to me

On the 12th day my true love gave to me
12 drummers drumming like Olympus upon the Serengeti
11 pipers piping, 10 lords a-leaping!

9 ladies dancing they were dancing for me
8 maids a-milking, they were milking just for me
I had Christmas down in Africa
I had Christmas down in Africa

I had Christmas down in Africa
(5 golden rings!)
I had Christmas down in Africa
(5 golden rings!)
I had Christmas down in Africa
(5 golden rings!)
Gonna deck the halls and do the things we never had
