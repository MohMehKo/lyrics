Back home again in Indiana
And it seems that I can see
The gleaming candlelight still shining bright
Through the sycamores for me

The new-mown hay sends all its fragrance
From the fields I used to roam
When I dream about the moonlight on the Wabash
Then I long for my Indiana home

Back home again in Indiana
And it seems that I can see
The gleaming candlelight still shining bright
Through the sycamores for me

The new-mown hay sends all its fragrance
From the fields I used to roam
When I dream about the moonlight on the Wabash
Then I long for my Indiana home
