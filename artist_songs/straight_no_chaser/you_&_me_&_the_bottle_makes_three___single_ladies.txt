Hey Chuck...I know what your thinking.
That now's as good as any to start drinking.
Hey Danny...Yeah...What's it gonna be?
A gin and tonic sounds mighty mighty good to me.

Man I know I gotta go
It's the same thing every time
But I don't think another drink will make me lose my mind.
So I think about my next drink,
And it's you and me and the bottle makes three tonight.

Well I know this cat named Jerome.
He wanders to and fro.
He's in my favorite waterin' hole.
I said hey Rome, "how you doing, where have you been?"
?I?m just sittin? here sippin? my heavy sweet juice and gin.?

Man I know I gotta go
It's the same thing every time
But I don't think another drink will make me lose my mind.
So I think about my next drink,
And it's you and me and the bottle makes three tonight.

All the single ladies
All the single ladies
All the single ladies
Now put your hands up
All the single ladies
All the single ladies
All the single ladies
Now put your hands up

Man I know I gotta go
It's the same thing every time
But I don't think another drink will make me lose my mind.
So I think about my next drink,
And it's you and me and the bottle makes three
You and me and the bottle makes three
You and me and the bottle makes three tonight.
Yea!
