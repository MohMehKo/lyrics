Sweet little Jesus boy, they made you be born in a manger
Sweet little holy child, we didn’t know who you were
Didn’t know you’d come to save us lord
To take our sins away, our eyes were blind
We could not see, we didn’t know who you were

You have shown us how we are trying
Master you have shown us how, even when you were dying
It just seems like we can’t do right
Look how we treated you, but please sir forgive us lord
We didn’t know it was you
Sweet little Jesus boy, born long ago
Sweet little holy child
And we didn’t know who you were
