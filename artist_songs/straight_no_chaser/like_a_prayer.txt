Life is a mystery
Everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

I hear your voice
It's like an angel sighing
I have no choice, I hear your voice
Feels like flying

I close my eyes
Oh God I think I'm falling
Out of the sky, I close my eyes
Heaven help me

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
Down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me, you are a mystery
Just like a dream, you are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice your voice can take me there

Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
Your voice can take me there
It's like a dream to me
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
When you hold my hand, it's like a little prayer
It's like a dream to me
You know I'll take you there
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me

Life is a mystery
Everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name and it feels like home
Feels like home
