Some nights I stay up cashing in my bad luck
Some nights I call it a draw
Some nights I wish that my lips could build a castle
Some nights I wish they'd just fall off

But I still wake up, I still see your ghost
Oh, Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for oh
Whoa oh oh (What do I stand for?)
Whoa oh oh (What do I stand for?)
Most nights I don't know anymore...
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, oh, 
(Most some nights I)
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, oh
(Most some nights I)

This is it, boys, this is war - what are we waiting for?
Why don't we break the rules already?
(Most some nights I)
I was never one to believe the hype
Save that for the black and white
I try twice as hard and I'm half as liked,
But here they come again to jack my style
(Most some nights I)

So if by the time the bar closes
And you feel like falling down
I’ll carry you home

Tonight
We are young
Gonna set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

Tonight
We are young
Gonna set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

Come on

Oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, oh, 
(Most some nights I)
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, oh
(Most some nights I)

Tonight
We are young
Gonna set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

Tonight
We are young
Gonna set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

So if by the time the bar closes
And you feel like falling down
I’ll carry you home
Tonight
