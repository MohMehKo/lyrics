When the leaves start to blow
And the rain turns to snow
It is always the time of year I adore
But I know what I've missed 
When I make up my list

There is only one thing I'm asking for
I want someone I can love for Christmas
(All I want for Christmas)
Find a girl for me, so I won't be alone
(Don't wanna be alone)
I want someone I can love for Christmas
(She's all I want for Christmas)
Please find a girl who I can call my own
(Find a girl I can call my own)

Everyday she'd be near me 
And when I'd sing she'd always hear me
We'd walk together in the snow
Humming the carols we both know
I'd give her everything inside my heart
(Give her my heart)

I want someone I can love for Christmas
(All I want for Christmas)
Find a girl for me, so I won't be alone
I don't wanna be
(Don't wanna be alone)
I want someone I can love for Christmas
(She's all I want for Christmas)
Please find a girl who I can call my own
(I can call my own)

She has to be out there
I have no doubt there is someone special for me
She's all that's missing
I hope she's listening

I want someone I can love for Christmas
(She's all I want for Christmas)
Please find a girl, so I won't be alone
