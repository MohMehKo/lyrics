Amazing Grace how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me.
I once was lost, but now I’m found
Was blind but now I see.

Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved.
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first, first believed?

When we’ve been there ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun.
Oh we’ve no less days to sing God’s praise
Then when we’ve first begun.

So amazing…
Thank you…
For your grace…
I can’t thank you enough.

Amazing grace how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me.
I once was lost but now am found
Was blind but now I see.

So glad I see…
I was blind but now I can see
I was blind but now I see.
