The moonlight shines on a sycamore
And now they are calling to me
In the city its snowing
The sidewalks blowing

But there's somewhere I'd rather be
Thousands of people all walking by
But Somehow I'm still alone
I'm gonna spend winter my way
Again on the highway
I'm ready to find a way home

Indiana, thats where I'm going
This time of year you know how I feel
Indiana, thats where I'm going
Where Christmas will always be real

We'll build up the fire tell a story or two
With good friends we always invite
The old and the young come together as one
And we sing into the night

Indiana, thats where I'm going
This time of year you know how I feel
Indiana, thats where I'm going
Where Christmas will always be real

And I remember those who are gone
Looking down on my home from above
Deep in December its where I belong
Sharing the days with the ones who I love

Indiana Indiana Indiana
Indiana Indiana Indiana
Indiana Indiana Indiana

Where Christmas will always be real

The moonlight shines on a sycamore
And now they are calling to me
