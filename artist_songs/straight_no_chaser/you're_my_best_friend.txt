Ooh, you make me live
Whatever this world can give to me
It's you, you're all I see and it's you
You make me live, now, mama
Ooh, you make me live

Oh, you're the best friend
That I ever had
I've been with you such a long time
You're my sunshine

And I want you to know
That my feelings are true
I really love you
You're my best friend

Ooh, you make me live
I've been wandering around
But I still come back to you

In rain or shine
You've stood by me, mom
I'm happy, happy at home
You're my best friend

Ooh, you make me live, ooh
Whenever this world is cruel to me
I got you to help me begin
All I see and it's you
You make me live, now, mama
Ooh, you make me live

Yeah, you're the first one
When things turn out bad
You know I'll never be lonely
You're my only one

And I love the things
I really love the things that you do
Ah, you're my best friend

You're my best friend

Friend
My friend
My friend
My friend
My friend
