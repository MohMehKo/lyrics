Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
It's not warm when she's away.
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And she's always gone too long
Anytime she goes away
Anytime she goes away...

Talking about you using me,
Well it all depends on what you do.
Oh, it ain't too bad the way you're using me,
'Cause I sure am using you to do the things you do.
