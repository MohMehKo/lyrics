Mamacita, donde esta Santa Claus? 
Donde esta Santa Claus? 
And the toys that he will leave. 
Mamacita, oh, where is Santa Claus? 
I look for him because it's Christmas Eve. 

I know that I should be sleeping, 
But maybe he's not far away, 
Out of the window I'm peeping, 
Hoping to see him in his sleigh. 

I hope he won't forget to pack his castinets 
And to his reindeer, say, 
On perro (Randawg!) On gordo (Fatty!) On verde (Green!) ma√≠z dulce (Sweet Corn!)
Ole! Ole! Ole! cha cha cha.

And to his reindeer, say, 
On room (Romeski!) Carne (Turf!) Asada (and Turf!) and Sluggs
Ole! Ole! Ole! cha cha cha.
