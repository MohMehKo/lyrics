Oooooh
I'm begging

Begging, begging you
Put your loving hand out baby
Begging, begging you
Put your loving hand out baby

Riding high, when I was king
Played it hard and fast, 'cause I had everything
You walked away, you won me then
But easy come and easy go
And it would end

Begging, begging you
Put your loving hand out, baby
Begging, begging you
Put your loving hand out baby

Take that money watch it burn,
Sing in the river the lessons I learned
Take that money watch it burn,
Sing in the river the lessons I learned
Take that money watch it burn,
Sing in the river the lessons I learned
Take that money watch it burn,
Sing in the river the lessons I learned

Cause everything that kills me makes me feel alive

Lately I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
Baby I've been, I've been praying hard
Said no more counting dollars, we'll be we'll be counting stars
I I I I feel something so right doing the wrong thing
We'll be counting stars
I I I I feel something so wrong doing the right thing
Baby

I'm fighting hard to hold my own
But I just can't make it all alone
I'm holding on I can't fall back
Now that big brass ring is a shade of black

Begging, begging you
Put your loving hand out baby
Begging, begging you
Put your loving hand out baby

Take that money watch it burn,
Sing in the river the lessons I learned
Take that money watch it burn,
Sing in the river the lessons I learned
Take that money watch it burn,
Sing in the river the lessons I learned
Take that money watch it burn,
Sing in the river the lessons I learned
