Jeremiah was a bull frog
Was a good friend of mine
I never understood a single word he said
But I helped him drink his wine
Yes he always had some mighty fine wine

Joy to the world
All the boys and girls, now
Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea
Joy to you and me

If I were the King of the world
Tell you what I'd do
I'd throw away the cars and the bars and the wars
And make sweet love to you
And make sweet love to you

Joy to the world
All the boys and girls, now
Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea
Joy to you and me

You know I love the ladies
Love to have my fun
I'm a high night flier yes I?m a rider
And a straight-shooting son of a gun
I said a straight shooting son of a gun
