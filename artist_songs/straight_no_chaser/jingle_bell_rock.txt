Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring
Snowin' and blowin' and bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun

Jungle bell, jingle bell, jingle rock
Jingle bells chime and jingle bell time
Dancin' and prancin' in jingle bell square
In the frosty air

What bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time

To go gliding in one horse sleigh

Giddy up jingle horse pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a mingle in the jinglein' feet

That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell 
That's the jingle bell rock!
