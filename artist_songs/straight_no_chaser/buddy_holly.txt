What's with these homies dissing my girl?
Why do they gotta front?
What did we ever do to these guys to make them so violent?

Oooo Oooo!
Don't you know I'm yours
Oooo Oooo!
And I know your mine
Oooo Oooo!
And that's for all of time

Ooo wee ooo, I look just like Buddy Holly
Oh oh, and you're Mary Tyler Moore
I don't care what they say about us anyway
I don't care about that

Don't you ever fear, I'm always near
I know that you need help
Your tongue is twisted, your eyes are slit
You need a Guardian

Oooo Oooo!
Don't you know I'm yours
Oooo Oooo!
And I know your mine
Oooo Oooo!
And that's for all of time

Ooo wee ooo, I look just like Buddy Holly
Oh oh, and you're Mary Tyler Moore
I don't care what they say about us anyway
I don't care about that
I don't care about that

Bang Bang! Knock on the door
Another big bang get down on the floor
Oh no, what do we do? Don't look now, but I lost my shoe
I can't run and I can't kick. Wussa matta babe?
Are you feeling sick?
Wussa matta wussa matta wussa matta you?
Wussa matta babe? Are you feeling blue! Oh-ohhhh
And that's for all of time

Ooo wee ooo, I look just like Buddy Holly
Oh oh, and you're Mary Tyler Moore
I don't care what they say about us anyway
I don't care about that
I don't care about that
I don't care about that
Bang bang knock on the door
