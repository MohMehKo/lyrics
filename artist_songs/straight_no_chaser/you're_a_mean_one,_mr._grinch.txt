You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch.
You really are a heel.
You're as cuddly as a cactus,
You're as charming as an eel.
Mr. Grinch.

You're a bad banana
With a greasy black peel.

You're a mean one

You're a foul one, Mr. Grinch.
You're a nasty, wasty skunk.
Your heart is full of unwashed socks
Your soul is full of gunk Mr. Grinch.

The three words that best describe you,
Are, and I quote: "Stink. Stank. Stunk."

You're a mean one

Mr. Grinch

You're a monster.
You're a monster.
You're a monster.
Your heart's an empty hole.
Your brain is full of spiders,
You've got garlic in your soul
You're a monster
Your heart's an empty hole.
Your brain is full of spiders,
You've got garlic in your soul

You're a vile one, Mr. Grinch.
You have termites in your smile.
You have all the tender sweetness
Of a seasick crocodile.
Mr. Grinch.
