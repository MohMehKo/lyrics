Dashing through the snow

Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
Hey, jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh

Hey, dashing through the snow in a one horse open sleigh
O'er the fields we go laughing all the way, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Bells on bob tails ring, making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight

Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
Hey, jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh

Jingle bells, jingle bells, jing, jing
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle, jingle
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jing, jing
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle, jingle bells

A day or two ago, I thought I'd take a ride
And soon Miss Fanny Bright was seated by my side
The horse was lean and lank, misfortune seemed his lot
We got into a drifted bank and then we got upsot, upsot?

Jingle bells, jingle bells, jing, jing
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle, jing
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jing, jing
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle, jingle

Dashing through the snow in a one horse open sleigh
Over the fields we go laughing all the way, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Bells on bob tails ring, making spirits bright
What fun it is to laugh and sing a sleighing song tonight
