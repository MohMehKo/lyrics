Come stop your crying, it will be all right
Just take my hand, hold it tight
I will protect you from all around you
I will be here don't you cry

For one so small, you seem so strong
My arms will hold you keep you safe and warm
This bond between us, can't be broken
I will be here don't you cry

[Chorus:]
Cause you'll be in my heart (you'll be in)
Yes you'll be in my heart (you'll be in my heart)
from this day on, now and forever more

Why can't they understand the way we feel (the way we feel)
They just don't trust what they can't explain (you'll be in my heart)
I know we're different, but deep inside us
We're not that different at all

[Chorus:]
And you'll be in my heart
Yes you'll be in my heart
From this day on, now and forever more

Bridge:
Don't listen to them, cause what do they know?
We need eachother, to have, to hold
They'll see in time, I know they will

When destiny calls, you must be strong
I may not be with you, but you got to hold on
They'll see in time, I know they will
We'll show them together, cause

[Chorus]
You'll be in my heart
(oh baby) You'll be in my heart
From this day on, now and forever more

Always, I'll be with you (I'll be there, I'll be there)
I'll be there for you always, always
Just look over your shoulder
Just look over your shoulder
Just look over your shoulder

I'll be there always.
