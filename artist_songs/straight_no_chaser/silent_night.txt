Silent night, holy night
All is calm and all is bright
Round Yon virgin mother and child
Holy Infant, so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

Silent night, holy night
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing Halleluia
Christ, the Savior is born
Christ, our Savior is born

Silent night, holy night
Son of God, love's pure light
Radiant beams from thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus Lord at Thy birth
Jesus Lord at Thy birth

Halleluia
Halleluia
Halleluia

Christ, the Savior is born
