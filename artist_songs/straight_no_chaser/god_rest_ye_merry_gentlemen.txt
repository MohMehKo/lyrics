Tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy

God rest ye merry gentlemen, let nothing you dismay, hey
Remember Christ ,our savior was born on Christmas Day
To save us all from Satan's power when we were gone astray

Oh, tidings of comfort and joy, joy
Tidings of comfort and joy

From God, our heavenly father, a blessed angel came
And unto certain shepherds brought tidings of the same
How that in Bethlehem was born the son of God by name

Oh, tidings of comfort and joy, joy
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy

To save us all from Satan's power when we were gone astray

Oh, tidings of comfort and joy, joy
Tidings of comfort and joy
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy

Oh, tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy
Tidings of comfort and joy
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy
