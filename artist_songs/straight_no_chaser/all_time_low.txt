I was the knight in shining armour in your movie
You would put your lips on mine and love the aftertaste
Now I'm a ghost, I call your name, you look right through me
You're the reason I'm alone, can't concentrate

I (I, I), I've been trying to fix my pride
But that's been broken, that's been broken, yeah
And lie (lie, lie), lie, l-lie, I try to hide
But now you know it

That I'm at an all time low
Low, low, low-low-low, low
Low, low, low-low-low
All time
Low-low-low, low
Low, low, low-low-low
All time
Low, low, low-low-low, low
Low, low, low-low-low
All time
Low-low-low, low
Low, low, low-low-low
All time

I was the prototype like 3 stacks on that CD
An example of the perfect candidate
Now all your girlfriends say that you don't want to see me
You're the reason that I just can't concentrate

I (I, I, I...) I've been trying to fix my pride
But that's been broken, that's been broken, yeah
And lie (lie, lie), lie, l-lie, I try to hide
But now you know it

That I'm at an all time low
Low, low, low-low-low, low
Low, low, low-low-low
All time
Low-low-low, low
Low, low, low-low-low
All time
Low, low, low-low-low, low
Low, low, low-low-low
All time
Low-low-low, low
Low, low, low-low-low
All time

(All time
All time
All time)

(All time)
