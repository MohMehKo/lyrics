Don't let the sun go down on me
(Don't let the sun)
Don't let the sun go down on me
('Cause losing everything)
Is like the sun going down on me

I can't find, oh the right romantic line
But see me once and see the way I feel
(Woah, woah)
(Way I feel)
Don't discard me
Just because you think I mean you harm
(Don't discard me just because you think I mean you harm, no)
But these cuts I have
Oh, they need love to help them heal
(Oh)

Don't let the sun go down on me
(Don't let the sun)
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
I just allow a fragment of your life to wander free
('Cause losing everything)
Is like the sun going down on me

Don't let the sun go down on me
(Don't let the sun)
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
I just allow a fragment of your life to wander free, yeah
But losing everything is like the sun going down on me
Don't let the sun go down on me
Don't let the sun
Don't let the sun
Don't let it go down on me
