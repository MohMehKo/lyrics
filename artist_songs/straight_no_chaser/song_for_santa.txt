[VERSE 1:]
I hope that you’re on that sleigh, it's filled up with gifts and toys for us.
Santa please don’t delay, the stockings are hung, the tree’s lit up.

I left you some milk and cookies on the shelf.
I hope you don’t mind I had a couple myself.
I CLEANED THE CHIMNEY SO YOU DON’T DIRTY YOURSELF.
Check your list twice ,see I’ve been nice
Mom and dad ‘ll agree yea.

[CHORUS:]
Ho ho ho, Christmas is here, ya know it’s my favorite time of the year
And when I’m dreaming you’re stuffin’ the tree, wishin and hoping that those gifts are for me,
This is a shoutout to you – oh oh oh oh
And all that you do – oh oh oh oh
Santa its true,
My dude
Hey Santa, This song is for you.

[VERSE 2:]
Morning I rise, open my eyes, just as wide as they can be.
I'm Gonna run down the stairs, without a care to get me to that Christmas tree.

Mama said, "Boy you betta brush yo teeth.
Nothing gets opened til you’ve sumthin to eat."
Anticipation’s killin me.
I’m eatin food, fast as I can, nothing CAN STOP ME NOW yeah

[BRIDGE:]
I THOUGHT I HEARD YOU COMIN DOWN THE CHIMNEY
I TRIED TO CATCH A GLIMPSE BUT MOMMA CAUGHT ME. SHE CAUGHT ME.

I’M HAVIN A HARD TIME GETTING TO SLEEP, wondering if you made it to my tree. I hope you got my list but that's enough about me. Bout me

[CHORUS]

[OUTRO:]
This song, this song is for you Santa and only you Santa oh ow oh this song this song is for you Santa and only you Santa.
