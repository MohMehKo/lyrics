On the road again
Just can't wait to get on the road again
The life I love is making music with my friends
And I can't wait to get on the road again

On the road again
Goin' places that I've never been
Seein' things that I may never see again
And I can't wait to get on the road again

On the road again
Like a band of gypsies we go down the highway
We're the best of friends
Insisting that the world keep turning our way and our way

On the road again
Just can't wait to get on the road again
The life I love is making music with my friends
And I can't wait to get on the road again
I can't wait to get on the road 

I play the road,
And the highway is our song,
And every city's like the same three chords
Been helping us along when the story's told
And the crowd has come and gone
Shaking off the miles and trying to make it home

Well the bus it is our steeple,
It brings us to the people
And they will be there waiting,
Dancing young and old
And every one of us gets tired,
But every one remains inspired
And every one of us require

To keep picking through our souls

I play the road,
And the highway is our song,
And every city's like the same three chords
Been helping us along when the story's told
And the crowd is cone and gone
Shaking off the miles and trying to make it home

She says, "Daddy where do you go
When you leave me all these nights
With a suitcase and guitar in your hand?
Kissing me and mom goodbye with a tear and a smile,
Where do you go, Daddy where do you go?"

I play the road,
And this highway is our song,
And every city's like the same three chords
Been helping us along when the story's told
And the crowd is done and gone
Shaking off the miles and trying to make it home
Shaking off the miles (Shaking off the miles...)
(Mile after mile) Mile after mile
Baby, I'm coming home
