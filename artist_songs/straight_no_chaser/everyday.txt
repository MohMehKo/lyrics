I will love you till the sun burns out
I will love you till the sky falls down
You and I will never fade away
I love you everyday (yeah, yeah)
Give me love and I will give you mine
I'll be yours until the end of time
You and I will never fade away
I love you everyday (yeah, yeah)

I can hear people talking
Saying things like "this won't last"
But they don't know our situation
They don't know about our past
We've been through it all already
Broken hearts and shattered dreams
Now it's time to make my mind up
Time to show you what I really mean

Have I told you that you're my everything
And without you, I'm incomplete
But when I hold you
I can breathe, I can breathe

I will love you till the sun burns out
I will love you till the sky falls down
You and I will never fade away
I love you everyday (yeah, yeah)
Give me love and I will give you mine
I'll be yours until the end of time
You and I will never fade away
I love you everyday (yeah, yeah)

I remember when you caught my eye
That you could be the one for me
But I didn't have the strength to try
I though that love had given up on me
That look, that smile that you set my way
Became a love that we still share today
I'm ready and I hope you're ready
It's time for me to say

Have I told you that you're my everything
And without you, I'm incomplete
But when I hold you
I can breathe, I can breathe

I will love you till the sun burns out
I will love you till the sky falls down
You and I will never fade away
I love you everyday (yeah, yeah)
Give me love and I will give you mine
I'll be yours until the end of time
You and I will never fade away
I love you everyday (I love you everyday)
