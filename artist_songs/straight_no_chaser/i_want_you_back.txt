When I had you to myself, I didn't want you around
Those pretty faces always make you stand out in a crowd
But someone picked you from the bunch, one glance was all it took
Now it's much too late for me to take a second look

Oh baby, give me one more chance
(To show you that I love you)
Won't you please let me back in your heart
Oh darlin', I was blind to let you go
(Let you go, baby)
But now since I see you in her arms
(I want you back)
Yes I do now
(I want you back)
Ooh ooh baby
(I want you back)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
(I want you back)
Na na na na

Trying to live without your love is one long sleepless night
Let me show you, boy, that I know wrong from right
Every street you walk on, I leave tear stains on the ground
Following the boy I didn't even want around

Let me tell ya now
Oh baby, all I need is one more chance
(To show you that I love you)
Won't you please let me back in your heart
Oh darlin', I was blind to let you go
(Let you go, baby)
Now since I see you in her arms

I want you
I want you
Ooh...
All I want
All I need
All I want
All I need
Yes I do
All I need

Is one more chance now
To show you that I love you
Baby baby baby baby ohhh...
(I want you back)
Forget what happened then
(I want you back)
Let me live again

Oh baby, I was blind to let you go
Now since I see you in her arms
(I want you back)
Spare me of this cost
(I want you back)
Give back what I lost

Oh baby, I need one more chance, yea yea
To show you that I love you
Haaa... ohhhh...
I want you back
Yes I do now
I want you back
