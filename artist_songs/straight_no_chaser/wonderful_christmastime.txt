The moon is right
The spirit's up
We're here tonight
And that's enough
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime

The party's on
The feeling's here
That only comes
This time of year
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime

The choir of children sing their song

The word is out
About the town
To lift a glass
Ah, and don't look down

Simply having a wonderful Christmastime
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime

The party is on
The feeling is here
That only comes this time of year
We’re here tonight and that’s enough
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime.

The party's on
The spirit's up
We're here tonight
And that's enough

Simply having a wonderful Christmastime
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime

The choir of children sing their song
They practiced all year long

The moon is right
The spirit's up
We're here tonight
Oh and that's enough

Simply having a wonderful Christmastime
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime

Ooh…Christmas
Ooh…Wonderful Christmastime
Ooh…Christmas
Ooh…Wonderful Christmastime
