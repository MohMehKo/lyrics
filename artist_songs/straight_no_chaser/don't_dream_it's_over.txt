Hey now, hey now

There is freedom within
There is freedom without
Try to catch the deluge
In a paper cup

There's a battle ahead
Many battles are lost
But you'll never see the end of the road
While you're traveling with me

Hey now, hey now
Don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now
When the world comes in

They come, they come
To build a wall between us
You know that they won't win

Now I'm towing my car
There's a hole in the roof
My possessions are causing me suspicion
But there's no proof

In the paper today
Tales of war and of waste
But you turn
Right over to the TV page

Hey now, hey now
Don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now
When the world comes in

They come, they come
To build a wall between us
You know that they won't win

There is freedom within
There is freedom without
There is freedom within
There is freedom without

Don't dream it's over
(There is freedom within)
Don't dream it's over
(There is freedom without)

Don't matter when
(There is freedom within)
Don't matter when
(There is freedom without)

Now I'm walking again
To the beat of a drum
And I'm counting the steps
To the door of your heart

Only shadows ahead
Barely clearing the roof
Get to know the feeling
Of liberation and relief

Hey now, hey now
Don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now
When the world comes in

They come, they come
To build a wall between us
You know that they won't win

Hey now, hey now
Don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now
When the world comes in

They come, they come
To build a wall between us
You know that they won't win
