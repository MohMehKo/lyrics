[Kristen:]
This holiday
You'll be far away
And I'll be all alone
So please remember
This December
To fully charge your phone
And

Text me Merry Christmas
Let me know you care
Just a word or two
Of text from you
Will remind me you're still there
You don't have to add much to it
One smiley face will do
Baby text me Merry Christmas
Cause I'm missing kissing you

[SNC:]
Text me Merry Christmas
Make my holiday complete
Though you're far from me
Say you'll brb
That's a text I'll never delete
Choose just the right emoji
One that makes me lol
And if you text me something naughty
I promise I won't tell

[Kristen & SNC:]
I don't care if you spell things right
I just wanna hear from you tonight
Stroke those keys with your delicate touch
And type those little words that mean so much!

[SNC:] Hi
[Kristen:] Hey
[SNC:] How are you
[Kristen:] OK
[SNC:] Miss you
[Kristen:] Miss you too
[SNC:] Xmas sucks without you
[Kristen:] I know LOL
[SNC:] Love you
[Kristen:] Love you too
[SNC:] K thanks bye

[Kristen & SNC:]
A Facebook message isn't quite as sweet

[Kristen:]
I need more from @you than just a tweet

[SNC:]
A snap on Snapchat doesn't last

[Kristen & SNC:]
And voicemail? That's from Christmas past

Text me Merry Christmas
Send a selfie too
If you do, I'll go
'Neath the mistletoe
And pretend my screen is you
Show me that you love me
Text xo to kiss and hug me
I'll be right here waiting
For my pants to start vibrating
Baby, text me Merry Christmas
And I will text you too
This Christmas
It's the least that we can do

Merry Christmas!
