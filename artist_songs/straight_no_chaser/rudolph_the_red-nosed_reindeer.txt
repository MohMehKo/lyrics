Rudolph the red nosed reindeer, had a very shiny nose and if you ever saw it you would even say it glows.
All of the other reindeer they used to laugh and call him names.
They never let poor rudolph join in any reindeer games.
Well then one foggy Christmas Eve, santa came to say Rudolph with your nose so bright, won't you guide my sleigh tonight?
Then how the reindeer loved him, as they shouted out with glee.
Rudolph the red nosed reindeer you'll go down in history.
Rudolph - you better get up (du du) was born with a nuclear nose.
And if you ever saw it, you would even say it glows (like a lightbulb).
All of the other reindeer, they used to laugh and call him names (like pinnochio).
They never let (never never let) poor Rudolph join in any reindeer games (like  monopoly).
Then one dark and stormy night Santa came to call.
Rudolph with your shiny snount do me a favor help me out and how the other deer loved him as they partied and shouted with glee,
Rudolph the red nosed reindeer you'll go down in history........Rudolph!
