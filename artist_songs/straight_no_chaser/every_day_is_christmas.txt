January always brought me down
All the magic of December's like a circus leaving town
All I wanna do is follow it around
Cause everybody wishes it was Christmas all year 'round
To wake up every morning with a present in my bed
That's how I been feeling since the moment we first met

I don't need the snow to fall
I don't need the lights to shine
I don't need a mistletoe cause I'll still kiss you all the time.
We don't have to take a sleigh ride
For our hearts to race inside
I still get just as excited when we go to sleep at night
Every day is Christmas as long as everyday you are mine.

Spring is coming but the air is chill
It reminds me of the winter fires that we would always build
Hiding from the cold it's always warmer in your arms
Whenever you are kissing me it's Christmas in my heart.
I don't need the snow to fall
I don't need the lights to shine
I don't need a mistletoe cause I'll still kiss you all the time
We don't have to take a sleigh ride
For our hearts to race inside
I still get just as excited when we go to sleep at night
Every day is Christmas as long as everyday you are mine
I'll be dreaming
I believe it

Now January doesn't bring me down
Cause the magic of December's always here when you're around

No we don't need the snow to fall
We don't need the lights to shine
We don't need a mistletoe cause we'll be kissing all the time
We don't have to take a sleigh ride
For our hearts to race inside
We still get just as excited when we go to sleep at night
Every day is Christmas as long as every day you are mine

Every day is Christmas
Every day is Christmas
Every day you are mine
Every day is Christmas
Every day is Christmas
You are mine
Every day, every day
You are mine
You are mine
You are mine
You are mine
