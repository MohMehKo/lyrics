As a girl I kissed them
My heart a telephone
Such noise to listen
Too many sounds

(So I let go)
I think I feel it
(I let go)
Like wild children
(I lay low)
Misplaced a million miles from home
And so fine, I feel
Far and Wide

Unravel and revel
And this lust was built in
Straight into my bones
No need resist it
It's a drag

(So I let go)
I think I feel it
(I let go)
Like wild children
(I lay low)
Misplaced a million miles from home
And so fine, I feel
Far and Wide

Unravel and revel

So fine, I feel
Far and wide
