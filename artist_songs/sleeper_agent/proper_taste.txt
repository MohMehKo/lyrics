Expert parallels
I'm not sinking
Up or down
To your swan song singing

Text book
Sound it out
What'chu readin'
Outside the lines
Your color's bleedin'

You lack proper taste
Wipe me from your face
Tie me up, I'm laced
And stay estranged

Call me pumpkin
Carve me out
Light my candle
Blow me down
What's my name
Spell it out
But not too loud

Interrobang
What'chu sayin'
On your knees
Keep on prayin'

Begging me please
But I'm not shakin'
On my tail
You're not stayin'

You lack proper taste
Wipe me from your face
Tie me up, I'm laced
And stay estranged

Call me pumpkin
Carve me out
Light my candle
Blow me down
What's my name
Spell it out
But not too loud

Jump up on your innocence
I'll turn it into garden kitsch
Come on baby, throw a kiss
I'll catch it with a dirty fist

You lack proper taste
Wipe me from your face
Tie me up, I'm laced
And stay estranged

Call me pumpkin
Carve me out
Light my candle
Blow me down
What's my name
Spell it out
But not too loud
