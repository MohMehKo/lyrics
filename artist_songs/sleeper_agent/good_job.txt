Not a lie and not the truth
Out of line and out a few
Hundred dollars and I lost a tooth
Out of gas but a hundred proof

And I slurred what I came to say
And the words took half a day
Dozed off and missed my turn
Came to with time to burn

You said, "I'm just in it for the ride."

Well, Good Job
When it goes down I'll lift up my hands
And say
"I got everything I wanted anyway!"
Take off
Hit the ground running
Make haste to the bed we've made up
"I got everything I wanted anyway!"

Stretch an hour into a week
Excuse for another me
Found a wall to lean into
To the nines when destitute

24 and half were asleep
Raise the bar till it measures me
Can't stop till I'm out of reach
Too many people want a drink of me

You say "I'm just in it for the ride."

Well, Good Job
When it goes down I'll lift up my hands
And say
"I got everything I wanted anyway!"
Take off
Hit the ground running
Make haste to the bed we've made up
"I got everything I wanted anyway!"

But when I'm up, up, up
I'm always waiting (Yeah)
And when I'm down, down, down
Feed it to me (To Me!)
And I don't wanna peel myself back

Well, Good Job
When it goes down I'll lift up my hands
And say
"I got everything I wanted anyway!"
Take off
Hit the ground running
Make haste to the bed we've made up
"I got everything I wanted anyway!"

When it goes down I'll hit the ground running [x6]

"I got everything I wanted anyway!"
