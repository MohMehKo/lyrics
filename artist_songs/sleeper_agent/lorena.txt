You heard about their wanderin' eyes
And all the clothes they shared and hide
With all the pain you hope never gets outgrown
Cause you want me to sleep by your side
To keep her from running your life
(uh huh)
And I believed in yesterday
When all the words were simply phrased
And they still know I'm only as far as a telephone
If they want me to sleep their side
To keep them from ruinin' their life
Their life
So baby
Tell me
All your
Secrets and your lies
I'll tell you mine
Cause lately I've been thinking we ain't got the time
Playin' it nice
Cause it's a long long long way down
Ain't it?
And all along we'd used to chase
Dreams of dragons far away
Know all the flux he'll float
And I'm too scared to be outgrown
And he'll want me to sleep by your side
To keep you from running at night
Goodbye
So baby
Tell me
All your secrets and your lies
I'll tell you mine
Cause lately I've been thinking
We ain't got the time
Playin' it nice
Cause it's a long long long way down
When it's a god god god damn shame
That we can't stick around
And i believe in all those words about the worst
And is it hard to think that maybe i deserve the best
But you got loaded and went off and lost your head
And now I'm lyin' here tucked back in my bed
Where you want me to sleep on your lies
To keep me from living my life
My life
So baby
Tell me
All your secrets and your lies
I'll tell you mine
Cause lately
I've been
Thinking
We ain't got the time
Playing' it nice
So baby
Tell me
All your secrets and your lies
I'll tell you mine
Cause lately
I've been
Thinking
We ain't got the time
Playing it nice
Cause it's a long long long way down
When it's a god god god damn shame
Yeah it's a god god god damn shame
You couldn't stick around.
