Sweetheart,
Don't love too long.
Have your money spent,
On drinks too tall.

Only you'd,
say I'd,
Grown alone.
Sweetheart,
Don't love at all.

Probably think about,
Your ins and outs.
I'm biting down,
Just to feel my tongue.
[?]

Sweetheart,
Don't love too long.
May your future kin,
Be stopped head on.

Only I say,
I'd waited too long.
Sweetheart,
don't love at all.

I like to sing along to bitter songs, with megaphones just to cast them off.
But oh the sound it's tinnie it's tiny it's ten times still not us, ringing.

Sweetheart, don't love too long.
Wear your turnicate and walk on off.

Only you'd say I meant no work.
Sweetheart no love at all.

Sweetheart, your left,
with my...
Long goodbye.
Till your tears be passed around.

long goodbye may your tea... pass the round,
long goodbye may your tea... pass the round,
long goodbye may your tea... pass the round,
long goodbye may your tea... pass the round,
long goodbye may your tea... pass the round,

Sweetheart,
Don't love too long.
Sweetheart,
Don't love at all.
