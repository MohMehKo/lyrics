Tricks and treats and fees and holds
Buy you a diamond cut from coal

But I can't
And I won't

Pick your posies, ring a rose
Pavlov's pup gotta hit the road

But I can't
And I won't
But I might

Ooh, I'm not a baby no more
Ooh ooh ooh, I'm not a baby no more...

I'm never far behind, when my daddy's corrupting my mind
I'm never far behind, when my daddy's corrupting my mind

And I'm downright denim clad
I'm pulling teeth from every toothy fad

And I can
But I won't

cuz I plucked my brows just to look the part
Wanna sink my line to a catchy heart

But I can't
And I won't
But I might

Ooh, I'm not a baby no more
Ooh ooh ooh, I'm not a baby no more...

I'm never far behind, when my daddy's corrupting my mind
I'm never far behind, when my daddy's corrupting my mind

But I'm one step ahead.

I'm sick of drooling every time I hear your bell ring
But I open the door when you pull my drawstring.

Get it?

Ooh, I'm not a baby no more
I'm not a baby no more
I'm not a baby no more

Ooh, I'm not a baby no more
Ooh ooh ooh, I'm not a baby no more...

I'm never far behind, when my daddy's corrupting my mind
I'm never far behind, when my daddy's corrupting my mind
