I'ma gonna let go
I'ma gonna waste some time
Oh my my my, oh

You'a gonna say so
You'a try and say you're mine
Oh my my my, oh

(On and on and on, the light goes off and on)
I'm not cold,
I'm just a'shakin' 
And a little of your love
Keeps me'a baking
I'ma get burned (get burned!)
I'ma get burned, burned, burned, oh
[x2]

Know ya better come down,
I'm leaving you high and dry
Oh my my my, oh

I'ma gonna charge you
You'a gonna pay dem fines
On time time time

(On and on and on, the light goes off and on)
I'm not cold,
I'm just a'shakin' 
And a little of your love
Keeps me'a baking
I'ma get burned (get burned!)
I'ma get burned, burned, burned, oh
[x2]

(On and on and on, the light goes off and on)
Dare you to, but don't you care
(When you come down, I'll be there, when I come down, we'll play fair)
[x2]

(On and on and on, the light goes off and on)
I'm not cold,
I'm just a'shakin' 
And a little of your love
Keeps me'a baking
I'ma get burned (get burned!)
I'ma get burned, burned, burned, oh
[x2]

(On and on and on, the light goes off and on)
