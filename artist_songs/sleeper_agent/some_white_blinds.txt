Watch what you say
I've got nothin' in my way

Love what I do,
What I don't, do to you.

Lovely eyes
They hide
Deep inside me
[x2]

"love", ain't a line I drop often
But I find

That you only see
The coffin, not the seed

I've been taking all this time
To define my mind and keep it quiet
And right before my very eyes
I looked to leap and took the dive

It is, what it is
And you ain't on the list

But I've come to find
I'm often on your mind

Lovely eyes
They hide
Deep inside me
[x2]

I've been taking all this time
To define my mind and keep it quiet
And right before my very eyes
I looked to leap and took the dive
[x2]

I've been taking all this time
To define my mind and keep it quiet
[repeated]
