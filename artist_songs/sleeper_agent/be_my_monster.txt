Baby, I don't love you
But I think I'm gonna try.
Nothing ever happens
For the reasons we decide.

Honey, I don't love you,
Don't think I'm gonna lie.
The grass just wasn't green enough
Up over on your side.

Oh my, it's up and down
I spin my head around
I'm possessed by the sound
Your heart makes when I'm bound
[x2]

Baby, I've been crying so long
I don't think they're my tears anymore (anymore)
Maybe I've been dying too long
I don't think I'm alive anymore (anymore)

Tell me that you want to
But you do not compromise.
I'll stitch up the pieces,
Like the bride of frankenstein.

You can be my monster
And I'll be your sleeping child.
If we keep the horror up,
Then we can go all night.

Oh my, it's up and down
I spin my head around
I'm possessed by the sound
Your heart makes when I'm bound
[x2]

Baby, I've been crying so long
I don't think they're my tears anymore (anymore)
Maybe I've been dying too long
I don't think I'm alive anymore (anymore)
And lately I've been thinkin' of you
But it ain't those "lovely thoughts" no more (no more)
Baby, I've been crying so long
I don't think they're my tears anymore (anymore)

And you, you can be my monster
I'll be your bride
And if you stay haunted
I'll be satisfied.
Baby I've been crying so long - oh
(I don't think they're my tears anymore) - oh
Maybe I've been dying too long - oh
I don't think I'm livin' anymore
Baby I've been crying so long - oh
I don't think they're my tears anymore - oh

And you, you can be my monster
(I'll be your bride)
And if you stay haunted
I'll be satisfied
