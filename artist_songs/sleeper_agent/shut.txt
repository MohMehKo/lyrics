Courage, it spilt. The spiders prey don't lie.
Ain't got a thing to hide.
But one last dirty try,
pay no mind.

So throw me up against the wall.
I heard it all through your draw.
A food and mouth, high deep pics.
Apollo trick, makes me sick.
You say you've gone and lost my sight.
But you switched sides, so who's right?
Tell the sunshine not rise before my eyes.
Shut

Scrape off, your filthy film.
You can push the past aside,
or wear it in your eyes.
Like one damn dirty lie.
But not mine.

So throw me up against the wall.
I heard it all through your draw.
A food and mouth, high deep pics.
Apollo trick, it makes me sick.
You say you've gone and lost my sight.
But you switched sides so who's right?
Tell the sunshine, not to rise before my eyes.
Shut
Me, Mine, Oh I, Will, Be, Gone
Oh I, Oh I.

You say you've gone and lost my sight.
You say you've gone and lost my sight.
You say you've gone and lost my sight.
But you switched sides so who's right?

So throw me up against the wall.
