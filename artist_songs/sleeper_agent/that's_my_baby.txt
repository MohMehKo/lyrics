Come on shuga
Don'tcha cry
I don't wanna ever have to say goodbye

Don't starch yo pants
With cheap romance
And Freudian slips
Don't come off on the fly

You're never satisfied,
No!

Don't wait,
I'm never gonna chase
A tailgate,
I'm never gonna say:
"That's my baby, there. And, he don't need to know you at all."
"That's my baby, there. And, he don't need to know" - "No, he don't"

Unleash yo bark
But don'tcha stray
I'm sick and tired of fetching runaways

Tint yo lips with lover's spit
You throw your weight
I throw my fits away

Ain't it a shame?
No!

Don't wait,
I'm never gonna chase
A tailgate,
I'm never gonna say:
"That's my baby, there. And, he don't need to know you at all."
"That's my baby, there. And, he don't need to know" - "No, he don't"
"That's my baby, there. And, he don't need to know you at all."
"That's my baby, there. And, he don't need to know" - "No, he don't"

Wound too tight to come undone
This pick-apart, not never, just ain't enough
Darlin', just pry to come undone
(I'm holding out for the jinx)
Do with it what you want.

Don't wait,
I'm never gonna chase
A tailgate,
I'm never gonna say:
"That's my baby, there. And, he don't need to know you at all."
"That's my baby, there. And, he don't need to know" - "No, he don't"
"That's my baby, there. And, he don't need to know you at all."
"That's my baby, there. And, he don't need to know" - "No, he don't"
