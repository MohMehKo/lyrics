Pull me up
Before I start sinking
I'll drown if I over-think it
You're the one that I want to keep breathing
All I need's a single cell to believe in

Hate to say,
It's me you might've outgrown
Our days are numbered
And it's just getting old
You're desert bound
And your monolith's crumbling
But grab your guns
And I'll come running out

I'm gonna make you believe in me
Gonna make you believe in me
(But you can't make me make up your damn mind)
I'm gonna make you believe in me
Gonna make you believe in me
(But you can't stop my heart from running wild)

The Nothing's coming
Now here's my nowhere odds
You're never there,
You were always lost in thought
So slow,
Ya movin' backwards, baby, crawl
Back to, your old Kentucky home

They call,
I beckon to their cries
I feed into their weary, dreamy eyes
Unlike you
And the safe-net's that ya use
They gamble too
And they'll never leave me behind

I'm gonna make you believe in me
Gonna make you believe in me
(But you can't make me make up your damn mind)
I'm gonna make you believe in me
Gonna make you believe in me
(But you can't stop my heart from running wild)

You're a ghost, be here now
You're a ghost, be here now

And
She'll see
(How ya been?)
She'll see
(How we were back when)
And Chelsea, I've been doing fine
I'm all wave and no goodbye
