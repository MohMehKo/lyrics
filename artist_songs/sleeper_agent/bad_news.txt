Oh, who, who was late?
Who would sleep out the ghosts trapped in your frame?
Was it you?
A pale shade of blue
Hopped in in this heart I can't refuse

And who would wanna stay in love with you?
Now who would wanna stay in love with you?
And it's bad, bad news
It's all that I do
Who would wanna stay in love with you?

Oh, who, who's under the sheet?
Who cut two eye holes and draped it over me?
Singin' the same song, wound in my head
Like a chainsaw, curled up in bed
I feel the attack but never let go

Who would wanna stay in love with you?
Yeah, who would wanna stay in love with you?
And it's bad, bad news
It's all that I do
Yeah, who would wanna stay in love with you?

What if we're blessed?
Don't fix
I fear I won't turn away
Don't you dare show your face
Don't you dare show your
Singin' the same song, wound in my head
It's the same song, repetitive
Like a chainsaw, curled up in bed next to you

'Cause I just wanna stay in love with you
Yeah, I just wanna stay in love with you
And it's bad, bad news
It's all that I do
'Cause I just wanna stay in love with you
