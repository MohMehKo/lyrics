Come on baby, you know you ain't going nowhere
You're going to stay here with me forever

Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no

Is the love I had to share with you

So baby don't let me waste no more time on you
I don't know why
I would die
If I kept you in my life

I would die, I would die

But I don't think, no I don't think you want me to
