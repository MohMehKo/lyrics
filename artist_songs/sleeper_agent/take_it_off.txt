When you demons are howlin' again,
who are you facing when you're at wit's end?
I hope it's not the habit
When you're looking thinly veiled and who can tell
What gives you hell?
And I know when it's hard to pretend
Up in your spirits but lower in chin
I'd help you but the dust trail you're kicking up
Has had enough of us

Let's shake it up

Take it off
I came all this way just to see you
Take it off
Whoa
Why's it hard to say that I still need you?

We'll leave the lights on
Until the next song
Who's gonna take it off?

And it breaks my little heart
To know we're still apart
By land and sea
Or just our clothes
Often thrown out with the water
Don't make this harder than it has to be
Come on, get up in arms and

Take it off
I came all this way just to see you
Take it off
Whoa
Why's it hard to say that I still need you

We'll leave the lights on
Until the next song
Who's gonna take it off?

Heat waves and heart rates soar
Until my arms shake and 
I'm left holding on my
Bitter days (My bitter days)
My better half says (My bitter half says)
Have a laugh and we'll turn it up

Take it off
I came all this way just to see you
Whoa
Take it off
Why's it hard to say that I still need you

We'll leave the lights on
Until the next song
And in the doorway
Until the next day
Who's gonna take it off?

Who's gonna take it off?
