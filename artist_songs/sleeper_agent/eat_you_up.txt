Well, I'd like to tear apart these pictures of your face
But when I think aloud I invite you in to stay
Can't help that the things I like appeal to my distaste
So sweet of you to go and sour my embrace
Cause they want you they need, oh!
They're gonna eat you up
They'll take your body and praise the way that you was brought up
They want they need you, oh!
They're gonna eat you up
Our days are numbered but so what we'll have a toast to it all
Your eyes are my eyes
(We'll have a toast to it all)
Above the sky lights
(We'll have a toast to it all)
Tonight is our night
(We'll have a toast to it all)
Before the sunrise
(We'll have a toast to it all)
Come on and fall apart, we'll put you in your place
You'll be my astronaut, I'll be your outer space
This ain't a game I played a joke on your charades
Honey you're the prey I'm not the one you chase
Cause they want you they need you, oh!
They're gonna eat you up
They'll take your body and praise the way that you's brought up
They want they need you, oh!
They're gonna eat you up
Our days are numbered but so what we'll have a toast to it all
Your eyes are my eyes
(We'll have a toast to it all)
Above the sky lights
(we'll have a toast to it all)
Tonight is our night
(We'll have a toast to it all)
Before the sunrise
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh whoa-oh!
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh whoa-oh!
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh whoa-oh!
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh whoa-oh!
Your eyes and my eyes
(We'll have a toast to it all)
Above the sky lights
(We'll have a toast to it all)
Tonight is our night
(We'll have a toast to it all)
Before the sunrise
(We'll have a toast to it all)
Before the sunrise
(We'll have a toast to it all)
Before the sunrise
(We'll have a toast to it all)
Before the sunrise
(We'll have a toast to it all)
Before the sunrise
(We'll have a toast to it all)
