Tell me all your dirt
Show me where it hurts
I'll force a smile
Just to lay with

All I wanna do
Is lay with you
Oh no, what I'd do
To lay with you

I'd get so high
Cause I've been waiting all this time
To get mine, I've been

Cause I've been waiting all this time
To get mine, I've been

Gonna take my time
Hopeless heartache crime
But I'm gonna get
I'm gonna get
I'm gonna get

Make me before I make you
Take me before I break you
I'll force a smile
Just to lay with

All I wanna do
Is lay with you
Oh no, what I'd do
To lay with you

I'd get so high
Cause I've been waiting all this time
To get mine, I've been

Cause I've been waiting all this time
To get mine, I've been

Gonna take my time
Hopeless heartache crime
But I'm gonna get
I'm gonna get
I'm gonna get mine

You can run and you can hide
In the end, it's you I'll find
[x2]

I'll force a smile
Just to lay with

All I wanna do
Is lay with you
Oh no, what I'd do
To lay with you

I'd get so high
All I wanna do
Is lay with you
Oh no, what I'd do
To lay with you
