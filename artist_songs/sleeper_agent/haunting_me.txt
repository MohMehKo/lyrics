What's that?
Where was I?
Where do you think you are?
At least I know you.
I've seen where I let this go, now it don't lead to home, but it's all I know.
Oh, it looks like you, it talks like you, but it won't let me through.
Oh, it look like you, it talks like you, but it won't let me through.
But I'm gonna stand, stand by and hold your hand.
Breaks fevers but can't cool you.
And I feel, I feel I can change.
But I can't really change I'm disabled from enabling every fucked up thing you do
Oh, it looks like you, it talks like you, but it won't let me through.
Oh, it look like you, it talks like you, but it won't let me through.
I said I won't be there when you're ready for me, I'm not sorry.
Are you ready for me? I'm not sorry
Are you ready for me? I'm not sorry
Oh, and it's haunting me just like a melody that's too high for me to sing
Oh, and it's haunting me just like a memory and I'll never fall asleep again.
Oh, it looks like you, it talks like you, but it won't let me through.
Oh, it look like you, it talks like you, but it won't let me through.
I said I won't be there when you're ready for me, I'm not sorry.
I said I won't be there when you're ready for me, I'm not sorry.
Are you ready for me? I'm not sorry
Are you ready for me? I'm not sorry
