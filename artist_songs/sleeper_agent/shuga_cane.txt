I see you
(I feel you there)
I'll take you
(anywhere)
Make it
(what you want)
I got it
(you like to flaunt)

Let's strip down,
Show each other our stab wounds
Seven pounds
And you'll get my eyes too
Make our rounds
To a series of empty rooms
Uh-huh, I swear
You'll get yours too

We gonna have a ball
But we ain't got no need for chains
We gonna roll dem bones
And meet you at the blood lust bank
And though it's plain to see
You're gonna break my knees
With your shuga cane

Come on
(play one more)
I'll be your
(yarn folk lore)
Swaddled
(rags with care)
I got some
(change to spare)

Let's strip down,
Show each other our stab wounds
Seven pounds
And you'll get my eyes too
Make our rounds
To a series of empty rooms
Uh-huh, I swear
You'll get yours too

We gonna have a ball
But we ain't got no need for chains
We gonna roll dem bones
And meet you at the blood lust bank
And though it's plain to see
You're gonna break my knees
With your shuga cane

We gonna have a ball
But we ain't got no need for chains
We gonna roll dem bones
And meet you at the blood lust bank
And though it's strange to see
You're gonna break my knees

And yeah it's strange to see
You're gonna break my knees
With your shuga cane.
