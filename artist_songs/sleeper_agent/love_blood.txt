You need to find new ties
To cut your slow-mo
Too quick to bind old lies
With thick as thieves growth
Quit charging up your credit line
And stick with what you know
Three licks on a swinging vine
You popped your tootsie roll

Because
Our love,
Keeps our bodies moving on
Keeps us singing mono-tone
Keeps our love blood flow

I keep my legs restless
And my story untold
No altar boy confessions
Just a bright red nose
But if you got a new lesson
I'm in the need to know
You hoot, I holler blessins'
From the old pay phone

Because
Our love,
Keeps our bodies moving on
Keeps us singing mono-tone
Keeps our love blood flow

Tell me,
What you thinkin' of me
If you think you love me
Keep your love lips sewn

Don't care about your new tattoo
Just wanna ink beneath your tissue
A single speed on your slow rewind
Who said our love was blind?

Because
Our love,
Keeps our bodies moving on
Keeps us singing mono-tone
Keeps our love blood flow

Tell me,
What you thinkin' of me
And if you think you love me
Keep your love lips sewn
