I bottomed out
Ear to the ground
You drew the line
I threw in the towel
Now I feel okay

And when you're fed
You'll flee from dread
What's in your head
Night lights in bed

So sick of shame
Such a miserable thing
Don't wanna think
Of the horror it brings
So gimme love
That big, big love
And I'll feel okay

I bottomed out
Heart gonna pound
You drew the line
And I'm heaven bound
Oh I just can't wait

And spin your thread
Makeshift cob-webs
It's in your head
It thickens and spreads

So sick of me
Such a miserable me
So sick of you
So pleasantly cruel
So gimme love
That big, big love
And I'll feel the same

I bottomed out
