Down to days, chased with night
Taste a dream, wash down my height
Braid your hair, as we gather sand
'Til the little hand comes round again

Oh no, I fear the quiet, it won't help to fight it
Haven't heard a word of theirs, I think you lost me when you said:

I've been feeling so lonesome that I could cry
But I could be brave in your bed tonight
I've been feeling so lonesome that I could cry
But I could be brave if I laid in your bed tonight

Wind those gears, as the grey sets in
Remind me now, where we've been
Meet me there, beneath your skin
Wrapped in sheets, three to the wind

Oh no, I fear the quiet, it won't help to fight it
Haven't heard a word of theirs, I think you lost me when you said:

I've been feeling so lonesome that I could cry
But I could be brave in your bed tonight
I've been feeling so lonesome that I could cry
But I could be brave if I laid in your bed tonight

Wasted, still waking up, I'm in the thick of it
Too many locks are on doors, locks of yours on my floor
Left wide open, get sucked in
But I never said 'get up now'
Never said get up, let me hear you try

I wanna raise some hell
I wanna raise some hell
I wanna shake some action
Wanna show and tell
Show and tell, show and tell
I pick myself right up
You'll never hear me coming, 
'cause I'm never gonna die

I've been feeling so lonesome that I could cry
But I could be brave in your bed tonight
I've been feeling so lonesome that I could cry
But I could be brave if I laid in your bed tonight
