Don't write a letter
When you want to leave
Don't call me at 3 a.m. from your friend's apartment

I'd like to choose
How I hear the news
Take me to a park that's covered with trees
Tell me on a Sunday, please

Let me down easy, no big song and dance
No long faces, no long looks, no deep conversation
I know the way
I want to spend that day

Take me to the zoo with fake chimpanzees
Tell me on a Sunday, please

Don't want to know who's to blame
Won't help knowing
I don't wanna fight, day and night
It's bad enough that you're going

Don't leave in silence, with no words at all
Don't get mad and slam the door
That's no way to end this
I know how I want you to say goodbye

Find a circus tent with a big trapeze
Tell me on a Sunday, please

I don't wanna fight day and night
It's bad enough that you're going

Don't leave in silence, with no word at all
Don't get mad and slam the door
That's no way to end this
I know how I want you to say goodbye

Don't ride off in the pouring rain
Don't call me as they call your plane
Take the hurt out of all the pain

Take me to a park that's covered with trees
Tell me on a Sunday, please
