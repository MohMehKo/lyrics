I went down yale today
Just in the old way
A black dog hobbled past me
His tags jangled on his collar
It made me wish i was dead
It made me wish i was dead

Had a familiar sun on me
Just like it would always be
Rocky soil dry land
I knew it all like the back of my hand
It made me wish i was dead
It made me wish i was dead

A terrific view form here
The sky's clear
The sun's high
I let things lie 
And i know what is and isn't mine
And i was good to get back to the sunshine
But 5 years is a long time
And i spent 5 years in sweden dying for you
I spent 5 years in sweden dying for you
