Don't like going to the doctor.
I don't like looking at the mirror.
I like looking out the window,
Watching the waves break.
Do I have to hit you over the head with it?
Do I have to hit you over the head with it?

Tired of talking to the suckers,
I'm tired of talking to the wealthy.
I want to talk to men and women
Who haven't got anything left.
Do I have to hit you over the head with it?
Do I have to hit you over the head with it?

Carry me down to the water
Where I used to play when I was five.
Let me go, let me go down to the water.
Don't bring me back alive.
Do I have to hit you over the head with it?
Do I have to hit you over the head with it?
