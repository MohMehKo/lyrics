The wind blew in across the water
And the wind blew through your hair
And I walked around the lake's perimeter
And then I saw you there

I will grab you by the ears
I will grab you by the ears
I will grab you by the ears and you will know something
You will know something

I saw the birds fly out across the lake
I saw the birds go by
And I walked around the lake's perimeter
And I saw the lake reflected in your eyes

I will grab you by the ears
I will grab you by the ears
I will grab you by the ears and you will know something
You will know something
