On the way home from the party
Neither of us said a word
Leann Rimes on the car stereo
Sang that song you know I hate, the one about the blackbird

And the rain came down on the windshield
I wished it would wash us both away
You had to open up your mouth, didn't you?
I knew what you were gonna say

And you were Bluebeard's wife
Opening every cupboard, trying to find the smoking gun
Well, I told you, I told you
I told you not to open that one
