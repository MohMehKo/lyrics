You were all dressed in green
Clouds bounced against the edges of the sky
You had the prettiest hair I'd ever seen
We watched the world passing by

There was an ocean's droning
Though we were nowhere near the shore
We heard each other giggling and moaning
Then we couldn't hear each other anymore

When my head was resting on your breastbone
I could hear your beating heart
And 24 hours later, you had left me completely alone
I watched the whole world come apart

And you were all dressed in green
Rising in the sky was an unfamiliar star
And you know what I mean
I remember who you are
