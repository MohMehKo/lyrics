The sun came up above a strange, white plain
Blood-red flowers all wet with rain
And the spirit wasn't really willing anymore
But the flesh was very, very strong

And I've got very little money left, and I've got no sense
But I'll have none of your goddamn impudence

The sun came up above the new white fields
Everything was new again
Pure power stripped of meaning
Sky burning, spring cleaning

Daisies on the hillside like cancer on the skin
Gritty little yellow eyes that flutter in the wind
I'd be grateful my children aren't here to see this
If you'd ever seen fit to give me children

And my defenses might be working with a skeleton crew
But I'll be skinned alive before I take this from you

The sun came up above the ocean out west
All the colors of the rainbow
Stand up straight you can see the house leaning
Day breaking, spring cleaning
