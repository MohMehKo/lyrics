When my old friend came crawling up the hill,
Broken and bloody,
Carrying her hair in clumps in her hands,
I let her right on in,
Let her right in.

When she stood at the kitchen window,
Staring out at the countryside,
And then she looked my way.
I let her right on in,
Let her right in.

And when she was stronger than she'd been before,
I opened the front door.
And then i opened the back door.
And the sunlight poured in. 
Yeah
