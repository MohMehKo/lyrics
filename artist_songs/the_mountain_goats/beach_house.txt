I get letters telling me since I moved away 
You've taken to hanging out on that rock about a mile from shore 

Given what I know about that rock mainly that it's populated by seals 
I strongly suggest to you that you not hang out there anymore 

Cause the seal is a wily and a vicious creature 
And the seal will bite you if you give him half a chance 
yeah the seal has a mind set on violence 
And the seal is the sworn enemy of man 

Now when I say that the seal is vicious I use the term advisedly 
According to Webster's 9th New Collegiate Definition 4b. 

Which states that vicious means marked by ferocity 
And offers as a synonym, savage 

Cause the seal is a vicious and a wily creature 
And the seal has a mind full of evil designs 
And the seal will harm you and laugh about it 
Yeah the seal is not a creature you want to toy with 
Yeah the seal is not a creature you want to toy with
