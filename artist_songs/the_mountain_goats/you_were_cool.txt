This is a song with the same four chords I use most of the time
When I've got something on my mind
And I don't want to squander the moment
Trying to come up with a better way to say what I want to say

People were mean to you
But I always thought you were cool
Clicking down the concrete hallways 
With your spiked heels back in high school 

It's good to be young, but let's not kid ourselves
It's better to pass on through those years
And come out the other side with our hearts still beating
Having stared down demons and come back breathing

People were mean to you
But I always thought you were cool
Clicking down the concrete hallways 
In your spiked heels back in high school

You deserved better than you got
Someone's gotta say it sometime 'cause it's true
People should have told you you were awesome
Instead of taking advantage of you

I hope you love your life now
Like I love mine
I hope the painful memories only flex their power over you
A little of the time

We held onto hope of better days coming
And when we did we were right
I hope the people who did you wrong
Have trouble sleeping at night

People were mean to you
But I always thought you were cool
Clicking down the concrete hallways 
In your spiked heels back in high school
