In january i took a short walk
Down to the broadway bridge
Two and a half blocks
When you scrape the ice away
You can read the bridge dedication
I can feel the cold air coming in through my teeth
I saw the bridge
I saw the water underneath
That's a whole lotta water
That's a whole lotta water

I took out the key that i'd forgotten the function of
Twisted it from the keyring as the bridge loomed above
I hammered it against the ice
I hammered it against the ice
