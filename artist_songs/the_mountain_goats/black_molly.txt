Black mollies in the aquarium, 
Darting back and forth as though an earthquake were certain 
And I, turned up the heater 
And I ripped off my shirt 
And I grabbed hold of my stereo 
And I threw it out the window 
You were in town again 
You'd come around again 
You were dragging me down again with you 

Siamese fish flashing like sparklers 
It started to rain 
And the telephone rang a couple of times 
I put a bullet through its cold dead brain 
And I got out my photographs of you 
And I put bullets though all of them too 
You were in town again 
You'd come around again 
You were dragging me down again with you 
Yeah
