A knocking sound it woke me up,
But my legs were feeling weak.
I stared up at the ceiling and I saw you at the window.
But my mouth wouldn't let me speak.

[Chorus:]
I know you.
You're the one I spent three seasons trying to pretend
That I never knew.

Something pulled me off the bed.
And the same thing moved the muscles in my legs.
I moved towards you voice, and my body got so light,
I could've walked on eggs right then and not broken a one of them.

[Chorus x4]
