[Spoken:]
(The actual date is the 17th of April. Love hymn to Aphrodite.)

The sunset gets a little longer every night
and it's no good but I feel alright.
the sky turns orange and the colors start swirling.
you float downstairs, your body spinning
in perfect circles.
it's the 18th of July, but what are you doing?
