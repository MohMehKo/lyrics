Hey don't touch the door
Because the door will surely kill you
I hear you saying that you don't see what I mean
Well you better look again

Stop looking at the floor
Because the whole building's turning, and turning, and turning
And don't touch the door
Can't you see the door's burning?

And all at once the street is filled with light
And all at once the street is filled with sound
When I hold you I know our number's being called somewhere
Let them come on down
