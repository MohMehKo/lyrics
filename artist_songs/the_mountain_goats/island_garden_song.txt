I will sail to the far shore
And I will chop a hole in the hull too big to repair
And I will turn the soil with my hands
And I will make my home there

My garden will grow so high
My garden will grow so high
That I will be completely hidden

I will go where I will go
And I will jettison all dead weight
And I will use these words for kindling
And I will sleep by the garden gate

My garden will grow so high
My garden will grow so high
That I will be completely hidden
