We've got the brightest skylight
Like a vision of heaven on the evening sky.
And a clocktower two block from the spot where i'm standing tonight.
The avenues are throbbing with people.
And the late sunlight makes them all look like angels.
And the transformation is seamless.
They are unbearably bright.
I can almost hear their voices
As i walk past them all toward the water.
What is there left in a city like this
When everyone you know is gone?
I saw the wind wash them all away and i was freezing
