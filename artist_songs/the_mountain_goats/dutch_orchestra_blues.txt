Somewhere in secret, the dutch orchestra's playing.
Somewhere in secret, the dutch orchestra's playing.
Real nice.
Real nice.

And they play so quiet, you can hear the passing traffic.
They play so quiet, you can hear the passing traffic.
And the cars buzz by, and the wind blows.
And i may walk past/fast?, and i may not.
And someone may notice, or it may all slide right by.
And you may love me, or you may not love me at all anymore.
But the sun will shine on holland in the spring.
And god will watch over the members of the orchestra for me
With all his available energies.
Yeah yeah
