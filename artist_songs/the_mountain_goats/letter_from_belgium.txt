Martin calls to say he's sending old electrical equipment
That's good
We can always use some more electrical equipment

In the cold clear light of day down here, everyone's a monster
That's cool with all of us
We've been past the point of help since early April

Susan and her notebook, freehand drawings of Lon Chaney
Blueprints for geodesic domes, recipes for cake
Yeah, we're all here chewing our tongues off
Waiting for the fever to break

When we walk out in the sunlight
We tell every we know it hurts our eyes
When the real reason we don't like it
Is that it makes us wonder if we're dying

And Martin's found an old trunk full of stage makeup in the basement
And he's sending it along
We can always use more makeup
Yeah, more creams and powders

And Carrie's got the feeling that the people next door
Will close in like a wolf pack should we make one small mistake
Yeah, we're all here chewing our tongues off
Waiting for the fever to break
