Well you walked into the party
Like you were walking onto a yacht.
Your hat strategically dipped beneath one eye.
Your scarf it was apricot.
You had one eye on the mirror and
You watched yourself a lot.
And all the boys dreamed that they'd be your partner,
They'd be your partner, yeah.

Well you had me several years ago
When i was still quite naive.
And you said that we made such a pretty pair
And that you would never leave.
But you gave away the things you loved,
And one of them was me.
I had some dreams there were clouds in my coffee,
Clouds in my coffee, yeah.

Well i heard that you went of to saratoga
And your horse naturally won.
And then you chartered a leer jet to nova scotia
To see the total eclipse of the sun.
Yeah, you're always where you should be and
When you're not you're with some underworld spy
Or your best friend's boyfriend.
Your best friend's boyfriend.
Yeah
