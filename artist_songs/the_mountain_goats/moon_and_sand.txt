Deep is the midnight sea
Warm is the fragrant night
Sweet are your lips to me
Soft as the moon and sand

Oh, when shall we meet again?
When the night has left us, will the spell remain?

The waves invade the shore
Though we may kiss no more
Night is at our command
Moon and sand

The waves invade the shore
And though we may kiss no more
Night is at our command
Moon and sand
