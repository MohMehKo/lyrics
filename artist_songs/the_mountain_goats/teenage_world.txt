You bought me a rabbit to keep me company
And i'm here in my car and the rabbit's here with me
Heading out highway one, respecting posted speed limits
And i tried to figure this one out but i can't find any meaning

And i'm sick and tired of trying to figure out your gestures
And i'm sick and tired of wondering what your presents mean
I'm gonna take this rabbit into malibu 
And he'll chew on sour grass while i wolf down dexadrine
Dexadrine.

The wind comes through the open window and i button my shirt
And the rabbit's riding shotgun my teeth hurt
You sent me a package marked "live animals inside"
And the sun's coming up quickly above the rising tide

And i'm sick and tired of trying to figure out your gestures
And i'm sick and tired of wondering what your presents mean
I'm gonna take this rabbit into malibu 
And he'll chew on sour grass while i wolf down dexadrine
Dexadrine
