[Woman singing:] he touched me and suddenly...

It's a cold night in sonora
And the stars are out in full force
It's a moment the world has been waiting for
When you set the world back on course
Into the fire you go
Into the fire you go

It's a strange gathering around you
And the lord of the snails is born
Five minutes before you take on divinity
You hear the crackling, well you hear the snapping corn
Into the fire you go
Into the fire you go
Into the fire you go
Into the fire you go
