Hey, what's wrong with you?
Hey, what are you trying to do?
'cause if what you had in mind
Is what i think it is
Then it's not very kind
And it won't be necessary
It won't be necessary now
It won't be necessary
It won't be necessary now

Hey, what are you doing, my love?
Hey, didn't i just tell you that such a thing
Would be over and above what's called for in this case
Pull the ski mask away from your face
It won't be necessary
It won't be necessary now
It won't be necessary
It won't be necessary now
It won't be necessary
It won't be necessary now
