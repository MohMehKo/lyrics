Breaking the signal so it's totally unreadable
Drinking the dregs, eating the utterly inedible
We do what we do
All for you

All dressed up, black hat and white cane
Slowly circling the drain
Ready for the future
Ready for the world about to come

Shooting the sequel before the treatment's even finished
Sending numbers off the monojects as our slight returns diminish
We are what we are
Get in the goddamn car

Smiling faces flawlessly rehearsed
We are sleek and beautiful, we are cursed
Ready for the future
Ready for the world about to come
