When I ask you to look at me
You look away
I ask you to tell me something nice once
You come at me with all your hot lights on display

I know you're changing
Damn you
I know you're changing
Goddamn you for that

When the snow stacked up outside
You looked around
I could see you from the window
I could see the snow coming down

I know you're changing
Damn you
I know you're changing
Goddamn you
