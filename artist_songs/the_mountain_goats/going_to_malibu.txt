When we meet on neutral ground,
I can't belive how good you look.
And the thoughts that race around my mind,
Fill a long unreadable book and

I can feel the waves,
I can sense the continents eroding,
You say you know why i called you here,
But you couldn't have any way of knowing, so
That's not true.
That's a mean thing to say.
That's a damnable lie.
That's a damnable lie.

Looking at you, and i don't know
What it is i see
And i know you're changing, almost indetectably.

And i see a ship off the shore
And i imagine it sinking.
And you smile and you say that you know
What it is that i'm thinking.
That's not true.
That's a rotten thing to say.
That's a damnable lie.
That's a damnable lie
