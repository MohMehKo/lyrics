In the morning, I looked down
Through the 3rd story window overlooking town
Across the water, somewhere, you were sleeping over there
I couldn't believe it, I couldn't believe it.
Not if I saw it with my own eyes,
(with my own eyes) [x4]

In the morning, I looked down
Through the 3rd story window overlooking town
And I saw you. and I know you saw me too.
I couldn't believe it. I couldn't believe it.
Not if I saw it with my own eyes,
(with my own eyes) [x4]
