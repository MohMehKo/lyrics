Woke up this morning about a quarter to five
Said the prayer you'd taught me to keep myself alive,
It burned my tongue.
It burned my tongue.

Fried some grains in butter, 
Said a simple grace,
Sat down at the table,
Fed my greedy face.
It burned my tongue.
It burned my tongue.

Looked out at the ocean
I could see it so clear.
Said the only name
I can ever stand to hear.
It burned my tongue
It burned my tongue.

When i ask you to sing with me
I wish you'd sing along.
Thirty years in this world -- 
Thirty years too long.
It burns my tongue.
It burns my tongue.

You tooks away my friends.
You took my will to live.
I gave you all i got.
What more have i got to give?
It burns my tongue.
It burns my tongue.
It burns my tongue.
It burns my tongue
