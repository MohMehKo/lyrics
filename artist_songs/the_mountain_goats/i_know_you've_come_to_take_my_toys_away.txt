Sun flashing red and then orange then opting for secession
On the day when you came to the door with you terrible confession
I know you've come to take my toys away and 
I know you've come to take my toys away

Skin flushing red and then glowing when you come inside
And the moonlight watching all over you i have got my mouth open wide
I know you've come to take my toys away and
I know you've come to take my toys away

And when it drops, you're gonna feel it. 
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
