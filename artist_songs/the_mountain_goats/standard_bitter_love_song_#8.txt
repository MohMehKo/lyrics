I went down to lloyd center looking for you. 
But a mouth full of anger blocked my view. 
He took your hand there in the skating the rink. 
God will give him blood to drink. 

Saw the two of you leaving. 
I didn't want to follow behind. 
But I could see the rest of your evening, 
Burning in my mind. 

The sky's black. the moon's pink. 
God will give him blood to drink. 

I looked over the railing. ice was white 
On the northeast side where I saw you and your boyfriend 
On a friday night. 
I went mining for gold. I struck pure, fresh zinc. 
God, god will give him blood to drink. 

Hey, hey, hey
