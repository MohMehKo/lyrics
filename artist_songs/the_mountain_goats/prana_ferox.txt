I went down to the basement
To check up on the sour mash
I looked down to the nonreactive ceramic tub
It was bubbling

I had stirred up the dust on the stairs coming down
I saw the dust devils swarming around
Incoming sunbeams cut them apart
And I watched a shadow pass across my heart

You were upstairs in the kitchen
With your head against the sink
Trying to cool down
Trying to cool down

I know you don't believe me but I could hear you breathing
I looked into the tub and there the mixture was seething
With new life, new life all around
I had stirred up the dust on the stairs coming down

You were upstairs in the kitchen
With your head against the sink
Trying to cool down
Trying to cool down
