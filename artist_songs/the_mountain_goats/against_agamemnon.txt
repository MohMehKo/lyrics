Red, red, red everywhere
Bright red all along the thin canvas wall
I stepped outside for a little air
I stepped outside to get away from it all

I went out to the front and saw the purple sky
Making jokes about my condition

I am going for a walk
I'll be back in half an hour
Watch over the children
I'll be back in half an hour
