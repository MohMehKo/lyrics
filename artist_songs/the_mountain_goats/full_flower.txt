I saw the ceiling spin
And I saw the room shift
And I watched my television flicker
And I let my mind drift

I would give anything in the world up for you
But I will not stop

I saw the blossom form
And I saw the screen glow
And I let my arm fall to my side
And I took one step back

I would give anything in the world up for you
But I will not stop
