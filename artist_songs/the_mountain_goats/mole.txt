I came to see you up there in intensive care
They had handcuffed you to your bed
There were tubes threading into you, coming out from you
Bright white gauze bandages at your head

I am a mole
Sticking his head above the surface of the earth
I am a mole
Sticking his head above the surface of the earth

And then they said lights out, and it was lights out
And they gave you your medication
I know what you want, you know what I want
Information, information

I am a mole
Sticking his head above the surface of the earth
I am a mole
Sticking his head above the surface of the earth

Out in the desert, we will have no worries
Out in the desert, just you and me
I came to see you, up there in intensive care
Out in the desert, we'll live carefree

I am a mole
Sticking his head above the surface of the earth
I am a mole
Sticking his head above the surface of the earth
