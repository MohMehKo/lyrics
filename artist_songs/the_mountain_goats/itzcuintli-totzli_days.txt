I hear the pads beat, loud as drums
I know he's coming. let him come

[Chorus]
Let the big big rabbit come out
Let the big big rabbit come down
Let him cast his shadow on the bright face of our little house
Let him dance through the garden
Let him come

It's getting darker, as the sky grows colder
And I feel your hand on my naked shoulder
Praise god I know you're with me. I know you're here
I can feel you breathing. I know you're near me
Ok

[Chorus]
