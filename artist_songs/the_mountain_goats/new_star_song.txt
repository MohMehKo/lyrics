I hung pictures of you from every lamp post in town
As the humidity climbed into numbers I don't care to repeat
The air was heavy and the sky was alive
And the pacific starlight train wasn't due in till 11. 45

[Chorus]
I thought about how cold you must be
I thought about things I thought that I'd soon be forgetting
I thought of you up in Canada as the lightning storm lit up
All downtown redding

There were teenagers in mini-trucks coming around every corner
You can taste the adrenaline, coming out through their skin
I came to the well-lit doorway of a sheet music store
Saw my face in the glass. sat down in the doorway and I settled in

[Chorus]
