You have got that look in your eyes
In the pinprick point where kindness goes to die
I'll be six years old next year
You erase me

You'll be sorry, you always feel sorry later on
When you come around to say so, I will be gone
And in my place, meet my letter perfect body double
You erase me

And a few years later, I set out on my own
Learned to take the reins up all by myself
Dug the spurs in clean down to the bone

But all that comes later
Now there's only you and me
And the replica where my body used to be
You can go ahead and hit him
He feels no pain at all
You erase me
You erase me
