I am wearing a white long-sleeve button-down
The pink colors behind the clouds tonight mirror the softer shades of your nightgown
As the neurotransmitters go crazy inside of me, you swear you're leaving town
Empty promises, empty promises

I am watching the way the wind seems to pass straight through your body
When you run your fingernail along my neck and you spill some water on me
You say you're as good as gone, well don't look now, but here comes the dawn
Empty promises, empty promises, empty promises, empty promises
