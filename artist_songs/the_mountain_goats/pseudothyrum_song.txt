Why do you treat me this way?
And why do you try so hard to break my spirit?
I think someone was mean to you when you were little,
That's what i think.
I think someone was mean to you.

Why do you cling to such petty points of contention?
And why don't you allow one or two small victories now and then?
I think someone was mean to you when you didn't deserve it,
That's what i think.
I think someone was mean to you.

But i, i am not that guy.
Can you get that straight?
I am a completely different person
From the one you have in mind.

Why do you stand by the things you say long after
You don't mean to hurt anybody anymore?
I think someone was mean to you
For a long, long time, that's what i think.
I think someone was mean to you
