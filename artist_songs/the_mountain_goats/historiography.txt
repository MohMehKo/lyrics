There was rain, there was wind
There was spring coming in
There was a feeling of approaching doom
I was happy to see you

It was cold in your room and you were warm
And that's all I remember
And your arms were warm
And that's all I remember

Later on, near morning
We were talking about nothing
A little rain, a little wind
Quiet cold, cold air coming in

And you were warm
And that's all I remember
And your arms were warm
And that's all I remember

And your eyes were pretty
And that's all I remember
And your hands were soft
And that's all I remember

And the hall was well-lit as I walked down it
And that's all I remember
And the rain was light and it felt soft on my face
And that's all I remember

And the car was quiet inside
And that's all I remember
And it was dark but the sunlight was coming
And that's all I remember
