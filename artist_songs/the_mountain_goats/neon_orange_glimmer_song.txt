There's a capsicum pepper plant growing
Out in the backyard
There's a capsicum pepper plant growing
Out in the backyard

And I, I am a monster
I can't believe the thing I've done
I can't believe the thing I've done

There's a friend of mine living in Dallas
About a two days' drive from here
Got a friend of mine living in Dallas
And that's a two days' drive from here

And I, I am a monster
I can't believe the thing I've done
I can't believe the thing I've done

And there's a cold wind blowing
And there's a silver bell hanging
And there's a silver bell ringing

And I, I am a monster
I can't believe the thing I've done
I can't believe the thing I've done
