When death came calling today
I heard the gentle grace of his cadences
I couldn't say no
I couldn't say no

When he showed me his new silk scarves
Laid out on a shiny black plastic tray
Couldn't say, couldn't say, couldn't say, couldn't say, couldn't say no
I couldn't say no

And I'm sorry I couldn't
Do you know how badly I wanted to?
Didn't want, didn't want, didn't want, didn't want, didn't want to lose you
But his smile was dazzling

And his eyes were sparkling
Like moonlight on the water at midnight
Couldn't say, couldn't say, couldn't say, couldn't say, couldn't say, couldn't say no
I couldn't say no
