We were hungry
There was no food
We were restless
There were too many things to do
So we gathered
In a concrete room
Eyes up at you
And in a small room in Brazil
We were waiting
And in a small room in Brazil
We were waiting

We were howling
Like dogs
We were feeling
The full brunt of the age
Guys from our neighborhood
Looking down at us
All of you, all of you
Rage, rage, rage
And in a small room in Brazil
We were waiting
And in a small room in Brazil
We were waiting
