One, two, three, and...

Sift through the things we had that seem worth fighting for
Dig through the embers
Seek out a witness to the times we used to share
We doubt the pretenders

Go and find you an Etruscan

Reveal the hidden truth about the serpent's tooth
Try not to get romantic
Tell tales about white whales, way out in the Atlantic

Go and find you an Etruscan

Seek out his dwelling place, describe his face for the record
Seek out the feral child, head out into the wild 
Send word when you get there
I'll wait here day and night, hoping you'll be alright
Sadly knowing better

Go and find you an Etruscan
Go and find you an Etruscan
