Through the shifting colors in the sky
I heard the wild geese call.
And the liwas bright and clear and cold
Over eastern Montreal
And although, I know
You're only toying with me now,
And although, I know
You hold your affection for me like a bone on a string
I love you, I love you because
You gave me sausage and cheese when I was hungry.

You hold your closed hand out to me
And you told me to guess what you had inside
And I had a thousand guesses and some of them were good
But I knew for some reason that I was losing my mind
When the scent came rising
Through the spaces between your fingers
When the scent called to me
And I know we'd last at least until the end of december
I love you, I love you because
You gave me sausage and cheese when I was hungry
