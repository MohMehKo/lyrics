The summer crawled by indetectably.
And then i saw you looking down to me.
And your earrings sparkled in the noon-day sun,
And though it's very true that i love everyone,
With every ounce of energy left in me,
I love you especially because

I saw you, coming through
The screen door on the second floor,
Up on the balcony.

It was hard to even see you at all,
Because the air was thick with alcohol
So i kept on rubbing my eyes,
For all the good it did me,
For all the immeasurable good it did me,
Let the years come and take away my memory,
I will not forget the shock that ran through me when,

I saw you, coming through
The screen door on the second floor,
Up on the balcony
