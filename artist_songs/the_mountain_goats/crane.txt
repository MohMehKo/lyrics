Picked up a fat, gold watch for you
Down where the river washes over the avenue.
And i listened to it tick away the minutes.
Looked out at the awful sky.

I was afraid that my arm was broken, 
But it was only kinda run down.
I went walking after two last night,
Felt like i was the only guy in town.
And i'm not.
I know.
And i don't need you to tell me so.
Look at this watch.
Look at this watch.
You won't believe what this thing can do
