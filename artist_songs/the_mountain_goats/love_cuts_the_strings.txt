The first thing that happened was the river overflowed
The water running through the streets and was sweet and cold
I knelt by the water like a doe by a stream
Punch-drunk, snowblind, as though the whole thing were a bad dream

And then love pulled out the heavy artillery
Kypris took the horses by the bit for the morning ride
I count my blessings, but you can only be expected to count so high
When love cuts the strings

I smeared myself with pennyroyal to keep the hounds at bay
You poked your head out of an alley half a block away
And i recognized you, though i'm not sure how
And the air turned red around you
As a dull chill came down over me

And then love summoned up the infantry
And the green-eyed goddess got ready for all out war
And i'd count my blessings,
But i don't even know what the word blessing means
When love cuts the strings
Yeah!
