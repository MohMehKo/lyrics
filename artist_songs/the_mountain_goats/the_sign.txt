[John spoken:] I never get tired of this one...

I've got a new life
You would hardly recognize me.
I'm so glad.
How could a person like me care for you?
Why should I bother when you're not the one?

I saw the sign
And it opened up my eyes I saw the sign.
Love is demanding without understanding
Yeah I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes I saw the sign
And noone's gonna drag you up.

Under the pale moon,
For so many years I've wondered who you are.
How could a person like you bring me joy?
Under the pale moon where I see a lot of stars.

I saw the sign
And it opened up my eyes I saw the sign.
Love is demanding without understanding
Yeah I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes I saw the sign
And noone's gonna drag you up
To get into the light where you belong.

I saw the sign
And it opened up my eyes I saw the sign.
Love is demanding without understanding
Yeah I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes I saw the sign
And noone's gonna drag you up
Hey!
