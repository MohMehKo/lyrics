Rainbows shone on the glass
Dew drops gathered on the grass
And the yellow sun came into view
Another goddamn message from you

Well, despite your best efforts I feel alright
Against my better judgment I feel alright
Despite your random acts of violence I feel alright
Despite the force of your fury I feel alright

You're mean to me
Why must you be mean to me?
You shouldn't forget, you see
What you mean to me
