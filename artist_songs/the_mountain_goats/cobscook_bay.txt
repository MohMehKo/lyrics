We're alone most of the time these days.
Jill used to come by, but she went away.
And gail used to come around and trash the joint,
But she moved off to dana point.
And you went along, just for the ride,
And you both committed suicide.
And day is breaking over cobscook bay.
And I've never seen anything like it in my life.

Cow gave birth and her calves are snow white
The huddle up close together at night.
And the mamma cow leans down and cleans her young.
Licking their faces with her tongue, 
And unmarked airplanes buzz the air.
And you're falling off that cliff somewhere in California --
Which I've never seen.
I put the pieces all together, but I don't know what they mean,
And day is breaking over cobscook bay.
And I've never seen anything like it in my life
