Slumped up against the sink
Hair plastered to her cheeks
Marduk t-shirt sticking to her skin
Refugee from a disco in old East Berlin

Weightless
Formless
Blameless
Nameless

Stray syllables were gurgling
From her throat, one at a time
Face hidden from my view
I let myself imagine she was you

Only weightless
Formless
Blameless
Nameless

And when I washed my hands
I ran the water hotter than I could stand
Half rising to a crouch
Sinking back down to the floor

In your walking, keep your head low
Try to leave no traces when you go

Stay weightless
Formless
Blameless
Nameless
