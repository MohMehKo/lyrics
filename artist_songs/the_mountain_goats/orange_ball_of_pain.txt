When I saw it on the bakery carousel
I knew I had to have it for my own
I eased it out and I brought it home

Why don't you try some?
I already had some myself
Is that the most delicious thing
You ever tasted in your life?

Is that the most delicious thing
You ever tasted in your life?

And then the cold sorrow gripped me by the throat
And then I felt the colder sadness taking hold
I knew I had to have it for my own

Why don't you try some?
Why don't you try some?
Is that the most delicious thing
You ever tasted in your life?

Is that the most delicious thing
You ever tasted in your life?

And then I saw the snow against the window
And I saw the snow hit the window
And I saw the snow brush against the window
And I saw the snow in here
