Well, guy in a skeleton costume comes up to the guy in the Superman suit
Runs through him with a broadsword
I flip the television off, bring all the bright lights up
Turn the radio up loud

I don't know why I'm so persuaded
That if I think things through
Long enough and hard enough
I'll somehow get to you

But then you came in and we locked eyes
You kicked the ashtray over as we came toward each other
Stubbed my cigarette out against the west wall
Quickly lit another

Look at that, would you look at that?
We're throwing off sparks
What will I do when I don't have you
To hold onto in the dark?

Yes, everybody's going to need a witness
Everybody's going to need a little backup in case the scene gets nasty
You throw the attic window open and I throw myself all around you
And night comes to Tallahassee

I don't know why it's gotten harder to keep myself away
Thought I'd finally beat the feeling back, it all came back today
And then we fell down and we locked arms, we knocked the dresser over as we rolled across the floor
I don't mean it when I tell you that I don't love you anymore

Look at that, would you look at that?
The way the ceiling starts to swerve
What will I do when I don't have you?
When I finally get what I deserve
