The new rose floating on water in the old plain bowl
The white clouds on night sky
They way they just roll on by made me think of you
And the religious cult of flesh disillusion you've committed yourself to
Alagemo, alagemo

The night crawlers poking their little slimy heads through the dirt
Made me think of you again
Made me think of you a third time
I don't know where you've gone
But i hear your voice droning on
Alagemo, alagemo
