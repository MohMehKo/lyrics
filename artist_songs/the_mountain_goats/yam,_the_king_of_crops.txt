Felt sick, felt good
The heat burns, old wood
Muscles in my arms pump like machines
The jericho palm tree is plush and green

Bright sun, the new day
I felt sick in a good way
Felt the fever climb when you came down
All the way across town

And you brought me a plate of sweet potatoes

Sun fading overhead
The sunset, bright red
Your green eyes, your smooth walk
Fresh tomato, celery stalk, you cook
Pot of pari basmati rice
I felt good, you looked nice
You stood like galatea, over me
Fried garlic, kim chee
And you brought me a plate of sweet potatoes
