Gotta keep moving, gotta keep moving
Blues falling down like hail
Gotta keep moving
Blues falling down like hail

And the daylight keeps moving
There's a hellhound on my trail

If today were Christmas eve
And tomorrow Christmas day
And if today were Christmas eve
And tomorrow were Christmas day

All I would need is my little rider
And the world would fade away

Gotta keep moving, gotta keep moving
Blues falling down like hail
Gotta keep moving
Blues falling down like hail

And the daylight keeps ta worryin' me
There's a hellhound on my trail
