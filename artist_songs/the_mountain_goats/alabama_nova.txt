Your house is depressing
Your house is dirty
Why don't you come outside a little while?
Why don't you step out into the sun?

Let me take you down
Let me ease you around
Montgomery

And out there on the front porch
Your hair shines in the sun
And I can see the sun gathering on your eyes
What the hell are you looking at?

Let me take you down
Let me ease you around
Montgomery
