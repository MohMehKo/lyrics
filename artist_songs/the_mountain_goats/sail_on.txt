Sail on down the road
'bout a half a mile or so 
And I tried to make you stay, 
But now you're going
It was plain to see that a small town boy like me
Just wasn't your cup of tea that was wishful thinking
I gave you my heart and I tried to make you happy
You gave me nothing in return
You know it ain't so hard to say, 'would you please just go away?'

You come to comfort me 
But I don't need your sympathy
And the way you look at me, well it's condescending.
I feel my stomach churn
And didn't you ever learn 
Not to tell someone something if you don't mean it
I gave you my heart and I tried to make you happy
You gave me nothing in return
You know it ain't so hard to say, 'would you please just go away?'

Sail on.
Sail on.
Sail on
