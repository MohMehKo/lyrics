Hurry the bottle, mama
It's grapefruit wine
Kick off your high-heeled sneakers
It's party time

The girls don't seem to care what's on
As long as it plays 'til dawn
No static at all

Give her some fucked-up music
She treats you nice
Feed her some hungry reggae
She'll love you twice

The girls don't seem to care tonight
As long as the mood is right
No static at all
No static at all
