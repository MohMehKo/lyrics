A bird you would've liked brought the sky down,
But it was useless to see it without you around.
And in the unstoppable camera of my mind's eye,
I saw you and some foreign guy.

And I could hear you voice ringing.
And I could hear you singing.
From all the way across the country in palm springs,
I can hear you now.

Your laughter tore through the new jersey night,
And I can't stand it, but I'm alright.
Stood out on the balcony and I took a look around
And a bird you would've loved the sight of
Brought the sky down.

And I can hear you voice ringing.
And I can hear you singing.
From all the way across the country in palm springs,
I can hear you now.
