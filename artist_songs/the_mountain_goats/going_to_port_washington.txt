The trees were all decked out in their best fall colors
There was a snap in the air
When you eased down the window
And the New York sun brought out the highlights in your hair

And gently, gently
The constellations aligned
And as we crossed over the Frogneck's Bridge
I had something on my mind

When we rolled down the street
In the cool of the morning
I could feel the new day dawn
And somebody had gone and turned the waterworks on

And slowly, surely
I saw the whole story unwind
I had never loved anyone like I loved you
And I had something on my mind
