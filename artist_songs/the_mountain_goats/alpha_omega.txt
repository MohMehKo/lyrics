On the morning you went away
The air was humid and the sky was gray

I had boiled peanuts for breakfast from cairo, georgia

The air was wet, my face was wetter
The pink flowers along the western window made me feel better
I turned the air conditioner on
Found the note on scented stationary - you were long gone

I had boiled peanuts for breakfast from cairo, georgia

I popped the top off of the aluminum can
Let the brine slide down my fingers, man
It was warm, it was warm on my skin
But i felt the cold blast looming on in
