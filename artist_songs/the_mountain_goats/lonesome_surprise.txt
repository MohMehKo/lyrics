Alright hit it... 1.2.3.4.

Doctor, doctor can you help me please?
All these pills and problems, keep piling down on me

(here's your lonesome surprise) [x3]

Go allen.

I had a name
Had a place
But like the clothes I wear
The holes grow everywhere
'til it's like having nothing at all

(here's your lonesome surprise) [x3]
Walked out of my shower, feeling more wet than baptized

(here's your lonesome surprise) [x4]

Whoo yeah...ha-ha.. wow this is global!
...we love you holland...allen callaci...thank you very much
