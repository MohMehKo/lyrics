But meanwhile downstairs, I'm setting up shop
A little too proud to let the matter drop
And I can hear you up there
Isn't it romantic?
You're huffing and puffing rearranging
Deck chairs on the titanic
And I reach for a glass of cool water drawn
From the rivers of babylon

And meanwhile outside, the stars have come out
And the humid summer air pulls at the ring in my snout
And you stand at your window looking down
And I spread wide my arms
Jump if you want to jump, jump if you want to
The water's warm

I know
I know 'cause I've been swimming
Blindly along through the rivers of babylon
