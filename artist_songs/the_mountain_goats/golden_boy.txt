[Spoken Intro:] Hello there Paul! I had a take and I listened to it and I was ready to send it and I thought: you know...?
It can be done better. So here it is, then. Now I'm wearing my boots, which always guarantees a good show.

You must try to lead a good life
You must do unto others as you would have them do
So that when you die you'll find golden boy peanuts waiting in the
Afterlife for you

There are no pan asian supermarkets down in hell
So you can't buy golden boy peanuts
There are no pan asian supermarkets down in hell
So you can't buy golden boy peanuts

If thine enemy oppresseth you
You must let him oppress you some more
So that when you go shopping in paradise
You'll find those magnificent peanuts from singapore
With the drawing of the young chinese farmer
The eastern sun behind him smiling at you from the shelves
If we want to spend eternity in happiness
Well we're gonna have watch ourselves
You must give to the march of dimes
You must be on guard against wickedness at all times
And you'll find that your efforts have brought you great joy
When your spirit is munching on that golden boy

There are no pan asian supermarkets down in hell
So you can't buy golden boy peanuts there
But the streets of heaven are lined with shelves
And there's billboards of the golden boy everywhere
There are no pan asian supermarkets down in hell
So you can't buy golden boy peanuts
There are no pan asian supermarkets down in hell
So you can't buy golden boy peanuts... GO!
