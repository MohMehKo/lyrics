The last of the repercussions died off real slow
The sky was still and the cold sun sank down beneath the snow
I hung by my hand from the tree outside
And I looked the whole wide world

The voices came quietly, I shut them down
A tricky young southerly wind came at me with its high whistling sound
I turned around to face it with real arrogance burning inside
And I drank in the whole wide world
