If you get there before me, will you save me a seat?
If you get there before me, would you save me a seat?
And if I never get there at all
Would you leave the seat empty?

If you get there before me, will you light us a fire?
If you get there before me, will you light us a fire?
And if I never show, will you watch the embers glow?
Would you keep the fire burning?

This is a song for you
In case I never make it through to where you are
This is a song for you
In case I never make it through to where you are
