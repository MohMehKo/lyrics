Bluejays and cardinals all come out to play
The highway traffic gets out of your way
Skies clear up if they're overcast
Pit bulls are gentle when you come past

Stars come out hiding for you
And I would too but this world couldn't hold you
You slipped free

Yeah, this world couldn't hold you
You slipped free
Without me

New sheen all over everything
When you open up your mouth to sing
Baseballs travel further when you watch them fly
Apples fatten on the trees when you walk by

You bring something unreplacable to each and every day
Or you used to, anyway

But this world couldn't hold you
And you slipped free
Yeah, this world couldn't hold you
And you slipped free

Without me
