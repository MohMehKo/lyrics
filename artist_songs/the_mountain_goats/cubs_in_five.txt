They're gonna find intelligent life up there on the moon
And the canterbury tales will shoot up to the top of the best seller list
And stay there for 27 weeks

And the chicago cubs will beat every team in the league
And the tampa bay bucs will make it the way to january
And I will love you again
I will love you, like I used to
I will love you again
I will love you, like I used to

The stars are gonna spell out the answers to tomorrow's crosswords
And the phillips corporation will admit that they've made an awful mistake
And bill gates
Will single handedly spearhead the heaven seventeen revival

And the chicago cubs will beat every team in the league
And the tampa bay bucs will take it all the way to the top
And I will love you again
I will love you, like I used to
And I will love you again
I will love you, like I used to
