A neighboring clan went on the attack
And stole all the giant coco-yams from the barn out back
I will make them pay for taking my yams away

I carved out little figurines of thieves
Burned a palmful of red dust from the medicine bag
Broke a kola nut in half, i hate half of it myself
Sat back and watched the evening drag
I will make them regret that they haven't brought my yams back yet
