I looked you up and down
I liked everything I saw
From the fragile outline of your hips
To the trembling movements in your jaw
But when the coffee cup shattered on the kitchen floor
You said that you couldn't take it anymore
I knew you were leaving
I knew you were going to bristol

Going to bristol
Going to bristol
Going to bristol
Going to bristol

I watched you pack your bags
Saw you head up to the door
But when the key broke off in the deadbolt lock
Said that you couldn't take it anymore
That was the second time you said that in one day
Why don't you just sit still
It's going to be okay
Going to bristol
Going to bristol
Going to bristol 
Going to bristol
