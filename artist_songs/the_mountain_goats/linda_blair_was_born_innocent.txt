Gentle hum of the old machines
Here we come, scrubbed and scoured, patches on our jeans
When the drone sounds in the cool night wind
We pick up the call, kick all the traces in

Hungry for love
Ready to drown
So tie down the sails
We're going downtown

Great big drain on the power grid
You may not like Tate's methods but you've got to admit she's a real nice kid
We walk light down the wires
Higher than weather balloons, empty hearts on fire

Hungry for love
Ready to drown
So tie down the sails tonight
We're going downtown
