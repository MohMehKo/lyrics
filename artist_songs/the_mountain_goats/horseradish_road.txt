The way that everybody's voice
Comes out muffled when they speak
The way we take our diminishing inventories
Month to month and week to week

The Maria Callas record's
On the stereo all the time
You're gonna get yours
And I'm gonna get mine

'Cause in this car, in this car
Somebody's bound to get burned
I know, I know
'Cause I've been watching the road turn

The enigma variations
On the radio
The things that I could guess at
The things that I already know

And the twelve thousand dollars
That turned up in your purse
You've done something awful
I've done something worse

And in this car, in this car
Somebody's bound to get burned
I know, I know
'Cause I've been watching the road turn
