Saw your arms hanging at your side
Nowhere to run to, baby, nowhere to hide
Saw you moving real slow
Nowhere to run to, nowhere to go
I heard the wind blow
I saw your sash come untied
Blue water, white sky

Up in the cedars, we were too far away
For the radio to tell us the time of day
But there was moisture in the air
I heard the city call
They can go on burning
To hell with them all
Your liquid movements
The water rushing by
Blue water, white sky

World's surface was as smooth as glass
And they saw the hour coming and they didn't let it pass
I heard you say my name twice through your teeth
I saw you coming down to me, I was underneath
It's been coming for some time
You close your eyes
Blue water, white sky

I heard the wind blow
I saw your sash come untied
Blue water, white sky
