Everything I've told you was true
So imagine my surprise when I blink my eyes
And realize that I've been talking to you
And I've told you everything

And I shake my hair, and I look about

And the wild dogs are hungry
And the wild dogs howl
And the wild dogs in the mountains to the north of us
Come down
