You've come back from yosemite
You brought an aromatic cedar bookmark for me
And a brand new stuffed bear
It's summertime, you've cut your hair
And i am leaving you, and i am sorry

You come in through the back door
Why're you coming in like that, smiling for?
I've got something i need to tell you
I can feel your smile burning through
And i am leaving you, and i am sorry
