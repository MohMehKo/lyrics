In an hour or two the sun will rise on you
And it will be clear what has happened between us
In an hour or two the wind will come through the window
The wind will tear through the house

I am creeping up the staircase one step at a time
To bring you roses and chocolate
Roses and chocolate
Roses, roses, roses
