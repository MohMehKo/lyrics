I cut myself a two-foot switch from some tropical hardwood nearby
And the sounds of a carnival drifted miraculously through the air from a thousand miles away
The monkeys jumped from tree to tree, it sent a deathly chill through me
In Bolivia

Wildcats I had never seen claimed places in my room
Animal noises rang through the thick brush like voices from the tomb
I saw the freshly polished chrome gleaming in the midday sun
And I knew that you were coming home to Bolivia
