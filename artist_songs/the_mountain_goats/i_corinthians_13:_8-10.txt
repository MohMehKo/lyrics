We heard the rats in the rafters scurry by
And we wondered about the color of the sky outside
In Warsaw, in 1939 it was all right just to be alive
It was good that you were mine

And you held your hands up
To form a heart in the air
You held your hands up with your thumbs touching
They formed a heart in the air

Through the piece missing from the brick wall
We had an excellent view of the soldiers coming down the hall
And you held your hands up where I could see them in the dark and they formed a heart in the air
You held your hands up and they formed a heart in the air

I heard the old songs radiating from you
I heard the old songs radiating from you
