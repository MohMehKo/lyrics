I was sitting in the street when the news came my way
I was sitting in the street when the news came my way
Good news, good news, good news, good news
I was sitting in the street when the messenger came by
I was sitting in the street when the messenger came my way
Good news, good news like a rare blood disorder
Good news, good news

I was sitting in the street
I don't believe I've made it clear what exactly I mean by that
I was sitting in the middle of the street
Dust made its way into my legs even though my shirt was tucked in
And I saw the colors forming in the west
Saw the bright feathers reflected in the sky, now
Good news, good news, good news, good news
