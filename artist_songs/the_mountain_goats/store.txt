In the five minutes worth of lost time that I had,
When I was passed out on the supermarket floor,
I saw you at the head of the heavenly chorus.
And I heard your song ringing all through the store.

In the five minutes when my broadcast got pre-empted,
I saw you touch down. you were no longer dead.
I was happy to see ya. I had lots of questions.
And I put my hand to the wound in your head.
Ah, the blood!
All of that blood!
All of that warm blood flowing freely from you.

In the five minutes when I was dead to the world,
In a place far away from my friends and my home,
I saw you with a smile on your radiant face,
Amidst all of the cans and the glass and the chrome.

And in those five minutes, my signal was jammed.
The frequencies that I received were so pure,
That I almost believed that the sight of the hole in your skull
Was a thing that my heart could endure.
Ah, the blood!
All of that blood!
All of that warm blood flowing freely from you!
