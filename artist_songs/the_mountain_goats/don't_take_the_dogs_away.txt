Don't take the dogs away.
Don't take that dog away from me.
Don't take the dogs away.
Don't take the dogs away from me.

You do this every time.
You do this every time I swear.
You do this every time.
You do this every time I learned.

Just look around.
Just look around the house we're in.
What should i say to you?
Where do you want me to begin?

Don't take the dogs away.
Don't take the dogs away from me.
Don't take the dogs away.
Don't take the dogs away from me.
