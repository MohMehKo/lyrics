I know you see Mars in the sky tonight
I know you can see Venus rising and veering off to the right
But can you see that young star overhead?
It's the one that designed my undoing

I know that in California the waves break on the beach
And I know that the foam on the breaking waves is as white as household bleach
But do you see that particular white right now?
It's the color of the young star coming on down

I got joy, joy, joy in my soul tonight
I got joy, joy, joy in my arms alright
Although you treat me badly, I love you madly
You really got a hold on me, you really got a hold on me
