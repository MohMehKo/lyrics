I saw the long row of blue bells.
I saw the fox glove and the night shade.
I saw the cool garden and i though a while about
How i'd been waiting for you since the second grade.
The flowers made the air boil.
The boiling air made me think of you a while.
I did not come here to suffer.
I did not come here to suffer.

I heard the ducks all quacking.
I saw the sunshine on the lake.
I saw you standing near the water
And wondered how long i'd be paying for one dumb mistake.
The sight of you was really something else.
But i don't know what that something else was.
I did not come here to suffer.
I did not come here to suffer
