Tunneled down into the core
Flying through the trap door
Soft, pink sky full of rumpled clouds
Radio up loud

There's a part in the speakers
Where I hear your voice come through
So brave and true
When did I lose sight of you?
Come and rattle your chain
All you want, you're always gonna be welcomed
Here in the hallways that you used to haunt

Ride the sentimental rodeo
Down to where the shadows grow
Long while since I felt this way
Stand by the window, wait for days

There's a part in the speakers
Where I hear your voice come through
So brave and true
Let me never lose sight of you
Come and battle your chain
All you want, you're always gonna be welcomed
Here in the hallways that you used to haunt
