this magic moment,
so different and so new.
like any other.
until I kissed you.
and then it happened.
it took me by surprise.
I knew you felt it too,
by the look in you eyes.

sweeter than wine,
softer than a summer night.
the feeling I had inside,
whenever I held you tight.

this magic moment,
with your lips so close to mine,
will last forever,
forever till the end of time.
whoaaa, whoaaa, whoaaa.
