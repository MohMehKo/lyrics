Lay out on the patio, dreaming [2x]
And the chinese rifles sounded in the evening air
I heard them popping off everywhere

I lay out on the patio, on the chaise lounge
I lay out on the patio, and I let my hand rest against the hot redwood frame
And the chinese rifles sounded again
Could not stomach their acumen
