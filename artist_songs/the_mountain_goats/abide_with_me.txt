Abide with me
Fast falls the eventide
The darkness deepens, lord with me abide
When other helpers fail, and comforts flee
Help out the helpless, lord abide with me

Swift to its close
Ebbs out life's little day
Earth's joys grow dim
Its glories pass away
Change and decay in all around i see
O thou who changest not,
Abide with me
