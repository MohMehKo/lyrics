Seventeen years ago
They told me to teach you everything I know
I let the fire rain down
Rain down

Watched it flare up inside his heart
Saw it tearing him completely apart
Head to toe
I know

And blood will run
Through the streets of Rome today
And roll across the ocean

Fourteen years ago tonight
Watched him tearing through the garden, killing everything in sight
I let my curiosity
Get the best of me

I saw the sourceless anger eating at him from inside
No one around him to stem the rising tide
Evil from his head down to his feet
Quinine's bitter, sugar's sweet

And blood will run
Through the streets of Rome today
And roll across the ocean
