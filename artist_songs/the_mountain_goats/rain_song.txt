[John spoken]
...the mountain goats on the umm
Well, the um twenty fouth of january - a monday, at about ten
And this is called uh, this is called,
Well I don't know what it's called
By the time I write it down, the title is on the tape
And then I'll know what it's called

The rain came down
Soaked the old habachi
And I wish I could sing, like allen callaci
And then you would know
How sad it was, when the rain came down

Drop by drop
Gallon by gallon
Brother if I could sing,
If I could sing like allen
You would know
And understand how sad it was when the rain came down
