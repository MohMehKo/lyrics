Dull powder blue paint job.
Earl scheib special.
Dashboard full of talismans to try and push fate.
Rabbit skull hanging from the rearview.
Six kicking cylinders, lined up straight,
And I ride.
And I glide down the streets of this city all night, uptight.
Jenny's on the cellular, high as a kite.

There's a crack in the windshield eighteen inches long.
Evaporating snow forming crystals on the chrome.
Brand new battery I shoplifted from the pep boys.
Full cranking power to bring me on home,
And I ride.
And I glide down the streets of this city all night, uptight.
Jenny's on the cellular, high as a kite.
Sometimes the moon shines like a beacon to the weary and the sick in spirit.
Sometimes... sometimes it's dark.
