He alone reigns from Heaven above
We serve a mighty God
Like the angels bless His name

In the mountain of His Holiness

Blessed be the name of the righteous one

Forever and always, now, we praise Him
Exalt Your holy name
In the mountain of His Holiness

How great thou art
Thy throne, oh Lord, is forever and ever
How great thou art
[x2]

Said you're wonderful
Said you're marvelous
[x6]

How great thou art...
