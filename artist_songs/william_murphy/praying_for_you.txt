Lord I'm praying for my brother, cause I know he wants to do your will. Yes
And I'm praying for my sister cause I know you want to set her free, set her free, set her free.
Praying for the body of Christ, I know you're gonna have your way, yes.
If you're listening and you're hurting real bad, don't worry I can hear him say.

I'm praying for you, when I pray things change. [x2]

And now cast all your cares to him, the Lord will free your mind
Despite the pain you feel, he will come through.
Now I'm praying for you. Said I'm praying for you.
Hallelujah, hallelujah.

Hold your head up my brother, though sometimes it may be hard to do. Yeah
You just be encouraged, cause I've been in that position to.
And, you've been feeling so lonely, sometimes you don't know where to go, what to do, where to turn,
But, if you're listening and you want a way out, here is something you just ought to know.

Know that I'm praying for you, when I pray things change. [x2]

So now cast all your cares on him, the Lord will free your mind.
Despite the pain you feel, he will come through.
I just came to tell you, I'm praying for you.
I'm praying for you.

Things are gonna get better,
Hold your head up.

Things are gonna get better, better, better, better [2x]

Cast all your cares on him, the Lord will free your mind.
Despite the pain you feel, he will come through.
God told me to tell you tonight, I'm praying for you.

It's already better
