The Sound
There is a sound that you are waiting to hear,
(The sound) that you will use to break your people through,
So we lift our voices in praise,
Praise is what we do,
And we'll sing unto you Lord,
Until you break us through,
It's the sound that you heard at Jericho,
It's the sound that you heard in that Philippian jail,
It's the sound that you will use to set your people free,
There is a sound that tells me what you need,
(The sound) that sound that draws me to where you are, tells me what you're ready for,
So we lift our voices in praise,
Praise is what I do,
And we'll sing unto you Lord,
Until you break us through,
It's the sound that you heard at Jericho,
It's the sound that you heard in that Philippian jail,
It's the sound that you will use to set your people free,
It's the sound that you heard (when I was going through)
It's the sound that you heard (when I was crying out for you)
It's the sound that you will use to set your people free,
It's the sound of Jubilee, set your people free,
Release my destiny, I want it all back
It's the sound of Jubilee, set your people free
Release my destiny, I want it all back
Set your people free [4x's]
I want it all [4x's]
Set your people free...
