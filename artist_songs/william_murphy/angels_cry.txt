We lift up our hands,
We lift our hands in praise to Your name.
We lift up our voices,
We make a joyful noise and proclaim,

We want to see You high and lifted up
For all the world to see.
Consume us in Your presence
As we declare Your majesty.
Manifest Your glory
As heaven and earth adore You.
With the angels we cry,
Holy, Holy.

Holy, Holy!

With the angels we cry,
Holy, Holy.
