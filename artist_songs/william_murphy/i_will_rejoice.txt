[Verse 1:]
There is a river whose streams make glad the city of our God.
There is a river whose streams make glad the city of our God.
So I will rejoice,I will rejoice, and be glad.
My depressed days are over, I will, I made up my mind, I will, I'm gonna be glad.

[Verse 2:]
There is a fountain full of grace that flows from Emmanuel's veins.
There is a fountain so full of grace that flows from my Savior's veins.
It came and it healed me
It came and refreshed me
It came and washed my sins away!

[Chorus:]
So I will rejoice, I will rejoice,and be glad.
I will rejoice, I will rejoice, and be glad.

[Repeat Chorus 2 times]

[Back to Verse 2:]
There is a fountain full of grace that flows from Emmanuel's veins.
Has anybody been cleansed in the fountain, that flows from Emmanuel's veins.
See I know for myself cause it came, and it healed me, it came and refreshed my soul, it came and washed my sins away

[Chorus]

Rejoice in the Lord always and again I say
