[Chorus:]
God has been so good to me
I praise Him [2x]

[Verse 1:]
Great is the Lord, greatly to be praised
He's great [4x]

I just stopped by here to tell you
Our God is good

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Oh clap your hands, everybody shout
He is the Lord, the God that brought you out [3x]

I just stopped by here to tell you
Our God is good

[Bridge:]
Magnificent and glorious
Magnificent and glorious
He's been good
Just lift your hands and praise Him
Just lift your hands and praise Him
Just lift your hands and praise Him
Like you know you should

I just stopped by here to tell you
Our God is good [3x]
