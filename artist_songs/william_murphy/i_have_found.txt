I have found a peace, the plows on through the storm
I have found a joy, that jumps over sadness (jumps over sadness)
I have found a love, that lights up every room (lights up every room)
I have found, I've found You

I have found a trust, that teaches how to rest
I have found a grace, that guides me by the hand
I have found a strength, that stands like a mountain
I have found, I've found you

[x2]
You are all I want, you are all I need
Everything my heart could hope for
We are longing for the glory of the Lord
Cause we know there's so much more

Only you, fill my soul [x2]

[x2]
You are all I want, you are all I need
Everything my heart could hope for
We are longing for the glory of the Lord
Cause we know there's so much more

Only you, fill my soul [x2]

You are all I want, you are all I need
Everything my heart could hope for
We are longing for the glory of the Lord
Cause we know there's so much more

Only you, fill my soul 

Only you, Only you
Nobody but you
Only You, Only You
Nobody but you
