Can you raise your hands in His presence tonight and just worship Him in this place? The bible says that the angels cry out holy, one cries holy to the other. Somebody just, I need somebody on one side to cry out holy to the other side. Somebody throw a holy back to the other side.

The reason they cry out holy one to another, cause the bible when they cheribim, when they face one another, the bible says that they create a mercy seat, a place where God can sit and dwell amongst his people. Somebody cry out, "holy". Somebody throw a holy in the atmosphere. Somebody create a place where we can hear from God. Holy. Somebody cry out, holy. Holy Lord. Holy Lord.

God says, "If you create a mercy seat, I'm going to come down and I'm gonna meet with you, I'm gonna speak with you from, from above the mercy seat." Anybody wanna hear from God. Holy Lord. Come on every voice in the room. Holy Lord. Raise it up. Holy Lord. Come on, everybody. Holy Lord. Holy Lord. Holy Lord. Holy Lord.

We join in with the elders, and the living creatures and cry, "Holy." We cry, "Holy."

You are worthy. You are worthy. That's why we cry, "Holy." That's why we cry, "Holy."

That's why we lift our voices up and we cry, "Consume us up in your presence, Lord." Cause you are welcome, you are welcome.

Just like the deer panted for the water, I want you. Just like the deer panted for the water, tonight we want you. Just like the deer panted for the water, we want you. Just like the deer panted for the water, we want you, thirsty and hungry we want you.

We want you.
