You trying to tell me something (I'll never be the same). Y'all get my grandaddy up these steps here (not after being with you). I'm changing (changing). Oh, I'm changing Lord. I won't ever be the same. Oh no no no no no. You done something to me (not after being with you). You do something to me. Oh, Lord yeah (I'll never be the same). You fix me up (after being with you), you turned me around. Oh, you planted my feet on higher ground.

I won't ever be the same. Just can't be the same. Just can't be the same.

God all in my head (yes he did), all in my faith. Put a running in my feet. You put clapping in my hand. I won't ever. I just won't ever be the same (not after being with you). I'm changin.

Grandaddy I know you up in age but guess what, you're changing. Yes I'm changin. Every day you're changing. Something got a hold on me, yeah. He got a hold on me. Got a hold on me. He got a hold of me. He got a hold of me. He got a hold of me.
