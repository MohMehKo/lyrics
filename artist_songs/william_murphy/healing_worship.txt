[Verse:]
Got a story to tell you about some things that I've been through but I'm healed oh I'm healed had some ups and some downs leveled to the ground but I'm healed oh I'm healed had to wrestle all night long wondering what went wrong but I'm healed oh I'm healed had some sunshine some rain heartache and some pain I'm healed oh I'm healed

[Chorus:]
My God has touched me delivered he set my soul free my heart is mended I'm hole again no chains are holding my got my liberty I am healed I am healed I'm healed today God touched me delivered he set my soul free my heart is mended I'm hole again no chains are holding me got my liberty I am healed I am healed I'm healed today

[Bridge:]
May have some scares I am healed circumstances I'm still healed disappointments I am healed [x2 then go to vamp]

[Vamp:]
Oh oh oh I am healed I am healed I am healed with his stripes I am healed oh oh oh I am healed I am healed I am healed with his stripes I am healed [back to bridge]
