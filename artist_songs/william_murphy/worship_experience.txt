When I come into Your presence
I can feel your anointing
Like an overflowing fountain, mmm
The flow of your power
Saturates my spirit
And breakthrough overflows my soul

Lord I worship You for Your righteousness
Lord I honor you for your holiness
Lord I entered in beyond the veil
To worship you and to commune with you

I need a worship experience
A connection with your Spirit
Empowered by Your presence, yes

Solo: Lord I worship You for Your righteousness
Lord I honor you for your holiness
Lord I entered in beyond the veil
To worship you and to commune with you

I need a worship experience
A connection with your Spirit
Empowered by Your presence, yes

Endow me with Your presence
Cover me Lord
