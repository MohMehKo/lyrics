Come on lets do this together church and tell him yeah
I will never be the same, Not after being with you
(somebody needs to make that confession of faith tonight)

I will never be the same, Not after being with you
Cause I'm changing, cause I'm changing
I came here sick...(somebody needs to say this tonight it just came up in my spirit...my family walks in the anointing of healing I want you to say this)

I came here sick, but when I leave I'll be healed
Cause I'm changing
I came here broke, but when I leave I'll be rich
Cause I'm changing
