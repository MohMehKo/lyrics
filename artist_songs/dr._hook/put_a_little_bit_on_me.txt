One a.m. and here I set
Two a.m. and you ain't home yet
I don't wanna think where you might be
Guess I'll go and get me stoned
Lord I feel so all alone
Oh and how I wish that you'd come home
And put a little bit on me

Put a little bit on me, sweet momma
Put a little bit on me
You put a little bit on everybody else
Everybody else you see
You put a little here, you put a little there
All I want is my rightful share
Hey momma, ain't you gonna wanna
Put a little bit on me

You used to call me Sweet Daddy Jelly-roll
I used to feel your mind and thrill your soul
And any time I needed you, you cure'd my misery
But those days have gone and passed us by
And all you do is lay around on your ass and cry
Baby if you don't wanna see me die
Put a little bit on me

Put a little bit on me sweet momma
Put a little bit on me
You put a little bit on everybody else
Everybody else you see
You put a little here, you put a little there
All I want is my rightful share
Hey Momma, ain't you gonna wanna
Put a little bit on me

Put a little bit on me, sweet momma
Put a little bit on me
Put a little bit on me, sweet momma
Put a little bit on me
Put a little bit on me, sweet momma
Put a little bit on me...
