On the way to the bottom I met an old friend of mine
He said "Buddy, I do believe this is the end of the line"
I said "The end of the line? Shoot, come on and have another round
And if we're headin' for the bottom we still got a long way down"

On the way to the bottom we make a lot of stops
And we'd meet a lot of fools bustin' their hopes on the way to the top
Pass me another bottle and turn down the lights
Forget about tomorrow, babe we're gonna rumble tonight
I'll wear my low heeled boots you'll wear your taffeta gown
And if we're heading for the bottom we'll go laughing all the way down

On the way to the bottom I met an ol' girl of mine
She said "Honey, I'm scared, won't you love me one more time?"
I said "One more time? Shoot, about a million more
We had a whole lotta loving and a whole lot more in store"

On the way to the bottom we make a lot of stops
And we'd meet a lot of fools bustin' their hopes on the way to the top
Pass me another bottle and turn down the lights
Forget about tomorrow, babe we're gonna rumble tonight
I'll wear my low heeled boots you'll wear your taffeta gown
And if we're heading for the bottom we'll go laughing all the way down
