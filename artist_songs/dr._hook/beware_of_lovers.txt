Beware of lovers, who close their eyes
They could be hiding a thousand lies
You never know who they fantasise
Beware of lovers who close their eyes

It might be a stranger, or your best friend
Her very first lover that she's holding again
Ask no questions and you'll get no lies
Beware of lovers, who close their eyes

Does she have to drink that glass of wine?
Does she play the part with a cloudy mind?
Is it really you that has her hypnotised?
Beware of lovers, who close their eyes

Play with fire, watch the flame
Two burnin' lovers, in a dangerous game
In the heat of passion, satisfaction sublime
They open to love you, and they close their eyes

Beware of lovers, who close their eyes
Beware of lovers, who close their eyes
Beware of lovers, who close their eyes
Beware of lovers, who close their eyes
Beware of lovers, who close their eyes
