Knowing she's there makes it possible to live
Knowing she's there giving all she's got to give
And when the road got long and the load got heavier
She'd whisper babe I'm in love with ya
And made it easier to bear knowing she's there

Knowing she's there when I reach out in my sleep
Knowing she's there to hold me when I'm weak
And when the nights got cold and the days got drearier
She'd whisper babe I'm right here with ya
And made it easier to bear knowing she's there

Why did it make me take the lady's love for granted
How could it live so deep in a woman and never notice a change
Why doesn't any love ever go the way you planned it
And why doesn't any woman ever stay the same

Now knowing she's there instead of being here with me
Just knowing she's there giving him what she gave me
And it ain't that I can't live without it
But every time I think about it

Something inside me screams
Something inside me burns
I feel something inside me tear
Knowing she's there

Knowing she's there
Knowing she's there
Knowing she's there
