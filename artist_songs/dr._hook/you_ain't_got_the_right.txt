You ain't got the right to tell me I'm not lonely
'Cause you don't understand what I've been through
She had every right to do the wrong that she done to me
And that don't make it easier to lose
And that don't make it easier to lose

I woke up Wednesday mornin' with the feelin' she was gone
I turned to face an empty place and I realised
That I didn't smell no coffee and all her pretty clothes was gone
I cried the first of the many tears you'll see me cryin' from now on

And you ain't got the right to tell me I'm not lonely
'Cause you don't understand what I've been through
She had every right to do the wrong that she done to me
And that don't make it easier to lose
And that don't make it easier to lose

I know her list of lovers was just as long as mine
But the sometime plan of a natural man is to settle down
But the one time ways of that woman done busted up my mind
Now she's out the door and she got one more on her list than I got on mine

And you ain't got the right to tell me I'm not lonely
'Cause you don't understand what I've been through
She had every right to do the wrong that she done to me
And that don't make it easier to lose
And that don't make it easier to lose

It's gonna be a long time 'fore I come this way again
I been dragged through school and I learned the rules and it seems to me
That a woman love to do you but she won't always do you nice
She had her turn, I guess I learned
You know she ain't gonna do me twice

And you still ain't got the right to tell me I'm not lonely
'Cause you don't understand what I've been through
She had every right to do the wrong that she done to me
And that don't make it easier to lose
And that don't make it easier to lose
