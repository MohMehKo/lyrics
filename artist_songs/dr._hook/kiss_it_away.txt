There's a shadow on the sun I see it risin'
Kiss it away, kiss it away
And there's a hurt down deep inside that I been hidin'
Kiss it away, kiss it away
Now the hard times we been through
Oh babe we'd never mind them
We'd just kiss 'em away, we'd just kiss 'em away
And now I'm lookin' for the good times I can't find them
Must have kissed them away, guess we kissed them away

I keep thinkin' the sun will shine once more
I'm never ready for the sudden rain
Don't tell me I'm wrong, 'cause I've been told
I'm so wet and cold
Come kiss away my pain

You keep hopin' things'll change and I keep tryin'
One of these days, maybe one of these days
But there's a coldness in the air like somethin' dyin'
Kiss it away, kiss it away
