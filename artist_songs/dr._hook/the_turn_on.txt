Women turn me on
Music turns me on
Tacos turn me on
Almost everything turns me on

I'm talkin' 'bout my sex drive
I've got a very healthy sex drive
I'm talkin' 'bout my sex drive
Ooh sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex drive

Teachers turn me on
Silk and satin turns me on
Night time turns me on
Almost everything turns me on

I'm talkin' 'bout my sex drive
I've got a very healthy sex drive
I'm talkin' 'bout my sex drive
Ooh sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex drive

I can't get enough of that sexy stuff
No, no I can't get enough of that sexy stuff
No, no I can't get enough of that sexy stuff
No, no, no, no

Elevators turn me on
And tunnels turn me on
Wine coolers turn me on
Almost everything turns me on

I'm talkin' 'bout my sex drive
I've got a very healthy sex drive
I'm talkin' 'bout my sex drive
Ooh sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex drive

Women turn me on
And music turns me on
A hot-dog turns me on
Almost everything turns me on

Except for snakes and skinned tomatoes
Sour milk and burnt potatoes
Spiders and tornadoes
And doing my laundry
Sex drive

Sex sex sex sex ooh my sex drive
Everybody's talkin' 'bout my sex drive
Sex sex sex talkin' 'bout my sex drive
Sex sex sex sex sex sex sex
