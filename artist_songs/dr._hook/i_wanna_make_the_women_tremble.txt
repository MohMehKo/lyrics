When I was a young boy, my grandpa said to me
Little boy wish upon a star tell me what you wanna be
Would you like to be a lawyer, would the money appeal to you
Grandpa wants to help you boy tell me what you want to do

I wanna make the women tremble
I wanna make the little girls moan
I wanna play guitar 'til the sun comes up
And make love all day long

I wanna make the women tremble
I wanna make the little girls moan
I wanna play guitar 'til the sun comes up
And make love all day long

Now I am a grown man, I like just what I do
I love the pretty women Lord, and the women love me to
Well I've got my special woman, and that woman loves me true
She understands my situation, she knows what I gotta do

I gotta make the women tremble
I gotta make the little girls moan
I gotta play guitar 'til the sun comes up
And make love all day long

I seen another woman and my body begins to ache
My knees begin to tremble and my hands begin to shake
Now that woman makes me tremble, the little girl she makes me moan
She plays with me 'til the sun comes up, and loves me all day long

I wanna make the women tremble
I wanna make the little girls moan
I wanna play guitar 'til the sun comes up
And make love all day long

I wanna make the women tremble
I wanna make the little girls moan
I wanna play guitar 'til the sun comes up
And make love all day long
