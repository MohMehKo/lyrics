She arrives in all her splendor
Every night at nine o'clock
And her chariot is the crosstown bus
That stops right down the block
Then the old piano minstrel
Plays her song as she walks in
And the Queen of the Silver Dollar's home again

She's the Queen of the Silver Dollar
And she rules this smoky kingdom
And her scepter is a wine glass
And this bar stool is her throne
And the jesters flock around her
And fight to win her favors
And see which one will take the Queen
Of the Silver Dollar home

Her royal gown is a satin dress
That's stained and slightly torn
And her sparklin' jewels are rhinestones
And her shoes are scuffed and worn
From the many roads she's traveled
And the wondrous sites she's seen
And I watch her and I pray
God save the Queen

The Queen of the Silver Dollar's
Not as haughty as she seems
She was once an ordinary girl
With ordinary dreams
But I found her and I won her
And I brought her into this world
Yes, I'm the man who made a Queen
Of a simple country girl

Now she's the Queen of the Silver Dollar
And she rules this smoky kingdom
And her scepter is a wine glass
And this bar stool is her throne
And the jesters flock around her
And fight to win her favors
And see which one will take the Queen
Of the Silver Dollar home
