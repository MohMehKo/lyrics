I was seventeen years old that day
I was trying to find a woman for my birthday
So I made up my mind, and I didn't waste no time
And I took my daddy's Caddy down the freeway

Had a pocketful of bait, it was gettin' kinda late
It was bumper next to bumper on the highway
Sittin' jammed up tight, looked over to my right
There was a hitchhikin' honey goin' my way

About four years older than me
Biggest dang woman that I ever did see
But that sure didn't seem to matter
She made me so crazy, that I threw my love at her
And I scored

When I saw that pretty thumb, I motioned her to come
And she smiled and looked at me a little sideways
I said "Come on jump inside, we'll take a little ride"
And she said "Awright little man, let's go to my place"

About four years older than me
Biggest dang woman that I ever did see
But that sure didn't seem to matter
She made me so crazy, that I threw my love at her
And I scored

But that was long ago, now there's lots of things I know
And there's been a lot of parties wasn't bad
I've learned a lot since then, but I still remember when
I got the best piece of cake I ever had

About four years older than me
Biggest dang woman that I ever did see
But that sure didn't seem to matter
She made me so crazy, that I threw my love at her
And I scored
