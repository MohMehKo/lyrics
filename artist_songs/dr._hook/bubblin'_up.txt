I used to be a prancer a one-eyed song and dancer
But eyes for true romance I didn't even try
I'd get 'em and forget 'em
But I never could stay with 'em
'Cause I thought my well of love had done run dry

But now it's bubblin' up
I feel it bubblin' up
And you can't hold down this true love
No matter what you do
Because it's bubblin' up
(you can hear it baby)
It's bubblin' up
And it'll soon be bubblin' over just for you
(Get that look off your face!)

I knew that when I met you
You love me and I let you
But I'd gladly bet you that it wouldn't last too long
But I had no way of knowing that this thing would keep on growin'
And now the feeling still is going strong

And yes it's bubblin' up
It's bubble ubblin' up
And you can't hold down this true love
No matter what you do
Because it's bubblin' up
(Surprise)
Bubble ubblin' up
And it'll soon be bubblin' over just for you
(This is unbelievable!)
