Baby let me drink from your well 'til your well runs dry
Baby let me drink from your well
Baby let me drink from your well 'til your well runs dry
Baby let me drink from your well

I wanna be down, down in the bottom of your heart
I wanna feel, feel, feel your love
I wanna sing, sing about the joy that you bring
When we kiss, kiss the night away

Baby let me drink from your well 'til your well runs dry
Baby let me drink from your well
Baby let me drink from your well 'til your well runs dry
Baby let me drink from your well

I wanna dream, dream about you, sweet thing that I see
I wanna long, long for your touch
I wanna hold, hold your pretty body next to mine
When we kiss, kiss the night away

Baby let me drink from your well 'til your well runs dry
Baby let me drink from your well
Baby let me drink from your well 'til your well runs dry
Baby let me drink from your well

I wanna dream, dream about you, sweet thing that I see
I wanna long, long for your touch
I wanna hold, hold your pretty body next to mine
When we kiss, kiss the night away

Baby let me drink from your well 'til your well runs dry
Baby let me drink from your well
Baby let me drink from your well 'til your well runs dry
Baby let me drink from your well

Baby let me drink from your well 'til your well runs dry
Baby let me drink from your well
