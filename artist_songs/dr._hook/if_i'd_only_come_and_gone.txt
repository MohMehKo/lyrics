If I'd only come and gone
The way I've always done with summer girls before
Shared one night with you and never reached for more
Then we wouldn't face this long and painful righting of the wrong
If I'd just come and gone

If I hadn't stayed so long
And merely parked my dusty boots outside your door
Tracked no footprints 'cross your polished hardwood floor
If I'd have left you in your doorway smilin' drowsily at the dawn
If I'd just come and gone

Then I'd be on a shinin' silver plane dippin' into Denver
Or a schooner blowin' down The Biscayne Bay
You'd be safely tucked away among the pleasure I'd remember
'Stead of lyin' here beside me fearin' restless thoughts inside me
That might awaken with the breakin' of each new day

If you'd only stopped to read
Cold hard words I carved on other bedroom walls
And heard the mornin' coffee truths I told 'em all
I'd still be on your lips like some unfinished half-remembered song
You'd never have loved me if I'd just come and gone

If I'd only come and gone
If I'd only come and gone
If I'd only come and gone
