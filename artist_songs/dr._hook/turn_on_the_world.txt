Turn on the world, give them a taste of how free your love can be
Turn on the world, you don't wanna waste all your warmth on me
You say you've got wings, teach them to fly
Teach them to love and not question why
Teach them to live and then just watch them die
As you turn on the world

Turn on the world, I'm just one man and that ain't enough for you
Turn on the world, you know you can girl, it won't be too tough for you
Reach for your star, ride the highway
Pick up the souls that wait to be saved
All you can give me you already gave
Now go turn on the world

But where my mind goes now, is no longer your concern
You're hearing new voices now
And I'm just a bridge to burn
You've got so many choices now
You don't know where to turn, turn, turn
Turn on the world

Turn on the world, live life to the hilt, march to your own sweet tune
Turn on the world, don't stop for the guilt 'cause it might ruin your afternoon
You say I should smile, stand and be strong
'Cause we had our time, and we sang our song
Don't worry about me babe just run along
And go turn on the world

Oh show them how real your love can be
Turn on the world
You don't wanna waste, don't wanna waste
Don't wanna waste an hour on me

You say you've got wings, teach them to fly
Teach them to love and not question why
Teach them to live and then just watch them die
As you turn on the world
