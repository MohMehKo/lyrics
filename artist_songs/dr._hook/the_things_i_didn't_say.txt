I didn't say, 'Don't do it babe' when she packed up to go
I didn't say, 'Come back here honey and try with me once more'
And when she asked me if I loved her, I just turned away
She's gone and now I'm hearing all the things I didn't say

I didn't say, 'I'm sorry babe, 'cause half the fault was mine'
I didn't say, 'We'll work it out, 'cause all we need is love and faith and time'
I said, 'If that's the way you want it, I won't stand in your way'
She's gone and now I'm hearing all the things I didn't say

I didn't take her in my arms and kiss away her tears
I didn't say, 'My life don't mean a thing if you ain't here'
I thought of all the many games I'd be free to play
But all I do is listen to the things I didn't say

I didn't say, 'Take off your coat, I'll make some coffee and a talk'
I didn't say, 'The motorway is such a long and lonely, endless walk'
I said, 'Goodbye, good luck and God bless you', then she walked away
And left me here to live with all the things I didn't say

And now I guess she'll never hear the things I didn't say
