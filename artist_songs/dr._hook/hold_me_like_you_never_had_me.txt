Lately when you love me it seems so cut and dried
And baby I get lonely when I'm laying' by your side
If you need a fantasy to keep you satisfied
Hold me like I'm someone else that you ain't never tried

Hold me like you never had me
Say you're still in love with me, make me feel brand new
Hold me like you never had me
Say you're still in love with me, like you used to do

Bodies grow familiar, no surprises anymore
Like an old late movie show you've seen it all before
It's a classic story the good ones never die
You just have to read between the lines

Hold me like you never had me
Say you're still in love with me, make me feel brand new
Hold me like you never had me
Say you're still in love with me, like you used to do

Hold me like you never had me
Say you're still in love with me, make me feel brand new
Hold me like you never had me
Say you're still in love with me, like you used to do
