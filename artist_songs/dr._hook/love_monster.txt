Eyes bright in the midnight moon
Teeth flash, a blinding grin
Lock up the boys, tie down the girls
Love monster's on the loose again

Hot dreams in the midnight hour
Girls in the window beg please come in
Body hard, muscles strain
Love monster's on the loose again

All his lovers remember his hands
Driving them crazy like a Superman
For some it was enough, for some his teeth
And some just quiver and faint at the memory

From New York City to Hollywood
From Tokyo to New Orleans
Jungle drums had beat it out
Love monster's on the loose again

All his lovers remember his hands
Driving them crazy like a Superman
For some it was enough, for some his teeth
And some just quiver and faint at the memory

From New York City to Hollywood

All his lovers remember his hands
Driving them crazy like a Superman
For some it was enough, for some his teeth
And some just quiver and faint at the memory

Some just quiver and faint at the memory
Some just quiver and faint at the memory
