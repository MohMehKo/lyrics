All the lonely nights, listenin' for the 'phone
All the lonely nights, spend them all alone
Some lonely night, you're gonna stumble on someone you can't forget
Some happy day, you're gonna look back on, the night that you first met

Lucky night, lucky night

Some lucky night, you're gonna find the love you want
Some lucky night, you're gonna sleep in lovin' arms
Some lucky night, The Earth is gonna move, the sparks are gonna fly
Your eyes'll flash like the stardust, in the warm summer sky

Lucky night, lucky night

Someday you're gonna wake up in the life that you dream of
Spend your nights all sweet and warm in the arms of the one you love
On your lucky night, you know the smoke will clear, you're heart is gonna pound
Lucky night, that magic night, you'll know that you have found

Your lucky night, lucky night

Someday you're gonna wake up in the life that you dream of
Spend your nights all sweet and warm in the arms of the one you love

Lucky night
Luck, luck, lucky night

Lucky night, lucky night
Luck, luck, lucky night
