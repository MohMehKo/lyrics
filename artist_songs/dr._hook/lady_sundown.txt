Lately sundown means a little more to me
Heartbeats rise as the sun slips through the trees
As the twilight burns the sky
I can't wait for the light to die
'Cause I know how good tonight is gonna be

Lady Sundown, you haunt me through the day
When we lay down you burn my nights away
I never meant to give so much
But your touch turned me around
And when the night falls, I fall too, Lady Sundown, Lady Sundown

Starlight shadows moving in a quiet room
You open to me like a desert flower to the moon
Then the darkness starts to flow
To a rhythm only lovers know
Lyin' in love 'til the mornin' comes too soon

Lady Sundown, you haunt me through the day
When we lay down you burn my nights away
I never meant to give so much
But your touch turned me around
And when the night falls, I fall too, Lady Sundown, ooh ohh

Lady Sundown, you haunt me through the day
When we lay down you burn my nights away
I never meant to give so much
But your touch turned me around
And when the night falls, I fall too, Lady Sundown

Lady Sundown, you haunt me through the day
When we lay down you burn my nights away

Lady Sundown, you haunt me through the day
When we lay down you burn my nights away

Lady Sundown, you haunt me through the day
When we lay down you burn
