Oh Jesse, why have you come
I thought you would be kind enough to let me cry alone
Just now as I've learned to live without your love
You walked back into my life again

Oh let it die, oh Jesse, please let it be
Do not come and take my pride from me
Have I not lost enough, is that why you came
Not again Jesse, I cannot bear the pain

I suppose you've come to play a game
Come to deal the cards in a game I cannot win
But no matter how they fall the hearts are always in your hand
And I am forced to fold once again

Oh let it die, oh Jesse, please let it be
Do not come and take my pride from me
Have I not lost enough, is that why you came
Not again Jesse, I cannot bear the pain

Oh let it die, oh Jesse, please let it be
Do not come and take my pride from me
Have I not lost enough, is that why you came
Not again Jesse, I cannot bear the pain
