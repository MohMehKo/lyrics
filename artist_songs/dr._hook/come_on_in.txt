I don't know where you come from
And I don't know where you been
If you're ever 'round my farm
Won'tcha come on in!

I don't know if you been wrong
Don't know if you been right
But if you're ever 'round my farm
Won'tcha stop the night

If you're a pretty little hippie
And you're a hitchin' down the road
And you wanna hang it up for the night

Look for the big green farm
With the red and yellow barn
Just over to the left or the right

Come a kickin' through the chickens
And ring my bell
And I'll be happy as hell...well!

I don't know where you slept last night
And I don't care what he said
If you're ever 'round my farm
You can share my bed

I don't know what you're smokin'
Or what you been learnin' in school
But if you're ever 'round my farm
You can ---- my mule!!!
