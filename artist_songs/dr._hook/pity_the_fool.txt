You've been stranglin' me, danglin' me, playing me on your string
Pulling me close, spinnin' me loose, I've been blind to what's happening
But now I see what you're doing to me, and what's been driving you
You needed to have the reins in your hands didn't you

So go on ahead use your beautiful face and collect your pretty boys
Bring 'em aboard by twos, pity the fool who falls in love with you
Do what you need be so pretty and cruel and collect those pretty boys
Bring 'em aboard by twos, bring 'em aboard by fours, pity the fool who falls in love with you

You've been flirtin' with love, murderin' love bending it just to see
Just how far you can push this thing 'til it all comes down on me
You've been playing with love, having your way with love 'til it finally breaks
Curious to see just how much one man can take

Go on ahead use your beautiful face and collect those pretty boys
Bring 'em aboard by twos, pity the fool who falls in love with you
Do what you need be so pretty and cruel and collect those pretty boys
Bring 'em aboard by twos, bring 'em aboard by fours, pity the fool who falls in love with you

So go on ahead use your beautiful face and collect your pretty boys
Bring 'em aboard by twos, pity the fool who falls in love with you
Do what you need be so pretty and cruel
