Like a little girl in a candy store
You give her some, she wants more
But all she gets is what she asks me for

'Cause I can't say no to her, I can't say no
And I just don't know, why I can't say no to her
I know it shows and I know she knows, but I can't say no

When she looks at me with her longing eyes
It tears me up, deep down inside
And what she wants will never be denied

'Cause I can't say no to her, I can't say no
And I just don't know, why I can't say no to her
I know it shows and I know she knows, but I can't say no

There were times I guess, when I did say yes
That I must confess, were not wise
But she gets to me, so easily
It thrills me when she's smilin', and it kills me when she cries

And I can't say no to her, I can't say no
And I just don't know, why I can't say no to her
I know it shows and I know she knows, but I can't say no to her

'Cause I can't say no to her, I can't say no
And I just don't know, why I can't say no to her
I know it shows and I know she knows, but I can't say no to her

I can't say no and I just don't know, why I can't say no to her
I know it shows and I know she knows, but I can't say no to her
