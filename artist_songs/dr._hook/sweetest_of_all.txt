Out of all of the nights I remember
Of all of the loves I recall
There are many that live in my memory
But you were the sweetest of all

Wasn't it sweetest of all, babe
Wasn't it sweetest of all
I wasn't you're first love
I wasn't your last
But wasn't it sweetest of all

Sometimes I still think about you
Sometimes I wish that you'd call
And sometimes I feel like 
You're lying here with me
And it's still the sweetest of all

So keep your goodbyes in your pocket
You ain't going nowhere at all
Your memory is staying here with me
'Cause you were the sweetest of all

Wasn't it sweetest of all, babe
Wasn't it sweetest of all
Of all of the lovers
You let lie beside you
Wasn't it sweetest of all

Wasn't it sweetest of all, babe
Wasn't it sweetest of all
Of all of the lovers
You let lie beside you
Wasn't it sweetest of all
