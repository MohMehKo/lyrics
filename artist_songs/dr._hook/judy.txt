The waitress with the orange hair keeps motionin' me to hurry up and leave
So I gulp my coffee - burn my mouth - grab up my coat and slippin' out
I smear a streak of mustard down my sleeve
And the guy behind the register takes my bread and shakes his head
And looks at me as though I've blown his mind
Hey, I just come here for some coffee…hope I'm not wastin' anybody's time

And Judy I'm slowly movin' back to you
And I wish that I could say I'll treat you better than I used to
It's just I'm learnin' lots of things I never knew back then
Judy I'm slowly movin' back again
Judy I'm slowly movin' back again

That blue eyed barracuda smiles and tells me she could use some brand new clothes
She grabs my leg and with a wink, asks if I want another drink
She's not the campfire girl you might suppose
But she's so busy tellin' me her troubles I don't think she's got time
For any kind of trouble small as mine
Hey, I just come in here for nothin'… hope I'm not wastin' anybody's time

And Judy I'm slowly movin' back to you
And I wish that I could say I'll treat you better than I used to
It's just I'm learnin' lots of things I never knew back then
Judy I'm slowly movin' back again
Judy I'm slowly movin' back again

Well I'm stopped here on the corner, when the red faced cop says move along your way
But my nose is cold and my toes are numb, I got no feeling in my thumb
I think I just might stop inside that church and maybe pray
But they pass the plate and they look at me when it turns out that I ain't got a dime
Hey, I just come in here to talk to GOD… hope I'm not wastin' anybody's time

And Judy I'm slowly movin' back to you
And I wish that I could say I'll treat you better than I used to
It's just I'm learnin' lots of things I never knew back then
Judy I'm slowly movin' back again
Judy I'm slowly movin' back again
