He stands tall in his handmade boots
Pretty little girls all around
Black was the shade of his nudie suit
And when he sang there was not a sound

From state line to Mobile he entertained the crowds
Everybody there knew his name
His climb had started but the road gets harder
When you're closing in on fame

Bright lights shine and the crowd goes wild
"The show won't start 'til y'all calm down"
One pretty little girl stands all alone
And when she cried there was not a sound

For just three days in New Orleans she never left his side
That girl became a woman with her very first man
But to her only lover she was just like all the others
'Til she stood there with that gun in her hand

A shot rang out and the crowd goes wild
A shot rang out and the crowd goes wild
The crowd goes wild
The crowd goes wild
The crowd goes wild
The crowd goes wild
