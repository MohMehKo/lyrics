Second Street and Broadway
Sittin' in a doorway
Head held in his hands
Looked to all the world
Like he was prayin'
Foot wrapped in old rag
Bottle in a brown bag
I saw him trying to stand
Then I heard the words that he was sayin'

He said...

Come on, Carrie
Carry me a little farther
Come on, Carrie
Carry me one more mile
I don't know where it's leadin' to
But I know I can make it if I lean on you
So come on, Carrie
Carry me a little
I carried you, now carry me a little
Come on, Carrie, carry me a little while

When he struggled to his feet
And staggered down the street
To the window of a five and dime
He stood and laughed a while at his reflection
And then I heard him shoutin'
Something 'bout a mountain
He could surely climb
If she was only there 
To point to right direction

But she ain't, no, but she ain't, no...

He said
Come on, Carrie
Carry me a little farther
Come on, Carrie
Carry me one more mile
I don't know where it's leadin' to
But I know I can make it if I lean on you
So come on, Carrie
Carry me a little
I carried you, now carry me a little
Come on, Carrie
Carry me a little while...
