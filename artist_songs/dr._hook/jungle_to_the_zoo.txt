The tiger, he looked out of his cage and smiled
He said come here boy, I want to talk to you a while
He said I once was running wild and free just the same as you
But it's one step from the jungle to the zoo

Its one step from the jungle to the zoo
You better watch out or they're gonna get you too
They'll clip your claws, cut your hair, make a pussy cat out of you
Its one step from the jungle to the zoo

He said son when you go running through the grass
You bet look out for all the hidden traps
They'll feed you sweets and goodies 'til you're too fat to move
Then its one step from the jungle to the zoo

Its one step from the jungle to the zoo
You better watch out or they're gonna get you too
They'll clip your claws, yank your fangs, make a pussy cat out of you
Its one step from the jungle to the zoo

Only one step from the jungle to the zoo
You better watch out or they're gonna get you too
They'll clip your claws, cut your hair, make a pussy cat out of you
Its one step from the jungle to the zoo

Only one step from the jungle to the zoo
You better watch out or they're gonna get you too
