They called Rosie a lady until she had the baby
Then they called Rosie crazy, but she don't care at all
She sits rockin' and singin' and crazy Rosie's grinin'
Won't say what she's thinkin' she just sits and rocks a doll

When it comes to ladies, Rosie was first class
Her eighteen years had been the very best
'Til she met that traveller, she called darling James
Papa said he weren't fit to speak Rosie's name
Papa called him Jesse James

The talk was darling James took his own life
And Rosie thought she'd have her darling's child
But papa made plans to hide Rosie's shame
Papa sent her away to save the family name
Yeah he gave the son of Jesse James

They called Rosie a lady until she had the baby
Then they called Rosie crazy, but she don't care at all
She sits rockin' and singin' and crazy Rosie's grinin'
Won't say what she's thinkin' she just sits and rocks a doll

They say sometimes a tear comes to Rosie's eye
Though she never has spoke since they took her child
For twenty years of silence papa was to blame
'Cause Rosie knows that papa took the life of darling James
Papa saved the family name

They called Rosie a lady until she had the baby
Then they called Rosie crazy, but she don't care at all
She sits rockin' and singin' and crazy Rosie's grinin'
Won't say what she's thinkin' she just sits and rocks a doll

They called Rosie a lady until she had the baby
Then they called Rosie crazy, but she don't care at all
She sits rockin' and singin' and crazy Rosie's grinin'
Won't say what she's thinkin' she just sits and rocks a doll

They called Rosie a lady until she had the baby
