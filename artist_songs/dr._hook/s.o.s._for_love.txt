Floating slowly out to sea, cast adrift and all alone
Haven't seen a lighthouse near to give me one ray of hope
And every ship that passes by never sees
I'm out here all alone waving helplessly

This is an S.O.S. for love
Can you get here fast enough
Please won't somebody save me
This is an S.O.S. tonight
And only love can save my life
Oh won't somebody save me

I can make it through the days, but it's hell out here at night
Saw an island yesterday, but it disappeared from sight
Ridin' out the storm, head above the waves
Just barely holding on, waiting to be saved

This is an S.O.S. for love
Can you get here fast enough
Please won't somebody save me
And hear my S.O.S. tonight
Only love can save my life
Oh won't somebody save me, save me

Ridin' out the storm, head above the waves
Just barely holding on, waiting to be saved

This is an S.O.S. for love
Can you get here fast enough
Please won't somebody save me, save me, save me
And hear my S.O.S. tonight
Only love can save my life
Oh won't somebody save me
