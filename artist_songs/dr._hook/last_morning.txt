This is the last mornin' that I wake up in this dirty city
Looking for the sunshine as the buildings block the skies
This is the last mornin' that I wash in rusty water
Tryin' to shave a face that I don't even recognise
Down the hallway rats are skitterin'
I can smell the garbage rottin'
Hear the children cryin' in an apartment down below
This is the last mornin', that I'm gonna have to listen to it
I'm going home, yeah
This is the last mornin', that I try to breath the heavy air
Fight the crowds, avoid the traffic, watch the world turn grey
This is the last mornin' that I drink my coffee standing up
Smile and speak to strangers who just turn and walk away
This is a tough cold city here
And I'll guess I'll never cut it here
And I'm so tired of tryin' to stand against it all alone
This is the last mornin', that I'm gonna have to fight it
I'm going home, yeah
This is the last mornin' that I wear these greasy overalls
Punch the clock and do just what I'm told to get along
And face the long evenin', layin' close beside my radio
Imaginin' the kisses of the girl that sings the song
Down below the subway's screaming
As I lay here halfway dreaming
Looking at the ceiling, wondering where, the dream went wrong (where, where)
This is the last mornin', that I'm gonna have to think about it
I'm going home
I'm going home
I'm going home
I'm going home
