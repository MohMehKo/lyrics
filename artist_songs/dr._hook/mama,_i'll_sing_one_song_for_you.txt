[spoken:]
Well I've sung my songs on dusty roads
and dirty city sidewalks
To them sweatin' hard eyed brakeman,
in the rail yards I rolled through
I've sung in blue wallpapered rooms
to girls I played at lovin'
Now Mama, I'm gonna sing one for you

[sung:]
Mama let me tell you that I've never lost the memory
of the tender things you told me, and the gentle things you'd do
And though I've grown away and other arms reach to hold me 
Mama, I'll Sing one Song for you

You say you'd like to have me here to help you through the winter,
But you say it with a wistful smile like you already knew
That's your boy's no good at stayin' still that's words that need sayin'
Mama, I'll sing one song for you

And tomorrow I'll be movin' out on them dusty country backroads
Some sweatin' hard eyed brakeman may hear a tune or two
And the girl in the blue wallpapered room she'll ask where I've been hidin'
And I'll tell 'em I stopped and sang one song for you

Mama let me tell you that I've never lost the memory
Of the tender things you told me, and the gentle things you do
And though I've grown away and other arms reach out to hold me... hold me...
Mama, I'll sing one song for you

Sing it for you..sing it for you
Sing it for you..sing it for you
Sing it for you..sing it for you
Sing it for you..sing it for you

Gotta' keep on sing for ya Mama, sing for you
Sing for you, woa now mama let me sing it for you
Sing it for you
