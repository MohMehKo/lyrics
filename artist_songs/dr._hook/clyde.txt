Clyde played electric bass
Played it with finesse and grace
Sat on the porch ain't got no shoes
Pickin' the bass and singin' the blues

Misery loves company
That ol' dog sings harmony
Tambourine tied to his tail
You can hear him howl, you can hear him wail

C'mon Clyde
Clyde played electric bass, Clyde played electric bass
Clyde played electric bass, electric bass
Electric bass
C'mon Clyde, C'mon Clyde

Pickin' the bass 'n' singin' the blues
Singin' the blues, singin' the blues, singin' the blues

Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Oh Yeah

Geordie girl she got the dollar
Down the road you can hear her holler
C'mon Clyde there's things that need doin'
Clyde keeps pickin' and singin' the blues

He don't care

Clyde played electric bass
Played it with finesse and grace
Sat on the porch ain't got no shoes
Pickin' the bass and singin' the blues

C'mon Clyde, c'mon Clyde, c'mon Clyde
C'mon Clyde, c'mon Clyde, c'mon Clyde
