Josie it's been a long hard day
Down the road to where it's at I must have lost my way
When I got there they said I was too late
Now you're the only one can get me straight

So won't you sing me a rainbow Josie roll me a song
Just tonight make it right 'cause it's been wrong for oh so long
There's lots of shades of darkness, Josie deep inside a man
So sing me a rainbow if you can

The train I went to meet had come and gone
Seems like I spend all my time gettin' off and gettin' on
I sold my mind and gave my dreams away
And tomorrow I'll start lookin' 'round for yesterday

But 'til then sing me a rainbow Josie roll me a song
Just tonight make it right 'cause it's been wrong for oh so long
There's lots of kinds of hunger Josie you don't understand
So sing me a rainbow if you can

If you can, if you can
Sing me a rainbow if you can
