You look like a woman, and you move like one, 
but your parents are still tellin' you that you're too young
It's causing you pain, baby don't you cry 'cause it won't be long
'Til we can stay together 'til the morning comes
And share each other's dream when you're eighteen

When you reach eighteen there won't be anything anyone can do
I'll help you erase every trace of the pain they put you through
But right now, they say you've gotta wait for love, and you know what they mean
But they've got to set you free when you're eighteen

You've been told that you can't see me, but we know that that's the one who you wanna keep
So we plan and we scheme, and I see you whenever you can slip outside
Just like two thieves in the night, they make us hide
We won't care where we're seen when you're eighteen

When you reach eighteen there won't be anything anyone can do
I'll help you erase every trace of the pain they put you through
But right now, they say you've gotta wait for love, and you know what they mean
But they've got to set you free when you're eighteen

When you reach eighteen there won't be anything anyone can do
When you reach eighteen there won't be anything anyone can do
