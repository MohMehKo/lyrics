Tell me where is she going now, have I frightened her today
I'm a man, understand we've got funny ways
I flex my muscles every evening, and put on my big black hat
I'm insecure but I know for sure she don't know where I'm at

I'm a lamb, yes I am in a coat of armour
I'm a lamb, yes I am and I could never harm her
I'm a lamb, yes I am in a coat of armour
I'm a lamb, yes I am and I could never harm her

Last night I almost told her what I was thinking of
Then I backed away, I couldn't say that I really was in love
Instead I hurt her feelings in my usual way
Then she shut the door just a second before I had the chance to say

Hey
I'm a lamb, yes I am in a coat of armour
I'm a lamb, yes I am and I could never harm her
I'm a lamb, yes I am in a coat of armour
I'm a lamb, yes I am and I could never harm her

If you see my baby tell her to take a look
I dropped my guard, it was hard now I'm an open book

I'm a lamb, yes I am in a coat of armour
I'm a lamb, yes I am and I could never harm her
I'm a lamb, yes I am in a coat of armour
I'm a lamb, yes I am and I could never harm her

I'm a lamb, yes I am in a coat of armour
I'm a lamb, yes I am and I could never harm her
I'm a lamb, yes I am in a coat of armour
I'm a lamb, yes I am and I could never harm her
