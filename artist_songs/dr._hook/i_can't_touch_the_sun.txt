I can't touch the clouds for you, I'll never reach the sun for you
I've never done the things that you need done for you
I've stretched as high as I can reach, I guess I'm not the one for you
'Cause I can't touch the clouds or reach the sun for you
No I can't reach the clouds or touch the sun

I can't turn back time for you, and make you sweet sixteen again
I can't turn your barren fields to green again
And I won't sit around and talk of how things might have been again
No I can't turn back time and make you young again
I can't turn back time and make you young

I hope you find somebody who can do the things I didn't do
And find the road I didn't find, and build a brighter world for you
I hope you find somebody old enough to reach and take a hold
And guide your ever changing mind, and free your ever risin' soul
But I can't, No I can't

I can't look inside your mind, and see the things you're hopin' for
And I can't help you chase the dream you're gropin' for
You say your arms are open wide, but Lord knows who they're open for
No I can't know your mind or chase your dreams with you
No I can't chase your dreams or know your mind

So say goodbye and don't look back, I've had some happy days with you
Sorry I can't be the one who stays with you
And when they ask about me, you can say I was the one with you
Who never touched the clouds or reached the sun with you
No I can't reach the clouds or touch the sun

I guess it's done, I can't touch the sun for you, ooh, ooh, ooh
I can't touch the sun, I can't no I can't, ooh, no, ooh, no
I can't touch the sun, no lord, no, hmm, hmm....
