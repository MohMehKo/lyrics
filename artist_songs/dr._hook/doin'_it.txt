I'm so tired in the morning
Don't wanna do my work
In the middle of the afternoon
My muscle starts to hurt

Later on in the evening
I know I'll be alright
Got to go out and do it
Four or five times a night

Gonna get it up (Got to get it up)
Just one more time

Say I ain't so pretty
Say I ain't so strong (that's right)
You say I ain't as big as some
But I bet I last as long

Girl put on them spiked heels
That rotten cotton dress
Let's go upstairs and do it
See who do it best
