To think that I'm the kind of guy
Whoever could have kept her
Would be taking too much credit on myself
And seeing us together you just knew that she'd look better with somebody else

And now she's gone, no-one's surprised least of all not me
I always knew that I was just a comfort in her time of need
Just a comfort, just a comfort in her time, I gave her comfort in her time of need
Gave her comfort, gave her comfort in her time, I gave her comfort in her time of need

You knew that we had plans for San Francisco in September
But I didn't see California in her eyes
And by the end of summer, someone made a better offer
You know, I'm not surprised

And now she's gone, no-one's surprised least of all not me
I always knew that I was just a comfort in her time of need
Just a comfort, just a comfort in her time, I gave her comfort in her time of need
Gave her comfort, gave her comfort in her time, I gave her comfort in her time of need

Just a quick goodbye
Nobody's crying, no nobody's crying
I always knew that I was just a comfort
In her time of need

And now she's gone, no-one's surprised least of all not me
I always knew that I was just a comfort in her time of need
Just a comfort, just a comfort in her time, I gave her comfort in her time of need
Gave her comfort, gave her comfort in her time, I gave her comfort in her time of need

And now she's gone, no-one's surprised least of all not me
I always knew that I was just a comfort in her time of need
Just a comfort, just a comfort in her time, I gave her comfort in her time of need
Gave her comfort, gave her comfort in her time, I gave her comfort in her time of need
