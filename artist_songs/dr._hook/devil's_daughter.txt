Her flaming eyes, cast an evil spell
Her burning lips are the gates to hell
Conceived out of fire
Her daddy named her Desire
Ain't no water, cool the fire of the Devil's daughter

Heaven help the fool who dares to believe her
She'll torture your mind 'til you're burnin' alive with fever

A black widow spider, looking for her prey
In smokey places, with passions play
She lays for a man
She leaves him with a fiery brand
Ain't no water, cool the fire of the Devil's daughter

Heaven help the fool who dares to believe her
She'll torture your mind 'til you're burnin' alive with fever

Hers forever if she gets control
She feeds your love to her hungry soul
She'll drain you she'll bleed you 'til she no longer needs you
Ain't no water, cool the fire of the Devil's daughter
