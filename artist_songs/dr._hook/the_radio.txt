Lately, I've been givin' everything I've got to feeling alone
Baby you got me livin' one of them hard luck songs on the radio
Oh and I know, if I change the station I'll get the same song
Hope it ain't on the top too long

'Cause I really couldn't take it but they kept on playin' it
It's too unhappy and too close to home
I don't want to hear it but the singer keeps singin' that song

I gave you my love, you denied it
Then I gave you my life, but you wouldn't stay
And I hope you will return it to me someday
I gave you my love, you denied it
Then I gave you my life but you threw it away
And I hope you will return it to me someday

Some days I just sit around and kind of dream and watch the rain
Or I'll pick up some ol' magazine of yours that I forgot to throw away
Then I'll sleep a little or walk the floor, I'll smoke a lot more than I did before
I'll call somebody I used to know, just to try to stay away from that radio

'Cause I really can't take it when they keep on playin' it
It's so unhappy and so close to home
I don't want to hear it but the singer keeps singin' that song

I gave you my love, you denied it
Then I gave you my life, but you wouldn't stay
And I hope you will return it to me someday
I gave you my love, you denied it
Then I gave you my life but you threw it away
And I hope you will return it to me someday

I gave you my love, you denied it
Then I gave you my life but you threw it away.....
