I don't want to see you cry
Your crying always changes my mind
And we know well
It's livin' hell
Pretending our love hasn't died
Though we tried

Before the tears, I'm leaving
Should've left a long time ago
'Cause it's clear we stopped believing anymore
And I'm so tired and empty
Since I found we've lost it all
And I'm leaving before the tears start to fall

Ooh I'm leaving before the tears start to fall

Sad to say
I'm on my way
And your heart will be breaking at dawn
I'll be gone

Before the tears, I'm leaving
Should've left a long time ago
'Cause it's clear we stopped believing anymore
And I'm so tired and empty
Since I found we've lost it all
And I'm leaving before the tears start to fall

Before the tears, I'm leaving
Should've left a long time ago
'Cause it's clear we stopped believing anymore
And I'm so tired and empty
Since I found we've lost it all
And I'm leaving before the tears start to fall
