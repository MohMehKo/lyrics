I know when I'm hungry, I know the taste I like
I know how much it takes to satisfy my appetite
I know when I've had enough or when I still need more
I don't need no-one to tell me what I'm hungry for

Just my animal instinct, way that I feel
Animal instinct, got to be real
Animal hunger, burning down below
Animal instinct will show me where to go

If you're feeling hungry your big desires burn
You need some satisfaction but you don't know where to turn
Got to trust your instincts, instincts always right
You'll find what your hungry for out there in the night

Trust your animal instinct, way that you feel
Animal instinct, got to be real
Animal hunger, burning down below
Animal instinct will show you where to go

Animal instinct, way that you feel
Animal instinct, got to be real
Animal hunger, burning down below
Animal instinct

Animal instinct, burning down below
Animal hunger
Animal instinct, burning down below
Animal hunger

Animal hunger, burning down below
Animal instinct
Animal instinct, burning down below
Animal hunger

Animal hunger
