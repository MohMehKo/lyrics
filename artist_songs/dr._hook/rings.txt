Ring, ring, telephone ring, somebody's here, "Hey baby what'cha doing?" 
I've been wondering where you been, now and then I think about you and me
No need fightin' about things we can't recall, it don't matter now at all
No, come on home Honey baby, we'll laugh and sing, we'll make love and let the telephone ring

Ring, ring, doorbell ring, Baby come on in, I got sweet music on the stereo
I'm glad you came around, I've been feelin' down, talkin' to Tony and Mario
You know they make good conversation, still it ain't much consolation
'Cause I got love, Honey baby I'll give you some, if somebody comes we'll let the doorbell ring

Ring, ring, golden ring, around the sun, around your pretty finger
Ring, ring, voices ring, with a happy song, anybody can be a singer
The sun comes up across the city, I swear you've never looked so dog-gone pretty
Hand-in-hand upon the sand, with a preacher man, we'll let those wedding bells ring

Hand-in-hand upon the sand, with a preacher man, we'll let those wedding bells ring
Hand-in-hand upon the sand, with a preacher man, we'll let those wedding bells ring
Hand-in-hand upon the sand, with a preacher man, we'll let those wedding bells ring
Hand-in-hand upon the sand, with a preacher man, we'll let those wedding bells ring
