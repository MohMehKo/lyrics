Fiery Lady, silky sassy
Dark skin lassie, won't you lay me down
Be my soulful feel my empty
How you tempt me woman turn me round

She's a fire in the night
Blind you when the lights go down
She's a fire in the night
Get me up woman let me down

Hold me tightly, take it lightly
Don't try to fight me 'til you got me down
Cold and lonely, one night only
But it ain't lonely when the lights go down

She's a fire in the night
Blind you when the lights go down
She's a fire in the night
Get me up woman let me down

Acting crazy, feelin' lazy
Her eyes are hazy and her hair is down
Got the feelin', what you're dealin'
Surely healin' me I'm comin' round

She's a fire in the night
Blind you when the lights go down
She's a fire in the night
Get me up woman let me down

She's a fire in the night
Blind you when the lights go down
She's a fire in the night
Get me up woman let me down
