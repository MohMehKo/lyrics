They say that it's a man's world but girls make it go round
When you said your name it makes such a sexy sound
Stay up with me tonight honey I won't let you down
Come on let me love you now

I'm gonna do you right tonight
Turn on your light tonight
Lay right back and ease your mind
Honey I'm gonna take my time
I'm gonna do you right tonight

Hazel eyed lady, you've got the softest hands
You make me feel, I've got more than any man
And if you give the time honey, I'll love you more
Than anyone you've ever loved before

I'm gonna do you right tonight
Turn on your light tonight
Lay right back and ease your mind
Honey I'm gonna take my time
I'm gonna do you right tonight

I'm gonna do you right tonight
Turn on your light tonight
Lay right back and ease your mind
Honey I'm gonna take my time
I'm gonna do you right tonight

I'm gonna do you right tonight
Turn on your light tonight
Lay right back and ease your mind
Honey I'm gonna take my time
I'm gonna do you right tonight
