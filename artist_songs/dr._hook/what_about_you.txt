The days have been long, and I have been lonesome
Recallin' the dreams that never came true
The nights have been lonely, but now that's all over
'Cause I've paid my debt for trusting in you

Everyday your memory grows dimmer
Clouds drift away, sunshine peeps through
Every night no longer you haunt me
My conscience is clear, oh what about you?

It's hard to believe that you are the same one
That once meant so much and I loved so true
It's hard to know I worshipped the wrong one
But I've paid for it, oh what about you?

Everyday your memory grows dimmer
Clouds drift away, sunshine peeps through
Every night no longer you haunt me
My conscience is clear, now what about you?

Everyday your memory grows dimmer
Clouds drift away, sunshine peeps through...
