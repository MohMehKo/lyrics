I'd like to get to know you better
I'd like for you to know me too
Could I have your name and number?
I'd like to spend some time with you

Would you tell me where your job is?
I'd like to know what sign you are
Could I buy you a pina colada?
Could I walk you to your car?

Boy talk, boys talkin' in the same ol' way
Boy talk, girls hear it 'bout a hundred times a day

Could I come to your apartment?
Would you go to lunch with me?
Maybe we could see a movie
Maybe we could have some tea

Like to know where you got your brown eyes
Like to know if you make your clothes
Like to know what you look like naked
Oh oh oh oh

Boy talk, boys talkin' in the same ol' way
Boy talk, girls hear it 'bout a hundred times a day

Like to know where you got your brown eyes
Like to know if you make your clothes
Like to know what you look like naked
Oh oh oh oh

Boy talk, boys talkin' in the same ol' way
Boy talk, girls hear it 'bout a hundred times a day

It's all boy talk

I'd like to get to know you better.....naked

Could I come to your apartment.....naked

Maybe we could see a movie...ha ha ha...naked

Could I walk you to your car......naked

Like to know if you make your clothes......naked

Like to know what sign you are.....when you're naked

Ha ha ha 

It's all boy talk
