Oh it ain't alright if you do downs, do downs, do downs
It ain't alright if you do downs, all the live long day

'Cause you'd wanna sleep all night, you'd wanna sleep all day
But I bet my money on a bag of reds, somebody do downs today

Try not to die, try not to die
Try not to die, not to die, not today
