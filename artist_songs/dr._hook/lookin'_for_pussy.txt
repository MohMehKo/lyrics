You gotta start each day with a song

Lookin' for pussy, lookin' for pussy
Lookin' for pussy, lookin' for pussy

I just gotta see her and tell her I need her
Hurting without her, dreamin' about her
Wonderin' what she's gonna do
And who she's doin' it to

Lookin' for pussy, lookin' for pussy
Lookin' for pussy, lookin' for pussy

Tell her my story, say that I'm sorry
Just gotta find her say I'm behind her
In anything right or wrong
If she'll just take me along

Lookin' for pussy, take me along
Lookin' for pussy, c'mon take me along
Lookin' for pussy, c'mon take me along
Lookin' for pussy, Yeah lookin' for pussy

Lookin' for pussy....
