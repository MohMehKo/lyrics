Well I've been runnin' so long I'm ready to ride
I'm gettin' tired of the cold let me come inside
Life is bitchin' when you're hitchin' up a one way street
I've been hungry long enough now I'm ready to eat, eat and not be eaten

I've been hidin' in my closet but I'm comin' out
I kept quiet as a mouse but the cat's gonna shout
The show is just beginning better find you a seat
And give this man a real big hand when he stands on his own two feet

Because it's my time and it's high time
I got a new voice gonna sing a new song
Fly up into the sky time
I've been layin' too low too long, I've been layin' too low for so long

Because it's my time and it's high time
I got a new voice gonna sing a new song
Fly up into the sky time
I've been layin' too low too long, I've been layin' too low for so long

I was a jumpin' jack rabbit now I'm a teddy bear
I kicked all my dirty habits now I'm taking good care
I got my eyes pried open by the writing on the wall
Don' t look back Jack you're on the right track just relax and you can have it all

Now it's my time and it's high time
I got a new voice gonna sing a new song
Fly up into the sky time
I've been layin' too low too long, I've been layin' too low for so long
