Penicillin Penny she's the queen of the sunset strip
If she ever gives you any then you better see your doctor real quick
From the back seat of Cadillac cars, to the floor of men's room bars
She's Penicillin Penny and her future's written in the stars

She's Penicillin Penny and ever since the day she came and came
They say she's had so many, she gives 'em all numbers not names
I always call her Hun' but she calls me 1001
And Penicillin Penny starts to boogie when the day is done

She's Penicillin Penny and if you ever see her passin' through
Better run into your house before she stops and lays a little on you
If you ever let her in your door it takes 20 million units
Or more to cure the love that Penicillin Penny's gonna lay on you
