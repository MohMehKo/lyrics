If I could write a story, and end it like I want it to
I'd find me a genie, climb into his bottle
And let you rub me 'til your wish came true

I'll put angels around you, to keep you from harm
To light up the darkness, 'til you're safe in my arms
I'll put angels around you, a circle of three
Angels to lead you safely to me

There is no simple answer, and life it has it's own way
But if I know you loved me, I don't need a genie
And he can throw his bottle away

I'll put angels around you, to keep you from harm
To light up the darkness, 'til you're safe in my arms
I'll put angels around you, a circle of three
Angels to lead you safely to me

I'll put angels around you, to keep you from harm
To light up the darkness, 'til you're safe in my arms
I'll put angels around you, a circle of three
Angels to lead you safely to me
