Your clouds may be dark
You made your last move
And there's nothing left to do
You've tried your best
But your best is not enough
Your life has been rough
You feel an emptiness
Nothing satisfies
This is your time
It's not over
Come on home

Is your heart empty?
Come on home
Come let Him fill you
Come on home
Maybe you wandered far away
God is waiting with arms open wide
Come on home

Your friends are all gone
Surrounded with lies
And you're trying to fill your pain
With things and you've failed
You feel like you should end it now

But there is an answer
God's perfect plan
He will never let you down
So come as you are
It's not over
Come on home

Is your heart empty?
Come on home
Come let Him fill you
Come on home
Maybe you wandered far away
God is waiting with arms open wide
Come on home

He loves you
He knows
He cares for you
He wants you to know

He'll comfort
He heals
He'll satisfy you
He wants you to know

He loves you
Satisfies
He comforts
He wants you to know

Come on! (come home)
Come on! (come home)
Come on! (come home)
He's waiting for you

Maybe you wandered far away
God is waiting with arms open wide
Come on home
