Everywhere I go I look and see
There are children all around
Walking the hard streets of life
Do not keep a blind eye
Do not turn a deaf ear
They need our help and our love

What about our children
What about our future
If we made them good we make our future good
What about our children
What about our future
If we make them good we make the future good

Many are cold and hungry
Fighting hard to stay alive
They feel hopeless, rejected
No education or hope
No love no comfort
They need our help and our love

Every child is your child
Look out for one and help
We must love them too
God loves them so
We must all reach out
Reach out

What about children
What about the future
