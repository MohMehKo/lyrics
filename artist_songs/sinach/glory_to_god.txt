We sing unto God with the voice of triumph, [Twice]
We shout it out loud for our God who is able [Twice]
Blessings and glory and honour
Dominion and power be unto our God

[Chorus]
Glory to God, Glory to God
In the highest, In the highest
[2x]
Glory to God

Clap your hands and praise the Lord
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Shout Hallelujah
