God is for me 
Nothing can stand against me
God is for me 
I will not be moved 

I am a burning and shinning light 
The salt of the earth 
I am new man I'm glorified 
I'm an ambassador 

Everything about me is blessed 
The head not the tail
I'm the righteousness of God in Christ 
Sin has no power over me 

No weapon fashioned against me
Shall ever prosper 
I have a goodly heritage 
Great things are spoken of me 

God is for me 
Nothing can stand against me
God is for me 
I will not be moved 

Ah ah ah ah ah 
God is for me 

Complete in Him 
I belong to Jesus
