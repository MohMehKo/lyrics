We are perfect in You
We praise Your name
We are complete in You
We bless Your Name

For upon us is Your glory and Your grace
And upon us is Your beauty and Your life

From glory to glory
God is taking us
From glory to glory
God is taking us

Taking me higher
Higher, higher, higher
From glory to glory
