You are beautiful beyond all my dreams 
Words can't describe Your loveliness 
You are glorious in all of Your ways 
You make my life so beautiful 

Awesome God 
You are so good 
Awesome God
You are so good 

In You there's no darkness 
No disappointments 
You are so good 
In You there's no darkness 
No shadow of turning 
You are so good
