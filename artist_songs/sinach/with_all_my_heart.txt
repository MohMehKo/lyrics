We bring to You a sacrifice of praise
With fruit of our lips
Giving thanks unto your name

I worship You, with all my heart
With all my heart

I lift my hands, with all my heart
With all my heart

I love you Lord, with all my heart
With all my heart.

I give You praise, with all my heart
With all my heart
