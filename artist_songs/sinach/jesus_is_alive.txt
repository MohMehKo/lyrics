What a miracle it is
That Jesus is alive
Lifting holy hands to him
Am a witness that he lives
That same spirit
That raised him from the dead
That same spirit
Is alive in me forever

Jesus is alive
The tomb is empty hallelujah
Death could not hold him down
My heart is full
He lives in me

[Coda]
Death could not hold him down
Failure canâ€™t hold
Nothing can hold you down
Hallelujah
