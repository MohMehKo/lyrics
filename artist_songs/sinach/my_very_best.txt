I am before You singing
I am before You praising, Holy God
With all that is within me
With All my heart I worship, Holy God

I will not offer anything
That will not cost me any anything
I bring to you my sacrifice of praise
I will not offer anything
That will not cost me any anything
If it be praise or gift
It is coming from the very best of me

My very best Lord I give [X2]
My very best Lord
I give to You with all my heart
