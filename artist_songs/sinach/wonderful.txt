As I worship in Your presence
Pouring out my heart to You
I can feel your mighty power, gently move within my heart
I lift my hands in adoration, singing songs of praise to You
Hallelujah, almighty God

[Chorus:]
For You are wonderful, glorious and mighty God
Beautiful, there's none compared to Your majesty
We praise You, oh wonderful One
