From the rising of the sun, till it's going down
Your faithfullness is sure
Your mercies ever new
[x4]

No one knows
Like I know
What you've done for me
That's why I praise you the way I do
[x2]

Your favour surrounds me like a shield
Your love amazes me
Your grace has lifted me
[x4]

No one knows
Like I know
What you've done for me
That's why I praise you the way I do
[x2]

I sing
I dance
I shout for Joy
Lord I'm grateful
[x4]

No one knows
Like I know
What you've done for me
That's why I praise you the way I do
[x5]
