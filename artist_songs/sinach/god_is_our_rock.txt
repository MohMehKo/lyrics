Strength and power is our God
He is mighty in this place
He heals the broken heart
You can put your trust in him
The hand of God is on your life today
No devil can withhold the power of God

God is our rock
Blessed be his name
He’s the same yesterday today and forever
God is our rock
Blessed be his name
He’s the same yesterday today and forever
God is our rock

Don’t know what your asking God
But the power of God is here
He mends the broken heart
Peace to the troubled heart
The hand of God is on your life today
No devil can withhold the power of God

What he did yesterday
He’ll do much more today
What he did yesterday
He’ll do much more for you today
He cause the blind to see
And cause the lame to walk
What he did yesterday
He’ll do much more for you today
The walls are falling down
The chains have been broken
Lift up your hands whatever you require
