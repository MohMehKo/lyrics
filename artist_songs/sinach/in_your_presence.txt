I have found a resting place
Where my heart belongs called home
O Jesus where You are
Where You are
A shelter from the rain
An anchor to my soul
O Jesus where You are
I belong

In your presence
Thatâ€™s where I belong
All my mountains become small
As I see You as you are
In your presence where I belong [X2]
