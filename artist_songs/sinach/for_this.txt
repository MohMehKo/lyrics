You gave me to me great victories
Anointed me with unfailing love
Your help oh God has made me great

For this I praise Your name
For all that You have done
For this I praise Your name
With all my heart

You're the One who saved me from my foes
Set my table before them
You give strength to run the race

For this I praise Your name
For all that You have done
For this I praise Your name
With all my heart

You are my rock
You are my strength
You are my rock
I praise you again and again

My Rock,
My Strength, My Rock
I Praise you again and agan

For this I praise Your name
For all that You have done
For this I praise Your name
With all my heart
