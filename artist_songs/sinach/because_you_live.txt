You paid the price
The highest price
Am so grateful
For your love
You took my place
Now I stand
To be called your very own

Because you live
Jesus I live
I have no fear
Of what tomorrow brings
Because you live
Jesus I live today
I live to praise your name

I live to praise your name
I have no fear of what tomorrow brings
