You are the One
You give my life a meaning
Oh, oh, oh
You are my God
You are the One
The greater One in me
Oh, oh, oh
You are my God
You are the One

I worship You alone
Jesus, You are more than life to me
I honour You alone
Jesus, You are everything to me
Master, Saviour, Jesus
I love You more and more
Master, Saviour, Jesus
I love You more and more
