The man of war the Lord of host are You
Thy right hand oh God is glorious in power
You have dashed the enemy in pieces
Triumphed gloriously over death
You reign in majesty

Who is like unto thee oh Lord?
Among the gods who is like unto thee
Glorious in holiness
Fearful in praises doing wonders
Who is like unto thee?

There is no one like our God
None like Jehovah
