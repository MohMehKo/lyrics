You are next in line
For a miracle
This is your time
Arise and be blessed
You are next in line
For a miracle
This is your time

You may have gone everywhere
Searching for peace of mind
You may have gone everywhere you know (you know)
But hold on its not over yet
There's a miracle for you
You're next in line for a miracle today (oh oh oh)

(Say) You may have gone everywhere
Searching for peace and hope
The doctors may have given up 
But hold on God says
There's a miracle for you
You are next in line
For a miracle today
This is your time

I am next in line for a miracle 
This is my time
I arise cos I'm blessed
I am next in line for a miracle
This is my time

Guess my yesterday is not tomorrow
For right now, right now oh I'm next in line
Doesn't matter how far you go
Doesn't matter how deep the valley may be
Doesn't matter how big your dreams may be
You can receive yeah, oh
You're next in line for a miracle
Say that you are next in line
Line, line, line, yeah...

This is your time
You’re next in line, you’re next in line
This is your time
