Shout for He has given us the victory
Shout the praise of our God is in our midst
Shout for He has given the victory
We rejoice in His holy name

We are courageous full of passion
With love in our hearts
All things are possible

With faith in our hearts we praise
With the word in our mouth we make war

Victory in place in this place
Victory in my home
Victory in my job
Victory all over me, over me

I've got it [x3]

Say that I've got it
