Awesome God how great thou art
Magnificent God how great thou art
Mighty God how great thou art
Glorious God how great thou art
There is so much to thank You for
This is what I’ll do

[Chorus:]
I’ll sing
I’ll dance
I’ll give my praise to You
I’ll sing
I’ll dance
With all that is within me
I’ll sing
I’ll dance
Awesome God

[Ref]
Glorious God You are awesome
