You will never leave same way you came
For the power of the Lord is here to change
You will never leave same way you came
For the power of the Lord is here to change
You will never be the same.

The presence of the Lord is in this place [echo]
The power of the Lord is in this place [echo]
The anointing of the Lord is in this place [echo]
The glory of the Lord is in this place [echo]

I can feel His power over me
His anointing changing me
I can feel His power over me
His anointing changing me

My life will never be same
My life will never be the same
My life will never be the same
The presence of the Lord is in this place
