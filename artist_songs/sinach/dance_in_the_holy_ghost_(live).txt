Burning in my soul
He is the power
Working in my life
[x2]

Oh oh oh, burns like a fire
Oh oh oh, moving with power
Oh oh oh, He's taking me higher

We are bigger and better, in the Holy Ghost
See I am shining, in the Holy Ghost
And we're taking over, in the Holy Ghost

Moving with power, in the Holy Ghost
Set higher and higher, in the Holy Ghost
