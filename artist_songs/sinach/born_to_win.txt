You bled and died that I might live
Your body broken now am healed
Your blood was shed all for my righteousness
And now I walk in victory
Oh, oh and now I walk in victory

I was born to win
I was born to reign in Christ
I am not defeated
No matter what I see
I will always win
Whatever comes my way
I will always win
