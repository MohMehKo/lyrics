Grateful, so grateful for all that You have done
I am so grateful for all You have done [2x]

Jehovah You have been so good to me
Your favour and Your love lifted me on high
Jehovah You have been so good
And I cannot tell it all
With my whole heart, I give to You all praise

I give to You all praise
Oh Lord, I give You praise.
