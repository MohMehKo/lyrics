Spreading on every side,
The lord is with me,
There is no stopping me,
To the east, west, north and south,
I spread on every side,
The lord is with me,
There is no stopping me,
To the east, west, north and south,
I spread

Your word is working mightly in me,
Overtaking in all directions,
Grace and favour is working for me,
My increase cannot be stopped

Spreading on every side,
The lord is with me,
There is no stopping me,
To the east, west, north and south,
I spread on every side,
The lord is with me,
There is no stopping me,
To the east, west, north and south,
I spread

Your word is working mightly in me,
Overtaking in all directions,
Grace and favour is working for me,
My increase cannot be stopped

Spreading on every side,
The lord is with me,
There is no stopping me,
To the east, west, north and south,
I spread on every side,
The lord is with me,
There is no stopping me,
To the east, west, north and south,
I spread

The walls are fallen,
The gates are opened,
Limitations are gone,
Ahead, ahead we go

Spreading on every side,
The lord is with me,
There is no stopping me,
To the east, west, north and south,
I spread on every side,
The lord is with me,
There is no stopping me,
To the east, west, north and south,
I spread

I spread
