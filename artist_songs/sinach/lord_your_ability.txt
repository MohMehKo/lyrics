Lord Your ability,
Your ability is at work in me
Lord Your ability,
Your ability is at work in me

[Chorus]
Itâ€™s not by power or might
But by Your Spirit oh God
Its not by power or might
But by your spirit oh God

[Chorus]
I can do all things
Through Christ which strengthens me
I can do all things through Christ which strengthens me.
