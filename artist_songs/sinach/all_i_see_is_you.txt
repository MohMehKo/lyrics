All I see is You
As I worship and adore You
I yield myself to You
This is where I want to be
In Your presence oh God

As I listen for Your voice
You refresh my soul my spirit
I yield myself to You
This is where I want to be
In Your presence oh God

I loose myself soar on high like an eagle
As You carry me, with the wind of your spirit
I loose myself soar on high like an eagle
As You carry me with the wind of your spirit
You're in control [x2]
