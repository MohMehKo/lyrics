There is a miracle
In this place
There is a miracle
For everyone
You will never leave
Same way that you came,
There is a miracle in this place

[Chorus]
Trust and obey God by His Word,
huhuhuhu,

This mountain that you see today,
It is only temporary it can be changed.
He will come through for you,
If you believe

[Chorus]
Trust and obey God by his word,
huhuhuhu

These trials that you are facing,
They are only temporary,
They can be changed,
He will come through for you,
If you believe.

There is a miracle in this place,
There is a miracle,
There is a miracle
In this place.
