I have seen the blind eyes receive its sight
The deaf who heard, the dumb who spoke again
The lame who walked, impotent man made whole again
There is nothing impossible with God

It’s a miracle, when you walk with God
Supernatural when you walk with God
He’s a God of miracles
The same yesterday, today, forever
It’s a miracle when you walk with God

I have seen situation change through His word
Those who sowed in sorrow and in tears they will reap with joy
The barren made fruitful, the weeping eyes are dried again
Faith in His word will prevail
