[Solo]
The Word is a seed
When planted and watered
Grows to be great
You can be anything you want
You can achieve all your dreams
If you only believe
The Word of God is here today
Coming right at you
Would you believe it?
Dare to receive

[Chorus]
In this world where there are seasons and times
This is your season
Its time to shine again
In this world where there are seasons and times
This is your season
Its time to shine again

[Solo 2]
You may down
May be discouraged
It will come to pass
Be strong
Be encouraged
It’s only for a while
The Word of God is here today
Working inside of you
Would you believe it?
Dare to receive

[Chorus]
In a world where there’re seasons and times
This is your season
It’s time to shine again
In a world where there’re seasons and times
This is your season
It’s time to shine again

[Chorus 2]
I believe this is my season
It’s time to shine again
...

In this world where there are seasons and times
This is your season
Its time to shine again

[Chorus 3]
Shine again [3x]
