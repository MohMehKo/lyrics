I humbly bow before you
Knowing you are worthy
You’re greater than the greatest
Higher than the highest

Your majesty unfolding
Surrounded by Your mercy
You’re greater than the greatest
Higher than the highest

Lord you’re amazing
I cry out in worship
Lord You are wonderful
I cry out in worship
You are great
You are great
I stand in awe of you
[2x]

You are great
