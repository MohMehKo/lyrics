From the depths of my heart, I'm grateful to You
You've done so much for me
I have searched all around
There is no one like You
You mean so much to me,
You are my refuge and my strength
My ever present help in time of need

[Chorus:]
You are a wonder,
Creator of the earth
Highly exalted
I sing praises to Your name
Oh most high [2x]

I sing praises to Your name oh most high
