He’s never late
He’s not a late God
He’s never late
He’s not a late God
He’s never failed anyone I know
He is always on time
He’s never late
He’s not a late God

Remember Moses and the Israelites
Trapped between Pharaoh and the red sea
But right there in their trouble
God gave a Word
He was right there on time
To deliver them

Remember Meshach, Shedrach and Abadnego
Pushed into the fire because of their God
But right there in the fire
A fourth man appeared
He was right there on time
To deliver them

Never late
God is never late
Never late
Always on time
