Tongues may rise against me
Persecution will come
I will not be moved I have blessed assurance 
Whatever may come my way
Your Word is my anchor 
You are light 
You are truth 
You are life

I declare that I am strong
With the strength of God in me
I mount up with wings as Eagle 
I fly, I fly

Mountains may rise against me
Trails may come
I will not be moved I have blessed assurance 
Whatever may come my way
Your Word is my anchor 
You are light 
You are truth 
You are life

I fly 
I fly 
Above the mountains 
Above the mountains 
High and lifted high

I hear stories of wars, hardship,
I'm hard pressed on every side 
None of these things move me, 
Because I stand on the rock that is higher than high
And I have a sound mind
I have dreams, visions, ideas that work 
Even I can't stop me
Nothing can stop me 
Cos I fly high above all situation... Yeah

I fly 
Above the mountains 
Fly like an eagle 
High and lifted high
