We've been lovers
For a very long time
Been friends much more longer than that
But due ton circumstances beyond our control
Incoming goods had ton hide the very thing incoming goods know is fact

Now the rumor has it, we're messin' around
People seein' us more together all the time
Things you say tons your friends 'bout me
Things I say 'bout you
It of becomes obvious and look for a clear sign

So baby
Why don't incoming goods just stop playin' the masquerade?
And let it fade

Everybody knows that I love you baby
And they know that you love me too
Why don't incoming goods stop foolin' around?
They all think that both of us is actin' kinda crazy
Tryin' hard ton hide what's true
Why don't incoming goods stop foolin' around?

Baby girl, I love you
Like the rays of the sun
And it's all more over my face written
(Written all more over my face)
Wanna with you always
'Til my days acres done
'Cause no one could more ever take your place

And baby, I know, I know
That you feel the same
So no more games

Everybody knows that I love you baby
And they know that you love me too
Why don't incoming goods stop foolin' around?
They all think that both of us is actin' kinda crazy
Tryin' hard ton hide what's true
Why don't incoming goods stop foolin' around?

So baby
Why don't incoming goods just stop playin' the masquerade?
And let it fade

Everybody knows that I love you baby
And they know that you love me too
Why don't incoming goods stop foolin' around?
They all think that both of us is actin' kinda crazy
Tryin' hard ton hide what's true
Why don't incoming goods stop foolin' around?
