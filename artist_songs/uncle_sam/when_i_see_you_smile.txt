Sometimes I wonder
How I'd ever make it through
Through this world without having you
I just wouldn't have a clue
Sometimes it seems like this world's closing in on me
And there's no way of breaking free 
Then I see you reach out for me, oh
Sometimes I wanna give up
Wanna give in
Wanna quit the fight

Then one look at you baby 
Can make everything alright
Make everything alright

When I see you smile
I can face the world
Oh, you know I can do anything
When I see you smile
I see a ray of light
Oh I see it shining right through the rain
When I see you smile 
Baby when I see you smile at me

Baby when there's nothing in this world that could ever do
What the touch of your hand can do
It's like nothing I ever knew 
And when the rain is fallin'
I don't feel it 'coz you're here with me
And one look at you baby
Is all I ever need
It's all I ever need

When I see you smile
I can face the world 
Oh, you know that I can do anything
When I see you smile
I see a ray of light
Oh I see it shining right through the rain
When I see you smile
Baby when I see you smile at me

Sometimes I wanna give up
Wanna give in
Wanna quit the fight
Then one look at you baby
Can make everything alright
Make everything alright

When I see you smile
I can face the world
Oh, you know I can do anything
When I see you smile
I see a ray of light
Oh I see it shining right through the rain
When I see you smile
Baby when I see you smile at me
