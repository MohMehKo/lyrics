When you're all alone do you think about me?
Do you think about me?
'Cause I think about you all the time
How long do you think about me?
Do you think about me? Baby

Baby, baby, do you have a minute or 2 to spare?
'Cause I, I'm not the same when I'm by myself
Your face always seem to appear in my mind
All I wanna know is

When you're all alone do you think about me?
Do you think about me?
'Cause I think about you all the time
How long do you think about me?

Do you get my message?
Can you read between the lines?
Need to know just what the deal
It's the perfect situation
'Cause you and I have been cool for a while
And I've been diggin' your style

So do you wanna explore the chances
Of makin' it much more than just talkin' on the phone, baby?
See if our feelings of love enhances
If it's alright with you, tell me what you wanna do, baby?

When you're all alone do you think about me?

And I want to know if you think about me
