Just a few things you make me feel like
Tuesday nights, black lights, velvet pictures, movie in
Zodiac signs, street lights
Shine through the window, 50 candles in yellow

Got a lot, a lot of love for you, baby
Got a lot, a lot of love
I wanna put you up there now baby
Wanna place you up above

Ooh, you make me wanna stare at you, baby
Make me wanna look and see
'Cause I like the way you move your sexuality

Girl you make me feel like
Touching you
Girl you make me feel like
Holding you

Girl you make me feel like
Needing you
Girl you make me feel like
Making love to you

Baby, baby, won't you come to me, baby?
Baby, baby, come to me
'Cause I've got this feeling, darlin'
And it's really killing, see

If I take you in, will you come up?
I need to know right now
I wanna see if it's real now, baby
What's this thing all about?

Girl you make me feel like
Touching you
Girl you make me feel like
Holding you

Girl you make me feel like
Needing you
Girl you make me feel like
Making love to you

If I ask you, can I touch you there, baby
Does it feel good?
'Cause when you touch me
You make me feel like a real man should

Please be gentle, I'll be gentle
That's alright
'Cause I wanna do you, baby, all night

Girl you make me feel like
Touching you
Girl you make me feel like
Holding you

Girl you make me feel like
Needing you
Girl you make me feel like
Making love to you
