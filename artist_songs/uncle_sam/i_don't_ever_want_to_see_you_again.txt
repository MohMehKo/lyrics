Early one morning while you were asleep 
I received a letter, but there was no addressee 
So I paid it no mind, in fact, I wanted to send it back 
But something that I was feeling said open it 
It said "Dear Reader, once close friend of mine 
Hope that this letter finds you in time 
Cos your love is ending 
And my life's just beginning 
With a woman that I know you hold dear to you" 
And it made me wanna say 

I don't ever wanna see you again (I don't, I don't) 
But I stuck by you till the end 
And my conscience is clear 
And I can move on from here 
But I wish I could say the same for you baby 
(Yeah yeah yeah) 
I don't ever wanna see you again (no) 
Tell me why did it have to be my best friend 
(Why did it have to be) 
That you were messing round with 
I didn't wanna notice it 
I was true to my love for you-ou 

It took me a minute to wake up and see 
What the love of my life was doing to me 
I wanted to lay down and die 
Cos my pride wouldn't let me cry 
Some how I knew I had to get over it 
He said he couldn't understand until he felt your touch 
Now he can see why I love you so much 
And that's so unfair 
I never thought I'd have to share 
Your love that I thought was given to only me 
And that's why 

I don't ever wanna see you again (I don't wanna see) 
But I stuck by you till the end 
And my conscience is clear (clear) 
And I can move on from here 
But I wish I could say the same for you baby (ooh) 

I don't ever wanna see you again 
Tell me why did it have to be my best friend 
(You could of picked anybody) 
That you were messing round with 
I didn't wanna notice it 
I was true to my love for you 
(I was so true to my love for you) 

And you say you loved me 
(And you said you loved me baby) 
Love must of been blind 
Cos I sure didn't see this one coming 
I once was blind but now I see 
My best friend huh 
They say keep the ones you love close 
And your enemies even closer 
But I can't win or lose you 
(You are the closest thing to me baby) 
Cos the one I thought was a friend to me 
Ended up being my true enemy 
Do we know the real pain you go through 
Listen to me baby 
I gave you everything, my love and my ring 
And you, why you leading me 
And I don't wanna see you again 

I don't ever wanna see you again (I don't wanna see) 
But I stuck by you till the end 
And my conscience is clear (clear) 
And I can move on from here 
But I wish I could say the same for you baby (ooh) 
I don't ever wanna see you again 
Tell me why did it have to be my best friend 
(You could of picked anybody) 
That you were messing round with 
I didn't wanna notice it 
I was true to my love for you 
(I was so true to my love for you)
