I won't be bringing back my love
I won't be coming back
I won't be bringing back my love

[Chorus:]
Can't even fuck with you not another round, another round,
not another round, another round
'cause if I wasn't with you it was her and her and her and you and her and her
I heard it was you and her and her and her and all I want is to be done with you

[Chorus:]
Can't even fuck with you not another round, another round,

'cause if I wasn't with you it was her and her and her and you and her and her
I heard it was you and her and her and her and all I want is to be done with you

Gotta mean walk mean shoe game
and I'm bad than any other chick that you name whatchu want Jenneta or Rene

And I won't be coming back again I won't be coming back I won't be coming back again, I won't be coming back

Can't even fuck with you not another round, another round, not another round, another round
