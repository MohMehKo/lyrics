Sometimes .. 
I Just Need To Get Away,
I Just Wanna Get Away, 
To My Hide Away,
So Blue The Sky Where The Birds Are Free,
And If Your Feeling Me,
Come With Me,
Will Be In The Clouds Worry Free,

The Pressure Is High,
So Many Ways For Me To Trip And Fall Flat On My Face,
And I, I Wonder Why,
Is It So Easy For The Waves To Come Crash Down On Me,

Tell Me Whhyy,
Things Are So Tricky And Dangerous,
I Know Theres No Such Thing As A Perfect World,
But Does It Have To Be This Way,
Tell Me,
Sometimes I Just Wanna Get Away,

I Just Wanna Get Away, 
To My Hide Away,
So Blue The Sky Where The Birds Are Free,
And If Your Feeling Me,
Come With Me,
Will Be In The Clouds Worry Free,

I Just Wanna Get Away, 
To My Hide Away,
So Blue The Sky Where The Birds Are Free,
And If Your Feeling Me,
Come With Me,
Will Be In The Clouds Worry Free,

I Refuse To Let Things Get Me Down,
Cause I Know The Rain Is Not Gonna Stay Always,
(Its Gonna Go Away)
But I Cant Help The Fact That It Gets To Me,
And Seems That It Will Never Stop Pouring,
And I Don't Know What I'm Gonna Do,
Things Are So Tricky And Dangerous,
I Know There's No Such Thing As A Perfect World,
But Does It Have To Be This Way,
Telll Meee... 
Sometimes I Just Wanna Get Away,

I Just Wanna Get Away, 
To My Hide Away,

And If Your Feeling Me,
Come With Me,
Will Be In The Clouds Worry Free,

I Just Wanna Get Away, 
To My Hide Away,
So Blue The Sky Where The Birds Are Free,
And If Your Feeling Me,
Come With Me,
Will Be In The Clouds Worry Free,

I Just Wanna Get Away, 
To My Hide Away,
So Blue The Sky Where The Birds Are Free,
