[Flo Rida:]
Teairra we ain't gotta cause a scene, baby

[Teairra Mari:]
Don't make me make me
Cause a scene up in here
Don't make me make me
Cause a scene up in here
Don't make me make me
Cause a scene up in here
Don't make me make me
Cause a scene up in here
Don't make me make me
Make me make me
Make me make me
Cause a scene up in here, don't
I'm demanding all of my respect
I don't care who's bout to see me
Cause a scene up in here

[Verse 1:]
I see you out here with your homies clubbin
Champagne popped off and you bubblin
Sheek shoes, but you better tell em somethin
You better tell them that you're somebodies husband
I ain't with that foolishness
No that ain't what I need tonight
But if they keep their hands off you
Then everything will be alright

[Bridge:]
All hot up in here, cause I'm on that gasoline
You know I'll take my shoes off
And grab my vasoline... oh...

[Chorus:]
Don't make me make me
Cause a scene up in here
Don't make me make me
Cause a scene up in here
Don't make me make me
Cause a scene up in here
Don't make me make me
Cause a scene up in here
Don't make me make me
Make me make me
Make me make me
Cause a scene up in here, don't
I'm demanding all of my respect
I don't care who's bout to see me
Cause a scene up in here
No...

[Verse 2:]
Your ex girl wanna flirt?
Well she gon get herself hurt
Even though I got on a mini skirt
I still will put in work
Don't tell me calm down, cause I know somebody's doing wrong
It's gon' be trouble when
I find out just what's going on

[Bridge:]
All hot up in here, cause I'm on that gasoline
You know I'll take my shoes off
And grab my vasoline... oh...

[Chorus:]
Don't make me make me
Cause a scene up in here
Don't make me make me
Cause a scene up in here
Don't make me make me
Cause a scene up in here
Don't make me make me
Cause a scene up in here
Don't make me make me
Make me make me
Make me make me
Cause a scene up in here, don't
I'm demanding all of my respect
I don't care who's bout to see me
Cause a scene up in here

[Rap: Flo Rida]
Heyy sh-sh-Shawty We got the champagne poppin',
And weed for you to be poppin' off,
Throwing that attention, that'll fo sho will get cops involved,
Li-Listen to me baby, I can't help these chicks that you be rollin on
I know that you, you do me, at the end of the night - they go home, we get grown,
Un cut or cut, why even cause a scene?
Okok but when we do have make up sex,
I'm not dating maybelline,
Baby, I do got nuff respect,
If not bout these broads, I'm bout my cheese,
To the-Flo-Rida I, oh I do love my Teairra Mari,
Shit, shit mama let's be drama free, shawty you good,
Left the ghetto, move from the projects,
Damn, I thought I left the hood,
Well, then when I bought them stilletos,
To keep something on your foot,
To supply you, with lots of henny,
See, some bitches get wood,
I ain't did nothin I would never push your button,
Then she double, Ella Ella - no way I'm a would stay out of it,
Oh, today breakin up this subject,
We gotta take it out in public,
I, I know that you my wifey but my boo ain't got your back

[Teairra Mari:]
