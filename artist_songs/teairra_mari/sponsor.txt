I know you see the colors in the colors in my chain
Shorty see the diamonds in the diamonds on my ring

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Gucci
I can be da co pilot
You can do da drivin
You can be da star baby

No my name not gilligan
But let's go to an island
Love to make you smile
But id rather by ya diamonds
And if I'm far away from you the ring will be remindin
That nobody can do ya better do I treat ya kindly
And I ain't tryna flatter you but I think you the finest damn you gettin thick
I hope you don't go on a diet
I just bought you a dress cause tonight I will be blindin
Watch, chain, ring, earrings

Gucci Mane La'Flare
But baby you can call me icy
So tell me fi they hate on me
Cause I don't want him to like me

[Verse 2: Teairra Mari]
He put them low profiles on my car
He treats me to a pedi plus manicure
Anything I ask for from my sponsor he go and bu-bu-bu-buy buy
A baby blue madalion I just got
My feet they speak italian walk so hot
I tell him baby thanks alot
My sponsor he go and bu-bu-buy buy

[Hook:]
He ain't no square
He just likes to share
In love with a tip for throwin hundreds in the air
Throw some over here
And loui drop the loui drop the loui in my lap

[Chorus:]
Yeaaah (and all my ladies say)
Yeaaah (the go go girls say)
Yeaaah (hey hey)

Yeeaaah (to fill up a tank for me)
Yeeaaah (to put something in the bank for)

[Verse 3:]
Every weekend I see dominicans in the chair
She can bring out the featurs in my hair
Add a couple tracks for flare
My sponsor he go and bu-bu-buy buy
He must be a rapper, baller, doctor, dentist
Corner boy, cook chef, chemist
I don't even care
Just so long as he goes and bu-bu-buy buy

[Hook:]
He ain't no square
He just likes to share
In love with a tip for throwin hundreds in the air
Throw some over here
And loui drop the loui drop the loui in my lap

[Chorus:]
Yeaaah (and all my ladies say)
Yeaaah (the go go girls say)
Yeaaah (hey hey)
I got myself a sponsor
Yeeaaah (to fill up a drank for me)
Yeeaaah (to fill up a tank for me)
Yeeaaah (to put something in the bank for)

[Verse 4: Soulja Boy]
Baby girl like the way I tote the loui bag
Soulja boy tell em got a million dolla swagg
