I gave that boy my number
(Hey, Hey, Hey)
We've been something like lovers
(Hey, Hey, Hey)
But boy it's almost summer
(Hey, Hey, Hey)
Can't be tied down to another

[Chorus:]
I know you want my lovin'
I know you want my heart
[x3]
I know you want my lovin' now
This summer I will get back to you

Got support while on vacation
(Hey, Hey, Hey)
Me and my girls across the nation
(Hey, Hey, Hey)
I'm sorry but you gotta be patient
(Hey, Hey, Hey)
I can't do it with a boyfriend

[Chorus:]
I know you want my lovin'
I know you want my heart
[x3]
I know you want my lovin' now
This summer I will get back to you

I know this mess so crazy
(Hey, Hey, Hey)
Cause every woman wanna be with her baby
(Hey, Hey, Hey)
You need to catch up with me maybe
(Hey, Hey, Hey)
When the season starts to changin'

[Chorus:]
I know you want my lovin'
I know you want my heart
[x3]
I know you want my lovin' now
This summer I will get back to you

[Interlude:]
Get back to you
[x12]
Promise after summer I will get back to you
(Get back to you)

[Chorus:]
I know you want my lovin'
I know you want my heart
[x3]
I know you want my lovin' now
This summer I will get back to you

[Talking:]
You know, I don't mean to be mean, but baby just wait.
