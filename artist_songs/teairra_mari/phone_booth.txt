[Verse 1:]
Damn right now my life ain't filled wit nothing but the drama (drama)
Just had the worst fight ever with my mama (mama)
She believes that you've got two or three on the come up
Telling me you're loving me, but you're going home to them
Damn I hope she's wrong cause boy I love the ground you walk on (walk on)
She knows that your ties in the streets can be fatal (fatal)
She's threatening to disown me if I don't let this go
Lord can you help me before I blow
I'm so afraid

[Chorus:]
I'm at the phone booth
My mom just pissed me off
I can't take no more
Can you come and get me from the phone booth
She's telling me to break up
Cause you ain't gon' do nothing but hurt me
Come get me from the phone booth
It's raining, I'm crying
Damn I hope he ain't been lying to me
Come get me from the phone booth
My mom just pissed me off
I cant take no more
Can you come and get me

[Boy on phone:] Baby, baby are you alright? Why you crying man? Teairra?

[Verse 2:]
If I leave (If I leave)
Where will I go (will I go)
Will you take me in like you told me before (me before)
Prove that she was just being hysterical (hysterical)
Show that what she thinks ain't reality, no
I love her (I do)
Same time (I love you)
But you both are making me choose (See what I go through for you)
Boy you better hope the future that you're promising me
Is as real as the 45 up under your seat
Come on

[Chorus:]
I'm at the phone booth
My mom just pissed me off (Ay yay)
I can't take no more (No more)
Can you come and get me from the phone booth (Come pick me up)
She's telling me to break up (Ay)
Cause you ain't gon' do nothing but hurt me (Hurt me)
Come get me from the phone booth
It's raining, I'm crying (I'm all alone, come on)
Damn I hope he ain't been lying to me
Come get me from the phone booth
My mom just pissed me off (Pissed me off)
I cant take no more (Oh)
Can you come and get me

[Bridge:]
I've been through so much (Much)
I cant be
Done like that again
Hope you ain't been running (Running) game
And cause I'm so in need, oh (Damn I got me so in need)
I'm in love (Love)
That's gonna give me (Give me)
What every girl prays for each day (Someone who knows how to love)
Damn, I don't see your car
I hope that you're on the way, oh

[Chorus:]
I'm at the phone booth
My mom just pissed me off (Pissed me off)
I can't take no more
Can you come and get me from the phone booth (Oh can you come and get me now)
She's telling me to break up (Break up)
Cause you ain't gon' do nothing but hurt me (Hurt me)
Come get me from the phone booth (Oh)
It's raining, I'm crying
Damn I hope he ain't been lying to me
Come get me from the phone booth (Phone booth)
My mom just pissed me off
I cant take no more (Oh)
Can you come and get me

[Echoes:]
Phone booth
Can you come and get me from the phone booth
Come get me from the phone booth
Come get me from the phone booth
Can you come and get me
