[Verse 1:]
I bet you thought about me, thought that I was gone
Guaranteed 2 doubt me, thought that I was done
Wanna see me lose it, you wanna see me fail
See now, I'm a winner, and yes, I will prevail
All of you who told me, told me that I've changed
I tell you that I have, but I can't be the same
Seen so many places, livin out my dreams
No matter what you say, I'm still me

[Hook:]
Oh, they pushed my back against the wall
Did everything to make me fall
But I'm still up & runnin
U can't tell me I ain't built for this
So go ahead & close all the doors
Cause I'm a make it through them all
See I'm still up & runnin
U can't tell me I ain't built for this

[Verse 2:]
I heard them say there's no way I'd ever make it
They counted me out when they thought I was fadin
Tryna tell me that I wouldn't go far
And now they smile when they see me, see my face on the TV, yeah
Cause I gave it all I had, I had 2 take control
I'm not supportin cast, I got tha starring role
And here I stand alone, & I feel so free
No matter what I'm doin, I'm still me, oh

[B-Section:]
Still the same girl
In the same world that I'm livin in, wishin it was different
Sometimes I just can't believe (Can't believe that)
That this is really happenin 2 me

[Hook]

[Bridge:]
Won't let nobody break me down
Cause I done came too far 2 let them stop me now
Don't be scared 2 give your all (Lift your voice)
Even when it seems like you're alone, don't give up
U gotta keep pressin on, yeah

[Hook]
