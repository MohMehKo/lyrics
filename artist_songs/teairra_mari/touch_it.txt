Holler 
We make the boys wanna holler [repeats]

You talk bout the game but talk is cheap 
Let's get it popping boy 
i get lower in a Lamborghini 
See me ain't no stopping boy 
I hope that ain't your girlfriend 
That keeps on rolling eyes like that 
Like i wont jump over over this table 
help her straight and get her eyes right 
I ain't got a boyfriend 
I came all alone tonight 
Like kobe in the Fourth quarter 
Yeah I'm in my zone tonight 

[Chorus] 
I'm gonna pack it up 
You buy me a drink 
While I turn it up 
Tell me what you think 
It was all a tease 
But he must look like he sees 
Cause hes all up in my ear 
Tryna get me to his crib 
Cause I know he wanna touch it 
I know he wanna touch it 
Tryna run this game 
But he must have known my name 
That boy's been staring at me the whole night 
and I know he wanna touch it 
I know he wanna touch it 

I'll be popping 
I'll be locking 
know it was a sight to see 
I might even throw it back up on you 
If I like the beat 
I can see it in your eyes 
And the way you rubbing all up on my thighs.. 

I can ride it like Ciara 
but my name Ciara 
And I see a bad bitch when I look in the mirror 

[Chorus] 
I'm gonna pack it up 
You buy me a drink 
While I turn it up 
Tell me what you think 
It was all a tease 
But he must look like he sees 
Cause hes all up in my ear 
Tryna get me to his crib 
Cause I know he wanna touch it 
I know he wanna touch it 
Tryna run this game 
But he must have known my name 
That boy's been staring at me the whole night 
and I know he wanna touch it 
I know he wanna touch it 

All my ladies sayin 
If you know they wanna touch it [4x]

Talking and twisted 
When I'm out on the dance floor 
I am not the girl that you used to be happy for 
&Even though you love it 
You can never touch 
Go and see your prince 
Grab all the deals 

[Chorus] 
I'm gonna pack it up 
You buy me a drink 
While I turn it up 
Tell me what you think 
It was all a tease 
But he must look like he sees 
Cause hes all up in my ear 
Tryna get me to his crib 
Cause I know he wanna touch it 
I know he wanna touch it 
Tryna run this game 
But he must have known my name 
That boy's been staring at me the whole night 
and I know he wanna touch it 
I know he wanna touch it 

Holler 
We make the boys wanna holler [2x]
