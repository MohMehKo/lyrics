I don't want you to holla back no no no [x2]

[Verse 1:]
You say you been trying
Well I don't think tryings good enough
And I'm getting sick of your lying oh
You thought I wouldn't leave you
Go ahead and call my bluff

[Bridge:]
You ain't gotta lie to me no more (no more)
You ain't gotta pack your things
I already walked out the door
Ooh I'll holla
So you can keep all the things
That you thought would keep me here baby yeah
Ooh I'll holla
Boy pick up your face off the floor
Cause I don't want you no more

[Chorus:]
I don't want you to holla back holla back no no no
(Don't even waste your time baby)
I don't want you to holla back holla back no no no
I don't want you no more

[Verse 2:]
All them games you was playing
Had a girl going out her brain
Now I'm like what is you saying
When I look back I can't believe that I was so lame yeah
But I blame me for falling so far over you
Still I'm happy that I'm better than before

[Bridge:]
You ain't gotta lie to me no more
(Don't lie no more)
You ain't gotta pack your bags
I already walked out the door
Ooh I'll holla
So keep all the things
That you thought would keep me here baby
Ooh I'll holla
So go pick your face off the floor
Cause I don't want you no more

[Chorus:]
I don't want you to holla back holla back no no no
(I'll throw you the duces baby)
I don't want you to holla back holla back no no no
I don't want you no more

[Outro]
You didn't think I'd be leaving
The jokes on you now were even baby
All your lies and deceiving
Got you left you here so all alone
Boy don't call my phone

[Bridge:]
Ooh I'll holla so keep all the things
That you thought would keep me here baby
Ooh I'll holla so go pick your face off the floor
Cause I don't want you no more

[Chorus: x3]
I don't want you (baby) to holla back holla back no no no
(I don't want you so don't holla)
I don't want you to holla back holla back no no no
Cause I don't want you no more
I don't want you to holla back holla back no no no
No no no
I don't want you to holla back holla back no no no
Cause I don't you no more (no more)
Want you no more
