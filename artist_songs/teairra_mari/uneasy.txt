Uhhh; 
Can we turn thaa'beat up a lil bit 
Hit that, yeaaa 
Right there... 
Just a smidge tho 

[Verse 1]
Its not okay for you to go missing for days 
Call yer cellphone go straight to voicemail 
No fair, cause if I did it to you 
You'd prolly think I was out there wit another dude 

Okay, okay 
So what tha'sexx good? 
Bet I could find another I look good 
On me, on me, on me (on meee) yeaaa! 

[Chorus]
You make it so uneasy 
For me to love you baby (yeaa) 
You make it so uneasy 
For me to trust you baby (yeaaa) 
You make it so uneasy for me to love you baby yea 
You make it so uneasy for me to trust you baby 
Yeaaa 

[Bridge]
Cause you always lying, lying 
Why cant you ever keep it official (ficial) 
You never around me when I need you (need you) 
You make it uneasy for me, 
You make it uneasy uneasy for me 
[repeat]

[Verse 2]
Seven days later call back but guess what 
I'm boutta do you how you do me; don't answer 
Fix yo ass 
Sit yo ass down 
Learn a lesson bout love 
Cause its not enough to tell me 
Gotta show me whats up 

Okay, okay so what?

No prollem I look good 
On me, on me, on me, on meeeee! 

[Repeat (chorus & bridge)]

Ooooo to love you baby 
Ooooo, to trust you baby 
Ooooo, to need you baby
