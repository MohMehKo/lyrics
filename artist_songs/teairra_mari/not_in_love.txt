What the hell is this
Seems like the bullshit
And not consistent we're through boy
But... you can lie if you want to
That doesn't mean I got to believe it
Oh no
I ain't Nicole and Britney
I got to know you're with me
Don't need your money tricky
I got my own billy
Why do you lie to me
When we're together it's not you it's what you try to be
I know I gotta be
So right
And now say that you're tired of me
Wait wait wait let me catch my breath
Cause I'm looking out for myself
Nobody's perfect but this isn't working
It's not hard to see

That you're not in love with me
Oh no
Baby and that's okay
Two can play at this game
I'm not in love witchu no more
Ever since you've taken your heart away
We're not in love
No no
No we're not in love
Oh
No
No

You've been playing round
And it's too late now
For you to prove it to me
I wanted to see if we could be happy
And now I see who's fancy fancy
... you just passed it passed it
Cause I thought we were inseparable
But I was wrong
I don't know what the fuck we're doing doing
But I know Teairra is moving moving
To another scene
I gotta close this book
You thought you had me shook
But no
I told you that I couldn't stand the liars
So why boy
Would you leave me in the dark
And I try boy
To be faithful to you
Tell me what can I do
I was grateful for you
You're not in love

You're not in love with me
Oh no
Baby and that's okay
Two can play at this game
I'm not in love witchu no more
Ever since you've taken your heart away
We're not in love
We're not in love
We're not in
We're not in
We're not in

You don't see my
Now I want...
Oh baby
And now it's time for you to let it go
Cause I promised
It ain't working
You're not in love

You're not in love with me
Oh no
Baby and that's okay
Two can play at this game
I'm not in love witchu no more
Ever since you've taken your heart away
