You ain't gonna get my attention
Baby I wanna get yours instead
I really wanna be a definition
Of making love, I wanna put you to bed

Yoy don't have to knock, don't ring no bells
I'm a float my bottom up in the air
To get you hot, 'Cause I know you oh so well
And when you walking, baby you gonna hear

Is me say Daddy's home, Daddy's home for me
And I know you've been waiting for this love in your day
You know your daddy's home (daddy's home), and it's time to play (so it's time to play)
So you ain't got to give my loving away
So all my ladies say hey hey hey daddy
Hey hey hey daddy
Hey hey hey daddy
Hey hey hey daddy
