Gotta be honest I've been down this road before
And it's a real problem cause I know just where it's going
I don't wanna do this but I don't wanna lose him no
Caught up in this tug of war oh (oh oh oh oh)
Don't know where the lines got blur (oh oh oh oh)
Somewhere between love and hurt
We're everything we should be
Why can't I see that he's no good for me

Feels like love but inside I'm torn
It's a struggle cause I can't let go
My mind tries to warn me but my heart wouldn't hear it
Cause the truth has to travel too far
From my head to my heart

I never really notice everything you took from me
It's hard to be focus when this love is holding me
Tryna find a reason, I mean a really good reason why
I should fight to keep him in my life (oh oh oh oh)
Don't know where the lines got blur (oh oh oh oh)
Somewhere between love and hurt
We're everything we should be
Why can't I see that he's no good for me

Feels like love but inside I'm torn
It's a struggle cause I can't let go
My mind tries to warn me but my heart wouldn't hear it
Cause the truth has to travel too far
From my head to my heart

Everybody keeps telling me what's best
But it just goes in one ear out the other
And I'm still right where I've been
What is this thing you've got on me
That makes me stay when I should leave
Is this how it's gonna be

Feels like love but inside I'm torn
It's a struggle cause I can't let go
My mind tries to warn me but my heart wouldn't hear it
Cause the truth has to travel too far
From my head to my heart
(My head to my heart, my heart)
Cause the truth has to travel too far to my heart
