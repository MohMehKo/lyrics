Yeaa Teairra Mari
Don't be a stranger baby

[Chorus: singing]
I know you can't believe that I'm here right now
You've been wantin' this since last year
I can see that you're watchin' me
Baby I can't take it no more
What am I doin', What are you doin'
Oh yea that's right you're doin me, you're doin me
You're feelin' me right now babe
But wait until this loving is over
Til it's over, and it's far from over

[Rap:]
You know what I'm sippin'
So you know I ain't trippin'
How you bust off like a needle in da clippin'
Got my body drippin'
So you should get the strippin'
You can take my class
You ain't gotta pay tuition
Swerving on the road can't wait til I get you home
You too fly to being laying in that bed alone
I know it's ringing but you won't leave the telephone
Tell em gone
I'm a make you scream and moan
Pleasure Principle Janet Jackson on you n*****
Cock back bang baby I'm a pull the trigger
It's going down but we ain't sinking
It's the first round what da fuck you think
You had a couple hoes but I ain't worried
They was in the past now your memory is blurry
It's the first time you with the one you wanted
Want a 10 baby shes about a hundred

[Chorus: singing]
I know you can't believe that I'm here right now
You've been wantin' this since last year
I can see that you're watchin' me
Baby I can't take it no more
What am I doin', What are you doin'
Oh yea that's right you're doin me, you're doin me
You're feelin me right now babe
But wait until this loving is over
Til it's over, and it's far from over
