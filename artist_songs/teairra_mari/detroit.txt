I come from 8 mile you can never make it out is what they say
I didn't let no one tell me it could'ntbe done I knew one day
Water street is oh so cold no joy on joy road no they don't play (no no)
If you ever been around you know they get down 6 mile don't change (oh no)
No space for phoneys out here after the club is coney island meet me there
Got so much love for the hustlers yeah we all need customers what you holding
Wouldn't trade my life for no one everything I know I learned from where my hood is
If you don't know by now it's in Detroit motor city is where I come from
I'll be that woman that came from Detroit lions tigers pistons and motown even when
I'm in your town I'm reppin Detroit Detroit Detroit
