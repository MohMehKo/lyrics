[Phone Ringing]
[Teairra:]
Who is this... Hello... Yes Sharron... What?.. Not Erica... Oh my god, she is so wrong... I told her everything

[Verse 1:]
Told you bout the time he smiled at me and how wind made me roll inside
Told u how my throat when he spoke to me and how could you palpable straight in the eye

[Chorus:]
I don't know what I was thinking
Now I see I shoulda kept the info to myself
Cause the very first chance you had 
You dealt with him and now I'm left here feeling alone
We ain't friends no more
And there's no changing my mind (I'm not gonna change my mind this time)
All the trust is gone 
Now I want you out of my life (Get away from me oh...)

[Verse 2:]
I kno that this is just a silly crush 
But I thought that we were much than that
Girl Ur easy
Willin to give it up
But not me
Girl you kno I don't get down like that Oh...

[Chorus:]
I don't know what I was thinking
Now I See I shoulda kept the info to myself
Cause the very first chance you had 
You dealt with him and now I'm left here feeling alone...
We ain't friends no more (No No)
And there's no changing my mind (You can't make me change my mind)
All the trust is gone (It's gone away)
Now I want you out of my life (Get out of my life...)

[Breakdown:]
(Now a lot...) A lot of people tried to warn me
But I swear (I never understood)
(Now You Shown) Now you've shown your true colors 
And I can see you're up to no good...

[Chorus:]
We ain't friends no more
And there's no changing my mind (I'm not gonna change my mind)
All the trust is gone (sooo...)
Now I want you out of my life (Out my life oh...)
(We ain't) Why'd you have to do...
(Changing my mind) I'll never change my mind no...
All the trust is gone
Now I want you out of my life (Get away from me ohhh...)
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Yea Yea Get Away from me!
