[Verse 1:]
I'm looking for you,
That sweet, incredible you,
That unforgettable you
The you that only I can know
Tell me what I gotta do, what walls I gotta break through
That lead me right back to you oohh
Cause I'm searching boy but I don't have a clue

[Chorus:]
I'm not gonna stop fighting, I'ma keep searching
I'll go til the end of the world if I have to
I'm gonna keep trying, as long as I'm hurting
Tell me what I gotta do, cause boy I'm on the hunt for you
Where you at, Where you at, Where you at
Where you at, Where you at, Where you at
Cause boy I'm on the hunt for you
Where you at, Where you at, Where you at
Where you at, Where you at, Where you at

[Verse 2:]
I'm looking for you,
That irreplaceable you
That warm, embraceable you ohh,
That walked right out that door
What argument can I lose, when they can not play a fool?
Tell me boy what I gotta do oh baby
To figure out why you don't love me no more

[Chorus:]
I'm not gonna stop fighting, I'ma keep searching
I'll go til the end of the world if I have to
I'm gonna keep trying, as long as I'm hurting (I’ma keep trying baby)
Tell me what I gotta do, cause boy I'm on the hunt for you
Where you at, Where you at, Where you at
Where you at, Where you at
Cause boy I'm on the hunt for you
Where you at, Where you at, Where you at 
Where you at, Where you at

And we go back and forth
We’re cursing words like its tennis,

She calls me up whenever I leave,

I'm gonna keep trying, as long as I'm hurting

Cause boy I'm on the hunt for you
