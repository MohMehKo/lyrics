[Spoken:]
Uh, uh, yeah
Messin with the wrong nigga
Pauly paul, Teairra Mari
Messing wiht the wrong nigga

[Verse 1:]
Oh so you think that he loves you (Loves you)
So how come he only calls you (Calls you)
At 3 am in the morning (Morning)
Tipsy off hennesy (Girl he's just trying to beat it)

[Hook:]
And you be oh so happy (Happy ohh)
Telling me you're getting closer (Closer)
Soon as he gets just what he needs
He's pulling up his jeans
And he's right back in the streets
Not giving a damn about you

[Chorus:]
He don't really love you
You're messing with the wrong nigga
He just wants to crush 
You're messing with the wrong nigga
Get up on your gangsta girl, get up on your gangsta
And leave that nigga alone (You're messing with the wrong nigga)

[Verse 2:]
So now he's calling you wifey (How can you believe him)
When he's got so many more like you (I heard around the way)
You better put your ear to the streets girl
Do you even know where he lives (Probably got a girl and some kids)

[Hook:]
And you be oh so happy (Happy ohh)
Telling me you're getting closer (Closer)
Soon as he gets just what he needs
He's pulling up his jeans
And he's right back in the streets
He don't give a damn about you

[Chorus:]
He don't really love you
You're messing with the wrong nigga
He just wants to crush 
You're messing with the wrong nigga (He just wanna)
Get up on your gangsta girl, get up on your gangsta (Oh)
And leave that nigga alone (You're messing with the wrong nigga) (Leave him alone)

[Bridge:]
I don't see how you can trust him (I don't see how)
You need to leave him alone (You need to leave him)
What makes you think that he loves you (What makes you think)
You're better off on your own (You're better off on your own)

[Chorus:]
He don't really love you (Hey)
You're messing with the wrong nigga (Oh)
He just wants to crush 
You're messing with the wrong nigga (Yes he does, baby)
Get up on your gangsta girl, get up on your gangsta (Get up on your gangsta)
And leave that nigga alone (You're messing with the wrong nigga) (You're messing with the wrong nigga)

He don't really love you
You're messing with the wrong nigga (He don't, he don't)
He just wants to crush (All he wants to do is crush)
You're messing with the wrong nigga (He just wanna)
Get up on your gangsta girl, get up on your gangsta
And leave that nigga alone (You're messing with the wrong nigga)

He don't really love you
You're messing with the wrong nigga
He just wants to crush
You're messing with the wrong nigga
Get up on your gangsta girl, get up on your gangsta
And leave that nigga alone
