Yeah, ah ha, you know what it is
Everytime I do it, I do it big
Yeah, ah ha, you think that's stuntin?
You gotta get that __ dress back, stop frontin
I'm in my own world, and I'm getting everything
The way I want it [x4]

See a little swagger I ain't never gonna follow your trends, trends, trends
And If you think I'm talking bout you, if the shoe fits well, girlfriend
I do my own thing, do it my own way
And if these hoes want trouble, call my DJ
