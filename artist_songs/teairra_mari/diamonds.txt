Ay, Ay, Uh

[Kanye West:]
You love my diamonds don't cha
Let a way a nigga shine why don't you
Baby wats your disposition
Have you ever tried this position
Your my dream girl from the posters
That I thought I would never get close to
In the black limosines with choffers
Right next to the test-o-arosters
It's funny how all the jewelry just gets your cat so purry
And it look good altogether, They say they all forever
You love my diamonds don't cha
That I bought from all this rhymin'
But I know you'll never love me
You'll only love my diamonds

[Verse 1:]
You mess me up
On a hot summer night
I fall in love
With you multiple times
Got me wrapped around your finger
Boy I hope your love lingers
I do (I do), I do (do)
Your my one and only rock in the rough
I love to touch you, baby you lite me up
And ther ain't no way
I'll give you away
He's my d-d-diamond daddy
And I just got to have it

[Chorus:]
When I love baby
I'm gonna love ya, just like I love my diamonds
Diamonds, Diamonds
And When I wake up every night
(Boooooooy)
Will we be shining
Diamonds, Diamonds
I treasure you
Cherish you
Way you move my body
(Oooooooohhhh)
Cause people are together
Diamonds are forever
Ice blue baby
(Oooooooohhhh)
When I love you like my diamonds
Diamonds, Diamonds

[Verse 2:]
Like every girl
I'm into fabulous things
Like oyster pearls, and pretty diamond rings
But your my precious pessession
I rock you 24/7
I do (I do), I do (do)
All my acessories, yea I'll give em' up
I'd even trade them in for your love
And the ain't no way
I'm giving you away
Your my d-d-diamond daddy
And I just got to have you

[Chorus:]
When I love baby
I'm gonna love ya, just like your wer my diamonds
Diamonds (Diamonds), Diamonds (Diamonds)
And When I wake up every night
(Boooooooy)
Will we be shining
Diamonds (Diamonds), Diamonds (Diamonds)
I treasure you
Cherish you
Way you move my body
(Oooooooohhhh)
Cause people are together
Diamonds are forever
Ice blue baby
(Oooooooohhhh)
When I love you like my diamonds
Diamonds, Diamonds

[Bridge:]
You sexy, You Fine
I'm so glad your mine
You sexy, You fine
He's my one of a kind
You sexy, You fine
I'm so glad your mine
You sexy, You fine
He's my one of a kind

[Chorus: x2]
When I love baby
I'm gonna love ya, just like I love my diamonds
Diamonds, Diamonds
And When I wake up every night
(Boooooooy)
Will we be shining
Diamonds, Diamonds
I treasure you
Cherish you
Way you move my body
(Oooooooohhhh)
Cause people are together
Diamonds are forever
Ice blue baby
(Oooooooohhhh)
When I love you like my diamonds
Diamonds, Diamonds

(When I love you baby)
