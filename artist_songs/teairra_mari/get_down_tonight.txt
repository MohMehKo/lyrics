[Verse 1:]
I got the meanest urge to
Get in the club tonight
Call up my girls tell 'em drop what you're doing
Meet up and lets ride
And I ain't felt this way since that
Boy ended up inside
But tonight, I'mma make it happen
And I, do what feels right

[Hook:]
And I swear that its gon' feel so good
You know you should (Yeah)
Fix your hair, slip on your brand new shoes
You sure look good (Uh Huh)
All I know is that
Its gon' be on, I'll be gone
I don't care if you don't call
Cuz I'm doing me
Ladies

[Chorus:]
Oh!
If he made you sad
If he made you cry
Get up on your feet
Get down tonight
Get down tonight
Oh!
Baby don't feel bad (Yes)
Cuz its only right
That you get on your feet (Teairra Mari)
Get down tonight
Get down tonight

[Verse 2:]
And don't you worry 'bout tomorrow
Lets get out tonight
And tell the DJ play my song
I'm trynna catch a vibe
And if you don't mind boy, then I'm alright boy
I'mma be just fine, and I'mma get on down
I ain't thinking 'bout you no (Noo)

[Hook:]
And I swear that its gon' feel so good
You know you should (Yeah)
Fix your hair, slip on your brand new shoes
You sure look good (Uh huh)
All I know is that
Its gon' be on, I'll be gone
I don't care if you don't call
Cuz I'm doing me
