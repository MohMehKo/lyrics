You are like a habit and I know I gotta have it
Shoulda never ever ever let you go
Was the kind of situation that got my imagination running overtime I couldn't take no more no
But
Now that I know it's really over over
I just can't get it off my mind
That everything I had before I just let walk out the door
Now I want you back in my life
What what I'm gonna do cause with out you
Baby nothing matters anymore
What what I'm gonna do is find my way back to you
You
Not ready to let you go
(When you was with me)I never found myself afraid knew everything would be okay
What what I'm gonna do
Is find my way back to you you
What I'm gone do now is find my way back to you

Please tell me you don't hate me
And that you just couldn't shake me
But I know the chances really aren't that good
That's somebody so amazing could be still out there waiting for someone who let's you be so misunderstood

Please don't tell me it's really ova ova
I just can't get it off my mind
That everything I had before I just let walk out the door now I want it back in my life
What what I'm gonna do cause with out you
Baby nothing matters anymore
What what I'm gonna do is find my way back to you
You
Not ready to let you go
When you was with me I never found myself afraid knew everything would be okay
What what I'm gonna do
Is find my way back to you you
What I'm gone do now is find my way back to you

Damn
What what I'm gonna do
I fucked up this time
What what I'm gonna do cause with out you
Baby nothing matters anymore
What what I'm gonna do is find my way back to you you
Not ready to let you go
I never found myself afraid knew everything would be okay
What what I'm gonna do
Is find my way back to you you
What I'm gone do now is find my way back to you
