(Yeah, New Shit)

[Verse 1:]
I got plans for you and me
We both need to move on
Cuz you aint what i need
It took some time for me to find out
I didnt sign up for misery
And no we can't work it out
Things ain't the same way that they used to be
Cuz you don't feel for me no more

[Chorus:]
I got some new clothes, new kicks
I got a new crib, new whip
All your drama, I don't miss
I'm so over you boy
I'm on some new shit
I cant believe I was with you
All the pain that i went through
I sing a new song, new hit
I'm so over you boy
I'm on some new shit

[Verse 2:]
Now boy don't start blowing up my phone
I thought I told you to be gone (be gone)
Had the chance to make things right
But you kept doing me wrong
This aint a break up to make up game
I'mma do you how you did me
Cuz this is a new day, new change, new me
I'm moving on to some new shit

[Chorus:]
I got some new clothes, new kicks (new kicks)
I got a new crib, new whip (new whip)
All your drama, I don't miss
I'm so over you boy
I'm on some new shit
I cant believe I was with you
All the pain that i went through (All the pain i went through)
I sing a new song, new hit (new hit)
I'm so over you boy
I'm on some new shit

[Bridge:]
Now that I know he aint the one for me
(Now i know this, now i know this, now i know this, so tell would it)
Tell me would it make sense for me not to leave
You know I'm already going
I guess its time to move on

[Chorus:]
I got some new clothes, new kicks
I got a new crib, new whip
All your drama, I don't miss (I don't miss)
I'm so over you boy
I'm on some new shit (Boy i'm on some new shit)
I cant believe I was with you
All the pain that i went through
I sing a new song, new hit
I'm so over you boy
I'm on some new shit

Yeah yeah yeah yeah
(I'm on some new shit)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
(I'm on some new shit)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
(I'm on some new shit)
I'm so over you boy
I'm on some new shit
I'm so over you boy
I'm on some new shit
