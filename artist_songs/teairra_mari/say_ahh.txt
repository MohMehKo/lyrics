[Chorus: Teairra Mari]
Go girl like it's my birthday I walk by they looking thirsty and I say bye (bye, bye, bye, bye)
Go girl like it's my birthday I walk by they looking thirsty and I say bye (bye, bye, bye, bye)

[Chorus: Teairra Mari]
Go girl like it's my birthday I walk by they looking thirsty and I say bye (bye, bye, bye, bye)
Go girl like it's my birthday I walk by they looking thirsty and I say bye (bye, bye, bye, bye)
