[Intro:]
You know
I never understood why we go through the same things
Over and over
Baby 
I'm tired
I'm so damn tired

[Verse 1:]
You wake up in the morning
Breakfast on the table
Huh huh
Ain't it done
I go run you a bath
And turn on the cable
Boy don't act like you don't know it
You can be straight up with me boy
Ain't nobody listening
Tell me what are we doing
Cos I don't wanna waste my time
And I don't wanna waste your time
What the hell are we doing
I've given all I got
What do I have to show for it
Nothing nothing nothing nothing
I forgive you on the spot
Then I wait for you to change but
Nothing nothing nothing nothing

[Bridge:]
Got me going round and round and round in circles
Cos I loved you
Really loved you
Going round and round and round in circles
Cos I loved you
Really loved you

[Chorus:]
Round and round and round we go
Round and round and round we go
Round and round we go
Round and round we go
Round and round we go
Round and round ohh

[Verse 2:]
Tell me who you gonna find to do it like me
Huh huh ain't nobody
And I know you think I'm old
Well then boy I might be
Don't let that good girl shit fool ya
From the lingerie to the dirty dishes
Broken promises and wishes
Everyday is something different
Ain't no telling who you kissing
I've given all I got
What do I have to show for it
Nothing nothing nothing nothing
I forgive you on the spot
Then I wait for you to change but
Nothing nothing nothing nothing

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Thought that we could make it through the storm
The storm
But now I see that I was so so so wrong
Boy I would have never though
That we just wouldn't work
Boy it hurts
Oh baby
That we just keep going round in circles

[Bridge]

[Outro:]
I really really
I really
Really
I really really
We go
We go
We go
I can't even
Sometimes I'm feeling empty
Oh babe
So dizzy
Oh
I...
