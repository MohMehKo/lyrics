So you think it's okay
4 you 2 come home
3 in the fuckin morning
No bueno, no mas
You been a bad boy so my pussy's on strike
Your dinner's on the stove
I been waitin all night 4 ya
So you gotta learn your lesson

If you act up I'm a take it away
You can act dumb but you know I ain't playin
I'll put my snatch right back up in my goodie bag
Put my snatch right back up in my goodie bag
In my goodie bag [x4]
I'll put my snatch right back up in my goodie bag
Put my snatch right back up in my goodie bag

Your problem is, you're takin me for granted
I'm the baddest b**ch on the planet
But I'm here, stuck stupid on you
I shoulda cheated but I could'nthave done better
You the, you the best & that's why I put up with your shit
Next time you ain't gettin none of this, ohhhhh

If you act up I'm a take it away
You can act dumb but you know I ain't playin
I'll put my snatch right back up in my goodie bag
Put my snatch right back up in my goodie bag

In my goodie bag [x4]
I'll put my snatch right back up in my goodie bag
Put my snatch right back up in my goodie bag

Think you've got some serious making up to do
I know you see my number poppin up when I'm callin you
But you ignored it, I ain't for it, now I'm ignoring you
Give you the cold shoulder, once you roll over
I'm not featuring you
Oh oh oh oooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

If you act up I'm a take it away
You can act dumb but you know I ain't playin
I'll put my snatch right back up in my goodie bag
Put my snatch right back up in my goodie bag

If you act up I'm a take it away
You can act dumb but you know I ain't playin
I'll put my snatch right back up in my goodie bag
Put my snatch right back up in my goodie bag
In my goodie bag [x4]
I'll put my snatch right back up in my goodie bag
Put my snatch right back up in my goodie bag
