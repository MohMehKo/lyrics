[Verse 1]

As I lay here, just smokin' on a blunt
the situation is gettin blurier and blurier oh
See he don't understand, that a girl's gotta do what she's gotta do
When you're living in the hood, you're up to no good
That's how the story goes, but

[Chorus]

You can be my nigga and I can be your girl (you can be my nigga)
(But Imma do what I wanna do)
You can be my nigga and I can be your girl (you can be my nigga)
You can be my nigga and I can be your girl (you can be my nigga)
(But Imma do what I wanna do)
You can be my nigga and I can be your girl (you can be my nigga)

[Verse 2]

See I'm not tryna front, but, I gotta do what I gotta do
and still be down with you baby
So don't go gettin me wrong (cause I gotta thang for you baby)
and you can be my nigga anytime

[Chorus 2x]

Yo-Yo

So What I hang out with the homies all day
and just kick it, gettin' twisted what you want me in the kitchen?
Look you can't be controlin' my life, 
i'll be ya wife 
but honey let's get it right huh
Smokin Blunts on the regular
that's all that really counts
and sorry but, soap can't wash this mouth out
I'm the real ra-ra mama so just, deal with this drama
I can't put on a front actin' like you ol' punk

[Chorus]
[Says with Chorus]
You can be my nigga
Any ol' time of the day, yes you can
You can be
If you want to, choose to
Cause Imma do what I gotta do baby
Oh
