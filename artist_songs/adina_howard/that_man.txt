No man is perfect in this world but I feel he’s
The perfect man for this girl, yea
Said he loves me he feeds my soul when it's empty
He even puts his foot down when I try to cross the line, yea

[Chorus:]
That man (Picks me up when I’m down)
That man (I always want him around)
That man (It's obvious when he looks at me)
That man (He really loves me)

He may get jealous sometimes but I do too
You should see him my man is so fine
He’s always got the right words to say
He’s never let me down one day
And even if things got bad
He would stand up and be a man

[Chorus:]
That man (Picks me up when I’m down)
That man (I always want him around)
That man (It's obvious when he looks at me)
That man (He really loves me)

You’re my king
And I’m your queen
I’ll make sure that you know
My love will always grow

[Chorus:]
That man (Picks me up when I’m down)
That man (I always want him around)
That man (Its obvious when he looks at me)
That man (He really loves me)
