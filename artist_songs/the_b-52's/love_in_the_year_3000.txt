Robots, bootybots, erotobots

It would feel real different 
I might be a little bird come on
On your shoulders
I could give you a kiss
Tentative Tentacles are grabbing me
We're making space love in zero gravity
Take your time
Time has stopped 
Spiral on out to infinity 
Love in the year 3000 
It might be a different thing
Love in the year 3000
Love pulses on the solar wind so come on

You turn them on
They turn you on
You turn them on
They turn you on
You turn them on
They turn you on

Love in the year 3000 
A love pulse is coming
Lasers, quasars, love pulses on the solar wind so come on

Take off your helmet you spacey thing
In free fall we'll shimmer and shine
You got me spinning like Saturn's rings
It's a galactic love in future time

It will feel real different
You might be in future shock honey
So come on boy
Hey now give me a kiss

In the Spandex spiral vortex
In the Spandex spiral vortex
In the Spandex spiral vortex
We're in the Spandex spiral vortex
We're in the Spandex spiral vortex
We're in the Spandex spiral vortex
We're in the Spandex spiral vortex
We're in the Spandex spiral vortex
We're in the Spandex spiral vortex

Love in the year 3000 
A love pulse is coming
Lasers, quasars, love pulses on the solar wind so come on

You turn them on they turn you on
You turn them on

Love pulses come on
Lasers, quasars, love pulses on the solar wind so come on
So come on
So come on

Love in the year 3000
Love pulses come on

Come on
Come on
Come on
Come on
