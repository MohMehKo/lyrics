Spread your wild seed on fertile ground
Plug another feed to your crazy sound
Sky high hive you wind me tight
Sky high hive in the ultraviolet night

Well I'm gettin' nervous
My mind is zippin'
I'm gettin' so shaky
I might go road-trippin'
Velvet painting s on the street
Caught in the splendor
And I'm lovin' it
I'm lovin it

Hey Ultraviolet you bottled it right
Tell your skirt to take a hike
Keep doin' what you're doin'
'Cause you're doin' it right
Keep doin' what you're doin'
'Cause it's what I like

Four miles to a breakdown
Anybody wanna leave town
There's a rest stop
Let's hit the G-spot
Lovin' it - lovin' it

Four miles to a breakdown
Anybody wanna leave town
There's the G-spot
Pull the car over
Ultraviolet!

We're on the strato-cruise
To a strange latitude
Thinkin' about
All the things we'll do
Have you tried it?
Red hot riot
Have you tried it?
Ultraviolet

Liquid lover you bottled it right
Sky high hive you wind me tight
Keep doin' what you're doin'
'Cause it's what I like

Keep doin' what you're doin'
'Cause you're doin' it right
Keep doin' what you're doin'
'Cause it's what I like

Keep doin' what we're doin'
'Cause we're doin' it right
Keep doin' what we're doin'
It's what we like!
It's what we like!
Four miles to a breakdown
