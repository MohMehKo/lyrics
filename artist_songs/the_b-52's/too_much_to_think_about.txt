Flashes in the sky
Exploding like a nebula
Well it all seems so simple
And then it's pounding in your brain

Stokin' and stroking'
I'm hypnotized
We're in deep as the night
When bodies collide

I never felt this way before
And it feels so strange
Who knows where love goes
Who knows when it wraps around your brain

Too much to think about
Stokin' and a strokin'
Just too much to think about
Heat up the night
Just too much to think about tonight
Tonight when bodies collide

Too much to think about
Stokin' and a strokin'
Just too much to think about
Heat up the night
Just too much to think about tonight
Tonight when bodies collide

Lightning clash crash across your mind
So intense no sense but feeling fine
Movin' in closer
Ridin' the tide
We're in deep as the night when bodies collide

I never felt this way before
And it feels so strange
Who knows where love goes
Who knows when it wraps around your brain

Too much to think about
Stokin' and a strokin'
Just too much to think about
Heat up the night
Just too much to think about tonight
Tonight when bodies collide

Too much to think about
Stokin' and strokin'
Just too much to think about
Heat up the night
Just too much to think about tonight
Tonight when bodies collide

I can see so many crazy figures in my dreams
Oh my goodness
It's just too much to think about

Too much to think about
Just too much to think about
Just too much to think about
Stokin' and a strokin'
Just too much to think about
Heat up the night
Just too much to think about tonight
Tonight when bodies collide
