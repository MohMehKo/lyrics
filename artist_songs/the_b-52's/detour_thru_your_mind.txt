Your brain is an ever changing kaleidoscope of moods and colours 
We walk in the park but it's melting in the dark 
All of a sudden your mood changes and your face looks like a cake left out in the rain 
Is your name MacArthur Parker? Or is it Reba? 
Detour thru your mind. Supersaver to your mind 

We seem to float by yesterday's child. The new you. 
The land time forgot and a horse with no mane 
As we go further into the gloom, we chance upon a large orange room 
A key pops out of your nose. We open the door 
And all of a sudden we realise that we are no more 

From ear to ear. From here to now 
I hear another galaxy spinning around 
Who am I? Where am I going? How much will it cost? 

A flash of blinding light and we're in an elegantly appointed doctor's office 
It seems that Doctor Aron Butterfly wants to dip us in plaster and use us for bookends 
We say to the doctore, "No. Please. No!" 
And then we get the doctor's bill. What a shock! 
$16,000! And all he wanted to do was dip us in plaster! 

Detour thru your mind. Supersaver to your mind 

Who am I? 
Where have I been? 
Where am I going? 
DO I need any luggage? 

(Drug-free altered mindscapetalk) 

I need to leave my past behind 
I need to leave my behind in the past 

Backwards message: I buried my parakeet in the backyard.
Oh no, you're playing the record backwards.
Watch out, you might ruin your needle.
