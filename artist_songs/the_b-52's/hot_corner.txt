There goes 
The law screamin' by
3 AM and the minutes fly
No damn class 
In the Classic City
He's a mess 
But he's really pretty

I-I-I'm lookin' for some fun
Waitin' for the bus 
From Winder to come
I-I-I'm lookin' for my hon
Waitin' for that bus to come

Shake it to the last round 
(Hot corner, last call)
Shimmy in a Lurex gown 
Don't you know 
That I want you baby?

Hey y'all 
Last call
Last chance to dance
Do a white hot shimmy 
In a Lurex gown
Shimmy, shimmy 
Hot, shimmy, shimmy
Twist the tornado 
In the lasso
Shake it honey 
Shake 
Shake it honey

On the hot corner 
Steamin' it up
Shimmy, shimmy 
Hot 
Shimmy, shimmy
Tragically hot 
Show what you got
Shake it honey 
Shake, shake

Shake it to the last round 
(Hot corner, last call)
Shimmy in a Lurex gown 
Don't you know 
That I want you

Lookin for some action 
(Last call)
Twistin' to distraction 
(Last chance)
Shake it, shake it
Don't you know 
That I want you baby?

Hey y'all 
Last call
Last chance to dance 
Whoo

[2x:]
I-I-I'm lookin' for some fun
Waitin' for the bus 
From Winder to come
