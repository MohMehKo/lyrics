Crazy planet, no alignment
Rise above, hit the jet-stream
Rocky road, got my assignment
Rise above, ride my dreams

One on one, take a little bite
What I got, you never had
One on one, no use to fight
Love's my thing, so good it's bad
Love's my thing, so good it's bad
So good it's bad, so good it's bad

Let's go down to our secret place
So good it's bad so good it's bad
Let's go down to our secret place
You got my eyes wide open

Unexpected, undetected
You got my eyes wide open
Hiding from those prying eyes
You got my eyes wide open
Below the radar, in plain sight
You got my eyes wide open
Secret passage to your place tonight
You got my eyes wide open

I don't wanna clash
I don't want to rehash the past
I just want release
(I just want some peace)

Let's go down to our secret place
You got my eyes wide open
Let's go down to our secret place
You got my eyes wide open

Feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it
Oh yeah
Feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it
Oh yeah

Yeah you're so good
So good it's bad
What you got is what I want
One on one don't you fight
Pull it together ride it right

Love so good so good it's bad
What I got you never had
Get it together get it right
Get it together take a bite

Can you feel it? Unexpected
Can you feel it? Undetected
Livin' on the periphery

Can you feel it? Unexpected
Can you feel it? Undetected
Livin' on the periphery

Can you feel it? Words are bombs
Can you feel it? Words are missiles
Livin' on the periphery

Can you feel it? Undetected
Can you feel it? So unexpected
Living on the periphery

I don't wanna clash
I don't want to rehash the past
I just want release
I just want some peace

Let's go down to our secret place
You got my eyes wide open
