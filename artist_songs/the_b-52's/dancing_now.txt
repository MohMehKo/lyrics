Love is gone
But just for a while
It's full speed ahead 
Now I can smile
You twisted my heart
With your wicked plan
But I saw the signs
Before I, I melted in your hands

I finally broke through - dancin' now
Before I broke down - dancin' now
You messed around - dancin' now
I didn't fall for anything
I landed on my feet

Yeah you - thought I would crash
But I broke through
Dancing on the edge of the flames
Showing the burn ignoring the pain
(Dancin' dancin' dancin')
(Oooh edge of the flames)

I finally broke through - dancin' now
Before I broke down - dancin' now
You messed around - dancin' now
I didn't fall for anything
I landed on my feet

I finally broke through - dancin' now
Before I broke down
I was no fool - dancin' now - you messed around

Venus went away 
To a lonely outer star
Now she's back
And here we are
Now she's back and
Here we are

I finally broke through
Before you broke own
I was no fool
No you were a clown
I'm dancing on the edge
the edge of a flame
Showing no burn
And showing no pain
