[Prologue:]
You know, when you're up here and you're playing and having a good time and
looking down on you and all of your smiling faces, you try to do a good show,
but sometimes there's some shit going on inside that you guys are not privy to,
and that's what this song is about. It's called Voices in My Head

Thank you all for coming to my show
You've been great, but now I have to go.
Everyone had a super time I hope
Some songs tend to push the envelope

These are things that I have said,
but there are voices in my head,
and if you could here them,
this is what they'd say:

Thank you all for coming to my show
- Oh it hurts you bastards didn't laugh at my new nazi song and
You've been great, but now I have to go.
- Go and ask that girl in the front to come backstage and show her thong and
Everyone had a super time I hope
- I hope the guy who heckled me gets hit by a big bus, that fucker
Some songs tend to push the envelope
- Open up your eyes, your wife and girlfriend both showed up you sucker

There are voices in my head
- Oooooh, You're such a hack
Saying things that shouldn't be said
- You need Prozac
I just hope that they will
- No we won't
Go away

But wait there's more
Thank you all for coming to my show
- I have to take a piss
- God I hope there's cocaine left backstage
You've been great, but now I have to go.
- Why did I sign up for this?
- God I hope there's cocaine left backstage
You've all had a super time I hope
- Leave this song on the shelf
- I really really hope there's cocaine left backstage
Some songs tend to push the envelope
- I should just kill myself
- He is right you should kill yourself

There are voices in my head
- Oooooh, You're such a mess
Saying things that shouldn't be said
- You're talentless.
I just hope that they will
- No we won't
Go away
No they won't go away
- Never go away
- Never go away
They're here to stay.
- We're here to stay
- We're here to stay
They say I'm gay
- You're gay
- You're gay
Absolutely not I'm not gay
I say No Way
- You're gay
You're gay
- You're gay
Ok I'm Gay
- Bi-curious
