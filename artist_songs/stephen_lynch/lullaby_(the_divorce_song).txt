Hush little girl
Sweet baby dont cry, tonight
Daddy is here and he'll sing you a soft lullaby, tonight
Why cant it all be like it was before
How can I explain why mommy's not here anymore

Cause daddy likes porno and $10 whores
Daddy gets wasted and robs liquor stores
Daddy likes rubbing against little boys on the bus
I think thats why your mommy left us, mommy left us

Hush little girl
There is no reason to fret, tonight
Don't mind the smoke, daddy just wants to forget, tonight
Soon it will all be like it was before
Any minute, she will walk through that front door

But daddy plays poker and drinks lots of beer
Then he wants sex that involves mommy's rear
Daddy has sores on his naughty parts oozing with pus
I think thats why mommy left us

Please don't cry
I swear I'll try
To be here by your side

Right after daddy gets home from the bar
Visits his bookee
And steals a new car
He'll drive to the strip club
And if daddy plays his cards right
He'll bring home your new mommy tonight
