You got a unicorn, butterfly, angel wings, inner thigh
Queer tattoo, that's a queer tattoo
Flaming skull, smoking pot, that's the opposite of not a
Queer tattoo, it's a queer tattoo

You've got a tweety bird, you got a school mascot, got a hello kitty 
Tell you what you got, got a queer tattoo, such a queer tattoo
You think that symbol in Japanese, means strength or honor
Niger please it means queer tattoo, that's a queer tattoo

Any lower back tattoo is queer, it might as well say insert cock here
Whore tattoo, that's a whore tattoo
And that teardrop under your eye that you got in prison cause you killed a guy
That's a cool tattoo, sir that's a cool tattoo

You've got a comedy mask, got a tragedy mask, any fucking mask, 
Then you must have asked for a queer tattoo, give me your most queer tattoo
You're child's name with the words be strong, would be beautiful 
But they spelled strong wrong, yeah they spelled it stong, your stupid kid will now be stong,
How the hell they get that wrong, weren't you watching when they put that shit on

You love your laughing Jesus tat, 
But that's just Jesus laughing at your queer tattoos, 
So many queer tattoos

I guess you got that tribal band, 
From the tribe indigenous to the land of queer tattoos, 
We're the queer tattoos

You got barbwire, got a poker ace, got that fucked up thing on mike tyson's face, 
Got a queer tattoo, a sewiously queer tattoo

And by queer i just mean bad it wouldn't mean gay unless you had
A pink triangle on a rainbow flag, with a bear wearing leather
And a red ball gag, that's a queer tattoo, a literally queer tattoo
