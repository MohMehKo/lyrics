Will you show me your heart?
Will you open it wide?
Expose the raw nerves
Will you let me inside?
Can you tear down the wall?
For the mortar has dried
Will you show me your heart?
Will you let me inside?

There’s not to infer
And nothing implied
I literally mean
Will you let me inside?

I am at your front door
It’s not open, I tried
It’s cold as ball out here
Let me inside

You know when it’s dark
I get terrified
Come on seriously, will you let me inside?
I think I just saw a possum
All beaded eyed
Those things fucking scare me
Please let me inside
(Let me inside)

Are you angry with me?
Are you preoccupied?
Are you taking a shit and can’t let me inside?
I can smell from the kitchen
The food that you fried
I’ve had half of a power bar
Let me inside
(Let me inside)

How can this situation be rectified?
Hey, here’s an idea, fucking let me inside
Tried to climb through your window
But I was too wide
You should get bigger windows
Or let me inside
(Let me inside)

Are you with a new guy?
That you’re trying to hide
Girl, I’m down for a threesome
Just let me inside

Ok, that’s the last straw
I’m a man, I’ve got pride
And my toesies are freezing
Please let me inside
(Let me inside)

Will you show me your heart?
Will you open it wide?
Expose the raw nerves
Will you let me inside?
Can you tear down the wall?
For the mortar has dried
Till then I’ll be sitting here
Waiting out…
