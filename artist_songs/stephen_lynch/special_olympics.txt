Watch them run
Watch them fall
Watch them try to catch a ball
Olympics

Special Olympics

Watch them laugh
Watch them drool
Watch them fall into the pool
That's diving

At the Special Olympics

And I know full well
That I will burn in Hell
(Gradually Spoken faster as line progresses)
But those guys playing wheelchair basketball 
got to be about the funniest freaking thing I've ever seen in my life!

At the Special Olympics

Kid with DOWNS
Wins the race
Even though he stood in place
Olympics

Special Olympics

'Round his neck
Gold medals hung
Resting on his giant tongue-
Olympics

Special Olympics

But I kid when I sing
'Cause these games are a beautiful thing
(Gradually spoken faster)
Okay I'm really just avoiding Karma 
because my kids are probably going to be born crippled and blind 
and be some retard that I'll have to spend with all my time

At the Special Olympics
