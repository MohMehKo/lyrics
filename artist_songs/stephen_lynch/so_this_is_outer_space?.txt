So this is outer space
What a lovely place
I can't wait to tell the human race
Hello, alien. Will you be my friend?
Wait, there's something I can't comprehend
It's not outer space at all
I'm just at the mall
Holy shit, I'm freaking out y'all

You're on acids
You're on acids
You're on acids

Oh that's right, let's go to the arcade

LSD will keep me sane
Help me reach a higher plane
According to the spiders in my brain
Hey, there's a girl I know
I should say hello
But her face is melting
Got to go
Oh I'm freaking out again
Where's that alien
I need him to tell me that this trip will end

You're on acids
You're on acids
You're on acids

All the colors, pretty colors

I met the devil, he was at the Cinnabon
With a monkey named Ramone
Oh, there was dancing on a seven-headed snake
Man, this acid's way too strong
Acid's way too strong

In a psychedelic state
Watch my pupils dilate
Staring in this mirror
For three hours straight
My reflection starts to glow
Then says man it's time to go

Hey reflection please don't
Harsh my mellow bro
Oh there's that alien
Sir we meet again
I've got a tab of window pane
For you, my friend
Don't take too much
You'll peak too soon
What a crazy afternoon
Me and an alien are tripping balls to the moon

We're on acids
We're on acids
We're on acids

Got some left for the devil and Ramone
