Oh my God, I feel sick
Drank too much, whiskey dick
Tried so hard  with this chick
Still too soft, whiskey dick

Rise it must, point to prove
Wait, I just felt it move
Tried a-gain, have no doubt
Now it's in, fell back out

Pleasure she is not receiving
Bored and angry, now she's leaving
It just lies there, looking guilty
Small and shrivelled, white and wilty

Did your best, gave up quick
Get some rest, whiskey dick
