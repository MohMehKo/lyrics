I used to think the perfect girl was only in my dreams
Until I saw your perfect face upon the movie screen
You seemed to know that I was there
As though from God's design.

And as I cried,
I told myself someday you'd be mine
Rae Dawn Chong, baby, won't you hear my song?
I have loved you for so long,
And I know I can make you love me too.

I write you letters every day.
I send flowers to your home.
But it's difficult to prove my love
When you won't answer the phone.

And looking through binoculars
Makes it really hard to see you
From the camp that I've set up
In your front yard.

Rae Dawn Chong, why won't you hear my song?
What am I doing wrong?
'Cause I can't seem to make you love me too.

And here inside my prison cell
Just lying in my bed
I wonder if you loved me
When I shot you in the head...

Rae Dawn Chong, you only had to hear my song.
I even bought your dad a bong. (Tommy Chong...Cheech and Chong)
And all you had to do was love me.
I gave you every chance to love me.
You stupid bitch, you should have loved me too...
