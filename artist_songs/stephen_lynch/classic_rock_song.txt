Get home late from work tonight 
Baby, my body's achin'. 
Can't stop thinkin' 'bout you and me 
And the love that we'll be makin'. 
So I chill the champagne 
Light a candle or two 
(Baby, all the things I'ma do to you) 
I love you so much my little heart is breakin'. 

Let's make love 
Oh baby, let's make love 
Your body fits me like a glove 
So baby, let's make love 
(Baby, let's make love, oooh yeah) 
Baby let's make love, yeah, yeah, alright 

Ain't nobody in the world 
In love as we are. 
Making love to you's like being inside a shooting star. 
Now I'm in so deep, baby, we're groovin 
(Love the way your body is movin') 
Then I pull it out just a little bit too far 

And I accidentally stick it in your butthole. 
I put it in your butthole. 
I swear that wasn't my goal 
To put it all up in your bootyhole. 

And I swear 
I'll never do it again. 
...Unless you kinda liked it.
