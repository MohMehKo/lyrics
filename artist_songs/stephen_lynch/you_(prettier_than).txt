Hand in hand we walk the city
'neath the darkened skies
Stealing kisses in the shadows
Away from prying eyes

Hiding out from those we know
Secrets whispered, voices low
Pulses raising, hearts aflame
A love that dare not speak it's name

Well we just can't let people see
That you're not hot enough for me
Don't tell our families or our friends
Say one word and this thing ends
It's true
Cause I'm prettier than you

I'll take you on a special date
Enjoy your company
If someone we know happens by
Just hide behind that tree

To a late night picture show
Or planetarium we'll go
A midnight picnic in the park
Anywhere that's really dark

Well we just can't let people see
That you're not hot enough for me
But I'll enjoy this right or wrong
'til someone better comes along
My boo
Someone prettier than you

I wish I weren't a shallow man
I wish that I cared not
I wish I weren't so superficial
I wish you were more hot

It should not be a shame to see
I love your personality
What we have is good and true
For you've got me
And lucky you

But we just can't let people see
That you're not hot enough for me
So close your eyes and sing along
At least I wrote you a love song
It too
Is prettier than you
