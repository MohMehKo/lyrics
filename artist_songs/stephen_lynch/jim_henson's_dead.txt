Pokemon's a silly faze
Barney's now just purple haze
The Power Rangers lost their will to fight

Yeah the pigs in space, they rule the sky
And Oscar's still a grouchy guy
And Animal is looking dyno-mite

Oh Jim Henson's dead and gone
But his muppets will live on
And Kermit's still hot, 'cause it's still not
Easy being, green

Bert is mad 'cause Ernie can't hear
With a banana in his ear
They must learn how to cooperate

Yeah The Count is counting One Two Three
And no one laughs at poor Fozzie
And Scooter's pissed 'cause Raulf is always late

Oh Jim Henson's dead and gone
But his muppets will live on
And Kermit's still hot, 'cause it's still not
Easy being 1 2 3 4 5, 6 7 8 9 10, 11, 12

Now Miss Piggy's just a big slab of pork
To the Swedish Chef who says "Mmm, pork pork pork"
And Cookie Monster wants another, bite

Yeah and Big Bird well he just can't see
Why the two old guys in the balcony
Think Snufalufagus is out of, site

Oh Jim Henson's dead and gone
But his muppets will live on
And Kermit's still hot, 'cause it's still not
Easy being, green

Oh Jim Henson's dead and gone
But his muppets will live on
And Kermit's still hot, 'cause it's still not
Easy being, green

Easy being green, no
