Hey Hey What do you say 
I come from a place called the US of A 
Ho Ho What do you know 
Hop in my car and let's go 

Well, This is a song for America 
Home of the red, white and blue 
Land of Marilyn Monroe and James Dean 
Apple pie, baseball and Shell gasoline 
and if you don't love her, fuck you 

Beloved by all from Tikrit to Beijing 
If the world were a school we'd be homecoming king 
Worshipped by France and by North Vietnam 
Afghanistan thinks we're the bomb 

Oh, This is a song for America 
Home of the red, white and blue 
Land of Marilyn Monroe and James Dean 
Apple pie, baseball and Shell gasoline 
SUV's, handguns and US magazine 
and if you don't love her, fuck you 

Our human rights record is something of note 
We freed all our slaves and gave women the vote 
Everyone's equal forever, always 
Unless you're one of them gays 

Oh, This is a song for America 
Home of the red, white and blue 
Land of Marilyn Monroe and James Dean 
Apple pie, baseball and Shell gasoline 
SUV's, handguns and US magazine 
Low carb diets and fast food cuisine 
and if you don't love her, fuck you 

To all war torn nations, to those in turmoil 
We'll help you kill despots we'll help you drill oil 
And if you don't want our help, that's okay 
We're coming in anyway 

Oh, This is a song for America 
Home of the red, white and blue 
Land of Marilyn Monroe and James Dean 
Apple pie, baseball and Shell gasoline 
SUV's, handguns and US magazine 
Low carb diets and fast food cuisine 
Crack cocaine, Abu Ghraib and nicotine 
Swindling CEOs getting off clean 
Housewives all hopped up on amphetamine 
Nipples get rated NC-17 
FEMA and levies and Hurricane Katrine 
George Bush's great rolling war machine 
I think we're in trouble don't you 

It might seem I don't think our country's so great 
But intolerance, bigotry, greed's what I hate 
Most folks are honest and decent and true 
Peaceful, compassionate, good through and through 
That's what it means to be red, white and blue 
and if you don't think so, fuck you 
if you don't think so, fuck you
