Dare I say,  the greatest poets of our day
Shaggy 2 Dope and Violent Jay;  
The hip hip clowns
Haters see just white-trash family
They say fan of I.C.P.  
must have the downs

I don't care, I love them so
Cornrow my hair and drink Faygo
I'm every where - I am Juggalo

Let us sing of the annual gathering
Come see a cultural happening, and also tits
Call us sick, say you hate our wigger schtick
But it's about the music, and also tits

You put us down but you don't know
I'm a proud clown, and so's my hoe
I wear the crown of Juggalo

Come along to the posse show
Our bond is strong, like magnets, yo
I sing this song for the Juggalo
