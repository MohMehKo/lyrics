Well you can run run
And move away from
But you cannot hide yourself
From self possession
Well you can run run
And move away from
But you keep my eyes forever

And your drug will keep you up at night
And your drug will mix you up
You don't love enough
Keep your eyes open wide
Even though you're tired
While you justify
What you've self-prescribed

Well you can run run
And move away from
You indulge your fix and
And then you're chasin' another

Well you can run run
And move away from
But you can't deny forever

So that love can wake you up at night
So that love can heal your soul

You can love enough
Please close your eyes tonight
There's no need to cry
You can free your mind
Now that you're alive

Free your mind

Well you can run run
And move away from
But you cannot hide yourself
From self possession
Well you can run run
And move away from
But you keep my eyes forever

And your drug will keep you up at night
And your drug will mix you up
You don't love enough
Keep your eyes open wide
Even though you're tired
While you justify
What you've self-prescribed
