Hold on to me when you're falling
When you're falling down to the ground
Hold on to me when you feel like
When you feel like you can't go on

Don't be afraid I'll never refuse you
Playing with a broken heart that's lame again
Don't be ashamed to reach out and take my helping hand
It's so easy to be, to be free,
All you got to do is
Hold on to me when you're falling
Hold on to me when you're falling down
Hold on to me when you're falling down to the ground.

(Hold on to me when you're falling, Hold on to me when you're falling)

Reach out to me when you're crying
When you're crying out in the rain
Reach out to me when you feel like when you
Feel like you can't stand the pain.

Don't be ashamed to hold your head up
Walking to this state of mind aint' no big deal
Don't be afraid to reach out and there's a friendly sky
Take your clue. all you've got to do is...

Hold on to me when you're falling
When you're falling down to the ground
Hold on to me when you feel like
When you feel like you can't go on
