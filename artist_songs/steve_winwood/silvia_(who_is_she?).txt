Silvia
Who is she, what is she? We wonder
Flames with praise acclaim her
Of wisdom and beauty
And grace has lent her
That she might admired be

Silvia, I can see
Wisdom in your eyes
Silvia, love will be
Your cure to devise
Silvia, I was blind
But saw the way clear
Silvia with your help
Our whole world is here

In a song of Silvia
Then always remember
She compares to no one
Transcending every mortal being
From our earthly dwelling we bring her
Our song of love

Silvia, I can see
Wisdom in your eyes
Silvia, love will be
Your cure to devise
Silvia, I was blind
But saw the way clear
Silvia with your help
Our whole world is here
