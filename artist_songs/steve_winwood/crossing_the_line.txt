When you're caught, the other side
Take a look and maybe start
To take up your life again
Crossing the line
Through the gate, what words to say
Demon takes your breath away
Hear your heart, don't be afraid
Passing through time
Spinning around the axis of a dream
Possibilities aren't always what they seem
Reject them and all your choices will be free

Crossing the line
Turn upon the winding stair
Past the door that isn't there
You have come you know not where
Passing through time
Walk along the narrow road
Where the ghost gives up his mind
You can catch the thread of time
Crossing the line
Spinning around the axis of a dream
Possibilities aren't always what they seem
Reject them and all your choices will be free
Crossing the line
