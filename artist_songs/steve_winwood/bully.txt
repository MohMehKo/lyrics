Bully
Can you be wrong?
You are crooked
As the day is long
Easy come and easy go
Heaven knows the things you took
Without my knowin'

You tried to ruin my life
It's gonna ruin yours instead
What's wrong
If I broke his hand?
Would he understand?
Even though he carries on

Bully
Can you be wrong?
You have sunk
Below the deepest hole,
Easy said, el numero
Does it make it taste so sweet
Because you stole it?

You tried to ruin my life
It's gonna ruin yours instead
What's wrong
If I broke his hand?
Would he understand?
Even though he carries on

Dig it all up
Never should have took that from me
Burn the light and shine it
Burn the light and shine it on
