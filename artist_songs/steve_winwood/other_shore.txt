There'll be times at sunrise when my heart speaks your name
For you left with no warning but there's no one left to blame
All those days full of golden sun when you walked by my side
And everything that you gave to me can never be denied

And sometimes the other shore is so far away
And that darker river's edge is too far away
And across the waterline is far away

On a new tomorrow cooling breeze shows a star
There can be so much sorrow, when you've traveled from afar
But there's nothing that can harm you when the night's closing in
In the bright lit heavens above us, you know we'll meet there again

And sometimes the other shore is so far away
And that darker river's edge is too far away
And across the waterline is far away

In the rush of our breathing there is always passing time
There is always somebody leaving, someone's always left behind
But something endures in the morning's blue light, I have you and you have me
And it'll be alright when the skies all clear, 'cause we're all born to be free

The other shore is so far way
And that darker river's edge is too far away
And across the waterline it's so far away

And sometimes the other shore is so far away
And across the river's edge is so far away.
So far away, far away, so far away
So far away, so far away, far away
So far away, far away, so far away
