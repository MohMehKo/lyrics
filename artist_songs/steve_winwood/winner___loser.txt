Sometimes I think I'm losing
Then again I think I win
I don't want to think at all of hope

It could be better for me
If I win or I give in
It could be better for you
If I lose everything
It could be better for you
If I lose or you give in
It could be better for me
If you lose everything

When you win sometimes you lose
All that you had when you lose
It could be better for me
If I win or give in
It could be better for you
If you lose or give in

When win, when you lose
I don't know who to choose
Winner lose
Loser win
Winner lose
Loser win
