Pretty Polly Possum what's wrong with you?
Your body's kind a weak
And you think there's nothing we can do
Good Golly Polly shame on you
Cause Molly made a stew that'll make a newer girl out of you

So follow me, its good for you
That good old fashioned Medicated Goo
Ooo, ain't it good for you?
My own homegrown recipe'll see you thru

Freaky Freddy Frolic had some, I know
He was last seem picking green flowers in a field of snow
Get ready Freddy, they're sure to grow
Mother nature just blew it
And there's nothing really to it I know

Aunty Franny Prickett and Uncle Lou
They made some Goo
Now they really sock it to their friends
Frantic friends and neighbors charge the door
They caught a little whiff
Now they're digging it and seeking more
