I want to know why do you always run around
I want to know why do you always run around
Every man I know is watching you pull me down

I want to know, do you really mean to hurt me
I want to know, do you really mean to hurt me

Well, I'm tryin' to understand the way you always treat me
I want to know if I can come home every night
I want to know if I can come home every night

All right, what do you say
Well woman, oh woman, why can't you try to treat me right
