When waves crash by my sleepy pillow
I'm dreaming love will surely follow
See weeping shadows on my balcony
But there's more than I can see

We're all looking
Sometimes we find
We're all waiting
To see a sign
But we're searching
Deep in our own minds
We're all looking
Sometimes we're blind

When life is much too beautiful to bear
I still feel pain of it in there
And as I walk across the endless sky
There's nothing good about goodbye
And everything that brings me down to earth
Is just another day to pray
To while the day and wonder what it's worth
There's nothing left that we can say

We're all looking
Sometimes we find
We're all waiting
To see a sign
But we're searching
Deep in our own minds
We're all looking
Sometimes we're blind
