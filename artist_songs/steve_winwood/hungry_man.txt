Hot desert wind
Burning sand
But this land it is my land
Wait by the well
Rain don't come
River's dry
Pray for my son

I'm just one, one more poor hungry man
Yes, I'm just one more poor hungry man

Sun in the sky
Hurts my eye
Mouth all dry
May God help me
Wait by the road
Man don't come
Rice all gone

For thirty miles
I'm just one, one more poor hungry man
I'm just one, one more poor hungry man
Yes, I'm just one more poor hungry man
I'm just one, one more poor hungry man

Shout at the truck
Passing by
No reply
Dust in my mouth
Somebody soon
Find me here
Drowning here
In baby's tears
Love in the world
Hear me soon
Save us all
And save my child
Birds in the skies
Flying low
Baby no
His tears all dry.

I'm just one, one more poor hungry man
I'm just one, one more poor hungry man
I'm just one, one more poor hungry man
Yes, I'm just one more poor hungry man

I'm just one, one more poor hungry man
Yes, I'm just one more poor hungry man
I'm just one, one more poor hungry man
Yes, I'm just one more poor hungry man
