You ride on the swing in and out of the bars
Capturing moments of life in a jar
Playing with children, acting as stars
Guiding your visions to heaven and heaven is in your mind

Take extra care not to lose what up feel
The apple you're eating is simple and real
Water the flowers that grow at you heel
Guiding your visions to heaven and heaven is in your mind
