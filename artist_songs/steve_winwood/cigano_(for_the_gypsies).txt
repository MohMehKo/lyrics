Moving on
No abode
Through the day and night, bridle road
Turning from the thirsty day
Time is right to slip away

Cigano, it's a road to anywhere
With open sky for shelter
Freedom's all you have to bear
Cigano, it's a never-ending road
Secret destination

Lonely fires, darkened sky
Never staying just passing by
At the crossroads, horses fed
Guided by stars overhead

Cigano, it's a road to anywhere
With open sky for shelter
Freedom's all you have to bear
Cigano, a never-ending road
Secret destination
Destiny foretold

Moving on
No abode
Through the day and night, bridle road
Turning from the thirsty day
Time is right to slip away

Cigano, it's a road to anywhere
With open sky for shelter
Freedom's all you have to bear
Cigano, it's a never-ending road
Taking his existence (secret destination)
Destiny foretold
