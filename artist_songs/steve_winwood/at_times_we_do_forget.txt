Well, the world's no perfect place
We're only doing what we can do
When the night comes over me
Open my eyes up to a brighter sky

And the light shines above every nation
But at times we do forget about them
Like my brother who is falling down
But at times we do forget about him

Well truth is an empty word
Spoken in vain, yeah, like we all do
Blind hate the modern way
But every life has a beautiful name

And the light shines above every nation
But at times we do forget about them
Like my brother who is falling down
But at times we do forget about him

No regrets can save us
And only our hearts have any answer
Oh, it's you..

And the lights shines above every nation
But at times we do forget about them
Like my brother who is falling down
But at times we do forget about him

Time to break out now
Out of the prison of our own mind
There's a rhyme where ther's a reason
Everyone's dreaming of the same dream, dream on
Forget about it, oh, forget about it
