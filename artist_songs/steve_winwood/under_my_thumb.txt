Under my thumb's the girl who once had her way
Under my thumb's a girl who once had her day
It's down to me, oh the way she does when she's spoken to
It's down to me, the change has come and she's under my thumb

Under my thumb's that girl who once had her way
Under my thumb's a girl who had her day
It's down to me, oh the difference in the clothes she wears
It's down to me, the change has come and she's under my thumb

Under my thumb's a siamese cat of a girl
Under my thumb, she's the sweetest pet in this world
It's down to me, oh the difference in the clothes she wears
It's down to me, the change has come and she's under my thumb

Under my thumb's a girl who once had her day
Under my thumb's the girl who once had me down
It's down to me, oh the way she talks when she's spoken to
It's down to me, the change has come and she's under my thumb

The change has come, oh yeah and she's under my thumb
The change has come, yeah he's come and she's under my thumb
The change has come, oo oh and she's under my thumb
The change has come and she's under my thumb
