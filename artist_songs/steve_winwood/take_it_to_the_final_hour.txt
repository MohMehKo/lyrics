Late in the evening
Early she is to dawn
I have belief in this Evensong
To offer up, up to Heaven
So much, a part of livin'

Young voices fillin' up my life
That's what I've been put here to do
Teaching what has been taught to me
Hold on to what my Father said
Take it to the final hour

I have belief in
Twilight to turn me on
Peace falls in Summer's rain
This evening song
To offer up, up to heaven
So much a part of living

Off out into the distance now
Someday she is on her way
To bring us all together now
Hold on
To what my Father said
Take it to the final hour

Hold on
To what my Father said
Take it to the final hour

Young voices fillin' up my life
That's what I've been put here to do
Teaching what has been taught to me
Hold on to what my Father said
Take it to the final hour
Hold on to what my Father said
Take it to the final hour
