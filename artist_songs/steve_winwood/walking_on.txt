There's a place that I know
From this feeling
It keeps on getting better now
Making love
Seeing faces in the clouds
Hear what they will tell me now
Out beyond the blue horizon and
In the wake of falling stars
A new day dawns giving rise to reasons why
It is that I am walking on

High above looking down on me
So alive and it's flowing free
Through my veins in eternity
As I walk

Open handed open-hearted lazy thoughts
Of nothing serious
Just a day in a life with another chance
To see what yet has to be seen
Placing one foot in front of the other
Feel the breeze flow through your body now

An angel on my shoulder's telling me
Keep on walking and believe
