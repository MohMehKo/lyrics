I got rambling,
I got rambling all on my mind.
I got rambling,
I got rambling all on my mind.
I hates to leave my baby,
But she treats me so unkind.

I got mean things,
I got mean things all on my mind.
I got mean things,
I got mean things all on my mind.
I hates to leave my baby,
But she treats me so unkind.

I'm going down to the station,
Catch the fastest train I see.
I'm going down to the station,
Catch the fastest train I see.
I got the blues 'bout miss so-and-so
And her son's got the blues about me.

I got rambling,
I got rambling all on my mind.
I got rambling,
I got rambling all on my mind.
I hates to leave my baby,
But she treats me so unkind.
