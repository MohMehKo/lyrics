I don't want to be hostile
I don't want to be dismal
And I don't want to rot in an apathetic existence
See I want to believe you
And I want to trust you
And I want to have faith to put away the dagger

But you lie, cheat, and steal
You lie, cheat, and steal
You lie, cheat, and steal
And I tolerate you
You lie, cheat, and steal
You lie, cheat, and steal
You lie, cheat, and steal
I cannot tolerate...

Veil of virtue hung to hide your method
While I smile and laugh and dance and
Sing your praise and glory
Shroud of virtue hung to mask your stigma
As I smile and laugh and dance and
Sing your glory while

You lie, cheat, and steal
Lie, cheat, and steal
Lie, cheat, and steal
How can I tolerate you?
You lie, cheat, and steal
You lie, cheat, and steal
You lie, cheat, and steal
How can I tolerate?

Our guilt, our blame, I've been far too sympathetic
Our blood, our fault, I've been far too sympathetic
I am not innocent
I am not innocent
You are not innocent
No one is innocent

You lie, cheat, and steal
Lie, cheat, and steal
Lie, cheat, and steal
How can I tolerate you?
You lie, cheat, and steal
You lie, cheat, and steal
You lie, cheat, and steal
How can I tolerate?

I will no longer tolerate you
I will go down beside you
No one is innocent
