Here comes the water

All I knew and all I believed
Are crumbling images
That no longer comfort me
I scramble to reach higher ground
Some order and sanity
Or something to comfort me

So I take what is mine,and hold what is mine
Suffocate what is mine, and bury what's mine
Soon the water will come
And claim what is mine
I must leave it behind
And climb to a new place now

This ground is not the rock I thought it to be

Thought I was high
Thought I was free
I thought I was there
Divine destiny

I was wrong
This changes everything

The water is rising up on me
Thought the sun would come deliver me
But the truth has come to punish me instead

The ground is breaking down right under me
Cleanse and purge me
In the water
