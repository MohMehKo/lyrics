Johnny Baker works down at the mill
Makes enough to make ends meet and pay his bills
Even though he comes from the wrong side of the tracks
He's the first on there to lend a hand or give the shirt right off his back
From what we give we make a living those dollars diamonds and gold
But that old cliche is a given you reap what you sow
When you reach out your hand and your heart then your soul is satisfied
From what we give we make a living from what we give we make a life

Mr Miller's got a mansion on the hill
He spent his whole life chasing that almighty dollar bill
But all his so-called riches somethings missing in his soul
It takes more than havin' everything to make a man feel whole
From what we give we make a living...
[ guitar ]
When you reach out your hand...
What we give we make a living from what we give we make a life
