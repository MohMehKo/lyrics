Cigarettes are bad for your health
And smoky bars I can't help myself
I try to quit but it's a curse
I love 'em I hate 'em
I love 'em just like her

Old songs play like memories
They bring her back right here with me
They make me smile they make me hurt
I love 'em I hate 'em
I love 'em just like her

It's a fine line between love and hate
A heaven and a heartache
When it's good it's good when it's bad it's bad
She's the best she's the worst she's the best I've ever had

It's a fine line between love and hate
A heaven and a heartache
When it's good it's good when it's bad it's bad
She's the best she's the worst she's the best I've ever had

Photographs that we once took
When she still had that loving me look
I wanna save 'em I wanna watch 'em burn
I love 'em I hate 'em
I love 'em just like her

I love 'em I hate 'em
