Jesus come talk to your children
Jesus come talk to us Lord
Jesus come talk, come talk, come talk to your children

Lord we gotta war down here
I Guess you might have heard
Tween blue and red, right and left, 
The blessed and the cursed
That golden rule has lost its shine
And best as I could tell
Love thy neighbor and turn the other cheek
Has all gone straight to Hell

Jesus come talk to your children
Jesus come talk to us Lord
Jesus come talk, come talk, come talk to your children

Lord we have had some storms down here
Guess you might have seen
Some folks showed their good side
Some were down right mean.
The politics of fear and hate
Create the great divide.
They got us at each others throat
And got you taking sides.
SO
Jesus come talk to your children
Jesus come talk to us Lord
Jesus come talk, come talk, come talk to your children

We are black and blue
Tried and true
We are lions and we are sheep
So when I go to lay me down
My ragged soul to keep
I say...

Jesus come talk to your children
Jesus come talk to us Lord
Jesus come talk, come talk, come talk to your children

Jesus come talk to your children
Jesus come talk to us Lord
Jesus come talk, come talk, come talk to your children

I say Jesus come talk come talk to your children
