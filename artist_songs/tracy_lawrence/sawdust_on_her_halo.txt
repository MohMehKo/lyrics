all week long she loves to stay at home and hold me
she hangs her buckle in the closet 
keeps her boots up on the shelf
Heaven knows the Good Lord sent me an angel
but every saturday night she wants to raise a little hell

[Chorus]
she like kickin' up a little sawdust on her halo
yeah she'll whirl and twirl and twist and turn 
while the jukebox twangs and moans
when she paints on them tight bluejeans
it brings out the devil in me
she likes kickin' up a little sawdust on her halo

you can find her in a choir loft every sunday
winkin' at me with two sore feet inside her high heel shoes
every saturday night she'll dance till closin' time
and still be there in the mornin' for sunday school

[chorus]

[chorus (2)]

she likes kickin' up a little sawdust on her halo
