It's dark in here tonight a great place to come and hide from the blues
Hey I don't mean to intrude
But I've seen that look before and I've heard that slamming door too just like you
I know that hurt by heart I've been right where you are
I know how it feels when your world is falling apart
You're not alone tonight I know what lonely's like
I've still got the scars I know that hurt by heart

I hope you don't take this wrong but that smile you're puttin' on can't disguise
These tears in your eyes
And laughing like you don't care can't ease the pain down there inside
Believe me I've tried
I know that hurt by heart...
[ steel - fiddle ]
You're not alone tonight...
I've still got the scars I know that hurt by heart
