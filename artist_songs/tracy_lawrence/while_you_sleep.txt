I don't say I love you quite enough I know
Sometimes I go for days I'm ashamed to say
The world moves so fast and the words come so slow
And I let those excuses get in my way
While you sleep sometimes I lie awake and watch you breath
In the silence that surrounds the dead of night
Bear my soul that all the words sound right
I pray the lord our hearts to keep while you sleep
[ piano ]
Day's march through our lives like a sad parade
Our laughter and tears our hopes and fears
And I keep remembering things I forget to say
And perhaps someday I let you know my dear that
While you sleep sometimes...
I pray the lord our hearts to keep while you sleep
