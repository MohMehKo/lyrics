Little baby boy sittin' round his toys gettin' tired of crawling
He's pullin' up on an easy chair he's gonna try a little walking
He's takin' steps
A six year old with a new school bag staring down his drive
Holdin' on to his mama's hand he's going on his first bus ride
He's takin' steps
A teenage boy in a rented tux reaching out a trembling hand
To a pretty young girl in a satin dress asking her to dance
Steps some big some small puttin' one foot after the other
Steps the trick to it all is diggin' down to find a little courage
And it's okay to be afraid aou gotta have faith life's all about steps

For twenty-trwo years she stood by a man who did her wrong
With a packed suitcase and a Greyhound ticket she's finally gone
She's takin' steps
At a meeting downtown a tired old drunk stands and says his name
That leaves him eleven to go and he can already feel the change
He's takin' steps
Somewhere a great grandpa says I'm ready to go
Peacefully drifts off to sleep wakes up on streets of gold
Steps some big some small...
Steps some big some small...
