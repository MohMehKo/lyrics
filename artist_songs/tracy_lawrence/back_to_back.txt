It's a crying shame what fools we have been
To fight for no good reason when neither one of us gives in
I don't love you is what it takes to end it all
But instead we'll go back to bed back to back to face the wall
Back to back we're falling out of love
As giving in gets harder to do we start giving up
We lay together facing the dark each tear that falls is breaking our hearts
Back to back side by side and miles apart
[ fiddle ]
What a fool I am to lay here and not hold her
In a bed where love once burned our hearts that just grow colder
I love you are the words that's on my mind
But the stones we threw in anger have built a wall that we can't climb
Back to back...
Back to back side by side and miles apart
