We've built towers to the sky
And pyramids and desert dunes
Broke the speed of sound
Sent a man to the moon
We've roamed around this world
And sailed the seven seas
But we just can't seem to conquer
Our own humanity

[Chorus:] 
Jealousy jealousy jealousy
Bound and chained by insecurity
Time again we've tried and failed
I guess the devil knows us well
Tell me what's it gonna take to set us free
From jealousy

Made brother turn on brother
Tore families apart
Stole our trust for one another
And put hatred in our hearts
Caused empires to crumble
Never caring about the cost
Yet nothin' quite compares
To nailing Jesus to the cross

[Repeat Chorus]

[Bridge:] 
Of all the things we could've dwelt upon 
The one thing we let destroy our happy home

[Repeat Chorus]
