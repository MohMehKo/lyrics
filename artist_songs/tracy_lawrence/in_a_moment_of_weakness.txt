I knew she was lonely and I was alone
A stranger in a strange town too far from home
Her eyes blue as diamonds her hair black as coal
I could feel her desire burning like fire right down to my soul
In a moment of weakness who would have known
God was in heaven you were at home
I could have easily fallen forgotten till dawn
But in a moment of weakness your love held strong

I could say I wasn't tempted that would be a lie
A man is only human man and she was so alive
Could have said it didn't matter thrown caution to the wind
Could have been in her arms truth is my heart wouldn't let me give in
In a moment of weakness...
In a moment of weakness your love held strong
