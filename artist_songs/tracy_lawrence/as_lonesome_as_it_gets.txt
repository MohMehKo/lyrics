I've been sittin' here alone in the darkness
With the sound of goodbye ringing in my head
I don't know how much longer I can go on like this
I'm about as lonesome as it gets just about as lonesome as it gets
For a long time now we've been drifting apart
I should have been glad to see you go
But now that it's over and you're on a silver jet
I'm about as lonesome as it gets just about as lonesome as it gets
If it rained straight whiskey forty days and nights
It wouldn't be enough to numb this hurt I feel
Keep this lump that's in my throat from chokin' me to death
I'm about as lonesome as it gets just about as lonesome as it gets
[ guitar - fiddle ]
When they dig a six foot hole in the ground and throw the dirt over me
Just let these words mark my final place of rest
This is as lonesome as it gets damn sure as lonesome as it gets
If it rained straight whiskey...
I'm about as lonesome as it gets just about as lonesome as it gets
