He was begging by the mini mart
Who'da guessed he had a purple heart
Scars underneath his bearded chin?
I bet you don't remember him

'Cause you were running 20 minutes late
And he was only getting in your way
But when you brushed by that wounded soul
Last Thursday afternoon
You met somebody who would die for you

Phone rang at 8 last night
Who'd call at such a crazy time
Getting kids into bath and bed
Can't talk's about all you said
All he wanted was a Saturday

Morning conversation down at bakers cafe
You weren't thinking when you told your dad
Try back in a week or two
But you hurt someone that would die for you

Somebody who cared so much
They'd gladly give it all up
If that is what they had to do
It runs deeper than flesh and blood

Heaven knows no greater love
Than the sacrificed
They'd make to see you through
Somebody who would die for you

Just another Colorado day
Morning practice for her high school play
From out of no where the bullets came fast
Shattered more than library glass

They asked her if she believed in your name
And she didn't even hesitate
God, I can't help but wondering
If I had been in her shoes
Would I be somebody who would die for you?

Somebody who cared so much
They'd gladly give it all up
If that is what they had to do
It runs deeper than flesh and blood

Heaven knows no greater love
Than the sacrifice you made to see us through
Your son died for me
Would I be somebody who would die for you?
