You called me up from Amarillo said you were coming to town
I thought I'd like to tell you hello and drive and old friend around
I pulled up to the airport confident and cool
When you stepped off that plane I knew I was your fool
My little Texas tornado blowing me away again
I swore it wouldn't happen again but I looked at you and then
I'm like a tumbleweed in a wild west Texas wind
You're blowing me away again

You're lying with me in Atlanta it's such a beautiful lie
You play me like a piano I always let you get by
I know I'll go through hell girl when you find someone else
But right now I'm in heaven and I can't help myself
My little Texas tornado...
[ steel ]
I'm like a tumbleweed in a wild west Texas wind
You're blowing me away again
Texas tornado blowing me away again
I swore it wouldn't happen again but I looked at you and then
