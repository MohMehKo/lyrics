Sister cries out from her baby bed brother runs in feathers on his head
Momma's in a room learning how to sew daddy's drinking beer listneng to the radio
Hank Williams sings Kaw-Liga and Dear John and time marches on time marches on

Sister's using rouge and clear complexion soap
Brother's wearing beads and he smokes a lot of dope
Momma is depressed barly makes a sound daddy's got a girlfriend in another town
Bob Dylan sings Like a Rolling Stone and time marches on time marches on

The South moves North the North moves South a star is born a star burns out
The only thing that stays the same is everything changes everything changes

Sister calls herself sexy grandma brother's on a diet high cholesterol
Momma's out of touch with reality daddy's in the ground beneath the maple tree
As the angels sing an old Hank Williams song time marches on time marches on
Time marches on time marches on time marches on time marches on
