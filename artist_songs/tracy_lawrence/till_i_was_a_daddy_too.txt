Do you recall when I was six
I got lost out in the woods and you worried yourself sick
What about the day I got in my first fight
Mama she got mad but you swelled up with pride
I never knew how deep a fathers love could run
Until I had a son

[Chorus:]
From watching him learn how to crawl
To skinned up knees from skateboard falls
To praying he'd get through football alive
From hearing his first words spoken
The first time his heart got broken
And knowing soon he'll spread his wings and fly
I guess I didn't know what a Daddy goes thru
Til I was a Daddy too

Real love the kind that you can't understand
Until you hold it in your arms and touch it with your hands
Pure joy the kind that you can only find
When you live your life for them
And leave yourself behind
More and more I'm seeing life go by
Thru my Daddy's eyes

[Chorus]

The fast pace of time goes racing
From first grade to graduation
And knowing soon he'll spread his wings and fly
I guess I didn't know what a Daddy goes through
Til I was a Daddy too

I guess I didn't know what a Daddy goes through
Til I was a Daddy too
