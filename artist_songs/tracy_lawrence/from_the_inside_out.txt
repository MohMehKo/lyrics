She was always there takin' care of me
And I never took the time to look close enough to see
That taking her for granted was taking it's toll
I ran the race for me she went an extra mile for us
I kept hammerin' away at the solid rock of trust
If I was burnin' my last chance I never saw the smoke
Now she never let it show from the outside looking in nobody could've known
She didn't cry she didn't shout I was blind but I see now
She was breaking from the inside out

I was seldom there even when I was around
If I'd seen the signs back then maybe she would be here now
I never knew that she was leaving till the day she said goodbye
Now she never let it show...
[ steel ]
She didn't cry she didn't shout...
She was breaking from the inside out
