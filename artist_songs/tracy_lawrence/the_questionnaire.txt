Old magazine empty coffee cup
Out of courisoity I picked it up
It said does he still love you?
Turn to page 123
Thats when i realized she lefted it there for me

Question number one does he still kiss you goodnight?
Number two, was if he does, does he still close his eyes?
Three, does he still call you just to hear your voice?
Four, would he be home right now if he had a choice?

Fives a lil tricky, do u think he is being true?
'cause your eather half way finished 
Or your over half way through
Six said do you ever cry when your by yourself?
Seven, do you think he'd change if he knew how you felt?

I skiped down to ten to see what she had written there
It said do you still love him? 
Damn that questionnaire
