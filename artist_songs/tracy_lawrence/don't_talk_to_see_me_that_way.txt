Lately I've been seeing a certain glow upon your face
But I know I'm not the reason you wear that different smile these days
Though you haven't said you're leavin' darling I've already heard
And don't you know your silence is talking louder than your words
Don't talk to me that way cause it's my heart that's being broken
Goodbye still hurts the same even if it goes unspoken
You're tearing me apart with everything that you don't say
There's so much I haven't heard and that's less than I deserve
Don't talk to me that way
[ steel ]
Why can't you lay it on the line and say you found somebody new
I can't take the silence as well as I can take the truth
And I don't want you here beside me if that's not where you want to be
But you ain't said a single word and that's not enough for me
Don't talk to me that way cause that ain't no stranger's heart that's being broken
Goodbye still hurts the same even if it goes unspoken
You're tearing me apart with everything that you don't say
There's so much I haven't heard and that's less than I deserve
Don't talk to me that way
There's so much I haven't heard that's less than I deserve
Don't talk to me that way
