The last thing I expected was to get her call tonight
Cause the last thing that I'd heard from her was she'd found Mr Right
But when I came home this evening there it was on my machine
Now I'm just wondering what the hell it means
Said she's sorry that she missed me and she's been doing fine
I've run it back and heard her say those words a hundred times
But something makes me wonder is she happy with her choice
Or is that a tear I hear in her voice
[ fiddle - steel ]
The first time that I listened I thought boy she's got some nerve
But the second time I heard it I heard more than just her words
Am I just wishful thinking or did her voice really crack
I will never know if I don't call her back
Said she's sorry that she missed me...
Oh is that a tear oh is that a tear I hear in her voice
