The Rain falls sweet Jesus
The farmers beets and beans sure need it.
It will take every single drop you've got
To save those fields.

Truck stop in Arizona, 
Teen runaway from Oklahoma
Let the next stranger that picks her up
Has angels' wheels.

[chorus]
There they are lookin' up
Wonderin' if he's watchin' over us and
Oh please can you give us a little sign
Down here it is day to day.
The tug of war
Of fear and faith
But even when their hope is fading
He hears every prayer their praying.

Waiting room down at St. Judes
Mom and Dad sure could use a little good news.
Maybe a spare miracle is only 8 years old

[chorus]
There they are looking up wonderin'
If he is watching over us and
Oh please can you give us a little sign
Down here it is day to day.
The tug of war
Of fear and faith 
And even when their hope is fading
He hears every prayer their praying.
All we need is a little time

Down here it is day to day.
The tug of war
Of fear and faith 
And even when their hope is fading
He hears every prayer their praying.

The world turns like a top
with a hum of the voices that dont ever stop
But he hears, yeah, He always hears 
Every prayer their praying
Every prayer their praying
Every prayer their praying
