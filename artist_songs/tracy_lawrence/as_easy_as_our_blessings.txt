Lately I've been having more nights that I can't sleep
Storms of life keep blowing in sometimes it gets so heavy
It drives me to my knees and it's coming down again
Then a voice inside reminds me of the roof over my head
And my wife and kids are tucked away warmly in their beds

[Chorus:]
Up in heaven sometimes I wonder if God sits there and listens
To all his children thinking it'd be nice if we'd forget our troubles as easy as our blessings

Suddenly I don't feel like counting what I need
So I start counting what I have when times are at their toughest
My wife still stands by me and my children make me laugh
Then I crawl back in bed and start to think as I lay there
Could it be that he's already heard and answered all my prayers

[Chorus]

It'd be nice if we'd forget our troubles as easy as our blessings
