Outside Savanna, spring of 1844
They drove the last nail in and opened up the doors
Jedediah Moore was the first to be baptized
Saw him married here and buried here
When the Yankees took his life

I've felt the pain of people fighting their own demon
And the presence of the power that finally freed them
I'm a bright and shining beacon, giving shelter in the storm
Every saint and sinner, I greet with open arms

I am the rock, I am stained glass and stone
The foundation that this town was built upon
And I've been standing strong and steady all these years
Held together by the faithful gathered here

I've heard the words of deliverance and damnation
And the sweet sound of redemption and salvation
Entire congregations with their voices raised in song
While the angels in my rafters rejoice and sing along

I am the rock, I am stained glass and stone
The foundation that this town was built upon
And I've been standing strong and steady all these years
Held together by the faithful gathered here

And as long as there's a God above
And people still believe, my walls will never crumble
And I will always be

The rock, I am stained glass and stone
The foundation that this town was built upon
And I've been standing strong and steady all these years
Held together by the faithful gathered here

Outside Savannah, Spring of 1844
They drove the last nail in and opened up my doors
