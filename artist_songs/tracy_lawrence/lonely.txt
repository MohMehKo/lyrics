There's a red brick in a white wall
Somebody's brush forgot to paint so it sits there all alone
Like a hopeful sinner who finally goes to church
She don't sit among the Christians cause she questions her own worth oh she's lonely
Lonely like the way you left me nothing I know's gonna get me through losing you
The worst of loves analogies are tangled up inside of me
But the only one that brings me to my knees is lonely

There's a man in his own prison with a crime nobody knows
He has sentenced himself to life with no pardon or parole oh he's lonely
Lonely like the way you left me...
[ guitar ]
Lonely like the way you left me...
Oh oh lonely
I'm a red brick in a white wall somebody's brush forgot to paint lonely
