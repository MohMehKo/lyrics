I met him in a dive down in New Orleans I recognized his handsome face
It was none of my business but I had to know what he was doing in this kind of place
Cause he use to have money use to have honeys he used to be society's prince
But he still wore a grin when I sat beside him and ask where all that money went
He said some was spent on gamblin' a lot was spent women
A little on some good Cabernet
Three or four divorces at least as many horses that never left the startin' gates
Diamond rings and furs swamp land in New Jersey that week I spent a year in LA
I hate to admit I threw the rest away

He said money don't mean nothing is this game of life it's just a way of keeping score
Show me a man who's got everything I'll show you one who wants even more
Well so smoke 'em if you got 'em cause when you hit bottom
You gotta have a reason to smile
You can have a little piece of the rock I'll take a little piece of mind
He said some was spent on gamblin'...

Diamond rings and furs...
I threw the rest away
