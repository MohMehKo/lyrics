Don't need no Atlas where I'm goin' ain't up to me
I'm just a passenger ridin' with an old memory
I can stay in my pajamas lay here on the couch alone
I won't need my keys ain't gonna be leaving the comforts of my own home
Cause I'm going on a guilt trip dragging all the baggage she left behind
Going on a guilt trip my heart's at the wheel and it's driving me out of my mind
We're making record time I'm going on a guilt trip
[ guitar ]
I never know when I'm leavin' or when I'll be comin' back
I might go any time a guilty conscience is always packed
Just because you're looking at me don't assume that I'm all there
In the blink of an eye I'll go back in time and I can leave from anywhere
Cause I'm going on a guilt trip...
[ fiddle ]
Yeah I'm going on a guilt trip...
I'm going yeah on a guilt trip (going on a guilt trip)
I'm going yeah on a guilt trip
