On my first day in this world nobody really knew
What I'd be what I'd become what I was born to do
With alot of luck I grew up now I understand
God made me I believe and had a real good plan

[Chorus:]
Well my lips are made to whisper
Sweet nothings in your ear
My hands are made to wipe away
Every single tear
My arms are made to hold you tight
My eyes are made to see
You're why God made me

He put the beat here in my heart to only beat for you
He gave me feet to walk beside the one I love so true
A thousand times he made my mind to think of you each day
And you are why I'm alive and the reason that I say

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
