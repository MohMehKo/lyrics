Couldn't tell me nothing had to learn it on my own
On the restless side of seventeen the day that I left home
Screaming down that highway with a passion to break any rules
I went crashing at the speed of a fool

She was serving all night coffee at a San Antonio Cafe
She was headed nowhere I was goin' her way
With a trusting soul and a naive heart there was nothing I could do
I went crashing at the speed of a fool

You're either born for holding back or bound for lettin' go
So I throw caution to the wind wherever it may blow
It's the only way I know I go crashing at the speed of a fool

Got a hunger for that highway I know will never end
Lord I can't help what I'm not and won't change what I am
Till the roll is called up yonder to my ownself I'll be true
And go crashing at the speed of a fool
You're either born for holding back...
I go crashing at the speed of a fool
