Old man Red at the store
Would leave a note on the door
It'd say ran to the house 
Be back in a few
Leave your money on the counter

It was twenty-six cents
For the coke and some gum
Nothing ever got stole
You could trust everyone
Even out of towners

And football was played for the game
And music was made for the song
When daddy was a strong man
And momma was a blonde

I missed a bird with a rock
With my new slingshot
Broke a window and I was the talk of the town
And that was big trouble

There was no point ruinnin'
Or tryin' to lie
Was it worse seeing all of that shame in dad's eyes
Or watching the belt get unbuckled
no way

Most everyone played by the rules
Right was right and wrong was wrong
When daddy was a strong man
And momma was a blonde

[chorus]
Though it's clear as day here in my mind
The picture of a simpler time
Wish change would just leave well enough alone
Those days are gone now
When daddy was a strong man
And momma was a blonde

Now this boy on my shoulder
Tells all his friends
That I can beat up their dads
And his momma is the prettiest 
Momma in the world
And she is

Yeah I thought that too
When I was his age
Don't know how long I kept thinking that way
But one things for sure

He'll be standing where I am one day
But his mind will be somwhere back on
When daddy was a strong man
And momma was a blonde

I missed a bird with a rock
With my new slingshot
Broke a window and I was the talk of the town
And that was big trouble

There was no point ruinnin'
Or tryin' to lie
Was it worse seeing all of that shame in dad's eyes
Or watching the belt get unbuckled
no way

Most everyone played by the rules
Right was right and wrong was wrong
When daddy was a strong man
And momma was a blonde

[chorus]
Though it's clear as day here in my mind
The picture of a simpler time
Wish change would just leave well enough alone
Those days are gone now
When daddy was a strong man
And momma was a blonde

[chorus]
Though it's clear as day here in my mind
The picture of a simpler time
Wish change would just leave well enough alone
Those days are gone now
When daddy was a strong man
And momma was a blonde

Yeah daddy was a strong man
Yeah he was
