Everybody's got a pill these days
To make you feel some different way
Then the way your feelin' now
They can make you go up or down
Things for anxiety
Things to make an old man feel 18
Anti- depression and mood swings society of emotional zombies

[Chorus:] 
Pills to make you lose weight
Pill to make you gain weight
Pills to grow your hair
Muscle and bones and even down there
Pills for every ache and pain
Make you remember or forget your name 
Recreational to get your thrills
Or doctor prescribed with 3 refills
Get your pills!

They advertise em on tv
Things to treat kids with a.d.d.
Back in the day we had daddy's belt
I remember how that medicine felt
If folks would just get up off their butts
Exercise and not eat so much
We'd all be a lot more healthy and strong
And half the world wouldn't be hooked on these

[Repeat Chorus]

[Bridge:] 
Now most of us got a drug store at the house
It's like we can't through a single day without
All these....

[Repeat Chorus]
