Last night I had a real good time just my buddies and me
A bunch of beer drinking card playing B.S.in' SOB's
A regular spot on Wednesday night
It didn't matter that there wasn't any women in sight
Well it don't get better than that as far as I can see

But this morning on my way to work I had a wake up call
From a blonde-haired blue-eyed beauty whose car had stalled
Well I asked her if she needed a ride
Then she threw a little wink at me and climbed inside
I bet the farm that the number she left me is worth a call

[Chorus:]
Just like that out of the blue head over heels before I knew
She sure changed my way of thinkin' that's a fact
You can call it luck or you can call it fate
Looks like cupid shot his arrow straight
I ain't never had a feelin' like this just like that

[Chorus]

Oh no
