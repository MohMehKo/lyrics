I know she'll be back no matter where she's been
'Cause her heart doesn't notice when it's breakin' mine again
So I'll sit here like a fool and watch the world go 'round 'til she comes back to her old stompin' ground

She could find her someone else to hold
She could even wake up in his arms
But when it's time to come in from the cold
She always ends up right here in my heart
Her old stompin' ground

She thinks I don't hurt
No she doesn't have a clue
When we said it was over, she thought we were through
When it all falls to pieces in the new world that she's found she comes back to her old stompin' ground

She could find her someone else to hold
She could even wake up in his arms
But when it's time to come in from the cold
She always ends up right here in my heart
Her old stompin' ground

When it's time to come in from the cold
She always ends up right here in my heart
Her old stompin' ground

Yeah she always comes around
To her old stompin' ground
