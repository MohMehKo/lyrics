She can't make him lay that bottle down
Try and turn his life around
Talk to her preacher or go and get some help

She could never leave him
She knows that that would kill him
But she can't save someone
Who don't want to save themselves

But she can say a prayer
Someone is always listening
A few words here and there

Can make a mighty difference
For heaven sakes she can't make
That mountain disappear into the air
But she can say a prayer

Football team all shave their heads
Just so they would look like them
Put on their jerseys and ease into his room

They all joined hands around his bed
Close their eyes and bowed their head
They can't put him back in the game
Or bring him back to school

But they can say a prayer
Someone is always listening
A few words here and there

Can make a mighty difference
For Heaven sakes those kids can't make
That mountain disappear into the air
But they can say a prayer

We might stop a war, cure one disease
Keep one kid off the street
If we take the time to get down on our knees

And say a prayer
Someone is always listening
A few words here and there
Can make a mighty difference

For heaven sakes we can't make lives
Mountain disappear into the air
But we can say a prayer
