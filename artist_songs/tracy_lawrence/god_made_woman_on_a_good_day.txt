The sun smiled down all the clouds rolled away
God made woman on a good day
[ guitar ]
Legs long legs atretchin' all the way up from the ground to her thin waist
She looks so fine walkin' this way God made woman on a good day
Hips feminine hips she's got silky hair sexy eyes soft pink lips
A seein' all of that all that I can say is God made woman on a good day
Some like to cook some like to dance but every one of them likes a little romance
He made 'em all great in different ways something for a boy to appreciate

She's got sense got common sense
Like a bee handles honey she saves that money before it's all spent
Now there goes the reason that the bills get paid God made woman on a good day
Some like to cook some like to dance...
Oh God made woman on a good day
[ guitar ]
Might have been a Monday Tuesday I don't know
Could have been a Saturday night
From her toes to her head whe he finished he said
God made woman on a good day
