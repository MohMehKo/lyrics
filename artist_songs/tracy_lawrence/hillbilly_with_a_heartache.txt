Now he's a hard workin' easy goin' country boy he wouldn't harm a fly
Nadine down at the hair salon promised she would be his bride
He took it hard when she ran off with the beauty supply salesman
But that's how romance goes sometimes but Herschel don't understand
He'll play the same sad song on the old jukebox drink up every dime he's got
He'll peel out in his pickup truck sling gravel through the parking lot
You wouldn't wanna tangle with a grizzly bear or step on a copperhead snake
So if you cross his path you better beware been wounded by a woman
He's a hillbilly with a heartache

He was gonna buy her a modular home with no wax linoleum floors
Now his mama's worried cause he don't drop by to watch wrestling anymore
He just rides around with a loaded shotgun hanging in his rifle rack
If I was that smooth talkin' city boy I'd sure be watching my back
He'll play the same sad song...

Them big old arms that used to hold her tight cound bring about any man down
When a good ol' boy's been hurt real bad he just don't give a damn
[ fiddle ]
He'll play the same sad song...
Been wounded by a woman he's a hillbilly with a heartache
