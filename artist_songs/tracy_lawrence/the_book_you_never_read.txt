When you were lost and needed help
I hoped you would have turned to me
And when you couldn't save yourself
I watched you drowned that misery

I've seen the damage you have done
Every teardrop and misstep
You know I could have saved you some
I'm the book you never read

Your granddaddy carried me in World War 2
Your grandma swears that I am the truth
Your parents hands were on me when they wed
I'm like a member of the family
Three generations have handed me down
I'm in the drawer by your bed
I'm the book you never read

I can't take the first step for you
But when you take that step you'll find
You are the key, I am the door to
Forgiveness and some peace of mind and you know

Your granddaddy carried me in World War 2
Your grandma swears that I am the truth
Your parents hands were on me when they wed
I'm like a member of the family
Three generations have handed me down
And despite that is all they've said
I'm still the book you never read

So when the world treats you unkindly
And your heart is heavy with regret
That's when I wish you would find me
I'm the book you've never read

Your granddaddy carried me in World War 2
Your grandma swears that I am the truth
Your parents hands were on me when they wed
I'm like a member of the family
Three generations have handed me down
I'm in the drawer by your bed
I'm still book you never read, you've never read
