I'm there at 8:00 not 8:01
And I stay late to get it done
And tolerate the boss' son
Good jobs don't grow on trees

There's even rumors goin' 'round
There gonna shut this factory down
It's gonna kill this little town
If they send it overseas

And you can hope for the best
And plan for the worst
If lightening doesn't strike you first
Who knows what's gonna happen in the end?
I just work like it's all up to me
And pray like it's all up to Him

I got that Friday pay check in my hand
Minus a bite from Uncle Sam
But no complaints, I understand
It's the nature of the game

I pay the water bill, electricity
The mortgage and that policy
That takes care of my family
Should the good Lord call my name

And I just hope for the best
And plan for the worst
If lightening doesn't strike me first
Who knows what's gonna happen in the end?
I just work like it's all up to me
And pray like it's all up to Him

And at the end of the day
When I've done all I can
I drop to my knees
And leave it all in His hands

And I just hope for the best
And plan for the worst
If lightening doesn't strike me first
Who knows what's gonna happen in the end?
I just work like it's all up to me
And pray like it's all up to Him
Like it's all up to Him
