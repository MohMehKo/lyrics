Her Mercedes Benz is parked right outside
Ring on her finger man it's a sight for sore eyes
But now it's losing it's shine
A memory that she thought had died
Came back to life when he drove by her house today
And took her breath away

[Chorus:]
She's caught between a rock and a soft place
Between what's right and the heartache
Should she turn her back on everything and walk away
Or leave it where it lays
Looks like she's caught between a rock and a soft place

Lying together in the still of the night
Blanket on the ground holding onto each other tight
In the pale moonlight
The memories that she made with him are just as strong as when he stole her heart away
Like he's doing today

[Chorus]

Diamonds and gold don't make the perfect man
Should she give up everything she wants for everything she has

[Chorus]
