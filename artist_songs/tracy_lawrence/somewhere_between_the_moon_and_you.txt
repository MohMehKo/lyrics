Sittin' here in Fort Worth and for what it's worth it might as well be Timbuktu
Girl I'm missing you
The further I go in life the more I realize I'm no closer to that elusive moon
I can't put out your fire cause everywhere I turn there's a memory to burn
Somewhere between the moon and you
I fought the chill of the cold hard truth
That rainbow I've been chasin' left my whole world blue
I lost my dreams somewhere between the moon and you

I still see you smile and it haunts me every mile along this winding road
That I walk alone
They say that time should ease the pain but in my heart a bitter rain still lingers on
Could I have been so wrong
I climbed that ladder thinking' I could never fall until I lost it all
Somewhere between the moon and you...
[ steel ]
That rainbow I was chasin'...
