Thomas Jefferson he had slaves
In the land of the free and the home of the brave
I read about him in the seventh grade he's forgiven
JFK he loved to run around he and Norma Jean painted that town
But we know him as a hero now he's forgiven
Baby I know I did you wrong that's why I'm here that's why you're gone
I don't know just what I've done to be one of the unforgiven

I had an uncle he dodged the draft they said step forward and he stepped back
But we all cut him some slack he's forgiven
Judas betrayed the Christ with a kiss cartel kings get a slap on the wrist
Jesse James and Billy the Kid they're all forgiven
Baby I know I did you wrong...

I've made mistakes that's what life is but there ain't a thing I can't live with
And even though you can't forgive you're forgiven
