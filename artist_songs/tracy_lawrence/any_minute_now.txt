I always pride myself on being strong you've never seen me cry and carry on
But after seeing you with your new love suddenly I'm all choked up
Any minute now you're gonna see years of tears rolling down my cheeks
A flash flood of old memories will come pouring out
Any minute now it won't be long it's been coming since you've been gone
I'm holding back what I can't hold on I'm gonna cry out loud any minute now

Said I'd always live by my own rules swore I'd never be nobodys fool
Thought I knew how to hide the pain but that's all about to change
Any minute now you're gonna see...
Any minute now oh oh any minute now any minute now
