I ain't always right there with you
Even when I'm in the room
Don't say the things you need to hear enough
Like I'm supposed to
I'm beggin' for your patience
Longin' to embrace you
Heaven knows we haven't done this in awhile

[Chorus:] 
I can't help the way that I grew up
The only love I've ever known was tough
Sometimes a rough around the edges man
The kind with calloused hands
But tonight
I'll be tender enough 
To make you cry

You'd ever know how proud it makes me
Just to watch you sleep
Still can't believe at the end of these two arms
Is all I've ever dreamed
And every day I'm saved
Humbled by your grace
And the peace in knowing that you understand

[Repeat Chorus]

Just tender enough 
To make you cry
