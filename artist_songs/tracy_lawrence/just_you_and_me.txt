Baby take off your coat we ain't in no hurry
I see the fear in your eyes but girl don't you worry
I'll keep the candles lit all night so you'll know everything's all right
We've got everything we need and it's just you and me
I've got the covers turned down come lay here beside me
Oh baby let down your hair and your doubts about me
I'm gonna make you feel tonight like you've never felt in your life
We've got everything we need and it's just you and me
There ain't no one around and the only sound is your heart beating next to mine
Cast your fears in the fire give into your desire put your faith into me
Cause I've got everything we need and it's just you and me
[ guitar ]
There ain't no one around...
Oh baby let down your hair and your doubts about me
