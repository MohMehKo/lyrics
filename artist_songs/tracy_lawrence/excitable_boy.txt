I was one or two just lying in my crib
Shaking that rattle like I always did
Susie strolled in that little girl next door
Next thing you know we were rolling on the floor
Mama came a runnin' to her little pride and joy
Said bless his little heart he's an excitable boy

High school redneck rebel to the bone
Running eighty miles an hour in a thirty mile zone
Steal a little kiss skip a little school
Break another heart bend another rule
Cop tells the principal he's only making noise
Cut the kid some slack he's an excitable boy

I've been a renegade since the day I was born I get a little carried away
Never meant to do nobody no harm I gotta rock it I can't stop it
I ain't about to change
[ fiddle - guitar ]
Parking with my darling fogging up the glass
Slipping cross the truck seat tryin' to make a pass
My baby said stop we gotta take it slow
But you know me I'm always raring to go
It's the way I am I don't have no choice
What can I say I'm an excitable boy
I've been a renegade since the day I was born...
What can I say I'm an excitable boy what can I say I'm an excitable boy
[ guitar - piano ]
Ah you know I just can't help myself it's just the way I am
