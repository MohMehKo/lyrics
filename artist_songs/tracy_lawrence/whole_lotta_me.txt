I've been told many times that I lack commitment
That I run from responsibility
Only got one life and I'm gonna live it
Ain't nobody puttin' chains on me
Left some broken hearts in my rear view mirror
A couple that I'll love 'till my dying day
They always wanted more than I was willing to give 'em
So I'd just drift away

[Chorus:] 
There's a whole lotta  me I've got left to be
Places still to see people left to meet 
There's towns yet to visit roads still to drive
Stars I haven't seen in a montana sky
Lotta  me I've go left to be
Love still to make, dreams still to dream
There's years yet to conquer before I die
And things I still ain't tried
There's a whole lotta me

Now people have to make their own decisions
Most of them spend a lifetime with regret
But me I've found that hind sights 20/20..... I've seen plenty
Keep on searchin'..... I ain't through lookin' yet

[Repeat Chorus]
