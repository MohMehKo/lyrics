You know someone told me once
That angels don't exist
And that paradise was just a poor mans dream
Without hesitation
I can say he was mistaken
Cause I've wrapped my arms around celestial wings
But for reasons we don't know, some aren't  meant to be here long,
And then one day the good lord calls them home

[Chorus:] 
Now I may never find peace or fulfill some destiny
I may be cursed just to walk this earth alone
And I never will erase the memory of her gentle face
But I can go to the other side with a smile
Cause I knew heaven for a while

The other day I took a drive
To that place up on the hill
I brought flowers and I laid them on the stone
And I sat there for some time
With this runnin' through  my mind
How much we take for granted till it's gone
Then I got back in my car and slowly drove away
Knowing she was in a better place

[Repeat Chorus]

[Bridge:] 
The world turns and seasons change
And rivers keep on runnin' to the sea
Tears dry and  hearts heal
And what is meant to be will always be

[Repeat Chorus]
