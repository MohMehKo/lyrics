First he said he loved you he promised he'd be true
Then he was unfaithful word got back to you
Tonight when he came calling you wouldn't let him in
Now your tears are falling and you swear they'll never end
But crying ain't dying losing ain't forever
It's kind of like the weather it changes everyday
You learned yourself a lesson bout loving and lying
But you will live to love again cause crying ain't dying
[ guitar ]
Even though he hurt you he's still the one you want
You're gonna feel that way till the day you don't
You can pull the shades down grieve what's gone before
But you can't keep tomorrow from walking through that door
But crying ain't dying...
[ guitar ]
You learned yourself a lesson bout loving and lying
But you will never love again crying ain't dying
You will never love again cause crying ain't dying
