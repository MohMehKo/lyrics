The hardest thing I'll ever do is to walk away still loving you
But I'd give anything if you loved me something's just ain't meant to be
Can't say it's all been time lost
And in the long run I'd be a better man better off
Gonna find my pride and self esteam get on with my life follow my dreams
Ain't lookin' back
Learn from my mistakes once I've past this heartache
I know when the hurtin' stops I'll be a better man better off

I know Rome wasn't built in a day there's a lot of good mem'ries in my way
If I had it all to do over again wouldn't change a thing cept for the end
You want to be something you gotta pay the cost
But in the long run I'll be a better man better off
Gonna find my pride...

I'm gonna learn from my mistakes once I've past this heartache
I know when the hurtin' stops I'll be a better man better off
A better man better off a whole lot better off
