Life hit me when I wasn't looking
It dealt me a hard hand to play

I felt betrayed and forsaken
But I been makin' the wrong people pay

I'm Done... I'm Done... 

I've spent my last night in that prison
Where anger and pride were the bars

Hey I'm here to tell ya' I'm makin peace with the past
And I'm not ashamed of my scars, 

But I'm done... 

I'm done harbouring grudges and nursing old wounds
done clinging to grudges and singing the blues
I'm done pointing fingers at everyone else
I'm taking a long hard look at myself

A new day has begun ... And I'm done 

I called up somebody who'd hurt me
We finally settled the score

I had a right to be bitter 
Revenge would've been sweet
But foregiveness is what ended that war

I'm starting to see the big picture 
These days i'm gettin' high off of that

No more killin' my pain with a three day binge
That train has run out of track

I'm done... 

I'm done harbouring grudges and nursing old wounds
done clinging to grudges and singing the blues

I'm done pointing fingers at everyone else
I'm taking a long hard look at myself

I'm spending more time with the people I love
The ones that will cry at my funeral

And i'm done fellin' hopeless no I'm not going there
I'm greeting each morning with a smile and a prayer

A new day has begun ... A new day has begun ... A new day has begun
