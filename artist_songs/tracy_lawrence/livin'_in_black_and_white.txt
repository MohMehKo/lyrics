This makin' a livin' is killing me I work like a dog in this hot factory
Can't even afford a vacation when I've got the time
But I've got road maps of Mexico brochures and pictures of places to go
Dreaming in color livin' in black and white
I can drink margaritas with sweet senoritas work on my tropical tan
Dangle my feet in the crystal blue waters lay in the snow white sand
Well I've never been down to Mexico but I'm gonna go there tonight
I'm dreaming in color livin' in black and white
[ guitar ]
I'd like to buy a new Cadillac build me a house with a pool out back
And eat at the country club every Saturday night
But there ain't much pay in my ol' paycheck
But I'll win the lotta one day I bet
I'm dreaming in color livin' in black and white
I can drink margaritas...
Oh oh I'm dreaming in color livin' in black and white
