Who knows what I'm doing here tonight on this barstool
As if I didn't know where I should be
Through the darkness of the dim neon and lonely shade of blue
The light is a mighty hard thing to see but sittin' here it just occurred to me
I was the man she counted on to do her right Lord she was wrong
I was the man who wasn't there who made it seem he didn't care
Now she needs someone to hold her to make her feel alive
And she'll be with a different man tonight

I can't believe I turned my back on the love there in her heart
And turned away from those tears there in her eyes
Now I know where I belong is right there in her arms
Though it took so long for me to see the light
I'm leaving here a different man tonight
I was the man she counted on...
[ guitar ]
Now she needs someone to hold her and make her feel alive
She'll be with a different man tonight oh she'll be with a different man tonight
