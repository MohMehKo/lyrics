Woah, woah, yeah
Let's catch a ride on a shooting star
We'll wave goodbye when we pass mars
When it comes to loving you
The sky ain't the limit 'cause there's footprints on the moon
Woah, woah, yeah

Hey girl you got my head in the clouds tonight
Ain't nothing bringing me down 'cause you got me up so high
Not even gravity got a chance to hold back you and me
Let see how far this love will let us go
That kiss on your lips that touch on your fingertips
You and me we got a million miles to go so

Let's catch a ride on a shooting star
We'll wave goodbye when we pass mars
'Cause when it comes to loving you
The sky ain't the limit 'cause there's footprints on the moon
Woah, woah, yeah

Who needs the sunshine when I got the light in your eyes
Who needs this little town when we got the keys to the sky
Gonna take you to another world
And show you you're the only girl
That I wanna give all of my love to so

Let's catch a ride on a shooting star
We'll wave goodbye when we pass mars
'Cause when it comes to loving you
The sky ain't the limit 'cause there's footprints on the moon

I'm gonna blow your heart away
Slow dancing on the milky way

Woah, woah, woah, yeah
Let's catch a ride on a shooting star
We'll wave goodbye when we pass mars
'Cause when it comes to loving you
The sky ain't the limit 'cause there's footprints on the moon

Woah, woah, yeah
Not even gravity got a chance to hold back you and me
Let see how far this love will let us go
That kiss on your lips that touch on your fingertips
You and me we got a million miles to go so

Let's catch a ride on a shooting star
Wave goodbye when we pass mars
The sky ain't the limit girl 'cause there's footprints on the moon
Woah, woah, yeah
