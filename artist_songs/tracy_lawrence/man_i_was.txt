Look at me in that photograph before we were ever us
Long before you found someone else and broke our sacred trust
I hardly recognize myself sure has been a while
Amazing how much my life has changed since I've worn that smile
What happened to that smile
There I am with my head held high my step was quick and my eyes were bright
Back when I believed in love and would lay my heart on the line
I don't know which hurts the worst losing you or having to see
The picture of the man I was before the fool you made of me

I've wasted time here missing you doubting who I am
I can't make you something you're not but I can be me again
Oh deep down I know I can
There I am with my head held high...
I want to be the man I was before the fool you made of me
