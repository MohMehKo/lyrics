It's good to see your face again it's been a while
How'm I doin' well I get by somehow
You sure look good since your new love came in your life
You know I didn't see that fire in you he's found
Oh but I can see it now
Oh I never saw that look in your eyes
And I never had you hold me that tight
And I never saw you dance with your feet off the ground
Oh but I see it now
[ fiddle ]
Holding him you never looked more beautiful
Lettin' go has been so hard on me
And sittin' here it's clear to see what he means to you
The way you look at him it ain't no mystery
He's all I couldn't be
Oh I never saw that look in your eyes...
[ guitar ]
I never saw you dance with your feet off the ground
Oh but I see it now
