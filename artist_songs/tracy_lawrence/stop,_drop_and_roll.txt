I don’t know if you know what you’re doin’
But you’re raisin’ my temperature watchin’ you movin’
Tryin’ things on takin’ things off
Lookin’ hot in everything or nothin’ at all

I'm scratchin’ my head I can’t remember no more
What you’re getting all ready all dolled up for
Got me all fired up and wantin’ your kiss
Best thing to do in a time like this… is

Stop drop and roll
Before this flame burns out of control
Wrap up in a sheet keep it contained
The way you’re smokin’ it’d sure be a shame
Not to do what I know I should do
I better stop drop and roll around with you

Now babe you know I really wanna take you to town
But i’d really hate to burn that honky tonk down
Belt buckle rubbin’ just fans the fire
What we ought to do before it gets any higher … is

Stop drop and roll
Before this flame burns out of control
Wrap up in a sheet keep it contained
The way you’re smokin’ it’d sure be a shame
Not to do what I know I should do
Stop drop and roll around with you

Oh is it hot in here or girl is it just you
Well I know what to do

Lets stop and drop and roll
Before this flame burns out of control
Wrap up in a sheet and keep it contained
The way you’re smokin’ it’d sure be a shame
Not to

Stop and drop and roll
Before this flame burns out of control
Wrap up in a sheet keep it contained
The way you’re smokin’ it’d sure be a shame
Not to do what I know I should do
Oh I wanna stop drop and roll around with you
Stop drop and roll
Around with you
