Billy Joe McAlester junior showed up at the reunion
Clean cut shaved decked out in Armani's best
In perfect spoken english he said now days I go by William
And he talked about his new life and money he'd made out West
And he tried his hardest not to be that old boy we all new
Til he pulled out that Earnhardt wallet on that chain hooked to his belt loop

You can't hide redneck beneath a three piece suit
No starched white collar is gonna keep it from bleeding through
You might as well forget it it's gonna find it's way out
You can't hide redneck you might as well be proud

Well the last we all seen of Sandy she'd moved up to Boston
Law school paid off made her a Federal judge
Scotty had to go and ask her if she still hates John since she lost him
She said 'John who, oh yeah no I don't hold a grudge'
And her honor stayed as professional as long as she could
As the time went on she lit into John just like we all knew she would

You can't hide redneck behind a big old job
A big old cherry wood desk sure ain't no camoflage
You might as well forget it it's gonna find it's way out
You can't hide redneck

You can't hide redneck
In a big old growd
You're gonna blow our cover can't keep us from getting loud

You might as well forget it it's gonna find it's way out
You can't hide redneck you might as well be proud

Might as well be proud
