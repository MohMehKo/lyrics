Old folks say they ain't seen nothing like it 
Since the great depression back in '29
Men and women trying to scratch out a living
Standing shoulder to shoulder in the welfare line

[Chorus:] 
Hard times ain't got no prejudice,
It don't see black or white
Healthy and strong
Willing and able
We're just holding on in hard times

White haired preacher standing' in the pulpit,
Just a waiving his bible preachin' end of days
Death and destruction waging across the planet
Better pray to your maker that your soul is saved

[Repeat Chorus]

New born baby clinging to his mama, 
He came into this world just like you and me
Might be a doctor or a teacher or popper
Only fate can determine how it's supposed to be

[Repeat Chorus]
