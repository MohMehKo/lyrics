I'm out here stranded on this Oklahoma Road
Nothing but a broken truck heat and dust and a million high line poles
If only I could tap the line I'd be just fine if I could talk to her right now
Cause there's a voice inside of me that's saying something's wrong
Cause I've tried a hundred times and a hundred dimes to reach her on the phone
And like the sun my hearts sinking cause I'm thinking it don't matter anyhow
I got a feelin' she ain't feelin' what I'm feelin' anymore
I got a sneakin' suspicion love is walkin' out the door
Now I'm dealin' with a heartache like I've never felt before
And I got a feelin' she ain't feelin' what I'm feelin' anymore
[ guitar + steel ]
I like this ramblin' life but what a price to pay
To think I'd let a dollar sign and a diesle whine drive her love away
I've got a real premonition she ain't missin' me as much as I miss her
I got a feelin' she ain't feelin'...

I got a feelin' she ain't feelin' what I'm feelin' anymore
