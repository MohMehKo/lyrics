full count three runs down bottom of the ninth
two outs gone three men on they all roll their eyes 
its tiny's chance to prove them wrong and come out like a king
he bites his lip here comes the pitch with all his heart he swings
strike three

single mom best dress on
another blind date
first time in a long time she stayed out that late
a perfect night that ended with a tender porch light kiss
she really thought they hit it off and he would call again
he never did

[chorus]
everywhere you go 
you see the faces of reality
things dont always go the way we thought they would
theres victories and broken dreams that never make the silver screen 
real life scenes everywhere you look 
yeah everywhere 
everywhere but hollywood

hes working late she said she'd stay and help him out again 
somethings shes got just wont stop its starting to get to him
just before he loses track of wrong and whats right
he sees an 8 by 10 of two great kids and him and his wife
and he calls it a night

[chorus]

theres victories and broken dreams that never make the silver screen
real life scenes everywhere you look
yeah everywhere 
everywhere
oh everywhere 
everywhere but hollywood
yeah everywhere but hollywood
