I see the way he doesn't treat you right I see the tears that you try hide
I feel the heartache that you don't show I wish I had a way to let you know
I would be the shoulder you could cry on
The heart and soul you know you could rely on
With every breath I'll ever take I swear I'll never let forever end
If you loved me if you loved me again

There was a time I had it all with you till it came undone from what I didn't do
Now he's making the same mistakes and when he loses you if it's not too late
I would be the shoulder...
[ guitar ]
With every breath I'll ever take...
If you loved me again
