Lord You know that I'm no saint
But there is alot of things A aint.
I Aint the smartest guy around
Or the toughest guy in town.
I'm just the way that I was made
There maybe more that I could be
But I am proud of being me.
I know the worth of an honest day
Give him the Glory when I pray.
Thats all he ask I do believe

I've got people that I love
and blue skies above.
And a rainbow promise some time ago
I've got children still to raise
and songs to sing in praise. 
For the gift of life and love that we all know
There is all of this and more I'm thankful for 
Dear Lord.

We are but a grain of sand in time
The mark we make, we leave behind
If only in the hearts and minds of those we touched

I've got people that I love
and blue skies above.
And a rainbow promise some time ago
I've got children still to raise
and songs to sing in praise. 
For the gift of life and love that we all know
There is all of this and more I'm thankful for 
Dear Lord.

There is all of this and more I'm thankful for 
Dear Lord.
