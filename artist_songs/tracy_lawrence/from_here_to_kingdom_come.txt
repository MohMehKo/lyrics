You can move to another town take everything I ever gave you
Call when you're feeling down tell me everything I never listened to
What a sad affair I'm here and you're way out there
Now your friends say you did the right thing you were never meant to be a wife
And their expert opinions may bring you to making up your mind for life
What a tragic night truth ain't always such a blinding light
I can love you from here to Texas I can find you in Tennessee
You can run from here to Kingdom come but you can't run away from me

You can stand by your innocent line and pretend that things are better now
But there's a flaw in your perfect design you'd fix it but you don't know how
Baby I can drive I can keep it on the road as long as I'm alive
I can love you from here to Texas...

I could find you in California or any place that you might be
You can run from here to Kingdom come but you can't run away from me
