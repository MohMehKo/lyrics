[Verse 1:]
It came in like a freight train
Cut a path some 2 miles wide
With so much devistation
Can’t believe more didn’t die
As they were diggin’ through the rubble
Pullin’ stickes and stones away
Somehow little maggie was ok

[Chorus:]
With a butterfly
Floatin’ on the wind
Protectors and collectors
Women, children and men
I believe in my soul
When it’s my time I’ll take a ride
On the wings of a butter fly

[Verse 2:]
She fought a long hard battle
They were standing by her side
Daughters sons and grandkids
Came to pray and say goodbye
When they opened up that window
She was overcome with peace
Closed her eyes and drifted off to sleep

[Chorus:]
With a butterfly
Floatin’ on the wind
Protectors and collectors
Women, children and men
I believe in my soul
When it’s my time I’ll take a ride
On the wings of a butter fly

[Bridge:]
Well this world is full of cynics
But that’s alright with me
I like to think that angels
Can look like anything
