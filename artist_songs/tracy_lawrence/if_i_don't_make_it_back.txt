We went out for beers and a couple of laughs
Knowin' full well that every bad joke that Jimmy told
Might be his last
So we laughed like the world wasn't at war
Said things to him we'd never said before
And he teared up as he held up his glass
He said, boys, if I don't make it back

Have a beer for me, don't waste no tears on me
On Friday night sit on the visitors side
And cheer for the home team
Drive my Camaro, 90 miles an hour down Red Rock Road
With 'Born to Run' blastin' on the radio
And find someone good enough for Amy
Who will love her like I would have
If I don't make it back

We said, hey, man that ain't gonna happen
Don't even think like that
If we know you, you'll pull through without a scratch
He pulled me aside in the parkin' lot
Said, Amy and me we're gonna tie the knot
You're my best man, just wanted you to know that
Just in case I don't make it back

Have a beer for me, don't waste no tears on me
On Friday night sit on the visitors side
And cheer for the home team
Drive my Camaro, 90 miles an hour down Red Rock Road
With 'Born to Run' blastin' on the radio
And find someone good enough for Amy
Who will love her like I would have
If I don't make it back

If the good Lord calls me home
I'd like to think my friends
Will think about me when I'm gone

Well, Miller Lite ain't my brand
But I drink one every now and then, in his honour
And we ain't missed a home game yet
Had that Camero at 110 on Red Rock Road
When the speakers blowed
And I introduced Amy to a friend of mine from Monroe
He's a good ol' boy
But you know, she just ain't ready
