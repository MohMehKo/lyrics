Every night when I come home this old house it's always dark
You don't wait up like you used to like you did at the start
And I can feel the changes as I'm walking through the door
We still live in the same house but we don't love here anymore
We still share the same old bed but now our dreams seem worlds apart
We don't touch the way we used to and it's breaking my heart
We're turning into strangers ties that bind are frayed and worn
We still live in the same house but we don't love here anymore
And I would do anything for what we had before
We still live in the same house but we don't love here anymore
[ guitar ]
Oh I would do anything for what we had before
We still live in the same house we still live in the same house
We still live in the same old house but we don't love here anymore
