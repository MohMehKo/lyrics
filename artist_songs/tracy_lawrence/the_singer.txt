Now my momma she'll say that's my baby
And my daddy he'd say that's my son
My high school baseball coach said I was a winner
But not fast or quick enough to get it done
And if you had to ask an old girlfriend
I'd be nervous 
Depending on which one

[Chorus:]
There's a few things  they might say
At the mention of my name
The saint,the sinner the hopeless dreamer
Lord I just hope they don't forget
The singer

No my boss he'll say I'm hard headed
And my buddies they'll say I got their back
And college tried to call me a quitter
For knowing I was not cut out for that
Now my preacher he'll say I'm a believer
And proud to see I got things back on track

[Repeat Chorus]

[Bridge:] 
All I ask is that you don't misunderstand
I ain't' ever been much more than a music man

There's no telling what they'll say
When they put me in that grave
Maybe the saint, the sinner, the hopeless dreamer
Lord I just hope they don't forget
The singer
