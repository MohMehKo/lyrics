Broke down on the interstate just outside of Wichita
I said dont' worry baby it'll be alright
Two young and crazy kids who thought we knew it all
California hunger in our eyes
I could smell the rain I could feel the wind I could see the clouds rolling in
But in the arms of love we stayed safe and warm one step ahead of the storm

Our California dreams went south so we headed east to Baton Rouge
You said don't worry baby it'll be alright
Louisiana holds a brighter day had my doubts to tell the truth
But through it all you were right there by my side
I could smell the rain...

Hard times knocking at your door from the cradle to the grave
You gotta fight like the devil just to keep the wolves at bay
[ guitar ]
Hey I could smell the rain...
Oh we were one step ahead of the storm
