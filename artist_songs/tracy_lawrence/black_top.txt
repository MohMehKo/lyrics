Sunset's fadein' to a dark sky
Supposed to be in the 80's all night
Stay hot never cool off
Ya ain't gotta put on much baby
Tshirt and cut off's and maybe your
Braves cap hair pulled back
Thank God this week is through
Can't wait to see you

Down on the blacktop
Out in the neon
A mile long of headlights taillights and radios
Circle a couple times
Wear out the white (broken) lines
Head to the parking lot of the texaco
I can't wait to kiss you under the bright lights
Show you off to everyone passing by
Down on the blacktop

Hit all the street light parties
808 shaking that concrete
Lovin' how you're movin'
You let me know you're into me
Yeah that's where I wanna be

We'll be the only high we're on
Yeah take it in
And burn it up till dawn
