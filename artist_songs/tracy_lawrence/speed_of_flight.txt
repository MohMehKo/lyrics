We said our goodbyes I watched her board the plane
As she taxied down the runway I felt a pain
That brought me to my knees
All the times before we seemed to work it out
But as I watched her plane disappear it left me with no doubt

[Chorus:]
She's gone into the night
Gone out of my life
And I'm here alone
My tears kept falling down as her plane left the ground
I watched a flame go dark 
Faster than speed of flight my world fell apart

There's times that I'd swear she's right next to me
Sometimes I smell her perfume in the evening breeze
It still tears me up
They say everything in time well that remains to be seen
Then a clock clicking double time wouldn't change a thing

[Chorus]
