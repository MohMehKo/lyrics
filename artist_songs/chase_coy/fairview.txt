Leaves are changing you
The weather is changing you
You said I am changing too
It's that time of year again
Autumn is here again

And all of the words that you said
Keep ringing in my head
And I'm standing here
Hanging by a thread
Yeah I don't know what to do and so
For now I'll just enjoy my life on fairview
Soaking up the view

I'm filling these pages
With the words and the phrases
I could use to make this dream come true
When the lights go out at night
I go to sleep and shut my eyes
And know that I am always dreaming of you

The air is getting colder
Rest your head here upon my shoulder
And I swear that it will be okay
And if you must borrow my sweater
In the light of this fall weather
Just be sure to have it back by tomorrow

Time is moving slower now
I wanna make it stop somehow
And stay here in this moment forever
I don't know what to do and so 
For now I'll just enjoy my life on fairview
Soaking up the view

I'm filling these pages
With the words and the phrases
I could use to make this dream come true
When the lights go out at night
I go to sleep and shut my eyes
And know that I am always dreaming of you

I don't know what to do and so 
For now I'll just enjoy my life on fairview
Soaking up the view

I'm filling these pages
With the words and the phrases
I could use to make this dream come true
When the lights go out at night
I go to sleep and shut my eyes
And know that I am always dreaming of you
You know that I am always dreaming of you
