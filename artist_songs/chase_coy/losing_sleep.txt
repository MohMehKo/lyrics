We're both losing sleep just to make our time last.
Always in a hurry just to grow up too fast,
But we've got time.
Yeah, we've got time.

The season's always changing,
But we can't let go yet.
Setting two alarms in case we happen to forget that we've got time.
Yeah, we've got time.

And you don't have to go.
We've got our plans, but we keep our voices low.
And baby, that's the way that these things go-
We must be patient while we're waiting for the final chord to play out for our song.

We're both losing sleep just to make our time last.
Trying just to hold on to the memories that we have,
But we've got time.
Yeah, we've got time.

A year's already passed us,
But we can't let go yet.
The calendar reminds us when we happen to forget that we've got time.
Yeah, we've got time.

And you don't have to go. (you don't have to go)
We've got our plans,
But we keep our voices low. (keep our voices low)
Baby, that's the way that these things go...

And you don't have to go. (you don't have to go)
We've got our plans,
But we keep our voices low. (keep our voices low)
Baby, that's the way that these things go-
We must be patient while we're waiting for the final chord to play out for our song.
So in the meantime, take a breath and sing along.
