Our relationship is like a ride at a state fare
Give it few more weeks and it wont be there
It's meant to be taken down
It's meant to be torn apart
And honestly we both knew that from the start

But like a ride up high on a Ferris Wheel
It aint wrong to feel like you can fly
Knowing that you'll come back down
At the end of the ride

Our relationship is like a burning star, I guess..
And once our time runs out there will be nothing left
It's meant to shed its light, and its meant to some day die.
And honestly we both know that tonight is that night

But like a shooting star in a valid sky
It aint wrong to stop and to smile
Even though you just witnessed its demise.
