In a hospital room 
I'm struggling to stay awake 
And you, are laying on your deathbed, But you don't know it yet.
It's all just a bit to much and so I 
Step outside for just a moment. 
For just a moment. 

I stare out a dirty window pane 
And listen to the rain 
Pours down and it covers Everything.

And masks the noise from all the
Medical machinery
I am left with the sound of your 
Labor breathing.

[Chorus:]
But you are close to going home now.
Your father welcomes you with 
Open arms.
A room has been prepared
And so you don't have to be scared
As you leave behind the struggles 
Of this world.

The next day came with no improvments
Leaving you to explain 
These things take time. 
These things take time.
You told me you were ready and
You weren't afraid to die. 
He is always watching over you and I.

[Chorus]

Doot do's

[Chorus]
