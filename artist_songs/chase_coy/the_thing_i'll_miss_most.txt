I waited by the willow tree
Outside your parents house last night
Girl you know I warned you
Summer's coming soon
If you're gonna make a move
You better make your move

Because you know that in a week or two
I'll be miles away from you
On the California coast
But you know the thing I'll miss the most is you

Girl do you remember that time
I held both your hands in mine
And we watched the stars come out that night

You said that your heart could
Hardly take the moons reflection on the glossy lake
And I just whispered "I love you"

But you know that in a week or two
I'll be miles away from you
On the California coast
But you know the thing I'll miss the most is

If you miss me so much
That you can barely stand it
And your heart can hardly take
You know I'm never more than a phone call away

I won't hesitate to answer my phone
When your name shows up on my caller ID
But you know I can't stay
Because summer is calling me
Calling me

Because you know that in a week or two
I'll be miles away from you
On the California coast
But you know the thing I'll miss the most is you
