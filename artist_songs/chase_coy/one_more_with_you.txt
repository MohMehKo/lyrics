Three years ago I was so sure
But now I'm not sure of anything anymore
It's like the past is gripping my throat and I choke
And I'm still hoping I'll find out it's all a bad joke

[Chorus:]
So don't, don't tell me it's over
And don't, don't say that I'll be alright
If I could trade twenty years for one more with you, then I would
I'd turn back time, make the whole world rewind if I could
If I knew that you'd haunt my dreams every time that I sleep
Then I'd lay my head down and I'd close my eyes for good

Three years went by and I thought you and I were a sure thing
But as it turns out, I guess I can't count on anything
You changed your mind
And nothing is quite what it seems
You said "forever," but I guess you don't know what that means

[Chorus]
