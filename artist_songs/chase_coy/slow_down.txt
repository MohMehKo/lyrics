Spring is wakin' up the world here
The end of the school year
And as summer draws near
I'm growing anxious still

Birds are singin' in my backyard
So the sun can't be too far off
Painting the landscape 
With all it's golden rays

And this is the last summer we'll have 
All to ourselves
Before next year when we have to pack and move on out
No matter what happens 
I'll miss the friends I've made in this town

And I wish
That time would just slow down

I wonder what the future holds for me
It's terrifying honestly
So I guess I'll just wait and see if I survive

And this is the last summer we'll have 
All to ourselves
Before next year when we have to pack and move on out
No matter what happens 
I'll miss the friends I've made in this town

And I wish
Time would just slow down slow down
Down slow down
Down slow down
Down slow down
Slow down 

And this is the last summer we'll have 
All to ourselves
Before next year when we have to pack and move on out
No matter what happens 
I'll miss the friends I've made in this town

And I wish
That time would just slow down
