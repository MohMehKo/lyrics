On a runway once again on my way out of town
I think that I'm gettin to use to this and I don't know when I'll be back
Don't know when I'm comin back down
Am I comin back down?

The wheels are up I am stuck staring out of this window
Over the wing and the scariest thing is the fact that I'm practically
Living on planes these days, on these airplanes

So I'm waiting on the landing gear
To bring us down so I can hear your voice
And I'm getting out my cell phone now to speed dial your house

Cause it rains all day when I'm away
And I can't have you with me
And all that I can think about, is how much you love the city
And I want you here with me

There's a canvas of clouds below my feet
I'm painting it homesick because all that I love is behind me
I hope you still find me

Soon I'll be paying for taxis and riding in backseats
On my way back to hotels when I want my own bed
I get these instead

So I'm waiting on the landing gear
To bring us down so I can hear your voice
And I'm getting out my cellphone now to speed dial your house

Cause it rains all day when I'm away
And I can't have you with me
And all that I can think about, is how much you love the city
And I want you here with me
