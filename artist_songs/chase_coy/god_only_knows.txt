God only knows I can't be honest
God only knows I can't be more
God only knows I can not promise
God only knows I can't be yours 

I could be a better person I suppose 
If I could only find the strength to let you go
I've been know to run away 
Yeah I've been known for chasing ghosts 
But what I'd do without you 
God only knows 

God only knows you've been so patient 
God only knows you've been so kind 
God only knows that you've been waiting 
God only knows that you've been mine

I could be a better person I suppose 
If I could only find the strength to let you go
I've been know to run away 
Yeah I've been known for chasing ghosts 
But what I'd do without you 
God only knows
