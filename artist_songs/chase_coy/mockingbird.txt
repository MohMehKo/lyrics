Summer arrived on the back of a mockingbird. 
It sang a sweet melody, but couldn't seem to find the right words. 
I don't know if you've heard, but it's all over town, 
Yeah they're buzzing about it now. 

I was singing alone when the mockingbird came to me, 
Perched on my windowsill, and hummed along quietly. 
But before long she was singing along, and she said, yeah she said:

"I've been waiting so long for these words to come out, 
It's practically all I've been thinking about.
So thank you for finding the words I couldn't find on my own, 
Now I'm not alone."

Autumn was on it's way and summer was on it's way out; 
The mockingbird told me: "I change with the seasons," 
And that she was leaving town in a few days now. 

We said our goodbyes, and I secretly wished for more time, 
But the seasons are merciless. 
For a while we both stood in silence
Until she said:

"I've been waiting so long for these words to come out, 
It's practically all I've been thinking about.
So thank you for finding the words I couldn't find on my own, 
Now I'm not alone."
