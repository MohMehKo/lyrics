By now you should know
When she plants love in your chest
It's best to let it go
Before it grows
Like a weed in the garden of your soul, oh-whoa
Let it go
Ohh, let it go
Let it go

By now you should've realized
When you feel that burning in your chest
It's best to let it die
Because it spreads like a fire
Until there's nothing left but ashes and this emptiness inside
And that's why I let it die
Yeah, that's why I let it die
I let it die

By now you should know
When she plants love in your chest
It's best to let it go
Before it grows
Like a weed in the garden of your soul
