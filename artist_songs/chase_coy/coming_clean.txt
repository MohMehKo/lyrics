I'm a coward
I hide behind all of these delicate lies that I sing
But I'm trying to come clean

I'm so lonely
Surrounded by people that know me,
But don't know a thing
So I'm trying to come clean.

And every relationship I've ever been in
Has fallen apart at the seams
I'm just afraid I've been singing about love,
But I'll never find out what it means
And if I was honest about what the problem is,
I'd have to admit that it's me
I'm just trying to live up to all that you want me to be

I'm a liar
I sing pretty things
But I never quite say what I mean
So I'm trying to come clean

I'm so sorry
I know that I can't take it back
No I can't change a thing
So I'm trying to come clean

And every relationship I've ever been in
Has fallen apart at the seams
I'm just afraid I've been singing about love,
But I'll never find out what it means
And if I was honest about what the problem is,
I'd have to admit that it's me
I'm just trying to live up to all that you want me to be
