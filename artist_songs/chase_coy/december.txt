Just tell me you're doing okay
I can't help but think of you every day
and I know that it's hard when I'm miles away
but I know we'll be together some day

Fall is gone, Winter is here
I spent all December just wanting you near
so I'm singing these words in the hope that you'll hear
you're the best thing that happened this year

I've fallen in love, honestly
So I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
In the hope that these notes and the words that I sing make you see
you mean more than the world does to me

Let me be honest with you
When I said I loved you, it was more than the truth
you see, with each lonely night and day that I must go through
well, they just bring me closer to you

I've fallen in love, honestly
So I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
In the hope that these notes and the words that I sing make you see
you mean more than the world does to me

I've fallen in love, honestly
So I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
In the hope that these notes and the words that I sing make you see
you mean more than the world does to me
