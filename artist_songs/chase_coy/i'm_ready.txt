We sit in your treehouse,
The view from the top floor
The moon shinin' through,
All the leaves in the trees.

I lean close and whisper,
"Can we stay here forever?"
Out here in your backyard,
Just us and the autumn breeze.

For the first time
I feel like I'm at a loss for words,
There's nothing left to do
But move forward,
I'm finally ready for something good.

I dont know if you noticed,
But I'm trying not to show that I'm scared
That one day I might wake up,
And realize that you are not there.

For the first time
I feel like I'm at a loss for words, 
There's nothing left to do
But move forward,
I'm finally ready for something good.

For the first time
I feel like I'm at a loss for words,
There's nothing left to do but move forawrd,
I'm finally ready for something good.
