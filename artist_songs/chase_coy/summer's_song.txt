This summer is coming to a close
And I'm starting to figure out that I can not live without you
I hope you're thinking of me
Cause all the stars above me sing your name
I'll never be the same again

So please don't forget to call me
Just to let me know you're doing okay, miles away from me

This summer was the best I've ever had
I never want to see it end
So let's pretend that we're never going back home again
Just say those three words I know you're thinking
I'm sick of wasting time on these formalities
Please never leave my side

So please don't forget to call me
Just to let me know you're doing okay, miles away from me
So please don't forget to call me
Just to let me know you're doing okay, miles away from me

So please tell me, darling, why you're so far away when
I need you beside me tonight
So please tell me, darling, why you're so far away when
I need you beside me tonight

So please don't forget to call me
Just to let me know you're doing okay, miles away from me
