Everything is different now
Why are you so distant now?
Everything has changed,
Yeah nothing is the same
Since the day you went away,
Nothing feels at all okay with me

Don't you ever miss the midwest sunrise?
The view of the stars and the full moon at night
Cause ever since you left,
There's been an open hole in my chest
Yeah you left this boy such a mess
But I'm hoping that my heart will find some rest tonight

I'll try to explain exactly why I've been crying all the time since you walked out of my life

Everything is different now
Why are you so distant now?
