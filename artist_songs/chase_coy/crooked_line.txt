It took some time to realize that letting go means leaving something behind
And hardest part was getting to a place where I can put that aside 
What a mountain to climb 
What a crooked line 

Finding more than who I was meant losing everything I thought that would last
It took a while to arrive because of who I thought I was in the past 
What a mountain to climb
What a crooked line 
What a mountain to climb
What a crooked line 

It took some time to realize that letting go means leaving something behind
