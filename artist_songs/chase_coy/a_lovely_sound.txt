Over fall break you're coming down to see me
I know that the distance doesn't make this easy
but when we come together, it makes such a lovely sound
that's why I'd give anything I have to work this out

and everything I ever did didn't matter up till now
you make my life worth while like you've completed me somehow
and when we come together it makes such a lovely sound
that's why I'd give anything I have to work this out

for the first time in my life I know that I'm in love
I could write a thousand songs about you; they would never be enough
but when we come together, it makes such a lovely sound
that's why I'd give anything I have to work this out
