You gotta hold over me.
When you're around girl, 
I struggle to breathe.
Because, you steal all the air.
You're not even aware that you do. 

You gotta a light in your heart.
The way that you shine girl,
You light up the dark.
When the stars are not out,
And the moon has burnt out,
I still find myself gazing at you.

If I could just see this through.
If I could just be with you.
Forever and always,
Then I'd be okay.
And, these lonely days would be all in the past.
If I could just speak, right now.
If all of the words would just come out, somehow.
Then, you could just stay here for hours in my arms.
And, we would be finally together at last.

You got the best memory.
I love when you stop, 
And you tell the story.
Of the day we first met,
With the details I tend to forget.

You got the loveliest way,
of being impatient that I've ever seen.
Especially the way that you say,
"I can't wait, 'til I hold you in my arms again."

If I could just see this through.
If I could just be with you.
Forever and always,
Then I'd be okay.
And, these lonely days would be all in the past.
If I could just speak, right now.
If all of the words would just come out, somehow.
Then, you could just stay here for hours in my arms.
And, we would be finally together at last.
