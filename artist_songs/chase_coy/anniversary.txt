I know that I'm awake, but I'm dreaming all the same.
I know that you are scared, but baby, don't be.
'Cause it's one thing to say everything will be okay,
And quite another thing to believe it.

I know that sometimes, things can get so rough,
And I know that sometimes, words are not enough.
And I know, it's been a hard year being apart,
But it was better than the one before.

I know that we're okay, but I worry all the same.
I know that you are strong, but you don't always have to be.
'Cause it's one thing to say everything will be okay,
And quite another thing to believe it.

I know that sometimes, things can get so rough,
And I know that sometimes, words are not enough.
And I know, it's been a hard year being apart,
But it was better than the one before.
