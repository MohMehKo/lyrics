You were so bitter for so very long,
I was young and refused to be wrong.
And in the end, we couldn't save what we both helped to make.

And maybe we've made some mistakes.
And maybe I've witnessed the way a heart breaks.
And maybe I should've done things differently.
But I didn't, and we parted ways...
Who's to say things aren't better this way?

I swear that I'm sorry that I couldn't be the hero that you wanted from me.
And in the end, we couldn't fix what we both helped to break.

And maybe I've made some mistakes.
And maybe I've witnessed the way a heart breaks.
And maybe I should've done things differently.
But I didn't, and we parted ways...
Who's to say things aren't better this way?
