And the sun is pouring in
Through the window, and right onto your skin
And I've never seen a portrait
Quite so picturesque

And the hours slip away
I always struggle for the right words to say
Cause how could I try to describe in sentences
That I can't believe a girl like you exists

So don't forget to smile when you see the sun come out
Cause your laughter and your love
Is all I've been thinking about
Just the thought of you sustains me

And that smile of yours can make the whole world new
I love the way I feel when I'm with you

And when you say hello
It makes me happier than you could ever know
The way you light up every room you've ever walked into
Makes me glad that I'm with you

So don't forget to smile when you see the sun come out
Cause your laughter and your love
Is all I've been thinking about
Just the thought of you sustains me

And that smile of yours can make the whole world new
I love the way I feel when I'm with you

And the sun is pouring in
Through the window, and right onto your skin
And I've never seen a portrait
Quite so picturesque
