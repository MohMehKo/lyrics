Do you remember?
The chill of the air in November
The autumn breeze wrapped us in blankets
And we held our breath and closed our eyes

And do you recall that
We thought it would all last forever
The days of our youth and the weather
And the love that we wore on our chests

But all good things must end

And do you remember
Watching the sunset together
The rays of the sun lit up every last one of the 
Memories we held in our fists

Do you recall that
We always swore that we would never
Forget all those days and the weather
That led us to display our love on our chests

But all good things must end

And we both knew
That we were just making the poorest excuses
Like we all do
Just to feel like we have something solid
To hold on to
