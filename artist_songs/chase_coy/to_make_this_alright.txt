Girl, I know that lately you've been worried,
So I wrote you this song just to say,
You don't need to be in such a hurry, 
'Cause I promise here I'm here to stay,
I'm here to stay

[Chorus:]
And baby I'm right here tonight,
There's just been a lot on my mind,
And I swear all I need is a little more time,
To make this alright

Girl, I know that lately it's been tough,
So I'm playing you all of this noise,
In the hopes that these things can't get rough, 
You can find some comfort in my voice,
In my voice

[Chorus:]
And baby I'm right here tonight,
There's just been a lot on my mind,
And I swear all I need is a little more time,
To make this alright

[Chorus:]
And baby I'm right here tonight,
There's just been a lot on my mind,
And I swear all I need is a little more time,
To make this alright
