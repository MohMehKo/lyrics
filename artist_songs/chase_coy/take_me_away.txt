One two three four 
Take me away to january I'm done with this year I tired of everyone here 
I just need some time alone 
Before I'm ready to come back home

There's gotta be something else out there for me, I can feel it in my heart the day I started to dream. 
There's more than this midwestern town 
I can't let this place keep me down 
So I tell myself... 
There's a girl out on the coast of california, there's a world out there and it's waiting for you and I can hear them calling my name tonight... 

Take me away I need the sand and the waves, the sunset, and lets not forget those warm autum days. I just need to get out of here... and visit the coast just to see her.
