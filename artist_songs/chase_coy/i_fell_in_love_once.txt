I fell in love once before
Now I won't be fallin' for that anymore
Somewhere in your basement
I think I misplaced my heart
What did I do that for?
I don't want to see you
I don't want to hear your sweet voice
No I don't want to talk anymore
So if you happen to find it
I'd be much oblidged
If you'd drop it off at my front door

And don't leave a note 'cause I swear if you wrote me
I'd probably take it all back
And God only knows, I must stay on my toes
'Cause I can't allow myself to do that
I always wanted you to stay
But now I'm wishing you away

If this is what love feels like
I'm done with it
I fell in love once before
Now I won't be fallin' for that anymore
You'd whisper to me and we'd watch some TV
As we'd lay on your living room floor

I don't want to see you
I don't want to hear your sweet voice
No I don't want to talk anymore
So if you happen to think of me
Don't think that I will be waiting around like before

And don't call my phone
'Cause I'm feeling alone
And I'd probably take it all back
And God only knows, I must stay on my toes
'Cause I can't allow myself to do that
I always wanted you to stay
But now I'm wishing you away
If this is what love feels like
I'm done with it
I fell in love once before
Now I won't be fallin' for that anymore
