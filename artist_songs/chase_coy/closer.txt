It's just a few more weeks 'til I'll be
Holding you in my arms, baby.
The rising cost of gasoline and long-distance calls put miles between us.

We saw the stars come out that evening
And sail across the sky on kite strings.
Some talk about the future and the plans we have.

And I don't know what else to say to you,
I just wanna be the face you wake up to.
And trust me, baby, we'll be together soon,
'Cause I just wanna be closer to you.

I promise that I mean every word
More than I thought I ever could.
Calling you each night just to hear your voice.

And I don't know what else to say to you,
I just wanna be the face you wake up to.
And trust me, baby, we'll be together soon,
'Cause I just wanna be closer...
And I just wanna be closer...
I just wanna be closer...
I just wanna be closer to you.

I just wanna be closer...
I just wanna be closer...
I just wanna be closer to you.

And I don't know what else to say to you,
I just wanna be the face you wake up to.
And trust me, baby, we'll be together soon,
'Cause I just wanna be closer to you.
