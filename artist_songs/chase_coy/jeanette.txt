Dear friend
Sometimes I know the world can get you down
Just know I'll always be around
To talk about it.

And even when the night seems darkest
And hope is far away
I'll be right beside you
On that day

No matter where our lives take us
Even if we end up different places
I promise I'll always answer when you call

And when you dont have a should left to cry on
I'll be the single thing you can rely on
I promise I'll be there to catch your tears
As they fall

Dear friend
I know sometimes that I have let you down
Just know I'll always be around
I'm workin' on it.

And even when life seems the hardest 
And nothing feels okay
I'll be right beside you
On that day

No matter where our lives take us
Even if we end up different places
I promise I'll always answer when you call

And when you dont have a should left to cry on
I'll be the single thing you can rely on
I promise I'll be there to catch your tears
As they fall

No matter where our lives take us
Even if we end up different places
I promise I'll always answer when you call

And when you dont have a should left to cry on
I'll be the single thing you can rely on
I promise I'll be there to catch your tears
