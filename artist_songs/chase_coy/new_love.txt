I was sitting in a coffee shop
When you walked in and my jaw dropped
At the cutest smile in the world

Yeah I know that we just met
But it's too late cause I am set
On making you my girl

Who need true love?
Baby we've got new love!
Maybe that's enough
I know, starting out is tough
But we've got time love
And you can have all my love
If you want it, girl I know
That we have got a lot ahead of us

When you walked in and I looked up
We're staring down mu coffee cup
I knew you were, the one
And I know it's weird to think about
But I swear to god the sun came out
When you said hello

Who need true love?
Baby we've got new love!
Maybe that's enough
I know, starting out is tough
But we've got time love
And you can have all my love
If you want it, girl I know
That we have got a lot ahead of us

And now. What can I say?
I've had too many chances and let them slip away!
And now, what can I do?
I guess I'll just place my bets on you

'Cause who need true love?
Baby we've got new love!
Maybe that's enough
I know, starting out is tough
But we've got time love
And you can have all my love
If you want it, girl I know

Who need true love?
Baby we've got new love!
Maybe that's enough
I know, starting out is tough
But we've got time love
And you can have all my love
If you want it, girl I know
That we have got a lot ahead of us
