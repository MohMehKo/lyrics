I've diled your number, half a thousand times.
Hoping just to hear your voice on the other line.
I never had the courage to finally make that call.
I've been missing you so much,
Have you been missing me at all?

I need you here now, more than ever before.
Cause if you're not by my side, then tell me what is worth living for?
I never had the courage to tell you how I feel.
But honestly I've always loved you and I promise I always will.

Don't take your time coming home tonight.
Cause every second wasted I'm here holding on for life.
And with every breath I take I pray you're fine.
That I'm the boy you can't get of your mind.

I never had the courage to tell you this before,
But every day away from you just makes me love you more.
