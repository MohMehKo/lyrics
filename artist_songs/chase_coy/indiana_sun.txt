As I look out on the sunrise on the Indiana skyline,
and its rays are resting heavy on my face.
I think about the days I spent
Just wishing I was home again,
Instead of always traveling place to place.

I've been homesick
because I've laid deep roots
in Indiana soil where I spent up all my youth,
and I've been waiting just to be back home again
and feel the Indiana sun shine on my skin.

As I look out on the sunset
and I try hard not to forget,
All the memories that I made while I was here.

I think of all the friends I've made
and all the people I should thank 
for lessons I have learned over the years.

I've been homesick
because I've laid deep roots
in Indiana soil where I spent up all my youth,
and I've been waiting just to be back home again
and feel the Indiana sun shine on my skin.

Home is where the heart's been waiting
oh so patient, just to hear the sound
of the back door open
it's always open
I've been hoping just to find my way back here again.

Because I've been homesick
because I've laid deep roots
in Indiana soil where I spent up all my youth,
and I've been waiting just to be back home again
and feel the Indiana sun shine on my skin.

And feel the Indiana sun shine on my skin.
