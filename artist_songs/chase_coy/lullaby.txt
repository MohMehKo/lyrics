You can rest easy tonight
Everything is gonna be alright, I promise
Go to sleep and dream of me tonight
Everything may not be perfect, but at least we tried

So tonight

Sweet dreams and sleep tight
I've been trying so hard, can't get you out of my mind
And if this is how it has to be, just promise you won't forget me
And I'll leave you with this lullaby tonight

I know that this hurts you, it hurts me too
I wish there was something I could do to make it easier for you
Sometimes it's tough, too soon to call it love but I wanted to
Yeah I wanted to, but it's too late now to say all the wonderful things that I thought of you

So tonight

Sweet dreams and sleep tight
I've been trying so hard, can't get you out of my mind
And if this is how it has to be, just promise you won't forget me
And I'll leave you with this lullaby tonight
