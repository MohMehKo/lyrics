You met her in summer, you thought that you loved her and you called her yours by the springtime. 
But something was changing and 'round came the fall, 
And by winter she ended it all. 
By winter she ended it all. 

And oh you'll be fine when the seasons come 'round 
And you'll love once again 
But for now you'll be hurting and desperate 
Be patient while time heals the pain that youre in. 
Oh be patient while time heals the pain that you're in. 

Another summer, just like all the others. 
And you fell in love by the springtime. 
But something was changing and 'round came the fall. 
And by winter you ended it all. 
By winter you ended it all. 

And oh you'll be fine when the seasons come 'round 
And you'll love once again 
But for now you'll be hurting and desperate 
Be patient while time heals the pain that you're in. 
Oh be patient while time heals the pain that you're in. 

And oh you'll be fine when the seasons come 'round 
And you'll love once again 
But for now you'll be hurting and desperate 
Be patient while time heals the pain that you're in. 
Oh be patient while time heals the pain that you're in.
