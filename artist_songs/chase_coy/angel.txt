I keep staring out of this window 
Hoping that I'll see you arrive 
Separated by all this distance 
But darling it is so worth the drive 
So it should come as so no surprise 
That I love seein my reflection in your eyes, 
And I know why, yeah I know why, 
Your an angel comin down 
You are my anchor in the sound 
And I am thankful for the way you keep me grounded but you are taking off again 
It seems you never get to spend more then a couple days with me here on this planet 
You drive me crazy with the way that I sit 
Around your way just to see 
That perfect smile again 
Oh that grin 
I wanna follow you wherever go and you know that I would 
If you'd just say that you are stayin for good. 
You keep leaving before I'm ready, 
To let you go and I'm left alone. 
And right now you come down to visit but darlin one day it'll be home. 
So it should come as so no surprise 
That I love seein my reflection in your eyes, 
And I know why, yeah I know why, 
Your an angel comin down 
You are my anchor in the sound and I am thankful for the way you keep me grounded 
But you are taking off again 
It seems you never get to spend 
More then a couple days with me here on this planet 
You drive me crazy with the way that I sit 
Around your way just to see 
Your perfect smile again, oh that grin, 
I wanna follow you wherever go and you know that I would, if you'd just say that you were stayin for good.
