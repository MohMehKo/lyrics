If you hear this wherever you are
Just know I need you here
I need you near me now
You were brighter than the pale white moon
Reflected in your eyes
So I guess it's no surprise
I can't forget you
No matter what I do

I will always carry you in my heart
You'll always be my shooting star
Autumn days will fade away
But memories will always stay the same
I'm hoping you will never change
Don't ever change

I just need to slow down for a while
I'm missing your warm smile
And the way you used to say
"Stay with me till the daylight breaks
No matter what it takes
Just say you'll stay"

I will always carry you in my heart
You'll always be my shooting star
Autumn days will fade away
But memories will always stay the same
I'm hoping you will never change
Don't ever change
