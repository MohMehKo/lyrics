I wonder where you are tonight 
I wonder if I'm on your mind 
Cause darling I know that you've been on mine 

I'm writing from a hotel room 
It's been so long since I've seen you 
Away from me cause I will be home soon 

And I, I've been trying to find 
The perfect words to write to say you're always on my mind 

Mallory, I've finally put your name into a song 
So when I play it on the road and everybody sings along 
They will know just who it is 
Who inspired me to write this melody, 
Mallory, Mallory 

Your dark brown hair and hazel eyes 
The way your hands just fits on mine 
I wanna have you with me all the time 

I know that it's been said before 
I may not sound original 
But every single day I love you more 

And I, I've been trying to find 
The perfect words to write to say you're always on my mind 

Mallory, I've finally put your name into a song 
So when I play it on the road and everybody sings along 
They will know just who it is 
Who inspired me to write this melody, 
Mallory 

And if you're feeling lonely and I'm far away from home 
You can hear my voice just put this record on 

Mallory, I've finally put your name into a song 
So when I play it on the road and everybody sings along 
They will know just who it is 
Who inspired me to write this melody, 
Mallory, Mallory, Mallory.
