Here you are in my arms again
I feel the warmth of you on my skin
Catch my breath and then I let it go
I love you more than you will ever know

Watch the world through the window pane
All contained in that tiny frame
Time moves past and I wanna' stay awake

[Chorus:]
But the day collapsed on us
So we retreat to our separate rooms and we sing the moon good night

Here we are and the stars are out
Wishing that we could pull them down
Catch them and put them in a jar
'Cause then heaven wouldn't seem quite so far
Wish my worries all away
I hold you close to keep the cold at bay
Time moves past and I wanna' stay awake

[Chorus]

And I don't wanna', I don't wanna' go, ohh
No, I don't wanna', I don't wanna' go
I don't wanna', I don't wanna' go, ohh
No, I don't wanna', I don't wanna' go

But the day collapsed on us
So we retreat to our separate states and we leave this place tonight
