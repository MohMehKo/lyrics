Lately, I have been getting impatient.
I can feel every second of every hour, every day.
Lately, I have been thinking too much,
And the thought of all the years I'll have to wait keeps me awake.

Time is passing oh-so slowly...
Oh, they say "the future's looking bright."
And I know "these things take some waiting,"
But aren't we told that all the time?

Lately, I have been feeling like I am stuck with my roots in the ground,
But I am ready to move on.
Lately, I have been searching for words to describe how I'm feeling,
But lately, all the words I have are wrong.

Time is passing oh-so slowly...
Oh, they say "the future's looking bright."
And I know "these things take some waiting,"
But aren't we told that all the time?
