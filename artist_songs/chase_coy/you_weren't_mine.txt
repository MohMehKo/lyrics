When I told you goodbye
I hope you know that I meant it
'Cause no matter how I try
The sentiment is cemented in my mind yeah

You weren't mine, no

And when I said you were right
I hope you know I was lying
I couldn't avoid a fight but
You really can't blame me for trying 
And it's fine yeah

'Cause you weren't mine, no.

Nothing's like it was when we were younger and madly in love
But maybe I just made these feelings up.

When you said that you'd try
I saw doubts that went on for miles
I should've been less surprised but
You put on such a convincing smile
All a lie, yeah

You weren't mine, no.

And I went told you I cried,
Stretching the truth was a struggle
An ocean poured from my eyes I 
Convinced you it was more like a puddle
And it's fine yeah

'Cause you weren't mine, no.

Nothing's like it was when we were younger and madly in love
But maybe I just made these feelings up.

I wanna be free
I wanna be fixed
I want the whole world to just make sense
'Cause here in my head
It's all still alive,
So why did you let what we had die?

Nothing's like it was when we were younger and madly in love
But maybe I just made these feelings up.
