Rain, rain
Go away
Please come back 
Another day
But not today
'Cause I'm not ready
To say goodbye
To these golden rays of sunshine.

I believe 
That if you leave
I'll be just fine
Yeah, I'll be fine

But for now I'm stuck here waiting for
The sun to come and stop this awful downpour.

And the clouds will clear 
And I will hear the sound of singing birds outside my window

Rain, rain
Go away 
Please come back
Another day
But not today
'Cause I'm not ready 
To say goodbye 
To these golden rays of sunshine.
