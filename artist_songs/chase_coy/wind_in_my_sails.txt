Lately I've been thinking hard 
If life is a play what's my part? 
Am I just meant to be a boy lost out at sea? 
Cause I'm so much more 

[Chorus:]
So I'm setting sail for a new shore tonight 
One that I've seen before tonight 
It's easy to tell there is wind in my sail 
And I'm alright, Yeah I'm just fine 

Lately I've been thinking long 
I have I been doing this all wrong? 
Am I just meant to stay who I was yesterday? 
Cause I'm so much more 

[Chorus:]
So I'm setting sail for a new shore tonight 
One that I've never seen before tonight 
It's easy to tell there is wind in my sail 
And I'm alright, yeah I'm just find. 

Wait for sunset 
I will fake my 
I'll be back when I mistake come 
So don't wave goodbye 
No don't say goodbye to me 
Just stay away from the seaside 
Keeping your eyes on the distant horizon 
Knowing that I'll be home soon 

So I'm setting sail for a new shore tonight 
One that I've never seen before tonight 
It's easy to tell there is wind in my sail 
And I'm alright, yeah I'm just fine.
