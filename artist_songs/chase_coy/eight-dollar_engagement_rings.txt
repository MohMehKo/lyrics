We met more than two years back
It's frightening how time can go by so fast
that you don't even notice when it's gone
There's something about Ohio that I can't help but love
But sometimes the highway miles seem so long

So don't cry, darling, I'll be there in the morning
but you know, that the worse part is always heading home

We spent so much time apart
I know, sometimes it's hard
but girl, but if there's one thing I'm sure of, it is us
besides, we have the small things
like eight-dollar engagement rings
to keep us sane 'till you get on that bus

So don't cry, darling, you'll be in the morning
but you know, that the worse part is always heading home

One day we'll start our new life behind the glow of the pale city lights
in an apartment of our own
it will be so perfect and we'll both know that it was worth the wait
I can hardly wait for that day to come

So don't cry, darling, cause one day every morning we'll both know
that the best part is always heading home
