Everytime I see your smile 
It makes my heart beat fast
And though it's much too soon to tell
I'm hoping this will last

Cuz I just always wanna have you right here by my side
The future's near but never certain
At least stay here for just tonight

I musta done something right 
To deserve you in my life
I musta done something right 
Along the way

I just can't get you off my mind
And why would I even try? 
Cuz even when I close my eyes
I dream about you all the time

I just always wanna have you right here by my side. 
The future's near but never certain 
So please stay here for just tonight. 

I musta done something right 
To deserve you in my life
I musta done something right 
Along the way

And even if the moon fell down tonight
There'd be nothing to worry about at all
Because you make the whole world shine
As long as you're here everything will be alright

I musta done something right 
To deserve you in my life
I musta done something right 
Along the way
