She gave up on love at 18 years old
Said it was just a lie that the foolish told
And finding herself alone and cold
She gave up on the world

She lit up a smoke every day or two
Till eventually she lost count of how many packs she'd gone through
She thought that she had nothing left to lose
She gave up on the world

She hasn't been home now in several days
Tonight makes the third week straight
He's been struggling to sleep since he ran away
He hopes that she finds the strength that she's been looking for
Cause he just can't take the searching anymore

She found some relief with a bottle in her hand
But the bottle can be such a fickle friend
She swore a million times she'd never drink again
She gave up on the world

She hasn't been home now in several days
Tonight makes the third week straight
He's been struggling to sleep since he ran away
He hopes that she finds the strength that she's been looking for
Cause he just can't take the searching anymore
