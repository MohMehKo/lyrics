did you know you have a special way of turning around my terrible days?
you make all the bad things go away.
the second that you say hello.

it's the way that you talk, that you laugh, that you smile.
if beauty was inches, you'd go on for miles.
it's the way that you make everything seem worth while.
the second that you say hello.

it's the way every love song reminds me of you.
along with the stars and the sunset here, too.
it's the way that you make the sky seem much more blue.
the second that you say hello.

so, if love is a drug, then i guess ii'm addicted.
all i want is to have yours; it's making my heart sick.
goodbye is what broke it, and you were what fixed it.
the second that you said hello.
