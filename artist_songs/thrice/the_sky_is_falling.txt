It's coming down, it's coming down, it's coming down
These clouds could never hope to save us
From such a juggernaut of weight
We all dance a jingo cabaret
It's coming down, it's coming down
There're shadows forming on the pavement
We face a watershed of hate;
We're just miles apart but worlds away
We're just miles apart but worlds away

The sky is falling
And no one will lift their eyes to see
The sky is falling
And no one will care as long as it lands overseas

It's coming down, it's coming down, it's coming down
This roof could never hope to save me
And my family from certain death;
If we could leave we would have left
It's coming down, it's coming down
My little girl is just a baby,
And I'm scared that she won't make her teens
But my fear just fuels the hate machine
My fear just fuels the hate machine

The sky is falling
And no one will lift their eyes to see
The sky is falling
And no one will care as long as it lands overseas

I want to be strong enough,
To not let my fears decide my fate
Surrounded by jingoists;
I don't want any part of this

I want to be strong enough,
To not let my terror turn to hate
Surrounded by jingoists;
I don't want any part of this

I want to be strong enough
To not let my fear decide my fate
Surrounded by jingoists;
I don't want any part of this

I want to be strong enough,
To not let my terror turn to hate
Surrounded by jingoists;
I don't want any part of this
