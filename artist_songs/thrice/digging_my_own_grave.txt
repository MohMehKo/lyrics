It's not what you think
Just one more little bet
Just another cigarette
Just one more drink

So lend me just a little more
You know cancer can't catch me
Let's have another drink or three
Don't be a bore

But oh, don't I know
I'm just digging my own grave
Someone else please save myself from me
And oh, lord I know
I'm just digging my own grave
Can someone save myself from me?

I look, I don't touch
It's really no big deal
I'll quit it when I feel I've seen enough
Oh, don't call it an affair
It's just a little fling
She doesn't mean a thing to me, I swear

But oh, don't I know
I'm just digging my own grave
Someone else please save myself from me
And oh, lord I know
I'm just digging my own grave
Someone save myself from me
