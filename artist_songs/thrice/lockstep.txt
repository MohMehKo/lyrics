When i think of you my friend
cant keep a smile from my face
i know it sounds cliche
i love you more than you'll ever know
sometimes i sit and think of all the times you made me laugh and all the good times that we've had
i cherished everyone
through the thick and thin
we've walked in lockstep.

i wont let distance come between all the years that wear away
and the friendship that we built
and though it may sound trivial to some but not to me
every night i thank the Lord for you
how we bumped in
