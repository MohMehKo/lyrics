call everyone to arms
we'll fill the heavens 
with the poisoned dreams of man
call everyone to arms
we forged these weapons 
with the strength of our own hands 

we shot the sun from the sky
apollo dead at our feet
we wander lost in the rye
we gather round in the street

for centuries we watched the sky
and burned to bridge the great divide

call everyone to arms
we'll fill the heavens 
with the poisoned dreams of man
call everyone to arms
we built these weapons 
with our pride and with the strength of our own hands

eclipse the body with stones
and lay him down with the rest
i smile when i am alone
and shed a tear for the press

for centuries we watched the sky
and burned to bridge the great divide 
cause we dug the body up
we drank his golden blood
and light shone from our eyes
but it was not enough
'cause we still dream of deicide

for centuries we watched the sky
we burned to bridge the great divide
but now we burn with power and pride
