You were a silhouette, a shivering shadow in the mingled ash and snow
I took your fevered hands - felt like embers of the world's dying glow
And you were feather light as I carried you quietly through the crumbling streets
And in the fading light I could see in your eyes that somehow we were meant to meet

Would you stay with me
If you thought the war was over
And everything made right?
Would you still believe in us
Or would your love for me grow colder
With no one left to fight?

Would you stay with me?
Would you stay with me?

After the fever left, together we'd scavenge through the city and her scars
And when the day would end, bar the door against the demons and the dark
We'd share a can of something and the bottle of bourbon I had hid away
It'd warm me from within, and you from without till I'd forget the chill and grey

Would you stay with me
If you thought the war was over
And everything made right?
Would you still believe in us
Or would your love for me grow colder
With no one left to fight?

Would you stay with me?
Would you stay with me?

Oh, it seems like every night
I lie in bed and worry that the world will start to heal
And now I'm terrified
That if it did you'd start to ask if what we have is real

Would you stay with me
If you thought the war was over
And everything made right?
Would you still believe in us
Or would your love for me grow colder
With no one left to fight?

Would you stay with me?
Would you stay with me?
