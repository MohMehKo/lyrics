What's the use in hoping
when you always get let down
what's the use in smiling
when all you wanna do is frown
I'm drowning, in a sea of hate-filled eyes
and she's screaming
but no one hears her cries

Is anybody hear to see a band?
Did anybody come to hear a song?
Does anyone believe in magic?
Is anybody here to sing along?

People shove me down 
they're coming from all sides
and as I look around
something just don't seem right
I feel so all alone
though the people inundate
I see no joy or desperation
only senseless hate

Is anybody hear to see a band?
Did anybody come to hear a song?
Does anyone believe in magic?
Is anybody here to sing along?

Is this the same scene (same scene)
that I used to think I loved
or was I just naive (naive)
and were they always out for blood
I've seen better days (better days)
but I know that we can make a change
I've seen better days but we can change!

I've seen better days (he's had better days) [x6]
we can make a change
