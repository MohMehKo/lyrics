I feel like I've been locked up tight
for a century of lonely nights baby,baby,baby
licking your lips and blowing kisses my way
But that don't mean I'm gonna give it away
baby,baby,baby

whoa my body is saying let's go!
whoa but my heart is saying no!

If you wanna be with me
Baby there's a price to pay
I'm a genie in a bottle
You gotta rub me the right way!
If you wanna be with me
I can make your wish come true
You gotta make a big impression
I gotta like what you do

I'm a genie in a bottle baby
You Gotta rub me the right way honey
I'm a genie in a bottle baby:
The music's fading
The lights down low
Just one more dance
And then were good to go baby,baby,baby
Hormones racing at the speed of light
But that don't mean it's gotta be tonight
Baby, baby, baby

whoa my body is saying let's go!
whoa but my heart is saying no!

If you wanna be with me
Baby there's a price to pay
I'm a genie in a bottle
You gotta rub me the right way!
If you wanna be with me
I can make your dream come true
gotta make a big impression gotta like what you do!

I'm a genie in a bottle baby
You Gotta rub me the right way honey
I'm a genie in a bottle baby
Come, come, come on and let me out
whoa !You Gotta rub me the right way honey
whoa !I'm a genie in a bottle baby
Come, come, come on and let me out

If you wanna be with me
Baby there's a price to pay
I'm a genie in a bottle
You gotta rub me the right way!
If you wanna be with me
I can make your dream come true
You gotta make a big impression
I gotta like what you do!

I'm a genie in a bottle baby
you gotta rub me the right way honey
I'm a genie in a bottle baby
Come, come, come, on and let me out
