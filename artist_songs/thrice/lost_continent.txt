Was there a time that we know peace;
when all the children had a place to sleep
when rhetoric was not enough?

Was there a time we weren't at war
When we knew what our hearts and hands were for?
I don't believe there ever was.

It's always been a lie, 
a soothing lullaby
We'll soon be swallowed by the sea

Was there a time we looked around, 
and do we really even want to know what's going down
Well I think no one really does

We'd rather close our eyes
sing soothing lullabies
We'll soon be swallowed by the sea

The water's rising now
and we will surely drown
if we don't turn around
