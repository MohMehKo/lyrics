Those flowers I found you 
Were the truest red that I'd ever seen
Till you cut yourself on their thorns
You winced and I kissed you, 
And I kissed your palms and we both laughed
So unaware of the gathering storm

It's gonna rain, it's gonna rain, till the levee breaks
A tidal wave of fear and pain carries us away
Another fight into the night until nothing else remains
How do we find harbor from the hurricane?

Now sheltered in shadows,
The quiet song of your breath stirs the dark
Your skin like a rose 'neath my hand
And I can't keep from wondering 
Why nothing good could ever stay
Why faith feels like a fistful of sand

It's gonna rain, it's gonna rain, till the levee breaks
A tidal wave of fear and pain carries us away
Another fight into the night until nothing else remains
How do we find harbor from the hurricane?
