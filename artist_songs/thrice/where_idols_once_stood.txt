our idols lay in ruins
we'd have saved them if we could
but we still choose to worship
the places where our idols stood.

still believing
they can save us,
I've lived this way too long to turn back now

Presuppositions set in stone
this coffin sealed by my own pride,
and though it seems the sun will shine,
ill draw the shades and stay inside.

if we've learned anything at all,
its that the ghosts of idols will do just as well
we all see what we want to anyway [screams:] anyway

some things
are better left unsaid.
you know what's at stake
something's are better left unsaid
as long as we keep it
in textbooks, then well be untouchable, untouchable
we hate to lie to children,
but after all its all
for their own good.
