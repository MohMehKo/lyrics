I was always one of the righteous
Never lived outside of the lines
Kept a close watch on the white wash
Disguising the dead bones inside

I was always one the good ones
Keeping tabs on everyone else

Sure that I was 
One of the chosen
But I was a child of hell

But you buried me in the bright light
Yeah, you held my eyes to the sun till I could see that,
That I was worse than I ever feared I could be
But somehow, I was loved more than I ever dared to believe 
Because of you

I was always one of the blameless
Or at least that's what I believed
I never thought I could have been blinded
Until I could no longer see 

But you buried me in the bright light
Yeah, you held my eyes to the sun till I could see,
That I was worse than I ever feared I could be
But somehow, I was loved more than I ever dared to believe 
Because of you
