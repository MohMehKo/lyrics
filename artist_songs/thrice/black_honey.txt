I keep swinging my hand through a swarm of bees ‘cause I ...
I want honey on my table
I keep swinging my hand through a swarm of bees ‘cause I ...
I want honey on my table

But I never get it right 
no I never get it right

I keep swinging my hand through a swarm of bees
I can’t understand why they’re stinging me
But I’ll do what I want, I’ll do what I please
I’ll do it again till I got what I need

I’ll rip and smash through the hornet’s nest
Don’t they understand I deserve the best
And I’ll do what I want, I’ll do what I please
I’ll do it again till I got what I need

I tried to stick this pin through a butterfly ‘cause I ...
I like all the pretty colors
But it just fell apart so I flung it in the fire 
to burn with all the others

Cause I never get it right
No, I never get it right

I keep swinging my hand through a swarm of bees
I can’t understand why they’re stinging me
But I’ll do what I want, I’ll do what I please
I’ll do it again till I got what I need

I’ll rip and smash through the hornet’s nest
Don’t they understand I deserve the best
And I’ll do what I want, I’ll do what I please
I’ll do it again till I got what I need

And this time I’ll get it right 
yeah this time I’ll get it right
It’s gonna be this time I’ll get it right 
Oh God let it be this time I get it right

So I’m cutting that branch off the cherry tree
I’m singing this will be my victory then I...
I see them coming after me

And they’re following me across the sea
And now they’re stinging my friends and my family and I...
I don’t know why this is happening

But I’ll do what I want, I’ll do what I please
I’ll do it again till I got what I need

I keep swinging my hand through a swarm of bees ‘cause I ...
I want honey on my table
