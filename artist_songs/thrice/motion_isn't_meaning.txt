What a beautiful way to fake it
A sort of graceful defeat
We pound a pattern out on the pavement
We sound the siren out through the streets
Advance with perfect nonchalance
To the staccato of the rifle report
Don't marvel at our confidence
It's just bravado that a blindfold affords

You tell me that you wanna stop the war
But baby you can't dance if there's no floor
Motion isn't meaning
It's just another drug
But it's all we've got...

What a way to keep it together
A black box, a prescription for speed
We found a freeway that goes on forever
We drown the demon in the deep black sea

Shield your eyes
Keep running to the rhythm of the rifle repeating
Paralyzed
But I gotta keep movin' if I wanna keep breathing

You tell me that you wanna stop the war
But baby you can't dance if there's no floor
Motion isn't meaning
It's just another drug
But it's all we've got... we've got nowhere to go

I'll take the knife or the easy chair
We are but gods for a moment
I'll take the knife or the easy chair
We are but gods!
