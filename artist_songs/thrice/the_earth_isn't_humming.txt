I hear these times are the end. And another one must fall down. 
I don't think I believe it. When another one must fall down. 
Give us the distance. And another one will fall down. 

The sun in the open sky. Fall down. 
Stare back into my own eyes. Fall down. 
A stranger in my own skin. Fall down. 

One decade later. And another one must fall down. 
The earth isn't humming. I watched them all fall down. 
Fell into the sound in front of me. Unchanged by those around. 
Directionless. An open sea. We'll watch as time tumbles down.

The sun in the open sky. Fall down. Fall down.
Stare back into my own eyes. Fall down. Fall down.

Fall down. [x8]
