You were built for blessing but you only make them bleed, but you don’t care, you don’t care.
And bruises are but shadows of the blackness that you breathe but you don’t care, you don’t care.
The light that's left inside their eyes is darkened day by day but you don’t care, you don’t care.
The presence pulls the color from the world til all is grey
but you don’t care, you don’t, you don’t, you don’t.

You're less than half a man, yellow belly and crimson hands
You will one day reap your reckoning, maybe then you’ll understand.

Your hands are made to comfort but they only conjure fear
But you don’t care, you don’t care.
She’s in the closet praying Lord please get me out of here
you don’t care, you don’t you don’t you don’t.

You're less than half a man, yellow belly and crimson hands
You will one day reap your reckoning, maybe then you’ll understand.

What mercy have they known, from you, from you.
To ask that I be shown, to you, to you.
