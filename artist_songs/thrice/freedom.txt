no time for anything at all
no time to reason or question direction
but I won't let myself fall
I'll just keep pushing 'til the end

I hope that I will find my way (find a way) [x2]
when it's all been said and done
I really think you'll miss it once it's gone

as time passes I get scared
where will I end up and will it be good enough
will it work itself out
or will I be stuck here once again

I hope that I will find my way (find a way) [x2]
when it's all been said and done
I really think you'll miss it once it's gone

I'll keep my eyes open wide
and try not to blink
it's just a matter of knowing where to look
cause sometimes things fall apart,
my walls crumble on me,
but I'll keep trying, and trying,
and fighting until I am free

I hope that I will find my way (find a way) [x2]
when it's all been said and done
I really think you'll miss it once it's gone
