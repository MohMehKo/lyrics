The weight of the world is on my shoulders
And it's just too much to bear.
It's not that I'm growing callous,
I'm just too tired to care.

So drop your expectations,
Let go of any dependencies,
Forget your disapproval
'Cause I'm setting myself free.

Looking up to me,
Looking down on me,
And hazarding those sidelong glances.
I'm not too sure of what they see.
All I know is their views are slanted.

So drop your expectations,
Let go of any dependencies,
Forget your disapproval
'Cause I'm setting myself free.

(All eyes on me.)
I can't take the pressure.
(All eyes on me.)
Breathe without making a sound.
(All eyes on me.)
Don't expect perfection
(All eyes on me.)
'Cause I won't fail to let you down.
(All eyes on me.)
I can't take the pressure.
(All eyes on me.)
Breathe without making a sound.
(All eyes on me.)
Don't expect perfection
(All eyes on me.)
'Cause I won't fail to let you down.
I won't fail to let you down.
I won't fail to let you down.
