Only now that you have taught me
(but how late) my lack
I see the chasm
and everything you are was making
my heart into a bridge
by which I might get back
from exile and grow man
and now the bridge is breaking

for this I bless you as the ruin falls

the pain you bring
far greater than all other gain
