It's my life!
you set the bar too high
your expectations have become my failure
a shell you see so shallow but deep inside (deep inside)
my heart beats just the same as yours
the same blood through these clean veins
can't you see that I'm in pain
it seems my life is always under par

what can I say to change your mind about what I am
others can see what was hidden from your sight
a kid with courage and heart and his eyes open wide
an inner beauty and a bright light

my focus is not yours
I set my sights on new horizons and let my soul have scope
can't you see that I have my own dreams (my own dreams)
and though they're not the same as yours
they hold value to me, tell me why can't you see
I'm not the means to mend your past regrets

what can I say to change your mind about what I am
others can see what was hidden from your sight
a kid with courage and heart and his eyes open wide
an inner beauty and a bright light

judged for how I look, not for the good that I have done
I try the best I can, but it seems that I'm not the perfect son
shaped by God, and my volition
and the seeds that you have sown
but I ask you once again
when does my life become my own?

I have my own!...
Let's go!
My own...

what can I say to change your mind about what I am
others can see what was hidden from your sight
a kid with courage and heart and his eyes open wide
an inner beauty and a bright light
