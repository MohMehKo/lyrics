In this dark night we stand or fall
We are kings now, or nothing at all
Check your armor; Light up your torch
Touch the flame to the sail before you head for shore.

And we will burn the fleet,
We can never go home;
It's on to victory or under ground.
Burn the fleet, we'll be heroes or ghosts
But we won't be turned around.

The old flag will burn with the sail
And a new one won't fly if we fail.
But the fire continues to rise,
And it shows not a hint of any fear in our eyes.

Burn the fleet, we can never go home;
It's on to victory or under ground
Burn the fleet, we'll be heroes or ghosts
But we won't be turned around.
