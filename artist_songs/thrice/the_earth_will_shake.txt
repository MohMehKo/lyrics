we dream of ways to break these iron bars
we dream of black nights without moon or stars
we dream of tunnels and of sleeping guards
we dream of blackouts in the prison yard

heartbroken, we found 
(a gleam of hope)
harken to the sound, 
(a whistle blows)
heaven sent reply, 
(however small)
evidence of life
(beyond these walls)
born and bred 
(in this machine)
wardens dread 
(to see us dream)
we hold tight 
(to legends of)
real life, 
(the way it was before)

we dream of jailers throwing down their arms
we dream of open gates and no alarms

we dream of ways to break these iron bars
we dream of black nights without moon or stars

heartbroken, we found 
(a gleam of hope)
harken to the sound, 
(a whistle blows)
heaven sent reply, 
(however small)
evidence of life
(beyond these walls)
born and bred 
(in this machine)
wardens dread 
(to see us dream)
we hold tight 
(to legends of)
real life, 
(the way it was before)

look to the day the earth will shake
these weathered walls will fall away
