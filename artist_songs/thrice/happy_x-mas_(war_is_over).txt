So this is Christmas
What have you done
Another year over 
And a new one just begun

So this is Christmas
Hope you have fun
The near and the dear one
The old and the young

A very merry Christmas
A happy new year
Let's hope it's a good one
Without any fear

So this is Christmas
For weak and for strong
For rich and the poor ones
The world is so wrong

So happy Christmas
For black and for white
For yellow and red ones
Let's stop all the fight

A very merry Christmas
A happy new year
Let's hope it's a good one
Without any fear

So this is Christmas
What have we done
Another year over
A new one just begun

So this is Christmas
Hope you have fun
The near and the dear ones
The old and the young

A very merry Christmas
A happy new year
Let's hope it's a good one
Without any fear

War is over 
If you want it
War is over
Now
