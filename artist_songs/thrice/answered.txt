All that I have are questions;
So much is veiled in mystery.
You are yourself the answer-
The only answer that I need.

My brokenness (I must confess)
Darkens all my thoughts, and hides your hands.
But questions fade before your face,
And I'm contend that I may never understand.

All that I have are questions;
So much is veiled in mystery.
You are yourself the answer-
The only answer that I need.

Of what I spoke I did not know-
Of things too wonderful and high for me.
In ignorance I gave offense;
I had heard of you but now my eyes have seen. 

All that I have are questions;
So much is veiled in mystery.
You are yourself the answer-
The only answer that I need.

You're all I need
You're all I need
You're all I need
All I need
