TO WHAT END!

To what end do we
proceed so boldly
if all we are is
chemical reactions
and what world have you
so deftly sold me
if you reduce me
if I have no soul to touch

no heart to love
no evil to rise up above
no angels and no ghosts
no real victories to toast
if you believe that this is true
then I must ask
to what end do you proceed?

NO FIRE IN OUR EYES
NO STEEL IN OUR HEARTS
NO MAGIC IN OUR SONGS
ARE WE JUST EMPTY VESSELS

No fire in our eyes
No steel in our hearts
No magic in our songs
[x2]

and you tell me...
I have no soul to touch
no heart to love
no evil to rise up above
no angels and no ghosts
no real victories to toast
if you believe that this is true
then I must ask
to what end do you proceed?

Did I not feel your love?
Did I not feel your hate?
And did my heart not beat
and did MY HEART NOT BREAK?!
And are these tears for naught
and are these worlds in vain
if this is all we are then what
HAVE WE TO GAIN!
What of all the art and books
music and poetry
What of all our memories
What of OUR HOPES AND DREAMS!
They hold no value then
We hold no faith but greed
So I must ask you
to what end do we proceed?
