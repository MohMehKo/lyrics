I hear the waves crash far below,
the rocks are leaping for the sky,
they're starving for the air,
for a bone to break, a dream to smash apart,
but I don't care.

It looks deep enough from here, I'm diving
this cliff has been well worn by ignorance.
It looks deep enough from here, I'm diving
they float face down they all look so content.

I don't know why I'm even here.
Guess I'm afraid to be alone.
And down below I see my crew they look okay
that can't be blood the water here
is far too blue

and gravity
seems far away
but I can hear her call my name
it's so comforting to know I'll never have to think again

It looks deep enough from here, I'm diving
this cliff has been well worn by ignorance.
It looks deep enough from here, I'm diving
we float face down, and don't we look content?
It looks deep enough from here, I'm diving
this cliff has been well worn by ignorance.
It looks deep enough from here, I'm diving
we float face down, and don't we all look so content?
It looks deep enough from here
It looks deep enough from here
