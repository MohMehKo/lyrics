Mark me with Fear and Trembling
Send someone else instead
I know my world is ending
I can't repay my debt

Can I carry such a heavy burden?
Can I move when I am paralyzed?
I see a fire behind a heavy curtain
I lean in closer and I close my eyes

Kiss the coals; breathe in smoke
And I say, "Here I am, send me."
Lifts my soul, free and so unafraid
"Here I am, send me, send me."
Free and so unafraid
"Here I am, send me."

Mark me with fire and send me
Among the living dead
They cannot comprehend me;
I watch the sickness spread

How can they hear me when their hearts are hardened?
How can they see me when they close their eyes?
So they can tell that I'm an easy target
A wooden saw is quite a way to die

Kiss the coals; breathe in smoke
And I say, "Here I am, send me."
Lifts my soul, free and so unafraid
"Here I am, send me, send me."
Free and so unafraid
"Here I am, send me."

"Here I am, send me."
