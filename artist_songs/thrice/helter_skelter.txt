When I get to the bottom
I go back to the top of the slide
Where I stop and turn and I go for a ride
Then I get to the bottom and I see you again

Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

Do you, don't you want me to love you?
I'm coming down fast, but I'm miles above you
Tell me, tell me, tell me, come on, tell me the answer
You may be a lover, but you ain't no dancer

Helter skelter
Helter skelter
Helter skelter

Do you, don't you want me to make you?
I'm coming down fast but don't let me break you
Oh, now tell me, tell me, tell me the answer
You may be a lover, but you ain't no dancer

Helter skelter
Helter skelter
Helter skelter

Look out!

Oh, helter skelter
Helter skelter
Helter skelter

She's coming down!
Oh, look out, she's coming down!
