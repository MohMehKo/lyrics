All that I've known's within the walls of this room where there's a window
Roughly boarded up
It's true the gaps are patched but even through the tiny cracks, I feel a wind blow
I see a light of strangest hue

There's nothing I can say
There's no way I can prove
That there's a place
Beyond this room
But still, there's something in the way
The light comes shining through
And in the way
The curtains move

Late in the night I lay awake
With my eyes fixed on the window
I strained my ears until I thought
That I might have heard a song
Somehow hiding in the soft glow
Old as time and ever new

There's nothing I can say
There's no way I can prove
That there's a place
Beyond this room
But still, there's something in the way
The light comes shining through
And in the way
The curtains move

I found a note scratched in the wall
In a pained and earnest scrawl
The hand I recognized was somehow mine
I read each line with dread
There's no wind and there's no light
There's no song you hear at night
There's nowhere to hide, be terrified
It's all inside your head

But still, there's something in the way
The light comes shining through
And in the way
In the way the curtains move
