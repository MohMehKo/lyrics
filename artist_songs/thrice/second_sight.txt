Let's go!

How many times have I sit when I should stand?
How many times have my dreams been just beyond my hand?
How many times have I compromised?
How many times have I told myself these lies?

How many? How many?
How many? How many?

How many times will I walk the beaten path?
How many times will I end up dead last?
How many times will I watch it pass me by?
How many times will I bury what's inside?

Well I know someday
I will find the means
and I will find the time
and I will find a way
to realize my dreams and leave it all behind
