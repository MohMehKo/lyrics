I've just seen a face
I can't forget the time or place
That we'd just met, she's just the girl for me
And I want all the world to see we've met
Na na na na na na

Had it been another day
I might have looked the other way
But I had never been aware
And as it is I dream of her tonight
Na na na na na na

Falling, yes I am falling
Calling she calling me back again

I have never known
The likes of this, I've been alone
And I have missed things and stayed out of sight
But other girls were never quite like this
Na na na na na na

Falling, yes I am falling
Calling she calling me back again
