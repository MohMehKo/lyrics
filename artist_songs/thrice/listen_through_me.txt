See these ragged shoes?
The soles are worn straight through
Well I proclaimed
The king has sang the blues
If you've got better news
Then make it play

He laid aside his crown
All our crimes he carried
Was lifted from the ground
With our burdens buried

Listen to me
Though I speak of sober things
Listen through me
Though we're men of lips unclean
I speak truly
What you only think you've heard everything
Everything
Everything hangs on a word

Sparing no expense
He made recompense 
For all the earth
The story's an offense
So get down from that fence
And bless or curse

He laid aside his crown
All our crimes he carried
Was lifted from the ground
With our burdens buried
The shadows all had flown
In the light diminished
He emptied out his lungs
Crying it is finished

Listen to me
Though I speak of sober things
Listen through me
Though we're men of lips unclean
I speak truly
What you only think you've heard everything
Everything
Everything hangs on a word

A word...

The shadows all had flown
In the light diminished
He emptied out his lungs
Crying it is finished

Listen to me
Though I speak of sober things
Listen through me
Though we're men of lips unclean
I speak truly
What you only think you've heard everything
Everything
Everything hangs on a word
