You see me and you laugh out loud
You taunt me from safe inside your crowd
My looks, they must threaten you
To make you act the way you do

RED, I'M SEEING RED
I'M SEEING RED
I'M SEEING RED
I'M SEEING RED
I'M SEEING RED

You see me and you think I'm a jerk
First impressions without a word
You can't believe your eyes at first
But now you know you've seen the worst

RED, I'M SEEING RED
I'M SEEING RED
I'M SEEING RED
I'M SEEING RED
I'M SEEING RED

RED, I'M SEEING RED
I'M SEEING RED
I'M SEEING RED
I'M SEEING RED
I'M SEEING RED

---

I'm gonna knock it down
Any way that I can
I'm gonna scream, I'm gonna shout
I don't want to have to use my hands

IT'S LIKE SCREAMING AT A WALL
LIKE SCREAMING AT A WALL
LIKE SCREAMING AT A WALL
LIKE SCREAMING AT A WALL
SOMEDAY IT'S GONNA FALL

You built that wall up around you
And now you can't see out
And you can't hear my words
No matter how loud I shout

IT'S LIKE SCREAMING AT A WALL
IT'S LIKE SCREAMING AT A WALL
IT'S LIKE SCREAMING AT A WALL
IT'S LIKE SCREAMING AT A WALL
SOMEDAY IT'S GONNA FALL

You're safe inside and you know it
'Cause I can't get to you
And you know I resent it
And my temper grows

You better reinforce those walls
Until you don't have no room to stand
'Cause someday the bricks are gonna fall
Someday I'm gonna use my hands
