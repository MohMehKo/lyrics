I let down my gaurd
And let you see me
I showed you my heart
And now I'm sorry
Head first into you
I fell in too deep
Not much I could do
But watch you leave me

I've tried
But I can't
Guess I don't understand
The meaning of letting you go

[Chorus]
I'm a heart with no beat
Fading fast by the hour
Flailing in circles
I struggle to breathe
Butterfly with no wings
A fragile wilting flower
Baby without you
I'm a fish out of water

Thought you were the one
I was dreaming (dreaming)
What I thought was love
Just left me empty (empty)
No turning back time
No more pretending
No rainbow inside
No happy ending

Though I try
I'm confused
With a star without you
My world has been turned upside down

[Chorus]
I'm a heart with no beat
Fading fast by the hour
Flailing in circles
I struggle to breathe
Butterfly with no wings
A fragile wilting flower
Baby without you
I'm a fish out of water

I've surrendered to the unconscious
You are haze the that grips my mind
I opened the flower gates
It hurts in slow motion
Baby I'm running out of time

And I've tried
(Uh-uh)

[Chorus 2x]
I'm a heart with no beat
Fading fast by the hour
Flailing in circles
I struggle to breathe
Butterfly with no wings
A fragile wilting flower
Baby without you
I'm a fish out of water
