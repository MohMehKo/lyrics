[Chris:]
I've got chills,
They're multiplying.
And I'm losing self-control.
'Cuz the power your supplying,
Its electrifying.

[Nikki:]
You better shape up,
'Cuz you're the only one,
And my heart is set on you
You better shape up,
You better understand,
To my heart I must be true.

[Chris:]
(nothing left, nothing left for me to do)

[Both:]
You're the one that I want.
(You are the one i want)
Oh, Oh, Ooh. Honey.
The one that I want.
(You are the one i want want)
Oh, Oh, Ooh. Honey.
The one that I want
(You are the one i want want)
Oh, Oh, Ooh.
The one I need.
Oh, yes indeed.

[Chris:]
Oh, yeah yeah yeah

[Nikki:]
If you're filled with affection,
You're to shy to convey,
Betta take my direction.
(feel your way)

[Chris:]
(I'll feel my  way)

[Nikki:]
You better shape up,
'Cuz you're the only one,
(The only one)
That I want here by my side.

[Chris:]
I'd better shape up,
If I'm gonna show,
That my faith is justified.

[Chris:]
Are you sure?
Both:
Yes, I'm sure down deep inside.

[Both:]
You're the one that I want.
(You are the one i want)
Oh, Oh, Ooh. Honey.
The one that I want.
(You are the one i want want)
Oh, Oh, Ooh. Honey.
The one that I want
(You are the one i want want)
Oh, Oh, Ooh.
The one I need.
Oh, yes indeed.

I've got chills they're multiplying.
(You're the one I want)
'Cuz the power you're supplying.
(You're the one, baby)
If you're filled with affection ,
(You're the one I want)
Betta take  my direction.
(You're the one, baby)

[Both:]
You're the one that I want.
(Are you the one for me?)
Oh, Oh, Ooh. Honey.
The one that I want.
(You are the one I want want)
Oh, Oh, Ooh. Honey.
The one that I want
(You are the one I want want),
Oh, Oh, Ooh.
