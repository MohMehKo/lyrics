You're irresistible
I know I should have said goodbye
I know I should have looked away this time
And I know that we're the best of friends
And you don't know what I am hiding
Underneath this smile
I'm dying
Whenever you leave

[Chorus]
You're irresistible
I think you know
That you're so missable
Every time you go
You're lips are kissable
I know you know 
You're irresistible
That's why I can't say no

You're looking into my eyes
And I'm trying to disguise all of my thoughts
But every time that you're around
Each and every time I fall apart
So hard to listen to my mind 
Now my heart is so hard
It tears me apart

[Chorus]
You're irresistible
I think you know
That you're so missable
Every time you go
You're lips are kissable
I know you know 
You're irresistible
That's why I can't say no

I can't say no
I can't say no
You're irresistible
And (Oooh)
There's something about the way I wanna
Hold onto to you
(You-you-you)
And I know
That if I had my way baby
I'd stay and never let go
I'd never let go

[Chorus]
You're irresistible
I think you know
That you're so missable
Every time you go
You're lips are kissable
I know you know 
You're irresistible
That's why I can't say no

You're irresistible
Baby you know
Baby you know
That you're so missable
Every time you go
(Don't go no where)
You're lips are kissable
I know you know 
You're irresistible
That's why I can't say no

I can't say no
I can't say no
I can't say no
You're irresistable
Baby you know
Every time you go
Every time you go
You're irresistible 
You're irresistible
