Ah...ah...ah..
Ah...ah...ah..

Saw you yesterday
We were talking
Comparing notes
What's happeneing
What's not 
What you wanted
What you got

Now you're on your way 
It's all about that
And nothing else
I feel like I'm small
And I don't matter in that world
If I try to tell you would you laugh in my face
Tell me to grow up when I come clean and say

[Chorus]
I miss you
The way we used to be
Back when you calling me
Everyday (Yeah)
You wanted to come over
I miss you
But it's different and it's stange
Now that everything's changed
And it scares me 'cause it's weird that you don't notice
I miss you
I....I....I.....
Yes I do (yeah)
I....I....I.....

Maybe it's just me
But I don't think so
I'm not insecure 
I just know
What's real
What is gone and what I feel

I remember when we used to say that 
We'd never change 
Forget where we've been
I wanna go there again

If I tried to tell you
You'd turn into that kind
Wouls you put up your defense 
Say I was loosing my mind

[Chorus]
I miss you
The way we used to be
Back when you calling me
Everyday (Yeah)
You wanted to get closer
I miss you
But it's different and it's stange
Now that everything's changed
And it scares me 'cause it's weird that you don't notice

Don't you ever see my face outside your window
Are you up so high you can't get back around
Will you think of me some night when you get lonely
Will you need me
When you're on your way down

(Ooh)
Saw you yesterday
We were talking
Comparing notes
What's happeneing
What's not 
What you wanted
What you got

[Chorus (repeated)]
I miss you
The way we used to be
Back when you calling me
Everyday (Yeah)
You wanted to come over
I miss you
But it's different and it's stange
Now that everything's changed
And it scares me 'cause it's weird that you don't notice
I miss you
The way we used to be
Back when you calling me
Everyday (Yeah)
You wanted to get closer
I miss you
But it's different and it's stange
Nothing stays the same
And it scares me 'cause it's weird that you don't notice
I miss you
I....I....I.....
I miss you
I....I....I.....
Yes I do
I....I....I.....
I miss you
