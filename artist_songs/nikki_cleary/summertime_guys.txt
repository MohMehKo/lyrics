Summer's comin' 
There're gonna drive us crazy
Let's go!
Oh yeah

When I saw him diving, 
Diving deep into the deep end
I just had to ask my girlfriend 
Who he was
She said I don't know his name
But, he's been sweating you all day
So maybe you should dive in 
With him, girl because

Summer's here, the radio is playin' 
All the songs we know
There're gonna drive us crazy
Ready set go!

Summertime guys
School is out, the sun is shinin'
Summertime guys
I think I wanna make him mine
Nothin' like the feelin' 
That you get inside
Look him in the eyes
Summertime guys

Saw him at the movies
Yeah, he said he thought he knew me
From the mall or maybe school, 
And he was hot
Said there was a party
On the beach at seven-thirty
Would I like to meet him there?
I said "Why not?"

I call my girls on the phone
Said there's a party goin' on
It's time to light this rocket
Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one!
