When will i begin to forget the way you used to smile
And make the world make sence 
Laying in your arms used to be the 
Place where i felt heaven holding on to me
What i wouldnt give to be there right now
I cant seem to shake watching my heart walk out

When the sun decides to set in the east 
Thatll be when im over you getting over me
When the steepest mountain falls into the sea
Only then will i be over you getting over me

Emotionless you told me goodbye
And even to this day im really not sure why
I never thought that perfect could end
Mabye my perceptions blinded me again
Words we didnt say are what haunt me now
Happy ever afters the page you ripped out

When the sun decides to set in the east 
Thatll be when im over you getting over me
When the steepest mountain falls into the sea
Only then will i be over you getting over me

Was i guilty of caring too much
Did my constant devotion scare you away
When i close my eyes i dream the same dream
That we stayed in love
And youre holding me

When the sun decides to set in the east 
Thatll be when im over you getting over me
When the steepest mountain falls into the sea
Only then will i be over you getting over me [repeat to fade]
