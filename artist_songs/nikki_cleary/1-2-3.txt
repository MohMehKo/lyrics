(Ohh, yeah!)
Once opon a time
Two, two, hearts felt the same way,
But three, three, three, nights ago
You told me you don't know (which way)
Which way you're gonna go
(ohhhh)
Truth ain't easy but please, please, please me
It's time you made up your mind
(I don't wanna cry, don't wanna be treated like a loser)

[CHORUS]
1,2,3
You're fallin' in love with me
I'm falling into your life
(Your life)
(Faster than the speed of light)
And 1,2,3 you don't wanna hear from me!
But if we can't be like before
Tell me then
(ohh, what love is for.)

So fly just fly away
And don't think I can't take it
Cause you, you, you outta know
That if you let me go
(you'll throw)
You're gonna throw it all away 
(ohhh)
Truth ain't easy but please, please, please me
It's time you made up your mind
(I don't wanna cry don't wanna be treated like a loser)

[CHORUS]

Everything to keep this love alive.
Will we ever
(Will we ever)
Will we ever
(Will we ever)
Get to five
Five

[CHORUS]

1,2,3
You're fallin' in love with me
I'm falling into your life
(Your life)
(Faster than the speed of light)
And 1,2,3 you don't wanna hear from me!
But if we can't be like before
Tell me then
Tell me what love is for

1-2-3

(Tell me now baby.)

1-2-3

1,2,3
You're falling in love with me...

1-2-3
