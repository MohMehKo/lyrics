Hello
Hi
Hey
I heard you weren't going out with us today
Nah I don't feel like it
Oh at least come to the mall
No
Tod's gonna be there
-ugh-

I'm so glad it rained today
Didn't want to get up anyway
I'm gonna watch a downer flick
And eat choclate till i'm sick
Don't call
Don't come over
Don't try and make me laugh

[Chorus:]
I'm feeling sorry for myself
Stay away
This is my day
I'm loving it
I don't want nobodys help
I know what i need
Don't feel sorry for me
I'm feeling sorry for myself

I'm not gonna leave my room
I just might cry all afternoon
Takes a lot of work to feel this bad
It feels so good to feel this sad

Don't call dont come over don't try make me laugh

[Chorus:]
I'm feeling sorry for myself
Stay away
This is my day
I'm loving it
I don't want nobodys help
I know what i need
Don't feel sorry for me
I'm feeling sorry for myself

I don't want to talk about it
I wanna be left alone
It's no big deal
Its how i feel
I've said too much
And thats enough
I'm hanging up
Dont call
Don't come over
Don't try to make me laugh

[Chorus: x2]
I'm feeling sorry for myself
Stay away
This is my day
I'm lovin' it
I don't want nobodys help
I know what i need
Don't feel sorry for me
I'm feeling sorry for myself

I've said too much and thats enough 
I'm hanging up
