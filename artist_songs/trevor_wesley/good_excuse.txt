Baby, you, you blow my mind
I end up, chasing you every time
Mad at myself for running back
(Running back to you baby)
But I can't help it
I want you so bad

Our love is overdue, overdue
I'm trying to get next to you
I try and play like you don't matter
But deep down I gotta have ya
And since your so shy
After all we can blame the alcohol
That's a good excuse
To say I love you
And if we drink this whole bottle
We'll pretend we don't recall
That's a good excuse
To say I love you
To say I love you
To say I love you

We cross paths thinking that we're friends
But never cross that line
I saw your eyes were wondering
It's got me wondering too
So grab your drink
Let's run away
Were we can be alone, oh
I think I just may confess my true feelings
I find you so appealing

Our love is overdue, overdue
I'm trying to get next to you
I try and play like you don't matter
But deep down I gotta have ya
And since your so shy
After all we can blame the alcohol
That's a good excuse
To say I love you
And if we drink this whole bottle
We'll pretend we don't recall
That's a good excuse
To say I love you
To say I love you
To say I love you

Our love is overdue, overdue
I'm trying to get next to you
I try and play like you don't matter
But deep down I gotta have ya
And since your so shy
After all we can blame the alcohol
That's a good excuse
To say I love you
And if we drink this whole bottle
We'll pretend we don't recall
That's a good excuse
To say I love you
To say I love you
