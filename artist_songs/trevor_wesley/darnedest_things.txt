I'll take you on a trip
On a plane or a ship
Somewhere exotic, you ain't never been
Champagne in the sky, let's have a sip
We could wear fedoras
Off the coast of Santorini
Make love in Bali
And have a toast in Fiji

'Cause love makes you do the darnedest things
Ball up and enjoy the finer things
Let's fly across to Montreal
Perhaps Nepal to Paraguay
Love makes you do the darnedest things
Ball up and make 'em man buy rings
Let's have a drink and see the world
Make you my girl in paradise

My hands are on your hips (on your hips)
My eyes are on your lips (on your lips)
In your lingerie (lingerie)
I feel like you deserve a tip
May I call you senora?
Off the coast of Santorini
Make love in Bali
And have a toast in Fiji

'Cause love makes you do the darnedest things
Ball up and enjoy the finest things
Let's fly across to Montreal
Perhaps Nepal to Paraguay
Love makes you do the darnedest things
Ball up and make 'em man buy rings
Let's have a drink and see the world
Make you my girl in paradise

And while were enjoying the finer things
I couldn't get anybody else
But my boy Russell
For a piano solo

'Cause love makes you do the darnedest things
Ball up and enjoy the finest things
Let's fly across to Montreal
Perhaps Nepal to Paraguay
Love makes you do the darnedest things
Ball up and make 'em man buy rings
Let's have a drink and see the world
Make you my girl in paradise
