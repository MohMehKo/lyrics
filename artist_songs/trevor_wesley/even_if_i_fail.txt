She's got stars in her eyes
The way she looks at me
Like summer skies
The clouds are no where to be found
Baby blue is my mood
I'm obsessed with her
I concur that I prefer to pursue her
And be the magic in her world
But I could only dream of it
My chances with her are about ten percent
I'm certain she's far too good for me

Don't ask me why
But I will try
To win her heart
Even if I fail
Can't live my life
Being afraid
Of what may come
Even if I fail

Let me take you to the moon
I could take you far 
Like a shooting star
My love is burning
And baby, these are more than words
Put your guard down
Take my hand
Walk this avenue
I refuse to be with any other lover
So be the magic in my world
But I could only dream of it
My chances with you are about ten percent
I'm certain you're far too good for me

Don't ask me why (Don't ask me why)
But I will try (But I will try)
To win her heart (To win her heart)
Even if I fail (Even if I fail)
Can't live my life (Can't live my life)
Being afraid (Being afraid)
Of what may come (Of what my come)
Even if I fail (Even if I fail)

La, la, la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la
[x2]

Don't ask me why
But I will try
To win her heart
Even if I fail
Can't live my life (Can't live my life)
Being afraid (Being afraid)
Of what may come (Of what my come)
Even if I fail (Even if I fail)

Don't ask me why (Don't ask me why)
But I will try (But I will try)
To win her heart (To win her heart)
Even if I fail (Even if I fail)
Can't live my life (Can't live my life)
Being afraid (Being afraid)
Of what may come (Of what my come)
Even if I fail (Even if I fail)
