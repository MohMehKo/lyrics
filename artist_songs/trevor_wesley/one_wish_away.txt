Stuck in a world with expectations on our minds
And were surprised to find were only disappointed, yeah
While maybe those pomes will fill a void of emptiness
And so and so will finally think that you are worth it

It's one wish away
The grass always greener
If only I could buy those sneakers
That would solve my happiness
It's one wish away
I wish I had my friends
House with a picket fence
Yeah, maybe then I'll find happiness

It's only one wish away, one wish away, yeah
Nothings ever good enough
I want it cause it's
It's only one wish away, one wish away, yeah
Are we ever satisfied?
Keep searching for that high
Damn, it's one wish away, away
Just one wish away, away
Just one wish away

Maybe you'll get that girl
You know you'll never have
She's only in your dreams
You'll get her eventually, yeah
To some, wishes only make belief
Cause they don't have [?]
They can't wish upon a star
Your one wish away
From being a doctor or a lawyer
Maybe an actor or a singer
A famous dancer on a stage

It's only one wish away, one wish away, yeah
Nothings ever good enough
I want it cause it's
It's only one wish away, one wish away, yeah
Are we ever satisfied?
Keep searching for that high
Damn, it's one wish away, away
Just one wish away, away
Just one wish away

So, be a fighter
Never let it not conquer you
Keep asking for the answers that will mend your broken heart
Your just one wish away
But don't miss all the colours of the rainbow
Searching for your pot of gold

It's only one wish away, one wish away, yeah
Nothings ever good enough
I want it cause it's
It's only one wish away, one wish away, yeah
Are we ever satisfied?
Keep searching for that high
Damn, it's one wish away, away, away
Just one wish away, away
Just one wish away
