Girl, just let your hair down
Let's paint the whole town
Life is our playground, yeah
But I'm not a kid no more
So I must open doors and make you feel like the lady you are
My momma raised me to be classy, not flashy
I'm happy to please you
Though I can tell that's not what you're used to

And they say (They say) chivalry is dead
(Dead, Dead)
Girl, let a real man pick up the slack
And treat you with respect, yeah

And you don't have to love me
Love me, Love me
You don't have to love me
Love me, Love me
Just 'cause I'm a gentleman don't mean
I ain't taking you to bed

Ahhh, baby let me buy your meals
I see you're head over heels
I feel like you deserve it
There's no pressure
We can do whatever makes you comfortable, yeah
I could float your boat
If you're cold take my coat
I'll sing a music note from a song that I just wrote
Girl, just take my hand
And let me be your man
Though that's not what you're used to

And they say chivalry is dead
(Dead, Dead)
Girl, let a real man pick up the slack
And treat you with respect, yeah

And you don't have to love me
Love me, Love me
You don't have to love me
Love me, Love me
Just 'cause I'm a gentleman don't mean I ain't taking you to bed

That's just how you treat a lady
Treat a lady, Treat a lady
Treat a lady, Treat a lady
Treat a lady
Dadadadadum
That's just how you treat a lady
Treat a lady, Treat a lady
Treat a lady, Treat a lady
Treat a lady
Dadadadadum

And they say chivalry is dead
(Dead, Dead)
Girl, let a real man pick up the slack
And treat you with respect, yeah

And you don't have to love me
Love me, Love me
You don't have to love me
Love me, Love me
Just 'cause I'm a gentleman don't mean I ain't taking you to bed

And you don't have to love me
Love me, Love me

Love me, Love me
Just 'cause I'm a gentleman don't mean I ain't taking you to bed

And they say chivalry is dead
