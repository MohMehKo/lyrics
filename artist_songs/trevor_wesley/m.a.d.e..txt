When life's got me down
Look at my face
I don't give a fuck
Cause I can't lose this race
Almost there, were closer than we've ever been

Looks like we've made it
But they'll never know
Never know what it feels like
Looks like we've made
With our middles fingers high
As we cross the finish line
Looks like we've made it
But they'll never know
Never know what it feels like
Looks like we've made it
With our middle fingers high
As we cross the finish line

Only way to survive is this damn 9 to 5
I don't give a fuck
Cause my dreams are to high
Were almost there
Were closer than we've ever been

Looks like we've made it
But they'll never know
Never know what it feels like
Looks like we've made
With our middles fingers high
As we cross the finish line
Looks like we've made it
But they'll never know
Never know what it feels like
Looks like we've made it
With our middle fingers high
As we cross the finish line

They say
It take 10 years to be an overnight success
Lose my fear to my no's into yes
Where I've won't define where is next
I've worked way to damn hard to have any regrets
I don't care what it looks like
I just care what it feels like
I sacrifice being in the spot light
Just to stay true to what feels right
Even though

Looks like we've made it
But they'll never know
Never know what it feels like
Looks like we've made
With our middles fingers high
As we cross the finish line
Looks like we've made it
But they'll never know
Never know what it feels like
Looks like we've made it
With our middle fingers high
As we cross the finish line

Looks we've made it
Looks we've made it
Looks we've made it
Looks we've made it
Looks we've made it
Made it
