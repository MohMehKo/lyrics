U and I, we could be anything
Put your trust in me
And I'll put a smile on your face
I'm overjoyed, but overwhelmed
Chasin' you, just make up your mind
You know in your heart I'd be so good to you

And you'll never wanna look back
At other guys you've had
Causin' those tears in your eyes
Girl I'd never treat you bad
You wanna call me bad
The rest of your life

So where do we go from here?
Where do we goooo-ooooo?
Where do we go from here?
Where do we goooo-ooooo?

U and I, we could soar the galaxy
Be my shooting star
And I'll be your sun and your moon
If you could feel my tone in this melody
As I sing you this song
You know in your heart I'll be everything you want me to

And you'll never wanna look back
At other guys you've had
Causin' those tears in your eyes
Girl I'd never treat you bad
You wanna call me bad
The rest of your life

So where do we go from here?
Where do we goooo-ooooo?
Where do we go from here?
Where do we goooo-ooooo?

Where do we go? Wh-wh-wh- where do we go?
So where do we go from here?
Where do we goooo-ooooo?
Where do we go from here?
Where do we goooo-ooooo?
