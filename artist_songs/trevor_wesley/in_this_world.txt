Everything you do
You light the spark in my mood
Taking me to places I have never been
Beautiful won't you just let me in your world?
I can taste the words on my tongue
Your name might be the one word
I never run away from
I wanna shout so let me in your world
Pretty miss there's an innocence I can't resist
Can't dismiss so I wrote you a song and it goes like this:

La la la la la la la la, that ass though
La la la la la la la la, that ass though
La la la la la la la la that ass though
La la la la la la la la, that ass though

Everything you do
You light the spark in my mood
Taking me to places I have never been
Beautiful won't you just let me in your world?
You can be the only friend I confide in
I'll give my heart to you
I'll keep fightin' for the girl I love
I'm no good for anybody else in this world

I like it when you wear the jeans
With the rips at the seams
If you'd like to take them off, girl
Then by all means (by all means)
You're like my favorite cake (cake)
I love the way you taste (taste)
Never let you go to waste (no way)
I'll even lick the plate ooo...

La la la la la la la la, that ass though
La la la la la la la la, that ass though
La la la la la la la la that ass though
La la la la la la la la, that ass though

Everything you do
You light the spark in my mood
Taking me to places I have never been
Beautiful won't you just let me in your world?
You can be the only friend I confide in
I'll give my heart to you
I'll keep fightin' for the girl I love
I'm no good for anybody else in this world

[Raven Felix:]
Yeah you been fightin' for a minute
Cause I'm lookin so good
You wanna get all up in it
You know that that I be giving you the business
And you better not be done until I'm finished
Bad bitch, nice ass slim waist
Lickin' his lips like he just wanna taste
So shit if it's all about the bass
Imma let it go boom when I put it in his face like

La la la la la la la la, that ass though
La la la la la la la la, that ass though
La la la la la la la la that ass though
La la la la la la la la, that ass though

Everything you do
You light the spark in my mood
Taking me to places I have never been
Beautiful won't you just let me in your world?
You can be the only friend I confide in
I'll give my heart to you
I'll keep fightin' for the girl I love
I'm no good for anybody else in this world
