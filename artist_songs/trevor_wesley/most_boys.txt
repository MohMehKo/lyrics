Most boys might trying pick you
Most boys would probably trying trick you
Chasing a one-night stand

But baby you're special
With more than just a vessel
I've been partying up a lot lately
With myself and a baby
Please don't get the wrong idea
Maybe you mistaken
My heart can't take a break in

If you're down with me 
I'll be down for you
There ain't nothing wrong
with trying something new (neeeew)
Baby it's that simple
You can't denial my dimple

'Cause I ain't like other guys (guuuys)
I'm hooked on your eyes
So, look in mine
I promise you I'll be faithful
Girl with that I'll do

I'll take you high (hiiiigh)
Way up in the sky (skyyyy)
I've got the key
Come walk with me
I swear you won't be sorry
Won't leave you brokenhearted

Most boys might trying whistle
She's pushing to the sad for dismiss zone
That ain't no way
To hollow at a lady
To call that game you crazy

Most boys may try to fight
To try improve the day you shine in night
But no, that's the wrong approach
Only if I had to
If he hurt you, I'll be glad to

So, if you're down with me (me)
I'll be down for you (you)
There ain't nothing wrong
with trying something new (something new)
You can't deny my dimple
Baby it's that simple

Way up in the sky (skyyyy)

Come walk with me
I swear you won't be sorry
Won't leave you brokenhearted

Up, up, up, up,
And up, up
And up we go
