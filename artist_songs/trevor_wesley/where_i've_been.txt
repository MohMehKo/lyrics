Where I've been
Ain't the same as where I'm going
Stop worrying about yesterday
Cause right now were living, yeah
Where I've been
Ain't the same as where I'm going
Stop worrying about yesterday
Cause right now were living, yeah

Where I have been
Where I should be
But who's to say so
I'm where God put me
Don't need directions
Navigations in my heart

I used to be cashless
Thinking that ain't that a bitch
I need a head change
So I gotta a new girlfriend
My life is blooming
Like a flower in the park

I'm doing it my own way
Cause what's life without living, without living
No I can't be afraid
I gotta take a chance on love

Where I've been
Ain't the same as where I'm going
Stop worrying about yesterday
Cause right now were living, yeah
Where I've been
Ain't the same as where I'm going
Stop worrying about yesterday
Cause right now were living, yeah

Where I've been
Where ain't where I'm going
Where I've been
It's nice to know ya
Sayonara to my demons
I'm a soldier
Everything I've gained
They can't take away
Living life in vein
Of course their gonna to hate
Funny thing about that
Is there's angels on my back
Where I've been
Where I'm at

I'm doing it my own way
Cause what's life without living, without living
No I can't be afraid
I gotta take a chance on love

Where I've been
Ain't the same as where I'm going
Stop worrying about yesterday
Cause right now were living, yeah
Where I've been
Ain't the same as where I'm going
Stop worrying about yesterday
Cause right now were living, yeah

Where I've been
Where ain't where I'm going
Where I've been

Where I've been
Ain't the same as where I'm going
Stop worrying about yesterday
Cause right now were living, yeah
Where I've been
Ain't the same as where I'm going
Stop worrying about yesterday
Cause right now were living, yeah

Where I've been
