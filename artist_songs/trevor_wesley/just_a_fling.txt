Pretty lady we've been talking on a daily
And now maybe it's time we take it somewhere
Your perfection is a blessing
And girl my intentions are more than pulling your hair

But oh, baby I can't wait now more
(Girl you know you stay on my mind)
Oh, so tell me what you waiting for
(Baby girl don't waste my time)
We can be a fling, just a fling, just a fling
Or we can be the real thing
We can be a fling, just a fling, just a fling
But you know I want the real thing
Tell me one way or the other
Cause we could go the either way
We can be a fling, just a fling, just a fling
But you know I want the real thing

Conversation off at least the situations
Where an action proves love is a verb
Either lover or a friend
That's where if I can give you everything
I'd give you my world

Oh, baby I can't wait now more
(Girl you know you stay on my mind)
Oh, so tell me what you waiting for
(Baby girl don't waste my time)
We can be a fling, just a fling, just a fling
Or we can be the real thing
We can be a fling, just a fling, just a fling
But you know I want the real thing
Tell me one way or the other
Cause we could go the either way
We can be a fling, just a fling, just a fling
But you know I want the real thing

(Girl you know you stay on my mind)
(Baby girl don't waste my time)

We can be a fling, just a fling, just a fling
Or we can be the real thing
We can be a fling, just a fling, just a fling
But you know I want the real thing
Tell me one way or the other
Cause we could go the either way
We can be a fling, just a fling, just a fling
But you know I want the real thing
