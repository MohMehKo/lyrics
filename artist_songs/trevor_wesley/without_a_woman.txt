Where would I?
Be without that magic touch from a woman? um
It's been me, myself, and I
Who could last long without true loving? um

Won't you get a little taste of love (taste of love)
You might find yourself chasing love (chasing love)
Somebody were wasting love
Have you ever felt that way?
Should I take a chance on love? (chance on love)
I'm hoping, I'm hoping
Someone leave me in the dust, no
Since this love been so low
So where? Where?
Where would this world be without a woman?
A woman
Tell me how? How?
How would we survive without a woman?
A woman

Who would I
Be without my mothers intuition?
Father time, make no mistake
Not, there ain't nothing missing
No, oh, oh
No, oh, oh

Won't you get a little taste of love (taste of love)
