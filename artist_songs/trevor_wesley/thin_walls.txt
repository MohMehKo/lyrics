I had to take her home (home)
Lead her to my room
Only thing silent is my phone
You know I like an attitude
No, other intentions
No more room for friendship
Soon as I took off her gown
You know it went down
(Was I too loud)

I guess you heard me
Through these thin wall that we have
I'm so sorry, your ears witnessed that
I could have locked all the door
But you would've still heard the noise
Thought I was out with my boys
Till you heard her voice
Through these damn thin walls
Thin walls, thin walls
Umm, these damn thin walls
Thin walls, thin walls

There's a knock-knock at my door
Neighbours getting pissed
Wondering what the hell for?
There's nobody else to blame
No surprise that they know my full name
(Trevor Wesley, Trevor Wesley)
Can you say it even louder, even louder?
(Trevor Wesley, Trevor Wesley)
You've been screaming it for hours
Maybe we should take a break
Maybe not, not
Why stop if I hitting that spot
You sure come over a lot, a lot
If your tired take an energy shot

I guess you heard me
Through these thin wall that we have
I'm so sorry, your ears witnessed that
I could have locked all the door
But you would've still heard the noise
Thought I was out with my boys
Till you heard her voice
Through these damn thin walls
Thin walls, thin walls
Umm, these damn thin walls
Thin walls, thin walls

I guess you heard me
Through these thin wall that we have
I'm so sorry, your ears witnessed that
I could have locked all the door
But you would've still heard the noise
Thought I was out with my boys
Till you heard her voice
Through these damn thin walls
Thin walls, thin walls
Umm, these damn thin walls
Thin walls, thin walls
