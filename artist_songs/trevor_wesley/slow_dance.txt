Moments like this rarely come around
Actions do speak louder than words
So girl I won't make a sound
And show you that you found
Your soulmate, ya
I will take my time
And make sure that it's a blind win
We do make love
It will be amazing, more than entertaining

From the clouds cupid struck me
With that bow and arrow
Wrap your pretty arms real tight around me
And baby follow my lead
Let's slow dance and take a chance (slow dance)
Let's make it last forever
If we move to fast we might just crash and burn
So take my hand and slow dance, slow dance
Slow dance with me
Little bit of romance to a slow jam
Slow dance with me

From our first kiss (our first kiss)
Girl you blew my mind
Put all my other girls behind you
I knew that if we were to dance
I should not get in your pants, too soon
I'll have some self control
So we can take it slow
And prove to you
A real star should shine
This ain't a bump and grind, ya

From the clouds cupid struck me
With that bow and arrow
Wrap your pretty arms real tight around me
And follow my lead
While we slow dance and take a chance
Let's make it last forever
If we move to fast we might just crash and burn
So take my hand and slow dance, slow dance
Slow dance with me
Little bit of romance to a slow jam
Slow dance with me

Let's slow dance and take a chance
Let's make it last forever
If we move to fast we might just crash and burn
So take my hand and slow dance, slow dance
Slow dance with me
Little bit of romance to a slow jam
Slow dance with me
