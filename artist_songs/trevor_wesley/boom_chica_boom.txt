I, don't mind the little things
I don't mind one bit
That ring a ling
Notifications from you baby make my heart sing

I'm loving the way you talk
My Instagram always stocked
You finding a way to flirt
Makes me willing to do the work
Teach me all the things you deserve
I would love to know all your work
Kicking these other girls to the curb
(Boom chica boom)
Boom chica boom
(Boom chica boom)
Boom, boom chica boom
(Boom chica boom)
And boom chica boom
(Boom chica boom)
Boom, boom chica boom
(Boom, boom chica boom)

Girls wanna stand up, gah
I think I know why
You could wear nothing but my hat and bow tie
First you admit I couldn't resit ya, yeah
Your perfect yeah
Pull up a chair
Need place to sit
(Boom chica boom)

I'm loving the way you talk
My Instagram always stocked
You finding a way to flirt
Makes me willing to do the work
Teach me all the things you deserve
I would love to know all your work
Kicking these other girls to the curb

Boom chica boom

Boom, boom chica boom

And boom chica boom
