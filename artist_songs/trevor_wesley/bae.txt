Put you before anything else

Your the love of my life
Yes, the love of my life
Put you before anything
It's you I see when I close my eyes
Your the love of my life
Yes, the love of my life
Put you before anything
It's you I see when I close my eyes

There I was a time I was lost without you
Couldn't see no shooting stars without you
Crazy how some days I forget
How precious life is with you
Take the lime light, it's a fine night
Let's celebrate, for heaven sake don't be afraid
Shake what your momma gave ya
Cause I'm amazed by you
And every little thing that you do

Your the love of my life
Yes, the love of my life
Put you before anything
It's you I see when I close my eyes
Your the love
Yes, the love of my life
Put you before anything
It's you I see when I close my eyes

Your not a fantasy, your right in front of me
My flower, my rock
My forget me not
I never listen to them I'd be crock
Not only on my list you're at the top
My Jenny from the block
If the times right I just might call you my bae
Put you before anyone and everything, my bae
(My bae) Baby

Your the love of my life
Yes, the love of my life
Put you before anything
It's you I see when I close my eyes
Your the love of my life
Yes, the love of my life
Put you before anything
It's you I see when I close my eyes

Love of my life
Love-of-my-life, love-of-my-life
The love of my life
Yes, the love of my, love of my life

Your the love of my life
Yes, the love of my life
Put you before anything
It's you I see when I close my eyes
