Life is what we make
And oh how what we waste
What's still not understood
We'll be gone one day,
Somewhere far away
Or in the ground for good

Too much, too much we use it all
Waiting for days like we should live so long
Get up and rush to get it done
Wait on the world
Wait on the world

All the weight that's always on me
Falls away when you're around
All the weight that's always on me
Still somehow I get carried away
I get carried away with you

Would it be so strange
To wake up one day,
And it was all a dream
Every single place, 
Earth to time and space
Constructed in your sleep

But we love, we love the here and now
Take, and we'll take til everything runs out
If we are, we are the end of all
We'll make it last, I'll make it last
If I'm with you because

All the weight that's always on me
Falls away when you're around
All the weight that's always on me leaves somehow
Like all the pain and all my worry,
Pushed to the side when you're around
All the weight that's always on me,
Still somehow I get carried away
I get carried away with you
I get carried away
I get carried away with you
Oh, I get carried away

All the weight, the hurt, the pain
When I'm with you 
It all just falls away
The fear, the need, the hate
Just falls away 
When I'm alone with you
When I'm alone with you
When I'm alone with you
