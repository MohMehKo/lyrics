I'm in a hole looking up
I can see my soul 
And it seems troubled
How did I get this far
Now I've lost my way back
I can't get to you

I'm in a hole looking up
I can see my soul
And it seems troubled
How did I get this far
Thought I was the hunter 
But now I'm hunted

I'm feeling the loss of blood
From the lack of trust
And the wound inside
My ribs should've been enough
I keep running
But I can't get to you,
I can't, can't get
I can't get to you
I can't, can't get
I can't get to you
And you're the ocean I will drown in
Take a breath and swim through you 
And you're the ocean I will drown in
Take a breath and swim through you

When you sleep I hope you're sleeping sound
I'm trapped inside your memories 
I see your spirit in the dark
Wanna break it out 
But I can't get through to you

When you sleep I hope you're sleeping sound
If I whisper can you hear me now
Cause I'm trapped inside your memories 
Can you feel me watching in the trees
I see your spirit in the dark
It hides behind your callous heart
Wanna break it out
But I can't get through to you

I can't, can't get
I cant get to you
And you're the ocean I will drown in
Take a breath and swim through you
And you're the ocean I will drown in
Take a breath and swim through you

Can't let you fill my lungs
Can't let you fill my lungs
Can't let you fill my lungs
Can't let you fill my lungs
