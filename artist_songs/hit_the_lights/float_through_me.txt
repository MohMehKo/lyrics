I awake out of place
Don't know where I've been 
Last thing I remember an accident
Passed through your hands 
My feet become anchors where I stand
You just float through me

Am I a ghost or am I just something new
That you see right through 
Am I a ghost?
Is heaven just make believe?
Cause you're always out of reach 

My body's gone but my soul it still remains
Can't sleep 
Still I dream that you call my name 
I sing to you 
Every night, I swear I do
You just float through me 

Am I a ghost or am I just something new
That you see right through 
Am I a ghost?
Is heaven just make believe?
Cause you're always out of reach

Sing under your floor boards late at night
Drift into the morning light 
Just float through me 
Float through me
Float through me

Am I a ghost or am I just something new
That you see right through 
Am I a ghost?
Is heaven just make believe?
Cause you're always out of reach 
Am I a ghost or am I just something new?
Am I a ghost?
Am I a ghost?
Am I a ghost?
Is heaven not meant for me?
Cause you're always out of reach
