Can you feel the lights go down
As the world falls asleep
You look at me with accusing eyes
Like I'm trying not to leave 

When there's no one else around 
And its only you and me
When there's no one else around
And its only you and me

Who will be the first to move
Who will be the first to lead
Too long I've been holding on 
Like a flame that's flickering

When there's no one else around
And it's only you and me
When there's no one else around
And it's only you and me

And the sun awaits to take 
You further from my arms and I will break
When the sun awaits to take 
You further from my arms then I will break

And the sun awaits to take
You further from my arms and I will break
When the sun awaits to take
You further from my arms then I will break
Am guilty
So guilty
Am guilty
So guilty
