I've got some big dreams
Somehow it's harder to believe,
That we only exist
Wanna be more than this,
Nothing can stop me

Do you feel the shaking ground?
This world is mine for the taking,
Mine for the taking
This is the moment now
Oh, I know I can make it,
Swear I can make it
I'll make the Earth quake

A million people scream my name
They're saying, "Sing us a song
that'll right all the wrongs,
and make some hearts break."

Do you feel the shaking ground?
This world is mine for the taking,
Mine for the taking
This is the moment now
Oh, I know I can make it,
Swear I can make it
I'll make the Earth quake

I'll make the Earth quake
Even power lines can't hold me now
Even gravity can't pull me down

Do you feel the shaking ground?
This world is mine for the taking,
Mine for the taking
This is the moment now
Oh, I know I can make it,
Swear I can make it
I'll make the Earth quake
I'll make the Earth quake
Well this is the moment now
I know I can make it,
Swear I can make it
I'll make the Earth quake
I'll make the Earth quake
