Crash into me and have your way
Cause I’m not strong enough now
I’m just sand in your wake, quickly washed away
And I still try to hold my head up
Nights can be as cold as your touch
Giving up, I’m giving up

I keep running, running but the tide keeps on coming

I’ve been caught in your undertow, it’s pulling my faster
I’m sinking, taking you in my lungs, it’s pulling me under
Your love’s like the ocean, the waves might hit
And slip through my hands when I reach for it
I’ve been caught in your undertow

Keep your head up
(You keep pulling me under)
Keep your head up
(You keep pulling me under)
Keep your head
