There's a darkness 
Waiting in the clouds 
And a silent crowd forms now
There's a darkness 
In the sky above 
Seems it's waited long enough

Woah, I should've known, 
I should've known by now
Woah, I should've known, 
I should've known by now but I don't

As the darkness 
Moves to the ground 
I take my one last look around
Nobody ran, nobody screamed, 
Nobody cried, nobody hid,
Or headed home to say goodbye
No way at all how they had said 
What the end would be like 

Woah, I should've known, 
I should've known by now
Woah, I should've known, 
I should've known by now but I don't

Fold and collapse and rebuild again
Fold and collapse and rebuild again
Before we collapse and rebuild again
Fold and collapse until the end 

Will you sing the silence 
Do you hear it ringing out
Will you search around the darkness 
For a light that can't be found
You've built your bed of billboards 
And you've blocked away the sun
To witness the world ending 
At the tip of your tongue will you know

Woah, I should've known, 
I should've known by now
Woah, I should've known, 
I should've known by now

The time has come to pay the debt 
With no money for the rent
And I don't care where we head
Or whether we melt or freeze to death
But I don't
But I don't
