Drop the girl, she’s not worth the time
She’s wasted on her back dragging other boys into her lies
You know she’s no good for you
She'd sink lower than a body in the Hudson could ever do

Drop the girl, she's only gunning for your heart
She’s sure to leave you broke and bleeding
Cause she’s all about trying to figure out the breakdown
Whoa…
And you know she’ll turn her back on you,
She covers her tracks and buries the clues
She’s only set out to burn you
And you know your better off so c’mon…

Drop the girl… Whooooa
She’s the only reason she’s got you believing its love
Drop the girl… Whooooa
The bridge is best for burning so send her down in flames and get up…

Drop the girl you can taste it on her lips
What she's drinking, who she’s been with
Yea she’s so turned on (shes so turned on)
How everything’s gone wrong
Its all her fault and you know
She’ll turn her back on you
She covers her tracks and buries the clues
She’s only set out to burn you
And you know your better off so c’mon….

Drop the girl… Whooooa
She’s the only reason she’s got you believing its love
Drop the girl… Whooooa
The bridge is best for burning so send her down in flames and just
Drop the girl from the highest building
You can when you have to 
You gotta see through the scam
Drop the girl… Whooooa 
The bridge is best for burning so send her down in flames and just…

DROP THE GIRL!

Throw your pride aside and show your friends some faith
(Is there a night where she forgets your name?)
Who’s got your back when everything's starting to fall right apart again
(C'mon is that what it takes?)
