Dim the lights 
Catch your breath
Feel it burning in your chest
Hold on tight
Closed eyes
Let it rattle your insides
We'll never listen to a word they say
It doesn't matter anyway 
Cause we make who we are
When we're starved to make a mark in this world

Tonight we'll be the only light
Tonight we jump from greater heights, 
We're invincible

And it starts 
Take the stage
Feel the blood rush through your veins
Take a chance 
We could be 
So much more than what we seem
Every minute that'll pass us by
Is stolen out of our own lives 
Every star in your view
Like spotlights now they're shining down on you

Tonight we'll be the only light
Tonight we jump from greater heights,
We're invincible
We're invincible

And tonight we won't fall,
We can't fear,
We won't lose hope,
Tonight we'll stand tall,
We'll hold strong,
We'll be invincible

Tonight we'll be the only light
Tonight we jump from greater heights,
We're invincible 
We're invincible 
We're invincible
We will be the only light
