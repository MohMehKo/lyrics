This place feels like Hell

You pray for someone to save your heart
It was ripped from Heaven and torn apart
You're breaking your neck, kid 
To keep your head above the fire 
But you'll burn instead

Oh my God, I've found Hell in you
Oh my God, I've found Hell in you

Oh my God, I've found Hell in you
Oh my God, I've found Hell in you

I've found Hell in you
