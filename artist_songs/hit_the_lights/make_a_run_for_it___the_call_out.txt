Let's leave these lives tonight
You can find us by the trail of our insides
They were left at the scene of the crime
We've tampered with evidence
Finger prints were left behind

So lets cut cut cut to the chase
We need to get get get our story straight
This is what were hoping
Covers blown wide open
We can make a run for it
We can make a run for it
We've got this down to a science baby
Don't be afraid, be very afraid
We've got this down to a science baby
We don't make mistakes, we don't intend to make

Complex calculated overlooked and underrated
We've got this down
We've got this down

So lets cut cut cut to the chase
We need to get get get our story straight
Cut to the chase
We can make a run for it
We've got this down to a science baby
Don't be afraid, be very afraid
We've got this down to a science baby
We don't make mistakes, we don't intend to make

Taking what we can
We're modern day cut-throats
We're breaking all your plans
Staking out every road
Taking what we can
We're modern day cut-throats
We're breaking all your plans
Staking out every road

To lure you in and set you up
(We won't back down, you know that we can do this)
To take our fall and now it's over
(With or without you, with or without you)

Don't be afraid, be very afraid
