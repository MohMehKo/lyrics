I’ll be at home when you’re hearing this
I might be alone but I’m over it
So much to say with no time to waste
My only regret, it’s not to your face
You ended it strangely without a word said
Never replied, never had a chance
For every night I slept myself sick wondering what I did
This is goodbye, I hope you fucking choke on it

You know I thought we had it all
What was it really about?
You keep building your walls
Tell me who’s missing you now
Who’s missing you now?

Should I be surprised? Angry? Upset?
There’s always another girl to regret
I could just fall right off the deep end
Drowning myself in all this drinking
Cause I’m in control, I’m in a good place
Trying hard to erase memories of your taste
All your favorite songs were never that good
Wishing somehow I could take it all back
And turn that goddamn radio off

You know I thought we had it all
What was it really about?
You keep building your walls
Tell me who’s missing you now
Who's missing you now?
Nobody’s missing you now
I slept myself sick every night but I’m over it

You crave acceptance from strangers through pictures and filters
Attention from people who don’t know you
And now that it’s over, how many will be there to pick you back up
Cause I see right through, I see right through
I know the real you, I see right through

You know I thought we had it all
What was it really about?
You keep building your walls
Tell me who’s missing you now?
Who’s missing you now?
Nobody’s missing you now
I slept myself sick every night but I’m over it 
Who’s missing you now?
Nobody’s missing you now
I slept myself sick every night but I’m over it
