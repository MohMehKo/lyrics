Count it!
One year later 
Met with death, miles, goodbyes
States, cities, friends all converted into time
Yet on the road
From family and home
It feels like, it just feels right
Show to show we saw the crowds grow
We played our hearts out,
We wore our throats down
And every drop of sweat that we bled has been worth it
Cause we earned it
We'll weather the rain, the sleet, the snow and oceans
Just to get through to you
We'll weather the rain, the sleet, the snow and oceans
Just to get through to you
