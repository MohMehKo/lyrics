In Ohio there’s a fire that burnt my summer bones
Hiding out beyond the tree lines
We’d sit for hours and watch them glow
Murder seconds in the playground across from Sherwood Park
Smoke ourselves to the filter
And swore we’d split as soon as winter starts

I used to know when I was home
I used to be invincible, so damn sure of everything
When time alone was so few and far between
We held the world
The world just got too heavy for me

Where do I go? I’m so tired of the same roads
I know that it’s home but I can’t take the snow anymore
We had the fall and now it’s lost like everything
Just fell apart right in my arms, I got nothing to lose

We parked our car in the graveyard and drank away our lives
Tonight I’ll tear down the headstones we hid behind, one at a time

I used to know when I was home
I used to be invincible, so damn sure of everything
When time alone was so few and far between
We held the world
The world just got too heavy for me

Where do I go? I’m so tired of the same roads
I know that it’s home but I can’t take the snow anymore
We had the fall and now it’s lost like everything
Where do I go? I’m so sick of the same roads
I know that it’s home but I can’t fake a smile anymore
We had the fall and now it’s lost like everything
Just fell apart right in my arms, I got nothing to lose

So impertinent when you look at it and I shouldn’t act
Like it’s all so tough, or it’s just too much
And I’ll toast to luck if this is as bad as it gets
Cause I got nothing to lose

Where do I go? I’m so tired of the same roads
I know that it’s home but I can’t find the cold anymore
We had the fall and now it’s lost like everything
Where do I go? I’m so sick of the same roads
I know that it’s home but I can’t take the snow anymore
We had the fall and now it’s lost like everything
Just fell apart right in my arms, I got nothing to lose
