We're taking bats to neighborhoods
Where we don't belong
Where they say we can't go
Carve our names in all the wood and the concrete
They think they're safe in their homes
So they can see it
Remind them that we exist
This place is not their own
The city's our birthright
We'll keep our fists tight
So they'll know

Hey! I can say 
We're all just fucked up kids and that's ok
If we don't belong 
To anyone or anything
We're all just fucked up kids
Walking on promises
We're breaking all of them
But we could be

Getting good at being bad
They don't understand
What's it hurt they don't know
Apologies we never have
We're a shot of light
In the dark, a faint glow
But we burn the brightest
During the night shift
Hanging with New York's finest
So when the bars close
And everyone goes home
We don't go

Hey! I can say 
We're all just fucked up kids and that's ok
If we don't belong 
To anyone or anything
We're all just fucked up kids
Walking on promises
We're breaking all of them
But we could be

We can roam the streets
Drinking Genesee
Running from police
Taking shots til we're lost
Or disturb the peace
Cause we never sleep
Down your drink and we're gone
(We're getting good at being bad)

Hey! I can say 
We're all just fucked up kids and that's ok
If we don't belong 
To anyone or anything
We're all just fucked up kids
Breaking before we bend
Born to lose in the end
But we could be more
Born to lose in the end
But we could be more than this
