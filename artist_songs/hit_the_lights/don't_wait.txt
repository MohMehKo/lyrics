There were ocean waves, big city lights,
lazy summer days, crazy sleepless nights.
Somewhere out on an open road,
you drove yourself out of your mind
Sometimes to do the things you love, 
you leave the ones you love behind.

You danced, you drank, you laughed, you cried,
you went to work and said goodbye
I lived, I learned, stayed up all night,
I'll see you when the time is right again

I've got old shoes in a brand new town
I wear'em like they're starin' let the tongues hang out.
I'm just too loose for the same old crowd
If I could only see your face before my souls wear down
Somewhere out on an open road, you search until you look inside
Sometimes you've got to see the world to find you what you left behind

You danced, you drank, you laughed, you cried,
you went to work and said goodbye
I lived, I learned, stayed up all night,
I'll see you when the time is right again

Wait for me, don't wait, don't wait for me
you can't wait for the sun to rise, you'll never know until you try
we make mistakes and learn in time, we all grow old, we live, we die
we woke before the sun could rise, we packed our bags and waved goodbye
we drove into a great sunset and lived a life with no regret 
I can't wait for the sun to rise, I'll never know until I try
We make mistakes and learn through time, we all grow old,
we live, we die, we live
