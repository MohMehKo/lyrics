Can you feel our gravity?
Can you gravitate to me?
Can you feel our gravity?
Right now!

Can you feel me closing in counting down satellites?
Can you see the galaxies brighten when we're aligned?
And every star that navigates,
Will guide me all the way to you
I've been orbiting but you could pull me through

Can you feel our gravity?
Can you gravitate to me?
Can you feel our gravity?
Right now
Can you feel our energy,
As it pulls you into me?
Can you gravitate to me?

Do you lie awake scanning the stars at night?
Are you holding out hope for the sign of life?
Do constellations carry you?
Do galaxies come into view?
Do you wait for me?
Cause I could wait for you!

Can you feel our gravity?
Can you gravitate to me?
Do you feel our gravity?
Right now
Can you feel our energy,
As it pulls you into me?
Can you gravitate to me?
Right now!

Don't!
Don't pass me by
If we let go
Our worlds collide
Our worlds collide

Can you feel our gravity?
Can you gravitate to me?
Can you feel our gravity?
Right now
Can you feel our energy?
As it pull you into me?
Can you feel our gravity?
Right now!
