Old friend, it’s so good to see you again
Through distance and times worse for wear
We carved out the stories we share
(Oh, how the time goes by)

All this time not knowing where we’re going, where we’ll be
You have been a constant source of trust and sanity

Old friend, so happy to see you again
Even when days turn to years, here’s hoping you’ll always be here
Always be here, always be here

As time takes hold, we live, let go
We stand, we fall, we heal, we grow
As time takes hold, we live, let go
We stand, we fall, we heal, we grow

Remember the time spent, we all go through changes
Like seasons I cycle right back into you

Old friend, it’s so good to see you again
The shots and the chasers and cheers
The laughter, the fights and the tears
(Oh how the time goes by)

Old friend, so happy to see you again
No matter when days turn to years
I know that you’ll always be there
Always be there
