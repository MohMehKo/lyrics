I'm sorry for every apology
But you'll never know how much you mean to me
Until you put me in the ground
Until my body is found
Until the day I'm buried

You'll find me at the end of my rope
Hanging on your every word
I'm finally getting the hang 
Of getting hung up on girls like you

Don't let me let you go
Don't leave me here all alone
Because every night I spend without you
Is like a knife held to my throat

Your eyes are the only stars I want to see
Your lips is the only air I want to breath
So please tell me that I'm asking for too much
Because there's so much of myself that I've given up

I knew your smile would mean the death of me
But I couldn't care less, no I couldn't care less
So sweet heart kills me constantly
She takes my last breath, you took my last breath
And I'll choke on my last words
