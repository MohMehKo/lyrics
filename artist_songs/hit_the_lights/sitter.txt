These days I’m a hit and run, left the scene as I coughed up blood
Stayed inside, hid from the sun, all jammed up like a loaded gun

Even the nightlife’s just too bright, so I never step outside
Blackened lungs and bloodshot eyes keep me up but not alive
Just holding on

There’s a lesson here but I’m not catching on
Cause the taste of it still lingers on my tongue
Such a bitter ending taste of what’s become
The only drug I didn’t love

Breathe deep leave ground, can’t get to sleep so I just pass out
Fight the words before they leave my mouth
Bite the tongue, but I just can’t tell if it’s too late to save myself
Hit the ground but the bottom dropped out
Lost and found my way around
It’s not new to me, yeah I’m used to it by now

There’s a lesson here but I’m not catching on
Cause the taste of it still lingers on my tongue
Such a bitter ending taste of what’s become
The only drug I didn’t love

Looking for a way, an out
Release, somehow
You’re lost and now it’s pulling me under
We’re all allowed our ups and downs in times of doubt
We all go through it just holding on
(These days I’m a hit and run)

There’s a lesson here but I’m not catching on
Cause the taste of it still lingers on my tongue
Such a bitter ending taste of what’s become
The only drug I didn’t love
