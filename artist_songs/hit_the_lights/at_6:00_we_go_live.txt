So hold me close but don't get too comfortable
'cause this might be the last time you hear my voice
well is this goodbye? or is it goodnight?
I'll promise to call if you promise not to cry
not to cry, not to cry

'Cause every tear you waste on me
isn't worth the air I breathe
and every tear you waste on me...

So let's make the best of what we've had
and would you care if I don't come back?
can you hear me scream your name?
hear me from a thousand miles away?
can you hear me scream your name?

So let's get this show out on the road
who cares if we don't know where to go
well this is goodbye, give me a kiss goodnight
I'll promise to call if you promise me you'll, 
promise me you'll cry, you'll cry

So let's make the best of what we've had
I promise you I won't come back
can you hear me scream your name?
hear me from a thousand miles away?
can you hear me scream your name?

can you hear me scream your name?
hear me from a thousand miles away?
can you hear me scream your name?

I'm leaving town tonight 
and I want to hear something from you,
anything from you
