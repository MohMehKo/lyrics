Come on make this last
Just 'til morning comes and we'll pick up the pieces
One by one
Tomorrows just another day
And this life's just to far away
To waste yet another tear on you

And I, I know this can't be wrong it feels so right
Laying in these arms with me tonight
(I hope you know) 
I hope you know that these feelings are true
That I have about you

I'll lie awake 
Wishing on your star 
I hope you think about me and
Wish on my star too
I'd like to think that we got something going
And I'm breaking, I'm bleeding, I'm falling in circles for you

Your eyes are filled with tears tonight
And I'll keep twisting fate all night

I know, and god I hope
That you feel this way too
And I, I know this can't be wrong it feels so right
Laying in these arms with me tonight
(I hope you know) 
I hope you know that these feelings are true
That I have about you

I'll lie awake 
Wishing on your star 
I hope you think about 
Wish on my star too
I'd like to think that we got something going
I'm breaking, I'm bleeding, I'm falling in circles for you

I'll wait for this to end
But I don't know if these feelings are for real
My heart beats faster every time you're near
Every time you're near

I'll lie awake 
Wishing on your star 
I hope you think about 
Wish on my star too (Wish on my star too)
I'd like to think that we have something going
And I'm breaking, I'm bleeding, I'm falling in circles for you
