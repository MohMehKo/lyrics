Every inadvertently fostering controversy
A trait of mine it seems, to laugh at all the darker sides of things
Never been one to miss out when contention comes around
I find myself at peace while those around me ask how I could be

So in love with the words I shouldn’t speak
Open up, they fall out like broken teeth
From my mouth, onto nerves, into fights
Sincerely, sweet blasphemy, myself and I

Always thrilled to plant the seed of doubt in those that mindlessly
Follow the aging ways of older days with blind hypocrisy
And there could be better ways, but as my sanity decays
I feel I find relief in making them as comfortless as me

So in love with the words I shouldn’t speak
Open up, they fall out like broken teeth
From my mouth, onto nerves, into fights
Sincerely, sweet blasphemy, myself and I

I’m lost but I’m hopeful, still fearing the end
Searching for purpose, we break and we bend
For answers and reason that we’ll never have
Some cling to reverence, I laugh to forget

So in love with the words I shouldn’t speak
Open up, they fall out like broken teeth
From my mouth, onto nerves, into fights
Sincerely, sweet blasphemy, myself and I
