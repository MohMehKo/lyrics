When the world let me down 
You were always around
If I needed a spark 
I could find you

But the fire flickered out 
And I could drown in this doubt
Even light feels so dark without you

I fear, now that I've arrived here 
I won't know what to say
Cause the world moves faster now 
And it's changing me
Wanna hold on to you 
But my arms give way
And I know this is where I let you go
Cause the world moves faster now

Now that I have to choose 
What I keep and what I lose
Who's gonna save me from myself 
If it's not you

I fear, now that I belong here 
There's nothing left to say
Cause the world moves faster now 
And it's changing me
Wanna hold on to you 
But my arms give way
And I know this is where I let you go
Cause the world moves faster now

My world always revolved around you
Like a new day I would rise to
Now I'm waking up without you
And I can't slow down we got lost somehow

Cause the world moves faster now 
And it's changing me
Wanna hold on to you 
But my arms give way
And I know this is where I let you go
Cause the world moves faster now
And it's changing me
Wanna hold on to you 
But my arms give way
And I know this is where I let you go
Cause the world moves faster now
