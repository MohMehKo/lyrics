Eyes closed
And starting to whisper I speak slow
Don't wanna give you up but I've given up lately
I wish you joy, success, and happiness
A better life, a truer sense of you
It's adding up to beat the better
When you've lost the fight to fake what you do

Breathe in, breathe out
Live it up, you'll never live this down
Last call, lost cause, who's counting
Last call, lost cause, who's counting now

Breathe in, breathe out
Live it up, you'll never live this down
Last call, lost cause, who's counting
Last call, lost cause, who's counting now

Nerves numb
When conscience comes crashing
I'll keep strong
Take time to find yourself
Until then, I'll be waiting on you to come around
And you will

Breathe in, breathe out
Live it up, you'll never live this down
Last call, lost cause, who's counting
Last call, lost cause, who's counting now

Breathe in, breathe out
Live it up, you'll never live this down
Last call, lost cause, who's counting
Last call, lost cause, who's counting now

Crashes through crashes, 
That's what it feels like
Crashes through crashes, 
I'll be waiting on you to come around
Crashes through crashes,
That's what it feels like
Crashes through crashes

Breathe in, breathe out
Live it up, you'll never live this down
This is your last call

Breathe in, breathe out
Live it up, you'll never live this down
Last call, lost cause, who's counting
Last call, lost cause, who's counting now

Breathe in, breathe out
Live it up, you'll never live this down
Last call, lost cause, who's counting
Last call, lost cause, who's counting now
