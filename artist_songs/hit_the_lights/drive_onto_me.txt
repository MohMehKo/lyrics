You're earth bound and I'm injured,
We move too fast to remember in the drive onto me.

Drive onto me, drive onto me
We carved the days from the hours,
You showed me all I could have in the drive onto me.

You were free when I was taken.
You did your best to change that in the drive onto me.
You stop and I'm in overdrive you hook the stars with your eyes,
And then drive on to me.

Drive onto me, drive onto me
We carved the days from the hours,
You showed me all I could have in the drive onto me.

Accident when we needed, I'm stronger as we near it.
We can't help to watch this whole thing crash together.
We are the bruised and the tender.
We are the crack that was mended.
From all the times we ever tried 
we should've found each other in this

Drive onto me, drive onto me
We carved the days from the hours,
You showed me all I could have in the drive onto me.
