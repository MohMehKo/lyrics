I’m digging myself out of this pile of broken bones
Spent my life on the bottom, surrounded by my own
(And I’m so sick)
You left me in silence, so I yell until it hurts
And I’ll force you to listen, my words will be your curse

Waiting on life, broken and bruised
This is it, taking hits, if I need to
Make my own way, that’s what I’ll do
Taking hits, tasting blood yeah, I spilled my guts for you

I’m draining myself out
You do what you can to survive
One day I’ll forget the taste of your lips and I
I’ll drop you like a ton of bricks, I’ll drop you like a ton of bricks

Waiting on life, broken and bruised
This is it, taking hits, if I need to
Make my own way, that’s what I’ll do
Taking hits, tasting blood yeah, I spilled my guts [x2]

You want a war, but I can’t have you pulling me down
Can’t lose control, that’s how I got to where I am now
Can we move on? I’m sick of always waiting on life

So I’ll make my own way, that’s what I’ll do
So sick of always waiting on life

Waiting on life, broken and bruised
This is it, taking hits, if I need to
Make my own way, that’s what I’ll do
Taking hits, tasting blood yeah, I spilled my guts [x2]

I’ll drop you like a ton of bricks, I’ll drop you like a ton of bricks
