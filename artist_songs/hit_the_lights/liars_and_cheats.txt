I'm in a parking lot 
At the top of a hill 
Cigarettes, broken bottles 
Cheap ways to get my thrills 

I'm in a parking lot
It's a quarter to nine 
Surrounded by some liars and some cheats 
Saying their friends are mine 

And I'm looking for trouble in all the right places 
Finding these angels have filthier faces than mine 
All the time 

I keep company with liars and cheats
I'm running with the likes of scoundrels and thieves 
On the other side of town, a sight you'll never see 
'Cause this is where I need to be 

Yeah, we swear to God 
He hears it all the time 
It's our lack of faith and foul mouths that always keep us last in line 
We'll never see heaven cause we'll all be left deaf, dumb and blind 

And I'm looking for trouble in all the right places 
Finding these angels have filthier faces than mine 
All the time  

I keep company with liars and cheats
I'm running with the likes of scoundrels and thieves 
On the other side of town, the sight you'll never see 
'Cause this is where I need to be 

So much for calling you out 
The taste of hesitation 
Hasn't found my mouth since the nights I slept 
Consuming carcinogens
Twenty-one and convinced, convinced that love doesn't exist 
No, it doesn't exist 

I keep company with liars and cheats
I'm running with the likes of scoundrels and thieves 
On the other side of town, the sight you'll never see 
'Cause this is where I need to be 

(Twenty-one and convinced) 
I keep company with liars and cheats 
(Love doesn't exist) 
Running with the likes of scoundrels and thieves 
(Twenty-one and convinced) 
On the other side of town, a sight you'll never see 
(Love doesn't exist) 
'Cause this is where I need to be
