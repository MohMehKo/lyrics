This is not the end
This is just the beginning
And don't you know everything we want
Is within our reach at fingertips length
We fought nonstop to make these nights our own 
Now no one can take them away

Hands in the air (hands in the air)
No one make a sound (no one make a sound)
While you're in despair, we'll have our ears to the ground 
Listening for the pulse that just might drive these hearts tonight
And I know we won't make it out alive

We could have had it all
Our backs against the wall
Our eyes blindfolded tight
Living what they call life
[x2]

(We could) We could have had it all
(Our backs) Our backs against the wall
(Our eyes) Our eyes blindfolded tight

Hands in the air (hands in the air)
No one make a sound (no one make a sound)
While you're in despair, we'll have our ears to the ground 
Listening for the pulse that just might drive these hearts tonight
And I know we won't make it out alive

We won't make it out alive
When you burn down these bridges
And you build up these walls
And you've torn out these pages
And there's nothing left at all
And when that day comes
And we're all still here
Will you be waiting?
Will you be waiting?

With hands in the air (hands in the air)
No one make a sound (no one make a sound)
While you're in despair, we'll have our ears to the ground 
Listening for the pulse that just might drive these hearts tonight
And I know we won't make it out alive
And I know we won't make it out alive
