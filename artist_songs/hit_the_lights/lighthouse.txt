I gather stones when the weight of the world is too much
Rather suffer than not have enough
Building castles that sink in the sand
In search of land lost in the fog
Made my peace with it, floated on
And then you came along
And help me light my way

And all the times I wasted on someone that wasn't you
Like all along I should've known but now I found the truth
If I could just wake up to you, make love to you
That's all I want to do
So guide me like a lighthouse back to you

I know it's hard
I miss the weight of your head on my chest
I miss keeping you warm in your bed
Making moments we'll never forget
Like the ocean breeze you came along
To lift my sails, to take me home
And when you're gone I can barely stay

And all the times I wasted on someone that wasn't you
Like all along I should've known but now I found the truth
If I could just wake up to you, make love to you
That's all I want to do
So guide me like a lighthouse back to you

And I'll be home, home
Guide me like a lighthouse back to you
And I'll be home, home
I lost my faith but I found my hope in you
And there there is no when weight of the world is too much

All the times I wasted on someone that wasn't you
Like all along I should've known but now I found the truth
If I could just wake up to you, make love to you
That's all I want to do
So guide me like a lighthouse back to you
