I've been carving down the days on my bedroom door.
Teeth are all but gum,
Takin' a beating from grinding when I'm sleeping.
I busted out the boards on my window sill,
nailed shut to keep me here I'm dying.
Nothing can stop me from trying 
To claw my way out this grave,
Before I decay I will make a clean break

And burn it down.
I'll burn this town behind me 
and run until I can't breathe.
I'm breaking out, 
I'll bury all my mistakes 
and rebuild until my back breaks.

Consider them convinced I'm a lunatic.
Eyes are wide and crazed,
I'm feeling hell bent on wreaking havoc.
I sent a stack of bricks thorough the neighbors house,
Watch them as they spill into their yards,
They don't know how lucky they are.
They swat the vultures aside and swear they're alive
But just look in their eyes.

Burn it down.
I'll burn this town behind me 
and run until I can't breathe.
I'm breaking out, 
I'll bury all my mistakes 
and rebuild until my back breaks down.

On my grave stone for all to see it reads
"I took this city out at the knees" at least.
On your grave stone,
Covered in leaves they'll read nothing more than
"Rest In", "Rest In Peace".

(nothing more than)
(nothing more than)
(nothing more than)
(nothing more than)

And burn it down.
I'll burn this town behind me 
and run until I can't breathe.
Maybe I'm breaking out, 
I'll bury all my mistakes 
and rebuild until my back breaks down.
Down (rebuild until my back breaks)
Rebuild until my back breaks
Until my back breaks
