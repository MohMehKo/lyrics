I want a big house that sits by the shore
And when I wake up I can watch the tide rise
All of my friends they would live next door
And every night we'd build a fire in the backyard
We'd listen to all our favorite songs
Watch it burn and we sing along

On and on and on oh oh oh
On and on and on

Woke up this morning it was bitter cold
Pieced together where the car was parked
Now I'm running late to work
I took the back road behind the prison yard
This year is slinking by so slow
This town has watched me come and go

On and on and on oh oh oh
On and on and on

Do you believe that you’re in control?
Of the things that you say you want?
Laying awake watching tv shows
And get the feeling that we are the products
Of generations out searching for gold
They did their best just to stay afloat

On and on and on oh oh oh
On and on and on
The waves crash on and on and on oh oh oh
On and on and on

When you feel the water pull you down
You're caught up in the gravity
Don't let it take you out to drown
Just hold your head above this

Can we go back to the place
Where we were standing at the top
When we were living everyday
Like it’s the last one that we've got
Yeah we'll go back to the days 
That went on and on and on
And we'll get back to the place 
Where waves crashed on and on and on
On and on and on oh oh oh
