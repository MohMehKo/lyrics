I found how to get to her now
I'll whisper in her ear when shes asleep
And beg her to love me
When the morning comes she'll never know
Cause right now I think I'm on my way out
I've been tying bells to window screens
So I can hear her leave in the morning
But it never helps and I never know
Where you like to go when your all alone
And why you can't be reached does anybody know
You're breaking up again, are you listening
To anything I've said

Tell me where you are
And I'll find you
Tell me what it takes to see this through
Tell me what it takes to get to you
And I'll be there waiting

Ohoh ohoh ohoh whoa

She sees through any move that I use
See I've been falling head over her heels
So when she disappears she knows I'll be here waiting up
So I'll vow the moment that she leaves town
Yeah I'll be hopping trains to get away and try to save face
But I know it's never far enough

Still I'll never know
Where you like to go when your all alone
And why you can't be reached does anybody know?
You're breaking up again, are you listening
To anything I say

Tell me where you are
And I'll find you
Tell me what it takes to see this through
Tell me what it takes to get to you
And I'll be there waiting

Waiting for you to come home
(Don't tell me that, when alone I sat, waiting at home)
For word you're not gone
(Don't hold your breath, I'm not coming back, I'm already gone)
Praying that you'll answer
(After all we had, if you have to ask, you already know)
When I ask you to tell me where you are 
(You already know)
