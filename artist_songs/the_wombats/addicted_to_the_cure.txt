Lately, I
Have been speculating 
As to how and why
These circums race whatever I do
Your blonde hair 
Breaks this ten thousand yard stare
Clearly, I 
Am still withdrawing it's true

(ahh ahh ahh)
Somethings not right here
The pain watches me as I dry here
The pain watches me as I waltz through
This black hole
And I don't feel violent 
In fact I feel some way enlightened 
The best parts of us 
Always seem to have the most downfalls

There's a ciggerate in my mouth
A nicotine patch is on the floor
When did we get addicted to the cure?
Ahh ah ahh 
Ahh ahh 
I am addicted to the cure!

Sometimes, I 
Get aggrivated 
With my concept of time
And how the clocks tick backwards on cue
Your blonde hair
Breaks this wristwatch and it's cares
Clearly I 
Am still withdrawing from you

(ahh ahh ahh)
Somethings not right here
The pain watches me as I dry here
The pain watches me as I waltz through
This black hole
And I don't feel violent 
In fact I feel some way enlightened 
The best parts of us 
Always seem to have the most downfalls

There's a ciggerate in my mouth
A nicotine patch is on the floor
When did we get addicted?
When did we get addicted?
But our heads tell us to stop
As our chests scream out for more

I'm proud to be addicted 
Im proud to be addicted to the cure

I am addicted to the cure
I am addicted to the cure

I am addicted to the cure
