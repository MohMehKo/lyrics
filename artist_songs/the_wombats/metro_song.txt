Oooh ooh ooh, ba ba oooh ooh ooh

Don't you think kind of cruel?
My two door rocking rover bean-can is the only thing that reminds me of you
I'm sorry I missed your show last night
It's just my car broke down and mirrored both our lives

Oooh ooh ooh, ba ba oooh ooh ooh

I think I miss my metro, oh
I think I miss my metro, or maybe I just miss you

Don't you think its kind of cool?
My tape-player was bust but it always played for you
Then you slapped me from the passenger seat
I think my car got really pissed off so it failed its M.O.T!

Oooh ooh ooh, ba ba oooh ooh ooh

I think I miss my metro, oh
I think I miss my metro, or maybe I just miss you

He's just my little blue bomb on the A11....

I think I miss my metro, oh
I think I miss my metro, or maybe I just miss you
