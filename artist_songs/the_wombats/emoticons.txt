It's tough to stay objective, baby
With your tongue abseiling down my neck
It's a bulletproof offer I can't accept
It's tough to maintain focus, baby
Now all my elephants are in the room
We crave the fiction when we need the truth

You need to find a different boy's heart to chew
Chew
And all these emoticons and words
Try to make it better but they only make it worse

It's tough to feign indifference, baby
Now I'm spending all the money I have
Trying to impress you's kinda driving me mad
And I don't blame the pressure or the vultures in the sky
I blame what happens every time we're under neon lights
We crave the tension in a room with a view

You need to find a different boy's heart to chew
Chew
And all these emoticons and words
Try to make it better but they only make it worse

And all these emoticons and words
Fail to make it better, their attempts just make it worse

And it's everything I want
And nothing I can keep
Behind these metaphors
I want you literally
We crave the fiction when we need the truth
You need to find a different boy's heart to chew

Chew
And all these emoticons and words
Try to make it better but they only make it worse

But I like it here so much I might stay
The edge of nowhere's such a beautiful place
The edge of nowhere's such a beautiful place
