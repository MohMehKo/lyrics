Once upon a time in a taxi cab
A dirty man touched you with a filthy hand
A foul attempt at comfort turned to bad
But probably the best sex that you ever had

The worst battle is the one not fought
But it’s a damned sight easier to settle out of court
When your moral fibre offers no support
Or when you’ve got the staying power of a just fired pinball

I’m trampolining, I’m trampolining off of you
We draw a thin line, we draw a thin line
I’m trampolining, I’m trampolining off of you
We draw a thin line, between who we love and who we love to use

So let’s just hope there’s no mirrors in the toilets tonight
So we don’t have to see what’s really going on in our eyes
A wholesome society of civic pride
Is more a massive confusion trying to prove that it’s still alive

Keep that princess sitting by the phone
That ugly frog is gonna call and he can bring it all home
He’s heard the new song about the latest trend
It’s now cool to read fairy tales as long as you rip out the end

I’m trampolining, I’m trampolining off of you
We draw a thin line, we draw a thin line
I’m trampolining, I’m trampolining off of you
We draw a thin line, between who we love and who we love to use

We draw a thin line, we draw a thin line
We draw a thin line, we draw a thin line

I’m trampolining, I’m trampolining off of you
We draw a thin line, we draw a thin line
I’m trampolining, I’m trampolining off of you
We draw a thin line, between who we love and who we love to use
