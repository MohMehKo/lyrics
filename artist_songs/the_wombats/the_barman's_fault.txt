Take that cigarette out of your mouth
You know it's bad for you
and I can smell your breath from one mile off

Don't you think that it's time we should move on
Cause now I'm bored too 
and anything that meant anything is gone

And it's the barman's fault

Take my credit cards far away from me
I'm not mature enough to keep one little eye on anything
Don't you place another party with doubt
Maybe your weak now 
cause everything that was anything is out
(Yeah) and it's the barman's fault

You don't call the shots
You don't call the shots
You don't call the shots if you are hanging on

Meet me at the accident and emergency
and I can show you 'round
But my head hurts right now so let's just leave

Why am I placing every single night with doubt
Maybe I'm weak too 
cause everything that meant anything is out
(Yeah) and it's the barman's fault

You don't call the shots
You don't call the shots
You just don't call the shots if are hanging on

(Yeah) you don't call the shots
(Yeah) you don't call the shots
You just can't call the shot if you are hanging on
