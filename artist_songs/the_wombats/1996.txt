I had no cares in the 1990s,
I knew of no downfalls,
Though war was breaking out all around me,
My concerns were with prank calls.

She kissed me on the cheek,
She kissed me on the cheek,
Right in front of the older kids,
When our self belief, our self belief,
Wasn't scarred by the modern itch.

'Cause now it feels like,

We kiss with one eye on our T.V. set,
And the more I give, the less I get,
Needing fairground rides just to spark her smile,
There's little here to miss,
Bring back 1996
Bring back 1996,
So hard to beat those teenage kicks,
Bring back 1996.

We were cloning sheep in the 1990s,
We were building telescopes,
And sugar filled the whole of my body,
As I urged it on to grow.

I kissed her on the cheek,
I kissed her on the cheek,
Just to impress the older kids,
But my self belief, my self belief,
Wasn't lost in the modern glitch.

'Cause now it feels like,

We kiss with one eye on our T.V. set,
And the more I give, the less I get,
Needing fairground rides just to spark her smile,
There's little here to miss,
Bring back 1996,
Bring back 1996.

Stop talking, stop talking,
I need a lover, not a friend tonight,
I'm leaving, I'm leaving,
I'm not cut out for the modern life.

I'll never beat those teenage kicks [x3]
Bring back 1996
