I tried to read Bram Stoker as I waited for the plane to land
But instead I pondered my fate as of the end of this glass
It’s just whenever I’m here the first thing that I will usually drink is the plan
I know there’s something wrong deep inside
I can almost feel the blazing red of her eyes

She’s gonna try and suck my blood tonight
She’s gonna try and suck my blood tonight
She’s gonna try and suck my blood tonight
She’s gonna try and suck my blood tonight

Dear Hamburg
What are you gonna do to me?
Dear Hamburg
Don’t strip me of my dignity

The hotel knew that we would never sleep so it just swallowed our bags
I took a 50 euro note and six Winstons in the palm of my hand
This time, let’s hit the main track [?] and steer from trouble just as far as we can
But as the dribble rolls down my chin
I feel her seething lust burn deep within

Dear Hamburg
Just look at what you’ve done to me
My dear Hamburg!
You’ve stripped me of my dignity
Dear Hamburg
You’ve made a monster out of me
Dear Hamburg
I’m requesting back my dignity

She’s gonna try and suck my blood tonight
And I’ll wear a smile as she starts draining me of life
She’s gonna try and suck my blood tonight
And I’ll wear a smile as she starts draining me of...
She’s gonna try and suck my blood tonight
And I’ll wear a smile as she starts draining me of life
She’s gonna try and suck my blood tonight
And I’ll wear a smile as she starts draining me of life, she’s draining me of life, she’s draining me of life...

My dear Hamburg
Just look at what you’ve done to me
Sweet Hamburg
I’m requesting back my dignity, I’m requesting back my dignity
