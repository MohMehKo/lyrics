My hand hovers over a button of self-destruct
It won’t let me press down, Oh I wish that it would
I’ve lost something that was an integral part of me

She lived in a red- brick house in Halewood
She wore a hearing aid that screamed louder than us
I’ve lost someone that was an integral part of me

Ignorance is bliss, she preached to me
But how can I ignore someone that makes me so happy
Oh Sally where’d you go?

It’s not impeccable wit that makes me smile
But it’s a shock to the heart it only lasts a short while
She had something that made me fall to my knees

She had no respect for the rules of trivial pursuit
And a temper that had never even lit its fuse
Her purple hair and smile were the highlight of my holidays

Ignorance is bliss, she preached to me
But how can I ignore someone that makes me so happy
Oh Sally where’d you go?

How I miss, How I miss Oh How I miss you, Sally Bray
Oh she taught me enough for all the things I could have said
How I love, How I love Oh How I love you Sally Bray
Oh she taught me enough for all the love I could have gave

Oh Sally where’d you go?
