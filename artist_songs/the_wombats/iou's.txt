I’ve seen him flop this show before
Thinking there’s a quick fix for a bachelor’s lonely score
Relax, it’s not conscript to war
You’re so desperate you should wear those flashing devil horns

Just cause she came here alone
Doesn’t mean she’s not got the baggage of a long haul flight
Just cause you’re dancing slow
Doesn’t mean you’re not hanging by a thread of spit tonight

This is not an IOU
This is not an IOU
Don’t let her invoice for services rendered

This is not an IOU
This is not an IOU
Don’t let her invoice for services rendered

Well done, you jumped in the shallow end
When your blood rises up she’ll chuck you in again
It’s holiday time, she’s home with mum and friends
But you’re three months in you can’t shake those jealous breaking ends

That paranoid pulse that beats your head
Well you know that there’s a reason why it beats there
Though she says she loves you on the phone
You know she’s fucking like a vampire in her parents’ home

This is not an IOU
This is not an IOU
Don’t let her invoice for services rendered

This is not an IOU
This is not an IOU
Don’t let her invoice for services rendered

Just cause she came here alone
Doesn't mean she’s not got the baggage of a long haul flight
It seems you learn your lesson slow
And that’s how you get knocked out without knowing that you’re in a fight

This is not an IOU
This is not an IOU
Don’t let her invoice for services rendered

This is not an IOU
This is not an IOU
Don’t let her invoice for services rendered
