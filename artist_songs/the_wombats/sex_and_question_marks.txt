With low hope and little charm
I squeeze a little lime into a massive rum
You were my fuse box, you controlled my mood
What bliss it was to have nothing to prove

When all I really needed was sex and question marks
Life was euphoric when we didn't know much
And now I'm a ghost and you've lost your spark
What happened, oh, what happened to us?

With low hope and little charm
We hogged a cigarette and over-think where it went so wrong
You were my Swiss watch, we made our moves on cue
What bliss it was to have something to lose

When all I really needed was sex and question marks
Life was euphoric when we didn't know much
And now I'm a ghost and you've lost your spark
What happened oh, what happened to us?
What happened oh, what happened to us?

To us...
Oh, what happened to us?
To us...
Oh, what happened, oh, what happened to us?
