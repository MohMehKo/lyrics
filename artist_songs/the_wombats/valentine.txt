Remember when I found a broken branch
And shoved it through your bicycle spokes
And how remorse quickly took its stand
When you hit the deck and broke your nose

You were always the emo type
Strained hair matched to a bitter tone
Well I don’t care much for fashion or socialites
The nihilists always get my vote

All she ever wanted was a little direction
All she ever needed was a friend
All she ever made were the worst impressions
All she ever did was offend
You’re the only one to fail my sex drive
Will you or won’t you?
Valentine, Valentine
Valentine, Valentine

Remember when you laid me on my back
And performed to me my favourite song
And how I shivered upon its climax
And those lips still plague my thoughts ten years on

You were always the emo type
Strained hair matched to a bitter tone
Well I don’t care much for fashion or socialites
The nihilists always get my vote

All she ever wanted was a little direction
All she ever needed was a friend
All she ever made were the worst impressions
All she ever did was offend
You’re the only one to fail my sex drive
Will you or won’t you?
Valentine, Valentine
Valentine, Valentine
Valentine, Valentine
Valentine, Valentine

All she ever wanted was a little direction
Far away from this broken scene
And all I ever needed was some domination
From a girl with low self-esteem
I think we share the same blood type,
Will you or won’t you, Valentine?
