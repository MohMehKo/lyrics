Twas the night before christmas
and all through the house
not a creature was stirring
except for
...a wombat??

i can hear the sleigh bells comign around the bend
here comes the darkest end
christmas is here

it's about nights extend into the overdraft
to scrape out what is left
at the end of the year

it's christmas!

turn back to the future off i've seen it before
maybe every year and more
it's great but not again

"what's that burning! what's that burning!" my mum shreiks down
while she's touching up her brow
for when the family arrive

and the red wine plummets down and we should all be in out beds
but it's right wing versus left
tli the wings fall off out heads

and is this christmas?
is this christmas?
is this christmas, my dear?

is this christmas?
is this christmas?
whatever happened to that festive cheer?

can you hear the sleigh bells coming around the bend
here comes our darkest end
christmas is here

and the ice burns up the hill until we all lose our feet
though it never really snows
it's more like horizontal sleet

and is this christmas?
is this christmas?
is this christmas, my dear?

is this christmas? (oh no it's christmas)
is this christmas? (oh no it's christmas)
whatever happened to that festive cheer? (oh no it's christmas)

don't you just love christmas (oh no it's christmas)
don't you just love christmas (oh no it's christmas)
don't you just love christmas (oh no it's christmas)
don't you just love christmas (oh no it's christmas)
don't you just love christmas (oh no it's christmas)
everybody loves christmas (oh no it's christmas)
everybody loves christmas (oh no it's christmas)
everybody loves
everybody loves
everyone it's christmas!
