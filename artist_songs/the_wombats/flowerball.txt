I've got the cash if you've got the hugs
It's been a rough week, it's been an unproductive month
I swapped contact with reality for a country house
In a bright translucent daydream

Don't you get bored, of them giving you nothing
I only press pause when you press play in my stomach

Flowerball, flowerball
How can you waltz through my bloodstream
And then never call?
You make me shake, like a waveform
You're my work of modern art and I want more

I'll take the punch if you'll sell the kick
It's been a while since we tripped the light
Fantastic, I wanna hear guitars and cymbals sing
I'm tired of deciphering her senile fax machine

Don't you get bored, of them giving you nothing
I only press pause when you press play in my stomach

Flowerball, flowerball
How can you waltz through my bloodstream
And then never call?
You make me shake, even though I'm warm
You're my work of modern art and I want more
I want more!

Like a funeral needs an audience
And like a skeptic needs a church
It's not fun unless it hurts
Flowerball
How can you waltz through my bloodstream
And then never call?
You make me shake, shake like a waveform
You're my work of modern art and I want more
I want more!
