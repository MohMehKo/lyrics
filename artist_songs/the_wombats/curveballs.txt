There's no greater sight
Than you in your underwear removing mine
And I've never felt this good
There's not a news flash that could deflate my mood

Then, oh his clothes on your floor
And, oh, I recognize this decor
I've been here before

And I can't, I can't keep, keeping up with these curveballs
And the more I try the more my back's against the wall
And I can't, I can't keep, keeping up with these curveballs
Curveballs

Who and why, how?
I tend to focus on the past and not the now
I'll be over this soon
But some images adhere like super glue

Oh, six hands in one bed
Oh, could he not afford the rent?
This feeling won't end

And I can't, I can't keep, keeping up with these curveballs
And the more I try the more my back's against the wall
And I can't, I can't keep, keeping up with these curveballs
Curveballs

What you d'expect me to say
When the paintings I paint
Start to leap out their frames?
Sweetheart, what d'you want me to say?

And I can't, I can't keep, keeping up with these curveballs
And the more I dodge the more my back's against the wall
And I can't, I can't keep, keeping up with these curveballs
Curveballs
