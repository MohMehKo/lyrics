Am I in a scene from 'Midsummer Nights Dream'? 
I thought raves like these died in the 90s? 
The forest is breathing along with us tonight 
Upper Class thugs take middle-class drugs 
And we all get lowered in size 
This is not my scene, I should not be here tonight 

Laura, ooh oh oooh oooh oh
Laura, ooh oh oooh oooh oh 
Laura you could get me home tonight 

Trance music bangs a comical dance of cardboard boxes and fish 
We're the fairies from hell and we're all on a death wish 
This is not my scene, this is killing me 
I don't want to be here tonight 
And the girl who can save me is well across the Pennines 

Laura, ooh oh oooh oooh oh 
Laura, ooh oh oooh oooh oh
Laura you could get me home tonight 

Laura, ooh oh oooh oooh oh
Laura, ooh oh oooh oooh oh 
Laura you could get me home tonight
