Did you get that house, the one with the swimming pool?
The one you never shut up about
I heard you got that job, and the extra pay works well for you,
Are you getting high and not coming down?

I need to decipher the differences between
What I'll always want and what I'll never need

I don't need your
I don't need your swinging moods
Your 21st Century Blues
I want your hugs not your scissor kicks
I don't need your
Your broken plans or your panda eyes
Nor how to improve my social life
If my heads in the clouds, in the clouds I'll live
In the clouds I'll live

They say you found someone with style to match their charm and wit
But are you having sex in the morning sun?
And is your head screwed tight or has success began to loosen it?
Is the tip of the iceberg that much fun?

Oh, help me decipher the differences between
What I'll always want and what I'll never need

I don't need your
I don't need your swinging moods
Your 21st Century Blues
I want your hugs not your scissor kicks
I don't need your
Your broken plans or your panda eyes
Nor how to improve my social life
If my heads in the clouds, in the clouds I'll live
If my heads in the clouds, then in the clouds I'll live

And I don't need your swinging moods
Your 21st Century Blues
And if nobody comes, then nothing has to leave
If my heads in the clouds, in the clouds I wanna be

I don't need your
If my heads in the clouds, then in the clouds I'll live
