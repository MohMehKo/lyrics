Well your bands not great
And you've all got cheap guitars
And you're lining up backstage
Using your oyster cards

You could be my girl on the scene
We'd make the covers of the magazines
But I'd rather get a fork through the spleen
Than take you home with me

Right click save, oh, right click save
I'll take the best of you and toss the rest away
Right click save, oh, right click save
I'm getting out of here before mistakes get made

Well your hair is quite cool
And you play the synthesisers well
But you sing out of tune
And you've got the ego from hell

And you could be my girl on the scene
We'd get front row at London fashion week
But I'd rather get a fork through the spleen
Than take you home with me

Right click save, oh, right click save
I'll take the best of you and toss the rest away
Right click save, oh, right click save
Show me a bent excuse and I'll make it straight

Shift, delete
Sweet shift, delete
I've got a shortcut for all eventuality

Right click save, oh, right click save
I'll take the best of you and toss the rest away
Away

And all that I know
Is that it gets harder, harder
To say, to say no
And it gets harder, harder

And all that I know
Is that it gets harder, harder
To right click save, oh, right click save
I'll take the best of you and toss the rest away
Away
