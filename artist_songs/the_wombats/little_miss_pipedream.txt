I think the postman intercepts everything I'm trying to send to you
Cause he's infatuated and he's the fulcrum between us two
And I can't say I blame him cause I'd cheat a priest just to get to you
Oooooo...
She works in a dental practice 9 'till 5 how does she manage? 
Considering her nights don't pass out 'till 3
So I guess that flossing is the last thing in her health routine
Oooooo...
And I don't mind that she gets hammered and goes home with other guys
There's no jealousy cause she's little Miss Pipedream fantasy
Oooooo...
I saw her slam back tequila's like Oliver Reed on an Irish stag doo
And I'll wait if you stay cause foggy London town's not built for me or you 
Don't leave Miss Pipedream cause I love you
Oooooo...
And I don't mind that she gets hammered and goes home with other guys
There's no jealousy though she'll grind it out with friends but not with me
She's my little pipedream fantasy
Oooooo...
