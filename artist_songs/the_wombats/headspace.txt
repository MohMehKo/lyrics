Headspace, I need a route of my headspace
Cause it's a war in here and I need you take
Take her out of my headspace

Gonna drive, drive, drive this Cadillac
Up the ocean road until it runs out of gas
Cause I'm hurt
I laugh and I joke but I'm hurt
I'm gonna sing, sing, sing my new swan song
So all the bright young sparks have got a tune they can hum
But it'll hurt
I'll dance if they ask but it'll hurt

Headspace I need a route of my headspace
There's it's a war in here and I need you take
Take her out of my headspace
These 5.5 liters of blood
Have some sour taste
For your sweet taste buds

Cause now I feel, feel, feel like a disco ball
From the 1970's all dusty and worn
And it hurts, I reflect the light, but it hurts
I use to run, run, run until my knees gave way
I use to wrestle with bears and kiss poisonous snakes
I didn't care, they scratch and they bite I didn't care
I didn't care

Headspace I need a route of my headspace
Cause it's a war in here and I need somebody to say
Take her out of my headspace
These 5.5 liters of blood
Have some sour taste
For your sweet taste buds

You put a war zone inside me
Above and below the neck
Above and below the neck

Someone flick a light on
The dark just makes it worse
I'm running out of options and I'm lost for words
Little life wrecker, are you gonna let me know?
Or keep showing me the compassion of a talk show host?
I'm not acting my age here and I'm growing up too fast
If these streets are paved with gold
I want my money back
Cause Liverpool feels like a clouded memory
Now the Californian air has wrapped their claws around me
(Head space, my head space)
She wrapped her claws around me
(Head space, my head space)
