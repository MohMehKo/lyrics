It's the sociopaths that scare me,
Not the fall of my local bank,
At least they're only burning money,
They won't be laughing as they're chopping off my hands.

One day I'll learn to box clever,
And beat the past back in its place,
I'll never get rid of this false endeavor,
But I'll wipe the grin off its dirty little face, 
Oh I'll wipe the grin off its dirty little face.

Why wait 'til the summertime,
Just to say goodbye,
You're so infuriating,
Why wait 'til the summertime,
To hand me a p45,
Was I that infuriating? 
Was I that infuriating? 

You don't notice that I don't hate you,
But one day I must learn how to,
The next I'll learn exactly how to put up a fight.

It's not the illuminati that scares me,
It's the people further down in the ranks,
The creatures like you that are so controlling,
As to lead a God fearing boy out the devil's pack,
Why would you lead a God fearing boy out the devil's pack?

Why wait 'til the summertime,
Just to say goodbye,
You're so infuriating,
Why wait 'til the summertime,
To deflate my legal high,
Was I that infuriating? 
Was I that infuriating? 

One day I'll learn how to box clever,
And beat the wrong doers away,
I wear no mask or tight polyester,
But you can rest assure that I'm on a little caped crusade,
You can rest assure that I'm on a little caped crusade.

Why wait 'til the summertime,
Just to say goodbye,
You're so infuriating,
Why wait 'til the summertime,
To hand me a p45,
Was I that infuriating? 
Was I that infuriating?

You don't notice that I don't hate you,
But one day I must learn how to,
The next I'll learn exactly how to put up a fight.
