Grandad George said the heroes are the ones that run away, 
But I wear no medals I'm sprawled in a toilet on my birthday, 
Welcome to my circuitboard city of yellow and black, 
We all score WD40 so our hearts don't crack, 
I must admit I need a speedbump, 
To slow down my higher brain. 

Have a dance, 
Have a drink, 
Suppress it back ruin everything, 
Have a dance, 
Have a drink, 
Suppress it back ruin everything tonight, 
Lets ruin everything tonight. 

I've got a note, 
I've got a note, from my doctor, 
So please release me from your rat-race melodrama, 
I'll throw a spanner in the works, 
I want more chaos of this order, 
I'll throw a spanner in the works, I want more chaos of this order, 

Have a dance, 
Have a drink, 
Suppress it back, ruin everything 
Have a dance, 
Have a drink 
Suppress it back, ruin everything 
Have a dance, 
Have a drink 
Suppress it back, ruin everything 
Have a dance, 
Have a drink, 
Suppress it back, ruin everything tonight 

Can’t wait to wallow in self pity 
In my circuit board city tonight 
I can’t wait to wallow in self pity 
In my circuit board city tonight 
I can’t wait to wallow in self pity 
In my circuit board city tonight 
I can’t wait to wallow in self pity 
In my circuit board city tonight
