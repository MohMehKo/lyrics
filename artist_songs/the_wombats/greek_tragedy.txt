We're smashing mics in karaoke bars
You're running late with half your makeup on
This method acting might pay our bills
But soon enough they'll be a different role to fill

I love this feeling
But I hate this part
I wanted this to work so much
I drew up our plans on a chart
Cars are flipping, I'm in hot pursuit
My character's strong, but my head is loose

She hits like ecstasy
Comes up and bangs the sense out of me

The tarot cards say it's not so bad
And the blades rotate, there's just no landing pad
And better have said it, but darling you're the best
I'm just tired of falling up the penrose steps

I hate this feeling
But I love this part
She really wants to make it work
And I clearly want to let it start
We'll build a waterslide
As soon as I get home

Oh and she hits like ecstasy
Comes up and bangs the sense out of me
It's wrong, but surely worst to leave
And she hits like ecstasy

So free up the cheaper seats
Here comes the Greek Tragedy
