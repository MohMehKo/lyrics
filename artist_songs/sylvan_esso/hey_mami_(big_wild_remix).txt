She walking so fast,
She walking so fast,
She walk like a babe, hey,
Her image it lasts and I know,
She floats along as she goes,
She owns the eyes as she flies right through the sound,
Moving her body all around (all around)...

Flies right through the sound,
Moving her body all around (all around)
...

(All around, all around, all around)
(All around, all around)
(All around, all around, all around)
(All around, all around)

(Flies right through the sound)
(Moving her body all around)
(Flies right through the sound)
(Moving her body all)
...
