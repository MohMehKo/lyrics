It's not me you're talking to
Gently dancing in my room
Through the light beam arc
I'm all stops and starts
I'm all space and stars

I'm a brilliant machine
Composed of softer things
Compression ache
Scale bends and sways
Another nova on the way

Though the constant is constant, I'm breaking up
The choices I make will all fade to dust
While the matter is shifting, I'm waking up
I remember, I remember what I thought I was

It's not me you're watching move
Slam dancing 'round my room
Faster, faster 'til I bloom

Keep on bloomin', keep on bloomin'
Dragging me down, though I keep moving
Keep on bloomin', keep on bloomin'
Dragging me down, though I keep moving

Though the constant is constant, I'm breaking up
As I grow I'm so tired, but I'm too big to stop
While the matter is shifting, I'm waking up
I remember, I remember what I thought I was

Though the constant is constant, I'm breaking up
As I grow I'm so tired, but I'm too big to stop
While the matter is shifting, I'm waking up
I remember, I remember what I thought I was

Keep on blooming (keep on blooming)
Keep on blooming (keep on blooming)
Keep on blooming (keep on blooming)
Keep on blooming
