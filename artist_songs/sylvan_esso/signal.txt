Little birdie making car alarm sounds
In the tree next to your house
Little baby know to smile for the picture
Then go back to drawing that flower
And a smokey chimney too
And an arrow pointing at their room
And the stars above
Was that a satellite you drew, my love?

It's a signal in the noise
It's a bell in a mine
It's a black dog in a junkyard
Gonna chase you down in time
Chase you down in time

Can you catch up to the cars on the highway?
Run them down
Can you throw yourself off of an airplane?
Breath ripped out
While you showboat
While you slow float
While the Earth gets large and loud
Are you breathing now?
Here's the ground

Don't you want to catch you
Don't you want to catch you
Make you feel your pulse
Make your feet fly
Don't you want to catch you
Don't you want to catch you
Drag you down in the dirt
Make you feel alive

It's a signal in the noise
It's a bell in a mine
It's a black dog in a junkyard
Gonna chase you down in time

It's a signal in the noise
It's a bell in a mine
It's a black dog in a junkyard
Gonna chase you down in time

It's a signal in the noise
It's a bell in a mine
It's a black dog in a junkyard
Gonna chase you down in time
