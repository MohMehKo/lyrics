When the sounds come together so close to my face
It's no wonder we wonder
What's taking place
Oh I feel like an animal in the night, play it right
Play it right
Play it right
Play it right
Play it right
Play it right
Play it right

Oh, if my ears
Were as big as the ocean
I could hear all of your devotion
I would be more than a small human with her head
Pressed against your mouth in motion
Play it right
Play it right
Play it right
Play it right
Play it right
Play it right

And we will move just like we're in a movie
We will speak so warm and smoothly
We are like the people we came from
We are dancing and advancing to the light
Play it right
Play it right
Play it right
Play it right
Play it right
We play right
I'll play right
