I had it all planned that way before you met me
Was gonna leave early and so swiftly
Maybe in a fire or crash off a ravine
People would weep, "How tragic, so early"

I was gonna die young
Now I gotta wait for you, hun
Now I gotta wait for you, hun
Now I gotta wait for you, hun

I was a firecracker, baby, with something to prove
Now I gotta contend with the living blues
I could've missed it, and never knew
Chain reaction but you're holding the fuse

I was gonna die young
Now I gotta wait for you, hun
Now I gotta wait for you, hun (honey)
Now I gotta wait for you, hun

Oh, I don't mind
I got the fire
Electric life
So high, so wild
It's not like I chose
Not like I tried
But now I gotta wait around
And watch you burn so bright
I was gonna die

I had it all planned that way before you met me
I had a plan, you ruined it completely
I had it all planned that way before you met me
I had a plan, you ruined it completely

I was gonna die young
(I had it all planned that way before you met me)
Now I gotta wait for you, hun
(I had a plan, you ruined it completely)
Now I gotta wait for you, hun (honey)
(I had it all planned that way before you met me)
Now I gotta wait for you, hun
(I had a plan, you ruined it completely)

I was gonna die young (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Now I gotta wait for you, hun (I was gonna, I was gonna)
Now I gotta wait for you, hun (oh, oh)
Now I gotta wait for you, hun (oh yeah, yeah, yeah)

I had it all planned that way before you met me
I had a plan, you ruined it completely
I had it all planned that way before you met me
I had a plan, you ruined it completely
