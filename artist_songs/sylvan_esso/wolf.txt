The modern wolf
He's kinder
But see him weep
It's a reminder
Don't wear no suits
We're talking t-shirts
See how he glides
Makes women shiver

Ahoooooo, Ahoooooo

He ain't no Jack
His voice is smoother
Been bending notes
Just like his father
Ahooo but no birds or beasts does he eat
He only wants the tenderest meat
And oh the sounds he makes them speak
Under all different patterns of sheets
Colors blind
Oh, dopamine
And she looked so good when they were last seen

Ahoooooo, Ahoooooo

The modern wolf, the modern wolf
Dripping in all the lives that he took
He'll go on home
Try to wash them off
But when he shaves he hears them call

Ahoooooo, Ahoooooo
