Give me a reason and I'll fall in like
I'll fall all over myself trying
I try until I build it up, I
Pretend 'til it's real enough, 'cause
I was made to act it out
I was made to twist and shout, oh
I was made to be the one you
Thought you remembered from the song

Yes, I'm the song that you can't get out of your head, oh
I'm the song that's bringing you to bed
I'm the song that's promising you all your wants
And needs and needs and needs and needs
Oh, how you want it to be real and it can be
Oh, if you only live in me, it can be
Oh, if you only live in me

Gimme the thing that I saw once when
I was younger and hadn't enough when
All I knew of bad love
Was in a page in a board room full of grown ups
'Cause I can feel how it feels
Even though it isn't real
It's living on the tip of my tongue
I listened to it forever once

Yes, I'm the song that you can't get out of your head, oh
I'm the song that's bringing you to bed
I'm the song that's promising you all your wants
And needs and needs and needs and needs
Oh, how you want it to be real, and it can be
Oh, if you only live in me, it can be
Oh, if you only live in me, it can be

I'm the song that you can't get out of your head, oh
I'm the song that's bringing you to bed
I'm the song that's promising you all your wants
And needs and needs and needs and needs
Oh, how you want it to be real, and it can be
Oh, if you only live in me, it can be
Oh, if you only live in me, it can be

It can be, it can be, it can be
(Oh, if you only live in me)
It can be, it can be, it can be
(Oh, if you only live in me)
It can be
