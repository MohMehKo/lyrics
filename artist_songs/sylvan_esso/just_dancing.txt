We begin again
We knew before it happened
It's always the same
The lights quit, the music shifts
And then I get to see you again
Just like every weekend

I'm just dancing
I'm faking it before I even touch the skin
It's a rigged game
And I know how to win it
Shine the light from my hand
It's just pretend
But it feels so good when we begin
So let's freeze it now before it ends
Let's never stop starting
Never stop starting

It's just like it was then
But without all the fighting
No ruin in the end
Just you and me with a beat
We build back what we broke back then
It's reverse collision

I'm just dancing
I'm faking it before I even touch the skin
It's a rigged game
And I know how to win it
Shine the love light from my hand
It's just pretend
But it feels so good when we begin
So let's freeze it now before it ends
Let's never stop starting

You're always different but I'm always the same
But when we're dancing you look just like my man
Come on baby, come on baby
Let's never stop, never stop, never stop starting
You never can seem to remember my name
But when we're dancing I am in love again
Come on baby, come on baby
Let's never stop, never stop, never stop starting
(Never stop, never stop, never stop...)

We begin again
We knew before, we begin again
Just dancing, we knew before, we begin again
Just dancing, we knew before, we begin again
Just dancing, we knew before, we begin again

I'm just dancing
I'm faking it before I even touch the skin
It's a rigged game
And I know how to win it
Shine the love light from my hand
It's just pretend
But it feels so good when we begin
So let's freeze it now before it ends
Let's never stop starting

You're always different but I'm always the same
But when we're dancing you look just like my man
Come on baby, come on baby
Let's never stop, never stop, never stop starting
You never can seem to remember my name
But when we're dancing I am in love again
Come on baby, come on baby
Let's never stop, never stop, never stop starting

You're always different but I'm always the same
But when we're dancing you look just like my man
Come on baby, come on baby
Let's never stop, never stop, never stop starting
You never can seem to remember my name
But when we're dancing I am in love again
Come on baby, come on baby
Let's never stop, never stop, never stop starting
