I came from nothing, ain't that something?
Look what I've been through
And now I'm out here, feel like my year
Got all my friends through
Cause I want this life for life, for life
This life for life, for life
Cause I want this life for life, for life
This life for life, for life
Cause I want it for life

It's fadin' all night
Look at my ride, look at my life
Waking the night
Dreamed of this life, I'll be so patient
Waited all night
You know now I'm flexing, I'm fucking these hoes
Rollie is finally Rolls
Touring the club and I'm killing these shows
And I'm stacking, I'm stacking these hoes
Bad bitch into my arm and she ain't never tell me no
I just hit the crib with a brand new bitch
They both gon' find that pole
Cause they all down to go, they been kissing on the low
They been sniffing on that blow when I never trust a hoe
Cause everybody wanna get paid, I ain't no free ride
If I come inside, it's the best day of her life

I came from nothing, ain't that something?
Look what I've been through
And now I'm out here, feel like my year
Got all my friends through
Cause I want this life for life, for life
This life for life, for life
Cause I want this life for life, for life
This life for life, for life
Cause I want it for life

My whole squad real G's, pour it up
Bring on my weed, roll it up
The whole world mine
Yeah, I know the whole world mine
Feel mad rich, never sold my soul
When I told my pops that I caught that Rove
And I told my mom to forget that stove
And to fuck that job cause I got that, that dough
Yeah, you know I got that money to blow
Yeah, you know that's how it goes
I puts it down, I puts it down
I don't fuck around, I don't fuck around
Had no time for chilling or sipping, was rapping and singing
I came up on my own, now I got all that money calling

Cause I came from nothing, ain't that something?
Look what I've been through
And now I'm out here, feel like my year
Got all my friends through
Cause I want this life for life, for life
This life for life, for life
Cause I want this life for life, for life
This life for life, for life
Cause I want it for life
