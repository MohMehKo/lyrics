Come on, tell me do you want me
Do you need me like drugs need money
Tell me once more who's your love for?
What's your number when you're sober?

Clearly I'm not thinkin' clearly
When I'm, when I'm, with you, with you
Feels like time is movin' slower

And then the music pulls us closer
Oh when I start to think it over
I realize
You never call me when you're sober
You never call me when you're sober
I realize

Clearly I'm not thinkin' clearly
When I'm, when I'm, with you, with you
Nearly Heaven when you're near me
Fallin', fallin', for you, for you
We're addicted to this feeling
When I'm, when I'm, with you, with you
Feels like time is movin' slower

And then the music pulls us closer
Oh when I start to think it over
I realize
You never call me when you're sober
You never call me when you're sober
I realize
You never call me when you're sober

Pour me one more, then another
Keep me love drunk
You never call me when you're sober
Pour me one more, then another
Keep me love drunk

Come on, tell me do you want me
Do you need me like drugs need money
Tell me once more who's your love for?
Love for, love for, love for
You never call me when you're sober

Pour me one more, then another
Keep me love drunk
Pour me one more, then another
Keep me love drunk
You never call me when you're sober
Pour me one more, then another
Keep me love drunk
Pour me one more, then another
Keep me love drunk
You never call me when you're sober
