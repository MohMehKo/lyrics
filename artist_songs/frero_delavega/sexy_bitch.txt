Yes I can see her
Cause every girl in here wanna be her
Oh she's a diva, feel the same and I wanna meet her
They say she low down
It's just a rumor and I don't believe 'em
She needs to slow down
The baddest thing around town
She's nothing like a girl you've ever seen before
Nothing you can compare to your neighborhood hoe
I'm trying to find the words to describe this girl
Without being disrespectful
The way that booty moving I can't take no more
I have to stop what I'm doing so I can put on my clothes
I'm trying to find the words to describe this girl
Without being disrespectful
Damn girl
Damn girl you're a sexy bitch (Damn girl)
