Go on and close the curtains
Cause all we need is candle light
You and me and a bottle of wine
Going to hold you tonight
Well we know I'm going away
And how I wish, I wish it weren't so
So take this wine and drink with me
Let's delay our misery, oh
Save tonight
And fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow
Tomorrow I'll be gone
Save tonight
And fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow
Tomorrow I'll be gone
There's a log on the fire
And girl, it burns like me for you
Tomorrow comes with one desire
To take me away, yes it's true
It ain't easy to say goodbye
Darling please don't start to cry
Cause girl you know I've got to go, oh
Lord I wish it wasn't so
Save tonight
And fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow
Tomorrow I'll be gone
Save tonight
And fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow
Tomorrow I'll be gone
Tomorrow I'll be gone
Tomorrow I'll be gone
Tomorrow I'll be gone
Tomorrow I'll be gone
Tomorrow comes to take me away
I wish that I, that I could stay
Oh girl you know I've got to go, oh
Lord I wish it wasn't so
Save tonight
And fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow
Tomorrow I'll be gone
Save tonight
And fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow
Tomorrow I'll be gone
Tomorrow I'll be gone
Tomorrow I'll be gone
Tomorrow I'll be gone
