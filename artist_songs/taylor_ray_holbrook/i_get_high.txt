When I think I've finally got it right, it hits me, it ain't right yet.
When the dark turns to day I pray to see another sunset.
Fallin' in and out of the same routine, stackin' that paper, chasin' that green.

I get high.
High up on a mountain lookin' down at everything.
I get lost, listenin' to the rhythm of a backwoods symphony.
You've got yours, and I've got mine...
I get high.

When I think I get a step ahead it hits me, two steps back.
I don't give and I give it all I've got then I tip my hat, that's right!
I rise up above these busy city streets, livin' off love, chasin' my dreams.

I get high.
High up on a mountain lookin' down at everything.
I get lost, listenin' to the rhythm of a backwoods symphony.
You've got yours, and I've got mine...
So let's get high.
High up on a mountain lookin' down at everything.
I get lost, listenin' to the rhythm of a backwoods symphony.
You've got yours, and I've got mine...
So let's get high.

So high like we're never comin' down, like a water tower watchin' all the lights go out.
Way higher than we've ever, ever been before...

I get high.
High up on a mountain lookin' down at everything.
I get lost, listenin' to the rhythm of a backwoods symphony.
You've got yours, and I've got mine...
And one day we'll get it right, 'til then, I'll be high.
I get high.
