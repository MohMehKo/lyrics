Girl I know you're busy and that ain't nothing new
Girl lay it on the line cause there's nothing left to lose
Gonna call it like it is I'm done being used
You don't wanna be together but you know it ain't true
And all I can say is I don't know how to say it
You're the high I keep chasing and I'm the song you keep playing
And never let it fade out

Everytime it's feeling right
You go and do me wrong
And by the morning light
You wanna turn it off
So tell me why I play the fool again

When I start to let it go
You go and pull me in
Until I get to close
And then you're over this
Yeah but you still wanna steal my kiss

I don't mean to bother just thought you'd like to know
I won't be picking up just to be that old hello
It's a two am tequila another last call
It's only when you're lonely that you want me at all
And all I can say is I don't know how to say it
But you're the high I keep chasing and I'm the song you keep playing
And never let it fade out

Everytime it's feeling right
You go and do me wrong
And by the morning light
You wanna turn it off
So tell me why I play the fool again

When I start to let it go
You go and pull me in
Until I get to close
And then you're over this
Yeah but you still wanna steal my kiss

Covers, covers, pretend there's no other
Until I discover we're laying on a bed of lies
I try to give in give all my attention
Were wasted on a change of mind
So tell me why

Everytime it's feeling right
You go and do me wrong
And by the morning light
You wanna turn it off
So tell me why I play the fool again

When I start to let it go
You go and pull me in
Until I get to close
And then you're over this
Yeah but you still wanna steal my kiss
Steal my kiss
Steal my kiss
