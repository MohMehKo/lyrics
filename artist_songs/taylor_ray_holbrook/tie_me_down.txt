We turned one night into two
It wasn't my intention but you've got my attention with
Everything you do
Now I know I, I can't get you out of my mind so I hold it inside

I knew that it was coming but I didn't see it coming now
Little did I know you had the finger I'd be wrapped around
One look at you and I saw everything I'd ever need
And you don't know what you do to me
I'm down to give it all up
If you're up to tie me down
If you're up to tie me down

We turned two worlds into one
Everything we said we'd do's been said and done
And my oh my I can't get you out of my mind
So why would I even try

I knew that it was coming but I didn't see it coming now
Little did I know you had the finger I'd be wrapped around
One look at you and I saw everything I'd ever need
And you don't know what you do to me
I'm down to give it all up
If you're up to tie me down
(Treat my heart like a secret)
If you're up to tie me down
(Promise me that you'll keep it)
(Treat my heart like a secret)
(You're the reason it's beating)

I knew that it was coming but I didn't see it coming now
Little did I know you had the finger I'd be wrapped around
One look at you and I saw everything I'd ever need
And baby you don't know what you do to me
I'm down to give it all up oh
I'm down to give it all up oh
I'm down to give it all up oh
If you're up to tie me down
If you're up to tie me down

You won't see it coming but one day you're gonna turn around
And I'll put a ring on the finger I've been wrapped around
