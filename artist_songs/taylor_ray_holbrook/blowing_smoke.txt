Creeky choir, barbed wire, bottle tops on the tailgate
The night sky through her eyes two young souls tryna get away
Talkin' bout love and how we'd never let it go
Talkin' bout dreams like we knew who we were but we didn't know

Ah, blowing smoke
Blowing smoke
Blowing smoke
Ah, we're just blowing smoke
Ah, we're just blowing smoke
Ah, blowing smoke
Ah, we're just blowing smoke
Ah, blowing smoke
Blowing smoke
Blowing smoke
Ah, we just blowing...

Wedding rings, growing old, yeah that'd be nice if that's how it goes
Some day you'll see I can get you all the finer things
Talkin' bout love and how we'd never let it go
Talkin' bout dreams like we knew who we were but we didn't know

Ah, blowing smoke
Blowing smoke
Blowing smoke 
Ah, we're just blowing smoke
Ah, we're just blowing smoke
Ah, blowing smoke
Ah, we're just blowing smoke
Ah, blowing smoke 
Blowing smoke
Blowing smoke
Ah, we're just blowing smoke
