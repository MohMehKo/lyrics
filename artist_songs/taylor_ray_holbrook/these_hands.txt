Saturday night, seeing you out
Pulling you in, you're looking around
The look in your eyes, I've already found
Why you're so on edge I'm figuring out

What makes you tick, what makes you hot
What did he throw in the boat to make it rock
So many questions on why and why not
But on second thought

These hands were made to hold you,
And I wanna get to show you
Can't believe the things you've been through
Issues, trusting him to stick with you
Now close your eyes while I kiss you
Cuz I know
These hands were made to hold you
Hold you

Baby I'm down for taking it slow
Well go as fast as you wanna go
And when the time's right
And you feel like
Sugar let me know

What did he say, what did he do
Why don't you put it on me what he put you through
Tell me your story, forget it
Lets get on to me and you

And these hands that wanna hold you
And I wanna get to showing you
Can't believe the things you've been through
Issues, trusting him to stick with you
Now close your eyes while I kiss you
Cuz I know
These hands were made to hold you
Hold you

These hands were made to hold you
I wanna get to showing you
Can't believe the things you've been through
Issues, trusting him to stick with you
Now close your eyes while I kiss you
Cuz I know

These hands were made to hold you [x5]
