Hey girl
I know it's been a long time
But I was hoping that you might
Ditch this thing and roll off into the night with me
Hey girl
Lemme paint the scene
You can blare the radio
Put on a shotgun show
You know what I mean

Ever been the only pair of headlights hoggin' up a two lane
Something about the look in her eyes
Getting me high, taking my breath away
Makes me wanna take a shot in the dark
Put her in park
Pull off and get turned on
Aww we were somewhere
Lovin' in the middle of nowhere
Lovin' in the middle of nowhere

Hey girl
I know I'm throwing this on ya
But I can tell you go with the flow don't ya
The way you move you're making me want you, want you, want you like
My girl
You're my little temptation
And you know I love and I hate it
When you're keeping me waiting
Girl you're driving me crazy
But I'm driving you baby so

Ever been the only pair of headlights hoggin' up a two lane
Something about the look in her eyes
Getting me high taking my breath away
Makes me wanna take a shot in the dark
Put her in park
Pull off and get turned on
Aww we were somewhere
Lovin' in the middle of nowhere
Lovin' in the middle of nowhere

Hey girl
I know I'm throwing this on ya
But I can tell you to go with the flow don't you
I can tell you go with the flow don't you, don't you, don't you

Ever been the only pair of headlights hoggin' up a two lane
Something about the look in her eyes
Getting me high taking my breath away
Makes me wanna take a shot in the dark
Put her in park
Pull off and get turned on
Aww we were somewhere
Lovin' in the middle of nowhere
Lovin' in the middle of nowhere
