I don't know who you are or where you've been
I don't care about your past or who you're with
But I can picture us on a porch swing swangin'
As the sun sits sinking in your eyes
And I can't wait for the day
When your world meets mine

I'm gonna love you like no tomorrow
Wherever you go, know I will follow
You need steady, I'll be your rock
When life is too fast honey you just walk
These arms they wanna hold you
And I can't wait to show you who I am
So until then
Dear Topanga

I close my eyes I see us laughing hand and hand
And everyday you're teaching me to be a better man
Picture us on a little farm farming
With a family growing roots deep
And I can't wait for the day
When you find your way to me

I'm gonna love you like no tomorrow
Wherever you go, know I will follow
You need steady, I'll be your rock
When life is too fast honey you just walk
These arms they wanna hold you
And I can't wait to show you who I am
So until then
Dear Topanga
Dear Topanga

I'm gonna love you like no tomorrow
Wherever you go, know I will follow
I'll be Jonny and you'll be June
And I hope you're coming soon
These arms they wanna hold you
And I can't wait to show you who I am
So until then
Dear Topanga
Dear Topanga
Dear Topanga
