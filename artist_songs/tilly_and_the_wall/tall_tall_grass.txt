When I was young I used to sleep up in the garden
Wait to sneak in when the house grew quiet
Now that I'm grown I can't seem to find it 
There is no tall tall grass for me to hide in.

When there wasn't anywhere for me to go, oh, 
I stumbled into deep love with your rock and roll. [x2]

I can't believe that we were ever friends at all
I, I didn't see it. Can you forgive me?
I've been scared to say, 
I've lined them up to fall and I want to change.

When there wasn't anywhere for me to go, oh, I stumbled into deep love with your rock and roll. [x2]
When there wasn't anywhere for me to go, oh, I fell into deep love with your rock and roll.
When there wasn't anywhere for me to go, oh, I stumbled into deep love with your rock and roll.

The world outside seems to be glowing 
Like a heart beating
The snow will cover everything.
