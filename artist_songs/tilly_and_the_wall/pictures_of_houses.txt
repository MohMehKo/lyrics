I took picture of houses with the light all behind them
It reminded me of time I spent with you
It was beautiful
It was beautiful
It was beautiful
Oh, to think of you

The unbreakable humming of the birds outside my window 
Drawn away all I used to ignore
It was so simple 
It was so simple 
It was so simple 
Oh, to be with you

1, 2, 3, 4!
Oh come on say it play me before words lose their meaning
Surround me and everyone that I love

I can feel things are changing, 
Summertime is slowly sinking in
I remember that and still believe
In purity 
In purity 
In purity 
Oh, I still believe

Will I ever wake from this dream to 
untie all the ships sailing away from me
It will be beautiful
It will be beautiful
It will be beautiful
Oh, to watch them leave
Oh yeah
