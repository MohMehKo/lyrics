Oh, I just don't get it, can't seem to make sense
I got some jumbled up thoughts in my jumbled up head
I keep stumbling around on some jumbled up legs
I keep grumbling out some jumbled up text

Holding up both sides on the side of the road
Holding up your store, holding up your home
With the evening news of filth and wounds
A picket and a funeral on Sunday afternoon

Oh, that light shines bright in your eyes
You gotta find your confidence, learn your lines
Pick your class, pick your crime
Better take a breath, take it quick
'Cause it's piling up, yeah, the layer's getting thick

And, oh, I just can't seem to find the time
Alligator skin
Oh yeah, you know that's how it is
Rubber-necking
Oh yeah, you know that's how it is
Trash piling
Oh yeah, you know that's how it is

When it's all so boring, 99 cents 
Up in your face, you know they got it
Got plastic stacked on cheap bank cubes
A perfect place for them to hang their noose

And everyone's got a buy and they talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk about it
And they draw some line and make some point
Which way is right

And, oh, I just can't seem to find the time and that light shines bright in your eyes
Alligator skin
Oh yeah, you know that's how it is
Rubber-necking
Oh yeah, you know that's how it is
Trash piling
Oh yeah, you know that's how it is

Alligator skin
Oh yeah, you know that's how it is
Rubber-necking
Oh yeah, you know that's how it is
Trash piling
Oh yeah, you know that's how it's got to be
Oh no!
Yeah, it's got to be
Oh no!
That's how it's got to be
That's how it's got to be
