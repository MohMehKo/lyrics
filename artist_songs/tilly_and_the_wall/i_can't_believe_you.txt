I can't remember
How the you looked the day you left
It's been so long
Still can't move on
And now I'm still a mess
And can't recall how
How I felt later that night
Was I bright and hopeful
Or filled with sorrow
With thoughts of you and I?
And I can't believe you
(I can't believe you)
Would do the things you do
(I can't believe you would do the things
I can't believe you would do the things that you did)
And you never told me
Just how I'm supposed to act
Do I sit and sulk here
And think the worst fears
You're never coming back
And I can't believe you
(I can't believe you)
Would do the things you do
(I can't believe you would do the things
I can't believe you would do the things that you did)
And I can't believe you
(I can't believe you)
Would say the things you said
(I can't believe you would say the things
I can't believe you would say the things that you said)
Now you're gone
Woh...why'd you go?
Woh...now I'm here
Woh...all alone
And I can't believe you
(I can't believe you)
Would do the things you do
(I can't believe you would do the things
I can't believe you would do the things that you did)
And I can't believe you
(I can't believe you)
Would say the things you said
(I can't believe you would say the things
I can't believe you would say the things that you said)
