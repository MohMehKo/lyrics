You fell down the stairs into my arms
And swiftly ran the other way
And I heard the steady swell of applause
For two drunk kids trying to figure out which way was home
They got lost as they were taking off each other's clothes
They realized there was a hole in the boat
And with no lifesaver you try your best to float
But eventually the sky did return and I was there outside in green
I watched the world being reborn until one a.m.
So I thought I'd let you know it was beautiful slow dancing
To tunes of Billie Holiday
The city looked wonderful that way
And love just like blood will always stain
And if I could reverse it I don't think it would be worth it
I know in my heart I would never let you tumble to the ground
No, I'll never let you go
I will never let you tumble to the ground
I'll never let you go
I will never let you tumble to the ground
I'll never let you go
