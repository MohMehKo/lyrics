Oh come on please, split from the sky
Oh this river, has grown so wide
We need some change, some kind of sign
Oh yeah the human heart's so cold and blind

These modern times, they're just not right
I said lets go, I set this up
All on our knees, I beg and pleas
We got sweat drippin down over our brows
Got sweat drippin down over all the clocks throughout town

Cacophony, how long will it be?
Oh I can see the singer rising from the floor he wont leave
Its all becoming, its all beginning
Two stiff fingers for a left right blessing
it keeps it running, it keeps its message
Keeps the rhythm of confessing

Oh lost in town, i feel your sound
I hear you plea, your banged drum
I see the tear, roll down your cheek
You're so beautiful ingrained out loud

Into the dirt, the muddy curve
We hear the man, its covering
We feel the sweat, see the tail
Collecting underneath our fingernails
Laying underneath our sheets and covering our mouths

Cacophony, how long will it be?
Oh I can smell the smoke from burning buildings
Its all becoming, Its all beginning
Two stiff fingers for a left right blessing
It keeps it running, keeps its message
Keep on confessing, lie aloud lesson

Its all becoming, Its all beginning
Two stiff fingers for left right blessing
It keeps it running, keeps its message
Keep on confessing, lie aloud lesson
