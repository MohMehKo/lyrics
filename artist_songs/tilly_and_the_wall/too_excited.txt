You wanna call the shots
You wanna talk the talk
You wanna ask for luck
And never lose your spot
You're going all the way
What a daily chore
You gotta walk the walk
You never walked before

You want all the cake
and push it in your mouth
It's gonna choke your throat
You better spit it out
You wanna play again
You wanna show some blood
Gonna flood japan
and say it's all for love, yeah

Well I say, boo hoo!
And I say, Fuck you!

You wanna rally up
You wanna push and shove
I don't give a shit
If I'm cool or not
So don't throw a fit
I'm not buying it
We don't want no one to get too excited
Raise the stakes
I'm gonna call you out
I gonna burn this mother-fuckin' party down
Before the clock strikes at midnight
Don't want no one to get too excited

Well I say, boo hoo!
And I say, Fuck you!
[x2]

Watch where you step, they're gonna push you down
If you slip, well we won't

Say yeah, yeah!
[x2]

They're gonna hunt you down
Try to put their guns to your head but we won't

Say yeah, yeah!
[x2]

Poor little baby sorry
You can't shake me down
[x2]

Well I say, boo hoo!
And I say, Fuck you!
[x2]
