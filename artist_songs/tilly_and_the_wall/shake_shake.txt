You board an airplane
Take your seat and watch as
All the seasons they change
In a wave of your hand
And all the boys gasp
Stand on legs that shake shake
They all want inside you
They all want to wear your clothes
And it's just motion
Yes everybody knows it
And it's just motion
Yes everybody knows it
And I wish you would close your eyes
Pay attention to the sound of our blood
Because it seems with the birds outside
Who are telling us
Oh, don't be afraid
Oh yeah we won't be afraid
Oh yeah we won't be afraid
Oh yeah we won't be afraid
Oh yeah we won't be afraid
Oh yeah the room's full
All these dancing bodies
All this flesh you're touching
And still it don't mean a thing
And all the mouths move
All the lips of red red
They do all this talking
But nothing's ever really said
And yeah, it's backwards
Yes everybody knows it
And it's just backwards
Yes everybody knows it
And I wish you would close your eyes
Pay attention to the sound of our blood
Because it seems
With the birds outside
Who are telling us
Oh, don't be afraid
Now you're shaking the hands
Each one so cold
A symptom of the yearly toll
It's just the flu
Yeah, it's been going around
And do you believe in rock and roll?
Can music come and save your soul?
I don't think so
Because you're dancing too slow
Oh yeah you're dancing too slow
Oh yeah you're dancing too slow
Oh yeah you're dancing too slow
Oh yeah you're dancing too slow
