Sometimes I don't feel all right
Keeps me shaking up all night
And there's nothing I can do
But I wanna talk to you
This shit's making me feel bad
I'm so sick of feeling sad
Why can't I shake this mess? 
Keeps on running through my head
I can't get out of my bed
Stomach sick, dizzy head
Singing helps all right
But I've been singing all night
Try to open up my eyes
Take some time to realize
Sometime's shit won't feel all right
Got to remember to fight

Off the darkness that comes in sometimes
Turn that sorrow into something that feels right
You're two friends I can count on when I'm blue
You pull me up, you dust me off, you will me through

Sometimes luck's not on my side
Keeps me shaking up all night
And there's nothing I can do
But I wanna talk to you
This shit's making me feel bad
I'm so sick of feeling sad
Why can't I shake this mess? 
Always running through my head
Now I can't get out of bed
Stomach sick, dizzy head
Singing helps all right
But I've been singing all night
Try to open up my eyes
Take some time to realize
Sometime's shit won't feel all right
Got to remember to fight

Off the darkness that creeps in sometimes
And turn that sadness into something that feels right
Cause you're two friends I can count on when I'm blue
You pull me up, you dust me off, you pull me through

You're my love, whoa-oh-oh-oh
It's true, you're my love, whoa-oh-oh-oh
It's true you're my love, whoa-oh-oh-oh
Darling, it's true
