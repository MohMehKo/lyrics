Well, I swear that you came in the form of rain
That had frozen somewhere along it's way through the evening sky
So the trees got tired and laid on the ground
I swear you marched in like big gusts of wind
Oh, cutting through our clothes
Such an easy attempt to convince us
There is no reason we should be outside
When you speak, it's like fire
The sparks leap from your mouth
And all your talk of such burdens
No, it won't bring me and all my friends down
Well, I swear that you spilled into my room lsat night
Oh, covering me in sheets so tight that I didn't move
I just laid around until the early afternoon
So now we're at the bars hypnotized
And trying hard to keep the conversation going
Trying hard to ignore the silence growing like it always does
Yeah, I know, so we better get running
And all your thoughts, they're so tired
Your bullets won't take aim
And oh your face, it's so stern now
No we won't be scared
No we won't back down
We will sing pretty songs about love
And we will fight if that's what it takes
And we won't back down
No we won't shut our eyes and go to sleep
We will write all over your walls
And we will dance to no music at all
We will do what it takes to get through to you
