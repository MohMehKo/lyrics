The light from the street
Fills my room it's amazing to be alive to see
The words that you said
Still resonate and blur up all the lines inside my head
I can't make this house a home
I don't want to make you hate me
I don't want to be the one who is mean or unfair
I love you until this day
I wish you would understand
I want to come over
I wanted to say
There's nobody else that I want to stay
(In bed all day)
I want to stay in bed all day
(I want to stay)
I'll stay in bed all day
I want to stay in bed all day
Piled high and pills
On a grain of sand for you
Like birds all around you
I'm confused and amazed
By the way the room sits still for you
And how I'm drawn away
I fall the way you talk
So darling the way you talk about all the things I love
I remember when we kissed
I sat at the edges and I helped you undress
I wanted to tell you
I wanted to say
There's nobody else that I want to stay
(In bed all day)
I want to stay in bed all day
(I want to stay)
I'll stay in bed all day
I want to stay in bed all day, ooh
All day, ooh
All day, ooh
All day, ooh
All day, ooh
All day, ooh
