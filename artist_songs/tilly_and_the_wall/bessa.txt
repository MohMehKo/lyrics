Morning came and I tried not to notice
It was time for you to move along
The minutes fell like petal all around us
Like a goodbye kiss when goodbye felt so wrong
So you better get going
You better move along now
You better run off then and make yourself scarce
These few days I have decided to be lazy
They don't move or seem to end at all
And my heart it is close enough to breaking
That it hurts just listening to your song
It's been while now since you left
And I can't seem to shake this lonely mood
When the time comes I'll try my best not to tell you
"Please don't leave again"
Since it's all I have I want to go to sleep
And dream of you and me just off the coast
On a holiday so long and warm and lucky
Always wake up in my bedroom all alone
