The feeling was psychic, passing through, electric
My palm against your fingers, pressing needles through my wrist
Hearts meet, though we didn't speak of those things
Falling, falling without knowing

Light as feather, lifting up together
But a heavy ache and focus blames circles in our heads
Eyes meet, though we didn't see what would be
Falling, falling without knowing

Whatever happens now that I've changed
No one will ever stand in our way
We both sent the signal, it's been delivered, a crashing cymbal rings out
We both sent the signal, it's been delivered, a crashing cymbal rings out

Some kind of magic, moving was automatic
The days go on forever, reaching forward, not looking back
Synchronicity, I get the feeling
Completely falling, falling without knowing

It was written long ago 
It was not for me to know
Repeat that memory, I believe
Repeat that memory, I believe
Repeat that memory, I believe
Repeat that memory, I believe

Whatever happens now that I've changed
No one will ever stand in our way
We both sent the signal, it's been delivered, a crashing cymbal rings out
We both sent the signal, it's been delivered, a crashing cymbal rings out
