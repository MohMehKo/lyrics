When we hear that song, we will dance
When we're with all our friends, we will drink and laugh
When we're driving in our cars, we will sing
If you're lost and you look, you will find me
But what I couldn't do is figure out how you
You jumped into my heart, now I couldn't start
To think of life without you, my world would stop
And fall down again, all black and blue again
I want to know everything about you
What makes you feel alive?
And I want to know everything that you do

So let's drive through the night
When you show me your world, I just smiled
And then I sit with you now, I can remember
That when we forget about everything that hurts us
How nothing in the world seems to be
‘Cause nothing can hurt us
Like Wilson Bentley found on black velvet
A beauty so strange, something he didn't expect
It's a unique find that only some people get
And you are mine
‘Cause I want to know everything about you
What makes you feel alive?
And I want to know everything that you do

So let's drive through the night
Put your hands on my heart
Spray paint verses on a cold blue wall
Write our names in the burning sand
Watch as snowflakes melt inside our hands
‘Cause I want to know everything about you
What makes you feel alive?
And I want to know everything that you do
So let's drive through the night
