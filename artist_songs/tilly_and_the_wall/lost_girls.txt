Girl, I know the hall looks dark 
And the storm it seems so scary 
Your face lit up on beats of lightning 

You start, you start running 
And your eyes are like screaming 
And since there is no end and no beginning

You will run, you will run, you will run 

Girl, I know the woods look dark
And the trees they seem so deadly
The girls around you are so frightened

You start, you start to panic
And your courage starts to vanish
And the world, it really is on fire

And it burns, and it burns, and it burns 
It burns, and it burns, and it burns

[Kianna:]
Vivian, your life is told through nineteen thousand pages 
In a world too unreal to behold 
Your innocence has faded 
Faded all your blues to gray
Your skin has bruised through moving days
Glue is peeling back away
Curling, cracking, painted

[Neely:]
You're lost and then you find yourself alive
Suddenly you're clinging to a town that fits
Your innocence has faded
You're grabbing hold to anything you'll take
Look into her eyes to feel safe
Don't back away
Curling, cracking, painted 

Girl you've been rolled up in colorful carpets 
Your blood is rushing, look around you 

You're froze, you're frozen quiet 
And your eyes, they are awidened 
Room unfurnished, no light for nightfall 

Just rugs for rolling you up
You know you can't get up
When you do, you swear you will run
You will run, you will run, you will run

No one will ever save you
If no one can ever find you
No one will ever save you
If no one can ever find you
