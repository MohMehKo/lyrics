Oh reckless, a boy wonder, so quiet, nose broken 
Oh, you're standing there, look tired as your singing
And you're on fire, they're throwing punches
So backwards the landscape you thought you knew, it starts unwinding
Now you're jumping through their hoops
You're just trying to dodge all their questions
They're shooting bullets
Cause we all want to hear but you can't, you can't
And we all want to see but you don't, you don't
You are amazing
Oh the horses, suits and ties, they will not hesitate to trample
You keep moving, stop moving, it's the same
You know if it is broken they'll try to fix it
It's a shame that, did they get you? they got you
Yeah they might have
You keep covering their mouths, they keep on talking
The parade it is coming, I hear them marching
Case we all want to hear but you can't, you can't
And we all want to see but you don't, you don't
You are amazing
Yeah we all think we're right but we're wrong, we're wrong
And we all want to talk and we do, we do
They have convinced you
It's so shocking
You cheated your fate now, we can't read your face
You are gone
