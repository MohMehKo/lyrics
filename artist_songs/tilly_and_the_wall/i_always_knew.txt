I've lived my life inside daydream lies
Imaginary friends that always knew one day I'd leave for good
I'll give away this girl who tried to make you fall i love
I'll give her to you so keep her close to you
So you won't forget about oh how she loved you
So long ago, once upon a time
Now she has grown up, and you can't take it back
A lullaby won't change my mind
And I won't ever go back to that
I will stay true to this belief that we've changed
For the best through this
Seperate the ones who know you
From the ones who couldn't bother to see you for all that there is
Deep down I always knew all the times
I thought that I loved you
It was just an easy answer
It was make believe
But I still believe that this heart will learn to love
