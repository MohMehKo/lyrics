I buried my blood years ago to encourage the vine
I waited for something to grow and flourish with time
I counted each hopeful raindrop as it fell to its death
I dusted the mournful frost and warmed it up with my breath

You'd better watch where you're walking
There might be somebody's blood flower growing
You'd better watch what you're doing
Don't go fucking around in the garden

You'd better watch where you're walking
You'd better watch what you're doing
You'd better watch where you're walking
You'd better watch what you're doing

On the night of the hunter's moon you might notice a quiet dread
Are your eyes playing tricks on you?
Yeah, maybe it's in your head

Every day a little more unsettled, you are starting to understand
You're sleeping with the lights on, with no one to hold your hand

You'd better watch where you're walking
You'd better watch what you're doing
You'd better watch where you're walking
You'd better watch what you're doing

You'd better watch where you're walking, where you're walking
You'd better watch what you're doing

You'd better watch where you're walking
There might be somebody's blood flower growing
You'd better watch what you're doing
Don't go fucking around in the garden

You'd better watch where you're walking
There might be somebody's blood flower growing
You'd better watch what you're doing
Don't go fucking around in the garden

You'd better watch where you're walking
There might be somebody's blood flower growing
