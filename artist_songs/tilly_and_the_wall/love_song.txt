well, you walked into the room just like the sun
and woke the caveman from his endless slumber
and with the quickness of your arm
you pulled out a paint brush
and you painted the sky back to blue
and now i'm standing on top of dirty clothes
there's a tornado spinning in the corner
and electricity flows from your hands into my bones
and my flesh turns pink with its warmth

oh pretty love
don't worry
with me you don't need a place to hide
so just sit real still
and the light will flood in over the hills

and now i'm walking around outside
in the springtime every thing is sprouting green
and i watched this fight occur
but only thought about lovers
oh it's strange how this world becomes pure

and you were standing on top of tip toes
in the kitchen as the water starts to boil
and as we removed each others clothes
i thought i would sing some notes
so that maybe you would slow dance with me

oh pretty love
don't worry
with me you don't need a place to hide
so just sit real still
and the light will flood in over the window sill
oh yeah just sit real still
and you and me will bloom
oh you and me will bloom
oh you and me will bloom
on the windowsill
