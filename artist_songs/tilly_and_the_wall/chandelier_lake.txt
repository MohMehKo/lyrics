There's a yellow tree that no one sees
Where the water meets the land
The grass grows tall and the shadows fall
The blades cast a ghostly dance

The banks are stained with blood and rain
where the water meets the land
A secret there they'll never share
A code of silence

You would never see what's been hiding
Where the water meets the land

Until a careful wind begins to lift
Each grain of dust and sand

Chandelier Lake is a mysterious place
And the ghost of the woman who sleeps beneath the waves
Chandelier lake is a mysterious place, and
She's the only one who knows its name

A little fox gone wandering
Where the water meets the land
Tired, lost, and hungry
She sees diamonds against the plants

So she sat down by what she's found
Where the water meets the land
And there exposed was clothes and bones
And a ring on a lifeless hand

And the trees and wind they hold their breath
All feigning ignorance

And no one will even remember it
If they are made to forget

Chandelier Lake is a mysterious place
And the ghost of the woman who sleeps beneath its waves

Chandelier Lake is a mysterious place
And she's the only one who knows her grave
