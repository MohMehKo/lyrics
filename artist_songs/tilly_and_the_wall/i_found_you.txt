I, I went down walking
The sky was bright
Red flowers blooming
The sky was bright (so bright!)

And I could hear that rock 'n' roll coming out your radio (that's right!)

I, I went down walking
The sun was hot (so hot!)
The streets were melt, melt, melting
The sun was hot (so hot!)

And I could hear the rock 'n' roll coming out your front window
Yeah, I was look, look, looking for you

I, I went down walking
The wind's so cold
The leaves build my path
The wind grew cold

I was taken by the light that had fell on such a sight
(Uh huh, yeah, that's right)
Over and over and over and over again

I, I went down walking
The snow made angels on the ground
Icicles hang, hang, hanging
The snow made angels all around

And I stumbled through the snow on the way to your front door
I felt the earth beneath my feet push, push, push, pushing me
And all that I could see were lights falling all around me
I was look, look, looking for you
I was look, look, looking for you
I was look, look, looking for you
I was look, look, looking for you
