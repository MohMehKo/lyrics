When you crawl into bed
You pull the covers a bit too tight
Get drunk and lay your head on my pillow
Mute and white
Do you dream at all?
Because I don't believe you do
Do you dream at all?
Because I don't believe you do
It's always those black black circles around your eyes
Darker still
Such dead slumber will get you nowhere in the end
So do you dream at all?
Because I don't believe you do
Do you dream at all?
Because I don't believe you do
Do you wish someone was there to rock you to sleep?
And hold you near?
Well, that won't be me.
Do you dream at all?
Because I don't believe you do
Do you dream at all?
Because I don't believe you do
Do you dream at all?
Because I don't believe you do
Do you dream at all?
Because I don't believe you do
