I bet you think we didn't know
Didn't even see the tides change
But it's a small, small world, girl
Getting even smaller every day [x2]

You can fake that smile
For a hollow while
But the kids all learn
Once those bridges burn

The trash washes up to shore
Even in this landlocked place
The shit gets thicker
It's toxic
Get it out my face [x2]

And don't be surprised
If they don't buy your lies
Some of us can see through
Your stained glass eyes 

Pot kettle, pot kettle black
Talk that, talk that smack
Pot kettle, pot kettle black
Watch your, watch your back [x2]

Oh my god
Did you hear (yeah)
About that bitch
And what she did?
I don't believe it
Aw, aw
What a ho
What a tramp
What a slut 

Pot kettle, pot kettle black
Talk that, talk that smack
Pot kettle, pot kettle black
Watch your, watch your back [x2]
