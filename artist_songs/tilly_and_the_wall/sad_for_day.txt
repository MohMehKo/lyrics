I've been for sad for days
About the way I said that you were nothing
I said you were nothing
I would break my bones before I'd take a thing
A thing that you need to believe in
Practices in the basement
Of your parents house
It felt like it did when we were kids
I knew you'd be there
And I still do
I know it's true
I knew you'd be there
And the mistakes I made
Will never be forgiven
Will they forget?
Will they ever forget?
All the years I stumbled over
I followed because I loved you
Oh yeah, I loved you
Spring drives over Cokes and always I know things have changed
But I still feel you here at the boxing club
We got love but you have made me tough
And I always love you
Practices in the basement
Of your parents house
It felt like it did when we kids
I knew you'd be there
And I still do
I know it's true
I knew you'd be there
Ba ba ba da da da
Ba ba ba da da da
Na Na
Ba ba ba da da da
Ba ba ba da da da
Na Na
You know I'll be here
Waiting for you
