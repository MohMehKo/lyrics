You'll be my Monday, my fresh start
I'll be your Sunday, never be apart
We got the whole week, in it together
We got our whole life, to go on forever

If you could see,
I could be the one to make you smile
And all you'll need,
Is love, we could take our time
Spend every second with you,
Turn all your pressure into, 
Simply sunny, 
Or your wildest dreams

I'll pave the way,
You just got to follow me
I know you'll be the one,
My paradise,
Under the sun

You'll be my Monday, my fresh start
I'll be your Sunday, never be apart
We got the whole week, in it together
We got our whole life, 
To go on forever, ever, ever,
Go on forever, ever, ever
End it together, gether, gether
End it together, 
Forever together

365 days of the year,
I'll be with you everywhere like the atmosphere
We can follow the good weather
Travel on the wind, birds of a feather
7 days without left,
It makes one week
You're my happily ever after,
Smiling from cheek to cheek
Every single day is 24/7
Can't overstay,
When you're with me I'm in heaven

I'll pave the way,
You just got to follow me
I know you'll be the one,
My paradise,
Under the sun

You'll be my Monday, my fresh start
I'll be your Sunday, never be apart
We have the whole week, in it together
We got our whole life, 
To go on forever, ever, ever,
Go on forever, ever, ever
End it together, gether, gether
End it together, 
Forever together

Forever together,
Yeah,
Forever together
I'll be forever with you,
No matter what we go through
I'll be forever with you,
Forever together
