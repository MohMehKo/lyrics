My friends talk shit every time I sing about her
I don't got a lot of dough but here's a little flower
I'm covered in sand, Baby we can take a shower
Takin' sips of her lips like it's happy hour
Afternoon delight reverse cowgirl rowdy
All I know is that I'm stocked I found out about her
When I don't believe, no I will never doubt her
When I put my arm around her I couldn't be prouder

We have all we need 
Singing sweet melodies
Feels just like a dream
I need you to believe
'Cause honestly like

I'll pick you up, girl
In my 97' Honda
No AC, shit it's hotter than a sauna
But it's all good
When it's cooler by the water
Dive right in
Skinny-dippin' if you wanna

We don't got time to waste
So baby come here to me
I'll pick you up girl
And there'll never be another

I'mma make you mine by the end of the summer
Summer, summer (summer)
I'mma make you mine by the end of the summer
Summer, summer (summer)
I'mma make you mine by the end of the summer

Last night when we Skyped
I kissed the screen night-night like five times
Every time I laugh it's a spaz attack
And I stutter every time that I answer back
So maybe, Baby, you could lay me down
I'll play the ukulele
Singing lullabies to my lady on the daily
She's fine like the red wine stuck to my lips
Maybe you can help me take it off with a kiss
And maybe you could help me take it off, Little Miss
I'mma speak French to you while I kiss your wrist

We have all we need 
Singing sweet melodies
Feels just like a dream
I need you to believe
'Cause honestly like

I'll pick you up, girl
In my 97' Honda
No AC, shit it's hotter than a sauna
But it's all good
When it's cooler by the water
Dive right in
Skinny-dippin' if you wanna

We don't got time to waste
So baby come here to me
I'll pick you up girl
And there'll never be another

I'mma make you mine by the end of the summer
Summer, summer (summer)
(I'm feeling right)

I'mma make you mine by the end of the summer (I'm feelin' right)
Summer, summer (I'm feelin' right)

I'mma make you mine by the end of the summer (I'm feelin' right)
Summer, summer (I'm feelin' right)

I'mma make you mine by the end of the summer (I'm feelin' right)
Summer, summer

I'mma make you mine by the end of the summer
