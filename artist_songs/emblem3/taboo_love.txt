You'll send it to me now if I delete it
But you'll hunt me down if I leak it
Finger on my lips I can keep it
It's out little secret
Our little secret
The way you hold it down in the sheets when
You come around my town every weekend
You give me a faith to believe in
My masterpiece your
My mona lisa

Even the sun is jealous of the way you shine
I'll be staring at ya till I'm (till I'm blind)
Cause your soul fire is burnin up my eyes
(burnin up my eyes)

When you give me that taboo love
Forbidden but I crave your touch
Don't tell nobody about us
I'm feelin' for ya
Baby both of my lips are shut
I don't wanna go fuck this up
Taboo love
So show me how you turn it up
And now my heart is burnin up
I'm feelin' for ya
Baby both of my lips are shut
Love the way that we keep it hush hush

hush hush yeah yeah
hush hush hush yeah yeah

I'll be poppin off all these tracks with the way that I bring it back
No one stop me from poppin tags
I'll be counting up all these stacks

I'm fein'n believin' that your love is what
I've been needin'
Through all of this time that I'm schemin'
I'm scratching I'm screaming
I'm feeling like bleeding for your love and your touch
Your tricks and so treating

It's taboo love from the counter to the closet yeah
Me and my girl from the city to the tropics yeah
You know you got it got my jaw droppin'
