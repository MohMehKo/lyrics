You know who you are

My friends talk shit everytime I sing about her
I don't got a lotta dough, but here's a little flower
I'm covered in sand, baby, we could take a shower
Taking sips of her lips like it's happy hour

Afternoon delight reverse, cowgirl, rowdy
All I know is I'm stoked that I've found out about her
When I don't believe, no, I would never doubt her
When I put my arm around her, I couldn't be prouder

A smart cookie, yeah, she aced the trigonometry
Silly and stoked, you should hear her sing a song to me
I'm so stressed, I think there's something wrong with me
But I know it's good with my baby, because, honestly, like

I'm gonna sleep sound tonight, 'cause I'm 
Burnt out from the pillow fight tonight
I'm bundled up tight, with my boo on my side
Set the mood right, feelin' right
I'm gonna sleep sound tonight, 'cause I'm 
Burnt out from the pillow fight
I'm bundled up tight, with my boo on my side
Set the mood right, feelin' right

Feelin' [x7]
ri-ight
woah, oh oh oh oh
Feelin' [x7]
ri-ight

(Feelin', Feelin') I'm feelin' right [x3]

And last night, when we Skyped
I kissed the screen "night, night" like five times
Everytime I laugh, it's a spaz attack
And I stutter every time that I answer back
So maybe, baby, you could lay me down
I'd play the ukulele
Singing lullabies to my lady, on the daily

She's so cute, and she's so fine
I wanna back it up and hit it from behind
She's fine, like the red wine stuck to my lips
Maybe you could help me take it off with a kiss

And maybe you could help me get it off, lil' miss
Imma speak fresh to you, while I kiss your wrist
I sing my song proud, even though my friends dissed
'Cause I know they jealous, 'cause they ain't got this class dismissed

I'm gonna sleep sound tonight, 'cause I'm 
Burnt out from the pillow fight tonight
I'm bundled up tight, with my boo on my side
Set the mood right, feelin' right
I'm gonna sleep sound tonight, 'cause I'm 
Burnt out from the pillow fight
I'm bundled up tight, with my boo on my side
Set the mood right, feelin' right

Feelin' [x7]
ri-ight
woah, oh oh oh oh
Feelin' [x7]
ri-ight

(Feelin', Feelin') I'm feelin' right [x5]
You know I'm feelin' right

You know who you are

E3 [x2]

I'm feelin' right [x5]
You know I'm feelin' right
