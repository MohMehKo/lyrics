I knew from the start, the start
All of the struggles that we go through
They may scar my heart
But in the end, it’s what will make you

[Pre-Chorus:]
Who we are, who we are
At the end of the day, oh
Are we are, are we are
Are we who we say? Oh
Who we are, who we are
At the end of the day, oh
At the end of the day-day

[Chorus:]
This world is so heavy, oh
Don’t know if I’m ready, oh
I can feel it like the waves crashing down
I know I need to reach up, not to drown
This world is so heavy

[Wesley:]
I can see it in your eyes
You and me could live a thousand lives
Comin’ in like the endless tide
Sittin’ in the sand layin’ side-by-side
Even though I know things ain’t perfect
You’re the one to let me know it’s worth it
And I’ve said it a million times:
As long as we’re together
Everything’s alright

[Keaton:]
Reach for the stars, the stars
No matter how far the journey takes you
I’ll stand tall, so tall
Because I know they’ll never break through

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

This world is so heavy, whoa-oh
Don’t know if I’m ready
