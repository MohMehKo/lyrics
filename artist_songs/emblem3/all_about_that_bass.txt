Because you know I'm all about that bass
'Bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass [x2]

Bass, bass, bass, bass!

Yeah sometimes it's pretty clear, she ain't no size two
But she can shake it, shake it like she's supposed to do
'Cause she got that boom boom that all the boys chase
Got all the right junk in all the right places
We see the magazines working that photoshop
We know that shit ain't real
Come on now, make it stop
If you got beauty beauty then raise 'em up
'Cause every inch of you is perfect
From the bottom to the top

Yeah, my father told me don't worry about her size
‘Cause all us guys like a little more booty to hold at night
(That booty booty, that booty booty!)
She won't be no stick figure, silicon barbie doll
So, if that's what's you're into
And go ahead and move along!

Because you know I'm all about that bass
'Bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass

She's bringing booty back
Go ahead and tell them skinny bitches that
No more joking, never say you're fat
‘Cause I'm here to tell you that
Every inch of you is perfect from the bottom to the top!

Yeah, my father he told me don't worry about her size
‘Cause all us guys like a little more booty to hold at night
(That booty booty, that booty booty!)
She won't be no stick figure, silicon barbie doll
So, if that's what's you're into
Then go ahead and move along!

Because you know I'm all about that bass

I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble

Because you know I'm all about that bass
'Bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass
