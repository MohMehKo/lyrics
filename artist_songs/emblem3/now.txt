Make way for the kings 
When E3 steps back in the scene
Just a couple bros a guitar and a dream
Everything we need to achieve anything
And we got lil keats on the mac making beats. 
Got wesley on the mic he can sing 
Then me on the side been banging these strings
Been pretty much the same kids since 16 
But now we're back makin' waves like a typhoon
Couple kids in a million dollar typhoon
Climbing up the billboard climbing up the iTunes screaming baby baby

Baby we're back 
Did ya miss me miss me
Here on this track
Are you listening listening 
I'm in the stars 
And I'm never coming down 
Oh whoa oh
No one can stop us now 

You see, certain people tried to brand us
Without takin' the time to understand us,
I get the fact there's a business plan but,
That shit damn near broke the band up
And this might seem random but I got to give a shout out to the fandom (I love you!)
Been a couple years and you all stuck around and
Means more than you'll ever understand 
Cause we do it for the buzz when we get up on the stage
High like a drug straight shot to the veins
We don't do it for the money we don't do it for the fame
We do it for the love and it's never gunna change

Baby we're back 
Did ya miss me miss me
Here on this track
Are you listening listening 
I'm in the stars 
And I'm never coming down 
Oh whoa oh
No one can stop us now

No one can stop us now
