[Drew:]
I wanna wake up on the beach
Wake up with you by my side
We could spend the am, blankets tight,
You just tell me where, and I can take you there
We're straight broke living like billionaires

On the beach, wake up make away the stars
Wanna watch the water trickle down your arms
You just tell me where, and I can take you there
With the top down, hands up, wind in your hair

[Wesley:]
Like, oh, you're my Lucy in the sky
Ooh
And there's diamonds in your eyes

[All:]
We, we could be one love
We could be one light
Just for one day

We, we could be one heart
We only got one life
So let's get away
Just for one day
Ooh
Just for one day

[Drew:]
Yeah

And baby, this could be a dream
The kind to make you smile all night
And I'm the kind of guy to make the dream real life
So tell me where you are
You know I'll send a car
A jet set from your house straight to the stars

Like a dream
Colors of the best sunset
Yeah, color California cause the coast is west
So tell me where you at, in 20 seconds flat
We'll be top down, hands up, never look back

Like, oh, you're my Lucy in the sky
Oh
And there's diamonds in your eyes

[All:]
We, we could be one love
We could be one light
Just for one day

We, we could be one heart
We only got one life
So let's get away
Just for one day -aaaaaaaay
Just for one day -aaaaaaaay

[Drew:]
Just for one day with you we'll be underneath the stars
Baby, drinkin' champagne, eatin' caviar
One day with you in the deep blue sea
Cause it's me and you, yeah it's you and me

We, we could be one love
We could be one light
Just for one day

[All:]
We, we could be one love
We could be one light
Just for one day
(Hands up if you're down with the three)
(I said for one day, baby)

We, we could be one heart
We only got one life
So let's get away
(Hands up, Hands up yeah)
Just for one day

We, we could be one love
We could be one light
Just for one day
Just for one day

[Drew:]
(One day with you we'll be underneath the stars
Baby, drinkin' champagne, eatin' caviar
One day with you in the deep blue sea
Cause it's me and you, yeah it's you and me)

[Wesley:]
We, we could be one heart
We only got one life
So let's get away
Just for one day
