True friends are few and far between
Hold on to them and don't let go
And they will make you shine when all else
Fades away

Such a sight to see
Shining light for me
So I might believe there's a spark of light shining vibrantly inside of me
You're the one that puts the life in me so bright in the end
Said I want to believe
I gotta stay true and hold on to the ones I call my

True friends are few and far between
Hold on to them and don't let go
And they will make you shine when all else
Fades away... when it rains
When it rains

With style, with spunk, with class
When your spirits like a lake shimmering like glass
And my reflection in the water is pertinently attached
I printed it in like a tattoo
Lets capture this moment or hold it like you want it all
Fold it like a load of clothes to your soul hold it all
We share a poem in this moment that you wrote it you know
I'll be there I want to believe
That I gotta stay true and hold on to the ones I call my

True friends are few and far between
Hold on to them and don't let go
And they will make you shine when all else
Fades away... when it rains
When it rains

Ohhh yea ohh

True friends are few and far between
Hold on to them and don't let go
And they will make you shine when all else
Fades away... when it rains
When it rains,rains
Rains, rains, rains
