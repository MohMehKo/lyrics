Yeah
I'm gonna head down the sun
Pick you a flower
Blend up some fruit
I promise I won't make it sour
Give you a sip and
Then you will pucker your lips
And then you'll know 
That all I really want
From you is a kiss
I'm falling through your eyes
And it's tickling my heart
Butterfly in the sky
Is what you really are
You're a star, yeah
You're a star, yeah

I'm falling through the indigo kaleidoscope
I'm falling through the indigo kaleidoscope
Yeah
I'm getting dirty in the shower
While I'm m getting cleaned up
Caramel cheeto
Reese's pieces peanut butter cup
Strange things happen when
Opposites be attractin'
I'll be heads, you'll be tails
It's a perfect match then
I can be greedy, yeah
You can be money
Hand in hand in the city
We can run it
Beauty's only skin deep
Better get your lotion on
All is fair in love and war
I get dirty in both of 'em

I'm falling through the indigo kaleidoscope
I'm falling through the indigo kaleidoscope
And I'm m falling through the indigo kaleidoscope

Yeah
And I'm m gone
And I'm m gone
I'm gone
And I'm m gone
And I'm m gone
I'm gone

I'm falling through the indigo kaleidoscope
I'm falling through the indigo kaleidoscope
And I'm m falling through the indigo kaleidoscope
Yeah
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh Ooh ooh 
Ooh ooh ooh Ooh ooh Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh Ooh ooh 
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
