Hold tight the futures bright
Pens in your hands so don't stop writing now, writing now
It's easy to feel lost when you hit downtown with all these strangers round, strangers around

Look at the sky
(When you're all alone)
Every night,
(I'll leave my light on)
So you can see your way home

Caught up in those pretty city lights
Wishing on a star for your direction
Thinking of a new and different life 
Babe I know this one ain't what you've been dreaming

You keep hearing promises
That don't play out I'm sorry if it let you down, I let you down
I know what the heart can take
All I ask is you don't throw us away, throw us away

Look at the sky
(When you're all alone)
Every night,
(I'll leave my light on)
So you can see your way home

Caught up in those pretty city lights
Wishing on a star for your direction
Thinking of a new and different life 
Cause babe I know this one ain't what you've been dreaming

Oh celebrities ain't rodeo
These dirty streets ain't paved with gold
But darling I hope you find
Those city lights 
Those city lights 

Sorry babe but I just can't share you 
Want you so bad babe I need you
Screaming out please don't go, please don't go
Please come home, please come home
[x2]

Caught up in those pretty city lights
Wishing on a star for your direction
Thinking of a new and different life 
Cause babe I know this one ain't what you've been dreaming

Oh celebrities ain't rodeo
These dirty streets ain't paved with gold
But darling I hope you find
Those city lights...
Those city lights...
Those city lights...
Hope you find 'em...
Hope you find 'em...
