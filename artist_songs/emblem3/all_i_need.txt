Leaving on a jet plane, never to return again
But that's alright 'cause she's on my side
On my side

I'm leaving on a jet plane, never to return again
But that's alright, she's on my side
On my side

Leaving on a jet plane, never to return again
But that's alright 'cause she's on my side
On my side

Every time I look into her eyes
My stomach churns with butterflies
All I want is to be you and me,
What do you say?
Just take my hand,
And I will show you the way
Day after day
You're all I need
You are all I need

I need to run away
No worries just run and play
Oh, baby, yeah
Take my hand
Let's run away
Let's leave today
I'm all you'll need
I am all you'll need

And now I am reminiscing on everything special that we had
I never would've thought that we could make it last this long
You know it's been so right, I promise let's leave tonight.
Plane to get, train to get, baby, we can go anywhere
We can go anywhere

So take my hand and come with me
I'll wipe the tears right off your swollen cheeks
Is this a laugh or is this a cry
Is this love or simply life?

Understand I never plan to impress
'Cause I'm a big fool for a lady in a yellow 80s sun dress
Oh, yes, mind's a mess, but she's relieving all my stress
A day by day, and night by night,
She never fusses and she never fights
She's alright

I love you dear, I
She is all I need
She is all I'll ever need, yeah
I am all you will need
I am all you will need, yeah
Take my hand
Take my hand

Leaving on a jet plane, never to return again
But that's alright 'cause she's on my side
On my side

I'm leaving on a jet plane, never to return again
But that's alright, she's on my side
On my side

Leaving on a jet plane, never to return again
But that's alright 'cause she's on my side
On my side

I'm leaving on a jet plane, never to return again
But that's alright, she's on my side
On my side
