Tonight
I can see it in your eyes
I'm gonna give it to you right
I'm gonna give it to you right

I'm obsessed, that's fine
You could even say I'm out of line
But it's heaven when I am inside
It's heaven when I am inside

Forever is too much
But, baby, when we touch
Our sensations go overload, whoa

Can't shake the thought of your body riding on top of me
Like a bomb we're 'bout to explode

Give you all that I have tonight
I can see us going for a ride
Your love's like a buzz, so high
Baby, you're the best,
Got me so obsessed, yeah

Dim the lights, turning off your phone
Knock me down like a domino
And turn me on like the radio
Baby, you're the best,
Got me so obsessed, yeah

Yeah, yeah, hey
Yeah, yeah, hey
Yeah, yeah, hey
Baby, you're the best,
Got me so obsessed, yeah

She said she gon' spend the night
Got me feeling like a Redbull takin' flight
We could soar to new heights
What we're doing so wrong, but it feels so right

And that body so delicious
The way she knock on that wood, superstitious
She the type of she don't make me want to miss this
The way she put it down on me like a mistress

Can't stop so long, never quit this
Work it out like we're working on our fitness
Yeah, best that you'll have, baby
Now bang it up like Miley crazy

Forever is too much
But, baby, when we touch
Our sensations go overload, whoa

Can't shake the thought of your body riding on top of me
Like a bomb, we're 'bout to explode

Give you all that I have tonight
I can see us going for a ride
Your love's like a buzz, so high
Baby, you're the best,
Got me so obsessed, yeah

Dim the lights, turning off your phone
Knock me down like a domino
And turn me on like the radio
Baby, you're the best,
Got me so obsessed, yeah

Yeah, yeah, hey
Yeah, yeah, hey
Yeah, yeah, hey
Baby, you're the best,
Got me so obsessed, yeah
