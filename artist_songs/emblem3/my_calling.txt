I dream of black shades
Driving with the top down
Not a care in the world 
as the sun sets to the ground
Two birds of a feather sharing in this world
a change for the better, yeah

Uh
True night, memory
No enemies as I'm breathing in deeply
Filling my lungs up 
with the cool night summer breeze, yeah

Rise above and grow some love
as the world spins round and round
Our love keeps time to this sound

This is my calling, I tell you
This earth is falling down on you and
Wisdom is power to controlling knowledge, yeah
The future of the world is in the minds of kids

See, I ain't got no place to be going
no places I gotta be, yeah
My mind spell peace and it's inside of me
So beat the beat of my heart up
for you from the star to the floor
At the floor, looking for beautiful

Down into the Twilight
Down into the New Moon
Down into the Eclipse
Down into the gummies
and I'm playing ukulele tunes to my baby, baby

As the world spins round and round
Our love keeps time to this sound

This is my calling, I tell you
This earth is falling down on you and
Wisdom is power to controlling knowledge, yeah
The future of the world is in the minds of kids
(Minds of kids)

And I, I know-ow-ow that
we don't have to worry, no
Please don't worry, no
And you're my friend
We'll be okay in the end
We'll be okay in the end

While the world spins round and round
Our love keeps time to this sound
And time turns upside down
Yeah

This is my calling, I tell you
This earth is falling down on you and
Wisdom is power to controlling knowledge, yeah
The future of the world is in the minds of kids

It's in the minds of kids
minds of kids
It's in the minds of kids
minds of kids
It's in the minds of kids
minds of kids
It's in the mids of kids
