No, no

Ended up in my place
Never told me her name 
When I woke up
I was alone

I don’t understand what
Made her run away ‘cause
I felt like JJ
We share the same soul

[Pre-Chorus:]
I wish
I would’ve asked what she’s about
But she snuck out the back 
When the sun came out

[Chorus:]
Really wish that she had stayed
Coulda’ never left the bed all day
Oh, but I don’t even know her name
Don’t even know her
I-I don’t even know her name

Don’t know her name, no

Runnin’ down my street
Asking everybody
And they all tell me I’m out of my mind
Staring at the ceiling
I can’t shake this feeling
She forgot me
And she’s doin’ alright 

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

Wish I told her what she meant to me
Coulda’ had more than a memory
Oh, but I don’t even know her name
Don’t even know her
I-I don’t even know her name

You know you got me
I’m fallin’
Don’t even know who you are, are
I gotta fight you
I really need to
To hold a piece of my heart, heart

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

Wish I told what she meant to me
(Wish I told her what she meant to me)
Coulda’ had more than a memory
(So much more, baby, oh)
Oh, but I don’t even know her name
Don’t even know her
I-I don’t even know her name
(Don’t know her name, oh)

Don’t know her name
Don’t know her name
Don’t know her-don’t know her name

I don’t even know her name

No, I don’t even know her name
