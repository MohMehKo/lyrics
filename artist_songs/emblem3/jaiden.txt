Jaiden oh Jaiden
You're fading, you're fading
You take my heart away
When I think about the days
When we were like cursive
Always together

Jaiden oh Jaiden
Mistakes that I have made
They have taken the sacred
And made it fade away
Well, that's just how karma works,
Always forever

So I'll steal your heart another day
And we can live in endless holiday
And we can find ourselves searching for the same things
All my dreams, yes dreams are really useless
When it comes to spending time with you miss
You make all my dreams come true without reason

I wish you were here, whoa, whoa, oh
I wish you were here, whoa, whoa, oh

Jaiden oh Jaiden
I'll say it again
The pain goes away
When I mutter your name
I pretend that we were
Always together

Jaiden oh Jaiden
I'm aging, I'm aging
I'm olding, I'm graying
I still feel the same
Love only plays for keeps
Always forever

So I'll steal your heart another day
And we can live in endless holiday
And we can find ourselves searching for the same things
All my dreams, yes dreams are really useless
When it comes to spending time with you miss
You make all my dreams come true without reason

I wish you were here, whoa, whoa, oh
I wish you were here, whoa, whoa, oh

And all my flowers seem to lose their fragrance
Living like a child with no imagination
My world, my world spins for you
And just know that I will always adore you
Because your face is imprinted on my eyes

I wish you were here, whoa, whoa, oh
I wish you were here, whoa, whoa, oh

I wish you were here love, oh whoa, oh yeah, yeah
I wish you were here, oh, oh, oh Jaiden
