I got that UV blues

I'm having sex on the beach with the same party girl
Dirty like the martini, 'cause she's servin' me chill
Won't you look at that tequila sunrise, me, oh, my
Another night passed by in the blink of an eye

Time flies by when you're havin' a ball
So I suppose I'll be an old man by next fall
I'm blaming it on the whiskey sippin',
Frisky gettin', dippin' it in dipsy gettin' topsy turvy
Got me spinnin' got me swervin'
See you sing for me, sing for you
Together we'll sing the UV blues

We got a UV blues again, 
We got a UV blues again,
Yeah yeah yeah
We got a UV blues again,
We got a UV blues again

See it was me and Jose Cuervo with JD at a party
Sippin' Bacardi
We've been drinkin' a lot of Pina Coladas,
So pour me a shot of tequila or vodka
Droppin' sake bombs like a kamikaze
Champagne champion, no trippin' 
We're sippin', forgettin' your sorry

So fill me up the margarita
Grindin' with a senorita
OJ Grey Goose screw drivin'
Screws loose, wanna grow love?
Then plant two lips on Drew's lips
Come on, baby, give me mucho besos y smooches

Teeny boppers really love their teeny's cosmopolitans
Mamosas and daiquiris
With cherry's on top of 'em
Rockin' with the best
From the east to the west coast
We say

We got a UV blues again, 
We got a UV blues again,
Yeah yeah yeah
We got a UV blues again,
We got a UV blues again

Pretty pretty please
You're in my fantasies
You and me, kickin' back
In that warm Cali breeze
Got that summer of fun
You know we're livin' it up
Don't you ever forget
Don't you ever forget

I said stop the beat
And pretty mama come and rock with me
We can drop the beats
We can dance all night
'Til you end up on top of me
Rockin' me

So drop the beat
And pretty mama come and rock with me
We can drop the beats
We can dance all night
'Til you end up on top of me
Rockin' me
Stop the beat
Stop and sing

We got a UV blues again
We got a UV blues again,
Yeah yeah yeah
We got a UV blues again,
We got a UV blues again

We got a UV blues again,
I said that we do,
We got a UV blues again
I got that UV blues
We got a UV blues again
