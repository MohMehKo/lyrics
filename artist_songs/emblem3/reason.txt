I'm singing songs downtown at the corner bar
The only friend I know is this damn guitar
No woman does exist for me
No woman satisfies my needs.

I cruise these streets, a must at sound
Call me up, I'm always around
Echo effects through this empty town
If the radio's up, then you know that
We're gonna get...

Down, down, down, down, down [x2]

I say "You are all I want tonight"
I say "You are all I need" (yeah)
My world it turns to see your smile
You're giving me a reason, reason, reason (yeah)
You're giving me a reason, reason, reason (yeeah)

I said it's hard out here for your boy
I try to make money while I try to make noise
I swallow all my pride, I try to get by
My talk is cheap, so my tongue is tied
I am the opposite of mellow
Sippin' on a Red bull
Angel on my right, on the left is the devil
Hello, hello? Can you hear me sing?
I forgot how to speak in the 'midst of all the pain.

I'm walking through the fire fire fire fire fire (yeah)
I'm walking through the flames
I'm walking through the flames

I say "You are all I want tonight"
I say "You are all I need" (yeah)
My world it turns to see your smile
You're giving me a reason, reason, reason (yeah)
You're giving me a reason, reason, reason (yeeah)

Wake up, wake up, wake up Sleeping Beauty
Open your eyes [x2]

I say "You are all I want tonight"
I say "You are all I need" (yeah)
My world it turns to see your smile
You're giving me a reason, reason, reason (yeah)
You're giving me a reason, reason, reason (yeeah)

Reason, reason, reason...
