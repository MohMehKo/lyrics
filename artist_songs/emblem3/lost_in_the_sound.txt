I'm lost in the sound,
Never to be found.
I'm lost in the music
And I'm never coming down.
Let it catch you, yeah
I'm lost in the sound
Never to be found
I'm rollin' to the music
And I'm never coming down
Let it catch you, yeah

I'm on the couch in the back
Puffin on Djarum Blacks
Got a ukulele and a pretty lady on my lap
(pretty lady, yeah)

Kiss, kiss. Cheek, cheek.
Wanna plant one in between
Nineteen, beauty queen
Pretty eyes, foam green
(so seductive, yeah)

Smile now, say cheese
Black dress, lookin' sleaze
Victoria Secret Love Spell, so enchanting
Romance with me.
Slow dance, be fancy
When you get a chance,
Can you pole dance with this dress please?

I'm lost in the sound,
Never to be found.
I'm lost in the music
And I'm never coming down.
Let it catch you, yeah
I'm lost in the sound
Never to be found
I'm rollin' to the music
And I'm never coming down
Let it catch you, yeah

I said take it easy and tease me
On her knees she wanna please me
Squeeze me like a lemon in your Arizona green tea
(she's so sweet to me, yeah)

Yeah. She's so sweet, baby like a mango
Rose in my mouth, when it takes two to tango
Bingo, bongo, babango, congo
G-Ken's bangin sicky beats on the bongo

Now you're groovin' to the music
And you move it and you lose it
You're infused up in the tunes
And now the energy is crusin'
Easy, breezy, beautiful girl for purple lips and wine lover.
Liquor, swim in bourbon, surfin'
Time to get under the covers

I said we pop bottles, foam up,
Overflow red cup
Kickbacks blown up
Who did it own up
Slightly elevated, entertainment pass the flow up
Put ya hands in the air
E3, throw 'em up

I'm lost in the sound,
Never to be found.
I'm lost in the music
And I'm never coming down.
Let it catch you, yeah
I'm lost in the sound
Never to be found
I'm rollin' to the music
And I'm never coming down
Let it catch you, yeah

It’s chillin’ Chadwick,
Just wanted to ask quick
What flavor of chapstick
It is you’ll kiss my ass with
I be switchin’ bitches
Get more women than my dad did
I’m be on that Harry Potter shit
Makin’ magic.

As I graze through 
The shady ways of now-a-days
I’m in the haze 
Of the Long beach ways
Winter in the northwest is glorious
Sit back, live tact, be victorious

Now you can’t take away from me
The treble and the bass you see
The methodical melodies
The rhythms layin next to me
They’re taking me away to see
A whole new kind of place for me
And Life as a musician 
Is the only kind of way for me

I’m lost up in the sound
I’m Never to be found
I’m rollin’ with the rhythms
And I’m never slowin’ down 
Said I’m lost in the sound
I’m Never to be found
I lose it in the music
And I’m never coming down like

I'm lost in the sound
Never to be found
I'm lost in the music
And I'm never coming down
Let it catch you, yeah
I'm lost in the sound
Never to be found
Lost in the music
And I'm never coming down
Let it catch you, yeah

Lost in the sound
Lost in the sound
Let it catch you, yeah
Let it catch you, yeah
