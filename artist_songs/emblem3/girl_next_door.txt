There's something 'bout the girl next door
Something that I can't ignore

I feel your heart beating (boom, boom, boom)
Put in my car keys and (vroom, vroom, vroom)
I smell your fragrance like flowers in full bloom
I savour your flavour like (ooh, ooh, ooh)

Wave at you through my window (ooh, ooh, ooh)
We act like we're just friends though (ooh, ooh, ooh)
These games, these innuendos and I can't get you outta my mind, and I can't get you out

There's something 'bout the girl next door
Something that I can't ignore
She got me like 'Ooh'
She got me like 'Ooh'
There's something 'bout the girl next door
Something that I can't ignore
She got me like 'Ooh'
She got me like 'Ooh'

Now I'm at your door (knock, knock, knock)
Now we're on the floor, you on (top, top, top)
We can be one body, come on let's (rock, rock, rock)
I'm dreaming, I'm feenin' like (ooh, ooh, ooh)
I've seen you with no makeup (ooh, ooh, ooh)
So stoked that you're my neighbour (ooh, ooh, ooh)
So close I can almost taste you and I can't get you out my mind and I can't get you out

There's something 'bout the girl next door
Something that I can't ignore
She got me like 'Ooh'
She got me like 'Ooh'
There's something 'bout the girl next door
Something that I can't ignore
She got me like 'Ooh'
She got me like 'Ooh'

All day got me going crazy
Can't shake that feeling that she gave me
All day got me goin' crazy, got me goin' crazy

There's something 'bout the girl next door
Something that I can't ignore
And every time I look at her
I imagine walking through her door

There's something 'bout the girl next door
Something that I can't ignore
She got me like 'Ooh'
She got me like 'Ooh'

(You know what I'm talking 'bout)
There's something 'bout the girl next door
Something that I can't ignore
She got me like 'Ooh'
She got me like 'Ooh'

There's something 'bout the girl next door
I'm talking 'bout the girl next door
