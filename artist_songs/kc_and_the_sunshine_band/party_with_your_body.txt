I want you tonight
I watch your body moves
And your moves are out of sight
I know you've got to tools
To fix a grown man upright
We'll be dancin' and romancin'
Oh baby, won't you spend the night
We'll be movin' - it's so soothin'
Don't it make you feel alright
Can you find your see-through gown
So we can lay your body down
Won't you put on your negligee
So we can play tonight
I want you tonight
Party with your body
Baby, party hardy
Party with your body
I want you tonight
Party with your body
Baby, party hardy
Party with your body
I want you tonight
Now jazzercise is the latest trend
She keeps me up with hype
It was designed to keep her body thin
Boy I'm hot tonight
We'll be dancin' and romancin'
Oh baby, won't you spend the night
We'll be movin' - it's so soothin'
Don't it make you feel alright
Can you find your see-through gown
So we can lay your body down
Won't you put on your negligee
So we can play tonight
I want you tonight
I want you tonight
Party with your body
Baby, party hardy
Party with your body
I want you tonight
Party with your body
Baby, party hardy
Can you find your see-through gown
So we can lay your body down
Won't you put on your negligee
So we can play tonight
I want you tonight
Party with your body
Party with your body
I want you tonight
I want you tonight
Party with your body
I want you tonight
