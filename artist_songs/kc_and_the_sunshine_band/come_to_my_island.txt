Come to my island, just you and me
Come to my island where we'll be free
Come to my island, just you and me, well
Come to my island where we'll be free

There's no playing around, there's love to be found
There's love everywhere, you feel it in the air
Come to my island, there's plenty of room
It's the kind of place you want to come to real soon

Oh, come to my island, just you and me, yeah
Come to my island where we'll be free
Come to my island, just you and me, yeah
Come to my island where we'll be free

We'll dance and sing, oh, baby, we'll swing
Under the moonlight doin' our thing
Just you and me and silence is the sound
Nobody else anywhere around

Oh, come to my island, just you and me, yeah
Come to my island where we'll be free
Come to my island, just you and me, yeah
Come to my island where we'll be free

Forget about your troubles, forget about your past
The day is here now, we've got to make it last
I'll hold you in my arms, love you some more
Keep you in my heart for ever more

Oh, come to my island, just you and me, yeah
Come to my island where we'll be free
Come to my island, just you and me, yeah
Come to my island where we'll be free

Come on down, come on down
Come on down, down, down
Come on down, come on down
Come on down, down, down

Come on down, come on down
Come on down, down, down
Come on down, come on down
Come on down, down, down

Come to my island, just you and me (You and me)
Come to my island where we'll be free (We'll be free)
Come to my island, just you and me (You and me)
Come to my island where we'll be free

Come to my island, just you and me (Come on down, come on down)
Come to my island where we'll be free (Come on down, down, down)
Come on down, come on down
Come on down, down, down

Come on down, come on down
Come on down, down, down to my island
You'll be free (Just you and me)
You and me (Come to my island) on my island (Where we'll be free)
You'll be free (Come to my island) on my island (Just you and me)
