It's the middle of summer
Whole squad out, just rented them Hummers
You know the team, Redlyfe, I call them niggas my blooders
Tank top on, tan a little, get me some color
Gold chains looking like I can't believe it's not butter
Word to mother, I'm single now, it's kind of a bummer
Me and my shorty ain't together but forever I love her
The women on me though, the flow make the women horny
A million views on that OOOUUU but that's a different story
Same chick, just a different story
Same bed, just a different shorty
Call my ex, she like why you call me?
She don't want me, karma tryna warn me
I know I fucked up but don't ignore me, damn
Anyway, I don't gotta let it bang, my niggas do it for me
A lot of haters on my body, had to get 'em off me
90's swag, Tommy and Nautty
Niggas hating, damn Daniel, don't be corny Corey
Dad caps, pockets mad fat
The beat gives me flashbacks to when we had raps
At first they was sleeping on me, now they cat nap
I got the city on my back like a knapsack, now I got a bad back
My attitude is fuck you, where the cash at?
Hah-choo, I bless tracks then I dab that
Disrespect and get pressed like a hashtag
I'm reppin' Brooklyn so they put me in a cash cab

I'ma ride for my guys, do or die for my guys
Never switch sides on my guys, no
I'ma ride for my bitch, do or die for my bitch
Fucked around a few times on my bitch, woah
She said I don't have no loyalty
Just cause the pussy just be calling me
And she don't think I love her even when I say I love her
That's my bitch and we just single for the summer, woah

Get with the wave
I'm tryna get this money man, I been up for days
I will never change, I'm stuck in my ways
It's hard to leave the hood, I still be around the ways
Uncles on the block drinking Henny, playing spades
All you see is clips of weed laying in the drains
It's normal to us
Where we from it's important to us
Anything out of New York feels foreign to us, woah
Summer nights, cookouts and shoutouts
You see a bunch of scamming niggas with them coupes out
With the tunes loud, bumping with the roof down
Pretty jawns with the fat ass and the boobs out
Ooh, I'm all about my royalty
It's cause the money just be callin' me
And yeah we gotta hustle cause we came up from the gutter
We ain't rich but we ballin' for the summer, woah

I'ma ride for my guys, do or die for my guys
Never switch sides on my guys, no
I'ma ride for my bitch, do or die for my bitch
Fucked around a few times on my bitch, woah
She said I don't have no loyalty
Just cause the pussy just be calling me
And she don't think I love her even when I say I love her
That's my bitch and we just single for the summer, woah

I ride for my guys
Never switch sides on my guys, no
I'ma ride for my bitch
I fucked around a few times on my bitch, woah
