Girl you got me open
Wetter than an ocean
'Em girls be hatin' on her
Cause they ain't got nothin' on her
And she mine
I'm jockin' that

That my girl
That my muthafuckin' girlfriend
And she mine
I'm jockin' that
I'm washin' that

That my muthafuckin' girlfriend

My baby badder than a mufucka
Other niggas want her, but they can't do nothin' for her
I met her in the heart lookin' good
Head down in the bud, I woke up like whats good?
But a couple weeks later she was mine
Shit I even put a ring on her, shordy put that think on me
Yeah she fine plus she smart too, shordy got a heart too
Someone I could talk to when shit is on my mind
I wanna take her out for a week or two
An island with some bitches where nobody else can see us
I'mma lay her down and eat it, them legs, I'm in between it
I take the pussy leakin', that's how I know she need it

Girl you got me open
Wetter than an ocean
'Em girls be hatin' on her
Cause they ain't got nothin' on her

She hold me down, I hold her up
Them other bitches they know it's us
I say never them, we ride til the end
Fuck 'em other hoes, I'm down for my bitch, come here boo, give me kiss
[?] into to my car
[?] to my jigga
She always down to ride that's my muthafuckin' nigga
I would never leave her side, nah uh uh I'm stickin' with her
Cause she loyal and no lie, the bum bigger than a snicker
She got the title so them hoes gettin' neglected
Them hoes gotta except it, them hoes gotta respect
She never leavin' my presents, she got that ring fuck a necklace
And middle finger to my exs

Cause when in doubt you the homie girl
