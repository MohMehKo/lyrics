It's all about loyalty over royalty man
Death before dishonor
Don't trust a soul
Fear god

If you ain't a friend of me then you an enemy
These niggas not who they pretend to be
I swear I look at niggas differently
That's why I always keep the grip with me
Got to stay up on my toes, they can't see me froze
My heart is cold, I don't trust a soul
(I can't trust a soul)

The devil knocking but god got me, yeah god got me
I'm out here grinding, J's on, in my white jockey with my posse
Just three niggas, my niggas, Lola, Rell, and Danger
And don't disrespect any one of my niggas cause that's just gon' bring danger
I got anger in me cause my other half ain't here with me
And no care in me, I don't give a fuck about nothing
And fuck you if you ain't down with me
Just bear with me, I'm hurt
And I know this world ain't perfect
But they took my brother, my only brother
He's six feet under that surface
My soul dropped when I walked inside that church
I was nervous, to see him in a casket, tragic
That shit really had me going, ooh, magic
That nigga that killed him is locked up
But that Glock tucked for that bastard

If you ain't a friend of me then you an enemy
These niggas not who they pretend to be
I swear I look at niggas differently
That's why I always keep the grip with me
Got to stay up on my toes, they can't see me froze
My heart is cold, I don't trust a soul
(I can't trust a soul)

Life, I swear that bitch ain't no joke
I have no hope, holding on to that thin rope
My heart cold, I need ten coats
I'm heartless, careless, I could care less
Fear less, I don't fear niggas
I don't fear bitches, I don't fear death
I don't fear y'all, I fear god, and that's all that I fear
Cause I know when I'm at my lows, gotta carry my loads, he gon' be right there
And my mama hurtin', that's why I'm working
To make her better cause she deserves it
A bigger house, bigger cars, expensive purses
Any purchase she want to make, she can make that
If I want your shine I'ma take that
Have my niggas coming out of that Maybach
Know they cocking that trey back
Push your wig piece way back
Niggas know we don't play that
We don't play around
This Redlyfe, you getting down or laying down pussy

If you ain't a friend of me then you an enemy
These niggas not who they pretend to be
I swear I look at niggas differently
That's why I always keep the grip with me
Got to stay up on my toes, they can't see me froze
My heart is cold, I don't trust a soul
(I can't trust a soul)

I ain't no killer but don't try me
I'm an army by myself but my niggas right behind me
Got my brother watching over me
And I got that Glock 30 loaded right here close to me
I got some niggas that will kill for me
Life ain't no joke, this shit is real to me
I'm grinding cause I gotta make a profit
And I gotta get this money, being broke is not an option, no

If you ain't a friend of me then you an enemy
These niggas not who they pretend to be
I swear I look at niggas differently
That's why I always keep the grip with me
Got to stay up on my toes, they can't see me froze
My heart is cold, I don't trust a soul
(I can't trust a soul)
