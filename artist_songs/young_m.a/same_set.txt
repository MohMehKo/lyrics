It's lit
It's lit

Uh, red cup and the wood tip
I'm just tryna clear my mind from the bullshit
I got ninety-nine problems, money ain't one
They be talkin' bad bitches but I date one
Money stackin', pistol packin', what that talk 'bout?
Bitch I'm gettin' forty bands on the walk out
Yeah I blew a little money but my bills paid
I woke up the next day and I'm still paid
I remember when I barely had a dollar on me
I remember ducking cops 'cause I got it on me
Went from plain gold chains, now I'm watered down
Now I drink to my success and that water brown

We them niggas
Always see me with the same set
We make money, we don't make threats
While they pay attention we get pay checks
When they throwing shade we just play catch

Getting money with my set now
When I'm praying is the only time my head down
Popping bottles, I'm all wet now
Told my city I won't let up, I won't let down (Brooklyn)
Chain is ocky, wrist is rocky, what that talk 'bout?
I just bagged twenty bitches on the walk out
Honestly, knowing me, I won't hit them up
And if they try to hit me up I ain't picking up
Life was a living hell, now we living well
And we drink champagne like it's ginger ale
And we stand on the couch while my song playin'
Up in VIP like we ain't got no home training

We them niggas
Always see me with the same set
We make money, we don't make threats
While they pay attention we get pay checks
When they throwing shade we just play catch

Bob Marleys and Gorilla Glue
Out in Cali, getting cloudy with my hitter Blue
Uh, you aight ma? yeah we good
And if I had to make a wish, I wish you niggas would
Put my Cartiers on for the shade throwers
At first they was fucking with us then they changed on us
And we right back popping and they back again
And these hoes back thotting and they back again
In the Yams with some Jordans, on our scooter bikes
They was claiming that they do it but don't do it right
It's not about what you got, it's 'bout who you are
'Cause we don't need foreign cars to get foreign broads

'Cause we them niggas
Always see me with the same set
We make money, we don't make threats
While they pay attention we get pay checks
When they throwing shade we just play catch

But nah for real
We really be in the Yams on them scooter bikes bro
We got the Jordans on the back of them
And all that
Then we see these niggas comin' down the strip in foreign cars
And we be laughin' 'cause
When you look inside of them
It's just niggas, no girls, niggas
Fuck outta here
We them niggas
