Ain't nothing like that good ole' liquor nigga
Yo punch what up man

If you ain't got no haters, you ain't poppin'
If you ain't got no paper, you ain't poppin'
I got that now, I got that later, what you coppin'?
I got that loud, I got that stink, I got that rotten

I finesse, I collect, I deposit
That's probably why your bitch is in my comments
I say come and get this dick
She say, "Where? Nigga stop it"
I said I got that 8 inch in the closet
Yea they hatin', but they watchin'
Fuck being in my bag, I'm in my wallet
Mad hoes, mad hoes I admit I be thottin'
I get pussy from my looks, you get pussy from you pockets
I don't care if she foreign, I don't care if she exotic
I like women from the hood, that'll pop it if they cock it
When we driven and we hear that "woop woop", yea them sirens
She don't run, she be the one to take the work and she hide it
And now they looking looking they won't find it
And now her pussy smell like that exotic
Y'all can have that foreign from the island
Ain't nothing like a down bitch from the projects

If you ain't Red Lyfe, you ain't poppin'
And if the head ain't right, she ain't ridin'
You ain't heard Young M.A., the trendin' topic
We fuckin' up some commas, you just common

Like a skateboard on the rail, we just grindin'
To be honest, I just do it, I don't promise
Ignore the haters they just want to get acknowledged
My account, match the numbers on my mileage
If they ain't talkin' what we talkin' we ain't signin'
Nope, nope, no John Hancockin'
On my way to the top, slowly comin'
Had to kick down the door, they ain't hear when I was knockin'
Now I'm wildin'
On any track I get on, I demolish
Cuz, rap is all I know, I said fuck goin' to college
I already got the knowledge
On what I'm trynna accomplish
Nobody's in my alignment
Young M.A., Brooklyn's Finest

You wearin' foreigns with no car, you ain't poppin
If you don't know who we are, you ain't poppin'
You poppin' other niggas bottles, you ain't poppin
Shawty you ain't trynna swallow you ain't poppin'

If you ain't reppin' Brooklyn, you ain't poppin'
If you ain't reppin' Brooklyn, you ain't poppin'
If you ain't reppin' Brooklyn, you ain't poppin' nigga
If you ain't reppin' Brooklyn, you ain't poppin' nigga
Shout out to punch, you reppin' Brooklyn cuz you poppin' nigga
Cuz we only reppin' Brooklyn, cuz we poppin' nigga (Huh?)
Brooklyn we poppin' nigga
It's BK, and we poppin' nigga
We reppin' Brooklyn, cuz we poppin' nigga (Huh?)
We reppin' Brooklyn, cuz we poppin' nigga
It's Brooklyn
