[Young M.A:]
From standing on the blocks bopping
Speakers knocking, cops watching, cock blocking
Weed bags all in my jeans, yeah them hot pockets
Nickel and diming, out here grinding, tryna make a profit
To dropping some of the hottest verses Brooklyn's ever heard
These hatin' niggas know they listen but won't say a word
That's why I'm getting on these beats to get on they nerves
I'm tryna school you lil niggas, damn well what they learn?
I'm from where you got the work or you getting served
Where pigeon birds don't fly, they walkin' on them curbs
The pretty bitches act boujie, niggas getting curved
Steel cases, drinking Henny, rollin' up the herb
I'm old school so I still be bumping that old shit
Old heads like eight, I stack grown folk shit
Went from jumping turnstiles to my own whip
Went from wearing no chains to all gold shit
Money never fold shit

[Mr. Mann:]
I'm outside with my peoples
What happened on that corner's illegal
Went from getting dressed to that Henny
Roll them quarters and no we don't spend a penny
I'm outside with my peoples
What happened on that corner's illegal
Went from getting dressed to that Henny
Roll them quarters and no we don't spend a penny

[Young M.A:]
My niggas ride for me, they ride for me
When I'm alone I keep that nina on the side of me
I'm from the era of zoning and busting pieces
Copping them new releases just to rock for the weekend
Running from the polices, they shooting us for no reason
Lurking, just to cuff us and bring us right to the precinct
Forever repping my city, still riding and popping wheelies
Still rolling up with the [?] and no we don't fuck with them fillies, no
Got to do it for the kids too
Cause whatever kids see is what them kids do
And yeah them kids is just kids, true
But whatever that kid did is cause that kid knew
Every day we in them liquor stores
Buying bottles of that Henny, drink it 'til it's gone
Then we hit the corner store, buy a pack of raw
Rollin' up the kush, smoke it 'til it's gon'

[Mr. Mann:]
I'm outside with my peoples
What happened on that corner's illegal
Went from getting dressed to that Henny
Roll them quarters and no we don't spend a penny
I'm outside with my peoples
What happened on that corner's illegal
Went from getting dressed to that Henny
Roll them quarters and no we don't spend a penny
It's that hood love
