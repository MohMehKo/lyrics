It's Brooklyn
It's Redlyfe, it's Redlyfe
It's M.A

I write hit after hit, I get bitch after bitch
But I don't love these hoes I should walk with a limp
With a cane or a stick yelling trick I'm a pimp, sheesh
My shooters got grip after grip, got a clip at the clip
Aim right at your nose, red dot they won't miss
Got the game, got the fifth, pussyboy take your pic, sheesh
I drink Henn' after Henn', I get bent, I get bent
Pass the blunt to the bro, he said bro what is this?
This is sour and piff nigga just like the spliff, sheesh
Yeah, I'ma trip on the trip man I swear I ain't shit
Treat these bitches like pits they act up, get 'em fixed
Turn that man to a bitch, now come here give me kiss, pussy
If it don't make cents it don't make any sense
It's 'bout stacking your bricks, only 100's and 50's
I'm a hundred percent, when I rap on my drift
Cause I talk with my eyes and I see with my lips
Means, I say what I see and I see what I speak
Got this rap shit nipped, nipped in the bud
I'm not showing no love cause that love get you clipped, raahh
