Am backing and cocking and popping your pistol
I hear you I get you
But am loading them rockets
Am shooting them missiles
And aiming at tissues
Infra-red beam with a smoke
On top so you know I won't
Miss you
You a lame nigga, so your niggas
Won't miss you, shit they can go
With you
My bullets raining shit
Don't even drizzle
My shit is official, because my shit
Would lift you
My niggas don't tell
We don't talk to officials
Or the police or the people
Who whistle
No snitching no ratting no telling
No, no, no, no none of that shit
None of that shit
But we do hold shot-ties
That put holes in bodies
Make niggas do back flips
This is red life nigga
We about that action
Pumping that ratchet
Bullets go boop! boop! boop!
Right through your packing
Now your collapsing
Bang bang nigga
Yo danger tell him its the pain gang nigga
I been doing this shit, my name rain nigga
My brother was a blood, I don't gang bang nigga
My dike ass bitches
Made a lot of dikes mad, I don't care because
I love the hate
I wasn't even go drop him, I was going to wait till
April but shit I don't want to wait
Some niggas was hating some bitches
Respecting, the bitches they loved it
Some dikes can't take it
It hurt him so bad it was sick to their
Stomach
My young niggas they rob you in public
They tell you run it
Put that thing to your stomach
And they tell you be quite
You better say nothing
No respect for these niggas
Pull out the choppa and be wetting these
Niggas, you, you, you, and the rest of these
Niggas, better pray to god, because its
Death for these niggas
Am a threat to these niggas because when my shit drop
Am effecting these niggas
Every time am in the booth am effecting
But tell em pull through I got a tec for these
Niggas
Ever since my brother dies yeah my mind
Ain't really been right
That's why I got this nine if you get out of line
You would be calling for Christ
Cause if I don't kill you I make sure that you never walk
Again in your life
We fuck niggas up, but my niggas are shooters
My niggas don't fight, I'll take your bitch
And I'll fuck her that night
Your bitch ain't faithful
Am fucking your wife
Am fucking her right
Your bitch is a freak
You should see what she do when
We turn off the lights, (she a thot nigga)
You bitches is trifle but nigga you wifed

I just wanted to pipe her
And put my strap init
Eight inches inside her
And for you pussy ass niggas

How she grip
When she gets cocked she be cocking at lips
I love how her handle feel hot in my grips
