Young boy named Teddy, 'bout 22
Lil nigga was a goon with that 22
Fly lil nigga had bitches too
Scammed for a living, had riches too
Had a whole lot of niggas with him getting into
But Teddy was that nigga that was getting that food
Had a lot of bitches fiending to fuck with him
Had a lot of young niggas looked up to him
Riding through the hood in them foriegns
Engine running, patron pouring
Weed smoking, gun loaded
Money clips folded, I'm in the open
Lil nigga was caught up in the lifestyle
Old cats told lil nigga pipe down
He was too flashy, he was too loud
He was in too deep, didn't know how
So one day he was heading home
From the strip club with a stripper bitch
Then realized it was two niggas that followed him
In a different whip
When he pulled up to his condo
Two niggas hopped out of that Tahoe
Baow baow baow, where them shots go
Headshots, left the nigga's mind blown
The stripper bitch wasn't down with him
From the strip club she was plotting
She was cold hearted, she ain't give a fuck
Long as she got her profit
Nigga had ten grand in his pocket
Nigga popped him and then robbed him
And what's fucked up is for them bands
It was his own mans that lobbed him

You niggas better watch 'em
Niggas out here plottin'
Niggas out here plottin'
Niggas out here plottin'
Young boy better watch 'em
