Counting all this money with the pain's
Counting all this money with the pain's
Counting all this money with the pain's
Fresh up off the plane
Now look at all these bitch niggas hating, looking sour
Broke boys talking, making minimum a hour
Two bad jaws, backseat of my Sonata
Light skin, brown skin, Hennessy colada
Got a couple shooters that ain't talking, they just pop up
A couple rowdy niggas that ain't scared to throw they block up
Bet I won't murder all these rappers, put your gwap up
Bars on point like my barber with the line up
Tryna get your fame up
Pussy get your bank up
Lame dykes tryna use my name to get they name up
Making with your main chick and that pussy laid up
Yeah, I got a big strap, I fuck her her brains up
Then I take her in the kitchen, that coochie dripping
Shorty got that fat cat and that pussy hissing
When we done I make her cook and, she clean them dishes
Then she go back home to her nigga until she miss it
Now look at all these bum niggas
No money having, yeah them scrub niggas
We everywhere like some crumbs nigga
I'm in her stomach like some tumms nigga
Shot out my bloods and my cuz niggas
Them thug niggas
Them hustlers that hustle for them funds nigga
To all my bitches they get it, they in them clubs with us
Cause we throwing this money now they in love with us

Fucking with the set
Cause they know we up next

Now look at all these dyke bitches hating, looking sour
I beef with being broke, cause bitch I'm 'bout a dollar
But my pistol, always cocked and I pop it like a collar
They love me then they hate me, god damn make your mind up
Then they on my dick, they on my dick, they on my dick
And since you like to suck come here nigga, blow the grip
Do my ShMoney dance, ah ah, hit the Diddy bop
And I don't really dance but I will still hit that Milly Rock
I flame it like a hot pot
I know you saw me on that hot box (Cee-Lo!)
With Funk Flex on that Hot 9
Shit I been busy like a hotline
Fucking with me, now the knot mine
I got 10 jobs, I don't get tired
Shot out to Fox tryna get me on that Empire
And first I had to turn down, wasn't up to par
Cause it's Young M.A , bitch fuck is Betty Bar
How I see it is how I call it
I met Lee Dames at Swizz's office
A whole room full of bosses
Making a young bitch feel important
I swear y'all don't make no sense
So, all the haters thanks for hating and promoting my shit
I got more views, more hoes to choose
More money, new car, more clothes and shoes
Doing shows in DC, RI, CT
And I know you see me on Revolt TV
Got legends in the game bringing me on stage
Got the crowd nuts like a fucking parade
Girls pussies get wet just from touching my braids
I rep Redlyfe and I don't give a fuck what you claim
Forget the summer, I'm taking over the rest of the years
I'm 'bout to make it real rough like niggas with beards
All I know is be tough, I don't know how to fear
Yeah they talk tough but I never believe what I hear
To beat me, you gon' need a full leaf and a prayer
Fuck a bag, I'm in a chair with my feet in the air
And I dare a thot bitch tryna get in her bag
I make her get out my car and make her get in the cab
Being broke ain't a joke, but I'm paid so I laughed
My ass to the bank, get money don't hate nigga
