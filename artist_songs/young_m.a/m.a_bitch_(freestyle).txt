Huh?

My niggas smashed, drunk off Henny black
High off kush and shit

My niggas gripping, better not catch you slipping
Niggas scared, they really scared
They screaming stop the killing
Oh my god, inmate got them bars

Don't care who you are or who in charge
Don't care who involved
Redlyfe famous for having them bangers, call us shooting stars
Pull up on your block, pull out the Glock
Hop out them hoopty cars

We clear it out, we shootin' near your house
Pussy boy you talking shit

Gutter nigga, came from nothing nigga
We already got them guns, it's time to get that butter nigga
Cut a nigga, pistol butt a nigga, then we dump the nigga

I'm on my magic shit
Making rappers disappear
The rabbit in the hat and shit
Now all you dykes wanna be rappers now

The throne I took it, sitting on this cushion
Crown on, with a yellow bone, look like vanilla pudding
Cock it bitch, I need a cocky bitch
Buffy, the body thick

She wet, on some tsunami shit
Don't try me bitch, that nine beside me bitch

And we got that work, we carry mollys and them oxys bitch
Nigga you know who my posse is
Well he'll figure it out when that Tommy spit, copy bitch
We take the cash in that Jason mask, on some hockey shit
The noses on them rifles look like hockey sticks, snipe a bitch
They like Ma you gotta chill, please put the gun away
No fuck that, you better run away
Bitch it's Young M.A
