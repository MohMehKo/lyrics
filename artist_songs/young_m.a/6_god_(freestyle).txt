I heard niggas sleeping on me
And I got the heater just incase they creeping on me
Niggas booking me for shows 'cuz they know that I'm a problem
Tell my niggas get a plate, we gon eat, nomore starving
Big homie li that's my muhfuckin nigga
And the big homie jay said imma make you richer
I'm workin' workin' workin' January to December
Gotta grind cuz ain't nothing like the feeling of a winner
I'm trynna live life got a lot on my agenda
In puerto Rico ridin' 4 wheelers in the winter
I wanna be a boss, ion wanna be a killer
And yeah I got the work but ion wanna be a dealer
I wanna be something muhfuckas can remember
Ya niggas yelling sign her somebody better get her
I remember when you rappers ain't never wanna listen
Ma you gotta chill, nah nigga I ain't finish
Its time you pay attention, a beast is in existence
Fuck having bars, nigga I'm the prison
Ion see no competition, only money in my vision
Yo ma they hatin' on you, its funny that you mention
Cuz first they hate on you, then they duplicate ya image
Yeah you could say I'm wack, that ain't a fact that's ya opinion
And yeah you prolly rap, but that don't mean you gifted
You could talk about money, but that don't mean you get it ah man
Ya done got me heated cuz all you niggas trash, it must be what you eat
Yo why the fuck these niggas breathing
Yo tell these wack rappers beat it
I'm grindin' all mornin' all noon and all evening
No resting no nappin' no laying no sleeping
We working all weeeeek and all weekend
The hustle is a drug so fuck it I'm od-ing
And I know you dykes watchin me, I already peeped it
You could never bee me so pussy keep dreaming
I'm a nightmare, this pipe here leave you right there
Red liiife, that's the gang we don't fight fair
I'm so ahead of you niggas, light-years
Check after check after check no night airs
Put the hot thing to ya head leave a price there
They like that's a nigga spitting, nah that's a dyke there
Put ya money where ya mouth at or put the mic there
I'm gettin' money, bitches wanna cuff, don't have time there
She said she want paradise well I can bring ya mind there
Open up ya legs put my mmm all inside there
I'm a queen with a k sitting in my high chair
Nigga I'm from brooklyn you could lose ya life there
Niggas can't rap and they people lyin' to em
Nigga I'm a beast I'm a fucking lion to em
Ooo you ain't tuff, why the fuck you lying to em
That's the type of shit that make me put the iron to em
Put the fire to em
Fuck a lion, I'm a giant to em
