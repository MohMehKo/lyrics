Henny in my cup
In my whip with a slut
I'm a squirrel in the world
I just wanna bust a nut

M.A never slip
Deuce deuce on my hip
That'll put a nigga out
Like he ain't pay the rent
I will never love a hoe
I'll forever be a pimp
I don't wanna hear you talk
I just wanna feel your lips
Hoes say I ain't shit
I agree, I agree
But why have 1 chick when I can have 2 or 3
Getting dome like the Greeks
Got kush in the leaf
Got a fresh pair of feets
Not a stain not a crease
100 grand in the brief
God damn what a week
Rule number 1, you gotta vamp, never sleep
Gotta move with a gun
Never ran, never weep
Niggas out here, tripping
Waiting to see you slipping
Pay attention b

Drinking Henny out the bottle
With a bad Jawn that could fuck, suck or swallow
With a 22 in my sock
And I wish a nigga would
But he not, regular
Boy we getting money, regular
In the V with a honey, regular
Got a whole lot of haters, regular
Went from local to major, regular
I through money at the strippers, regular
I turn up with my niggas, regular

Ah, Hollered at my nigga Black
Asked him, "Where its at?"
He said, "We headed to the [?] Ima hit you back"
I said, "Bet, be there soon, did you bring the strap?"
He said, "Of course, never lack, everywhere with that"
Regular, I'm doing 80 sipping on this yack
The Homie Jah in the front
The hoes in the back
About to link my other guys out in Brownsville
Never ran, never will, yeah you know the deal
I'm tryna get her out her skirt
Out her shirt and heels
Guys grabbing on her ass
"Woah, nigga chill"
He said, "No problem, just a nigga tryna get a feel"
I feel you homie, hey if there's a way there's a will
Got a bottle of that Henny in my hand, Regular
Your girl liking all my pictures on the Gram, Regular
Got a couple bands in my pants, Regular
I'm from the borough, Never run, never ran, Regular
M.A got the streets on lock, Regular
And it's still middle finger to the cops, Regular
Momma got that curry chicken in the pot, Regular
Eating good, you can tell I eat a lot, Regular
Momma raised me, cause my daddy wasn't there, Regular
Still fly, doesn't matter what I wear, Regular
Heartless to the hoes
Never cared
Stay prepared
Gotta Keep the Nina near
I got the goons with me
Fuck the haters
They ain't cool with me
Redlyfe we the set though
When I move, they gon' move with me
And my lady can't stand me
She don't want nothing to do with me
I'm a jerk
I'm a flirt
I'm a freak
I got a different bitch, everyday of the week
I got 99 problems
And my money ain't one
Being broke wasn't cool, had to go and make some

Drinking Henny out the bottle
With a bad Jawn that could fuck, suck or swallow

But he not, regular
Boy we getting money, regular
In the V with a honey, regular
Got a whole lot of haters, regular
