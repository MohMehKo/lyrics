Called the homie Jay like let's go get this money man
Now when I find out ten or not I need a hundred bands
So we started working working 'til that cash came
All of the sudden all these bitches want my last name

The way these niggas hate I hope they get a check for it
Maybe not, but you get checked for it
I hope you pay your bills before you pay attention
How you a hatin' ass nigga 'bout to get evicted?
You old cornboat nigga wearin' panties plus some drawers on
Nigga cheerleader on pom poms
Niggas see the barrel on this gun I call 'em long johns nigga
When it shot you'll be long gone nigga
We mix that Henny with that Ros√©
We drink Henny with that OJ
We drink Henny out the bottle straight, no chase
Where you at? we at your ho place
Took a picture with your chick, but she had her head in my lap
Face down, every time when I'm [?]
Then I put the picture on the gram and I tagged her man
I don't give a damn, with a caption that said no face no case

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Old timey ass nigga, you ain't got a job
Now we gettin' all this money we ain't gotta rob
Gettin' money ain't the problem it's just keeping it
Pain Gang, that's the team that I'm eating with
Dreams came true 'cause we believed in it
It's Redlyfe motherfucker and I'm bleeding it
I represent BK nigga, fuck the cops and the DEA nigga
Fuck a snitch and the he say she say nigga
Old honey bun cheesecake nigga
Goons run up like a relay nigga
It's no games, no EA nigga
Eat your food and leave you with a clean plate nigga
Fuck a fraud, fake three face nigga
Put you in a box like a sweepstakes nigga
We mixing sour with that cherry kush
Why you smokin' on that Reggie Bush?

Fuck your opinion, I'm in love with money and women
If she want to be a thot then that's her decision
She ain't complaining, she ain't mad, upset, or offended
She grown, leave her alone, if she with it she with it
Money ruin, when you get it you flip it
I'm lying, cause as soon as I get it I spend it
But fuck it, I'm living, I'm living
Soon as I feel I'm going broke, I fix it, I fix it
Two jesus heads as if I'm religious
God the only man I ever commit with
Dear lord, I'm sinning, I'm sinning
I know this Henny is the devil, I hope I'm forgiven

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
