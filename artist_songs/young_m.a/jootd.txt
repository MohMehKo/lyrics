It's just one of them days
When I wanna be all alone
It's just one of them days
When I gotta be all alone
It's just one of them days
When I wanna be all alone
It's just one of them days
When I gotta be all alone
It's just one of them days

[Young M.A:]
Airplane mode on these hoes
That's on the regular
Somebody's girlfriend blowing up my cellular
If I got head from ya I'm deadin' ya
Hit that decline button
I don't wanna be bothered baby, my mind running
I don't mind hitting that block button
I'm quick to block something
I'm quick to block a thot
Yeah I flop a lot, don't care if she hot or not
'Cause hoes get ignored every day B
Man she'll be aight
You keep worrying about me, girl you need a life
I got this blunt, now I need a light
No I don't need a wife
I'm moody, I don't want no groupies
I ain't in the mood for no coochie
I don't wanna talk to Kim, Jessica, and Julie
They don't really love me, they just wanna do me and use me

[Young M.A:]
Nike slippers and sweatpants
Bitch I'm comfortable
If I don't really fuck with you then I'm dubbing you
I'm just stacking this cheese up like a Lunchable
It's just, one of those day-ay-ay-ays
Just one of those days
She text me like why you playing these games?
You know I'm stuck in my ways, why you seem so amazed?
Let me be in my zone, let me be on my own
Now she in her feelings like fuck it go be alone
Why you doing all that, you ain't even all that
Put her on the blocked list, now she can't call back
I can never fall off, bitch I just fall back
Thought I was the one, I'm like nah, why you thought that?
I just let her argue with herself, I don't talk back
Since I ain't the one
Now girl are you finished or you done?
(Are you done? are you dumb?)
