I just want the Audi R8 with the matte black paint on it
Hoping that them niggas don't hate on it
New York plates on it with my own name on it
Young M.A on it, just wait on it

They say that I manipulate the youth
Nah, don't get it wrong, I speak the truth
This is deeper than the roots, look around you see the proof
No excuse, but what you see is nothing new
They saying that I'm rich but I ain't rich yet
I ain't count a hundred M's yet
I ain't buy the Beamer and the Benz yet
And I ain't fuck all of her friends yet
My mama said I ain't about a dollar
'Cause a dollar just a dollar, only God can make you prosper
And baby when you do it do it proper
And if they ain't tryna hear, you better holler
And only wife a chick if she a scholar
If she down then she a rider
She been with you from the bottom, 'cause
Nowadays it's been kind of hard to find 'em 'cause
Every bitch a prima donna, a hundred on the highway
Riding in the Hyundai
Glock on the side 'cause they
Lookin' at me sideways
Gotta make a quick move, grindin' 'cause the rent due
I hear them guys talkin' 'bout me, homie that's a bitch move
That is what a bitch do, I'm guessing you a bitch too
Finding Nemo with the chopper
Feed them niggas fish food
Loyal to my last breath, ridin' 'til the wheels fall
But I'ma still ride man, even when the wheels off
I know who really fuck with me
I know who only want from me
You ain't gotta tell me that
I know the difference luckily
That's why I keep my eyes wide
That's why I keep a side-eye
And I keep a long nose
Ready for you wise guys

I just want the Audi R8 with the matte black paint on it
Hoping that them niggas don't hate on it
New York plates on it with my own name on it
Young M.A on it, just wait on it

Rich and famous
But I just want the money, I don't want that fame shit
Hanging with them guys that's armed and dangerous
Cut some niggas off, had to make some changes
'Cause they was on that same, they was on that same shit
I just gotta go and get it, I don't have no patience
I'm that get this money, stay in my lane shit
That's upgrade, self-paid, self-made shit, M.A

Uhh, I wanna sip white Henny in the white Bentley
I wanna sip moonshine by the poolside
I wanna count hundos in the condos
Pull a blunt two times then I woosah pool side
Eating lobsters and steak by the lake
I wanna have a feast by the beach
Looking at the waves, looking at the waves
I wanna feel the sand on my feet
I just wanna eat, I just wanna eat, I don't wanna sleep
I just wanna grind, I just wanna keep, making money
I don't wanna beef, no I ain't pussy, no I ain't sweet
But if the pussy sweet I'ma eat (Ooouuu)
