Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh

Waking up to kiss you and nobody's there
The smell of your perfume still stuck in the air
It's hard
Yesterday I thought I saw your shadow running 'round
It's funny how things never change in this old town
So far
From the stars

And I wanna tell you everything
The words I never got to say the first time around
And I remember everything
From when we were the children playing in this fairground
Just there with you now

If the whole world was watching I'd still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you
Mmmmm

I saw that you moved on with someone new
In the pub that we met he's got his arms around you
It's so hard
So hard

And I want to tell you everything
The words I never got to say the first time around
And I remember everything
From when we were the children playing in this fairground
Just there with you now

'Cause if the whole world was watching I'd still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you

You still make me nervous when you walk in the room
Them butterflies-they come alive when I'm next to you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you

Oh-ohh

Mmmmm

And I know that it's wrong (I know that it's wrong)
I can't move on (I can't move on)
There's something 'bout you

'Cause if the whole world was watching I'd still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you

You still make me nervous when you walk in the room
Them butterflies-they come alive when I'm next to you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you
Everything comes back to you

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
