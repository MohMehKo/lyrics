Well you know me with that ancient gaze, stripping down with yesterday's eyes
You know me as I was, you see me as I will be
And I still had a lot of growing, when you took me and you shaped me with those hands
You know me better than myself, make me better than I am

Oh, you know me well
Know me well, know me well
Oh, you know me well
Know me well, know me well

When I think about my past, I see our love too many years before you came
In my hopes and my dreams, with the wax and the moon wanes
And you saw what I could be, please teach me how to be what I was meant to be
See without you I was nothing, but with you I can be anything

Oh, you know me well
You know me well, know me well
Oh, you know me well
You know me well, know me well

What can I fear, when I know that I walk by your side?
You're the fortress, within which I got nothing to hide
None can take me, I'm the tower the world cannot fell
'Cause I'm stronger, when I know that you know me well

You know me well
Know me well
Oh, you know me well
Know me well, know me well
