Summer thunder come again,
You roll like history,
Your memory my oldest friend,
Been here before you see,
But show me once more,
I wouldn't spark that civil war in me,
Oh, how many times must lighting strike in the same place till you'll call it trouble,
Oh, how many times must lighting strike in the same place till you'll call it trouble.
Summer thunder come again,
You're hard to wish away
I just keep on drifting with your rain,
Charmed by dangers,
Sweet introduction,
But all it ever did for me was drive me to distraction,
Oh, how many times must lighting strike in the same place till you'll call it trouble,
Oh, how many times must lighting strike in the same place till you'll call it trouble,
Oh just let it go!
It's time to let it go.
