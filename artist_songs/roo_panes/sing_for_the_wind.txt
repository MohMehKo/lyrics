It's said I run like a stubborn tide
Unstoppable, untamed and wild
But a brave face isn't brave I've learned
And as I searched for wisdom I remembered your words
You told me "sing for the wind my love
Fear not for tomorrow
Cos love's the journey of a lifetime
And where you finish isn't where you start"
So tomorrow doesn't worry me
And though the path be untravelled at least I'm free
To be great not just to be
That's what your wise old words taught me
You told me "sing for the wind my love
Fear not for tomorrow
Cos love's the journey of a lifetime
And where you finish isn't where you start"
