Down by the waters
Where I once dreamed
Beneath a silver moon they will find me

My heart a pilgrim, my mind a slave
Oh! My eyes can't stand to see the light of day
'Cause life is lost without love wouldn't you say

I want you to would follow, me to my peace
And then meet your hands all beneath your knees

My love is faithful, your love is true
And I know the silver moon will shine for you
Oh! I know the silver moon will shine for you
