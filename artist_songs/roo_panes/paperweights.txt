I'll show you I'm not made of stone,
How could I breeze when there's this flow below.
I'm afraid to flood until you tell me you can swim.
But these words will not wait under paperweights anymore,
You say I paint the truth, so watch these colours run.
They'll lead you back to where it begun.
You tell me you can take it all,
And none of my warnings make you feel less small.
Oh you tell me it is time to let the letters fly the page.
So these words will not wait under paperweights anymore,
You say I paint the truth, so watch these colours run,
They'll lead you back to where it begun.
Well can you hear it coming?
The thunder of a being?
The tales of a lifetime?
The weight of mountains climbed?
Are you not afraid of what it all may look like on the other side of truth?
No longer bullet proof?
