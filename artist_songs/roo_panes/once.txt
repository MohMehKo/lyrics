I tried to part the sea
Find wonders for your love
I sought the best of me
But all I showed was what I couldn't be
Your hush was a beauty I'd not seen
Your kindness made a gentle wreck of me
Once hope found hope
And once I traveled winter with the sun
Your heart was my home
The rest of me will roam into tomorrow, my love
For Tomorrow there's love, there's love!
I climbed the highest heights where the sightless go to see
Fixed fate with steely eyes told her it was not the time for me
But some things that you give you can't retrieve
And I wait for a day I'll never see
Once hope found hope
And once I traveled winter with the sun
Your heart was my home
The rest of me will roam into tomorrow, my love
For Tomorrow there's love, there's love!
It was like the moon tide
Always rise and then fall
But now its dead and I'm done
And I won't cry for you no more
I the lonely captive stand with only memories to hold my hand
But I'd not change a single thing twas the best and worst of time
Beneath the yellow clouded moon
Where buried hopes rise from their tombs
The whispers call to heaven above
That you caught me up in the windy arms of love
That you caught me up in the windy arms of love
Oh you caught me up in the windy arms, the windy arms of love
Oh you caught me up in the windy arms, the windy arms of love
Oh you caught me up in the windy arms, the windy arms of love
Oh you caught me up in the windy arms, the windy arms of love
