An avenue once bent in shadow,
In a morning straight and hallow.
You hold high a destination,
You sing to me of sweet revelation.
I feel the quickening in my step,
But I don't even touch the ground.

'Cause when I'm seeing double,
It's your lullaby love that keeps me from trouble,
It's your lullaby love that's keeping me level,
It's your lullaby love that keeps me awake.

When this voice retires from talking,
When these ears are tired of ringing.
When my feet get bored of travelling,
And it looks like it's all unravelling.
When this heart's too old for dreaming,
That's when I hear the angels sing your lullaby.

'Cause when I'm seeing double
It's your lullaby love that keeps me from trouble,
It's your lullaby love that's keeping me level,
It's your lullaby love that keeps me awake.

'Cause when I'm seeing double
It's your lullaby love that keeps me from trouble,
It's your lullaby love that's keeping me level,
It's your lullaby love that keeps me awake.
