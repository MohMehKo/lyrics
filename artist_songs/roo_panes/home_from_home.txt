Bright young sun, looks like the morning's come
And it's all come so easy like the heavens are wishing me well
And those darkening eyes brought forth my own sunrise
Well it's been a long time since the beat of my heart was a friend
Well it's been a long time since I thought I was breathin' again
In you I've found my home from home
I left all that I knew for a love that I know
Some fresh air, open breeze, mod nice, white and these
Wondering in wonder, wondering what pondering we'll do
See I don't care about what when or where because I'm starting to realize the question worth asking is you
Oh I'm startin' to realize the question worth answerin' is you
In you I've found my home from home
I left all that I knew for a love that I know
And that grip you prized me from
I was already trying to lose
It was holding me, to hold me back from you!

Guess it's funny, this twofold irony
Guess it's funny, this twofold irony
Greatest victory through my own defeat
Greatest victory through my own defeat
