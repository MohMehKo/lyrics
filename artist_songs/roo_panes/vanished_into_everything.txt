Even now I can see you
In my view somehow
I can hear you in the whispering rain
I can feel you in the air

I know your stare
The kind I cannot help but be aware
You have the strangest way of stealing wind
As if the world was breathing in

Oh, you're all around me
Since you vanished into everything
Oh, you're all around me
Since you vanished into everything

Oh, you vanished into everything
Oh, it's like you vanished into everything

There's a song
You've been composing while the days were long
The crescendo of the song was raw
The pits are colder with the dawn

And I can hear them
Since you vanished into everything
Oh, I can hear them
Since you vanished into everything
