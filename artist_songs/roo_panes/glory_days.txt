King of the ocean, riding the seven seas
But every thought of you is floating on the breeze
Every thought of you is floating on the breeze
Left to find Kingdoms but leaving a kingdom behind
Oh every thought of you is always on my mind
Every thought of you is always on my mind

Oh, your memory stronger than a thousand ships of war to call me home
And though it's glory I'm chasing it's from glory I run
Cos those glory days are done!

But I won't break, even when the earth around me shakes...
When the things that built us up have brought us down
Sometimes you have to leave the things you love for love!
Your siren's sigh, your whisper always louder than your cry
But your memory lives long beyond goodbye
But now I know that I have to leave and can't come back for you

Remember the winters, light hearts and the lonely trees
They're the memories I'll always keep with me
They're the memories I always keep with me
The wide world between us, still see you with each young sun
But now I have to tell myself those days are done
Now I have to tell myself those days are done!

Oh, your memory stronger than a thousand ships of war to call me home
And though it's glory I'm chasing it's from glory I run
Cos those glory days are done!

But I won't break, even when the earth around me shakes...
When the things that built us up have brought us down
Sometimes you have to leave the things you love for love!
Your siren's sigh, your whisper always louder than your cry
But your memory lives long beyond goodbye
But now I know that I have to leave and can't come back for you
