I was here, I was here

Once the world was only me
Now the world is only you
You gave me brighter eyes to see
That what I want is right in front of me

I pray some day you'll see the wonder that surrounds you
See through the blind fog that has bound you
'Cause every day, every day I live to see you live
And hear you say "I was here, I was here"

Many moons and still unchanged
I wish you'd stay this way forever
In every way of you, I'm one,
Whilst always searching for horizons

I pray some day you'll see the wonder that surrounds you
See through the blind fog that has bound you
'Cause every day, every day I live to see you live
And hear you say "I was here, I was here"

It seems that every moment is a memory when you're near.
Heart keeps beating - "I was here, I was here"
