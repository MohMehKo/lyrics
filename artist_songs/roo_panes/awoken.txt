I want the best of me,
I want to rest in peace,

I know I said tomorrow will be better than today.
I guess I'm just beginning to learn the way,
I know I said tomorrow will be better than today.
I guess I'm just beginning to learn the way,

I feel a dawn in me,
A tired man awoke,
An opportunity,
To live the words I spoke,

I know I said tomorrow I'll be better than today,
I guess I'm just beginning to learn the way,
I know I said tomorrow will be better than today,
I guess I'm just beginning to learn the way...

So here's my chance to say,
I'm sorry for my bold ways,
I feel like two different men,
The one who tries, the one who fails,
Again and again,

I know I said tomorrow will be better than today,
I guess I'm just beginning to learn the way,
I know I said tomorrow will be better than today,
I guess I'm just beginning to learn the way.
