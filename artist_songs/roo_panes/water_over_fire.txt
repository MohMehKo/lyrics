Well I fear I never look on you again,
That I have done enough to lose a truest friend
And I thought you'd never look me in the eye,
Because of all that I have done within your sight
But then I read your face and your lips were spelling grace
And it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
And we were face to face as their tears put out the flames
And it's alright it's alright it's alright

You're like water over fire
Like water on fire
You're like water over fire
Like water on fire

Well heat is not the only kind of haze
More than just the sun the sun was lengthening the days
I lost ground when I turned away my face
But I could feel your gravity and I am longing for you ways
Cause when I read your face I saw your lips were spelling grace
And it's alright it's alright it's alright
We were face to face as their tears put out the flames
And it's alright it's alright it's alright

You're like water over fire
Like water on fire
You're like water over fire
Like water on fire

You're like water over fire
Like water on fire
You're like water over fire
Like water on fire
