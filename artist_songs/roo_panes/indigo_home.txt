Dry eyes, roaring falls
God knows I've travelled far, so far
But this is where it ends
Found me, right about the time that I found you
For once, I was doing something right
Night fell, you were asked
Are you lost in paradise my love, or have you found a home?
It's an awfully lonely road to walk alone
But as I searched your flashing indigo eyes, it echoed true
That I loved you
That I loved you
Dawn woke, I knew that it was time for my return
But this time it will likely hurt as hell
Sometimes way across the ocean on a far away shore
We both stand and we both call, both call
If you give love and live long, then you'll never be alone
If you give love and live long, you you'll always have a home
If you give love and live long, then you'll never be alone
If you give love and live long, you you'll always have a home
Are you lost in paradise my love, or have you found a home?
It's an awfully lonely road to walk alone
But as I searched your flashing indigo eyes, it echoed true
That I loved you
That I loved you
We were lost in the fields trading tales of home
But everyone knew that your gaze was my home
We were lost in the fields trading tales of home
But everyone knew that your gaze was my home
