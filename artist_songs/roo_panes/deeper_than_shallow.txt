We were drifting deeper than shallow
Where the ripples went, I don't know
Mirror waters swam around my toes
I was deeper than shallow
Going deeper than shallow
Sight to see beyond reflection's dancing eyeline
And half-truth lessons
Like a skylight, you looked up at me
And said, "I see you."
And you were deeper than shallow
You were deeper than shallow
And I felt known for the very first time
And I felt seen for the very first time
And I felt loved for the very first time
Oh, I felt seen for the very first time
