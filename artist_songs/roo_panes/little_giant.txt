Thought that I was in my prime
But I was naked, dressed in my pride
You see through the things I hide
Yeah, still you said be yourself, you'll turn out alright

You made me run like I never run
Try like I never tried
Fight like I've never fought
Made me want it
You made me run like I've never run
Try like I've never tried
Fight like I've never fought
Made me want it

I'm always saying, I'll make it right my dear
'Cause losing you's my greatest fear
I know I found all the blame and decide
Yeah, still you said be yourself, you'll turn out alright

You make me run like I never run
Try like I've never tried
Fight like I've never fought
Made me want it
You make me run like I never run
Try like I've never tried
Fight like I've never fought
Made me want it

Who said it's easy, to be loved
When you look over your shoulder and only see the wasteland?
Just got to carry what you can
Have the heart of a giant, but know you're a man

Who said it's easy, to be loved
When you look over your shoulder and only see the wasteland?
Just got to carry what you can
Have the heart of a giant, but know you're a man

Start small, grow tall
Start small, grow tall
Start small, grow tall
Start small, grow tall
