Upwards I climbed, above me stretched the northern sky
Beneath the great night's height I fought alone
I was at war, both with myself and with it all
My own shadow now my home
No place to call my own

Storms may come
But wild tempests won't tear me away from your arms
I'll hold to the good and the true
I'll weather your storms for the stillness in you
That night I ran, ran, ran before the storm
That night I ran, ran, ran before the storm
That night I ran, ran, ran before the storm

All of this time, you said I gave too little
But I say you asked for too much
Cos love's a two edged sword and though I'm yours I'm mine
And you'd see if you dared that our moments
Were never owned only ever were they shared
For you there must be me, and for me there must be you

Storms may come
But wild tempests won't tear me away from your arms
I'll hold to the good and the true
I'll weather your storms for the stillness in you
That night I ran, ran, ran before the storm
That night I ran, ran, ran before the storm
That night I ran, ran, ran before the storm
Ancient love
I ran before the storm
No power to take me
Cause I was ever yours
Ancient love
I ran before the storm
No power to take me
Cause I was ever yours

That night I ran, ran, ran before the storm
That night I ran, ran, ran before the storm
That night I ran, ran, ran before the storm
