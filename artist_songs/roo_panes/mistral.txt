Child hold your tongue
Your time has come
Sure as the mistral blows beneath the rising sun
A new dawn broods with each new moon
Oh Child of the evergreen you'll shine amidst the gloom
You've found a breeze that's lifting you higher
You've found a love that's stoking a fire in You
And no-one can ever steal your throne
Your final foe, you feet they must let go
