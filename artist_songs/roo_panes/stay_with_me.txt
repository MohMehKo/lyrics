Well I've been everywhere, but I've been nowhere,
It was all viridian in vermillion blood.
There was a void before me; it was as deep as truth,
Because all the world couldn't hide the view of you.

Stay with me! Oh stay with me; you're right where you are supposed to be!
Stay with me! Oh stay with me; you're right where you are supposed to be!

You're my Eldorado; you're my holy grail,
I found my treasure through the rain and hail,
Knowing I was taller when upon my knees,
Knowing you'd back to me if I just said please! Please! Please!

Stay with me! Oh stay with me; you're right where you are supposed to be!

Oh you take me back to the morning light,
You take me back to the morning light,
The very moment that I found my sight,
You're forever by my side.
You take me back to the morning light,
You take me back to the morning light,
The very moment that I found my sight,
I'm forever by your side.
