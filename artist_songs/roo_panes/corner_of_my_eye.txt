Corner, of my eye
Corner, of my eye
There's no ignoring you
The lovable, kind, the magnated truth
Always across the room
Faster than thought
Distance is nothing for you
Well I've noticed that your star shines brightest
When seen out of the corner of my eye
And when I look at you,
You vanish
Maybe I'm just blinded by your light,
Maybe I'm just blinded by your light.
Somewhere, forever in sight,
If I cannot see
Then I'm blind as the night
North star, steady and true,
If I'm seeing blurred,
It's me that is spinning 'round you.
But I've noticed that your star shines brightest
When seen out of the corner of my eye
And when I look at you,
You vanish
Maybe I'm just blinded by your light,
Maybe I'm just blinded by your light.
Corner, of my eye
