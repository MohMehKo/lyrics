Well I've found what I need,
In your arms, in your arms,
What I need.
And there's nothing for me,
Outside your arms, outside your arms,
Nothing for me.

Because your, your love takes me where I want to go!
Oh your, your love takes me where I want to go!

There's a sweet,
Sweet disarray,
To the way you pave,
To the way you pave,
A sweet disarray.
Oh come on love!
Call me your own!
Because I know, you'll take me where I want to go.

Further than the eye can see,
But nearer than the air I breathe
I don't need to see the end,
To follow you all the way my friend.

Because your, your love takes us where we want to go!
Oh your, your love takes me where I want to go!
Your love takes me where I want to go,
Your love takes me where I want to go,
Your love takes me where I want to go,
Your love takes me where I want to go.
