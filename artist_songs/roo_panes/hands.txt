I will hold you as you held me
You gave me shelter, you gave me safety
You said, "Hold gently what you wish to grow old with
Like a sparrow in your hands that
Needs to fly
Hold gently what you wish to grow old with
Don't close those hands."
Ivory fingers, porcelain haven
Hands that tamed me, that named
And framed me
You said, "Hold gently what you wish to grow old with
Like a sparrow in your hands that
Needs to fly
Hold gently what you wish to grow old with
Don't close those hands."
So these hands of mine that have learnt through time
To be a brother, lover, father, friend
To try and let you fly
To circle other skies
To let you go
When you need to go
Oh they'll be open
They'll be waiting
