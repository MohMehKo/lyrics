Sleep, leave it behind
Lay all your burdens aside
For here, we have no time
So sleep and just leave it all behind

And all you have to do is call
And I'll come running to your side
I'll take the weight of your world from off your shoulders, girl
I'll take the weight of your world from off your shoulders, girl

Tomorrow's a new day
And yesterdays tales far away
All will be alright
So sleep and just leave it all behind

And all you have to do is call
And I'll come running to your side
I'll take the weight of your world from off your shoulders, girl
I'll take the weight of your world from off your shoulders, girl

Nothing can get you, you know I've got you, you're in my arms
Nothing can get me, I know you've got me, I'm in your arms
Nothing can get you, you know I've got you, you're in my arms
Nothing can get me, I know you've got me, I'm in your arms

So all you have to do is call
And I'll come running to your side
I'll take the weight of your world from off your shoulders, girl
I'll take the weight of your world from your shoulders, girl
