Open road, no one stopped you from trying
To lose your load, to find your silver lining
You left my side, because mother let you run and hide
But even from afar I hear you crying

Let me out of this cage, before I swell up with rage
Let me sing to old age before I'm done
Let me shout to the skies that I'm too young to die
And that fate will never stop me from trying

Finally found, the dreaming lived those ties unbound
That quest for peace, that hopeless search for sweet release
You've found your feet, but now they only run to meet
A hope that's hanging loosely whilst your crying

Let me out of this cage, before I swell up with rage
Let me sing to old age before I'm done
Let me shout to the skies that I'm too young to die
And that fate will never stop me from trying

Open road, you will only lead back home
Because you stole the heart, but your heart is still alone
You left my side, and mother let you run and hide
Because wisdom knows the eyes through which you're crying

Let me out of this cage, before I swell up with rage
Let me sing to old age before I'm done
Let me shout to the skies that I'm too young to die
And that fate will never stop me from trying
