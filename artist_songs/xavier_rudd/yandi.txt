Do you see me when you look from the east?
cus I feel you when I look from the west
Constellations from the middle of the sea
will you be there, will you be there waiting for me?

And a little bit of lovin' is maybe all you need you know
And a little bit of lovin' just to open up your heart and soul, soul, soul, soul
Maybe a little bit of yandi just to get you through to tomorrow
Well a little bit of lovin' is mabe all you need you know.

Do you see me when you look from the east?
cus I feel you when I look from the west
Constellations from the middle of the sea
will you be there, will you be there waiting for me?

Walk these days, heavy hearts, bones are failing me
Walk these days, fears of love
And [?] to be free

And a little bit of lovin' is maybe all you need you know
And a little bit of lovin' just to open up your heart and soul, soul, soul, soul
Maybe a little bit of yandi just to get you through to tomorrow
And a little bit of lovin' just to open up you heart and soul

Do you see me when you look from the east?
cus I feel you when I look from the west
Constellations from the middle of the sea
will you be there, will you be there waiting for me?
will you be there, will you be there waiting for me?
will you be there, will you be there waiting for me?
