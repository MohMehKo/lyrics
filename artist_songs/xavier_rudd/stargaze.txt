I feel it, with everything you do
I like this, I do yes I like you
This connection, we felt it, from day one
Lets lay out peaceful and stare into the stars

You came my way
When everything was tangled
Now I'm feeling clearer

With every moon
See the sun is shining
Your waves are easy
And I've got some good health
And I've got you

Free falling, free falling from the sky
I caught you, I did yes now I know why
