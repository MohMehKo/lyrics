Respect her she's the one
Our seasons change with each sun
The truth lies in our bones
Our choices now affect everyone

Like a river cuts through the mountains to the sun

The truth cannot be changed it has come

There are leaders who lead
Our leaders prefer to deceive
As our oceans they rise, they rise
Still now they choose to deny
