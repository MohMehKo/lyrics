Come my brother, come slowly, come easy, my friend, come my friend

Come my sister come easy, come breezy, on me, you can depend, 
Come my brother, put our hands up, take your heart out, let go, come let go

Come my sister can I hold you, can I squeeze you, let go, come let go

Come let go
Come let go
Come let go

Come the winter, come the summer, come autumn, come spring, do your thing
Come the river, come the mountain, come the ocean, come the trees, you will see, 
come the wind, come the rain, come the tide in, come the tide out again, 
come the wind, come the waves, come the tide in, come the tide out again, 
Out again,


Out again,

Come my brother, come slowly come easy, my friend, come my friend

Come my sister come easy, come breezy, on me, you can depend, 
Come my brother, put our hands up, take your heart out, let go, come let go
Come my sister can I hold you, can I squeeze you, let go, come let go

Come let go
Come let go
Come let go 

Come the winter, come the summer, come autumn, come spring,  do your thing
Come the river, come the mountain, come the ocean, what swell will you bring, 
come the wind, come the rain, come the tide in, come the tide out again, come the wind, 
come the waves, come the tide in, come the tide out again, out again, out again, out again
