Can you come to this garden, share with me this beautiful day
listen to the birds sing softly, lay with me and drift away
follow me to the ocean, share with me this beautiful day
listen to the waves break gently, lay with me and drift away

Then she moves through the trees with deadly grace and speed
sitting on the branches, and she strokes my emotions
she moves through the trees with deadly grace and speed
whispers through the roof I need to keep on moving on
I'm moving on, moving on, moving on
ya I'm moving on, moving on

Come with me to this garden, share with me this beautiful day
listen to the birds sing softly, lay with me and drift away
follow me to the ocean, share with me this beautiful day
listen to the waves break gently, lay with me and drift away

Then she moves through the trees with deadly grace and speed
sitting on the branches, and she strokes my emotions
she moves through the trees with deadly grace and speed
whispers through the roof I need to keep on moving on
I'm moving on, moving on, moving on
ya I'm moving on, moving on

Come with me to this garden, share with me this beautiful day
listen to the birds sing softly, lay with me and drift away
follow me to the ocean, share with me this beautiful day
listen to the waves break gently, lay with me and drift away

Then she moves through the trees with deadly grace and speed

she moves through the trees with deadly grace and speed
whispers through the roof I need to keep on moving on

She moves through the trees with deadly grace and speed
