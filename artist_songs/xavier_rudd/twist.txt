Everybody gonna paddle out together
Any kind of weather, 'cause everybody's OK
Everybody gonna kick back together
Speak about each other, 'cause everybody's OK
Some people gonna twist up together
Have to feel better, 'cause everybody's OK

From looking far and wide, I can see we're ok
When there's people all around just searching for some shade
Or a little bit of food just to see the next day
'Cause the fields are dried up and the money never came
Can you sing to your creator, give tobacco to a tree
Or some flowers to your mother 'cause she gave you what you need

Everybody can you lay back together
Stargaze together, cause everybody's OK

You know your children gonna help you feel better
If you're close to each other, 'cause everybody's ok

From looking far and wide, I can see we're ok
When there's people all around just searching for some shade
Or a little bit of food just to see the next day
'Cause the fields are dried up and the money never came
Can you sing to your creator, give tobacco to a tree
Or some flowers to your mother 'cause she gave you what you need

Everybody can you sway to the music
Let the spirit choose you, 'cause everybody's feeling OK
Said everybody can you sway to the music
Let the spirit choose you, 'cause everybody's feeling OK

Everybody can you sway to the music
Let the spirit choose you, 'cause everybody's feeling OK
Said everybody can you sway to the music
Let the spirit choose you, 'cause everybody's feeling OK
