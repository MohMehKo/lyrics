Can you feel us growing
Momma screaming for truth and justice

Don't look at me
Don't look at me look within
I'm weeding an endless garden of positivity and happiness
If I'm bringing my soul to ya
Bet ya money there's a reason I believe
Building with a rusty hammer
Standing strong in the things that I've seen
If I'm bringing my soul to ya
Coming at you with truth in my eyes
Building with a rusty hammer
Strong feeling everything gonna be just fine

Sang hyang widhi sending prayer from uluwatu
To be cleansed in the waters of sabutu
Nyepi demons are burning in ubud
Nyepi demons are burning in ubud
Sang hyang widhi sending prayer from uluwatu
Let it go in the waters of sabutu
Nyepi demons are burning in ubud
Nyepi demons are burning in ubud

If I'm bringing my soul to ya
Bet ya money there's a reason I believe
Building with a rusty hammer
Standing strong in the things that I've seen
And if I'm bringing my soul to ya
Coming at you with truth in my eyes
Building with a rusty hammer
Strong feeling everything gonna be just fine

Come along come along come along
Bring ya brother bring ya sister bring your uncle bring your mum
Come along come along come along
Put your hands together and pray to the sun

Can you feel us growing

If I'm bringing my soul to ya
Bet ya money there's a reason I believe
Building with a rusty hammer
Standing strong in the things that I've seen
If I'm bringing my soul to ya
Coming at you with truth in my eyes
Building with a rusty hammer
Strong feeling everything gonna be just fine
Come along come along come along
