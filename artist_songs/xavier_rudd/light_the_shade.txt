When you're feeling lonely
And you heart is hungry
I'll light the shade
When the moon escapes you
And the sun denies you
I'll light the shade

When the question's pending
You feel it all descending
I'll light the shade
Out answer searching
When it's all confusing
I'll light the shade

Out answer searching
When it's all confusing
I'll light the shade
When the moon escapes you
And the sun denies you
I'll light the shade
