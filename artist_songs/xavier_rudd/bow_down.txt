I sit here now 2010, government still stealing land
Making lame excuses for their greed
While that oil spills into the sea
And the whalers now still killing whales
And old growth bush still being raped
And I know we all have busy lives
But sing along if you have the time

Bow down to your god
But don't forget about the earth
Place your hand on a tree
Who's helping you breathe
Give thanks to the sun
When you open your lungs
Throw your buts in the bin
Help the old turtles swim

Selling tourism on sacred land
While the local mob sit on their hands
If what I'm speaking here makes any sense
Open up my friend and jump the fence

Bow down to your god
But don't forget about the earth
Place your hand on a tree
Who's helping you breathe
Give thanks to the sun
When you open your lungs
Throw your buts in the bin
Help the old turtles swim

Freedom for all [repeat]
