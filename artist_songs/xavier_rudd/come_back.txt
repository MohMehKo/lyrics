I know my answers often left you
Feeling like you were hanging out to dry
I know my reasons
Have left you wondering why
And I've had these questions
Looming over me
Since the day you took flight
But if you come back
There will be good times

I see your face
When I'm staring out the window
Beaming down in the moonlight
The winter is colder
Without you by my side
All I have is this photo
Of your smile to remind
Of my wrongs and my rights
But if you come back
There will be good times
