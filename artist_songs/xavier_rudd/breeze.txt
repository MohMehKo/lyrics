You will breeze in, fresh air that you are,
They will inhale you deep into their lungs.
They will exhale you as far as you may go
and you will touch their souls.

Imagine yourself floating away,
imagine the tiniest little pixi people
Rub the ocean in your face
Imagine your feet had never touched the eart
Imagine you are flying above the whole human race
just gliding above it all.

You will breeze in, fresh air that you are,
They will inhale you deep into their lungs.
They will exhale you as far as you may go
and you will touch their souls.

Imagine you were dreaming in a bed
of fresh green leaves
and you awoke to a shining sun
the good people of the world all free.

You will breeze in, fresh air that you are,
They will inhale you deep into their lungs.
They will exhale you as far as you may go
and you will touch their souls.

Now you're leaving home 
ya got ya business to do
hollow as an old log and I'm thinking of you
so many times and years
well they seem so much less
we were truly blessed!

You will breeze in, fresh air that you are,
They will inhale you deep into their lungs.
They will exhale you as far as you may go
and you will touch their souls.
