I know, I see, I feel and yes I fear it everyday 
These ego's there minds and games 
With all their power could end our days 
Still the sun it shines and the moon it sinks with grace 
It's such a shame that all this shit exists 
Here on this earth, this magical place 

I'm doing fine 

Yes you have the funds and size and power to make some change 
What you have will break their smiles 
so many people so many ways 
each Child who walks their line 
should be free to run their race 
it's such a shame that all this shit exists here on this earth, this magical place 

I'm doing fine
