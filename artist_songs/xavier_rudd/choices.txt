Lay me down to rest awhile
I'm feeling cold, cold to the bones
Lay me down so I can fly, fly, fly
Dragon fly buzzing by
These flowers and this sunshine
Warming me up to the bones
Lifting me up so I can fly

She say's there's nothing to be said
Nothing to be gained
From the winds that blow today
All you have is time
Walking down this line,
All twisted from preservatives of life
But you have what you have
What you have is for you
And the future of your child
Look there's a full moon
And I'm looking at you

Choices you've been warm
And you've been cold

And I'm not scared no, no
Well, maybe just a little scared to die
