When she came and when she went
it was a great surprise.
Like the stars on the clearest night
she could shine so bright.
Like the signs of a coming tornado
she would pose great threat.
When she came I was not ready,
was not ready when she left.

There are things I would like to remember.
Things I prefer to forget.
I will make my little list
and hope my mind it will accept.
I will would rather place my focus
on the reasons we were blessed.
When she came I was not ready,
was not ready when she left.

When she came and when she went
it was a great surprise.
Like the stars on the clearest night
she could shine so bright.
Like the signs of a coming tornado
she would pose great threat.
When she came I was not ready,
was not ready when she left.

When she came I was not ready,
was not ready when she left.

When she came I was not ready,
was not ready when she left.
