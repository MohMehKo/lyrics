Everybody take the hands of the ones you choose
And everybody leave to a place that appeals to you
Hold it up closer to your heart, show the spirit you're close
And everybody join up as one, and together we'll grow

Here we go to the edge of the moon
We are blinded for now by the goodness of groove
We are dancing and we're singing with the light of the moon
We are blinded for now by the goodness of groove
If you come in here with love or bouncing your feet
Then here and now would be a good place to meet
Someone from a place that appeals to you
And together we can share all the goodness of groove

Everybody take the hands of the ones you choose
And everybody lead them to a place that appeals to you
Hold them up closer to your heart, show the spirit you're close
And everybody join up as one, and together we'll grow, Everybody

Here we go to the edge of the moon
We are blinded for now by the goodness of groove
We are dancing and we're singing with the light of the moon
We are blinded for now by the goodness of groove
If you come in here with love or bouncing your feet
Then here and now would be a good place to meet
Someone from a place that appeals to you
And together we can share all the goodness of groove

Here we have what we have
Good spirit to cleanse our good selves
No care for troubles or hells
No place for status or wealth
Here we have what we need
Cleanse our soul, keep us free
So take the hands of a friend
And together we can sing

Everybody take the hands of the ones you choose
And everybody lead them to a place that appeals to you
Hold them up closer to your heart, show the spirit you're close
And everybody join up as one, and together we'll grow, Everybody

Here we go to the edge of the moon
Here we go to the edge of the moon
We are blinded for now by the goodness of groove
We are dancing and we're singing with the light of the moon
We are blinded for now by the goodness of groove
If you come in here with love or bouncing your feet
Then here and now would be a good place to meet
Someone from a place that appeals to you
And together we can share all the goodness of groove
