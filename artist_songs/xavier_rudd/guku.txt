Well I'll hold you up again
And I'll hold you up again
Hold you up again
I'll hold you up again

I'll hold you up again
And I'll hold you up again
You fought and you won
Now my brother, you're gone
You fought and you won
Now my brother, you're gone

Well you fought and you won
Now my brother, you're gone
Well you fought and you won
Now my brother, you're gone

I'll hold you up again
Yeah, I'll hold you up again
You were your country
Deadliest, I've seen

I feel it many times
When I shut these eyes
And I feel you many times
When I shut these eyes
Well I'll hold you up again
I'll hold you up again
