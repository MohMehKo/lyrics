So now come sit down
Will you talk with me now
Let me see through your eyes
Where there is so much light
We are biding our time
For these myths to unwind
All these changes we will confront

So please beware
With every place that you head
Look to your soul
For these things that you know
For the trees that we see
Cannot forever breathe
With the changes they will confront

You know some people they just won't understand
No they just won't understand
These things
Thank you for your message but I don't understand
No I just won't understand
These things

And this sacred land
It has seen many hands
It has wealth and gold
Yet it is fragile and old
And all the greedy souls
Just don't care to know
All the changes it will confront

So speak out loud
Of the things you are proud
And if you love this coast
Then keep it clean as it hopes
'Cause the way that it shines
May just dwindle with time
With the changes it will confront

You know some people they just won't understand
No they just won't understand
These things
Thank you for your message but I don't understand
No I just won't understand
These things
You know some people they just won't understand
No they just won't understand
These things
Thank you for your message but I don't understand
No I just won't understand
These things

So hold nice and close
I want to get to your soul
So that when it is cold
You won't feel so alone
'Cause the roads that you take
May just crack and break
With the changes you will confront

With each gift that you share
You may heal and repair
With each choice you make
You may help someone's day
Well I know you are strong
May your journey be long
And now I wish you the best of luck
Well I know you are strong
May your journey be long
And now I wish you the best of luck

You know some people they just won't understand
No they just won't understand
These things
Thank you for your message but I don't understand
No I just won't understand
These things
