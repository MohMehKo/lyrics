Feel it inside my heart and I see you'll be next to me
Taking it in my stride to be wise, turning water into wine
Smoking each day away with my mind, Champion Ruby and fire
Feel it inside my heart and I see you'll be next to me

Remember that I am only a man with a heart that's paper thin
I can whisper in your ear and take your hand, walk with you through thick and thin
Sensitive and open is my way and I'm afraid of what this brings
So please don't lead me down that road again, I need to keep things clean

Feel it inside my heart and I see you'll be next to me
Taking it in my stride to be wise, as my tears fall in my wine
Smoking each day away with my mind, Champion Ruby and fire
Feel it inside my heart and I see you'll be next to me

Remember that I am only a man with a heart that's paper thin
I can whisper in your ear and take your hand, walk with you through thick and thin
Sensitive and open is my way and I'm afraid of what this brings
And please don't lead me down that road again, I need to keep things clean

So much time we spend searching for a clue
Waiting for the paint to dry and trying to be the glue
Drifting down this river of life in a paper thin canoe
Free falling into you
Drifting sown this river of life in a paper thin canoe
Free falling into you
Free falling into you

Feel it inside my heart
