Come people, come now people [x4]

Round and round we go again spirit quest for enlightenment
The rise and fall of things revealed of sacredness and woundedness to heal
Time to time she chimes in phrases from the internet
Of planetary alignment and the energetic push and pull we share

Who will hide and who will seek?
The suffering beneath your feet has been neglected through the ages

And I held that little girl she was a message in my dreaming
I bring my hands and I must stay and I will graciously set you free

Come people, come now people [x3]
Come fire clean these people
Come people, come now people

Feel the touch of a gentle rain and we pull together when the Earth she breaks
So why are we so divided?
Grandmother pull us out
Grandmother can you tell me how we have been so mistaken?

And I held that little girl she was a message in my dreaming
I bring my hands and I must stay and I will graciously set you free

Come people, come now people [x3]
Come Spirit through these people
Come people, come now people
And I believe we are one and we are sacred [x3]
I will hold you close [x2]
