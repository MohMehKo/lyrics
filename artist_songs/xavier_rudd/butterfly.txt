Butterfly and a pretty mermaid
To mark the end of these Koonyum days
Gentle rain and a brown snake skin
When something ends, something new begins

I need this time now to follow the moon
The gentle rain won't be ending soon
Walk with patience to the rainbow's end
If the spirit sees it, she'll be waiting there
