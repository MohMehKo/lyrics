Hey

He-hey [x10]

Hey

There's the wind that through the souls of my feet into my lungs go
Meditation of an ancient kind exhaling through my third eye
Stand strong in what I know, stand aside from the ego
As they day turns into night through the breeze I hear you cry,
"I believe in you. I believe in you. I will pray for you. I will pray for you."
(Believe)
I believe in you.
I will pray for you.

[chanting in other language]

I believe in you (I believe in you)
I believe in you (I believe in you)
I will pray for you (I will pray for you)

Your rivers flow with ease
Down the serpent's line once streamed
In these hands I hold your light
Through these hands Nanna I'll guide
I'll guide
You fuel me from the ground
Pulled me up when I was down
I believe in you
I believe in you
Stand strong keep the fire burning
I'll Stick together, gotta keep the wheels turning
For some companies to stand aside
For some government to recognize the power of this dragon
Stand strong keep the fire burning
Stick together, gotta keep the wheels turning
For some companies to stand aside
For some government to recognize the power of this dragon
I Stand strong to keep the fire burning
I'll Stick together, gotta keep the wheels turning
For some companies to stand aside
For some government to recognize the power of this dragon
I stand strong keep the fire burning
I'll Stick together, gotta keep the wheels turning
For some companies to stand aside
For some government to recognize the power of this dragon
I stand strong keep the fire burning
I'll Stick together, gotta keep the wheels turning
For some companies to stand aside
For some government to recognize the power of this dragon
My god as I go in my darkest days
Oh your spirit held me tight
Through the ratchet days and nights
I believe in you
And mother I will pray, pray for you
