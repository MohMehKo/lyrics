I've seen babies begging, scratching round for food to eat
I've seen a big old tree still standing tall, two thousand years healthy
I've seen the oldest woman shaking her head at what went wrong
I drank water from a stream so fresh you couldn't see the water at all.
At all.

I've seen streets so dirty, there is hardly a place to walk and
I've fallen asleep to our bush birds, singing the prettiest song
I've seen all of the pain and all the murder on tv and
I've stood free on solid waves, mother earth's greatest treats

Oh peace on earth that I know
Sending us out to war my friend
This place my home from sky to ground
See the universe connected from the inside

I've seen people screaming at the car that cut them off
And I've felt the cleanest mountain air cleaning out my nose
I've seen fast food chains nearly every place that I go
I've had a belly full of the freshest fish speared with a single throw

And I sing
Oh peace on earth that I know
Sending us out to war my friend
This place my home from sky to ground
See the universe connected from the inside

There's been changes in weather like never before
Changing the winter and summer and spring
Many many people still listening to the earth and her song
So is sing it strong

Oh peace on earth that I know
Sending us out to war my friend
This place my home from sky to ground
See the universe connected from the inside

In theses times of trouble in these times of war
In theses times when our planet is it getting to warm
It makes me simple to take a look around
Of this earth and this earth we can be so proud
