I will be there for you if it all crumbles down
And I will be there for you when your feet touch the ground
I'll clear the earth for you if you need the stars to dream
And I'll make a flame for you to keep your spirit clean

My angel, my mystery angel
My angel, my mystery angel

You were there for me when I couldn't find myself
Opened a door for me when there seemed no way out
And you were there with me when I was too young to see
Bringing music through with your wisdom and peace

My angel, my mystery angel
My angel, my mystery angel
My angel, my mystery angel
My angel, my mystery angel

Looking back now I don't think I'll ever understand
Universe offers balance on many different hands
Take some time just to sit with each one just to see
Patiently the right one will hold on 'til you're free
Hold on 'til you're free

My angel, my mystery angel
My angel, my mystery angel
My angel, my mystery angel
My angel, my mystery angel
My angel, my mystery angel
My angel, my mystery angel
