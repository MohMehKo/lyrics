Imagine every whale was free to roam
Imagine if the trees could tell us where to go
Imagine that the sun could fill each lonely heart
Imagine confrontation never got a start

Imagine things were always crystal clear
Imagine if the mind never interfered
Imagine we could fly with broken wings
Imagine if the heart could shed its skin

Please patience please, patience please
I'm creating a dream
Please patience please, patience please
I'm creating a dream

Imagine sacred sites were left to be
Imagine if true activists controlled TV
Imagine Captain Watson had the final say
Imagine if industry just had to obey

Please patience please, patience please
I'm creating a dream
Please patience please, patience please
I'm creating a dream
Please patience please, patience please
I'm creating a dream
