While I'm gone, please don't change a thing, don't change a thing at all
While I'm gone, please don't change a thing, you know you're beautiful

And I'm walking in the sunshine with my head held high
Got my family together, got this big blue sky
And I'll go one direction with my radio on
Recieving what I need to know, degesting wisdom
I can fly like an eagle from the ridges above
Decending on the people with the power of my love
Cause I believe in truth and I believe in love 
I believe we are protected from the spirits above

While I'm gone, please don't change a thing, don't change a thing at all
While I'm gone, please don't change a thing, you know you're beautiful

And I see a sister walking with her radio on
She got flowers in her hair and she's singing this song
I don't know sometimes we're coming and sometimes we're going
Sometimes we're in the middle of the great unknown
Either way respect for momma and her seven cubs
And the staunch preparation for the things to come
I will go one direction with my radio on
I'll keep it nice and simple, sending lots of love

While I'm gone, please don't change a thing, don't change a thing at all
While I'm gone, please don't change a thing, you know you're beautiful

Sending love to Barcelona And I'll be sending love to California
And I'll be sending love to Argentina
(my island, my home)
And I'll be big love Aotearoa and I'll be sending love to Papua, New Guinea
Sending love to Izintaba
(my island, my home)
Madiba, big love Samoa and I'll be sending love to Yirrkala
My island, my home
