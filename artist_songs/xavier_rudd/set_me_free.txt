This place called reno, things unforseen
Built on hopeless foundations of lies and deceit
We stand in this river completely unknown
The sacred Lake Tahoe has truth in it's flow
Ancestors work slowly with things we must see

And I feel it has come, my time for release
Will you set me free
I feel it has come, my time for release
Will you set me free
I know what I know, and I see what I see
Will you set me free
I feel it has come, my time for release
Will you set me free
Let me fly

And I sink down below, the surface is rage
Holding on to a boulder, surrender with grace
And I think of my first-born, these times and his place
And his beauty and wisdom and all gentle ways
Watches over his brother, like the lion he is

And he knows what he knows, and he sees what he sees
Would you set me free
The feel it has come, my time for release
Will you set me free
And I know what I know, and I see what I see
Would you set me free
And I feel it has come, my time for release
Will you set me free
Let me fly

Young lazy French kid who ruined our world
With the ways of his father passed through his bones
Was it once was it twice was it nothing at all
It was inside my temple it was inside my home
And I look in this mirror with patience and grief

And I know what I know, and I see what I see
Would you set me free
And I feel it has come, my time for release
Will you set me free
And I know what I know, and I see what I see
Would you set me free
Let me fly
My feel it has come, my time for release
Will you set me free
Let me fly

Gave my heart to you
Gave me soul to you
Gave it all to you
On my knees
Gave my heart to you
Gave me soul to you
Gave it all to you
On my knees

Rising up (set me free), falling down
Rising up, falling down
Rising up (set me free), falling down (let me fly)
I feel it has come, my time for release
Will you set me free
