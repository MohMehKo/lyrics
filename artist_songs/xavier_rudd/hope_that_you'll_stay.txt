Sun floating up, Slipping back down
Conjunction with the moon, and light from the ground
The fire it burns, rain it cools
I hope that you'll stay
I hope that you'll stay

Post to post, all of these years
Reflections on your face, the taste of your tears
Centuries gone, for the spirits you face
I hope that you'll stay
I hope that you'll stay

Children grow up, elders grow down
Watch them fly high, and crash to the ground
and help them move one, welcome them home
and hope that they'll stay
hope that they'll stay
I hope that you'll stay
I hope that you'll stay
You see I hope that you'll stay
I hope that you'll stay
You see I hope that you'll stay
I hope that you'll stay
