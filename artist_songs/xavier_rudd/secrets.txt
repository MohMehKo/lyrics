All the people seeking truth and worldwide
Coming up slowly
And many more seem to be opening their eyes
Coming up slowly
Centuries of twisted truth and lies
Coming up slowly
Many people many places sick and tired
Coming up slowly

And I don't believe you, this time
You see I've opened, my eyes

You're keeping secrets, each day
You're keeping secrets
Keep you satisfied, satisfied

Many people on a mission to unite

Many people spreading message far and wide
Coming up slowly
Every message has a universal tie
Coming up slowly
Every message for the fate of the unborn child
Coming up slowly
