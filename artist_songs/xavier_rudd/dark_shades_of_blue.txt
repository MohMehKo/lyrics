So here we go
Here it comes again
The present time time, it's so mysterious
I'm facing south
From the northern hemisphere
The southern cross
For now has disappeared

I place it inside my brain
And shield it with everything
I see it come into you
You paint dark shades of blue

Here I go
Just me and my old mind
At times removed
Upcoming up inside
What present sends
Is so mysterious
It's mine to fight
Come spirit come defend

I place it inside my brain
And shield it with everything
I see it come into you
You paint dark shades of blue
