Hold it up
Fill your cup
Look out to sea
Feel what I see

Hold it up
Fill your cup
Look out to sea
Respect what I see

And I reason with you now,
Trying to find my way out
As she's singing all these songs
Oh, she's singing to heal my soul.
Find my place, find my reason
Oh, I been here so long
Oh, she's singing with the trees
Oh, she's singing to heal me
