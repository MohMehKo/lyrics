Sun is up, beautiful day
I can see myself
I can see myself
Light me up, lioness eye
I can see you now
I can see you now

Sun is up, beautiful day
I can see myself
I can see myself
Light me up, lioness eye
I can see you now
I can see you now

Sitting with this fire
Wisdom in his eye
With the strength of a lion
Wisdom in his eye
