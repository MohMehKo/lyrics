Tiny bones and skin, sand on your feet
These healthy children, the fruits of your tree
Turquoise flotation, the Indian sea
We can float together you and me

Yeah we love you it's a beautiful day
Thankyou for the journey to this new decade
We've been gifted this island we've been gifted this day
And we're all here together on this beautiful day

Finojet is taking steps 1,2,3
And the other one keeps on amazing us by what he can see
To you through broken shells a white moth comes,
She gives herself to him, because he keeps you strong	

Yeah we love you it's a beautiful day
Thankyou for the journey to this new decade
We've been gifted this island we've been gifted this day
And we're all here together on this beautiful day
