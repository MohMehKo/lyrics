Hold you out
This is how they do it
Scream and shout, often times unnoticed
The rise and fall of powerful receivers
Them bringing down this world as we know it

I feel it in my heart
Cause I'm inside it
I was given 2 eyes and I see

Season change is happening all over
The rearranging of governments much slower
Elders speak straight from the creator
For centuries now
Their message is not deemed of worth?

I feel it in my heart
Cause I'm inside it
I was given 2 eyes and I see

Hold you out
This is how they do it
Scream and shout, often times unnoticed
The rise and fall of powerful receivers
Them bringing down this world as we know it
