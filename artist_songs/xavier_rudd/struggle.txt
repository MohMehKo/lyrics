I had enough struggle now
I had enough worries
I had enough emptiness
I had enough of feeling lonely

Now baby bring me your sunshine
And bring me love into some guidance
And I can hold you in the moonlight
And work together to be conscious, conscious
Call it love. Call it love.

Say, 1, 2, 3, 4, positively close the door
5, 6, 7, 8, spread your light, Radiate!
1, 2, 3, 4, do your thing for the Earth.
5, 6, 7, 8, spread your light, Radiate!
Now move it, slowly, positive, diligent
What other people think of you is none of your business
Sometimes we will go against seeking reasons why
Sometimes we stray far from ourselves before we realize

I had enough struggle now
I had enough worries
I had enough of emptiness
I had enough of feeling lonely

And baby bring me your sunshine
And bring me love into some guidance
And I can hold you in the moonlight
And work together to be conscious, conscious
Call it love. Call it love.

Say, 1, 2, 3, 4, positively close the door
5, 6, 7, 8, spread your light, Radiate!
1, 2, 3, 4, do your thing for the Earth.

Now move it, slowly, positive, diligent
