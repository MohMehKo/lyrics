Turn Around and look to the window
Turn around and look outside
Out there in the jungle
There is truth among the lies

I have been to cold dark places
I have had a broken soul
But the cold of the cold dark places
Help the bright ones feel so warm

If you hold her up be sure to help her down
If you burn it up you'll take the ashes to the ground
If you grow it up keep its roots deep, deep down
If you set it up be sure to set it down

Seeing life through those glasses
Seeing life through that haze
Thoughts that I felt to be pure
Would send you shades of grey
I have been to cold dark places

I have had an evil mind
The cold of the cold dark places
Seem to help the sun to shine

If you hold her up be sure to help her down
If you burn it up you'll take the ashes to the ground
If you grow it up keep its roots deep, deep down
If you set it up be sure to set it down

Searching, searching for close
Closeness to the people that I love the most
I feel you, in everything I do
Everything I do comes back to you
There are spirits of evil and grace
Intrusion of mind intrusion of space
I'm sorry because everything I do
Everything I do comes back to you
I feel you in everything I do
Because everything I do comes back to you
I feel you in everything I do
Because everything I do comes back to you
