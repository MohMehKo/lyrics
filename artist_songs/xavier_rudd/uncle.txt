He seen change she's seen changed day today
Change and rose far beyond of what we know
Come and rise in our fears across the sea
Through the dreamtime
There's so much she has seen

This was a constant to bridge and sea (unsure of this line)
Two long years behind bars at sixteen
Now and then we cannot see the old shrine
Cross the sea not a place not a time

He can see through he can see through and behind
Through beyond what you know in your mind
Oooh for now, what will be what will be
Is around there will be change there will be change
