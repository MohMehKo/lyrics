This world, up in flames
Reasons unexplained
People grounding down
Trying to escape
Up in flames

Wounded, self inflamed
Reasons unexplained
This world, spinning round
Rotting with decay
Up in flames

When will you release them from this
When will you realize your shame
Up in flames

Look into this fire burning
All that you will see here is pain
Up in flames

I've been feeling, my purple flame
Comfort with my people and my place
Mountains take us higher
Water dim the fire
Oceans swim away
Children bring us change
