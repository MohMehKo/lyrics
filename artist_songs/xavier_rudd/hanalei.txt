Come on mumma give me what you got, hanalei hanalei
Come on mumma give me what you got, hanalei hanalei
Butterfly the catcher and the dove, hanalei hanalei
Come on mumma give me what you got, hanalei hanalei

Your waters descending, from your mountains ascending
To my arteries for cleansing, from the arteries of life
Your mountain says aloha, to the roots of the Lapuna
And the old man Ayahuasca on the quest for where and why

Come on mumma give me what you got, hanalei hanalei
Come on mumma give me what you got, hanalei hanalei
Butterfly the catcher and the dove, hanalei hanalei
Come on mumma give me what you got, hanalei hanalei

You're spraying your chemicals to increase your decimal
To continue domination, keep holding people down

Come on mumma give me what you got, hanalei hanalei
Come on mumma give me what you got, hanalei hanalei
Butterfly the catcher and the dove, hanalei hanalei
Come on mumma give me what you got, hanalei hanalei

I'm only a man in my prime though my hands are tied
If you show me the way I will go
See we've all been designed to reveal our own knots we have tied
We've all been designed to believe and I believe
I will go

The trick about recognition, the trick about reconciliation
Can one man fight his demons with another man holding him down
The trick about recognition, the trick about reconciliation
Can woman birth creation with a sister holding her down

Come on mumma give me what you got, hanalei hanalei
Come on mumma give me what you got, hanalei hanalei
Butterfly the catcher and the dove, hanalei hanalei
Come on mumma give me what you got
