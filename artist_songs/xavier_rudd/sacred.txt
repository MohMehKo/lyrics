And I believe we are one, we are sacred
And I believe we are one, we are sacred
And I believe we are one, we are sacred

I will hold you close
I will hold you close

We pray to creator for the path we seek
Extend a hand to the tired and the weak
Why are we so divided?

We pray to creator for the path we seek
Extend a hand to the tired and the weak
So why are we so divided?

Grandmother pull us out
Grandmother can you tell me how
We have been so mistaken?

And I believe we are one, we are sacred
And I believe we are one, we are sacred
Yes I believe we are one, we are sacred

And I will hold you close
And I will hold you close
