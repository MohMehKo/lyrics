Comfortable in my skin, it's all for one and one for all this year
Tell me cause I wonder will you take my hand
Walk with me to the promise land
We can all sing one song
No suffering at all

See I'm comfortable in my skin, I wonder now will she let me in
Been rolling with the sound of the silent hawk
Pinch my nerve as I stumble forth
Can we all sing one song?
No suffering at all

Do you feel like any of this is wrong
Do you feel like any of this is wrong
Do any of you feel like any of this is wrong
Cause I feel like some of this is wrong

Well I'm comfortable in my skin, I wonder now will she let me in
Been rolling with the sound of the silent hawk
Pinch my nerve as I stumble forth
Can we all sing one song?
No suffering at all

Can we all sing one song?
No suffering at all
No suffering at all
