Setting sun to close the new day
Bring your moon, bring your moon

And if you rise I'll hold the ladder
To help you rise, help you rise

And if you fall, I'll lay myself
To soften the blow, soften the blow

I will hold you once again, I will hold you once again

The winds they blow south-east now
Cool things down cool things down

And if you rise I will hold the ladder
To help you rise, help you rise

The candle burns to the right now
And the wax it melts slowly down

And if you rise I will hold the ladder
To help you rise, help you rise

And if you fall, I will lay myself
To soften the blow, soften the blow

I will hold you once again, I will hold you once again [x2]

There be my shelter in your arms
Away
