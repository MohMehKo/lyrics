Lately I saved myself
Lately I saved myself
Lately I saved myself
I was wrong but I saved myself

You held out your hand
When it was all that I had
All these places I've been
That you couldn't share with me
And your tears had their place
On those cold lonely days
I was wrong but I need you now

Through those rapid winds of change
You were solid as the base
