He was a warrior in every way
And he was always listening
A dedication to peoples displaced
And he was always listening
If a little birdy flew into his space
He was always listening
And with the spirit of the ancient ways
He was always receiving

He said come with me people
Stand up with me people
As one and as equals
Let's honour all people
Come with me people
Stand up with me people
As one and as equals
Let's honour all people
All people
Honour all people
Honour all people
Honour all people

She was a goddess in every way
And she was always listening
Dedication to people displaced
And she was always listening
And if a lion moved through her space
She was always listening
And with the spirit of the ancient ways
She was always receiving

She said come with me people
Stand up with me people
As one and as equals
Let's honour all people
Come with me people
Stand up with me people
As one and as equals
Let's honour all people
Come with me people
Stand up with me people
As one and as equals
Let's honour all people
Come with me people
Stand up with me people
As one and as equals
Let's honour all people
All people
Said honour all people
Said honour all people
Said honour all people

And she could take him by the hand
And together they could change the world
And abolish greed from every man
And spread their medicine throughout the world
And every sun would rise and fall
And restore complete balance on the earth
A brand new change for one and all
Do you feel what I'm sayin?
Do you feel what I'm sayin?
