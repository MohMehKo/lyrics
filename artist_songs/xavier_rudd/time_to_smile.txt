Well I'm packing things in my bag today,
Heading south to my country again.
Summer is coming, it's time to smile.

See worry and change it has spun me around,
My big old heart has been ripped right out.
Summer is coming, it's time to smile.

Woah, its time to smile.

Step out of the whirlpool of lies and deceit,
Heading for still waters and pure honesty.
Summer is coming, it's time to smile.

Woah, it's time to smile.
Woah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 
yeah yeah yeah oooo yeah yeah ooooo 
Woah, it's time to smile.

There's been more rain this year and the country is going strong
And with my feet in the dust I know now I was meant to return
Woah, my young hearts are two thousand miles away,
Must focus my strength,
told them this way.
Summer is coming, it's time to smile.

Time to smile, time to smile, time to smile, time to smile.

See I'm packing things in my bag today,
And I'm, heading south to my country again.
Summer is coming, it's time to smile.

See now worry and change it has spun me around,
My big old heart has been ripped right out.
Summer is coming, it's time to smile.

Said Woah, it's time to smile
Woah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah ooooo yeah yeah ooooo woah it's time to smile.
