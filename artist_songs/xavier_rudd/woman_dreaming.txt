She is everything you need
but she needs to be free
As a color of the earth
baked in the sun ancient and loyal

And you step back cause you don't understand her path and her sense woming dreaming is very profound

she was everything to you but she had work to do and you have work to do

woo yoo yo yoo
ya yoo yoo
yoh yooo yaa yaa

she is everything you need
but she want to be free, she needs to be free

rainbows sometimes appear at a time very clear

As the man of many moons before you must now walk alone you must now walk alone
You must look to the path you mush come take a spear and a flash of wisdom and knowledge

don't step back cause you don't understand her path a her sense women dreaming is very profound

she was everything to you but she had work to do and you have work to do

she was everything you need but she needs to be free and you need to be free
