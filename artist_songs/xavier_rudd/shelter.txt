Well, here I am this is my shelter 
Here I'm at one with these trees 
And all these birds sing to my rhythms 
And these waves they comfort me 

Do what you will while your able 
Find what it is that you seek 
Only I'll fly, fly, fly above the ocean 
I will fly so high above the sea 

If it's shelter you're searching for 
The one that I cannot provide, 
Well, I wish you well on your journey 
I hope your dreams they come alive 
I hope your dreams back down and they, 
Well they thrive 

Do, do, do 
Do, do, do 
Do, do, do 

Well, I filled my cup with your answers 
I filled my cup with your lies 
You topped it up with your mysteries 
And all those secrets I denied 

Do what you will while your able 
Find what it is that you seek 
Only I'll fly, fly, fly above the ocean 
I will fly so high above the sea 

If it's shelter you're searching for 
The one that I cannot provide, 
Well, I wish you well on your journey 
I hope your dreams they come alive 
I hope your dreams back down and they, 
Well they thrive 

I hope your dreams they come alive 
I hope your dreams back down and thrive 

Do, do, do 
Do, do, do 
Do, do, do
