Well, you hear about all these women raising about their funky, funky, funky men
They've got some trifling husbands. Lord knows, they've got a lot of no good friends
All these fretting women sitting around the house all day long, and they are wondering when their loving papas are ever coming home
Wild women never worry. Wiiiiiiild women never never worry
I got a sweet disposition. Gonna wear my very own. I ain't never gonna spend one lonely night at home all alone
I can go out and drink all the courvoisier I can find.
Walk the streets and I can tell any man to go to hell if that man doesn't know how to act right
Wild women we don't every worry. Wiiiiiiild women never never get the blues.
Well, you fellas ain't ever gonna get nothing if you keep acting like an angel, child
Give it up tonight's a real real good night. Y'all gotta learn how to get to together well
Cuz I'll tell one more thing (Francine never tells a lie)
Wild women will be the first ones, Lord to learn how to fly
Wild women never worry. Wiiiiild women don't get the blues
