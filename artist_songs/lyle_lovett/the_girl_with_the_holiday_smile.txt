I met a hooker at the grocery store
She wasn't bad lookin', she was a pretty little whore
Whoa-o-whoa, she's the girl with the holiday smile

She told me: "Merry Christmas and peace to you"
She said "I've been workin' this whole night through."
She said "Whoa-o-whoa, I'm the girl with the holiday smile"

She told me "Whoa my whoa me, I look so good beneath a Christmas tree"
She said "Whoa-o-whoa, I'm the girl with the holiday smile"

She told me "Christmas brings out the best in me"
She said "My heart's so full of love and generosity"
"Whoa-o-whoa, I'm the girl with the holiday smile"

And "Well the police here and the police there
"They ruin my Christmas spirit everywhere I go."
"Whoa-o-whoa, I'm the girl with the holiday smile"

She told me "Whoa my whoa me, I look so good beneath a Christmas tree"
She said "Whoa-o-whoa, I'm the girl with the holiday smile"

Well she told me "goodbye" as she walked away
She said "Son, if you're good maybe on Christmas day"
Whoa-o-whoa...

I said "Whoa my whoa me, she looks so good beneath my Christmas tree"
Whoa-o-whoa, she's the girl with the holiday...

I met a hooker at the grocery store
She wasn't bad lookin', she was a pretty little whore
Whoa-o-whoa, she's the girl with the holiday..
Well lord lord, she's the girl with the holiday...
Whoa-o-whoa, she's the girl with the holiday..

Silent night shining so bright
She ain't holy but she can hold me tight

Whoa-o-whoa, she's the girl with the holiday...
