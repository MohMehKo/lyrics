The summer wind, came blowin' in from across the sea
It lingered there, to touch your hair and walk with me
All summer long, we sang a song and we strolled on golden sand
Two sweethearts, and the summer wind

Like painted kites, those days and nights they went flyin' by
The world was new, beneath a blue umbrella sky
Then softer than a piper man one day it called to you
I lost you, I lost you to the summer wind

The autumn wind, and the winter wind they have come and gone
Still the days, those lonely days that go on and on
Guess who sighs his lullabies through nights that never end
My fickle friend, summer wind, summer wind
Oh, summer wind, summer wind
