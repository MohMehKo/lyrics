Empty blue shoes
And empty brown bottles
It's the VW blues
Bare feet to the floor

You just might die
When you make colorado
And the plaines lie behind you
Sweet Texas behind you

And your mother won't hold
You forever
And forever won't hold you for long
And that girl with the face of
An angel
She's the girl with the face that's
Long gone

Now those empty blue shoes
They sit by the highway
And those VW blues
They saw 'em pulling away

You know she kissed me goodbye
The last time I saw her
But what she intended
She never would say

And you lover won't hold you
Forever
And forever won't hold you for long
And that girl with the face of
An angel
She's the girl with the face that's
Long gone
