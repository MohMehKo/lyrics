Was it the champagne
Was it the caviar
Was it her airplane
Was it her daddy's car
Was it the new thing
With all the dough
Why I don't know
I just had to go

Was that the yacht club
Or just a fishing boat
Was that the leg of lamb
Or was it a billy goat
Was that a snail baby
Or escargot
Why I don't know
I just had to go

I'm just a poor boy
I like to have fun
I know a pretty girl when I see one
I've seen the real thing
The imitation too
So don't go telling me what to do

Was that a beer joint
Or was that the country club
Were we fooling around
Or was it truly love
Was that a foreign film
Or just a show
Why I don't know
I just had to go

I'm just a poor boy
I like to have fun
I know a pretty girl when I seen one
I've seen the real thing
The imitation too
So don't go telling me what to do

So keep your champagne
And keep your caviar
And fly your airplane
Into your daddy's car
And so you'll understand
I'll tell you slow
Why I don't know
I just had to...go
