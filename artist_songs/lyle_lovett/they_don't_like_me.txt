They don't like me
I can feel it
And I don't like them
It's the same old song
They don't like me
I just know it
But I'd be happy
Just to get along

They try to love me
I know they do
'Cause when I tell them I love you
They say we love you too

But I know
They don't like me
I can feel it
And I don't like them
It's the same old song
They don't like me
I just know it
But I'd be happy
Just to get along

She told me
You can call me mother
He said son just call me dad
We'll treat you like the only boy
We wish we never had

But I know
They don't like me
I can feel it
And I don't like them
It's the same old song
They don't like me
I just know it
But I'd be happy
Just to get along

She said you know he doesn't drink much
And we've never heard him curse
And he's really not that ugly dear
She could've done much worse

But I know
They don't like me
And I don't like them
It's the same old song
They don't like me
I can feel it
But I'd be happy
Just to get along
I'd be happy just to get along
I'd be happy just to get along
