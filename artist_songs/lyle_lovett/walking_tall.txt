I have a dream that everywhere I go
Almost everyone captures my eyes
And they find me so fascinating
Had end in kidding quite looking interesting
A very special guy
I'm walking tall, flying high
In the cold light of day
It's not so easy, I've got to say
Oh I'm so lonely
I'm feeling relatively blue
Oh how I'd love a next to kin or two

There has to a place for me
Where I belong right now
I don't need a dynasty, a name to share, a heart to care
That's really old, then I'll be walking tall

I wonder who arranges all our lives through thoughts of sound
Who chooses who
Oh I think I'd like to have a brother or other
Close relationships could be very nice
I touch paradise
I'm walking tall, flying high
In the cold light of day
It's not so easy, I've got to say
Oh I'm so lonely
I'm feeling relatively blue
Oh how I'd love a next to kin or two

There has to a place for me
Where I belong right now
I don't need a dynasty, a name to share, a heart to care
That's really old, then I'll be walking tall
That's really old, that's all I need
A name to share, a heart to care
Then I'll be walking tall
