I Think I'll look around for a whooping crane
I Think I'll look around for a whooping crane
What do ya think this pain has got me?
You think I'm uptight but I'm not
It's just that, I look around for a whooping crane
And I can't find one...

So, I Think I'll look around for a drinking stream
I think I'll look around for a drinking stream
They say you turned the water to wine
And they must have been right this time because
I look around for a drinking stream but I can't find one...

Mighty red man painted ponies brown
Fallen Eagle, feathers on the ground
And the bulletts they spin your dreams around
And they paint your face on the penny brown

So, I think I'll look around for the Yellowstones
I think I'll look around for the Yellowstones
Set your eyes on the eagle's flight,
Cause the, the eyes of God have lost their sight
I look around for the Yellowstones, but I can't find one...

Mighty red man painted ponies brown
Fallen Eagle, feathers on the ground
And the bulletts they spin your dreams around
And they paint your face on the penny brown

Think I'll look around for a whooping crane
I Think I'll look around for a whooping crane
What do ya think this pain has got me?
You think I'm uptight but I'm not,it's just that
I look around for a whooping crane and I can't find one...
