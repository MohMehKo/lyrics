What a pretty mystery you
You suddenly turned out to be
I've never held you gently
but I want to

Well, I'll watch your friends come through the door
and I slide my feet across the floor
there are things I might ask
I don't need to

Can't you tell I'm telling you
that I want to
Understand you, oh

Well, I'm sofa sitting, compromising
Thoughts on what I'm realizing
Ask me what I'm thinking

It's hard to say cause the way I'm reeling
it could be most anything
to do with you

Well, can't you tell I'm telling you
that I want to
Understand you, oh

Some things can remain unsaid, now
You don't have to share your bed with me
It's a gentle thing we're making

Got the time for stronger weather
Until we get to know us better
We'll remain suspended

Can't you tell I'm telling you
that I want to
Understand you, oh

Can't you tell I'm telling you
that I want to
Say I love you
