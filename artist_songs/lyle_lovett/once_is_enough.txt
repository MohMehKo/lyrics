I used to be so much more open minded
And I used to like to fall in love
And they tell me I was so much sweeter and kinder
But once is enough

Yeah I used to be Mr. Understanding
I used to could listen and not interrupt
But now I'm a different man than that man then
'Cause once is enough

And once is enough for anybody
Once is enough to fall in love
Once is enough to feel your heart beat
Once is enough

And yeah I used to be able to handle rejection
I used to be so long lean and tough
And I used to would fight for a woman's affection
But once is enough

Once is enough for anybody
Once is enough to fall in love
Once is enough to feel your heart beat
Once is enough

So baby you don't have to tell me two times
You can save your sweet breath because
I saw the way you looked away from my eyes
And once is enough

But a man can't help can't help but learn his lesson
But a man he can't help the stars above
And a man can't help but go around messing
With once is enough

Once is enough for anybody
Once is enough to fall in love
Once is enough too feel your heart beat
Once is enough

So if you see me down by the byway
Won't you tell me you'll do this much
Take your head just one time and turn it my way
'Cause once is enough

And once is enough for anybody
Once is enough to fall in love
Once is enough to feel your heart beat
Once is enough
