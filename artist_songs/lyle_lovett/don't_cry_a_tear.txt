Go if you must go
Turn if you must turn away
Don't cry a tear for me

Laugh if you can smile
Run if you're walking away
Don't cry a tear for me

Shout if you can speak
Sing if you mention my name
Don't cry a tear for me

Low in the valley, stand in the wind and the rain
High on the mountain, see the sun shining again

Shout if you can speak
Sing when you mention my name
Don't cry a tear for me

So go if you must go
Turn if you must turn away
Don't cry a tear for me.
