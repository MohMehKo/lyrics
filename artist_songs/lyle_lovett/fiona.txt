Way down yonder on the bayou
There lives a little girl-o
Skin so pale
Six feet high
Skinny as a rail
Just one eye

She's the one-eyed Fiona
She's the one-eyed Fiona
She's the one-eyed Fiona
She's the one-eyed Fiona

Her daddy gone to heaven
Her mama won't like you
Her brother he's crazy
He just might bite you
Her sister she's pretty
But she just won't do

She's the one-eyed Fiona
She's the one-eyed Fiona
She's the one-eyed Fiona
She's the one-eyed Fiona

Oh you can say she gonna love you
Because you made a little voodoo
Oh but what they didn't tell you
Is it ain't up to you dude

You better not cross her
You try to boss her
Then you better duck Mister
Here come a cup and saucer

She's the one-eyed Fiona
She's the one-eyed Fiona
She's the one-eyed Fiona
She's the one-eyed Fiona

So if you're going to the bayou
Man I'll tell you all I know
She's got skin so pale
She's six feet high
And she'll look right through you
With just one eye

She's the one-eyed Fiona
She's the one-eyed Fiona
She's the one-eyed Fiona
She's the one-eyed Fiona
