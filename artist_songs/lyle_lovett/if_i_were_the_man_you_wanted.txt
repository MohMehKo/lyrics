They all sat around in a circle
They were all laughing and all telling lies
Then the tall one he bumped in a dollar
He said boys I've got nothing to hide
Now if the King and the Queen stood together
Then the ace he would not be to blame
And if the cards were all laid on the table
Then love could be more than a game

And if the stars didn't shine on the water
Then the sun wouldn't burn on the sand
And if I were the man you wanted
I would not be the man that I am

And I have seen my share of long nights
And I have told my share of lies
And I have run into the darkness
When I saw the look in your eyes
But if the night didn't lie in the darkness
Then the daylight would be hard to find
And if the truth didn't turn to a weakness
I would have never have spoken my mind

And if the stars didn't shine on the water
Then the sun wouldn't burn on the sand
And if I were the man you wanted
Then I would not be the man that I am

So if you're going out to Carolina
Then don't linger in New Mexico
And if you think of the one there behind you
Then you might not feel so alone

And if the stars didn't shine on the water
Then the sun wouldn't burn on the sand
And if I were the man you wanted
I would not be the man that I am
