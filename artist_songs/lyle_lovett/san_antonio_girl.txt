Since I first saw you I've been thinkin' about you
And now I'm out here on the highway goin' crazy without you
I can't help but want you girl, you're young and you're pretty
But somehow I can't see you up in New York City

I'm gonna leave you alone in your own little world
But won't you be my San Antonio girl
Be my San Antonio girl
Be my, be my, be my, San Antonio girl

Now I know you've heard the stories bout life in the fast lane
What they didn't tell you is you come home on a slow train
I'd just as soon remember you the way that I found you
Dancin' by yourself with the stars all around you
