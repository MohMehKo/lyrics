As I lay sick and broken
Viva Mexico
My eyes just won't stay open
And I dream a dream of home
I dream a dream of home

Where there's coffee on the table
And kindness in your hand
Honey I'll help you when I'm able
But right now I'm feeling bad
Right now I'm feeling bad

Listen to your heart that beats
And follow it with both your feet
And as you walk and as you breathe
You ain't no friend to me
You ain't no friend to me

The road to Ensenada
Is plenty wide and fast
If you head South from Tijuana
Then I'll see you at last
I'll see you at last

But my eyes they open slowly
And they look around the room
The old man he seems worried
And there ain't no sign of you
There ain't no sign of you

Listen to your heart that beats
And follow it with both your feet
And as you walk and as you breathe
You ain't no friend of me
You ain't no friend of me

You can offer to the righteous
The good that you have won
But down here among the unclean
Your good work just comes undone
Your good work just comes undone

The sisters at the borderline
They're holding out their hands
They're begging me for something Lord
But I don't understand
I don't understand

So it's adios to Alvero
Tell him to stay between the lines
And if he sees that Gabriella girl
Tell her I'll look her up next time
Say I'll look her up next time

Because the road to Ensenada
Is plenty wide and fast
And this time through Tijuana
Well it won't be my last
It won't be my last

Listen to your heart that beats
And follow it with both your feet
And as you walk and as you breathe
You ain't no friend of me
You ain't no friend of me
You ain't no friend of me
