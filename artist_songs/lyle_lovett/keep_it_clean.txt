Yeah, I went to the river and I couldn't get across
Jumped on your back because I thought it was a horse
I rode him over
Gimme Coca-Cola, lemon soda, salted ice cream

And I give him soap and water
Honey, gonna keep it clean
Baby, gonna keep it clean

Bought a wig for your mama 'cause you had bad hair
Put a muzzle on your daddy 'cause he look like a bear
Rode him over
Gimme Coca-Cola, lemon soda, salted ice cream

And I give him soap and water
Honey, gonna keep it clean
Baby, gonna keep it clean

You got a head like an owl and a mouth like a dope
Every time you see him you say you looking for some soap
You roll him over
Gimme Coca-Cola, lemon soda, salted ice cream

And I give him soap and water
Honey, gonna keep it clean
Baby, gonna keep it clean

Now, the dirtiest sight that I ever seen
Was a cook doing business and his hands wasn't clean
I rode him over
Gimme Coca-Cola, lemon soda, salted ice cream

And I give him soap and water
Honey, gonna keep it clean
Baby, gonna keep it clean

Now you wanna go to heaven when you D-I-E
Gotta put on your collar with your T-I-E
Ride him over
Gimme Coca-Cola, lemon soda, salted ice cream

And I give him soap and water
Honey, gonna keep it clean
Baby, gonna keep it clean

Oh, if you wanna get a rabbit off a L-O-G
You got to pull him off the stump like a D-O-G
Ride him over
Gimme Coca-Cola lemon soda, salted ice cream

And I give him soap and water
Honey, gonna keep it clean
Baby, gonna keep it clean

Cryin', "Run here, doctor, won't you run here fast"
See what's a matter with the Yeah Yeah Yeahs
Ride him over
Gimme Coca-Cola lemon soda, salted ice cream

And I give him soap and water
Honey, gonna keep it clean
Baby, gonna keep it clean
Honey, gonna keep it clean
Baby, gonna keep it clean
