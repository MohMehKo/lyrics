Now to find a man good loving
Ain't an easy thing to do
You've got to know just what you're looking for
And where to find it too

She's hot to go she's ready
She's hot to go right now
She's hot to go
You've got to know
That stop-and-do-it gal

We don't have no lengthy shopping
You don't have to stand in line
You don't have to care who sees your hair
You don't have to waste your time

She's hot to go she's ready
She's hot to go right now
She's hot to go
You've got to know
That stop-and-do-it gal

You can stop by in the morning
You can stop by late at night
You can stop by if you're ugly friend
Or if you look all right

She's hot to go she's ready
She's hot to go right now
She's hot to go
You've got to know
That stop-and-do-it gal

Now I crept up from behind her
She looked so fine to me
But when I stepped around her man
My eyes could plainly see

She was ugly from the front
She was ugly from the front
She was ugly from the front
And I said ugly-ugly-ugly-ugly-ugly

Well I could handle it behind her
And I like it on the side
But don't make me look around her man 'cause she's
Ugly-ugly-ugly-ugly-ugly

She was ugly from the front
She was ugly from the front
She was ugly from the front
And I said this girl was so ugly...

She's hot to go she's ready
She's hot to go right now
She's hot to go
You've got to know
That stop-and-do-it gal
