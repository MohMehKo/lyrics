Ain't no big dog, Coming to bite you
Ain't no bad man, Coming to find you
Just rest easy, We'll be home soon
And you'll be sleeping, In your own room
Don't you worry little one
Don't you worry little one
Everything is going to be all right In the morning light

Mama loves you, Daddy does too
Grandma wants you, After schools through
You just be cool
And rest easy
'Cause you're the king of All that you see
So don't you worry little one
Don't you worry little one
Everything is going to be all right In the morning light

When you're sleeping, What do you see
Must be angels Smiling at me
What did I do
To deserve you There weren't nothing As far as I knew

I'd go faster, In the pasture
But in Tomball, Live the law dogs
Thirty's fine, Oh, but thirty-one is a crime
And they all, Have a gun
But don't you worry little one
Don't you worry little one
Everything is going to be all right In the morning light
