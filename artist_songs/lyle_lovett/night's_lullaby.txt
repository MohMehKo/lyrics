The sandman is calling
Your adlibs are falling
Like stars shooting out the sky
The dewdrops they glisten
As we lie here and listen
To sound of the night's lullaby

Sleep tight little darling
You'll rise in the morning
And heaven will keep you from harm
As you lie in your sweet mother's arms
As you lie in your sweet mother's arms

The twilight brings trouble
The moon ever struggles
To shine like his brother the sun
The wind reassures him
With thunder and lightning
Darkness declares day is done

Good night little darling
We'll rise in the morning
And heaven will keep us from harm
As we lie in your sweet mother's arms
As we lie in your sweet mother's arms

Sleep tight little darling
We'll rise in the morning
And heaven will keep us from harm
As we lie in your sweet mother's arms
As we lie in your sweet mother's arms
As we lie in your sweet mother's arms
As we lie in your sweet mother's arms
