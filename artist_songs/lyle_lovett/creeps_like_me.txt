I wear Grandmother's ring
On my finger
On my finger
She had a tooth of gold
And just before she died
She said son
You can have my tooth
But do I
Really have to go

Look around
And you will see
This world is full of creeps like me
You look surpised
You shouldn't be
This world is full of creeps like me

And I keep my Uncle Leon
In my closet
In my closet
There don't nobody know
Just me and Uncle Leon
And my closet
And they wonder
Where'd that old man go

Look around and you will see
This world is full of creeps like me
You look surpised
You shouldn't be
This world is full of creeps like me

And I knew this pretty girl once
She was eighteen...
Maybe
What's a year or two
And one day when she asked me
If I loved her
I said baby
What's it worth to you

But look around
And you will see
This world is full of creeps like me
You look surpised
You shouldn't be
This world is full of creeps like me

And I wear Grandmother's ring
On my finger
On my finger
She had a tooth of gold
She had a tooth of gold
She had a tooth of gold
