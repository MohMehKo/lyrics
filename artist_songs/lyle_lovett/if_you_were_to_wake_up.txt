If you were to wake up
And I were beside you
Would you gently smile dear
And whisper my name
And would you remember
The way that I held you
And would you want me
To hold you again

Time reaches to you
Just like a willow
That bends to the water
And clings to the shore
And there was a time dear
That once you did love me
And there was a time
You loved me no more

Rain on your window
Light on your pillow
The way you lie sleeping
Is it like before
For there was a time dear
That once you did love me
And there was a time
You loved me no more
