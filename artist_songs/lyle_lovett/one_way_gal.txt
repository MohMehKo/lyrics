One thing I like about that gal of mine
One thing I like about that gal of mine
One thing I like about that gal of mine
She treats me right and loves me all the time

Sometimes I'm broke and blue as I can be
Sometimes I'm broke and blue as I can be
Sometimes I'm broke and blue as I can be
But still my baby she looks after me

She walked in the rain till her feet got soaking wet
She walked in the rain till her feet got soaking wet
She walked in the rain till her feet got soaking wet
And this she said to every man she met

Mister change a dollar - gimme a lousy dime
Mister change a dollar - gimme a lousy dime
Mister change a dollar - gimme a lousy dime
So I can feed that hungry man of mine

That gal of mine shes one way all the time
That gal of mine shes one way all the time
That gal of mine shes one way all the time
She takes the blues away and satisfies my mind
