If I needed you
Would you come to me
Would you come to me
And ease my pain
If you needed me
I would come to you
I'd swim the seas
For to ease your pain

In the night forlorn
Ah, the morning's born
And the morning shines
With the lights of love
You will miss sunrise
If you close your eyes
That would break
My heart in two

Lady's with me now
Since I showed her how
To lay her lilly hand in mine
Loop and Lil agree
She's a sight to see
And a treasure for
The poor to find
