Late nights in musty motel rooms
Stale lives left by someone else
White lies I wish I could tell you
And questions I ask of myself

Why do I do the things that make me sorry
Why do I do the things that make you cry
Will I lose your love to another
Who loves you better than I

The angels smile when you're praying
But the devil laughs when you lie
And some things they go without saying
When tears fill up your eyes

Why do I do the things that make me sorry
Why do I do the things that make you cry
Will I lose your love to another
Who loves you better than I

Some questions beg for an answer
Like a poet begs for a rhyme
Somehow all I can remember
Is holding your hand in mine

Late nights in musty motel rooms
Stale lives left all alone
He's telling you how he wants you
And I'm praying he doesn't know

Why I do the things that make me sorry
Why I do the things that make you cry
If I could lose your love to another
Who loves you better than I

Who loves you better than I
