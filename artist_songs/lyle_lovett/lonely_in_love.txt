I'm looking at a star
Wondering where you are
Lonely in love
Looking at the sky
Start to wonder my love
How long I'm going to burn
With this same old flame
I miss you all the time
Ain't unhappy
But I'm lonely in love

I know I didn't treat you right
Scared you into flight
Lonely in love
Never acted wise
Couldn't organize love
But these longings return
When I hear your name
I let you go and now
I can't forget somehow
I'm lonely in love

I'm young in the daylight
With a pocket full of money
Ladies to the left
And to the right
But when night time comes
I'm a star watcher Honey
I can't get along
On light bulb light

So I'm looking at a star
Wondering where you are
Lonely in love
Looking at the sky
Start to wonder my love
How long I'm going to play
In this rained out game
It don't make any sense
But Honey be convinced
I'm lonely in love
