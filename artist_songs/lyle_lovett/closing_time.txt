The night she is a true companion
They shuffle in
They hear the sound
But by night's end
It's night's abandon
You look across the floor
Ain't anyone around

Closing time
Unplug them people
And send them home
It's closing time

Now Kenny he's been mixing sound all evening
Sometimes I think that boy
He ain't got no ears
And Kathy's laughing
Kathy's always laughing
Well keep on laughing Kathy
Just make it out of here

Closing time
Unplug them people
And send them home
It's closing time

So stack those chairs upon those tables
And stack those empties upon that bar
And count your money
And count my money
And hear those bottles ringing
You know where you are

Closing time
Unplug them people
And send them home
It's closing time

The night's all that's left behind
You take your part and I'll take mine
And go on home
It's closing time
