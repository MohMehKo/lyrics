I walked in his office
He told me pull up a chair
And he looked in my eyes
With a cold steely stare
And he spoke with a wisdom
That I'd never heard
And as I was hanging
On every last word

He said son
I think you know what I mean
He said son
I think you know what I mean
He said son
I think you know what I mean

He said the hallway is lonesome
And the hallway is long
And one end is shiny
And one end is gone
And the middle burns brightly
With the color of night
And the doors are all open
But no one's inside

He said son
I think you know what I mean
He said son
I think you know what I mean
He said son
I think you know what I mean

Hell he hollered
And he hopped up
And he kicked back his chair
And he said I'd be stupid
If I didn't care
To understand better
Would leave him no doubt
In a world full of something
That I'd be without

He said son
I think you know what I mean
He said son
I think you know what I mean
He said son
I think you know what I mean

But it's springtime in Texas
And my memory grows faint
As the bluebonnets dance
With the indian paints
The highway is lonesome
But the highway is straight
And some things are heavy
But they ain't worth the weight

I think you know what I mean
I think you know what I really mean
I think you know what I mean

I think you know what I mean
I think you know what I really mean
I think you know what I mean
