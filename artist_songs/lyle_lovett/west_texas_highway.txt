Now I was driving down
A West Texas highway
I saw a hitchhiker
And his thumb was pointing my way
He didn't look suspicious
And he didn't look any too clean

I put on my brakes
And I opened my door
I could tell he was a bum
By the muddy boot he wore
He said I'm going down to Haskell
Got a woman down in Abilene

He said East Texas
Is where I come from
I was working a rodeo out there
And it sure got humdrum
So I'm just traveling around
A whole lot of Texas I've seen

I'm mighty glad
You were going my way
In your brand new clothes there
And your great big Chevrolet
I'm going down to Haskell
Got a woman down in Abilene

Well he was grinning like a possum
And a mighty happy rascal
And he waved good-bye
When I let him out in Haskell
And that's about the last
Of that old road tramp
I ever did see

But I'm still wishing
To this very day
That he had my clothes
And my big Chevrolet
And it was me going to Haskell
With a woman down in Abilene
