Lie beside me
Whisper to me that you want me
Arms around me
Whisper to me that you want me
There's nothing here to be afraid of
It's just the morning

Stop you talking
Into the night now don't you worry
Stop your tossing
Into the night now don't you worry
There's nothing here to be afraid of
It's just the morning

It's just the morning
The coffee's almost done
You can smell it crawling in here from the kitchen
It's just the morning
Falling through the window
And the floor it's always cold

If you see me
Can you tell me if I'm sleeping
If you hear me
Can you tell me what I'm dreaming
There's nothing here to be afraid of
It's just the morning

It's just the morning
The coffee's almost done
You can smell it crawling in here from the kitchen
It's just the morning
Falling through the window
And the floor it's always cold

So lie beside me
Whisper to me that you want me
Arms around me
Whisper to me that you know me
There's nothing here to be afraid of
It's just the morning
