I've got some birds outside
What sit on my window sill
Some birds won't you know
But some birds will
All my love is gone

She was angry
He was free
She loved him
The she left me
Now all my love is gone

All my love is gone
All my love is gone

I see the lights they're flashing
Way on up the road
The red one stops you know
But the wrong one goes
Now all my love is gone

All my love is gone
All my love is gone

And you can beg for sunshine
To pale the moon
But there ain't a thing my friend
What you can do
When all your love is gone

So if you were thinking about coming back, baby
Now you can do as you please
But don't waste your time
With him on me
Because all my love is gone

All my love is gone
All my love is gone
All my love is gone
All my love is gone

But I've got some birds outside
What sit on my window sill
Some birds won't you know
But some birds will
When all your love is gone
