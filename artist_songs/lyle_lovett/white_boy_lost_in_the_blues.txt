You bought you a six string Gibson
You bought you a great big house
You try to sing like Muddy Waters
And play like Lightnin' sounds

But since I blowed my harp
You feelin' mean and confused.
It got you chained to your earphones,
You just a white boy, lost in the blues.

You got your 44 Desoto
Great big horns that toots,
44 bad buttons on your every-day suit,
But since I bent mah strings
You been feelin' mean and confused
It got you chained to your earphones,
You just a white boy, lost in the blues.

I got my home on the hillside
Never feel the cold
Got my loving woman
And the bluuuues in my soul
Since I heard you cooking
I been really mean and confused
It got me chained to my headphones
White boy, lost in the blues...

It's got you chained to your earphones
Yer jes' a white boy. lost int he blues...

It's got me chained to my earphones
A white boy, lost in the blues...

It's got you chained to your earphones,
A white boy, lost in the blues!
