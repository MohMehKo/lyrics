Pack the sofa
And pack the old arm chair
Tell the china
To ask the silverware
To pray we find that
They speak the language there
And say good-bye to Carolina

Leave the puppies
And leave the old porch swing
Tell the children
We're bringing everything
And tell the picture
Of Martin Luther King
To say good-bye to Carolina

Go west young man while you still can
Before you're old and gray
Go west and make a better life
Than you could if you stayed

So tell your family
And tell your friends good-bye
Say you'll write them
And keep them on your mind
And say you'll see them
Whenever someone dies
And says good-bye to Carolina

Leave the puppies
And leave the old porch swing
Tell the children
We're leaving everything
Except the picture
Of Martin Luther King
To say good-bye to Carolina

Go west young man while you still can
Before you're out of time
And you can always come back home
Tomorrow if you like

So wave to the tractor
And to the tractor shed
And to the milk cow
That kicked me in the head
I can't remember
But was it I who said
Good-bye to Carolina
