Old friend
All the stories to tell
Old friend
Could you bid me farewell
Old friend
It might be easy for another man to see

Old foe
All the pain and the scars
Old foe
Could you lay down your arms
Old foe
It might be easy for another man to see

Put your head down on my pillow
Put your hand on me and hold on
Hold on

Put your head down on my pillow
Put your hand on me and hold on
Hold on

Old friend
Old friend
Old friend
It might be easy for another man to see
But I think you still look a lot like me
