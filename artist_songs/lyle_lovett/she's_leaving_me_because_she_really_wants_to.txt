Thank you my friend
I sincerely appreciate the words you say
About how she'll cry
And how she'll grieve and miss me
When she goes away

Say them again
I need to hear the words once more
I can't believe
How she'll miss me when she's gone
And how she'll want to come back home
And never leave

But she's leaving me
Because she really wants to
And she'll be happy when she's gone
She'll be happy
She'll be so very happy
She'll dance and sing
Or even learn to fly
And spend her time with anyone but me

What's that you say
That I'll get over her the more that time goes by
But time goes so slow
When all I have to do is sit around and cry

No she won't be back
I'd be a fool to try to fool myself that way
I know she hasn't one regret
Because she hasn't had one since
The day she came to stay

She's leaving me
Because she really wants to
And she'll be happy when she's gone
She'll be happy
She'll be so very happy
She'll dance and sing
And even learn to fly
And spend her time with anyone but me

She'll be happy when she's gone
She'll be happy when she's gone
She'll be happy when she's gone
She'll be happy when she's gone
