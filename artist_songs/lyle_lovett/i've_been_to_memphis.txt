The sun comes up
In a coffee cup
Waitress please I've had enough

Lord I can't believe what I see
How could you be alone
When you could sit right here beside me girl
And make yourself at home

I've been to Memphis
And Muscle Shoals
And I love a woman
What I don't know

When the sun goes down
In another town
Bartender please another round

Lord I can't believe what I see
How could you be alone
When you could sit right here beside me girl
And make yourself at home

I've been to Houston
And San Antonio
And I love a woman
What I don't know

Sherry she had big ones
Sally had some too
But Allison had little ones
What hate to go to school

And I make my bed
Where I lay my head
And I wish I heard what she just said

Lord I can't believe what I see
How could you be alone
When you could sit right here beside me girl
And make yourself at home

I've been to LA
And El Paso
And I love a woman
What I don't know

Sherry she had big ones
Sally had some too
But Allison had little ones
What hate to go to school

And I make my bed
Where I lay my head
And I wish I heard what she just said

Lord I can't believe what I see
How could you be alone
When you could sit right here beside me girl
And make yourself at home

I've been to...
And where I go
I love a woman
What I don't know
