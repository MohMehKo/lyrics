She wore glass slippers
She held her head up high
She had that sparkle at her feet
And that twinkle in her eye

She smiled at me
And I wondered why
She said I'm looking for a cowboy
To take me for a ride

And he can rope me on the prarie
And he can ride me on the plain
And I will be his Cinderalla
If he'll be my cowboy man

She said I've got a 40-gallon stetson hat
With a 38-foot brim
We could dance around the outside baby
'Til we both fall in

And you can rope me on the prarie
And you can ride me on the plain
And I will be your Cinderalla
If you'll be my cowboy man

Now I ain't never been no cowboy
But heaven knows I try
'Cause I'll be riding tall in my saddle
With that Cinderalla by my side

And I can rope her on the prarie
And I can ride her on the plain
And she will be me my Cinderalla
If I'll be her cowboy man
