It's a sunny day in California
But that old sun it's shining on me right here at home
It's one of those days
When those great ideas they just seem to fall out on you
And they always fall the greatest when you're falling all alone
It makes for a good day for some serious reflection
And massive rationalization
For contemplating the future of the future
And the last of the past
And wondering if you could ever forgive me darling
All the trouble that I put to you
And if I could forget all those questions
That I never asked
And if I could forgive
The temporary weight gain due to excess water retention
I could forgive the rest too
It's just a fact of life
That no one cares to mention
She wasn't good
But she had good intentions

So the grass it grows
When the sun it shines
And my face it glows
When the woman's mine
And you say I'm a fool-around
Honey that may be true
But I'd sooner fool around
Than be a fool for a fool
And if I could forgive
The unadulterated adulterating apprehension
I could forgive the rest too
It's just a fact of life
That no one cares to mention
She wasn't good
But she had good intentions

So I'm twenty-six and rising
Still too young to live
But too low to go
I guess it's the process
Of learning to excess
All of those things
That you already know
And if I could forgive
The honey-I-swear-it-didn't-mean-a-thing-to-me
Attempt at abstention
I could forgive the rest too
It's just a fact of life
That no ones cares to mention
She wasn't good
But she had good intentions
