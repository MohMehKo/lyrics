You don't have to live a life of sin
You don't have to break the law
And break the law again
You can make just one mistake
And it can take you to your grave, honey
One bad move can turn your world upside down
It's such a shame 'cause you've been so good up to now

Yes I saw the light fall from your eyes
Yes I saw how easy it was
The light it never lies
And as the darkness touched your lips
They tried to warn your fingertips, honey
One bad move can turn your world upside down
It's such a shame 'cause you've been so good up to now

When he looks at you what will he see
You can hide from him, baby
But you can't hide from me

You know right from right
And wrong from wrong
You know you can try to stop
But you can't stop for long
And you just don't seem to be yourself
So you do it like your someone else, honey
One bad move can turn your world upside down
It's such a shame 'cause you've been so good up to now
It's such a shame 'cause you've been so good up to now
