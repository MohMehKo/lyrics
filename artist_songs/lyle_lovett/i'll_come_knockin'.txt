When you want me
I'll come knockin'
At your door
At your door
One of these days now
You'll be rockin'
You'll be rockin'
In my arms once more

Buddy I'm late again
I'm late again
I'm late again
Show me a wonder
That you can't be sure of
Now it's wait again
It's wait again
It's wait again
Show me a picture
Of the one you love

When you want me
I'll come knockin'
At your door
At your door
One of these days now
You'll be rockin'
You'll be rockin'
In my arms once more

But it was Christmas time
It was Easter time
It was Summer time
Sail away, sail away
To your daddy's garden
Now it's Winter time
It's Winter time
It's Winter time
And it's much too late
To ask your pardon

When you want me
I'll come knockin'
At your door
At your door
One of these days now
You'll be rockin'
You'll be rockin'
In my arms once more
