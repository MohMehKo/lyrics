He's pulling out for Reno
He hopes a tire don't blow
Up near Albuquerque
He'll fuel and get some coffee
Cline's Corners truck stop
A waitress with a wet mop
Telling him to don't walk
He tips his hat and don't talk

He knows it's nothing but a good ride
No there's nothing there he can't slide
No there's nothing that he won't spin
No there's nothing to it do it again
No it's nothing but the big show
No there's nowhere that he won't go
No he never has to ask why
He knows it's nothing but a good ride

He says there's something about a sunrise
Waking up sleepy eyed
He says there's something about a highway
Telling him he can't stay
He says there's something about a long drive
That gives him some peace of mind
And there's something that he can't take
When he's coming in second place

He knows it's nothing but a good ride
No there's nothing there he can't slide
No there's nothing that he won't spin
No there's nothing to it do it again
No it's nothing but the big show
No there's nowhere that he won't go
No he never has to ask why
He knows it's nothing but a good ride

And when it's all over
He'll move a little slower
He'll back up to the trailer
And look toward Oklahoma
He'll pull out right through the middle of town
And watch the sun start sinking down
Still just lighting up the road signs
Getting ready for the next time.

He knows it's nothing but a good ride
No there's nothing there he can't slide
No there's nothing that he won't spin
No there's nothing to it do it again
No it's nothing but the big show
No there's nowhere that he won't go
No he never has to ask why
He knows it's nothing but a good ride
