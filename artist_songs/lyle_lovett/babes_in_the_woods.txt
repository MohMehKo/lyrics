Babes in the woods
Oh which way to go
Babes in the woods
No one to say no
Pretty people come to me
Cry your heart all out
Tell me what it's all about

Who remembers Kerouac
What was that all about
Right on Jack
So long Jack
Who remembers anything
And who cares anyhow
But here's to those still on the road
And those on the road back

Babes in the woods
Oh which way to go
Babes in the woods
No one to say no
Pretty people come to me
Cry your heart all out
Tell me what it's all about

Pretty people hear me cry
Cry my heart all out
Tell me what it's all about
