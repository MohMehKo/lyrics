When I was a very young man
I was a cowboy
The best in the land
But then she settled me down
With a touch of her hand
Now I'm begging you mister
Tell me if you can

Which way does that old pony run
Which way does that old pony run
And how much is that saddle
And a straight shooting gun
Which way does that old pony run

Now a young girl
She don't know when she's lying
But a woman
Great God she knows how its done
So mama before I go
There's just one thing on my mind
Which way does that old pony run

Which way does that old pony run
Which way does that old pony run
And how much is that saddle
And a straight shooting gun
Which way does that old pony run

So this good life you know I must leave
Your new car
And your color TV
But what's riches to you
Just ain't riches to me
And if you're staying out here
Then I'm headed back east

Which way does that old pony run
Which way does that old pony run
And how much is that saddle
And a straight shooting gun
Which way does that old pony run
