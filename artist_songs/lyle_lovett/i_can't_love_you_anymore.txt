This Georgia road is red
The Georgia sky is blue
And it looks just like the sky
That carried me to you
The good Lord up in heaven knows
What I've been going through
And he's whispering to me
That I'll get over you

My angel in distress
You look OK to me
I'll send you my address
I could easily stay with you
On your side of heaven's door
'Cause I don't love you any less
But I can't love you anymore

It's Tuscaloosa, Birmingham
Or Baton Rouge
Hell I don't know just where I'm at
To tell the truth
But the good Lord up in heaven knows
What you've been going through
And he's whispering to me
That he'll take care of you

My angel in distress
You look OK to me
I'll send you my address
When I know what it will be
I could easily stay with you
On your side of heaven's door
'Cause I don't love you any less
But I can't love you anymore

My angel in distress
You look OK to me
I'll send you my address
When I know what it will be
I could easily stay with you
On your side of heaven's door
'Cause I don't love you any less
But I can't love you anymore

I don't love you any less
But I can't love you anymore
