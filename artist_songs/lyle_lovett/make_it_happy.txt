Slap my baby on the
Make it happy
Slap my baby on the
Make it fun
Slap my baby on the
Make it happy
I'm a happy son-of-a-gun

Well i'm going to the grocery
On the corner
For to buy me a coke and some gum
Well i'm going to the grocery
On the corner
I'm a drinking, chewing son-of-a-gun

Well i whistle when i'm walking
In the summer
Well i whistle in the spring
And the fall
Well i whistle when i'm walking
In the winter
Or else i don't go walking at all

You know i wake up early
In the morning
You know i work until my day is done
You know when i come home late
In the eveving
I'm a happy son-of-a-gun
