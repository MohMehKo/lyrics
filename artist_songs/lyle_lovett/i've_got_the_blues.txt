I ain't heard your voice
In such as long time
And I ain't called your number
On that telephone line
And I believed in my soul
That I left you behind
But here I am calling
And here I am crying

I've got the blues
Won't you save me
I've got the blues
As far as I can see
I've got the blues
Won't you save me
'Cause I'm feel like I'm dying
From that old used to be

Now if the angels
Don't swim in the ocean
And if the fishes
Don't walk on the sea
And if my teardrops
Don't rise up to heaven
Then that angel I'm loving
Lord she never loved me

I've got the blues
Won't you save me
I've got the blues
As far as I can see
I've got the blues
Won't you save me
'Cause I'm feel like I'm dying
From that old used to be
