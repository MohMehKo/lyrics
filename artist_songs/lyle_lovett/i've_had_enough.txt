I've had enough
Of words and games
I don't think I know you
I can't forget your name
Your eyes are clear
The way is strange
The light's in the hallway
If you forget your way

You were here to be only
What you wanted anyway
You were sad to be sorry
You were sorry everyday
You were here to be loved
But love's trickled away
From your eyes

I tell myself
I'm least of all to blame
For these words of my choosing
For my rules that make the game
But my eyes are clear
I can see the way is strange
Through the dark of the hallway
That echoes back your name

I was here to be only
What I wanted anyway
I was sad to be sorry
I was sorry everyday
I was here to be loved
But love's trickled away
From my eyes
