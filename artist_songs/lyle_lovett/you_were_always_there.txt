The sun comes up
The world goes round and round
There's no bad luck, its
Just the luck you found
You steal away
Into a lonesome sun
Another day
Is lowered in the ground

I feel my heartbeat
It's pounding in my head
I hear the hooves beat
They must be drawing near
I feel the wind blow
It's rushing through my hair
Out in the shadows
Your face is everywhere

You were standing there beside me
Right where you are supposed to be right now
Now there is no one left to guide
Tell me now what I am supposed to do
I am supposed to do

You were always there
You were always there
You were always there
You were always there

A new horizon It's all supposed to be
I close my eyes
I look at what I see
I hear the laughing and crying from above
It's just the voice
Eternal hoping love

You were standing there beside me
Right where you are supposed to be right now
Now there is no one left to guide
Tell me now what I am supposed to do
I am supposed to do

You were always there
You were always there
You were always there
You were always there

[Instrumental]

You were always there
You were always there
You were always there
You were always there

You were always there
You were always there
You were always there
You were always there
