With the moon on my shoulder
And you on my mind
I will lay down
I will lay down
With the moon on my shoulder
And you on my mind

I will miss you more than I ever did
Lord ever did
They said that time would take care of it
Take care of it
I wish time would take care of me

With the moon on my shoulder
And you on my mind
I will lay down
I will lay down
With the moon on my shoulder
And you on my mind
