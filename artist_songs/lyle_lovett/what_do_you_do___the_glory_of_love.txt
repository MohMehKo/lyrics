Honey bring me the paper
And pour me a beer
And turn on the TV
And sweep up over here
You tell me you love me
To put off my blues
But what do you do
When it quits being new

Now you be home for supper
And don't slam that door
And you better be a sober man
Or I'll give you what for
You tell me you love me
To put off my blues
But what do you do
When it quits being new

We used to not worry about nothing
We used to would laugh and play
But now when we look at each other
We never have nothing to say

Except for you know well she says
You could take me to dinner
And you could buy me some clothes
If you make all that money man
Make damn sure it shows
You could tell me you love me
To put off my blues
But what do you do
When it quits being new

And he says you could put on some makeup
And you could pile up your hair
And at least try to do something
With what you've got there
You could tell me you love me
To put off my blues
But what do you do
Say what do you do

When it
What do you do when it
Say what do you do when it

Say well
Hi there
What's your
My name is
And my wife is at the PT and
I had to
You know we could
I buy you
Is that a Scotch and so a
What will it be
Your place
Or a place to

Say man
What do you think you
See I'm not that kind of
Affair is fair
And right is
Right around the corner
Just a block or
So you know come morning
You'll have to leave
Everything to me

What do you do
Say what do you do
And that's the glory of
And that's the story of
What do you do
