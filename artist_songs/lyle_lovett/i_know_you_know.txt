Tell me something that you mean
Not just what comes to mind
'Cause I can see you're somewhere in between
This morning and the late last night

And I know you know
I know you know
I know you know
I'm so in love with you

Even the stars will pass away
And the sun will burn to coal
And even men will hear the angels say
He was a fool to let it show

But I know you know
And there ain't nothing I can do
I know you know
I know you know
I'm so in love with you

And I know it ain't never come to no good
And I know it seems like it ain't no use
And I know I should've left while I still could
But I can't find a reason to

So tell me something that you mean
Not just what comes to mind
Because you know I would believe
Anything you'd say

And I know you know
I know you know
I know you know
I'm so in love with you
