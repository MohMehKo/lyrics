Life's been good to me
I thank the good Lord for the way things are
Good friends and family
Well God is good as good can be

I've had an excellent time so far
There's only one thing that I fear
I've been up so long on this lucky star
It could be all downhill from here
It could be all downhill from here

Well I've been the whole world 'round
I've been up and I've been down
I've been good and I've been bad
Mostly I've been bad

I've had an excellent time so far
There's only one thing that I fear
I've been up so long on this lucky star
It could be all downhill from here
It could be all downhill from here

I ride a good horse
Well, I like him, of course
I've got a beautiful girlfriend
Sometimes we stay in

I've had an excellent time so far
There's only one thing that I fear
I've been up so long on this lucky star
It could be all downhill from here
It could be all downhill from here

Good luck, you can't buy it
Joe Ely and I sit next to that John Hiatt
We park next to Guy Clark
We sing when it gets dark

I've had an excellent time so far
There's only one thing that I fear
I've been up so long on this lucky star
It could be all downhill from here
It could be all downhill from here
It could be all downhill from here
