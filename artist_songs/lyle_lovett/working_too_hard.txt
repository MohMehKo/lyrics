The whistle blows
At the break of dawn
Still that evening
The work goes on
Sixteen hours
Of every day
And Baby if I could
You know I'd walk away

I've been working too hard to win your love
Working too hard to win your love
Working too hard to win your love

Now a man he does
The things he'll do
A woman knows
Still her hope stays true
Rise up early
Rise up strong
I feel the pain Baby
Don't let on

I've been working too hard to win your love
Working too hard to win your love
Working too hard to win your love

[Instrumental]

Home is empty
The road is long
It feels like years now
That I've been gone
And all I want
And all I choose
And Baby all I have
I have to lose

I've been working too hard to win your love
Working too hard to win your love
Working too hard to win your love

I've been working too hard to win your love
Working too hard to win your love
Working too hard to win your love

I've been working too hard to win your love
Working too hard to win your love
Working too hard to win your love
