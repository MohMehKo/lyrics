Interstate 610
Highway 45
A sun-drunk redneck
Barely left me alive

That's when I saw her
Singin' and laughin'
Tryin' to pass me
In a Volkswagen

She's as cute as a Bug
Short as a minute
She's a pretty little package with
Everything in it
I've said enough
To praise God above
I'm crazy in love
She's as cute as a Bug

Playin' at the rodeo
Lots of people I don't know
Better ask around I guess
And try to stay behind this mess

Mister, have you seen that car?
Blowing like a hurricane
I hope she hadn't gone too far
I don't even know her name

She's as cute as a Bug
Short as a minute
She's a pretty little package with
Everything in it
I've said enough
To praise God above
I'm crazy in love
She's as cute as a Bug

Heading up north I will
Come through Huntsville
Trinity and Palestine
I'm going back to Tennessee

Lookin' through my windshield
I can still see her
Man, I got a bad case
Of Volkswagen fever

She's as cute as a Bug
Short as a minute
She's a pretty little package with
Everything in it
I've said enough
To praise God above
I'm crazy in love
She's as cute as a Bug

Cute as a Bug
Short as a minute
She's a pretty little package with
Everything in it
I've said enough
To praise God above
I'm crazy in love
She's as cute as a Bug
