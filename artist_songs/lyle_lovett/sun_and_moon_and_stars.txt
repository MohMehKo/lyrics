The sun, the moon and the stars, they make the wind blow
It took me twenty years to understand
But lost to me is how the lives of friends go
Like autumn leaves in Oklahoma wind

But it made me strong to be on my own
It never did me no harm to live all alone
Oh, but now and then in the color of the evening
Drunken in a barroom with a fan turning, I've come to miss a few

This afternoon was cloudy then the rains came
Third day of my first day San Miguel
Seems lately that I'm doubling as storm bait
I've been followed like a shadow through the dell

But it made me strong to be on my own
It never did me no harm to live all alone
Oh, but now and then in the color of the evening
Drunken in a barroom with a fan turning, I've come to miss a few

Dear friends and relations, see what I have done
I've gathered all my fingers in one place
They breathe a breath that's deadly stale since they tooled a song for me
I guess mechanics never really set the pace

'Cause I'm back and I'm strong, I'm here on my own
It never did me no harm to live all alone
Oh, but now and then in the color of the evening
Drunken in a barroom with a fan turning, I've come to miss a few

The sun, the moon and the stars, they make the wind blow
It took me twenty years to understand
But lost to me is how the lives of friends go
Like autumn leaves in Oklahoma wind

Oh, now and then, it's in the color of the evening
Drunken in a barroom with a fan turning, I'll come to miss a few
