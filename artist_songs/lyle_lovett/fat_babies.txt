I said I don't like hippies
And I don't like cornbread
And I don't like much
I said I don't hippies
And I don't like cornbread
And I don't like much
But that's okay

Fat babies have no pride
Fat babies have no pride
Fat babies have no pride
And that's okay
Who needs pride

I like you
'Cause you like me
And you don't like much
I like you
'Cause you like me
And you don't like much
And that's okay

'Cause fat babies have no pride
Fat babies have no pride
Fat babies have no pride
And that's okay
Who needs pride

Fat babies make me sick
Fat babies make me ill
All that fat baby drooling
And that fat baby smell

I said I don't like hippies
And I don't like cornbread
And I don't like much
But I like you
'Cause you like me
And you don't like much
And that's okay

'Cause fat babies have no pride
Fat babies have no pride
Fat babies have no pride
And that's okay
Who needs pride anyway
