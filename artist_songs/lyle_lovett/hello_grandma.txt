Hello Grandma
How is your granddaughter
Hello Grandma
How is that little girl
I've been kind of out of touch
But I thought I would call her
Is she at home
Or is she around the world
Is she at home
Or is she around the world

Young man you must mean Kathy
ButI never heard her mention you
No ma'am I don't mean Kathy
I don't hardly even know her
Well Kathy's just fine
You know she's still going to school
But she'll be home Father's Day
To see her father

No Grandma
How's your other granddaughter
You know Grandma
How is that little girl
I've been kind of out of touch lately
But I did used to know her
Is she at home
Or is she around the world
Is she at home
Or is she around the world

Well young man you can't mean her
Why didn't you hear
She got married
And moved off to Chicago
Her husband's so handsome
And she just loves it up there
His family owns a newspaper
And an opulent disco

Grandma is this 924-8838
Yes young man it certainly is
That's the problem Grandma
I have made a mistake
I ain't called this number
In too many years
I ain't called this number
In too many years
