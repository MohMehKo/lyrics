See the shark with teeth like razors
You can read his open face
And Macheath, he's got a knife, and
In such an obvious place

On a beautiful blue Sunday,
See a corpse stretched in the Strand
See a man dodge 'round the corner...
Mackie's friends will understand.

Mr. Meier reported missing
Like so many wealthy men:
Mack the knife acquired his cashbox
God alone knows how or when

Jenny Towler, she turned up lately
With a knife stuck through her breast
While Macheath, he walks the embankment,
Nonchalantly unimpressed

And the ghastly fire in Soho,
Seven children at a go--
In the crowd stands Mac the knife, but
He isn't asked, he doesn't know

And the child bride in her nightgown,
Whose assailants still at large
Violated in her slumbers
Mackie how much did you charge?

Yes, the child bride in her nightgown
Whose assailants still at large
Violated in her slumbers
Mackie how much did you charge?

Mackie how much did you charge?
How much did you charge?
How much did you charge?
How much did you charge?
How much did you charge?
