My honey's name is Holly
Her daddy's name is Doyle
Her sister's name is Amy
And her mama's name is Iris
And her brother's name is John

They live in Nashville
They drive a Coupe DeVille
They all take little pills
On Saturday night

Life's great in Nashville
Driving in a Coupe DeVille
Thank God for little pills
On Saturday night

So adios to Holy
And adios to Doyle
And adios to Amy
And adios to Iris
And adios to John

They live in Nashville
They drive a Coupe DeVille
They all take little pills
On Saturday night

Life's great in Nashville
Driving in a Coupe DeVille
Thank God for little pills
On Saturday night
