Put it up
Put it up
Put it up 
Put it up
Put it up
Put it up oh, oh

Yeah
From clubs to the blocks
People wan’ do things
Don’t wanna be lusty
Eyes are on, pressure’s on
Guns don’t stop
The primitives dark and,
Plunge about nothing
It’s never done, never gone

But guess if I was for the strong
So just be what you want to be, to be
Ah yeah, ah yeah, ah yeah,

We are a renegade plus
Plus not into uh
Wanna be watching and pointing
Too busy guessing he’s calling
Not into huh
Ain’t saying anything,
Ain’t saying anything,
Yeah I’m a renegade
Plus
And only I, I can run this life
O-o-o-o-oh
Can’t price me, I’m priceless
So you can’t put no tags on me
Without me erupting

No key to unlock
I switch without warning
Roll ho I’m rolling
What I am, is who I am
Won’t hold back
Don’t expect no apology
If not I’m becoming
Understand, I’m keeping it moving

Cause if you can’t be yourself
You’re a shell
And can’t be anyone else
Could never be
Success is being who you are
You only!

We are a renegade plus
Plus, not into uh
Wanna be watching and pointing
Too busy guessing he’s calling
Not into huh
Ain’t saying anything,
Ain’t saying anything,
Yeah I’m a renegade
Plus
And only I, I can run this life
O-o-o-o-oh
Can’t price me, I’m priceless
So you can’t put no tags on me
Without me erupting, erupting, erupting

My light will keep on shining on
Do what feels right
To me, myself and I
What ever comes I’m standing strong
Reinventing everything I know
My light will keep on shining bright
Bring what I want, only I define
The rules of how I live my life
More time breaking,
As I’m rocking now
O-o-o-o-oh

So walk the way you’re walking now
Do your thing as you bless your trail
Yeah walk the way you walk
Let the eyes that see
Gon’ take you just the way you want tonight
And the only one to please is yourself,
Believe me, that’s what makes you a star

We are a renegade plus
And only I, I can run this life
O-o-o-o-oh
Can’t price me, I’m priceless
So you can’t put no tags on me
Without me erupting, erupting, erupting
Not watching anything that they’re saying
No, oh
Oh, decisions I’m the one who’s making
I’m me and there will be no faking
No, no-o-oh
So you can’t put no tags on me
Without me erupting, erupting, erupting
