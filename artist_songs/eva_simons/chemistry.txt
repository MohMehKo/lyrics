So long I've been waiting for someone that can satisfy my craving
You make me feel like, it's all amazing
The type of guy that's got my eyes gazing

Turn it up, turn it up
Baby give me some more
Yeah I want it, yeah, yeah I want it, want it
Turn it up, turn it up
Baby give me some more
Yeah I want it, yeah, yeah I want it, want it

Nothing in the air but the chemistry
You and me, you and me,
Nothing in the air but the chemistry
You and me got the chemistry

[beat break]

Oh no, let's not waste this
He coming from the fire that is blazing
We shouldn't be shy, the situation
Needs a doctor's phone cause I'm his patient

Turn it up, turn it up
Baby give me some more
Yeah I want it, yeah, yeah I want it, want it
Turn it up, turn it up
Baby give me some more
Yeah I want it, yeah, yeah I want it, want it

Nothing in the air but the chemistry
You and me, you and me,
Nothing in the air but the chemistry
You and me got the chemistry

[beat break]

You and me got the chemistry

I cant wait to do this bring it to me bring it to me
Make me dance all night
You cant wait to do this bring it to me bring it to me

Nothing in the air but the chemistry
You and me, you and me,
Nothing in the air but the chemistry
You and me got the chemistry

[beat break]

You and me got the chemistry
