Fade to the darkness all the way
At the start guess I hoped
That for once I had escaped the fakes, the snakes
Waste of time so face to face
I'll be bold enough to throw
All it is I've longed to say to say to say

If this is all but dissolved
It's dead and ended
I left all the reasons why
Why you should still be here
Go

Where did we go wrong?
I don't even like you now, like you
I'm not like you
You ain't what I want and
Time will never work this out

Oh no
I've gone cold
In the heart
Where did we go wrong?
I don't even like you now, forget you

Oh no
I've gone cold
In the heart
Where did we go wrong?
I don't even like you now, forget you
I don't like you

All the way

Sane
Not confused, clear in the brain
It's a losing handfold
Why play on nothing to gain
Pull on the raise

If this is all but dissolved
It's dead and ended
I left all the reasons why
You should even be here
Go

Oh no
I've gone cold
In the heart
Where did we go wrong?
I don't even like you now, forget you

Oh no
I've gone cold
In the heart
Where did we go wrong?
I don't even like you now, forget you
I don't like you

All the way

Done with crying
I just don't feel this
I'm not all over, it's dead
Through with trying
That's what the real is
This love has taken it's last breath

Where did we go wrong?
I don't even like you now, like you
I'm not like you
You ain't what I want and
Time will never work this out

Oh no
I've gone cold
In the heart
Where did we go wrong?
I don't even like you now, forget you

Oh no
I've gone cold
In the heart
Where did we go wrong?
I don't even like you now, forget you
I don't like you
