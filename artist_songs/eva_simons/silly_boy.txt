You're calling me more than ever now that we're done
Took keys back to my place, we were having no fun
But you're not okay tellin' me you miss my face
I remember when you would say you hate my ways

I said, "I'm not coming back"
It seems you only want what you can't have
That ego's hurting, just too bad for you
That when you had me you didn't know what to do
Game's over, you lose

'Cause you had a good girl, good girl
A girl, that's a keeper, a k-k-k-keeper, keeper
You had a good girl, good girl
But didn't know how to treat her, tr-tr-tr-tr-treat, treat her

So silly boy, get out my face, my face
Thought you liked the way green grass taste
Silly boy, get out my hair my hair
(Get out)
I don't want you no more, get out of here

You comin' with those corny lines, can't live without me
Well I'll get some flowers for the day that you are buried
Know people make mistakes but I just think your ass is fake
Only thing I want from you is for you to stay away

'Cause you had a good girl, good girl
A girl, that's a keeper, a k-k-k-keeper, keeper
You had a good girl, good girl
But didn't know how to treat her, tr-tr-tr-tr-treat, treat her
