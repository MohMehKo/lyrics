You’ve got my attention
The moment you mentioned
The music you like
I feel the attraction
Your eyes are a reflection
Of your heart

What if this is something?
What if it’s the real thing?
Baby you know we’ve got to give it away
Maybe it’s the first time
Maybe it’s the last time
I know you feel it, you know we’ve got to give it away!

[CHORUS:]
We dance all night living in the moment
We keep our eyes, open on the road
We live this life ready in for more
We don’t look back living in the moment

[CHORUS:]
We dance all night living in the moment
We keep our eyes, open on the road
We live this life ready in for more
We don’t look back living in the moment

Junkies and rabbits,
But didn’t they tell you
That tricks are for kids
Teenage dream but we don’t need drama
We’re not stuck in a soap opera

What if this is something?
What if it’s the real thing?
Baby you know we’ve got to give it away
Maybe it’s the first time
Maybe it’s the last time
I know you feel it, you know we’ve got to give it away!

[CHORUS:]
We dance all night living in the moment
We keep our eyes, open on the road
We live this life ready in for more
We don’t look back living in the moment

[CHORUS:]
We dance all night living in the moment
We keep our eyes, open on the road
We live this life ready in for more
We don’t look back living in the moment

We’re up in the sky,
We’re up all night
We’re up in the sky,
We’re up all night

[CHORUS:]
We dance all night living in the moment
We keep our eyes, open on the road
We live this life ready in for more
We don’t look back living in the moment

[CHORUS:]
We dance all night living in the moment
We keep our eyes, open on the road
We live this life ready in for more
We don’t look back living in the moment
