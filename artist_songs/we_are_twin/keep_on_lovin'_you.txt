[Verse 1]
I found myself walking on the edge of the road
but I can't no I won't let you go no!
Everything inside is telling me to single you out
But I can't, no I won't, oh not yet
Gonna have to find another place to rest my head
but there's no other place to go no!
If you wanna try baby to give it a go
That's ok by me yeah!

The sun will never set again
Joy will never end
Will you be my friend?

[Chorus]
No matter where you go
You should always know
I'm gonna keep on lovin', keep on lovin' you
Keep on lovin', keep on lovin' you

[Verse 2]
Take it from me I know how it goes when you
Find the one that you want, that you need yeah
Believe me that's the same question I've been asking myself
Why we need someone to hold yeah!
If you wanna try baby to give it a go
That's okay by me yeah

[Chorus]
No matter where you go
You should always know
I'm gonna keep on lovin', keep on lovin' you
Keep on lovin', keep on lovin' you
The sun will never set again
Joy will never end
Will you be my friend?
I will never be the same, since you know my name
I'm in love again

[Outro]
Beautiful bless your soul
Won't you come and take me home
Beautiful kiss my soul won't you come and take me home
Beautiful kiss my soul won't you come and take me home
