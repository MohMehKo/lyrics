I've got my hands
around your neck,
my lips up on your chest
You love it how I need you boy,
oh dare I say the rest
The people they can stare, I don't mind it, I don't care
as long as we together we got love extraordinary 

When we were by the ocean
and you turned to me to say
Girl don't you ever go
and try to change
no matter what anybody says
If you would be my best friend,
than I would build a home
Where the both of us
can live alone,
where you can
grow into your own.

You'd be the best that I ever hoped for
I love it how I can't resist the way you are
The way we touch
If we are a match, I'd give you everything I longed for
I love it how I can't resist the way you are, the way we touch

You got on a hook, 
from the moment you said baby
If I faint from over heating call the martial Mr. Davy
I'm running out of breath, I feel it in my head
I can't go on without you boy, let's hit the road to live

If you would be my hero,
than I would be your girl
You could have me
anytime you want
Even early in the morning sun
I only have my chevy
and the keys to my heart
oh, take me for a ride
to the moon
I forget the world
when I'm with you

You'd be the best that I ever hoped for
I love it how I can't resist the way you are
The way we touch
If we are a match, I'd give you everything I longed for
I love it how I can't resist the way you are, 
The way we touch
