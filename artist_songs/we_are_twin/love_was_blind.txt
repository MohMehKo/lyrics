Lover's arms are sweet divine
I was yours, you were mine
Love was blind

Hold me tight as I melt
I know then that you are the best thing I've ever felt
Don't make things harder
Don't you know?
I'm on your side
You know I tell you all the time
I was yours
Oh, love was blind
We gave it all
We gave it all
We gave it all

Can't you see it in my eyes?
Boy I tell you that you're always on my mind
A love like you is hard to find
Thought I loved you all my life

Don't make things harder
Don't make things harder

Don't you know?
I'm on your side
You know I tell you all the time
I was yours
Oh, love was blind
We gave it all
We gave it all
We gave it all

Love not can do it keep it away
Your love is got me a make stars
How can you make me feel this way
Did are you give me there get me so high up
Love not can do it keep it away
Your love is got me a make stars
How can you make me feel this way
Did are you give me there get me so high up
So high up

Don't you know?
I mine your style
You're now I tell you all the time
I was yours
Her love was blind
We've give it all
We've give it all
We've give it all
