Your name is written on my heart
But you keep me tappin' in the dark
Through all the crazy things we see
There's not thing that can come between
You and I
We both survive in a world on fire
How you like me now?
I know you better hold me down

You are my number one
You are my number one
You are my number one
You are my number one

All I needed was a little bit of xtra love (xtra love)
An xtra touch (xtra touch)
All I needed was a little bit of xtra love (xtra love)
An xtra touch (xtra touch)

Oh baby come close to me
Oh baby come close to me
Oh baby come close to me
Oh baby come close to me

You are the only one I see
Won't you come keep me company
You let your eyes see what they want
It gets me deep and lights a spark
Inside my heart, it never stops
You take me higher
I can see the light
When it's only you and I

You are my number one
You are my number one
You are my number one
You are my number one

All you really need is a little bit of xtra love (xtra love)
An xtra touch (xtra touch)
All you really need is a little bit of xtra love (xtra love)
An xtra touch (xtra touch)

Oh baby come close to me
Oh baby come close to me
Oh baby come close to me
Oh baby come close to me
[x2]

Oh baby come close to me
Oh baby come close to me
Oh baby come close to me
Oh baby come close to me

All we really need is a little bit of xtra love (xtra love)
An xtra touch (xtra touch)
All we really need is a little bit of xtra love (xtra love)
An xtra touch (xtra touch)
