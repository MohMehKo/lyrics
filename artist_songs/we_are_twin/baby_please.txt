I can see by the way that you look in your eyes
People talkin to me but I'm up in the skies
You're so fine
You know I live in the moment
I live for the thrills
& the way that you hold me
is giving me chills
It kills me every way

Baby please catch me if you can
I'm gonna follow my beat
I want to be free

Please I'm in love with you
I'm going to follow my way
Come along with me

You know I tell you I wish
I could call you mine
But we find ourselves running against time
It's time for me to pack up my things and get on the road
I told you late last night after the show
I have to go

Baby please catch me if you can
I'm gonna follow my beat
I want to be free

Please I'm in love with you
I'm going to follow my way
Come along with me

I believe in wonderland
I believe
I believe in wonderland
Yeah
Yeah

Baby please catch me if you can
I'm gonna follow my beat
I want to be free

Please I'm in love with you
I'm going to follow my way
Come along with me
Follow my thing
Yeah
Please
Come along with me
