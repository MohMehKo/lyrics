[Verse 1]
She got coldstone lips
With his heart in her hand
She laid him out flat cold, as they lay in the sand
Took him by surprise that she roll that way
Look and stare
Couldn't turn her away
Not for a wad of dough or a lady in lace
She's a different kind of a wild stallion

[Pre-Chorus]
Look at me
If you want it, want it
I believe, believe
It's all been said and done for me
If you want it, want it
I believe, believe it's all been said and done

[Chorus]
If this is what you're waiting for
I believe we're turning into something beautiful
And it's getting better
Day to day, from day to day, from day to day, day to day
I believe it, day to day, from day to day, from day to day, from day to day

[Verse 2]
She got coldstone lips that'll take him away
After just one kiss, he don't feel the same
Took him by surprise he could feel that way
It was her first time, she saw that look on his face
That he ain't playing around that it's not just a game
He don't wanna share with another man

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
