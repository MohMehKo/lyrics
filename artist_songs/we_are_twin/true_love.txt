[Verse 1]
I just can't sleep without you boy
A full set of stars are out tonight
I wear my heart out on my sleeve
I put it there for you to see

[Pre-Chorus]
And we just keep on hurting
Keep on burnin' through
And we just barely made it through
Through we thought we were through
But what we need is

[Chorus]
True love
Keeps us going
True love
Keeps me turning
True love
Keeps me going on and on...

[Verse 2]
Go on take me for a ride
There's no one else but you tonight
I can barely hear the words you say
The way your eyes speak for themselves

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
