Go on baby
You know you got a something
The kinda thing in my life
I've been needing
Yeah I know you're so fine
Hot in the summertime
Oh yeah
One or two ways to do this
You get to know me better on our first kiss
Yeah if only you could remind
Just read between the lines
Oh yeah

(It's only you and I)
Hands up in the sky
It's only you and I
Birds are running wild
Running in the sun

There's no need for us to rush this
It's been real cool since our first kiss
You can say what comes to mind
Baby just take your time
Oh yeah
I can't get you off of my mind
It gets worse every time I try to fight
This is something I can't resist
Your lips and your tenderness
Oh yeah

Hands up in the sky
It's only you and I
Birds are running wild
Running in the sun

(Kiss me like a sunset)
Running in the sun
(Kiss me like a sunset)
Running in the sun
(Kiss me like a sunset)
Running in the sun
(Kiss me like a sunset)

Hands up in the sky
It's only you and I
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Hands up in the sky
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
I can't get you off my mind

Hands up in the sky
It's only you and I
(It's only you and I)
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
I can't get you off mind

Hands up in the sky
It's only you and I
Birds are running wild...
