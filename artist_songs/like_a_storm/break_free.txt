Help me
I've fallen further in myself
I'm stuck here again
And I can't see
That I'm not digging my way out
I'm digging my grave.

I've become my own demise
Paralyzed inside my mind
Arms are weak from holding up this front
No escape and no surprises
Complicated compromises
Hold me down
When what all I really want

Break free, break free, break free
From everything
Break free
Before it breaks me
There's got to be another way
Start again.

Tell me
How you can be the brighter star
That light up the sky
Well I can't seem
To even light up my own place
And I've burned out from trying

I've become what I despise
Paralyzed inside a lie
Arms are weak from holding back the flood
Sinking as the waters rise
Drink myself to sleep each night
I'm going under
And all I really want

Break free, break free, break free
From everything
Break free
Before it breaks me
There's got to be another way

Start again

No
Going under
I all I really want
Break free

Break free
Before it breaks me
There's got to be another way

Start again
Start again
Start again
There's got be another way.

Start again
Start again
Start again
Start again
