I need you like a bullet in the head
Bullet in the head

You're like a beautiful sickness
You're like a knife against my wrist
Each breath I suffocate in you
You're like the voice of my madness
You're like a noose around my neck
Each breath I suffocate in you

How many nights I lie awake?
How many days until I break?
How many lies are left to say?
All for nothing!

I want (You) (Like a bullet in the head!)
I need (You) (Like a bullet in the head!)
I feel you under my skin
(I need you) (Like a bullet in the head!)

Your strength relies on my weakness
Your will desires my death wish
Each breath I suffocate in you

How many nights I lie awake?
How many days until I break?
How many lies are left to say?
All for nothing!

I want (You) (Like a bullet in the head!)
I need (You) (Like a bullet in the head!)
I feel you under my skin
(I need you) (Like a bullet in the...)

Like a bullet in the head!
Head!
I need you!

Like a moth into the flame
I'm trying to kill the pain
Always I'll remain
All for nothing

I want (You) (Like a bullet in the head!)
I need (You) (Like a bullet in the head!)
I feel you under my skin
(I need you) (Like a noose round my neck)
I want (You) Like a moth into the flame
I need (You) I'm trying to kill the pain
I feel you under my skin
(I need you)

Like a bullet in the head!
Bullet in the head!
