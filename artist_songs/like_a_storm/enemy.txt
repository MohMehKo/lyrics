(HEY HEY) You've become
The enemy
(HEY HEY) You've become
The enemy

People always say
That nothing last forever
Never thought the day would come
When you would turn on me
I can't be the savior
Holding this together
I can't be the life line
When you will be the death of me

You've become the enemy
You won't be the end of me
You've become the enemy
Stole my soul

It's like you died
Before you were born
You're like Jesus Christ
With devil's horns
Sucking me down in your black hole
Give back the life, the life you stole

Drowning in a sea of
Self - annihilation
I threw you a rope
When you were calling out to me
But I can't be the savior
Holding this together
I can't be the life line
When you will be the death of me

You've become the enemy
Stole my soul

I always thought that you would be
The one who'd never turn on me
But thought it all. Now I see
You've become the enemy

You've become the enemy
You won't be the end of me
You've become the enemy
Give back the life, the life you stole
