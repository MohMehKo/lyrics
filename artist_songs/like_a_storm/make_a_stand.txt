You carry on like nothing's wrong
But the pain is never gone
Long enough to move along

You got an anger deep within
Buried under broken skin
It holds you back to hold it in

But wait, something in the air is calling
And way up above the stars are forming
So wake from your solitary grave
To burn out's better than to fade away

Stand if you're bored of being abused
Stand if you're sick of being refused

Don't sacrifice what you believe
Don't deny your hopes and dreams
Or tomorrow's just what could have been

Now it's time to make a stand
Middle finger with both hands
Don't give in to their demands

But wait, something in the air is calling

And way up above the stars are forming
So wake, from your solitary grave
To burn out's better than to fade away

Stand if you're bored of being abused
Stand if you're sick of being refused
Stand if you're tired of feeling used
Stand cause there's nothing left to lose
It's in your hands, make a stand

If you been abused,
You've been refused
You're feeling used
There's nothing to lose
If you've been abused
You've been refused
You're feeling used
There's nothing to lose
Make a stand

Make a stand
