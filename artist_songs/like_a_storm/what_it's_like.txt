I never thought you were someone
To prey on the weak
I never thought I was someone
You'd kick in the teeth
(Now I know)
I get the hurt, I get the blame
You rub the dirt across my name
When you fall from your cross and you're down on your knees
Then you'll know what it's like
What it's like to be me

You don't know what it's like
What it's like to be me
You don't know what it's like
What it's like to be me
You don't know what it's like
To be down on your knees
What it's like
What it's like
What it's like to be

Hold me down like I'm not worth
The air that you breathe
Beat me down to the ground you're
Too proud to let me stand beside
You on my feet

You don't know what it's like
What it's like to be me
You don't know what it's like
What it's like to be me

You don't know what it's like
To be down on your knees
What it's like
What it's like
What it's like to be

Yeah, yeah
Beat down again and again
What it's like to be
Yeah, yeah
Beat down again and again

You smothered me for so long
I'm buried in all your blame
I get the hurt, I get the pain
You rub the dirt across my name
You've shadowed me for so long
I'm covered in all your shame
I get the hurt, I get the pain
You rub the dirt across my name
Despite all the thing you've done
You'll never bring me down again

Yeah, yeah
Beat down again and again
What it's like to be
Yeah, yeah
Beat down again and again
