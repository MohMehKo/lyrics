Take another shot at me
I love the way you hate me

I don't care if I'm not good enough for you
I don't care if I don't live the lie you want me to
I don't care what you wanna think of me

Cause all you are is everything that I don't wanna to be

[Chorus:]
You say I'm a freak
I say I am free
Come take a shot at me
I love the way you hate me

You say I'm insane
I say you're afraid
I get stronger from the pain
I love the way you hate me

Take another shot at me
I love the way you hate me

You think I'm nothing
Cause I'm nothing like you
You think you know me
You have no idea what I've been through
So take a shot
Say what you want about me

All you are is everything that I will never be
(Fake)

[Chorus:]
You say I'm a freak
I say I am free
Come take a shot at me
I love the way you hate me

You say I'm insane
I say you're afraid
I get stronger from the pain
I love the way you hate me

I'd rather be a sinner than a slave
I'd rather be an outcast than just bow down and obey
When it's all done there's only one name upon my grave
I'd rather be a freak than be a fake

Tell me I'm a freak
Tell me I'm a creep
Tell me I'm obscene
Hate me

You say I'm insane
I say you're afraid
I get stronger from the pain
I love the way you hate me
I love the way you hate me
(I don't care)
I love the way you hate me
Hate me
