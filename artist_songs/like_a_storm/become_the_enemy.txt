You've become the enemy

I hate you for what you've become 
I hate you, you know what you've done
You can’t look me in the eye but I want you to see
I won't be your lifeline when you will be the death of me

You've become the enemy 
But you won't be the end of me
You've become the enemy
(You stole my soul)

It’s like you died before you were born
You're like Jesus Christ with devil's horns
Sucking me down in your black hole
Give back the life, the life you stole

I hate you for what you've become
How you live with the things that you've done
So look me in the eye ‘cause I want you to see
I won't be your lifeline when you will be the death of me

You've become the enemy 
But you won't be the end of me
You've become the enemy
(You stole my soul)

It’s like you died before you were born
You're like Jesus Christ with devil's horns
Sucking me down in your black hole
Give back the life, the life you stole

It’s like you died before you were born 
You're like Jesus Christ with devil's horns
Sucking me down in your black hole
Give back the life, the life you stole

You've become the enemy 
But you won't be the end of me
You've become the enemy
Give back the life, the life you stole
