Got a bitter taste, in a bitter place
When you lie to me again
Written on your face, and it won't erase
When you lie to me, lie to me, lie to me

Got a bitter taste, in a bitter place
When you lie to me again and again
Written on your face and it won't erase
When you lie to me, lie to me

There must be something
You're hiding from me
In your eyes, I see the truth
Give me something cos I got nothing
Yeah, I got nothing left for you

When you say
Nothing's gonna come between us
Nothing's gonna fall to pieces
I don't know if I believe it
When you say
Nothing's gonna change tomorrow
You're the one that brings me sorrow
Nothing's ever what it seems
Don't lie to me

Going out of my mind, can't leave you behind
When you lie to me again and again
Look my straight in the eye everytime you deny
Yeah you lie to me, lie to me

There must be something
You're hiding from me
In your eyes, I see the truth
Give me something cos I got nothing

Yeah, I got nothing left for you

When you say
Nothing's gonna come between us
Nothing's gonna fall to pieces
I don't know if I believe it
When you say
Nothing's gonna change tomorrow
You're the one that brings me sorrow
Nothing's ever what it seems
Don't lie to me

Don't lie to me
Don't lie to me

Give me something cos I got nothing
I got nothing, nothing, nothing

Nothing's gonna come between
Nothing's gonna fall to pieces
I don't know if I believe it
When you say
Nothing's gonna change tomorrow
You're the one that brings me sorrow
Nothing's ever what it seems

I know you lied to me
No, you can't hide from
I know you lied
Don't lie to me

Don't lie to me
