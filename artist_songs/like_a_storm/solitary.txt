Prisoner to myself again

I've been separated
I've been isolated
Trapped inside this hole inside of me
I've been segregated
By walls I created
Locked inside this cage inside of me

All the days that've come and passed
They're never ever coming back
All the days that've come and passed
They're never ever coming back

Prisoner to myself again
'Cause there's no way to escape it
No way I can break it
Prisoner to myself again
I'm my own worst enemy
Alone in solitary

I've lost all direction
I've lost all perception
Stranded at the edge of sanity

All the days that've come and passed
They're never ever coming back
All the days that've come and passed
They're never ever coming back

Prisoner to myself again
'Cause there's no way to escape it
No way I can break it
Prisoner to myself again
I'm my own worst enemy
Alone in solitary

And I wonder
How far can I sink inside myself
Until I'm here no more

Prisoner to myself again
'Cause there's no way to escape it
No way I can break it
Prisoner to myself again
I'm my own worst enemy
Alone in solitary

I've been separated
I've been isolated
Trapped inside...
Alone in solitary
I've been segregated
By walls I created
I'm my own worst enemy
Alone in solitary
