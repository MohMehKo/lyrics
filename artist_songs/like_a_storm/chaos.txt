Each day is a war
A fight we must face
Our backs to the wall
Our hands bound and tied, our feet in the grave

Sometimes I feel it’s what kills me inside
Sometimes I feel it’s what keeps me alive

So take the world that you hate, the pain that you face
‘Cause only the strong will survive
Break the cage of your life, awaken the fire inside
Let the chaos bring you to life

The deeper we fall
The higher we soar
The scars show us all
We will survive, when we can’t take anymore

Sometimes I feel it’s what kills me inside
Sometimes I feel it’s what keeps me alive

So take the world that you hate, the pain that you face
‘Cause only the strong will survive
Break the cage of your life, awaken the fire inside
Let the chaos bring you to life

Drain the world ‘til it’s all gone [x5]

Drain the world ‘til we all go down

Awaken the fire inside

Take the world that you hate, the pain that you face
‘Cause only the strong will survive
Break the cage of your life, awaken the fire inside
Let the chaos bring you to life
