Can you hear my voice
Where you are?
When I'm without you
Every moment falls apart
I'm a burned out light in the dark
In my empty shell I am calling out

I've lost my faith,
Lost my way
It's all so far away

What have I become?
Can't face the morning sun
Just save me
You're the only one
Who can pull me out
Save me from myself
Just save me
Just save me

Pull me closer to you
I can't escape this
Emptiness I fell into
Caught in a shadow
I can't see through
I'm nothing without you

What have I become?
Can't face the morning sun
Just save me
You're the only one
Who can pull me out

Save me from myself
Just save me
Just save me

Lost my faith
Lost my way
I need to feel you here again
Just save me

From what I've become
Look what I've become

I bleed for you
I bleed for you 
I bleed for you

What have I become?
Just save me
Can't face the morning sun
Just save me
Now I'm screaming out
Save me from myself 

What have I become?
You're the only one
Who can pull me out
Save me from myself
Just save me
Just save me
