I watched the colors fade in you
Saw the shadow take control
And the world that we once knew
I watched it crumble and fall
I can't believe that it's over
So many things I should have done
The world is so much colder
Without the sun
Now I am nothing
And nothing can heal the pain
Of this empty feeling
Without you nothing remains
Nothing remains
It's like I died right there with you
I lost everything that day
When this life I thought I knew
Was ripped out and taken from me
(Falling)
I keep living it over
(Falling)
I don't know what I could have done
(Falling)
And still my world grows colder
Without your sun
Now I am nothing
And nothing can heal the pain
Of this empty feeling
Nothing can take it away
And now I have nothing
Since you were taken from me
I'm nothing without you
Without you nothing remains
Nothing
Nothing
I'm nothing without
Without you nothing remains
Nothing remains
Nothing remains
Nothing remains
