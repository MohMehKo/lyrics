You never felt so out of luck
Nothing ever felt this rough
You feel one step away from giving up
Your world's come crashing to the floor
You wonder what you're fighting for
To see the end,
There's nothing you want more

Don't cry when you feel like
They're all after you
Don't cry when the drugs
Won't get you high
Don't cry when there's nothing left
To get you through
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry

You never feel you're good enough
You never heal when you've been cut
You hide away and lie awake in fear
Cause it takes everything you've got
To turn and face another shot
And take another bullet
In the mask you wear

Don't cry when you feel like
They're all after you

Don't cry when the drugs
Won't get you high
Don't cry when there's nothing left
To get you through
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry

Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry

When your walls are caving in
When they never let you win
You're alive, you're alive, you're alive
When you're standing in the dark
When the world tears you apart,
Don't cry, you're alive, you're alive

Don't cry when you feel like
They're all after you
Don't cry, just wash away your eyes
Don't cry, don't let them get
The best of you
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry
