I don't know the face
When I look in the mirror
You're the only one
That can make things clearer

I've got a chemical infatuation
A chemical addiction to you
You're the only one
That gets me through
I'm a slave to you

Hooked on the taste
Of you beautiful pill
(Lost my soul, lost my soul)
There's an emptiness
That only you can fill

I've got a chemical infatuation
A chemical addiction to you
You're the only one
That gets me through
I'm a slave to you
(I'm a slave to you)

All alone, I fade to nothing
All alone, I fell in you
All alone, I hear you calling
All along, I've needed you

I've got a chemical infatuation
A chemical addiction to you
Adrenaline intoxication
I've lost myself in you
Chemical infatuation
I've given everything to you
You're the only one
That gets me, the only one
That gets me
You're the only one
That gets me through
I'm a slave to you

All alone, I fade to nothing
All along, I've needed you
