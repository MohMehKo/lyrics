Wipe that smile off your face
You immaculate disgrace
'Cause heaven knows
A prayer won't save you now

You wear the halo of a saint
To hide the venom of a snake
Built your kingdom on a lie
So watch it all come crashing down now

You prophet of hate
You profit from faith
Truth-less, two-faced, two bit
Fuckin' hypocrite

How does it feel?
How does it feel?
The day has come
To pay for what you've done
Sinner revealed
Tell me how does it feel?
So pure within your soul
Pure evil

If your blackened heart believes
In the righteous words you speak
You know heaven will send hell for you
And bring you to your knees

You prophet of hate
You profit from faith
Truth-less, two-faced, two bit
Fuckin' hypocrite

How does it feel?
How does it feel?
The day has come
To pay for what you've done
Sinner revealed
Tell me how does it feel?
So pure within your soul
Pure evil

So pray to your god
Pray for your soul
Pray as your throne burns slowly
Pray to your god
Pray for your soul
Pray as your throne burns slowly now

How does it feel
How does it feel?
The day has come
To pay for what you've done
Sinner revealed
Tell me how does it feel?
Truthless, two-faced, two bit
Fuckin' hypocrite
How does it feel
Tell me how does it feel?
So pure within your soul
Pure evil

The day has come
To pay for what you've done
Pay for what you've done
What you've done, what you've done
