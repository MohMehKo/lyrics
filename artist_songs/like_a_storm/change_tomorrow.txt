For the first time in years
There's a light up ahead
It's calling
(It's pulling me closer)
Reborn within
Now I'm shedding my skin
It's falling
(The weight off my shoulders)

Cos I can't stay
Chained to my secrets.
No I can't stay.
I'm bound by my regrets.
I can't erase
All of my errors;
Those days are gone forever

I can change, I can 
Change tomorrow
I can change, I can 
Change tomorrow

On my knees in the rain
With my head hung in shame
Just crawling, stalling
(All alone in my ways)
Memories I can't erase
Faces I couldn't face
Haunt me
(My life lay to waste)

Cause I can't stay

Chained to my secrets.
No I can't stay.
I'm bound by my regrets.
I need a break,
It's now or never.
Yesterday's gone forever

I can change, I can 
Change tomorrow
I can change, I can 
Change tomorrow

For all the years of emptiness
For all of my mistakes
For all the years I've
Thrown it all away
It's not too late

For all the years I've thrown it all away
(Those days are gone forever)
I can change, I can
Change tomorrow
(For all of my mistakes)
I can change,
I can change,
I can change
Before it's too late

It's not too late
