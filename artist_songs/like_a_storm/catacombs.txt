Trapped down inside of me
In catacombs of blackened dreams
Cages of memories
Whispers of what could've been

I try to find a way
Just to see the light of day
But these halls have no escape
And I'm running

Set me free, awaken me
From the cemetery of memories
Yesterday's ghost, is all I know
Pulling me from the shadows 'cause I...
Can't let go, buried in the catacombs
I can't let go, I'm buried in the catacombs
Alone!

Trapped down inside again
The walls around me closing in
This cage of suffering
Buried underneath my skin

I try to find a way
Just to see the light of day
These halls have no escape
And I'm running away

Set me free, awaken me
From the cemetery of memories
Yesterday's ghost, is all I know
Pulling me from the shadows 'cause I...
Can't let go, buried in the catacombs
I can't let go, I'm buried in the catacombs
Alone!

Am I sinking and drowning?
(Alone)
In the walls that surround me
(Below)
These halls have no escape
And I'm running away
Away!

Set me free, awaken me
From the cemetery of memories
Yesterday's ghost, is all I know
Pulling me from the shadows 'cause I...
Can't let go, buried in the catacombs
I can't let go, I'm buried in the catacombs
Alone!
