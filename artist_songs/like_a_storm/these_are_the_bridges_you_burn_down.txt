Here we go

There is a river that runs so deep
And betrayal always lies beneath
There's no forgiving your hypocrisy
You stood for nothing now you fall to your knees

Calling you, calling you
Can you feel it coming down?
The walls you built to keep them out
Calling you, calling you
Can you hear them coming now?
They line up just to watch you drown

These are the bridges you burned down
These are the bridges that you burned down
These are the bridges you burned down
These are the bridges that bring you down

Think you're untouchable to the hands beneath
The sky is falling underneath your feet
But you are nothing at all, and nothing's all you'll be
You're not the cure you're just a fucking disease

Calling you, calling you
Can you feel it coming down?
The walls you built to keep them out
Calling you, calling you
Can you hear them coming now?
They line up just to watch you drown

These are the bridges you burned down
These are the bridges that you burned down
These are the bridges you burned down
These are the bridges that bring you down

From ash to ash, from dust to dust
There's no way back from what you've become
From ash to ash, from dust to dust
There's no way back from what you've become

These are the bridges you burned down
These are the bridges that you burned down
These are the bridges you burned down
These are the bridges that bring you down
These are the bridges you burned down
These are the bridges you burned down
These are the bridges you burned down
These are the bridges that bring you down
