Autumn leaves are fading
Another year of my life passing me by
So long I have waited 
For a taste of the life I thought would be mine 

Just show me where to go 
This place is all I know

Feeling like a change
I'm sick of watching all the colors fade
They're so ordinary
I need to get away 
'Cause I don't want to waste another day
So ordinary

Every morning waking
Opening my eyes to the longing I feel inside
Watch the hours fading
Like the dreams in my mind that wither and die with time

Feeling like a change
I'm sick of watching all the colors fade
They're so ordinary
I need to get away 
'Cause I don't want to waste another day
So ordinary

Can't find an open door
Crack in the city wall
A way to reach the air outside
'Cause all I'm searching for 
Is just a way to feel alive
Oh, God, I need to feel alive

God I need to feel alive

Feeling like a change
I'm sick of watching all the colors fade
They're so ordinary
I need to get away 
'Cause I don't want to waste another day
So ordinary

Just show me where to go
This place is all I know
