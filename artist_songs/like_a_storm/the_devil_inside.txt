Make me believe I'm human
Make me believe I'm not the voice in my mind
I don't believe all the wrong I've done is forgiven
Make me believe I'm living
Make me believe I'm not the face that I hide
I don't believe another day I can breathe so forsaken

Can you see my disease
Can not hide what's inside

I'm moving paralyzed
And living hypnotized
Hit right between the eyes
Living with the Devil inside

Can you see my disease
Meet the Devil inside of me

Is this the fate I've been given
I hear it calling in the dead of the night
I don't believe I can ever be free
Of this hell that lives inside of me

Can you see my disease
Can not hide what's inside

I'm moving paralyzed
And living hypnotized
Hit right between the eyes
Living with the Devil inside

See the face inside
Look me in the eye and see the face inside
Look me in the eye and see the face I hide

I'm moving paralyzed
And living hypnotized
Hit right between the eyes
Living with the Devil inside

Look me in the eye and see the face inside
Look me in the eye and see the face I hide
