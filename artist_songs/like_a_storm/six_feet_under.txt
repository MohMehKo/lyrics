Look into my eyes
And see the fire inside of me
I've come to far to die
Like a forgotten memory
You think I'll fade away
One foot in the grave
But I will rise again
You won't bury me
You won't bury me
I am free
I will be I vow
I'm not dead and gone
I will carry on
With no fear
I am here I am now
I'm not going down
Six feet underground
You kissed me when I fell
Thought you had seen the last of me
Fought my way back from hell
So don't expect my eulogy
You think I'll fade away
But a single flame
Ignites the fire again
You won't bury me
You won't bury me
I am free
I will be I vow
I'm dead and gone
I will carry on
With no fear
I am here I am now
I'm not going down
Six feet underground
(Get up)
Get up!
You think I will fade away
One foot in the grave
Look into my eyes
You won't bury me
You won't bury me
I am free
I will be I vow
I'm not dead and gone
I will carry on
With no fear I am here
When you feel that
I am here anew
I'm not going down
Six feet underground
I will not go down
Six feet underground
