I blame myself for this world I've created
In this place I have waited and faded
I have suffered for all I believed in
Just to see it all fall to pieces
Just breathe it in
The bitter taste of it all gone to waste
Just breathe it in
The bitter taste of the truth that we face

It's so complicated (Nothing to say)
When all we are is faded (Slipping away)
It's complicated (Words only betray)
Tell me is this all that we are?
Stitches and scars
Stitches and scars

I blame myself for this world I've created
Suffocated by all that I've made it
I have seen right through all I believed in
Just to see it all fall to pieces
Just breathe it in
The bitter taste of it all gone to waste
Just breathe it in
The bitter taste of the truth that we face

It's so complicated (Nothing to say)
When all we are is faded (Slipping away)
It's complicated (Words only betray)
Tell me is this all that we are?
(Stitches and scars)

Face it, we're breaking it
Face it, we're breaking apart

The bitter taste of the truth that we face

It's so complicated (Nothing to say)
When all we are is faded (Slipping away)
It's complicated (Words only betray)
Tell me is this all that we are?
Stitches and scars
Stitches and scars

Face it, we're breaking it
Face it, we're breaking apart
