Got a lesion deep inside
An abrasion I can't bind
And the bleeding comes to life
Whenever I see you

Living only to survive
With the wound you left behind
All the feelings come to life
Whenever I see you

And I thought I would
Heal in time
And I thought I could
Leave you behind

I, I remember
And I, I surrender
When I try to heal up inside
I remember,
I still remember
You keep the pain alive
You keep the pain alive

You're the one that I adored
The reddest rose, the sharpest thorns
You need me less, I need you more
And I can't make it through
When I thought I could
Get over you

I, I remember
And I, I surrender

When I try to heal up inside
I remember,
I still remember
You keep the pain alive
You keep the pain alive

You keep the pain alive
Without you, I'm falling
It's your name
I'm calling
Hands of time
Won't pull me through
I remember,
I still remember
Whenever I see you

I see you

When I thought I would heal in time
When I thought I could leave you behind
The scar's always there to remind
I remember,
I remember,
I still remember

I still remember
I remember,
I remember
