It takes one strike to light the match
It takes one match to light the flame
And it takes one flame to light the fire
Defy, and set the world on fire
Light it!

In your father's eyes I'm nothing
In your mother's eyes I'm gone
In this world I'm unforgiven for
The things that I have done
(Things that I have done)

Tonight I'm gonna set the world on fire
Tonight I'm going to live before I die
Light the sky and watch it fall
(I'll take it all)

Out of control (Whoa-oh)
Out of control (Whoa-oh)
I'm out of control (Whoa-oh)
And I'm taking it all
Defy, set the world on fire
Light it!

And I'll bite the hand that feeds me
When the hand is just a fist
I won't suffer for a broken world
That never gave a shit (about me)

Tonight I'm gonna set the world on fire
Tonight I'm gonna live before I die
Light the sky and watch it fall

I'm out of control (Whoa-oh)
Out of control (Whoa-oh)
I'm out of control (Whoa-oh)
And I'm taking it all
Defy, set the world on fire

Am I supposed to drown
The voice inside my head?
Am I suppose to bow
Until I break my neck?
Step back in line?
Just fade in time?
In my heart I'm already dead

One strike to light the match
One match to light the flame
One flame to light the fire
And set the world ablaze
(Let it burn!) One strike to light the match
(Let it burn!) One match to light the flame
(Let it burn!) One flame to light the fire
Set this fucking world ablaze!

Out of control (Whoa-oh)
Out of control (Whoa-oh)
I'm out of control (Whoa-oh)
And I'm taking it all
Defy, set the world on fire
Let it burn!
