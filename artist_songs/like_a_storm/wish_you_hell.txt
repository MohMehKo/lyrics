Take that knife out of my spine 
And you'll know you got the best of me 
For the last time 
Save your precious little lies 
I won't waste another moment in the wake of your demise

So long, you ripped my heart away 
Walk on, oh lord, I wish you hell
I wish you hell, walk on out
So long I wish you hell
So long I wish you hell
You ripped my heart away
Oh lord, I wish you hell
You ripped my heart away (Oh yeah)
Oh lord, I wish you...

Take one minute of your time
Look at the wreckage of the ones you've left behind
Face one lesson a lesson never learned
You're gonna get what you deserve

I wish you hell
I wish you hell, walk on out
So long I wish you hell
So long, I wish you...

You ripped my heart away 
Oh lord, I wish you hell

You ripped my heart away 
Oh lord, 

I wish you hell
I wish you hell, walk on out (walk on)
Like you do so well
So long I wish you hell
So long, I wish you...
