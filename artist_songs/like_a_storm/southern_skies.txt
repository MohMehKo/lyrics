Set my compass home
And find the footsteps I'll retrace
Cause everywhere I go
Brings me closer to this place
Cause everything I'm looking for
Is right back here where I belong
And everything I thought I'd lost
I found beneath this southern cross

Cause I've done a lot of wrong trying to make it right
Regretted every last goodbye
But anything is possible here tonight
Underneath these southern skies

It's always on my mind
This world that seems a world away
But I won't leave behind
These memories I would never change
Cause everything I'm looking for
Is right back here where I belong
And everything I thought I'd lost
I found beneath this southern cross

Cause I've done a lot of wrong trying to make it right
Regretted every last goodbye
But anything is possible here tonight
Underneath these southern skies

And I feel alive
Feel alive
Tonight

Everything I'm looking for
Is right back here where I belong
And everything I thought I'd lost
I found beneath the southern cross

Cause I've done a lot of wrong trying to make it right
Regretted every last goodbye
But anything is possible tonight
Underneath these southern skies
Underneath these skies
I feel alive
