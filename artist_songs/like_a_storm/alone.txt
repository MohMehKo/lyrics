When it's dark at night
You're the voice that's in my head
You're my only light
So don't leave me for dead
Fading

Alone, alone, alone
I'm waiting
Alone, alone, alone
Out cold
Look up, look up
The stars are fading
Light my way back home

If every city light
Was a diamond in my hand
I'd give it all tonight
To be back where I began
I'm fading

Alone, alone, alone
I'm waiting
Alone, alone, alone
Out cold
Look up, look up
The stars are fading
Light my way back

Alone, alone, alone
I'm breaking
I can't make it on my own

Alone, alone, alone
You're waiting
Light my way back home

Heaven only knows just how far I'll go
(Faded)
Til nothing's between
It's only you and me

When it's dark at night
You're always in my head
You're my only light 
Don't leave for dead

Alone, alone, alone
I'm waiting
Alone, alone, alone
Out cold
Look up, look up
The stars are fading
Light my way back

Alone, alone, alone
I'm breaking
I can't make it on my own
Alone, alone, alone
You're waiting
Light my way back home
