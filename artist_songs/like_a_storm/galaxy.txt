Heaven has taken you from me

I remember the days
That we had together
(So long)
You'll always be a part of me
Though time slips away
And nothing's forever
(Hold on)
I'll hold on to the memories
I miss you now
But I feel you all around

Whenever the rain is pouring on me
You'll be shining in my memory
Wherever I go, you're always with me
You'll be shining in my galaxy

Heaven has taken you from me
(You'll be shining in my galaxy)

I can still see your face,
The sound of your laughter
Resonates inside of me
Thought photographs fade,
One thing's forever
(Hold on)
I'll hold onto your memory

I miss you now
Can you hear me screaming out?

Whenever the rain is pouring on me
You'll be shining in my memory
Wherever I go, you're always with me
You'll be shining in my galaxy

I never got to say goodbye
I never saw you close your eyes
I know one day way beyond this life
We'll be burning bright
Forever shining
You're shining

Whenever the rain (whenever the rain)
Is pouring on me
You'll be shining in my memory
Wherever I go, you're always with me
You'll be shining in my galaxy

Shining, shining in my memory
Shining, shining in my galaxy
Shining, shining in my memory
Shining in my galaxy

Heaven has taken you from me
