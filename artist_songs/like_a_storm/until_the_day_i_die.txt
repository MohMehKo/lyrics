The waters rise, the light declines
But I'm not turning back from here
Voices are crying, corpses remind
The most don't make it to the end

Look to the sky
Take back what's mine

This life can be a cemetery
This life can be a shallow grave
I'll never be a casualty
I'll never bow before I break
I'll stand and fight it
Until the day I die

I left the known, to walk alone
'Cause to remain was suicide
The could've been, stood up again
'Cause not to try was just to die

Maybe I'm wrong
But it's my right

This life can be a cemetery
This life can be a shallow grave
I'll never be a casualty
I'll never bow before I break
I'll stand and fight
Until the day I die

I'll stand and fight
I'll stand and fight
I'll stand and fight

Stars keep falling
Darkness calling
Feed the fire I need to light my way

This life can be a cemetery
This life can be a shallow grave
I'll never be a casualty
I'll never bow before I break
I'll face the night
I'll find the light
Look to the sky
Take back what's mine
I'll stand and fight it
Until the day I die
