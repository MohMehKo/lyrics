Help me find a way to resist
The bitterness, the bitterness
Help me find a way to exist
Without the bitterness, the bitterness

I've got a sickness that eats me inside
Lost in the shadows in the back of my mind
I never see it from the brighter side
The glass is empty and the tap's run dry
I've been living my life as a lie
'Cause all they wanna hear is "I'm alright"
How can you live when you've already died?
Show me a sign I can make it right

Help me find a way to resist
The bitterness, the bitterness
Help me find a way to exist
Without the bitterness, the bitterness

No one can save me
If I can't stop the black I bleed
Help me find a way to resist
The bitterness, the bitterness

The bitterness is a kiss of death
One day I'll wake up with nothing left
I need to rip this tumor out of my head
Show me a sign this is not the end

Help me find a way to resist
The bitterness, the bitterness
Help me find a way to exist
Without the bitterness, the bitterness

No one can save me
If I can't stop the black I bleed
Help me find a way to resist
The bitterness, the bitterness

I still feel like the world is against me
(The world is against me)
And I can't find where I belong
(Can't find where I belong)
I just need someone out there to fix me
'Cause I know there's no way back
But in the end I can't go on

Help me find a way to resist
The bitterness, the bitterness
Help me find a way to exist
Without the bitterness, the bitterness
No one can save me
If I can't stop the black I bleed
Help me find a way to resist

The bitterness
The bitterness
