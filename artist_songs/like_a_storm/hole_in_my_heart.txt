I'm so sick of the heartache
Pulling me back again
All the moments have faded
Won't let me go again

I still believe
You'll haunt me until the end
And I don't believe
I can give you away, away

There is a sickness!
So deep in my heart I can barely breathe
God as my witness!
I won't surrender to your disease

I'm so sick of the waiting
Pulling me back again
I still believe in
All that will never be
You'll be the death of me!

I see what you are, see what you are
You're just a hole in my heart
I carry the scar, see what you are
Why can't I tear us apart?

Wake up!
Into the flames, I've been sleepwalking
Face it!
Without me you're left with a void within

I'm so sick of the waiting
Pulling me back again
And I still believe in
All that will never be
You'll be the death of me!

I see what you are, see what you are
You're just a hole in my heart
I carry the scar, see what you are
Why can't I tear us apart?
I see what you are, see what you are
You're just a hole in my heart
I carry the scar, see what you are
Can I go back to the start?

(I still believe in
I can't give you away)

I see what you are, see what you are
You're just a hole in my heart
I carry the scar, see what you are
Why can't I tear us apart?
I see what you are, see what you are
You're just a hole in my heart
I carry the scar, see what you are
Can I go back to the start?

There is a sickness!
God as my witness!
