Hoping you will find this message
The words begin to leave my mouth
Through the capsule down the wire

Yeah you came for love setting of that killer spark
You came for love tearing all my doubts apart

Boost the signal need some gain
Amplify my deepest thoughts
The consol guides my masterplan

Cause you came for love setting of that killer spark
Yeah you came for love tearing all my doubts apart

And I'll reach you through the air
And I'll reach you through the air

Hoping you will find this message
As I watch the faders move
I think of how you make me feel

Cause you came for love setting of that killer spark
Yeah you came for love tearing all my doubts apart
I'll reach you through the air
