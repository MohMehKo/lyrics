Hey, I'm the voice in your head
A friend that you once left for dead
I've been busy, did you miss me
No, you're not paranoid, I'm back to fill the void
Did you understand, The getaway plan

I'm the shiver that runs, up your spine
A strange kind of piece of your mind
You've been lonely, I'm the only
I know you're damaged goods, you did the best you could
I think you understand, the getaway plan

Can you feel me, can you reach me
I lived a thousand lives, feels like I've just arrived
I think you understand, the getaway plan
