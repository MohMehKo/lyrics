A voice that fly, is broken just the same
You spin this life around
You bring me where some harder soul remain
From a cold, cold place in time

And you say: I, I just know how you make me feel
You take it all the way, you send me all the way
Oh, I, I just know where I want to be
Forever wandering, forever travelling

A voice that cry, but im smiling just the same
You show me where to look
I was skin and bones, just circeling the sun
One glimps was all it took

And you say: I, I just know how you make me feel
You take it all the way, you send me all the way
Oh, I, I just know where I want to be
Forever wandering, forever travelling

Somewhere in my mind, Im under the golden gate
Somewhere in my heart, remember sitting by the lake
Sometimes I cant feel, the wheel from the sky, its been turning

Oh, I, I just know how you make me feel
You take it all the way, you send me all the way
Oh, I, I just know where I want to be
Forever wandering, forever travelling
