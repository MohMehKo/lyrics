Nothing looks quite the same
I see people and places in a new light again
There's a grace ascending to a broken sky
Now I know there's a reason why
I feel so alive

'Cause tonight
There's a new love in town
Waking emotions I thought I'd never find
Yes, tonight
How you turned it around
I wanna tell the whole world
There's a new love in town

It's been a strange kind of low
Always held my head up high
Little did I know
That my rose-tinted reality
Would soon fall apart
Just by holding you gently
There's a hope in my heart
I'm out of the dark

So tonight
There's a new love in town
Waking emotions I thought I'd never find
Yes, tonight
How you turned it around
I wanna tell the whole world
There's a new love in town

And everyone I've met has made me what I am today
And every choice I've made has led me here today
And every time I see your face
I've found my way

Oh yes, tonight
There's a new love in town
It's waking emotions
Lord, I never thought I'd find
Yes, tonight
How you turned it around
I wanna tell the whole world
There's a new love in town
There's a new love in town
