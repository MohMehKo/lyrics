It's not like before baby
Tou can't come running back no more

And talk to me
When it cuts like a knife
You just talk to me baby
When the feelin' ain't right
Who do you think you're foolin'
Not me

Septermber rain is fallin'
I see you on the street
Just passin' by
And though your lips are smilin'
I can see the coldness in your eyes

So hell is what you've been through
I never thought I'd see you
'Round here no more
Now you need someone to talk to
Just like before

You only talk to me
When it cuts like a knife
You just talk to me baby
When you hurt deep inside
Who do you think you're foolin'
Not me

You had to have it your way
From you that was a promise
And a threat
Now you look for consulation
Just remember what you give
Is what you get

The hardest part was changin'
I was holdin' on to dreams
From yesterday
I used to be here waitin'
Here's what I say

You only talk to me
When it cuts like a knife
You just talk to me baby
When the feelin' ain't right
Who do you think you're foolin'
Not me
