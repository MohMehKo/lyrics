I've been making some enemies
I've been taking some liberties

Just living my life, try getting it right
Lord, let me tell you
I'm always in the doghouse
No matter what I do
I'm always in the doghouse

I've been running right or wrong
Always running right or wrong

Just living my life, try getting it right
Lord, let me tell you
I'm always in the doghouse
Hey no matter what I do
I'm always in the doghouse

Oh my Lord, my sweet Lord
What have I done
Are you ever, are you ever
Say, are you ever gonna take me home
