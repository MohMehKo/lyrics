I know it’s late, but I’ve had enough
Let’s go for a drive baby shake it up
The headlights cut, so deep these days
You give me that spark to light up the place

It’s like we’re going nowhere
Цith just enough light to see

Now we’re rolling down California 405
The night is open wide
Oh how this world has changed
But tonight we’re free again
Baby to whatever end

Well no-one is foolin’ anyone
No exit signs on the road we’re on

Headin’ out of nowhere
With just enough light to see

Now we’re rolling down California 405
The night is open wide
Oh how this world has changed
But tonight we’re free again
Baby to whatever end

Now we’re rolling down California 405
The night is open wide
Oh how this world has changed
But tonight we’re free again
Baby to whatever end
