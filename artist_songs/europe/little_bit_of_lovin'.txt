Give a little bit of lovin'
And I'll treat you right
Give a little bit of lovin'
And I'll stay the night

Just like a gypsy
I come to town
I've been longin' for that girl
I left behind
I might be a fool yeah
But come what may
I've been lovin' every minute
Everyday

Give a little bit of lovin'
And I'll treat you right
Give a little bit of lovin'
And I'll stay the night

I don't need nobody
I stand alone
But there's a woman that I
Like to call my own
I ain't got the money
To make her shine
But I've got plenty other ways
To make her mine

Give a little bit of lovin'
And I'll treat you right
Give a little bit of lovin'
And I'll stay the night

You got to give me some lovin'
I'm gonna make you feel so good

She's got deadly eyes
A twisted mind
She's one in a million
One of a kind
Cold chills runnin'
Down to the bone
She gives me lovin'
Like I've never known
We tumble and roll over
'Til the break of day
She's so wild
Blows my world away
With her there's nothin'
I wouldn't do
Baby we've got something
To hold on to
Lay it down and it's plain to see
The woman's got the best of me
