I'm gonna hang my hope
On the glowing stars
Of the ceiling of this room
I'm gonna sling my dreams
'Round the captain's hook
And drag him into doom

You give me something I can use
You give me something I can use, my friend
Some drunken honesty
You serve up some remedy
For my demon head
My demon head

I come crashing down
From the galaxies
Right down to the midnight zone
Well, I'm a time-torn man
I can find some peace
Where the glorious monsters roam

You give me something I can use
You give me something I can use, my friend
Some drunken honesty
You are the remedy
For my demon head

Well, I'm gonna ride this train
What's left of me
'Til I'm running out of track
Well, there's a wicked karma chasing me
But as long as you got my back
