Are there years between us?
have you seen me when I didn't see you?
its so good to know that someone can 
love me as much as I think you do...
do I love you?
your a fool if you don't know
or maybe I'm so good at hiding 
even the truth is hidden from you
but somehow I doubt that your 
as smart as I could ever be
but still my question remains  
is our love meant to be? 
cause it feels too good to be true
can someone love me so much more than I love myself
is this all true?
does love resonate in your heart
like the songs say it does?
I can't even begin to believe my dreams
when they actually come true...
