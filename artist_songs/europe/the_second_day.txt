On the first day the writers claimed
There's nothing here that can't be explained
On the second day the rumours fly
People talk about an unprecedented lie
On the third day, well, where do I start
The sorrow, the breaking of the human heart

I just wanna scream out her name

There's a place we just cannot reach
There's a light we just cannot see
There's a hope that won't give out
It should be all we talk about

There's a soul reaching out in fear
No reply in the time were here
We won't forget those faces
We fall to pieces

On the fourth day the pressure will blow
The world is some place that we used to know
On the fifth day no direction home
Empty sky, hollow earth, all is gone

I just wanna scream out her name

There's a place we just cannot reach
There's a light we just cannot see
There's a hope that won't give out
It should be all we talk about

There's a soul reaching out in fear
No reply in the time were here
We won't forget those faces
We fall to pieces

On the second day the rumours fly
People talk about an unprecedented lie

There's a place we just cannot reach
There's a light we just cannot see
There's a hope that won't give out
It should be all we talk about

There's a soul reaching out in fear
No reply in the time were here
We won't forget those faces
We fall to pieces
