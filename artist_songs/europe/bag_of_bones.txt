Bag of bones, I'm a bag of bones
Darker days I've never known
Where's this feeling coming from
Lord, I miss my happy home
I said why now, why now
Should be having the time of my life
I said bag of bones, I'm just a bag of bones
Must be some kind of homecoming song
Homecoming song

And my city lies in ruins
In the stone cold light of day
And I'm sifting through the rubble
How did it get this late
Baby, how did it get this late

Bag of bones, I'm a bag of bones
The darkest sky I've ever known
Now here's a life I can't walk out on
I gotta deal with what's going on
I said why now, why now
I was having the time of my life
I said bag of bones, I'm just a bag of bones
Must be some kind of homecoming song
Homecoming song

And my city lies in ruins
From the last couple of days
And I'm sifting through the rubble
How did it get this late

And my city lies in ruins
From the last couple of days
And I'm sifting through the rubble
How did it get this late

Yeah, my city lies in ruins
In the stone cold light of day
And I'm out late after curfew
How did it get this late

Bag of bones, I'm a bag of bones
Must be some kind of homecoming song
