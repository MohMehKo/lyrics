Of all the streets of all the days
You just had to invade my space
Of all the moves, of all my crazy moves
Just had, it just had to be made on you
Oh c'est la vie

If you swear that I mean nothin' to ya
Hand on heart - no, I can't do it for ya
But if you're lying I'll be comin' for ya
If you swear that I mean nothin' to ya

Of all the lows, of all the highs
I just had to, had to make 'em mine
Of all the words, of all our fights
It become the best years, the best years of my life
Oh, câ€™est la vie

If you swear that I mean nothin' to ya
Hand on heart - no, I can't do it for ya
But if you're lying I'll be comin' for ya
If you swear I mean nothin' to ya

If you swear I mean nothin' to ya
There's nothing I can do for ya
If you're lying I'll be comin' for ya

If you swear that I mean nothin' to ya
Hand on heart - no, I can't do it for ya
But if you're lying I'll be comin' for ya
Can you swear I mean nothin' to ya
I mean nothin' to ya
