I can tell, just by the look
In your eyes, that the love is gone, that I once took
So much has changed in the way you live
I bet there's nothing left that you can ever give

The words of a madman are spoken
I guess I'm not the only one
The heart of a sadman is broken

Eyes, lyin' eyes
You can fool anyone without disguise
Eyes, lyin' eyes
Your look is cold as ice

It's in your blood, it floats in your veins
I sacrify myself but all I feel is pain
You've done me wrong, you've been so bad
But it's the last time a battle is lost
Where I'm the one who's sad

The words of a...

Eyes, lyin' eyes...

I wish you'd die, I wish you'd break down and cry
I wish you'd move and then I know I'd be satisfied
Can't you see I'm on the edge, I can't look down
Is it me who's lost and never found
