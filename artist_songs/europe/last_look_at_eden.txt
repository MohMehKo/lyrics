I'm calling out tonight
For what I feel is right
And I won't be quiet
'Cause I've seen the truth
Modified for you
And we just can't buy it

This is your life
Are you gonna stand by and take

One last look at Eden
Just stop believing and walk away
This could be our moment
It's time that we owned it
I wanna hear you say
Come with me

Are you still out there
The ones who really care
Who's open minded

This is your life
Are you gonna stand by and take

One last look at Eden
Just stop believing and walk away
This could be our moment
It's time that we owned it
I wanna hear you say
Come with me

One last look at Eden
Just stop believing and walk away
This could be our moment
It's time that we owned it
I wanna hear you say tonight
Come with me
