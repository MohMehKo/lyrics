If you let me I will
Pick up the remains
Of your day

If you let me I will
Take a hold of your hand
Tell you that you're sane

You say: give me what you've got
Give me, what you've got
Show me what we're not
There must be a plan for the every man
Give me what you can

Cause I, wish I could believe in God
So I could move ahead
I know I cant believe in God
Time to move ahead

If you let me I will
I will soften the blow
Of the forces that play

If you let me I will
I would find some grace
In the modern day

You say: give me what you've got
Give me, what you've got
Show me what we're not
There must be a plan for the every man
Give me what you can

Cause I, wish I could believe in God
So I could move ahead
I know I cant believe in God
Time to move ahead
