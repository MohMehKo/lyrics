This is the sound
Of us falling apart
This is the sound
Never getting back to the start

I guess we're going down
These are the days
For better or worse
We gotta seal our fate
We're breaking out
It's a world gone mad
But I have never felt so alive
We've gone from riches to rags

This is the sound
Of us digging our graves
Yeah, this is the sound
Of us burnt at the stake

I guess we're going down
These are the days
For better or worse
We gotta seal our fate
We're breaking out
It's a world gone mad
But I have never felt so alive
We've gone from riches to rags
