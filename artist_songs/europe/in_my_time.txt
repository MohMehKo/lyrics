I found the strength
I'm breathing again
And I've told myself
I'm still a lucky man

'Cause when I thought
I couldn't start anew
When it's dark
A light shines through
In my time I got to love you

Well, you showed me how
Just how good life can be
Looking back now
It's almost hard to believe

I'll move ahead
You know I'll do my best
And through it all
I know I'm blessed
'Cause in my time
I got to love you

I never needed someone
Like I need you right now
Just when my new life's begun
Something reminding me
You'll always be the one
So I pick myself up
And I won't let you down
'Cause in my time
I got to love you

I take good care of
What's left behind
I hope it gives you
Some peace of mind
Right now it's tough
But I swear that I'm
Forever glad you were mine

I never needed someone
Like I need you right now
Just when my new life's begun
Something reminding me
You'll always be the one
So I pick myself up
And I won't let you down
'Cause in my time
I got to love you

In my time
I got to love you
