Friday's my runway, just wanna get away
I need these simple pleasures to make my life OK
I know you're all alone on the speakerphone
With both hands free now I, I won't be long

I say hello, baby hello
The only thing that gets me through
Is the way you look at me
While I rock with you
U devil u

And every time I see that smiling face
Coming down from that very special place
It keeps me going for yet another day
When I rock with you

Well now you're all grown up
Yeah, love has struck
The thorn became a rose
I just can't believe my luck
You know that some like it hot
Baby, I got caught
Just like a prisoner
I'm gettin' ready to talk

I say hello, baby hello
The only thing that gets me through
The things you do to me
While I rock with you
U devil u, yeah

And every time I see that smiling face
Coming down from that very special place
It keeps me going for yet another day
When I rock with you

Hang out the sign now, do not disturb
Slip inside a different world
Must be heaven but who can tell
Maybe just a sweet way to go to hell
Yeah

And every time I see that smiling face
Coming down from that, that very special place
Keeps me going for yet another day
When I rock with you

When I rock with you
When I rock with you
U devil u
When I rock with you
U devil u
