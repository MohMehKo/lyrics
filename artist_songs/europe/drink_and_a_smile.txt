It comes from out of nowhere
I hear that simple sound
It gets my body moving
So bad I can't come down

Well, the whole thing's far from perfect
How I choose to spend my precious time
Far from that ragged edge
With a drink and a smile

Feels like I'm on to a winner
Tonight I can do no wrong
God knows she's no beginner
The best I have ever known

Well, the whole thing's far from perfect
How we choose to spend our precious time
Far from that ragged edge
With a drink and a smile

My heart keeps beating faster
Until the lights go out
The last thing I hear is laughter
I do remember what it's like
