There is no time to pay my sin
And everywhere blows a firewind
I'm all alone trying to survive

It's coming back into my head
Memories of the time we had
I'm trying hard to stay alive

The sun is down, the day is done
The sky is dark, and I'm on the run
Yesterday is so far away

The wind is strong there's something wrong
But I just have to carry on
For tomorrow is a brand new day

Cause I left you without saying: "I'll go"
Yes, I left you without letting you know

My memories is chasin' me over mountains high
And across the sea will I ever be well again
I want the strength to carry on,
What's done is done
I want the power in me to remain strong
