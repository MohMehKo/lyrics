I wanted to tell you this boy is growing up
I wanted to show you I'm not always down on my luck
I wanted to give you just a glimmer of hope
I wanted to tell you but I guess I choked

'Cause me and my head high
Crossing the line
Me and my soul fly
But I'm back just in time
Well, you're only young twice

Well, I wanted to tell you it's not a hollow heart
I wanted to show you there is still a spot
I wanted to stand still long enough
I wanted to show you but it just didn't come off

'Cause me and my head high
Crossing the line
Yeah, me and my soul fly
But I'm back just in time
Well, you're only young twice

Me and my head high
Crossing the line
Me and my soul fly
But I'm, I'm back, I'm back, I'm back just in time
Well, you're only young twice
