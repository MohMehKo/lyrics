So many words have passed through my mind
Never thought I'd be so blind
I wish I could understand you

So many things I've heard and seen
But still I don't know what you mean
When you say "I'm leaving you"

I wish I could remember
Everything I've learned
I've tried and I've tried to be so good
And I know i should
Say something before you go
Cause every time I've done something wrong
It's so hard to be strong
Gone are the feelings I want to show

Oh... words of wisdom
Oh... teach me more
Oh... words of wisdom
Oh... so much more
