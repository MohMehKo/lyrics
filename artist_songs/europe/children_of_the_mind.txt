Children of the mind

In a house of stories
Build a temple in your name
Live my whole existence
Crawling back again

Children of the mind
No sun, no moon, no sign
Stealing light and stealing time
Children of the mind
Children of the mind

Carve your name in stone
I'm howlin' at your feet
I'll cave with my resistance
Will be the life and death of me

Children of the mind
No sun, no moon, no sign
Stealing light and stealing time
Children of the mind
Children of the mind

No sun, no moon, no sign
Stealing light and stealing time

Children of the mind
No sun, no moon, no sign
Stealing light and stealing time
Children of the mind
Children of the mind
Children of the mind
