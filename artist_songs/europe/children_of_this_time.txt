She spend one evening alone she's on fire
Thinkin' of you in a dream
You come home and she says you're a liar
Asking "Where have you been"

But she's the angel of your heart
There's not a thing that could set you apart
If nothing comes by 'till the end
If nothing goes wrong
She will always be your friend

You're a fool when you think that she's someone
Who would believe in a lie
You're a fool when you don't think she's someone
Whom you can make cry

Cause you're the hero of her heart
There's not a thing that could set you apart
If nothing comes by 'till the end
If nothing goes wrong
You will always be her friend

You are the children of this time
You are the bread and the wine
You are companions 'till the end
You've got yourselves to defend

Give her more so much more and you'll find out
That it will come in return
Tell her more so much more about your feelings
And she will make them burn

Cause you're the children of today
There's not a thing that could stand in your way
If nothing goes wrong
You will always be friends
