My woman my friend
I have lost you so many times now
Just wanna feel that love again

My woman my friend
Must be some kind of miracle
We get to start all over again

All I know, all I know, all I know
A man goes through hell sometimes
All I know, all I know, all I know
A man gets lucky sometimes
I got lucky 'cause you're

My woman my friend
Must be some kind of miracle
Only the deeds will make a man
Will make the man

All I know, all I know, all I know
A man goes to heaven sometimes
All I know, all I know, all I know
A man gets lucky sometimes
I got lucky 'cause you're

My woman my friend
I remember way back when
Must be some kind of miracle
This can't be how the story ends
