Hey girl don't come to me
And ask me for a helpin' hand
'Cause by the way things seem to be
I would never ever understand
When he comes to you
You always take him back
Hey girl, just wait and see
You're bound to have a heartattack

'Cause whenever you meet
It always turns out the same
You're treated bad again
Treated bad again

Hey girl why can't you learn
that changes can be made
'Cause when he comes to you
You got to turn and walk
the other way
Go out, hit the town,
Try to look for something new
Go out, mess around,
Understand what you are going through

'Cause whenever you meet
It always turns out the same
You're treated bad again
Treated bad again
So many nights
My thoughts bring me to you
I've seen him come and go
And so many years
You don't know I've been watching you
But baby, baby, baby
Would something change if you knew
