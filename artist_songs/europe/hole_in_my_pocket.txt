Hear the cry of the battle born
God is working his ways tonight
Way back we owned this road
But it's a future I can live without
One spark lit up this place
Two sparks baby, amazing grace
Breakneck speed, can't read the signs
You got me running clean out of time

Let's all pretend we don't pretend
It's not the end, it doesn't get better than this

Hole in my pocket
Stone in my shoe
Time keeps on winning
What can you do?
I just can't stop it
I'm blowin' a fuse
Time keeps on winning
What can you do?

Hey baby how did we get here?
Always thought we were already there
Spend my money to buy more time
Now forever's kicking me around
Hey listen, I'm not taking calls
Ain't going back to nothing at all
Against all odds and evidence
I knew my sun was gonna rise again

Let's all pretend we don't pretend
It's not the end, it never gets better than this

Hole in my pocket
Stone in my shoe
Time keeps on winning
What can you do?
I just can't stop it
I'm blowin' a fuse
Time keeps on winning
What can you do?

Hole in my pocket
Stone in my shoe
Time keeps on winning
What can you do?
I just can't stop it
I'm blowin' a fuse
Time keeps on winning
What can you do?
