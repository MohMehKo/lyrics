I'll meet you in the morning sun
Play until your day is done
I'll meet you when you wake up alone
Rock you back from the unknown

And I'll meet you where there's no goodbyes
No black suit, no tie
Meet you where you're safe and sound
Far away from the battleground

I break down when I hear your voice
I break down 'cause I have no choice
I know you run with the angels
Yes, you do
I break down
We can't fail you now

Meet you where life is just
Where no one can abuse your trust
I'll meet you where a faith restored
That you will always be adored

I break down when I hear your voice
I break down 'cause I have no choice
I know you run with the angels
Yes, you do
I break down
We can't fail you

I break down when I hear your voice
I break down 'cause I have no choice
I know you run with the angels
Yes, you do
I break down
We can't fail you now
