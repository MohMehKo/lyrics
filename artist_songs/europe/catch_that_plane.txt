It's getting late, late in the evening
We've got a little situation
It's getting hard, so very hard
I'm gonna need some attention

Just relax
Enjoy yourself
For a while

And my baby says it's been a pretty tough year
Oh, catch that plane and get your ass
Your pretty ass over here
Over here

Well, these northern skies will drive you wild
I haven't slept for days
Drinking hard won't make things right
Might just fuel the flame now

Just relax
Enjoy yourself
For a while

And my baby says it's been a pretty tough year
Catch that plane and get your ass
Your pretty ass over here

Can't recall what set it off
Just how it started
Or how to make it stop
Why is enough never enough
I'm wide awake
We've got lift-off

It's getting late, late in the evening
We've got a little situation
And my baby says it's been a pretty tough year
Catch that plane and get your ass over here

Yeah, my baby says it's been a pretty, pretty tough year
Catch that plane and get your ass
Your pretty ass over here
That's right
Over here
Come on, come on
Catch that plane now
Over here
