There's a light, a different kind of light
When we close, we close our eyes
There's a place, a distant kind of place
We cant let go, just cant let go

There's a faith, a stronger kind of faith
It makes you try, just a little harder
There's a time, a lonely kind of time
When you know, you simply know, that you just cant fake it

A mother's son
Knows he never walks alone
No matter what, he's become
Hard as he tries, he can never give it back
Life's to short, for a mother's son

There's a rage, a silent kind of rage
It makes you live, out on the edge
There's a pain, a different kind of pain
Knowing time, will change everything, you just cant fake it

A mother's son
Knows he never walks alone
No matter what, he's become
Hard as he tries, he can never give it back
Life's to short, for a mother's son

...you just cant fake it

A mother's son
Knows he never walks alone
No matter what, he's become
Hard as he tries, he can never give it back
Life's to short, for a mother's son

There's a light, a different kind of light...
