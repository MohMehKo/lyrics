Like all the rivers we have flown together to the sea
Like all the stars that have aligned to something heavenly
Like all the forces of the dark we're creating below
Nothing can touch the living hope the human spirit owns

So we run across the rainbow bridge
We running for our lives and mistakes we made
Until there's nothing to forgive
We rage across, we rage across the rainbow bridge

Just like we crossed so many lands just to be here now
Well we're still longing for a place we know nothing 'bout

So we run across the rainbow bridge
We're running for our lives and mistakes we made
Until there's nothing to forgive
We run across, we rage across the rainbow bridge

We rage across the rainbow bridge
We're running for our lives and mistakes we made
Until there's nothing to forgive
We rage across, we rage across the rainbow bridge
