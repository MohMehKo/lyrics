I've been sailin' 'cross the ocean
With the devil by my side
I've been flyin 'cross the great
Blue sky
But there's nowhere to hide
I've been standin' by the crossroads
I've been lookin' for a clue
I've been prayin' for the
Human race
There's not a lot I can do

I've been waitin' for the warnin'
As we look to the sky
Now we all seem lost
If you ask me why

It's the seventh sign
See the blood-red sky tonight
It's the seventh sign
See the blood-red sky

There's a voice out on the wasteland
It says we're runnin' out of time
I used to think the world
Could change
Lord I must have been blind
I've been cryin'out for mankind
I've been hangin' on to faith
But the comin' of a messenger
Says it's much too late

We could all come together
And gather all around
What good is war when we
All go down
