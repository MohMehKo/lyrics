Somebody told me, it's all the same now
Somebody told me, we've had our turn
I gotta believe that times still ours
I gotta believe it's still ours to burn

The light seems to be fading
I'm crawling back into that hole
Where the soul seems to awaken
Them days of rock 'n' roll
Days of rock 'n' roll

Somebody told us to shake and shiver
He left the building not long ago
Somebody sold us down the river
Full of scratches and bullet holes

It comes raging out of nowhere
Like some wreckage to behold
We still drink out of the fountain
Of them days of rock 'n' roll
Days of rock 'n' roll
Days of rock 'n' roll

It comes raging out of nowhere
Like some wreckage to behold
We still drink out of the fountain
Of them days, them days of rock 'n' roll
Days of rock 'n' roll
Days of rock 'n' roll
