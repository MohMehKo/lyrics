I see you all cynical
It's the ammunition that you need
Here's another song about empathy
Please yourself think what you will

In her light that shines I fall apart
Her life is blessed and I don't understand
The brave and beautiful soul
Brave and beautiful soul

Here's to you all sensible
Never taken time to stand for something
Hey, the future always come round here to soon
I just cant leave here doing nothing

In her light that shines I fall apart
In her darkness, how she wins my heart
The brave and beautiful soul
Brave and beautiful soul

An emotional response
Sometimes better than an intellectual one

In her light that shines I fall apart
Her life is blessed and I dont understand
The brave and beautiful soul
Brave and beautiful soul
