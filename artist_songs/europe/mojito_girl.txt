Our love

Hey, she's got an 18 carat soul
And she lost her halo long time ago
Oh, she's about to lose control
She's got weapons of mass potential all set to go

So come on
Will you misbehave
Our love can be the sweetest thing
Our love can be the sweetest
Come on
Let the fun begin
Our love can be the sweetest

Hey, she likes her mojito sweet
To kill what little's left of the modesty
Hey, let's get out of this second verse
Be on our wicked way 'till daylight hurts

So come on
Will you misbehave
Our love can be the sweetest thing
Our love can be the sweetest
So come on
Will you let me in
Our love can be the sweetest

Can be the sweetest thing now

Come on and misbehave now

Our love can be the sweetest thing, yeah
Our love can be the sweetest
Oh, come on
Let the fun begin, yeah
Our love can be the sweetest
