We build our wings
In so many ways
We build our hope
It’s the last thing to fade
And we build our love
Please don’t take it away

Out of the night
Come these angels with their broken hearts
They watch us tear this world apart
Oh no
Out of the night
Come these angels with their broken hearts
For you

We build our lives
Hopefully the one that we choose
We keep our faith
When there’s nothing left to lose
We give our hearts
Please don’t tear them apart

Out of the night
Come these angels with their broken hearts
They watch us tear this world apart
Oh no
Out of the night
Come these angels with their broken hearts
For you

Out of the night
Come these angels with their broken hearts
They watch us tear this world араrt
Out of the night
Come these angels with their broken hearts
They watch us tear this world apart
Apart
