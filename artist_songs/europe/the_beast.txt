Oh my, oh my word
We're having more fun than we deserve
Oh hell, oh hell yeah
Chaos reigns inside my head
It's been a long road down the wrong road
I've got everything but a broken soul
Oh my, oh my dear
Strap yourself in 'cause we're out of here

I'm beginning to feel
We can make it 'till the end
I'm beginning to feel
The beast is alive again
I'm beginning to feel
We can make it 'till the end
It's a ride worthwhile, my friend
Go

Oh my, oh my Lord
We're pushing faders from here to New York
Oh well, you gotta have some guts
Wanna live before we're back to dust
We've come a long way and it's our our way
No one can touch us on a good day
We don't show up, we arrive
Maybe it's time you believed the hype

I'm beginning to feel
We can make it 'till the end
I'm beginning to feel
The beast is alive again
I'm beginning to feel
We can make it 'till the end
It's a ride worthwhile, my friend
Go

Way out here
Never wanna come down
There's no fear
No sense of time
You can try to talk me down
Guess there ain't no use
'Cause you might as well
Light up a fuse

I'm beginning to feel
We can make it 'till the end
I'm beginning to feel
The beast is alive again
I'm beginning to feel
We can make it 'till the end
It's a ride worthwhile, my friend
Go
