There's some shadows in a courtyard
Dearly pictured in my mind
Two young lovers moving slowly
A desire they can't hide

I wanna thank you
I wanna thank you
Let it be said

I wanna praise you all over
I wanna praise you all right
From the first time I saw you
I just gotta be in your mind

There's a city, our city
Brought us together in our time
I was drifting
I look around me now
And I know I did, I did something right

I wanna praise you all over
I wanna praise you all right
From the first time I saw you
I just gotta be in your mind

I wanna praise you all over
I wanna praise you tonight
From the first time I had you
I just gotta be on your mind

I wanna praise you, wanna praise you, wanna praise you
All over, all over, all over
From the first time I had you
I just gotta be in your mind

I just gotta be
