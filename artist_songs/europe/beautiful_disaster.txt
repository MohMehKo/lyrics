Here she comes
As subtle as a hurricane
Her wicked smile
Yeah, wrecking everything

I'm alright
That she's all wrong
'Cause I like the mess
That I've become, yeah

You're a disaster, baby
But a beautiful one
Beautiful disaster

There she goes
She had her heart broken clean
It took a lot of cheap highs and expensive lows
But still wrecking everything

She's alright
That I'm all wrong
Kind of like the mess
That I've become, yeah

You're a disaster, baby
But a beautiful one
Beautiful disaster
