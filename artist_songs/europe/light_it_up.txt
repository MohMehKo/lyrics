I was circling round like a lost dog at night
Sniffin’ around for some sign of life
Then Sammy sang and it felt so right
Started up a fire that’s never been put out

Cause every star is a fading sun
Let’s light it up
Eveiy kid got to hit the ground and run
Let’s light it up
Oh light it up

Now things began to change in my neighborhood
The girls were looking pretty and the booze began to taste so good
Every generation gotta go round the bend
Take a little trip and hopefully get back again

Cause every star is a fading sun
So c’mon, light it up
Every kid got to hit the ground and run
Let’s light it up

Cause we want it, yeah we want it
We can have it, so let’s have it
Yeah we want it, yeah we want it
We can have it, let’s have it
Let’s have it

Every star is a fading sun
Hey let’s light it up
Every kid got to hit the road and run
C’mon, let’s light it up
Let’s light it up
