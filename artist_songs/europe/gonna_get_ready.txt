We're gonna get ready

Time to roll up the sleeves
Get another grip
Move on up, take the lead
I'll be the captain of the ship
'Cause I've been here before
Learned the hardest way
Now I've come back for more
We're gonna get ready
We're gonna get ready

All I've ever known
Is take another swing
I'm gonna bring it home
Change everything
All I've ever got
Was the will to win
We're gonna get ready

Sometimes you pay with your sweat
Fighting back the tears
Put in more than you get
It seems you throw away the years
Had my moments of doubt
Well, I'm proud to say
Don't go counting me out
We're gonna get ready

All I've ever known
Is take another swing
I'm gonna bring it home
Change everything
All I've ever got
Was the will to win
We're gonna get ready

Oh, you can't be run by your fear
That is one thing I've learned
From growing up around here
Oh, times you're barely getting by
At the point of no return
That's where I come alive

All I've ever known
Is take another swing
I'm gonna bring it home
Change everything
All I've ever got
Was the will to win
We're gonna get ready
We're gonna get ready now
