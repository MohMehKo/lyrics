There was a time, when I was satisfied
There was a time, when everything felt right
But now's the time for me to decide
And I've only got one solution in sight
Don't know where I'm going
But I know it feels right
And though my feelings are showing
I'm not afraid, it's alright

So long, farewell
I've got to go
Be strong, be well
I want you to know
That maybe we'll meet someday

Should I stay or should I go
It was not easy to decide
But you told me: "I already know"
I guess you wondered why I lied
