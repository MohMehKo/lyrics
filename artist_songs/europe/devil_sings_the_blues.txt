Today, I'm the dirt beneath your feet
At your beckon call
Today, I'm down on my bended knees
I learned to crawl

Days like these,
It's like I never lived at all

And my heart is open
And my eyes are open
Today, I give my life to you
And my arms are open
And my faith is open
Today, the devil sings the blues

Tonight, angels presence fill the room
So this is how it feels
Tonight, the devil takes the long way round
There will be no deal

Times, like these
It's like I never lived at all

And my heart is open
And my eyes are open
Tonight, I give my life to you
And my arms are open
And my faith is open
Tonight, the devil sings the blues

And my heart is open
And my eyes are open
Tonight, I give my life to you
And my arms are open
And my faith is open
Tonight, the devil sings the blues
