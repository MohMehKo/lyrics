I, I walk this Earth
Until I stagger and fall
To my knees

I won't rest my bones
If I'm awake or asleep
There'll be no relief

They say we're tired of love
That we're running away
Leave no stone unturned
Leave no stone unturned
Believe and you shall arrive

The trust has gone bit by bit
'Cause they've been twisting the truth
But our skin is too thick

They say we're tired of love
That we're running away
Leave no stone unturned
Leave no stone unturned
Believe and you shall arrive

They say we're tired of love
And that we're running away
Leave no stone unturned
Leave no stone unturned
Believe and you shall arrive

You shall arrive
