Everything you see, you just can't erase
Everything you love, you'll never replace
Everything you feel, you still have to face
You can only have today
So if you wanna go, stay
If you wanna run, wait
Everything is okay
You gotta live in the now
'Cause you can't go back to yesterday
You gotta live in the now
'Cause tomorrow is too far away

We can never know the way we're gonna be
You can plan it out, but it's still a mystery
If you let it go, your heart will be free
You can do anything
If you wanna go, stay
If you wanna run, wait
Everything is okay
You gotta live in the now
'Cause you can't go back to yesterday
You gotta live in the now
'Cause tomorrow is too far away

Everything that happened in the past is just a dream
Everything that happens in the future is a mystery
So if you wanna go, stay
If you wanna run, wait
Everything is okay
You gotta live in the now
'Cause you can't go back to yesterday
You gotta live in the now
'Cause tomorrow is too far away

If you wanna go, stay
If you wanna run, wait
Everything is okay
'Cause we live in today
If you wanna go, stay
If you wanna run, wait
Everything is okay
'Cause we live in today
