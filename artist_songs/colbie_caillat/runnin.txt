I've been runnin' to river all along
Keep on climbing 'cause of what I've known
I was waiting for something real to start
Almost dreaming up full bad of my heart

Watching my life throw into sea
The time is taking its toll of me
I thought my days on the road were through
Till I started runnin' it with you
Life was slowly passing by till I had you by my side
I thought my days on the road were through
Till I started runnin' it with you
Yeah

Now I'm sailing as far as I can see
It's against the wind but now it carries me
I was waiting for something real to start
Glad I left some room here for you

Watching my life throw into sea
The time is taking its toll of me
I thought my days on the road were through
Till I started runnin' it with you
Life was slowly passing by till I had you by my side
I thought my days on the road were through
Till I started runnin' it with you
Oh, listen to your heart when you need more loving
Take another chance when you need rush in your bones
You're not alone
Oh, if you start to feel like you can't stop runnin'
Find another place that you feel like calling home, call it home
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah

Watching my life throw into sea
The time is taking its toll of me
I thought my days on the road were through
Till I started runnin' it with you
Life was slowly passing by till I had you by my side
I thought my days on the road were through
Till I started runnin' it with you

We're runnin'
We're runnin'
Uuuh uh uh uh
I'm runnin'
I'm runnin'
With you
