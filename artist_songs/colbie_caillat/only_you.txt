I'm kinda obsessed with how you're obsessed
With making me feel like nobody else
'Cause nobody makes me feel like you do
The look on your face whenever you taste
The way that I taste, it's like you're amazed
With every little thing that I do
I love your loving, keep me coming back
Whenever I want more
I can't stop dreaming bout you dreaming
I'd be coming back for more

Only you can keep me falling like a summer rain
Get me so hot to cool me off again
Only you can send me flying like a meteorite
Blazing through the haze into the sky blue eyes
Only you, only you
Only you, only you

I really adore the way you adore the way that we dance
Before on the floor like every night is Saturday night
You take me to town, you're shaking me down
I can't even tell there's no one around
Candles our city lights
You pick me up and you drink me up
You take with no [?] aligned

Only you can keep me falling like a summer rain
Get me so hot to cool me off again
Only you can send me flying like a meteorite
Blazing through the haze into the sky blue eyes
Only you, only you
Only you, only you
Only you, only you
Only you, only you

Can make me believe I'm the queen of your heart
Shine like a diamond, and burn like a star
Wherever I am, wherever you are
I know that I'll always love only you, only you, only you
Only you, only you, only you

Only you can keep me falling like a summer rain
Get me so hot to cool me off again
Only you can send me flying like a meteorite
Blazing through the haze into the sky blue eyes
Only you, only you
Only you, only you

I'm kinda obsessed with how you're obsessed
With making me feel like nobody else
'Cause nobody makes me feel like you do
