Let's not complicate it, let's not think too much
Let's blow each other's minds with every single touch
We can't pretend we feel this and let our hearts collide
And on the way to love we'd kiss it every red light

Oh ooh, here we go
We got a good thing going on
We got a good thing going on
Oh, don't you try to hide it
Let's not even fight it
We're at where we belong
We got a good thing going on
Yeah, we got a good thing
Yeah, we got a good thing

Let's forget the reasons and stop asking why
Let's be together in this moment and feel so alive
We can start a fire, make the sparks ignite
We'll watch our worries rise up smoke into the starlight

Oh ooh, there they go
We got a good thing going on
We got a good thing going on
Oh, don't you try to hide it
Let's not even fight it
We're at where we belong
We got a good thing going on

Don't hit the brakes
We can learn from mistakes
'Cause you know it will make us strong
If you're by my side we can move on the rise
Till we know that it can't be wrong

Yeah, we got a good thing going on
We got a good thing going on
Oh, don't you try to hide it
Let's not even fight it
We're at where we belong
We got a good thing going on
Yeah, we got a good thing
Yeah, we got a good thing
Yeah, you make my heart sing
Yeah, we got a good thing
Yeah, you make my heart sing
