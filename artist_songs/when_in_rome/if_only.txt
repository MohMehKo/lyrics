Thinking 'bout you and me
In a real life tragedy, yeah yeah
You mess with insanity
No reason for vanity, no no
You falling from a tree as life
Its not so hard when you hit the floor
You just bounce back up again they say
So brush yourself off and say 'ok'
And start yourself and say 'which way'
And brush yourself off and say 'yeah yeah' 

I'm never gonna fall that way again
My feet never touched the ground
I'm never gonna sit & count to ten 
I'll always remember 
Some people would've called this heaven sent 
If only they'd known better

I took all those memories
But I'll never hold you again, no no
It might be my imagination playin' those tricks again 
So brush yourself off and say ok
Then start yourself off and say which way 
Brush yourself off and say yeah yeah

I'm never gonna fall that way again
My feet never touched the ground
I'm never gonna sit & count to ten 
I'll always remember 
Some people would've called this heaven sent 
If only they'd known better

So brush yourself off and say ok
Then start yourself off and say which way 
Brush yourself off and say yeah yeah

I'm never gonna fall that way again
My legs buckle under  
I'm never gonna sit & count to ten 
I'll always remember 
Some people would've called this common sense
If only I'd known better
If only I'd known better
