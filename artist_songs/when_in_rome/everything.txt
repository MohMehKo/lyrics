Brick by brick
And wall by wall
Just like before
I'll watch you fall
Then once again
You'll come to me
Still asking for
My sympathy
I'm not listening 
To you anymore
No, no, no
I'm not listening
To you anymore

I would have given my heart
I would have given my everything
I would have given my soul
If you had only waited 

Step by step
And toe to toe
You've danced around
Now you must go
I'm still thinking
You gave it all away
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Back to back
And front to side
Whatever you read
You took as lies
I'm still writing
To you every day
I'm still writing
Day after day

I would have given my heart
I would have given my everything
I would have given my soul
If you had only waited 
I would have given my heart
I would have given you everything
I would have given it all
If you had only waited 
Just a little while longer

I would have given my heart
I would have given my soul
If you had only waited 
Just a little while longer
