I was foolin' around,
Somewhere in a foreign town.
Are you ready to let your tears roll down?

When you're foolin' around,
Your conscious will let you down.
It's easy to be sorry, but not so easy to forget.

Braver men than me, 
Have told this story, yeah, yeah.
Braver men than me,
Still count the cost, yeah, yeah.

[Chorus:]
Because the 
Sight of your tears,
Rules of emotion,
The sight of your fears,
The sight of your tears (the sight or your tears),
Brings me down

Now I feel like a fool
But I could see faith in you.
You gave me so much pleasure
And turned and walked away.

Then it came to me
In quick succession, yes it did.
All my runnin' around 
Taught me this lesson, yeah, yeah

[Chorus:]
Because the 
Sight of your tears (sight of your tears)
Rules of emotion (rules of emotion)
Sight of you fears (sight of your fears)
Sight of your tears (sight of your tears)
Brings me down (brings me down, uh, huh)

[Bridge:]
Is there nothin' 
I can say (nothing I can say)
Is there nothin' I can do (I can do)
It doesn't matter anyway
I lost you now
But I'll always love you.

[Chorus:]
Because the
Sight of your tears (no more lovin and attention)
(Sight of your tears)
Rules of emotion (no more lovin and affection)
(Rules of emotion)
Sight of your fears (no more lovin and attention)
(Sight of your fears)
The sight of your tears (no more lovin and affection)
(Sight of your tears)
Brings me down

[Repeat until fade out]
