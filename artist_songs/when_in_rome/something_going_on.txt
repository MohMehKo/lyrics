Reach out and hold me close
I wanna be the one you miss the most
Just kiss me and keep me there for a moment of your timeâ€¦
Cause when you hold me in your arms
You make me feel like our love lies calm
Your lips are warm and sweet
The more I kiss you, the more I notice
Ooh, I need you to stay now
And, ooh, don't you dare walk away
When I know there's something wrong
Something going on
I know there's something wrong yeah
Something going on
When you say you feel this way
I wanna be the one to share your day
And like the way you move across the floor
You keep me coming back for more and more
Ooh, I need you to stay now
And, ooh, don't you dare walk away
When I know there's something wrong yeah
Something going on
I know there's something wrong yeah
Something going on
Now I know there's something wrong...
There's some... thing...

Now reach out and hold me (you betcha)
Ooh, I need you to stay now
And, ooh, don't you dare walk away
When I know there's something wrong yeah
Something going on
I know there's something wrong yeah
Something going on
Now I know there's something wrong...
