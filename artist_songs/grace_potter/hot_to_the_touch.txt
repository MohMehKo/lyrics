Forgive me if I'm not myself tonight
My body's in a battle with my mind
Intoxicated with a dangerous desire
You struck the match and now I can't control the fire

Don't you know you want me baby
Don't you know you feel the same

This love is hot, hot to the touch
A little too much is never enough
This love is hot, hot to the touch
A little too much for people like us

Driving home at night I'm aching for your touch
Barely breathing, I'm so caught up in this heavy rush
Is it possible to want something too much
Cause one night with you is never quite enough

Don't you know you want me baby
Don't you know you feel the same

This love is hot, hot to the touch
A little too much is never enough
This love is hot, hot to the touch
A little too much for people like us

I know you know I want you baby
You know I know you feel the same

This love is hot, hot to the touch
A little too much is never enough
This love is hot, hot to the touch
A little too much for people like us
