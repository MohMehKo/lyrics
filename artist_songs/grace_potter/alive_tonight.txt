In the dark of the desert
I saw a man with a sign, it said
People get ready, cause it's all over
It's all gonna end tonight, well

I got a feeling we're gonna be alright
But if this is the last time we ever see the daylight

We are, we are, we are
Alive tonight
Yeah
We are, we are, we are
Alive tonight

You wanna get in on the action, you want
Everyone to listen to you, oh
You're just living in a prediction
And that dont, that don't make it true, no

I got a feeling we're gonna be alright
But if this is the last time we ever see the daylight

We are, we are, we are
Alive tonight
Yeah
We are, we are, we are
Alive tonight

Nobody knows what will come tomorrow
Nobody knows 'til the lights go out
Nobody knows who to fight or follow
There's only one thing I know right now

We are, we are, we are
Alive tonight
Yeah
We are, we are, we are
Alive tonight [x2]
