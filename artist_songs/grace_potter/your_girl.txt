I could make you mine
I'm so tempted to touch you
I'm dying to cross the line
But I like your girl too much
I never wanted to meet her
But you let me
So you can't tempt me no more
And you can't have it both ways baby
So stop making me burn

I wish I never met your girl
I wish I never met your girl
Cause I really like her
I wish I never met your girl
I wish I never met your girl
And I don't wanna hurt her
I wish I never met your girl
Your girl, your girl, your girl

When she's not by your side
You let our bodies touch
I'm trying to put out the fire
Cause I like your girl too much
When she was a stranger
It was so easy
Living in my dream but now
I can't shoot down an angel
Just because I want to be your midnight queen, no no

I wish I never met your girl
I wish I never met your girl
Cause I really like her
I wish I never met your girl
I wish I never met your girl
And I don't wanna hurt her
I wish I never met your girl
Your girl, your girl, your girl

Close my eyes every night
Try to dream about you but I only see her face
Thought my heart wants you now
I can live without you now but talk about you never, ever have to say

Wish I never met your girl
Wish I never met your girl
Cause I really like her
And I wish I didn't like your girl
Wish I didn't like your girl
But I do
And I don't wanna hurt her
I wish I never met your girl
Your girl, your girl, your girl
I wish I never met your girl
Your girl, your girl, your girl
