I know you, I see you
Eyes from across the room
Embodied perfection
Drink in your every move
I watch you from the shadows
Bring strangers to their knees
An ocean of faces
But you're dancing just for me

There's nothing like a party
To make you move this way
And there's nothing stopping me from
Sweeping you away
And you know exactly who I am
Oh, I'm your biggest fan

The lovesick, lonely viper
Waits for the perfect time
Then slowly wraps around her
Unconscious concubine
Come closer, a little closer
There's no need to be afraid
Why would you run from me
Before you tell that we were made

There's nothing like a party
To make you move this way
And there's nothing stopping me from
Sweeping you away
And you know exactly who I am
Oh, I'm your biggest fan

There's nothing like a party
To make you move this way
And there's nothing stopping me from
Sweeping you away
And you know exactly who I am
Oh, oh, I'm your biggest fan
I'm your biggest fan
