Sleeping under concrete skies
Underneath a pair of dice
This city is a dirty jerk
But baby so is love
And we ain't kicking either one tonight
Is it too late, too late to turn around?
Cause it feels like we're already underground

So when you're feeling low, you know
I'm going down with you lover
And I'm never letting go, you know
You will never go down, never go down alone
Ooh oh oh, when you're feeling low [x2]

Living off of love and life
Cause I don't wanna compromise
Trouble is a dirty jerk
But baby so is love
And we ain't kicking either one tonight
Cause it's too late, too late to turn around
Baby I'm already underground

So when you're feeling low, you know
I'm going down with you lover
And I'm never letting go, you know
You will never go down, never go down alone
Ooh oh oh, when you're feeling low [x2]

And if we lose, lose each other
In the undertow
Baby swim, swim to the bottom
And I'll be waiting for you way down low

I'm going down with you lover
And I'm never letting go, you know
You will never go down, never go down alone
Ooh oh oh, I'm going down with you lover no I'm
I'm never letting go
Ooh oh oh, you know you will never go down
Never go down alone
Ooh oh oh, when you're feeling low [x2]
