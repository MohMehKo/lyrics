United we stand, divided we fall
It's time to crossover, shoulder to shoulder
Raise up your arms, come one, come all
We've got to crossover

Shoulder to shoulder, we blow on the coals
In the cold of our souls, we crash in the hole

You, me, together we're gonna be
The instigators
Revolution loves company
We are the revelators

There's a generation living in a satellite
And they're getting closer, closer and closer
Raise up your arms, hold up the sky
It's time to crossover

Shoulder to shoulder, we blow on the coals
In the cold of our souls and we're ready to fight

You, me, together we're gonna be
The instigators
Revolution loves company
We are the revelators

Shoulder to shoulder, we blow on the coals
In the cold of our souls and we're ready to fight

You, me, together we're gonna be
The instigators
Revolution loves company
We are the revelators
