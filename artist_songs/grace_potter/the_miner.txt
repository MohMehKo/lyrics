You got a hunger for my heart
You say there's diamonds in my eyes
And as I hold you in my arms
I let you bleed me dry

I don't understand what you do,
Why you hurt the one who loves you,
I feel you mining in my bones
I feel you digging in my soul

Woah oh, you're taking so much
I'm breaking down
So go on, keep taking more
'till everything is gone
You're breaking me down
Breaking me down

And you can see it in my eyes
I'm sleepless even in the dark
And my fingers trace the lines
Where I used to have a heart

I don't understand what you do
Why you hurt the one who loves you
I feel you mining in my bones
I feel you digging in my soul
Oh oh oh

Woah oh, you're taking so much
I'm breaking down
So go on, keep taking more
'till everything is gone
You're breaking me down
Breaking me down

Woah oh, you're taking so much
I'm breaking down
So go on, keep taking more
'till everything is gone
You're breaking me down
You're breaking me down
You're breaking me down
