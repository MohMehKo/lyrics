Your mind moved on
But your body didn't know it was time to let go
It took a while to realize
That you would never want to be around
Without your feet on the ground

Then you crossed that razor-sharp line
There's no soft edges I can find
There's no turning back this time
You're just gone

Now I gotta let you go
So it won't hurt no more
If I could let you go
Then I wouldn't feel sick no more

Sometimes I wonder
If we hadn't gotten so close
This wouldn't hurt as much I suppose
I could survive a hundred lonely years
If I could get back just a moment you were standing here

But you crossed that razor-sharp line
There's no soft edges I can find
There's no turning back tonight
You're just gone

Now I gotta let you go
So it won't hurt no more
If I could let you go
I wouldn't feel sick no more

And I'm trying to find that time when I
Can smile about all these lonely memories
Maybe eventually
If I could just let you go

I let you go
It doesn't hurt no more
I could let you go
No I don't feel sick no more

Now I find with the passing time
I'll be all right with only the memories
That you gave to me

I can let you go
I could let you go
I can let you go
I can let, I can let you go
