Can't sleep, I can't resist
The street lights are so persistent
They keep calling out to me
From the dark side of the city
Hey hey, is anybody still awake
Let's make some magic before the day breaks
Don't wanna sleep, it's not mysterious
Just love the way I feel when I, when I get

Delirious, delirious

And the day turns into night
Turns into day, turns into delirious
Another day turns into night
Turns into day, and I'm still delirious

I never close my eyes
Cause I don't know what's waiting on the other side
And life's just too good to miss
And that's why I never sleep
I love the way I feel when I'm

Delirious, delirious

And the day turns into night
Turns into day, turns into delirious
Another day turns into night
Turns into day, and I'm still delirious

And I know I'm gonna fall
Into this twisted place
I'm sliding deeper as I override my mind
And I'm delirious

And the day turns into night
Turns into day, turns into delirious
Another day turns into night
Turns into day, and I'm still delirious

Another day turns into night
Turns into day, turns into delirious
Another day turns into night
Can't get away from being delirious
