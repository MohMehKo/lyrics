[Verse 1:]
Sitting here on the edge of the bed
I rewind all your replies and what you said
Don't deny all of the lies cause you misled
Need to believe that I wasn't a good man

[Pre-chorus:]
That's what it was, it's all it is
It will be a cold day in hell before I miss
All of the silly shit that led to arguments
It will be a cold day in hell before I miss (trouble, trouble)
That's what you are to me, baby girl (trouble, trouble)
That's what you are to me, baby girl (trouble, trouble)

[Chorus:]
When you get lost in just lovin' someone pretty (trouble, trouble)
You'll always find (trouble, trouble)
You'll always find (trouble, trouble)
When you get lost in just lovin' someone pretty
You'll always find (trouble, trouble)
Happens every time (trouble, trouble)

[Verse 2:]
I can't lie, girl, sometimes I think about you
But not the sweetest memory (not the sweetest memory)
But not the sweetest memory and that may come true
I just wanna forget about you (trouble, trouble)

[Pre-chorus:]
That's what it was, it's all it is
It will be a cold day in hell before I miss
All of the silly shit that led to arguments
It will be a cold day in hell before I miss (trouble, trouble)
That's what you are to me, baby girl (trouble, trouble)
That's what you are to me, baby girl (trouble, trouble)

[Chorus:]
When you get lost in just lovin' someone pretty (trouble, trouble)
You'll always find (trouble, trouble)
You'll always find (trouble, trouble)
When you get lost in just lovin' someone pretty
You'll always find (trouble, trouble)
Happens every time (trouble, trouble)

[Bridge:]
Funny how we can get so caught up on the surface (surface, surface)
We forget about what really makes love last (last, last)
Next time I'll do better, next time I'll read the signs
Next time I'll tell myself slow it down and see her mind
Next time, I won't be so blind to what's inside

[Chorus:]
When you get lost in just lovin' someone pretty (trouble, trouble)
You'll always find (trouble, trouble)
You'll always find (trouble, trouble)
When you get lost in just lovin' someone pretty
You'll always find (trouble, trouble)
Happens every time (trouble, trouble)
