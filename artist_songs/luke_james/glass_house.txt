You changed, where do we o babe
You changed, should it left it all the same
But you changed
I look the other way
But I can't, did you think at what it brings?

You changed, what happened to my baby
Cause she changed, we ball chase the same
But you changed, did you even know my name
I always right there babe
No matter what they had to say you

The rocks of the glass house
Are you gonna break?
Like a? gonna break? Like a? gonna break
The rocks of the glass house
Are you gonna break?
Like a? gonna break? Like a? gonna break

How you change? My heart won't be the same
Gitl I've changed and you're the ne to blame
Yes I change every since your love baby don't feel the same
You've brokin' me

The rocks of the glass house
Are you gonna break?
Like a? gonna break? Like a? gonna break
The rocks of the glass house
Are you gonna break?
Like a? gonna break? Like a? gonna break
