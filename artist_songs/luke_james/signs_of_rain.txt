[Intro:] Yeah

[Verse 1:]
Sun, shines off your face, like clouds we lay on, you and me.
The stars, they watch in awe, lost in your beauty, so far away.
Like air, you breathe me in;
I feel you then become one with me. (ooh)

[Chorus:]
And the thunder sounds after lightening strikes

[Verse 2:]
Your body ooh, girl I see the change, that's the signs of rain.

[Bridge:]
AAH, AAH, oooh-ooo, oh-ooo... aah-ahhhh...

[Verse 3:]
Your eyes unleash signs of warning and skies of moaning, for me.
That's how your world comes to exploding, begging for me to set you free.

[Bridge:] Yeah oh...

[Chorus:]
And the thunder sounds after lightening strikes

Your body, I see the change, ooh, that's the signs of rain (ooh Aah-oohh...)

[Verse 4:]
Feel the rumble, taking over, you can't hold your emotions, feel the climax, let it fall, the signs of rain, you can't ignore;
It feels like heaven's opened up it's door, let it fall, let it fall, the signs of rain.

[Moaning/Sounds...]

[Chorus:]
And the thunder sounds after lightening strikes (Aah-ooh) [2x]

[Verse 5:]
I could sit here all day next to you
I could lay here and play ooh, next to you
I could watch you go to sleep right here, next to you...
Darling I just wanna be next to you... next to you... next to you...

(Ooh Aah-oohh...)

Next to you... sun and the moon
Next to you... life after death
Next to you... living forever
Next to you... A child is born...

(Ooh Aah-oohh...)
