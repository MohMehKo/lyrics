We made love
Nuclear angels reign from above
It was so right
I cant get it out of my mind, yeah
It was a late Saturday in the pouring rain
I walked you home, you begged me to stay
Pulled me closer, help me please
Cant wait no longer, I'll be all you need

Baby your body's calling for a soldier
Pleasing you more and more, well I yours
Whatever you want, whatever you need
5, 4, 3, 2, 1

Sex like we've never met
The love that we belong here
Whoa, what your body saying
Connection is strong here, talk to me
Your eyes said that you never felt this way
And you want it to stay
But all that you could say was

Do you love me? (Yeah)
Do you swear to take your time? (Talk to me baby)
Hold me (Yeah)
Protect me from the night
Do you need me? (Yeah)
Please my body right
Your body's a battlefield and I came here to fight

Baby your body's calling for a soldier
Pleasing you more and more, well I know
Whatever you want, whatever you need
Count on me, yeah, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

Every woman longs for a love
That is strong and wont give up
Every woman deserves to have what she wants
A man with power, A man who is real
A man who adheres to every single thing she feels
Someone that will take you from that lonely nights you fear
The man you want is standing here, oh girl

Baby your body's calling for a soldier
Pleasing you more and more, girl I'm yours
Whatever you want, whatever you need
Count on me yeah, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

Baby your body's calling for a soldier
Pleasing you more and more, girl I'm yours baby
Whatever you want, whatever you need
5, 4, 3, 2, 1
