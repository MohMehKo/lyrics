(Tell me something I don't know)
(yeah) [3x]

I wear my heart on my sleeve (what you think about that)
I wear it where you can't see (what you think about that)
I come as real as can be (what you think about that)
You won't find no one like me (but what you think about that)

And
All I know [6x]
Is what you tell me (tell me) [2x]
But wait a minute
Dance [2x]
Wait a minute
Dance

I came to take what's for me (what you think about that)
You'll follow just as I lead (what you think about that)
Time to be like that baby, girl (what you think about that)
I give you all that you need, yeah (but what you think about that)

And
All I know [6x]
Is what you tell me (tell me) [2x]
But wait a minute
Dance [2x]
Wait a minute
Dance

Dance like we got forever [4x]
Baby just love me [2x]
Gently [2x]

Dance [2x]
Wait a minute
Dance

(Baby don't fight the feeling)
Dance
(Open your heart and I'll open mine)
Dance
(We got a feeling, baby don't let it die)
Dance
(Don't let it girl, don't let it)
But wait a minute
Dance
