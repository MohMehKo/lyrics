I'm a man of simple knowledge
She's a woman that's prone to violence
It used to be something beautiful
Red flags, regardless
And love used to be our vehicle
But now there's too much mileage
So please forgive me
Cause I never meant to hurt your daughter
But on the real (iisshhh)
She's using everything you taught her

And this lyric is a miracle
And a blessing, and a problem
This lyric is a miracle
And a blessing, and a problem

And all I'm tryna say is we got options
Baby, all I'm saying is we got options
Red or green
So what's gon' be?
Cause I never been a fan of running
Let's fight the pain, but baby, we'll see
But you could never see the future coming
(So, so) Girl, I'm just thinking about our options
Girl, I'm just thinking about our options
Hold on

So far gone, I'm barely breathing
She's holding on, guess she's got her reasons
It really hurts to see what we've become
And that's why I'm leaving
Betrayed all the good we've ever done in one single evening
So please forgive me
Cause I'd never wanna hurt my daughter
But all the real ache, (you)
You hurt more than I thought you could

And this lyric is a miracle
And a blessing, not a problem
This lyric is a miracle
And a blessing, not a problem

I can't believe I said that we had options
I never should've said we had options
Red or green, so what's it gonna be
Cause I never been fan of running
That's right the pain, but baby, we'll see
But you could never see the future coming

[Rick Ross:]
(Aye Luke let me talk to her)
Started out a college girl, now she in the model world
Screaming she gon' make her way
Rocking all kinda fur
Her friends wanna see her fail, but she got a mind made
Cool she an outcast, big boy he a Andre
Talking bout myself though, heard that I was self-centered
Apologies to my ex, on to the next sentence
My nuance one say I'm like that, parties at the spotlight
Heels out of LA, we lit up at the nighttime
Life is shorter than a flick, maybe we should make a scene
All positions came through, mean you rate it A to Z
Hangin' from the shower rod, maybe we can skip that
But you know that's how I come
Fat boy always with that
Untouchable my clique is
Money long as my dick is
Shawty handle her business, she the realest
Hundred stacks of Bel-Air
Black bottle, black mail
You lookin' at who run the city
Luke James run it with me

So maybe taking life is not an option, (oh no)
Maybe taking life is not an option, (oh no no baby)
Red or green, so what's it gonna be
Cause I never been fan of running, (no no)
That's right, but baby, we'll see
But you could never see the future coming
Girl, I'm just thinking about our options
