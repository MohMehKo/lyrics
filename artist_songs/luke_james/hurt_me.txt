[Verse 1:]
They say that you're no good,
They say you've got me twisted,
'cause when I'm in your hood,
All we do is bang, bang, bang,
They say that we won't last,
But I believe just different, 
They're throwin' broken glass,
But we be like bang, bang, bang oh baby 

[Chorus:]
They can say that you're no good for me,
That I'm wasting all my energy,
But the love you give is good to me,
I could walk away but it's worth the pain, 
Hurt me baby hoo 
Hurt me baby hoo 
Work it baby, drive me crazy
Hurt me baby

[Verse 2:]
They say that I'm your prey,
And you're my hunter,
You're gonna shoot one day,
And I'll go bang, bang, bang
They say that I'm on fire, 
I guess that you're my flame girl
We can't put out desire
Not even rain, rain, rain 

[Chorus:]
Whoa they can say that you're no good for me, 
That I'm wasting all my energy, 
But the love you give is so good to me,
I could walk away but it's worth the pain 
Hurt me baby, woo woo
Hurt me baby, hoo whoa
Hurt me baby, drive me crazy
Hurt me baby
Hurt me baby, woo woo
Hurt me baby, ooo woo
Hurt me baby, drive me crazy 
Hurt me baby 

[Bridge:]
It kills them how we love and they can't take it no,no
The crimes we be committin', they can't catch us nah, nah,
Who's lovin' like we do? who's bangin' like we do?
Nobody, nobody
Drop me from a thousand feet, I bet I'll survive 
Pull the trigger baby girl I swear I won't cry,
Keep lovin' like you do, no one can fuck like you 
Nobody, nobody, damn it

[Chorus:]
Hurt me baby, yeah 
Hurt me baby, oh
You better work it baby, drive me crazy
Ohhhh woooooo hooo hooo 
Hurt me baby, 
Better work it baby, drive me crazy
Hurt me baby, woahhhh... hey

[Verse 3:]
My friends, they say walk away,
Luke, you don't deserve the pain,
But I tell 'em, they don't know,
Just what I gain from you baby,
Your love, your sweet love, heavenly love,
They say run away, run away, find somebody else,
But I don't want nobody, I just want you baby,
So I'm willin' to go through the rain, through the fire hey,
Through the pain, mm da da da, oohh hurt me babe

[Breakdown:]
Does that make me crazy? does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy? possibly
Does that make me crazy? does that make me crazy?
That make me crazy? 'cause all I want is your love,
Hey...oooo whooo... ooooo,
All I want is your love, la la, 
Hurt me baby, hurt me baby, 
Oooo ooo... hurt me baby 

[Ending:]
Play with my mind, play with my mind,
Just don't, just don't break my heart,
Hurt me baby, hurt me babe,
Do what you wanna ohh,
Just don't break my heart,
Hurt me baby
