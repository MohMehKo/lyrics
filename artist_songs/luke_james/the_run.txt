I feel like a man on the run
You can search all you want to try to find me, baby
I feel like the man on the run
You can search all you want to try to find me, baby

I know I don't make it easy, you actin' like you don't need me
Some things may come around and some of these things will knock us down
But I'm, I'm about to break your fall, don't you
Don't you worry bout a thing
I wonder, you wonder, could be we love each other
Could be we both don't wanna go and ' up a good thing

I see in your hand, there's a gun
You can shoot all you want to try and scare me, baby
I see in your hand, there's a gun
You can shoot all you want to try to kill me, baby

I know I don't make it easy, you actin' like you don't need me
Some things may come around and some of these things will knock us down
But I'm, I'm about to break your fall, don't you
Don't you worry bout a thing
I wonder, you wonder, could be we love each other
Could be we both don't wanna go and ' up a good thing
I wonder, you wonder, could be we love each other
Could be we both don't wanna go and ' up a good thing
