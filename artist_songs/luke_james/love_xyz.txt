Come to me and I'll give you all that you need
Love XYZ
Come
Come, come into me
And I'll give you all that you need
Love XYZ
So I must be wrong with my feelings
(What's wrong with me)
This love just won't let me be
Shit, when I look into your eyes, talk about reverie
Ooh, how I tremble at the sight of your eyes
I just what to know what you see
Know you don't care, you continue to dare, me to be free

Come to me,
Come along, come along and I'll give you all that you need
Love XYZ, love
And I'll give you all that you need
(Give me all that I need)
Love XYZ, love
Say you never leave, say you never leave, say you never leave
Ooh baby, love me til I can't tell no more
Love me til I can't take no more
