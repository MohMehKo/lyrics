She's got love in her eyes for you
Why you actin' so surprised
You know what you're doin', yeah
She's got a feelin' in fire
You gotta keep that alive, won't you
Might not get it all back More and more and more
You feel it risin' like a storm
The winds are roaring in
More and more and more
You feel it closer than before
Now there's no goin' back
Maybe I should open up and say it
I really love you
You know I [?] it and waited
And that's why I love you
Roses supposed to grow here
And the flowers bloom after the cold clears
Give a lil turn, your heart will then open
And when the flowers grow I will be yours then
