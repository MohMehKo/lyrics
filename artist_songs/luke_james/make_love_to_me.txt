[Verse:]
Stuck in the moment,
Caught in an instant,
Seconds are eternity.
But filled with nothin' but pleasure,
That's what it is girl, When you play this game with me.

[Bridge:]
Now I got your body doing things
That you weren't aware you could, yeah.
Now, I don't know a lot of things, but I know what I do good.
I'm trying to tell you..

[Hook:]
I know you've made love before,
Of that I'm sure indeed.
But you ain't made no love, girl,
'Til you've made love to me.

Make love to me baby, make love to me girl.
[2x]

[Verse:]
Temperature-- risin'.
Heart rate-- increasin'.
Hearing you breathe heavily.
Let me explore your body,
Every position,
I'll show you everything, baby

[Bridge:]
And I got your body doing things
That you weren't aware it could.
Now baby, I don't know everything, but I know what I do good.
I'm trying to tell you..

[Hook:]
I know you've made love before,
Of that I'm sure indeed.
But you ain't made no love, girl,
'Til you've made love to me.

Make love to me baby, make love to me girl.
