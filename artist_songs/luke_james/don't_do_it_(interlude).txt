[Intro:]
Don't do it, pretty girl, so what ya doin'?
Don't do it, pretty girl, so what ya doin'?
Don't do it, pretty girl, so what ya doin'?

[Verse:]
I walk outside and to my surprise
A pretty girl standin' there with some thick ass thighs
Oh my, oh my
So I stepped out to her and said what's your side?
She said it's gon' be yo, you know it's gon' be a very good time
Alright, yah, alright
To make a long story short, that girl drove me blind
But I learned a good lesson at the end of the night
Alright, alright, wow

[Chorus: x2]
Don't do it, pretty girl, so what ya doin'?
Don't do it, pretty girl, so what ya doin'?
Don't do it, pretty girl, so what ya doin'?
Don't do it...
