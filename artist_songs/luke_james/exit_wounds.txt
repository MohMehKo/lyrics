[Verse 1:]
I slept on your side of the bed yesterday
I don't understand why I can't forget you
I know I messed up when I missed your birthday
We both broke the code
Didn't think I'd ever see you go

[Bridge 1:]
I wonder if you ever loved me
Cause if you did why be so cold
I hope you know...

[Chorus:]
This 'ain't a heart it's just an exit wound
That just won't close
My brain is scarred each time I let you through
You left a hole
Stole my smile
And all that I've got left of you are these exit wounds

[Hook:]
Well, fuck you
You can leave with everything you came with
All that shit about me you was sayin' (Well, fuck you)
Everything you are today you made it
Can't believe I fell for all your fake shit (Well, fuck you)

[Verse 2:]
I'm kinda glad that it's over I found
A better half I hope that hurts you
I heard you moved back to New Orleans somehow
We spoke on the phone
Asking me where we went wrong

[Bridge 2:]
You wonder if I, ever loved you
Cause if I did, why be so cold?
I hope you know...

[Chorus:]
This 'ain't a heart it's just an exit wound
That just won't close
My brain is scarred each time I let you through
You left a hole
Stole my smile
And all that I've got left of you are these exit wounds

[Break:]
Tried to stitch it up
Had no luck
Keep bleeding out for love

[Bridge 1:]
I wonder if you ever loved me
Cause if you did why be so cold
I hope you know...

[Chorus:]
This 'ain't a heart it's just an exit wound
That just won't close
My brain is scarred each time I let you through
You left a hole
Stole my smile
And all that I've got left of you are these exit wounds

[Hook/Outro:]
Well, fuck you!
You can leave with everything you came with
All that shit about me you was sayin' (Well, fuck you)
Everything you are today you made it
Can't believe I fell for all your fake shit (Well, fuck you)
