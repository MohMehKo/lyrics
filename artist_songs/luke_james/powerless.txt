Are you dreaming?
Are you awake?
Take your time to let me know
When it is, that you will wonder why
Are you dead?
Are you alive?
Contemplate your limitations
Maybe you'll find a motive to try
Show me all that you can do
It's only where you'll go
It's only a matter of time
Before you decide to glow
Are you prepared?
Are you still wondering?
Ready or not it's time to go
And it's time to start accepting my hope
Are you faithful?
Are you losing your pride?
As everyone races up to the top
You'll be the only one bound by a rope
Show me all that you can do
It's only where you'll go
It's only a matter of time
Before you decide to glow
