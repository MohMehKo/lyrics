Yeah
Wow

[Verse 1:]
Since the beginning
Your love was always given
Mmm
And just like my favorite wine it gets better after time
Ooo yeeaah
Baby I want this forever never end
I promise that I won't stop loving
You give me a reason to live right
Won't find nothing better in this life
And every time needed you
You always knew the right thing to do
Ooo yeeaah
I'll owe you forever
I'll owe you forever

[Chorus:]
For all the love you give to me
How could I ever repay
IOU (iou, iou)
For everything you've done for me
How could I ever repay
IOU (iou, iou)

[Verse 2:]
Honey dipped kisses
You grant all my wishes
You rescued me in the nick of time
You saved my like woah ooo
Ooo (ooo)
Baby ain't nobody else in my vision
Only loving you is my mission
You give me a reason to live right
Won't find nothing better in this life
And when the rain is pouring down
You came and cleared my grey clouds
Ooo yeeaah
I'll owe you forever
I'll owe you forever

[Chorus]

[Breakdown:]
I'm forever in your debt
Couldn't have done it without your help
I love you and don't you forget it (Mmm)
Maybe even more than I love myself oooh
(After everything that we've been through)
There's nothing that I just won't do
Cause I owe
IOU

[Chorus]
