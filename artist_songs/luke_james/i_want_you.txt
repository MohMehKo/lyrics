It's crazy how your heart just has a mind of it's own, yeah, yeah
Like when it smiled and makes the choice on it's own, mhm
Well the funny thing about this heart of mine
It knows what it wants
But see the crazy thing is
My mind tries to deny it
But girl I can't fight what I know, I know
I want you baby, you
I want you baby, you

Before I met you girl I never knew my heart could dance, hey, hey
Yeah, listen
I was just a broken record of one night stands
Until you came along, with your beautiful song
You saved me, you saved me, you saved me
And now the funny thing about it
There's no melody without it
I found music when I found you
So hear me when I say
I want you baby, you
I want you baby, you

See I've waited all my life
For someone like you, someone like you, whoa
And nobody, nobody, nobody else will do
Because I want you baby, you
I want you baby, you, you
Hey, yeah, you baby, yeah
I want you, I want you, nobody but you baby
Yeah, baby you, nobody but you girl, you
I want you baby, nobody but you
Nobody but you
I want you, baby
I want you, I want you
