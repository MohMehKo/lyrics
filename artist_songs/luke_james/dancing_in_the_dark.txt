Look at who we are
'Ain't it wonderful
Strangers in the dark
'Ain't it beautiful
Let go of what we know
I'm learning more and more
Let's just keep them all
I know you've got the glow (Oh baby)

Cause we're dancing in the dark again
In the dark again
We're dancing in the dark again
In the dark again
And it feels so good
When I lay you down
Dancing in the dark again
In the dark again

Look at where we are
Far from what we know
I'm reaching for the parts
You're afraid to show (Show me baby)
Just let your love come down
Let it overflow
What you're feeling now
No you're not alone (Not alone)

Cause we're dancing in the dark again
In the dark again
We're dancing in the dark again
In the dark again
And it feels so good
When I lay you down
Dancing in the dark again (So good)
In the dark again

Cause we're dancing in the dark again
In the dark again
We're dancing in the dark again
In the dark again
And it feels so good
When I lay you down
Dancing in the dark again
In the dark again
