Laid up on this cloud with you 
Never been this high before 
What is this...you got me on
Whatever it is, I want more

She said Now that's that good that'll get you bout it
That's that good that'll get you out it
Free your mind... 

Strawberry Vapors 
Oooo
Strawberry Vapors 
Oooo Oooo Oooo 
Strawberry Vapors 
Oooo Oooo Oooo Oooo

All in the sky 
Intermission sparks an intellectual rain of thoughts 
Like if the moon controls the tide of the sea 
and we're made up of 70 does it rule us 

I got her thinking 
All this talking to ya, must be a karma sutra 
You all up in my mind, I'm all up in yours and it's alright 
Wow, what fun 
I hope this feeling never dies, oh I
She said, hold up, hit it one more time
Oo I, Do it, love it 

Strawberry Vapors 
Oooo
Strawberry Vapors 
Oooo Oooo Oooo 
Strawberry Vapors

Strawberry Vapors 
Oooo Oooo Oooo 
Strawberry Vapors

Strawberry Vapors 
Oooo Oooo Oooo 
Strawberry Vapors 

All in the sky 
Vapors 
All in the sky 
Vapors 
All in the sky 
Vapors 
All in the sky
