Me fucking you feels like nobody else
My love for you melts through your chastity belt
Feels so good so warm
Though I know I'm causing you harm

Mo better blues
Playing for you
I know that I gotta choose
There's just things about you I can't lose
Mo better blues

Your so cute love what you've got on
The cool in you turns me on
So different too you're so much more fun baby yeah
That downtown street walking that, art sparks what we're talkin'
Now we're upstairs in my loft apartment
Red... red light, (I love this) red light turns to blue
Now I'm loving you

Mo better blues
Singing that shit to you
I know that I got to choose
But the both of you get me through
Mo better blues ohhhh

Mo better blues
Singing to you
I know that I got to choose
But what if I ain't ready to
Well, mo better blues

Hmmm together together don't take that away
