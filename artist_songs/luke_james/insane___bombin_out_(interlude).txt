Wow

Da Da Da [x4]

Crying eyes 
Serves as a reminder
Of an old too familiar town
You and I know it all too well
In morning light 
We take off all the blinders
And the truth comes rushing in
And we're back to where it ends

How can we want something so bad
But so bad for us
I guess it's one of those things we'll never know yeah
Some people they tell me
The heart wants what it wants
But I think its just too stupid
To know when it's time to let go

It's insane for you to need me
It's so vain for you to try
And it's a shame cause I know you're gonna walk away
The minute that I tell a lie
It's insane for you to come back
It's profane to say it's love
Because the only thing sicker
Than waiting on love that never comes
Is waiting on love that never was...

Da Da Da [x4]
Sleepless nights
Remind us that we're human 
And the streak of sleeping alone
Is not a record that we want to own
So we say it's alright
If we practice risky judgement
But to keep from being alone
We go back where we don't belong oh no

How can we want something so bad
But so bad for us
I guess it's one of those things we'll never know yeah
Some people they tell me
The heart wants what it wants
But I think its just too stupid
To know when it's time to let go

It's insane for you to need me
It's so vain for you to try
And it's a shame cause I know you're gonna walk away
The minute that I tell a lie
It's insane for you to come back
It's profane to say it's love
Because the only thing sicker
Than waiting on love that never comes
Is waiting on love that never was...

So why when I call it quits
Do you turn around and fight for it
And why when you tell me it's lost
Do I fight like never before
I'm trying to forget you
What the hell
you know I don't mean the things I say
I just want you to stay with me

It's insane for you to need me
It's so vain for you to try
And it's a shame cause I know you're gonna walk away
The minute that I tell a lie
It's insane for you to come back
It's profane to say it's love
Because the only thing sicker
Than waiting on love that never comes
Is waiting on love that never was...
