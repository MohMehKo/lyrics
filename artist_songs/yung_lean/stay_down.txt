Way up
Way up
Some up

[Hook:]
I'm rollin' blowin away, the days are the same
10 pills in my pocket, I keep blowin' my faith
R-r-rollin' down the window, white widow, fuck fame
Forest fire, climbin' higher, real life, it can wait
I'm rollin' blowin away, the days look the same
10 pills in my pocket, I keep blowin' my faith
R-r-rollin' down the window, white widow, fuck fame
Forest fire, climbin' higher, real life, it can wait

I gotta stay down, stay down, stay down
I guess I gotta stay down, stay down, stay down
Forever, I'll be around, around, around
Forever, I'll be around, around someway up

Nitrous oxide, I've seen the world collide
I lost count of all the times, she ask me why
Ma-ma-magic in her eyes, Leandoer's paradise
All my, all my, boys off drugs, I've been lost in this life
Fire flames, color red, 'member recent times
Stacks of shoes, got soo many, don't really the 'mount
When it's hot outside, I copped me some ice
Travel in disguise, I see trouble in her eyes
Mix it with fanta, not with sprite, wings from Calvin Klein
Forever I'll fly, all the times I remind, cause some way...
Way high up in the sky
I got a white shirt and a tangerine belt
In a winter where the snow don't melt
Cause I keep to myself
Cause I keep to myself

I'm rollin' blowin away, the days are the same
10 pills in my pocket, I keep blowin' my faith
R-r-rollin' down the window, white widow, fuck fame
Forest fire, climbin' higher, real life, it can wait
I'm rollin' blowin away, the days look the same
10 pills in my pocket, I keep blowin' my faith
R-r-rollin' down the window, white widow, fuck fame
Forest fire, climbin' higher, real life, it can wait
I'm rollin' blowin away, the days are the same
10 pills in my pocket, I keep blowin' my faith
Rubber, rollin' down the window, white widow, fuck fame
Forest fire, climbin' higher, real life, it can wait

I gotta stay down, stay down, stay down
I guess I gotta stay down, stay down, stay down
Forever, I'll be around, around, around
Forever, I'll be around, around someway up
