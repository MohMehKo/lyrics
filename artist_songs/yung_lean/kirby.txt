My watch, my ring
Post up with drugs, with xans
I'm falling in love, Kirby my drank
Money on deck, meet me in the back

We mixing and pouring the drink
Leandoer fuck what you think
I'm Mindfucking these girls like a shrink
Cannes, Cannon, my balls make you sink
I'm flipping the pack, money pink
SBE in this bitch I got stink
Came thru with a rug and a mink
I'm geeking, my Balmains all pink
White arm, smoking dope, make it stink
They call me up when I link
Bitch I just left in flight
I'm falling I'm falling on sight
I think that she might be my type
Prada shades on my face I'm alright
My chain black and my diamonds white
Fuck the fame and the hype
Lean

My watch, my ring
Post up with drugs, with xans
I'm falling in love, Kirby in my drank
Money on deck, meet me in the back
My watch, my ring
Pass me the drugs, and xans
I'm falling in love, Kirby my drank
Money on deck, meet me in the back
