I can buy you lemonade, buy you drugs

Coke up in the swisher switching lanes like switching pictures
[?] stitches
Turn into the neatest riches
Hand around the shoulder I see neon kisses
I'm balling, balling [?]
Till my hand starts twitching, twitching
Y'all think I'm so weird, I ain't really human I'm revered
Couldn't give less fucks about my career
Posted in a spaceship showing no fear
No one heard about Lean a month ago, ago
I was in my bedroom making music, yo
I make no sense, I make nonsense
Should've played in the window from my Benz
Stunting all you haters, I jumped over the fence
Jumped over the chase, jumped up the top of her
With my AK-47 in the face
Take you back to heaven, it's a race
Counting stacks, smoking [?]
Bey Bey-blades [?]

I can buy you lemonade, I can buy you drugs
Arizona tears, Arizona tears
Arizona tears, Arizona tears

Blood tears on my face all I've got is excalibur
Shawty ain't gonna slide through, how the fuck I'm gonna die for her
Coke up in the swisher switching lanes like switching pictures
[?] stitches
Turn into the neatest riches
Hand around the shoulder I see neon kisses
I'm balling, balling [?]
Till my hand starts twitching, twitching
