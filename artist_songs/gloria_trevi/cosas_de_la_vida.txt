I wake up to me very nervous,
in my quarter there is a shade,
he is a face thief cusca that approaches
and that touches I to me I say
to him does not take
allara my stock market over
there to me its sight is dangerous
says that it wants another thing.
if it wants something but that the
awakener brings roses suddenly
to me wakes up to me in the opportune
thing and with fury
I burst it against the
floor in a second.

things, things, things, things,
things of the life, things that happen to us,
things that you do not enjoy, things that escape

to you. of a single jump I rise is
no soap and vain they are not
going to give the 7 to me and
quarter will arrive behind
schedule at the work finally I
arrive at office the head whom that
sees and it shouts, raises the quarter that
puts to me yet and a
notebook. it tweaks
to me by back and I do not think to leave,
and confucion did one to me me
para the heart that we have relation
or looks for positioning

things of the life, things that happens to us,
things that you do not enjoy, things that escape to you.

and I leave walking tendre that
to look for work I
watch for all sides in the
corner are tacos and
ahunque almost knows
to dog the taquero sees me ugly so
that I do not bring money,
but it says a secret to me I can pay
to you with a single kiss, the taquero bigoton,
of trancazo callus I put legs in
action and me subi in a truck.

wants all the lesson that puts
MB to me if it is that I behave well,

experiment in the sexual education

to me to reprobate then I do not
teach anything I am wanted
to escape I am frightened, that dira sucks,
that dira people, wanted to find
to alguin different. the advice who
I give them, podria not to be better,
takes care of either their situation,
by or of the nation
