Hey
I'm over trying to hide these feelings
Hey
You could put your fears aside because
He don't understand baby like I can
Let's not hold back anymore

[Chorus:]
I can't help myself
I'll be your best mistake
There might be someone else
I want you anyway
Throw all your caution to the wind
Open the door and let me in
I can't help myself
Lets make your best mistake.
(I can't help myself, ohhh oh ohhhh)

Hey
I think we've had enough of waiting
What do you say
We make up for lost time
So just come over
I'll pull you closer
Lets not hold back anymore

[Chorus:]
I can't help myself
I'll be your best mistake
There might be someone else
I want you anyway
Throw all your caution to the wind
Open the door and let me in
I can't help myself
Let's make your best mistake
(I can't help myself ohhh, oh, ohhh I can't help myself ohhh)

We could run, we could run, we could run away
Baby come, baby come, baby come with me
Baby just you and I, ohhhh
Take a chance, take a chance, take a chance tonight
Leave it all, leave it all, leave it all behind
We only got one life, ohhhh

[Chorus:]
I can't help myself
I'll be your best mistake
There might be someone else
I want you anyway
Throw all your caution to the wind
Open the door and let me in
I can't help myself
Let's make your best mistake

(I can't help myself ohh woahhh oh) [x4]
