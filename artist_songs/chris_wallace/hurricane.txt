I opened my eyes
To the wreckage all around me
Look what you've done
Don't know why, you left without warning
Just a hit and run

Now I'm taking back all my love you stole
Erasing you baby
Got to get my mind right
Got to take control
Before I go crazy

You hit me like a hurricane
You know you got me spinning round and round
I brought you through it all the way
And you tried to take me down, down, down, down.
You thought you could bend me, break me
But I'm only stronger now (only stronger now)
Yeah, you hit me like a hurricane
But you'll never take me down, down, down, down

I was lost
Just caught up in the chaos
I was so far gone
I see it now
There was nothing that could save us
So I'm moving on
Now I'm taking back all my love you stole
Erasing you baby
Got to get my mind right
Got to take control
Before I go crazy

You hit me like a hurricane
You know you got me spinning round and round
I brought you through it all the way
And you tried to take me down, down, down, down.
You thought you could bend me, break me
But I'm only stronger now (only stronger now)
Yeah, you hit me like a hurricane
But you'll never take me down, down, down, down

You hit me like a hurricane (a hurricane)

I'm over it
Its overdue
Cause the worst part of me I left with you
I don't want you back
Don't care what you say
All the wreckage that you left
You know, I threw it away

You hit me like a hurricane
You know you got me spinning round and round
I brought you through it all the way
And you tried to take me down, down, down, down.
You thought you could bend me, break me
But I'm only stronger now (only stronger now)
Yeah, you hit me like a hurricane
But you'll never take me down, down, down, down
You hit me like a hurricane.
