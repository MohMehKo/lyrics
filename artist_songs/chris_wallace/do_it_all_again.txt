The walls are opening
I can finally breathe again
I finally noticed 
You were in front of me all along
The rain has washed me clean
I'm feeling you on my skin
I finally let you in
Feels like I'm home in your arms

I don't even know where I'm going
But I know where I've been
I couldn't believe I found love
But I found you again
And all that I know is
Gonna do it all again
Lift me up, pull me out of the fire
Lift me up, take me higher and higher
Baby we'll do it all again

Cuz you're like gravity
You constantly pull me near
Been lucky to have you here
I'm lucky to stand in your light
Don't ever wake me from this dream
There's nowhere I'd rather be
Hopelessly endlessly
You make me feel so alive

I don't even know where I'm going
But I know where I've been
I couldn't believe I found love
But I found you again
And all that I know is
We're gonna do it all again
Lift me up, pull me out of the fire
Lift me up, take me higher and higher
Baby we'll do it all again
Lift me up, pull me out of the fire
Lift me up, take me higher and higher
Baby we'll do it all again

The walls are opening
I can finally breathe again

And I don't even know where I'm going
But I know where I've been
I couldn't believe I found love
But I found you again
And all that I know is
We're gonna do it all again
Lift me up, pull me out of the fire
Lift me up, take me higher and higher
Baby we'll do it all again
Lift me up, pull me out of the fire
Lift me up, take me higher and higher
Baby we'll do it all again
