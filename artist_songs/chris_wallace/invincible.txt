Some days you can't wait to wake up
Some days you wanna lay right back down
Some days your middle finger is up
Some days you wanna throw it all away now

After the storm is gone
The sunlight shows you the way
Follow your heart
Let's go and dream out loud
Gotta look inside
Won't believe what you will find out

I see explosions in the sky
Just like the fire in your eyes
Let's live like we're running out of time

When they tell you it's wrong and you know that it's right
Cause your dreams are in and it starts tonight
Oh, you're invincible
Oh, you're invincible

When they try to tell you how to live your life
Just close your eyes, spread your wings and fly
Oh, you're invincible
Oh, you're invincible

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
You are invincible

Walks off and talk can be a beep
Walk tall and you become the moment
Walk in and tell them what you think
Walk out in a blaze of glory
So it goes
We get to used to the way that it is right now
And so this time
We need to put it all on the line

I see explosions in the sky
Just like the fire in your eyes
Let's live like we're running out of time

When they tell you it's wrong and you know that it's right
Cause your dreams are in and it starts tonight
Oh, you're invincible
Oh, you're invincible

When they try to tell you how to live your life
Just close your eyes, spread your wings and fly
Oh, you're invincible
Oh, you're invincible

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

When they tell you it's wrong
And you that it's right
Oh oh
Remember you are invincible

When they tell you it's wrong and you know that it's right
Cause your dreams are in and it starts tonight
Oh, you're invincible
Oh, you're invincible

When they try to tell you how to live your life
Just close your eyes, spread your wings and fly
Oh, you're invincible
Oh, you're invincible
