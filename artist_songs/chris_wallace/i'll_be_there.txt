When you're feeling lost and broken down
When you want to scream
But can't make a sound
And you're feeling out of place
I know, we've all been down that road
It's all about the fire in your eyes
It's all about the people in your life
It's all about the love, you know
And it's all about to change
It's all about to change

When ever it starts to get a little too crazy
Open up your eyes
I'll be there when you need me
Baby, I'll be there
I'll be there when you need me
I'll be there when you call
I'll be there
I'll be there
I'll be there
I'll be there

It's not about the things you haven't done
It's not about the wars you fought and wish you could have won
You're feeling out of place, I know
And it's all about to change
It's all about to change

When ever it starts to get a little too crazy
Open up your eyes
I'll be there when you need me
Baby, I'll be there
I'll be there when you need me
I'll be there when you call
I'll be there
I'll be there
I'll be there

When it all falls apart
And when you lose it in the dark
I'll be there
I'll be there
I'll be there
