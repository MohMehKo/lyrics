I'm sitting with an empty glass and a broken heart,
Thinking to myself what have I done,
Cause as my future got bright we started losing light,
And I couldn't see that you were the one,

So can we push push push rewind,
Go go back in time,
When we were kids sneaking bottles of wine,
Take take take me back, I wanna go back,
Back to what we had! Do you remember when we started this mess,
My heart was beating out of my chest!,
Remember when we stole your dad's car,
I never thought we'd take it that far,
Oh we were flying so high, yeah partners in crime,
So why'd we ever say good bye?,
Remember when we, when we, had it all
Do you remember when...

Wish I was still the only one running cross your mind,
I guess I just wanted you to know
Oh from your ruby lips to your fingertips,
I can't believe I let you go,

So can we push push push rewind,
Go go back in time,
When we were kids sneaking bottles of wine,
Take take take me back, I wanna go back,
Back to what we had! Do you remember when we started this mess,
My heart was beating out of my chest!,
Remember when we stole your dad's car,
I never thought we'd take it that far,
Oh we were flying so high, yeah partners in crime,
So why'd we ever say good bye?,
Remember when we, when we, had it all
Do you remember when...

I'm hanging by a thread,
I'm tearing at the seams,
Holding on to what we used to be! and I should let you go...
But I just won't give up up up up up up up!

Push push push rewind,
Go go back in time,
When we were kids sneaking bottles of wine,
Take take take me back, I wanna go back,
Back to what we had! Do you remember when we started this mess,
My heart was beating out of my chest (my heart was beating out of my chest!)
Remember when we stole your dad's car,
I never thought we'd take it that far,
And we were flying so high, yeah partners in crime,
So why'd we ever say good bye?,
Remember when we, when we, had it all!
Do you remember when?
