There's a storm raging through our window
But you don't want to look outside
There's a crack in this perfect picture
I don't know how to make it right.

Our love is a time bomb ticking
And there's nowhere to go.
We're just a time bomb ticking
About to explode 

Baby just walk away
I'm not strong enough to let you go
Just walk away
Even though it feels like we got so close
Baby believe me there's no other way
I'm hiding the tears running down my face
Just walk away
Walk away

There's a voice screaming in my head now
Maybe there's no turning back
Cause I know that we've lost our way
Like a train running off the tracks

Our love is a time bomb ticking
And there's nowhere to go
We're just a time bomb ticking
About to explode 

Baby just walk away
I'm not strong enough to let you go
Just walk away
Even though it feels like we got so close
Baby believe me there's no other way
I'm hiding the tears running down my face
Just walk away
Walk away

(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)

We'll never make it
To see the daylight
The fuse is burning up
Burning up in the sky tonight
I see the countdown
We've got to get out now, now, now

Cause our love is a time bomb ticking
And there's nowhere to go
We're just a time bomb ticking
About to explode 

Baby just walk away
I'm not strong enough to let you go
Just walk away
Even though it feels like we got so close
Baby believe me there's no other way
I'm hiding the tears running down my face
Just walk away
Walk away
