My heart was in pieces
Didn't think it'd ever stop bleedin'
Had nothin' to believe in
You came along and I started breathin'

Now I'm on the edge
Looking down
It's makin' more sense to me
You make me wanna just let go
Hold you close
I just want you to see...

[Chorus:]
I'm ready to fall
I'm ready to fly
I'm ready to give, us a try
I'm ready to live
I'm ready to learn
I'm ready to lose it all
You got me singin'
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah
I'm ready to fall
I'm ready to lose it all
I'm ready to fall

Your eyes are like diamonds
Lightin' up the sky they're shinnin'
You have that, that somethin'
More and more each day I'm findin'

That I'm on the edge
No turnin' back
It's makin' more sense to me
It's like you've been there
All along
I open my eyes and see

[Chorus:]
I'm ready to fall
I'm ready to fly
I'm ready to give, us a try
I'm ready to live
I'm ready to learn
I'm ready to lose it all
You got me singin'
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah
I'm ready to fall
I'm ready to lose it all
I'm ready to fall

I'm ready to fall

Now I'm on the edge, looking down...

[Chorus:]
I'm ready to fall
I'm ready to fly
I'm ready to give, us a try
I'm ready to live
I'm ready to learn
I'm ready to lose it all
You got me singin'
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah
I'm ready to fall
I'm ready to lose it all
I'm ready to fall
