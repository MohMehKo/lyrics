Oh, ohhhh, ohhh, ohhhhh,

You were an angel on the run that I caught somehow
I tried so hard to figure you out.
But baby you're a pretty little mystery
That makes no sense to me

You got me stayin' up all night, burnin' inside
The voices in my head won't quit
I may be losin' my mind and goin' insane
But I put up with your... Ha ha

And it's a wild ride
Every single night
Even the worst of times
Are the best of times
Got me singin'

Sunday dinner with a bottle of Jack
Drive around town, like a heart attack
Baby you're a mess, but it's meant to be
'Cause you keep me crazy
Tell me you love me and everything's alright
57 seconds and you start a fight
Baby somehow you're the one I need
'Cause you keep me crazy (keep me crazy)

Another little fight you say you're done
We'll see about that when the mornin' comes
'Cause first you're out then you're right back in
Here we go again

And it's a wild ride,
Every single night
Even the worst of times
Are the best of times
You got me singin'

Sunday dinner with a bottle of Jack
Drive around town, like a heart attack
Baby you're a mess, but it's meant to be
'Cause you keep me crazy
Tell me you love me and everything's alright
57 seconds for you to start a fight
Baby somehow you're the one I need
'Cause you keep me crazy

Oh you keep me crazy
So much that I want more
You're just the lunatic I've been lookin' for
Oh you keep me crazy
So much that I want more
You're just the lunatic I've been lookin' for

(Are we really gonna do this right now?
Baby, I'm sorry, it's my fault, alright?
Come on, it's really, it's really my fault)
