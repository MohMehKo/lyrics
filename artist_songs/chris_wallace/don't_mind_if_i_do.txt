The sun don't shine unless I see your face
The moon don't rise until you come my way
I just want you standing right beside me
Every single day

There ain't no water in the deep blue sea
There ain't no distance keeping you from me
Without you every second lasts forever
But forever doesn't mean a thing 
If I can't see those

Diamonds in you eyes
That sundress in July
Don't mind if I do
Don't mind if I do
And just one simple glance
No, I don't stand a chance
I'm falling for you
Don't mind if I do

Whisper your thoughts to me secretly
You're the sweetest little symphony
Baby when you're coming my direction
I get this feeling taking over me
Cause I can see those

Diamonds in your eyes
That sundress in July
Don't mind if I do
Don't mind if I do
And just one simple glance
No, I don't stand a chance
I'm falling for you
Don't mind if I do

So when it's raining and the sun don't shine
And you'll need shelter from the bitter night
I will be there standing right beside you
There ain't a damn thing that I wouldn't do
Just to, just to see those

Diamonds in your eyes
That sundress in July
Don't mind if I do
Don't mind if I do
And just one simple glance
No, I don't stand a chance
I'm falling for you
Don't mind if I do

Don't mind if I do
Don't mind if I do

Don't mind if I do
Don't mind if I do
