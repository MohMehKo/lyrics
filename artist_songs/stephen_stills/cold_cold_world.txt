I been burned
By a cold empty fire
I been turned and led astray
But you learn
When you deal with a liar
It's a cold cold world
Cold world when it's
Your friends

I bee taken
Down a blind street
I been shaken and led astray
You awaken
With a bad bad feelin'
It's a cold cold world
When it's your friends

You might listen you might
Not it don't bother me
You won't know till the
Time catches up with you
Can't you see how close I'm
Watching you

Feel like dirt
They've taken my pride
And what's worse
I've been so betrayed
And it hurts you deep down inside
It's a cold cold world
Cold world, when it's your friends

You know trust is so hard to give
But you must or you're gonna be alone
When you're dust it just should not be
That it was a cold cold world
Cold world... cold cold world...
In the end
