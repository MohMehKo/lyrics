Live in a dream
You've got everything you need
But it still hurts inside
The way she led you to believe
All those vicious lies

She told you some things
Same lines she's told me before
But she'll win your trust
Then she'll walk over you
Leave your soul lyin' in the dust

And I know it's so hard to believe
The same thing happened to me
You'll just have to see for yourself
But that woman, she thinks of herself
And nobody else

I finally got mine and now I'm gone
I hope you get yours
'Cause it won't be wrong
What you see is what you get

What you see is what you get
What you see is what you get
What you see is what you get
What you see is what you get
What you see is what you get
