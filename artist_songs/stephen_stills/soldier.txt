Soldier, soldier, soldier
Stucked in an hospital ward
Living in a wheelchair
Do you remember the war?

It's not over
It'll never be over for you
It's not over
Till they quit playing war with you
Soldier, soldier

Do you remember who found you
The helicopter crew
Out of the Au Shan Valley
What could they do

It's not over
It'll never be over for you
It's not over
Till they quit playing war with you
Soldier, soldier

Was anybody with you
When you felt your body die
Knowing that you live on
The shell of a man to hide

It's not over
It'll never be over for you
It's not over
Till they quit playing God with you
Soldier, soldier
Soldier, soldier
