Drawn to a flame
She is far away, out of reach
Will she burn her wings? I can only watch
Out of touch, out of my mind

Wish I could tell if she's alright, feeling fine
Lucky for me I'm not a jealous man
Out of hand, out of my mind

When this love is over, start again
Find a new friend, fall in love again

Get yourself high someone
And then wave goodbye, don't you cry
Go ahead break your heart
But don't fall apart
It's like saying goodbye
To Paris for the first time
