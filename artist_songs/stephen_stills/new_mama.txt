New mama's got a son
In her eyes
No clouds are in my changing skies
Each morning when I
Get up to rise
I'm livin' in a dreamland

Changing times
Ancient reasons
That turn to lies
Throw them all away
Head in hand
Gift of wonders to
Understand
And open all the way

New mama's got a son
In her eyes
No clouds are in my changing skies
Each morning when I
Get up to rise
I'm livin' in a dreamland
