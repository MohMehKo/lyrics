Somewhere out yonder
Mystery
Cain't nothing but wonder how it got free
It's a spell I'm under
But you all want a piece of me

Come out of the shadow
Which you do tell
Go a-dream out ya river
Into a wishing well (yeah)

What y'all think I need
All want a piece of me
Like I am

Don't you know it's a hunger
I can't stay away
There's a sigh and a thunder
Needs playing
Know where I'll be
Every last piece of me

Can I be excused
It's my guitar phone
Thinking what I will use
To get the cool tone
Might get you pay
If you just fade away
Go get on
