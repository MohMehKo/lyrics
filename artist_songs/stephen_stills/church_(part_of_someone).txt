You see, it's my thing to be part of someone
As a true friend is part of me you know that there's so much
Oh, little girl, we've got to tell each other about the whole world
And most especially one another, oh yeah, all right
And you know, and you know?

And it's hard, yes it is it's hard, yes it is
And I wonder
I wonder could it be a dream?
Oh yes

And you know that the self made man, babe
Is truly shallow he knows he's no one but who he wants to be
So while you still sing, baby you got to tell me, baby
Is it your thing to be part of anyone anyone, anyone?
Oh

And it's hard, yes it is it's hard, yes it is
And I wonder
Yes I wonder could it be a dream?
Oh one time right now

And it's hard, yes it is it's hard, yes it is
And I wonder
I wonder if it's a dream
Oh now one more time

And it's hard, yes it is it's hard, yes it is
And I wonder
And I wonder children, could it be a dream?
