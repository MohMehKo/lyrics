To forget about lovin' you at all is beyond me
I cannot understand, yeah
Here without you is loneliness
I called out in desperation
Give me back your hand

I can't believe I've heard you say forever
It may be my naivete
But life is real and not a play
Together we will go on

And I have not the faintest glimmer of the past
And tomorrow will come and go away
And my heart is broken but will last
My spirit cries out to you for space
It is good can you feel it, it is strong cannot defeat it
And I don't believe you've gone away

Don't believe I've heard you say forever
It may be my naivete
But life is real and not a play
Together we will go on

And as my future grows darker every day
I can't help wonderin' how you feel
About how high a price we have to pay
Broken dreams, broken hearts that will not heal
And I don't believe you've gone away

Don't believe I heard you say forever
It may be my naivete
But life is real and not a play
Together we will go on
