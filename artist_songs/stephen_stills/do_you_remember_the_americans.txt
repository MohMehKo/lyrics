Standin' by a snow drift in the pale moonlight
Hitchhikin' west on a highway at night
Tryin' to get to Frisco, lookin' for my girl
Here comes a trucker, hope he don't mind long curls

I remember years ago hitchin' this same road
Never saw a trucker leave a man out in the cold
No riders sign on the window, never meant a thing
Nowadays they just roll on lookin' kind of mean

Kind of makes me wonder, scratch my head and kick the snow
Four years of overseas, who are these strangers in my home
Where are the country people does anybody know
Do you remember the Americans, where did they go?

Were they simply bought and sold?
