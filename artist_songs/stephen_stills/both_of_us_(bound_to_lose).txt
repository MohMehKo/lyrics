Why can't you hear me
Why can't you see me
How can you be so blind to this feelin' in my heart

Time is a'waistin'
What have I tasted
Can you turn a deaf ear to my call
Both of us bound to lose
Why do we have to choose
Both of us bound to lose

Now can you hear me
Now can you see me
How do you like the fool when he's down

Is that really how you see me
Just a statue making sounds
The Fallen Eagle
Sing to the fallen eagle

Helicopters fly
Chase him 'round the mountains
Chase him 'til he dies
They say that it's good sportin'
Shootin' him on the wing
Above the roar and clatter
You can hear your rifle sing

His death song
It won't be long
Sing to the western rancher
The eagle takes his lamb
He's got a thousand others
He don't give a damn

Get up with the sunrise
Everybody gather 'round
Kill him with the first shot
He'll turn and bring you down
Down down
Crash on the ground

Sing to the noble eagle
Help is on the way
A government team of experts
Is a'rushin' to your aid
I know your not excited
An eagle is no waif
Fly on up to Canada
This country isn't safe
Anymore
That's for sure
