And it's all in the way you wonder
If you think you're learnin' how
Pick up your feet you don't
Have to pick up a gun
You can prod the sacred cow
You know the song of love
It's empty now
As it always seems

[Chorus:]
To have been
You can go on home
Used to be down to tear gas and clubs
What do you think about grenades
(You know like a frag)
Nonsense is as
Nonsense does
The judge's eagle promenades

[Chorus]

The good book tells us
"Thou shalt not kill"
What is the meaning of this phrase
Is it sometimes right
And sometimes wrong
Depends if you're foolish or brave

[Chorus]
