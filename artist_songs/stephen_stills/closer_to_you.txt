Have you seen
The ladies passing by
They don't seem to notice
That I'm lonesome and I cry
But soon they'll listen
I can tell you, tell you why
Gonna make a record
Gonna go sky high

I just wanna be closer to you
I just wanna see if you can be moved
I don't wanna be a fool for you
Or be alone

Going to the city
All the hustlers in the street
Can't you imagine where
This country boy's head might be
Bright lights are shining
I can see in front of me
At night clockwork deception
Won't save or set us free

I just wanna be closer to you
I just wanna see if you can be moved
I don't wanna be a fool for you
Or be alone

Gonna tour the country
Gonna play for all my friends
Such a positive action
I've got energy to lend
So come on down, we're cookin'
Let the rhythm get you high
Bring all the ladies
Tell them why, why, why

I just wanna be closer to you
I just wanna see if you can be moved
I don't wanna be a fool for you
Or be alone
