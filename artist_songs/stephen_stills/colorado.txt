I am a man I live alone
Don't much bother me. It won't be long
Come a woman who wants to be near
Me and my mountains, we'll be right here
Colorado

Way back east in the dirt and smog
Courted a woman she had a job
Didn't want to leave her adopted home
Guess she was afraid of bein' alone in
Colorado

Way out yonder in tinsel land
Look around hard you might find a real man
Dark-eyed country girl, tears in her eyes
Needs the music of the wind in the pines
Colorado

Many's the time that I've gone astray
The things I'm thinkin' I seldom say
Guess I'm waitin' for that special girl
The one who loves me and loves my world
Colorado
