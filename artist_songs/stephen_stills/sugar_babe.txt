You can do what you want to do
You can be who you want to be
Just remember that me and you
Ain't all there is to bein' free

People need love
People need trust
People need one another
And that means us

My sugar baby
Oh, believe me sugar baby

Everyone knows that it ain't easy
But when you get it all together in your heart
It's the easiest thing to do to be pleasin'
Folks ain't made to live apart

People need love
People need trust
People need one another
And that means us

Oh, sugar babe
You may sing it now sugar baby
Sugar babe
You may sing it now sugar baby

Let yourself be open honey learn to bend
Remember everyone gets scared
But I'm still your best friend
When you forget about yourself
And think of things to do
To make me happy then you love me girl
Like I love you

How do turtles talk to one another
They just look, there's no reason to cower
Just like people they're drawn to each other
They don't live in no ivory tower

People need love
People need trust
People need one another
And that means us

My sugar baby
Come on now sugar baby
You know you hear me sugar baby

Come on sweet Rita
You're my sugar baby
Believe me sugar baby

So close, then again so far away
Where are the answers, I hear them everyday
Lovin' you from a distance
Never did make it anyway
So close, then again so far away
Here come little Miss Bright Eyes
Socking it to me everyday
I got to get next to the girl or I got to get away
