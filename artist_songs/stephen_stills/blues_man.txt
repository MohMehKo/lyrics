Blues man
Play your hand
Do it right
Come on strong
Don't stay too long

Runnin' wild
Singin' child
Powered sound
Push you hard
Lookin' to get down

Such a waste
Y'left such a space
I shared your dreams
I felt your heart
Did I hear you scream

Runnin' scared
Y'run everywhere
Could not choose
Where to hide
Play the blues

Played it mad
Played it sad
Blues is pain
The way men cry
Like tired rain

Blues is mean
The real thing
Three good men
I knew well
Never see again
