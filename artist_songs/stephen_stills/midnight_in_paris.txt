There's a whole lot of magic
When you're in Paris
And I swear I've never seen
So many pretty women go by
And I can't stop from dancing
I'm spinning 'round like a clock
That's wound up too tight

I want to tell you 'bout all I see
Stars in my eyes that you would not believe
I'm a little funky wearin' out my shoes
Don't mean anything unless I'm dancin' with you

Midnight, midnight in Paris
Midnight, midnight in Paris

Donne mois ta main
Si je viens de loin
[Foreign Content]
Si je viens de loin
Moi je prux te parler de ma musique
Et parle moi de toi
Si tu veux me dire un jour bon quelque chose
[Foreign Content]
Si tu veux te sentir un moment comme moi
Tu regarde moi quand je danse avec toi

Midnight, midnight in Paris
Midnight, midnight in Paris

Well, we'll have another bottle
Monsieur Luigi
So we can toast the autumn
Since it's all around
And I'll always remember
Singing in the park when the rain came down

I want to tell you 'bout all I see
Stars in my eyes that you would not believe
I'm a little funky wearin' out my shoes
Don't mean anything unless I'm dancin' with you
Dancin' with you

Midnight, midnight in Paris
Midnight, midnight in Paris

Midnight, midnight in Paris
Midnight, midnight in Paris
When you're in Paris
