Most of my life I have spent alone
Most of this past year I been searchin' for my home
I met a girl she won't leave my mind alone
If she's listening I hope she understands my song
It goes:
If you get lonely
All you gotta
Do is call me

[Chorus:]
I'll come on the run
Wherever you are
No matter how far
Bless my soul I think I'm fallin' again
I hear my woman she is callin' me again
If she needs me I gotta go she's my best friend
Y'see I promised her and I remember what I said
I said:

[Chorus]

Most of this life is such a hard road to go down, go down
Count your blessings on the good friends you got hangin' around
It takes two to be friends it takes two to be lovers
Know you got it made when you got one thats the same as the other
Then you say:
If you get lonely
All you gotta
Do is call me
I come on the run
Wherever you are
No matter how far
