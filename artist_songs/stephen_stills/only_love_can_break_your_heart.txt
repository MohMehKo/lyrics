When you were young and on your own
How did it feel to be alone
I was always thinkin' of games that I was playin'
Tryin' to make the best of my time

But only love can break your heart
Try to be sure right from the start
Yes only love can break your heart
What if your world should fall apart

I have a friend I've never seen
He hides his head inside a dream
Someone should call him and see if he can come out
Try to lose the down that he's found

But only love can break your heart
Try to be sure right from the start
Yes only love can break your heart
What if your world should fall apart

And so my friend if you have seen
The other side of all those dreams
Know that you can take it as far as you would want to
Don't believe the great run around

But only love can break your heart
Try to be sure right from the start
Yes only love can break your heart
What if your world should fall apart
I have a friend I've never seen
He hides his head inside a dream

Yes, only love can break your heart
Yes, only love can break your heart
Yes, only love can break your heart
Yes, only love can break your heart
Yes, only love can break your heart
Yes, only love can break your heart
