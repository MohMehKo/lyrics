All I know is what you tell me
What you tell me, will it help me?
Late at night, in the morning
I’m in mourning in the morning.

At the lonely day, in front of me
Some lady feels I will never say goodbye
Don’t you pity me but if you never say goodbye
It would help me.

All day long, my folks are tumbling
Got me mumbling with the tumbling
I can’t go [?] I search for answers
No one answers ‘cept the dancer.

And she’s lonely girl, the same as me.
