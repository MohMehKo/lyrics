Well, my daddy took me campin'
Out under the stars
Left me by the fire
While he hit the bars
And I broke my finger
On a trailer hitch
Mamma called daddy
That son of a bitch, alright

Well a hundred miles to go
You draggin' your ass
I'm in a Japanese car
That ain't gonna last
And you forever drivin'
On the wrong side of the road
Wearing dungarees
That your mother stole

[Chorus:]
Well my mamma loved me
But my daddy don't
I'm tryin' to work it all out
But I probably won't
I got a woman waiting
At the top of the stairs
It's the wrong thing to do
But I don't care

Well she was blond and tall
She was 23
Brought into the world
To get the best of me
And she never paid back
Half what she stole
She wanted my money
So I gave her my soul

[Chorus]

Well I was flying half mast
On the 4th of July
In a bar in Lake City
With a western tie
And I was thinkin' hard
About changin' my name
And headed for Miami
When the daylight came

[Chorus]
