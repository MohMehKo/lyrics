Maybe it's me but I don't understand what it is that you're so uptight
Could it be I been thinking about what you said to me if I heard it right
I don't believe that you really believe what you're saying at all tonight

I don't get it....
What is this all about
I don't get
Suddenly my love in doubt
I don't get
Wondering can we work it out
I don't get it

I been paying attention and tried my best but I cannot follow
And I have to admit that it's too strange a script for me to swallow
Can't swallow that
Do I know I am only an echo out of the deepest hollow

I don't get it...
In all honesty
I don't get it
None of this is about me
I don't get it
Why you live in misery
I don't get it

I don't get it...
Wondering what you think I see
I don't get it
Cos everything's wrong with me
I don't get it
This ain't no way to be
I don't get it

Acccording to you there's nothing that's true about how we love each other
Hearing about so much you all rather touch and we can go no further
Stop
Baby I know that you're hurting but I got to sit here and watch you suffer

I don't get it....
We got a love to live
I don't get it
Whatever else this is
I don't get it
Now it ain't happening
I don't get it
Used to have so much fun
I don't get it
Now you just changed and run
I don't get it
Confusing to everyone
I don't get it
I can't get it
I don't get it
