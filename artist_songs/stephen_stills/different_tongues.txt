Do you know me, can you tell me so
Do you know how my motivations grow
It's all right that's something you ought to know about me

Are you into being on the line
Facing people one at a time
It's all right that's something you ought to know about me

You ought to know me well enough by now
Watching me growing you are the why and the how
Everything you show me making it so that we
Need each other more and more I'm not exactly altogether sure
That I could handle being left here all alone
I got a house honey and I, I need a home, yeah

We were speaking in different tongues
Still it mattered we did what then was done
It's still all right that's something you ought to know about me

Do you trust me, do you trust yourself
Do you know when it's time to ask for help
It's all right that's something you ought to know
'Cause it has to do with growing
That's something you ought to know about me
