Believin' in you is believin' in me
All the same circle game that makes us feel free
So much behind us so much to do
Some days you eat the bear
Some days the bear eats you

Nothin' to worry 'bout
But the worries
That you make up yourself

Christopher's watching me carefully now
Wonderin' who I am listenin' to the sound
He knows the best and the worst of me now
I don't think I could go on if I let him down

Nothin' to worry 'bout
But the worries
That you make up yourself

So my love do the things you got to do
Never have to be afraid, I'm always with you
Believin' in me and you like Christopher does
Believin' is the magic that makes one from the two of us

Nothin' to worry 'bout
But the worries
That you make up yourself
