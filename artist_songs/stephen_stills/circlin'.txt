Can I tell a people story, it ain't too long
There's very few that can face each other or themselves alone

So we go, circlin', round and about, no way out, no way in
Circlin', hasslin' doubt when you know you can, well all right
Feet, where are you goin', we're just circlin' yeah?

The meaning of a runaround is a circle game
Tellin' lies and bein' jive with the one you love hurt the same

So we go, circlin', round and about, no way out, no way in
Circlin', hasslin' doubt when you know you can, well all right
Feet, where are you goin', we're just circlin' yeah?

Go on, do it, straight ahead, do what you know
The best you can, it's good for your head

Think about all the times you just up and ran
So go on, you got to try, give yourself a hand

Circlin', round and about, no way out, no way in
Circlin', hasslin' doubt when you know you can, well all right
Feet, where are you goin', we're just circlin' yeah?

Do you know that time is only water that we drink
Washes under bridges all eventually they're gonna sink

So we go, circlin', round and about, no way out, no way in
Circlin', hasslin' doubt when you know you can, well all right
Feet, where are you goin', we're just circlin' yeah?
