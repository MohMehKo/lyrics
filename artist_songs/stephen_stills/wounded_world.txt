So you're goin' out on your own
And you're finally leaving home
You'll be alright, just watch out for your spirit
You're gonna find that you're alone
Makin' choices of your own
Like a ship at sea, your life goes where you steer it

It's a wounded world
Full of love and lies
It's a wounded world
But you cannot be denied
If you mean it when you try
In this wounded world

Sometimes, hurtin' bad, you're ready t'give up
Can't help, (can't believe, you know, you) used you like a drug
We had similar adventures, never closed the door
Part of me is part of you
I can't tell you any more
'Bout this wounded world

I don't mean to sound so cynical
But it truly is a miracle
That your heart turned out so good midst all this game child
Put your faith in them that earn it
With your love you will discern it
But don't judge nobody never! out of anger

Well it's a wounded world
Full of love and lies
It's a wounded world
But you cannot be denied
When you mean it, if you try
In this wounded world

It's a wounded world, wounded world
