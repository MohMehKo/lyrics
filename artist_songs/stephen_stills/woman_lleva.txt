Woman, woman
Can I tell you about my girl?
She's lost and gone away
Don't know where she's goin'
Wish she'd come home to stay

Woman, woman, woman, woman
Ese mujer me ha mentido
Como mujer eres ni√±a
Vive en un mundo sin paredes
Inocentemiento no lo crees querida

And when you think of me
Try to remember
All of the good times
And love that was tender
