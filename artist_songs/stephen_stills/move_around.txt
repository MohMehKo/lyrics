What do we do
Given life?
We move around

Solitude
Reach for light
Reach or slide
We move around

One searches
For the sake of searching
Clearly then
Stumbling...
Falling...
Lurching...
We move around

A superb point of reference detected
becomes absurd with a moment's reflection
leaves one a passage of simple thought
not sagging with excess weight of excess baggage
and we move around
We move around

One thinks then sinks
Then stands at a brink
Finds a key
Instincts of revelation
drinking in exaltation
We move...

We move around

No need to prove
No one around
No one but you 
To stand your ground

We move around

Don't you know its all right
To be wrong thus you grow be amused and be strong

The acceptance of error with grace
Is to refuse to be vain and so afraid of losing face
This fear drives one further into what one thinks
To be a race of life or death
Or simply take another breath
Of nature's air now
Which is fair now
Which is to be alive
To move around
