My angel there she goes
Where she comes from
Nobody knows
She came walkin' quiet as a bird, walkin' softly
With a good word

And who was I talkin' to
Soon I must see for myself
New love don't run away
I don't think you understand
How deeply you touch me

My angel callin' me soft and low
Love me gentle I've suffered and
Fallen so low
Can I try and love you best I can
Take good care of you be your man

Who was I talkin' to
Soon she will see for herself
New love don't run away
I think she now understands
How deeply she touches me

My angel will she go
Will she move on
I just don't know
If it happens that
She has to go
I'll be sorry but
I can say that I did know
My angel yes I did
I knew my angel
