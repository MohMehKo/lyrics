Don't put your business in the street
Your brothers and sisters is about all you need
No tellin' who you might meet

It might make you sad
Make you feel mad
Make you blue
What are you gonna do?

The biggest fool of all is me
I play the music for the music you see
For money I do publicity

So I can buy guitars
Put a studio in the backyard
You know what it costs me
To find another key, alright

And when you get a little bit older
You're carryin' too much weight on your shoulder
Share your heavy load, come on over

So we go and see
What you're gonna be
Don't you try too hard
Don't you break your heart

Oh yes, wrong, right
I'm tellin' ya, tell me
Gonna be alright
Gonna be alright
Gonna be alright
