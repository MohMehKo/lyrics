She's a honky tonk angel that
You meet in the night
And she knows how to love you
And make you feel right

She's gonna wave you goodbye
From the back of her bike
She's the wrong reason
For thinkin' you might
Never never love the right girl

She keeps all her deep feelings
Wrapped up real tight
But she is gonna tell you
What she does and don't like

She's a little bit hard
Certainly too tough to fight
She's the wrong reason
For thinkin' you might
Never never love the right girl

When she's around
Your head starts a-spinnin'
And she makes you forget
How you're mostly not winnin'

On a whim this girl
Would never think twice
Of leaving a good man
If another seemed nice
She's the wrong reason
For thinkin' you might
Never love the right girl

When a woman for you
Suddenly shows up my friend
If your head is all messed up
And full of big plans
You're going to miss her completely
And never give her the chance
And you're all the wrong reason
For thinking you can't ever
Ever love the right girl
The right girl
