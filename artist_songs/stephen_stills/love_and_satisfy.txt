Six more days and I'll be gone
Get on the train, it takes me home
That old train where I belong
Home's gonna feel just fine
That old train is gonna move me down the line.

Yes, I know him and you do too
There's a lot he can do for you
He builds you up and bring you down
Plants your feet right back on the ground
You're so mixed up, your head keeps spinning around.

Ooh, see the light of day
Darkness comes, gonna wash it away
Pretty soon heâ€™ll realise who hides the trip behind an alibi
There's so much inside for both of us
There's no reason to hide and justify
Just love and satisfy
Love and satisfy
Love and satisfy
Love and satisfy.
