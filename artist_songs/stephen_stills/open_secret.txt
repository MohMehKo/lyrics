Does everyone have their dark side
Like the backside of a lover's moon
Do we cry out for justice at sunrise?
To be cleansed by confessions at noon, have mercy

Still my heart is an open secret
Someone tell me have I been gifted or robbed

Just as we seem to end the one act play
We draw so much farther apart
Each new opening, a different time for closing
Will I sing my last symphony to an empty room, empty room?

Still my heart is an open secret
Someone tell me have I been gifted or robbed

Most of my life has gone up and down
And I don't see no reason for all this pain
Who was it said, "Life is too short"
All this hurtin' just makes it seem a shame

Still my heart is an open secret
Someone tell me have I been gifted or robbed
