Makin' it hard on each other
Makin' it hard on yourself
Makin' it hard on me
Makin' it hard on you
...Its all the same

I'm not the one to tell you what to do
I have no desire to run your life
Do you thing you know what to do
Just don't let nobody tell ya no lies

Could we retire
To a neutral corner
'Cause I'd like a chance
...To make myself...clear...
I said I'm still your friend
I've got a few things I'd love to say
And I'd like to think that you might want to hear...

[Chorus:]
Blind stubborn pride drove us apart
Can't you see the place we went wrong
You hide in your world
And I'll get lost in mine
All we got left is a song

[Chorus]

When you decide that you'd like to know
What it is that makes a person go
When you decide you believe and you're trustin'
Let somebody open your soul

[Chorus]
