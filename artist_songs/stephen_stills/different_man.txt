I am a different man
Than you've ever seen me be
I got young though I'm older now
Fear and anger have no power over me

Dug a hole and i did fall in
There I stayed for a while
Who done told to be my saviour
In their pity they done lost all sense of me

Nothing really matters but the love that's in my heart
Long tall sally's standing by me
Many are the friends I have been loyal to a fault
Who have known all along
That there ain't too much good we've done
Feeling shameful for too long
And you ain't bad but you went wrong
We all are sinners
The lord forgives us every one
God forgive every one
