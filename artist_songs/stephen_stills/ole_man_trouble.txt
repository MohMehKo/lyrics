There's a man you know they call Trouble
And he follows me everywhere I go
You know Ole Man Trouble
He can't get me now 'cause I know

Mr.Charlie, yeah, you know I worked hard for you
Ah but you're mean to me, just as mean as you can be
You and Ole Man Trouble
You can't get me now 'cause my mind is free

And my pockets, Lord, you know they're so empty
I got no place to lay my weary head
Rather leave all my troubles
And let the green, green grass be my bed

And I get what I need
And I need what I get
And there never ain't nothing
That I didn't, didn't need yet

So Ole Man Trouble
Oh, it doesn't matter about what I want
Do y'all get what I'm saying?
'Cause my heart is in my song
My song blowing in the breeze

Ole Man Trouble, you can't get me now
'Cause my mind is free
And I got a love for the life I live
And I gotta need yeah, what I got to give

So goodbye
Ooo, goodbye
I got no need for you
Ole Man Trouble

Ole Man Trouble
Ole Man Trouble
Ole Man Trouble
Ole Man Trouble

Ole Man Trouble, Trouble, goodbye
