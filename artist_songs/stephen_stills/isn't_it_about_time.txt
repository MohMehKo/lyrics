Don't look now, don't heed the warning
It's really of no concern
Don't hear the sound, they're only just bombing
Anything left to burn

Isn't it about time
Isn't it about time we learned
Isn't it about time
Isn't it about time we learned

Fire, flood, familiar, famine
The jungle so far away
Blood baked into blackened soil
How many tons a day

Isn't it about time
Isn't it about time we learned
Isn't it about time
Isn't it about time we learned

Isn't it about time
Isn't it about time we learned
Isn't it about time
Isn't it about time we learned

Why, does it take so long
Is it easy not to care
Seems to me that enemies are fantasies
Somebody else's living nightmare

Who gonna live, who gonna die
Do you want to know
Does it give you a sense of power
To say yes or no

Isn't it about time
Isn't it about time we learned
Isn't it about time
Isn't it about time we learned

Isn't it about that time
Isn't it about time we learned
Isn't it about time
Isn't it about time we learned

Isn't it about time
Isn't it about time we learned
Isn't it about time
Isn't it about time we learned
