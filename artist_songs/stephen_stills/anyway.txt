Hey girl how's by you
Sing your rock and roll
Sing your blues
But I'm all right you know I pay my dues
Got 'em comin' to me
Got 'em comin' to you

I'm gonna try again
Don't matter if I win or lose
Gonna try again anyway
Yes I am, gonna try anyway
Yes I will

But I know you
You gonna be so cool
Ain't gonna try no sweet talkin'
I ain't no fool
Cause I know you love me girl
Just like I love you
Got my feet on the ground
And I know what I got to do

I'm gonna try again
Don't matter if I win or lose
Gonna try again anyway
Yes I will, gonna try anyway
Yes I will

Do you know where you're goin'?
Honey where have you been?
Do you see the games they're playin'?
Do you really believe you can win?

I'm gonna try again
Don't matter if I win or lose
Gonna try again anyway
Yes I will, gonna try anyway
Yes I will
