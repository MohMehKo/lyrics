Fishes and Scorpions
In the morning sun
Dance to the changing seasons
Get away with none

Water sign in the air
Touch the earth with flame
See the friendly Sagittarian
Do you remember his name

Lovers of lions
Stay away at feeding time
Is all the Taurus takes
Mimicking life in rhyme

And can you tell me
What does it do for you girl
And can you tell me
Who is that you knew girl

In the shadow of starshine
Everyone's going blind
Lookout you don't lose your mind
I don't know if it's a fantasy

It don't mean too much to me
In the shadow of starshine
Everyone's going blind
Gemini lady

Did you see me chasing you
I don't think I did
I only tried to get through
