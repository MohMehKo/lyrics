Ain't it always [4x]

Ain't it always thrilling to find a lover
Understands
Ain't it always [2x]
Ain't it always chilling that you might lose her
On the snap
Ain't it always
Stay there arm away
Cos people change
Never know what they might rearrange

Ain't it always [2x]

Ain't it always trouble
Love somebody so hard
It's a trap
Ain't it always [2x]
Ain't it always double
How much it hurts
She left you flat
Ain't it always

But the big thing was how she loved you
Nothing like anything you've ever seen
Ain't it always [2x]

Ain't it always [2x]
Maybe when she's willing she knows the way
She'll come back
Ain't it always [2x]
Ain't it always killing thinking back
She's all of that

For that girl she's got you trapped
Four different kinds of heart attack
Ain't it always [4x]
