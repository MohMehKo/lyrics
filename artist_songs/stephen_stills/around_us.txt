Any more when I think of you
There is no separating me and you
We got a whole lot of work in there
And between us there's one heart beating

Cos of your sweet love
Cos of love and devotion
We see clearly now
We can see clearly over the horizon
Ain't no dream too high
Ain't no dream out of touch
Anywhere around us
Anywhere around us, anywhere
Anywhere around us, anywhere

Takes my breath looking at you now
Girl don't you light up a room anyhow
The most fortunate man alive
Has to be me with you by my side

Cos of your sweet love
Cos of love and devotion
We see clearly now
We can see clearly over the horizon
Ain't no dream too high
Ain't no dream out of touch
Anywhere around us
Anywhere around us, anywhere
Anywhere around us

Just between us
People keep telling us
Entirely too curious
Too much to say about what we are doing
Prob'ly jealous baby
Don't let 'em come between us
Don't let 'em come between us baby
Come between us

Every time that we are apart
Time you're away
More than a couple of days
Been a start
Give it up
Pining away for you
Missing your love
Girl I ain't lost I'm just missing you

Cos of your sweet love
Cos of love and devotion
We see clearly now
We can see clearly over the horizon
Ain't no dream too high
Ain't no dream out of touch
Anywhere around us
Anywhere around us
Anywhere around us, anywhere
Anywhere around us
Anywhere around us
