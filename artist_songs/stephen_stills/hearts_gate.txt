People find love the way they do
Ain't the same for any two
If you think you get to choose, there's heartbreak
It takes paying attention to divine intervention
Trust the decision your heart makes

In the tropical moonlight where the air feels like velvet
Only someone to share it was missing
My heart was feeling bolder, would she turn a deaf shoulder
My mind getting older by the minute
It was hard to sit & wait, look at the stars, ponder my fate
Is to fear was it too late for the risking

Now we've had a few years, we're working out our fears
Lots of laughter & tears & growing
We left room to be ourselves, got the hand we'd been dealt
And there's nobody else need know it

People find love the way they do
Ain't the same for any two
We get chosen, we don't choose at the heart's gate
If you're paying attention to divine intervention
Comes a glorious ascension you both make
At the heart's gate.
