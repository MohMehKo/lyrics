Cuando sientes que tu amor
Va saliendo de tu vida
Y nunca regresara
Cuando ella diga
Adios y buena suerte
No estoy interesada
Tu amor no vale nada

(When you feel that your love
Is going out of your life
And will never come back
When she says
Goodbye and good luck
I am not interested
Your love is worth nothing)

There comes a time when love becomes a trial
And some they will survive
And some are sure to fail
No matter what you do
It's not enough, for she
Is as sure as she can be
That she no longer cares to love you
So go on alone, your future is your own
For she has told you now
The time has come to follow different paths
How long will it take you to forget her?
How long for the love to finally die?
How long will the spirit live within you?
Help me, I can no longer cry

[Trumpet]

So take your life in hand
And live it day by day
One moment at a time
'Til death comes to collect you
Remember all the love, beyond just simple caring
Obsessively compelling,
But ultimately so telling

Y parece
Que sabias que algun dia
Iba a vivir
Ese momento ya pasado

No mientas
Ya no llores por tu amor
La vida continua
Olvida tu dolor, hermano mio
Todo todo ha pasado
Estaba destinado

(And it seems
You knew that some time
I was going to live
The moment had already passed
Don't lie
Don't cry for your love
Life goes on
Forget your pain, my brother
Everything is over
It's already been written)

It took me too much time to realize that it was over
There was no more me and you
Now my life has changed completely
There's an empty place that once belonged to you (yeah)
I gave up on you
That's the hardest thing I've ever had to do
Giving up on you
I gave up on you
I have nothing left to lose
Even though I know you'll never really face yourself or put your trust in someone else
That's just the same as asking all of us to turn away and just give up on you

Every day is different for me now
The air is clear, and the daily worry too (all the time)
Easier to repossess my confidence was weak
I was trapped in loving you
I gave up on you
Even with the sadness it would surely bring
I gave up on you
I gave up on you
Even knowing what I do
I was giving up the pain of living without you
My life will never be the same
So I will once again do as you wish give up on you

I feel so common now
My love of decades, (won't you really pass too late?)
Hatreds born of demons must be driven from destruction
Now must fight for its own sake
I gave up on you
I'd no more time to waste
I gave up on you
I'd harder things to face
I gave up on you
I've finished with the chase
I gave up on you
While I can still forget the bitter taste
And memories that overcome me
Seeming to be trying to convince me
That life is nothing but a time to waste
I gave up on you
