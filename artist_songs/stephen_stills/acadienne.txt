In the bayous haunted by Evangeline
In the pre-dawn hours close to Halloween
There's a mist that's hanging right in between
The Spanish moss & the cypress LEAVES
And the memory of the life that's gone wrong
C'est plus quand possible
Tu les sais Acadienne

I'm a driver alone in my Cadillac
In a white chair rug you'll be thinking back
He'll be running wild as a child tonight
And the snakes and 'gators they was friends of mine
I'll forever be un petit Acadien
C'est plus quand possible
Tu les sais Acadienne

And the father never found peace enough
To cure his permanent wanderlust
Every time we'd get settled down
We'd wake up heading for another town

From the Louisiana to the Florida
That's a be my home to a (un-im-up [?])
That's a simple people don't complicate
And you hear the future in the hands of fate
And the life you get is the life that I want
C'est plus quand possible
Tu le sais Acadienne

And my father never found peace enough
To cure his permanent wanderlust
Every time we'd get settled down
We'd wake up heading for another town

Hear me boy cos your love is why
You got two three words you gonna be alright
And there's powerful forces out up the swamp
It'll be forever, make it permanent
And the life you get is the life that I want
C'est plus quand possible
Tu le sais Acadienne
C'est plus quand possible
Tu le sais Acadienne
