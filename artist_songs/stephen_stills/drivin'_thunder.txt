I was again in florida
Cruisin' with my crowd
Over by datona we done
Heard the most awesome sound
Went out to the speedway
What was this about?
The meanest looking cars you ever seen
Running flat out

Drivin' thunder
Rollin' down the race track
Drivin' thunder
You can't ever relax
All set up to go
Just one way to go
Stick your foot in it
Clear to the floorboard

Me I got right in it
Inside them old boys' heads
Do I need a splash of gas?
How much time do I have left?
The car is feelin' good now
I got my quickest line
Stickin' back just loosen up
Took 4 seconds off the best lap time

Drivin' thunder
Rollin' down the race track
Drivin' thunder
Can't ever relax
All set up to go
Just one way to go
Stick your foot in it
Clear to the floorboard

Drivin' thunder [2x]
Drivin' thunder [2x]

Don't ever look back

Drivin' thunder [2x]

12 seconds pit stop
The rubber and the fills
A crew that good deserves
A display of my driving skills

Draggin' on the leader like a bird of prey
I got too much car for him
Gonna slingshot
And win this race

(you got) drivin' thunder
Rollin' down the race track
Drivin' thunder
Can't ever relax
All set up to go
Just one way to go
Stick your foot in it
Clear to the floorboard

Drivin' thunder [7x]
