My love is gentle thing
She moves with a whispering
She waits for my mind to slow
And then I'm hers to know

Have you seen her love eyes?
Watching me, her love eyes

We lay in Hawaii's sun
The water will make us one
The sleep of peace will come
The end of trouble has begun

Have you seen her love eyes?
Watching me, her love eyes ooo
