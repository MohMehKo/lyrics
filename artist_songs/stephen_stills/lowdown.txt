Feel such misery and I don't know why
Feel so bad I'm surprised I'm not
Condemned to die

I never thought that heartbreak
Could bring such pain
Guess that's what it's like when you
See different things

And I'm a lowdown
Get me out of this place
And I'm lowdown
Like a hole in space

And I'm lowdown spirit movin' at a dreadful pace
Slowly dyin', I can see it in my face
Sadness and anger all that keeps me goin'
Tired of nothin' but my outsides showin'

And I'm lowdown, dying embers of a fire
Sputtering tears of a lost desire
Hangin' on to hope that just might be
But I feel like I'm hangin' from a dyin' tree

And I'm lowdown and I'm lowdown, lowdown
Get me out of this place
And I'm lowdown lowdown
Like a hole in space
And I'm lowdown and I'm lowdown
