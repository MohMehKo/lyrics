First things first
When you can quit livin' in the past
When you stop worryin' 'bout tomorrow
Then I think you just might last

And I know the price of freedom
Gettin' more than a little high
In these angry days of sorrow
We find the meaning of a lie
So I sing about first things first

First things first
Remember everything you pass
When it's time to go on back
Remember to put the first things first

And I know the price of freedom
Gettin' more than a little high
In these angry days of sorrow
We find the meaning of a lie
So I sing about first things first
