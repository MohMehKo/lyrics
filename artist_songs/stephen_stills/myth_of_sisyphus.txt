Are you leavin'
Bein' alone
Always made you so sad
I got memories of the city
Followin' me everywhere I go

Are you mad with heartache
Got a country home
And you a Parisienne
Gonna take all your sorrows
Right along with you when I'm gone

And I got to go away
Only need a couple of days
I got one more chance to sing it
And I ain't gon' waste my time
'Cause everything including you
Is on the line

Are you troubled
Feelin' bad
And no one seems to care
Got the myth of Sisyphus
