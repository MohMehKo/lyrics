We are not helpless we are men
What lies between us
It can be set aside and ended

Everyday we learn more how to hate
Shut the door
And then we'll tell ourselves we can't relate

Only to the ones who are the same
Yet even they are different
And ever so they shall remain

All are strangers, all are friends, all are brothers
Open up my friend and learn to hear
For even lying
When it has nothing you should fear

If you cannot let yourself be
Known by anyone
Then you are hiding and not whole
All are strangers, all are friends, all are brothers

We your children we would ask you all
Please do not hide your eyes
And listen when we will call
We will whisper shout or make a scene

We are the answer
For we can live the peace we dream
All are strangers, all are friends, all are brothers
Ohh yeah, ohh yeah

Yes America's children
Are askin' everybody some questions about how it is
Yes America's children
Are makin' it hard to look them in the eyes whoa it is

America's children
Are makin' it hard to live lies you know whoa it is
And America's children are diggin' that everywhere children
Are diggin' we live on the earth

We live on the earth we live on the earth right now
Yes, and it's right on children of the earth and it's right on
Children of the earth and it's right on
Children of the earth and it's right on right on, yeah

This is what has made our nation free
For life is change
And only blind men cannot see

The new order is upon us now it is the children
They have the wisdom to be free
All are strangers, all are friends, all are brothers
