I hear that you're concerned
About hearing me
I understand your problem
If you see candles burn
From the middle me
I don't know how to stop them

Oh yes we catch a fire
Kick the room around
We like to keep it poppin'
And if we get inspired
Rapped up in the sound
Might come some truth a knockin'

Everybody
Got some kind of story

Ain't nobody
Near enough worried

The story goin' round
Thru the welfare line
Is that nobody matters
What it is goin' down
Easily defined
Fat cats are getting fatter
It's hard to be concerned
With what you cannot see
I don't think they see the problem
When everybody's heard
Of this agony
There's people goin' hungry right now

Everybody got some kind of story
Yeah
Nobody near enough worried

So honey spread the word
Get visibility
This is the people talkin'
Get with this real life
Your vailidity
Don't need no weapon today

This can't be all there is
To the twilight's last gleaming
I just don't think we'll have it
Willful unconsciousness
Plain and simple me me me
I think we better fix it
Right now

Everybody, got some kind of story
Ain't nobody near 'nough worried
