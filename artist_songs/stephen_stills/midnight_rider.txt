I've got to run to keep from hiding
And I'm bound to keep on riding
And I've got one more silver dollar

But I'm not gonna let 'em catch me, no
Not gonna let 'em catch the midnight rider

I don't own the clothes I'm wearing
And the road goes on forever
And I've got one more silver dollar

But I'm not gonna let 'em catch me, no
Not gonna let 'em catch the midnight rider

I've gone by the point of caring
Some old bed I'll soon be sharing
And I've got one more silver dollar

But I'm not gonna let 'em catch me, no
Not gonna let 'em catch the midnight rider

No, I'm not gonna let 'em catch me, no
Not gonna let 'em catch the midnight rider
No, I'm not gonna let 'em catch me no
No, I'm not gonna let 'em catch the midnight rider
