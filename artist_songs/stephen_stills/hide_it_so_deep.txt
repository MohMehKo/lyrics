If I fell in love with you again
Would you simply want it said you once knew me
Could you care enough to follow and see
Just what is it lies between us, why we hide it so deep

I was told by a fried that you miss me
And you try very hard to forget me
And you live your busy life, there's no room for me
Cause the thing you're sure I'd take is your will to be free

Still you wrestle with the chains of your burden
And you're sure when they're gone you can be certain
You can live as you please, give what you sell
And you carry that weight so nobody can tell
