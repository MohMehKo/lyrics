The last time I spoke to her
She couldn't talk to me
The script she read was very strange
But who did she see
A few lines from a bad dream
A frozen memory

Darkness remains the fate
Of such...illusion
Can you not wait
On what...can...be

Who was it cast the mold
The girl that I once knew
Such a carefully chosen pose
But what will the emptiness do
One of my best friends took her down
With his games for sure

Hearts made of stone
Cannot break again
I hope he understands
I hope he is secure

Old fashioned feelings
The new way of dealing
With love I see
These time were meant for me

No no no no no...
The past isn't anymore
The future only has in store
And round and round and round it goes
And where it stops nobody knows

As far as I can tell
The only game in town is going down
And only happens
In the right now
