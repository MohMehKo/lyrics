There is a stranger where I once knew you
There is a dangerous energy flows through you
I don't know what to say
Just get out of the way
And remind you
This just isn't like you

I wouldn't pay no mind 'cept for the voices
Telling you I won't mind you makin' my choices
Not wishing to be unkind
But you are out of line
Need I remind you
This just isn't like you

And I must confess to bein' heart broken
That you would still insist I been jokin'
When I am always there
As you are well aware
Doesn't it strike you
It just isn't like you
