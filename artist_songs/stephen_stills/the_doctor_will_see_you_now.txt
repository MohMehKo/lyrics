What do you say when you've said everything
What turn to play when you've played all of their

Do you know better than anyone else
Can you show better than anyone else, that nobody knows

How can you teach when you've taught everyone
How can you preach when you brought everyone with you

Do you know better than anyone else
Can you show better than anyone else, that nobody knows

Shut the door, turn off the power, stop your mind
You tell us your soul is leaking and it needs fixing

How can you think when you thought everything through
Standing on the brink of the lonely game of solitaire
Tell us about how the world is at you're feet, oh yes
And there is nothing to do but quietly make an exit
