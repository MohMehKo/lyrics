Pretty woman you lovely such and such
Think about the last time
You had a gentle touch
Did you feel it
Ain't it just too much

See somebody pretty
Look you in the eye
That's the one that touches you
Do you need a place to hide
And I'm just as bad as anything
You ever thought about anyone

And I know our time's goin' to come
Just as sure as the risin' of the sun
And I know she loves me so

See somebody pretty
Look you in the eye
That's the one that touches you
Do you need a place to hide
