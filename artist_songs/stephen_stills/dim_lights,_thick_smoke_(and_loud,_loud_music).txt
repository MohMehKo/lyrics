Dim lights thick smoke and loud loud music
Is the only kind of life you'll ever understand
Dim lights thick smoke and loud loud music
You'll never make a wife to a home lovin' man

A home and little children mean nothing to you
A house filled with love and a husband that's true
You'd rather have a drink with the first guy you'll meet
And the only home you know is the club down the street

Dim lights, thick smoke...
Dim lights, thick smoke...
