Fancy Dan, gamblin' man
Top hat of the peanut man
Talk about your pot of gold
With a silver linin'

Tumblin' dice, hit it twice
Boats and the flushes, they sure look nice
On a pot of gold with a silver linin'

State line give you hard times, stay too long
Goodbye, pretty women
I ain't stayin' on, come on

Get a hunch, bet a bunch
Come to gamble, better pack a lunch
For a pot of gold with a silver linin'

Less you bet when you stayin' in
The more you lose even when you win
On a pot of gold with a silver linin'

You don't know when to stop
Lady Luck, she gonna see you're taught
That there ain't no pot of gold and no silver linin'

Easy money can make [?]
Come too quick turn a good man bad
For a pot of gold with a silver linin'

Gamblin' man, Fancy Dan
Top hat of the peanut man
Talk about your pot of gold
In the silver linin'
