I met you in the strangest way
Into a night of crazy smiling faces
Had it been another day
The sound of a thousand voices wailing dismay

Having seen no other way
We looked at each other once
And felt the love begin
Love begin

'Cause you know there's a
Ring of love, surrounding you and me
Ring of love in perfect harmony
Ring of love, surrounding you and me

All the way, I've never met anyone
Ever could touch me so all the way
You know you're the first one
To make me believe in something

People are full of lies
Always willing to compromise
Their love and their tomorrow
Such a sorrow, sorrow

The world is ours if we can cope
We don't have to lose the faith
That gave us this much hope
Let us blow with the wind
To seek out the fountain of life
And all its miracles, its miracles

'Cause you know there's a
Ring of love, surrounding you and me
Ring of love in perfect harmony
Ring of love, surrounding you and me

All the way I've never met anyone
Ever could touch me so all the way
You know you're the first one
To make me believe in something

People are full of lies
Always willing to compromise
Their love and their tomorrow
Such a sorrow, sorrow

'Cause you know there's a
Ring of love, surrounding you and me
Ring of love in perfect harmony
Ring of love, surrounding you and me

Ring of love in perfect harmony
Ring of love, surrounding you and me
