As I come of age
I keep fallin' down
And I feel just like a schoolboy
I was in a senseless rage
Runnin' too hard
And I tore you all to pieces

Yes but it's all over now
I'm a little bit older now
The lessons that I'm learnin' now
Gonna make it easy
Somehow

Now then can I try
Starting over
Put the pieces back together
Even as I cry bitter tears
I can see it's all a puzzle
A game
Always the same

By the time I die with the passing
If I've sorted out my changes
And if you could take the time
I would tell you that it's still a puzzle
The same
Always a game
