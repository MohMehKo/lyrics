Down where the moss grow on the oak tree
There's a bayou woman she waits for me
She treats me nice and she makes good gumbo
C'est ma femme out Je t'aime I love her so
C'est beaucoup yumbo

And she'll lead the way once you
Know where you're goin'
She gotta soft sway, Does it without knowin'
She treats me nice and she makes good gumbo
C'est ma femme out Je t'aime I love her so
C'est beaucoup yumbo

And I don't mind telling you that
Everything feels better
When I'm with my woman make me
Strong and for sure more together
There's a yellow swamp steady as you're goin'
`Round that next bend the cypress never knowin'
Listen to the music of the river flowin'
Like the deep Mississippi current she always knowin'
She treats me nice and she makes good gumbo
C'est ma femme out Je t'aime I love her so
C'est beaucoup yumbo
