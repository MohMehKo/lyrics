Well, I ride on a mail train
Can't buy me no thrill
Well, I've been up all night
Leanin' on the window sill

Well, if I die on top of the hill
If I don't make it, you know my baby will

Don't the moon look good, mama
Goin' down over the trees?
Don't the brakeman look good, mama
Flaggin' down the Double E?

Don't the sun look good
Goin' down over the sea?
Don't my girl look fine
When she's comin' after me?

Now the wintertime is comin'
The windows are all filled up with frost
I tried to tell everybody
But I could not get across

Well, I wanna be your lover, baby
I don't wanna be your boss
Don't say I didn't warned you
When your train gets lost
