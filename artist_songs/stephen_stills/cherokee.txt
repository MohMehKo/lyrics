In my short time I've loved, I've shined
And now I find all my lovin' just been blind
Southern girl, come on
You and me, babe, gotta move on, come on

My fortunes mean nothing
I never cared about fame
The dark eyed Cherokee
Like the raven she knows me

The secret she keeps like her soul so deep
Nothin' 'round here get to me
Like the lady from Tennessee
Like the lady from Tennessee
