There's no hiding place down here
There's no hiding place down here
I ran to the rocks to hid my face
The rocks said there's no hiding place
There's no hiding place down here

Did you hear the sport
On the TV holding forth
About war, nukes and victory
He was dreaming of course but he runs the Air Force
And he's talking about World War Three

There's no hiding place down here
There's no hiding place down here
I ran to the rocks to hid my face
The rocks said there's no hiding place
There's no hiding place down here

Then of course we got the clowns
With the plan that they got down
Keep the world paralyzed in fear
Keep the peace keep the strength
And the Rooskies on the brink
More and better, bigger faster missiles here

There's no hiding place down here
There's no hiding place down here
I ran to the rocks to hid my face
The rocks said there's no hiding place
There's no hiding place down here

With no hand upon your fate
All the prophets do await
Either ending or ten thousand years
You can do just as you will
You can live or you can kill
There's no hiding place down here

There's no hiding place down here
There's no hiding place down here
I ran to the rocks to hid my face
The rocks said there's no hiding place
There's no hiding place down here

So before it's too late
Let there be no mistake
There ain't no hiding place down here
Only faith is not absurd
In the Master's chosen words
There's no hiding place down here

There's no hiding place down here
There's no hiding place down here
I ran to the rocks to hid my face
The rocks said there's no hiding place
There's no hiding place down here
