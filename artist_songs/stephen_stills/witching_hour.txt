People they just don't seem to understand
Why is this person but he's just a man
He's seen it high, he's seen it low
He’s traveled miles, he don't know.

Imagination takes him far away
Dreamin' up things he might write down someday
And these people they turn around and say
At least I'm not alone, somebody else speakin’.

He got the world, he got the power
He got the wisdom, he'll never cower
He gonna tell you to tear down the tower
He'll make you pay in the witching hour.

He gets so confused
When he knows he's bein' used
He's so easily abused
And it hurts him so.

When Mr. Dreamer comes up with a new light
To cast on something hidden deep in the night
Heluva nation can be painfully bright
Some people love him for it other say he ain't got no right.

He got the world, he got the power
He got the wisdom, he'll never cower
He gonna tell you to tear down the tower
He'll make you pay in the witching hour.

He gets so confused
When he knows he's bein' used
He's so easily abused
And it hurts him so.

People asleep are easily alone
Come on, wake up, you’re missing on the farm
There’s so much to do that ain’t been done
Come on, the music’s playin’, the day has been gone.

He got the world, he got the power
He got the wisdom, ain’t gonna cower
He gonna be the one to tear down the tower
’Cause you’ve been thinkin’ in the witching hour.
