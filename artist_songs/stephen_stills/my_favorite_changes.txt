This is my favorite set of changes
Already good for a couple of songs
Thought I might play them one more time
And over again

Makes me go back to the trouble I got into
Tryin' to live up to what they said I lucked into
At twenty-five

And this part reminds me of my lady
She loves me she's waitin' at home
And the baby she's makin'
I tell you it's frightenin'
How she trusts me so
And all of the sad times the bitter taste
Left by the struggle to grow
Must my baby know the blues

So if you're still listenin'
I hope you'll remember
The kid with the big white guitar
And all the sad stories to tell

I think it's high time
I went home she'll be worryin'
And missin' me so
How long can I let it drive
Me crazy this music won't
Let me go

But here I stand tryin' so hard to find
One more clever line
For this song of mine
But I can't seem to find
Anything that will rhyme
With my favorite changes
