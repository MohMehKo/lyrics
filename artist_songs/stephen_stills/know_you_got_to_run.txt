Know you got to run
Know you got to hide
Don't know who to follow
Who is on your side?

Don't know where you're going
You won't talk of where you've been
And I may see you tomorrow
Nevermore again

Seen you in the city
Seen you on the road
Your face is all a twisted
'Cause your brain's a heavy load

Then you turn and ask me
How did I ever know
Talk about your searchin'
Well I think it's all for show

Heard your mournful song
Heard your baleful cry
Seen the light of hunger
Lingering deep within your eyes

Talk about your sinkin'
What a hole you're in
You expect for me to love you
When you hate yourself my friend

And you got yourself a potion
For to keep you from your sleep
In the dark and lonely hour
I heard you laugh and weep

You'll always be runnin'
'Til you find your doom
Never face your lonely soul
Never face the gloom

Know you got to run
Know you got to hide
Don't know who to follow
Who is on your side?

Don't know where you're going
You won't talk of where you've been
And I may see you tomorrow
Nevermore again
