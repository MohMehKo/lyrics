If you dogrow
Then you must know
When you get so jive
You only half alive
Show me right now
That you know how
You can stand up
Look in a mirror and sigh

Get your feet wet
Run with the jetset
Be a good girl
Go around the world
But the longer it goes on
The harder you hang on
Til you stand up
Look in a mirror and sigh

Tryin' to be cool
You just be the fool
Let it be known
You ain't full growed
And its all right
Don't put up such a fight
You can stand up
Look in a mirror and sigh
