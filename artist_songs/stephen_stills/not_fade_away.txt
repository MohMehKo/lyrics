I'm gonna tell you how it's gonna be
Come home and bring your love to me
My love for you has got to be real
All of these years and how I feel

I've been lovin' you night and day
My love is real not fade away
Can't you see that there's a good reason
For bein' together just to be pleasin'

Stompin', shoutin' and carryin' on
Just you and me baby we could have more fun
All we need is a sunny day
Love a love not fade away

Love a love not fade away
My love is real not fade away
Love a love not fade away
My love is real not fade away

Nobody else could be your man
I'm still walkin' so I know I can
My love is bigger than a Cadillac
Tried to chauffeur but you drove me back
Got to be with you when night turns to day

My love is real not fade away
My love is real not fade away
My love is real not fade away
My love is real not fade away
(Love a love not fade away)
