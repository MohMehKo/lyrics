There's a place
I can get to
Where I'm safe
From the city blues
And its green
And its quiet
Only trouble was
I had to buy it
And I'll do anything
I got to do
Cut my hair and
Shine my shoes

[Chorus:]
And keep on
Singin' the blues

If I can stay here
In Johnny's garden
As the swift bird
Flies over the grasses
Dipping now and then
To take his breakfast
Thus I come and go
And I travel
And I can watch that bird
And unravel

[Chorus]

With his love
And his carin'
He puts his life
Into beauty sharin'
And his children
Are his flowers
There to give us peace
In quiet hours

[Chorus]
