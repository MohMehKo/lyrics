I'm out on the street
All alone by the newsstand
The lady of leisure comes
Tearin' by
Almost knocking me down

She turns at the corner
And looking back
Lets her eyes send the message
I'm helpless alone
And I'm goin' down

Help me I need someone gentle to love me
My life is a miserable comedy
Of strangers
Posing as friends
I know they don't know
Who I am

Hurry it's time to make your move boy
Hurry better get along with it soon boy
Hurry there she goes
Hurry she's out the door boy
You know you can win the battle
But you can lose
The war
Hurry are your feet glued to the pavement boy
You know you can win the battle
But you can lose
The war

Thought I saw a fox I did I saw a fox
Amidst that sea of pride
Running
Let me call a hansom cab
We'll both get in and then go for a ride
Nowhere
Nothing spoken I retreat
Find the subway take a seat
I let myself get in my way
And let her get away

I got off the train at the next stop
And headed back uptown
I knew I could find her
She so needed a friend

I found her alone in a doorway
The tears in her eyes
Said there's nothing that you can say
I just need an ending

I gave her a flower
And got her to smile
And asked her quite frankly
Would she not prefer
A beginning
