Everytime I try (I try)
To read between the lines
I'm left wondering what I did so wrong
Everytime I try (I try)
Try to rationalize
When everyone went wrong why didn't we die?
Everytime I think about 
What it would be like without 
All the things you give to me

All these thoughts keep running through my head
Nothing to believe
Look back
Find the things I lost
There's nothing left there, so it seems

Up hill both ways
Nothing left to say, yeah
I don't know how I made it this far
I don't know how (don't know how)
I made it last this long (I made it this far)
I don't know why (don't know why)
I try

All these things keeps going through my head (running through my head)
Don't know which way to turn (don't know which way to turn)
Each path 
Goes up hill both ways
Nothing but dust
Since I learned

Up hill both ways
Nothing left to say
I don't know how I made it this far
I don't know how (don't know how)
I made it last this long (I made it this far)
I don't know why (don't know why)
I try

Up hill 
Both ways
Nothing left to do now
I don't want nothing to see
