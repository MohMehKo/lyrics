Boxing off the fireworks
Cancel my parade
The street is empty tonight, tonight
Everything is quiet now
The city holds its breath for me
Their spirit has died, it died

Running my whole life to reach this place
And just when I arrive, the moment fades out
Will you let me?

Stop time
Your hand in mine
Bring me closer as it all gets ripped away
And I say goodbye to the clearest eyes
I won't be with you
But I won't be far away

I don't need an answer
But if you rewrote the past
You think you'd just leave me out, leave me out?
Or will you spin your head around in every crowded room
To see if I can be found, be found?

Every single plan you will forget
So do what makes you happy
No regrets now
I won't let you

Stop time
Your hand in mine
Bring me closer as it all gets ripped away
And I say goodbye to the clearest eyes
I won't be with you
But I won't be far away

I remember when you asked me how far 
that I could throw this love I found
Then I heard you say you'd wait around
I won't let you

Stop time
Your hand in mine
Bring me closer as it all gets ripped away
And I say goodbye to the clearest eyes
I won't be with you
But I won't be far away
And this is goodbye, goodbye
This is goodbye, goodbye

The street is empty tonight
The street is empty tonight
