In this house red curtains dim the day
In this hall black and white pictures hang
In this room friends come to drink their wine
In my head I tend to spend my time, yeah

I'm a wrecking ball, a liar
I'm a lover with no fire
I'm a loner but I'm tired
I'm a wrecking ball, yeah

On this screen I see my latest dreams
On these shelves I keep my family
In this bed I watch them fall asleep
In my ears all night I hear them breathe, yeah

I'm a wrecking ball, a liar
I'm a lover with no fire
I'm a loner but I'm tired
I'm a wrecking ball, yeah

In this book are words missing for so long
On this page I'll write them
I've been wrong

I'm a wrecking ball, a liar
I'm a lover with no fire
I'm a loner but I'm tired
I'm tired

I'm a wrecking ball, a liar
I'm a lover with no fire
I'm a loner but I'm tired of this wrecking ball
I'm a wrecking ball, yeah
