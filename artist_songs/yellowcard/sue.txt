Well if it was just in life
Then we'd know where
We're gonna mess things up this time
We're gonna make things right today

I'm not worried about tomorrow (make things right to-day)
I'm just worried about today (yeah, gonna make things my way)
I'm not worried about tomorrow (make things right to-day)
I'm just worried about today 

I see you looking down on me
Yeah, take your stereotypes
Fuck them!
For my dreams 
Are designed to make things right

I'm not worried about tomorrow (make things right to-day)
I'm just worried about today (yeah, gonna make things my way)
I'm not worried about tomorrow (make things right to-day)
I'm just worried about today

I'm not
Worried
Think about the things you said
Think about what they meant

I'm not worried about tomorrow (make things right to-day)
I'm just worried about today (yeah, gonna make things my way)
I'm not worried about tomorrow (make things right to-day)
I'm just worried about today
Make things right today
