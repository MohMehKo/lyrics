The land of the free
The home, the deprived
For years just sat back while others were asleep
But now the times are changing
Are you gonna stay the same?
We change the point of view while you point the blame on me
on me on me on...
You're nothing, nothing, nothing without your lies
You're nothing, nothing, nothing without your lies
You're nothing, nothing, nothing without your lies
You're nothing, nothing, nothing without your lies
Without your lies, without your lies

We take responsibility for things that you say
away you push it off, push it off on someone like me
Someone who cares just a little too much
You're using just another fucking crutch like me
Like me like me like me...

You're nothing, nothing, nothing without your lies
You're nothing, nothing, nothing without your lies
You're nothing, nothing, nothing without your lies
You're nothing, nothing, nothing without your lies
Without your lies, without your lies...
Lies...
