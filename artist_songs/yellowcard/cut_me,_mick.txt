I can’t keep this together
And I might lose this year
I can’t get through December
And you know all my fears

Someplace somewhere behind me
I walked right through the truth 
Truth is that you’re the one thing
That always pulls me through
This troubled life I choose

You are the one that I need
You know that I can still bleed
Bring me back to life
Bring me back to life

You brought me down from my cloud 
You keep my feet on the ground
Bring me back to life
Bring me back to life

When I thought that I might be invincible
It wasn’t long before I was invisible
To your eyes and I swear
There’s nothing left in here
And the more you say you don’t care
The more I know you’re there

You are the one that I need
You know that I can still bleed
Bring me back to life
Bring me back to life

You brought down from my cloud 
You keep my feet on the ground
Bring me back to life
Bring me back to life

I can’t keep this together (you are the one that I need)
I can’t stay sick forever (you know that I can still bleed)
I can’t stop this disaster (you bring me down from my cloud)
I can’t fall any faster

You are the one that I need
You know that I can still bleed
Bring me back to life
Bring me back to life

You are the one that I need
You know that I can still bleed
Bring me back to life
Bring me back to life

You brought me down from my cloud 
You keep my feet on the ground
Bring me back to life
Bring me back to life

You are the one that I need
You know that I can still bleed
You brought me down from my cloud 
You keep my feet on the ground
