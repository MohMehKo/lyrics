Mary belongs to the words of a song. 
I try to be strong for her, try not to be wrong for her. 
But she will not wait for me, anymore, anymore. 
Why did I say all those things before? I was sure. 

(She is the one), but I have a purpose, 
(she is the one), and I have to fight this, 
(she is the one), a villian I can't knock down. 

I see your face with every punch I take, 
and every bone I break, it's all for you. 
And my worst pains are words I cannot say, 
still I will always fight on for you. 

Mary's alive in the bright New York sky, 
the city lights shine for her, above them I cry for her. 
Everything's small on the ground below, down below. 
What if I fall, then where would I go, would she know? 

(She is the one), all that I wanted, 
(she is the one), and I will be haunted, 
(she is the one), this gift is my curse for now. 

I see your face with every punch I take, 
and every bone I break, it's all for you. 
And my worst pains are words I cannot say, 
Still I will always fight on for you. Fight on for you ...

I see your face with every punch I take,
and every bone I break, its all for you
and my worst pains are words I cannot say
still I will always fight on for you. Fight on for you. Fight on for you...
