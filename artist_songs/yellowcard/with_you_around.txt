Do you remember when I said you were my only one?
We running underneath the California sun
Well now I look at you and you're still more than I can take
You're like a slow song starting to accelerate

All my life I looked for you
For arms that I could fall into

All I can think about is you
And me driving with the Saves the Day record on
We were singing 'til our voices were gone
And I was falling hard
You were barely hanging on
And now I wanna chase forever down
With you around

You're making movies in your head when you fall asleep
Having nightmares, dreaming that I'm gonna leave
I know you've always been afraid of ending up alone
Somebody hurt you, now you're waiting on a dial tone

I'm right here so don't get blue
It's not just you, I need this too

All I can think about is you
And me driving with the Saves the Day record on
We were singing 'til our voices were gone
And I was falling hard
You were barely hanging on
And now I wanna chase forever down
With you around

We were running underneath the California sun

All I can think about is 
You And me driving with the Saves the Day record on
We were singing 'til our voices were gone
And I was falling hard
You were barely hanging on
We put a record on
And kept singing 'til our voices were gone
And I was falling hard
You were barely hanging on
And now I wanna chase forever down
(We were running underneath the California sun)
With you around
