Look at me and listen close
So I can tell you how I feel before I go
Just a year, it's not much time
For me to show you I am proud that you are mine

I wish I had known the future in my heart
Was just about to start

Say tomorrow
I can't follow you there
Just close your eyes
And sing for me
I will hear you
Always near you
And I'll give you the words
Just sing for me

Every lock, on every door
I put them there to try and hide you from the world
And you kicked, yeah, you screamed
You never understood you're everything to me

I just hope you know the future in your heart
Is just about to start

Say tomorrow
I can't follow you there
Just close your eyes and
And sing for me
I will hear you
Always near you
And I'll give you the words
Just sing for me

No looking back when I am gone
Follow your heart, it's never wrong
No looking back when I am gone
Don't second guess the note you're on

Out of time
All out of fight
You are the only thing in life that I got right

Say tomorrow
I can't follow you there
Just close your eyes and
And sing for me
I will hear you
Always near you
And I'll give you the words
Just sing for me

Just close your eyes
And sing for me
