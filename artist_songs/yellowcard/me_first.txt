We'll leave this shit behind
Our moms, our dads, our lives
Leave them all back there
Leave it back without a care
Friends and familes too
Leave them back at home with you
Checking out of our home town
Gonna make it somehow

We'll leave this shit behind
Leave this shit behind
Leave this shit behind
Behind, behind, behind

Going to California
Money is one thing we don't have
Have to play shows along the way
Have to make it our way fast
Just the 5 of us crammed into the bus
Checking out of our home town
Gonna make it somehow

We'll leave this shit behind
Leave this shit behind
Leave this shit behind
Behind, behind, behind

Leave this shit behind
Leave this shit behind
Leave it all back there
Leave it back without a care
Friends and families too
Leave them back at home with you
Checking out of our home town
Gonna make it somehow
