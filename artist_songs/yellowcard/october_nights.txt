Warm October nights
You came and cuddled next to me baby yeah yeah yeah
Our noses brushed so close
I wished it was our souls
Drifting off to sleep
I could hear the little snores you made
watching eyes shut tight
Like doors to something sweeter where you rest

Tear me off a piece of blanket
keep me warm and we can make it
Here's my heart, I'll let you break it
Touched your skin and I can't take it

Light will creep in soon
And I still haven't slept a wink baby yeah yeah yeah
I wish the sun would hide its head
So I could watch you dream some more
Wish the sun would hide its head,
So I could watch you dream some more.

I wanna watch you dream some more 
I wanna watch you dream some more
I wanna watch you dream some more
I wanna watch you dream some more girl
I wanna watch you dream some more
I wanna watch you 
I wanna watch you dream some more
I wanna watch you dream some more girl
I wanna watch you dream some more
I wanna watch you

Tear me off a piece of blanket
keep me warm and we can make it
Here's my heart, I'll let you break it
Touched your skiiiiiiiiiiin
