Out on the water in a sea of change
I wonder if you can recall my name
You gave it all before you took it away, yeah
You took it away
You and all the other racing rats
You got my heart and tried to turn it black
Well, now it's beating you I'm taking it back, yeah
I'm taking it back from you
I'm taking it back from you

Play us a song I know
Make it an older one
Don't you get it?
Say it before I go
Tell me I'm everything you ever wanted

Still feel I need to give you thanks
You took my edge, sharpened it in case
You were the one needed cutting away, yeah
I cut you away
You're a devil in a savior's robes
Made it easier to let you go
I never should have let you get so close, yeah
You got too close, too close to me
Too close to me

Play us a song I know
Make it an older one
Don't you get it?
Say it before I go
Tell me I'm everything you ever wanted
Don't you want it?
Don't you want it?

You're a devil in a savior's robes
Made it easier to let you go
I never should have let you get so close, yeah
You got too close
You and all the other racing rats
You got my heart and tried to turn it black
Well, now it's beating you I'm taking it back, yeah
I'm taking it back from you
I'm taking it back from you

Play us a song I know
Make it an older one
Don't you get it?
Say it before I go
Tell me I'm everything you ever wanted
Don't you want it?
Don't you want it?
