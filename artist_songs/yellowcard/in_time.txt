You got secrets in your heart
I got mysteries in mine
I tried to fix you and you tried to fix me
We broke in time
Now it’s storming in your soul
It’s always raining in mine
All the days we would wake up in sunshine
Did fade in time

In time, in time, in time
Fade in time

I see rivers in your eyes
You see oceans in mine
All these poems we’ve written with our lives
Change in time

In time, in time, in time
Change in time

Needed so much time
So much time

I hear goodnight in your voice
You hear goodbye in mine
I will be with you and you will be with me
Somewhere in time

In time, in time, in time
Somewhere in time
