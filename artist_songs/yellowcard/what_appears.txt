Slow steady hands waving their last goodbye
They've come a long way
They've carried me, they've carried me through waking dreams
And soft whispered words echoing all this time
Speaking a strange tongue
But somehow I have recognized it all along

I turned myself blue, but forced my way through
And I'm still a kid looking for answers
I ended up wrong the faster I've gone
But I know I am finding the answers

Remembering every attempted flight
I don't want to stay here
I told myself I'd listen close I filled my ears
The lone nights are long
Know you can understand
You just want to transform an empty stage
A fit of rage and you are born

I turned myself blue, but forced my way through
And I'm still a kid looking for answers
I ended up wrong the faster I've gone
But I know I am finding the answers

I am not what appears
I am failures and fears
But I'm on my way, I am on my way

I turned myself blue, but forced my way through
And I'm still a kid looking for answers
I ended up wrong the faster I've gone
But I know I am finding the answers

I am not what appears
I am failures and fears
But I'm on my way, I am on my way

Slow steady hands waving their last goodbye
They've come a long way
They've carried me, they've carried me through waking dreams
