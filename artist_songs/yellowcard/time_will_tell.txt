Seeing what the cause has left us 
There's no strength to minimize
They try and so hard to change us 
But we see through these conscious eyes
There will be nowhere to point the blame 
'Cause it'll lay on top of everyone
There's still time now to be save but there's
Still so much that must be done

Sit and yourself just when your final days will come
In a never ending war somehow they think they're already won
And one day we'll see who's right
And one day they'll see just what they've done
One day they'll see the obvious
Time will tell it won't be long

Will we be inferior
Surpassed by the machines we build
Will there be a Judgment Day
All I can say is time will tell
