Procrastination, the small conversation
The tensions beginning to build up inside
No one else's point of view
Has ever been to what you think is right

That's why no body is your friend
But they'll always become
One someday as she follows me
Is now business that you run

Wondering what went wrong
Wondering just how long the road ahead will be
Joy has compromised
Dotting all the I's, crossing the T's

One out of one
Its a realization of peoples reflection
Of what you believe

Anyone who now looks back
Be ready to die
The fought will change

So please don't get me wrong
We share our common goals
Inside of me sees how you are
So go one with the show

Wondering what went wrong
Wondering just how long the road ahead will be
Joy has compromised
Dotting all the I's, crossing the T's

See where it gets us
Well see where we hang out
But nothing can keep me from coming this way
Look at the sins and banged up poverty
Like which you remain in

I won't buy what your selling
I feel my eye repairing
Always makes a chance
To be seen
