You hung me out to dry
(You're no longer by my side)
You said that we're through
(What else can I do)
All those things you said
(I thought you really meant)
Were all just bullshit lies
(No longer by my side)

Miss your long blonde hair, miss your sweet blue eyes
Miss your big blank stare when you're by my side
I lost myself somewhere, somewhere back behind
Gotta help me find myself, no longer by my side

Miss your long blonde hair, miss your sweet blue eyes
I even miss your bitching, don't even ask my why
