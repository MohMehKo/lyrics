"Five teens involved... uh, one of them appears to be punk rock."

Wake up
Come live a brand new day
Don't concentrate on this
Just try to be happy
In this world we're living

Lay your weary head to rest
Don't worry
'Cause everything will be okay in the end

Now you've really pissed me off
You're fucking with my mind
I'm wondering what it's like
If it's worth my time
Wondering what I've done
To deserve to what you've done
Tell me this time

Hello
Tell me how have you been
All this time away
Wow
We've been sitting here
On our stage with nothing left to do
Except to play
Except to play

Lay your weary head to rest
Don't worry
'Cause everything will be okay in the end

Wondering why
(Wondering why)
Wondering why
(Wondering why)
Wondering why
(Wondering why)
Wondering
