Well, we're the ones that'll rule the world
That's how it will be!
Yeah that's us! We're the kids
Living in the USA

Yeah kids
Our time is alive
You don't seem to recognize
You can't be telling us what to do (what to do)
What you seem to do again
We're sick of all your bullet plans
[?] through

You don't even know yourself
Sure as hell don't know me
You don't even know yourself
[?] hard to see that

You try to tell us how to live our lives
Seem to forget we're [?]
And we're here living
In THE SO CALLED LAND OF THE FREE!

Yeah kids
Our time is alive
You don't seem to recognize
That we won't take you telling us what to do (what to do)
What you don't seem to understand
You're not going to [?]
You don't seem to have a fucking clue

KIDS!!
