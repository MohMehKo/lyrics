This can't be home anymore
This can't be home anymore
if you think i have not been missing the way she breathes
you are mistaken my friend I've fallen down
So put your mouth on my bloody knees

[Chorus:]
One night with me and I've broken your trust
I hate to be the bond you know is gonna bust
Hurting lungs from breathing sighs of disgust
This can't be home anymore
This can't be home anymore

Now cold concrete blank walls are
Staring into your lonely eyes
I duck behind them and hope that you won't go
And ask for answers to why I made you cry

I never wanted us to fade out
Resting on a love that fell apart
Where are you, I need you
You still have my heart
Still have my heart

I never wanted us to fade out (fade out)
Resting on a love that fell apart (torn apart)
Where are you, I need you
You still have my heart
Still have my heart

[Chorus]

Open up my heart [x4]
