Lately I've found
You're bringing me down
And I can't stand to see me this way
I'll stick around but I won't make a sound
You already know what I'd say

I'd say you want to hit me where it hurts the most
To get me lyin' down And I'm on to you
Nothing ever works out like it should

Quiet on the front
The sky dropped the sun
It fell down on our faces again
I tried to run
You could see what I'd done
Now it's wearing off, wearing thin

Now where, how dare
You be full of you enough to think I'm waiting up
And I'm onto you
And nothing ever works out like it should

Light in her eyes
Light in her eyes
Light in her eyes
Light in her eyes
Light in her eyes

I'm changing trains the station remains
Footsteps in the stairwell echo
I lost track of days
I found thousands of ways
But how to quit you, nobody knows

So leave me, you're free
It's three flights down to happiness
Make sure you close the door
And I'm onto you
Nothing ever works out like it should

Light in her eyes
Light in her eyes
Light in her eyes
Light in her eyes
Light in her eyes
Light in her eyes
