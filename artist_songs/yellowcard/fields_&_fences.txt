Looking for something to wake in my soul
It seems like its singing stopped cold
I got used to being the star of the show
But I've seen the lights come and go

I heard a song playing brought by the wind
I got myself lost and I found you again

Tennessee, when I finally lay down to sleep
Then I'll rest in your ground
But these days the world is against us
So keep me safe with your fields and fences around me

I want to start living
I want to be brave
I want to find where I belong
'Cause I still remember the reasons I write
Things that I've dreamed for so long

I heard a song playing brought by the wind
I got myself lost and I found you again

Tennessee, when I finally lay down to sleep
Then I'll rest in your ground
But these days the world is against us
So keep me safe with your fields and fences around me, around me

I don't have much that I can give to you
But I know I love the way you make me feel like I'm at home
And I am not alone
I don't have much that I can give to you
But I know I love the way you make me feel like I'm at home
And I am not alone
I don't have much that I can give to you
But I know I love the way you make me feel like I'm at home
And I am not alone
I don't have much that I can give to you
But I know I love the way you make me feel like I'm at home
And I am not alone
