It's hard to think where we began
We were born and learned to stand
Recollections scattered out inside my head
We came across a broken road
With broken hearts that overflowed
Taking turns and never knowing where they lead

Do you picture me, what do you see?
Maybe a future full of unwritten things  
We hope to write from what's been done
Look for a future no one else has sung

Records on, the speakers blown
Fill the air with what we know
Climb a ladder up and hang a hopeful sign
Never lonely, never lost
Never scared to jump across
Revolutions come and go but we survive

Do you picture me, what do you see?
Maybe a future full of unwritten things 
We hope to write from what's been done
Look for a future no one else has sung

Our darkest days are done (illuminate)
Rise like a brighter sun (illuminate)
Our darkest days are done (illuminate)
Rise like a brighter sun(illuminate)

As we get warm, ice will get thin
We'll become ghosts, together again
As we ascend, air will get thin
We'll become ghosts, together again
