Trembling, hold me now

I'm torn between silence and violent expression
tired of believing everyone wants to care
and cherish someone I'm so scared of never having anyone

Haunted by my abandoned dreams
Tiny voices where would be screams

Now be still, it won't be long

We will be together in search of a new life
Striving as one in this world to find something pure
I'm missing you now
I'm quite sure
That I've finally found someone
