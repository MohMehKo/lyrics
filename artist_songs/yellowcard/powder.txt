Lying soaked in sweat tonight
Your knuckles white, you try to fight
The need for more to get you by
You've had enough you wonder why
Even now your body cries
For chemicals to blind your eyes
Wonder can you stay this high
When the cells begin to die
Forever, forever, forever

Crush it up, crush it up
Take it down, take it down
Smash it up, smash it up
Falling down

Swallowed like the medicine
That's broken down my happy friend
Wonder if he'll let me in
If I come to see him when he's better
He's better, he's better... now

Crush it up, crush it up
Take it down, take it down
Smash it up, smash it up
Falling down
Crush it up, crush it up
Take it down, take it down
Smash it up, smash it up
Falling down

There's power
In the powder
Dissolving in your guts
There's power
In the powder
Dissolving in your guts

Crush it up, crush it up
Take it down, take it down
Smash it up, smash it up
Falling down
Crush it up, crush it up
Take it down, take it down
Smash it up, smash it up
Falling down

I'm falling (crush it up, crush it up)
I'm falling (take it down, take it down)
I'm falling (smash it up, smash it up)
I'm falling down
I'm falling (crush it up, crush it up)
I'm falling (take it down, take it down)
I'm falling (smash it up, smash it up)
I'm falling down

I'm falling
I'm falling
I'm falling
I'm falling down
