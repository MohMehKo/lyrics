Stay the night - touch the sky, with me.
We can live like we have, forever.
Spend your days - watch the waves, with me.
We can love like we are, forever. Ohhh.

You're the light from the moon tonight. Ohhh.
You're the history I will write. Ohhh.

You're the last stop and I arrive. Ohhh.
You're the one for the rest of time.

What good could I do, in a life without you.
What more could I lose, than what I found in you...
In you...
In you...

When you're gone - you belong, with me,
Because you know that we are forever.
Take your time - to realise; you'll see,
We will always be here forever. Ohhh.

You're the light from the moon tonight. Ohhh.
You're the history I will write. Ohhh.

You're the last stop and I arrive. Ohhh.
You're the one for the rest of time.

What good could I do - in a life without you,
What more could I lose - than what I found in you.
What words could I use - to say all this to you,
What verse could I choose - to give myself to you...
To you...
To you...
To you...
To you...

I wanna love with you, and live - Yeah-eah.
Live right here forever!

I wanna love with you, and live - Yeah-eah.
Live right here forever!

I wanna love with you, and live - Yeah-eah.
Live right here forever!
