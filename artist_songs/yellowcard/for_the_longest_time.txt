[Orginally by Billy Joel]

woohoohoohoo for the longest time 
woohoohoo for the longest time 
if you'd say goodbye to me tonight 
there would still be music left to write 
what else could I do 
I'm so inspired by you 
you haven't been there for the longest time 
if you say that i'm the one that's wrong, 
would i have the strength to carry on 
that's where you found me, 
when you put your arms around me 
you haven't been there for the longest time 
woohoohoohoo for the longest time 
woohoohoo for the longest time 
I'm that voice your hearing in the hall 
and the greatest miracle of all 
is when you found me, 
when you put your arms around me 
you haven't been there for the longest time 
If you said that i'm the one that's wrong 
would i have the strength to carry on 
i'll take my chances 
i forgot how sweet romance is 
you haven't been there for the longest time 
woohoohoohoo for the longest time 
woohoohoo for the longest time
