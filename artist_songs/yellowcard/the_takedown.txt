I feel things changing when I move
(Its a distance, Its a difference)
I'll cross this planet without you
(and you might call this a downfall)
Its one long night that I'm passing through
(Its a dark one what have I done)
Its one long night...

Don't turn your back on me now
You can't do this 
Don't say you can live without
You can't do this alone
How did I end up like this, the lonely one,
Your greatest take down?

You take me down

Left last night with a long goodbye
(We cement why, through a phone line)
I told you thoughts that multiply
(That I don't know how to let go)
We've been here many times before
(I am empty, when you leave me)
What's one more?

Don't turn your back on me now
You can't do this 
Don't say you can live without
You can do this alone
How did I end up like this, the broken one,
Your greatest take down?

You take me down
You take me down

I won't get by 
I won't heal in time
I won't get by

Don't turn your back on me now
You can't do this 
Don't say you can't live without
You can do this alone
How did I end up like this, the chosen one,
Your greatest take down?

You take me down
