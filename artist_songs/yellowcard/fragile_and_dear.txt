We spent years on a tear to get away
You and I, we revived yesterdays
But, the movements in between our hearts' desires
Oh, they changed so suddenly and we expired

[Chorus:]
You can't know
The way it feels
To lose something so
Fragile and dear
To you
Hold you up against the light
Speak the truth and say goodbye to you
Goodbye to you

I'm trying so hard
To get free
But, you still
Come back and haunt me

And the movements that divide our hearts' desires
All the reasons that I knew we would expire

[Chorus x3]
