Possessions
The last thing on my mind
I don't give a fuck about the ties or kind
I don't want all the things you have
I love my life,it really isn't that bad

The last thing on my mind
Is to give a fuck about the ties or kind
On my mind

You are a rich kid with a rich mom and dad
I can have anything I want;I can have anything you have
Have,boats,trains,planes,or cars
I don't have to work,dad will get me really far

The last thing on my mind
Is to give a fuck about the ties or kind
On my mind

[Piano Interlude]

Well,you are a rich kid with a rich mom and dad
Anything I want,anything you have
This whole country could be mine
I have enough money to buy anything anytime
