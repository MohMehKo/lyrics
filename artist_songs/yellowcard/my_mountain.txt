I am on my mountain
I am there with her
I can see it all so clear
I am young again up here

I can't come back from where I've gone, but I'll be close
I left myself in every song and every note
And if you need me, I will never be too far
I'm always with you, like the child in your heart
Yeah!

I have found my mountain
I can be with her
When I finally came across, I recovered all I lost

I can't come back from where I've gone, but I'll be close
I left myself in every song and every note
And if you need me, I will never be too far
I'm always with you, like the child in your heart
Yeah!

I can't come back from where I've gone, but I'll be close
I left myself in every song and every note
And if you need me, I will never be too far
I'm always with you like the child in your heart

I am on my mountain
I am there with her
I have found my mountain
I can be with her
Be with her
