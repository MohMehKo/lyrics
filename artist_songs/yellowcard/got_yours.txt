Stacking bricks on broken ground
Building towers to watch them come back down
Taking hands and making breaks
Finding cover to see what you can say

(You won't take me with you!
I will not go with you!)

Maybe it all comes out right here
What I couldn't say to you for fear 
of telling true of what I need from you
Maybe I'll lose you after all
There is nothing left for us to call home
I am sure I've got mine and you've got yours 

Always felt this way with you
When it's lifted will you love me like you do
Every moment you're away
(You're away!)
Hearing voices, should you leave or should you stay

(I will not go with you!)

Maybe it all comes out right here
What I couldn't say to you for fear 
of telling true of what I need from you
Maybe I lose you after all
There is nothing left for us to call home 
I am sure I've got mine and you've got yours

I walk with open eyes, away from open arms
I walk with open eyes, away from open arms

Maybe it all comes out right here
What I couldn't say to you for fear 
of telling true of what I need from you
Maybe I lose you after all
There is nothing left for us to call home 
I am sure I've got mine and you've got yours

I've got mine, you've got yours 
I've got mine, you've got yours
I've got mine, you've got yours
