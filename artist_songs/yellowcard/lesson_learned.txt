It's six in the morning, 
You still haven't slept yet 
You're tired from all yesterday, 
But all you can do is 
Just try to wake up 
And prepare for what tomorrow will bring, 
It's cold out it's raining, 
No one to complain 
Just wishing the time will go by 
Sitting here anxious a touch too ambitious
So tell me what time do we end 
This on going process 
'Cause someday you'll have to begin, 
Working your ass off while they sit relaxing

Do the same thing day after day
Working only 'cause i do it the right way
And soon these things will change
You lost all you live in the world underneath
[x2]

Woke up this morning 
You realized it's okay
You're taking some time to just look at the sky 
The sun is still shining, 
I realize that life isn't working from six
And not thinking twice, 
You still got your brain and 
You still got your life, 
But your running out of things all the time 
Misunderstaments about how we live 
Running around all the time 

One day these thoughts will come together, 
One day this shit will work out fine. 
It's just like they said it, but it seems like forever, 
Yes I'm distorted a blur in your mind, 
And the ever race you run, it's only with yourself. 
Overcome the obstacles you just you need you, 
Nobody else
