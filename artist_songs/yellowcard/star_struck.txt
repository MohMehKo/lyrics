Where is your inspiration, you lost it, oh so long ago
so much for innovation, I saw this coming long before
You had no motivation, your hopes are high but trapped below,
This constant competition, we've won but your still keeping score

But I grew up, wishing on a star
You think I won't ever get too far.

So high on dedication, it feels so good to get away,
From all this repetition, this angry town, this battleground
So now we'll break tradition, we'll leave you swimming in our wake
Without your inspiration, you won't survive, you'll surely drown

But I grew up, wishing on a star
You think I won't ever get too far
So now I am wishing on a star
You think I won't ever get too far

Where is your inspiration, you lost it oh so long ago
