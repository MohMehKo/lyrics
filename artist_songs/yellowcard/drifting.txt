When I look into your eyes, I can see
Such a sad man in disguise
waiting, wishing, dreaming, drifting from me
Hurts my heart to see you cry
waiting, wishing, dreaming, drifting from me

I don't know you anymore, wish I knew what's wrong
Can't we try to slam that door, start a brand new song

I know you're lonely and you cry, wondering why
I know it's lonely but if once, you could help me understand
What it takes to be a man
Look back on what you've said, and the life you've led
Is it what you dreamed when you were young like me.
Now it's time you took something back
just for the sake of your mind.
When I look into your eyes, I can see
Life has buried you alive
waiting, wishing, dreaming, drifting from me
You can't breathe
Heart as big as ocean's wide
waiting, wishing, dreaming, drifting from me
