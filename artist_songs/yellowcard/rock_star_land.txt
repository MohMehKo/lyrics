Christmas break of ninety eight just flipped me upside down
One coast out to the other following the sound
Headed west to get the best of what we all knew then
One ocean to another waves come crashing down
Carrying just me aunt Stephanie she held my hand
Told me why I was
Blazing down that highway on my way to Rock Star Land

California, a place they say glistens gold.
I wanna go there and never come back home.

Staring up at freeway signs in dreams that make me sad
One coast out to the other
One ocean to another
We cruised out to the other side
Loved us in Nebraska how they cheered us in Mattane
Told me why if I was
Blazing down that highway on my way to Rock Star Land
