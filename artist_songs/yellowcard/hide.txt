Haven't heard from you in days
I'm spreading thin what I've got saved
And I come down from your highest highs
Now what the hell am I supposed to say?

I know it feels like
I let you down
But I'm still around

If you can't find
A way to reach me
Take your time
I could be underneath you
Looking up to see you
From where we used to hide

Busy writing thoughts tonight
A message sent with no reply
You used to hang on my every word
Now they never come out right

I know it feels like
I let you down
But I'm still around

If you can't find
A way to reach me
Take your time
I could be underneath you
Looking up to see you
From where we used to hide

You are invisible in this
Too caught up in what you missed
So spend what I gave
I'll give you more
You are invisible in this

If you can't find
A way to reach me
Take your time
I could be underneath you
Looking up to see you
From where we used to hide
