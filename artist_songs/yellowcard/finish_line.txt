Hello friend
It's been too long
and every town sings the same sad song

Hello Friend
It's been too long
and every town sings the same sad song
without you here
this hotel year
we'll sure slow down with so much left to hear

Lets jet back down that highway now
blast stereos loud
Lets jet back down that highway now

The finish line is almost here
and someone softly whispers in my ear
"times like these are memories
to hold deep down inside of you and me"

Lets jet back down that highway now
blast stereos loud
Lets jet back down that highway now
Lets jet back down that highway now
blast stereos loud
Lets jet back down that highway now

I'm not leaving you
I'm not leaving
I'm not leaving you (Goodbye friend, it wont be long)
I'm not leaving (and until then we'll sing the same sad song)

Sad song

Lets jet back down that highway now
blast stereos loud
Lets jet back down that highway now
Lets jet back down that highway now
blast stereos loud
Lets jet back down that highway now

Lets jet back down(that highway now)
Lets jet back down(that highway now)
