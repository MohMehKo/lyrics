I'm back, back in town
And everything has changed
I feel, feel let down
The faces stay the same
I see, see shadows
Of who we used to be
When I drive, drive so slow 
Through this memory

When we were only kids 
And we were best of friends
And we hoped for the best
And let go of the rest 

I heard, heard myself
Say things I take back
If I could, could retell
And make these stories last
I see, see shadows
Of who you'll always be
I drive, drive these roads
Made of memories

When we were only kids 
And we were best of friends
And we hoped for the best
And let go from the rest
Shadows and regrets
We let go from the rest 

Everything has changed
Faces stay the same
Everything has changed
Faces stay the same

And we were only kids 
And our time couldn't end 
And how tall did we stand 
With the world in my hands 
And we were only kids
And we were best of friends
And we hoped for the best
And let go of the rest
And shadows and regrets
We let go of the rest
Shadows and Regrets
We let go of the rest
