So where are you and how's it been?
How's the weather out there?
Such a long time since you cut out
Left me for anywhere

Come home, the lights are on
I wait for you year after year
Don't let the past become the reason you're not here
I hope to see the day you walking up the drive to come back inside

Did I teach you to be humble?
Did I help you to grow?
Did I fill you with forgiveness?
Was it me made you go?

Come home, the lights are on
I wait for you year after year
Don't let the past become the reason you're not here
I hope to see the day you walking up the drive to come back inside

Must have been a lifetime you've been gone
It was hard to be so hard on you
Looking out the window for so long
Wanting you to come back into view
Maybe time is telling us to heal
Maybe you just needed me to feel the way you do

Come home, the lights are on
I wait for you year after year
Don't let the past become the reason you're not here
I hope to see the day you walking up the drive to come back inside
