Take me home
Take me home
I am lost in the world
All I know
All I know
Is that I miss you more

It was cold on the street
And my heart skipped a beat
When you said you'd be mine
Now I fear I might freeze
So, I'm asking you please
Would you let me inside

Oh, you never change
So, that's why I stay
Oh, I'll never go
So, you won't be alone

Which way now
Which way now
Is this road gonna end?
Tell me how
Tell me how
I am wandering again
