We're jamming
In the bedroom
Mom will be home pretty soon
She'll make us turn it off
Why can't you see that it's not that bad?

Gives us a reason to get off the couch
Gives a purpose to my petty existence
Why can't you see my point of view this once?

Well mom kicked us out
There's no point to scream and shout
She'll always get it her fucking way
We gonna have to find another place to play

To Give us a reason to get off the couch
Gives a purpose to my petty existence
Why can't you see my point of view this once?
