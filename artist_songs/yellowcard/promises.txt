Joking every year
It's an anniversary
You spoke and made it clear
You're the only one you'll ever need
But now, you're starting to notice
Without me, it comes into focus

Nothing you'll be
Will stop you missing me
So fill your life with promises 
That we'll never have to keep
And I know someday you'll be wishing you kept one for me

Take your medicine
If it helps to let me go
Dissolve the guilt and then
Tell yourself you're better off alone
Searching for something
(Searching for something)
Tell me how is that working out?

Nothing you'll be
Will stop you missing me
So fill your life with promises
That you'll never have to keep
And I know someday you'll be wishing you kept one for me

Nothing you'll be
Will stop you missing me
So fill your life with promises
That you'll never have to keep
And I know someday you'll be wishing you kept one from me

Nothing you'll be
Will stop you missing me
So fill your life with promises
That you'll never have to keep

And I know someday you'll be wishing you kept one for me
