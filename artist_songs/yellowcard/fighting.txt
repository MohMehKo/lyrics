I said I'd moved on and I'd leave it alone,
But before I walk out there is something that I need you to know,
I got lost in the blink of an eye,
And I can never get back, no I never got back,
You were not there when I wanted to say,
That you were everything right and it wasn't you but me to change,
Now I got to go it alone,
But I'll never give up, no I'll never give up

What am I fighting for,
There must be something more,
For all these words I sing,
Do you feel anything

I said I'm OK but I know how to lie,
You were all that i had,
You were delicate and hard to find,
I got lost in the back of my mind,
And I can never get back, no I never got back
You were not there when I needed to say,
I hit the bottom so fast that my head was spinning 'round for days,
Now I gotta go it alone,
But I will never give up, no I'll never give up

What am I fighting for,
There must be something more,
For all these words I sing,
Do you feel anything

What am I fighting for,
What am I fighting for

Never give up on this [x4]

Said I'm OK but I know how to lie,
But I will never give up, no I'll never give up

What am I fighting for,
There must be something more,
For all these words I sing,
Do you feel anything

What am I fighting for (No I'm never gonna give up, give up)
What am I fighting for (No I'm never gonna give up, give up)

Said that I'd fight for the one that I've found,
I'm gonna stay here while I wait for you to come around,
I fight you're apart of me now,
And I will never give up, no I'll never give up
