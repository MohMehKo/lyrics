Black dust in orbit
Cascades down like a parachute
Bricks on my shoulders
This gravity hurts when you know the truth

I’m pulling my weight in gold
Call me anxious, call me broke
But I can’t lift this on my own
Pulling my weight in gold
Call me anxious, call me broke
But I can’t lift this on my own

We dreamt like martyrs
I never thought I was bold enough
You pushed me further
And I take the blame for the both of us

I’m pulling my weight in gold
Call me anxious, call me broke
But I can’t lift this on my own
Pulling my weight in gold
Call me anxious, call me broke
But I can’t lift this on my own

Oh, Universe, hold me up
You tried your best, is it ever enough
When it’s already dragging me down?

I’m pulling my weight in gold
Call me anxious, call me broke
But I can’t lift this on my own
Pulling my weight in gold
Call me anxious, call me broke
But I can’t lift this on my own
