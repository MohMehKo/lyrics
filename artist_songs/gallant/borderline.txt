She was born with a rubber spine
Loose skin and vacant eyes
Nurtured by the tumbleweeds
And the crackling of the power lines
By the lightening off the satellites
We balanced on the borderlines
Hoping our minds weren't as flimsy as our alibis
But did we really think it through?
Cause baby, we're sitting like the ducks
I know you want a better view

So fill your conscious up
And join me on the other side
(Join me on the other side)
Take it personal
And meet me on the borderline
(Meet me on the borderline)
Say you'll cry, feel bad, or both
Still hoping you'll get through
Fill your conscious up
And join me on the other side
(Join me on the other side)
Join me on the other side

On a cornfield in paradise
You say a shaman gave you bad advice
Keeping your feet planted and ankles firmly tight
Oh, but did you really think it through?
Cause baby you're sinking like a star
I know you want a better view, oh

So fill your conscious up
And join me on the other side
(Join me on the other side)
Take it personal
And meet me on the borderline
(Meet me on the borderline)
Say you'll cry, feel bad, or both
Still hoping you'll get through
Fill your conscious up
And join me on the other side
(Join me on the other side)
Join me on the other side

Oh-oh-baby
Ah, oh no, you're not moving
Oh no, you're not moving
