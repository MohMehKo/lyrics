If I'm drowning won't you take me to the waterfall?
Lay stones in front of those banks
And keep me underwater til' I'm breathing
Throw me in the fire til' I'm frozen
Frozen frozen frozen
Teach me til' I don't know what I'm doing

Why don't we open up sometime?
Sell me that gold in your veins
I want your fortress next to mine
Every nightmare on your plate
Can I trust that you won't mind
My sanity slipping away
Ooh baby, why don't we open up?

If you're thirsty, let me lead you to the Maranjab
Plant trees in spite of those rays
And leave you in the sun until you're soaking
Throw you in the fire til' you're frozen
Frozen frozen frozen
Teach you til' you don't know what you do

Why don't we open up sometime?
Sell me that gold in your veins
I want your fortress next to mine
Every nightmare on your plate
Can I trust that you won't mind
My sanity slipping away
Ooh baby, why don't we open up?

Let's be the last ones
Why don't we open up sometime?
My sanity slipping away

Why don't we open up sometime?
Sell me that gold in your veins
I want your fortress next to mine
Every nightmare on your plate
Can I trust that you won't mind
My sanity slipping away
Ooh baby, why don't we open up?

Why don't we open up?
Why don't we open up?
Why don't we open up?
