I'm looking to the sky to save me
Looking for a sign of life
I'm looking for a way to burn out bright
Looking for a complication
Looking cause I'm tired of lying
Make my way back home when I learn to fly

Learn to fly high, fly high
Learn to fly high, fly high

Run and tell all of the angels
This could take all night
Think I need a devil to help me get things right
Hook me up a new revolution
Cause this one is a lie
We sat around laughing and watched the last one die

I'm looking to the sky to save me
Looking for a sign of life
I'm looking for a way to burn out bright
Looking for a complication
Looking cause I'm tired of lying
Make my way back home when I learn to fly

Learn to fly high, fly high
Learn to fly high, fly high
