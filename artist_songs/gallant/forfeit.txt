Forfeit, without you it's not the same, forfeit...

How much I cry, ooh I want anything it's better without you
Darling, I'm sorry, I let your words and think I run for more
Wanna love you, wanna touch you
Left the [?]
Did you want to?
Forfeit, without you it's not the same, forfeit
Forfeit, without you it's not the same, forfeit
Feeling inside me, yeah, can wait to see
Now I just smile, I know we said [?] this things before
Wanna love you, wanna touch you
Left the [?]
Did you want to?
Forfeit, without you it's not the same, forfeit
Forfeit, without you it's not the same, forfeit
Forfeit, without you it's not the same, forfeit
