Smoke will let you fly away
Keep running from me
I know I'm not the only fool waiting
To lean and fall behind

Lay down these bread crumbs your way
Saw what it's all about, what can we say?
I'm feeling bad so I'm afraid you'll go away
[x2]

He knows I can take you away
And we don't wanna scare the lights oh baby
On everything we're only stars fading
We're fighting for our life

Lay down these bread crumbs your way
Saw what it's all about, what can we say?
I'm feeling bad so I'm afraid you'll go away
[x2]

Smoke will let you fly away
Keep running from me
I know I'm not the only fool waiting
To lean and fall behind

And we don't wanna scare the lights oh baby
On everything we're only stars fading
We're fighting for our life

Lay down these bread crumbs your way
Saw what it's all about, what can we say?
I'm feeling bad so I'm afraid you'll go away
