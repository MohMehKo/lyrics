Diamonds on a silver platter weren’t enough…
And you thought about those cigarettes you burned for love…

So many others tried to crack your heart
Weak defenses are the only things you’ve got

And I was blaming you– an ego so inflated
And red infatuation so strong
Decades overdue…
Regretting all the patience
I’m sorry that I waited too long

So if Jupiter is finally fading out this time
Let the fairy-tales we wrote about go black and white…
