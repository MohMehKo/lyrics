Are the chemicals controlled
Are they written in my native tongue
Open-ended cosmic code
I know I can't be the only one

Cause I felt vibrations across the burgundy sea
Now I bet my head on a mission I couldn't lead

But maybe there's a moon inside these lies
Habitable and chosen
But maybe there's a hope behind these eyes
Waiting until my logic falters
And I'm losing hope, who knows
Who knows

Cause I felt vibrations across the burgundy sea
Now I bet my head on a mission I couldn't lead

But maybe there's a moon inside these lies
Habitable and chosen
Maybe there's a hope behind these eyes
Waiting until my logic falters
And I'm losing hope, who knows
Who knows
