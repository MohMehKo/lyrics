[Gallant:]
Find me
What am I missing?
What am I missing?

Find me skipping stones, yeah, washed up rocks
Holding out for something I can't force
What am I missing?
Oh, baby, what am I missing?

Where's the peace of mind
I was told, I was told, I was told
I'd begin it
Feeling compromised
Like I was born in a league of my own
But I'm sinking

[Gallant & Jhené Aiko:]
So find me skipping stones, yeah, washed up rocks
Holding out for something I can't force
What am I missing?
Oh, baby, what am I missing?

[Jhené Aiko:]
I've gone for miles and miles in search of right direction
I long to figure out, but I keep on forgetting
All of the lessons that I've learned
How many bridges have I burned?
When did I go missing, somewhere in the distance?

[Gallant & Jhené Aiko:]
Find me skipping stones, yeah, washed up rocks
Holding out for something I can't force
What am I missing?
Oh, what am I missing?

Woah, girl
Feeling
Somber
Say it to me, say it now!
