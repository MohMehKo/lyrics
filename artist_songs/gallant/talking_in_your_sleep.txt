Hoping I could treat you better
Are you running out of patience?
Kissing up to fortune tellers
Have you given up already?

You're uncertain
Falling out of focus

I can hear you talking in your sleep
Waiting for your bus
Even though you know you'll end up
Walking a mile on your own
And you can't seem to break out of
Talking in your sleep
Waiting for a love
Even though you know you'll end up
Walking a mile on your own
And you can't seem to break out of it

Lucid dreams and sunken treasure
Just another one too many

You're uncertain
Falling out of focus

I can hear you talking in your sleep
Waiting for your bus
Even though you know you'll end up
Walking a mile on your own
And you can't seem to break out of
Talking in your sleep
Waiting for a love
Even though you know you'll end up
Walking a mile on your own
And you can't seem to break out of it

Is the figure getting any closer?
Overheard you saying that you're scared of the silence around you
In the back of your gutter mind I can already see it
Tell me you see it

I can hear you talking in your sleep
Waiting for your bus
Even though you know you'll end up
Walking a mile on your own
And you can't seem to break out of
Talking in your sleep
Waiting for a love
Even though you know you'll end up
Walking a mile on your own
And you can't seem to break out of it
