Not enough colors in the world
Thought I would invent some
Or fade to black, jump-cut to alone
Cross-fade to emotion

If it hurts, then baby, you’re all I need
I’m thinking reality could make it, make it complete
If it hurts, then baby, you’re all I need
I’m thinking reality could make it, make it complete
If it hurts, then baby, you’re all I need
I’m thinking reality could make it, make it complete
If it hurts, then baby, you’re all I need
I’m thinking reality could make it, make it complete

Not afraid to show myself the truth
To see what I’ve been missing
But then again, that midnight I was in
Was so much more appealing

If it hurts, then baby, you’re all I need
I’m thinking reality could make it, make it complete
If it hurts, then baby, you’re all I need
I’m thinking reality could make it, make it complete
If it hurts, then baby, you’re all I need
I’m thinking reality could make it, make it complete
If it hurts, then baby, you’re all I need
I’m thinking reality could make it, make it complete
