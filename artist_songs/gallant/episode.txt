So inconsistent with my passion that I threw it all out
I took it from you
You
So apathetic with the forces that I burned them all out
I took it from you, you

So when the water's rushing close
I'll find you near the edge and save you from the meso
Should've known you were gonna find out
You're gonna find out but

Is it worth the episode
Is it worth the episode, oh no
Walking through the door alone
Is it worth the episode, oh no

So covered up in all the fire that I never looked back
I took it from you, you
So agitated from the shadows, can I take it all back, baby
I took it from you, you

Oh, all your pretty mind wants
Is atoms for my bones and ashes for my thoughts
Oh, should've known you were gonna find out
I knew you'd find out but

Is it worth the episode
Is it worth the episode, oh no
Walking through the door alone
Is it worth the episode, oh no

Should've known you were gonna find out
I knew you'd find out but

Is it worth the episode
Is it worth the episode, hey
Walking through the door alone, no
Is it worth the episode, no

Oh
Oh, oh no
Oh
Oh, oh yeah

Is it worth the episode
Is it worth the episode, oh no
Walking through the door alone
Is it worth the episode, oh no

Should've known you were gonna find out
(Should've known you were gonna find out)
Should've known you were gonna find out
(I knew you'd find out)
