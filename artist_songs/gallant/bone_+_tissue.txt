Give me more than God in a courtroom
More than broken glass in my houseshoes
More, more, more, more
The money on a bet that you wanna lose, babe
Quit taking your time making time feel better

Sell me something I can use to catapult my value
Treat me like the cardinal anointed in my vessels
And any time I bite the hand that feeds
Won't you lie through your teeth and
Tell me I'm a monument to more than bone and tissue?

Give me more than rocks in a windshield
More than kerosene in a minefield
More, more, more, more
Than strangers telling me what I want to hear
Instead of spending all your days making days feel shorter, just

Sell me something I can use to catapult my value
Treat me like the cardinal anointed in my vessels
And any time I bite the hand that feeds
Won't you lie through your teeth and
Tell me I'm a monument to more than bone and tissue?

If I falter on my oaths
Will it prove I'm more than skin and bones?
If I falter on my oaths
Will it prove I'm more than skin and bones?

Sell me something I can use to catapult my value
Treat me like the cardinal anointed in my vessels
And any time I bite the hand that feeds
Won't you lie through your teeth and
Tell me I'm a monument to more than bone and tissue?
