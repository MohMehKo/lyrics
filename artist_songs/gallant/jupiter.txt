Diamonds on a silver platter weren’t enough…
And you thought about those cigarettes you burned for love…

So many others tried to crack your heart
Weak defenses are the only things you’ve got

And I was blaming you– an ego so inflated
And red infatuation so strong
Decades overdue…
Regretting all the patience
I’m sorry that I waited too long
Sorry that I waited too long
Sorry that I waited too long

So if Jupiter is finally fading out this time
Let the fairy-tales we wrote about go black and white…

So many others tried to crack your heart
Weak defenses are the only things you’ve got

So I was blaming you an ego so inflated
And red infatuation so strong
Decades overdue…
Regretting all the patience
I’m sorry that I waited too long

Sorry that I waited too long
Too long, too long, too long, too long, too long
Sorry that I waited too long
Too long, too long, too long, too long, too long
Sorry that I waited too long
Too long, too long, too long, too long, too long
Sorry that I waited too long
Too long, too long
Sorry that I, sorry, sorry that, babe

Ego so inflated
Red infatuation
Sorry, sorry
Regretting all the patience
Sorry that I waited too long
Sorry baby, so long
Sorry that I waited, sorry that I waited too long
Sorry that I waited too long, babe
Sorry that I waited too long, babe
