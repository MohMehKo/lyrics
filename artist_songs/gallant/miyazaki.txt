Suicide
All the heartbreak hit like suicide, hey
You was right
You was right to point the finger
At my guilty eyes, hey

But tell me if you want me to
Put my pride in check so I can make it up to you, babe

If you want
I can make your body tremble
If you want to
If you want
I can make a magic potion
If you want to revive
No one has to know (ooh)
No one has to know (ooh)
No no no no, no
