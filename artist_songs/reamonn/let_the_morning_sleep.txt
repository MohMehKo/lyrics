Daybreak has broken, no words been spoken
By you or me, what's left to say
It's too late to hate, what we've done is done now
Between you and me, it's just you and me

Let the morning sleep, now the day has come
We can pick ourselves back up and we can move on
Let the morning sleep, now the day has come
We can pick ourselves back up and we can move on

It's ok to say what you're thinking
Now that the moment has broken you can't hide anymore
You can't stop it falling it's like water in your hands
No, you can't stop it falling from your lips

Let the morning sleep, now the day has come
We can pick ourselves back up and we can move on
Let the morning sleep, now the day has come
We can pick ourselves back up and we can move on
It's time to move on

Let the morning sleep, now the day has come
We can pick ourselves back up and we can move on
Let the morning sleep, now the time has come
You can't hold it back, you know, you know it's too strong
It's time to move on, it's time to move on
You know it's too strong, it's time to move on
You know it's too strong
