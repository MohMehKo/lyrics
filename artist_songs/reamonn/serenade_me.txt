Through walls you'd walk to serenade me 
Through all this talk you know you made it 
I'm washed up here now 
Left here on my own 
These days these days they go on forever

Sweet little child don't be afraid 
Your daddy still loves you though he can't stay 
It's not easy being on your own 
Oh I know you'll find your way 
Oh I know you'll find your way

Sweet little child don't cry 
Your daddy still loves you though he can't stay 
It's not easy growing up on your own 
Oh I know you'll find your way 
Oh I know you'll find your way

I don't believe in all the words they tell us 
I don't belive that there is no one left to help us 
I don't believe it no I believe in you 
And you'll find your way 
You'll find your way 
You'll find your way I know 
You'll find your way

You'll find your way 
Through the hard times 
When you climbing up the walls 
Through the heartbreak

Cause he never wants to call 
Through the heartache 
You'll find your way 
You'll find your way 
You'll find your way 
I know you'll find your way 
Sweet little child 
Sweet little child 
My sweet little child 
You'll find your way 
You'll find your way 
I know you'll find your way 
You'll find your way 
My sweet child you'll find your way
