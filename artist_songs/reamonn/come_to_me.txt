I walk these halls
In search of sin
It drags me down
But I won't give in
I'm reaching out
I need your touch
I'm standing strong
But all alone
Is not strong enough
You gave me faith
You called my name
You felt my fear
You healed my shame
Won't you come to me
Won't you come to me
I see your light
It's shining down
It drags me up
From deep below
To higher ground
Surrender now
You can't succeed
A kiss of faith
Will rip you up
You can't believe
I took your hand
So you could see
I gave you love
You set me free
Won't you come to me
Won't you come to me
A time to rise
To overcome
We'll stand our ground
And be as one
Won't you come to me
Come on now
I see your light
It's breaking through
It's guiding me straight to you
A time to rise
To overcome
For you and I
To be as one
Come to me
Won't you come to me
Won't you come to me
Won't you come to me
