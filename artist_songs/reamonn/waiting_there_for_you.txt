Did they let you go
or are you running still from them
Or are you just mesmerized
by the way it is
Did you see your dream
fade before your eyes
Are you still reaching out
can you hear me scream
Can you hear me scream
Hear me scream

I'm waiting there for you
I'm waiting there for you
But there's nothing I can do
But there's nothing I can do

Did you see my face
stuck in the crowd
Could you see my cry
when you turned away
Did you see the tears
rolling down my face
Could you feel my pain
and did you hear me scream

Can you hear me scream
Hear me scream

I'm waiting there for you
I'm waiting there for you
But there's nothing I can do
But there's nothing I can do

I'm waiting there for you
I'm waiting there for you
But there's nothing I can do
But there's nothing I can do
