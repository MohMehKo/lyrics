I was young,
I was told
I should follow my dreams
from my worse broken heart
to a world that just seems
to move on...
Dance with the wind,
now she's gone.

I've been down on my luck
Yeah I've fallen from grace.
I've had beautiful eyes stare me right in the face.
And move on...
Dance with the wind,
now she's gone.

No need to talk about it.
Like it won't happen,
'cause the chances are that it will.

And moments like this will bring you down.
Moments like this will bring you round.
Moments like this will make you strong.
Now that they're gone.
Now they're gone.
Now that they're gone.
Now they're gone.

No more searching for signs
for a song I can sing.
Now I'm living my life
like a bird on a wing.
Movin' on...
Dance with the wind,
feeling strong.

No need to talk about it.
Like it won't happen,
'cause the chances are that it will.

Try not to talk about it,
just get it started.
Don't waste your time standing still.

And moments like this will bring you down.
Moments like this will bring you round.
Moments like this will make you strong.
Now that they're gone.
Now they're gone.
Now that they're gone.
Now they're gone.

And moments like this will bring you down.
Moments like this will bring you round.
Moments like this will make you strong.
Now that they're gone.
Now they're gone.
Now that they're gone.
Now they're gone.
Now that they're gone.
Now they're gone.
Now that they're gone.
Now they're gone.

If it don't kill you, it makes you strong.
If it don't kill you, it makes you strong.
If it don't kill you, it makes you strong.
If it don't kill you, it makes you strong.
