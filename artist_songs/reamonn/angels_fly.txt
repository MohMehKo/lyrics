She saw the world through her smile
When she held your hand you knew it'd be all right
She spoke of places she'd never been
"Now is the time", she'd say, "to live the dream"
And she told us how she could fly 
And she said "no need for goodbyes" 
For we'd see her there in the skies where angels 
fly Angels Fly
She stayed a while that summers day
Spoke through a smile of how she'd go away
I saw in her eyes her pain 
She took my hand and said it'd be ok
And now she's soaring up through the sky 
And she takes us all in her flight 
And she told us the reasons why Angels fly, Angels fly
Some summer days I can see her smile 
In so many ways she's still alive 
And the love that she gave I keep down inside
I'm keeping it safe 'til I learn to fly
And she's soaring up through the sky 
And she takes us all in her flight 
And I feel she is still alive 
Where Angels Fly, Angels Fly
And she told us how she could fly 
And she said no need for good byes
For we'd see her there in the sky where Angels fly,
Angels fly, Angels fly my sweet Angel Flies.
