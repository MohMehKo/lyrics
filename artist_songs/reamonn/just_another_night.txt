She wakes up cold
reaching for his arms
but there's no one there

She feels so old,
she falls apart
as she fights back tears

And then she curls up small
and feels like she's alone here in Hell
and then she starts to scream
I deserve more

She's running out of time
She's running out of time

Oh tonight

Is just another night,
just like any other night

And then she climbs inside
and orders him to drive
drive anywhere

He said hey you 
there's no need to cry
he began to stare

And then she curls up small
and feels like she's alone here in Hell
and then she'd start to scream
I deserve love

I'm running out of time
I'm running out of time

Oh tonight
Is just another night,
just like any other night

oh oh oh
oh oh oh
oh oh oh
oh oh oh

In these worn down streets
blinded by the neon lights
she feels turned away

She stands up straight
and takes some air
it's just another bad day

And then she screams out loud
You've made a mess of your life
You won't make a mess of mine

Oh tonight
Is just another night,
just like any other night

Oh tonight
Is just another night,
just like any other night

oh oh oh
oh oh oh
oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh

And then she screams out loud
as she's racing through the crowd
she screams at the top of her voice
I'm taking back what's mine

Oh tonight
Is just another night
In just another life
