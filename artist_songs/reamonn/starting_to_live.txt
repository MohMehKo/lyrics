Shooting stars won't bring us down tonight.
We're racing through these streets of paradise.
Wake up, wake up, open your eyes!
Revolution is ripping up the skies.

You feel you're starting to live.
You feel you're losing control.
You only get what you give.
So let the chemicals flow.
The chemicals flow!

Come on, take a roller coaster ride.
There's no one in the universe tonight.
Wake up, wake up, you arrived!
We're lighting up the streets of paradise.

You feel you're starting to live.
You feel you're losing control.
You only get what you give.
So let the chemicals flow!

Oh, you feel like you're in overdrive.
Oh, your shooting stars pass you by.
You feel you're starting to live.

Oh, you feel like you're in overdrive.
Oh, shooting stars pass you by.

Yeah, you feel you're starting to Live.
Yeah, you feel you're losing control.
You only get what you give.
So let the chemicals flow!
Yeah, you're losing control!
A chemical flow!

It's just a chemical flow!
It's just a chemical flow!
It's just a chemical...
