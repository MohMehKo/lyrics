Lost on a road going nowhere
Trying to take on the world
Searching for some one who understands
Sweet girl, sweet girl
Walking through fields of fire
Hopelessly reaching for the skies
Watching the flames growing higher
Tonight

And she danced like serpentine
She's my burning desire
She mystifies
Her love sets me on fire
Oh oh oh,
Oh oh oh oh oh.

Caught in a fear of embracing
Waiting for the beauty to arrive
All of the fears that you're facing
Sweet child sweet child
No one can stop us from reaching
Who says the Innocent survive
One more step into nowhere
goodbye

She danced like serpentine
She's my burning desire
She mystifies
Her love's lifting me higher than high

No one can stand in our way
Nothing can stop us on this day
I've never felt like this way

Can't let you slip away
Oh, oh
Can't let you slip away
Oh, oh
Can't let you slip away
Oh, oh

She danced like serpentine
She's my only desire
She mystifies
Her love's taking
Me higher
