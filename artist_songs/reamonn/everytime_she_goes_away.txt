Every time she leaves him
it cuts him like a knife.
And every time he holds her close.
He knows the reasons why.

Superboy loves Supergirl and they learned to fly.
In the night they find themselves
up in the sky, up in the sky.

And every time she goes away
there's something that he ought to say.
And every time he holds her close
there's something that he wants to know.

All the times he waited
all the empty nights.
And all the words he could not say,
the truth he realised.

Superboys got Supergirl and they learned to fly.
And in the night they find themselves
up in the sky, up in the sky.

Cause every time she goes away
there's something that she ought to say.
And every time he holds her close
there's something that she ought to know.

Yeah, superboy loves supergirl
and when that can't be.
In the sky, he'll search for her.
Where they are free...
Free just to be...

Cause every time he goes away
there's something that he ought to say.
And every time he holds her close
there's something that she ought to know.

But she knows it....
