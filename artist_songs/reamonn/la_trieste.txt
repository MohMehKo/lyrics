Tic toc the feelig stops, I sense that inner drop, it's inside my head
I feel your energy, my old age enemy, hey, what's that you said?
I think of all those lies, I ask the question why we did what we did
La Trieste calls my name, I feel I go insane
I thought she was dead
La Trieste, where are you now, do you hurt - hurt me somehow
La Trieste, where are you now, do you hurt - hurt me somehow
I wash in pores of rain to hide that hated pain for someone whose dead
I feel her come for me, my old age enemy, why can't we forget?
I feel it coming on that feelings growing strong, stronger than hate
For what I used to be with you controlling me
I killed you but still you're not dead
La Trieste...
It's a feeling, it's a feeling, it's inside my head
It's a feeling, it's a feeling, I killed you but still you're not dead
La Trieste...
It's Killing me, it's killing me, it's killing me, it's killing me
It's killing me, it's killing me, it's killing me
I killed you but still you're not dead
La Trieste...
It's killing me, it's killing me, it's killing me, it's killing me...
