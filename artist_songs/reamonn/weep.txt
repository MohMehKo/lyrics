She turns she burns she feels concealed by someone that she doesn't know
She hopes someday he'll find his way into these tears that she weeps
She knows she gave she feels enslaved by what she gave to easily
She hopes in time she waits in line for all these things that make her real

I feel that she woke up feel she's had enough
Fell it's time she opened up her eyes
I feel that she woke up feel shes had enough
Feel it's time she opened up her eyes

She holds the cold she feels so fooled by all this pain she has revealed
She hopes she cries she holds inside all these things that make her real

I feel that she woke up feel she's had enough
Fell it's time she opened up her eyes
I feel that she woke up feel shes had enough
Feel it's time she opened up her eyes

She screamed put your hands on me,
put your hands on me put your hands on I need to feel your touch
Put your hands on me,
put your hands on me put your hands on I need to feel your touch

I feel that she woke up feel she's had enough
Fell it's time she opened up her eyes
I feel that she woke up feel shes had enough
Feel it's time she opened up her eyes
