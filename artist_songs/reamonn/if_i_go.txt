There's a little part of me
inside of you
and it's growing up
as you do
And I hope you see this world
through my eyes
But I hope you don't see
the tears I cry

But if I go - ah yeah
Well it won't be long
'Cause if I stay...

And I hope you know
that it's not you
It's my life
and what I do
And I hope you know
that everyday
I hold you close
in some way

But if I go - ah yeah
Well, it won't be long
'Cause if I stay - ah yeah
Well it all goes wrong

But if I go - ah yeah
Well it won't be long
'Cause if I stay...

There's a little part of me
inside of you
And it's growing up
just like you do
And I hope you see this world
through my eyes
But I hope you don't see
the tears I cry

But if I go - ah yeah
Well it won't be long
'Cause if I stay - ah yeah
Well it all goes wrong

But if I go - ah yeah
Well it won't be long
'Cause if I stay...
