Cause I'm not giving up 
I'm not running away 
There's nowhere left to hide 
Cause I'm not going to chance 
Change to suit your ways 
I'd rather stand and fight

You feel your life gets turned around 
You feel your world come crashing down

This is not my faith 
This is not my faith 
This is not the reason why I live my life 
This is not my faith 
This is not my faith 
This is not the reason why I live my life

Treat me like you are 
Cause I'm unbreakable 
I've stood the test of time 
Or treat me with contempt 
Until the moment ends 
Then find somewhere to hide

You feel your life gets turned around 
You feel your world come crashing down

This is not my faith 
This is not my faith 
This is not the reason why I live my life 
This is not my faith 
This is not my faith 
This is not the reason why I live my life

Building bridges from broken cars 

Our salvation in the stars 
Pull the blinds and close your eyes 
You can't hide from this life

This is not my faith 
This is not my faith 
This is not the reason why I live my life 
This is not my faith 
This is not my faith 
This is not the reason why I live my life

Take me as I am 
You know that you can take or leave me
