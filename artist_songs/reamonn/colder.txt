It's getting colder now
The sun goes down behind
The trees that use to shutter the worry from your mind
It's getting colder now
Since you walked out that door
The space you left is endless
The emptiness is grown

And all I know is it's getting colder now
I can't stand that you're leaving
I know that it's not right
And all I know is it's getting colder now
And no one can replace you
I need you by my side

Is this really over now?
Is this our last goodbye?
With nothing left between us
With nothing left to try
Is this really over now?
Just look me in the eyes
Say that you don't feel it
And say that I'm not right

All I know
All I know
All I know
All I know

Is it's getting colder now
And no one can replace you
I need you by my side

Is it's getting colder now
And no one can replace you
I need you by my side

Is it's getting colder now
And no one can replace you
I need you by my side

It's getting colder now
