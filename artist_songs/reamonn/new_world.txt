This is our world but they destroy it they'll watch it burn in hell 
This is our world but they destroy it they'll watch it burn in hell 
This is your time you are the sign they can't take that away 
This is your dream hear the future scream for a brand new day 
One two buckle my shoe 
Three four knock on the door 
Five six pick up sticks 
Seven eight then it's to late 
This is our world they burn it so they burn in Hell 
This is our world they burn it so they burn in Hell - burn in hell 
Watch the clock you watch it tic you watch it toc 
Watch the slip of time this our world it's not yours it's not mine 
This is the dream this is the time we can make it turn 
We can't just watch can't just watch as it burns 
This our world and we destroy it we need to save ourselves 
One two
This is our world they burn it so they burn in hell 
This is our world they burn it so they burn in hell - burn in hell 
Can't you see that this is our world
