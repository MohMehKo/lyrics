I just want a day
to make it all OK
You, could you teach me
how to cry
You, could you teach me
how to cry

My eyes are dry - so bone dry
I just want one day
to show you I've got heart

My eyes are dry - so bone dry
You, could you teach me

My eyes are dry - so bone dry

Could you - would you - will you
Teach me how to cry
Could you - would you - will you
Teach me how to cry
Could you - would you - will you
Teach me how to cry
