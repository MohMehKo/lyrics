Only when you sleep 
Baby it's just a dream that's keeping you awake 
It's just a dream that's making you shake 
It's just a dream and soon it'll be gone 
You think you control it 
What you don't really know is 
That it's controlling you 
The fear of leaving and the nightmare of sleeping 
Not all your dreams come true 
It's only when you sleep when you sleep it all goes wrong 
In a moment of weakness 
You try to resolve this feeling you can't explain 
Then you notice it's not what you wanted 
You're driving yourself insane 
It's only when you sleep when you sleep it all goes wrong 
It's only when you sleep it's only when you sleep 
I could hold you I could save you yeah I could keep you from harm 
Cause she sleeps in a bad dream 
And she wakes in a movie scene next to one who cares 
It's only when you sleep only when you sleep it all goes wrong 
Cause she thinks she controls it she thinks she knows it 
It's just a dream just a lonely dream and then you wake
