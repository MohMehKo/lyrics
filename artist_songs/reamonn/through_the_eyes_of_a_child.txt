Sweet innocent child with your open eyes.
You've seen us for who we really are.
And I know that there'll be tomorrow.
So that hope can have it's glory day.
And I wish that this world would embrace you
from magic stars and mystery. 
My open heart...

[Refrain:]
Why did we make it so hard, this life is so complicated 
until we see it through the eyes of a child.
Why did we make it so hard, this life is so complicated 
until we see it through the eyes of a child.

I know you, I've seen your face before
you brought me to this open door
afraid to walk through.
Please take my hand.

I know that there will be tomorrow.
So that hope can have it's glory day? 
And I wish that this world embrace you
from magic stars and mystery.
My open heart... 

[Refrain:]
Why did we make it so hard, this life is so complicated 
until we see it through the eyes of a child.
Why did we make it so hard, this life is so complicated 
until we see it through the eyes of a child.

I see where we'll go from here.
'Cause love doesn't break
with the right amount of care
in your hands is whom you've choosen to be.
Life is a freedom.
Now go out there and be free.

[Refrain:]
Why did we make it so hard, this life is so complicated 
until we see it through the eyes of a child.
Why did we make it so hard, this life is so complicated 
until we see it through the eyes of a child.
Why did we make it so hard, this life is so complicated 
until we see it through the eyes of a child.
Why did we make it so hard, this life is so complicated 
until we see it through the eyes of a child.
