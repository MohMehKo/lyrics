Sweet red lips were laced with shame
Burning like eternal flame
Reached the point of no return 
Once inside you know you'll burn
For sweet Miss Valentine
Yeah, sweet Miss Valentine
Yeah you want Valentine
Yeah Sweet Miss Valentine
Streets will crash this story clean 
Rid the dirt from movie screens 
Trapped inside a timeless pain 
What you get is what you claim
From sweet Miss Valentine
Yeah, sweet Miss Valentine
Yeah you want Valentine
Yeah, sweet Miss Valentine
She knows how you feel she knows what you want
She knows you're not real and you'll never haunt
shell dress up in leather shell dress up in lace
shell dress up the lies and smile right in your face
Who do you think she was what do you this she is
Who do you think she was what do you this she is
Who do you think she was what do you this she is
She's miss Valentine
Yeah, sweet Miss Valentine
Yeah you want Valentine
Yeah, sweet Miss Valentine
Yeah she's Miss Valentine
Yeah, sweet Miss Valentine
Yeah you want Valentine
Yeah you got Valentine
