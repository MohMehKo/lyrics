When you're here, 
every thought I ever had,
becomes clear,
But when you're far,
the only light I ever see,
is the stars

And when you go,
the feelings burn,
as they grow
Cause to me,
to me you're beautiful

But when you're here Josephine, the stars don't shine so bright
But yeah with me, Josephine, you'd never sleep at night [x2]

But when you go I never sleep as I do
And in my dreams, 
I hold you like I never will release

But when you're here Josephine, the stars don't shine so bright
But yeah with me Josephine you'd never sleep at night [x2]
My Josephine
I'm dreaming of you
you dreaming it too
I'm dreaming of you
I scream your name

My Josephine

when you're here Josephine the stars don't shine so bright
But yeah with me Josephine you'd never sleep at night [x2]
My Josephine 

I'm dreaming of you
Are you dreaming it too
I'm dreaming of you
I scream your name
