Fantasy sexual dream prostitution solicitation intoxication seduction 
The unknown the endeavour to achieve sex 
Walks into a room sees the naked stare 
Feels the leering eyes eyes are everywhere 
Thoughts that will consume every wanting fool 
Thoughts that come to soon cheaper as a rule 
Everything she feels suddenly concealed 
Walking in high heels making dreams come real 
Everyone who thought he was in control 
Looking for cheap love this love is for fools 
When she comes she comes and goes 
Where she goes well no one knows 
If you think you're in control well she took you for the treasure 
When she comes she comes and goes 
Where she goes well no one knows 
If you think she's just your fool well you're paying for the pleasure of her love 
All the wasted smiles nothing left to feel 
All the lovers lies nothing here is real 
All the times they thought they were in control 
As she leaves the room nothing left but fools 
When she comes she comes and goes 
Where she goes well no one knows 
If you think you're in control well you're paying for the pleasure 
Everytime she comes everytime she runs 
Everytime you feel something is concealed 
Suddenly you know when she's letting go 
Suddenly you sell well she does it for her pleasure 
When she comes she comes and goes 
Where she goes well no one knows 
If you think you're in control well she took you for the treasure 
Everytime she comes everytime she runs 
Everytime you feel something is concealed 
Suddenly you know, when she's letting go 
Then you finally see well she does it for her pleasure 
When she comes.......
