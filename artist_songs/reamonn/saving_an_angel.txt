Angel, can you feel the sunshine on you today? 
Do you feel this way? 
Angel, do you feel the morning dawn down on you 
Do you feel it too? 
Love is just a kiss away, love is just a kiss away 

Angel, put your hand in my hand 
Let me lead the way, to real a lot to pay 
Angel, can you read in my mind 
I'm here for you, it's really true 

Love is just a kiss away... 

I'm saving an angel ... 

Angel, ... 

Angel, can you see in my eyes 
All the pain I see is ritually 
Angel, do you feel my heartbeat inside of you? 
I can feel it, too 

Love is just a kiss away... 

I'm saving an angel, ... 
got my hands on an angel... 

She takes me higher... 

Angel, can you feel the sunshine 
Shine down on you 
Do you feel it, too? 

Love is just a kiss away 
Love is just a kiss away 
Love is just a kiss away 

Love is just a kiss
