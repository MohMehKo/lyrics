I know what's eating up inside you 
I know you never tried to lie to 
All those who really want to help you 
Heal the pain that breaths inside of you

I hope we find a way together 
God knows we'll never make it better 
Unless we stick it out together 
We need the love of those who forgive us

And even though this life feels like it 
Has left you in the cold 
Hope is like a heart beat breathing in your soul

And if it's broken I 
Will try to fix it 
And if it's broken I 
I know we'll fix it

No one can feel your pain 
You carry with you 
No one can feel your strain 
And now you're broken

I know we try to get stronger 
Lord knows it's gonna take longer 
For you to forgive yourself 
And face in the mirror

And even though this lief feels like it 
It's left you in the cold 
Hope is like a heart beat breathing in your soul

And if it's broken I 
Will try to fix it 
And if it's broken I 
I know we'll fix it

No one can feel your pain 
You carry with you 
No one can feel your strain 
You're feeling like you're broken

Time heals all 
Yeah time heals all

Hope is like a heart beat breathing in your soul

And if it's broken I 
Will try to fix it 
And if it's broken I 
I know we'll fix it 
If it's broken I 
Will try to fix it 
And if it's broken I 
I know we'll fix it

No one can feel your pain that you carried with you 
No one could feel your strain that you carried with you 
No one can feel your pain that you carried with you 
No one could feel your strain I know you're broken
