(I know, that you. I know, that you. 
Anyone, but you.)

Everytime I realize theres something wrong when I see you.
The way you try to prophesize that dreams just can't come true.
Those times you try to undermind my reach for what I still believe.
The times you try to bring me down, cut me up, and watch me bleed.

(I know.)

But now the hand of fate has turned, opened up and turned inside.
What you stole, dreams returned. My belief in life.

(I know.)

When you turn, you, you turn aside. 
When you burn, you, you burn alive.

Cause everytime I opened up, well, you were never 'round
And everytime I lost myself, you were nowhere to be found.
I lived inside an innocence, but innocence was born to die.
Inside the soul of everyone who's lost their faith in life.

Life is a dream to me.
Life is a dream to me.

Sometimes I wondered it you knew it all the time.
I tried to stop my innocence from leaving you behind. 
I thought that you were powerful,
I once believed that you were strong.
But now when I look at you, I realize theres something wrong.

When you turn, you, you turn aside. 
When you burn, you, you burn alive.

Cause everytime I opened up, well, you were never 'round
And everytime I lost myself, you were nowhere to be found.
I lived inside an innocence, but innocence was born to die.
Inside the soul of everyone who's lost their faith in life.

And life is a dream to me.
This life is a dream to me.
Yeah life is a dream to me.
Your life is a dream to me.

Cause now you wanna open up but theres no one around
And now you wanna lose yourself in the hope that you'll be found.
I see you find your innocence.
I see your soul wants to fly.
You feel the hand of fate has turned and given you back your life.

My is a dream to you, and me.
Life is a dream to you, and me.
Your life is a dream to you, and me.
