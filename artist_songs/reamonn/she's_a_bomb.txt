She feels electric
to the touch.
Sugar coated lemon drop
is how she looks.
Strange and eclectic.
A little much.
Every second counts
before your time is up.
Your time is up.
Come on, come on (time is up)
Come on, come on (time is up)
Come on, come on (time is up)

You can hear her a...
Tic, Tic, Tic, Tic.

She's a bomb and
she's gonna explode.
She's sky-rocket.
Yeah, she's overload.
No need to whisper cause
she already knows.
Yeah, she's too hot to handle
but you can't let go.
So come on!

You've been infected
by her touch.
Racing through your veins
you'll never get enough.
Get enough.
Come on, come on (get enough)
Come on, come on (get enough)
Come on, come on (get enough)

You can hear her a...
Tic, Tic, Tic, Tic, Tic, Tic, Tic, Tic

She's a bomb and
she's gonna explode.
She's sky-rocket.
Yeah, she's overload.
No need to whisper cause
she already knows.
Yeah, she's too hot to handle
but you can't let go.
So, come on!
Yeah, come on!
Let's go!

Tic, tic, boom!
Tic, tic, boom!
Tic, tic, boom!
Tic, tic, boom!

She's a bomb and
she's gonna explode.
She's loves' addiction.
And you have overdosed.
She's a bomb and
she's gonna explode.
She's a bomb and
she's gonna explode.
