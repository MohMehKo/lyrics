Oh no not you oh no not you anyone but you 
Everytime I realise there's something wrong when I see you 
The way you try to prophesise that dreams just can't come true 
The times you tried to undermine my reach what I still believe 
The times you tried to bring me down cut me up and make me bleed 
But now the hand of faith has turned opened up and turned inside 
What you stole dreams returned my belief in life 
And when you turn you- you turn inside and when you burn- you burn inside 
Cause everytime I opened up you were never around 
And everytime I lost myself you were nowhere to be found 
I lived inside an innocence but innocence ws born to die 
Inside the soul of everyone whose lost their faith in life 
And life is a dream to me- life is a dream 
Sometimes I wonder if you knew it all the time 
And tried to stop my innocence from leaving you behind 
I thought that you were powerful I thought that you were strong 
But now when I look around I realise there's something wrong 
And when you turn you- you turn inside and when you burn- you burn alive 
Cause everytime I opened up you were never around 
And eveytime I lost myself you were nowhere to be found 
I lived inside an innocence but innocence was born to die 
Inside the... 
But now you want to open up but there is no one around 
Now you try to loose yourself in the hope your soul wants to fly 
You feel the hand of faith has turned and given you back your life 
Life is a dream to you and me- life is a dream to you and me
Life is a dream to you and me
