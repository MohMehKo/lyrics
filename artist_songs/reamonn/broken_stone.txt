She said she wants to get out of the way 
And find a new time 
She's searching for the words 
She's out of her mind 
She thought she was approachable 
She's feeling so emotional 
Throw her hands up, surrenders to the night 
She's lost and lonely no one holds her 
As she's walking home 
She sounds so nervous as she's talking on the telephone 
She thought she understood but now she's just thinking 
She's on a big ship and she feels likes she's sinking

Cause her heart is a broken stone 
Her shooting star is out on loan

There's nothing left to say 
And nothing left to try 
No need to walk away 
There's no one else in sight 
She feels like she's disposable 
She hated being controllable 
Throws her hands up, surrenders to the fight 
You know she's wishing for it 
You see it on her lips 
She'd dance so slowly 
You could feel it in her moving hips 
I know she's dreaming like a cat on the street 
It's only what she'd give is what you can keep

Cause in her heart is broken stone 
Here shooting star is out on loan 
Cause in her heart is broken stone 
Sweet angel, sweet angel 
Just find a piece of ground 
And make it your own

Just find a piece of ground 
And make it your own 
Cause in her heart is broken stone 
Her shooting star is out on loan 
Cause in her heart is broken stone

You can't mend it, you can't mend it 
Just find a piece of ground 
And make it your own 
Cause in her heart is broken stone 
Her shooting star is out on loan
