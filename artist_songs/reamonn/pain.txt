All these words rushing round inside my head
All these thoughts we held so close and still we never said 
All these dreams I can't believe what I would do for you
Holding on is there anything left to loose
There's something beautiful about you but I just 
can't explain I found it in the rain I found it in the rain 
So much Pain, so much Pain is coming down will you hold me close again, 
hold me close again.
So much Pain, so much Pain is coming down will you hold me close again, 
hold me close again.
I cannot understand, I tried so hard to understand all this love I have for you forever and a day
All these words don't mean much when we turn our backs away 
All these thoughts will be crushed if there's nothing left to say
I will not remain silenced by the claim that it 
hurts I will fight for love I will fight for what it once was.
There's something beautiful about you but I just 
can't explain I found it in the rain I found it in the rain 
So much Pain, so much Pain is coming down will you
hold me close again, hold me close again.
So much Pain, so much Pain is coming down will you 
hold me close again, hold me close again.
So much Pain, so much Pain is coming down will you
hold me close again, hold me close again.
