Who decides when the time has come to role the dice? 
And say goodbye 
Should be fight or try to see it from the other side 
There's black or white 
Who was right never seems to be the question why 
Just close your eyes

You know 
It's over now 
It's over now 
Time to face the music no need for excuses 
It's over now 
It's over now 
I'm picking up the pieces in a cardboard box of reasons

I'm feeling light 
Now the weight of leaving passes bye 
With time 
Wrong or right 
No one else can save you from the nights 
And your mind 
Sorry eyes staring round the room 
A port to cry 
I'm saving lives

You know it's over now 
It's over now 
Time to face the music no need for excuses 
It's over now 
It's over now 
I'm picking up the pieces in a cardboard box of reasons

And if you think of it like child's play 
Life is just a colour book of rhymes 
You gotta paint by the numbers

Thank God 
It's over now 
It's over now 
Time to face the music no need for excuses 
It's over now 
It's over now 
I'm picking up the pieces in a cardboard box of reasons

It's over now 
Thank God 
It's over now 
Thank God 
It's over now 
It's over now 
Time to face the music no need for excuses 
It's over now 
It's over now 
I'm picking up the pieces in a cardboard box of reasons 
It's over now
