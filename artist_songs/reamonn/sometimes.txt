Words on her lips
Begin to slip
She's loosing her grip
On herself
And when she wants more
Oh no, no
She can't have more
Oh no, no
She feels like she's holding back
a life that she deserves

She said Sometimes
You 're asking yourself why
You feel you can't get by
You feel you 're crawling on your knees

A voice from inside
Oh no, no
Is telling her lies
Oh no, no
Her dreams come crashing down
Like a burning sky at night
No longer a child
You are the one
You can't deny
What you have become
It can't hurt you
But it can eat you up inside

She said sometimes
You 're asking yourself why
You feel you can't get by
You feel you 're crawling on your knees

She said sometimes
You 're asking yourself why
You feel you can't get by
You 're sick of begging, begging please

And now you stand up
And look them straight in the eyes
You 're not believing their lies
Your taking it straight from the heart
It's time for a new start
Time for a new start
Cause if it's not love well
It's not enough
You deserve more yeah
More than what you've got
Inside a voice is screaming
Get off your knees
Get up

She screams
Sometimes
Sometimes their lies are their disguise
Sometimes the beautiful will cry
You 're reaching inside
And now you're floating like a breeze
And saying goodbye
