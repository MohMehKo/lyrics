Sometimes I find myself stuck in the middle with nowhere to turn
So I pull it in and tell myself it all works out
But then again no one helps when things go wrong
So I saved myself saved myself I learned how to swim

Sometimes you find yourself stuck in the crowd with nowhere to turn
So you go against what everybody feels but feelings burn
Then you'll see that no one person rules the world
You tell yourself that everybody learns how to swim
With it don't fight the tide, don't fight the tide
Just swim with it but first...

You put your feet on the ground
I can't pick you up every time you're falling down
No I'm not your mother or your father
You put your feet on the ground
I can't pick you up every time you're falling down
No I can't go any further but I know

It's hard to do the right thing in the right place
When you want to do something else in their face
Do what I do don't turn your back and walk away no
Do what I do and learn how to swim

With it don't fight the tide, don't fight the tide
Just swim with it but first...
You put your feet on the ground
I can't pick you up every time you're falling down
No I'm not your mother or your father
You put your feet on the ground
I can't pick you up every time you're falling down
No I can't go any further NO NO

Just learn how to swim
With it don't fight the tide, don't fight the tide
Just swim with it but first...

You put your feet on the ground
I can't pick you up every time you're falling down
No I'm not your mother or your father
You put your feet on the ground
I can't pick you up every time you're falling down
No I can't go any further
Put your feet on the ground
Won't you put your feet on the ground, no I can't pick you up
Everytime you're falling down
Put your feet on the ground
And learn how to swim
With it don't fight the tide, don't fight the tide
Just swim...
