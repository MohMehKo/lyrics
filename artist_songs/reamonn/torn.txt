I was beaten by the rains
of December
I was thrown into a world
that I remember
Hated me and so I hate it too

I was freed by all the rules
that ensaved me
I was forged from all the
thoughts that you gave me
That is why i come for you

I was Torn and I was Worn
and I was broke in two
I was Torn and I was Worn
and I was broke in two
I was Torn and I was Worn
and I was broke in two
I was much more
much more before I met you

I defied all the whores
that you sent here
Bringing pain through the haze
until it's all clear
What you think is good for you

I remember all your senseless
words of wisdom
You raise your hand
like a flag call it religion
learn the lies
Butcheries the truth

I was Torn and I was Worn
and I was broke in two
I was Torn and I was Worn
and I was broke in two
I was Torn and I was Worn
and I was broke in two
I was much more
much more before I met you

Can't see it - Can't feel it
Can't see it - Can't feel it
Can't see it - Can't feel it
I feel the rain come
falling down

I was Torn and I was Worn
and I was broke in two
I was Torn and I was Worn
and I was broke in two
I was Torn and I was Worn
and I was broke in two
I was much more
much more before I met you

Can't feel it - can't see it
Can't feel it - Can't see it
