Cheek to cheek
I feel
Like I'm in heaven now
Here with you
In a room
Where dancing girls
Entertain the crowd
Skies To by to
Cheek to cheek
An angel
Spoke of love to me
And then she smiled
Before she disappeared

Cause, we have got today
We have got tonight
There's no need for us
To say goodbye
We have got today
We have got tonight
As crazy as it seems
It seems right

Hand in hand
I feel
Like In can trust someone
Someone like you
I could float
Like a cloud
High above the sky
Through and through
Hand in Hand
I feel
Like your mine
Don't disappear
Before we have tonight

Cause, we have got today
We have got tonight
There's no need for us
To say goodbye
Skies We have got today
We have got tonight
As crazy as it feels
It feels right
We have got today
We have got tonight
And it feels right
