Two times today I had to call you up to let you down 
Don't wanna let you down
Two times today I ran out of luck and I let you down 
Don't wanna let you down
Cause I fall down when you're not around
Yeah I fall down when you're not around
Two times today I messed up and let you down 
Don't wanna let you down
Thought I heard you say I nearly lost your love
cause I let you down 
Don't wanna let you down
Cause I fall down when you're not around
Yeah I fall down when you're not around
I fell down two times today
I fell down two times today
Yeah I fall down when you're not around
Yeah I fall down when you're not around
