I See The Fear In The Things We Don't Understand
I See The Fear In Another Blind Man
I Can't Hold Back This Fight That Stills Inside
I Can't Hold Back Who I Am

I Know You're Strong
I Know You Belong
I Know You Are Strong
My Beautiful One

I Know You're Strong
I Know You Belong
I Know You Are Strong
My Beautiful One

I Can't Turn Away From What I Believe
I Can't Destroy Or Deceive Oh No Oh No
I Know A Beauty In All That I Can See
I Can't Hold On But You Can't Release

I Know You're Strong
I Know You Belong
I Know You Are Strong
My Beautiful One

I Know You're Strong
I Know You Belong
I Know You Are Strong
My Beautiful One

Cause They Can't Hold You
And They Can't Hold Me
And They Can't Hold On
To What They Can't Believe

Cause They Can't Hold You
And They Can't Hold Me
And They Can't Hold On
To What They Can't Believe

I Know You're Strong
My Beautiful One
I Know You're Strong
I Know You Belong

I Know You're Strong
My Beautiful One
I Know You're Strong
I Know You Belong

I Know You're Strong
My Beautiful One
