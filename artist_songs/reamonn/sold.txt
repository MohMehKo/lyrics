I want to set you free
Sold I said is how you treated me
I've been fooled for to long by all your misery
You said you'd meet me in the sky we'd open up the night 
I let you climb right in
You said you'd meet me in the sky we'd open up the night 
I let you climb right in I let you climb right in
I'm just trying to let you know that if you ever let me go 
You loose control, you know I can't be Sold
Count the cost of what you lost
You've been cruel to me the way you let me down
And I've been blind and deceived tried to stand your ground
You said you'd meet me in the sky we'd open up the night 
I let you climb right in
You said you'd meet me in the sky we'd open up the night 
I let you climb right in I let you climb right in
I'm just trying to let you know that if you ever let me go 
You loose control, you know I can't be Sold
I feel this world just rushing bye 
Changing right before my eyes 
All that glitters is not gold 
And all that's precious can't be sold
I'm just trying to let you know that if you ever let me go 
You loose control, you know I can't be Sold
I'm just trying to let you know that if you ever let me go 
You loose control, you know I can't be Sold
