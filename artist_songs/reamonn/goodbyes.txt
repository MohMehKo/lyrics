We both dressed as we thought fit 
What do you wear to goodbyes? 
The time would come for us both to sit 
And near each other's lies

I don't feel like I've been holding back 
Breaking up is hard on us both 
I feel so empty as you walk away 
These words have no meaning 
There's nothing to say

So Goodbye 
Goodbye 
These words have no meaning 
When your heart set on leaving 
Goodbye 
Goodbye 
Now there's nothing worth keeping 
Nothing left to believe in 
And when think the fighting is over 
Then come the sleepless nights 
Of wanting to hold her 
Goodbye

I can barely remember the love 
But I can still hear the fights 
Standing in the hallway 
Screaming the top of your voice 
You know you were right

I don't feel like I've been holding back 
It cuts like a knife but it still feels like life

So Goodbye, Goodbye 
These words have no meaning 
When your heart set on leaving 
Goodbye, Goodbye 
Now there's nothing worth keeping 
Nothing left to believe in 
And when think the fighting is over 
Then come the sleepless nights 
Of wanting to hold her

Goodbye 
You said it wouldn't hurt 
But now say it's not getting better 
We tried 
So hard to make it work 
I thought that I'd be with you forever

Goodbye, Goodbye 
These words have no meaning 
When your heart set on leaving

Goodbye, Goodbye 
Thought this might be worth saving 
But I must be mistaken

Goodbye, Goodbye 
Now I'm ready to let you

I see you leaving 
I start believing

I finally think the fight is over 
No more sleepless nights 
Of wanting to hold her 
Goodbye
