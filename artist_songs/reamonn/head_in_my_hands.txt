Crouched in your room
it happened too soon
I know
Insults were thrown
you think that you'd grown
by now
Feelings inside
start to subside
and grow
Where are you now
Where are you now
let me know

You got your head in your hands
stop screaming
You got your head in your hands
stop screaming
stop screaming
Cause the world wakes up
and it pulls you in
you can do no wrong
it's loving you still
Yeah the world wakes up
and it pulls you in
you can do no wrong
it's loving you still

It's loving you still

Where are you now
where are you now
tell me
Are you scratching your eyes
are you torn up inside
tell us see
Did your walls tumble down
did they push you around
too much
have you nothing to say
are you running away
from the touch

You got your head in your hands
stop screaming
You got your head in your hands
stop screaming
stop screaming
Cause the world wakes up
and it pulls you in
you can do no wrong
it's loving you still
Yeah the world wakes up
and it pulls you in
you can do no wrong
it's loving you still

It's loving you still
loving you still
loving you still
It's loving you

Yeah the world wakes up
and it pulls you in
you can do no wrong
it's loving you still
Yeah the world wakes up
and it pulls you in
you can do no wrong
it's loving you still

Yeah the world wakes up
Yeah the world wakes up
Yeah the world wakes up
I wish the world wakes up

It's loving you still
loving you still
loving you still
loving you
