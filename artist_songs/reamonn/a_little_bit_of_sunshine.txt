Washed streets feel the sun beat down upon you
I can see as the wind catch your hair your face smiles
And I know deep inside that you're wondering why you're hurting
Try not to hide cause I know we'll make it through 
Cause what we have is gonna last
A little bit of sunshine, a little bit of rain
We're gonna make it through this
Yeah we can start again
It's a little bit of sunshine, a little bit of rain
We're gonna make it through this
Yeah we can start again
And I know it's hard for you now
Yeah I feel the same but I'm holding on some how
Stand by me and I will stand by you
And the love that we have will help me make it through
C'est la vie mon ami
It's a little bit of sunshine, A little bit of rain
We're gonna make it through this
Yeah we can start again
It's little bit of sunshine, 
A little bit of rain
We're gonna make it through this
Yeah we can start again
But it's true gotta want it gotta need it so bad
Can't let it slip out of our hands
Gotta hold on tight make it right
Gotta carry on stayin strong
In my heart I can't believe
That you or I would leave 
Yeah I'm holding tight, holding tight
Holding on to you,
My little bit of sunshine
My little bit rain coming
We're gonna make it through this
Yeah we can start again
It's a little bit of sunshine, A little bit of rain
We're gonna make it through this
Yeah we can start again
my little bit of sunshine
My little bit rain coming
We're gonna make it through this
Yeah we can start again
