Look me in the eyes tell me what you see inside of me
Look me in the eyes and tell can you see how much I need You
Take me by the hand tell me what you feel, feel for me
Take me by the hand and tell me is it real or is it just fantasy
'Cause I see and I believe in you and me and I hold in side the seed of our lives
Now you can decide if what you believe is really true 
I see in your eyes what you really need you're afraid to loose it's true, you, 
you'll see we can live this fantasy
'Cause I see and I believe in you and me and I hold in side the seed of our lives
Take me by the hand and I'll show you my promised land
Take me by the hand and I'll show you my promised land
Take me by the hand and I'll show you my promised land
Take me by the hand and I'll show you my promised land
Take me by the hand and I'll show you my promised land
