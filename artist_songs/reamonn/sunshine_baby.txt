Won't you be my sunshine baby? in a world that's sometimes crazy
I see through my window, I see through the trees
I'm watching the world as it falls on it knees
I hope for tomorrow, hope for today 
I'm lost for the words with so much to say
No one can tell me, answer me why 
I'm watching the world as it's crashing me by
Can you see the reasons, the ones that are true?
Tell me there's me and there's me and there's you 
Won't you be my sunshine baby? you know your words always save me
Won't you be my sunshine baby? in a world that's sometimes crazy
I see through my window the stars as they shine
I know in my heart that's there's still enough time
To make a difference, to make a change
To make a world where we're glad that we came
All that was righteous and all that was wrong 
All that was written can be undone 
Tell me the reasons and say that their true 
Tell me there's hope and say that it's you
Won't you be my sunshine baby? you know your words always save me
Wont you be my sunshine baby? in a world that's sometimes crazy
And I'm rooted like a willow Tree
I'm reaching out to the sea as you hold on to me
And I'm gonna stop the hands of time
So the sun can always shine and the world will finally see
Won't you be my sunshine baby? in a world that's sometimes crazy
Won't you be my sunshine baby? you know your words always save me
Won't you be my Sunshine baby? in a world that's sometimes crazy
Sometimes Crazy
