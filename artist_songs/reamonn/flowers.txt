She brought me flowers and then she'd say
Don't give me emotion cause I'll throw it away
She brought me flowers I heard her say
Don't give me emotion cause I'll throw I'll throw it away
Throwing it away

She's got the power to make me stay
I don't know if you like it but I just can't run away
She's got the power to make me stay I don't know if you like it
But I just can't, just can't run away
Just can't run away

And what I've learned - learned from this is - is that a kiss
is just a kiss
And what I've learned - learned from her
Is that to love you gotta be who you are No
You can't just turn - turn away from who you are
what you wanted to be
You gotta learn - learn to see that it's not
enough - enough for me

She brought me flowers just to say
She'd packed her bags she's leaving she's on her way
She brought me flowers and that's ok
Cause somethings last forever and somethings fade away
