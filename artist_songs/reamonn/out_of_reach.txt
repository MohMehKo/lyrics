I see a smile that lights a million
I'll hold your hand tonight
I'll wait with stars shining on me
I know it's time

And when will we learn to keep
And when will we walk so deep
And when will we love again
You are still out of reach

And I'll scream these valleys down
And I'll wake this mind
And I'll make this world turn on it's knees
And I'll make you mine

And when will we learn to see
And when will we take defeat
And when will we love again
You are still out of reach

I know this pain inside
Will set a love alight
These feelings they burn like coal
You've trenched it in your soul

And when will learn to love
And when will we once agree
And when will we love again
You are still out of reach
