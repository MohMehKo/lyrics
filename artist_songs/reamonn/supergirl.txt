You can tell by the way
She walks that she's my girl
You can tell by the way she talks she rules the world
You can see in her eyes that no one is her chain
She's my girl my Super girl

And then she'd say it's OK I got lost on the way
But I'm a Super girl and Super girls don't cry
And then she'd say its all right I got home late last night
But I'm a Super girl and Super girls just fly

And then she'd say that nothing can go wrong
When you're in love what can go wrong
And then she'd laugh the nighttime into the day
Pushing her fears further along

And then she'd say it's OK I got lost on the way
But I'm a Super girl and Super girls don't cry
And then she'd say it's all right I got home late last night
But I'm a Super girl and Super girls just fly

Then she'd shout down the line tell me she's got no more time
Cause she's a Super girl and Super girls don't cry
Then she'd scream in my face tell me to leave, leave this place
Cause she's a Super girl and Super girls just fly
She's a Super girl a Super girl

She's sewing seeds she's burning trees
She's sewing seeds she's burning trees
She's a Super girl a Super girl
A Super girl my Super girl
