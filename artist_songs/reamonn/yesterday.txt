I know you can see me, god knows you can hear me
I'm standing outside your door, watching you slip away.
Will like when to love is kiss, I felt denial, why do we do this
there's so much left to say, oh please open up.

We can turn back the time you and me can make this feel right
we go back to the start before it all starts falling apart.

Yesterday was the day when everything felt right
you and me we belong to yesterdays life, to yesterdays life.

And if its so easy for you to leave me,
why did you say goodbye with tears in your eyes.
You said that you staying in, watching your world on your TV-screen
but there`s nothing on film tonight, you know I'm right so

Turn back the time you and me can make this feel right
we go back to the start before it all starts falling apart.

Yesterday was the day when everything felt right
you and me we belong to yesterdays life, to yesterdays life.

Everyone crashes in birth, everyone tries to move on
Tell me will we ever return, to when we both felt so young
Everyone have ever known, just trying to make it on their own now
I thought that we where do any right, and now I just want to

Turn back the time so you and me can make this feel right
we go back to the start before it all starts falling apart.

Yesterday was the day when everything felt right
you and me we belong to yesterdays life, to yesterdays life.
To yesterdays life, to yesterdays life.
