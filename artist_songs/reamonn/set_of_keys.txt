Words going out they're bringin you down 
They've searched for a reason that's never been found 
It hits like a burnout they're reaching inside 
There's no where to run now there's nowhere to hide

Oh if you want it 
Oh if you got it 
Oh if you want it 
I'm begging you please I'm giving you love and a set of keys 
I'm begging you please I'm giving you love and a set of keys 
I'm begging you please

Hope is a weakness you just can't afford 
They'll tear you to pieces for little or more 
Just when you feel like you're out of their reach 
They're standing before you 
You're begging them please

Oh if you want it 
Oh if you got it 
Oh if you want it 
I'm begging you please I'm giving you love and a set of keys 
I'm begging you please I'm giving you love and a set of keys 
I'm begging you please I'm giving you love and a set of keys

Cause I can't be the one to catch ypu when you fall 
I can't be the one to pick up the pieces 
And I won't be the one to catch you when you fall cause I I won't be the one 
Cause I won't let you go

I'm begging you please I'm giving you love and a set of keys 
I'm begging you please I'm giving you love and a set of keys 
I'm begging you please I'm giving you love and a set of keys 
I'm bagging you please 
I give you love
