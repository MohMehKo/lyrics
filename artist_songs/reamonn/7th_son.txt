(He's coming)
This is Liberty
This is Prodigy
That was Etenity
And this is Torn and Born
You feel you're coming home
You feel you're coming home
This is Liberty because I say
And this is Prodigy in some strange way
That was Eternity for all time
And this is Torn and Born
You feel you're coming
You are the 7th son you are
You are the 7th son you are
You are the 7th son you are
You feel you're coming
You are the 7th son you are
You are the 7th son you are
You are the 7th son you are
You feel you're coming home

This is wrong and that is right
This is time the time of Life
This is Reach and that is Torn
It's where you reach cause it's where you're born
This is Fear and that is Claim
That is why you feel the Pain
And this is Torn and Born
You feel you're coming
You are the 7th son you are
You are the 7th son you are
You are the 7th son you are
You feel you're coming
You are the 7th son you are
You are the 7th son you are
You are the 7th son you are
You feel you're coming home
You feel You feel
This is right and that is rite
This is Fear the Fear to fight
That is Defeat and this War
And that is reaching what you're reaching for!!
