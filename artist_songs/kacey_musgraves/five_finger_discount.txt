Well I know you stole my panties 'cause I have the matching bra
My girlfriend said she saw you out with my favorite red dress on
She said you were dancin' in my black snakeskin flats
Actin' like a stripper and you didn't even match

You want a five finger discount
But nothin' in life is free
How 'bout you work hard for what you want 
Instead of liftin' it from me
If it'll help just a little, I'll give you the middle 
Ought to help you cut the cost
Can't give you a five finger discount
But here's twenty percent off 

I can't believe what you done to me after lettin' you in my house
Who knew you were casin' the joint, while sleepin' on my couch
I'm sure you'll find forgiveness, yeah I'm willing to bet
'Cause that's my grandma's Jesus necklace hangin' 'round your neck

You want a five finger discount
But nothin' in life is free
How 'bout you work hard for what you want 
Instead of jackin' it from me
If it'll help just a little, I'll give you the middle 
Ought to help you cut the cost
Can't give you a five finger discount
But here's twenty percent off 

The cops ain't gonna help me
But this town is pretty small
I'm gonna find out when I find you that
Pretty girls can brawl 

'Cause you want a five finger discount
But nothin' in life is free
Well you better hope that karma ain't a bigger bitch than me
If it'll help just a little, I'll give you the middle 
Ought to help you cut the cost
Can't give you a five finger discount 
But here's twenty percent off 
Yeah a five finger discount
But here's twenty percent off
Screw you
