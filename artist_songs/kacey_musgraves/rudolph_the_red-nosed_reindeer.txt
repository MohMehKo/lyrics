Well, here's one for all the little kids
You know Dasher and Dancer and Prancer and Vixen
Comet and Cupid and Donner and Blitzen
But do you recall the most famous reindeer of all?

Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer had a very shiny nose
Well, and if you ever saw it, you would even say it glowed
(Like a light bulb)
All of the other reindeer used to laugh and call him names
Oh, they never let poor Rudolph join in any reindeer games
Oh, then one foggy Christmas Eve
Oh, Santa came to say (Ho ho ho)
Rudolph, with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?
Well, then all reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee (Hee hee)
Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer, you'll go down in history

Yeah, you'll go down, go down in history
