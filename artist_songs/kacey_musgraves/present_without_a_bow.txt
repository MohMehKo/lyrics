[Kacey Musgraves:]
We've been moving too fast and we should slow down
Come and sit by the fire, stop rushing around
'Cause this time of year, it's meant for two
So don't leave me lonely if I don't have you

The holiday's just another day that's cold
Standing all alone under the mistletoe
I don't feel the cheer, ooh, without you here
There's no red and white stripes on a candy cane
And Silent Night just wouldn't sound the same
Where'd the magic go?
All I know is me without you is like a present without a bow

[Leon Bridges:]
Before we know, the wreath will come down
The halls won't be decked, there'll be no snow on the ground
The new year will come and bring lots of change, babe
And if I'm not with you girl, sippin' on champagne

[Kacey Musgraves:]
The holiday's just another day that's cold
Standing all alone under the mistletoe
I don't feel the cheer, ooh, without you here
There's no red and white stripes on a candy cane
And Silent Night just wouldn't sound the same
Where'd the magic go?
All I know is me without you is like a present without a bow

[Both:]
The holiday's just another day that's cold
Standing all alone under the mistletoe
I don't feel the cheer, ooh, without you here
There's no red and white stripes on a candy cane
And Silent Night just wouldn't sound the same
Where'd the magic go?
All I know is me without you is like a present without a bow

Me without you is like a present without a bow, girl
Sit by the fire, we've been moving too fast
