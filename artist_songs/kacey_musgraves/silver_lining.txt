Woke up on the wrong side of rock bottom
You're all out of pennies and the well it done run dry
You'd light 'em up and smoke 'em if you had 'em
But you just ain't got 'em
Yeah, ain't we always looking for a bluer sky?

If you're ever gonna find a silver lining
It's gotta be a cloudy day
It's gotta be a cloudy day
If you wanna fill your bottle up with lightning
You're gonna have to stand in the rain
You're gonna have to stand in the rain

Hoo hoo hoooo
Hoo hoo hoooo
Hoo hoo hoooo
Hoo

The lemonade keeps turning into lemons
And you wear your heart on a ripped unraveled sleeve
Been run through the wringer
And pushed plum to your limit
You say you're just unlucky but luck ain't what you need

'Cause if you're ever gonna find a four leaf clover
You gotta get a little dirt on your hands
You gotta get a little dirt on your hands
And if you wanna find a head that fits your shoulder
You're gonna have to go to the dance
You're gonna have to go to the dance

If you wanna find the honey
You can't be scared of the bees
And if you wanna see the forest
You're gonna have to look past the trees

Cause if you're ever gonna find a silver lining
It's gotta be a cloudy day
It's gotta be a cloudy day
If you wanna fill your bottle up with lightning
You're gonna have to stand in the rain
You're gonna have to stand in the rain

Hoo hoo hoooo
Hoo hoo hoooo
Hoo hoo hoooo
Hoo, yea

Hoo hoo hoooo
Hoo hoo hoooo
Hoo hoo hoooo
Hoo, hoo, hoo
