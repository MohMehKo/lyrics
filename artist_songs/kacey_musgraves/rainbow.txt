When it rain it pours but you didn't even notice
It ain't rainin' anymore, It's hard to breathe when all we know is
The struggle of staying above, the rising water line

The sky is finally open, the rain and wind stopped blowin'
But you're stuck out in the same old storm again
Hold tight to your umbrella, darlin' I'm just tryin' to tell ya
That there's always been a rainbow hangin' over your head

If you could see what I see, you'd be blinded by the colours
Yellow, red and orange and green, and atleast a million others
Tie up your bow, take off your coat and take a look around

'Cause the sky is finally open, the rain and wind stopped blown'
But you're stuck out in the same old storm again
Hold tight to your umbrella, darlin' I'm just tryin' to tell ya
That there's always been a rainbow hangin' over your head

So tie up your bow, take off your coat and take a look around
Everything is alright now
'Cause the sky is finally open, the rain and wind stopped blowin'
But you're stuck out in the same old storm again
Let go of your umbrella, darlin' I'm just tryin' to tell ya
That there's always been a rainbow hangin' over your head
Yeah there's always been a rainbow hangin' over your head
