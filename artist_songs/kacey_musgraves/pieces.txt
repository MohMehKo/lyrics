Dance around 
A little flame 
Candles burn out your name
Empty chair
Stands so bold
Your not here anymore

I live my life from lie to lie
And I'm a train wreck on the the inside
I  wish I could be but I think I am
Over you and up again 
I live in pieces

Everyday makes a hole an it
Tears away at my tired soul
I don't sleep (I can't sleep without you)
And I can't cry (I'm always crying) 
Empty house full glass of wine

I live my life from lie to lie
And I'm a train wreck on the the inside
I  wish I could be but I think I am
Over you and up again 
I live in pieces

Dance around a little flame
Candles burn out your name
