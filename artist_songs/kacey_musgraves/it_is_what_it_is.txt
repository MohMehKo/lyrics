I think we're thinking too hard, 
So, put on your shoes and get in your car, 
Put it in drive and point it this way, 
We don't have to talk, 
You don't have to stay, 

But I ain't got no one sleeping with me, 
And you ain't got nowhere that you need to be,
Maybe I love you,
Maybe I'm just kind of bored,
It is what it is
'Til it ain't anymore

We've tried being apart,
But the truth is,
We are who we are,
We're so much alike,
It ain't a good thing,
Too dumb to give up,
Too stubborn to change

But I ain't got no one sleeping with me,
And you ain't got nowhere that you need to be,
Maybe I love you,
Maybe I'm just kind of bored,
It is what it is
'Til it ain't anymore

'Til something better comes along,
'Til whatever we have is gone

But I ain't got no one sleeping with me,
And you ain't got nowhere that you need to be,
Maybe I love you,
Maybe I'm just kind of bored,
It is what it is
'Til it ain't anymore
Yeah, it is what it is
'Til it ain't anymore
