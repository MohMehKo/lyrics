Sometimes good intentions 
Don't come across so well
Got me analyzing everything that ain't worth thinking bout

Just 'cause I ain't lived through
The same hand that was dealt to you
Doesn't make me any less or make any more of you

I wouldn't trade my best day
So you could validate
All your fears
And if I've only got one shot
Won't waste it on a shadow box
I'll stand right here

'Cause it's all talk talk talk
Talking in the wind
It only slows you down when you start listening
And it's a whole lot harder to shine
Than undermine
Yeah, undermine

First mile is always harder
When you're leaving what you know
Won't blame me if you stay here waving to me as I go

I always wish the best for you
Hoped that you would see me through
My wildest dreams
Yeah, the ones you thought I'd never make

Still, you would trade your best day
Just to have your way
All these years
But if you only had one shot
Maybe all this talk
Would disappear

'Cause it's all talk talk talk
Talking in the wind
It only slows you down when you start listening
And it's a whole lot harder to shine
Than undermine
Yeah, undermine

'Cause it's all talk talk talk
Talking in the wind
It only slows you down when you start listening
And it's a whole lot harder to shine
Than undermine
Yeah, undermine

Sometimes good intentions
Don't come across so well
