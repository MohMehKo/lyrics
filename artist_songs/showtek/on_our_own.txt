Are we foolish or are we free?
Do we watch our lives go by?
Do you see me, am I empty?
When you look into my eyes
We can paint the sky tonight
While the whole world's stuck inside

We are the lights that meet the setting sun
We are the hearts that beat
We're dancing on our own, tonight
We are the falling one's who've gotten up
We are the lights so bright we're dancing on our own, tonight

Are we helpless, or are we human?
As we make our lives alright
Do you hear me, am I empty?
When you look into my mind

We can paint the sky tonight
While the whole worlds stuck inside

We are the lights that meet the setting sun
We are the hearts that beat
We're dancing on our own, tonight
We are the falling one's who've gotten up
We are the lights so bright we're dancing on our own, tonight

And we're making it tonight
We can make our lives alright, alright, alright, tonight

We are the lights that meet the setting sun
We are the hearts that beat
We're dancing on our own, tonight
We all the falling ones who've gotten up
We are the lights so bright we're dancing on our own, tonight

Dancing on our own
Dancing on our own
Dancing on our own, own, own
Dancing on our own, own
