Between the music and me
Is what the world doesn’t see
There’s a freak in me
That’s who I wanna be
Go fast, go hard
Cause extacy knows
This is hardstyle
And you know how it goes

There’s a freak in me
That’s who I wanna be

Between the music and me
Is what the world doesn’t see
There’s a freak in me
And that’s who I wanna be
Go fast, go hard
Cause extacy knows
This is hardstyle
And you know how it goes
[2x]

This is hardstyle
And you know how it goes

Between the music and me
Is what the world doesn’t see
There’s a freak in me
That’s who I wanna be
Go fast, go hard
Cause extacy knows
This is hardstyle
And you know how it goes
[2x]

And you know how it goes...
