Keep on talking 
Let me hear your voice
Keep on walking
Gotta make choice
So let the music keep on doing what it's doing
I got everything right here so keep it moving
Everybody dance now [x4]
Everybody daaaancce

Music makes me loose my mind 
Every freaking day
Every freaking night
Music makes loose my mind
Every freaking day
Every freaking night

We don't give fuck about it
Only got one life to live
Loving this feeling this
Every freaking day, Every freaking night [x3]

So everybody dance now
everybody dance now [x3]
So let the music keep on doing what it's doing
I got everything right here so keep it moving
Everybody daaaanccee
