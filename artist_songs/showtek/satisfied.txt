What you waiting on
What you waiting on

I said oh how’d it feel tonight
Only you know how to keep me satisfied
Oh how’d it feel tonight
Only you know how to keep me satisfied
So oh how’d it feel tonight
Only you know how to keep me satisfied

So oh I had a feeling tonight
I got a one track, one track mind

What you waiting, waiting on

I be watching you watching watching watching me
I be watching you watching watching watching me
I be watching you watching watching watching me
I be watching you watching watching watching me all night

Just one touch
I want to lose control
Lost the words
Want you to take control
Just one touch
I want to lose control
See I’m giving you a greenlight

I said oh how’d it feel tonight
Only you know how to keep me satisfied
Oh how’d it feel tonight
Only you know how to keep me satisfied
I said oh how’d it feel tonight
Only you know how to keep me satisfied

I said oh I had a feeling tonight
I got a one track, one track mind

What you waiting, waiting on…
What you waiting, waiting on

I said oh how’d it feel tonight
Only you know how to keep me satisfied
So oh I had a feeling tonight
I got a one track, one track mind
