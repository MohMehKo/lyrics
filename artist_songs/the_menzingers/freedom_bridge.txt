Amy was a waitress at The Fire Street Grill
Up route 611 she was slaving for the pill
Oxy's got her pupils pinned up
A junkie centerfold
With grey hairs and a death wish
She was 22 years old

Had it all
Took the fall
Had it all
Took the fall

Specialist Jeg, a much more honest man than you
Came back from the desert where he never found the truth
Now he screeches tires, fills his head with alcohol
While the morbid brown faces hang like portraits on the wall

Had it all
He took the fall
Had it all
They took it all

Something happened on the way to hell,
The new guard they took my sister
Something happened on the way to hell,
The old guard they took my brother away
Something happened on the way to hell,
The same greed it took our parents
Something happened on the way to hell,
The west wall it took us with it

McTiernan was a good ol' boy, he cheated and he skimmed
"A favor for a favor, it can't be called a sin"
Some may see it different, and some don't see at all
When the papers started calling he closed his eyes and took the fall

Had it all
Took the fall
Had it all
Took the fall

Now we're standing on the ledge
And we're looking at the ground
I feel my body breaking on the asphalt, hear the sound
Red and blue lights screaming saying,
"Step up off that ledge"
So we wrap our hearts up in our heads
And take the fall instead

Had it all
Took the fall
Had it all
Took the fall

Something happened on the way to hell,
The new guard they took my sister
Something happened on the way to hell,
The old guard they took my brother away
Something happened on the way to hell,
The same greed it took our parents
Something happened on the way to hell,
The west wall it took us with it

Something happened on the way to hell,
The west wall it took us with it
