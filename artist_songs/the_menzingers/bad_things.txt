Dreaming that my teeth are falling out.
Driving there's no steering wheel,
No doors I can't see out. 
Kicking and screaming on the motorway,
The radio static screams my name.

Water is coming up faster and faster;
Can't move my arms, they've been casted in plaster.
Bleeding on the motorway,
The radio static repeats my name.

Paranoid, I'm paranoid, I'm paranoid;
Where did this gun come from?

Don't wait up for me my friend,
I'm planning to watch the world burn.
Don't wait up for me my friend,
I'm planning to watch the world burn down.
All your friends are dead and gone.

Dreaming that our teeth are torn out.
Driving there's no steering wheel,
No doors I can't get out.
Metal and plastic on the motorway,
The radio static forgot our name.

I'm gonna do it;
I'm gonna do it this time, pull it this time.
