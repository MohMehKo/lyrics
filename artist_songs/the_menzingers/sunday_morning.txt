Well, I'm red eyed, I've got a big surprise
There's something burning an electric sky
That says, "Son don't bother waiting around to die
I've got it covered keep your head up high."

And I'm red eyed, we packed our car up tight
We escaped the gallows hanging no man's land
Someone tell me what the underworld is like
'Cause passing boulders this just don't feel right

Don't worry brother, this will blow over [x8]
Don't worry brother, anything less is fucking surrender

'Cause we could get away from this
We could run as far as Mexico
Be something better than just "I told you so"
We'll throw our pennies in a wishing well 

We could get away from this
(Don't worry brother, this will blow over)
We could run as far as Mexico
(Don't worry brother, this will blow over)
Be something better than just "I told you so"
(Don't worry brother, this will blow over)
We'll throw our pennies in a wishing well 
(Don't worry brother, this will blow over)

Don't worry brother, this will blow over [x2]
