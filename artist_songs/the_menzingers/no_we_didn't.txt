Sell us your open arms, are we ready to change?
Galvanize them with a smile,
Won’t you take away our pain?
HOPE FOR SALE (participation may vary),
I heard your master ring the bell,
You salivate, you salivate, you sell it.

Your mothers died in ’68,
Your fathers were too busy to celebrate their failure,
Saviour my messiah,
Where’s our bread and circus games?
Are your handlers still the same?
The money changers still remain,
You’re the same,
A face and a name,
A face and a name,
Sell it, sell it, sell it.

Sell us your open arms, are we ready to change?
Pale horse painted green, is it hot enough to change?
Fall into your arms, are we ready to change?
Sell us your open arms, we’re not ready to “change”.
