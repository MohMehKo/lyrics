I’m gonna walk to the edge of the world,
I’m gonna collect everything left that’s scattered,
Maybe then I can mend your wounds,
Maybe then I can mend mine too.
Because I’m running out of excuses,
Because I’m running out of time.

I’ll find my own way home,
and stumble into another New Year

I’m gonna get in fighting fit,
I’m gonna let my liver play offense,
But when captains choose their teams,
I’m always the last one on the side lines.
Because I’m running out of excuses,
Because I’m running out of time.

To go anywhere but backwards
'Cause I can’t wait for or live forever,
No I can’t wait for or live forever,
Either.

I’ll find my own way home,
and stumble into another New Year.

I’m gonna get back all that’s lost,
I’m gonna regain rightful intuition,
You said, “Hey man I’m on your side,
but I’m always waiting on your side”.
Because I’m running out of excuses,
Because I’m running out of time.

When life falls apart I’ll eat my words,
With insignias to award our failed ventures.
When life falls apart I’ll eat my words,
With insignias to award our failed ventures.
