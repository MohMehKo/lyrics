Oh yeah, oh yeah, everything is terrible
When buying marijuana makes you feel like a criminal
When your new friends take a joke too literal
Making you feel like the bad guy

Oh where are we gonna go
Oh now that our twenties are over?

Oh yeah, oh yeah, all hope abandoned
I'm not young enough to be your companion
Not old enough to be your guide
What a cliche time to try

Oh where are we gonna go
Oh now that our twenties are over?

Where are we gonna go now that our twenties are over?
Where are we gonna go now that our twenties are over?
Where are we gonna go now that our twenties are over?
Everyone's asking me over and over
The decade taken hostage
By my own guilty conscience
When you gonna quit this nonsense?
Everyone's asking me over and over
But I don't mind telling lies, lies

So oh yeah, oh yeah, let's go to Vegas
Put it all on black and get married by Elvis
If we wake up broke, we'll be fine
We'll get rich in another lifetime

Oh where are we gonna go
Oh now that our twenties are over?

Where are we gonna go now that our twenties are over?
Where are we gonna go now that our twenties are over?
Where are we gonna go now that our twenties are over?
Everyone's asking me over and over
The decade taken hostage
By my own guilty conscience
When you gonna quit this nonsense?
Everyone's asking me over and over
But I don't mind telling lies, lies

Like tension you can cut with a knife
Like a wedding ring that never fit right
Like a car alarm that won't stop howling
A decade lost in the motions
To romance and cheap whiskey
The subtle sound of a fleeting feeling
Like four chords that don't love you no more
In a motel room, a sleeping bag on the floor

Is it wrong to say that things can change? (Telling lies)
Is it wrong to say that things can change? (Telling lies)
Is it wrong to say that things can change? (Telling lies)
Is it wrong to say that things can change? (Telling lies)
Is it wrong to say that things can change? (Telling lies)
Is it wrong to say that things can change? (Telling lies)
Is it wrong to say that things can change? (Telling lies)
Is it wrong to say that things can change? (Telling lies)
