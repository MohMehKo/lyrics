I saw you lying on the ocean
With your battleship next to me
I'm not falling for your confusion
Hateful staring back at me
Its a WMD broken foreign policy
Call out my number 192 and we'll see
Is that how i die, from an rpg?
From a man who could have been my friend
If we had just wait to see
Die for an administration full of shit
Pull the trigger and kill, for a god who doesn't exist
And i'll supply, there's gotta be something else
Don't back down its time to play your role
Its a feat, your gun don't have a soul
yes my father tell that there's something else
Don't back down its time to play your role
Its a feat, your gun don't have a soul
You can't live forever there's gotta be something else
Sins of the father sins of the son
The free world is dying the liars have won
Don't you raise your voice to me.
