I was born on a light-skinned road,
I was born with an engineer’s gold,
I did better than most.

Now I live on a dark-skinned road,
The collectors call they try to take my gold,
I’m happier than most.

The streets are never clean
My friends they help preserve my innocence.
We shared our cigarettes,
At the window we placed our bets,
They wouldn’t call our names,
Tickets hide our shame.

So we laughed through glossy eyes,
Surely the gods would recognize,
Our good intentions, we showed them,
The sweat covered our skin.

We aged a decade in an hour,
We gave away our innocence.

So let these simple songs get caught in our heads,
Brace the frames of our worthless beds.
All my life never gave a fuck,
Someone please wake me up.

So let these simple songs get caught in our heads,
Brace the frames of our worthless beds.
All my life never gave a fuck,
Someone please wake me up.
