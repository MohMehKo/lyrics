I remember you well at the Sun Hotel
Next to Fernando's Corner Store Grocery
Behind the factory spoils where no souls should be found
We kept our voices low from the city
I played you a song about the town that I was from
While Dan played "Casey" while sipping on a Mickey's
We drank to forget that our lives were a wreck
That's when I realized you were the only pretty thing left

I remember you well at the Sun Hotel
Where we were famous, and our hearts were fucking legends
And you told me again,
"Greg I prefer more handsomer men, but for you tonight I will make an exception."
You were clenching your fists
You were biting your upper lip
I watched a thousand tiny goosebumps gain territory of your skin
And for whatever this is worth
I was happy
I was sure of everything

But you got away
Yeah didn't you babe?
But you got away
And I never once heard you say "I need you."

Well I don't need you
God I need you
Well I don't need you
God I need you
Well I don't need you
God I need you

I don't need you
I don't need you
I don't need you

I don't mean to suggest that I loved you the best
No, I don't mean to suggest that I loved you the best
I don't mean to suggest that I loved you the best
That's it
That's it

I don't even think of you that often.
