I used to lie to myself all the time
I was always over-reacting, screaming "I'm gonna die."
But now I'm five thousand miles from her head on my shoulder
From a night I spent sober screaming "I'm gonna die."

But all I ever wanted was to make things right
All I ever wanted was to make things right

Transient love, I was a ghost on your birthday
I was a runaway somewhere in a fabled mistake
Transient love, you should've seen the view from the pension 
It made me think of things we'd never mention
The things we're too afraid to say

Like what if I spend the next few years
Just somewhere in some atmosphere
While you're at home with bills to pay
I hope it doesn't end this way

All I ever wanted was to make things right
All I ever wanted was to make things right
Over and over in my head, I've tried
But all I ever wanted was to make things right
