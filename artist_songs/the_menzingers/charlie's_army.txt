I guess I should tell her I'm sorry
I never showed up to the party
Yeah, I got into a misunderstanding
With her old boyfriend named Charlie

Yeah, I love, I love my Juliet
But her ex-boyfriend wants me dead

But tell your men I ain't afraid to die

When I first met her I fell in love
And she smiled because she knew
We were day drinking in Brooklyn
It was death in the afternoon, yeah

I love, I love my Juliet
But her ex-boyfriend wants me dead

Charlie's army is coming for me
Charlie's army is coming for me
He says, "Boy, you're gonna be sorry"
Charlie's army is coming for me

Tell your men I ain't afraid to die
If loving Julie is a capital crime
Tell your man I ain't afraid to die
If loving Julie is a capital crime

I ain't gonna tell him I'm sorry
'Cause it's me and her after the party
No need for a misunderstanding
'Cause nothing's gonna change my mind, yeah

I love, I love my Juliet
But her ex-boyfriend wants me dead

Charlie's army is coming for me
Charlie's army is coming for me
He says, "Boy, you're gonna be sorry"
Charlie's army is coming for me

Tell your men I ain't afraid to die
If loving Julie is a capital crime
Tell your men I ain't afraid to die
If loving Julie is a capital crime
