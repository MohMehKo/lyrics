He said, "The white boy's visiting, the black man's here to stay"
While my privilege showed like the chalk marks on display
The fear is something new, I'm confused by property too
The romanticized aesthetic, man it isn't as poetic
As apologetic street names and wars waged to lose

"Keep your head down"
"Keep your head down"
"Keep your head down"
He said, "Keep your head down"

"While you're walking through here"
