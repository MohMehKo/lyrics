And I cant wait to be back home on the plane
To see my poor daughter to see my poor baby's face
I've got the flashman in my sight
I wonder if hes got a daughter and if he's got a wife
And christmas eve came as a surprise
I counted my blessings and prayed to God for my life
I lost my best friend to Bastogne today
I wonder who'll tell his family and who'll tell his wife
