When I get home, I'm not talking to anyone
When I get home, I'm unplugging my telephone
When I get home, I'll get high alone

When I get home, I'm not talking to anyone
When I get home, I'm unplugging my telephone
When I get home, I'll get high alone

And I'm going down to Brookfield and Holiday
Oh and I'm going to find where they threw my body
It was lost like all the others from when I was just a kid

When I get home, I'm not talking to anyone
When I get home, I'm unplugging my telephone
When I get home, I'll get high alone

When I get home,
When I get home,
When I get home, 
When I get home, I'll get high alone
