Whoa [x2]

They called a meeting of the doctors and drug dealers in suits
They're planning on pushing their cure for the truth
We're the Disneyland dope-fiends, it's a small world
When they're praying up to your pills
Generation serotonin: balanced and free
Sending praise to "The Molecule'

My doctor says, "Don't worry son, its just a trial run,
You'll feel much better when it's said (Well I'm gone) and done.
And forget the cost the market (I'm gone) is hot
This took your father and I've got your numbers,
Well I've got your numbers, and I've got your numbers."

Who am I to say? I'm probably drunk...
My cure works for me, but I can barely breath
While the market research is showing off her new tits,
Executives' jaws fall to the floor
"Well, we've finally got the new data and the good news is
they don't think for themselves anymore"

My doctor says, "Don't worry son, they'll get ya when they come.
But you can hold on, forever but the devil's (Well I'm gone) won.
And forget the cost the market (I'm gone) is hot
This took your father and I've got your numbers,
Well I've got your numbers, and I've got your numbers."
