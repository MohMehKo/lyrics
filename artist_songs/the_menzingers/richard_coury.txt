The amber flow, sweat like the glass
Crimson faces forget the past
With a swisher sweet and a fireman's hack
We can reminisce but we can never look back
Unhappiness, a lonely road, who thought success could take such a toll?
Unhappiness, a lonely road
Richard Coury put a bullet in his brain
Every day is the same, loneliness all the haze
So we live our lives and we have our fun while he wraps his lips around the gun
Richard Coury was his name
Its 5 o'clock time to check the quotes
Down 22, rethink my do's and don'ts
Secretary won't you hold my calls
Cancel my appointments, I've got something to solve
