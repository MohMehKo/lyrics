Orange asphalt meets with the dusk an acquaintance
Becomes atmosphere
When you're ready to retire you get off the bus
Man you get the hell out of here
Then it's said, degeneration, its my excuse, its my separation
Then it's said, degeneration
Electric city read
And its up reptilian way, minus a jackson
I'm gonna waste away my E.C. night again
But I hold on
Orange pavement meets with my face
An old fashioned grounding atmosphere
Tripped up and tired, broke, they're killing us
But i feel the sun coming again
