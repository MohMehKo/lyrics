Sunken eyes in strangers' faces
I'll fall asleep in the strangest places
What the hell am I doing? Where have my friends gone?
Can't stand these people no more
But you cannot leave when you can't find the door
Smashed my phone, lost my wallet, who's this new friend of mine?

Why do some people make you nervous
And others drive you to drink
When the bars are closing

A nightstand memorial to past libation
A sudden fear of phone vibrations
Too hungover to sleep, too tired to stay alive
Bezos, bile and bills
There's so much missing time to kill
I shake like an airplane on its way down

Why do some people make you nervous
And others drive you to drink
When the bars are closing
When the bars are closing

No good'll come from stumbling home with the sun
No good'll come from stumbling home with the sun
I used to care
Now I stare into the

Sunken eyes in strangers' faces
I'll fall asleep in the strangest places
What the hell am I doing? Where have my friends gone?

Why do some people make you nervous
And others drive you to drink
When the bars are closing
When the bars are closing
