We took rides in your American muscle car
I felt American
We shared our smokes
I held the wheel while you drank and drove
Our plans were miserable
And then we crashed your car
Your American muscle car
Into a ditch on Sawmill Road
There was ice on all the roads
We always dreamt of having nice things
Having nice things
