I've got the shakes, baby
The shakes
So what do you say about me and you 
Buy some booze for breakfast soon?
[x2]

Soon!

'Cause I've made my mistakes
And I've said my laments
And now my girl is moving all her things 
Out of the apartment

And I got high with you one time
And then we talked it over
We said living takes too long
And we ain't ever getting sober

I've got the shakes, baby
The shakes
So what do you say about me and you 
Buy some booze for breakfast soon? 

I've got the shakes, baby
And they won’t go away.
So what do you say about me and you 
Waste away the afternoon?

'Cause if there is a God
There is no more fun to be had
And if there was 
A way that I could get you back!

'Cause all the boys in town
They would all agree
That if you're going down
You're going down with me!

I've got the shakes, baby
And they won’t go away. 
So what do you say about me and you 
Buy some booze for breakfast soon?

We'd waste away in the afternoon!
'Cause who are we kidding? 
 We both ain't got nothing better to do.

Yeah!
