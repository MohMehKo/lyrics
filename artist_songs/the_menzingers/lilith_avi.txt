Won't you meet me in the garden? [x4]

Some call it Eden, shattered goals
You were tempted by the serpent man
While I was busy on a cell phone closing the deal

Call out my name, I've seemed to forget it
I lost my name tag at sinner's seminar
You were tempted by the serpent man
While I was busy on a cell phone closing the deal

Call out my name, I'm wasting away
All for a flicker of time
Broke and busted fool, now I know what it feels like

But the gods are pickin' steel on the radio
Next to the preachers trying to teach us of the fire below
And I'm not going back to extremes
So we'll drag this asphalt river for the body of a story untold

I said, "Hey little girl, won't you marry me?
I'm feeling so alone. I know why."

I said, "Hey little girl, won't you stay away?
I'm not losing my best friend, oh I'm losing my best friend,
Oh I've lost my best friend to your cause."

Now I hear that lonesome song
Now I feel my legs touch the ground 
Now I hear that lonesome song
Now I feel my legs touch the ground
