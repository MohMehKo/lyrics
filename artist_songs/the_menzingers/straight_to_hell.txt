So you can play on the fiddle
How's about a British jig and reel?
Speaking King's English in quotation
As steelhead towns feel the steel mills rust
Water froze in the generation
Clear as winter ice
This is your paradise

There ain't no need for ya
There ain't no need for ya
Go straight to hell, boy
Go straight to hell, boy

You wanna play mind-crazed banjo
On the druggy-drag ragtime U.S.A.?
In Parkland International
Hah! Junkiedom U.S.A.
Where procaine proves the purest rock man groove
and rat poison
The volatile Molatov says:
Lemme tell ya 'bout your blood bamboo kid.
It ain't Coca-Cola, it's rice.

There ain't no need for ya
There ain't no need for ya
Go straight to hell, boy
Go straight to hell, boy

You wanna join in a chorus
Of the Amerasian blues?
When it's Christmas out in Ho Chi Minh City
Kiddie say papa papa papa papa papa-san, take me home
See me got photo photo photograph
Of you and Mamma Mamma-san
Of you and Mamma Mamma-san

There ain't no need for ya
There ain't no need for ya
Go straight to hell, boy
Go straight to hell, boy
