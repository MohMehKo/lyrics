Budding young philosophers sit down at the dinner table,
They all stand up to pay the bill but none of them are able.
The kids, they're staring at their phones.
They're calling it "communication".
They've been to the desert, they're part of the show;
But they don't know what they don't know.

Brilliant young  philosophers are making your decisions,
A brother and sister come to blows over a broken television.
Now I'm staring at my phone, I'm not calling it communication.
I've been to the desert, I'm part of the show,
The things I know, the things I know.

Hearts unknown beat alone,
Whose god will save your soul?

Your soul is long gone.

Hearts unknown beat alone,
Whose god will save your soul?
Hearts unknown beat alone,
They don't know rock and roll.
