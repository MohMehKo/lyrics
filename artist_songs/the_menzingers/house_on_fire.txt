Waiting for your life to start then you die
Was your heart beating in the first place?
Waiting for your life to start then you die
Was your heart beating in the first place?

Lost myself in the kitchen
There's an old friend falling down the stairs
They say there's cops in the alley way
It's too late for saving us
Let it burn down

Waiting for your life to start then you die
Was your heart beating in the first place?
Waiting for your life to start then you die
Was your heart beating in the first place?

Found myself in the basement
There's smoke, there's ash over everything
This girl I know, yeah, she's trying to get high
She's telling me, she's telling me, "Let it burn out"

Yeah, does it make you nervous?
Have you fulfilled your purpose?
Yeah, does it make you nervous
The house is on fire
Yeah, does it make you nervous?
Have you fulfilled your purpose?
Yeah, does it make you nervous
The house is on fire
But there's beer left I think I'll stay

Waiting for your life to start then you die
Was your heart beating in the first place?
Waiting for your life to start then you die
Was your heart beating in the first place?

We set the house on fire
And we ain't going nowhere
We set the house on fire
And we ain't going nowhere
We set the house on fire
And we ain't going nowhere
We set the house on fire
And we ain't going nowhere
