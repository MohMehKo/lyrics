To deep sleep,
I know everything ain’t free,
As I rummage through an old phonebook deciphering names,
That were carved on the Paupack peaks,
Remember me?
Remember May 2003?

When we were hopeless,
We were doomed by our pending defeats,
You drank Jack and I’d drink anything that’s free,
I wonder what your old man thinks of us now,
Slowly setting sons?

I don’t want to wait for, 
I don’t want to wait for, 
I don’t want to wait for, 
I don’t want to wait for, 
I don’t want to wait for, 
I don’t want to wait for things to get better, 
Pull your car over.

Break your friends and save yourself,
Like you told me forever ago.
Break your friends and save yourself,
Like you told me forever ago.
Break your friends and save yourself,
Like you told me forever ago.
Break your friends and save yourself,
Like you told me forever ago.
