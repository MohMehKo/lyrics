I hope this isn't a burden
Thanks for having us over
We could sleep on the couch
We could sleep on the floor
We will leave before you even notice
We were here or even notice us at all

Been having problems with our landlord
He said he's taking us both to court
She got her hours slashed
And my unemployment's drying up fast
We both got worthless diplomas
From worthless universities
Two bachelors in worthless studies
But at least it made our parents happy
And cost a whole lot of money

You said L.A. is only two days
If we drive straight Denver if we get tired
Said you didn't mind stopping just as long as we got out of the Midwest states
The Midwestern states
The Midwestern states
The Midwestern states
The Midwestern states

But I know somewhere in Chicago
Where we can stay for a little
I hope this isn't a burden
Thanks for having us over
Most nights we always fall asleep with
Something dumb on Netflix
Some nights trash reality
Or kids cartoons or shitty documentaries
Not perfect but we're good together
Yeah, me, you, and our bad tattoos
Yeah, all our stick and pokes, all our inside jokes
We'll regret 'em when we're dead and sober
But we're still breathing and the party ain't over

You said L.A. is only two days
If we drive straight Denver if we get tired
Said you didn't mind stopping just as long as we got out of the Midwest states
You said L.A. is only two days
If we drive straight Denver if we get tired
Said you didn't mind stopping just as long as we got out of the Midwest states
The Midwestern states
The Midwestern states
The Midwestern states
The Midwestern states
