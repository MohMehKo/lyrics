I heard a ghost whisper to a teacher,
He said "We're going off to war".
I heard a ghost whisper to a preacher,
He said "We're going to start a war".
A newsman put a paper in my hand, telling me his truth.
Jesus and The Scientist will never reconcile this.

We're pieces on, we're pieces on the board.

When you're lonely, you can fine me.
When you're feeling lost in a bidding war.
When you're lonely, you can come fine me,
When you're feeling lost in a bidding war.

Guns and Lawyers, Gods and Aeroplanes,
Promises, white cloaks, white jackets.

I heard a ghost whisper to a teacher,
He said "We're gonna start a war".
