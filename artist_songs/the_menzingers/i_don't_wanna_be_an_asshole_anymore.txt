Yeah!
Last Friday night I wasn't me
I was a still life trapped in eternity
I was the focal point; out of focus, out of ink

And I’ve been wandering nightly through the garden of your heartache
Always making a mess, always stumbling out the door
But I don’t wanna be an asshole anymore

(Whoa) Baby, maybe I’ll be good to you
I don’t wanna be an asshole anymore
(Whoa) Baby, maybe I’ll be good to you
Baby, maybe I’ll be good to you

Another night, I devour the sun
Plunge myself into the depths of oblivion
Yeah somewhere along the way I found wine
Feels damn good just to bleed sometimes
All I ever wanted was to make things right
Years of idleness and spite
I push my emotions off a bridge, 
I’ve been taking them hostage with a shotgun
Now I'm somewhere treading water, 
Somewhere lost inside the the man that I'm not
But I don’t wanna be an asshole anymore

(Whoa) Baby, maybe I’ll be good to you
I don’t wanna be an asshole anymore
(Whoa) Baby, maybe I’ll be good to you
I’ll be good to you
I’ll be good, I’ll be good, I’ll be good

I won’t lie no more about where I’ve been
And I won’t pry no more over the people that you’re hanging with
You’re the only lover that I ever missed
And have been hopelessly in love with
Look at this tangle of thorns
I don’t wanna be an asshole anymore
Yeah, I don’t wanna be an asshole anymore
Oh no, no, no
