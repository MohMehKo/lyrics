Condescender, Condescender,
Chemical splendour, I surrender a promise to myself.

I know a snake, I know a charmer, I know a selfish little boy,
But I wish that I knew my friend,
A neighbour is a stranger,
And compassion is an option,
When your frigid hearts settle in.

Condescender last forever come call off your dogs,
Chemical splendour, I surrender a promise to myself,
The old enemy.

I know a snake, I know a charmer, I know a selfish little boy,
But I wish that I knew my friend,
A neighbour is a stranger,
And compassion is an option,
When your frigid hearts settle in.

I’m not going home,
I’m not going home,
Where is my home?
Where is my home?
I’m not going home.

Condescender last forever come call off your dogs,
Chemical splendour, I surrender a promise to myself,
The old enemy.

My heroes I have forgotten them,
My heroes maybe they never were,
My heroes I have forgotten them,
My heroes maybe they never were,
I’m not going home.
