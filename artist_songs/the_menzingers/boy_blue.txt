Took our father's name and our mother's heart
We felt our sister's pain then it fell apart
We were told one thing and they showed us another
Is it finally true we're not getting any younger?

The boy blue and the silver spoon
They found him dying in the living room
Say goodbye to the bride and groom
Send 'em off on a honeymoon

Dreadful sound echoed through the trees
Dirty headlights put us all on our knees
Route 502 we were waiting for you
But you couldn't see it was New Year's Eve

The boy blue and the silver spoon
They found him dying in the living room
Say goodbye to the bride and groom
Send 'em off on a honeymoon

I've been told
There's no going home
No room for you and me
No empty seats in eternity
I've been told
No going home
No song left to sing
No second act to mortality

The boy blue and the silver spoon
They found him dying in the living room
Say goodbye to the bride and groom
Send 'em off on a honeymoon

The boy blue and the silver spoon
They found him dying in the living room
Say goodbye to the bride and groom
Send 'em off on a honeymoon
