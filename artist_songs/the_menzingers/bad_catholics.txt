We should have never thought that we could get stoned
And drive around with just a half a pack of smokes
A bottle of clear eyes, an appetite, we were
Pillaging the Turkey Hill on Main Ave in West Side

Wouldn't you guess the only thing we had to fear would be
Flashing their lights in our rear view mirror
This time they got us it's all over now,
You were praying Hail Mary's for an escape route.

But thank God for your father's last name
And all the connections that he's made
To everyone you're such a sweet church girl,
But I know your secret.

Bad Catholics weren't we darling?
Always dipping out before communion started.
Bad Catholics weren't we darling?
Always dipping out before communion started.

Another summer and another church picnic,
I watch a mother run around in a panic
Chasing her kid with his orange soda mustache,
While his fathers by the gambling wheel

There I saw you in the beer tent hanging
With your new husband and your baby on the way
Oh it's kinda strange how it made me miss something,
Long lost in the both of us now.

You thanked God that I found my way
And introduced me to oh what's his name
To everyone you're such a sweet church girl,
But I know your secret, yeah I know your secret.

Bad Catholics weren't we darling?
Always dipping out before communion started.
Bad Catholics weren't we darling?
Always dipping out before communion started.
Bad Catholics weren't we darling?
Always dipping out before communion started.
Bad Catholics weren't we darling?
Always dipping out before communion started.
