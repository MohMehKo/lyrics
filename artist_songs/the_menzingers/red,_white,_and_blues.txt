You called it no man's land
With machine guns blasting to hell
I let my guard down and carried my heart so far away
And in a letter sent, that I don't want to be here any more than them
I'm sipping on coffee gone stale again
Is this how it tastes to mix drinks with sour grapes?

So kiss me before it's over, if only for a minute 
So kiss me before it's over, if only for a minute
We can argue who was first to bleed
Or let your walls do the talking

(We're falling fast right now)

But in the middle of the night
I lay there frozen in a memory 
Of us down by the river
With your hands clenched into mine
Well I still remember 
All the promises you swore 
That we'd never outlive
Please tell me you remember, forever friends

So kiss me before it's over, if only for a minute 
So kiss me before it's over, if only for a minute
We can argue who was first to bleed
Or let your walls do the talking

'Cause in the red light I'm singing all alone
I watched my favorite dream fall from grace to stone
Hiding in the basement, we kept our voices low
You gave me that old troubled look that said, "I don't know"

Hold onto twilight, the sun brings empire
We are the last fight, we are the fire

And just like your mother said 
(Hold onto twilight, the sun brings empire)
You're too pretty and young for this
You'll make it better on the outside 
(We are the last fight, we are the fire)
Just keep your head and keep your fire.
