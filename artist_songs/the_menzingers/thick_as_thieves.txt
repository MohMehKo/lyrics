I held up a liquor store
Demanded top-shelf metaphors
With a sinner's smile and open arms
Drop a line to charm the silent alarm

Neutral angels calling the cops
They'll be choosing sides when the fighting stops
Polizie in the cabaret
While we six kings made our getaway

Thick as thieves on our knees
With an ocean in between
Thick as thieves on our knees
With an ocean in between
With an ocean in between

Laughter in the darkness
Whispers in the shadows
I was there when the wall fell down
I'll be there when the ocean rises

Building castles with cans and bottles
Drinking like they do in novels
I know they'll get me by and by
But tonight you are my alibi

The same old sun that we all come from
Faded stars in the air that we breathe
In the earth, in the sea

Thick as thieves on our knees
With an ocean in between
Thick as thieves on our knees
With an ocean in between
Thick as thieves on our knees
With an ocean in between
Thick as thieves on our knees
With an ocean in between
With an ocean in between
