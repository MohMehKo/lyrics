"1-2-3, 1-2-3."

The glob of cherry tips are dancing in the streets (yeah!)
Left like the road where man and soul meet
Well the clergy's left jobless, the judge been replaced
With varicose laughter and unending face

So long Ohio
It's been short and sweet
We'll see you again where man and soul meet
So long Ohio
It's been short and sweet
We'll see you again where man and soul meet

And say, "Hi" to Virgina it's been months since our meet
And tell James I'll carry his torch for week
Cause I've got a purpose and I've got a place (yeah!)
This four wheels, this hunger, and my saving grace

So long Ohio
It's been short and sweet
We'll see you again where man and soul meet
So long Ohio
It's been short and sweet
We'll see you again where man and soul meet 

(yeah, woohoohoo!)

I know the righteous one
I saw him staring back at me
And I know the righteous one
I found him waiting by the sea
I know the righteous one
I got his working caveat
To follow me, to follow me.

So long Ohio
It's been short and sweet
We'll see you again where man and soul meet 
So long Ohio
It's been short and sweet
We'll see you again where man and soul meet
Where man and soul meet 

(yeah! woo! yeah!)
