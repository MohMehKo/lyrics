Lost in a picture frame
The way our bodies used to behave
The way they smiled in the moment
Before they permanently froze
But that was the old me and you
When we were both lookers

Lost in a picture frame
The way my body used to behave
The way it smiled in the moment
Before it permanently froze
But that was the old me
I was such a looker in the old days

You little Kerouac
Always running like Dean and Sal
Always waiting on a freight train
Always looking for a story to tell
But that was the old you
You were such a looker in the old days

Yeah we were both lookers

Sha la la la Jersey girls
Are always total heartbreakers
Julie from the Wonder Bar
I still wonder where you are
Cause I know the old you
And you know the old me

I was certain that I'd find her
In the back of the diner
In a cloud full of nicotine
In a teenage memory
That I hold till eternity
Cause the future ain't coming for it

Yeah we were both lookers

Sha la la la Jersey girls
Are always total heartbreakers
Julie from the Wonder Bar
I still wonder where you are
Oh, sha la la la Jersey girls
Are always total heartbreakers
Julie from the Wonder Bar
I still wonder where you are
Cause I know the old you
And you know the old me
When we were both lookers

In a 5" by 8" black and white
On the nightstand of my mind
From a time I hardly recognize

Sha la la la Jersey girls
Are always total heartbreakers
Julie from the Wonder Bar
I still wonder where you are
Oh, sha la la la Jersey girls
Are always total heartbreakers
Julie from the Wonder Bar
I still wonder where you are
Cause I know the old you
And you know the old me
When we were both lookers
