Do I say goodbye
Shut the door and close your eyes
Or wait until tomorrow
We let this burn a little longer
Until we grow stronger
Until we fall apart

Say goodbye
And take both of my hands
You've danced your last dance
Why don't you dance it for us?
Take this dance as our last goodbye
You've danced your last dance
Why don't you dance it for us?
Whoa whoa whoa…

It’s been too long
and your never coming back
it’s no good saying sorry
we let this burn a little longer
until we grow stronger
until we fall apart

Say goodbye
and take both of my hands
you’ve danced your last dance
Why don't you dance it for us?
Take this dance as our last goodbye
You've danced your last dance
Why don't you dance it for us?!

I fall!
I’m not for you!
I’m not for you!
I’m not for you!

Say your goodbye 
(Dance for us, dance for us)
Say your goodbye
(Dance for us, dance for us)

Say your goodbye 
(Dance for us, dance for us)
Say your goodbye
(Dance for us, dance for us)

Say goodnight when you close your eyes
Say goodbye when you say goodnight
Say goodnight when you close your eyes
Say goodbye when you say goodnight

Whoa yeah
Whoa yeah
Whoa yeah
Yeah whoa
