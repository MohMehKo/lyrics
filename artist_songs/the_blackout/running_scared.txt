Tired of waiting for me to make this change
Tired of feeling a world away
Didn't know what you were thinking
Didn't know you were running
Didn't know you were running scared

I can't take - waiting
Every day - for so long
I need it today - save me
I need it today - cause I

And I don't ever want it to fade
I don't ever want it to change
I don't ever want it to fade
I don't ever want it to change
I don't ever want it to fade!

Tired of chasing the words I need to say
Tired of faking the days away
Didn't know what you were thinking
Didn't know you were running
Didn't know you were running scared

And I can't take waiting
Every day - for so long
I need it today - save me
I need it today - cause I

And I don't ever want it to fade
I don't ever want it to change
I don't ever want it to fade
I don't ever want it to change
I don't ever want it to fade!

Oh! Gotta get around it
Oh-oh-oh! Just forget about it

I don't ever want it to fade
I don't ever want it to change
I don't ever want it to fade
I don't ever want it to change
I don't ever want it to fade!

Tired of waiting for me to make this change
