We're sick of the same shit
Don't stop, they just keep coming
Weak and over rated
It's ok, cause we won't stop
To make the break and get up on it
You're god damn right about that
They take take taken what what you wanted
You god damn right about that

[Chorus:]
You beg and borrow every line
To paint the feelings they can't write
Get up and turn it on
Turn on the radio
Get up and turn it on
Turn on the stereo
Get up and turn it on
Turn on the radio
Get up and turn it on
Turn on the stereo

Just take and make a big hit
Good looks is all you need
So don't waste a second thinking
Just make it worth their while
Replace and change is what you wanted
You're god damn right about that
Just make get paid and reap the credit
You're god damn right about that

[Chorus:]
You beg and borrow every line
To paint the feelings they can't write
Get up and turn it on
Turn on the radio
Get up and turn it on
Turn on the stereo
Get up and turn it on
Turn on the radio
Get up and turn it on
Turn on the stereo

You beg and borrow every line
To paint the feelings they can't write

Get up and turn it on
Turn on the radio
Get up and turn it on
Turn on the stereo
Get up and turn it on
Turn on the radio
Get up and turn it on
Turn on the stereo
