I don't care what you're thinking 
I don't care what you're saying
When everything is gone, you'll still be begging for more

She looks at him 
Her heart beat starts to melt
She said "I made you up to hurt myself"
You leave the room and I smell you on my clothes
You're dangerous and beautiful
My thorn and my rose

Let's just make this clear.
There's nowhere better then here

I don't care what you're thinking 
I don't care what you're saying
When everything is gone, you'll still be begging for more 
[x2]

I hate the pain that I went and put you through
'Cause I'll never be perfect 'cause I'll never be you
What the air doesn't see, the heart can't breath
But all that pain went away when I saw you leave 

Let's just make this clear
There's nowhere better then here

I don't care what you're thinking 
I don't care what you're saying
When everything is gone, you'll still be begging for more
[x2]

Say what you want, it would always end
This was never gonna be simple
Say what you want, it was all pretend
This was never gonna be simple
[x2]

I don't care what you're thinking 
I don't care what you're saying
When everything is gone, you'll still be begging for more
[x2]

This was never gonna be simple (begging for more) [x4]

This was never gonna be simple [x2]
