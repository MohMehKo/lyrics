No more waiting
No more wasted time
No hesitating
Let’s open up our eyes

Wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up

Don’t just think about it
Give up just trying to think about it
Light this flame that’s in your eyes
You’ve got the chance to do it all

No more chasing
It’s time to save ourselves
Can you taste it
Taste it in the air

Wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up

Don’t just think about it
Give up just trying to think about it
Light this flame that’s in your eyes
You’ve got the chance to do it all

Don’t just think about it
Give up just trying to think about it
Light this flame that’s in your

Wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up
Wake up, c’mon!

Don’t just think about it
Give up just trying to think about it
Light this flame that’s in your eyes
You’ve got the chance to do it all

Don’t just think about it
Give up just trying to think about it
Light this flame that’s in your eyes
