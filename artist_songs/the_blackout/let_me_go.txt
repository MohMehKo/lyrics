You said do you wanna dance
I need to take this chance
And as I walked away
I could feel your eyes behind me 
Leading me astray

Run away run away
Is what I know I should do
Run away run away
But I'm addicted to you
Run away run away
And now I got you tearing up my mind

Ooh you gotta let me go
Ooh you gotta let me go
Cos you get inside every time you smile
Infect me with your eyes
I gotta let it go

She tried to take my hand
It's getting harder to fight
I hope you start to understand
I just can't push it aside
I need to walk away
And it's getting so damn hard for me
To walk the line

Get away get away
Is what I know I should do
Getaway get away
But I'm addicted to you
Get away get away
And now I got you tearing up my mind

Ooh you gotta let me go
Ooh you gotta let me go
You get inside every time you smile
Infect me with your eyes
