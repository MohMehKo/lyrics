I feel the ropes are getting tighter, it's not a bad idea 
These chains will never hold me down, so lets just make this clear 
So step it up and make me fight it, and I'll scare you all the time 
Don't stop, just carry on and I know I'll be just fine 

Love you and leave you's what I'll do 
One day I'm gone without a clue 

You've tired me out, by tying me down, Woah, woah 
You've tired me out, by tying me down, Woah, woah 

You feel my hands are getting tighter, getting ever nearer 
Scream when you've had enough, I couldn't see this clearer 
Your life is slipping through my fingers 
Push you up against the wall 
Do I stop or just carry on? 
Will you ever take it off? 

Love you and leave you's what I'll do 
One day I'm gone without a clue 

You've tired me out, by tying me down, Woah, woah 
You've tired me out, by tying me down, Woah, woah 

I'm so close, scream for me 
I'm so close, scream for me 
I'm so close, scream for me 

You've tired me out, by tying me down, Woah, woah 
You've tired me out, by tying me down, Woah, woah 
You've tired me out, by tying me down 
You've tired me out, by tying me down 
You've tired me out, by tying me down 
You've tired me out, by tying me down 
Tying me down 
Tying me down
