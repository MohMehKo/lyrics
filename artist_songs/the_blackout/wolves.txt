You took it all when you fell in love with your lies
Didn't think that you'd fall so far
You sold it all to take the throne for your fucking pride
You gotta fake it all

We are the saving grace
Taking back what was almost lost
You gotta know
What's waiting to swallow you whole

Hey, Hey
You threw me to the wolves
Hey, Hey
But now I'm leader of the pack
Hey, Hey
And now I'm bringing you down
(We'll take it, We'll take it)
(We'll take it all away)

It said it all when I saw the fear in your eyes
Didn't think that you'd run so far
You're all alone out in the cold waiting to die
You gotta fake it all

We are the saving grace
Taking back what was almost lost
You gotta know
What's waiting to swallow you whole

Hey, Hey
You threw me to the wolves
Hey, Hey
But now I'm leader of the pack
Hey, Hey
And now I'm bringing you down
(We'll take it, We'll take it)
(We'll take it all away)

You know I taste it
Flow in the night
I feel your breath when you whisper your lies
I feel you fading
Starting to slow
I hear your feet start to stumble and fall
I see your face when you try and hide
I smell the fear in the air like a fire
The sweet embrace, yeah, when you decide
To give up running and surrender your life

Hey, Hey
You threw me to the wolves
Hey, Hey
But now I'm leader of the pack
Hey, Hey
And now I'm bringing you down
(We'll take it, We'll take it)
(We'll take it all away)

Hey, Hey
You threw me to the wolves
Hey, Hey
But now I'm leader of the pack
Hey, Hey
And now I'm bringing you down
(We'll take it, We'll take it)
(We'll take it all away)

Hey, Hey
Hey, Hey
Hey, Hey
We'll take it all away
