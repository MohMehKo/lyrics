I now see your disguise
I'm hiding from you
and all your lies
are coming true
the tales have now begun
I'm lying to you
and your serpents tongue
is coming through

Close your eyes and swallow
time is on your side
time is on your side
I will make you feel so hollow
time is on your side
time is on your side
so lay down for me
time is on your side
time is on your side
and feel so hollow
