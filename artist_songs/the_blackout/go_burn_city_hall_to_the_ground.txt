A thousand times I've waited, 
I've burned out.
Flushed with hearts
I turn back after the fall
Yeah we'll watch them burn

Ashes slip through your fingers
While you try to grasp what once was yours
But your cries fall on deaf ears
Play with matches and people burn.

A thousand times I've waited, 
I've burned out.
Flushed with hearts
I turn back after the fall
Yeah we'll watch them burn

Yeah we'll watch them burn [x3]

Why deal me a hand in this? 
It's true I could have stopped it
Was it even my place
To stop the start of the end.

A thousand times I've waited, 
I've burned out.
Flushed with hearts
I turn back after the fall
And we'll watch them burn

Watch them burn!

I know how you feel
Broken and bruised
I know that you are
Cold and used

Yeah we'll watch them burn [x6]
