As you ask me to lose myself,
I said I've never felt so alive
As you ask me to lose control,
I said I've never felt so alive
And I pray, that it stays
And I've never felt so alive

But it's you, only you
And nothings gonna change the way I feel
About you, always you
And nothings gonna change the way I feel

As you ask me to prove myself,
I said I'd never ever tell a lie
As you ask me to bare my soul,
I said I'd never ever tell a lie

It's taking my breath away,
Waiting for you to say
And I'd never ever tell a lie

But it's you, only you
And nothings gonna change the way I feel
About you, always you
And nothings gonna change the way I feel


As you ask me to lose myself,
As you ask me to lose myself

About you, always you
And nothings gonna change the way I feel
About you, always you
And nothings gonna change the way I feel
About you, always you
And nothings gonna change the way I feel
About you, only you
And nothings gonna change the way I feel

As you ask me to lose myself I said I never felt so alive
