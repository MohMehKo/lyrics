I hate what you are
And every word that you say
You're fucking nothing to me
And after all you betray [?]
I can take your life
And everything that you proved [?]
Just you wait and see

We watched the flames
Take over our lives
Melt us away
Turn the darkness into light
We are the heat
That will keep you awake
With open eyes
Before the fire before the fire breaks

You hate what I am
And every thing that I say
Iâ€™m what you wanted to be
So yourself portray [?]
You cant have my life
And everything that you proved [?]
You will never be me

We watched the flames
Take over our lives
Melt us away
Turn the darkness into light
We are the heat
That will keep you awake
With open eyes
Before the fire before the fire breaks

I am the fire, the fucking fire [x2]
Fire
I am the fire, the fucking fire [x2]
I am the fire

[?]
So we will carry on
Sit back and watch us burn

We watched the flames
Take over our lives
Melt us away
Turn the darkness into light
We are the heat
That will keep you awake
With open eyes

I am the fire, the fucking fire [x2]
Fire
I am the fire, the fucking fire [x2]
I am the fire
