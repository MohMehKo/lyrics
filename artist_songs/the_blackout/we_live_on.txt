They can take. They break. They can ruin it all.
You feel like you are on your own.
Every time that they try, they keep losing control.
I won't live like that again.

Don't wish your life away.
Don't let it slip away.
Just turn and face the hate.
Just turn and face the pain.

I'm not gonna have 'em break this heart.
Don't let it tear apart.
I'm not gonna give it all away.

We will never die, we always live on.
We will never die, we always live.
The memories you make will never fade.

They can hate. They can rape. They put up their wall.
And we'll be there to watch it fall.
With every stick, every stone, every one of our bones.
We will fight on and on again.

Keep pushing every day.
Don't miss that chance to make a change.
Just turn around and face the hate.
Just turn and face the pain.

I'm not gonna have 'em break this heart.
Don't let it tear apart.
I'm not gonna give it all away.

We will never die, we always live on.
We will never die, we always live.
The memories you make will never fade.

We will never die, we always live on.
We will never die, we always live.
The memories you make will never fade.
