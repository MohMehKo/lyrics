This feeling’s fading fast
And it’s getting hard to hold
Cos I believe in every word
Of all the rumours I’ve been told
About you and

Never thought it would ever end up like this
That you’d be the one that you’d always miss
That you’d always miss, that you’d always miss

You were looking for the one way out
Waiting for the last goodbye
How could you say
Never knew, never knew
It was coming, no
How could you say
Never knew, never knew
It was coming, no

You’ve always felt this way
Why was I the last to know
Yeah I believed that everyday
We were on the same damn page
And maybe I

Never thought it would ever end up this way
Never thought I would ever just walk away
Just walk away, just walk away

You were looking for the one way out
Waiting for the last goodbye
How could you say
Never knew, never knew
It was coming, no
How could you say
Never knew, never knew
It was coming, no

You were looking for the one way out
Waiting for the last goodbye
How could you say
Never knew, never knew
It was coming, no
How could you say
Never knew, never knew
It was coming, no

Take me with you
Even if it’s only in your head
When you come back to me 
Stay forever in my bed

One way out
Last goodbye
How could you say
One way out
How could you say
Last goodbye

You were looking for the one way out
Waiting for the last goodbye
How could you say
Never knew, never knew
It was coming, no
How could you say
Never knew, never knew
It was coming, no

You were looking for the one way out
Waiting for the last goodbye
How could you say
Never knew, never knew
It was coming, no
How could you say
Never knew, never knew
It was coming, no

How could you say [x9] (Never knew, never knew, it was coming, no)
