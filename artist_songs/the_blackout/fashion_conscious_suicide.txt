Rain down, rain down
let it cut to the bone
Rain down, rain down
just like my words to you
Rain down, rain down
let these wounds never heal
Rain down, rain down
and my heart always bleed

Through the rain and tears
your eyes hide from me
because they now see
truth in disbelief
So I take my knife
from your bleeding heart
turn it on myself
and I slit my throat

To bleed like you bleed
(slowly draining)
To feel the rain
(cut deep)

To bleed like you bleed
(slowly draining)
To feel the rain
(cut deep)

Through the rain and tears
your eyes hide from me
because they now see
truth in disbelief
So I take my knife
from your bleeding heart
turn it on myself
and I slit my throat

With this scar across my chest
I wont forget the day that I
took the knife into my hands
and waved our lives good bye
[2x]

Rain down and wash us away
