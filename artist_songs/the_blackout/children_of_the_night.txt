We are the children of the night,
we are the children
We are the children of the night,
we are the children

As daylight fades, we celebrate
The end is near, your end is here
The night it brings us our fate
Knee deep in mud, we want your blood

This isn't love, this is war
This is the night we said
We would be fighting for
This isn't love, this is war
This is the night we swore
That we would call our own

We are the children of the night
We are the children
We are the children of the night
We are the children

The fire burns into the sky
The sun goes down, your end is here
Lighting eyes in the night
Be one of us, be one of us

This isn't love, this is war
This is the night we said
We would be fighting for
This isn't love this is war
This is the night we swore
That we would call our own

We are the children of the night,
We are the children [x8]

This isn't love, this is war
This is the night we said
We would be fighting for

We are the children of the night
We are the children [x8]
