Oh!

They start to rise up from the ground
They're going to kill everyone in town
Head for the hills we're under attack
I see the bloodlust in their eyes
They want us dead, it's no surprise
Hell came to Earth and I'll send it back

I'll never see you again, never see you again
I don't [?] with your eyes open
This is the day of the dead, come and take my hand
I don't [?] with your eyes open

I'll rip your throat out with my hand
I know the [?] dance
My simple shoes and make your move
I hate the way they look at me
The [?] of catastrophe
Take what you need and cut on through

I'll never see you again, never see you again
I don't [?] with your eyes open
This is the day of the dead, come and take my hand
I don't [?] with your eyes open

The day of the dead
And we watch you moving
We will shoot to kill

Never see you again, never see you again
This is the day of the dead, come and take my hand
I don't [?] with your eyes open

The day of the dead!
The day of the dead!
The day of the dead!
The day of the dead!
The day of the dead!
The day of the dead!
The day of the dead!
The day of the dead!
