"How about you and your friends, versus me and the revolution?"

Take your lies, and walk through the door
Run for, run for your life
And take all that you can
Take your lies, and walk through the door
Run for, run for your life
And take all that you can

I die, you cry, we lie every time
I die, you cry, we lie every time
I die, you cry, we lie every time (We can take it far too far)
I die, you cry, we lie every time (And far too long)

So take your lies, and walk through the door
Run for, run for your life
And take all that you can
Take your lies, and walk through the door
Run for, run for your life
And take all that you can

I die, you cry, we lie every time
I die, you cry, we lie every time
I die, you cry, we lie every time (We can take it far too far)
I die, you cry, we lie every fucking time (And far too long)

I'm not over you just yet
I'm not over you just yet
I'm not over you just yet
I'm not over you just yet
I'm not over you just yet
I'm not over you just yet

Run away, so we can let you go
Run away, so we don't have to know
(Don't run away)
Run away, so we can let you go
Run away, so we don't have to know
(Don't run away)
Run away, so we can let you go
Run away, so we don't have to know
(Don't run away)
Run away, so we can let you go
Run away, so we don't have to know
(Don't run away)
Run away, so we can let you go
Run away, so we don't have to know
(Don't run away)
Run away, so we can let you go
Run away
