Now I’m looking at you
And you’re liking it too
I would never ask for anything more
As I’m walking away
Won’t you ask me to stay
I am sorry if I’m not good enough

What if I was never aiming to lie
What if I don’t have to say goodbye

Keep on moving, keep on moving
Where did it go? Where did it go?
Where did it go? Where did it go?
Keep on moving

Now you’re walking with me
And I’m all I can be
Just don’t ask for any more than this
Just speak only the truth
Even if your voice shakes
I want to know where I stand with you

Sorry that I never thought it would change
But what if we don’t let the past hold sway

Keep on moving, keep on moving
Where did it go? Where did it go?
Where did it go? Where did it go?
Keep on moving

Do you know which way to start
Do you know we’re aiming at the sky

Keep on moving, keep on moving
Where did it go? Where did it go? (The sky yeah)
Where did it go? Where did it go?
Keep on moving

Just keep on moving, keep on moving
Keep on moving
Where did it go? Where did it go?
Where did it go? Where did it go?
Keep on moving

Do you know which way to start
Do you know we’re aiming at the sky

Where did it go? Where did it go?
Where did it go? Where did it go? (The sky yeah)

Do you know which way to start
Do you know we’re aiming at the sky

Where did it go? Where did it go?
Where did it go? Where did it go? (The sky yeah)
