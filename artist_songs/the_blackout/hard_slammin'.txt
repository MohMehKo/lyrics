I can see a war, burning in your eyes
I've whored myself for less than this,
You gotta sh-sh-shake on it.
We will never fall, never stand aside
I've whored myself for less than this,
You gotta sh-sh-shake on it.

We've come to far,
You'll never take our souls alive
I've come for you
We will, WE WILL SURVIVE!
I've come so far,
So take your poison dressed in wine
I've come for you
We will, WE WILL SURVIVE!

I've seen your kind before, feeding off the lies
I've whored myself for less than this,
You gotta sh-sh-shake on it.
You stumble and you fall, you never realize
I've whored myself for less than this,
You gotta sh-sh-shake on it.

We've come to far,
You'll never take our souls alive
I've come for you
We will, WE WILL SURVIVE!
I've come so far,
So take your poison dressed in wine
I've come for you
We will, WE WILL SURVIVE!

Pray for a quick death!
Pray for a quick end!

We've come too far,
WE WILL SURVIVE! WE WILL SURVIVE!

We've come to far,
You'll never take our souls alive
I've come for you
We will, WE WILL SURVIVE!
I've come so far,
So take your poison dressed in wine
I've come for you
We will, WE WILL SURVIVE!

I've come so far, I've come for you
WE WILL, WE WILL SURVIVE!

Bring it back again
Always and forever
Bring it back again
FOREVER!
