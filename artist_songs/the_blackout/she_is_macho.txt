Under the moonlight, it's too dark to see
To spend the night alone with me
Shoulder to shoulder, we're on the prowl
The night grows old
We'll wage this town, to the ground

Stick to the path is what they said, don't take one more step
Or we'll end up dead
Stick to the path is what they said, don't take one more step
Or we'll end up dead

We hunt in a pack, as we roam the streets
And we'll attack in a heartbeat
For my actions, I'm  to blame
The attraction has made me change, I am not the same

Stick to the path is what they said, don't take one more step
Or we'll end up dead
Stick to the path is what they said, don't take one more step
Or we'll end up dead

woo!

I don't know how to tell you but I have to somehow
I used to be a werewolf but I'm alright now
I don't know how to tell you but I have to somehow
I used to be a werewolf but I'm alright now

Stick to the path is what they said, don't take one more step
Or we'll end up dead
Stick to the path is what they said, don't take one more step
Or we'll end up dead

Just like the rest
We'll end up dead
Just like the rest
We'll end up dead
Just like the rest
We'll end up dead
Just like the rest
We'll end up dead
