This is our time, this is our night
This is where we take our stand
Heads held high
We defy everything that you demand
Don’t try to fake your way again
We can see through your disguise
Don’t try to snake away again
We will find out where you hide

If you can’t find a reason to believe
Say hey, say hey
The lies that make up all their promises
Say hey, say hey
They’re tearing at the seams
And all we see are broken dreams
So say, say hey
No not today
No not today

This is our fight, this is our right
This is where we wake ourselves
To the truth and remove the grip
That you once held
Sell up, sell out
To scrape your way ahead
Get up, get out
And pay your way again
Put up, put out
To raise you from the dead
Sell up, sell out
Now we’re seeing fucking red

If you can’t find a reason to believe
Say hey, say hey
The lies that make up all their promises
Say hey, say hey
They’re tearing at the seams
And all we see are broken dreams
So say, say hey
No not today
No not today

We won’t take one more betrayal
They line their hands with blood
And sweat of you and I

If you can’t find a reason to believe
Say hey, say hey
The lies that make up all their promises
Say hey, say hey
They’re tearing at the seams
And all we see are broken dreams
So say, say hey
No not today
No not today
