You drink, you drink alone
So alone, you're waiting for life to begin
Leave now and I'll follow you home 
I wake you up to live how you wanted to live
Black eyes and broken bones
Because i know you'll spill my blood by the end of the day
Dirty kisses and filthy lies
I can't help, you're leaving

Those were the days
He's gone and blown them away 

I love myself and I wanna live 
I love myself, I love myself
I love myself and I wanna live
I love myself, I love myself

You think, you think out loud
Speaking tones you cant speak under control
With what you got you should be proud 
You taken you life and filled it with hurt 
Stop now and save us all 
Because i know you'll be gone by the end of the day 
You paint your brains all over the wall
Because i'm tired of waiting 

Those were his days 
Now he's blown them away 

I love myself and I wanna live
I just wanna be awake for your kiss 
I love myself and I wanna live 
I'll do anything, I'll do anything

Just get up, get up, get up,
Come on get it up 
Get up, get up, get up

ahhhh come on 

Don't give up, give up, give up, 
Give it up, give up, give up, give up

ahhhh 

Just get up, get up, get up 
Come on, just get it up 
Get up, get up, come on

ahhhh

I love myself and I wanna live 
I love myself and I wanna live

I love myself [x4]

Yeah!
