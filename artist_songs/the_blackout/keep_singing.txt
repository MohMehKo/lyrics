Every bone
A body made of earth and stone

Will never know
How they changed my heart and soul

'Cos where we are and where we've been
And all the places in-between
We wear our hearts on our sleeves
Recalling all those memories

Then we sing 'em out

Hey yeah, hey yeah
We're growing old but we keep singing
Hey yeah, hey yeah
We're growing old but we keep singing


Your body's cold
In a place that's all its own

Even though
I see your face warm this home

'Cos where we are and we go
We carry everyone we've known
The way you make, make me glow
And it's worth it's weight in gold

Hey yeah, hey yeah
We're growing old but we keep singing
Hey yeah, hey yeah
We're growing old but we keep singing
