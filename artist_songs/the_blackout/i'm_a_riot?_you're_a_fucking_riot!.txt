LIGHTS OUTS!
I can see the evil in your eyes
Fuck yeah!
I can see the evil in your smile
Fuck you!
All I know is tonight is the night
I gotta play this by the book
So take a stab at my broken heart
Fuck yeah!
You can even have the first damn shot.
Fuck you!
Cos you know I shoot to kill

I gotta get this off my chest.
Round and round and round we go
If its perfect then its just fine by me
You picked the wrong war.
You picked the wrong WAR!

RIOT! RIOT!
I'M A RIOT? YOU'RE A FUCKING RIOT!
I'M A RIOT? YOU'RE A RIOT!

Yeah!
I'm just a good guy in a bad, bad town
I'm just a bad boy with a good reputation.

Oh oh oh oh ohhhh
You gotta reap what you sew
WRONG WAR!
You gotta reap what you sew!
WRONG WAR!
