I hope to hell that you’ve thought about what you’ve done
Cos every war you fought was only for your ego + your pride
I prayed for you to be forgiven by everyone 
And every word you hurled 
Would always turn to violence in your eyes

It seems too far for us to go
And we will hunt you down

What if I told you to read between the lies
And I was never really by your side
What if I told you I’ve felt it for a while
And I was never really, I was never really
In your life.

Forgive me god for everything that I’ve become
But then again we men were penned the same as you
And your design
I’m sorry lord that I don’t believe in you
It’s time to rise outside the lines
That tie us to this ageing lie

It seems too far for us to go
And we will hunt you down

What if I told you to read between the lies
And I was never really by your side
What if I told you I’ve felt it for a while
And I was never really, I was never really
In your life.

You were never real and
I will never follow
You were never real and
I will never follow you

What if I told you to read between the lies
And I was never really by your side
What if I told you I’ve felt it for a while
And I was never really, I was never really
In your life.
