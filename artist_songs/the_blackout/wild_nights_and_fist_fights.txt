I borrowed, I borrowed, I begged for, forgiveness
I borrowed, I begged for, forgiveness
I borrowed, I begged for, forgive...

The taste of blood in my mouth, is telling me to stop, 
and walk away, stop and walk away,
And I don't think this thing will end,
Not until one, of us is dead, one, of us is dead,
Blow for blow, I take it in,
One last step, that extra mile

Pull no punches, half-hearted glances,
Look to kill, coz you won't see this chance again,
Pull no punches, half-hearted glances,
Coz the day we quit, is the day we die

Pull no punches, half-hearted glances,
Look to kill, coz you won't see this chance again,
Pull no punches, half-hearted glances,
Coz the day we quit, is the day we die

The taste of blood, in my mouth, is telling me to stop,
And I don't think, this thing will end,
Not until, one of us is dead

One of us is dead
One of us is dead
One of us is dead
One of us..

The blood still left in my veins,
Drowns the sound around me 
The blood still left in my veins,
Drowns the sound around me
The blood still left in my veins,
Drowns the sound around me 
The blood still left in my veins,
Drowns the sound around.. 

Pushing harder (I was your king..)

Beating faster (and you were my queen..)

Pushing harder (I was your king..)

Beating faster (and you were my queen..)

Pushing harder (I was your king..)

Beating faster (and you were my queen..)
