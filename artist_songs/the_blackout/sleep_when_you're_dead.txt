I can't take the sunlight 
'Cos it's burining my eyes
Walking this road and it goes on for miles
And I don't know where I am 
Or where I'll sleep tonight
I just find that living kind of hard to deny

I won't ever let it go
I won't ever let it go

I can't stop myself from celebrating
I've been told you sleep when you're dead
I can't stop myself from celebrating
Sleep when I'm dead

Oh I just like to think I got passion for life
The trouble is that sometimes 

It's as sharp as a knife
But every now and then it tries to cut me alive
I just lick my wounds
And step back into the night

I won't ever let it go
I won't ever let it go

I can't stop myself from celebrating
I've been told you sleep when you're dead
I can't stop myself from celebrating
Sleep when I'm dead

I can't stop myself from celebrating
I've been told you sleep when you're dead
I can't stop myself from celebrating
Sleep when I'm dead
