Please don't say, it's over today
I never wanted to walk away
I never asked to anyway

Please don't make, don't make this mistake
I'm too afraid to walk away
Do I have what it takes to stay?

We're silent (we're silent)
We're silent when we speak.
We're silent (we're silent)
We're silent when we speak.
We're silent, it's killing me (Time and time again)
We're silent (silent), it's killing me 
Time and time again
Time and time again
Time and time again

So take my hand, I'm falling to pieces
Help me understand, I want to believe
When the end began
I can't be on my own
When it all turned into sand
Don't leave me alone

We're silent (we're silent)
We're silent when we speak
We're silent (we're silent)
We're silent when we speak
We're silent, it's killing me (Time and time again)
We're silent (silent), it's killing me
Time and time again

We're silent (we're silent)
We're silent when we speak
We're silent (we're silent)
We're silent when we speak
We're silent, it's killing me
We're silent (silent), it's killing me
Time and time again

Please don't say (Time and time again)
It's over today (Time and time again)
I never wanted to walk away (Time and time again)
I never asked to anyway (Time and time again)
