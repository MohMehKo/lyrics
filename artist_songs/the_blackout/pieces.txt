Never gonna make it,
You gotta fake it, 
Now you're trying to save it all.
Now you're gonna waste it,
You've gotta face it
Now you're up against the wall 

It's time you faded away from all you're mistakes.
I'm sick and tired of all the games you play.
And as you talk I want away.

You take another piece of me 
Woah! woah! 
Have me falling at your feet 
Woah! woah!
I just wanna start to feel alive, and that begins tonight!
so sing "Woah! woah! woah! Oh-woah!"

Hungry for the fame and you're just the same as
Everyone who's gone before.
You try to play the game and you end up failing 
Now I'm gonna watch you fall.

It's time you faded away from all you're mistakes.
I'm sick and tired of all the games you play.
And as you talk I want away.

You take another piece of me 
Woah! woah! 
Have me falling at your feet 
Woah! woah!
I just wanna start to feel alive, and that begins tonight!
so sing "Woah! woah! woah! Oh-woah!"

You know you wanted the glory!
Nothing can stand in your way.
You don't, you don't even know me!
Now that you want me to stay.
You know you wanted the glory,
Nothing can stand in your way.
You don't, you don't even know me.

You take another piece of me 
Woah! woah! 
Have me falling at your feet 
Woah! woah!
I just wanna start to feel alive, and that begins tonight!
so sing "Woah! woah!

I feel you sinking in your teeth
Woah! woah! 
Taking another piece of me. 
Woah! woah! 
I just wanna start to feel alive, and that begins tonight!
so sing "Woah! woah! woah! Oh-woah!"

You don't, you don't even know me!
Now that you want me to stay.
You know you wanted the glory!
Nothing will stand in your way.
