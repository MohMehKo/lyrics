You live you love you learn
We wait to take our turn

'Cos we feel so alive
As we dance through the night
Won't stop till we see the morning light

Take the party inside
Let our bodies collide
Don't like the way you fucking lie

Call out for the summer
As the sun goes down
But fall for the rain

Forget the taste and take away the misery
Drown every memory away
Breathe in and breathe out
Always, always the fucking same

You live you love you learn
The light it starts to burn

Swallow sorrow alive
In a blink of an eye
Drinking 'til I know you're out of sight

Then the party ignites
And we turn off the lights
Just forgetting everyone who's here tonight

Call out for the summer
As the sun goes down
But fall for the rain

Forget the taste and take away the misery
Drown every memory away
Breathe in and breathe out
Always, always the fucking same
