If only we could flyâ€¦

The Blackout style
Gav worms
Take 'em to the Merthyr Bridge
Can you feel it? 

My g-g-generation
Get the fuck up! 
My g-g-generation
Are you ready? 
Do you know where you are? 

Welcome to the valleys punk, take a look around
It's The Blackout fucking up your town
downloading the shockwave
For all the ladies in the cave to get your groove on
Maybe I'm the one who flew over the cuckoo's nest
But guess who's next? (Who?)
Generation X, generation strange
Sun don't even shine through our window pane

So go ahead and talk shit
Talk shit about me
Go ahead and talk shit
About my g-g-generation

'Cause we don't, don't give a fuck
And we won't ever give a fuck
Until you, you give a fuck about me
And my generation

Hey kid, take my advice
You don't want to step into a big pile of shit
Captain's drunk, your world is Titanic
Floating on the funk, so get your groove on
Maybe I am just a little fucked up
Life's just a little fucked up
Generation X, generation strange
Sun don't even shine through our window pane

So go ahead and talk shit
Talk shit about me
Go ahead and talk shit
About my g-g-generation

'Cause we don't, don't give a fuck
And we won't ever give a fuck
Until you, you give a fuck about me
And my generation
'Cause we don't, don't give a fuck
And we won't ever give a fuck
Until you, you give a fuck about me
And my generation

Who gets the blame? 
You get the blame, and I get the blame
Who gets the blame? 
You get the blame, and I get the blame
Do you think we can fly? 
Do you think we can fly? 
Do you think we can fly? 
Well I do, I do
Fly! 

DJ Bobby Sauce bring it on! 
The Blackout love Limp Bizkit

So go ahead and talk shit
Talk shit about me
Go ahead and talk shit
About my g-g-generation

'Cause we don't, don't give a fuck
And we won't ever give a fuck
Until you, you give a fuck about me
And my generation
'Cause we don't, don't give a fuck
And we won't ever give a fuck
Until you, you give a fuck about me
And my generation
