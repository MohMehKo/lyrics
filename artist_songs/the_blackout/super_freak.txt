She's a very kinky girl
The kind you won't take home to mother
She will never let your spirits down
Once you get her off the street, ow girl

She likes the boys in the band
She says that I'm her all-time favorite
When I make my move to her room
It's the right time
She's never hard to please
Oh, no

That girl is pretty wild now
(The girl's a super freak)
The kind of girl you read about
(In new-wave magazines)
That girl is pretty kinky
(The girl's a super freak)
I really love to taste her
(Every time we meet)
She's all right, she's all right
That girl's all right
With me, yeah

She's a super freak, super freak
She's super-freaky, yow
Super freak, super freak

She's a very special girl
(The kind of girl you want to know)
From her head down to her toenails
(Down to her feet, yeah)
And she'll wait for me at backstage
With her girlfriends
In a limousine
(Going back to Chinatown)

Three's not a crowd to her, she says
Room 714, I'll be waiting
When I get there she's got incense
Wine and candles
It's such a freaky scene

That girl is pretty wild now
(The girl's a super freak)
The kind of girl you read about
(In new-wave magazines)
That girl is pretty kinky
(The girl's a super freak)
I really love to taste her
(Every time we meet)
She's all right, she's all right
That girl's all right
With me, yeah

She's a super freak, super freak
She's super-freaky, yow
Super freak, super freak
She's super-freaky, yow
