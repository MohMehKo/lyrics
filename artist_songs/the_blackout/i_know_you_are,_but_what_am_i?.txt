I wanna taste those lips, why don't you shake those hips? 
I wanna taste those lips, why don't you shake those hips?

Come girl, pull your chair up next to mine
I'm not gonna believe you
And make sure you don't forget that smile
Why don't you come and find me? 
So come tell me, what's your story? 
You better stay away from him
I've got time to kill, so entertain me

You look so fucking good to me
You look good enough to eat
You look so fucking good to me

Your eyes make me feel weak
I close the door
Without you here
I left you begging for more
Your eyes make me feel weak
I close the door
Without you here
I left you begging for more
