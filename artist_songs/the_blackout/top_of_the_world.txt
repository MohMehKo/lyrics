We sat, sat on top of the world
You said, said that you'd be the girl
To stop me, stop me fooling around
I said, you'd keep my feet on the ground

Say you will stay away
Say you will forget [x2]

I'm sorry, sorry for what I've done
So sorry, for what I have become
Was this what was always missing?
Was I, was I not listening?

Say you will stay away
Say you will forget [x2]

Don't ask me to rule with my heart or yours will break

We sat, sat on top of the world
You said, said that you'd be the girl (Say you will)
To stop me, stop me fooling around (Say you will forget)
And I said, you'd keep my feet on the ground

Say you will, say you will (Sat on top of the world)
Say you will forget (Say you will forget)
Say you will, say you will (Sat on top of the world)
Say you will forget (Say you will forget)
Say you will, say you will (Sat on top of the world)
Say you will forget (Say you will forget)
Said that you'd be the girl.
