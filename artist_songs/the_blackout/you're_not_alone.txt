This city seems so cold
The bitter wind has blown
Your heart into a stone
But you just need to say
On and on and on and on and on
Yeah, you just need to say
On and on and on and on and on

You know you’re not alone
(You know you’re not alone)
You know you’re not alone
(You know you’re not alone)
You saved me, saved me
You saved me, saved me

You’re walking on your own
And you don’t really know where
Where you need to go
But you just need to say
On and on and on and on and on
Yeah, you just need to say
On and on and on and on and on

You know you’re not alone
(You know you’re not alone)
You know you’re not alone
(You know you’re not alone)
You saved me, saved me
You saved me, saved me

You know you’re not alone
(You know you’re not alone)
You know you’re not alone
(You know you’re not alone)
You saved me, saved me
You saved me, saved me

On and on and on
You’re all I’ve needed
Know, you know, you know
It’s all we’ve got
You know I’ll be there
Just to stop the bleeding
I know you’ll be there
Waiting for the drop

You know you’re not alone
You know you’re not alone
(You know you’re not alone)
You saved me, saved me
You saved me, saved me

You know you’re not alone
(You know you’re not alone)
You know you’re not alone
(You know you’re not alone)
You saved me, saved me
You saved me, saved me
