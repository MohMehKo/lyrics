I don't know if I can hide
Everything I keep inside
Part of me, waging war
I don't know who's keeping score
But I try

Waiting for the walls to fall
I don't know if I can hold
Back the flood and fight the tide
High enough to black the sky
But I try

Wait to find a way
A way to make a change
My god my god my god I can't take it

Throw it all away
Take it to the grave

This is killing me

Not what I'm supposed to be
Empathy has betrayed me
Taken everything I swore
To never lose or never whore
I try

Wait to find a way
A way to make a change
My god my god my god I can't take it

Throw it all away
Take it to the grave
This is killing me

All the good stories are gone
