Liars, they're fucking everywhere
They are, the reason I don't care
Riot! We gotta take what's ours
I'm done, trying to hide these scars

You left me bleeding on my knees and far from home
(Waiting for somebody to save me, waiting for somebody to call)
Get me to the hospital
Get me to the hospital

Quiet (Just shut your fucking mouth)
Tired, of all the shit you spout
Die young, to fucking save yourself
I'm done, you know I know what's best

You left me bleeding on my knees and far from home
(Waiting for somebody to save me, waiting for somebody to call)
Bleeding on my knees and far from home
(Waiting for somebody to save me, waiting for somebody to call)
Get me to the hospital
Get me to the hospital

I got the feeling that something's wrong
Sick, I'm Sick, I'm Sick
Sick of all this shit!
I've waited for someone for far too long
Sick, I'm Sick, I'm Sick
Sick of all this shit!
It feels like it's almost over
I'm fading away

Bleeding on my knees and far from home
(Waiting for somebody to save me, waiting for somebody to call)
Bleeding on my knees and far from home
(Waiting for somebody to save me, waiting for somebody to call)
Get me to the hopsital
Get me to the hospital
Get me to the hospital
Get me to the hospital

Sick, We're Sick, We're Sick
Sick of all this shit!
We're Sick, We're Sick
Sick of all this shit!
We're Sick, We're Sick
Sick of all this shit!
We're Sick, We're Sick
Sick of all this shit!

(We're sick, We're sick)
(Sick of all this shit!)
(We're sick, We're sick)
(Sick of all this shit!)
(We're sick, We're sick)
(Sick of all this shit!)
(We're sick, We're sick)
(Sick of all this shit!)
(Bleurgh!)
