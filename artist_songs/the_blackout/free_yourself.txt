We are the hated
We are the wasted youth and
We are the traitors
To everything we knew

So free yourself
This is a warning
Free yourself
This is a warning

Get it out get it out
You're just a fucking rat
Get it out get it out
You're just a fucking rat
Get on with your life
Get on with your life

You're the one that changed things
The one that threw it all away
Selling out your best friends
For every sinking ship

So free yourself
This is a warning

Free yourself
This is a warning

Get it out get it out
You're just a fucking rat
Get it out get it out
You're just a fucking rat
Get on with your life
Get on with your life

All you know is what I let you see
It's your fault for turning your back on me
I will stand and watch you fall
It was your choice you made that call

Get it out get it out
You're just a fucking rat
Get it out get it out
You're just a fucking rat
Get on with your life
Get on with your life

So fuck you
So go fuck yourself
