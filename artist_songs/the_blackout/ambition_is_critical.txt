Call me what you want, and say what you will
We are doing this for nothing but the thrills
This is all we know, this is all we need
I don't give a fuck about how you feel

I know you've waited everyday
Let your jealousy fade or you won't see through your hate

Cause where we are and what we've found
Is we don't need to wear your crown
I don't mind if it takes it's time
Every mistake made was mine
And I don't mind
Bring it back yeah, bring it, bring it back yeah
I don't mind
Bring it back yeah

Gonna need more time just to make things right
We will bring you down, we are the dynamite
Who the fuck are you? This is the life I lead
Is it good being you? It's fucking great being me

I know you've waited for the day
Let your jealousy fade or you won't see through your hate

Cause where we are, what we've found
Is we don't need to wear your crown
I don't mind if it takes it's time
Every mistake made was mine
And I don't mind
Bring it back yeah, bring it, bring it back yeah
I don't mind 
Bring it back yeah
I don't mind
Bring it back yeah, bring it, bring it back yeah
I don't mind 
Bring it back yeah

Cause where we are, what we've found
We don't need to wear your crown
I don't mind if it takes it's time
Every mistake made was mine
I don't mind
Bring it back yeah, bring it, bring it back yeah
I don't mind 

Bring it back yeah
I don't mind
Bring it back yeah, bring it, bring it back yeah
I don't mind 
Bring it back yeah
