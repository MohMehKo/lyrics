With stars crossed we take our cues
"Show no remorse" is what you said to me
Dangerously we undo
Falling down to Earth, landing in the sea
All that I know and adore
I told you nothing but the truth
Comes crumbling to the floor
Me lying here is your proof

God, I need out
God, I need out, need out again
Gotta find my way back to you
God, I need out
God, I need out, need out again
Gotta find my way back to you

Home... (We've gotta find our way home)
Home... (We've gotta find our way home)
Home... (We've gotta find our way home)
Home... 

Falling faster from the sky
I sit here, lost on your bed
Unmissable look in your eye
Always torture running through my head
Takes me to where I can't go
Take my hand, and I'll lead you to safety
By now the ground is too grown
All I think about is you and me

God, I need out
God, I need out, need out again
Gotta find my way back to you
God, I need out
God, I need out, need out again
Gotta find my way back to you

Home... (We've gotta find our way home)
Home... (We've gotta find our way home)
Home... (We've gotta find our way home)
Home... 

We're flying far from home
So close your eyes and hope
We're flying far from home
So close your eyes and hope

Close your eyes and take into the night
Why don't you forget about my history? 
Close your eyes and take into the night
Why won't you just forgive me? 
Close your eyes and take into the night
Why won't you show me your conscience? 
Close your eyes and take into the night
Walking home, feeling hopeless

We're nothing but satellites in the sky
We're nothing but satellites in the sky
We're nothing but satellites in the sky
We're nothing but satellites in the sky
We're nothing but satellites in the sky
We're nothing but satellites in the sky
We're nothing but satellites in the sky
We're nothing but satellites in the sky
