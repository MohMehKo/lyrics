We'll be dead and buried by February
I won't even know your name
Not about caring or where we're heading
I'll take you home and take the blame

That’s it, you said
I just, mislead
Her dress deep red
Get her to bed

We're taking it tonight
You got me burning like fire
No faking it, we'll come alive
We'll take it higher and higher

We can never be together
You know boys are all the same
So don't start swearing cos your heart's tearing
You know that love is just a game

That’s it, you said
I just, mislead
Her dress deep red
Get her to bed

We're taking it tonight
You got me burning like fire
No faking it, we'll come alive
We'll take it higher and higher

Kinda hung-over, just woke up from blacking out
Next to my shoulder, she snoring, all passed out
Sliding out the covers, trying to find a way to sneak out
Freak out, ever since we started fucking
My private part has become public
But fuck it, I’m addicted to the chicks
I don’t think my player days ever gone be over
With every Friday I’m in love with a new bitch
I think I need to find the cure
Where’s Robert Smith?

We're taking it tonight
You got me burning like fire
Oh no faking it, we'll come alive
We'll take it higher and higher

Higher and higher
(Higher and higher)
Higher and higher
(Higher and higher)
Higher and higher
(Higher and higher)
Higher and higher
