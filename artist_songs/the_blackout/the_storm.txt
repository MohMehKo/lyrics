I always go back to this room
I’ll always love the way you move
As you say that we need
To give it up this time
I turn to the sky
And I see it open wide

Wash it all away
Watch it all fade away in the night

I’d never take the sun away
I’d never bring the dark again
I’d never take the sun away
Woah-oah
Wanna wash it all

I don’t believe in wasting time
Searching for truth we’ll never find
As you say that we need
To give it up this time
(I love the way you burst and bloom)
I turn to the sky
And I see it open wide

Wash it all away
Watch it all fade away in the night

I’d never take the sun away
I’d never bring the dark again
I’d never take the sun away
Woah-oah
Wanna wash it all
I wanna wash it all

Don’t tear us apart
Don’t tear us apart
Don’t tear us apart
I’ll tear you apart

Don’t tear us apart
Don’t tear us apart
Don’t tear us apart
I’ll tear you apart

Don’t tear us apart
Don’t tear us apart
Don’t tear us apart
I’ll tear you apart

Don’t tear us apart
Don’t tear us apart
Don’t tear us apart
We’ll tear

Wash it all away
Watch it all fade away
In the night

I’d never take the sun away
I’d never bring the dark again
I’d never take the sun away
Woah-oah
Wanna wash it all

I’d never take the sun away
Woah-oah
Wanna wash it all
I’d never take the sun away
Woah-oah
Wanna wash it all
I’d never take the sun away
