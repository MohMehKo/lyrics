We can see through you
But we don't have x-ray eyes
We can see the truth
And set our sights upon the prize
Say what you will
We are never gonna crack
There's a time to kill
And we all know that this is it

So bow your head and close your eyes
We are about to take your lives

We are the dynamite
Demolition is our religion, so light the fuse
We are the dynamite
Demolition is our religion, so light the fuse

Don't try to run
Detonation's underway
Your ends begun
Your black skies have turned to grey
The sky will fall
Down on everything you know
You can't ask more
You face tomorrow without hope

So bow your head and close your eyes
We are about to take your lives

We are the dynamite
Demolition is our religion, so light the fuse
We are the dynamite
Demolition is our religion, so light the fuse

We are, we are the dynamite
We are, we are the dynamite
We are, we are the dynamite
We are, we are the dynamite

We are the dynamite
Demolition is our religion, so light the fuse

We are the dynamite
Demolition is our religion, so light the fuse
We are the dynamite
Demolition is our religion, so light the fuse

So light the fuse
Demolition is our religion, so light the fuse
Light the fuse
Demolition is our religion, so light the fuse
