Let’s go, let’s go!
Come on baby let’s take this from the top
I know, I know!
We can make it just don’t tell me to stop
You're my hero!
You never used to say just give it up
I won’t let go!
One more time and you know we got enough

I’m falling down whoa oh

This isn’t the first time, you won’t be the last
Tonight I’m coming for you, girl
This isn’t the first time, you won’t be the last
The city's almost got you burned

Let’s go, let’s go!
You know I love the way you love to front
I know, I know!
What you got I know is what I want
You're my hero!
So say the word and we will start again
I won’t let go!
It’s nothing to lose but all to gain

I’m falling down whoa oh

This isn’t the first time, you won’t be the last
Tonight I’m coming for you, girl
This isn’t the first time, you won’t be the last
This city has almost got you burned

(Some drums, son)

This town will never let you leave
This town will be your final grave

This is an annihilation!
This is our celebration!
This is an annihilation!
This is our celebration!

This isn’t the first time, you won’t be the last
Tonight I’m coming for you, girl
This isn’t the first time, you won’t be the last
This city has almost got you burned

This isn’t the first time, you won’t be the last
Tonight I’m coming for you, girl
This isn’t the first time, girl
Time, time
