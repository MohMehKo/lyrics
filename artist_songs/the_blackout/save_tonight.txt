Go on and close the curtains
All we need is candlelight
You and me and the bottle of wine
Gonna hold you tonight

Yeah we know I'm going away
How I wish, I wish it weren't so
So take this wine and drink with me
Let's delay our misery

Save tonight and fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow - tomorrow I'll be gone
Save tonight and fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow - tomorrow I'll be gone

There's a log on the fire
And it burns like me for you
Tomorrow comes with one desire
To take me away

It ain't easy to say goodbye
Darling please, don't start to cry
'cause girl you know I've got to go
Lord I wish it wasn't so

Save tonight and fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow - tomorrow I'll be gone
Save tonight and fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow - tomorrow I'll be gone

Tomorrow comes to take me away
I wish that I, that I could stay
Cuz girl you know I've got to go
Lord I wish weren't so

Save tonight and fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow - tomorrow I'll be gone
Save tonight and fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow - tomorrow I'll be gone
Save tonight and fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow - tomorrow I'll be gone
Save tonight and fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow - tomorrow I'll be gone

Save tonight
