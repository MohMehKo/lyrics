Well I've got no doubt about it, 
Cause I see your eyes are hiding,
That you know,
Don't let this carry on too long,
Never let, never let you go.

Yeah it came out of nowhere,
And you said that you just don't care, 
You've let it go.

I hope the days and nights spent by your side 
Hope you realized, realized just what you've done

YOU SAID, 
YOU SAID,
YOU SAID YOU WANTED ME!

When everything is said and done,
We won't be here tomorrow.
You made your bed,
Sleep tight my love,
I hate that you brought sorrow.

Give me something to believe in, 
Because this bullshit's left me seeking for something more,
We spent our time, we spread those lies,
And the truth is hidden behind your eyes.

And I need someone to sink my teeth in,
Someone to know what I am feeling,
For far too long.

It ain't what you know,
It's what you want,
It's what you SHOW!

YOU SAID,
YOU SAID, 
YOU SAID YOU WANTED ME

When everything is said and done,
We won't be here tomorrow.
You made your bed,
Sleep tight my love,
I hate that you brought sorrow. 

YOU SAID YOU WANTED ME
YOU SAID YOU WANTED ME
YOU SAID YOU WANTED ME DEAD!

YOU SAID YOU WANTED ME
YOU SAID YOU WANTED ME
YOU SAID YOU WANTED ME DEAD!

When everything is said and done,
WE WON'T BE HERE!

When everything is said and done,
We won't be here tomorrow.

You made your bed,
Sleep tight my love, 
I hate that you brought sorrow

When everything is said and done, 
We won't be here tomorrow 

You made your bed,
Sleep tight my love, 
You brought me pain and sorrow.

YOU SAID YOU WANTED ME
YOU SAID YOU WANTED ME
YOU SAID YOU WANTED ME DEAD!

YOU SAID YOU WANTED ME
YOU SAID YOU WANTED ME
YOU SAID YOU WANTED ME DEAD!
