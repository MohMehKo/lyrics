What keeps you waiting
What sort of signs do you need
You’re craving every glance
They seem to throw your way
No love in this room
That is your only sentiment
Why don’t you take a chance
I’ll show you how to scream

I’ll scare you, I’ll wear you out
Here comes, here comes
Everything that you want
I swear you, you’ve played this town
Here comes, here comes
Everything that you want

The way you fuck to feel
It’s so degrading
You make your way through the crowd
Hoping for something real
It’s just a see-through show
So find your victims

You’ve got the devil inside
You’ve got the devil

I’ll scare you, I’ll wear you out
Here comes, here comes
Everything that you want
I swear you, you’ve played this town
Here comes, here comes
Everything that you want

I’ll scare you, I’ll wear you out
Here comes, here comes
Everything that you want
I swear you, you’ve played this town
Here comes, here comes
Everything that you want

Here comes everything that you want
Here comes everything that you want
