Yo, I used to checkout lyrics and pump the format
Build with skill with technique. Computer A-DAT
My lyrical form is clouds on your brainstorm
I get hype. Think thought flow. 
Acrobat, sink the track, pump the track
Transmissions,close like spores react past these visions
And hurrying more reflects on the dancefloor
Blowing up and having mad people showing up
Packing crowds jam-packed venues
Needles collapse, while atmosphere continue
Sprinkle that,
Winning like that, moving like that, hitting like that
The melody is fat
Yo, I'm on the energy source
The cosmic boss
With Prodigy
Given astrology
My intellect's devour

With Diesel Power
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically
Blows your mind drastically, fanta..

We spun back rewind-Diesel Power
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically
It has to be, automatically
Check it out. You better work it out
Dreams to another bout
My techniques, strategies, abilities.
Will leave cordless mics hanging like spring leads
Do a track so fast. Beyond from you and I
Lyrical tactics, vocal gymnastics
Ease and pepped up
You get swept up
Smacked up, backed up, your crew's all cracked up
Check it slow
Pick choose quick
You can't stick
My medical range is strange as angles
You get tangled. Twist inside a fraction
Channels repeat, complete. Can't complete
Check the hour and texture
Mind adventure
Exploit the point
Into tracks to devour
My intellects proceed

My diesel power
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically
Blows your mind drastically, fanta...

Back attack the wack
Pack the fax to me
You don't want none
High-quality action b/still standing
Damaging your other manner
Quick reverse
Potent as the first verse
My amplifier blows on your worlds, higher
Words sire
Cuts like a barbed wire
Record-play
I pull up on your energy day
Fast-forward
I move And I swings towards it
Exit-load
Put your brain in right mode
Selective mix
The man will perfect the fix heads lightly. 
Bite me
Copy Xerox. Cop sand blocks
You can't knock them out there
I'll keep lifting, shifting, persistent
Intelligent kingpin
Given astrology
As I roll with Prodigy

With Diesel Power
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically
Blows your mind drastically, fanta...
