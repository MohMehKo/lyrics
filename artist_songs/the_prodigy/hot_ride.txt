You hear me [x3]
Up, up and away in my beautiful my beautiful 
Up, up and away in my beautiful my beautiful balloon [x2]
Now get out!

Gimme [x20]
Give me a ride!

Hot ride in my air balloon 
Skippin fast right around the moon 
On a bullet train out of town
Walking talkie, one hand down!

Skipping fast right around the moon
Minds made up, theres no luck when time leaves you
