Murder Bassline
I wanna fly like an eagle
I wanna sing like Sinatra
I've got a date with destruction
I wanna love like a mother

Listen up, let the lesson begin
Cause you're wrong and you know how to sin 
As we dance on the razor's edge
As we dance on the razor's edge

Dance on the razor's edge! 
Dance on the razor's edge! 
Murder!
Dance on the razor's edge! 
Murder!
Dance on the razor's edge! 

All dressed up and ready to go..

I wanna fly
I wanna fly
I wanna fly like an eagle
I wanna sing like Sinatra
I've got a date with destruction
I wanna love like a mother
I've got a date with destruction

I wanna fly like an eagle
I wanna sing like Sinatra
I've got a date with destruction
I wanna love like a mother

Listen up, let the lesson begin
Cause you're wrong and you know how to sin 
As we dance on the razor's edge
As we dance on the razor's edge

Dance on the razor's edge! 
Dance on the razor's edge! 
Murder!
Dance on the razor's edge! 
Murder!
Dance on the razor's edge!
