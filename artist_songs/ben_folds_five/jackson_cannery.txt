Stop the bus
I wanna be lonely
When seconds pass slowly
And years go flying by
You gotta stop the bus
I'll get off here
Enough's enough
I'm leaving this factory

All she wants
Is food on the table
I won't be able
To bring it home
All she wants, come on,
All I need is free
I'm a factory

[chorus]

Did Mother Nature tell you
Boy you come and go as you please
That's what she said to me
Big brother got the keys
And I got Jackson Cannery

Millionaires and mill rats live side by side here,
Messed up my brother's mind
He's far from earth
What's he worth
The same as you or me
In this factory

[chorus]

It's 4 in the morning
Mother don't know
That I'm going far away
She's whispering to the moon
I hope he don't join you soon

Baby boss
Climbs up on his soapbox
But Great Caesar's ghost
Knows what's best for me
He says stop the bus

[chorus]
