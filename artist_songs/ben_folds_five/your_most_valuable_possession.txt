Good morning, Mr. Ben, it's about 6:30
Winston-Salem, North Carolina
Just laying here in the bed, half awake, half asleep
Thinking about you, uh

I was, uh, wondering if you were looking after your
Most valuable possession, your mind
I was thinking about John Glenn
His space journey and all

They said that when you're in space
You lose muscle mass and the body mass
And I wondered if there was any end to it
Or whether if you didn't exercise in space

How long it would be for you were just
A head or a mind and have no body or arms
You would have them
But you couldn't use them

I was wondering if, uh
If your body mass would drop to a certain level
And then it would stop right there
And keep whatever you needed to use your mind

'Cause it would still be working
Thirty seconds remaining
Anyway, I was just pondering that
What do you think about that?

I hope everything is going alright
I'm going to wake up here in a little while
And forget what I was thinking about
