Christmas Twin Falls, Idaho's her oldest memory
She was only two
It was the first time she felt blue

Cafeteria, Harrison Elementary
Beneath a parachute
I saw her without shoes

7UP I touched her thumb and she knew it was me
Although she couldn't see
Unless of course she peeked

My mom's good she got me out of Twin Falls, Idaho
Before I got too old
You know how that goes

That's where she still was the summer she turned 17
1983
Three weeks after me

Last I heard was she had twins or maybe it was three
Although I've never seen
That don't bother me
