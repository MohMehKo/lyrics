I'm standing before my old high school
It's been 10 years since I touched the door
But to heal the old pain we must face it again
So I'll walk down that hallway once more

I have come to this 10 year reunion
For my heart is still pris'ner of war
An' if I find it's alright, we're escaping tonight
That's what I came back here for

Won't you please waltz with me?
I feel like I'm just like I used to be
My heart is locked up here so quietly
Believing that you hold the key

Won't you please waltz me free?
The turns of our steps are untangling me
Free from some dragged around memory
And the rusty old remnants of fear
And after 10 years
I'm melting the shackles with tears

I'm as nervous as if it's still high school
You're happily married I know
But it's not just this dance that I'm asking you for
I'm asking you ten years ago

Remember I wrote in your yearbook?
"Could you please waste some time on me?"
There's just a few things I must tell you
But that's as brave as I could be

So won't you please waltz with me?
I feel like I'm just like I used to be
My heart is locked up here so quietly
Believing that you hold the key

Won't you please waltz me free?
The turns of our steps are untangling me
Free from some dragged around memory
And the rusty old remnants of fear
And after 10 years
I'm melting the shackles with tears
