I had it all, or should I say I saw it all?
And it's a long way from the dustbin of New Jersey to the top
Who would have known?
Who would have known

I had a dream, but dreams had other plans for me
For 30 years I set the thermostat
Where Frank Sinatra liked it,
And old his girl hands on his hats
I never knew which one were mine
Now he's gone, and I'm alone

And I don't know where I might be going
I heard the wind, the wind stopped blowing
Set me on the roadside from the house
But how, for me was always someone else you know
That shadows always fall, when the sun goes down

I shook the hands, a few dames and presidents
And though they always smile politely
With a measure of decorum
Still their eyes would stare beyond me
For a glimpse of something more
But now he's gone,
Now they're gone

And I don't know where I might be going
I heard the wind, the wind stopped blowing
Set me on the roadside from the house
But how, for me was always someone else you know
That shadows always fall, when the sun goes down

Alone, is shadow of a star, don't you know
That shadows always fall, yeah shadows always fall,
When the sun goes down
And I don't know where I might be going

I heard the wind, the wind stopped blowing
Set me on the roadside from the house
But how, for me was always someone else to go
