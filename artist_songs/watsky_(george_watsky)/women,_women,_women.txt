To answer your question

Looking out my window 
Talking to my cat like he's kinfolk 
I sip a Coke and I drink slow 
I'm in limbo 
No plan B 
No girlfriend, I just need to meet a nympho 
But I won't cause I'm more sensitive than my lymph nodes 
and I give too much info 
You can't upzip 
After saying dumb shit like, 
Like I hear your name every time the wind blows 
I gave a chilly chick my jacket and my skin froze 
and then she jacked it and just ran off with my thin clothes 
I guess that shit makes her a heartbreaker in my windbreaker 
I'm not tripping off the bimbos, I just think about the puns that I can spit later 
she couldn't salt me, she was just a hip shaker 
And to answer the question that you implied in your eyes 
No, I don't think that I'm smarter than a fifth grader 

Ladies, ladies, ladies
Women, women, women
Honeys, honeys, honeys
Girlies, girlies, girls
Ladies, ladies, ladies
It's so bunnies
Women, women, women
And my honeys, honeys

Whatever

Reality valedictorian 
Graduated to the next level and I hopped in my DeLorean 
Aurora borealis in my rearview, man it's glorious 
waking up at noon, I'm notorious 
I'm gonna roll the dice, I'm very lucky, but fuck it 
Papa needs a new pair of huggies 
in this life of hard knocks 
feeling like the Hulk, I throw my enemies against the wall across the room like they were my alarm clock 
After dark, car parked right on our block 
arm wrapped around the card stock chick propped up in the passenger seat for a sweet one-way heart to heart talk 
I think I'm ahead of my age like I'm Dippin' Dots 
These women that I've dated really seem to think I'm odd-- Strange 
They just nod 
which is hard without a head on their shoulders like Ichabod 
Crane

Ladies, ladies, ladies
Women, women, women
Honeys, honeys, honeys
Fillies, fillies, fillies
Ladies, ladies, ladies
Sexy so-in-sos
Women, women, women
Excess chromosomes

Huh?
What's a fourth word for girls?
