Never have I ever seen Passion of Christ 
Never have I ever crashed on a bike 
Or been trapped on an island and had to survive 
And yeah I've been trashed a Saturday night 
But never have I ever smoked crack from a pipe 
I've never started one slow clap in my life 
I never ever sat first class on a flight 
Or drank cognac from a bird bath 
Never tried to fly 

And yeah, I'm known to cop a dub sack 
But never have I ever rolled my own blunt wrap 
Never have I banged to Purple Rain or Doveshack 
Never have I ever loved and been loved back 
Fun fact
Cause I've had a broken heart 
But I've never ever ever ever put a woman over art 
And I'm never gonna start 
Never cheated on a chick 
But ask me if I've lied, then I'll likely plead the fifth 

Never have I seen a ghost or a spirit 
But if one appears then I'll know when I'm near it 
And if I ever paid a prophet I'd be quick to repent 
But I've never known Jesus in the Biblical sense (Ahhhh)
But I've I think we'd be friends 
If he went to my school and was cool and we kicked it in chem 
I've never kissed a dude (Ew)
Well that's partly true 
Are we counting Spin the Bottle at a cast party too? 
Oh my god, so gay 

Pause 
(Tick, tick, tick, tick)
Press Play 

I've never raved 
I never been tased 
Never maced or been maced 
Or been punched in the face 

Never have I ever contemplated suicide 
or been crucified 
Never have I ever mooned another driver from the side of my hooptie ride (whoop-whoop)
Never have I ever swallowed all my foolish pride 
And I can't really tell 
If I'm a good person or I'm faking really well 
Cause every now and then I'd catch her on the phone 
But I never really went to visit Grandma at the home 

And I've always known 
That I won't be happy 
Until I'm the best version of myself when I'm alone 
So fuck thinking of marriage 
Until I learn to put another person first and be a parent 
I pinky swear it

I don't know much I
I won't know much I
I won't know much until I
Till I know myself
I know I don't know much, I
No, I don't know much, I
No, I won't know much
Till I
Till I know myself
I know I don't know much, I
No, I don't know much, I
No, I won't know much
Till I
Till I know myself
