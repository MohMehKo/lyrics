Fu-Fu-Fu-Fu-Fuck an MC Name
I don't need a god damn MC Name
I got nothing to hide, you got something to say
(George Watsky doesn't need a fucking MC Name)

If I go spit a poem
If I go kick a flow
Doesn't really matter man cause the jam is a Watsky
When I get a mic and I go rip a rhythm ain't a name in the whole damn gonna stop me
Probably gonna rip it too
Cause the city wants a hippy with a bit to prove
I got shit to do
I got the sickest crew
And so what the fuck is it to you, dude
If I got no stage name
I got stage game out the ass
And a master plan
It's an avalanche
When I spit a little bit of slam
And I hit you with the battleram
Got a cattle brand "GW bar none" so what do you park man?
Got money and cars? I study the stars
And I couldn't care less who you rep in your set show respect
I'll be rapping I bet
Lean to the left flow right Oh my god!
A rose by any name got thorns as sharp
Yo, stage names are for porno stars
And Watskeet skeet skeet skeet is far
From what I'm trying to do, who I'm trying to be
Mother fu-fu-fu-fuck this industry
If I gotta be MC You to do MC Me

Fu-Fu-Fu-Fu-Fuck the limit I got a keep it coming if I wanna make it to the top
So I be giving you what I been doing during the minutes that other rappers have been napping on the clock
Cause if I walk the walk and I talk the talk and I'm popping off cause my flow is hot
Then I'm pretty motherfucking positive I never gotta be somebody I'm not

What's in a name man, flow comes first
I'm never gonna curse - that I got it worst when I roam the earth
It's a ridiculous coincidence that shows my worth
You know my parents went and chose my emcee name at birth
I don't need a mask
To cover my ass
So why would you ask?
Go put me on blast
I'll take you to task
This name is my last
[gasp] So put it on my tombstone when I pass
(Here lies a fine emcee, the kind who grasps the fact
That these aren't circus acts to make you clap, it's rap to make you think and act)

I think you understand by now the thought involved
That if I wanted to be called another name I would have scrawled it on the bathroom wall
I'm not apologizing for a policy that makes a college kid go call himself
Thugdog and not expect assault
I'm marching on and calling all dissenters who
Would like to be included in this emcee designation coup
I'm set to get a crew
We're gonna get a clue and then we'll put it up for you to view
Coo coo ca choo
I am the "insert you"
Come on everybody do it too
