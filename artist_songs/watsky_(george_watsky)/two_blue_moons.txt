[Chorus]
The moon is out tonight (it's bright)
Is everything alright? (not quite)
I wouldn't act like I know (no) know (no) know (no) know (no) know
Just what you're going through (no shit)
But if you're feeling blue (don't quit)
I want to tell you my brother I feel same way too

[Verse 1]
A couple red sons popping out a new womb
Twins come twice once in a blue moon
Feeling a like a joke in the nude rude humor
We were born premature, and they said "too soon"
Sing a new tune, act less fickle
Most twins cling like a pair of testicles
We haven't been tight since we breast fed little
Said, me on the right, and you on the left nipple
Said it's that simple. have to discover if you act a bit smothered
When you're trapped with big brother
9 long months kicking it inside our mother
Never kicked her belly, hell we only kicked each other
If we suffer I'll be sentimental when we grow
Get born, ready go, got a separate embryo
Breaking like a levy though, wading through the heavy flow
When you see light let me know, bro

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
There were weeks you can bet i couldn't eat
Lookin at the cooking with a set of wooden teeth
Opened up my big mouth, found that I could speak
So put another foot in it but now I couldn't leave
It's good to see all the losers taking days
To think of dumping shit on you in new creative ways
You can say that it's a phase
Or some rude complaining crap
It's a stupid way to act, man
But two can play at that
I been a brat, had more than one slip
My lips got unzipped, I quipped some dumb shit
Our folks were so sick, it made them cringe
I followed my jaw's lead, and came unhinged
I'm sorry, can the shit end here?
We haven't really talked in about ten years
And that's ten too many cause if you were anyone else
I wouldn't see you in myself

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Aching in the chest, try to take it from the stress
Shrink made me quit, I was making him depressed
Usually I'm upbeat, tearing through the halls
But instead of bouncing off em I was staring at the walls
Care to make the call which separates faster
A fence of placenta, an inch made of plaster
A handful of strands of our DNA
Either we both were alone or it seemed that way
Kept to myself, I'd reflect by myself
Dude, I left and I fucking saw shrek by myself
It's no help to assume we're less than
To mom it's yes ma'am, I groom you'll best man
It's on the next fam to plan and proceed
But if we smoke weed, don't think we OD'd
No I don't know, all the shit you've been through
But I've seen a window, and I know I've been too

[Chorus]
