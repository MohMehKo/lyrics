O hai. 
I'm that guy.
Built so fly in a silk bowtie
don't know why
I'm built so fly
but I am, no lie.
Oh my.

Rolled by on a low ride Huffy
sitting on the pegs shelltoes puffy
cuff rolled up to my calf
class out the ass
bad with the swag like Buffy.

Gotta be the one to bite the bullet
I'm a sinner but I bet I coulda been a better man.
I wanna be Zen but I go sipping on some medicine
instead of meditating but I get it when I can.
I don't wanna wind up in the gutter with a bottle of malt
liquor, bitter cause I never got a call
tellin' me
that it's all figured out
I'm sick of doubt but I'm looking at the wall.

Part of me is hoping to be caught up in the moment
and be open to the good and the God in me
but I got a lobotomy and I get that I oughtta
become a bit of an oddity when somebody gets offended by the thought of me.

Who's he? You gotta be kidding me.
Do me like Gabourey Sidibe.
If you see me with a chickadee
no diggity, it'll be:
giggity giggity giggity.

Gonna send it like a letter from above
with a woman that I love 'cause I get it like I live
but if my baby's gay I'll say
you go gay baby
work that crib
work that bib
burp that kid
[burp]
screw police
flip that car
I don't want a Jesus piece
but I want a Reese's piece and a Kit Kat bar.

I want everybody focusing on getting me to Letterman
to kick it for the betterment of innocent Americans
who never want to settle for their pop...
Or not 'cause my bedroom rocks
and the beat still knocks when I sort my socks
I'm five foot eleven of sex
from the tip of my head to my gorgeous... knees.

Who Is that boy,
How does he rap so good,
I don't
know
how
that
pale boy raps so good.
How does he do that
do
that
meow
meow
meow meow meow meow meow.
