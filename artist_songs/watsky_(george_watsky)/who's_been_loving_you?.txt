I know my momma loves me 
I know my father loves me 
I know the camera loves me 
I can tell my brother loves me 
I know that Boston loves me
And San Francisco loves me 
I love the city back, 
I just can't help it, 
It's so lovely

I'm in my lucky underwear, I'm feeling debonair
If it's a lonely trip to heaven, I'm already there 
I'm in the bedroom and I'm like stepping like I'm Fred Astaire
I make it happen, battle rapping at my teddy bear 
When I was twelve I'd leave my door open a crack 
Afraid of getting busted sneaking porno on my Mac 
I guess I was a freak until I got caught last week 
(Who's been loving you?) 
I was reading Booker T, I threw the book at me
I go for the lookers but they never look at me 
I would get a hooker if I could unhook her bra 
I'd be looking soft as soon as she took her top... off 
Let's go rolling in a broken Winnebago 
Stop and smoke a bowl out of a hollowed-out potato 
It's hash now, but it's hash browns soon 
(Who's been loving you?)

I know that Jesus loves me 
I know that Buddha loves me
The fucking Easter Bunny 
And the ghost of Gandhi love me 
I know that Santa loves me 
I think my Aunties love me 
I know my Grandma loved me 
She thought I was handsome trust me

This insanity, that's heredity
It's my family, we can let it be 
wish I pretended that my mom and dad are dead to me 
But i love my dad, that motherfucker read to me
My first words were "Where's the love?" 
Mad smug, assed up on a bearskin rug 
Oh fashodo, my mom'll show you the photo 
(Who's been loving you?) 
I do embarrassing better I could wear a pink sweater 
With a pair of slick pleather pants 
Derelict e-ve-ry day and it's well known that I hop off stage with my cell phone
Fake a dropped call when everybody's near me 
And shout "I love you Mom!" so everybody hears me 
I needed to and true it's nothing new but 
(Who's been loving you?)

Even though I owe them money 
I think it's pretty likely 
That my whole family loves me 
My lovers tend to like me 
I know my homies love me 
My teachers loved to hate me 
The haters love to fuck with me 
The fickle love me lately

I'm a percussionist, I never knew guitar.
It's cheesy, but I'm stunting like a superstar 
It's easy man I'm hopping out a moving car 
Call me Wheezy cause I'm coughing at the hookah bar 
And I don't do cigars, but I got hella game 
I'll make a lady out of styling gel and cellophane 
So you can yell my name, I make the bed frame move 
(Who's been loving you?) 
Me and my better friends are heading to the town strip 
If they don't let us in we'll never take a round trip 
Because I took an hour picking out my outfit 
And then I took another slicking down a cowlick 
And I like house sitting, but fuck it now's different 
I'm going out and there ain't a bouncer for cow tipping 
So I'm a tear this joint up 
And I'm a party till the hoofs point up 
(Who's been loving you?)

This is for Charles Barkley 
This is for Poison Ivy 
And it's for Draco Malfoy 
And it's for Bill O'Reilly 
This is for Ned Mencia 
It's for the corporate lawyers 
It's for the backseat drivers 
And for my friend Ann Coulter
