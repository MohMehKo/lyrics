I'd like to call this
Full disclosure hip-hop

You want to know 
Then I'll try 
to tell you how it is 
There 
Isn't ever much 
cracking the coconut hoping to get me to open wide 
now

If you want to know, now 
then all you have to do is ask me 
I don't have a thing to hide 
I walk in the office of my orthodontist and without a warning 
my jawbone is already pried 
And honestly, I've never lied 
second to none 
If I pucker my lips and I lick 'em I'm looking to kick an impeccable pun 
I don't kick it like Bekham 
I kick it like Bekham a decade ago when I run my mouth 
you think I'm a megalo-maniac 
A lout? 
I'll be begging to differ 
try sticking a flute-- or a piccolo 
up a particular part of your pecker 
But I'll let you pick it though 
I'm out 
I'll chuck up a deuce-- a bigalow 
and be cracking a Michelob 
and I give a toast 
and I trickle a bit in the gutter for all of my bigger bros 
And I walk it out 
now 

If you want to know 
then all you have to do is ask me 
Not a thing to hide 
I'm trying to be totally open like all the time 
Now 
If you want to know 
Now 
Then all you have to do is ask me 
Not a thing to hide 
Now 
Not one damn thing 
now 
Not one damn thing 
And I'm glad I got all of these ears around 
me 
Not one damn thing 
And I'm glad I got all of these ears around
