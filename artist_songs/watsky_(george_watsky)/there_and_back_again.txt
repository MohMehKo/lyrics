Sometimes I think I'm too honest 
But to be honest I'm sick, I'm bubonic 
But less black than the plague which is vague 
Cause the Black Plague as a name's kinda ironic 
in that most black folks don't actually kill entire populations of European people, or move chronic 
Who said they move chronic? 
Were you away cuz 
Cause if you ever smoked bud you know trees make you cough like the plague does

I hold my smoke in, toke up, lightweight Yankee you'd faint from a baby buzz 
Fuck you random English guy, take a long nap
This my song. Begone, move along chap 
Bugger 
Yeah, that's right, walk away bitch 
Remember what my name is (WATSKY) 
Good, now that square dude is gone we can party 
Let's get some Mardis Gras beads, weed and bacardi 
The weed's gone, that British nobleman smoked our shit 
and no one noticed it
Who cares bro, I party sober, I'm over it 
I'm with my dogs yo, my dobermans at In N Out 
feeling dope and shit 
It's a local thing I get the cheese fries, then go home for a boca burger and a mocha drink 
I go to Yogurtland 
I'm blowing smoke rings and speeding in the fast lane yodelling 

Road soda tucked in the lap of the kid riding shotgun when the cops roll past motioning 
For us to pull over but I don't, I roll through a toll booth 
And then do donuts in the shoulder, knowing I'm the Sofa King 
I won't brag 
But believe me, I know swag 
I'm feeling so sav 
My friends in the backseat follow our police chase live on the plasma screen Headrest TVs that I don't have 
They warn me about the spike strips I swerve, and I fly through the burbs, but then I hit the curb 
And my tire pops 
I flee on foot but get tired stop 
And invite the the firefighters and the night cops out to iHop 
this is the life, homie, why knock it 
I get high fives when I pop the top off my beer bottle with my eye socket 
And I'll be fine 
I'm bleeding but the best beer goggles is to be blind 

Is this seat taken? 
Is that you British fool? 
I can't see shit, but know there's a seat vacant 
It's me 
Well sit down dude, there's mad room 
We just got food, but there's bound to be round two
