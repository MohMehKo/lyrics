[Kid:]
Yeah, I've been doing that
I've been doing that ever since I was in kindergarten
I've been doing that for a long long long long, long long long long long long time
[Watsky:]
[laughs]
Oh, when did it actually get really bad though?
[Kid:]
I was turning the age I am right now
[Watsky:]
Which is how old?
[Kid:]
Eight
[Watsky:]
Eight is a good year, eight is maybe the finest year
[Kid:]
The only thing is that
The only problem with that is that you're getting closer to being ten
That's the real problem
[Watsky:]
You don't wanna turn ten?
[Kid:]
I mean, I mean, that's the only problem with it
I mean you're like, you're being closer to ten every time you change in age
And when you're close to ten
[Watsky:]
It's all over
[Kid:]
Yeah, you might not like the things you used to like, right?
[Watsky:]
I actually had probably the exact same fear when I was about to turn ten
But I'm gonna let you know right now you shouldn't worry
Because being ten is-is super rad
But the thing that would always make me feel better
Is my mom and dad would sit me down and do funny voices
And they would tell me a story and it would all go away
