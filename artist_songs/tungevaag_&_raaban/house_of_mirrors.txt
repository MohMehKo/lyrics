You got that cotton candy look in your eyes
So throw the ball, let it go and aim for the price
Yooou act like a child
But in the house of mirrors that's alright...

[Instrumental]

You got that cotton candy look in your eyes
So throw the ball, let it go and aim for the price
Yooou act like a child
But in the house of mirrors that's alright
You got that cotton candy look in your eyes
So throw the ball, let it go and aim for the price
Yooou act like a child
But in the house of mirrors that's alright

You're on a rollercoster, feel like you are further?
Dizzy like, it's alright, just let it spin (just let it spin)
Yooou don't know what's coming
In the house of mirrors we can do anything
In the house of mirrors we can do anything

[Instrumental]

(You got that, you got that, you got that)
You got that cotton candy look in your eyes
So throw the ball, let it go and aim for the price
Yooou act like a child
But in the house of mirrors we can do anything

[Instrumental]
