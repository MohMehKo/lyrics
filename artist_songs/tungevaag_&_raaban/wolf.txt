Step by step I walk this lonely road
High on love, divinity, wine and gold
But my conscious starts to crumble
In the city of the jungle
And the holy cry of mumbles
Now is the time

To howl like the wolf that you are
So howl like the wolf that you are
The wolf that you are, you are, you are
You are, you are, you are
So howl like the wolf that you are
The wolf that you (The wolf that you)

Breath by breath I run for thousand miles
Pumping blood, adrenaline deep inside
Cause when your conscious starts to crumble
In the city of the jungle
And the holy cry of mumbles
Now is the time

To howl like the wolf that you are
So howl like the wolf that you are
Oh you better howl
You better howl
So howl like the wolf that you are
The wolf that you (The wolf that you)
