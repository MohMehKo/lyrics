I'll be you coco, and you gogo when you ganja
I'll be your lifeline, when you drown, and then you go down
I'll be your fire, when your darkness is a dungeon
I'll be the trigger that sparks the explosion
I'll be a marthian, and banging on the drum drum drum
I am the ruler of sunrise and motion
I'll open the front gates but don't be afraid
Baby I got you cause I'm the parade

I'm, I'm, I'm the parade
I'm, I'm, I'm the parade
I'm, I'm, I'm the parade
Baby I got you cause I'm a parade

[Instrumental]

This is the kingdom of the wild ones and the loco
We take you higher when you feeling lolo
You don't have to worry, cause this is our jungle
We be the giants that make the ground rumble
You can be ruler of water and fire
You can be cesar to rule the empire
You can be anything, don't be afraid
Baby I got you cause I'm the parade

I'm, I'm, I'm the parade
I'm, I'm, I'm the parade
I'm, I'm, I'm the parade
Baby I got you cause I'm a parade

[Instrumental]

Baby I got you cause I'm a parade

[Instrumental]

I'm the parade

[Instrumental]
