Life of a suburban kid
Existentialism
I ain’t never care much for esoteric shit
He said “I ain’t got no real thoughts”
I could use some adderall in my green tea
Some ice up in my soymilk
I keep an angel on my shoulder devil in my head
He said...

Violate the bounds of platitude [2x]
Who do I do it for?
Who do I do it for?
I hope I do it for you

Try to fight the numbness
Still don't have an answer
Figure when i die it will make sense
Maybe God will answer
Until then

I'm drowning in this world of platitude
Feel like I'm drowning in this world of platitude
What do I do it for?
What do I do it for?
Maybe I do it for you
Baby I do it for you

Little red man leaving my head
Lay around in my dreams
Come alive in my nightmares
Ignore my rambles
Hoping that you hear me
Hoping that I'm heard
If your not careful
I'll take scissors to my mind
Scissors to my mind
Snip snip

Tell me what you want from me yeah
For you
Tell me what you want from me yeah
Baby I do it for you
Tell me what you want from me yeah
For you
Tell me what you want from me yeah
