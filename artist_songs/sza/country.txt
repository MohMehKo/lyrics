This here is the epic tale of a broken mind
This here, this here is the epic tale of a broken mind
This here, this here is the epic tale, this here is the epic tale

And I'll be by your side
And I'll be by your side

I hear my thoughts, I hear them creep into my mind, into my dreams
Voices in my head say to me, "Untie my hands, untie my feet"
So I might fly, so I might fly

This here is the epic tale of a broken mind
This, this here's the epic tale
This here is the epic tale of a broken mind
This, this here's the epic tale
This here is the epic tale of a broken mind
This, this here's the epic tale

And I'll be by your side
And I'll be by your side

Like clouds under my feet I try not to think
Not to feel like I'm stuck in this space I'm just me
I'm just so much more, so much more, so much
I'm so much more, I feel I'm so much more
(Feel like I'm so much more)

One day if I live I'll tell the tale how I lost my mind
One day, one day if I live
One day if I live I'll tell the tale how I lost my mind
One day, one day if I live

And I'll be by your side
And I'll be by your side

Ill be, I'll be, I'll be right here by your side
Won't go no where, I'll stay right here by your side
I'll be, I'll be, I'll be right here by your side
Won't go no where, I'll stay right here by your

Lost my mind, can't seem to find it but I'll be here
But I'll be here though
