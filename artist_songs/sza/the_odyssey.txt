Ise' got to make this quick
I don't want to waste time and make it
Faster. Stronger. Deeper
Pulled out with the passion rolled out
Roll out on the red carpet
Roll out the chariot
Frier
Dancing. By the fire
Singing
I'm leaving. Tonight
I'm leaving tonight I'm
Leaving tonight tonight
Yeah
Haven't we been here before
Haven't you heard the name of the stories
It isn't over yet
Keep patience one the left side of your brain
Virtues are relative
No Pain
Alright
