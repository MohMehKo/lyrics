I'd rather die than, be your slave
Slit my wrist wide and take this stage
Wipe blood out my eyes and
You just lay, there
You think I'm crazy... I am

[Hook:]
I love you like I love crack-crack (I do)
I love you like I like to get high (I do)
I love you like I love crack-crack (I do)
I love you like I like to get high

I'm just a unicorn
Come catch me
Strip me in chains until I bleed
You know I like it
Thats why should I stay here
Why should I fight it?
I won't, I won't

[Hook]

Chosen from a small town
Lookin for some action
Thought I could [?]
But I can't
I just crave the pain boy
I just love the thrill

[Hook]

I'd do for you
Anything
I'd do anything
