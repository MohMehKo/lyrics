Into the roads
Its open
Bare to your left my heart sits here
This is my dream and its hopeless
This is the bed I lie in yeah

I only move for the gut punch
Seeing your pain brings me such joy
Love will only take you
Into the bed you lie in yeah

Cuz I'm me
I'm me revenge is my thing
Watch em bleed, yeah I like it
Yeah I like it
Yeah I like it
Yeah, yeah

Ooh I fell off the truck
Out of luck
So perturbed
Ooh get me off the ground
To be found
Call my name on the loud speaker uhh

Claim me
Loud enough for me
To hear
Ooo, ooo, ooo

Into the roads
Its open
Bare to your left my heart sits here
This is my dream and its hopeless
This is the bed I lie in yeah

I only move for the gut punch
Seeing your pain brings me such joy
Love will only take you
Into the bed you lie in yeah

Mm yeah

This is from the heart this is what we live for
Now back to the cheese the cheese
This is from the heart this is what we live for
Now back to the cheese the cheese
At ease
At ease
At ease

Into the roads
Its open
Bare to your left my heart sits here
This is my dream and its hopeless
This is the bed I lie in yeah

I only move for the gut punch
Seeing your pain brings me such joy
Love will only take you
Into the bed you lie in yeah
