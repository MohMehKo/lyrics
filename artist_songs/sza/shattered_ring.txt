It's up for discussion, up for reprise
Slowly re-thinking if current disguise deceives me
The Shattered Ring
I can see it in your eyes

[Hook:]
Ready or not, loaded heart with a dagger
Aim for your sweet spot
I know you'd rather be scared of
I know you'd rather just disappear
Now that I'm here
I know you'd rather

Giddy up Goldilocks, you took to long to save me
Bumping that Jadakiss is dangerous for sanity
Open my candy box, for you sir, sugar daddy
Look at how drunk we are, spent the night, dancing
(spent the night, dancing)

[Hook]
