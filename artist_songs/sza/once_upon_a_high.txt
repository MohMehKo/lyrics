High up on, high
High up on, high

High up on, high up on, high up on you
High up on, high up on, high up on us
High up on, high up on, high up on
High up on, high up on, high up on you
High up on, high up on, high up on us
High up on, high up on, high up on we
High up on, high up on, high up on, kush for me

I'm high moon, high moon
High up on, high up on, high up on us
High up on, high up on, high up on
High up on, high up on, high up on you
I'm high up on, high up on high up on

Didn't I tell you
Didn't I say that
Didn't I tell you
A high like this won't last?
Didn't I tell you
Didn't I say that
Didn't I tell you
A high like this won't last

So I'm the fool, you could make it
Don't wanna be alone with him naked
Be a shame we're just gonna waste it
Oh

High up on high
High up on climax
High up on you
High up on you should spend the night
Ima do my thang
High up on high up on we
High up on high up on high up on

Didn't I tell you?
Didn't I say that?
