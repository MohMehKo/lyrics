I'm tired of time travel
I rather stay here with my thoughts
Wish they'd stay
Misunderstood
I'm miseducated
Umm
You should just save me

[Hook:]
I just wanna live
How it should be
Over
What it is
Over
Can I get a heartbreak
Over
Unstick my thoughts
Unstick my heart
Unstick these words
Go from the start

[Chorus:]
Take me to reality
And drag me to the truth
Take me to reality
Drag me to the truth

Come clean, soul
Yearning for things, are numb
Do me good then jus so
Look with the light, I see
Top of my sight I'm scared
Can't sleep at night

[Hook]

[Chorus]
