Wish I was prettier a little for ya
Maybe I’ll understand when I get older
I just don’t get it yet
I’m not finished yet

Feel like maturity is overrated
None of my panties match my momma hates it
I’m not into that
She just don't get it yet

Whooo could I be?
Passions clearer for me, me, me, me
So
Tell me if it's easier for ya
Tell me if it's easier for YOU
Tell me if it's easier for ya
Tell me it gets easier for me

Shattered a thousand times before you found me
Kickin the pieces I bet I’ll never amount to
Anything, I just don’t get it yet
Not meant to get it yet

Boxes and paradigms I move around it
Spaces inside your mind I’m safe and sound where
I can breath, I feel, I can breath
Don’t leave me yet!

Whoooo could I be
Visions clearer for me, me, me, me

Tell me if it's easier for you... [3x]
Tell me it gets easier for me

Sandcastles and all that shit that I like
