Wouldn't you like to believe
I'm on the edge
I feel your power on my back
You're murderous, you're murderous
Swept and I fall, euphoria
Breeze in my eyes
Wake me when it's over
Wake me when it's over

So painless, I feel the fall
Power trip, I need it all
I need it all

When you're around, I feel it
When I'm alone, I feel the waves
Crashing, down down
Here in your arms, surround me
I feel your wings
