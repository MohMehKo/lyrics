The rhythm of the rain
Breaks the silence
Beats against my window
As the moment slips away
And I just can't explain
In your absence there is nothing
I try in vain - but I can't kiss the rain

And a miracle can stay
In my mind forever more
It can take my blues away
But it can't stop the rain
And it won't stop me crying
As the rhythm starts again
Inside my head

The rhythm of your name
Undecided uninvited
Speaks to me just like you're here again
And I just can't remain
Undecided unprovided
So in vain I tried to kiss the rain

And an orchestra can play
Any song I've ever heard
But they'll never know my name
And they can't stop the rain
And they won't stop me crying
Oh the rhythm of the rain
Breaking in two

Unstained heart untamed dreams
Unchained love forever

The rhythm of the rain
Breaking the silence  beating against my window
As the moment slips away
I just can't explain
In your absence  there is nothing
I try in vain  but I can't kiss the rain
