Late last night I was sitting all alone
You were there on the end of my phone
I was thinking 'bout you
You were talking 'bout us

In my mind I just wanted you there
Run my fingers through your hair
I was thinking 'bout you
You were talking 'bout us

I closed my eyes cos I was out of control
From fingers to the tip of my toes
I was thinking 'bout you
You were talking 'bout us

Late last night you know I needed you there
I was sitting kinda back in my chair
You were talking to me  I was thinking 'bout us

All I wanted was to see you undress

I could picture you more or less
I was thinking 'bout you
You were talking 'bout us

I closed my eyes cos I was out of control
From fingers to the tip of my toes
I was thinking 'bout you
You were talking 'bout us oh, la, la, la, la
Oh oh la, la, la, la

Last night it was getting kinda late
I got the message and you knew I couldn't wait
I was thinking 'bout you  you were talking 'bout us

I closed my eyes cos I was out of control
From fingers to the tip of my toes
I was thinking 'bout you
You were talking 'bout us
That? s you and me babe

I was thinking 'bout you  you were talking 'bout us
I was thinking 'bout you  you were talking 'bout us
