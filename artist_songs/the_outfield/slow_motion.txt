If I said these words
A thousand times
Would you believe me?
If I gave you my promise forever
Would you deceive me?
I don't care if the whole world outside
Is one locomotion

When I see you tonight
We're gonna make love in slow motion

If I told you
I was a clown
Would you believe me
If I gave you my shoulder to cry on
Would you deceive me
It can happen just once in a lifetime
Accept every notion

When I see you tonight
We're gonna make love in slow motion

I would count every star in the sky
To prove my devotion

When I see you tonight
We're gonna make love in slow motion

If I was accused
Without a crime
Would you believe me?
If I was innocent
Time after time
Would you deceive me?
This can happen just once in a lifetime
Accept every notion

When I see you tonight
We're gonna make love in slow motion

I would climb every mountain
I'd sail every ocean

When I see you tonight
We're gonna make love in slow motion

When I see you tonight
We're gonna make love in slow motion
