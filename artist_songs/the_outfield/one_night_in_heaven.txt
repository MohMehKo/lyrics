I know you look real nice little girl 
I better not catch a surprise little girl hey -yea 
I'm taking a chance on your love 
I know what's on your mind little girl 
You better got nothing to hide little girl hey - yea 
I'm taking a chance on your love 

[Chorus]
An' if it's over and done 
I know I spent one night in heaven 

Stimulate my mind little girl 
Talk ain't gonna be cheap tonight hey - yea 
I'm taking a chance on you love 
You've always done me right little girl 
A pack a' lies between the sheets tonight 
I'm taking a chance on your love 

[Chorus]

Somebody's daughter - dangerous game 
I'm just a late night caller 

She just cost me more than all 
The money in my pocket but 
I don't regret a single coin I paid 
It hit me with her final touch 
I've never beat the moon so much 
An' everything I did she did again 

[Chorus]
[Chorus]
