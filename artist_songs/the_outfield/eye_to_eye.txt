[Chorus]
I wanna get close 
Wanna spend my time with you 
We gotta sit down and talk 
Got to see things eye to eye 

I tried to tell her but I couldn't begin 
It's not a thing that takes a moment 
I'm coming over better let me come in 

[Chorus] 

You'll understand me 
A lot better when the picture's all clear 
I'm yours and anyway you want me 
Move over 'cos it's lonely over here 

[Chorus]

You've got no choice 
You've got no say when it comes round 
I'm gonna jump down don't walk away 
We've got to see things eye to eye 

There was something when I met you 
There was something in the words we didn't say 
It was something that we both knew 
It was something that don't happen every day 

[Chorus]
You've got no choice 
You've got no say when it comes round 
I'm gonna jump down don't walk away 
We've got to see things eye to eye
