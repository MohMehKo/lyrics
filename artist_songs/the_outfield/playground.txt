I'm alone and I'm lost in this playground 
The lights are down on me 
All alone and afraid in this playground 
The city never sleeps 
If you listen you won't understand 
So confused I don't know where I am 
I can't hold on - I can't hold onto love 
I've tried time and time again 

Every street is a dream in this darkness 
The lights stay down on me 
It's so hot I can't breathe in this darkness 
Inside I'm never free 
Just need someone to take me away 
Take me with you is all I can say 
I can't hol on - I can't hold onto love 
I've tried time and time again 

If you listen you won't understand 
So confused I don't know where I am 
I can't hold on - I can't hold onto love 
I've tried time and time again 
I can't hold on - I can't hold onto love 
I've tried time and time again 
I've tried time and time again 
Oh I've tried time and time again 
And I've tried time and time again
