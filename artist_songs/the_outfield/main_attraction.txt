I bet you'd like this seat tonight
It's not a show you'll see on sundays
If you should blink just once or twice
You might need this piece of advice
You'll never get another chance
Don't take your eyes away for nothing
The main attractions's gonna start
This ain't no place to be weak hearted
The main attraction's on tonight
So don't forget to turn the lights down

I thought I'd seen it all before
Something tells me don't be so sure
Anticipation on my mind
I can't imagine what she'll do this time
It seems more special thaneffect

And this show isn't even over yet
The main attraction's still to come
She's just a teaser when she's starting
The main attraction's on tonight
So don't forget turn out the light

I'd like to see if you're for real
So can't we make some kind of deal yeah
You say there's no such word as can't
Making you the girl that I'd want
Let's get this intro out of the way
It can wait until another day
The main attraction's coming up
And you ain't leaving 'till it's over
The main attraction's on tonight
So don't forget to turn the lights out
The main attraction's on tonight
So don't forget turn out the light
