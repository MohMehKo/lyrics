I could tell just be sitting downstairs 
I had you in the palm of my hand 
You could see that I didn't wanna stay 
Knew I wanted lovin' like a man 
I could feel your hands perspiring 
You could see my temperature rising 

[Chorus]
Take me home and we can dance all night 
Shake me baby - makes me feel alright 
Gimme some loving - till the broad day light 
Take me home and we can dance all - dance all night 

I could tell it was gettin' kinda late 
Couldn't wait to get you all alone 
You could see that I didn't wanna wait 
I can't wait for you to take me home 
Come together perfect timing 
This could all be so exciting 

[Chorus]

When I touch you set my hands on fire 
But I just can't keep my eyes off you 
You're the one that fills me with desire 
I'll do anything you want me to 
I'll do anything you want me to 

Don't think twice if the devil's gonna take 
you home tonight 
You feel so fine and I'll soon be makin' 
love to you 
I still believe in a perfume garden 
You get me beatin' something startin' 

[Chorus]
