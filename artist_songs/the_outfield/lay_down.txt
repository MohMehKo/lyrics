You're running out of luck
I know that you can be found
Each time I get a hold on you baby
You keep on knocking me down

This time could be your last chance baby
So don't be messing around

Lay down  lay down your love
Lay down your love on me
Lay down  lay down your love
Lay down your love on me

I've never been stood up  so don't be letting me down
This week I'm on a rollover baby
So don't be playing around

You might be driving a fast car baby
Don't drive me out of this town

Lay down  lay down your love
Lay down your love on me
Lay down  lay down your love
Lay down your love on me

[REPEAT CHORUS]
