Looks like she came from the sixties 
Wearing flowers in her hair 
Still in love with Sgt. Pepper 
Seen it all 'cos she was there 
Saving up her memories for another rainy day - Jane 

Sending out an invitation 
Tries to hide her dream affair 
Confidential information 
Making headlines everywhere 
She could tell the truth and watch the words get 
re-arranged - Jane 

Look at all these nowhere people 
Little piggies everywhere 
Never keeps their name or number 
String of pearls that she can't wear 
One day all her secrets might be in the news 
again - Jane 
Saving up her memories for another rainy day - Jane 

One day all her secrets might be in the news 
again - Jane
