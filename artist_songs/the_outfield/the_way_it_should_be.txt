Picture an ocean - that no one else can see 
A sea of emotion - just made for you and me 
I'd promise you anything if you'd - listen to my plea 

[Chorus]
And if you let me love you - I'd show you the way it should be 
Yes if you let me love you - I'll show you the way it should be 

Picture a sad man - alone inside his dreams 
It's just how I feel when - I try to make you see 
That you could have anything if you'd - put your trust in me 

[Chorus]

I'm always afraid of what you might think of me 
It could all be the same - the way that it used to be 

Picture a castle where - a fool is all you see 
I'm living in hope that one day - you might rescue me 
'Cos I'd wait forever if I - thought you'd set me free 

[Chorus]
