Walking down the pearly way,
Kings and queens of old are glistening.
It's a carnival, it's a big parade,
It's unethical in the modern way.
Come and look around inside Aladdin's cave.
Fill your bags with gold and wash your sins away.
Down the Roman Road, mothers can't be saved.
Under seven stars, daughters look the same.

Come and look around inside Aladdin's cave.
Fill your bags with gold and wash your sins away.

Not so long ago, legends walked these streets.
From a vantage point, sheppards lost their sheep.
Come and look around inside Aladdin's cave.
Fill your bags with gold and wash your sins away.  

Aladdin's cave...
