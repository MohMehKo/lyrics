I don't wanna spend the rest of my life living for the night 
I don't wanna spend the rest of my time hiding when I know I'm right 
Don't wanna wake up in a cold sweat praying for the day to come 
Don't wanna chase my tail until my legs are old and gone 

[Chorus]
I'm like a target always on the run 
A moving target while the day is long 
No need to shoot me down my time will come 
It won't be long - it won't be long 

I don't wann spend the rest of my life 
Like a story from a book 
I don't wanna be afraid 
When people start to look 
I don't wanna have to say 
That I'd rather be alone 
I don't wanna have to change so much 
I'm someone I don't know 

[Chorus]
[Chorus]
