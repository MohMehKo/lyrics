She wakes me up in the middle of the night 
When I'm rolling over - rolling over 
She keeps on asking is there something on my mind - I know 
She's getting close just a little too closer - and yet 
Secrets are hard form me to hide 
'Cos I never know what she might find 
Telling her lies 
Taken by surprise - taken by surprise yeah 

She calls me up every minute of the day 
It's like she's checking me over - always over my should and then 
We talk and talk until there's nothing left to say 
But she won't leave me alone every night 
She never says what's on her mind 
And the way it looks - well I know she ain't blind 
Telling her lies 
Taken by surprise - taken by surprise yeah 

You know this game is the same 
All the world over 
But no one laughs when they're taking the blame 
Over your should - taken by surprise 

Can't close my eyes in case I talk in my sleep 
Ooh I gotta lotta secrets that I know I wanna keep yeah 
And she might even know what's going on 
And it's all just an act when she says nothing's wrong 
Like a disguise 
Taken by surprise - taken by surprise
