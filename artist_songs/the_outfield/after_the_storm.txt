Open hearts 
Open eyes 
Open scars that are left upon 
Open minds 
Sacred words 
Sacrificed 
Storytellers exaggerate 
Shallow lies 

[Chorus]
After the hurt has gone away 
Oh' will we feel the pain 
After the storm begins to turn 
Oh' will we ever learn 

Open doors 
Open books 
Tragic stories repeated still 
Overlooked 
Chase the wind 
Catch a breath 
Watch a child when it falls 
Helplessness 

[Chorus]

It's never too late to say a prayer 
It might be all we got to share 
There's always a hope that someone's there 

Don't confirm unless it's sure 
Don't pretend to know a cure 
Don't convince the world you're right 
Don't deny you've never lied 

[Chorus]
