Yellowman - dealing in a back street 
Sinnerman - he's telling you it's never enough 
Nobody there - inside the mind he wasted 

[Chorus]
In a city where it's all gone wrong 
Too many people and they don't belong 
Suffocating on the air they breathe 
Selling their souls for the magic seed 

Pretty girl - standing in a doorway 
At a price - offering a bed for the night 
Nobody cares - a sign of the life she's wasted 

[Chorus]

So afraid - nowhere else to go now 
Far far away - there's a place 
that you once called home - but 

[Chorus]

Yellowman - you can't buy me 
Sinnerman - pretty girl 
Selling their souls for the magic seed
