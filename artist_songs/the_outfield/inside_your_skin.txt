Inside your skin - there's a girl I want to know 
Inside your skin - you could let my feelings grow 
Where do I begin - to tell you that I want you so 

[Chorus]
Doesn't matter what color you are 
Doesn't matter if you're so far away 

Inside your arms - I would always feel secure 
Inside your arms - I would always be so sure 
Tearing us apart - would only make me want you more 

[Chorus]

Think about a world - free of pain 
Think about a world - where nothing changed 
Always the same 

Inside your heart - no one's ever been before 
Inside your heart - someone who remained so pure 
Knowing where to stop or to start 
Telling you I want you more 

[Chorus]
[Chorus]
