One day the California sun will come your way
Walking along through endless rain
Wonder if times will ever change
Hearing the wind that cry's your name
Too many leaves upon the ground
Everyone else seems safe and sound
Faith is your only consolation

One day the California sun will come your way
One day the California sun will come your way

Lost in a place - nobody home
People around you they're all alone
Failure is not you own invention (oh no)

One day the California sun will come your way
One day the California sun will come your way

Waiting in line â€“ taking your turn
Every mistake's a lesson learned
Surviving the pain is no salvation (oh no)

One day the California sun will come your way
One day the California sun will come your way
One day the California sun will come your way
One day the California sun will come your way

California sunshine
California sunshine
One day - California sunshine
One day - California sunshine
