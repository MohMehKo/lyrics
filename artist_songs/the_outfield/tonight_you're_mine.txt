It's just a matter of time 
So don't walk away 
This song is nothing without you 
That's all I can say 
You know you'd break my hear - if you 
Push my love away 
But I can't wait another day 
Tonight you're mine girl 

It's just a matter of time 
So don't you forget it 
You've told me so many times 
That I won't regret it 
Some things are easy to do - yet they're 
Still so hard to say 
But I can't wait another day 

If there's no light and you can't see 
Down the end of this road 
I'll be a voice in the darkness 
I'll still be there if your dreams overload 

It's just a matter of time 
I'm not pretending 
Oh this happens once in a lifetime 
And I don't see it ending 
There's nothing else I can do - because you 
Make me feel this way 
Cos I can't wait another day 
Tonight you're mine girl
