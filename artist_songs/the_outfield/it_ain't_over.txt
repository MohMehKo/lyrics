You ask me if times have changed
And I refuse to be a liar
Just like a fool I'm still in love with you

It's been a long long time - but it ain't over
You couldn't make up your mind but it ain't over

If you need me call my name
Though my love is not for hire
Stop the pain start to live again

It's been a long long time - but it ain't over
You couldn't make up your mind but it ain't over

I get hurt - each time you tell those little white lies
Can't sleep what's wrong I still think about you all night long

If you leave me nothing's left
You could steal my heart's desire
Don't be cruel I'm still in love with you

It's been a long long time - but it ain't over
You couldn't make up your mind but it ain't over

If you need me call my name
If you leave me nothing's left
