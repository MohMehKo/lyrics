There's a little girl, sitting on the end of her bed
She's frightened of the things that were said - stares at the sky
There's a little boy, too afraid of closin' his eyes
Didn't think he'd be so surprised - he can't disguise

He knows it's there, soarin out the window
His mother say's "You sure?" - he say's "I think so"
Is there anyone out there, out there

Tiny lights come down from the sky
Tiny lights surround them tonight
Every single color in a rainbow
Where'd you think they come from - I don't know
Where'd you think they come from - I don't know
Where'd you think they come from - I don't know

There's an old man, rocking to and fro in a chair
He says he always knew they were there - he doesn't care
Been a long time, so long he can't remember the nights
When he saw the very first lights - they thought he was lying

His wife's afraid, tell's her not to worry
She packs her things - she's leavin in a hurry
Is there anyone out there, out there

Tiny lights come down from the sky
Tiny lights surround them tonight
Every single color in a rainbow
Where'd you think they come from - I don't know
Where'd you think they come from - I don't know
Where'd you think they come from - I don't know

Is there anybody out there, is there anybody out there
Is there anybody out there, is there anybody out there
Is there anybody out there, is there anybody out there
Is there anybody out there, is there anybody out there
Is there anybody out there, is there anybody out there
