The raintown boys are leaving today 
Heading on out to the shoreline 
The greytown boys are tired of this place 
They're not coming back anymore 

They're gonna find a new life in the city 
Don't wanna live in black and white 
'Cos nothing's gonna change the talkin's over 
Too many wasted years gone by 

The raintown boys ain't coming back to town no more 
They've had enough of living in the past for sure 

The sadtown girls are crying inside 
Thoughts are out there in the darkness 
They'd given their hearts to the boys in the past 
Now it's so lonely without them 

It's late at night but downtown in the city 
They walk the streets - the lights turn red 
A broken voice in their imagination 
They can't believe the things she said 

I can give you more than anyone can 
Perfect strangers living in a new land 

The raintown boys are so far away 
Been living it up on the shore 
No doubt in their minds they're gonna stay 
There's nothing left to go home for 

They've found a better life inside this city 
Their fears are gone - their fortunes changed 
Just like they were made for one another 
The boy's won't ever be the same 

The raintown boys ain't coming back to town no more 
They've had enough of living in the past for sure 

No more - no more - no more 
No more - no more - no more
