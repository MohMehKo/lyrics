Where is your heart tonight
I would be lost without you
Walking these streets again
Searching to find a grain of sand

How can I learn if we pretend
Someday I'll find my rainbow's end

Who rides this chariot of pleasure
Over the ruins of Rome
Who waves the flag tonight
Who lights the fires of [?]

How can I learn if we pretend
Someday I'll find my rainbow's end

Who'll calm this anger inside
Who'll give me comfort after a storm

How can I learn if we pretend
Someday I'll find my rainbow's end
