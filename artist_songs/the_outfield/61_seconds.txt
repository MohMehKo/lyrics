Without a word I'd know what to say
If you stared at me my eyes would refuse to stray
61 seconds is all it takes
For the 9 to 5 man to be more than one minute late

There's a clock on the wall
A mirror reflecting it all
Just an imageless photograph

To wake up not knowing where I am today
I don't drive the same car


I don't live the same way

[Chorus]
61 seconds is all it takes
For the 9 to 5 man to be more than one minute late
There's a clock on the wall
A mirror reflecting it all
Just an imageless photograph
There's a space in a frame
Can you imagine a man with no name
I can, I can, I can

[Chorus]
