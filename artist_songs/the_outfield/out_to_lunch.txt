I'm shy; out of my head
You shy; won't understand me

Don't come knocking at my door tonight
Tell all my friends shy; i'm all screwed up
Don't come messing with my head tonight
Tell all my friends shy; I'm so far out to lunch

I' m shy; under a spell
You shy; won't recognize me

Don't come knocking at my door tonight
Tell all my friends shy; I'm all screwed up
Don't come messing with my head tonight
Tell all my friends shy; I'm so far out to lunch

I'm out to lunch shy; mmm shy; won't you listen shy; I'm to lunch

Hey shy; just let me sleep
Please shy; don't pressurize me

Don't come knocking at my door tonight
Tell all my friends shy; I'm all screwed up
Don't come messing with my head tonight
Tell all my friends shy; I'm so far out to lunch
Don't come knocking at my door tonight
Tell all my friends shy; I'm all screwed up
Don't come messing with my head tonight
Tell all my friends shy; I'm so far out to lunch

I'm shy; out of my head shy; I'm out of my head
