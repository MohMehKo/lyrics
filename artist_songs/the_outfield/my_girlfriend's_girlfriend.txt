She was my girlfriend's girlfriend (yeah)

I woke up  in someone's bed
I couldn't remember what happened last night
I heard a voice  then someone said
Roll over baby  don't be wasting my time
La la la la  la la la la
I prayed for someone I'd recognize
La la la la  la la la la
I didn't know that I was in for one great big surprise

She was my girlfriend's girlfriend yeah
She was my girlfriend's girl

I turned around  unsure
She looked so good  you could have picked me off the floor
This is cool  this is it
I feel so bad I can't remember what we did
La la la la  la la la la
She said 'boy you'd better open your eyes?
La la la la  la la la la
In walked my girlfriend  she jumped on the other side

She was my girlfriend's girlfriend yeah
She was my girlfriend's girl

La la la la  la la la la
She said 'boy you'd better open your eyes
La la la la  la la la la
In walked my girlfriend  she jumped on the other side

She was my girlfriend's girlfriend yeah
She was my girlfriend's girl

She was my girlfriend's girlfriend yeah
She was my girlfriend's girl

[REPEAT CHORUS]
