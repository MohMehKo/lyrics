Everytime I look at you I see Heaven's little angel
I can see the light that shines around you every day
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Everytime I think of you I see Heaven's little angel
When I close my eyes and I can't sleep, I call your name

And I'll never stop loving you my little angel
You make the sun shine on a cold and cloudy day

Every little thing you do is like a little angel
You were always there for me to wipe my tears away

And I'll never stop loving you my little angel
You make the sun shine on a cold and cloudy day

Yeah!
Ooh, my angel
And I'll never stop loving you my little angel
You make the sun shine on a cold and cloudy day

And if my dreams should all come true - my little angel
You'll be there for me until my dying day
You'll be there for me until my dying day
You'll be there for me until my dying day - c'mon

Ooh, my angel
My little angel
Ooh, my angel
My little angel
