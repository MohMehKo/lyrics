Cherry, where you been since 9 this morning? 
Give me all the names who saw you there 
But if they can't remember 
I know that you'll surrender 
Another nervous alibi 

Cherry, what's this game you think you're playing 
Don't you know I hate those clothes you wear 
For I've seen men undress you 
And with their eyes caress you 
Another nervous alibi 

Cherry, name the day and I'll be waiting 
Give me just one chance to show I care 
I know if we're together 
It can go on forever 
Another Nervous Alibi
