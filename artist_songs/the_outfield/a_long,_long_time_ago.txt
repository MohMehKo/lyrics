I lay my cards on the table
You can see I had no chance at winning
But tonight that means nothing
This was mine to lose from the beginning

Does it matter that it matters at all
I had you a long, long time ago
I can hear your voices calling
Whoa Whoa Whoa

So turn around face to face now
Tell me what's been going on in your head
Cause I know you've been restless
Someone else just spent the night in your bed

Does it matter that it matters at all
I had you a long, long time ago
I can hear your voices calling
Such a long, long time ago
Tragedy forever haunting

I lay my head on my pillow
No one else can hurt me while I'm sleeping
For tonight I was lonely
I just needed someone to believe in
