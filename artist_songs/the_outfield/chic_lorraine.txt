There's only so much fun I can take
Before I'm ready to break
You make it happen girl - you make it happen girl

And you can take my lovin' outside
Don't you take my love for a ride
You make it happen girl - oh it really happens girl

You know that I'm not ready to wait
I don't wanna be late

Oh chic lorraine  here she comes again
I've been up all night  love don't come no better
Ooh than chic lorraine

There's only so many rivers I'd cross
My love's already lost - you make it happen girl
Oh you make it happen girl

I?m gonna touch you deeper inside
And that's so hard to describe
You make it happen girl - oh you make it happen girl

Don't keep me standing out in the rain
She can turn me on just the same

Oh chic lorraine  here she comes again
I've been up all night  love don't come no better
Oh chic lorraine  here she comes again
I've been up all night  love don't come no better

Sometimes she's got a heart of stone
And I don't wanna leave her alone

There's only so much fun I can take
Before I'm ready to break
You make it happen girl
You make it happen girl

And you can take my lovin' outside
Don't you take my love for a ride
You make it happen
Oh it really happens girl

You know that I'm not ready to wait
I don't wanna be late

[repeat chorus]
