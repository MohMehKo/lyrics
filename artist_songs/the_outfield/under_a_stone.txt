Highnoon driver's got a kick tail beater 
And he rides just as fast as he knows 
Long shot dealer sold a real fire eater 
Burning money just as fast as she goes 
Kid don't care 'cos he can't get enough 
Easy come - easy go 
Tells his mama that he ain't living under a stone 
An' he's ready oh - oh 

Late night pleaser spends her daytime teaching 
In the small town missionary hall 
Back seat teaser never takes any money 
But her friends make it nailed to the wall 
She don't care 'cos she can't get enough 
One way ticket to the ball 
Tells here mama that she ain't living under a stone 

One night in the middle of Main Street 
Riding in a big flash car 
Sets his eyes on the good time seeker 
She jumps inside but they go too far 

Years go by and they've both grown older 
Kinda' sorry for the things that they did 
Lookin' back they could have both been something 
But their caution ran away with the wind 
Life ain't never been an easy touch 
They got a house that they can't afford 
And teenage kids saying they can't live under a stone
