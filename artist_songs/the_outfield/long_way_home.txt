I drive these streets alone in silence 
Another ride trying to clear my head 
But all I hear is just the beat of my heart 
I think of her but I see you instead 

[Chorus]
And there's a thousand little lies 
A thousand little reasons 
For me to stay - for me to go 
And there's a thousand little voices 
Inside my head saying 
Take the long way home 

I tell myself that it's all over 
But then I see you and I just don't know 
What should I listen to my heart or my mind 
Too tired to think about the way I should go 

[Chorus]

There's no one out there when you need to decide 
And you're on your own 
You keep on thinking 'bout the wrong that you've done 
You try to hide but there's no place to run 

[Chorus]
