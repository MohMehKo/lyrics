You keep telling me everything's gonna be cool tonight 
But I keep thinking that you might be going outta 
your mind 
It's a perfect little invitation 
But I gotta lot of reservations 
So leave a message on the line for me 
Girl you know I'm gonna need a sign 
And if you wanna take a ride with me 
Better call me up - leave a message on the line 

You keep telling me he don't got a clue 
about anything 
But I keep thinking that he knows it's going on 
all right 
I guess I've got a lot of hesitation 
I'm gonna give it some investigation 

[Chorus]

I keep thinkin' that I'm gonna need a rocket 
just to calm me down 
But you keep telling me everything's gonna be fine 
I don't wann be your service station 
You could always get a good vibration 

[Chorus]
