I wonder how I'd feel 
If we made love together 
I wonder how I'd feel 
Everytime we trembled 
In each others arms 

I wonder how I'd feel 
If we could spend this night together 
I wonder how I'd feel 
With your body held against me 
All through the night 

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh 
Shelter me 
Oh-oh-oh 
I need you to shelter me 

I wonder how I'd feel 
If our emotions came together 
I wonder how I'd feel 
If the future was forever 
And not just tonight 

[Chorus]

This time it's not so easy to take 
A broken heart can't be replaced 
Don't wanna play a waiting game 
From the moment we part 
I'll be counting the days 

I wonder how I'd feel 
If we made love together 
I wonder how I'd feel 
Everytime we trembled 
In each others arms
