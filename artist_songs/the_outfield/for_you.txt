I'm so sad, feelin' blue.
Since you left, I've been missin' you.
Need your love, oh, so bad.
Realize everything we had.

All day, all night,
You can have it any way you want it.
One love so right.
Don't you know that I live my life for you?

I was wrong, my mistake.
I regret. Look at the price I paid.
Take these words. Understand.
Try forgive me. I'm a broken man.

All day, all night,
You can have it any way you want it.
One love so right.
Don't you know that I live my life for you?

For you.
You can have it any way you want it.
For you.
For you.
Doesn't matter if the sun don't shine.
For you.
For you.
Oh, any way you want it.
For you.
For you.
Doesn't matter if the sun don't shine.
