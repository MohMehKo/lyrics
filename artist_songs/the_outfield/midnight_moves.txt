My baby's coming home in a minute
Arriving on the midnight train
I don't think we'll get a second of sleep
Once she's in these arms again
I've been waiting such a long time
Get on back where you belong
Step inside and take a cool drink honey
Tonight nothing's going wrong

I'm playing all my late night records
You're dancing in your high heeled shoes
I'm deep inside the right track honey
Just making all the midnight moves (woh woh)

My baby's gonna do the locomotion
Tonight she's gonna ride me like a train
She won't leave me standing at the station
Cos the tunnel of love's on fire again

There's no need to get a ticket
My destination's been approved
All dressed up in something skin tight honey
This one made for me and you

I'm playing all my late night records
You're dancing in your high heeled shoes
I'm deep inside the right track honey
Just making all the midnight moves

Make no mistake there ain't no way I'm turning you down
I don't think you'd ever laugh at the tears of this clown

Miss communication
Tell me what you see
Somewhere in your soul tonight
There's a place for me
I'm in need of someone
You could share my dream
Maybe I'm not good for you
You'd be good for me
