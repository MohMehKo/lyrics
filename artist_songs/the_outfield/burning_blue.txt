I don't wanna have to shout while the day is long 
Repeating all the things that I've said and done 
Only words you know so well 

And if I could explain what you want from me 
Satisfy your insecurity 
Something that you've failed to see 

Oh my love for you - well it's still as new 
And it's burning blue 

I should a known better 
Why can't I forget her 
She's an operator 

I don't wanna have to shout from a mountain top 
So try to realize all the things we got 
How come you don't understand 

There'll never be a future we can trust 
Tomorrow's all we need in front of us 
One day at a time's enough 

And my love for you - well it's still as new 
And it's burning blue 

I should a known better 
Why can't I forget her 
She's an operator 

An' my love for you - it still feels as new 
An' it's burning blue 

All across the nation 
Open invitation 
No exaggeration 
I should a known better 
Why can't I forget her 
She's an operator 

An' my love for you - it's still burning blue
