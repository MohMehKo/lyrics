Got a letter from a mystery man 
but in between the lines - he don't understand 
He's on a mission in Mozambique 
The room is wired and I just can't speak 

[Chorus]
In the middle of it all - he can waste no time 
In the middle of it all - he just says goodbye, goodbye 

Got to get there just as fast I can 
A pink carnation on a mystery man 
A rendezvouz in Romania 
Double agents in Australia 

[Chorus]
[Chorus]
[Chorus]
