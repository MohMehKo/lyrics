A soul full of anger - but nothing to show 
A world wrapped in cotton - but nowhere to go 
Obsessed by a woman that you didn't know 
Don't turn around - don't turn around 

Torn between lovers - both mothers as well 
A mind a prison - a heart in a cell 
If only the screams could be heard from this hell 
Don't turn around - don't turn around 

You were surprised by a girl in the sky 
who changed everyone 
And as your life became so mystified 
There was a lonely heart - left by the side 

Tomorrow could never be just one more day 
Confused by an image - refusing to stay 
The child in your mind always wanted its way 
Don't turn around - don't turn around 

Then on a day in your life 
still remembered by everyone 
There was a man with a gun at his side 
You and your monkey had nowhere to hide 

He was the man that was sent from the rye 
Don't turn around - don't turn around 

So many things on his mind 
I'm not sure if he knew 
Why he blew you away 
I can't decide if it's true 
What he thought on that day 

Don't be afraid when the day turns to night 
Don't be ashamed when I turn out the lights 
Call out my name and I'd hold you so tight 
Don't turn around - don't turn around
