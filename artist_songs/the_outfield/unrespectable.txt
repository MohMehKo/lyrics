She no lady 
One bad girl 
She go crazy 
Private world 
I can hear the people talkin' 
From a million miles away 
I don't care what they been thinkin' 
I don't care what they say 
She's unrespectable 
Unrespectable 

She's so easy 
Got no class 
Good time baby 
Love don't last 
I wake up in the morning 
Don't believe the things I said 
I never walk the streets with you girl 
I wouldn't kick you outta bed 
She's so unrespectable 
Unrespectable 
So unrespectable 
Unrespectable 

Sht still shake me 
Night and day 
Never learnt her lesson 
I'm still treating her the same 
Like any Mona Lisa 
She ain't never gonna change 
She's so unrespectable 
Unrespectable 
So unacceptable 
Unrespectable
