You said you see me running 
and that is no surprise 
When I was far from danger 
I opened my eyes 
Now I look back in anger 
for I did nothing wrong 
It's just a race for strangers 
and this race goes on 

[Chorus]
I'm so glad that I don't need her 
and I'm too tired of trying to please her 
but in the end I just can't leave her 
Can't leave her tonight 

You've got a different story 
from anything that I've been told 
but you evade the glory 
Come in from the cold 
Don't wait until tomorrow 
Don't push it back another day 
Don't try to hide your sorrow 
What else can I say 

[Chorus]

You said you see me running 
but that was no surprise 
When I was far from danger 
I opened my eyes 

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
