For once  in my life
Well I wished that I
Could just say what's on my mind
But I'm afraid 
In case the words don't come out right
And if I should try
Do you think that you would understand me'

Oh oh oh maybe it's a crime what I'm thinking
Don't you wanna know why
Baby it's a crime what I'm thinking

Well I've tried  so hard
And I wished that I could just get the moment right
But everytime there's always someone in this room
And so  tonight
If I get the chance I'll share my secret

Oh oh oh maybe it's a crime what I'm thinking
Don't you wanna know why
Baby it's a crime what I'm thinking

Oh I'm  just like
Any other man I just want the best out of life
But in the end I know I'll take what I can get
If I  should try
Do you think that you would stand beside me

Oh oh oh maybe it's a crime what I'm thinking
Don't you wanna know why
Baby it's a crime what I'm thinking

Oh, won't you stand by my side
Just a little bit longer
Just a little bit longer
Oh  for just once in your life
Stand by me  stand me

Just a little bit longer just a little longer
Just a little bit longer just a little bit
Come on baby come on baby
