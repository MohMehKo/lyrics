I'm gonna tell you that I want you
I'm gonna hold you in my arms tonight
Ain't no body gonna take this girl of mine
I'm gonna squeeze you little darling
I'm gonna tell you everything's alright
Ain't nobody gonna take this girl of mine

I saw you yesterday
Standing outside my room 
Didn't know what to say
Baby I felt such a fool
Hoping that one day
You might think it's cool
Look at me another way
Please don't see the fool

I'm gonna tell you that I want you
I'm gonna hold you in my arms tonight
Ain't no body gonna take this girl of mine
I'm gonna squeeze you little darling
I'm gonna tell you everything's alright
Ain't nobody gonna take this girl of mine

I'm thinking that someday
I've gotta next to you
It's driving me crazy
I'm wondering what to do
All I know is that one day
This might be complete
Things are going my way
Down on sadness street

This might heaven tonight but I'm too lost to know
If I'm not in heaven tonight then I'm sure it's the right place to go

If you didn't need me 
What would I say to you
Please believe me
Girl my heart beats too
All I'm hoping is one day
My dreams will all come true
But I wish it was yesterday
Girl it couldn't be too soon

[repeat chorus]
