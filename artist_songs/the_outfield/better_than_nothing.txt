[Chorus]
It's better than nothing girl 
It's better than nothing at all 
It's better than nothing girl 
It's better than nothing 

Let's find a hideaway tonight 
Somewhere where we can be together 
I'm tired of waiting for the right time 
If this is not the Ritz whatever 

[Chorus]

I wanna hold more than your hand 
I wanna touch more than emotion 
You don't need words to understand 
This hole might be run down and broken 

[Chorus]

Don't think because I just can't wait that I don't care 
This isn't meant to be a back seat love affair 

[Chorus]
