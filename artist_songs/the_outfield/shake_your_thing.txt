Turn it up just a little bit.
Shake your thing like your momma did.
Start it up take another trip.
Say goodbye to the mother ship.

It's been such a long time.
You knew we were waiting in the wings.
It feels like the right moment.
As the circus comes to town there ain't no one else around.

Move on down just a little bit.
On the edge get a better grip.
Keep it right on a precipice.
Shake your thing like your momma did.

It's been such a long time.
You knew we were waiting in the wings.
It feels like the right moment.
As the circus comes to town there ain't no one else around.

We're at the crossroads... 
It's been a cold lonely winter.
If we don't jump the train you know we turn our backs forever.
Here we go!

[Instrumental]

Turn it up just a little bit.
Play it loud like your papa did.
Start it up take another trip.
Don't look back from the mother ship.

It's been such a long time.
You knew we were waiting in the wings.
It feels like the right moment.
As the circus comes to town...

As the circus comes to town there ain't no one else around.

As the circus comes to town...
Shake your thing! [x2] Turn it up! [x2]
Shake your thing like your momma did.
Turn it up! [x2] Start it up! [x2]
As the circus comes to town...
Shake your thing! [x2]
