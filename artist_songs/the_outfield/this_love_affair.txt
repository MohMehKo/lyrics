Hold me now and catch as these tears start to fall,
Thery'll be nothing here without you after all,
U cant face the truth if u decide to stay,
This might hurt you now but please don't walk away

[Chorus]
Endless love affair,
Still lingers there inside my heart,
Yes this love affair continues there inside my heart

Tell me now for there things cant recall
I never understood the meaning of it all

I feel so lonely,
I could fly,
I feel so lonely

Early morning, snow begins to fall,
I remember every moment of it all
