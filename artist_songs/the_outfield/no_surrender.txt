No surrender 
Even if it's over 
No surrender 
Stop pretending 
You never cared for me 
'Cos I remember 
Words that we shared 
A promise to keep 
If they meant nothing to you 
Well they still mean a whole lot to me 

[Chorus]
And if you tell me 
To just walk away 
And forget you forever 
Then all I would say 
Is no surrender 

Even if you leave me 
No surrender 
Stop pretending 
You never said those things 
'Cos I remember 
I remember 
One small mistake 
Turned into a crime 
Oh but if I take the blame 
You can go but I won't say goodbye 

[Chorus]
[Chorus]
