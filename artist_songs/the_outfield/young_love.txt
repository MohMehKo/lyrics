Young Love - bigger than anything 
You're waitin' for a girl to ring 
Talkin' bout young love 

And I don't want anyone else to call your name 
And I don't think anyone else could feel the same 

[Chorus]
I can't stop thinkin' about 
The way she's holding it out 
I'm talkin' bout young love 

Young love - bigger than everything 
Shines like a diamond ring 
Talkin' bout young love 

And I don't think anyone else could understand 
And I don't want anyone else to be your man 

[Chorus] 

And I don't want anyone else to call your name 
And I don't think anyone else could feel the same 

Young love - bigger than everything 
Waitin' for the bells to ring 
Talkin' bout young love 

Na na na na - na na na na na young love 
Na na na na - na na na na na young love
