Hey you - what's your problem - I been mystified 
You might come from a different city - your body talks just like mine 
Some things get misunderstood - and we can't stop the fight 
But there's one thing that we don't disagree on putting right 

[Chorus]
Makin' up - makin' up by makin' love 
Makin' up - makin' up by makin' love 

Hey I don't need to be teased - I'm no suicide 
You might think I'm on the edge - just about to dive 
Don't look back or turn around - when you say you've gone for sure 
'Cos every night when talk gets cheap - you still come back for more 

[Chorus]

Hey little dream maker - you can stick the cream 
I've abused so many times - I don't believe in me 
It's the best if I suggest - and you just try to please 
There's one thing we both agree - can end hostility 

[Chorus]
