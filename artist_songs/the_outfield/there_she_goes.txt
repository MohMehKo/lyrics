I remember the past,
Just like it was yesterday,
Dreams are all that I have,
And nothing mattered anyway.

Cause' I looked out my window (cause' I looked out there),
I see you walk by (I see you walkin')

Oh oh there she goes again (there she goes),
Oh oh there she goes again,
Never know (never know), 
Where she goes (where she goes).

I remember the nights (I remember the nights),
God it seems like yesterday (seems like yesterday),
All the streets were alive (all the streets were alive),
And London was the place to be (still the only place).

Cause' I looked out my window (cause' I looked out there),
I see you walk by (I see you walkin')

Oh oh there she goes again (there she goes),
Oh oh there she goes again,
Never know (never know), 
Where she goes (where she goes).

Cause' I looked out my window (cause' I looked out there),
I see you walk by (I see you walkin').

Oh oh there she goes again (there she goes),
Oh oh there she goes again (there she goes),
Oh oh there she goes again (there she goes),
Oh oh there she goes again,
Never know (never know), 
Where she goes (where she goes).
Never know (never know), 
Where she goes (where she goes).
