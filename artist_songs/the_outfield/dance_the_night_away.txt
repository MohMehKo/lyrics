Growing up ain't easy
Especially when you're young
And everyone you know is older than their years
And growing up ain't easy
When the only girl you want
Looks at you like you just disappeared

But you keep holding on
To every little thing that she's done
And if you? re chance came along
You'd make it clear

Hold me close close your eyes
Dance the night away

Growing up ain't easy
When time is on your side
And you? re wishing that these times would pass you by
Everytime a door is opened
There's nothing on the other side

Just another door for you to try and find

But you keep holding on
And hoping that you're times gonna come
And she can do nothing wrong
You make it clear

Hold me close close your eyes
Dance the night away

But you keep holding on
To every little thing that she's done
And if you're chance came along
You'd make it clear

Hold me close close your eyes
Dance the night away
Hold me close close your eyes
Dance the night away

Dance the night away
Dance the night away
