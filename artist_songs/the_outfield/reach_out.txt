Never been afraid to learn - at the speed I've been living
Never tried to run away - when my luck's been sinking
Looking back doesn't seem that long
I was too blind to see what was going on

Tried to reach out and touch you but you were gone - Oh I
Sometimes I wonder If I was wrong - so wrong

Never been afraid to say - anything I been thinking
Never tried to run away - even from the beginning
Looking back doesn't seem that long
The way I feel now don't care if I carry on

Tried to reach out and touch you but you were gone - Oh I
Sometimes I wonder If I was wrong - so wrong

Tried to reach out - tried to touch you
Tried to reach out - tried to touch you

Tried to reach out and touch you but you were gone - Oh I
Sometimes I wonder If I was wrong - so wrong
