I still remember what I saw last night 
Three small kids stealing money from a poor man 
Now that ain't right - no that ain't right 
I'm still thinking 'bout the things I heard 
Poor old man - he was frightened and afraid of every word 
- and it's all so absurd 

But times are changing now an d I still care 
There must be something we can do out there 
I'm like a stranger in my own town baby 
I'm like a stranger in my own town baby 

I keep on walkin' through these run down streets 
Graffiti walls - this ain't nothing like it used to be 
Not for you or for me 
This town's never been so down before 
Looks like a photograph - someone mighta taken in 
the second world war 
Oh but what was that for 

So many people gave their lives for this 
There's nothing left for us to reminisce 
I'm like a stranger in my own town baby 
I'm like a stranger in my own town baby 

When those sad days were over 
I'm sure they all thought that weld won 
But now as I look around 
We're still invaded by everyone 

Things won't ever be the same again 
I've not lost a town - I've lost my only friend 
Oh but where does it end 
We'll never change these times with good intent 
But right now I know I don't feel content 

I'm like a stranger in my own town baby 
I'm like a stranger in my own town baby
