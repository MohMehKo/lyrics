I'm not afraid in the dark 
To say what I fell 
And I'm just too scared to tell ya 
What I know is real 

[Chorus]
But I can't wait any longer for the lights to go down 
Wait any longer for the lights to go down 
Wait any longer for the lights to go 
Down can't you see 
Baby when you talk to me 
Baby when you talk to me 
Talk to me 
Baby when you talk to me 
I wanna hold you so close 
Each beat of the day 
I call you up on the phone 
Nothing to say 

[Chorus]

Since we first you were the only one 
Sometimes I forget - I'm still the lonely one 
Ooh-ooh-ooh 
I'm in a trap - sealed by your lips - 
Scared to go anywhere 
Thinking about - those things I miss - 
Whenever you're not there 

[Chorus]
[Chorus]
