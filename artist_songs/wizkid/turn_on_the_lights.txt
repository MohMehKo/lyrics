See girl I gave you my heart
Is that what you’re gonna do with it
You tore the shit apart
And you played a fool with it
Now I got my heart back
And I don’t even know what to do with it
Girl you broke your promises
You lied and you cheated
Oh girl you make me mad
With the way you played a fool with me
Oh girl you make me sad
With the things that you did to me
But the devil that you know
Is not an Angel you don’t know
So I would try to make this work one more time
Say, I treat you like my sister
Love you like my mama
Take you all around the world
We gonna fly to eat Pizza
When we’re on our honey moon
We’re gonna fly to eat pizza
Oh girl we make them mad
So girl

Oh Baby turn on the lights
Say baby turn on the lights
Oh girl I’d be the best you ever had in your life
Oh baby girl be my wife
Let’s live a beautiful life
Oh girl I’d treat you right
Girl I swear on my life
Say Baby turn on the lights
Say baby turn on the lights
Oh girl I’d be the best you ever had in your life
Oh baby girl be my wife
Let’s live a beautiful life
Oh girl I’d treat you right
Girl I swear on my life
Say Baby turn on the lights

Me and you inside my motor
Baby na me and you till the end of time

Girl no one but you
Buy you the finest designer
Girl you know the koko o o o
Omo mi mo nife re gidigan ni

Rocking in my Armani
You rocking in your Jimmy Choo
Tell the haters no stopping
