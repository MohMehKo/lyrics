Caught me a beemer, like fuck it

Do it big, in the bizz
Me and Wiz wassup
Get it right
Green and white
Who’s rocking with us?
Ten over ten like Naeto
I got paid out Barbados
Getting paper with Banky
Some our bankers be anxious
It’s so easy to book’em
They’re real work is to train’em
All these chicks got enough in me
Me and Wiz got a stable
My chain got new canary
And you’re too ordinary
I know I look Akata but shout-out to Surulere
I’m on that paper plane
Still bumping players hate
We making money
We making moves
You making hate
