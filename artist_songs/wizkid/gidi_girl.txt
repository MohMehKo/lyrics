Repping EME zee

[Verse 1:]
You are the one that I want girl
More precious to me than diamonds and pearls
Just like a star you light up my world
The way I feel inside
Always on my mind
And I can’t get over you
Cos you got me so confused
you got me in the mood
And you make me feel brand new (feel brand new)

[Chorus:]
You’re my gidi girl
E be like say I hammer
Me and you forever
You’re my gidi girl
Your love dey make me maga
Me and you forever..ever eh ee

[Verse 2:]
She’s my moonlight, she lights up my world
I’ll never ever leave you this day
I promise I’ll stay with you till the end
Never leave your side
Be my bride
You’re my type
You’re my life
You plus me equals light
You leave me and it equals night

Girl me really want you beside me
Me be your king and you be my wifey
Everyday me want you to stand right beside me
No one can take your place
Girl me really want you beside me
Me be your king and you be my wifey
Everyday me want you to stand right beside me

[Repeat Chorus 2x]

You’re my only girl
And I am your only man
I can’t deny the attraction that I feel inside
Girl you so fine
And you so fly
Baby na you be my angel

[Repeat Chorus 2x]
