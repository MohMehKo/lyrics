Uh uh uh yea yeah yea
Berry on this
Starboy things
Say dey be feeling my sound from Lagos to Soweto
South African girls dem a be big booty shaker
My Ghanaian girls got me hooked up yea
My Lagos girls got me shaking

[Chorus]
Feeling my song from lagos to soweto
South African girls dem a be big booty shaker
My Ghanaian girls got me hooked oh yeah
My Lagos girls got me shaking

[Verse 1]
I’m on a mission
Looking for the right one
To keep me company
I’m on a mission
Looking for the girl for me
To share my life with me
A true friend and my homie
With you I’ll never feel lonely
Lets laugh, let cry, lets ride together
In the sun, in the rain lets stay forever
See all these standing by you girl
Say if you promise you’ll stand right by me
The way you back up and whine
You steal the show
And I’m loving the way you move your body girl
You got a badman feeling sef
With the way you move
Girl you kill this show
And I’m loving the things that you do to me
And I promise to keep and love you faithfully

[Chorus (2x)]
Feeling my song from Lagos to Soweto
South African girls dem a be big booty shaker
My Ghanaian girls got me hooked oh yeah
My Lagos girls got me shaking

[Verse 2]
Go down go down pretty girl
Mama don’t you ever leave
Baby go down slow down
Go down girl with you I wanna be
Go down go down pretty girl
Mama don’t you ever leave
The way you rock the show now
Go down slow down
With you I wanna be
Baby
I can’t wait much longer
It’s getting stronger and stronger
When I get this feeling
Girl I want sexual healing
Sexual healing baby

[Chorus (2x)]
Say they be feeling my song from Lagos to Soweto
South African girls dem a be big booty shaker
My Ghanaian girls got me hooked oh yeah
My Lagos girls got me shaking

Yeah gurl
This is a sexy tune dedicated to all the sexy,
Beautiful African ladies all around the world
I wanna see all pretty girls, and sexy girls
And pretty girls, my sexy girls
My pretty girls, my pretty girls
Get up and dance along
I wanna see all pretty girls, and sexy girls
And pretty girls, my sexy girls
My pretty girls, my pretty girls
Get up and dance along

[Chorus (2x)]
Say they be feeling my song from Lagos to soweto
South African girls dem a be big booty shaker
My Ghanaian girls got me hooked oh yeah
My Lagos girls got me shaking
