EME soldier, young K the king
taking no chance we dey rap we dey sing
so called rappers they don’t mean a thing
you can turn out the lights and we still gone bling
its commercial I’m selling it
every story that I got, I’m telling it
sometimes haters hate when I elevate
I’m known not to give a fuck I’m celibate
I feel like I cant tell a lie
I’m the truth and excellence is all that I testify
and every show that I’m at is electrified
long as you let me drive you’ll enjoy the ride
triple threat, triple treat
getting money every single day of the week
say you want beef, but all you do is tweet
these rappers are all chickens all we do is eat
