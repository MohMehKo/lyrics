[Chorus]
Yea, she winds it for me
The way she goes down low
I am feeling her body and soul
I want to take her home
She grinds it for me
I love the way she goes down low
I am feeling her body and soul
I want to take her home
That girl down low
Give me that thing for sure
Please go down low
That girl down low
Give me that thing for sure
Please just give me love

[Verse 1]
Wait, it’s Wizzy and Wande Coal
Everybody get on the floor
Let the music play all night
Make we dance and party all night
Oya the music ginger you
No dulling make nothing hinder you
From dancing and winding and grinding down low
Oya kalamgolo on the floor
Let the music take control

[Chorus]
Yea, she winds it for me
The way she goes down low
I am feeling her body and soul
I want to take her home
She grinds it for me
I love the way she goes down low
I am feeling her body and soul
I want to take her home

Popping bottles going on 15, going on 16, going to 19
