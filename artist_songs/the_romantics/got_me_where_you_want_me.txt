Little girl
You're such a tease
Everytime
Aim to please
Checkin' out
Other fellas
You make me mad
You get me jealous

[CHORUS]
Love the way you walk
Love the way you talk
I'm a sucker when I look in your eyes
You got me
Got me where you want me
You got me
You want me-you got me

Ouch-
Really hurts
Everytime
See you flirt
Don't stop
Keep it goin'
You get me up
And you know it

[CHORUS]

Wait a minute
Before you go
One more thing
You gotta know
I'm ready
No doubt about it
You want love
Well I got it

[CHORUS]
