I give you anything to keep you satisfied
If you should (hold(?)) on me 
You know that I (close(?)) by
I spend my time on you
I'm spending all my money too
Spend a little love on me
Spend a little love on me
Spend a little love on me
Spend a little love on me

You own the latest things
I keep you up in style
You let me take you out
But only for a little while
I spend my time on you
I'm spending all my money too
Spend a little love on me
Spend a little love on me
Spend a little love on me
Spend a little love on me
Spend a little love...

Now you're (wanting(?)) a millionaire
I can't be what I'm not
But what I have is yours
I give you all I've got
I spend my time on you
I'm spending all my money too
Spend a little love on me
Spend a little love on me
Spend a little love on me
Spend a little love on me
Spend a little love on me
Spend a little love on me
Spend a little love on me
Spend a little love on me
Spend a little love on me
Spend a little love on me
Spend a little love on me
Spend a little love on me
Spend a little love on me
