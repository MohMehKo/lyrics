Left you at eight
You came back at nine
'Cause you got love
It sure is fine

I said uh I, I wanna love you some more
I said uh I, I wanna love you some more
I said uh I, I wanna love you some more
C'mon now and open up your door

An hour can be
Such a long long time
When you're in heat
[?]

I said uh I, I wanna love you some more
I said uh I, I wanna love you some more
I said uh I, I wanna love you some more
C'mon now and open up your door

I said uh I (I)

I'm all on fire
My love inside
Got a big desire
And I ain't lyin'

I said uh I, I wanna love you some more
I said uh I, I wanna love you some more
I said uh I, I wanna love you some more
C'mon now and open up your door

I said uh I (I)
