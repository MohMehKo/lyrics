I write to her when I've got a problem
She's always there to help me decide them
She's the one that I trust
I tell it to Carrie

I tell her all my thoughts in a letter
With her reply, she makes me feel better
She's the one that I trust
I tell it to Carrie

Oh Carrie, I just don't know how to tell you
I feel I'm getting too dependent and I, I rely on you girl
And I don't know what to do, don't know
And I feel so lost without you

Oh Carrie, I just don't know how to tell you girl
I feel I'm getting too dependent and I, I rely on you girl
And I don't know what to do, don't know
And I feel so lost without you

I don't know what I'd be doin' without her
I can't imagine never knowin' about her
She's the one that I trust
I tell it to Carrie

She's the one that I trust
I tell it to Carrie
She's the one that I trust
I tell it to Carrie

She's the one that I trust
I tell it to Carrie
