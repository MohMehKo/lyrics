I heard about the fella you been dancing with
All over your neighborhood
So why did you ask me baby
Or didn't you think I could?

I know you've been runnin' round all over town
Shakin' it up in the night
And if that was you and me now baby
I would show you how to do it right now
Do it right (U-huh)
Do it right
Do it right
Do it right
Aaah

[Chorus]

Roll down
Shake it shake it shake it shake it baby
Here we go loop-de-loop
Shake it up baby
Here we go loop-de-lai
Bend over let me see you shake your tailfeather
Bend over let me see you shake your tailfeather
Bend over let me see you shake your tailfeather

[Repeat Chorus]

Shake it up
Shake down now
I'm a man
Up and down
So come on
Come on baby
So come on
Come on baby
Come on
Come on baby
Come on
Come on baby
Shake, shake it, shake
Shake, shake, shake
