She's hot
She's hot
She's hot
She's hot
Ain't no doubt about it
She's something else to see
I don't gotta tell you
What she do to me

She got a fine fine face
She got a fine fine waist
She got fine fine legs
She got everything in the right place
She's hot
She's hot
She's hot
She's hot

So lonely you don't hold on me
I don't feel you in my arms
This could be trouble
She's still in my sight

She got a fine fine face
She got a fine fine waist
She got fine fine legs
She got everything in the right place
She's hot
She's hot
She's hot
She's hot

She's hot
She's hot
She's hot
I've been trying to call her
Seven days a week
I got refusing signal
Another guy to meet
She got a fine fine face
She got a fine fine waist
She got fine fine legs
She got everything in the right place
She's hot
She's hot
She's hot
She's hot
She's hot
