You're drivin' me crazy
You make me climb the walls
You got me shakin' all over
Baby just wanna ball

[CHORUS]
You know that I want you-everyday
I'm nothin' without you when you're away
No I can't stop-diggin' on you

I get the shivers
When you enter the room
I can't keep my hands to myself
They're all over you

[CHORUS]

Whenever you're aaround
I'm so up I can't come down
My head's spinnin' around and round
And I can't stop diggin' on you

Ooh you're a teaser
You're gonna drive me mad
I feel it comin' on again
You make a good boy bad

[CHORUS]
