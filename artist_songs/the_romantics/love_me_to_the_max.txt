I give you all of my loving
I give you all of my heart and soul
And in return I get nothing
I get you hot but you treat me cold

[CHORUS]
So come on-baby's holding back
So come on-give me all you got
Love me to the max

Come on to me so inviting
You try totell me that you're so shy
But when I get you excited
I see the fire burning in your eyes

[CHORUS]

I'm making love to you all of the time
I tell the world-this girl is mine
But it ain't nothing 'till you're loving me back
So come on baby-love me to the max

[CHORUS]

I give you all my devotion
I give you all of my heart and soul
And all I want is emotion
I get you hot but you treat me cold

[CHORUS]
