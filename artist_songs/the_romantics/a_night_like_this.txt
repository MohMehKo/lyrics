Rememberin' you on a night like this
Rememberin' everythin' that I miss
Rememberin' you, rememberin' me
Remember how warm a cold night could be

I need you on a night like this
All your lovin' on a night like this
Remember you, love
Such a good love, such a hot love

I think about all the places we'd hide
Think about different ways that we tried
Think about the crazy thoughts in my mind
Think about the hungry look in your eyes

I need you on a night like this
All your lovin' on a night like this
Remember you, love, such a good love
An' such a hot love on a night like this

I wanna go back to the night I miss
Wanna go back to the lips that I kissed
Wanna hold you, don't wanna let go
Want you to love me, honey, like I know you know

I need you on a night like this
All your lovin' on a night like this
Remember you, love, such a good love
Such a hot love on a night like this, like this

On a night like this, like this
Yes, on a night like this
On a night like this
On a night like this
Yeah, it's on a night like this
