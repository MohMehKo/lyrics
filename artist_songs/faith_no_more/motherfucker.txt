[Verse 1:]
Force fed more than we eat in the wild
Grazed on a mash that can suffocate a child
Bloated, promoted in an ode to pomped style
Moistened in the feed while weâ€™re choke upon the bile
Corner in the market on the geese without the bones
Hushing out the public in a strike without a drone
The cage became collapsable
Our sticks equipped with stones

[Refrain:]
Get the mother fucker on the phone, the phone [repeat]

[Chorus:]
Hello Motherfucker
My lover
You saw it coming

[Verse 2:]
Set aside the scruples in a stratagem of strain
A smallpox-laden blanket, invisible with stains
Inoculated bastards, bloody pecked pain
Distemper has a hold, distemper has a hold
We took a second sip from a cup we made of bones
The first it was a ruse, a trick so aptly thrown
The truth is that our youth was a carpet laid with stones

[Refrain]

[Chorus]

Goodbye Motherfucker
My lover
You had it coming

[Refrain]
