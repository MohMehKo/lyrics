Separate the anxiety [3x]
You know it's mine

Had love come back
Like it was before
House creaking
The hinges on the door
Thoughts creeping

Separating anxiety [4x]
You know it's mine

Say when your mind
Has a mind of its own
Please take mine
Don't leave me alone
Capture me

Separation anxiety [3x]
You know it's mine

I can't let you go
Cause you're a part of me
Not apart from me

You got a song from me
Well, it's good enough for me
I cannot separate from this anxiety

Come home and make our truce
Violence is what we learned
Listen in reverence
Why it can not pass
If you only make us
Then violence is what we learn
How can I separate
From this anxiety?

Closing my eyes
