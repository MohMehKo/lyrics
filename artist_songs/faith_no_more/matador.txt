When your suits took over me
A future shadow
He boasted and sang to me
Farewell, so long

I'll awake you
From this living sleep
We'll walk the shore
Where you were born
In bed with me

Pull the white sheet off your face
March forward my son
A battle beyond frozen years
Only for dogs ears

We will rise
From the killing floor
Like a Matodor (ah ah oooorr!)

A stained glass of bovine eyes
Can see right through
Every tombstone lie

Let us retrace every step
Out of this world, and every ditch

We will be when you will be no more
No more.

Be no more.

Stained glass up a hangman's ass.
We served you well, now we're coming back.

Out of the wait across this ghost
We'll jump the gates
And live to rise. We will rise.

We will rise from the killing floor
Like a Matador.

Let the dead live.
May the dead live.
And the dead live.
What more can we give.
Let the dead live.
May the dead live.
And the dead live.
Dead live.
