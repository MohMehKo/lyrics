And there's so many fish in the sea.
But we could float if that's what you want.
'Cause baby, you seem too good to me.
I don't want to know what life would be.

If you ever wanted to go...

'Cause they're throwing us lemons, and we're squeezing them into our cups.
Woah oh, and drinking it up!
Boy, you've got just what I want
I'm not going a place without your heart... (woah oh)
And girl you're my sun shiny day.
You'd take my life away!

If you ever wanted to go...

We're two peas in a pod.
But we can break out, if that's what you want.

There's too many stars in the sky.
But they can't shine as bright like can you shine!
And I hope that you'll never leave.

'Cause they're throwing us lemons, and we're squeezing them into our cups.
Woah oh, and drinking it up!
Boy, you've got just what I want.
I'm not going a place without you're heart... (woah oh)
And girl you're my sun shiny day.
You'd take my life away!

If you ever wanted to go...

You're the match to my candle.
You're the scrape to my knee.
And you're what makes it better!
Than better could ever be.
Than better could ever be.

Boy you've got just what I want.
I'm not going a place without you're heart...(woah oh)
And girl you're my sun shiny day.
You'd take my life away!

If you ever wanted to go.
