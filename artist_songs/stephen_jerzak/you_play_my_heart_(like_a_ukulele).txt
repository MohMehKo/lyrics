Some say love is just a word
Overused or thrown around
But baby that's not the case with you and me.
Some say we are way too young.
Moving fast
And we know what we're doing
No one could understand at all
I get lost in your eyes
About a million times everyday
So let me say that

You play my heart like a ukulele
And if you get tired
Then you can lay with me
You play my heart like a ukulele
And lately I've been humming along.

Some say love is just a game
And not for us to play
But everyone is different
With you and me
Some say we are so confused
But little do they know
This love is certain

No one could understand at all
I get lost in your eyes
About million times everyday

So let me say that you
Play my heart. Like a ukulele
And if you get tired then you can lay with me
You play my heart like a ukulele
And lately i've been humming along.
You play my heart like a ukulele
And if you get tired then you can lay with me
You play my heart like a ukulele

And if you get tired then
You can lay with me
You play my heart like a ukulele
And lately I've been humming along.
