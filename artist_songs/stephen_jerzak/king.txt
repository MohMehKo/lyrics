I met her at a school dance. 
Her brown hair, oh, it caught my eye. 
And by the spring we were dating, 
After a while it was a waste of time. 

She's just another girl like the others; 
I'm not changing for a thing. 

I'm the king of the world and you're the queen of the brainless. 
Please hang up the phone and we can end this rather painless. 
Yes, I can be cruel, but I know this much is true: 
You can find another me, but I can find a million yous. 

She dyed her hair blond, Made captain of the cheerleading team, 
Hung out with the cool kids, 
Ditched class and broke it off with me. 

She's just another girl like the others;
I'm not changing for a thing. 

I'm the king of the world and you're the queen of the brainless. 
Please hang up the phone and we can end this rather painless. 
Yes, I can be cruel, but I know this much is true: 
You can find another me, but I can find a million yous. 

She's just another fake like the others; 
I've moved onto better things. 
She's just another girl like the others; 
I won't change for anything. 

I'm the king of the world and you're the queen of the brainless.
Please hang up the phone and we can end this rather painless.

You can find another me, but I can find a million yous.
