I saw you in your car
You were on your way to hollywood so you could become beautiful somewhere else
And I never thought a small town girl like you one could pass Wisconsin views
I'll give you a card, if I get around to it, but I'm sure
You're getting sick of it, and I know you're gonna benefit
From every little bit of attention
Get over yourself that's what I said before

I saw you on the TV screen, you always look amazing
And I'll find you on the cover of every magazine
And I know i know today my small town celebrity will make this okay

You've gotten pretty far;
You're a model, you're an actress, you're an idol, and your head isn't getting any smaller
You never want to talk to me anymore I wish it was like it was before
I'm taking the blow and ever since I moved along
Everything I did was wrong
And I've written you a thousand songs but I don't think it means a thing at all to you

I saw you on the TV screen, you always look amazing
And I'll find you on the cover of every magazine
And I know I know today
That my small town celebrity will make this okay

I saw you on the TV screen, you always look amazing
And I'll find you on the cover of every magazine
And I know I know today
That my small town celebrity will make this okay

I saw you on the TV screen, you always look amazing
And I'll find you on the cover of every magazine
And I know I know today
That my small town celebrity will make this okay
