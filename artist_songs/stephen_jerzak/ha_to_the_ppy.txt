I can see your point about breaking up,
I can see your point that you've had enough of me; 
I agree, and obviously you should leave me

I'm sure you'll tell me in a really nice way,
Like taking me to the zoo on a Saturday.
We'll laugh about things to come, 
Where we should have turned right and how we ended up wrong.

And why I could ever get to thinking that you'd be mine.(you'd be mine)
And then we'd sit around and laugh about it one more time.

I'm so happy, it'll drive you crazy.  Medicate me.
Try and bring me down, no it won't work. 
And even if I'd die you know I'd find a joke.

I'm so happy it'll drive you crazy. Medicate me.
Try and make me sad, and you will see.
(even to sing around the people)

Make me happy, happy, happy, happy.
Happy, happy, happy, happy.
Happy, happy, happy, happy.
Happy, happy, happy, happy.
Happy, happy, happy, happy.

I think I've only got about twenty bucks on me,
I'll give it to you girl, so you can go out tonight and take your guy; 
Out and buy a movie ticket.

I've always thought he was a really nice dude,
Kinda like a brother to me shame to lose.

I'll deal with him as my friends, 
Yes he stabbed me in the back;
But that was then.

And how could I ever get thinkin' that you'd be mine (you'd be mine),
And then we'd sit around and laugh about it one more time.

I'm so happy it'll drive you crazy. Medicate me.
Try and bring me down, no it wont work. 
And even if I'd die you know I'd find a joke.

I'm so happy it'll drive you crazy. Medicate me.
Try and make me sad, and you will see, 
(even to sing around the people)

Make me happy, happy, happy, happy.
Happy, happy, happy, happy.
Happy, happy, happy, happy.
Happy, happy, happy, happy.
Happy, happy, happy, happy.

I've got better things to think about.
Life's too short to sit and pout.
I've got a feeling without a doubt,
I'm happy, happy, happy, happy.

You'll always see me smilin',
You'll never see me worrying.
As long as I'm with the grass, that's green.
I'm happy, happy, happy, happy.

(I'm so happy I'll drive you crazy.)

I'm so happy, it'll drive you crazy. Medicate me.
Try and bring me down no it wont work.
And even if I die, you know I'd find a joke.

I'm so happy, it'll drive you crazy. Medicate me.
Try and make me sad, and you will see.
(even to sing around the people)

Make me happy, happy, happy, happy.
Happy, happy, happy, happy.
Happy, happy, happy, happy.
Happy, happy, happy, happy.
(Happy, happy, happy, happy.)
Happy, happy, happy, happy.
