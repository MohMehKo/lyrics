(Peace out, peace out.)

If you have nothing good to say, then don't you say a thing
'Cause I don't have the time to listen now.
You're a frenzy of distaste, an endless string of bad days
I don't need you ruin my motivation.

(Hey, hey, hey, ay, ay)
Stop putting me down,
You could probably learn from what I have to
(Say, ay, ay, ay, ay)
Let's turn it around.

All the haters, peace out. (whoa! )
All you lovers, get down. (whoa! )
All the haters, peace out. (whoa! )
All you lovers, let's bounce, bounce up and down.

You only got good things to say
And don't think that we couldn't take all of the hate and make it into
Better things.
And when all is said and done,
The world could love without anybody criticizing or fighting it.

(Hey, hey, hey, ay, ay)
I'm feeling great, we could probably use more people like you nowadays.
(Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay)
Here's what I have to say:

All the haters, peace out. (whoa! )
All you lovers, get down. (whoa! )
All the haters, peace out. (whoa! )
All you lovers, let's bounce, bounce up and down.

All the haters, peace out. (whoa! )
All you lovers, get down. (whoa! )
All the haters, peace out. (whoa! )
All you lovers, let's bounce, bounce up and down.

Catch you later!
All you lovers get up and bounce, bounce, bounce around.
Catch you later!
All the haters, get out now.

All the haters, peace out. (whoa! )
All you lovers, get down. (whoa! )
All the haters, peace out. (whoa! )
All you lovers, let's bounce.

All the haters, peace out. (whoa! )
All you lovers, get down. (whoa! )
All the haters, peace out. (whoa! )
All you lovers, let's bounce, bounce up and down. [x2]

(Peace out.) [x4]
