Going hot, so hot, just like an oven
And I'll burn myself, but just had to touch it
But it's so fine and it's all mine

They might learn something
She ain't nothing but a little doozie when she does it
She's so fine tonight

I'ma leave it all on the floor tonight
And you got fixed up to the nines
Let me show you a few things
All pressed up in black and white
And you're dressed in that dress I like
Love is swinging in the air tonight
Let me show you a few things

Show you a few things about love
Now we're in the swing of love

And aww, shit's so sick, got a hit and picked up a habit
But that's alright, cause you're all mine

I guess they're just mad cause girl, they wish they had it
Oh, my killer, my thriller, yeah, you're a classic
And you're all mine tonight
