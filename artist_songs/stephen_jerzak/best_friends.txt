I met you way back when and even then you were a friend to me
Whenever I fell down you came and picked me off the ground
Thanks for always having my back

And now you and me are a hopin' and a prayin'
That even though when I'm away
That every little feeling will always stay the same

I know that if it's really meant to be
Then baby, we don't need to worry at all
La, la, la

Some of your old friends never thought that I was ever that great
But still you never cared what any one of them had to say
'Cause no one knows me like you do
(I'm happy, I'm best friends with you)

Every time I talk to you I can't help but to show my teeth
I wish I had the time and space to tell you in this song
How super duper awesome that you really are

And now you and me, are a hopin' and a prayin'
That even though when I'm away
That every little feeling will always stay the same

I know that if it's really meant to be
Then baby, we don't need to worry at all
La, la, la

Some of your old friends never thought that I was ever that great
But still you never cared what any one of them had to say
'Cause no one knows me like you do
(I'm happy, I'm best friends with you)

Well, I took you to my high school dance
And I'm glad we had the chance
But I wish it would've been the Sadie Hawkins dance
'Cause you look sexy in a cowboy hat
(Whoa)

And now you and me are a hopin' and a prayin'
That even though when I'm away
That every little feeling will always stay the same

I know, that if it's really meant to be
Then baby, we don't need to worry at all
La, la, la

Some of your old friends never thought that I was ever that great
But still you never cared what any one of them had to say
'Cause no one knows me like you do
(Oh)

Some of your old friends never thought that I was ever that great
But still you never cared what any one of them had to say
'Cause no one knows me like you do
(Oh)
(I'm happy, I'm best friends with you)
