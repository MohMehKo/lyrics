She's got a way
Walks, talks, like she's unafraid
Blue, blond, royalty and fame
She's got all of it in spades

She's got a way
With all the games and boys she's ever played
With all the rules she decided to bend and break
Given the chance she'd do it all again
(and again) [x4]

(Ahh) Kill the Queen for the crown everybody

[Chorus:]
Oh! She wants the throne
(she wants the throne)
Oh! She wants control
(Kill the Queen for the crown everybody)
I guess princess wasn't enough
Heart's like doves, she's the Queen of the clubs
Oh! She wants control

(Kill the Queen for the crown everybody)

She's unaware
Of all the girls waiting to fill her chair
Jealousy and gossip fill the air
She's playing solitaire

They never told her
Keep looking over your shoulder
Keep friends close and enemies closer
After all...

(Ahh) Kill the Queen for the crown everybody

[Chorus:]
Oh! She wants the throne
(she wants the throne)
Oh! She wants control
(Kill the Queen for the crown everybody)
I guess princess wasn't enough
Heart's like doves, she's the Queen of the clubs
Oh! She wants control

(Kill the Queen for the crown everybody)

Locked up in the V.I.P.
Behind the velvet rope
Show me I.D.

Locked up in the V.I.P.
Behind the velvet rope
Don't need I.D.

(Ahh) Kill the Queen for the crown everybody

[Chorus:]
Oh! She wants the throne
(she wants the throne)
Oh! She wants control
(Kill the Queen for the crown everybody)
I guess princess wasn't enough
Heart's like doves, she's the Queen of the clubs
Oh! She wants control

(Kill the Queen for the crown everybody) [x2]
