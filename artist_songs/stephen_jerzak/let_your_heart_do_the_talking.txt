Most of the time, I really don't know what to say
If you're walkin' my way (my way)
Hey, pretty girl, I'm not too sure of what you're lookin' for
But baby, baby, I can give you something that you won't believe.

My heart can take control of me
And when it does, just wait and see.
Usually, I really don't know
But with you, I do.

Sometimes, I let my heart do the talking
And right now, it's tellin' me to say that
You are all I think about
And I need you to hear me out 'cause
Sometimes, I let my heart do the thinking,
And it thinks that you're pretty amazing
You are all I dream about
And I need you to hear me out now.

What would it take for me to make you even consider
Goin' out with me? (Goin' out with me)
I'm well-aware that it's not easy to please you
But darling, darling, I would do anything you need.

My heart can take control of me
And when it does, just wait and see.
Usually, I really don't know
But with you, I do.

Sometimes, I let my heart do the talking
And right now, it's tellin' me to say that
You are all I think about
And I need you to hear me out 'cause
Sometimes, I let my heart do the thinking,
And it thinks that you're pretty amazing
You are all I dream about
And I need you to hear me out now.

Just let your heart do the talking.
Just let your heart do the thinking.

Sometimes, I let my heart do the talking
And right now, it's tellin' me to say that
You are all I think about
And I need you to hear me out 'cause
Sometimes, I let my heart do the thinking,
And it thinks that you're pretty amazing
You are all I dream about
And I need you to hear me out now.
