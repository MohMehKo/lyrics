She says she's got him,
And I said, "We've got to work this out."
And I say if you don't know,
Then let's rewind and talk this over now.

'Cause you've got me all wrong,
You've got me all wrong, tonight.
We're moving up, just take you time;
Slow things down and we'll be fine.
Just breathe in so it seems,
Nothin' like me.

I'll take you where you want to,
The Time Square lights and Paris nights.
The stunning sights that we both dream;
It's you and me, girl.
I'll show you things you've never seen before.
I'm all you want and then some more;
I'm all you want and then some more.

She's got her eyes closed,
And I never thought we'd work this out.
Every time I see her, it makes me want leave her;
And everyone around her just makes it harder now.

'Cause you've got me all wrong!
You've had me all wrong for so long.
The places that we go are higher,
It's hard to see it all!
Just breathe in so it seems,
It's nothin' like me.

I'll take you where you want to,
The Time Square lights and Paris nights.
The stunning sights that we both dream;
It's you and me, girl.
I'll show you things you've never seen before.
I'm all you want and then some more;
I'm all you want and then some more.

I'm so sick of wasting,
All my time with you!
Time Square's waiting;
I'm so sick of wasting, all my time with you!
