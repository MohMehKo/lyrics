Have you ever sailed across the sea
On your big flat sceen tv?
Well if you're into all that
Then maybe I should take you there with me

See the world with your own two eyes
Then maybe you could gaze into mine
We'll end up making a bunch of discoveries
But the best one would be
That you were meant for me from the start

I'll take a shooting star righ out the sky
And Wrap it up to you, from...

I need to get a passport
So maybe you can meet me at the airport
And get a way from the normal day
We're flying staight down to Jamaica

I need to get a passport
So maybe you can meet me at the airport
Cause I don't want to leave
Without you next to me girl

Will we ever get enough of this?
Pick a place check it off the list
As a matter of fact
We'll probably be running out of places to go before we run of time

We could throw our phones away
Because we woudn't have any service anyway
Cause nothing really matters out here exept that you're near me
So let's keep going

I'll take a shooting star righ out the sky
And Wrap it up to you, from...

I need to get a passport
So maybe you can meet me at the airport
And get a way from the normal day
We're flying staight down to Jamaica

I need to get a passport
So maybe you can meet me at the airport
Cause I don't want to leave
Without you next to me girl

Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do

Oh far away from everything we know
How to get there just let it go
Anywhere you wanna be

Cause everyday is a holiday with me

I got myself a passport
And baby you met me at the airport
Let's get away from it all tonight
Flying straight down to the islands

I got myself a passport
And baby you met me at the airport
I'm glad I didn't leave without you next to me

Girl let's get away from it all tonight
Flying straight down to the islands

Girl I'm glad I didn't leave with out you next to me
Girl
