Somewhere in the sky, know the sun is hiding
And I'll never find it without you.
Hey, hey sunshine, you're so golden,
Let me feel you.
It's worth it to wait a while,
so I can look at your smile
Because it shines for miles and miles.

I fell asleep, but I didn't dream.
I thought the day would come sooner than later,
But I'm still here in the same old place.

There's a west coast beach scene in my head
And I want to fly away from this midwestern state and be there instead.

Somewhere in the sky, know the sun is hiding
And I'll never find it without you.
Hey, hey sunshine, you're so golden,
Let me feel you.
It's worth it to wait a while,
so I can look at your smile
Because it shines for miles and miles.
Miles and miles.

I stayed awake to find my place.
I dream the day will come sooner than later
Where you and I will be face-to-face.

There's a west coast beach scene in my head
And I want to fly away from this midwestern state and be there instead.

Somewhere in the sky, know the sun is hiding
And I'll never find it without you.
Hey, hey sunshine, you're so golden,
Let me feel you.
It's worth it to wait a while,
so I can look at your smile
Because it shines for miles and miles.

Miles and miles.

Somewhere in the sky, know the sun is hiding
And I'll never find it without you.
Hey, hey sunshine, you're so golden,
Let me feel you.
It's worth it to wait a while,
so I can look at your smile
because it shines for miles and miles.

Somewhere in the sky, know the sun is hiding
And I'll never find it without you.
Hey, hey sunshine, you're so golden,
Let me feel you. (Let me feel you.)
It's worth it to wait a while,
so I can look at your smile
(your smile, your smile, your smile)
Shines for a million miles.
