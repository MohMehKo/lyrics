grab a drink dancin' under flashin' lights
she's a queen but she won't put up a fight
everybody knows that she's a looker but she ain't quite right
so I lie through my teeth again

been around see I think I know the type
honesty is not the policy she likes
choice words spoken to her in the heat of night
so I lie through my teeth again

oo boy would you mind if I got closer
oo boy I can tell you want me don't ya
And I say why do you think that a wink can get you anything you ask for out on the dance floor

she said
oo do you love me
i wonder why she talks like that
oo Tell me something
tell me how'd you get to be so bad
hey I know something you don't
let's go
we can go wherever you want to go
how would you feel if I told ya

you ain't worth the trouble

it's hard to think dancin' under flashin' lights
your touchin' me tellin' me I'm just her type
and everyones tellin' me that she's the hollywood hype so tonight I'm gonna lie through my teeth again

oo boy would you mind if I got closer
oo boy I can tell you want me don't ya
and I say why do you think that a wink can get you anything you ask for out on the dance floor

she said
oo do you love me
i wonder why she talks like that
oo tell me something
tell me how'd you get to be so bad
hey I know something you dont
we can go wherever you want to go
how would you feel if I told ya

she's lookin' at me but I know that she don't see
i couldnt love her when there so many others
blowin' kisses at me but she aims too high
how could I love her when there's so many others

shes lookin' at me but I know that she don't see
i couldn't love her when there so many others
blowin' kisses at me but she aims too high
how could I love her when there's so many others

she said
oo do you love me
i wonder why she talks like that
oo tell me something
tell me how'd you get to be so bad
hey I know something you don't
let's go
we can go wherever you want to go

how would you feel if I told ya
let's go
how would you feel if I told ya
dance floor
how would you feel if I told ya
let's go
we can go wherever you want to go
how would you feel if I told ya

you ain't worth the trouble
