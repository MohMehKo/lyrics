If you wanna hula dance with me,
Then I could do anything
'Cause you + me add up perfectly.

I'm up in a coconut tree
And I'm lookin' for something to do when I wish you were up here with me
So that I could be K-I-S-S-I-N-G.

First comes love, but it already happened...

There's plenty of fish in the sea,
But I would never go swimming alone
So how about you come with me?
And maybe we'll be happier than the rest of the sea.

First comes love... Yeah, it already happened...

If you wanna hula dance with me,
Then I could do anything
'Cause you + me add up perfectly.

So you're layin' out on the beach
And you're catchin' some rays in a way that I haven't seen it before
'Cause a body like yours is so hard to ignore.

The sun is love, but it has competition.

I'll write you a message and then I can put it in a bottle
And hope it finds its way to you
'Cause you need to know everything I'm feelin'.

If you wanna hula dance with me,
Then I could do anything
'Cause you + me add up perfectly.

Come on, put on your hula skirt for me
And let me have this dance, girl, what do ya say?
My eyes, you know they've only been surfin' on you for a while now.

So baby, please hula dance with me.
Then I could do anything
'Cause you + me add up perfectly.
