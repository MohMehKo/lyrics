This is the first time that I've cried in a while
'Cause everything's okay, 'cause everything's okay
This is the first time that I've smiled in a while
'Cause everything's okay, 'cause everything's okay

I thought it was over, but then I remembered
That love lasts forever and we'll be together
Two days without you not thinking about you
That's too much to ask from me

It's the way that we lie in the sand
(Slips right through my hands like you)
And the way that the sun makes your silhouette
And the chances that I had to make you smile
They aren't coming around

This is the first time that you've called in a while
Is everything okay, is everything okay?
This is the first time that you've cried in a while
Is everything okay, is everything okay?

I know it's confusing, but nothing worth losing
I'm sick of refusing and I'm sick of you saying
Two days without you not thinking about you
It's too much to ask from me

It's the way that we lie in the sand
(Slips right through my hands like you do)
And the way that the sun makes your silhouette
And the chances that I had to make you smile

They aren't coming around
Not coming around
Not coming around
Not coming around
Not coming around

It's the way that we lie in the sand
(Slips right through my hands)
And the way that the sun makes your silhouette
And the chances that I have to make you smile
They're not coming around
Now I'm alone
