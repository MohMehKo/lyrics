You are on the top of my list of things to do
Oh wait, that's not what I meant to say
I'm sorry, please forgive me
There I go again saying the wrong thing

You are the amazing, incredible, wonderful type
And I am just another boy in your eyes
Oh well, I guess I'll have to settle for something less
I wish I had what it takes to make her my own

She's a pretty pretty girl if you ask me
And I really, really, really, really want her to be with me
I hope she knows who I am, if not I'll show her around
She's a pretty girl and I'm pretty in love with her

You are on the top of your game when it comes to this
And I don't wanna lack the confidence but that's just who I am
I hope I find some way to tell you

That you are the prettiest girl in the universe
Oh wait, the universe isn't big enough for me to explain
The way your face could brighten up anybody's day
I wish I had what it takes to make her my own

She's a pretty pretty girl if you ask me
And I really, really, really, really want her to be with me
I hope she knows who I am, if not I'll show her around
She's a pretty girl and I'm pretty in love with her

She's a pretty pretty girl if you ask me
And I really, really, really, really want her to be with me
I hope she knows who I am, if not I'll show her around
She's a pretty girl and I'm pretty in love with her

I'm really feelin' like I'm starting to pull myself together
So maybe I will be able to hold a normal conversation
I'm really feelin' like I'm finally knowing what to say
In situations where you look at me and steal my breath away

She's a pretty pretty girl if you ask me
And I really, really, really, really want her to be with me
I hope she knows who I am, if not I'll show her around
She's a pretty girl and I'm pretty in love with her

She's a pretty pretty girl if you ask me
And I really, really, really, really want her to be with me
I hope she knows who I am, if not I'll show her around
She's a pretty girl and I'm pretty in love with her

Yeah, I'm pretty in love with her

I'm so in love with her
