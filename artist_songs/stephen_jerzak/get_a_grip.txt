[*ahem*]
Wait a second, let's count this off:
1, 2, 3!
Let's go!

[musical break]

Slow down!
I got another question for you:
How in the hell do youfind all the perfect things to say to me when I didn't want you anymore?
C'mon! I'm always waiting.
C'mon! C'mon! Listen to me (listen to me!)

I know I'm just a little tired, but
That won't, stop me from waking up!
I know I'm growing a little anxious, but
That won't, stop me from waking up!

Why can't you see that I deserve something better?
How in the hell do you lose everything I taught you?
And everything we've been through. (C'mon)
C'mon, I'm always waiting. (always waiting)
C'mon! C'mon! Listen to me, oh. (listen to me!)

I know I'm just a little tired, but
That won't, stop me from waking up!
I know I'm growing a little anxious, but
That won't, stop me from waking up!

Dim the lights down low,
Crank the speakers up, whoa.
Dim the lights down low,
Crank the speakers up, whoa.
And get a grip of the beat, start movin'!
Dim the lights down low,
And crank the speakers up, whoa.
Get a grip of the beat and start movin'! (whoa, whoa)
Dim the lights down low,
And crank the speakers up, whoa.
Get a grip of the beat, we'll start movin'.

I know I'm just a little tired, but
That won't, stop me from waking up!
I know I'm growing a little anxious, but
That won't, stop me from waking up!

Y'all know what time it is...
