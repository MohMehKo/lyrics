I'm t t tickin like a timebomb baby baby
when you told me to forget you I went crazy
but now I'm here and I doubt you'll see me standing still
cuz I'm waitng for the time

and you've become a mess

and build back up
to what you used to be

I'm t t tickin like a timebomb baby baby
but when you told me to forget you i went crazy
but now I'm here and I doubt you'll see me standing still
