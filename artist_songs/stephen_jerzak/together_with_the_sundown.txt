I don't even know
I've never felt this way before
No, it's someone like you
That makes sense

And I don't wanna go
I'll stay with you forever
As long as you love me, too
Just as long as you love me, too

It's the way that you talk
And the way that you smile
And the way that you love in black and white
Baby, it's the way you hold my hand in the car
And the way that we lie in the sand

It's not hard to see
That a single day without you
Can make me go crazy

It takes my breath away
It gets me butterflies
When you hold me in your sleep
When you hold me in your sleep
I never want to leave

It's the way that you talk
And the way that you smile
And the way that you love in black and white
Baby, it's the way you hold my hand in the car
And the way that we lie in the sand
And I watch the sun go down

Whoa, oh oh

It's the way that you talk
And the way that you smile
And the way that you love in black white
Baby, it's the way you hold my hand in the car
And the way that we lie in the sand
And we watch the sun go down

"Hey, baby, it's me, and I was just calling to say how much I miss you and I can't stop thinking about you. Every morning when I wake up, you're the first thing that comes to my mind, and I'll give anything to have you by my side. Just remember that I love you and nothing can stand in the way of that. Call me back when you get a chance. Bye."
