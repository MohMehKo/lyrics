1, 2, 3, 4!

You're a dime a dozen, but I'm just about as broke as a joke.
But I'm gonna try to make you miserable.
Can't you see that I'm the one lookin' for the right things to say?
But baby, they can't find their way to me.

Whoa-oh-OH-oh-whoa-oh...
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh...
Whoa-oh-OH-oh-whoa-oh...
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh...

So, I can't find the right words to say
But maybe a melody will find its way before, they do;
I 'd rather sing to you, oh.
And all of your friends, and all the time I spend alone...
I try to sleep and anxiously, I'm waiting for tonight to be over, over, over.
And every time I see you in my dreams, it makes me squeeze my pillow, tighter, tighter.

You're a dime a dozen, and you're pretty good at cutting it close,
But I'm gonna try to make you know this song,
To all your friends, and all the time I that spend alone.
I try to sleep and anxiously, I'm waiting for tonight to be over, over, over.
And every time I see you in my dreams, it makes me squeeze my pillow, tighter, tighter.

Whoa-oh-OH-oh-whoa-oh...
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh...
Whoa-oh-OH-oh-whoa-oh...
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh...

You're a dime a dozen, but I'm just about as broke as a joke.
