There's footprints in the snow that lead
Directly to my door.
I don't recall you coming over,
This year at all.
I wish I didn't miss you so that
I could finally kiss you under the mistletoe.

There's gotta be a way that I can see you...
There's gotta be just something I can do...

I wonder if I could borrow Santa's sleigh
And fly around the world,
So I could pick you up in time for us to be
Together again on Christmas day.
Baby, I believe that we were meant to be that way.

A Christmas card from me to you is on its way to get to you-
I hope it comes in time for the holidays.
There's a candy cane and a little note inside
But don't laugh, I used a heart to dot my i's
Just 'cause I know you think it's cute.

There's gotta be a way for me to see you...
There's gotta be just one thing I can do...

I wonder if I could borrow Santa's sleigh
And fly around the world,
So I could pick you up in time for us to be
Together again on Christmas day.
Baby, I believe that we were meant to be that way.

There's gotta be a way that I can see you...
There's gotta be just something I can do...
There's gotta be a way that I can see you...
There's gotta be a way that I can see you!

I wonder if I could borrow Santa's sleigh
And fly around the world...

I wonder if I could borrow Santa's sleigh
And fly around the world,
So I could pick you up in time for us to be
Together again on Christmas day.
Baby, I believe that we were meant to be that way.
