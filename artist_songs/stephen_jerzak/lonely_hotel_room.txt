You are, so far, from me.
Lately, I've been losing sleep.
Without you here in bed,
I'll have to dream of you instead.

When I'm away,
It's hard to make it through.
'Cause my head is in the clouds and my heart is there with you.
It's never been easy,
But I know this much is true;
And there's nothing I can do.
'Cause my head is in the clouds and my heart is there with you.

My pillow,
Smells like your perfume.
It's the only thing I have of you to
Bring inside this lonely hotel room.

Without you by my side,
I'll have to dream of you tonight.

When I'm away,
It's hard to make it through.
'Cause my head is in the clouds and my heart is there with you.
It's never been easy,
But I know this much is true;
And there's nothing I can do...
When my head is in the clouds and my heart is there with you.

[musical break]

Everything reminds me of you;
It's the only thing pulling me through.
Like the picture of us that comes up when you call me to say "Good night."

When I'm away,
It's hard to make it through.
'Cause my head is in the clouds and my heart is there with you.
It's never been easy,
But I know this much is true;
And there's nothing I can do.
'Cause my head is in the clouds and my heart is there with you.

When I'm away,
It's hard to make it through.
'Cause my head is in the clouds and my heart is there with you.
It's never been easy,
But I know this much is true;
And there's nothing I can do.
'Cause my head is in the clouds and my heart is there with you.
