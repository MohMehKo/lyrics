Baby, I know you're asleep
But I have to let you know
That I'll be here
When you need someone to talk to
And when I look into your eyes
My heart skips a beat

I've made up my mind,
Baby, anchor's away
I wanna stay here with you
Baby, right on the coast of California

Cause when you're by my side
I feel like I can fly
I'm sick of wasting time
I need to make you mine
I need to make you mine

Baby, I'll call you tonight
Cause when I hear your voice
Softly, talk me to sleep
I know I made the right choice
And when I see you with a smile
I get butterflies
I've made up my mind,
Baby, anchor's away
I wanna stay here with you
Baby, right on the coast of California

Cause when you're by my side
I feel like I can fly
I'm sick of wasting time
I need to make you mine
I need to make you mine

Anchor's away
I wanna stay here with you
Baby, right on the coast of California

Cause when you're by my side
I feel like I can fly
I'm sick of wasting time
I need to make you mine
I need to make you mine
