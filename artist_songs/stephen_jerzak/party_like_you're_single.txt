(Party like you're single) [x2]

Make you're best-dressed,
But not too over-done.
Winterfresh breath,
We're gonna live it up.
Do what you like, even if it's just for the night.
Party until we see the sun. (the sun)

Let's go out, 'cause we're all feeling it.
Leave life behind, no need to deal with it.
Do what you like, even if it's just for the night.
Party until we see the sun.

This isn't a slow dance, so put up your hands
It's our last chance to party.
This isn't a slow dance, so put up your hands
Put up your hands and party like you're single. (You're single, single)
Party like you're single. (You're single, single)
Party like you're single. (You're single, single)
Party like you're single.
Party like you're single.

Open invites- anyone can come
We're on the guest list- everyone plus one.
You never know, once you get in the zone,
Where the night's gonna go.

Let's go out, 'cause we're all feeling it.
Leave life behind, no need to deal with it.
Do what you like, even if it's just for the night.
Party until we see the sun.

This isn't a slow dance, so put up your hands
It's our last chance to party.
This isn't a slow dance, so put up your hands
Put up your hands and party like you're single. (You're single, single)
Party like you're single. (You're single, single)
Party like you're single. (You're single, single)
Party like you're single. (You're single, single)
Party like you're single.

I think I'm gonna pass out
My number.
I think I'm gonna black out
The lights.
Tonight, I'm not lookin' for a lover, whoa.
Not lookin' for a lover.
(You're single, single)
(Slow dance, so put up your hands)
(Party like you're single)
(Last chance to party)

This isn't a slow dance, so put up your hands
It's our last chance to party.
This isn't a slow dance, so put up your hands
Put up your hands and party like you're single.

(Put up your hands)
Party like you're single. [x6]
