Your eyes are blue like the ocean,
And baby I'm lost out at sea.
Did the sun just come out or did you smile at me?
I've been trying to ask you but I can't seem to speak.
Was it love at first sight? 'cause I walked by last week.

I'm singing Fa la la la la...

Your lips look so lonely,
Would they like to meet mine?
You are the one that I've been hoping to find.
You're so sweet that you put Hershey's out of business.
Can I have a photograph to show my friends that
Angels truly exist?

I'm singing Fa la la la la...

You're as cute as a button
The things you do sure are something
Are you running out of breath
From running through my head, all night?

Is there something in your eye?
Oh wait, it's just a sparkle.
Can you get a little closer
And help me out a little bit?
Because I scraped my knee fallin' for you.
But baby a kiss will do.

I'm singing Fa la la la la la...

You're as cute as a button.
The things you do sure are something.
Are you running out of breath
From running through my head, all night?

I'm falling in love,
And wouldn't I like to think so.
And every night I look at the stars out my window.
And I hope I can see the one that we saw together.
It was just you and me and honestly,
I'll look for that star forever.
