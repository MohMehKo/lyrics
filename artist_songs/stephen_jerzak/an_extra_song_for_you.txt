I thought you said you'd call by noon
I've been waiting on you and it's all I can do
cause you're always doing something with somebody else
I think the last time that you penciled me in was the night before I saw you dance
you're like a flower in the wind
you're about as graceful as my friend
her hair is almost like the morning breeze on a sunshiny day and it talks with a way without the words that I normally say when I'm stumbling
oo oo oo

last night I tried to picture your beautiful face
but I only saw you frowning, darling
gotta find a way to put a smile on you
yes I will
and I'll wrap myself around your tree
on the side of your house
and I'll climb it, I'll climb it
til I could reach your balcony
and I'll jump across the sky cause I think I can fly
and I'm flying, I'm flying away

so tell me
what you've been hiding
cause all I wanna know is how I can sleep without me
hearing you sing in the shower at night
that's probably one of the things that you do that keeps my mind off all the pictures of you

when you laugh
and your cheeks turn rosy
when you smile
and you scrunch your nose
when you breathe
and the sunshine is shining on you

and I never knew a thing about you
but I gave it a shot and I never knew not to say that it's a beautiful day when you're around and now I think that I have found the one and it's you
and the last thing on my mind
is you deciding that you're going a different direction
the connection we have was to heaven and back
but the things that I lack, like personality, when you're sitting next to me

so tell me
what you've been hiding
cause all I wanna know is how I can sleep without me
hearing you sing in the shower at night
that's probably one of the things that you do that keeps my mind off all the pictures of you

when you laugh
and your cheeks turn rosy
when you smile
and you scrunch your nose
when you breathe
and the sunshine is shining on you
when you hair's blowing in the wind
when your eyes started listening
when you talk
I start listening to you
to you, to you
