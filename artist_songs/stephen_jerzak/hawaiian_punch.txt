I got a bottle of Malibu
I know you like it a bunch
So baby, put a little bit in your Hawaiian Punch
It’ll make you feel so good,
Just like I do with you!

Got a basket full of,
Diamond rings,
So you can pick and choose.
Cause’ baby, you’re the girl that
I would never wanna lose.
You make me feel so good,
Make me feel so wonderful.

Girl, my Ukulele has a crush on you
And it makes me write these songs.
This whole CD’s about you.
I hope I don’t go wrong.
Cause’ it’s easy to fall in love,
And it’s easy to make it strong,
And it’s easy to sing-a-long

I got another bottle of Malibu
I know you like it a bunch
And another jug of your favorite Hawaiian Punch,
Just in case you ran out of it all.

I got a body full of blues, baby girl,
Cause’ you must’ve forgot
That we were supposed to meet up
Around 11 o’clock
But you know me,
I’ll be waiting for your call

Girl, my Ukulele has a crush on you
And it makes me write these songs.
This whole CD’s about you.
I hope I don’t go wrong.
Cause’ it’s easy to fall in love,
And it’s easy to make it strong,
And it’s easy to sing-a-long
