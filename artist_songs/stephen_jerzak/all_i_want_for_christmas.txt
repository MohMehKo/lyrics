The Christmas lights around your house are fading.
I've walked so far from home to here that, I don't know what to say.
I've tried so hard to wait for this, but I'm finally giving up.
This Christmas, I'm doing something right.

I know I'm getting old for this, but tonight,
I'll write a Christmas list.
And hopefully, you'll read it.
I haven't been too good this year,
But does that mean Christmas should disappear?
And if it does, will you still be here?

We could sit by the fire and let it snow (outside)
I would give you my blanket and wrap you up, tight.
'Cause all I want for Christmas is for you, to be happy.

I remember last year, we just couldn't get enough
Of the snowy weather and I remember- it was last December.
And then you walked away.
It'll never be the same.

We could sit by the fire and let it snow (outside)
I would give you my blanket and wrap you up, tight.
'Cause all I want for Christmas is for you, to be happy.

We would sit by the fire and let it snow (outside)
I would give you my blanket and (wrap you up)
We would sit by the fire and let it snow (outside)
I would give you my blanket and wrap you up, tight.
'Cause all I want for Christmas is for you, to be happy... with him.
