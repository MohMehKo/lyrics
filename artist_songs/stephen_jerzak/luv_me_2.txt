We're growing out of it
and we've all learned the same thing.
That time is sensitive
and it shouldn't go two ways.
But getting treated like you're nothing important is
something you dont quite understand.
But I could clear it up if you take my hand
and sing along with me now.

Ohhh oh oh ohhh oh oh! ohhhh ohhhhh

What do I need to do to get to your heart
I'll let you pick me apart and take me back to the start (tell me)
What do I need to do to see through your eyes
Baby you will realize that I'm not like all the other guys.

Ohhhh
What do I need to do.
Ohhhh
I want to be with you.
(Ohhhh)
What do I need to do.
(Ohhhh)
To make you luv me 2

We're going out of it.
But not enough to collect a list of memories
you always seem to forget.
Let's take a hit and throw away from it all instead.
But don't pretend that you don't understand
But I could pick you up and you could take my hand
and sing along with me now.

Ohhh oh oh ohhh oh ohhhhhh oh oh ohhhhh oh!

What do I need to do to get to your heart.
I'll let you pick me apart and take me back to the start (tell me)
What do I need to do to see through your eyes
Baby you will realize that I'm not like all the other guys.
Ohhh

What do I need to do.
Ohhh
I want to be with you.
Ohhhh
What do I need to do.
Ohhhh
To make you luv me 2

Ohhhh oh oh ohhhhh oh! Ohhhhh oh oh ohhh oh!

Sing with me too now!

What do I need to do to get to your heart.
I'll let you pick me apart and take me back to the start (tell me)
What do I need to do to see through your eyes
Baby you will realize that I'm not like all the other guys.

What do I need to do to get to your heart.
