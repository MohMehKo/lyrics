Hey you,
you're a pretty girl
cuz you're pretty artificial
and i wish there was enough of you to come around
my way
but i lost that chance with you.

Hey you
you turn the night on for me
but i know behind it
oh you're so uneasy
here,so speak up 
and tell me what is real

[chorus:]
I heard you party on the weekends,
they say you got a reputation
You're a party girl,
you're nothing like the party girl

And then i saw you on the weekend,
you were the center of attention
I'm sorry girl you're nothing but a party girl

Hey girl who's your flavor of the week this time
oh it must be pretty nice
but i wouldn't be surprised if sweet turned into sour

Hey girl do you remember
back when we were only this tall,
and so big we were so small
What happened to that passionate girl
that swore to me
wouldn't become part of a sorority (:

[chorus:]
I heard you party on the weekends,
they say you got a reputation
You're a party girl,
you're nothing like the party girl

And then i saw you on the weekend,
you were the center of attention
I'm sorry girl you're nothing but a party girl

She's a drama queeen 
she talks to him,
he talks to me 
about the times the things he said she said to him about me
I'm over honesty 
but i wonder what he says about me back to you
and if its even true

She's a drama queen
and i cant believe that she would talk about me
and never to me
I'm all for dignity 
but I'm almost happy that she hates me

[chorus:]
I heard you party on the weekends,
they say you got a reputation
You're a party girl,
you're nothing like the party girl

And then i saw you on the weekend,
you were the center of attention
I'm sorry girl you're nothing but a party girl.
