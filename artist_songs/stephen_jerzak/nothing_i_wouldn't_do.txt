My days aren't the same
Unless I get to see your smile
And all those little things
That you do when I'm around
I could prove to you
That there's nothing I won't do

I'd use the moon just like a spotlight on your eyes
And show the world that you're the center of my life
'Cause look at you in all
You're perfect

Love anything you ask me
It's true
There's nothing I wouldn't do
Nothing I wouldn't do

I won't let you go
'Cause you're my parachute
And I've been falling harder than you know
So close your eyes and listen closely
I will prove to you
That there's nothing I won't do

I'd use the moon just like a spotlight on your eyes
And show the world that you're the center of my life
'Cause look at you in all
You're perfect

Love anything you ask me
It's true
There's nothing I wouldn't do
Nothing I wouldn't do

I'd use the moon just like a spotlight on your eyes
And show the world that you're the center of my life
Yeah
'Cause look at you in all
you're perfect

Love anything you ask me
It's true
There's nothing I wouldn't do
Nothing I wouldn't do
Nothing I wouldn't do
For you
