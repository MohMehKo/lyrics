She swept me off my feet when she said yes
And I told myself to think of a reason
How I got to her so easily
Now I need some time to get it together
Cause if I play it right this might be forever
Now's the time to make it worth her while

I was so sure of it, I thought she was the one
But she stood me up, and let me down
Now I'm right here all by myself
What ever happened to our night alone
Not gonna waste my time anymore

She asked my if my weekend was free
I told her I would love to maybe, 
Hmmm...
I might as well give he a chance (another chance)
So I drove up to her house in the vally
I called her but her phone was busy
Wow, looks like tonight's not happening (not happening)

I was so sure of it, I thought she was the one
But she stood me up, and let me down
Now I'm right here all by myself
What ever happened to our night alone
Not gonna waste my time anymore

Cause she stood me up, and let me down
Now I'm right here all by myself
What ever happened to our night alone
Not gonna waste my time anymore

I thought I found a girl who wasn't just messing around
And I just want to let you know that you're through with breaking me down
And all I wanted to do was get to know you a little bit better
But you stood me up

I thought I found a girl who wasn't fucking with me
I wish I wouldn't have taken everything so seriously
But what's done is done
And I am sure, you're not the one

But she stood me up, and let me down
Now I'm right here all by myself
What ever happened to our night alone
Not gonna waste my time anymore (stood me up)

But she stood me up and let me down (let me down)
Now I'm right here all by myself (by myself)
What ever happened to our night alone (our night alone)
Not gonna waste my time anymore
