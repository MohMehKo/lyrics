You took a piece of my heart and you gave it away
You had me right from the start cause I thought you were going to stay
And I should have taken the chance but you left way too fast

And I was lucky to get the time of day from you
And it's such a shame to see a view like this
Without us laying in the grass, in the sunshine
Why don't you show me your sign?
And I'm already feeling alright tonight

I took a piece of your heart and I kept it with me
I had you right from the start cause you knew I was not gonna leave
You should have taken the chance but you left way too fast

And I was lucky to get the time of day from you
And it's such a shame to see a view like this
Without us laying in the grass, in the sunshine
Why don't you show me your sign?
And I'm already feeling alright tonight
I'm feeling alright

Was it something I said?
Was it something I did?
Cause I'm sorry if I am the reason I made you mad
Thinking of somebody other than you
But now I can see that you were never here for me [2x]

You took a piece of my heart and you gave it away
You had me right from the start cause I thought you were going to stay
And I should have taken the chance but you left way too fast

And I was lucky to get the time of day from you
And it's such a shame to see a view like this
Without us laying in the grass, in the sunshine
Why don't you show me your sign?
And I'm already feeling alright tonight
Alright
