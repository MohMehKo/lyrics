One more day.
I'll gather your gifts and put them below our
Evergreen
Is covered in lights and across from the fire, there's
You and me,
Closing our eyes 'cause
The warmth is just making them
So heavy.
Wrapped in a blanket, hoping you'll see that...

This time next year,
I'll be right here-
Filling your stocking with a ring.
And you don't need snow to be the angel you are.

You're asleep with your head on my shoulder,
And hopefully, soon you will
Start to dream
Of all the great things that tomorrow will bring to
You and me.
The holiday's here and all that I want is for
Us to be
Holding each other, forever and ever.

So this time next year,
I'll be right here-
Filling your stocking with a ring.
And I don't need snow to be the man in your life.

[musical break]

This time next year,
I'll be right here-
Filling your stocking with a ring.
And we don't need snow to fall in love.
