And you don't have the clue
But every time it's just another way for you
To get me going
To get me going

And the things you do to me
Is enough for me to slide your apologies
Right on by me
Right on by me

I'm t-t-tickin like a timebomb baby baby
When you told me to forget you I went crazy
But now I'm here and I doubt you'll see me standing still
Cuz I'm waiting for the time
To let it go 

And I don't want to do what I've been doing
And it's time to make it through another day of holding on
And you've become a mess
SO STOP
And build back up

To what you used to be 

I'm t-t-tickin like a timebomb baby, baby
But when you told me to forget you I went crazy
But now I'm here and I doubt you'll see me standing still
Cuz I'm waiting for the time
To let it go

I'm t-t-tickin like a timebomb baby baby 
When you told me to forget you I went craaaaaazy 

I'm t-t-tickin like a timebomb baby baby 
When you told me to forget you I went crazy 
But now I'm here and I doubt you'll see me standing still 
Cuz I'm waiting for the time 
To let it go
