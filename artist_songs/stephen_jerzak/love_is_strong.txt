I don't need love
Cause I already found it, push comes to shove 
Guess I never really had it inside my heart
To let you go and break it

That was my old way of thinking before we met
That was my old state of mind before you left
And this is what I have to say for myself

Love is strong, you don't need anyone 
To hold you back from what you want
Love is strong, did you know anyone can feel it
Just put trust in someone, In someone

Should I give up
Thats my only question
Its just too much
Wish it never would've happened 
We were in Love
Til she forgot that it existed 

That was my old way of thinking before we met
That was my old state of mind before you left
And this is what I have to say for myself

Love is strong, you don't need anyone 
To hold you back from what you want
Love is strong, did you know anyone can feel it
Just put trust in someone, In someone

[Guitar solo]

Love is strong
You don't need anyone
To hold you, back from what you want

Love is Strong 
Did you know anyone can feel it
Just put trust in someone
In someone
