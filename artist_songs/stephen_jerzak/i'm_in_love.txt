I'm in love with a girl
Who is out of this world
She don't know that I love her
So-oh-oh
When she's around I always find a way
To make a fool out of myself
And on a scale of one to ten
She's a twelve
And I love her
So-oh-oh

And I'm giving it all that I got just to say
And you're the only one that I want
With a May

I'm in love with a girl
She is so beautiful
She don't know that I love her
So-oh-oh
I adore her when she opens up her eyes
She makes my world alive
I'm in love with her

And I'm giving it all that I got just to say
And you're the only one that I want
With a May-ay
You got my stomach up in a knot
When you say
And you're the only one I want with a May

Sometimes I'm awake at night and
You're the only thing that's on my mind

And I'm giving it all that I got just to say
And you're the only one that I want
With a May-ay
You got my stomach up in a knot
When you say
That you're the only one I want with a May
