Sing me, sing me, baby
Sing me, sing me, sing me
Oooh

La, lala, lalala
(Sing me, sing me, sing me, yeah)
La, lala, lalala
(Sing the jingle jangle song)

La, lala, lalala
(Sing me, sing me, baby, yeah)
La, lala, lalala

Ever since I met you
I couldn't want you better
I couldn't love you stronger if I tried

It's my true heart I'm showin'
Or my nose would be growin'
You know that it gets longer when I lie

Singin' la, lala, lalala
(Sing me, sing me, sing me, yeah)
La, lala, lalala
(Sing the jingle jangle song)

La, lala, lalala
(Oooh, sing me, sing me, baby, yeah)
La, lala, lalala

Bein' kinda pretty and down here in the city
Find it isn't easy to be smart
When tryin' to untangle the jingle from the jangle
It's easy if you listen with your heart

Singin' la, lala, lalala
(Sing me, sing me, sing me, yeah)
La, lala, lalala
(Sing the jingle jangle song)

La, lala, lalala
(Sing me, sing me, baby, yeah)
La, lala, lalala

You'll make the winter springtime
And jingle jangle sing time
Right on through the summer and the fall

So darlin' don't be weepin'
And please don't you be sleepin'
When I come creepin' down the hill
To sing you

La, lala, lalala
(Sing me, sing me, sing me, yeah)
La, lala, lalala

Oh, come on (Come on)

We'll get it together

Oh, come on (Come on)

Oooh, yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh, come on (Come on)

We'll get it together

Oh, come on (Come on)

Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on

La, lala, lalala
(Sing the jingle jangle song)
La, lala, lalala
(Sing me, sing me, baby, yeah)

La, lala, lalala
(Sing the jingle jangle song)
La, lala, lalala
(Sing me, sing me, baby, yeah)
