This is a man who thinks with his heart
His heart is not always wise
This is a man who stumbles and falls
But this is a man who tries
This is a man you'll forgive and forgive
And help and protect as long as you live

He will not always say
What you would have him say
But now and then he'll say something wonderful

The thoughtless things he'll do
Will hurt and worry you
Then all at once he'll do something wonderful
He has a thousand dreams that won't come true
You know that he believes in them
And that's enough for you

You'll always go along with
Defend him when he's wrong
And tell him when he's strong
He is wonderful
He'll always need your love
And so you'll get your love
'Cause a man who needs your love
Can be wonderful
