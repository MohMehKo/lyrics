This song talk about the same Porgy
That we've talked about for two years now
His name is Porgy only this one was written by eh
Dorothy Fields and Jimmy McHugh

I got my man now I got Porgy
My baby understands now I got my Porgy
I'm through with bymays his way is may way forever more
Lord when i feel his arms around me
Knowing he can't go on without me
I wants to beg for a chance to camp at his door

Say he's not much for to look and see
He's lazy and no count as he can be
He's got the kind of a love for me
So I'm changing my style my way of living
Glad I've stopped taking and started giving
I got my man got my Porgy now

Though you say he's not much for to look and see
He's lazy and no count as he can be
He's got the kind of a love for me
Oh oh baby I'm changing my style nad way of living
Glad I've stopped taking and started giving
I got my man I got my Porgy now
