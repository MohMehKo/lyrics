The rain has stopped
The streets are fresh and warm
The sky is clear
The day begins to form
Once more I step outside
And in my quiet way
Once again these words I have to say

Will I find my love today
Will I see his smiling face
In some quiet, romantic place
Will he come my way

Will I find my love today
How I wonder how we'll meet
In the park or on the street
Will he come my way...

How am I to find love
What am I to do
I'm a lonely girl
With no rendevous

Will I find my love today
Will I see his smiling face
In some quiet, romantic place
Will he come my way

How am I to find love
Tell me, what am I to do
I'm a lonesome girl
With no rendevous

Will I find my love today
How I wonder how we'll meet
In the park or on the street

Or if I don't
I know tommorow
I will say
Will I find my love today
