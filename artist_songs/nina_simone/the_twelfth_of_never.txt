You ask me how much I need you
Must I explain
I need you oh my darling
Like roses need rain
You ask how long I'll love you
I'll tell you true
Until the twelfth of never
I'll still be loving you

Hold me close
Never let me go
Hold me close
Melt my heart like april snow

I'll love you 'til the bluebells
Forget to bloom
I'll love you 'til the clover
Has lost it's perfume
And I'll love you 'til the poets

Run out of rhyme
Until the twelfth of never
And that's a long, long time

Hold me close
Never let me go
Hold me close
Melt my heart like april snow

I'll love you 'til the bluebells
Forget to bloom
I'll love you 'til the clover
Has lost it's perfume
And I'll love you 'til the poets
Run out of rhyme
Until the twelfth of never
And that's a long, long time
Until the twelfth of never
And that's a long, long time
A long, long time
