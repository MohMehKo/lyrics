It's not 'cause I wouldn't,
It's not 'cause I shouldn't,
And, you know though well, it's not 'cause I couldn't,
It's simply because I'm the laziest gal in town.

My poor heart is achin'
To bring home the bacon,
And if I find myself alone and forsaken,
It's simply because I'm the laziest gal in town.

Though I'm more than willing to learn
How these gals get so much extra money to burn,
Every little proposition I just turn it down,
'Way down,

It's not 'cause I wouldn't,
It's not 'cause I shouldn't, honey,
And, you know, that it's not 'cause I couldn't,
It's simply because I'm the laziest, laziest gal in town.
