The other woman finds time to manicure her nails
The other woman is perfect where her rival fails
And she's never seen with pin curls in her hair

The other woman enchantes her clothes with French perfume
The other woman keeps fresh cut flowers in each room
There are never toys that's scattered everywhere

And when her baby comes to call
He'll find her waiting like a lonesome queen
Cos when she's by his side
It's such a change from old routine

But the other woman will always cry herself to sleep
The other woman will never have his love to keep
And as the years go by the other woman
Will spend her life alone

Where do you come from where do you go
Where do you come from Cotton Eyed Joe
I come for to see you and I come for to sing
And I come for to show you my diamond ring

If it hadn't a-been for Cotton Eyed Joe
Well I'd a-been married a long time ago
Oh where do you come from where do you go
Where do you come from where do you go
Where do you come from where do you go
My Cotton Eyed Joe

Tell me where do you come from and where do you go
Tell me where do you come from my Cotton Eyed Joe
Well I come for to see you and I come for to sing
And I come for to show you my diamond ring

Oh Joe if you hadn't been so slow
Well I'd a-been married a long time ago
Where do you come from where do you go
Where do you come from where do you go
I come for to see you and I come for to sing
And I come for to show you my diamond ring

Well if it hadn't a-been for Cotton Eyed Joe
Well I'd a-been married a long time ago
Oh where do you come from where do you go
My my Cotton Eyed Joe
