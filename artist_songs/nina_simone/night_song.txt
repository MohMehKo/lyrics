Summer
Not a bit of breeze
Neon signs are shining
Through the tired trees

Lovers
Walking to and fro
Every one has someon
And a place to go

Now listen
Hear the clouds go past
They don't even see me
Flying by so fast

Moving
Going who knows where
Only thing I know is
I'm not going there

Where do you go
When you feel that your brain is on fire?
Where do you go
When you don't even know what it is you desire

Listen
Laughter everywhere
Hear it
Life is in the air

And night comes
And the town awakes
Sound of children calling
And the squeal of brakes

Music
By the lonely sung
When you can't help wondering
Where do I belong?
