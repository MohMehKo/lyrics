I work at home in my parents' basement
I don't troll, I make statements
I'm not a cliche sittin' in my PJ's
Double cupping at lunch on a Tuesday
I'm like Drake, see? So don't hate me!
I get vexed if you don't appreciate me
Real talk, I'll put the world to rights
And when I'm a big boy I'm gonna write for Vice

It's not for me
It must be wrong
I could ignore it and move on
But I'm a Broadband Champion
A URL Badman
And if you're tryna call it art
I'll have to take it all apart
I got a high-brow game plan
A URL Badman

I'm a U-R-L B-A-D M-A-N with no empathy
I got a high-brow game plan
A URL Badman
I'm a U-R-L B-A-D M-A-N and you're dead to me
'Cause I'm a Broadband Champion

Spectacles with no prescription
Short-shorts with conviction
Supreme palace, APC
Sizzurp in a chalice, yeah, that's so me
I'm a London white boy rapping ATL
Keyboard Warrior that can't spell
I don't like you, I think you're worthless
I wrote a long piece about it up on my WordPress

It's not for me
It must be wrong
I could ignore it and move on

I like Jordans, Joyrich, DJ's screw shit
I'm as complex, Pitchfork, Winnie The Pooh shit
I'm a space ghost perpetrator
a bottom half of idolater
a check for Tyler the Creator
a blogespheric vindicator
A$AP, Kanye, XX remix
Mike Jones, Paul Wall, I need a Kleenex
I don't like girls much, they're kinda silly
Unless of course they wanna play with my willy
