As I lay down on the bed
Try'na come to terms with what has just been said
I don't know where I should look or what to say
Is this happening to us today?

If I could then I would scream
I'd wipe the tears off of my face
Wake me up if it's a dream
This is more than I can take
I'd give everything I own
If someone else could take my place
Will someone else please take my place?

How can life be so unfair?
I can't breathe, in fact I'm choking on the air
It's all over, I can see it on your eyes
Pull my hand down, heavily I sigh

If I could then I would scream
I'd wipe the tears off of my face
Wake me up if it's a dream
This is more than I can take
I'd give everything I own
If someone else could take my place
Will someone else please take my place?

If I could then I would scream
I'd wipe the tears off of my face
Wake me up if it's a dream
This is more than I can take
I'd give everything I own
If someone else could take my place
Will someone else please take my place?
