When she was just a little girl
and she'd come home from school in tears
I diarise and tell her it'll be alright
Now look at her, she's all grown up
with nothing, but a broken heart
And I think to myself

where did I go wrong,
what more could I have done,
how could I have prepared her better

If only I could save her from her sadness,
If only I could take away her pain
If only I could make her see,
there's plenty more fish in the sea,
I know that I'd breath easily again
