There must be something wrong
You've been gone for days
Hanging out with strangers
Getting off your face
Tomorrow you'll wake up in someone else's bed
You don't know their name, you barely even met

Put on last night's clothes
Do the walk of shame
Go to kiss goodbye
Won't see them again

Finally you're home
Pour a glass of red
Won't leave you alone
Those voices in your head

I've told you what to do
Why do you let them get to you?

Stop right there
When did you stop caring
You used to light up the room
I swear now you best
Turn this round
Don't you dare
Throw the towel in too soon
I see fight in you
Life inside of you
It's just not like you to lose

So what you're waiting for?
You can have it all

Don't you think it's time?
Give yourself a break
Working yourself up
Into such a state
Think no one knows
We don't understand
Think you've missed the boat
It's gotten out of hand

Open up your eyes
Stop burying your head
Stuck on self-destruct
Here we go again
Don't pick up their calls
Those people aren't your friends
Just can't help yourself
Why'd you let them in?

I've told you what to do
Why do you let them get to you?
Stop right there
When did you stop caring?
You used to light up the room
I swear now you best
Turn this round
Don't you dare
Throw the towel in too soon
I see fight in you
Life inside of you
It's just not like you to lose
So what you're waiting for?
You can have it all

I've told you what to do
Why do you let them get to you?
Stop right there
When did you stop caring?
You used to light up the room
I swear now you best
Turn this round
Don't you dare
Throw the towel in too soon
I see fight in you
Life inside of you
It's just not like you to lose
So what you're waiting for?
You can have it all
