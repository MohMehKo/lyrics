Ooooooooooo
Ooooooooooo

Friday night last orders at the pub,
Get in the car and drive to the club,
There's a massive crowd outside so we get in to the queue
It's quarter past 11 now we won't get in till quarter to two.

It's quarter to and we get to the front,
Girl on a guest list dressed like a c***
She asked security to check inside my shoes,
You can play this game with me but you know you're gonna lose.

[Hook]
Looked me up and down,
I don't make a sound,
There's a lesson that I want you to learn,
If you're gonna play with fire then you're gonna get burned,

[Chorus]
Don't try and test me cos you'll get reaction,
Another drink and I'm ready for action,
I don't know who you think you are,
But making people scared wont get you very far.

Ooooooooooooo
Ooooooooooooo

In the club make our way to the bar,
Good dancing love but you should have wore a bra.
Guy on the mike and he's making too much noise,
There's these girls in the corner wanting attention from the boys.

I see these girls and they're shouting through the crowd,
Don't understand why they're being really loud.
They make their way over to me,
They try to push me out the way,
I'll push her back, she looks at me and says,
What you tryna say?

[Hook]
[Chorus x2]

Oooooooooooooo
Oooooooooooooo
