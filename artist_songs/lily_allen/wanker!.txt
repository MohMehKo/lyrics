Don't patronize me,
Don't think you have to let me down lightly.
I think you're disillusioned, you've confused me with someone who cares (who cares)
I've made my decision,
They've offered me a job in television.
Before I say farewell I hope to god you rot in hell,
I'll say a little prayer. (say a little prayer)

What goes around, comes around

Wanker! Wanker! You're such a wanker!
Not today but, one day I'll thank her.
Loser! Loser! You're such a loser!
You-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Hope you get what you deserve,
Hope you die in some absurd,
Stupid ridiculous way.
Hope you choke on you're own spit,
Hope your wife chops off you're dick,
When she finds out you're secretly gay!

Well actually that would make quite a lot of sense,
because you are really rubbish in bed.
Besides the point you're horrible and I hate you,
You bastard you really are a horrible bastard.

I've made my decision,
They've offered me a job in television.
Before I say farewell I hope to god you rot in hell,
I'll say a little prayer. (say a little prayer)

Loser! Loser! You're such a loser!
You-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
