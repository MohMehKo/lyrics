I was born in the 80's
I'm a child of Thatcher and her mateys
Few things been happening lately
Mr Cameron please sedate me 
It's all gone a bit Scargill
Move on man pay your bar bill
Don't forget to take your friends with you
I'm a red girl, I can't see blue

Sick of this sick of this go fuck your mum 
Sick of this coalition what you done?
[x4] 

Better days better days better days are you round the corner?
'Cause we're waiting for ya
Come around and stay
And I pray and I pray and I pray that they're nearly here
Now I've got the fear
Yeah we need a change 

I'm speaking for the UK now
Just clear your desk and go away now
You must know you look stupid
Aren't you losing seats now to UKIP?
You're supposed to be our protector
What about the whole public sector
Cover up them cuts, look rational
Know all about you and news international

Sick of this sick of this go fuck your mum 
Sick of this coalition what you done?
[x4] 

Better days better days better days are you round the corner
'Cause we're waiting for ya
Come around and stay
And I pray and I pray and I pray that they're nearly here
Now I've got the fear
Yeah we need a change

Better days better days better days are you round the corner
'Cause we're waiting for ya
Come around and stay
And I pray and I pray and I pray that they're nearly here
Now I've got the fear
Yeah we need a change
