Why don't you keep your eyes on the road
Keep yourself to yourself
Or you're gonna explode
Don't concern yourself in my shit
If I told you the truth
Well you probably couldn't handle it
What's it got to do with you
I don't care what you get up to
Didn't ask for your opinion
Not your business
Wind your neck in

Why'd you think you're better
Little rubber-necker
No one likes a trouble maker
Pull up your socks
There's nothing to see here
Why'd you have to be here
Can't you turn around and get back into your box

Wind your neck in
Wi-wi-wi-wind your neck in
Wind your neck in
Wi-wi-wi

I've always said each to their own
Won't you give me a break
Won't you throw me a bone
I'm a different kettle of fish
If you don't understand
Just look the other way, you bitch
I'll do my thing, you do yours
What you get up to behind closed doors
Not of interest, I've no opinion
It's not my business
Wind your neck in

Why'd you think you're better
Little rubber-necker
No one likes a trouble maker
Pull up your socks
There's nothing to see here
Why'd you have to be here
Can't you turn around and get back into your box

Wind your neck in
Wi-wi-wi-wind your neck in
Wind your neck in
Wi-wi-wi

Down, down
The rubber-neckers slow me down
When will they ever work it out
No, they can't run me out of town

Why'd you think you're better
Little rubber-necker
No one likes a trouble maker
Pull up your socks
There's nothing to see here
Why'd you have to be here
Can't you turn around and get back into your box

Wind your neck in
Wi-wi-wi-wind your neck in
Wind your neck in
Wi-wi-wi
