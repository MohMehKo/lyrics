I've been thinking that you've crossed the line,
if you disappeared that would be just fine,
'cause you waste my time and waste my money
and you're not too cool and not too funny!
Spreading your seed all over the town
getting too greedy and messing around:
Oh my gosh you must be joking me
if you think that you'll be poking me.

Don't take me on no, no
Don't take me on no, no
Don't take me on
Shattered the lie but you think I don't already know,
Don't try to deny 'cause my fuse is ready to blow
Its your turn to learn I think that you know where to go
It's a shame, shame, shame for you

Please don't come around and knock on my door
'cause I don't want to have to pick you up of the floor,
when you ask if we can still be lovers,
I'll have to introduce my brothers,
Think that they could teach you a lesson or two,
By the time they've finished you'll be black and blue
You'll be crying like a baby,
A sea of tears they'll call the navy in.

Don't take me on no, no
Don't take me on no, no
Don't take me on
Shattered the lie but you think I don't already know,
Don't try to deny 'cause my fuse is ready to blow
It's your turn to learn I think that you know where to go
It's a shame shame shame for you

Don't take me on no, no
Don't take me on no, no
Don't take me on
Shattered the lie but you think I don't already know,
Don't try to deny 'cause my fuse is ready to blow
It's your turn to learn but I think that you know where to go
It's a shame shame shame for you
