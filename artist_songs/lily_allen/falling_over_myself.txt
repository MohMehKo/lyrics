Sometimes I think he’s undressing me with his eyes
Visually caressing me all over
Please just take me boy cuz I’m all yours
Anywhere do me on the sofa or your wheelie chair
On the photocopying machine
You can have me any way you please

I can’t take my eyes off you, boy
I’m so hypnotized, you got me

Falling
Falling over myself
Like I’m under a spell
Oh, Daniel, I can't go on like this much longer
Take my clothes off
Bend me over your desk
I'll be sure to impress.
Oh, Daniel, these feelings will only get stronger

I can’t take my eyes off you, boy
I’m so hypnotized, you got me

Falling
Falling over myself
Like I’m under a spell
Oh, Daniel, I can't go on like this much longer
Take my clothes off
Bend me over your desk
I'll be sure to impress.
Oh, Daniel, these feelings will only get stronger

Bridget, you better learn to play the game
What will it take for you to see their all the same?
Oh yeah, you better come prepared
You’ll never get anywhere
You’ll never get anywhere
