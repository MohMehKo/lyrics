Superstar
Where you from, how's it going?
I know you
Gotta clue, what you're doing?
You can play brand new to all the other chicks out here
But I know what you are, what you are, baby

Look at you
Gettin' more than just re-up
Baby, you
Got all the puppets with their strings up
Fakin' like a good one, but I call 'em like I see 'em
I know what you are, what you are, baby

Womanizer, woman-womanizer, you're a womanizer
Oh, womanizer, oh, you're a womanizer, baby
You, You, You are, you, you, you are
Womanizer, womanizer, womanizer (womanizer)
Boy, don't try to front. I-I know just-just what you are-a-a
Boy, don't try to front. I-I know just-just what you are-a-a
You got me going, you also charming, but I can do it, you womanizer
Boy, don't try to front. I-I know just-just what you are-a-a
Boy, don't try to front. I-I know just-just what you are-a-a
You say I'm Crazy, I got you crazy, you're nothing but a womanizer

Daddy-O
You got the swagger of champions
So bad for you
Just can't find the right companion
I guess when you have one too many, makes it hard
It could be easy, who you are, that's who you are baby
Lollipop
Must mistake me as a sucker
To think that I
Would be a victim not another
Say it, play it how you wanna, but no way
I'm ever gonna fall for you, never you, baby

Womanizer, woman-womanizer, you're a womanizer
Oh, womanizer, oh, you're a womanizer, baby
You, You, You are, you, you, you are
Womanizer, womanizer, womanizer (womanizer)
Boy, don't try to front. I-I know just-just what you are-a-a
Boy, don't try to front. I-I know just-just what you are-a-a
You got me going, you also charming, but I can do it, you womanizer
Boy, don't try to front. I-I know just-just what you are-a-a
Boy, don't try to front. I-I know just-just what you are-a-a
You say I'm Crazy, I got you crazy, you're nothing but a womanizer

Maybe if we both lived in a different world
It would be all good, and maybe I could be yaw girl
But I can't 'cause we don't
Womanizer, woman-womanizer, you're a womanizer
Oh, womanizer, oh, you're a womanizer, baby
You, You, You are, you, you, you are
Womanizer, womanizer, womanizer (womanizer)
Boy, don't try to front. I-I know just-just what you are-a-a
Boy, don't try to front. I-I know just-just what you are-a-a
You got me going, you also charming, but I can do it, you womanizer
Boy, don't try to front. I-I know just-just what you are-a-a
Boy, don't try to front. I-I know just-just what you are-a-a
You say I'm Crazy, I got you crazy, you're nothing but a womanizer
Boy, don't try to front. I-I know just-just what you are-a-a
Boy, don't try to front. I-I know just-just what you are-a-a
Womanizer, woman-womanizer, you're a womanizer
Oh, womanizer, oh, you're a womanizer, baby
