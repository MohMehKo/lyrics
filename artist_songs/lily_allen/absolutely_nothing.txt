I'm on the doorstep with my key turned in the door,
Walk the livin room and you're side on my floor

My heart is achin and i've never felt this bad
I pinch myself to check that all of this is real
Keep thinkin i'm not lettin on I feel this sad
Then you've got the cheek to ask me how I feel

And I say

Absolutley nothing, i'm absolutley fine
Absolutely nothing you can say to change my mind
Absolutely nothing, i'm absolutely fine
Absolutely nothing you can say to change my mind

I know that you just want to see me get upset
My world turned upside down so what did you expect?

My heart is achin and i've never felt this bad
I pinch myself to check that all of this is real
Keep thinkin i'm not lettin on I feel this sad
Then you've got the cheek to ask me how I feel

And I say

Absolutley nothing, i'm absolutley fine
Absolutely nothing you can say to change my mind
Absolutely nothing, i'm absolutely fine
Absolutely nothing you can say to change my mind

You've seen me cry, too many times
But not this time, no, not this time
I don't need you, to help me through
I'll be just fine, i'll be just fine

And I say

Absolutley nothing, i'm absolutley fine
Absolutely nothing you can say to change my mind
Absolutely nothing, i'm absolutely fine
Absolutely nothing you can say to change my mind [x3]
