Sun is shining in the sky
There ain't a cloud in sight
It's stopped rainin', everybody's in a play
And don't you know
It's a beautiful new day, hey
Runnin' down the avenue
See how the sun shines brightly in the city
On the streets where once was pity
Mr. Blue Sky is living here today hey, hey, hey
Mr. Blue Sky, please tell us why
You had to hide away for so long
Where did we go wrong?
Mr. Blue Sky, please tell us why
You had to hide away for so long
Where did we go wrong?

Hey you with the pretty face
Welcome to the human race
A celebration, mister Blue Sky's up there waitin'
And today is the day we've waited for, ooh
Mr. Blue Sky, please tell us why
You had to hide away for so long
Where did we go wrong?
Hey there mr. Blue
We're so pleased to be with you
Look around see what you do
Everybody smiles at you
Hey there mr. Blue
We're so pleased to be with you
Look around see what you do
Everybody smiles at you

Mr. Blue Sky, mr. Blue Sky
Mr. Blue Sky

Mister Blue, you did it right
But soon comes mister Night creepin' over
Now his hand is on your shoulder
Never mind I'll remember you this
I'll remember you this

Mister Blue Sky, please tell us why
You had to hide away for so long
Where did we go wrong?
Mister Blue Sky, please tell us why
You had to hide away for so long
Where did we go wrong?
Hey there, mister Blue
We're so pleased to be with you
Look around see what you do
Everybody smiles at you
