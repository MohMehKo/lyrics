Love doesn't cover it
It's a whole new other thing
And you change every day
When you call out my name
This is it

All that we went through
Before we were sent you
What did I did before
What was I looking for
To view

Don't wanna miss a thing
And when I go to sleep
I see you in my dreams
'Cause you're a part of me
You'll never be alone
Although I have to set you free
The places you will go
When you leave

Don't wanna miss a thing
And when I go to sleep
I see you in my dreams
'Cause you're a part of me
You'll never be alone
Although I have to set you free
The places you will go
When you leave
