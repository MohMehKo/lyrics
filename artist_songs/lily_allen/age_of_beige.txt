I turn on the radio, I can’t believe what I’m hearing
Maybe I’m passed it but this sounds like bullshit to me
It sounds so pretentious, it all sounds the same, it’s so boring
Songs about unicorns songs, songs about hugging some trees

It might make you crack a smile
I don’t understand, meanwhile
It goes straight over my head
I’m confused but I’m aware
Someone gets its it somewhere
It goes straight over my head

I used to know all my stuff
Turn it off, I’ve had enough
I must be losing my head
It might make you crack a smile
I don’t get it, meanwhile
It goes straight over my head

Don’t be so down when what’s happening is hardly surprising
Everythings dull its all turned into some sort of beige
Even the DJs are morons, they’re so patronizing
Sometimes i wonder what people will think of this age

It might make you crack a smile
I don’t understand, meanwhile
It goes straight over my head
I’m confused but I’m aware
Someone gets its it somewhere
It goes straight over my head

I used to know all my stuff
Turn it off, I’ve had enough
I must be losing my head
It might make you crack a smile
I don’t get it, meanwhile
It goes straight over my head

If this is a phase then I’m disengaged from the age of beige
If this is a phase then I’m disengaged from the age of beige
If this is a phase then I’m disengaged from the age of beige
If this is a phase then I’m disengaged from the age of beige

It might make you crack a smile
I don’t understand, meanwhile
It goes straight over my head
I’m confused but I’m aware
Someone gets its it somewhere
It goes straight over my head

I used to know all my stuff
Turn it off, I’ve had enough
I must be losing my head
It might make you crack a smile
I don’t get it, meanwhile
It goes straight over my head

Straight over my head [x3]
