Sunday morning
We were lying in bed, just the two of us under cover, undercover
With no warning you suddenly became my lover
I've been waiting so very long for you to say it to me, say it to me
I've been skating, skating on thin ice if I don't agree

I know you're the one for me but it took me by surprise
And If I say it back to you, I can't look you in the eye
I don't want to lose you, I don't want to confuse you
I guess that this is my cue, to give you my reply

And you killed it, you killed it
You killed it with I love you
And you killed it, you killed it
You killed it with I love you
And you killed with I love you
What am I supposed to say back to you?
You killed it with I love you

And I'm sorry
only three little words I seem to be so scared of
so please show me how to get these words
off the tip of my tongue and out of my mind

I know you're the one for me but it took me by surprise
If I say it back to you, I can't look you in the eye
I don't want to lose you, I don't want to confuse you
I guess that this is my cue, to give you my reply

I know you're the one for me but it took me by surprise
And If I say it back to you, I can't look you in the eye
I don't want to lose you, I don't want to confuse you
I guess that this is my cue, to give you my reply

And you killed it, you killed it
You killed it with I love you
And you killed it, you killed it
You killed it with I love you
And you killed with I love you
What am I supposed to say back to you?
You killed it with I love you

I have been thinking about what you said
Three little words running round in my head
There's no one else that I'd rather be next to
I guess what I'm trying to say is I love you
