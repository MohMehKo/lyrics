I can hear a grumble in the corner of the room
It's calling me and getting louder, I can feel impending doom 
I try to concentrate on something else
but it teases me so easily and then I find
Its ever so sensational, its almost gravitational
The way it pulls me over,
Well its sen-satiable
Its too inviting, too exciting
Refrigerator one, Bridget null

Its just too

Yummy! Yum yummy, scrummy.
Its so [?]
Its not right but I can't help myself.
Yummy! Yum in my tummy.
Might seem quite funny,
But we all know that soon I wont be low

I like to spend my evening on the sofa in pajamas.
I like reading magazines and books by Dali Lamas.
What I really like to do is,
turn the telly on and scarf my face.
Its never unconditional, fudge is not nutritional.
Nor is full fat cola.
Hagaan daas with chocolate chips are emigrating to me hips.
Refrigerator two, Bridget null 

Yummy! Yum yummy, scrummy.
Its so [?]
Its not right but I can't help myself.
Yummy! Yum in my tummy.
Might seem quite funny,
But we all know that soon I wont be low

(YUMMY!)
