Now listen I think you and me have come to the end of our time,
What do you want some kind of reaction?
Well, OK, that's fine,
Alright, how would it make you feel if I said you never made me cum?
In the year and a half that we spent together,
Yeah, I never really had much fun.

All those times that I said I was sober,
Well I'm afraid I lied,
I'd be lying next to you, you next to me,
All the while I was high as a kite.
I could see it in your face as you break it to me gentle,
Yeah, you really must think you're great,
Let's see how you feel in a couple of weeks,
When I work my way through your mates.

[Chorus:]
I never wanted it to end up this way,
You've only got yourself to blame,
I'm gonna tell the world you're rubbish in bed now
And that you're small in the game.

I saw you thought this was gonna be easy,
Well, you're out of luck.
Yeah, let's rewind, let's turn back time to when you couldn't get it up,
You know what it should've ended there,
That's when I should've shown you the door.
As if that weren't enough to deal with,
You became premature.

I'm sorry if you feel that I'm being kinda mental,
But you left me in such a state.
But now I'm gonna do what you did to me,
Gonna reciprocate.

[Chorus:]
You're not big, you're not clever,
No, you ain't a big brother
Not big what so ever.

Ah [etc.]

I'm sorry if you feel that I'm being kinda mental,
But you left me in such a state.
But now I'm gonna do what you did to me,
I'm gonna reciprocate.

You're not big, you're not clever,
No, you ain't a big brother
Not big what so ever

You're not big, you're not clever,
Not big what so ever
No, you ain't a big brother [x2]
