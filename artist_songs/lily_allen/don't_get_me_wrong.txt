Don't get me wrong, if I'm looking kind of dazzled
I see neon lights, whenever you walk by
Don't get me wrong, if you say hello and I take a ride
Upon a sea where the mystic moon is playing havoc with the tide
Don't get me wrong

Don't get me wrong, if I'm acting so distracted
I'm thinking about the fireworks that go off when you smile
Don't get me wrong, if I split like light refracted
I'm only off to wander across a moonlit mile

Once in a while, two people meet
Seemingly for no reason, they just pass on the street
Suddenly thunder showers everywhere
But who can explain the thunder and rain, but there's something in the air

Don't get me wrong, if I come and go like fashion
I might be great tomorrow, but hopeless yesterday
Don't get me wrong, if I fall in the mode of passion
It might be unbelievable, but let's not say so long
It might just be fantastic, don't get me wrong
