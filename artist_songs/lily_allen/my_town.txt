I was just enjoying myself
I was minding my own business 
I hear you come smiling into the room
Anybody would think you were Jesus

Where’d you get all that confidence
Can I get the name of your dealer?
I never liked you and I’m still on the fence
I might be jealous but I’m not a believer

What do you say? What do you say? What do you say?
Just go away, just go away

This used to be my town (my town)
You being here just brings me down
I die inside when you’re around (when you're around)
This used to be my town

I used to behave like you 
I didn’t care about people around me
I couldn’t move, I was so up my own ass
Then reality came and found me

Now its all fine, now its all fine, now its all fine
This is your time, this is your time

This used to be my town (my town)
You being here just brings me down
I die inside when you’re around (when you're around)
This used to be my town

In a couple of years or so we’ll be having this conversation
There’ll be a pretty young thing we know pulling up into our oil station

This used to be my town (my town)
You being here just brings me down
I die inside when you’re around (when you're around)
This used to be my town
