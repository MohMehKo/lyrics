Don’t you know it’s gonna rain
All the things I said I do
I didn’t fix them, did I?
On a plane, I don’t want to go away
I couldn’t help it, could I?

I don’t want to drag you down
I’m just gonna shelter you
Keep you warm, safe and sound
It’s not like you to listen to the crowd
It’s just this dirty town

It goes on and on for days
From the curtain, we see stars
I didn’t stop that, did I?

When the pain
We get better just to find the same again
I couldn’t help it, could I?

I don’t want to drag you down
I just gonna shelter you
Keep you warm, safe and sound
It’s not like you to use your eyes like that on me
Don’t listen to the crowd

It’s just this dirty town
Don’t break me
Don’t break me
Don’t break me
Don’t break me
