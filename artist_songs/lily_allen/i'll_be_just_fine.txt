These places, these faces,
these people with their fake embraces
I, I wish that I fall down and die

While they're talking
I'm walking,
I wave my hand up in the air
to say goodbye,
I don't know why
I even try

They don't even see me
they don't even care
nobody needs me,
it's like I'm not there,
Relax and stay dry,
into the night
I'll be just fine
'Cause one day I'll show you
and you'll feel like I do

He's quite funny, quite clever
he knows his way around my reachings never,
he won't get to see that stuff tonight
He's so charming, it's alarming
I could be his trophy for the night,
but I have lost the fight, 
much to his delight.

But it's only dinner, it's not like a date
If he wants to go there, he'll just have to wait
Relax and stay dry,
into the night

I'll be just fine [x3]
