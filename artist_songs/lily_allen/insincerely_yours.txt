What's going on in the magazines?
It's the same damn thing in every one
I don't give a fuck about Delevigne
Or that Rita girl
About Jourdan Dunn
I don't wanna know about your perfect life
Your perfect wife and it makes me sick
I don't give a fuck about your instagram
About your lovely house or your ugly kids

I'm not your friend and I can't pretend
I ain't being funny, funny
Let's be clear
I'm here
I'm here to make money, money, money
If I force a smile and can make it worthwhile
Don't touch me honey, honey
Let's be clear
I'm here
I'm here to make money, money, money

Insincere, insincerely yours tonight
(Let's be clear
I'm here
I'm here to make money, money, money)
We're all here
We're all here cause the price is right
(Let's be clear
I'm here
I'm here to make money, money, money)

Whatever happened to the real DJs
Cause the chick you've paid can't mix for shit
She's looking good with her headphones on
With her Beats by Dre
She's so legit
I see pictures of her all the time
On the Mail Online, she's everywhere
Does anybody know what she does?
Do you know her name, do you really care?

I'm not your friend and I can't pretend
I ain't being funny, funny
Let's be clear
I'm here
I'm here to make money, money, money
If I force a smile and can make it worthwhile
Don't touch me honey, honey
Let's be clear
I'm here
I'm here to make money, money, money

Insincere, insincerely yours tonight
(Let's be clear
I'm here
I'm here to make money, money, money)
We're all here
We're all here cause the price is right
(Let's be clear
I'm here
I'm here to make money, money, money)

I've never been one to moan
But you're doing in my head now
Doing in my head
Doing in my head
Doing in my head
Will somebody take me home?
I'm ready for my bed now
Ready for my bed
Ready for my bed
Ready for my bed

Insincere, insincerely yours tonight
(Let's be clear
I'm here
I'm here to make money, money, money)
We're all here
We're all here cause the price is right
(Let's be clear
I'm here
I'm here to make money, money, money)
