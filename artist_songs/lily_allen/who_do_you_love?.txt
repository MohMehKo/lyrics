You know it always feels like
You take her side
Clicks her fingers
And you arrive to see her cry
I’ve got two of my own kids
I’m a slave to my mortgage
I don’t ask you for nothing
Will it always be like this?

And you’re struggling to hide it
And I know you’ve decided
It’s not each in your own way
I can tell but you won’t say

Who do you love? [x10]
Who do you love? [x10]
Who do you love?

She reads like a textbook
I do things in other ways
Never did understand
And when she cries I walk away
She’s has younger than my kids
You’re a slave for her baggage
And I try but it wears thin
To be nice but I can’t win

And you’re struggling to hide it
And I know you’ve decided
It’s not each in your own way
I can tell but you won’t say

Who do you love? [x10]
Who do you love? [x10]
Who do you love?

Mother, mother, mother
I’m in need of your attention
Can we hold a conversation
Where she goes without a mention?
If I make it look easy
You can blame my good intentions
Take a walk in my world
Take a walk in my world

Who do you love? [x10]
Who do you love? [x10]
Who do you love?
