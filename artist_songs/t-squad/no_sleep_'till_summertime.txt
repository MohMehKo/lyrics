Summertime and the livin is easy 
The summer's here yeah you gotta believe me 
I'll ride the wave to wherever it leads me 
Where the sun shines bright and the wind blows breezy 
No sleep til summertime 

[boys] 
In the summertime all is rad 
You know just what i mean 
Girls look fly passing by 
It's a beautiful scene 
Toes in the sand, hand in hand 
Everything unplanned 
Same time same place 
Soaking the sunrays 
Don't you forget my face 

[girl] 
In the summertime it's all good 
You know just what i mean 
The boys look fly, they catch your eye 
It's a beautiful scene 
Justin on the radio, party on the patio 
Ready here we go 
Same time same place 
Soaking the sunrays 
Big smile on my face 

[chorus:] 
There'll be no sleep til summertime oh yeah

Waiting for it all through the year

Soda pop ,old school hiphop 
Dancing till we drop

Lying in the sun 
Monkey in the middle, when we were little 
We knew how to have some fun 
Same time same place 
Soakin the sun rays 
Can't let it go to waste 

[chorus:]

Reason one that summer rules 
We don't have to go to school 
From the beach to the pool 
Looking hot and keeping cool 
Open toes t's and vans 
Working on the perfect tan 
Instant message what's the plan 
Parents just don't understand 
Hot dogs beach parties 
Checking out the superhotties 
Volleyball and catching rays 
Now it's time to hit the waves 
At the mall window shopping 
Dreaming up a look that's poppin 
Summertime jams droppin 
Summertime is never stopping 

[chorus:] 
There'll be no sleep til summertime oh yeah 
(aw come on come on) 
Waiting for it all through the year
