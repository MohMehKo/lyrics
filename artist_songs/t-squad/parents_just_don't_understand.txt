Listen up now everybody 
All you kids across the land 
Listen up now everybody 
Parents don't understand: 

You know parents are the same 
No matter time nor place 
They don't understand that us kids 
Are going to make some mistakes 
So to you, all the kids all across the land 
There's no need to argue 
Parents just don't understand 

I remember one year 
My mom took me school shopping 
It was me, my brother, my mom, oh, my pop, and my little sister 
All hopped in the car 
We headed downtown to the gallery mall 
My mom started bugging with the clothes she chose 
I didn't say nothing at first 
I just turned up my nose 

She said, "what's wrong? this shirt cost $20" 
We said, "mom, this shirt is plaid with a butterfly collar!" 
The next half hour was the same old thing 
My mother buying me clothes from 1983 
And then she lost her mind and did the ultimate 
I asked her for adidas and she bought me zips! 

I said, "mom, what are you doing, you're ruining my rep" 
She said, "you're only sixteen, you don't have a rep yet" 
I (we) said, "mom, let's put these clothes back, please" 
She said "no, you go to school to learn not for a fashion show" 

I said, "this isn't family matters , come on mom, i'm not erkle 
Mom, please put back the high water pants with lime circles 
But if you don't want to i can live with that but 
You gotta put back the double-knit reversible slacks" 

She wasn't moved - everything stayed the same 
Inevitably the first day of school came 
I thought i could get over, i tried to play sick 
But my mom said, "no, no way, uh-uh, forget it" 
There was nothing i could do, i tried to relax 
I got dressed up in those ancient artifacts 
And when i walked into school, it was just as i thought 
The kids were cracking up laughing at the clothes mom bought 
And those who weren't laughing still had a ball 
Because they were pointing and whispering 
As i walked down the hall 

I got home and told my mom how my day went 
She said, "if they were laughing you don't need them, 
"cause they're not good friends" 
For the next six hours i tried to explain to my mom 
That i was gonna have to go through this about 200 more times 
So to you all the kids all across the land 
There's no need to argue 
Parents just don't understand
