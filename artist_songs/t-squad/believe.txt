Sometimes i really gotta wonder 
Is this just a spell we're under 
All we seeing is the rain and thunder 
Can we kick it in to an endless summer 
(come on) free flowin' communication 
Break the hypnosis grippin' the nation 
Do you know what i mean? 

Maybe now it's up to us to put down 
The recipe we got to turn this 'round 
Time to turn the focus on to you and me 

You got to believe in you and me 
Don't you know the truth will set you free 
You've got to believe in you and me 
Don't you turn your back on destiny 
Ahh yeah... truth gonna you free 

There are times when it all seems hopeless 
I look at the dice how did i roll this 
Is there a way we can all find solace 
Can't we change the channel and adjust the focus 
(come on) a new world where the choice is endless 
I gotta message and i gotta send this 
Do you know what i mean? 
Maybe now it's us to put right 
Warm a chill we feelin' on a cold night 
Tap into the positive energy 

[Chorus] 

Some people say the world is ruthless 
But that's only cuz for now it's truthless 
Some people say that hope is useless 
Beware the tiger but the tiger's toothless 
We counter with imagination 
Now it's up to this generation 
Do you know what we mean?
