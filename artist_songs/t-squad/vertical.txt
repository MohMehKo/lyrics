[Hook]
I won't (I won't) won't be held down 
Be stuck here on the ground. Yes sir! It's the real me (real me) 
I have found and I'm risin' up (risin' up!) [x2]

[Verse 1] 
Your feelin' something's incomplete, your faith is where a concrete seat,
And they refuse to make a move, this can't be your life. 
You know that something's out of step, cause you ain't found the rhythm yet.
Break from one, a different drum, this one is right. 
I believe that I can be both the same thing. Watch me spread my wings. 

[Chorus] 
I'm goin' vertical, a dream gets to fly.
It's like a miracle, a reach through the sky. 
If you want it you need it, now you've just got to free it. 
And it goes vertical, vertical. 

[Verse 2] 
Why shouldn't I have locked the door, that's what I got my own key for. 
I don't care whos keeping score, I'm not gonna lose.
Don't matter what I won't forget, only what is represents.
It's in my head it's making sense, I'm gonna choose. 
To believe that I can be both the same thing. Watch me spread my wings. 

[Chorus] 
I'm goin' vertical, a dream gets to fly.
It's like a miracle, a reach through the sky. 
If you want it you need it, now you've just got to free it. 
And it goes vertical.. 

[Hook] 
I won't (I won't) won't be held down 
Be stuck here on the ground. Yes sir! It's the real me (real me) 
I have found and I'm risin' up (risin' up!) [x2]

[Chorus (broken up)] 
Vertical (interlude) a miracle.
If you want it, you need it.
Free it. Vertical. . 

[Chorus] 
I'm goin' vertical, a dream gets to fly.
It's like a miracle, a reach through the sky. 
If you want it you need it, now you've just got to free it, 
And it goes vertical 
Vertical!
