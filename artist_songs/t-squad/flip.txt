Now what would you do if i rhymed out of time
If i tripped on the stage forgot the next line
Would you be cold would you treat me unkind
Could i still call you a friend of mine
There are times when i don't have a clue (don't have a clue)
Without my friends i dont 'know what i'd do (i don't what i'd do)
I get by with a little help from my crew (from my crew)
So come on and show a little love for your boo
