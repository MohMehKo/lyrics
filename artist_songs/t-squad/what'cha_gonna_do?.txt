Whatchu gonna do when you're momma finds out 
You lied? you lied? 

I feel like i've done this i know you have too 
Deleting repeating and don't you know it's d©j  vu 
The lies that you're spinnin' are easy to see 
You're busted i trusted because you lie so obviously 

And what have we got here what's in store 
When the boy cries wolf we just ignore it 
What have we got here what's it gonna be 
Nobody trusts you can't you see? 

Up and down and around we go 
Where it stops i guess we just don't know so : 

Whatchu gonna do when you're momma finds out 
You lied? you lied? 

Just listen ya dissin cuz you gotta learn 
Now answer the truth and don't be yessing 
Now everything you say's got me second-guessing 
Up and down and around we go 

Whatchu gonna do when you're momma finds out 
You lied? you lied? 

Whatchu gonna do when you're momma finds out 
You lied? you lied? 

Ya pants are on fire you're making me mad 
Perspire you liar i know i've been had 
But you gonna see that it doesn't pay 
To twist da truth with every word you say 

Up and down and around we go 
Karma's comin to get you yo 

Listen up now cuz we're gonna break it down 
Let me hear you now 
We got the power to turn this beat around 
Let me hear you everbody
