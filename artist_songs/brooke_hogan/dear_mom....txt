Yeah 
It's such a shame 
When someone you were born to love 
Isn't that person anymore 

This one's for you 
I love you, 
But you gotta change 

When you said that you would never change, 
Was it true 
Do it to save all we had 
Would you 
How could you give up 
How could you do that 
Why did you leave me 
And when you come back 
Spending all your time with him 
You can't even see me 

Selfish, what you is 
How you mistreated your own kids 
How could you do that 
I know we don't talk now 
How could you turn your back on me 
Now I'm walkin' out 

Cause I didn't do anything to hurt you 
Gave you the best that I can and it's true 
(baby) 
(I try and I still love you) 
(I still love you, but) 
I gotta move on with out you 
I should've moved on from the pain that I felt 
But I choose to love you, the shit that you had 
(baby) 
(I've learned to live without you) 
(that's something, that is the truth) 
It's better to live then love you 
(you) (you) (you) (you) (you) (you) (you) 
(yeah) 
(you) (you) (you) (you) 
It's better to live then love you 
(you) (you) (you) (you) (you) (you) (you) 
Love you 
(you)

But if your leavin' is that what you can do to your baby 
Cause I'm gunna' love you no matter what you were sayin' 
How could you turn away 
And forget those sunny days 
But were they the sunny days 
Or was it the game you played 

Dressed up little doll, that you've torn, it's messed up 
How can you be criticizing me when you fucked up 
I never made you cry 
I never told a lie 
That's all you do to me 
So what is you right about 

Cause I didn't do anything to hurt you 
I gave you the best that I can and it's true 
(baby) 
(I try and I still love you) 
(I still love you, but) 
I gotta move on without you 
I should've moved on from the pain that I felt 
But I choose to love you, the shit that you had 
(baby) 
(I've learned to live without you) 
(that's something, that is the truth) 
It's better to live then love you 
(you) (you) (you) (you) (you) (you) (you) (you) (you) (you) (you) 
It's better to live then love you 
(you) (you) (you) (you) 
Love you 
(you) (oh) 

Was I the screw up and you were the best mom 
I wasn't that perfect and you took the long road 
The road is reversing 
The tables are turning 
I didn't deserve it 
But thank god I'm learnin' 

I can just imagine what you're doing doing with your days 
Smokin' all your cares away and having a play date 
To bad I found out what you were really about 
I know it's good to take but momma I gotta say 

That I didn't do anything to hurt you 
I gave you the best that I can and it's true 
(baby) 
(I try and I still love you) 
(I still love you, but) 
I gotta move on without you 
I should've moved on from the pain that I felt 
But I choose to love you, the shit that you had 
(baby) 
(I've learned to live without you) 
(that's something, that is the truth) 
It's better to live then love you 

............
"Don't come to me when you need help, I'm not helping you...get your ass right out of my house"

Get outta my way 
Stressing me out 
Momma get outta my way 
You and your man can go live at your place 
(it's your life) 
It's all this shit I can't take 

Cause I didn't do anything to hurt you 
I gave you the best that I can and it's true 
(baby) 
(I try and I still love you) 
(I still love you, but) 
(ohh) 
I gotta move on without you 
(I gotta move on without you) 
I should've moved on from the pain that I felt 
But I choose to love you, the shit that you had 
(baby) 
(I've learned to live without you) 
(that's something, that is the truth) 
It's better to live then love you
