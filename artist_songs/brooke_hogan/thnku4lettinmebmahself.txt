Lookin at the brother
Sittin in the jail
My hump start to shakin
Readin on the map
Cherish start tapin
That you don't wanna die, yeah
We begin to argue
And I begin to cry

Oh, I want to thank you for lettin' me
Be myself again
Oh, Thank you for lettin' me
Be myself again

Steppin out the prison
Haters in my space
?... at my brother
Cameras in my face
Paris comin party
Paris comin party
She would never stay
Little things are on my mind
All along the way

Oh, I want to thank you for lettin' me
Be myself again
Oh, Thank you for lettin' me
Be myself again

Dance to the music
All night long
Everyday people
Sing a happy song
Mama's so happy
(Why you so happy, mama?)
Mama start to die
Papa still rollin'
You can make it if you try

Oh, I want to thank you for lettin' me
Be myself again
Oh, Thank you for lettin' me
Be myself again
