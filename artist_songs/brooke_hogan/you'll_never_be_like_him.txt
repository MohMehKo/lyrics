I wish you smiled like him and walked like him and talked like him
And only did as he did
I try to imagine him living in your skin but your not like him
So why do I even compare

I think about how it was then 
And how it was with him 
And I try to see all those quailtys living in you
But

Your nothing like the man I used to love
And you'll never do what he does
Cuz I relooked into find that the more I try to make you fit in
You'll never be like him
You'll never be like him
Never be, never be like him

I wish you kissed like him you felt like him and held like him
And touched me the way he did
I try to see his face in your place cuz I cant earse the way I felt when he was mine

I think about how it was then 
And how it was with him 
And I try to see all those quailtys living in you
But

Your nothing like the man I used to love
And you'll never do what he does
Cuz I relooked into find that the more I try to make you fit in
You'll never be like him

Theres no chance for the best 
Theres no way I will stay 
I wont always get what I want
But I'm not gonna settle for less 
I wanna go my own way 

Your nothing like the man I used to love
And you'll never do what he does
Cuz I relooked into find that the more I try to make you fit in
You'll never be like him

Your nothing like the man I used to love
And you'll never do what he does
Cuz I relooked into find that the more I try to make you fit in
You'll never be like him
You'll never be like him
