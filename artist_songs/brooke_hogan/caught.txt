Is it the moon, as full as it is
That's making me feel in love like this
I can't resist, what I feel inside of me
Can't let it hide in me, no no no
I tried to avoid feelin this way
I thought I could touch you again
But I was wrong but now I'm not alone
And I feel at home with you

I gotta stand up, I gotta shout it out
Cause I know he's the one, so hey, hey, hey
This is love inside my heart, there's no need to run
Cause I've been caught

How did you know just what to do, to make me let my gaurd down
For you, and I knew it as soon as you broke through
That I would fall for you, you got me out of control
I'm guessing you know what part you stole
I could'ntprotect it, love wouldn't let it maybe that's why I let you in

I gotta stand up, I gotta shout it out
Cause I know he's the one, so hey, hey, hey
This is love inside my heart, there's no need to run
Cause I've been caught
I gotta stand up, I gotta shout it out
Cause I know he's the one, so hey, hey, hey
This is love inside my heart, there's no need to run
Cause I've been caught

I wasn't thinking when I gazed into your eyes
You must of cast a spell cause you caught me by surprise
And you made me fall in love

I feel it boy, you feel it too
No need to run away from you

I gotta stand up, I gotta shout it out
Cause I know he's the one, so hey, hey, hey
This is love inside my heart, there's no need to run
Cause I've been caught
I gotta stand up, I gotta shout it out
Cause I know he's the one, so hey, hey, hey
This is love inside my heart, there's no need to run
Cause I've been caught
