"Umm,Hey Brooke,What's up, This is Hedi Montag,
I just wanna let you know, that I'm making a record
And your record better watch it's back
And if you think this Stack$ is awesome,

Sometimes Brooke, this shit just seems,
That everybody wants to discuse me
Chelsea Latley, got a thing for me
I don't know why that bitch hates me
Maybe it's the dreams that she has in bed   
And she thinks that you have a master head
I'll admit my head got its own adress
But your not gonna mind and I'll bust yours in
Jit Jit, tell me where you at
In that back that bitch on my lap
Hollywoods got your back in fact
I've done six shots in spencer pratt picture that
What cha gonna do

Sobe world is where we live fuck you
Its Judment Day and never been cool like that

And there's nothing I can do
I just wanna rock it out
And we from the south
We've got to pump it out
And there's nothing I can say
I'm gonna go my way
Just watch me rock
Wishin you could get that hot
Wishin you could get that hot
Wishin you could get that hot
