I can tell you see what you're liken'
This body-ody
Fought to hard and im
Fadin' to blink
Im feelin' like im ready to strike at
This party-arty
Boy im not as shy as you think

Oh oh
Baby
Dont you want to go
Somewhere
Somewhere beautiful
Put on our own private little show
But are you ready for me

[Chorus:]
Certified
All those things you want from me boyfriend
Certified
The only one you need to know
Certified

Show me an adventure tonight
Lay me on the city of dreams
Caress me and undress me
Come on lets start a fight
Heaven to the total extreme

Oh oh
Baby
Dont you want to go
Somewhere
Somewhere beautiful
Put on our own private little show
But are you ready for me

[Chorus:]
Certified
All those things you want from me boyfriend

My body is certified

Baby can you handle the inferno
Put it inside

All those things you want from me boyfriend

All those things you want from me boyfriend
