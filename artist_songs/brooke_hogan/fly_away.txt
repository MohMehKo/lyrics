A lucky me is nothing new
I open up my fridge
Damn I'm out of orange juice
I run my fingers through my hair
And I tell myself I got it all together
But I know I'm close to there
I wash my face and start to think
I'm putting all this make up on
Just to wash it down the sink

It's time for me to learn to live a little
Why can't it be today
I'm tired of leaving one foot in the middle
Break it free
Drop the chain
Catch the wind
Fly away
Fly away

Sometimes I never think of you
But who am I to try to kid
Yeah I still want you
So I throw myself into my work
And maybe fall in love again but with myself and not get hurt
It's just the same ol' song and dance
And if I'm gonna start the music
Well now's my chance

It's time for me to learn to live a little
Why can't it be today
I'm tired of leaving one foot in the middle
Break it free
Drop the chain
Catch the wind
Fly away

I'm gonna fly away
I'm gonna start today
I'm gonna spread my wings
I'm gonna change some things
I'm gonna fly away
I'm gonna fly

It's time for me to learn to live a little
Why can't it be today
I'm tired of leaving one foot in the middle
Break it free
Drop the chain
Catch the wind
Fly away
Fly away
Fly away
Fly away
