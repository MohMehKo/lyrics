Once I carved your name on a wall right next to mine
Put a heart around it and an arrow right through it
Thats how much I cared and we swore it would always be there
But its not anymore cuz
You said things and I heard it from friends
You did things that you want to again 

Your just an ex-boyfriend something from the past
Something so stupid I'll never look back 
Your just an ex-boyfriend I'll learn to forgive and forget when we fight
I'm already on to my next boyfriend
Your just an ex-boyfriend

Once I felt your love was a permenate thing
Put a ring around it and you cant break through it
Thats how much I knew and I swore it would always be you
But its not anymore cuz
You played me and baby that was so rude 
You played me but now its all cool

Your just an ex-boyfriend something I can live without
Something so stupid I'll never look back 
Your just an ex-boyfriend I'll learn to forgive and forget when we fight
I'm already on to my next boyfriend
Friend

So dont say that your sorry
Sorry's just a word you say to get a pass
I found somebody who makes me wanna hang around to see this last 

Your just an ex-boyfriend something from the past
Something so stupid I'll never look back 
Your just an ex-boyfriend I'll learn to forgive and forget when we fight
I'm already on to my next boyfriend
Something from the past
Something so stupid I'll never look back 
Your just an ex-boyfriend I'll learn to forgive and forget when we fight
I'm already on to my next boyfriend
Your just an ex-boyfriend
