[Brooke (Urban Mystic):]
Love is a funny thing (oh yes it is)
It can live through what people say 
The only thing I ask (what you ask?)
Is that you have some respect (I got it babe)

[Both:]
And please dont take 
My love away

[Urban:] yea 
[Brooke:] oooh 
[Urban:] oooh 
[Brooke:] yea

[Brooke (Urban):]
You can trust me (trust me)
I can trust you 
Baby I trust you
Baby we could fly away
oh whoa
Nothing matters cuz nothings better
Baby I will always stay

[Brooke:]
I cant believe that we're back to here
Must of been about a whole year
Suffering losing all my sleep
Cuz I didnt have you here

[Urban:]
I replay it a hundred times
Without you home it anit right
I know I prayed almost everyday
Lord give me back my life yea

[Brooke:]
I used to be scared of losing you
Would you be scared to lose me too?
No we never need to worry
Finally the truth will set us free
Now you know I never want to leave
You can be you and I can be me
You can trust me

I cant beleive that I'm not alone
To have you backs like having a home
Cuz I remember what you said to me
I ride for you you ride for me
We can be whatever you like
Best friends your by my side
Whatever you want is fine
All I want is you in my life
