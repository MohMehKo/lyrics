I took a walk through the fields on a sunny day
And saw a reflection of a face
Didn't notice the girl that looked at me
She was beautiful like an angel
She told me I shouldn't look so sad
He's the best friend I could ever have
There I go imaginaing things my minds running far away from me

Pinch me I'm dreaming in my mind I'm speed walking
And my lips keep on moving but I'm not barely sayin nothing
Could it be could it be just me or is it appetite
Somebody catch me I'm falling there I go again there I go again

I met a man the other day said I remind him of his daughter
He just staired into my face and could I trade him in for water
He's thristy got a hundred miles to go there I go
Pretending to be somewhere that I've never been before

Pinch me I'm dreaming in my mind I'm speed walking
And my lips keep on moving but I'm not barely sayin nothing
Could it be could it be just me or is it appetite
Somebody catch me I'm falling there I go again there I go again

Pinch me I'm dreaming in my mind I'm speed walking
And my lips keep on moving but I'm not barely sayin nothing
Could it be could it be just me or is it appetite
Somebody catch me I'm falling there I go again there I go again

I see the place that I've been lookin for
There's no invision no winning sometimes
Like a fairytale where I control all the lines
All that matters is me and I'm completely free

Pinch me I'm dreaming in my mind I'm speed walking
And my lips keep on moving but I'm not barely sayin nothing
Could it be could it be just me or is it appetite
Somebody catch me I'm falling there I go again there I go again

Pinch me I'm dreaming in my mind I'm speed walking
And my lips keep on moving but I'm not barely sayin nothing
Could it be could it be just me or is it appetite
Somebody catch me I'm falling there I go again
