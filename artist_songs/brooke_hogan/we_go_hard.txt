[Hollywood Jit:]
Its getting money time for mr. hollywood jit
Book of rymes illmatic knows this shit sick
Your old lady loves the way I spit crack pipes
I bark loud move the crowds with the bitches life
Thers a lot of new niggers stepping in the game
Gots to keep it real though there names are lil wyanes
Get your own styles though and get off mr. carters
I'm in my own closet now thats a starter 
I wear my own kicks with a wicked jump shot
I be the B.I.G. and the only 2 pac
I cant forget big pun and the nigger big L
Easy E too how I leave your gel swell
Im L thought I couldnt cut it so southern dont care
Rockin with my only fierce name catching weight getting cocky on these peasents
Throw my sentence niggers like boom

You gotta be a good girl just to hold em down
But if you anit bad it anit enough to keep em around
And if you good girl holdin him back 
You gotta be a bad bitch to hold a man like stack$
You gotta know how to love know when to turn
Through off the cuff know how to cope
Yea a good girl just wasnt enough 
If you cant go hard then dont even come

[Stack$:]
She's alunium hottie columinottie on wax 
The only difference between us is the way that we act
You a spoiled ass brat up in the hollywood hills you in drag
You anit no singer your a wannabe like Hedid Montag 
The only thing that I grab bad bitches enough
I need a ride or die prept to die in jail with cuffs
Just like Eve a nasty freak to film in the scene
Now with Chris Brown the poporazzi following me
So live your life the afterlife is no pretend 
Feeling of ODing twice hearing am spin from am to pm 
My mind is off the deep end traveling outta space 
Redeming is not a pre tense searching and we will seeking 
Stacks is not to mad he just getting paid so we stunting like a addie
Focas get on me touch the crome 45 lets introduce some pop b life

With my glass slippers like a fucking cinderella
