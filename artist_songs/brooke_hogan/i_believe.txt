I'm a good girl, I don't have to act bad,
To meet the standards, that other people have.
I just love me for me, I'm what you see,
My personality, and my body.

I'm never gonna make you believe, yeah,
That something else is, really me.

I believe in someday, someway.
I believe I can make a change.
I believe in that girl, hey world,
I can play every game you play.
I believe in this voice, this choice,
I believe in positivity.
I believe in this life, this fight,
Then again, I believe in me.
I believe, yeah. I believe.

I am truthful, I'm healthy and pure.
Nothing can make me feel insecure.
I've got my own beliefs, good energy,
And the strength in me, that's all I need.

I'm never gonna make you believe, yeah,
That something else is really me.

I believe in someday, someway.
I believe I can make a change.
I believe in that girl, hey world,
I can play every game you play.
I believe in this voice, this choice,
I believe in positivity.
I believe in this life, this fight,
Then again, I believe in me.

Inside, outside, your head let you down side baby.
Turn on that radio, and laugh your cares away.
I'm like, don't stay back, let them cry,
At a stop sign on the corner of vine,
Ain't nothing in my way.
I'll make you say, yeah,

I believe in that girl, hey world,
I can play every game you play.
I believe in this voice, this choice,
I believe in positivity,
I believe in this life, this fight,
Then again, I believe in me.
I believe.
