Oh today, will you please be
A different way then you are usally
Hey today, will you stand out
Or will you take the same ol route

Color the skies
Four walls are high
Stuck in the middle
Of a trudgin' riddle
But I...

I don't really care for it
Don't wanna be a victum of it
I just need one unordinary day
Break away from this routine
Wake me up from this bad dream
Can I just live one extraordinary day

Extraordinary Day

Hey tomorrow, don't be simple
Give me a shift even if it's just a little
Please provide a change in the time
Cause I can't live one more day in this boring life

Color the skies
Four walls are high
Stuck in the middle
Of a trudgin' riddle
But I...

I don't really care for it
Don't wanna be a victum of it
I just need one unordinary day
Break away from this routine
Wake me up from this bad dream
Can I just live one extraordinary day

Why do you gotta be identicly the same?
All I want (yea) all I need (yea) is just one change
Then I'm happy
Please will you give it to me
Send it my way
Just one Extraordinary Day

I don't really care for it
Don't wanna be a victum of it
I just need one unordinary day
Break away from this routine
Wake me up from this bad dream
Can I just live one extraordinary day

Yea yea extraordinary day
Extraordinary day
Extraordinary day
