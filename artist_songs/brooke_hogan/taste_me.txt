Chillin in the bar 
And I'm in the mood 
You kinda got me feelin like you
You're damn lookin good
Better walk this way I'll take
Take advantage of you
I know it's sad I'm goin home alone
Gonna have to take you with me
I'm gonna go fast better get in the back 
Cuz baby uhh

I think that I'm in love
But I don't know enough
The influence is hot
You almost got me lost
Some feelin drunk into another song
I can't control myself

You really wanna know (taste me) [x3]

Thought you were sweet
Wanted just a piece now tell me baby what would I say
What, you ain't makin since
Confused up in ya head
Drinks got you acting this way
I think that I'm in love
But I don't know enough
The influence is hot
You almost got me lost
Some feelin drunk into another song
I can't control myself

You really wanna know (taste me) [x3]
You really wanna know (taste me) [x3]
Lemme break it down now [x3]
Here we go
Stay with the beat me

(taste me)
Won't you taste me
I'm so tasty

I think that I'm in love
But I don't know enough
The influence is hot
You almost got me lost
Some feelin drunk into another song
I can't control myself
