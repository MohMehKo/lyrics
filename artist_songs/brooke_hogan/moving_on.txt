Hey baby we need to talk
You know normally I wouldnt even talk to guys
I'd just dump em
But I just wanna let you know you've changed
And your not my problem anymore

You've changed my life 
You rocked my world
You swept me off of my feet
You raised me up just to knock me down
You pulled the love from under me
You were so romantic so persistent
And then to only leave
Now your so predictive I'm tired of missing
What I thought we could be

Now baby I'm 
I'm over I'm so over you boy
Kicked out now I'm moving on to better
I could suck at this all you did was lie to me (ur so wrong)
And now I'm over you 

Ive tried to change your ways
But you shut me down you slammed the door in my face
I had an open heart til you broke it apart dont want no more
I got a taste boy cuz you were so romantic so persistent
And then to only leave
Now your so predictive I'm tired of missing
What I thought we could be

I'm over I'm so over you boy
Kicked out now I'm moving on to better
I could suck at this all you did was lie to me (ur so wrong)
And now I'm over you and now im over you

I'm over I'm so over you boy
Kicked out now I'm moving on to better
I could suck at this all you did was lie to me (ur so wrong)
And now I'm over you and now im over you
