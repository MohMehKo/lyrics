You're havin' sweet dreams in the morning
I've got you losing yourself right in front of me
I know you wanna tap it
You boys are all so nasty
Feelin' the wrong thing
I'm makin' you have sweet dreams

I know something about you
That you don't think that I know
Yeah, I know something about you
That you didn't mean to show
O-oh, late while you were sleeping
I woke up all alone
I saw something so appealing
I'm gonna make getting' mine for sure

You're havin' sweet dreams in the morning
I've got you losing yourself right in front of me
I know you wanna tap it
You boys are all so nasty
Feelin' the wrong thing
I'm makin' you have sweet dreams

I wanna tuck you in,
Kiss you goodnight, and
I'll leave the money for your troubles on the nitestand
I'm not your night man, I'm just you bought a dream
And I can do so makes you that can make you scream
And now I got you where I want you to have me baby
When I see your face, it just turns me on
Even if I don't fall asleep, I don't wanna wake up
'Cause sometimes I get stuck

You're havin' sweet dreams in the morning
I've got you losing yourself right in front of me
I know you wanna tap it
You boys are all so nasty
Feelin' the wrong thing
I'm makin' you have sweet dreams

I want you standin' there in attention baby
(I got you standin' baby)
And I'mma drop and give you twenty baby
(I wanna drop that on ya)
Don't you worry 'bout protection baby
(I got protection baby)
'Cause I'll clean up the mess we're makin'

I want you standin' there in attention baby
And I'mma drop and give you twenty baby
Don't you worry 'bout protection baby
'Cause I'll clean up the mess we're makin'

You're havin' sweet dreams in the morning
I've got you losing yourself right in front of me
I know you wanna tap it
You boys are all so nasty
Feelin' the wrong thing
I'm makin' you have sweet dreams

Sweet dreams in the morning
I've got you losing yourself right in front of me
I know you wanna tap it
You boys are all so nasty
Feelin' the wrong thing
I'm makin' you have sweet dreams
