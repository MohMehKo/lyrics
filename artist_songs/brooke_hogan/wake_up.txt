Don't you tell me that this is the end
The end of our story
Been meaning so long to find out
What we are
But what have we left to prove
There's no more mystery
Nothing is cute anymore, anymore
Gave up so much time baby (uh huh)
Wheres our rewarding (uh huh)
Being in love shouldnt feel like a chore

I tried so hard to walk away
But I cant let you go
The things that we go through cuz of love
I should realize its over (cant you see)
This fantasy's turning into a bad dream
And I just wanna wake up
Wanna wake up

I tried so hard to be kind
Keeping my composure
To see if ya'd wait 
Where I would when I could
Comunication block on a dull road to nowhere
Our seperate ways wont get us where we wanna go
We cant go on baby (uh huh)
Feeding this torture (uh huh)
Being in love shouldnt feel like a chore

I tried so hard to walk away
But I cant let you go
The things that we go through cuz of love
I should realize its over (cant you see)
This fantasy's turning into a bad dream
And I just wanna wake up
Wanna wake up

You were all I needed
Now your all I'm leaving
I just cant go back
No...

The things that we go through cuz of love
I should realize its over (cant you see)
This fantasy's turning into a bad dream
And I just wanna wake up
Wanna wake up

The things
Love 
Over
