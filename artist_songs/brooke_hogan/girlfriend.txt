Now did you know
I lose it when you're looking at me
Passing cause you're something that I just can't get enough of
I wanna show what you don't even know you're missing
Lips are looking awesome and my kiss would love to touch them
Now I'm a mess
Freaking red, â€˜cause you like to keep me hanging
You just left, sending text
Said tonight was so amazing

And there you go
Making me feel beautiful
I wanna know
Am I the one you're looking for
Driving kids
Falling in, wondering
Don't wanna be just friends
Boy, I wanna be your girlfriend

Now this could be
The kind of thing you see in movies
I could be your reader lady
You can draw and get me baby
Such a tease, why can't we stop and call it what it is
I want you, you want me
Searching for a life with you

And there you go
Making me feel beautiful
I wanna know
Am I the one you're looking for
Driving kids
Falling in, wondering
Don't wanna be just friends
Boy, I wanna be your girlfriend

You can buy me lobster
Teddy bear, pretty roses
Just a little no and I would know that you wanna be my boyfriend

And there you go
Making me feel beautiful
I wanna know
Am I the one you wanna gold
Driving kids
Falling in, wondering
Don't wanna be just friends
Boy

Cause there you go
Making me feel beautiful
I wanna know
Am I the one you wanna gold
Driving kids
Falling in, wondering
Don't wanna be just friends
Or just be another girl
Boy, I wanna be your girlfriend
And you could be my boyfriend
And I could be your girlfriend
