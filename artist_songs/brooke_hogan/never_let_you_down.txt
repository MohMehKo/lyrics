What a pitaful thing to do to someone like you
I know you may be hesitent to try love again
But I understand, but if you give it a go again
I will be your best friend

Boy I know you've been hurt before
But I promise you no more
Cross my heart babe

Cause I am the one that you can trust
Cause I wanna show you love

To get through to you

Actions can speak louder than words
So I gotta show you this can work
That girl wasn't right for you
She can't do what I can do
So I won't let her take this song that I play to you and only you
You don't have to be afraid
You and I were simply made to be together
I won't hurt you I'll love you forever cause

Are deeper than oceans blue

But baby who knew

Hold my hands, we're face to face
Cause I'm so sensire that I wanna keep showing I care
