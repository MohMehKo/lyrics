Baby come with me (you'll get so high)
Promise I'll be so fly (boy just let me take you there)
Where you wanna be? lying next to me
It's my only fantasy (boy just let me take you into the sky)

Where you wanna be
Your so close to me
Never been so close to me
It's making me I'll
I wish that I could take your hand
I wish...
It's making me weak
Come with me now

Late in the night you'll be coming around
Don't be turning on the lights I'll be turning them down
Your making me sweat I'm feeling my skin
Your powers over me

Baby come with me (you'll get so high)
Promise I'll be so fly (boy just let me take you there)
Where you wanna be? lying next to me
It's my only fantasy (boy just let me take you into the sky)

Yea (uh)
My eyes are wrapped around
Every part of you
Watching all of you
Trying to be still
But baby I can wait only so long
Please don't make it too long
Cause I've been waiting here

Baby come with me (you'll get so high)
Promise I'll be so fly (boy just let me take you there)
Where you wanna be? lying next to me
It's my only fantasy (boy just let me take you into the sky)

Baby let me take you
I just can't (uh uh uh)
It's alright cause I'll be waiting here

Baby come with me (you'll get so high)
Promise I'll be so fly (boy just let me take you there)
Where you wanna be? lying next to me
It's my only fantasy (boy just let me take you into the sky)
