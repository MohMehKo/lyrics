They cant stop us

This is my redemption
Nothing left but to forgive you
After all the shit thats happend
My heart is broken my head is confused
But I will, I will keep marchin on
A phoenix rising up to heaven
So I guess I'll see you around
Its the beging a redemption

So god can you hear me
All my people can you hear me
All my haters can you hear me
You cant stop me oh no no no no
Nothing can stop me
So dont let it stop you
Negativity and hate have tried to take me down
But I rise above

Like a phoenix rising
I will rise above
Like a poor man crying
I'm gonna change my luck
No one No one can tell you how to live your life
Baby and no one no one could ever phantom all the striff
Yea oh 

So god can you hear me
Mom and daddy can you hear me
All my lovers can you hear me
They couldnt stop me oh no no no no 
Oh no no no no

With good vibrations
The happyness, success
