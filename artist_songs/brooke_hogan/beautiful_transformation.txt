A beautiful transformation
Not enough
Woe oh
Trackstar
Let's go

The older I get
The more I get feelings I can't explain
Can't explain
Mostly in the city of the 99% I did not say
I've suddenly evolved
From nothing at all
To somewhat ladylike
My clothes began to fit
And jeans they hug my hips
To catch the young boys eyes

Adolescent
I feel suppression
Many questions
Still I'm guessin'
The pressure's on
Fascination
It's that beautiful transformation
Like a butterfly
Changin' into my old skin
Where the tears I cry
Got a lighter side to it
It's a beautiful transformation

It's gettin' harder to reject
Opportunities
I meant to take it further now
I'm feelin' wonderful sensations
It's my body's revelation
It's another world

I've suddenly revised
I can't keep hold of what's inside anymore
It's never in the day
But always late at night
That these feelings occur
That these feelings occur

Adolescent
I feel suppression
Many questions
Still I'm guessin'
The pressure's on
Fascination
It's that beautiful transformation
Like a butterfly
Changin' into my old skin
Where the tears I cry
Got a lighter side to it
It's a beautiful transformation

Now I can shake my hips
With the confidence
Knowin' that I control what I got
Is priceless
Every little part that I have of me
Is precious
It's that beautiful transformation

Like a butterfly
Changin' into my old skin
Where the tears I cry
Got a lighter side to it
It's a beautiful transformation
Like a butterfly
Changin' into my old skin
Where the tears I cry
Got a lighter side to it
It's a beautiful transformation
I'm it
It's that beautiful transformation
Beautiful transformation
I'm it
It's that beautiful transformation
I'm in
