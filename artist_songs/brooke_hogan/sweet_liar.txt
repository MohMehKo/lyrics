So sweet, sweet
Sweet, sweet lover
You are my one desire
Just caught ya pants on fire
Baby

You feel like turing it up
Keep, keep hiding your secrets little liar
Got me so on fire
Baby

It feels like, it feels like
I'm gunna tell you something that I think you already know
I'm something special and I don't believe in your circle of hope
I'm really nice but that doesn't mean I don't know how to fight
Fuckin around only makes the consequences tight

If you take the quite route I might just start a riot
I'm good at playing nice but your heart is made of ice

If you take the quite route I might just start a riot
I'm good at playing nice but your heart is made of ice

Sweet, sweet lover
You are my one desire

Baby

It feels like, It feels like
Laalalalalalaalalalala

My intuition tells me something bout yous kinda hot
Cause when we're freakin' it's 10 minutes or 2 minutes top
I know I rock my shit so now I know it's not my fault
So what's your big excuse you take to too many girls

If you take the quite route I might just start a riot
I'm good at playing nice but your heart is made of ice

Your tearing my heart
You play with my head
You strung me out
You roll in my bed
You make me feeling wild again
I gave you my love
You gave me your heart
I know it's enough but I don't know why
I'm on fire you stupid liar
