I want you, I need you, I love you, I feel you, my baby

I think about you, I get so high
This feeling I'm feeling, I want you tonight
Goin crazy I must be insane
Your all I think about night and day
Doesnt matter where you are, Cause I can reach you even from afar

I want you, I need you, I love you, I feel you, my baby
Way down deep in my heart
I want you, I need you, I love you, my baby

Am I just dreaming, or am I living a perfect life
It's not that I'm leaning, it's not just a part of a clever disguise
Goin crazy out of my mind, you give me lovin' that is hard to find
Doesn't matter where you are, cause I can reach you even from afar

I want you, I need you, I love you, I feel you, my baby
Way down deep in my heart
I want you, I need you, I love you, my baby
Listen to the beat of my heart

With every living moment I breathe (way down deep in my heart)
I wanna tell you that I'm thankful to the face who sent you to me

I want you, I need you, I love you, I feel you, my baby
I want you, I need you, I love you, I feel you, my baby
Way down deep in my heart
I want you, I need you, I love you, my baby
Listen to the beat of my heart

I want you, I need you, I love you, I feel you, my baby
Way down deep in my heart
I want you, I need you, I love you, my baby
Listen to the beat of my heart

I want you, I need you, I love you, I feel you, my baby
