You and I, we're the same
Just
Build the walls in a different way
You say we're friends
But that's a lie
We're both shakin everytime
Um
Across the room
Keep a distance
Cause we feel closed and shy
Don't you think it's time we listened to the signs

[Chorus:]
I see it in your eyes
I feel it in your hands
We can move a million ways that words don't understand.
It's easy to mess up
But baby it's enough
Cause I can't think of anything but getting tangled

Take my hand
Walk me home
Aren't you tired of being cold to me baby
My walls are down
My skin is thin
Cause I love you
I'll always let you win
Across the room
Keep a distance, yeah
But don't you think it's time we listen to the signs

[Chorus:]
I see it in your eyes
I feel it in your hands
We can move a million ways that words don't understand
It's easy to mess up
But baby it's enough
Cause I can't think of anything but getting tangled

Oh in this room
All through the night
Tangled inside
Till I can't move without you next to me

[Chorus:]
I see it in your eyes
I feel it in your hands
We can move a million ways that words don't understand
It's easy to mess up
But baby it's enough
Cause I can't think of anything but getting tangled in you

I see it in your eyes
I feel it in your hands
We can move a million ways that words don't understand
It's easy to mess up
But baby it's enough
Cause I can't think of anything but getting tangled in you
