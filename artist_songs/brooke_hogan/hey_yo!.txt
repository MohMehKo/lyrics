Ohh ohh ohh

Some say love and friends they don't mix
But I can't help the way that I feel (a yo)
Seeing you makes me think (Hey yo)
Seeing you makes me think (Oh woo Ho)
I know you and me it seems weird
But I think we should consider it (Hey yo)
Seeing you makes me think (Hey Yo)
Seeing you makes me think

Your smile is like candy
So sweet and sincere
Your style is so sexy
I love when your near
Our vibe is like heaven
You and I are like wind
So cool it's refreshing
Where do I begin

[Bridge:]
Me and you would be like Christmas Day
Cause when you smile you shine like the month of may
But there's no rush we'll take our time okay
But I had to let you know
Just incase it didn't show

[Chorus:]
Some say love and friends they don't mix
But I can't help the way I feel (a yo)
Seeing you makes me think (hey yo)
Seeing you makes me think (Oh woo Ho)
I know you and me it seems weird
But I think we should consider it (Hey yo)
Seeing you makes me think (Hey Yo)
Seeing you makes me think

[Colby:]
I ain't felt this way in a minute.
You and me, are you wit it?
Yes, cause I only got eyes for you
Cause you know that I'd ride for you
I know you won't suffer. with me as your man
I promise to show you the love that I can win

[Bridge:]
Me and you would be like Christmas Day
Cause when you smile you shine like the month of May
But there's no rush we'll take our time okay
But I had to let you know
Just incase it didn't show

[Chorus:]
Some say love and friends they don't mix
But I can't help the way I feel (a yo)
Seeing you makes me think (hey yo)
Seeing you makes me think (Oh woo Ho)
I know you and me it seems weird
But I think we should consider it (Hey yo)
Seeing you makes me think (Hey Yo)
Seeing you makes me think

I ain't felt this way in a minute
I ain't felt this way in a minute.

[Chorus: x2]
Some say love and friends they don't mix
But I can't help the way that I feel (a yo)
Seeing you makes me think (hey yo)
Seeing you makes me think (Oh woo Ho)
I know you and me it seems weird
But I think we should consider it (Hey yo)
Seeing you makes me think (Hey Yo)
Seeing you makes me think
