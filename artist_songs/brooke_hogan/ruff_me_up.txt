Yeah, Woah

Baby you dont know the girl thats comin out of me
I dont recognize this love, I want it ruff you see
Boy you know we love each other, always pleasin' one another
But I have just one request
Pull my hair and make me sweat

Do it baby baby, fill the curiosity,
Hold me down so im feelin' the strong velocity
Throw me up against the wall
Roll around until we fall
Boy Im bout to shut you up,
just want you to ruff me up.

[Chorus]
So ruff me up, up baby
cause I'm so tough baby
and your so hot I dont wanna stop, stop
so ruff me up up baby
cause your so tough baby
and I'm ready to go
so get me down on the floor
baby ruff me up, up up up up up up
ruff me up up up up up
baby ruff me up up up up up up up
ruff me up up up up up

I dont wanna be sweet cause I know that its mediocrity 
You're the one that I want and I need so baby explore me
Pull my hair go down my back
Arch me up and make me crack
Honey you know that im fallin' for you
Let it release somethin I wanna do

I cant wait to later baby want you more and more
Im about to jump you when your walking through the door.
Pushin forward, first a fight,
Keep me up till mornin' light
Boy im about to shut you up
Just want you to rough me up.

[Chorus]
So ruff me up, up baby
cause im so tough baby
and your so hot I dont wanna stop, stop
so ruff me up up baby
cause your so tough baby
and im ready to go
so get me down on the floor
baby ruff me up, up up up up up up
ruff me up up up up up
baby ruff me up up up up up up up
ruff me up up up up up

Hey hey, hey shorty whats your ingredients
wet my appetite like I'm rollin stones
tongue hangin' out of my mouth every time my taste buds get in that zone
lookin' for flavor I need that recipe 
whoa a playa leavin' my legacy
Lickin that plate up, shes a delicacy.
After I cater, date her, oops I ate her.

Such a lovable hurt 
Strawberry topping lets make it dessert
play with the moneybags under your skirt
I heard they got cash there I said it first 
im trying to bag all those calories 
tickle miss kitty that's above your knees
L.I.C. licky whatchu like in me
leave a hickey where nobody can see

[Chorus]
So ruff me up, up baby
cause im so tough baby
and your so hot I dont wanna stop, stop
so ruff me up up baby
cause your so tough baby
and im ready to go
so get me down on the floor
baby ruff me up, up up up up up up
ruff me up up up up up
baby ruff me up up up up up up up
ruff me up up up up up
