We're inches apart but are you miles away from getting what I want?
With so little time and all these feelings for you it's unexplainable

Don't you feel like having me
Take on you a ride
Doing this of syncronize, body touching mine
Arch your back let it flow
Take me where I wanna go
Just take your time and put your lips on mine

(Oh oh) I think I want you now
(Oh yeah) I think I'm goin crazy
(Oh oh) gotta have you now
(Oh yeah) I want you so bad lately
I want you so bad lately

Pushin the limit and were breakin the tension
That used to hold us back
It's not overrated it's what we created
You're an aphrosisiac

Don't' you feel like having me
Take you on a ride
Doing this of syncronize, body touching mine
Arch your back and let it flow
Take me where I wanna go
Just take your time and put you lips on mine

(Oh oh) I think I want you now
(Oh yeah) I think I'm goin crazy
(Oh oh) Gotta have you now
(Oh yeah) I want you so bad lately

I don't wanna push the subject baby
But I just want your lovin
This harmony we cans set it free
All we need is you and me
I want you so bad, so bad

(Oh oh) I think I want you now
(Oh yeah) I think I'm goin crazy
(Oh oh) Gotta have you now
(Oh yeah) I want you so bad lately
