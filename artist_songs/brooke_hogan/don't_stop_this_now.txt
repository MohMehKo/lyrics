Didn't know at the time that I hurt you
Never meant anything but to love you
Wanna kiss wanna hug wanna hold you
But your mad at me

Hoping we still got a freindship
So you and I won't end this
I'm serious not pretending
Honey

I'm not gonna lie I didn't trust in you
I was a fool but

It's hard to breathe I can't take it
Boy if you leave I won't make it
Came to far to just break it
So baby
Please don't stop this now
Still the one that I'm wanting
I'm sorry that your still hurting
This situations so crazy
So baby
Please don't stop this now

Paranoia's got the best of me
I thought you was a cheat
But your not, I can't believe I thought that
Now I'm sorry that you had to see
My insecuritys
Yea I'm feeling bad

I'm not gonna lie I didn't trust in you
I was a fool but

It's hard to breathe I can't take it
Boy if you leave I won't make it

Before I knew what was the truth
Sorry hun I jumped the gun
Thought you were bad but I'm the one

Went to the club and played me babe
But you were good and now your crushed
Cause you thought you had my trust
