Flashing lights, the tensions high
What have I got myself in to?
So exposed the life I chose, but I know what I gotta do
Put my game face on now that I got em watching
You can gossip talk about me cause I'm an easy target
I got my passion to make it happen
It was only a matter of time
My reputation stress I'm facing excpectation's so high
Your adicted just admit it I'm an eye candy that you like
This world is to make sure I'm hurt I know it's just my time

I've been wanting this life since the get-go
I'm rockin the thigh high stilettos
Partying all night with celbo's
Living my life like a slideshow
My lifes confidential
Everything I breathe is parental
Every move I make is assential
As I'm living my life like slideshow

It's hard to think it's hard to take
When everythings at steak the whole wide world can see
Photographs the magazines invade my privacy
But I survive it all after they said I would trip and fall
Rolling oppertunity and I won't just let it pass me be

I got my passion to make it happen
It was only a matter of time
My reputation stress I'm facing excpectation's so high
Your adicted just admit it I'm an eye candy that you like
This world is to make sure I'm hurt I know it's just my time

I've been wanting this life since the get-go
I'm rockin the thigh high stilettos
Partying all night with celbo's
Living my life like a slideshow
My lifes confidential
Everything I breathe is parental
Every move I make is assential
As I'm living my life like slideshow

I just gotta find my meaning
All these lies are so deciveing
Wondering where is this leading
But I know I'm gonna find my own

I've been wanting this life since the get-go
I'm rockin the thigh high stilettos
Partying all night with celbo's
Living my life like a slideshow
My lifes confidential
Everything I breathe is parental
Every move I make is assential
As I'm living my life like slideshow
