Met you in the park, didn't have a clue
I remember
I never can relist you who were in school
Guess your part of the in-crowed
You made me wanna smile without trying
You paid attention
Now I have a frown cause you had bad intentions

I thought I coulda been the love of your life
I was so wrong
You had to be typical and tell lies
Now I sing this song

I put my trust in you
And you thought you had it all
But now you don't have it anymore

Baby you, your never gonna get that chance again
I'm talkin to you, everything we had is pretend
I thought you, was the one I considered friend
Now my broken heart has got to mend, because of you
Because of you

Ten days went by, you never even called me
I wondered if it was me, but I knew it all along
My friends warned me about you
And I didn't even listen
You had me caught up in you

So where do we go now?, can you tell me how
Cause this is love gone wrong
Heaven please give me a sign, I want to start feelin fine
Cause now I'm going out my mind, cause

Baby you, your never gonna get that chance again
I'm talkin to you, everything we had is pretend
I thought you, was the one I considered friend
Now my broken heart has got to mend, because of you
Because of you
Yea yea oh...

Could it be that my mind played tricks on me?
Cause my daddy taught me better, yes he did
I shoulda seen it comming and started walkin away
From you that day why did I stay
But now look what you did...

Baby you, your never gonna get that chance again
I'm talkin to you, everything we had is pretend
I thought you, was the one I considered friend
Now my broken heart has got to mend, because of you
Baby you, your never gonna get that chance again
I'm talkin to you, everything we had is pretend
I thought you, was the one I considered friend
Now my broken heart has got to mend,
I thought you, was the one I considered friend
Now my broken heart has got to mend, because of you
Because of you
