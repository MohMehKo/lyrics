I'm afraid of the dark
So he turns on the light
How does he know whats in my head
Why I cry, when it rains
He doesnt make me explain
He just drys me off
And puts me to bed

But it feels good cuz he knows me by heart
And it feels right, dont want it to stop
He knows what I'm like, and he knows what I'm not
He knows everything about me
He knows everything about me
He knows me by heart

And that scar on my arm
He guessed where I got it from
What I love and what I just can't stand
And he waits when I'm late
Doesn't try to set me straight
He takes me just the way I am

But it feels good
Cuz he knows me by heart
It feels right
Dont want it to stop
He knows what I'm like
And he knows what I'm not
He knows everything about me
He knows everything about me
He knows me by heart

He sees all
Don't know how he sees through
He sees my black and white
He sees my black and blue
I really don't know why
I dont have a clue
But who he thinks I am
Is who I am, its true

He's sees all
And he sees through
He sees my black and my blue
Dont know why, its true

But it feels good 
Cuz he knows me by heart
And it feels right, 
Dont want it to stop
He knows what I'm like, 
And he knows what I'm not
He knows everything about me
He knows everything about me
He knows me
But it feels good 
Cuz he knows me by heart
And it feels right, 
Dont want it to stop
He knows what I'm like 
And he knows what I'm not
He knows everything about me
He knows everything about me
He knows me by heart
But it feels good 
And it feels right, 
Dont want it to stop
He knows what I'm like 
And he knows what I'm not
He knows everything about me
He knows everything about me
He knows me, by heart
