So I'm sittin here
Guess I'm just another
I wont cry a tear it wont make it better
Cant keep holdin' on
She'll forget about you
But now that your gone have to live without you

I was just another girl to you
You had me beleaving I was your baby
And I was so lucky
But I cant be mad at you
Cuz I shouldve known better to give my heart away
yea yea 
To a heart, heart breaker

No more cryin here you just left me broken
You say you dont care so the door is closing
And I'll tell you off but my heart wont even
Cuz I want your love but I have to leave it

I was just another girl to you
You had me beleaving I was your baby
And I was so lucky
But I cant be mad at you
Cuz I shouldve known better to give my heart away
yea yea 
To a heart, heart breaker

Yous a faker heart breaker
Wont bring me down no more
Gotta show ya I'm alright
Lose these strings and cut you off
Yous a faker heart breaker
Wont bring me down no more
Gotta show ya I'm alright
Lose these strings and cut you off

You had me beleaving I was your baby
And I was so lucky
But I cant be mad at you
