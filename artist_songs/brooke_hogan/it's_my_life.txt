I can do anything
Theres nothing in my way
I can say anything
Dont care what people think
Yea

It's my life
Now I'm here 
I always wanted to feel free
It's my life
I dont care
And it sure feels good

{do do do do...}
You can say anything
Theres nothing it will change
Oh yea
And I'm feeling everything
But then I cant complain
Yea

It's my life
Now I'm here 
I always wanted to feel free
It's my life
I dont care
And it sure feels good

I'm caught up in a world
Knowing people never change
Yea there crazy going round thinking they can stand in my way
And they think they can stop me from living my way
Oh not never oh not never
Not today

It's my life
Now I'm here
I always wanted to feel free
It's my life
I dont care
And it sure feels good

It's my life
Now I'm here 
I always wanted to feel free
It's my life
I dont care
And it sure feels good

It's my life
Now I'm here 
I always wanted to feel free
It's my life
I dont care
And it sure feels good
