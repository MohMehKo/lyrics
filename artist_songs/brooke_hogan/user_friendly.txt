{No I don't think I'm gonna be able to make it, ok bye.
Man they always want something, using but their so nice about it}

Hey what you claim to fame how about thinkin bout droppin my name
Telling everybody that your my bestfriend
If your loving if your feelin don't say it again
Hey I don't like to flirt, wanna go to the crib and chill after work
Got a lot of free things don't need anymore
If you can't understand let me give ya the word

That means
No more ridin'
No more super styling
No more grubbin' on me
That's how I'm making it be
No more free connections
No more cruel intentions
No more grubbin on me
Cause my food isn't for free

All those boys that just wanna get down
All them friends that be sticking around
Your just a user (you won't get no love from me)
All them clubs that be dropping my beat
All them girls that be glaring at me
Your just a user (you won't get no love from me)

Poppin bottles in the club
Drinking all the bubbly up
Cause your a user (yea)
Your loving getting all this stuff
Think you might just be enough
But your a user and users don't show love

That means
No more ridin'
No more super styling
No more grubbin' on me
That's how I'm making it be
No more free connections
No more cruel intentions
No more grubbin on me
Cause my food isn't for free

All those boys that just wanna get down
All them friends that be sticking around
Your just a user (you won't get no love from me)
All them clubs that be dropping my beat
All them girls that be glaring at me
Your just a user (you won't get no love from me)

{Haha all these people don't think I know what's up,
But I know, all the times I was so good to you, bought you nice shit, Fuck you!, yea I said it}

Your a user
And users don't show love

All those boys that just wanna get down
All them friends that be sticking around
Your just a user (you won't get no love from me)
All them clubs that be dropping my beat
All them girls that be glaring at me
Your just a user (you won't get no love from me)
