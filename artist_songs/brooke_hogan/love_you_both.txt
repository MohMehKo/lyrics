I am in your love & custody
When I go out at night you still put trust in me
I need your arms to cover me but not smoother me
You cannot shelter me from the world
And I'll always be your little girl
He can never be what you are to me
You're the biggest part of me
(But I love him too)

You ever just wanna stumble & fall
Not knowing if you're ever gonna get caught
Ever wish everything was your fault
My heart has room for him too
Don't make me loose him to you

Daddy please don't make me choose between the two.
Daddy he's no comparison to you.
Don't make me choose, don't make me choose.
It'll always be me & you.
But what I want most is a way to love you both.

Baby I promise to make it work
It's sad but I gotta tear my heart in half who do I prefer
It's so unfair but I can't win. I try but I just fail.
I can't wait I just can't keep this to myself.

You ever just wanna stumble & fall
Not knowing if you're ever gonna get caught
Ever wish everything was your fault
My heart has room for him too
Don't make me loose him to you

Daddy please don't make me choose between the two.
Daddy he's no comparison to you.
Don't make me choose, don't make me choose.
It'll always be me & you.
But what I want most is a way to love you both.

I just want a way to love at all...
Am I dreaming? Please hear my condition.
My love for you is endless but with him it's different.
He fills my heart with passion.

Daddy please don't make me choose between the two.
Daddy he's no comparison to you.
Don't make me choose, don't make me choose.
It'll always be me & you.
But what I want most is a way to love you both.

It'll always be me & you.
