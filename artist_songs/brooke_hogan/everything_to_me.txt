[Verse 1]

You wanna go,
And as you open up the door,
You change your mind,
I'm not something to leave behind,
You'll never know,
All these things I feel inside,
I want to show, you,
There's nothing out there to find,

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh Baby I, wanna make you see,
there's nothing more to fear,
cause everythings right here,

[Chorus]
I'm everything you want,
I'm everything you need,
and every little part of you, is a part of me...
I'm everything you know,
I'm everywhere you go,
And I hope that you see,
That your everything to me,
Oh yeah,
Everything to me, Yeah,

[Verse 2]
Whisper to me, i hang on every word you say,
Don't tell me no,
As you turn and walk away,
Don't shut me out,
I'm much stronger
then you know,
But you're on your way, you'll be back with me someday,

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh Baby I, I'm gonna make you see,
There's nothing more to fear,
Cause everythings right here,

[Chorus]
I'm everything you want,
I'm everything you need,
and every little part of you, is a part of me...
I'm everything you know,
and I'm everywhere you go,
and I hope that you see,
that you're everything to me, Oh yeah

[Bridge]
I understand your confusion.
In denial, disillusioned.
But I won't wait to long.
And I might just move on.
I'm buried by your indecision.
Digging for the life I'm missing.
Just look inside and see I hope there's room for me.

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh baby I, I want to make you see,
There's nothing more to fear,
cause everythings right here.

[Chorus]
I'm everything you want,
I'm everything you need,
(Everything you need) and every little part of you,
Is a part of me,
I'm everything you know,
I'm everywhere you go, and I hope that you see,
(And I hope that you see) that your everything to me.
[Repeat]
