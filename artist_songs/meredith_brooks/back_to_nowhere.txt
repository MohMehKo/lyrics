If you could have told me
I wouldn't find my way back home
Never would have closed the door I
Never would have left the phone unplugged
All night
Waiting for the sunrise to take me out of here
Back to nowhere

Wish you could have told me
Who knows if I, could have heard
Love don't make the reasons why
Some people just don't find the words to convey
The truth
Of the passion that they're feeling
Why do I keep falling back?
Back to nowhere

Wishing you could hold me
Like you used to in the dark
Lay your body next to mine
But does it anywhere, does your star
Are you sure, you're fine
But in case it's me you're missing
You should know I'd gladly go
Back to somewhere
Back to anywhere
I go
With you
