Baby, what is wrong with you
Can't you see I want you around
And baby...
I'm not cryin'
I'm just dyin' for some touch

[Chorus:]
And if you don't give me your attention
I'll get attention from somebody else
I don't know what your intentions are
I have no patience to be put on the shelf

Mmm baby
You say you love me
Then you don't even know if I'm around
And baby
If you're not lying
Then keep trying or I'll be gone

[Chorus]

Baby, if you show me now
There may still be time
To change my heart
But baby
If you don't need me
You'll both leave me
When your cryin' starts

[Repeat chorus]
