I get him up for work
Early in the morning
While he's getting dressed
I get the coffee going
Another busy day
Always in a hurry
Not much time for us
But he don't ever worry

He's a company man
Company man
Company man
Company man

Deadlines to be met
Schedules he must follow
Conference is tonight
Can't wait until tomorrow
Need that new report
First thing in the morning
All work and no play
Makes him awful boring

[Chorus:]
He's a company man
Company man (He don't understand)
Company man
Company man

Money, money, money
All you're thinking of
Money, money, money
Well what about LOVE?

Company man...

I'm alone at home
He's off in the city
Need a little time
Wonder why he can't see
When I don't get love
I just start being angry
Working day and night
What's he tryin' to hand me?
Company man

[Repeat chorus]
