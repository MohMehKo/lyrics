I love the sound of summer disco in the air.
I throw my hands up like I just don't care.
It makes no difference where it's comin' from.
I'm on my way the party's just begun.

[Chorus]
Let me hear ya say I-I-I
no-no-no-no-no I'm not getting high.
I-I-I No matter what you do
I'm not getting high.

Sister freaky in a cloud of purple haze
She's groovin'; slowly through the Milky way.
The fish are jumpin' Everybody's free.
This kind of movie you will never ever see.

[Chorus]

Don't pass it my way.
I'm already high yea I'm fly.
What you say or do
Leave it up to you
This kind of something you will never see.
Baby if you want it come and get it
'Cause it's something that you can't deny.

[Chorus]
