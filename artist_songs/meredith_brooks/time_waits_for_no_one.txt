Days go by, nothing stays the same
As you and I move on, move on
Tonight is tomorrow's memory
Who knows where we both may be by dawn

Time goes on and on and on and [repeats]

Time waits for no one
Don't let it pass us by
Time waits for no one
It goes on and on

Touch me now, baby, keep my kiss
And show me that you're real
We just have this time together
Can't say whether we will ever be, you and me

Time goes on and on and on and [repeats]

Seize the moment, here between us
Only stars above can see us now
Time goes on and on and on and [repeats]
