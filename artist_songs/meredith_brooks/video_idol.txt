I hear a knock on my door
I hear the telephone ring
But I can't break away
I'm just ignoring all those things
My eyes are glued to my TV
You're up there making love to me

I fell in love with you
I'm watching your love scenes
I had to have you every night upon my TV screen
I rent your tape again and again
I never want this love to end

[Chorus:]
Video idol
Every night I escape with your video tape
You're my video idol
Everything will be right
When I watch you tonight
You're my video idol (video idol)
Now there's nobody else
I've got you to myself
You're my video idol
Whooooooooooooooooooooooo

My TV comes to life
When you come on the screen
I keep on watching though
I know I'm living in a dream
Tonight when all my work is through
I'll have my fantasy with you

[Repeat chorus]

Maybe someday I'm gonna meet you
And then our loving will be for real
But till then I'll have to pretend
About how good
How good it would feel (Hey!)

[Repeat chorus]
Video idol (Whoooooo)
