The trees are thin
And the sky is gray
I watch the rain fallin' on LA
Hey, I'm thinkin' of you
I don't know if I've lost or gained
But I know I'll never be the same
Hey, it's a little like
Yeah, just a little like

[Chorus:]
Thunder and lightning
Thunder and lightning
Striking my heart again
Thunder and lightning

Steamy midnights on the phone
You're telling me you're all alone
Then you say
"I'd like to see you"
I hear your voice and I'm hypnotized
I don't care if it's truth or lies
Hey, it's a little like
Yeah, just a little like

[Chorus]

Oh, is it pleasure or pain
Is the thunder just frightening
Is this the way love begins
When you're kissing me
It's like thunder and lightning

[Chorus]

Thunder and lightning
Striking my heart
Burning my soul
Thunder and lightning
