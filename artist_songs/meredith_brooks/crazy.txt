Jump in it's fine without a lifeboat 
I will give it another try
You say come back, don't go in too deep
But it's a rush to see me do it
Cause you don't dare
Even though there's nothing to it

[Chorus]
This town's always gonna think I'm a little crazy
Somebody's always gonna try to label me insane
Funny how I always seem to be the one who's crazy
I just wanna live, I don't wanna fit
If that makes me crazy, then I am

No way I feel like nothings goin' 
My way but my future's bright
Don't have a single dollar left
Got my keys inside my car
and the high way is opening wide
You ask me where, I can't tell you
But I'm putting town the pedal tonight

[Chorus]

You say don't change a single thing
But your list is longer than my day
I can't help wondering 
When all is said and all is done
Am I the crazy one?

I just want to live
I don't want to fit
I just want to try
I don't want to quit
If that makes me crazy, I am.

[Chorus]
