I search through my mind
And it's hard trying to find
Words that we haven't said
To tame the thoughts in your head
I can only promise you
That I will see this through

[Chorus]

You can count on me, you can cry with me
No one can divide me, you can depend on me
To see this through, I will cover you 
I won't lie to you, I will choose to 
Stand by you
I will stand by you
Stand by you
By you

When you're feeling weak and
You're close to defeat
You can look in my eyes
To find love, not my pride
You know that it's true
I'll be waiting here for you

[Chorus]

Fear can tear the road from underneath you
Nothing's worth my pride and nothing's worth the 
Feeling in my life without you

[Chorus]
