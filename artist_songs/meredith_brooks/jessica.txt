Jessica
Oh Jessica
Jessica
Oh Jessica

She walks in and the fighting begins
It's the way she is
Doesn't matter to her
If you value your heart
You'll stay away from Jessica
And the games that she plays
You're a fool
If you go with her tonight
She'll make everything seem so right

[Chorus:]
Jessica, she'll never be the one you waited for
She'll only tell you lies and lead you o-on
Oh Jessica
You've never met a girl like this before
You'll never find a place where you belong
Oh Jessica

Take it from me
A woman knows
What a woman can do
To a man's lonely heart
It's the start and the end
If you don't stay away from Jessica
And the games that she plays
You're a fool
If you go with her tonight
She'll make everything seem so right

[Repeat chorus...]
