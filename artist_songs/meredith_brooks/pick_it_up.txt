Baby don't hang around
You're making me sad
I guess
I needed more than you had
And I don't need to run around
To see who I am
I guess
I'll find somebody who can

[Chorus:]
Pick it up (Pick it up)
Take it for the distance (Pick it up)
Well you let me down
Pick it up (Pick it up)
Help me find the pieces
You threw around 

[repeat]

Baby you're a little old
For me anyway
I guess
You only wanted to play
And I'm not gonna wait around
'til you understand
I guess
I'll find somebody who can

[Repeat chorus...]

Oh Oh Why you gonna make me mad?
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Why you gonna make me sad?
Baby don't hang around
Can't you understand
I guess
I'm gonna find somebody who can

[Repeat chorus...]
