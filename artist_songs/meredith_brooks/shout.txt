It's 2:00 a.m. and the neighbors are jumpin'
Mr. Cray threatens to call the police
He jumps out of bed hits his head
Now you got something to really shout about
Everybody's got their eye on the T.V.
Did Bill and Monica do it the floor
The bombs go off and we're at war
Now we've got something to really get mad about

You got something to shout about baby
Yeah something to shout about
'Cause if you're gonna shout
Do it good and loud
Get something to shout about
Yeah yeah yeah shout it shout about 

The stewardess doesn't have vegetarian
There's no leg room, you've seen the movie twice
The plane goes down and smashes on the ground
Now you've got something to really freak you out

You got something to shout about baby
Yeah something to shout about
'Cause if you're gonna shout
Do it good and loud
Get something to shout about

So much wasted on unimportant things
Throw away the precious time
When there's so much that really needs changin'

You're driving home and the traffic isn't budging
Layin' on the horn adding to the mess
Then Y2K shuts down LA
Now you got something to really freak you out

You got something to shout about baby
Yeah something to shout about
'Cause if you're gonna shout
Do it good and loud
Shout it out

Get something to shout about baby

'Cause if you're gonna shout
Do it good and loud
Shout it out, shout about
