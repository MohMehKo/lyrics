Fill me up with a promise
Touch my eyes so I can see
The tears have dried the clouds have broken
Come to me
Fill my body with innocence
Come lay your head upon my pillow
Test my strength over and over
'Til I'm weak
Won't you make me weak

Hey now take me back to Eden
I'll fly when you call my name
Give me Heaven while I'm sleepin'
Back to Eden hey hey now now

I surrender tear my house down
Shame will lose its hold on me
A thousand nights I invite you
Crash through me

Hey now take me back to Eden
I'll fly when you call my name
Just like it was in the beginning
Back to Eden hey hey now now
hey hey now now
hey hey now now
hey hey now now
hey hey now now

I tremble when you pass through me
I burn like a rose on fire
This secret storm in me is humbled by your desire
I swallow your kisses deep
A million voices rise up
They cry they cry they cry out to me

Fill me up with a promise come to me
Won't you come to me

Hey now take me back to Eden
I'll fly when you call my name
Give me Heaven while I'm sleeping
Back to Eden hey hey now now
hey hey now now...
