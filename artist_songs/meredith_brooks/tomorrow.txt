This is no place for a lady
This city's never been too kind
Winter winds blow down the alley
The only home this woman found tonight
You can walk away, someone will find her
You can help her tomorrow

Tomorrow, there's a ray of hope inside
Someone will remember them tomorrow
Tomorrow, if we could see the other side
Keep your promise this time tomorrow

He lives alone in a small room
A powerful man before the fall
He was everything to you
Now you don't talk to him at all
Maybe some day you'll visit, talk about old times
You can call him tomorrow

Tomorrow , there's a ray of hope inside
Someone will remember them tomorrow
Tomorrow, if we could see the other side
Keep your promise this time tomorrow
Keep your promise this time tomorrow

Many tomorrows are gone now, here you sit alone tonight
Maybe you'll walk with someone who loves you
Don't wait until tomorrow

Tomorrow, there's a ray of hope inside
Someone will remember them tomorrow
Tomorrow, if we could see the other side
Keep your promise this time tomorrow
Keep your promise this time tomorrow
Keep your promise this time tomorrow
