We hit Starbucks, roll down the top
It's the last time Carrie and I will drive to the beach
'Cuz we think it's time to grow up
Well, I've never been good at that

I wanna live for today, I have such good intentions
And my dreams are no less than that of yesterday
Does anyone really know where we should go?

Meet me where we can dream, down by the river
Everybody's got a dream, down by the sea
Meet me where we can dream by the river
Who knows where it may lead, yeah?

The radio's blasting and we're singing
And I'm feeling unstoppable
When did I let life become so damn hard?

Well, I'm heading to what dreams are made of
I won't turn my back to the stars of yesterday
Does anyone really know where we should go?

Meet me where we can dream, down by the river
Everybody's got a dream, down by the sea
Meet me where we can dream by the river

Does anybody really know where we should go?
Meet me where we can dream, down by the river
Everybody's got a dream, down by the sea
Meet me where we can dream by the river
Who knows where we may be?

Meet me where we can dream, meet me
Meet me where we can dream, down by the river
Meet me where we can dream, yeah
Meet me where we can dream

Meet me where we can dream
Meet me where we can dream
Meet me where we can dream
Meet me where we can dream
