Holding us together
Then we're tearing us apart
It's tragic then it's beautiful
We shine and then it's dark
Feeling like a little kid
Because I can't let go

[Chorus]
Every time I think about
The things that I can't live without
Well I must love the pain
Misunderstood and complicated
Happiness is overrated
I must love the pain

Everytime you draw me in
I take a step away
Maybe I'm just restless
'Cause I want 
What I can't take

It's a shame that nothing else on earth
Can make me feel this way

[Chorus]

Feelin' like a little kid because I can't let go

[Chorus]

Well, I must love the pain
I do love the pain
