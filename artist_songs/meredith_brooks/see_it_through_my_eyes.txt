It's after midnight again
And we sleep in separate rooms
Wondering what went wrong
I know we tried to talk about
What it takes to talk things out
But we just go on and on

[Chorus:]
Baby, if you'd see it just once through my eyes
Maybe then we'd have a further chance to survive
Oh, baby if you'd see it just once through my eyes

I often think about the times
The world was yours and mine
All the things we should have done
And when I see it through your eyes
You know I start to cry
Please don't let me be the only one

[Chorus]

Oh, baby can't you see
I'm trying to give what you say to me
But you know
It's a two-way street

[Repeat chorus]
