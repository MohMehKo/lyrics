The world's asleep, don't despair
Got all I need, my love is strong and clear
Let's break away, you and I
Forget the future, leave the past behind
All it takes is just one little spark, feel it, from me
We'll make a chain of light in the dark, baby, let our hearts be free

We've got 50,000 candles burning, 50,000 candles burning
Let's do the dance of life
You know everywhere the world is turning
50,000 candles burning
It's my party, it's my party tonight

No time for tears, dry your eyes
The world could vanish in a flash of light
Oh, precious time just fades away
Let's celebrate the love we have today

All it takes is just one little spark, feel it, from me
We'll make a chain of light in the dark, baby, let our hearts be free

We've got 50,000 candles burning, 50,000 candles burning
Let's do the dance of life
You know everywhere the world is turning
50,000 candles burning
It's my party, it's my party tonight [repeat]

We've got 50,000 candles burning
