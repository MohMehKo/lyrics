I stayed up all night
Thinking about this life
I've been working so hard baby
now it's time to fly
and you're my pleasure baby

I hit the ground each day
no time to stop and stare
but when I see you all my
worries seem to disappear
I love the way you do it
you're my pleasure baby

[Chorus]
OO ya-ya
You're my pleasure baby
OO ya-ya
I love the way you do what you do
To make me feel so fine

I like it when we play
The pressure melts away
I have been with out relief for 110 days
Tomorrow's too late 
You're my pleasure baby

[Chorus]

Now this ain't livin' if it's just for the gettin'
It means nothin'
But nothin' is something if it's anything with you
And you're my pleasure baby

[Chorus]
