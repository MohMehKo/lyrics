He appears in a dream I can't forget
Though we never met, no we never met
I wake up with my eyes all soaking wet (crying)
'Cause we never met, no we never met

Over and over, night after night he's there
Under the covers, he answers my lover's prayer

In a dream I can't forget
Though we never met, no we never met
I am left with the lonely same regret
That we never met, no we never met

Come to me baby, out of the midnight skies
Wishing and hoping, he will materialize

I'm searching in my dreams, tearing at the seams
What's it take to make this dream come true

He appears in a dream I can't forget
Though we never met, no we never met
I wake up with my eyes all soaking wet (crying)
'Cause we never met, no we never met
