The list has been long full of complaints full of desires full of things
That keep me amused I don't even want
Some say I got lucky
She poured down on me
When I didn't have a place to sleep
But you said it was fine that way
All I need is this bed
And this guitar what more what more

I have everything I have everything
I have everything but you

I hang around the place you do laundry
And I don't even wash a thing
You say that it's cool we're such good friends
I already know plenty of those friends
But not the kind I want to kiss

I have everything I have everything
I have everything but you
I have everything

Maybe it's simple
But what else is there but love
You can have all the money in the world
But it doesn't matter if I climb another dome alone
I'd rather be back home
Thinking of things to do with you and me
Just me and you

I have everything I have everything
I have everything I have every little every little thing
I have everything but you
