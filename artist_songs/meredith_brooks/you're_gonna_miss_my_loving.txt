You told me what I wanted to hear
So I fell in love with you
I believed that you were sincere
Now you've got me where you wanted me
Soon I'm gonna make you see
You're gonna miss my loving when it's gone
You're gonna miss my loving when it's gone

Had to keep a distance apart
But you swept me off my feet
Now you think you've won my heart
So you're taking me for granted now
Soon I'll turn the tables around

[Chorus:]
You're gonna miss my loving when it's gone
(You'll come crying to me)
You're gonna miss my loving when it's gone

Now you may feel secure
And you're as you please
But soon you'll be begging on your knees

[Repeat chorus]
