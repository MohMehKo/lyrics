Should I let you in, into my house with its concrete walls
Should I let you in, into my room with its curtains drawn
I want to open up, and let you walk right through my door
Can you tell me, is it worth it, the risk any more
Should I let you in

[Chorus:]
Should I let you in, should I let you in, should I let you in

Should I let you in, into my far from perfect place
Should I let you see where I keep my secrets safe
I want to open up, but I've been hurt this way before
Can you tell me, is it worth the risk any more
Should I let you in

[Chorus]

Through my window, I see you now
You're looking in, I'm looking out
My heart will make up its mind somehow

Should I let you in, into my house
Should I let you in, inside these walls
Should I let you in, into my heart
Should I let you in, inside my world

[Chorus]
