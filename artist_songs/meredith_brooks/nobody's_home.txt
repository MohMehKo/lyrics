She can talk for hours
words don't cover the scars.
She thinks she's crazy,
but they've just pushed her too far.
She runs to the mirror
Only savior she's known
Another slap on her face
Cause nobody's home.

Mother's always working
Slinging beer on the side.
Her dad's watching TV
And he's still getting high.
She knows he'll be waiting
Tryinto get her alone.
She hangs out on the corner
Cause nobody's home.

All she ever wanted 
was a place on this earth
She shouts for a savior 
For anyone to hear her
All she ever needed 
Was hope in a world
In a world where she feels all alone
cause nobody's home

She cries for attention
Hanging on by a thread.
She can't stop the screaming
going on in her head.
Tears on the pillow
These are things she won't miss
Nothing to believe in
So it comes down to this.

Blood on the mirror,
Temptation is bliss.
Pills on the table,
She just couldn't resist.
Now nobody's home.

All she ever wanted 
was a place on this earth
She shouts for a savior 
For anyone to hear her
All she ever needed 
Was hope in a world
In a world where she feels all alone
cause nobody's home.
