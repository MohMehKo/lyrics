When the sun goes down, when the night star falls
I can see you come, I can hear you call

In every corner of the world, in every boy and every girl
There lives a hunger to be free
With every passion that I feel, and every secret I reveal
Oh let the night unchain my heart

Into the darkness now we go, every heart will find its soul [repeat]

When the sun goes down, when the night star falls
I can see you come, I can hear you call

Come meet me underneath the stars, and you can show me who you are
Shadows of love under the moon

Into the darkness now we go, every heart will find its soul [repeat]

When the sun goes down, when the city sleeps
We can be ourselves, in this land of dreams [repeat...]
When the sun goes down
