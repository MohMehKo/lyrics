Hold on now I'm slow to burn
I know you've been waiting your turn
I'm not giving in
It's just the time has come

You want it I said it You got it I meant it

I thought I had so much to lose
But I am no longer confused
You can't rush these things
And now I'm telling you

You want it I said it You got it I meant it

Love will tell the truth
Lovers can turn it to lies
I'd rather protect these lips
Then say another goodbye

I don't want regret from the past
To keep me from something that could last
You're the only one
Who solved the mystery

You want it I said it You got it I meant it

Hold on now I'm slow to burn
You're the only one
Who saw the mystery

You want it I said it You got it I meant it
You heard me I said it

Believe it
Now get it
You want it I meant it
I love you
