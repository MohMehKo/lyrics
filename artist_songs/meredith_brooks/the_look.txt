East Side Johnny
Are you slummin' around
You're looking for some action
On the west side of town
Your Nassau tan and your skintight pants
Come on Johnny, do you wanna dance?

[Chorus:]
He, he's got the look
He's got the look
Me, by hook or crook
I'll get that boy tonight
He, he's got the look
He's got the look
Me, he's got me shook
I'll get that boy tonight

Every girl around
Has got her eyes on you
Watchin' every breath you take
Every move you do
With your sun-streaked hair
And your Hollywood face
Come on Johnny
Let's get out of this place

[Chorus]

Well, don't mind courage
Gonna' take my chance
Hello Johnny!
Wanna new romance?

[Repeat chorus]
