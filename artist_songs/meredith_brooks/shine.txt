Lucky that you found me
You gotta hang around me some more
Cause I'll remind you
I'll be around
While you're waging your war
With yourself
And I
See it clearer than you see it
You gotta get out of your head to believe it
Oh I know something about you
You don't know I know

[Chorus]
That's where you shine
When you're sinking you swim
When you see your way out instead of in
That's where you shine
Like a diamond in the rough
You're always so resilient
That's where you shine
When you're walking the edge
No one's ever gonna catch you stumbling 
That's where you shine

Remember when you told me
To get up and dust yourself off
It wasn't easy
Everything can change
And it usually does
It does
You said
Shake it off like it ain't no big thing
Won't be the last time we're sinking
Oh, I know some things about you
You don't know 

[Chorus]
That's where you shine
When you think you've had enough
Just a matter of time before you fade
That's where you shine
Like a clear in the brush
Like a headlight breaking through the haze
That's where you shine
When there's nothing but no
And there's nowhere to go
You find a way
That's where you shine

Sometimes you need someone to see yourself clearer
There's no reflection when it's you inside the mirror
I know something about you don't know

[Chorus]
