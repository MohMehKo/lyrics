I'm gonna spin some lies of my own
'cause your truth has got me reelin'
You always think of things that go wrong
But it's only faith you're stealin
I tried to slip out the back
But you showed up to give me one more chance

[Chorus]
You're the star of your show
And all you touch turns to gold
I hear you say
It's my lucky day
No one's taking your place
You tell me right to my face
Yeah you say
It's my lucky day 

I want to waste some time on my own 
'cause I feel I'm suffocating
I'm getting lost on 2nd and Vine
Yea I feel I've finally made it
I hear the screaming on the street
And you got everyone listening

[Chorus]

Sometimes you just got to let luck run out 
And live with out the plan
We all know the world is gonna win in the end

[Chorus]
