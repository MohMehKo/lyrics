Sitting in your car, it's the edge of the night
You turn to me baby, and I say that it's alright
You stare at the moon, then the music starts
The radio plays a song, for broken hearts
Your eyes turn a deep shade of blue
You can try but you can't hide the truth
I'm on the outside looking right into you
It's a perfect view, and they say...

[Chorus:]
Na Na Na Na Na Na
Standing next to you
Na Na Na Na Na Na
It's a perfect view
Na Na Na Na Na Na
Looking straight through you
Na Na Na Na Na Na
It's a perfect view

I want to walk away, but I just can't go
'Cause I've got this fear, can't let it show
I'm a man alone don't get too near
Are those the words you mean for me to hear?
Who you are, it's something I cannot change
I realize that we both are the same
I'm on the outside looking right into you
It's a perfect view, and they say...

[Chorus]

Sitting in your car, it's the edge of the night
You turn to me baby, and I say it's all right
Just for tonight, can't we pretend
And make a world where nothing has to end, and they say...

[Chorus]
