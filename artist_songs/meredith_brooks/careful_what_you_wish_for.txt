Snap your fingers and they'll come
Running to you awesome one
Getting lonely out in space
It's not such a special place
On the outside looking in
At the bag girl you've been

Isn't this what you always wanted?
Isn't this how you saw the view?
Careful what you wish for
It just might come true
Might come true

You say catch me when I'll spin
As if we been through thick and thin
I don't think that you can stop
You still want what you ain't got
Such a stupid superstar
Yeah you are

Isn't this what you always wanted?
Isn't this how you saw the view?
Careful what you wish for
It just might come true
Might come true
Isn't this what you always pictured?
Isn't this what you plan to do?
Careful what you wish for
It just might come true

Tryin' to find the meaning of life
In a deeper shade of red on your lips
Tryin' to find the way to be loved
Without ever givin' a shit

But enjoy yeah while you can
After all the jagged ends
You come round again and again and again

Isn't this what you always wanted?
Isn't this how you saw the view?
Careful what you wish for
It just might come true
Might come true
Isn't this what you always pictured?
Isn't this what you plan to do?
Careful what you wish for
It just might come true
Might come true

Isn't this what you always wanted?
