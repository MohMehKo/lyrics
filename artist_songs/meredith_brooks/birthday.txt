When's your birthday
What's your middle name
Who's your hero
What's your favorite flavor ice cream
Can you tell me, tell me this
Are you Aries
Are you on the cusp of Cancer
Gonna get to know you better
What? No, it's not a quiz
You can trust me
Now we'll dig a little deeper
Let's trade numbers
Let's trade beepers
So I can find you any place
Hey why you lookin' at your watch
We haven't had dessert
It's early, just 8:30
Only our first date

I wanna know, do you love me yet
Do you feel the same, am I your everything
I wanna know, isn't true love great
Come on tell me, when's your birthday

Where you goin'?
Why you leavin'?
After all we've been through
Can't you think of me?
I'll think of you
Don't throw it all away

I'll quit my job, I'll have your children
You'll work hard, I'll spend your millions
Hey, no pressure, you've got time
Just don't make me wait

I wanna know, do you believe in fate
When you movin' in, be my everything
I wanna know we are for always
Come on tell me
When's your birthday
When's your birthday

And this isn't just an oxytocin high
I never felt this way about any other guy before
I ain't gettin' any younger
I ain't foolin' any more

I wanna know, do you love me yet
Wanna wear your ring, be your everything
I wanna know, isn't true love great
Come on tell me, come on tell me

I wanna know, do you believe in fate
Do you feel the same, be my everything
I wanna know, isn't true love great
Come on tell me, when's your birthday
