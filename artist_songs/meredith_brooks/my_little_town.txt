We lock the doors at night, all the sirens scream
I don't drive my car, insurance is too high
I live here in the city, my hometown's far away
I work out with concrete, I don't drive my car
The stars come out at night, you see them on the strip
Everybody arms themselves, there's no other place like this
I'll never leave the small town girl behind
The place where I come from is with me all the time

[Chorus:]
Oh, you can walk the streets
When the sun goes down in my little town
You don't need defenses
When the sun goes down in my little town

Back home on the street, after ten at night
Mrs. Avery walks her dog, checks to see what's going on
She doesn't lock the door, she lives here in good health
You don't hear the horn when Mrs. Avery walks her dog

All I ever wanted was a view of city lights
Break away from here, leave behind the quiet nights
Spend half your life, trying to make a change
Spend the other half trying to get back again

[Chorus]

Look down the road, look up the highway
Look past the fences, look at the faces
What do you have on the other side

[Chorus]
