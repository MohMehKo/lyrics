I'm just a little defensive
But I'll be o.k. tomorrow
This happens once in awhile
'Till I'm back on my feet
Once I get out of bed
I'll come to my senses
Feed my head
A double shot of caffeine
A pair of shades can change it all
Maybe Superman will jump the wall
Whatever it takes to get on with the world

'Cuz I'm bored with myself
So very bored with myself
More and more everyday
And I wonder if Marilyn ever felt this way

We're moving so fast
Why do I feel so empty
There's clothes in my closet
But nothing to wear
It's a mysterious thing
The more that I acquired
The less hungry I am but not more satisfied
There's India where I can chant
Therapy to rave and rant
Whatever it takes to distract me from being so

Bored with myself
So scary bored with myself
More and more everyday
And I wonder if Jacqueline ever felt this way

I'm a little uninspired
It happens to the best of us
I know I shouldn't take it hard
But I'm so afraid this time I'll never change
Won't shake it off I'll just go insane

More and more everyday
And I wonder if Loretta Lynn ever felt this way

I'm so bored with myself
So very bored with myself
So bored with myself
