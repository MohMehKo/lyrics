Some days goes your way
You're on a roll you can't explain
And then it all goes down the drain
Your cat's hit by a car
The ATM eats your card
You're wondering what changed from yesterday
Save me from, from going mental
Save me from just spinning out

Some days are better than lovers
Some days you just can't figure out
Some days you can't explain

My best friend and me one night
Were drinkin' at Pete's on Crescent Height
Just like that we end up in a fight
Like a yo-yo up and down
You're headin' north, you end up south

Save me from, from going mental
Save me from just spinning out

Some days are better than lovers
Some days you just can't figure out
Some days are better than others
You can't explain some days away
Someday

Save me from, from going mental
Save me from spinning out

Some days are better
Some days are never
Some days, whatever

Some days are better than lovers
Some days you just can't figure out
Some days are better than others
Some days you just can't get out
Someday...
