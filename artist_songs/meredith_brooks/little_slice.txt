In the decline of the civilization
I live in Hollywood
In this situation I'm in
Sometimes I wanna run away

I'm living on caffine
Stressing information
I turn to people who sing
For some inspiration
As the pressures mount each day

So my gay friend Larry
Took me off to Maui
Walk in the sunshine
Have a little chill-time
Silver rains came pouring down

Sitting at the ocean
See that it is tough
No matter what you have
It never seems enough
To let fate replace the doubt

[Chorus:]
We' all want
A little slice of heaven
To find our place in the sun
And I' want
A little slice of heaven
To find my place in the sun

Last May I decided
I wanna have a baby
Running against the clock
And a man, he says 'maybe?
As the window starts to close

A house in the country
A little piece of myself
Money in the bank
And a chance to take time
To breathe, just breathe slow

[Chorus]

Thought I met a broken man
When he said
I had it all, I lost it all!
But I wouldn't ever change a single thing
Cuz now I know how to go on ?
And on and on!?

Of my list of things
That change everyday
One thing's for sure
I'm safe to say
