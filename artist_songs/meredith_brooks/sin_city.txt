In this town of pain
You could be the lucky one
Fate turns on a dime
The only thing that will change
Are the lights when they get brighter
They replace the sun

Out the door, you get burned
And there is no way back in
You've got nothing
Snake eyes, the house always wins

[Chorus:]
A drowning man does not die silently
You can feel the final warning
And the black money follows
Through the veins of the shallow
Change the name to protect the guilty
You'll never leave Sin City
Where you are king

In this room of shame
You could sink this town
And breathe another day
The mirror faces you
You cannot look away
Blood is on your hand
The streets will be the same
Under your feet like quicksand
Touch the face where a kiss of hope can last

[Chorus]
Ooohhh where you are king ooohhh

A drowning man does not die silently
You can feel the final warning
And the black money follows
Through the veins of the shallow
Change the name to protect the guilty
You'll never leave Sin City

Just one kiss from the shadow
Will be the touch of an angel
Just one kiss is all that you need
If you never leave Sin City
You never leave Sin City
You never leave Sin City
Where you are king

Just one kiss ohhhh-oh-oh-oh
Where you are king [repeat]
