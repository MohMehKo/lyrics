Living a lifetime without love, I swear that it's a sin
I could turn away from you, but something pulls me in
Should I let you get too close, so I have nowhere to go
Can't turn back, I don't want to turn back

[Chorus:]
Fear no love, I fear no heart
Take my hand, you can take my kiss
Right from the start
You give me strength
To open up

Baby, when it comes to you, I fear no love
I have always known the words
To keep this moment underneath the stars with you
The past just burns away

If I let myself go free, will you be there next to me
Don't turn back, I don't want to turn back

[Chorus]
Can't turn back, I don't want to turn back [repeat]

[Chorus]
