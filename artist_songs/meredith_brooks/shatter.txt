Prick of a pin, no blood on me
I've been tested, total wasted, in too deep
To the zone, I retreat
What doesn't kill ya makes you strong eventually
Blade to my skin, blurring the edge
Seven doves are waiting for me up ahead
I just breathe in, I just breathe out
I've taken every hairpin curve by now
I may crack but I'll never shatter
I may crack but it doesn't matter
I may crack but I'll never shatter
I may crack

Promised the world, dropped in a pool
Was it fun, did you enjoy acting so cool
Well, here's the thing, still have my head
I stumble hard but I'm not sleepin' in your bed
Saved by the sun, no shame on me
We come out screaming it's the only time we're free
I just breathe out, I just breathe in
I ride the wave until I come again

I may crack but I'll never shatter
I may crack but it doesn't matter
I may crack but I'll never shatter
I may crack but I'll never shatter
Cuz I still have a secret
In the dark I keep it close
I still have a secret no one knows

I may crack but I'll never shatter
Tested, wasted, over and over
I may crack but it doesn't matter
In the darkness I am the shatter
Shake down, twisted and tied
It's amusing that I'm doing fine
I just breathe in, I just breathe out
I may crack, but I'll never shatter
Cuz I still have a secret
In the dark I keep it close
I still have a secret no one knows

I may crack but I'll never shatter
I may crack
