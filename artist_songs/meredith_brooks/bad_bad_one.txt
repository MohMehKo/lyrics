I wouldn't blame you if you 
threw away the key
I can't expect you to keep the 
door unlocked for me
I'm happy that you waited 
'cause I know it's complicated 
keeping up with me

Oh no-it's almost that time again
For me to go round and round 
in my head today
I get so bored when I stay
Oh it could have been a good thing

[Chorus]
I-I'm the bad bad one
I know how hard you try for me
But I'm immature I run away for fun
I guess I'm not ready for a good love
and I'I'm the bad bad one
I'm the bad bad one

I wouldn't blame you if you tried to hang me
I keep you running around the same old tree
I wouldn't be the same if I didn't get away
with acting out for free oh no
you seem to like it better when I'm mean

and here comes the fight again
about our cloudy fate
well it looks like rain
I know it should have been a good thing

[Chorus]

I know you could be the one
I I could let you give me good love

[Chorus]

I'm just not read-
I'm just not ready for a good love
