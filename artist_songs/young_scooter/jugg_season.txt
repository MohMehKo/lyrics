[Chorus:]
I change a lot of streets, 'cause I got season
Keep it low key, you've got that cocaine in.
You street niggas snitching out for no reason,
All year round I call it jugg season.
I blend in good with the rich and famous,
But I will never change the game and I don't claim it.
You gotta change groups like you change clothes,
They take 'em in illuminati, know I can't go.

[Verse 1:]
I don't even think before I make a move,
And I never leave the house without the tool
In the streets, nigga, you can win or lose,
I got bricks, I got bills, but I don't fuck with you.
Word on the street, a lot of niggas talking,
I'm a work that jugg ass, I'm a keep on balling.
My trap phone, I got all the label calling,
Jugg on the other line want a Miami dolphin.
Put the label on hoe, now money talking,
I talk big money 'cause I'm about status,
Street first, rap second, that's just how I call it,
And you know I drink that lane like an alcoholic.

[Chorus:]
I change a lot of streets, 'cause I got season
Keep it low key, you've got that cocaine in.
You street niggas snitching out for no reason,
All year round I call it jugg season.
I blend in good with the rich and famous,
But I will never change the game and I don't claim it.
You gotta change groups like you change clothes,
They take 'em in illuminati, know I can't go.

[Verse 2:]
Them niggas are sneaky, but we're still in,
Them niggas are greesy, but we're still working.
I grind every day like on steer hurting,
I'm in the booth recording a song while my nigga serving.
I took a couple niggas out, feel it was all worth,
Know I can go like the key on tec, nigga feel it.
Pour some purple in my cup, I call it purple rain,
I gotta watch out for these bitches trying to fuck for fame.
I'm trying to find different words for different days,
Nigga take fully loaded from a car that changed.
You really think I talk to the devil for the fame?
I'm bringing money up in there for everything I claim.

[Chorus:]
I change a lot of streets, 'cause I got season
Keep it low key, you've got that cocaine in.
You street niggas snitching out for no reason,
All year round I call it jugg season.
I blend in good with the rich and famous,
But I will never change the game and I don't claim it.
You gotta change groups like you change clothes,
They take 'em in illuminati, know I can't go.
