Free bricks, free bricks
Serve you with one eye open – Slick Rick
Free bricks, free bricks
Young Scooter Gucci Mane talking real' slick

[Verse 1:]
On everything the streets will never be the same
Petty niggas snitching just for pocket change
I rearrange the game and build my own lane
I'm all about the money motherfuck the fame
I came up with a hustle, made myself a star
I was 20 years old with three foreign cars
Light house, 20 000 work for real diamonds
Wasn't in the rap game, in the streets grindin'
Scooter took over and they don't like that
You think I should you tell the folks the day I sold you that
But I ain't sold you none nigga, I drilled you out of set
From San Diego to Atlanta I got flying pass

Free bricks, free bricks
Serve you with one eye open – Slick Rick
Free bricks, free bricks
Young Scooter Gucci Mane talking real' slick

[Verse 2:]
RIP to my old whips, all my cars got pink shit
No shoppin' that sacks filled 'cause she eat a dick like real too
Takin' hoes on field trips, do you know I pay lil' get
All my hoes Sicilian, driving seat the million
I got money, I sold diamonds
I miss learning, ain't shit funny
Take youngins with 10 talents and niggas can't take shit from them
Cutthroat on this on it, try me – you get punished
Kick door, your bitch mad but you get cut and I get gutta
Back down from no one, got one and I got one
Take one to know one get shot down for my shotgun
Amigos we trick those, kilos we miss those
Robin Hood, on the 6th, I got Free Bricks for my clique fool

[Hook: x2]
Free bricks, free bricks
Serve you with one eye open – Slick Rick
Free bricks, free bricks
