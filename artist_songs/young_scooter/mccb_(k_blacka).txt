I seen OGs on the corner making hella sales
No matter what's the weather or the cars, they on the paper trail
Had bad bitches flexin', ridin' in they coupes
And to get that, I knew just what a nigga had to do
I had to get money, cars, clothes, and bitches
I had to get money, cars, clothes, and bitches
I had to get money, cars, clothes, and bitches
I had to get money, cars, clothes, and bitches

I was just a little nigga walkin' 'round the E, I seen a lot of action
Took a trip to the scene and see the OGs trapping
Fifteen fees passed, spend ten, you get three back
I saw a rock on the stove, made the dope jump, rabbit
Then bag it, left and came back at it
Say K Blacka, you want this money, you can't be slacking
You see this shit I do in front of you, you know I stack it
I started thinking in my head about saran wrapping
He said you can be rich soon if you don't be no fool
But still I took my chances trapping the green in school
I asked my OG do you do any clubbing?
He said that club gon' be there nigga, I'm tryna get this money

I seen OGs on the corner making hella sales
No matter what's the weather or the cars, they on the paper trail
Had bad bitches flexin', ridin' in they coupes
And to get that, I knew just what a nigga had to do
I had to get money, cars, clothes, and bitches
I had to get money, cars, clothes, and bitches
I had to get money, cars, clothes, and bitches
I had to get money, cars, clothes, and bitches

I'm all grown now
Do what I want now
Trap on that same corner
Trap out that same house
Where they be racks out
And push packs out
Got me in love with money
All a nigga want is money
He pull up to a yard, nobody don't stay in
He open the door, I swear that bitch look like a bakery
He said it's blow and you can make what you want today
Don't let 'em lie to you, money change every day
It do, this bitch just told me she don't suck dick
Threw money on the bed and force that ho to try to swallow it
You said I'm going to strip club and throw bands on the bitch
You better go straight to the plug and throw bands on the brick

I seen OGs on the corner making hella sales
No matter what's the weather or the cars, they on the paper trail
Had bad bitches flexin', ridin' in they coupes
And to get that, I knew just what a nigga had to do
I had to get money, cars, clothes, and bitches
I had to get money, cars, clothes, and bitches
I had to get money, cars, clothes, and bitches
I had to get money, cars, clothes, and bitches
