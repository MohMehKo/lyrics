[Hook:]
G4 we ride G5
Fuck with Young Scooter errybody gon' die
G4 we ride G5
Fuck with Young Scooter errybody gon' die
I push a show on ya you get shot up
Everything I'm droppin' dope boy product
G4 I'd rather fly G5
Fuck with Young Scooter errybody gon' die

[Verse 1:]
I keep it so real they tryna find a flaw
Bitch shout out to my jeweler he made that water cross
Plus when It ices my tounge out nigga I
Money stove cars and clothes that's what we about
Black Amigo gang deep like Wu Tang
We zone 6 niggas free Poo tang
Scooter Teflon just like 2 guns
I'm in my own lane I already won
Takin' boss man steps I got authentic soles
Face platinum in the streets far pass gold
In New York I'm counting bucks up with my nigga Slow
Jugged a hunnid bricks in a hour it's time to make some more

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
If it's a gold on you then that gold on it
25 thousand I put a show on ya
I'm just tryna get these millions why you hating on me
Thought you was a real nigga what you on homie
Young Scooter is a nigga you don't fuck with
I let the rustling cow boys come shoot up shit
How street these niggas go shoot at the President
I get sick without it money that is my medicine
Millions off rap thank God that's my blessin' then
I'm jugging for the future just so they can live
I make and spend a million a month that's just how I live

[Hook]
