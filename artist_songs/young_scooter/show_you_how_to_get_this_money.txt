Money, that's all nigga talk about
And I'm a keep talking money till I pass out
Make it hard for you rapper put myself out
Young scooter, don't I love that street life
Atlanta, Georgia, Kirkwood where you find I
A somewhere in the loaf nigga downtown
See I was born in Carolina as a young guy
And then I move to the 8 and got my face right
Post up, on sip [?] aspen, hungry for the money
Couldn't let it walk past me
Life story, of a boy who had is son broke
Be [?] daddy supply the whole city
I'm on the wait, bout that money I'm impatient
Hunned dollar bills I'm talking no more small faces
Street smart shawty jigging with the open cases
Keep it low key, a lot of niggas can't take it
Bout my niggas I kill a nigga
By me them niggas come and get you
Bout my plug my brother take you out
Signed myself a deal, yeah I came myself out

Mama had to work, I did it myself
I did it for the streets and them niggas over there
Scooter getting money, real trapper of the year

All them niggas local, I'm a road runner nigga
Used to walk and get it, now it's trap the trailers with me
Swerve through your hood and throw a [?] out the window.
