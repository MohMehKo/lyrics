The money got me gik, the money got me gik
The money got me gik, the money got me gik
I'm giked up, off the money
I'm giked up, off the money
I'm giked up, for the money
I'm giked up, for the money
The money got me gik, the money got me gik
The money got me gik, the money got me gik
I'm flexing with the cash, I'm running through the gwap
Black amigo gang, only swagging to the top

Money got me giking, yeah I go that boy scooter
Spending more than 50, that's the only way I'm moving
Road runner scooter, on the sprint, way cruising
Can't stop countin money, the only thing I'm doing
My life feel like a bindess, you know I just keep it going
Energizer racks, I be in the hood rolling
Ballin with no deal, 10 stacks for a performance
I ain't gotta do a show, all I see is cake
The other rappers lying, you know all they do is fake
Erase your whole face, I ain't even gotta pay
My whole life free, the streets that's the way
2pac judge bought the hood a better days

[Hook:]
The money got me gik, the money got me gik
The money got me gik, the money got me gik
I'm giked up, off the money
I'm giked up, off the money
I'm giked up, for the money
I'm giked up, for the money
The money got me gik, the money got me gik
The money got me gik, the money got me gik
I'm flexing with the cash, I'm running through the gwap
Black amigo gang, only swagging to the top

God damn I'm swagging to the top without a gwap
Yes sir, the vvs one in my watch
Yeah the low numbers make you move of your block
Real street nigga, black amigo boy hot

God damn I'm 22, with 7 for the cause
Jiggle through the city man we 7 for them broads
Each one worth a hunned, they go whole 4 off
Do for 25, down by 700 loaf
Long way money hunned thous around my arm
Giking off the bands, every mond I buy a
I got too much money man I can't go wrong

[Hook:]
The money got me gik, the money got me gik
The money got me gik, the money got me gik
I'm giked up, off the money
