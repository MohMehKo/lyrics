[Chorus:]
I get 'em everyone, spring, summer, fall,
I can make them bail, do a summer soul,
Throw 'em in the air, watch the money fall,
I can make the bricks to a summer sun.
I'm on a juggathon, I'm on a juggathon,
I'm balling with the bricks, I'm on a juggathon.
I'm on a juggathon, I'm on a juggathon,
Two hundred bails on my wrist, I'm on a juggathon.

[Verse 1:]
In pressure making jewels, shooting basketball,
Throw them bails in the air, free bails fall.
I'm standing in the booth, just like Lapron Jane.
I got 45 thousand in my gym shorts.
I got flying past my houses like an airport,
Every other bad freak won't you shout with me?
That's how I like the streets, I got the recipe.
My partner Big J on the juggathon,
Just made it to me, go money marathon,
Juicy say he got a jugg, he gotta take 'em all.
You know I'm rapping pretty, then I'm dicing more,
The messing on the city, everybody goes

[Chorus:]
I get 'em everyone, spring, summer, fall,
I can make them bail, do a summer soul,
Throw 'em in the air, watch the money fall,
I can make the bricks to a summer sun.
I'm on a juggathon, I'm on a juggathon,
I'm balling with the bricks, I'm on a juggathon.
I'm on a juggathon, I'm on a juggathon,
Two hundred bails on my wrist, I'm on a juggathon.

[Verse 2:]
Jugg, jugg, jugg, I'm on a juggathon
Count, count, count, I'm a money counter,
Welcome my jewel, house brick is in the corner,
I get money large amounts in bags, I don't need to count them.
I indicate I'm on a jugg, I'm a stone mountain,
Young Scooter, diamonds clear and a water fountain.
I get price of the year, nigga, on the street,
Anything I do I'm a jugg the streets.
My daughter gotta eat, I gotta feed her
Jugg, jugg, jugg, money all I see.
Everyday present for the jugg play
Every day for me is jugg day.
