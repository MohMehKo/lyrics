[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Got 200K in my ear lobe, don't push it in my pill flow
The young hoe, ten years older, drop it dead like a bulldozer
Got my older hoe, she's a real soldier
Pulled er over in Minnesota
Ten thousand dollars in a new Corolla
And I let her go and she still going!
Blowing up so she real pull
Slow motion, I still touch it
Rich glowin, no discoing but I'm kickin shit like I'm feel goin
If you didn't notice, I'm good too
I start commotion, don't need promotion
Got one way more money than the average person
Feel a bad bitch, but I choose a person!
Brand new Bentley, I'm a close the curtain
Pack came in, so I'm back don't worry
Feel it to his girl he a lying dude
But you aks one me and we can start to flirt
So he getting money, but he miss some payments
Pat to the bases up in the basement
Got a trap house with a weed house adjacent
Pull it so hard I had to call the station.

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Faces, faces
I've seen so many places!
Pocket full of dead white guys displayin they faces
Faces, faces,
I love that white old racists
Don't wanna see no new faces
Roll bands on all my faces!
Faces, faces
I've been so many places!
I met so many women trying to scheme on all them faces
Faces, faces
Pretty faces I love the paces
Bad bitch I pay they pesos, getting face on the daily basis
Faces, faces,
These niggas scared to face me
You know you pussy face it, mask on my face like Jason
Faces, faces,
I drop her out, two faces
Them feds, they keep on chasing, fuck around I'm a show you my face and
Faces, faces

[Verse 2: Young Scooter]
I caught a case and had to turn my face
They was on my trail, but I got away!
Faces equal paper, faces buy you cases
Favor for a favor, faces equal blesses
Faces equal flexing, faces stop the stressing
I say fuck the feds and free Jerry Chester
He gave me a blessing, a lot of niggas telling (salute!)
He just make the call, and I relate the message
Nigga I want it all, I'm talking faces
In every state I ball, in different places! (let's go!)
Don't you piss me off, you'll be faceless
With my back against the wall, I still made it
Let's go!
