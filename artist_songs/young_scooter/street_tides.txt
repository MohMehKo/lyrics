[Pre-Hook:]
I just roll the whole thing
With the cap I bought 2 diamond chains
Shake the pop, that's how I do my thing
Gotta hustle in the dirty game

[Hook:]
I got street ties, I got street ties
I got street ties, I got street ties
I got street ties, I got street ties
I got street ties, I got street ties

[Verse 1:]
Homie's got them whole things
I can shoot that Nina rocks from long range
Girl you want this dick, you getting that whole thing
She feel her whole squad, we ran a soul train... soul train
Bitch I'm YG, 400
My bitch get no hunneds
Got bad bitches, they all fuckin

Got big Glocks, you know all runnin
Nigga pop and we're all duckin
Like that lil nigga duck
West side, nigga we fuck
Bitches seein our chest, I don't talk if she don't fuck
I know niggas with them chickens but they chickens don't cluck
Uh! Money on my mind and my girlfriend trippin
I'm a ratchet like when that pussy wet then I'm swimming
Get that money

[Pre-Hook:]
I just roll the whole thing
With the cap I bought 2 diamond chains

Gotta hustle in the dirty game

[Verse 2:]
Black Migo gang, we got street ties
I got cheap prices, I live 9 lives
Always shootin dices, spend 100 thousand
Always going broke, shit feel like you drowning
That's that street shit, call it street ties
I'm talkin dry whip, standard steel pipe
I got em real diamonds, you know I got guap
With all these floor numbers I come and flex yo block
Cause I got street ties, I got street money
I'm a street nigga, lookin they outrun em
Everywhere I go I got tax on me
Even at the show you could buy a pack from me

[Pre-Hook:]
I just roll the whole thing
With the cap I bought 2 diamond chains
Shake the pop, that's how I do my thing
Gotta hustle in the dirty game

[Hook:]
I got street ties, I got street ties
I got street ties, I got street ties
I got street ties, I got street ties
I got street ties, I got street ties
