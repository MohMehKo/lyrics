[Hook:]
Faster
He did 5, he got 10 more to go
He wish the years can go faster
I'm moving blow, I'm knee deep in the snow,
You need to load that truck faster, go
I'm too impatient tryin to roll it up quick,
But my bitch can roll faster,
It's all good you wind me your old school
But my news can go faster.

[Verse 1:]
I'm in my class reunion and I'm pass the car
I'm the richest niggas here but I didn't pass the bar
I got a white so bright it make the crowd applaud,
Make account so stupid I got thank you Lord,
I got a bitch so bad marry me and divorce
She a top notch shit just can't afford
I'm having so much jewelry at the Vive Awards
And I'm booked up from Friday to Friday bruh
Upper echelon nigga, top society boy
That Ferrari got your girlfriend round beside your boy
Remember when I first started they be notched boy
And a nigga lost his license because he trashed a boy

[Hook:]
Faster
He did 5, he got 10 more to go
He wish the years can go faster

You need to load that truck faster, go
I'm too impatient tryin to roll it up quick,
But my bitch can roll faster,
It's all good you wind me your old school
But my news can go faster.

[Verse 2:]
I get guwap, you better aks these niggas
I don't wanna be friends, I wanna whack these niggas
I ain't tryna be cool, I'm tryna tax these niggas
I wish I was the fall off so I could jack these niggas
I might just pull man knowing just slap that nigga
I run the track then push packs, ain't one of these rap ass niggas
I made 150 thousand playing blackjack nigga
I brought the trap back nigga, Louie backpack nigga
I got that fire-red interior, the gut soo woo

[Verse 3:]
I got niggas doing life you like they moving backwards
Just thinking what I'm facing make me rapping faster
I still finessing rub and I'm on CD,
A million dollar nigga, I'm still in the street
A free band boss yeah I call shots,
I bought a red rari cooked it out the pot,
Gucci that my nigga we got street time,
Everywhere you see me, you see plugs around,
I get my money fast but I spend it faster,
Never seen it drive, got birds in the addict
I spend a mill a week, I got a lot of habits
You say your plug take a week, I get em to you faster.

[Hook:]
