[Chorus:]
Is nothing important than money
Them Franklin, them hundreds, them hundreds
Is nothing important than money
So we hustling and hustling and hustling.
Is nothing important than money
Them Franklin, them hundreds, them hundreds
Is nothing important than money
So we hustling and hustling and hustling.

[Verse 1:]
It's nothing more important than a dollar bill
Dirty money up in cocaine deals
I speak Japanese to you if I know who you is
I'm all about the money, fuck how you feel.
That marley got me thinking everybody's stitch
I'm used to standing still, pirates on the week
Any language spoke, nigga, I can speak it
You don't know your plug line as they don't try to cheat
So when I take a loss I don't think about it
I'll take your ass over and I won't think about it
Wake up in the morning wrap the bitch in loving
Me is over the birds of a feather.

[Chorus:]
Is nothing important than money
Them Franklin, them hundreds, them hundreds
Is nothing important than money
So we hustling and hustling and hustling.
Is nothing important than money
Them Franklin, them hundreds, them hundreds
Is nothing important than money
So we hustling and hustling and hustling.

[Verse 2:]
Ain't nothing important than money
I can stack it and feel them the hundreds
For everything gotta take a stand
Cause I remember I ain't had a shit
Step on the floor and I ain't had no clothes
Recycle that, take my bro to work
He was a thirty eight, I was a thirty four
I tear them bitches up and I swear that is dope
But now I'm getting money, can't tell me shit
I'm all way paper chasing, trying to make a flip
And I only do gas, I don't do bricks
And I'm a cash out, you can't front me shit.

[Chorus:]
Is nothing important than money
Them Franklin, them hundreds, them hundreds
Is nothing important than money
So we hustling and hustling and hustling.
Is nothing important than money
Them Franklin, them hundreds, them hundreds
Is nothing important than money
So we hustling and hustling and hustling.

[Verse 3:]
Ain't nothing more important than money
Way before these nigga stand, I want money, get it
Hundred thousand dollar profit on my own
Up here in the streets money been grown
But when I think about it when I don't have shit
Who could I call to get me some, that's the same shit
But I ain't mad, I check on my list
Get this money on these suckers, leave the suckers stressing.
And when I think about it, yeah, I feel good
You'd be another rich nigga out my fucking hood
And them crown bare niggas, yeah, they're hating on me
But I just grab my f'ing in and keep you scared, homie.
And that's money.

[Chorus:]
Is nothing important than money
Them Franklin, them hundreds, them hundreds
Is nothing important than money
So we hustling and hustling and hustling.
Is nothing important than money
Them Franklin, them hundreds, them hundreds
Is nothing important than money
So we hustling and hustling and hustling.
