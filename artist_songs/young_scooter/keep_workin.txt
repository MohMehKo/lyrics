[Hook: x2]
Keep workin, keep workin,
Keep workin, keep workin,
Gucci workin, Scooter workin
You a street nigga, keep workin

[Verse 1:]
Keep workin, we keep workin
I got big loud kush good purpin
Keep servin, keep twerkin
And you will never find yourself so stop searchin
I tow this 45 everyday for what purpose?
So I will never let a nigga hurt me
Hit a lick with you cause he worthless
Swear I never seen a nigga so nervous
The pack came with early on a Thursday
300 thousand, count that even 4 30
On super swag jet so they don't really search me
You got your good in the car by zone person

[Hook: x2]
Keep workin, keep workin,
Keep workin, keep workin,
Gucci workin, Scooter workin
You a street nigga, keep workin

[Verse 2:]
There's no days off, Young Scooter gotta work
With this remix dope I got the trap going berserk
If I fuck around take my shirt off baby you might see some work
I got bricks on top of bills
And I got bills on top of em
Bentley, rarri old school and I just bought me a M
Got 2 plugs in every country, so I take off half of them
I got jugs on top of jugs and I got bands on top of that
Behind 10 around rentals, I got packs on top of scraps
I got anything you want, you know I keep a lot of crack
Every dope boy product, in the country, count your sack
Pull up anywhere with them bricks, don't give a fuck bout where you at
Jugg house on every corner, I know how to work the trap

[Hook: x2]
Keep workin, keep workin,
Keep workin, keep workin,
Gucci workin, Scooter workin
You a street nigga, keep workin
