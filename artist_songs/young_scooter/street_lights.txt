[Intro]
Yeah nigga, we real mother fucking working my hood nigga
We don't get no sleep

[Hook]
We stayed down through them street lights
Spots opened day and night
We work out trap houses
Got a lot of bells pilled up
All I want is commas
I got a lot of money
Everybody know the streets
I'm the voice of the streets

[Verse 1: Scooter]
I just slipped in the project
I’m talking 2 hunned dollar rent
Plus I ain’t got no water bill
And I got illegal cable still
All I want is commas, I got dope boy money
Black amigo know it’s stunting
Now I’m million dollar hustling
For rapping bout my days of hustling
When I was broke and had nothing
By any mean necessary, let’s go
I jump from January to January

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Gucci]
I got places to go & I got people to see
It cost ya 20,000 to here my voice on these beats
I cut my girl off its to many fish in the sea
Fishscale in the house, its like we at Captain D's
It don't bother me that he go more than me
You know its loyalty over royalties
Got the bail money for you & the lawyer b's
I'm selling Florida keys, I'm selling Cali Weed
My Chinese plug sending pills, its insanity
She only 2 already using profanity
My amigo friend said I made a bill annually
You call them niggas yo robbing crew
I call them niggas family

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Juiceman]
Hounds and bills, yeah I know them well
Gotta weight my coke with this scale they wait a whale
In my trap house, I got that fish scale
It’s like a nail, sharp the way I work my clientele
Six hell form, I’m alone I make the mail
Keys to the city, yeah young juice man he the mayor
Stupid with the plug, and I’m a jig it off
200 hunned thousand dollars in …mode
All I know is ball, in these streets grow
32 free bands and we want it all
Drop a 36, dump it like I’m john wall
Skrit in the pot now my money in the wall

[Hook]
