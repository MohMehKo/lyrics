[Chorus:]
Count it up with my boys,
Ran it up with my boys,
Whipping damsels with my boys,
I'm still in it with my boys,
I cover for my boys,
Pass squirters with my boys,
Young Scooter be my whole name,
And all that so you know that
You ain't fucking with my boys.
I'm in it with my boys,
I'm living with my boys,
And Mac can tell you,
I can't tell, I swear to God,
I can't tell!

If you ain't my boy,
You need to get the fuck from 'round here!
Don't need you in my presence, nigga,
I can tell who you is.
Snuggle, that's my boy,
You witness me for a couple of whole miff,
Money, nigga, I ain't got no fucking record deal!
Leaning like a fool, point punched from doctor Phil,
Take a good look at my eyes,
It's all real.
I look back at my life,
Don't know how I live,
Let my boy, D.D. back to street, he kill.

[Chorus]

I wen with the same niggas from day one,
And the loyalty over royalty, we don't care about that!
Birds don't fly for the flocking, yo,
Every right or wrong, we be still whatever.
That B.U.G. shit, I put your face up to discretion.
My nigga Young Scooter for neffa,
Split pack with the ran, no presser.
A lot of money in our pocket,
Tell the bitch there is no pressure,
Now, you can say what you want,
But it look so we making note to note,
Two part shit, ain't making shit without my boys!

[Chorus]

In my whole round, wammy, and my boys stop for me,
The little pricks, they should think they cowboys how I fuck with them niggas.
You a sissy for a half a zip, my boy have seven guns,
Keep it real but you don't know it,
Cut my heart with my right hand,
Take a look, 'cause you are on hell's road now,
I'm telling you, you can't trust no damn fool, so nigga
You been black, no bitch, never been no bitch,
If they fuck with you, boy, I unload every stick!

[Chorus]

Skeet it up with my niggas,
Get richer with my niggas,
Fish scalfishes for dinner,
Well, you see, there goes the winner!
Take a rhythm with my nigga
With your bitch on a crystal,
She got a leaving with clubbing, blow it like whistlers,
I'm a hurt nobody,
I'm a nigga rocking like a canal stalker,
Screaming freak it, no, ride it!
[?]
Came up with my nigga Willie,
Stay, you ain't my bro, we ain't gon'fuck, nigga,

[Chorus]
