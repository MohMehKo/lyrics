You all about me, touching down like Julio.

Soon as the word touch me, make 'em Julio
Me and my bro sipping down Julio
You all about me, touching down like Julio.

All green grass stretch a hundred yards
Waiting on a jump, then my float abroad
Say you want some dovers, ask me what I chose.
A Julio to work, call me mister boy

You know I jugg and count on every beat I'm on.

For the long we're coming for cause it's necessary
