[Chorus:]
Way before this rap shit
I was getting packs in
All I rap is trap shit
Wrap it up and trap it, kid.
Way before this rap shit
I was getting packs in
All I rap is trap shit
Wrap it up and trap it, kid.

[Verse 1:]
Way before this rap shit
I was known to crap shit
And that was getting them packs in
Me ally green sauce and day was trapping in
Was the main that I live for them beans
Good father gave me care of them teens
I'm with the serving like I did service for a limousine
Comping them bunk and choppin
But if I tried to jack I was dumping
And I still land with the same fame,
Ain't shit changed, I'm just rapping for them
Before this shit I probably only win
A late four five songs down
Pick em all now, you should have seen me then
I was six feet, at edge to head the beans
Bad had a lack in a home truck
We fuck the others at.

[Chorus:]
Way before this rap shit
I was getting packs in
All I rap is trap shit
Wrap it up and trap it, kid.
Way before this rap shit
I was getting packs in
All I rap is trap shit
Wrap it up and trap it, kid.

[Verse 2:]
Had money before this rap,
Had bitches before this rap,
Had wills before this rap,
I've been rich before this rap.
I'm famous for that sack
Can't stop cooking this crap
Made a mill out of one scrap,
Jugg a mill' on one track.
I made it out on songs
And I felt like I'm on a run
Out in myth is where I stand,
I'm on you, no scrap.
And I never let my bank full, I walk around with racks,
I'm a fly this, I'm a camp here, my judge let me that.
Cause all I do is money wall
Yeah, I own a pack full
Everything I say is real talk
I come talking to the sidewalk.

[Chorus:]
Way before this rap shit
I was getting packs in
All I rap is trap shit
Wrap it up and trap it, kid.
Way before this rap shit
I was getting packs in
All I rap is trap shit
Wrap it up and trap it, kid.

[Verse 3:]
Way before this rap shit I was on some mob shit
She just trying to have lick and I was selling dummy brings
Won't you get this trapping, having this since mid-school
Young nigga I kept to, trap three and went through
It's still no game, gotta stand the cliff,
Hundred balls trying to make a flip
Run through it and get dumped to it,
Three hundred dollar up in here, do it.
Way before this rap shit,
You can check my rap shit
Went to trial to tail shit
All I know is gangsta shit
Marley get murdered, number
Young niggas my servants
Trapped out with no gudda
If you grab a nigga, I hurt you.
Selling balls as you die
Get a piece of that china white
Way before this rap shit
I was on some trap shit.

[Chorus:]
Way before this rap shit
I was getting packs in
All I rap is trap shit
Wrap it up and trap it, kid.
Way before this rap shit
I was getting packs in
All I rap is trap shit
Wrap it up and trap it, kid.
