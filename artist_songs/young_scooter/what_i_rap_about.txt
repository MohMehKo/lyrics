[Hook - Young Scooter:]
I don't play on beats I'm from the streets
That's how I eat I really do the shit I rap about
(Young scooter)
You're favorite rappers a pussy he ain't street
He ain't eat so he don't do the shit he rap about
I don't listen to you nigga's music rap to many lyrics
Count music what I rap about
My judge tryina play me cause my appeal fuckin hatin
Cause this cocaine shit I rap aboout (remix)
Count up [x7]
Free bandz all I rap about
Finnesin all this bezzin all this hustling and the struggling
You know that's the shit I rap bout

[Verse - Young Scooter:]
Cocaina diamonds wet like aqua fienda
50 bricks in the speakers
I I I gotta feed my people
You know everything I do illegal
The streets talking like scooter we need you
Cause I rap about the shit that you going through (true story)
And everytime it's a drop I come through
Yeah black migo storage jugs house with thousand pounds
Everyday they go in and out I was born in the streets raised
By the og s so the street shit all I rap about
