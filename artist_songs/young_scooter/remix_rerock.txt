Remix rerockin, tottin rockets came up in the hood
I ain't have an option but to sell D
Remix rerockin, tottin rockets came up in the hood
I ain't have an option but to sell D
Remix rerockin, tottin rockets came up in the hood
I ain't have an option but to sell D

[Verse 1:]
Already made so many bricks, so, so many splits
I don't tricked so many niggas, had to hit so many licks
On the streets I pair my Reeboks and I'm higher than the troops
And my chopper is on unlock more guns than a gunshot
I got this stuck up bitch just smoking kush, she said she got the hiccups
Smashed her with my pickle, when she call up I don't pick up
I walk in, I take my make up, splash the bitch then wash my dick off
I know you thought I did a show but I just dropped two half of bricks off
And I never stop trapping, I won't retire
These niggas just rapping, these niggas really liars
I'm smoking on power, whipping on power
And these suckers might swag but it really makes me prouder

[Verse 2:]
Rerock remix, remix rerock
Finesse king, I got brick shops
I break them down, they get polished up
And pulled back together, got bricks up in leather
So hot as a rock I put 'em on the block
And then ya'll traffic stop, I got all this guap
From the remix block, my hustle never stops
I fell off, I had to remix my way to the top
You want some free bands? Better rerock
I get 'em A1 and then I rerock
You try to kick the door you get here with a rocket
Number plugs 'round me, Young Scooter to sake

[Verse 3:]
Really I didn't have a trust or early age on top of the porch
Or early age I wanna go Porsche, no dope boy driving no Rolls Royce
Dope boy got me hosed much, you hear how dope boy got my voice
Used to remix out on banks and have my bumped down mix juice
Remix everything just to make a profit
Yeah, motherfucking money the only option
Man, I can't go broke again,
Gotta double up, double up, hustle up, hustle up,
Babe, I'm a hustle up your man a customer
I don't get murder over fucking money, what you know?
Used to be in your neighborhood in the center rows
You'll find out, you sent them hoes,
Put the blunt on fast, we spend it and go
