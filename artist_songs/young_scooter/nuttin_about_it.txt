[Intro:]
They can't do nuttin about it
Yea

[Hook:]
I write my check up, they can't do nuttin about it
We in them foreign coupes, they can't do nuttin about it
We got them bad bitches, they can't do nuttin about it
They can't do nuttin about it
They can't do nuttin about it, They can't do nuttin about it
They can't do nuttin about it, They can't do nuttin about it
I got my plug yes yes, they can't do nuttin about it
A hustler in the flesh, they can't do nuttin about it

[Verse 1:]
I gave a hunnit last night and I forgot all about it
Woke up the next morning like I threw all the profit
Finesse Dre out five bricks and he ain't do nuttin about it
I like to dress my dope up, to these bricks I'm a star
I keep my diamonds on shine cus these fuck niggas watchin
Tap down in the town, Bentley coupe I'm drivin
Dope price is up and down and you can't do nuttin about it
Car shot like John Gotti, I get shit poppin
Every move a nigga make I know my young niggas watchin
20 cars hit yo block and you can't do nothing about it
I'm a international dope boy pluggin with the fucks boy
Always flexin and you can't do nuttin about it, fuck boy

[Verse 2:]
They said I'm straight on survival
They straight finessin that louder
That Lamborghini I'm ridin
I catch yo bitch and I'm divin
She in a bush and she hidin
I fucked that bitch in the closet
Man we ain't tellin nobody
We put that shit on a spiral
Can't wave the magic on my list so we can fuck off some bands
She fell in love with that molly, whippin up in a Cayenne
Most of my whips are exotic, I'm a free man travel bands
You heard that bitch, I heard that bitch
Niggas on cus all my shine
Yea, I'm a international superstar and I get low like a movie star
Then I know plugs like Escobar
Poppin through all that work
Hope that you won't get merked
Been a astronaut since my birth
My chain hang on my shirt
My money always on first

[Verse 3:]
I said excuse me darling, you can't do nuttin about it
Tryna fuck that brick around and still make me some profit
I'm the last plug left, I'm the only option
Too much jail, money louder, dirty dollars

Bad bitch with me, all she do is roll up
It's that drug music, make you do the count up
Let me go, they can't say shit bout us
