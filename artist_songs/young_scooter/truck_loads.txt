Yeah nigga
One of a kind
Ain't nobody like black migo

[Chorus:]
All I'm thinking get my grandma off that dirt road
All I know is get all my niggas out the hole
My partner got a L still jigging down the road
I got clientele and I G without a phone!
I got truck loads, I got truck load
I got truck loads, I got truck load
Let's go!

I got hot stoves, tan dope
It was water whipped but I hit it with the Coca Cola
Let's go!

Word on the street, young scooter signed to Future
Word on the street, young scooter signed to Gucci
Word on the street, what the fuck is Scooter doing?
Getting street knowledge from every angle I've been doing!
I drop a album, five dollas off a cd
You used to be a boss, now you hood memories
All year around, I just jugg Christmas trees
My partner got a plug, but he really wanna fuck with me!
They took a lose gamble and tryna play it backstreet
He know I'm a roadrunner run I'll back like track lead
I could get it to your door, but this gonna cost a tax fee
Get me a million dollars you see three trucks a week

[Chorus:]
All I'm thinking get my grandma off that dirt road
All I know is getting all my niggas out the hole
My partner got a L still jigging down the road
I got clientele and I G without a phone!
I got truck loads, I got truck load
I got truck loads, I got truck load
Let's go!

I got hot stoves, tan dope
It was water whip I hit it with the Coca Cola
Let's go!

I got truck load, I got truck load
Express way, oversize load
I got jugg houses with no doors
Every room in it got a gold stove
Fuck the plug money up I bought it for my grandma
I paid them back and read up not answerin the phone for'em
Every truckstop in my city, yeah I own all of 'em
Every real nigga in Atlanta, I know all of 'em
I got truck loads, I make four fours
What you need, nigga? that's a ten foe
I got plug numbers, boy your trap slow
Truck loads, free bank roll

[Chorus:]
All I'm thinking get my grandma off that dirt road
All I know is getting all my niggas out the hole
My partner got a L still igging down the road
I got clientele and I G without a phone!
I got truck loads, I got truck load
I got truck loads, I got truck load
Let's go!
