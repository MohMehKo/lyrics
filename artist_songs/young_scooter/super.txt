[Verse 1:]
Got my childhood in the 80's that shit was crazy
Thinking just she had a baby, she just a baby
First pack I ever saw, my big brother gave me
30 off a hunned dollars, mane he tried to slave me
Shout out to my brother vic, that nigga raised me
Remember when I seen a brick, it was amazing
First pistol I ever had, you know I stole it
First car I ever bought, you know they stole it
My hawkers still smokin dope, but I can't judge them
I'll prolly never to vote, and ain't that ugly
I might just try a new approach, but that is doubtful
And I ain't gotta buy shooter, I keep a house full

[Hook:]
I was wasted last night I swear it was a blur
Can't remember shit, but I know I wore bur
Big super-duper bad bitch what I prefer
And you's a pussy ass nigga, that's what I concur
Pull up in my super sport, smokin super purp
Dough jumpin out the gym, I got super work
These niggas super-duper high cause they super lying
Super charger, got the super duper going on, super

[Verse 2:]
Dead flint, working I, stickin out like a porcupine
45 on my waist, I shoot this up like columbine
Tryina buy, my buy, I'm a shoot for all mine
Gucci and I'm hard to find, I come back with my seats reclined
Twirl talk, cook it, chicken pow pow
This might be on bail some, cause she let me slide by
Wise guy, mob ties, better have your shoes tied
Your girl know you a bitch nigga, she went and got a 2 time
Room full of camera people, I'm a let you slide
Last nigga tried the stupid shit, that nigga died
The earth it ain't big enough for us so one day gonn collide
And I ain't with no nobody protect me, I'm a ride

[Hook:]
I was wasted last night I swear it was a blur
Can't remember shit, but I know I wore bur
Big super-duper bad bitch what I prefer
And you's a pussy ass nigga, that's what I concur
Pull up in my super sport, smokin super purp
Dough jumpin out the gym, I got super work
These niggas super-duper high cause they super lying
Super charger, got the super duper going on, super
