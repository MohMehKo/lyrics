[Hook:]
Round of applause, round of applause to my certified dope boys
Round of applause, round of applause if you a certified dope boy
Round of applause if you got yo set right
Round of applause if you fuckin with that white, boy
Round of applause, all bosses get respect
Round of applause nigga if you like to flex

[Verse 1:]
Million dollar pink flipper, young nigga wrist whipper
Stance got a overflow, treat the safe life a stripper
Dolla signs, dolla signs, keep my plays on rewind
Served you last week, be at the same spot, same time
Watch it as it fell til the pounds got wild
Deserve everything I got, been grinding hard since a child
Just flexed on my ex bitch when it come to X6
I'm coming for the hustle but it's a blessing that we this rich
Big stacks, no rich game
Say hello to my clip hang
Ran off with the paper and get treated like the last mane
Owner of the dope game, too odd, trap God
Only touch the paper so the cocaine I applaud

[Hook:]
Round of applause, round of applause to my certified dope boys
Round of applause, round of applause if you a certified dope boy
Round of applause if you got yo set right
Round of applause if you fuckin with that white, boy
Round of applause, all bosses get respect
Round of applause nigga if you like to flex

[Verse 2:]
Round of applause if you ever seen a ticket
Ridin through my hood, BMG getting this
Round of applause if you ever flexed a nigga
Round of applause if you split it with yo niggas
Back in the days when them trucks pulled up
Sold 1000 pounds, BMG ran it up
Round of applause for the real street niggas
BMG tie, he a million dollar nigga
Ridin through the city, spend 100 on the veck
Catch me out nigga, I got them VV's on my neck
Round of applause for the real dope boys
Trappin out them laws, million dollars' worth of foreigns

[Hook:]
Round of applause, round of applause to my certified dope boys
Round of applause, round of applause if you a certified dope boy
Round of applause if you got yo set right
Round of applause if you fuckin with that white, boy

[Verse 3:]
Round of applause, VL got his set right
J comin back to pack yo knees fore they get right
Bitch yo hoe nice like, trappin in the air like
Addicted to the money, ATM but ain't east side tight
Turnt up to the max, 3 chains
Presidential Rollie plus his ass,
Round of applause to this F'in I just blast
V12, loosely let it blew past me
Shit, BMG smashed this

Round of applause for the mob, bitch we at it
No need for stylish, we overdo the fashion
Made it out of section 8, round of applause
So I spend more money, got horses on my drop

[Hook:]
Round of applause, round of applause to my certified dope boys
Round of applause, round of applause if you a certified dope boy
Round of applause if you got yo set right
Round of applause if you fuckin with that white, boy
