[Intro:]
A word
That's how ya feel
Though it's gone huh
Yea sir, I'm stupid
Slaughterhouse, nigga
Gangsta revealed

[Verse 1:]
I heard the whispers, they thought that I was dumb before
They thought Dre said I was something he don't want no more
They thought I got dropped, they thought I would stop
I thought not, hopped out the square, though out the box
Listen, I keep it real, I was hoping that the major work
But I was indian then, time for some major work
Already hungry, but the non-believers made it worse
Had me posting up in that booth like 8 date of births
Who was supposed to give up? Nah, not me
Man, post this shit up on RIP
Hello world, I'm a star, look what I invented
Rap radar identified with my spider senses
I had the hip-hop game on smash
And a title locked up, like Akon's smash
Then I link the three dudes who also say I'm trash
With another chance to show you again
So I'm holding this pen like

[Hook:]
Bet you never thought that you'd be back in this position
Got no answers for their questions
And it kills you just to listen
That you know
There's nowhere else left to go
And I ain't coming home
I ain't coming home

[Verse 2:]
It started with assault charges, beyanies, burglaries, some peeps
Ended up back alley blocks in Jersey city streets
Who knew that at the cross we're spittin' out cause off Hennessey vodka
The dudes that meant to be partners will mentally block ya
And man the pities to watch ya from Denis the lobster
But your own actions is what could esentially stop ya
I come around and the track get nervous
If you wrote them off, be able to track that purchase
Hooked up the IVs or we had be deceased in an year
Might need the grease fell on the reposition peak a year
If you're talking chain of command, I want to be clear
We're different links, packinfg that aid list of the G shit
Robber with the trash talk, the magical walk
With the black ball, way I bounce off the asphalt with catapult
Relentless through the rumors
In my mere presence, God got a funny sense of humor

[Hook:]
Bet you never thought that you'd be back in this position
Got no answers for their questions
And it kills you just to listen
That you know
There's nowhere else left to go
And I ain't coming home
I ain't coming home

[Verse 3:]
Bet you never thought that you'd be back in that position
I'm talking to you bitches, arch your back in that position
Your ratchet ass was missing, you thought that I fell off
But Shady aftermath musicians got you packin' ammunition
I'm back to circle gang boss
Witness the resurrection my career came 'cross
Jesus, name a vixen I can't toss
She use her mouth to clean my thing off
And I call it getting brainwashed
Slaughter's hotter than ever to be hotter
You got a critical error
Proud of your leather, walkin' in executives offices and halla you better
Hit my pockets with cheddar
Feed me paper like my my pockets are a document shredder
You really thought I'd get this money and behave?
Niggas left me for dead, and get the dougie on my grave
I'll break your purse for me perseverance
Them same labels getting weighed full for some clearance

[Hook:]
Bet you never thought that you'd be back in this position
Got no answers for their questions
And it kills you just to listen
That you know
There's nowhere else left to go
And I ain't coming home
I ain't coming home

[Verse 4:]
God's favourite, dark horse of the devil's family
I'm plan A till it's my damn day, failure's my plan B
From ashy to fancy, behind bars to behind the bars
They made it so I can fit an entire jail cell inside of my pantry
My daughter's a down, she loves to see her father come
She loves to blow bubbles with her bubble gum
Now she lives inside of one, just accept it
Got Martin King's heart, Martin Sheen's blood cause
Missed me with your questions
I am the Martin Scorsese of these professions
While I'm outta here like Martin Lawrence in, get to steppin'
And I did it doing the kind of music I like
You'se a fool, you thought the prim would be my only highlight
Slaughterhouse but outcasted, first we're here, then we're there
Then we started to rhyme like you pretend to load our pants with led
No we moving on dup like the Jeffersons
Cause things came full circle like the top of yours that hits through here, yea

[Hook:]
Bet you never thought that you'd be back in this position
Got no answers for their questions
And it kills you just to listen
That you know
There's nowhere else left to go
And I ain't coming home
I ain't coming home
