[Crooked I:]
Fuck the world man, we are the freshest
I'm higher than a baby on a seesaw with Precious
Y'all just the messengers, we are the message
You bang on wax, I beef off the record
Back like I trap, you can't spit this flow
I slang water, slang flour, I'm a get this dough
Behind my zipper where her lipstick go
Like an embryo in a hooker, I'm in this ho

[Royce da 5'9":]
Nickel!
Rright off the rip, nigga we are the dopest
Y'all in front of the camera, we are the focus
Y'all are the watered down, we are the potent
Y'all call y'all bosses, we call the GOAT then
We ball fo' sho' and, here we are fast cats, fly
Me and bombs over baghdad, B.o.B
The only thing I hate to see is hate
In the place to be

[Hook: B.o.B]
What an incredible place to be
Away from the bullshit, I'm fading slowly
Ain't no other place I'd rather be
Away from the lowlifes surrounded by money
What about nines and super freaks?
Bottle of patron, just roll that green
Put it down for the team
So while my bill is getting ends, take another shot
What an incredible place to be

[Joell Ortiz:]
I'm feeling like Cassius, at last it's the greatest
Angry intelligent rap, mad innovative
Y'all blast garbage shit, we blast the haters
Hip Hop's a community, we smack the neighbors
The last men standing when the shit get real
When the rest up we stepped up like a 6 inch heel
I'm getting used to how this rich shit feel
But don't judge me, I'm doing my best to make my dick sit still

[Joe Budden:]
Fresh in the strip club, he be the realest
Drugs got her number, she feel this
I said I need to love before I out her, not anything like a spouse
Told her the roof's missing, but everything's on the house
Got a table full of liquor, somethings gotta hit the spot
She might even put them on the glass if we mix a lot
Get her nice and buzzed
The night'll end when we decide it does

[Hook]

[B.o.B:]
You already know nigga, we be's the flyest
You might've seen high, but nigga we get the highest
Far as lighters, I need at least a 3 week supply with
Now all this pussy thrown at me, now I'm knee deep in 'gina
Bitch I'm bossin', fuck around and unleash Goliath
I go deep and get your poon all wet, call me Poseidon
I'm a giant, I eat beats and I burn good, that's my diet
B.o.B and Slaughterhouse 5

[Royce da 5'9":]
Nine, every time I scribble a rhyme down
Niggas be like (that's a riot)
Crooked, Ortiz, sick with the flow (that's a riot)

[Joe Budden:]
Or explosive, know it be like Floetry
So it's Ambrosis, I wrote it, know that it's cool to quote it
Joey!

[Joell Ortiz:]
L one hell of a relevant MC, felon ya melon is empty
So elementary, but Neverlands be residing in our pens, see

[Crooked I:]
R, double O-K, E-D-I
Far up and away, cause we be high

[Hook x2]
