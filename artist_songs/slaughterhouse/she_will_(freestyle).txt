[Joe Budden]
It go,
I told her, now go and pop that pussy for a real nigga
Fattest ass texting me all day but I still ig’ her
Don’t do the small talk
Wrong guy to deal with
She ask me for a vacay
All she get is a guilt trip
Niggas is talking to the feds now bugging out
Even got cassettes in they chest, Teddy Ruxpin style
Bitches is wylin’, they treatin me like they husband now
Do I got this white girl up stairs like this the drumming house

[Joel Ortiz]
Now go and pop that pussy for another real nigga
House gang bang bang, no Deringer
Long rifle big boobs, drip ooh shout when I come around the corner
Like a Vic’ Cruz route
Suck it with your boobs out
You fucking skank
Deep throat, please choke yeah gag like like a fucking prank
You know us Rican’s be freaking
So though we got dinner reservations later this evening I’m eating

[Chorus - Joe Budden and Joell Ortiz]
She just started to pop it for a nigga and then look back and told me baby it’s real
And I said bitch you crazy if you think I believe you but I’ma still get a feel
She said her head ground breaking so it’s only right I show her the drill
She cute so maybe she won’t, yeah aight nigga, trust me she will
Yeah
Do it for the hardest nigga spittin in the game right now, she will, yeah
Do it for the hardest nigga spittin in the game right now, she will, she will
If I can drop her off and she ain’t gotta take the train right now she will
Do it for the hardest nigga spittin in the game right now, she will, she will

[Joell Ortiz]
I mean..
Why the fuck would she not, she’ll play my side just to be hot
Hop in my ride, crushing these blocks, swallow her pride
Fuck them reeboks, red bottoms glide, girl get on top and
Leave those on and go with your squat, let’s make this porn
See the red dot? The camera’s on
Here’s your big shot
They say you shy, I know you’re not
Now prove ‘em wrong
Make it

[Joe Budden]
He can’t go the places I go
He ain’t been the places I’ve been
He can’t fuck the hoes that I’ve fucked
He don’t spend they way that I spend
Wait she hold that pussy hostage like a pimp is nearby
With me she always wanna lay up like a rim is nearby

[Royce Da 5'9"]
Hop up on that pole and wind
Overtime, take off your clothes and grind
She know she fine, she low-key no she mind
Look at the neck and the hoe get blind
Fuck your man, got a loaded nine
When I’m bowling for colombine
Put a bullet in his head, leave him with an open mind
And I poke his dime

(Crooked I!)

[Crooked I]
In the pussy, I go for delph
Why you think they call it box
Gotta hit baby below the belt
Whether coka or moka after I stroke a
I never broke myself
We into march, but may 15th, we be on your shelf!
Welcome to our House nigga (House nigga)
No Clarence Thomas
Running your lane, we sonning the game
So pay your parents homage
Each one of my gang is one of the same, I’m being very honest
Plus that paint so black on a Bentley coup I’m feeling Farrakhan-ish
I promise, so many tattas got my name on it
These strippers, they bring the parade on stage and I rain on it
Real nigga!
Man I’m getting this money don’t ask how
You get cheese cause of derrière is a cash cow

[Chorus]
