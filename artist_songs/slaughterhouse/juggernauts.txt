[Verse 1: Royce da 5'9"]
Hey, we ain't really gotta keep going through this
If anybody wanna rap circles round you my nigga
We 'bout to do it
You about that bitch knowing that swag that's it
Let me talk about us, we about that bitch throwing that swag
We about that sitting on that ave
Maybe because we sitting on that ave
We about that pistol in that bag
We about that fist fight
Only after we grab a fist full of that cash
We about that get right, what you are perceived the least but not last
We are sickest scribbling with that pen, that pencil and that pad
Ya'll talking this and that, so what
My click can wrap my dough up, now picture that
I write the sloppiest verses down you seen
I hand it in for green
So I can buy all my bitches bags with the stacks
And call the cash chicken scratch
Slaughter baby we just getting warm
Ya'll ain't fucking nothing we can't fuck
Ya'll ain't driving nothing we can't drive
If we can't afford it we just take your's
And ya'll little niggas just misinformed
Shady blew up, took the game, turn around
And ten years later he gave it to the

[Verse 2: Crooked I]
Some of you niggas is bitches too, you rocking panties, uh
Sitting down when you pissing too, you niggas trannies, uh
What you stand for is beneath me, you understand me, huh
Niggas get X'd like the professor and juggernauts running our family huh
Homie I was making checks before that Martin Majula
And nigga was rocking ava racks, now how rappers date my Xs
And I'm still rated X stick my dick so hard down a bitch's throat
It'll come out the other side and turn a blowjob into anal sex
Ain't no next cause I got now until I decide to bout about your style
It ain't gonna mean a thang cause I came to bring the pain like the Takaw
Nigga, now we're the juggernauts to this rap shit
Bust a shot with ya ratchet

[Verse 3: Joell Ortiz]
Ask the good niggas if I hung the block
Ask these broads if I slide on that glove
And uppercut that box
Man I come from the roughest so if I come up in this party
You bugging I'm telling you son is whack I'm a take off your fucking watch
And fuckin' put your beer on a nigga ears, scream juggernaut
Yeehaw, that don't mean that he nice ya'll get that confused a lot, 2Pac
And I sacrifice what I write for the newest drop big pot

With penim' in 'em, as a friends I'm touching his sentiments
That's cake, you know boys don't get it, so listen, let's make amends
We don't wanna be bullies, y'all don't wanna get beat up
So lift your knees up and start running
Or put your knees down on the ground and bow cause we're the

[Verse 4: Joe Budden]
Look it's House Gang on that city streets
Bet you already know that address
But it's huge they said and they assume they're dead
Before that body even hit that bag yet
Be face to face with them slugs
And they goons they load that nag
From the bottom of an ocean floor when you know a nigga found you ask for that drag shit and I
Blat, blat, blat, now you're spending with juggernaut
She just go sit by the pool till her nigga decide if I'm ready to fuck or not
Rappers contiginal anything other than raps, nothing we ain't discussed a lot
I'd definitely wait for your passion I'd do it for cash but they told me they upped the pot
Nigga you would too, if you knew, what this game would do to you
Been in this since 2002, look at all the bullshit I've been through
So called beef with nobodies, I mention them but they're nobodies
They say they killaz, that nobodies
I'm sober talkin' on no mollies
This joke probly won't throw off by the wind they club
Honestly it's worth for stealin' the purpose of these hallows and these broads
And really I'm having a much better time in the cab with these models on my nuts
The minute we ready's the minute you see us
Show these captains we're just love. Wuddup?

[Outro: Joe Budden]
What on Earth will the Fuck Boys do next?
Fancy they been doin' it
Getting fucked...
