[Hook - Royce Da 5'9"]
Me and you, (we coming), 
Your mama and your cousin too (we coming) 
Every rap bitch just in love with you
(we coming) 
We coming for 'em
Know what we doing, why we do, how we do it

[Verse 1: Royce Da 5'9"]
I said the kids to dog, everybody dying, no lying
Living the life of a serpent
My enemies said some shit, I’m rolling up in the viper
The wiping is perfect, wipe of this person
(Come out your house)
This is offense of my legit to get a blind defense
This reminds me that Joey checking Consequence
(Everyone enjoy their day)
I sound calmer than my mind, I’m hunting you down
Like you tryina climb the fence
Split your spleen while you with your queen
Fuck the mood of the room I like it ain’t no fiend
Obama take away my right to bear arms
I’m putting a sweater around the uzi and walking around 
With it like it’s my toy dog
Your boy bark like augment, augmentation takes place
Often that they face off
You calling me sober so I save the shit
I done drink so much I don’t even know what being famous is
The difference between the dealers and the ailist bitch
All I know is that I’m a heart skipping a sniff away
From doing a play to Taylor Swift
That will be the day you haters wish 
That day I’m standing a bet that podium at that Grammy show
Dressed up like The-Dream living a nightmare
Or zanny’s coke, handling more that I can throw
upon the shoulders of an addict
I’m Michael Jackson, Whitney Houston wrapped up in a plastic package
My only true concern is what am I gonna do after rappin
Maybe I’ll clap your ass and just do life, before I break into this new knife,
All I wanted to do is.. 

[Verse 2: Joell Ortiz]
Rappidy, rappidy, rappidy, rappidy, rap
That’s what I’m good for, now, it’s that nigga that asked you
Why you in my hood for?
You know them good folks, that’s your cousin
Oh your aunt live in that building
Well then your uncle should have told you
Don’t wear no gold like you just chilling
Now I’m gonna need that chain you wearing
No hard feelings, since I know the people you said you can’t fold to
Won’t be no killing
Though I’m willing to leave you spillin
Like oil when it fuck up drillin
I’m no villain, I’m just playing the hand I was dealt
Ain’t none of us out here did the dealing
We all grew up in a full house, we were a boatload of children
Straight from the project, faces flush, just finish stealing
This ain’t no poker face boy, you know bluffin
All that huffin and puffin, for what, you giving up something
even your life, on that ice, should have tucked in
Now see back in the days, when Yaowa was a trapper
Scribbing the rap ups in my trapper
Keep up don’t keep ah, calling me the same rapper
I MC, get it right, Jack Dempsey with the right
Mayweather with the left, Paqi-Yaowa, say goodnight
You don’t wanna box me papi, your footwork sloppy
I'll knock anybody out
That ain't no punch line I'm like Rocky
I'm a quarter of the Slaughter
Four fourths of a New Yorker
You know the aura
... Chinese order, Ortiz

[Hook]
Me and you, (we coming), your mama and and your cousin too (we coming)
And hood-rappers just in love with you
(we coming) we coming for 'em,
Know what we do, why we do, how we do it

[Verse 3: Crooked I]
My goon levels be equal to Beanie Sigel
Shooting out of a moving vehicle from the seat of a jeep eagle
Then I’m switching the jeep eagle ditching it for a cheap rigo
Come back with a street sweeper and continue to sleep people
When I squeeze lethal shots you meet evil
Drop the street sweeper cope the d eagle
Pop your sea regull
Hemisphere, the end is near, nigga the menace here
Bitches asking me if Em is here
Shit he probably playing tennis in his leer
Rocking the diamond worth the city of venice in his ear
While I’m getting more chin than
Hold on that shit is weird
I was gonna say getting more chin than a nigga tryina enter the guiness with his beard
Shady Records getting the ladies naked using baby effort
While you niggas inviting hoes to your crib
Knowing your spot is smaller than those on a baby leopard
Get on my level, maybe never, crazy Mercedes, navy leather seats linen
The streets fiending, to find somebody who know about
Putting there whole family on, you have to meet Keenen, Wayans, bar for bar where do I weigh in, no clue
It's Goku, I'm super, I'm just sayin'

[Verse 4: Joe Budden]
Next shit. Flex shit
right back on our shit again,
shady street, house gang
but they won't let us live with him
monday to friday, so pull up in a different benz
just too gangster, thought I was losing focus 
nigga switch your lane
politically acclaimed 
critically 

[Hook]
Me and you, (we coming), 
Your mama and and your cousin too (we coming)
And hood-rappers just in love with you
(we coming) we coming for,
Know what we do, why we do, how we do it
