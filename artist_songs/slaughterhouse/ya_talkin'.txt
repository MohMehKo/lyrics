Slaughterhouse

Some niggas talk that real shit
Others acute it
Some niggas get real brag and go just with it
Others they just go where they go
Where they go, it go, know what I mean?
You don't even acknowledge that shit is as dead nigga
I ain't got more to say about it
My voice does

These niggas actin' like I've reached my prime
They keep yappin', lemme speak my mind
When y'all keep talkin' I try to stay calm
Thinkin' how could you let a few negative communists make you perspire by your armpits
When you got your idle right by your arm shit
And you're only surrounded by monsters
Getting harnet just for sellin' Benny what I've accomplished
And your chick's still got my dick in the back of her mind right around by the time she's with you
For those who try to run greatness, today is your bedtime
Before I spuke whack cooks and dead lines
I would do fair time
And give me time to rap over your deadline
If it doesn't happen, it doesn't happen
Fuck it, I've been bubblin' from thuggin' and rappin'
Capturin', publishin', travellin' through the underground quietly
Under their noses like Tublin and Chaplin
You new school shooters, you're nothing
I'm from the old school like mullin' and packs
And you're bugged out till you bug an assassin
I'm dead accurate, run into me, I'm a led accident
Pardon my birddog threads if I don't appear passionate
They hear that last shit and think that I'm here for fashion
Till I take off my glasses and hat and that shirt
When they fuck the whole goddamn earth
I'm bare back in it
I rev and listen to the sound
Spittin' 13 shells till they hear clowns talkin', first week's sale
They don't know what they're talkin' 'bout
The writers inside the Slaughterhouse
The liars decided to walk it out
Long as we real we know that the fake won't employ us
We believe in fate though the fate won't destroy us
In muddy waters as long as satan tongue is avoided
We don't give a fuck if pitchfork don't support us
They say that problem marshal probably restored order
Why they rolling over a dollar looking for change?
Now I'm here and I'm providing them full of quarters
Courtesy of my boy Porter
As I'm submerged in this coy sporter
Probly ridin' around with a bird in boy shorts
Swervin' in a Panamera 4 door Porsche
Pressin' the pedal to the medal to let it breathe
I fuck her and tell her we can never be and she should let it be
Drop her off wherever and drive home to the nag and his bitch ever tell 'er she the queen?
And I would never leave and that's my life
Hated and loved I'm like when reality and lightning strikes at the same damn time
Cause I came from above it
Me and this gun keep discussin'
New rules have changed but fuck it with discussion
Just hang in the budget
Me and insane completely the same
My brains just retains genius things
Even though my memory suck all I remember to do is get fuck this up
You just bang my enemies up
Something like that, I can't remember, dang
I came from pennies to up, form denies to dealin' with puff
Like fuck denies I'm famous
I'm payin' my dues by payin' for shoes
And crucks for my cause, that's what I do
Huh I've got to count cash to do math
All I need to know it's if you're losin' you winnin' negative and winning's a plus
I'm the general of the tic tic team
Which means your 15 minutes is up
I'm sprinting and yea that does
You're chasing us minds and you in it and I ain't got it
Say who win it
The only time I slowed down is when it where I turned around and said eat it my dust after I finish my cup
You rap new jacks, who rap?
You can do like pookie from new Jackie
Go to the other side after you finished my dust
You burnt up by the other side like pookie
You'll end up another actor that died because he lied
Now it resides inside of an urn for tryna earn trust
I earned it because I don't trust nothing but my gun and my gut
This is how I'm cut
Rich enough to cut one of you little bittie bitin' ass niggas in
You'll be rich from just getting the little bittie bit of my cut
My bitch fly bruh
I'm hovin' over while I'm fuckin' over you
I'm holdin' her thighs up
Tell your homies and friends that I'm fuckin the friendly skies up
Don't thinks this kid fish drivin' while I'm nuttin' out ignite
If you're lyin' ridin' round and I'm getting it
Like 2 Chainz, in order for you lames to hit me
You gotta find me and bomb me like I'm Saddam Hussein

Never fuckin' doin' it, no
We got it
Niggas
