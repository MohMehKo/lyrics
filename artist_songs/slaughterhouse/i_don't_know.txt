[Hook x2:]
Man these streets keep on callin me
Will I ever make it out of here
I don't know [x4]

[Verse 1: Joell Ortiz]
Check man its something bout that rush that you get
When you cut up a brick
When you ridin by the narks right after bustin a lick
When put that V in park and shorty suckin ya dick
And you do that so much that fuckin forget
Its the way they respect you, its the way that they fear you
No one second guess you when you talkin they hear you
Its something bout that rubberband bout to pop and dimes trying to hold ya fuckin hand out the fuckin spot
Everyday a pay day, u never try to make way
Feelin like JJ, dynamite in ya hay day
They kick it like Pel√© around the stair like way day
Wake up and say hey, spontaneous vaycay
They mad like [?] u tryin to Advil
Its that type of morning, been up last night ballin
God spoke to me I know that rap my calling
But even with Dre's loud I hear that fast life calling

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Joe Budden]
Dog, the streets used to have my number
Back when I had the 15 inch screen
Middle [?] Hummer
Back when I thought it will be my last summer
Starin at the burner eyes wider than a plunger
Where on sight they would expunge ya
Had I stayed up wouldn't have lasted long
Taught me everythang at my high school they didn't have classes on
Older niggas passed it on
Its a gap in our generation these young dudes is [?]
We used to ask who snitchin but nowadays who ain't?
Had to keep the 4 pound every block had it own pound
If a showdown where to go down
They'll turn this shit into a ghost town
Lost so many niggas we could be goin fast
Honesty I don't think a morning passed I wasn't mourning who had passed
And after that life expecting
What we don't expect to see
Its a bunch of nigga breathing right now that after me
And I'm one of the few that made it out the hood successfully
I lose all my celebrity all my [?] Left with me

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Royce Da 5'9"]
Every now and then you gotta demonstrate
Bust a nigga head for old times sake
Look at those signs say
Welcome to the D
The city that sittin inside a mitten
You know the crime state
Where Jimmy Hoffa's body locked away in a safe
At a time in place where not even time safe
I wear a hoodie to war they talkin about me now
I wonder would he mature he suppose to be lookin for me now
Claim they hidin from me now
Until you find me with my foot in your door
The street said I made a sextape
No the fuck I didn't
If I did MTV would nominated me for a Woody Award
Thats off the topic tho
Niggas walked in my house and shoppin in my closet dog I'm not the store
With everything I do niggas still shit on me
See Boogie Brown told me get nigga get over it nigga this ain't like you
And Imma take cuz advice and move on from you niggas
Try to move on me Imma take yo life
