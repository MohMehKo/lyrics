[Dido:]
I am what I am
I do what I want
I am what I am
I do what I want

[Royce da 5'9":]
Yeah, I ain't with the formalities, nigga, my mentality iller
I cheated death like a casualty killer
They asking me questions like why am I not on reality television
I tell 'em niggas that my reality realer
I'm just a regular nigga
Of above average intelligence with a knack to write raps
Then come right back and sell it to niggas
You shouldn't waste trying me, time I mean
I'm the kind that'll lay you down if you looking wrong
Let the iron make irony
I ain't gone hit you with the tough talking, y'all get enough of that
Usually when a rapper do that shit that's just his luck talking
Hold up, if it ain't Crook, Joell or Budden
Then oh well, I'm living with more "oh well's" than "what if's"
If I don't sell, I don't worry
To make a long story short, bitch, I don't tell long stories
My mindframe and perspective is on some abusrd shit
Sometimes I feel like my brain's having sex with the word "it"
Fuck it then, shorty, fuck it then
Once I prayed twice, I sinned

[Hook - Royce da 5'9" (Dido):]
(Oh, I am what I am
I do what I want)
This ain't that singly, jingly shit
But go 'head, baby
But go 'head, baby
If I, I, I, I started to sing
What would it matter?

[Royce da 5'9":]
In front of my son I'm a son of a gun
Because his granddaddy been swearing at him for being [?] baby
And I [?] then fuck it
The same parenting method my daddy used with me I used with him
Even no one was rough then
Long as he know I love him so unconditional that he could even be gay
I wouldn't disown him for nothing
And all you niggas going "pause, pause", I'll shoot you in your fucking head
I love my mama
Can't even give her $500 without her being like "Ryan, you got your own problem"
I wish my big brother would just man up and quit copping, please
You an alcoholic, I'm an alcoholic
That shit ain't gotta stop you, fool, cause it ain't stopping me
You got some kids that I would like to meet
I ain't seen you in a while, but I heard you ain't a sight to see
We on the same team, why the fuck you fighting me?
Greg
We on the same team, why the fuck you fighting me, nigga?

[Hook]

[Joe Budden:]
Shorty, you gotta know I notice it all
You looking like you going through a joke draw
Remember I did that cushion shit to slow the fall
But now I gotta let a know-it-all know it all
I watch from a far thinking "damn it, you ain't grow at all"
Your soul hurting you thinking that I owe it all
Can't see how I'm so involved, I just love both of y'all
Still you thinking that you got played on that show ill
I'm thinking "bitch", but you got paid on that show, chill
Cause what I'm going through is much more real
A lot of friction back and forth with my addiction of pills
My grandfather 'bout to die, but let me know how he feel
Been a summer since his last breath, taking me out of his wheel
Trust me, if I could change these selfishness and treat her of selflessness
I would just to help this rebelliousness but
He ain't get that, nah, so I don't want the shit
He fighting cancer while I've been busy becoming it
He fighting death, I'm fighting life in a lifeless
If you both live it kills me to write this, I'm like
Fuck it then, shorty, fuck it then
This type of life should be a sin
