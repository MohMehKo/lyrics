[Intro]
As we proceed
to give you what you need
As we proceed
to give you what you need
Slaughterhouse up in this bitch
Get your bitch, make it quick
Joey, Crook, you know we shut everybody down
Bitch this ain't no club hit
This is a motherfucking stick-up
Quick, everybody down

[Royce Da 5'9"]
I'm about to rob the hardest nigga out here
Yes I'm on my joker shit
I keep a Heath Ledger for the joke of it
I don't plan ahead of them, I don't gamble
I just keep a four four clip
Full of bullets than resemble poker chips
I'm so the shit, bitches jumping at my poker stick
Slaughterhouse you know we sick, everybody down
Take your bitch, same bitch you wake up with
Make her trick till her fucking thighs hurt
Momma if your pussy wet, you shouldn't have a dry purse
Call me Ryan Rhinoplasty
I will augment your ass if you mess with God's work
When it comes to Drama, fighting second, homicides first
I don't look for Drama, Drama follows me so why search
Everybody, Everybody we gon need you quiet, shhh
Slaughter got a message, Everybody down
I'm a cheddar getter, you a teller
I don't care, whatever, I'll just scare the witnesses
I'm the illest in here, bring a pen and pad
And don't compare the sicknesses
Where the fuck the ruler at, so we can measure sentences
I am better than I've ever been, never been better
I don't follow trends, I set trends for the trendsetters, nigguh

[Chorus]
Slaughterhouse up in this bitch
Get your bitch, make it quick
Joey, Crook, you know we shut everybody down
Bitch this ain't no club hit
This is a motherfucking stick-up
Quick, everybody down
As we proceed
to give you what you need
As we proceed
And now the drive by

[Crooked I]
First I pull up on your block, let my entire torch
Spit fire, burn down your empire's boardwalk
Bitch I am melting my rims, tires, draw off
Porsche hit the wall, then my pills high as war-off
Crawled out, grabbed the new banana clip
Lascerations on my face
Travel agents shit I still plan trip
Ran up on the first nigga who had a whip
Eat to die a hero, or abandon ship
(Get out your car nigga!)
I could kill you now fuck a witness
I'm all about my business, you all about your bitchness
And I ain't bout to slow down
You oughta ask you daughter
about fucking around with Slaughter, You bound to go down
Ima disappear when you meet the Lord,
Ima be a border G for the single pro in me and more
Or bring a hoard or be a slur
Either or we ignore casualties of war you can meet the floor now

[Chorus]
Slaughterhouse up in this bitch
Get your bitch, make it quick
Joey, Crook, you know we shut everybody down
Bitch this ain't no club hit
This is a motherfucking stick-up
Quick, everybody down
As we proceed
To give you what you need
As we proceed
To give you what you need

[Joe Budden]
I get on my 'I don't give a fuck' kit
Fuck the money, fuck the wealth,
Fuck your label, fuck your lyrics,
You sit on a fucking shelve,
Lava so if ain't in the topic of the constant, the discussion fell
Tell the bitch that this dick game ain't no suck-itself
Nigga, I ain't no rapper I'm a mercenary
Every verse I bury, some will blame it on the perks I carry
Been in disguise when I failed or I lost
But they won't know I'm a god until I'm nailed on the cross
And these rappers is a mess, sad is if they best
Magnum to their chest, they could piss me
It won't matter what they said
They just rhyme, I just climb on the ladder to success
And maybe bring me some niggas that would rather me with less
My advice for the fuck boys: make some hard improvements
Career at a standstill how you gonna start a movement
Slaughterhouse the gang take part in what we doing
Or get steamed rolled over nigga pardon the intrusion

[Chorus]
Slaughterhouse up in this bitch
Get your bitch, make it quick
Joey, Crook, you know we shut everybody down
Bitch this ain't no club hit
This is a motherfucking stick-up
Quick, everybody down
As we proceed
To give you what you need
As we proceed
To give you what you need

[Joell Ortiz]
Yall just heard my man snap, this is rubber band rap
Twisted ?, Pop a xantax tell Everybody Down
Paid for life, fucking around
Uppercut a clown, fuck being playful pay homie with a frown
I don't think yall understand the magnitude
Mathematical, radical equations are easy to solve for power, yaowa
I'm the square root of a truth table, in the booth able to
Raise the bar for some part of the 9th power
I don't pick a fool, I devour
You think you Hot dog, I'm walking around with a sour
Crown and onions, buns and ketchup mustard, relish
Wow I think Ima fart, Everybody Down!
I don't want the crown, I rock a fitted navy brown
Well its blue but yall been colorblind since I'd came around
Nobody can see me, I'm pissed off like my pipi
Then bought it in ?, be easy, Slaughterhouse this is it

[Chorus]
Slaughterhouse up in this bitch
Get your bitch, make it quick
Joey, Crook, you know we shut everybody down
Bitch this ain't no club hit
This is a motherfucking stick-up
Quick, everybody down
As we proceed
To give you what you need
As we proceed
To give you what you need
