This is my motherfucking life (my life, oh yeah)
This is my motherfucking life (my life, oh yeah)
This is my motherfucking life

[Crooked I]
S-L-A U-G-H T-E-R-H-O-U-S-E
Yes we are the best in the biz
The west in the bitch
This Eastside LB money over coochie man
645 when dip through the burbs
I be on my Gucci Man
Smash on the gas, kick a bitch to the curb
House in the hills, thousands of mills
Getting wild in the field with your spouse in Brazil
All ounces and pills, how does it feel?
To count dollar bills that I found off skills
Check it out, Jets fly private
Nigga S5 Hybrid, baby test drive my whip
I’m in Bed Stuy with my chick
On my west side fly shit
Pulling out minks when the weather get chilly
Left Eye side kick
Now don’t you niggas go chasing waterfalls
These bitches wall to wall
And they love to floss it y'all

Sometimes I look around and I just
I just can’t believe it
I’m on a high like a falsetto
Maybe that’s why I feel like I’m dreaming
My eyes just quit
Look what I’m seeing, my life just shifted
I feel like I’m breathing
Light that spliff, now I don’t even smoke cause it burn my throat but tonight I’m steaming
Patron in my cup, holding mine up, toasting with this hood that I know I’m gon’ fuck
In these five star sheets put her right to sleep then kick the bitch out when I wake up
Even though baby girl got a large ol' ass
I remember praying that my car goes last
Now my car so fast that I don't think you’ll understand in a Murcielago dash
When it hurts but you ride through the dirt and you work til it hurt then you end up on Marshall’s staff
Hoping that your granny get to see you at the Grammy’s
Get a call from your family that your grandma passed
Then you know what you promised her so that you stay hot as a, thermometer, dipped in lava
So proud to be part of a conglomerate like this

[Cee-Lo Green - Bridge]
Every time that they play this
Put your hands up high if you’re happy you made it
It’s bitter sweet when I say it
But since I'm alive, might as well celebrate it

[Joe Budden]
What a success story
When the film plays it gets less gory
My son didn’t know who his pop was for years
Now its less Maury, God put it there as a test for me
Used to walk around with a vest and 40
Cops tryna mess hall me
Now babes with the 34F’s adore me
I took the rock and a hard place and made the best orgy
Now the fans approach I get paranoid
Where I’m from tell me never let you’re guard rest
But it’s simple to disregard stress
Hoes run to the bone, it ain't far-fetched

[Royce Da 5'9"]
Now the jets fly high shit
That Panamera Porsche that’s Ryan’s fly whip
As a kid I was poor playing tag, now I’m it!
For those of ya’ll that don’t remember me
I’m a Detroit Oak Parker
Went from no office to offers
I told ya’ll I'mma get my daddy out the post office
And so far I don’t really need to own my city
Just as long as the D is on my fitted
And my sons and my daughter and my wife is along for the ride
This is the motherfucking life
