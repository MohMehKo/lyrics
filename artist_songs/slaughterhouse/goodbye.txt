I remember it like it just happened
I could of sworn it was a dream
But in reality it hit me like a nightmare
Or at least that’s how it seemed
I just got a grip on our relationship
We was ironing things out, started picking up steam
And when we didn’t need it, when it all got heated
And we both said some things that we probably didn’t mean
God intervened, guess war was at stake
Thought we left nothing over, he put more on the plate
She came home from the doctor with news I been wantin’
Said family was incoming, she pregnant, twins coming
But that’s gotta be a lie
She sighed, couldn’t stop the tears coming from her eyes
That birth control she on, for them it’s suicide
But as long as it’s still inside, 2 of them, one survived
Hard turn from memorable to cynical
Picturing clothes for what would’ve been identical
Similar outfits, similar names
My deceased kid’s ultrasound in a frame
So I’m deprived of my chance to be a better dad
Staring at my twins that I never had
I shed a tear, looking up in the sky
Even though y’all just got here, goodbye

[Hook]
Goodbye, goodbye, so long, farewell
But it’s not the end of the chapter
Goodbye, goodbye, so long, farewell
I’ll see you again in the afterlife

My biological sperm donor, didn’t wanna be a daddy
So he hopped in his Caddy and turned corners on us
Turned on us out the clear blue
His last memory of his son is seeing me out his rearview
I still love him yo, but I love his brother mo’
My uncle showed me love no one could know
Young and po’ with a tougher road
To suffer hunger was nothing but Unc’ would hold
us down would help mom lift the motherload
I got chronin, I used to wonder what it would be like
To speak to pops as a grown man
He provided that feeling, told me to take my career into my own hands
He was there when I had no fans
My cellphone rings, and after I answer
A voice says “Your uncle’s been diagnosed with cancer”
Worst news in my life, him and chemo going 12 rounds with a disease
And they both losing the fight
I’m rushing up to see the cyanide
Praying for a miracle, I don’t wanna see my idol die
Before he did, the look in his eyes
Said “Even though you just got here, goodbye”

[Hook]

[Bridge]
I’ll see you again in the afterlife
Someday in heaven we will reunite
The flesh disappears but the soul survives
Till next time, my friend, farewell, goodbye

I walked in your daughter’s house, knowing that you gone
But still looking out the corner of my eye, hoping you on the couch
That call felt like I was beef, that got shot up
Ironic, I was on tour with Tech N9ne and Slaughterhouse
E tried to talk to me, crystal rubbed my back, as they were pourin’ out
I caught the next thing soarin’ out
Now I’m in the air, in the midwest somewhere
They said turbulence was severe, I don’t know what they talkin’ bout
I ain’t feel a bump, body numb, mind drifting
I’m sniffling, asthma acting up, I’m whistling
My mothers face looked so much different
I’m kissing, my son, my aunt pacing in the kitchen
My vision blurry, still I saw your face clear
What a loss, this time I did more than waste beer
Michelle’s strong, she held on, we got all the way there
Then we walked in, she fell on the floor, this ain’t fair
You was the voice when I considered them thoughts that ain’t clear
Hey granny, I was fifth row at the Grammy’s
An award they ain’t hand me, but I sat behind Will
And right in front of Wayne, and got seen by the family
I miss the early morning convos, believe me
Regis on the TV, and the best baked ziti
But you had an old white affair, grandpa’s all fly
Even though you been got there, goodbye
