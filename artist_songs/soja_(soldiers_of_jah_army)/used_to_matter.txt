See these days it's different,
It's all new.
The world is gone and I am too.
Wishing I was closer to,
Back when it used to matter.
All my coins are gone,
It's plastic now.
My iPod's got me asking how,
Could all my albums take me down?
Back when it used to matter.

[Chorus:]
Now it seems,
That we are all wrapped up so tight,
Life just can't get in.
And I feel,
That we can't see.
Now it seems,
That we are all wrapped up so tight,
Life just can't get in.
And I feel,
It's not maybe.

So my watch is worthless,
So is my pen.
And it seems nothing's greater than,
Something that takes me way back when.
Back when it used to matter.
All the words I write are on a screen,
And the friends I have are mad at me.
And there's no record of anything,
Now we all cease to matter.

[Chorus]

So the time when you turn 22,
But they're gonna wait to bury you.
Cause you've got a 9-5 to do,
And that's supposed to matter.
And you replace your time in between,
With other people's hopes and dreams.
And live their lives on your T.V.,
And now you don't even matter.

Oh it seems,
That we are all wrapped up so tight,
Life just never gets in.
And I feel,
That we can't see,
That we can't see.
Oh that we,
Oh that we,
Are all wrapped up so tight life just never gets in.
And I feel,
That we can't see.
It's not maybe,
It's certainly.
And I know we can't see,
I just want us to be,
Who we're supposed to be.
Who we're supposed to be.
Who we are,
And well doesn't it seem kind of far?
From the original plans of the stars,
Back when it used to matter.
