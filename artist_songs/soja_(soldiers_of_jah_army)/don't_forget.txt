It wasn't you, its just the way we
Roll the dice, if these
Cards would fall right
It wasn't you, it's just the
Timing and the place that's wrong
And something is gone, but

Don't you forget about the life 
That we talked about you

Cruise and you're forgetting:
Table's got a leg to stand on,
A life to hang on, it's
You that you decieve

It wasn't you
Who put yourself in all these
Games, these neverending
Ways, yeah...
I know it's not you
Cuz I can feel the fire
Blaze those same
Light rays, yeah

It wasn't you
Cuz every little thing
Has changed, but
I know it's never too late
We all need some legs to stand on
