Everyday all of these crimes are committed,
And everyone's acting like no one knows
The role models we see truly
Teach us the ways of desperados
They desperate upon the Tv
Theu got theis message on the radio
For economic gains, wicked games they play,
As they come upon video.

When our life needs correction,
Look in our own mirror.
Or are you scared of your own reflection?
Look in your own mirror.

Everyone is all about the vanity,
They talk how thy pimp and roll.
Everyone all about the pride, you see
Everyone talking about who they know.
Everyone all about the murder and greed,
They talk how they killed and stole

When our life needs correction,
Look in our own mirror.
Or are you scared of your own reflection?
Look in your own mirror.

Our governament is not better,
They trully ate the biggest gang of all.
And when it's time to blame a teacher
For the student's downfall...
When it's time to check the root
To see why the branch won't stay alive
Well in America the truth it always has to do
With twentu, ten and five.
