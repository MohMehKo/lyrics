[Damian Marley:]
Now greetings to the world, voice of the one called Big Gong-zilla
Alongside SOJA, ooh-wee, yeah, do it, Jah

[Verse 1:]
What a big world and I’m glad to be in it
We’ve got a purpose and I’m starting to get it
And I won’t stop until I’m gone
And I won’t change what I’m doing ‘til I’m done
I’ve got time and I plan to go with it
Forget about the money, ‘cause I don’t get it
And I know I’ll come again
Yeah I know but until then

[Chorus:]
If you see me forgettin’, forget who I am
Just try to remind me put up your hands in the stands
If you see me cryin’, if you see me alone
Just try to stay by me and keep singin’ a-long

[Verse 2:]
I appreciate the chance of livin’
I realize that it’s all about givin’
I will stand in the sunshine
‘Cause I know the sun is not mine
I’m tied in to the dirt and the land
The wind in the trees and the waves in the sand
And I know I’ll come again
Yeah I know but until then

[Chorus:]
If you see me forgettin’, forget who I am
Just try to remind me, put up your hands in the stands
If you see me cryin’, if you see me alone
Then I start singin’, just keep singin’ a-long
So I can live a song

[Damian Marley:]
So if I slip, get lost upon de trip
And if I lose a grip on reality, beg you do not make me drift
It’s not as if, because I have a gift,
That me nah could no take some good advice
And you say word, I’ll take a tip
Like maybe this, one too many spliffs, one too many sips
Not enough sleep and too much ‘milla skip
Some time to escape, everyone need a lift
Don’t watch no face

[Chorus x2:]
If you see me forgettin’, forget who I am
Just try to remind me, and put up your hands in the stands
If you see me cryin’, if you see me alone
When I stop singin', just keep singin’ a-long
So I can live a song

[Damian Marley:]
Yeah, yeah
Now once again, greetings to the world
Take care of one another, ya know
Am I my brother’s keeper? Yes I am, yeah
Voice of the one called Big Gong-zilla alongside SOJA, uh huh
Jah bless us all
