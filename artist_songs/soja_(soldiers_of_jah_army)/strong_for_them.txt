Strong for them, I will be strong for them 
I'm gonna be strong for them
Strong for them, I will be strong for them
I'm gonna be -

All those soldiers who've gone off to war
before they knew what they're fighting for.
All those soldiers who've gone off to fight
before they really understood why.
All those soldiers who feel alone
cuz they've just right now figured out what's really going on.
Just know that you and me we both want you home...
So send them home.

Now I'm gonna be strong for them, I will be strong for them
Strong for them, I will be strong for them
I'm gonna be -

All those people defending their homes
from these bombs, and these tanks, and these guns.
Seen their brother and sister shot down,
Seen their mother and their father...gone.
Seen their future go from bad to worse,
Seen their last resort become their first.
And we act like they don't hurt,
Like they don't hurt.

Well, I'm gonna be strong for them, I will be strong for them
Strong for them, I will be strong for them
I'm gonna be -

Cuz it's so easy to see your own side,
And to tell yourself that you alone are right.
We all do it, all women and men -
Every king, every ruler, and our president.
Not on your house alone falls Jah rain.
Now live for yourself, and you're gonna live in vain,
But live for your brother and you're gonna live again...

I will be strong for them,
Everyone.
I will be strong for them,
Not just some.
