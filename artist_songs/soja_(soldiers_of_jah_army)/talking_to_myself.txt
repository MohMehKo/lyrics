I stay up at night
When there's nobody 'round
When no one makes a sound
And no one hears me, as I'm talking to myself

And I stay up late
And roll another one
'Cause I run from the sun
I'll have another one, then I guess I'll go lay down (now, now)

The sun goes down
And the lights go off and the emails stop,
and the phones can't bury me
and I start to feel a life of memory

No one knows
Where the moon's in the sky
And the joints are out
And connect these stars we see, and the lines they write the song for me

And I stay up at night
When there's nobody 'round
When no one makes a sound
And no one hears me, as I'm talking to myself

And I stay up late
And roll another one
'Cause I run from the sun
I'll have another one, then I guess I'll go lay down (now, now)

Another round
Then I head down the road and I'm walking home
And my footsteps, they make a beat
And the faster pace they're caught up singling?

And my guitar is out
Then let's change this world
'Cause the system's broke
And there's human equality, and the stars they write these songs for me

And I stay up at night
When there's nobody 'round
When no one makes a sound
And no one hears me, as I'm talking to myself

And I stay up late
And roll another one
'Cause I run from the sun
I'll have another one, then I guess I'll go lay down (now, now)

Then I guess I'll go lay down

I really should go lay down
'Cause it's getting so late now
'Cause it's getting so late now
'Cause it's getting so late...

Oh, I'm up at night, when there's no one around.
