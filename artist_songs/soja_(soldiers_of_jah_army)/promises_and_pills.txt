In war, combat is so heavily prepared for
Returning home is something no one is really there for
Half the team is gone, and the half that makes it home
They gotta deal with the terrorism, in their skull
But there's a cure the government likes to hit them with
Prescribing promises and pills
But the side effects is no sleep, no peace
Looking for reasons for living as the war moves on
America. The System.

Reintegrate me, you made me a killer
Like you could trade me for everything I've lost
And look how you made me make me
Think about me taking my own life
When I remember what went down

And you say that I'm the reason for the freedom of this land
So I land in their backyard, I've got your rifle in my hand, and
They defend themselves, you know of course I do the same, so
We go kill each other while you go about your day

Reintegrate me, you made me a killer
Like you could trade me for everything I've lost
And look how you made me make me
Think about me taking my own life
When I remember what went down

And I don't sleep at night and I will never be the same
And my wife is terrified by these details I can't explain
And my soul is beat to shit and half my friends are dead and gone
For all these fucking games you play, we pay the price with our own blood

Reintegrate me, you made me a killer
Like you could trade me for everything I've lost
And look how you made me make me
Think about me taking my own life
When I remember what went down

Put a warrior in hell, now he's finally back
With images in his brain of every damn attack
Every bomb, every friend that's never coming home
Every innocent life taken, for reasons unknown
Then we abandon them, the same ones that did all the killing
We no longer deal with them, just their spouses and children
And the memories in their head from every damn mission
And the war moves on America
The System

Reintegrate me, you made me a killer
Like you could trade me for everything I've lost
And look how you made me make me
Think about me taking my own life
When I remember what went down
