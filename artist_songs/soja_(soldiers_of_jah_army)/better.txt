Hello
True, we know we far away from us
Two, we know we far away from one, and…

[CHORUS:]
If I can’t make it better
And you can’t make it better
Then what are we to do now? Now?
Spend our lives in limbo
Wondering if what I wrote
Is ever coming true? True?

Cause we spent our days together
As if before were never
Like ever days at all… and now… and now…
And you said I’d be the one
The one who got away from, from you
You knew it all… it all… well…

[CHORUS:]
If I can’t make it better
And you can’t make it better
Then what are we to do?
Tell me what are we to do now?
Spend our lives in limbo
Wondering if what you wrote
Is ever coming true?

Tell me where did we go wrong?
Tell me how it’s been so long?
And tell me where does it go?
And tell me where does it go now?
And tell me is it still right there?
And tell me has it disappeared?
And tell me how do I know? I know… well…

[CHORUS:]
If I can’t make it better
And you can’t make it better
Then what are we to do now?
Spend our lives in limbo
Wondering if what we wrote
Is ever coming true?
Is ever coming true?

Oh angels high up above
Come fill us now with your love
We don’t know what to do
We don’t know what to do
And we speak right now in silence
Over a million miles of distance
Like 1,000 years removed
And we don’t know what to do

[CHORUS:]
If I can’t make it better
And you can’t make it better
Then what are we to do?
And tell me, tell me
Spend our lives in limbo
Wondering and keep coming back
A little phone call
A little weakness becomes a broken heart
And then the tears fall down your face
And you turn away from your computer screen
But it won’t stop, and it won’t change
Until we walk away, until we walk away
Hey, angels up there help us now
We’re running ourselves down and out
And we don’t know what to
Don’t know what to do at all, at all…
At all, at all..

Two, we know we far away from one
Baby, we’re so far away…
