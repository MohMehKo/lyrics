[Chorus:]
I know it`s hard now for you to see
You can`t change how it was or how it's gonna be
I'm what she wants, you're just what she needs
And yet she still loves me, she still loves me

Where is her sweater? It’s not in her car
Is not at her friend’s house, it’s not at the bar
I think you better think with the heart
Take a look at yourself and see how lucky you really are
I don`t believe in luck after all
Neither does she, but you know that now
You should forget her, ‘cause I`ve got her heart
She hates the way that I tear it apart

[Chorus]

You need to focus on what really, really matters then
How she’s feeling when she’s crying over you again
And every single time you break a girl’s heart in two
There’s a little less of it when it comes back to you
And one day she could pack all of her things and go
And down the line she find herself at a Collie show
And even though she maybe thinks of you from time to time
Just know that, that girl is mine

[Chorus]

What does she talk about when her father calls?
She says what you say, she says that “old man, you're the one”
What does she talk about when mother calls?
And you don`t come up, you don't come up at all

[Chorus]

I know it`s sore now for you to see
You can`t change a thing about how it used to be
I'm what she wants and you are just what she needs
And she still loves me, she still loves me
She still loves me
