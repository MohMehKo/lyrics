Everytime I pick up a pen I think of you

Get back in my arms and just say you're by my side
Love notes of you have left me dry
Tell me where you go onto and when you arrived
Oh you never once left my mind
Tell yourself I'm sorry for these things that I've done
Oh tell yourself you never seen baby love that good no
Tell yourself it's over now and not to run
Just tell yourself I'm sorry for everything I've done

Everytime I pick up a pen I think of you
You're beside me in my mirror I still see you
The pages turn so fast I never got to read you know
Tear soak these pages and now your words bleed through

Who's listening now I'm talking I don't do it too much
Girl this is the feeling that can sustain us
Whatever happen to the way that it was
One thing I can't have is what I want
Who decided it had to end up this way
Who decided that you can not stay
And you won't be here at the end of the day
Cause I can't even listen to what I say

Everytime I pick up a pen I think of you
Oh suddenly you're in my mirror and I still see you
The pages turn so fast I never got to read you know
Tear soak these pages and now your words bleed through

Quite in my house outside sound fills up my home
Everything reminds me of my lawn
Quite you used to be and now that you're gone
Not a sound not a word not a tone
It's quite when I'm drinking
And it's quite when I smoke
And it's quite when I'm eating
And I sleep alone
It's quite now it's louder than
Stand still like a stone
Only from my dream where you still hold on

Everytime I pick up a pen I think of you
Oh I look beside my mirror I still see you
The pages turn so fast I never got to read you know
Tear soak these pages and now your words bleed through

Don't pick up that pen
All I do is think of you
Don't look in my mirror
All I see is you
Pages turn pages turn
All the tears bleed through
Tears soak these pages
And all the words you left me with
Have bleed right on through
Everytime I pick up a pen I think of you
Even beside me in my mirror I still see you
The pages turn so fast I never got to read
Tears soak these pages and now your words bleed through
