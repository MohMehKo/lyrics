I used to think that I would go this all alone
I used to think that I would do it by myself
But I, I found another one like me walking alone
I don't think she stands a chance with no one else
But anyway...

I'll be here and you'll be there
And we'll be by the phone (and you know)
I'll be sitting, watching you waiting for you you decide your
You decide, you're gone

And when I'm calling If I'm calling someone else
It don't feel the same as when I'm calling you, I mean it
And in a world I more and more can't understand
It would be hard to lose something that I do
But anyway...

'Ll be here and you'll be there
And we'll be by the phone (and you know)
I'll be sitting, watching you waiting for you you decide your
You decide, you're gone

So watch the days cause they all turn into the night
And watch the sun cause it turns into the moon
And in a world that won't stop turning us around
At least we know who we can turn to
Now...

I'll be here and you'll be there
And we'll be by the phone (and you know)
I'll be sitting, watching you waiting for you you decide your
You decide you decide
I'll be there and you'll be here
And we'll be by the phone

And I'll be sittin while I watch
I'll be watchin while I wait
For you to decide that you're gone

Is it too much
Is it too far
Is it too long
And now you're gone
And I'll be here and you'll be there
And you can decide that you're gone

Cause it's too much
And it's too far
And it's too long
And you are gone
And you decide your
You decide your gone
