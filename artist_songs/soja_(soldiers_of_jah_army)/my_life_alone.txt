Oh my God I'm alone in Your world
With only what you gave me.
And I'll be fighting until all the end,
with only what you brought me...

That's the way life goes
My life alone.
That's the way life goes
Lead my life alone...

Takes one knock if you know how for Zion to open,
If your hands are clean and your heart is pure.
"Out of many who are called, few shall be chosen..."
- there's no guarantee on those doors.

That's the way life goes
My life alone.
That's the way life goes
Lead my life alone...

I'm looking down on Jah creation,
I can only imagine what Jah sees when he looks at we
When everyone fights with no solution,
Tell me what will become of me?

That's the way my life goes
My life alone.
That's the way life goes
Lead my life alone...
