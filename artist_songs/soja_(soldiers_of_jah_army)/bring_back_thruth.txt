Think for yourself or be thought for, and,
Fight for yourself of be fought for, but
Find for yourself or be lost for ever;
you never know when it's gonna come.  It's like...
Careful the game that you've been playing,
Every night and every day, and - or
You might just find yourself saying,
"Damn, I never really thought it would come..."

What people want, you know,
is for someone to bring back truth...
And that's just what we want to do,
That's what a soldiers destined to do.

Just like the tree that's been planted by Jah
water, you can never end it.
The worst you'll do is transplant it, believe me -
We've already seen that day come.
No guarantee on tomorrow -
could bring you joy, could bring you sorrow,
so be careful how you beg, steal, and borrow, cuz
you never know when that day will come.

What people want, you know,
is just someone to bring back truth...
That's what I was born to do.

Truth is still revealing, and
closets will need cleaning, I'm
still searching for the meaning -
can't stop me cuz I know it'll come.
And while... artisis repeat the same phrases; they...
copy the words off old pages; man,
being someone else is dangerous...
Jah search me cuz you know that I'm one...

What people want, you know,
is for someone to bring back truth...
Soldiers of Jah Army destined and we blessed to do.
