When I look to see the sun, I can feel positive and negative at once
It could be a brand new day or the same old one
So I wait just to see exactly what kind of day it's gonna be
Looking my head straight up, life is what I need

And I could be gone today, tomorrow could be close or it could be so far away
And well I guess what I'm trying to say, if you can hear me now just know I'm so, so happy 

When I look to the see the moon, I can see those before me who've all done it too
I can see through all me troubles and somehow they got through
Cause we're all family even if we don't act like it or just don't see
I guess I'm thankful for who you think we could be

And I could be gone today, tomorrow could be close or it could be so far away
And well I guess what I'm trying to say, if you can hear me now just know I'm so, so happy today, right here

There could maybe be something else, else
Like not something you see or touch but something that you felt
And there could maybe be a road, a road
It's like underground sin, it stays in the corners of my soul

Cause I could be gone today, tomorrow could be close or it could be so far away
Oh, I guess what I'm trying, trying to say, if you can hear me now just know I'm so, I'm so happy...
