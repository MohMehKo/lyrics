I told her "let's take it slow", she heard "forever" instead
I said that "this is a start" and she heard the same thing again
So I didn't say one word, but what she heard in her head
Is all that she wanted to hear, damn

I tried to tell her before, the words they come out too late
And then she went for the door, and I didn't stand in her way
And then she got to the door, and these were the words that she said
"Dont ever call me no more" I think she really meant to say

"Call me, never let me go" and I said "I told you so"
There's no chance, no I will never ever change
Cause I'm still in love with yesterday

"Call me, never let me go" and I said "I told you so"
There's no chance, no I will never ever change
Cause I'm still in love with yesterday

It's the same old story, the story goes:
"Once upon a time, in a land far away
There was a princess alone, alone in need of king
And then he rides into town and she gets carried away"
Yeah, she got carried away
I think she wants to hear me say

"Call me, never let me go" and I said "I told you so"
There's no chance, no I will never ever change
Cause I'm still in love with yesterday

"Call me, never let me go" and I said "I told you so"
There's no chance, no I will never ever change
Cause I'm still in
Love love never let me
Go go you never let me
No no no no don't ever let me go
Not livin in yesterday
I find a confiable place to stay
I told her "let's take it slow", she heard "forever" instead
