[Chorus:]
This is Jah Love, InI been waiting
And now InI found, Non-partial non-political

I love to laugh at all these partial minds
When they try to explain how I'm wrong
And they're right
Everyone act as if they know everything
They act as if they've seen what no man has seen
Each Religion claim to have true faith
Not one of you can say that you know my destiny
Some things are just best left up to HIM.

[Chorus]

InI have seen the truth, we are all created
Equal no difference from me to you
No difference from me to you
Every man is born naked, supremacist agree
But see they fake it. You spill all of this
Blood only to fight, you fight to prove
You living to fight, proclaim superiority and waste
My time, you may fool the majority but no the Most
High

[Chorus]

Jah is one perfect love, until the philosophy
Which holds one race superior and another
Inferior is finally and permanently discredited and
Abandoned there will war everyday
Jah is why we are all blessed, this Iniverse was
Created for man to live in peace concord
And happiness and the word of Haile Selassie
Is a blessing yes.

Jah is the unsearchable entity, no discussion
Underway over his divinity, Oh lord, there is much
More to see but nothing to prove, no need to worry
Rastaman got lots to do with Jah Love!
Haile I selassie I
