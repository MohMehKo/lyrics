Every time I close my eyes 
I find myself in the corners of my mind 
And I'm in there, here somewhere 
Under the covers I can feel it it's pulling me
No one can know where my mind goes 
My dreams more real than my reality 
And a memory inside of me will it be with me forever until infinity 

[Chorus:]
Waiting for my conscious calling
Listening to hear me talking
Slowing down the rate of motion 
Focusing inside a notion
Catching myself falling over
Looking back and seeing no one 
Walking through this Lucid Dream again

I never thought it would come to this
How did I get here 
What did I miss
I have been trying to find righteous  ment road
I wanna remember the womb of my mother wanna understand all the love of my father 
I'm so close I can feel it in my bones my bones 

[Chorus]

Now every day is only 
counting the seconds and minutes that separate me 
from who I am really am 
in this body temporarily on my journey 
Going going gone and I can feel it like a wrecking ball crashing through me
And I don't make one sound 
When I can hear it
As the memories prove I've been here 

[Chorus]
