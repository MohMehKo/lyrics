I came from nothing but not nothing like nothing
Nothing - like nobody thought I was something
Nothing - like called every name in the book
But for every second guess I never gave a second look, look

I tell myself, "Don't let it get to me!"
'Cause if the best they've got is not impressing me
Then there's no reason they should get the best of me
While they were aiming at my words they missed the rest of me, see

[Chorus:]
So how can I stop all these
Critics from their talking?
The more I do, the more they say.
But there's no way I'm stopping,
So they just keep on talking.
And who do you think I think I am?

I got the feeling that there's more like me.
Born in Babylon but you just got to be free.
Shackles on your feet that you and me can't see,
But you can feel them and they heavy,
So you need that key!
And so you're looking at your hands sayin':
"Man, if I ditch the system these could be mine."
But then you hear a voice come up from behind:
"Don't even think about steppin' out of line!"

[Chorus:]
So how can I stop all these
Critics from their talking?
The more I do, the more they say.
But there's no way I'm stopping,
So they just keep on talking.
And who do you think I think I am?
Who do you think I am?

My friends are deep and they're all I've got.
They stand up behind me if you like it or not.
And I'm telling you that the fire's hot.
Can you see that smoking?
Did you hear that shot?
'Cause this is war and in the middle I am.
So judge me now with your pen in hand
'Cause I'm too busy to judge another man,
Trying to write the blueprint for all the world to understand

[Chorus:]
And how can I stop all these
Critics from their talking?
The more I do, the more they say (more they say, yeah)
But there's no way I'm stopping,
So they just keep on talking.
Who do you think I think I am?
Who do you think I am?

How can I stop all these
Critics from your talking?
The more I do, the more they say.
(They won't stop talking)
(They won't stop talking)
But there's no way I'm stopping,
They won't stop talk, they won't stop talking
There's no way I'm stopping

Maybe I should not be myself
(Who do you think I am)
As I've just giving the critics help
(Who do you think I am)
And it makes me twist my stomach in half
(Who do you think I am)
(Who do you think I think I am)
(Who do you think I am)
If I never tried to do this at all
(Who do you think I am)
And I think he'd be out of a job
(Who do you think I am)
And maybe I just should've stayed in bed
(Who do you think I am)
Stay out of the booth and put all these guitars in the closet
(Who do you think I am)
Maybe I should go back to school
(Who do you think I am)
But anymore education just makes me feel like a fool
(Who do you think I am)
So I guess I gotta let critics talk
(Who do you think I am)

Cause I won't stop.
