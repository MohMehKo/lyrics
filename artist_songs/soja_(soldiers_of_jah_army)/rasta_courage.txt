Try and remember now just what has been done.
Enslavement, displacement of every nation.
And now to one nation, everyone hold their grudge.
Kind of makes me wonder about which side I'm on.
I don't defend white, and I don't defend black.
I defend truth and rights and all of that.
I work on situations where I'm at
Hold my position and never fall of track.

[Chorus:]
Nah give up my faith!
Though Babylon rage,
I and I will strive until
The end of my days.
Go against society, Rasta courage.

I never give no good vibes
And I never give up no truth.
Never trade my sanity for living in Babylon crew.
Vanity will never drive this man insane.
This man will walk alongside Jah again.
We see all of the pressure to conform today,
And I may sometimes bend,
But only as not to break.
'Cause a life of iniquity for laziness' sake
Is a deal with the devil Rasta just can't make.

[Chorus]

Looking back now upon all of the evidence
400 years and what those years have
Really done, we talk of peace but at the
First sign of war. Bredren and bredren and
Sistren ain't sistren no more.
Without forgiveness how will any war cease, while the heathen rage
Rastaman sitting at ease. No one will move a
Muscle for some moral justice and with no justice, there will be no peace.

[Chorus x3]

Looking back now upon all of the evidence
400 years and what those years have
Really done, we talk of peace but at the
First sign of war. Bredren and bredren and
Sistren ain't sistren no more.
Without forgiveness how will any war cease, while the heathen rage
Rastaman sitting at ease. No one will move a
Muscle for some moral justice and with no justice, there will be no peace.
