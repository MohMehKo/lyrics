It’s hard for me when I think about the things that never been
They keep coming back again like they’ve got something to prove
I love my memories
But they have a way of controlling me at times
And I’m so lost without you, yea, yea, yea
And I can’t get far from it
And from what went wrong
And I know it’s stupid
Cause it’s been so long
The farther I get away
The more I hold on
It’s just this feeling I get
It’s like I’m not done yet

I’m not done yet 
I am not done yet 
I’m not done yet 

I think about those times
When we were young
And everything was so
Brand new and our words so true and you
Looked into my eyes the one last time
If I had known back then
Would I be living with today
We might have stayed, but
I can’t get far from it
And from what went wrong
And I know it’s stupid
Cause it’s been so long
The further I get away
The more I hold on
It’s like I try to forget
Somehow I’m not done yet

I’m not done yet 
I am not done yet 
I’m not done yet

It’s hard for me when I
Think about the things that never been
They keep coming back again
Like they've got something to prove

It’s like I’m not done yet
I’m not done yet
I am not done yet
I’m not done yet
I’m not done yet no [x3]
I’m not done yet
I am not done yet no
I’m not done yet no [x3]
I am not done yet…
