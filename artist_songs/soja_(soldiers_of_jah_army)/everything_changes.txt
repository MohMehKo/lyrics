What do we really need
In this life?
I look at myself sometimes
Like it's not right

People out there with no
Food at night
And we say we care, but we don't
So we all lie

What if there's more to this
And one day
We become what we do
Not what we say

And we end up in
All the shit that they're in
And roles are reversed
And it was different

And we were the ones
With nothing to eat
And we were the ones
With blood in our streets

We were the ones
With only our screams
And they were the ones
Just watching on TV

We were the ones
Broke down and torn
With our life on our back
And our wife in our arms

And they were the ones
Like damn that's so sad
We were the ones
Like

Nothing ever changes
It's the only thing I know
Nothing ever changes
I'm looking down this road
And nothing ever changes
No, nothing ever changes

Look at your dreams
And your intention
How selfish it is
For you to mention

Turning your thousands into millions
Marry a model
And you have some children

Well they've got their dreams too
I imagine
Like water that won't
Come back to kill them

Sleeping at night
Without a murder
In some little town
You've never heard of

Now look at your nightmares
And all of your worst fears
Your car and your house
And your girl
And it stops there

All these things
You can't imagine loosing
Like oh no
What if that happened to me

Well what you've got
They'll never have
To be like you
To have your chance
To be like you
Before they're gone

Nothing ever changes
At least that's how we act
Like nothing ever changes
Like god has got our backs
Like nothing ever changes
I'm looking down this road
And I can see this pain, yes
It's only gonna grow

Maybe we need more
Shoes on our feet
Maybe we need more
Clothes and TV's

Maybe we need
More cash and jewelry
Or maybe we don't know
What we need

Maybe we need
To want to fix it
Maybe stop talking
Maybe start listening

Maybe we need
To look at this world
Less like a square
And more like a circle

Maybe just maybe
God's not unfair
Maybe we're all his kids
And he's up there

Maybe he loves us
For all our races
Maybe he hates us
When were all so racist

Maybe he sees us
When we don't care
And it's heaven right here
But it's hell over there

And maybe the meek
Will inherit the earth
'Cause it was written before

So everything changes
Nothing stays the same
No everything changes

And if you feel ashamed
Maybe you should change this
Before it gets too late
Maybe you should change this
We're standing at the gate

Everything changes, changes, changes
Maybe you should change it, change it, change it
Everything changes, changes, changes
Everything changes
