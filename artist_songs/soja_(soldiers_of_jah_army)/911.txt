9-1-1 is the battlefield that we're living on.
Trust in the Most High Father Jah Rastafari to keep InI strong.
911...

It's 9-1-1, when it's just begun, And there's a setting sun in Babylon.
9-1-1, when it's just beginning,
and there's no rising sun so they're gonna make one.
Cuz there will be wars, and rumors of wars.
And it won't stop when someone wins.
Bigger weapons are made 
and your whole life will be taken
and it won't end until the end.
And we're all left feeling like there's no time for kneeling,
But if no one does, no one will.
Choose to be that chosen and make that first step-
Aim to love, don't shoot to kill.

In 9-1-1, when it's just begun
And there's a setting sun in Babylon.
9-1-1, oh it's just beginning,
and there's no rising so, so they're gonna make one.

Did you ever notice?
when I go and grow this
that they want to hold us in their cells,
Shackled away for no reason I said,
except to serve those who do well.
Your life passed around, and your whole future's in doubt...
And now you're on their probation.
Never meant to prevail, you're only meant to fail-
Just for blazing in their nation.

It's 9-1-1, when it's just begun
And there's a setting sun in Babylon.
9-1-1, when it's just beginning,
and there's no rising sun so, so they're gonna make one.

Peace I am crying for, your old system's not working no more...
Oh peace I am crying for, your old system's not working no more...

9-1-1, the gunshot from the gangsta,
9-1-1, the camera shot from the media,
9-1-1, the governments send their soldiers -
to fight to take the life of another.
9-1-1, and you can see it in creation,
9-1-1, on peoples facial expressions,
9-1-1, industrial stream pollution -
When chemical cause physical deformation.

9-1-1, when it's just begun
And there's a setting sun in Babylon.
9-1-1, when it's just beginning,
and there's no rising sun so, so they're gonna make one.
