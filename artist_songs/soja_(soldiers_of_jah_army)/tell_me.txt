From the very first time I saw you
I felt my whole life and it was all new
I felt my knees get weak, my heart went crazy
I felt some yes and no's I even felt some maybes
I'd climb a mountain top, I'd swim an ocean too
Get down on my knees only if it was for you
I think that I would about anything
You're in my dreams and in the song I sing

Come on tell me, tell me tell me, anything
And I will believe you
Tell me, tell me, tell me not to go
And I will never leave you
Tell me, tell me, tell me I'm yours
Tell me that you're the same
Oh tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, anything

I've seen so many girls, I've heard so many lines
And once or twice I thought that one of them was mine
Well how it always goes and how it's always been
I start to think that we'd be better off we were friends
But there's a new turn yeah there's a new twist
I know I said before that I just couldn't handle this
I'm not the type to write you love songs
Oh it would help if somebody sang along

And said tell me, tell me tell me, anything
I will believe you
Tell me, tell me, tell me not to go
I will never leave you
Tell me, tell me, tell me I'm yours
Tell me that you're the same
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, anything

From the very first time I saw you
It was something different and it was all new
It's in the way you move and how you look at me
Like being stuck on you is something I'm supposed to be
And that's okay too and if you feel the same
Then we can trade looks and maybe we can trade names
And we can look back down that damn road
And this ain't how the right song goes

It goes tell me, tell me tell me, anything
I will believe you
Tell me, tell me, tell me not to go
I will never leave you
Tell me, tell me, tell me I'm yours
Tell me that you're the same
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, anything
