Be aware, and your mind must be clear
under any circumstance Jah message you have to hear.
No matter where you go, Jah is always there,
So in the face of evil InI have no fear.

Well city life is the shitty life for me
too much confusion up in Falsen'dun, D.C.
People rushing with no place to go,
No direction - InI have to cool and take it slow.
Even when I am driving in my car,
Or you don't get a chance to leave the city very far.
Keep focused on truth with meditation and prayer,
Jah will show you you can go anywhere...

So be aware, and your mind must be clear
under any circumstance Jah message you have to hear.
No matter where you go, Jah is always there,
So in the face of evil InI have no fear.

Walking through the woods with your backpack full of gear
is fine, but realize that you've got to be aware.
I know it's hard, and I'm glad to be there,
but i will see so much more if my mind stays clear.
Jah is speaking just listen to the birds,
cuz the plants and the animals are all messengers.
So seek, and you will find relation
cuz Jah earth and all in it, we are one creation.

So be aware, and your mind must be clear
under any circumstance Jah message you have to hear.
No matter where you go, Jah is always there,
So in the face of evil InI have no fear.

Check it...
There were men who used to live that way,
they didn't need guns or knives to survive in those days...
Till Babylon came with their false reality -
The earth used to provide more than we could ever need.
Now it seems like we're going the wrong way, 
"Forward ever, backwards never" as the wise man say.
Let us go back to the way they used to live,
So the earth can be around for our children's kids

To be aware, and your mind must be clear
under any circumstance Jah message you have to hear.
No matter where go Jah is always there,
So in the face of evil InI have no fear.
