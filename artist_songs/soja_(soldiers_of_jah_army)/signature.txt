We deserve more than lies and illusions
way more than what we're getting
We don't remember what life is for
We believe in the wrong complications
your ties all stop at nations
When we could be so much more, so much more

Let it out and if it's true, it will flow out of you
It's like a river in your mind
Because the truth will never fall
it's been around before us all
and it's like a signature on your mind

We're the first, we're the generation
We are the ones to be one, this nation starts with us
it doesn't end when the water does
And we can see it when we think more clearly
and keep calm and you keep listening
or we could find ourselves past the point of no return

Let it out and if it's true, it will flow out of you
It's like a river in your mind
Because the truth will never fall
it's been around before us all
and it's like a signature on your mind

So get going with the new thought process:
remember birth and give away the numbness
Mankind was built on conquest
NOW'S the time that you give away the unrest
Unless we can undress all of the past concepts
and practice a little oneness
our future generations are just suspect
subject to our bullshit

Let it out and if it's true, it will flow out of you
It's like a river in your mind
Because the truth will never fall
it's been around before us all
and it's like a signature on your mind

Let it out and if it's true, it will flow out of you
It's like a river in your mind
Because the truth will never fall
it's been around before us all
and it's like a signature on your mind
on your mind
