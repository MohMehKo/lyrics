They say way back when knew how but there's nothing telling you now
Just to do your right and not your wrong
When wrong is easy and right is hard

And we've all got our weaknesses and only you know what yours is
But your tomorrows are all that seems to escape from your lips

But I don't wanna wait today
For something that might never ever show it's face again
I promise that I've heard too much
I'm ready, tell me
It seems ridiculous to trust
And none of your games you'll play
There's one life, one world, one chance
And I don't wanna wait

I don't wanna wait

Moving forward to right now a government that let you down
A racist leader no one trusts
That a army that's been good to us
And a poverty on a global scale
A fragile world with fragile layer and a fragile water
I'm sure they'll put off to tomorrow

But I don't wanna wait today
For something that might never ever show it's face again
I promise that I've heard too much
I'm ready, tell me
It seems ridiculous to trust
And none of your games you play
There's one life, one world, once chance
And I don't wanna wait

I don't wanna wait
I don't wanna wait for you and your games now
I just can't wait, I just can't

I'm skipping forward to the ending to that one or two impending to that moment
Then all that stops and one day when that bottom drops
And we remember how our voices had a chance
Yea we had our choice but time is a luxury we as the people, we might not no longer afford

So I don't wanna wait today
For something that might never ever show it's face again
I promise that I've heard too much
I'm ready, tell me
It seems ridiculous to trust
And none of your games you play
There's one life, one world once chance
And I don't wanna wait

There's not enough time, so I don't wanna wait
You know I've got a lot on my mind, so I can't wait
I could reach the end of the line, so I don't wanna wait
Oh I'm not fine

Don't wanna wait
It's not for me
I don't wanna wait...
