I'm just now waking up
To what life is facing us
And to what we've all become
And I'm just now waking oh
I hear them call your name
It's not, it's not the same
And I'm just waking, oh, yeah

I'm just now waking up
To what life is facing us
And to what we've all become
I'm just now
Some people call your name,
But it's not the same...
I'm just now waking up

We think we know good,
We think we know the bad
We think we know just what
This world is spinning for
We think we move up,
While we're stepping back
Increasing what this world,
It just can't take no more
And I've got myself to blame my acid rain is my tears
My church is blue and green,
From space, I mean, it's clear...

And i'm just now waking up
To what life is facing us
And to what we've all become
I'm just now
Some people call your name,
It's not the same...
I'm just now waking up

We're supposed to watch over this world,
Cuz were the ones all the tools and all the scars
But all we do is increase the load,
Cuz were the ones with all the guns and all the cars

We've got our shoes to fill, and we want until we drop
This race can't be endured if we don't know where to stop

And i'm just now waking up
To what life is facing us
To what we've all become
I'm just now
Some people call your name,
It's not the same...
I'm just now waking up

We're visiting here,
We're just passing here,
Can't settle down
We're like the wind here,
Yeah we blow in here
And we blow out

I've got myself to blame,
And I won't be here for too long
But I'll leave my footprints here
Before we're all gone

And I'm just now waking up
To what life is facing us
To what we've all become
I'm just now, I'm just
Some people call your name,
It's not the same...
I'm just now waking up

Some people call your name,
It's not the same...
And I'm just now waking up

Some people call your name,
It's not the same...
And I'm just now waking up
I'm just now waking up
People call your name,
Not the same...
I'm just now waking up
Some people call your name,
It's not the same...
I'm just now waking up
