I don't, know one, thing about, you not,
Knowing, a thing about me
Cause' we dropped down into all your thunderstorms
And claim it's not your lightning.

And now the fire's gone in my eyes
Grows cold for a while
And I don't feel your hate
The words have been said over and around it
But I don't hear no talkin' (your talkin')

So I'll be stoppin' and I'll be startin'
I'll be wondering why we don't know what we do
And I'm a be the same even if I'm walkin' by myself
I'm just wonderin' why. Yeah

I never ever saw us clearly,
And clearly we're both to blame
But silence and progress-my thing
Your thing was callin' my name.

Now you can see your whole life without me
Quietly in mine felt you
The distances of continents...
Phone calls upsetting now...
Something's that I guess I, I can't do

I'll be stoppin' and I'll be startin'
I'll be wondering why we don't know what we do
And I'm a be the same even if I'm walkin' by myself
I'm just wonderin' why. Yeah

My name remains prisoner,
Trapped and my world is gone
And I'm the only one who still lives here
And I've got all the light storms

So you can stop and visit me in my cell,
And we can talk if we've got the time
And you can start to go on your way
Cause' I believe I found, I found mine

So I'll be stoppin' and I'll be startin'
I'll be wondering why we don't know what we do
I'm a be the same even if I'm walkin' by myself
I'm just wonderin' why we don't know

And I'll be stoppin' and I'll be startin'
I'll be wondering why we don't know what we do
I'll be the same, even if I'm walkin' all alone
I'll be wonderin' why. Yeah
