It's funny; how I live,
and I go on without you - 
Like I've taken all my vows
without saying "I do"
And I've got no patience,
well I can barely wait at all
I topple Jericho -
you leave up your walls.

But I've got time
Oh, of anything
Oh, of anything, I've got my time...

It's funny now to see
what goes on when we
ain't around each other baby.
Now tell me who is bearing the blame
for all your cost and all your pain...
Tell me who is leaving you lonely
when you're waiting in vain.

But I've got time
Oh, of anything
Oh, of anything, I've got my time...

But, I wonder will you mention me...
I sit and wonder will you mention me...
Sometimes I wonder will you mention...

Suffering when you're not near me,
And I can barely move on.
I take all my blessings one by one.
Times moving slowly
ever since the day that you left
and I left you lonely,
I won't forget...
But I've got time
But, I wonder will you mention me...
I sit and wonder will you mention me...
mention me...
