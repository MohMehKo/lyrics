Even asleep, mentality's awake..
Nobody realizes how much we can take..
Let's save the future of the world for our sake..
Crawl forwards ever, backwards never...
We were the students but now we're the ones who teach..
We were the children and your lies we did believe...
But we ain't kids no more and we don't need a speech..
Go forwards ever, backwards never.
And truth and right is yours to control now, there's no way no how.
We will never do what they have done, under Jah's sun.
Truth and right is yours to control now, there's no way no how.
We will never do what they have..we will never do what they have done.
You're right and we're forever wrong,
Iraq and Afghanistan and Vietnam..
Bp oil and your hydrogen bomb, you go forwards never, backwards ever...
The planes in the air, look down, animals scarce..
Oil is water now and water's everywhere.
We cry fuckk your system cause I'm not with em.
Truth and right is yours to control now, there's no way no how...
We will never do what they have done, under jah's sun.
Truth and right is yours to control now, there's no way no how..
We will never do what they have...we will never do what they have done.
Truth and right is yours to control now, there's no way no how..
We will never do what they have done, under jah's sun.
Truth and right is yours to control now, there's no way no how..
We will never do what they have done. oh no no.
Truth and right is yours and...
Truth and right is yours and...
Truth and right is yours and...
Truth and right is yours and...
Truth and right is yours to control now, there's no way no how...
We will never do what they have...
We will never do what they have...
We will never do what they have done.
