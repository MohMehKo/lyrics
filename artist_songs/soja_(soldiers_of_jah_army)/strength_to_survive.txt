I'm amazed in the way that we've got this far
At the pace we're going and the things we've done
Amazed in the way that we're all still here
Just looking at our last fifty years

And I'll task, in the west in the years to come
Does the dollar really matter when our whole world is gone?
Worry about yourself, while the world stills turns
Waiting until we watch it burn

Stuck in a revolving door
Caught in our race for sure
Just look into your eyes
Now do we have the strength to survive

Stuck in a revolving door
Caught in our race for sure
Just look into your eyes
Now do we have the strength to survive if I live here

It's not like cigarettes, not like your tv's,
Bigger and brighter than any other thing,
Just consum less, and giving back more
And live our old ways at the door
And I'll wait, if we don't
We can kiss it goodbye
Our sun, our moon, our earth and our sky
Our world we will recover in a billion years
But if we're not living here

When we are..
Stuck in a revolving door
Caught in our race for sure
Just look into your eyes
Now do we have the strength to survive

When we are..
Stuck in a revolving door
Caught in our race for sure
Just look into your eyes
Now do we have the strength to survive

C'mon do we have strength to survive [x2]

C'mon do we have strength to the [x2]

Do we have strength to survive

When we are..

Stuck in a revolving door
Caught in our pace for sure
Just look into your eyes
Do we have the strength to survive
