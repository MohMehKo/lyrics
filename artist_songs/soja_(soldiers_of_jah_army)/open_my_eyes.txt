I open my eyes, each morning I rise
to find the truth I know that is there.
I'm lucky to breathe, I'm lucky to feel,
I'm glad to wake up, I'm glad to be here.
With all of this world, and all of it's pain,
all of it's lies, and all of its let downs...
I still feel a sense of freedom -
So glad I'm around.

It's my freedom, can't take it from me
I know it won't change
But, we need some understanding,
I know we'll be alright...

Alright.

The day I am gone, and the day that I leave
I'll never regret one minute of life.
I've learned from the joy, I've learned from the tears...
I've walked through the dark, now I seen a light.
Every tongue of everyone
of every state in every land,
has every thing to be thankful for...

It's my freedom

Cuz I, I wait on you
Cuz you wait on me - so I wait on you

I open my eyes, each morning I rise
to find the truth I know that is there.
I can't tell you how, you can't tell me why -
But living my life is all that I care.
The burden can be, sometimes, bigger than me,
Sometimes, stronger than me, and hard to bear.
But I couldn't care less, no stress cuz
Jah put me here.

It's my freedom

I know you know -
I wait on you
Cuz you wait on me - so I wait on you
We've really gotta stop...
