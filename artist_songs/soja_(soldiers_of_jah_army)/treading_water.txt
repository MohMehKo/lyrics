I've been waiting on your conscience to call 
And maybe hear your little voice on the phone 
And now I'm treading water
It's getting hotter
The ocean is much bigger than me
And now I need it more than ever before
I'm just knocking in my head on your door
And you know I still feel it
And I still need it
This bottle's full now

Sitting here waiting on you... Goddammit!
Packing up, my hotel room... I planned it
Different in my head when I thought of love
I'm looking at the shimmering stars above
And everyone reminds me of you... And
Everything that we've been through... Damn!
Everything is coming back to me tonight

I've been running in circles for days 
And you know me... It's never ever going away
But then you keep me waiting
I won't change it for any other girl in the World
And I could but every time I think it's the end
You show up fucking everything in my head
Then I'm treading water
Falling faster
This bottle's empty

Sitting here waiting on you... Goddammit!
Packing up, my hotel room... I planned it
Different in my head when I thought of love
I'm looking at the shimmering stars above
And everyone reminds me of you... And
Everything that we've been through... Damn!
Everything is coming back to me tonight
