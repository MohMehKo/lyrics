Why turn on my TV
When it's only tragedy
Why turn on my radio
When the headlines hurt you know
It's getting old
It's getting o-o-o-o-old
It's getting old
It's getting o-o-o-o-old
The bad news
The bad news
The bad news

I'm guessing tolerance has got the better chance of
Removing much of the damage before it shows up
We elect our future to be the bad luck
Bad news gets given we throw our hands up
And this country is two pieces and it's evident
The lowest common denominator is president
There's only half of us that feel this way too
But every one of us headed for the bad news

Why turn on my TV
When it's only tragedy
Why turn on my radio
When the headlines hurt you know
It's getting old
It's getting o-o-o-o-old
It's getting old
It's getting o-o-o-o-old
The bad news
The bad news

People say where are you from and I tell em D.C.
But I could say European, it's just as easy
But I could say Mother Earth cause if you break it down
We were the ones who put every border on the ground
We made religion for good but now it separates
We made words so everybody communicates
But now the language is hatred and it is blame too
We are all immigrants, sorry for the bad news

It's always an issue and it's always a problem
We need solutions, we need to solve it
It's always an issue and it's always a problem
We need solutions, we need to solve it

Why turn on my TV
When it's only tragedy
Why turn on my radio
When the headlines hurt you know
It's getting old
It's getting o-o-o-o-old
It's getting old
It's getting o-o-o-o-old
The bad news
People say where are you from and we tell em D.C.
The bad news
But I could say Mother Earth, it's just as easy
The bad news
We are all immigrants, sorry for
The bad news
Bad news
