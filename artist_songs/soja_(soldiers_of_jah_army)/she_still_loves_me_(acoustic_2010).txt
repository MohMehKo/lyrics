I know it's hard now for you to see
You can't change how it was
Or how it's gonna be
I'm what she wants
You're just what she needs
And if she still loves me
She still loves me

Where is her sweater?
It's not in her car
It's not at her friend's house
It's not at the bar
I think you better,
Think with the heart
Take a look at yourself
And see how lucky you really are.

I don't believe in luck after all
Neither does she, but you know that now
You should forget her
Cause I've got her heart
She hates the way that I tear it apart

I know it's hard now for you to see
You can't change how it was
Or how it's gonna be
I'm what she wants
You're just what she needs
And if she still loves me
She still loves me

What did she do today?
What took her so long?
Where has she been to?
Where has she gone?

What does she think about?
She sees the dawn
When you feel her thinking
And rolling around

What does she talk about,
When her father calls?
She says what you said
She tells her old man that you're the one

What does she talk about,
When her mother calls?
You don't come up
You don't come up at all

What do we do when life takes us so long?
Why we waste so much time, I know ill never know
Why do we stay here? Why don't we go?
Why does everybody think that they can do both?

I know it's hard now for you to see
You can't change how it was
Or how it's gonna be
I'm what she wants
You're just what she needs
And if she still loves me
She still loves me

I know it's hard now for you to see
Cause you can't change a thing about how it's going to be
And I'm what she wants
And you're just what she needs
But she still loves me
She still loves me
She still loves me
