I act like I left her, but I really beg her to stay.
And the more that I press her is the more she slips away.
Act like I don't need her but...Yo, you're necessary...
Like ten days from now I won't see your face when I sleep.

Act like I can hear, but Jah knows I'm deaf.
Act like I can see but now, yo, from me sight has left.
Act like I don't know but, I know these things...
Act like I don't feel it but I'm gonna feel it, every morning now on

Each morning, on each night
when I need you by my side
on each morning and on each night
when I need you

Like I don't care but each and every time
your face comes across it never ever leaves my mind.
Oh, like I don't know but...I know your thing
like I don't feel it, but I'm gonna feel it every evening now on -

Each morning, on each night
when I need you by my side
on each morning and on each night
when I need you

I act like I left her, but the truth is I beg her, beg her to stay...
And the more that I press her, means all the more that she slips away.
Act like I don't need her, but I'm here to tell you that you're necessary.
Like ten days from now I won't see your face when I'm on -

Each morning, on each night
when I need you by my side
on each morning and on each night
when I need you by my side.

- On each morning and on each night when I need you so desperately
