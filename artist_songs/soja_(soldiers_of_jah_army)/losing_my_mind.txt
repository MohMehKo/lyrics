There's no pictures on the wall
There's no rise and there's no fall
And in the morning I'm a ride alone without you
There's no phone and there's no cars
There's no talking to you at all
And I don't care late at night when it's not you

But when I look out in the rain
I think about the past, I want it again
I think about the way you feel inside
I start losing my mind, I start losing my mind, my mind, my mind

There's no phone in native lands
There's no wave and there's no chance
It's been to long and it's full all back behind me
There's no going down that road
And I know right where to go
If I keep walking, away nothing reminds me

But when I look out in the rain
I think about the past, I want it again
I think about the way you feel inside
And I'm losing my mind, and I'm losing my mind, my mind, my mind

[Instrumental]

There's no fights and there's no tears
There's no need if your not here
But I'm not the same anyyyyway anyyymore
There's no need to write this song
Cause there's no change in what's been done
But there's no change in what's inside
Like it's gonna start

I look out in the rain
I think about the past, I want it again
I think about the way you feel inside
I'm losing my mind, I'm losing my, losing my, losing all the way

I look out in the rain
I think about the past, I want it again
I think about the way you feel inside
I'm losing my mind, I'm losing my mindd
