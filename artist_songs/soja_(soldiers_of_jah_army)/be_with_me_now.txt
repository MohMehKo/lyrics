In two months, I'm through the door way
Put my guitar on the floor
And you will sit and tell me
That you can't take anymore
And you will sit and wonder
What I can only speculate
That time is gonna be telling us
What we don't want it to say

So just be with me now
Feel your hair wrap around my finger
Feel your words turn into whispers
Feel you fall asleep and dream
Dream that you could be with me now 
As I keep track on my finger
Of the cities and the strangers
Of the pieces of my dreams

It's been so long since I've seen you
Almost forgot your face
And time meant to brings people closer
But it does the opposite for me
So I forgot my hallways and my hotels
And a ticket with my name 
It's been too long since I've seen you, you
And there's so much to say

But just be with me now
Feel your hair wrap around my finger
Feel your words turn into whispers
Feel you fall asleep and dream
Dream that you could be with me now 
As I keep track on my finger
Of the cities and the strangers
Of the pieces of my dream

That you can be with me now
Feel your words turn into whispers
Your hair wrap around my fingers
You fall asleep and dream
Dream that you could be with me now 
As I keep track on my fingers
The cities and the strangers
Of the pieces of my dreams
