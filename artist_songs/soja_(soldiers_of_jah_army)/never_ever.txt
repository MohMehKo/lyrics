Shes looking like she might have felt all this before
Yeah like she seen all of these signs Yeah
I'll understand if she can't do this anymore
She'll understand if I stay blind

You know because I never ever wanna look around
Out of my sight and I'll be out of town

She asked me "look, could this all be so simple?", simplicity's in your mind
I'll understand if she just walks right out my door
Keep my love from inside

You know because I never ever want to slow down
I've got no loss and shes got no hope

Sometimes I wonder what is all this running for
She knows the thoughts crossed my mind
But then I put my feet right back down on earth
And this world spins one more time, one more time

Because I never ever wanna look around
Out of my sight and I'll be out of town now
You know because I never ever want to slow down
I've got no loss and shes got no hope
