I’m not saying that I’ve got it all figured out,
I’m just saying that most people
Seem to be without a doubt
So scared to death of what they just don’t understand 
You know they been doing that one since the dawning of man 
If you need the union of marriage that the bible portrays,
It’s after the part permitting human enslavement.
People always need other people to hate,
It’s the evil that the human mind creates

But we can’t go on pretending that we’re strong
Pretending that we’re better than everyone
And don’t blame God for your own hatred
That you direct unto his children, that’s you alone

One love, one love 
That’s what you’re telling me
Except for “them,” never “them,”
They’re not your “family.”
That’s the same old story,
The same old ideology:
1492. 1861. 2014.

And then you blame it on the bible
And the pages written by who knows who
Then loosely got translated to 50 languages,
Now everyone’s “tradition” is hatred, loosely translated

We can’t go on pretending that we’re strong
Pretending that we’re better then everyone
Don’t blame god for your own hatred
That you direct unto his children, that’s you alone
We can’t go on pretending that we’re strong
Pretending that we’re better then everyone
Don’t blame god for your own hatred
That you keep right in your heart there
And you love it, and what would you do without it?
Pick up your hatred and find it in the pages
And then translate it to look just like you made it
And change the faces to look like your faces
And you can change the names
To fit into your translation of “one.”
