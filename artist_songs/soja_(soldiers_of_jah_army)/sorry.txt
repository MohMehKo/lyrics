Baby I'm sorry
For whatever it was I always did;
The way it went down and it always is;
The way that I am makes it all my fault?

You know if I could change who I am right now
I wouldn't do it no, no...
And if I could make all my past be gone
I wouldn't change a thing, no.
Cuz when we first met all you wanted was me...yeah, but -
Now all you want is your apology from me...
for being who I said I'd be, baby

I'm sorry
For whatever it was I always did;
The way it went down and it always is;
The way that I am makes it all my fault.

When two people start to fall in love
you fall up then you fall right down.
Cuz it never seems to be what it was
when we're clutching straws and drowning in love.
I don't feel bad about admitting the truth,
Cuz honesty's my policy with you.
You say that I'm lying, I say you want me to...
but I love you...

Well, I'm sorry
For whatever it was I always did;
The way it went down and it always is;
The way that I am makes it all my fault.

I'm gonna be me it's my fault
I'd feel a lot better if you said it's my fault

Sorry-
For whatever it was and all
the way that it went down and all
the way I am it's all
my fault, my fault I'm sorry.

I take it all back now
