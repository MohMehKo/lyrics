The situation isn't what it was
and its never gonna be it again
cuz we got nothing prepared for what is coming up
when the dollar is the focus of men, and you know
all the solutions we don't talk about
cause wed rather talk about ourselves right now
and if WE are whats killing US
we take the form of the storm up ahead, now follow me
I've seen the water rising,
its rising all around
and I've seen those roots, they're ripping
and they rip out from the ground
and I've seen this world is changing
and it's right in front of our face
there's something happening here,
in this little human race
it's coming coming coming on down,
down the waters literally rise now
it's coming and it's coming on down, down
and the (heat) index rise every time around
it's coming, it's coming on down, down
and we can tear every little thing down
and we will, just look around
and you can watch us tear it down

the situations coming down to this:
what matters to us all in the end? And you know
total destruction is on the horizon, if you are
standing on the out looking in.
and our congress and president never ever mention it,
can't even figure out same sex marriages
while we kill each other every day,
and while we kill our earth in every way,
it's coming down.
We've got this love inside us,
and we've got this hatred too
We've got this battle raging,
and we've let the soldiers loose
We sit and watch and wonder
possible outcomes
will what we NEED deep inside
become what we WANT before...

it's coming coming coming on down, down
the waters literally rise now
it's coming and its coming on down, down
and the (heat) index rise every time around
it's coming, it's coming on down, down
and we can tear every little thing down
and we will, just look around
and you can watch us tear it down
down, down now
tear it right down to the ground
we gonna tear it down, down, down now
tear it right down to the ground
