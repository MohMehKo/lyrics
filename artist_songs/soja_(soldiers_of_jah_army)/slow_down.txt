You can search the world for signs of life
And realize the truth is in your heart, is in your heart
You can try to become who you want
And never get away from who you are, is who you are
You can trust another like no other
Watch them fall and then you fall apart, it there's you apart
Always seen myself alone
But in my darkest hours is there you are, it's where's my guitar

[Chorus:]
So I can say
Oh now, oh now, oh now, now now now now
Oh now, oh now, oh now, now now now
Oh now you gotta slow down
Oh now all I have is now
Oh now, oh now, oh now

I've been all around the world to find it
Travel east and west like everyday, everyday
I've been high and low since I have lost it
How do I get back to yesterday, it feels like a game
I have seen the look in people's eyes sometimes
All I do is chase them away, chase them away
Cause I have been all around the world
To find it every time I do I don't let it stay, I chase it away 

[Chorus:]
So now I say
Oh now, oh now, oh now, now now now now
Oh now, oh now, oh now, now now now
Oh now you gotta slow down
Oh now all I have is now
Oh now, oh now, oh now
