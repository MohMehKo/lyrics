It occurred to me as things are slowing down
that it's always much better when you're around
and it's slowly turning me upside down (upside down [x2])

You can be who you want to
You can see who you want to
And there's nothing I can tell you now except
I'm always thinking of you
Even if I don't want to
In more ways than I can count

Cuz I didn't meant to let you go
Should've been the first one to let you know
Change your mind 
And let me slide just one more time
It doesn't have to be this way
We could stop fighting and wake up in your place, or
I could go
Leave it to chance and just let this go on...

And when we're in the future
And now is a million miles away
Will we start to reconsider what now belongs to yesterday
This whole life is moving fast for me, is it for you the same?
And do you dream and when you do, do you wake up saying my name?

You can be who you want to
And you can see who you want to
And there's nothing I can tell you now except
That I'm always thinking of you
And even when I don't want to
In more ways than I can count

Cuz I didn't meant to let you go
Should've been the first one to let you know
Change your mind 
And let me slide just one more time
It doesn't have to be this way
We could stop fighting and wake up in your place, or
I could go
Leave it to chance and just let it go, let it go

Cause we were only children still deciding who to be
I remember following you, hoping you'd look back at me
But then a band became my life
And you heard California's nice
And then we go older like people do
But I didn't mean to let you go
