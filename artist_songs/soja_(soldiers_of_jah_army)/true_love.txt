[Verse 1:]
Just like the land that bear the name Africa,
Love is on my mind.
It's for everyone no matter where you're from,
Love, it cross all lines.
Like the feeling of all the seasons changing,
Love is a memory
And in these last days, when iniquity blazing,
Truth Love Speaks.

[Chorus:]
I need true love
Do you know what you mean to me
Does it show as I live and I breath
In the valley of the shadow, I know you'll be.
I defense, I conquer death
I conquer the enemy (envy).

[Verse 2:]
What is love really if it only affects, one aspect of life?
That's like a musician who only accepts, his own musical type.
That's like a preacher who only respects sunday morning, and not saturday night
That's how a soldier can come to reflect,
That Love is more than a man and a wife.

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
In a time of plenty, Jah gonna keep me strong.
Things get hard and I keep cool, yeah,
Jah gonna keep me strong.
When InI cup is empty,
Jah gonna keep I strong.
When InI cup is full, yeah,
Jah keep I from their temptation
