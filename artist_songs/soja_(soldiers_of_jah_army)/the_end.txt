[Intro:]
This one is livicated to all those who thought they would never need a friend.
Until their standing right there, alone, by themselves at the end.

[Chorus:]
You thought you'd never need a friend.
Until you were standing alone at the end

[Verse 1:]
We are some soldiers from Arlington,
VA soldiers who would put word, sound, and power, including fire, upon a weak heart everyday.
This one who said he was a friend, tried to put I in the pen,
his lying never ends and believe me he must pay.
He just deal with the feds, put a price on I head,
Lead them to us, bring us to them, believe me, you must pay.

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
I won't commit that crime, if I can't do that time,
Nah put my bredren on the line.
We have a name for you, those who are so untrue, informer I'm talking to.
Jah know you working in satans way for selling your brother you going to collect your pay
My own bredren have just gone down.
Never stole or murdered, so explain to me how time and time again,
well the wicked just go free, temporarily, it's only temporary
