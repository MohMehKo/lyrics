In this time we don't need war,
In this time what you fight for?
In this time, need more love
In this time...but they wanna war
In this time - Jah people don't be so blind -
What would Jah do now?
What would He do now when...

We live in a world of pain and corruption
Where what we want is what we take
I don't want no part I...
I'm gone on my way
In this time.

In this time we don't need fighting
This time, people got to be uniting
This time we should harmonize
This time but they wanna fight
In this time, oh Jah people don't be oh so blind
Tell me what Jah do now - What would Jah do now?

In this time we need peace
In this time for all war cease
In this time but there's no ease
In this time cuz there's no peace
In this time Jah people don't be so blind
What would Jah do now?

No more war
