[Verse 1:]
You know I never said goodbye to you,
I just shut up and walked away
You know I'm running from what's hard to do and
I'm letting you know that nothing's changed.
I think I'll never change the road I'm on
All I'm changing up is the town that I'm in sometimes
I'm not into who I've become, and
That "sometime" is now

[Chorus:]
Wait, Wait
Don't let it go like it's gone before and please stay... stay
Don't make me show up at your door

[Verse 2:]
I'm feeling I'm drowning and loving every minute in it
Like I'm tripping every second that I'm in the minute
Baby, we're stupid we kill each other for love, love
running in circles, we can never get enough us
You hear me calling and you start to turn around
You see me running and you start to slow down
Baby, slow down, turn around
and wait for me to walk away again, now

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 1]

[Chorus x2]
