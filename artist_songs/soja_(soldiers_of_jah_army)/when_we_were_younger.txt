I never really got why we're here
Just look at all we build in our lives and we all disappear
A few of us are born with so much
While most of us just chasing down a dream that we just can't touch
So why we try so hard in this place?
When pain and suffering is a guarantee and happiness is a phase
I wonder if one day we're at peace
Or will this whole world just become like the middle east?

[Chorus:]
But when I was younger, when I was younger
I had the answers, I've got to say
But all of my answers, now that I'm older
Turned into questions, in front of me

I wonder where we go when we die
If there is anything past our lost sun and our sky?
Cuz airports only take us so high
Is it hidden in the stars?
What's the answer to your soul lying?
I wonder do we get to come back
I wonder if I will remember these questions I've asked
Or will I just star over again?
I hope it's not too hard to find all of my old friends.

[Chorus x2:]
But when we were younger, when we were younger
I had the answers, I've got to say
But all of my answers, now that we're older
Turned into questions, in front of me

I wonder if we get one true love
Or maybe there's a few out there
Or maybe not even one
I wonder if it's made up by man
I wonder if love is what we make with our own two hands
I wonder why I write all these songs
I wonder if you know what you're saying when you sing along
And will you know my name when I'm gone?
Or are you just too sick of these love songs?

[Chorus:]
But when we were younger, when we were younger
I had the answers, I've got to say
But all of my answers, now that I'm older
Turned into questions, in front of me

But when we were younger, when we were younger
I had the answers, I've got to say
But all of my answers, now that I'm older
Just turned into questions, right in front of me
Right in front of me, in front of me
Everything changes in front of me
