Help me to see Your way and Your light.
help turn night to day, help I.
Because when I'm down on my knees, I'm high.
And I been trying to find some peace, I try...
But i see innocence so far away.
And I see, we need so much work, but we play.
And You still let us live, and love us.
You put nothing on earth above us.

Those devils they pass against me, what can I say?
Always known where to find me-
Cuz since the very first, I mean of my days,
Keep their lights on to blind me.

Oh it's bittersweet, follow me, how we're born
100 years pass by- your plan, Jah- we're gone.
We're tired while we're here, so we sleep.
We always take much more than we need.
We think more than we say, than we know, and...
Say more than we feel, than we show...
And You still let us live, and love us.
You put nothing on earth above us.

Devils they pass against me, what can I say?
Always known where to find me -
Cuz since the very first, I mean of my days,
Keep their lights on to blind me.

Oh it feels so cold, sometimes.
Like when i start feeling old in my life...
but right then I remember why I'm here, why I'm free.
And it all comes rushing back to me, cuz I breathe.
One day my speech will stop, A-Z.
And all my secrets unlock, and You'll see
my ten thousand transgressions and all
that I've ever done -
I'll be right here, waiting on You
until that day I'm gone...

Till I'm gone, gone...
Till I'm gone, gone...
Till I'm gone, gone...
I'll be gone.
Till I'm gone, gone...
Till I'm gone, gone...
Till I'm gone, gone...
I'll be gone.
I'll be waiting down here...alone.

The devils they pass against me so what can I say say?
They always know where to find...me...
