For so long InI feel
As if I'm not a part of this world.
For all of it's representatives
Are so secretive.
So far, there's very little love,
And an abundance of hatred.
Now is this the legacy
I leave for my children?
When they think that it's
Peace and safety,
That's when you know
It's a sudden destruction.
Living in Rome there is no security
One God, One Aim, (move forward)
One Destiny.

[Chorus:]
Revolution Cry
No, Jah will never forsake I

Freedom isn't freedom if you force it
And peace achieved through war
Is no peace. Equality don't mean nothing
If you fake it, and we already know
More than they believe.

How many of us feel superior
To others in some part of our lives
See, man has always strived
To be the better, and from his brothers
His true feelings hide.
