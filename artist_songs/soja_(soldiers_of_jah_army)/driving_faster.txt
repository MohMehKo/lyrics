I can't believe
I'm going down this road
I came a week ago
But now I'm driving faster
I should've seen how this was gonna go
I'm gonna be alone
And now I'm heading for disaster

I can't believe
I'm going down this road
I came a week ago
But now I'm driving faster
I should've seen how this was gonna go
I'm gonna be alone
And now I'm heading for disaster

It seems like I never learn
I have to jump in the fire
Twenty times before I realize
That I'm gonna get burn
The more you live
The more you learn
The more you give
The more you earn

They say if I keep on giving the best of me
Neglect the rest of me
I got to project my true self
It seems like this is a test for me
Forward progress for me
And I can't do this with your help

I can't believe
I'm going down this road
I came a week ago
But now I'm driving faster
I should've seen how this was gonna go
I'm gonna be alone
And now I'm heading for disaster

I can't believe
I'm going down this road
I came a week ago
But now I'm driving faster
I should've seen how this was gonna go
I'm gonna be back home
Now I'm not heading for disaster

I can't be heading for this
Cause I'm not ready for this
I got to keep up with this
As those whose steady for this
Just keep my head off this
Cause I'll be better for this
And in the end I know we'll be alright and all will be blessed
Trust me a little basics
Sometimes it's hard to exist
But this races is for those who endure and not for the swift
Jut got to stay positive
And I receive what I give
Before I love someone
I focus on my own life to live
