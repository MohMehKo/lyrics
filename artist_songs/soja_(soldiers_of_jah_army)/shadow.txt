I'm not a shadow,
I'm not the ground beneath your feet
I'm not a shadow,
When you look down, you wont see me
I'll stand up and I'll stand tall, I don't follow anyone
I'm not a shadow, cause I'm not a shadow

Here's to you don't settle, and never separate
And never be quiet cause the words you say
You never go back on and never turn around,
Never judge another cause as stupid it sounds
Cause when you see others knowin' they're all brothers,
Knowin' they're all sisters, seein' the big picture,
If they're not with you, then they're against
And were here now when they are way back when
So why try to please everyone? 
When it seems that all the people really want
Is to show love, and out and get love back
Is to show some faith and get respect
Just look at the world then, you look at the problems
And look at the hatred, and we still cant solve it
So look inside and you'll find step one,
Forget a diamond I'm shinin' like the sun

Cause I'm not a shadow,
I'm not the ground beneath your feet
I'm not a shadow,
When you look down, you wont see me
I'll stand up and I'll stand tall, I don't follow anyone
I'm not a shadow, cause I'm not a shadow

Here's to you on your own, the innocent criminal
You never fit the mold, you never go sit down
You never go get approval no matter how you prove
That love is the motive in everything you do,
And revolution is you and you're against the machine,
You know who you are and you know what I mean
And when this record stops you would never slow down,
When the video is over you want your turn now so,
You make the truth and move straight ahead,
While the followers behind you get left for dead
For the imminent brainwash follow the dumb rules,
Created by individuals who unlike you
Don't care for the world or, care for the people
They love it their way, and they love unequal
And they love when they feel above someone,
I don't follow the leader when they're all wrong

Cause I'm not a shadow,
I'm not the ground beneath your feet
I'm not a shadow,
When you look down, you wont see me
I'll stand up and I'll stand tall, I don't follow anyone
I'm not a shadow, cause I'm not a shadow
