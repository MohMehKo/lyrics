I can't forget that day I got you
There's something about you, I just watched you
Like something I tried but I forgot to
It's not that I wanted to, it's just that I lost you

Thoughts of you run over in my mind and I try so hard to just press rewind to find
And it's something I held maybe one time and I
And all I do is think

But thinking about you never brought you back
So far from you in my mind I go
But my heart hurts, it brings me back before I know
So all I do is think

Cause I tried to change
And I tried to stay, tried to stay the same
And I tried to work
And I tried for her, I tried

I can't forget that day I got you
There's something about you, I just watched you
Like something I tried but I forgot to
It's not that I wanted to, it's just that I lost you

[Gentleman:]
And all I know the more that I think about it is, the deeper I doubt it
Is unsure what this emotion promises
What kind of pain and strain it is
So many times I've done that before
Told myself that I should know more
Seek and get past it, now that I lost it
There is no bridge, so how can I cross it?
Down so low in the valley of decision
Clouded mind disturbing my vision
Bleeding heart affecting my vision
Compromising on this love mission
And no matter how me try, still she can't just satisfy
Now could the truth be a lie
Water drop out of me eye cause me see the well run dry
I tried

Cause I tried to change
And I tried to stay, tried to stay the same
And I tried to work
And I tried for her, I tried
I tried

No I can't forget that day I got you
There's something about you, I just watched you (fire!)

Memories of you keep flashing through my mind
Can't keep it up and me can't resign
Destination street and me no see no sign
Got to rise above to cross borderline

I tried
Cause I tried to change
And I tried to stay, tried to stay the same
And I tried to work
And I tried for her, I tried
