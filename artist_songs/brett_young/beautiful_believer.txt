Road into town and only 18
My girl beside me and a baby in a car seat
Everybody called me crazy
That was fine as long as I knew
She believed
Not a nickel to our name
Cheap motel east side of town just south of Main
Songs I wrote for change
And one day I'd be headlining the stage

She gives me strength
When mine's all gone
She always keeps me hanging on
When I feel I've lost my way
She leads me home
She don't know how much I need her
A beautiful believer

I just got the news today
You know that song I wrote for you has made its way
Then oh so much has changed
You know the one thing that has always stayed the same

She gives me strength
When mine's all gone
She always keeps me hanging on
When I feel I've lost my way
She leads me home
She don't know how much I need her
A beautiful believer

Beautiful believer
Every time I doubt myself
Before I even ask for help
She's right there next to me
A beautiful believer
Every night I close my eyes
Just knowing that she's by my side
That's all I really need

She gives me strength
When mine's all gone
She always keeps me hanging on
When I feel I've lost my way
She leads me home
She don't know how much I need her
A beautiful believer
She don't know how much I need her
A beautiful believer
