How does it feel to know
That I can't get you off my mind
Oh I can try
But you get inside my head
And I would be just fine if I knew
What I was to you

Am I forgettable?
Is mine the name that ties your tongue
Or am I memorable?
Is there a chance I can be the one
Have I changed anything?
Is there a place you keep from me
What have I become to you?
Define me, define me

What am I supposed to do?
I'm scared of reaching out to you
To have you pull away
I'm not afraid of letting go
It would sure be nice to know
The right kind of place

Am I forgettable?
Is mine the name that ties your tongue
Or am I memorable?
Is there a chance I can be the one
Have I changed anything?
Is there a place you keep from me
What have I become to you?
Define me, define me

And I've, I've waited every patiently
And I, I've come up with a few simple things that you
Can say to reassure me that your mine
One last time

Am I forgettable?
Is mine the name that ties your tongue
Or am I memorable?
Is there a chance I can be the one
Have I changed anything?
Is there a place you keep from me
What have I become to you?
Define me, oh baby,
Am I forgettable?
Is mine the name that ties your tongue
Or am I memorable?
Is there a chance I can be the one
Have I changed anything?
Is there a place you keep from me
What have I become to you?
Define me, define me
