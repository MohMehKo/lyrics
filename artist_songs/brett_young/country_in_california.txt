I was driving down PCH
Top down on my jeep just cranking some Hank
A California boy with country on my mind.

A pretty girl sitting next to me
With beach blond hair in the passenger seat
Rocking Daisy Dukes with a bathing suit underneath.

She's West Coast head-to-toe
But there ain't a Reba song that she don't know...

There's country in California
We drink whiskey, just like they do in Tennessee
We have backroads, past where the grass grows
In the hills of Malibu, it's the sky's that blue
With a clear view of the sea
Yeah, there's country, in my California dream.

I remember way back before it was cool
Singing Tim McGraw on my way to school
MaryAnn McCoy was my "don't take the girl"

Nowadays the highway is more than a road
It's taking over Country radio
Moving the Mason-Dixie line all the way to the edge of the world

Her eyes were blue and her hair was long, yeah
She's every woman, she's a country song...

There's country in California
We drink whiskey, just like they do in Tennessee
We have backroads, past where the grass grows
In the hills of Malibu, it's the sky's that blue
With a clear view of the sea
Yeah, there's country, in my California dream.

Sweet home California
Sweet home California
Sweet home California

There's country in California
We drink whiskey, same as they do in Tennessee
We have backroads, past where the green grass grows
In the hills of Malibu, it's the sky's that blue
With a clear view of the sea
Yeah, there's country, 
Yeah, there's country
Oh, there's country
In my California dream
In my California dream

I was driving down PCH
Top down on my jeep just cranking some Hank
A California boy with country on my mind.
