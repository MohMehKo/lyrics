I don't wanna ask too much or be to bold
And I don't want to weight you down with a heavy load
I've heard you say that you can handle anything
What I really need to know

Would you wait for me
When I got to leave
Could I ever be
Everything you need
If I promise you my love
Could that promise be in love
Would you wait for me
Would you wait for me

I don't need a magic knight to make me feel
Like I'm living in a fairy tale
I know this love is real
Hear me when I sing whenever I'm away
My heart is with you all the same

Would you wait for me
When I got to leave
Could I ever be
Everything you need
If I promise you my love
Could that promise be in love
Would you wait for me
Would you wait for me

Looking back at where we've been
Being scared to let you in
You becoming my best friend
No matter where I travel to
I'm coming right back home to you
If you just wait for me

Would you wait for me
When I got to leave
Could I ever be
Everything you need
If I promise you my love
Could that promise be in love
Would you wait for me
Would you wait for me

Would you wait for me
When I got to leave
Could I ever be
Everything you need
If I promise you my love
Could that promise be in love
Would you wait for me
Would you wait for me
