Waking up beside you and I don't even know your name
I left you with my number hopin' I can see you again
You got me spinnin' baby, wonderin' if its crazy
That I can't get you out of my head
I wanna be excited but I'm afraid to hold my breath

I keep thinkin'
One drink turned into 3 or 4
Your hand in mind, staring at the dance floor. 
Too loud to speak but your lips were callin' me
& I remember the salt on your kiss was just enough
To drown out the crowd
While everybody watched us
Don't know if this is headed towards "like it" or "love it"
Makin' somethin' outta nothin' 

I could hear you leavin' pretendin' I was still asleep
It's nothin' that you did, girl, I just needed time to think
You got me spinnin' baby, wondering if it's crazy
I didn't mean to feel this way
I've lost in love before, girl, that's why I'm actin' so afraid

I keep thinkin' 
One drink turned into 3 or 4
Your hand in mind, Staring at the dance floor. 
Too loud to speak but your lips were callin' me
& I remember the salt on your kiss was just enough
To drown out the crowd
While everybody watched us
Don't know if this is headed towards "like it" or "love it"
Makin' somethin' outta nothin' 
Makin' somethin' outta nothin' 

Not sure if I should be the first to call
Not sure I could wait one day
I wonder if he thinks of me at all 
I close my eyes and see her face

And one drink turned into 3 or 4
Your hand in mind, Staring at the dance floor. 
Too loud to speak but your lips were callin' me
& I remember the salt on your kiss was just enough
To drown out the crowd
While everybody watched us
Don't know if this is headed toward "like it" or "love it"
Makin' somethin' outta nothing
Somethin' outta nothing
