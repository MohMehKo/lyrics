I can't get you close enough
I can't get you close enough
I can't get you close enough
I can't get you close enough

Mmmh
It ain't like this 15 hundred miles between us
And it ain't been but 15 minutes since I've seen ya
Your side of the love seat might as well be California
And my side feels like Carolina girl the way I want ya

Cause I can't get you close enough
I can't get you close
It's touching, going might go crazy everytime we touch
If there's an inch of air between our two hearts beating that's too much
Cause I can't get you close enough
I can't get you close enough
Oooh
Oh oh
Oooh
Oh oh

I don't just know you
I know everything about you
So I just can't begin to wrap my mind around you
You're sun and rain, fire and ice
A whole new world behind your eyes
I want to kiss you when you close em
And hold you till they open

Cause I can't get you close enough
I can't get you close
It's touching, going might go crazy everytime we touch
If there's an inch of air between our two hearts beating that's too much
Cause I can't get you close enough
I can't get you close enough
Oooh
Oh oh
Oooh
Oh oh
Come on over here

Lean on in
I need more than skin on skin

Cause I can't get you close enough
I can't get you close
It's touching, going might go crazy everytime we touch
If there's an inch of air between our two hearts beating that's too much
Cause I can't get you close enough
I can't get you close enough
Oooh
Oh oh
Ooooh
I can't get you close enough
