Different colours and different atmospheres
Time passes on throughout the years
Different people with different points of view
I think of me I think of you

If you think I don't mean it
If think that I need you
If you think that I'm joking
Why don't you just leave me be
And if you think that I'm joking
'Cos you mean nothing to me

I wander up I wander down
I find it hard you being around

If you think I don't mean it
If think that I need you
If you think that I'm joking
Why don't you just leave me be
And if you think that I'm joking
'Cos you mean nothing to me

If you think that I'm joking
Why don't you just leave me be
And if you think that I'm joking
'Cos you mean nothing to me

If you think that I'm joking
Why don't you just leave me be
And if you think that I'm joking
'Cos you mean nothing to me
Why don't you just leave me be
