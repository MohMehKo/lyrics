Picking up pieces of yesterdays fire
Word's that written
But words they were only desire
Only desire

Pictures you've painted
Of yesterday's dreams
Emotions alive, but no one
Will see their desire
Only desire

Lady, I don't want to fight
I know it's middle of the night
So come now and sit by the fire
Maybe it's only desire
Maybe it's only desire

Picking up pieces I threw on the fire
Words became letters
But letters were only desire
Only desire

Lady, I don't want to fight
I know it's middle of the night
So come now and sit by the fire
Maybe it's only desire
Maybe it's only desire

And I will make everything right
So come now and sit by the fire
Maybe it's only desire
Maybe it's only desire
