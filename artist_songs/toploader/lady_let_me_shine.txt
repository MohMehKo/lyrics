Lady I'm so crazy for you
That I don't know what to do
Lady I'm so mad today
And I don't know what to say

We're just drifting away
On the dawn of a new day

Who knows were the wind may take us
Just as long as love love don't break us
Lady let me shine for you

Walked a thousand miles to drink your water
Just to met the devil's daughter
Maybe we can make it through

Lady, I don't know where you've been
Lord only knows what you've seen

Lady, I still don't know where you are
So near, so very far

Were just drifting away
On the dawn of a new day

Who knows were the wind will take us
Just as log a love don't break us
Lady let me shine for you

Walked a thousand miles to drink your water
Just to met the devil's daughter
Maybe we can make it through

Lady, let me shine for you
Lady let me shine

We're just drifting away
On the dawn of a new day

Lady, let me shine for you
Lady let me shine

Lady let me shine for you
lady let me shine for you
