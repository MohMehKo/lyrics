I remember when I first met you
You left me black and blue
KTFO
On the floor
And when you had me flat on my back
Nearly gave me a heart attack
Out for the count
On the ropes
And when she got me seeing stars
She takes my poor head in her arms
Let me give you some good advice
I've told you once, I've told you twice

She said you gotta roll
With the punches my friend
Stay with me to the end

Roll
With the punches again
No I cannot defend
It's a knockout again

And when she really gonna hit on me
Floats like a butterfly, stings like a bee
Don't hit too low
Daddio

Go hard or go home she said
Knock you out and go back to bed
WBF
WBO
And every night it's do or die
But I am punch drunk by her side
Toe to toe, pound for pound
She's the toughest girl in town

She said you gotta roll
With the punches my friend
Stay with me to the end

Roll
With the punches again
No I cannot defend
From round 1 to round 10
It's a knockout again

When you're down and you're on your back
Seeing stars all around
From the corner there comes the towel
Hear her words they are all around

I remember when I first met you
You left me black and blue
KTFO
On the flor

You gotta roll
With the punches my friend
Stay with me to the end

Roll
With the punches again
Yes I cannot defend
From round 1 to round 10

You gotta roll with the punches
You gotta roll with the punches
