Be nice to me
Don't you understand when I get home 
I need to breathe
Don't try to comfort me cos I'm not home 
Right now
I can feel 
The heat within you fire breath so hold me down
I'm not responsible for my actions now, oh no

[Chorus:]
Cloud nine is a place
Like a smile on your face
Or a warm embrace
I'm picking up all the pieces 
No particular time
When I feel on cloud nine
Don't tell me your sorry 

I can hear you listening at my door
But I wont let you in
You can huff and puff and blow my door down
Right now

[Chorus]

Cloud nine is a place
Like a smile on your face
I'm picking up all the pieces
No particular time
When I feel on cloud nine

I'm on cloud nine, the cuckoo and me are doing fine
Though I cough and splutter and I scream at night
You'll not get this fire alight
I'm on cloud nine

[Chorus repeat]
