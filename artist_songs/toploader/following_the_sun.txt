Sunday morning daylight breaking
Nothing's stopping me from smiling
Though my head is aching
Everything is fine

I'm mesmerised, your eyes excite me
All alone, but that just soothes me
There's no urgency in following the sun

But this ain't what I planned
Don't know really who I am
I'm not asking anyone to understand

It doesn't matter if the light burns my eyes
'Cause I'm where I wanna be
And it doesn't matter if I'm swallowed by the sky
'Cause I'm following the sun
Following the sun

Heading East I'm looking skyward
Start to think that maybe I could
Reach the rising sun
And catch her when she falls

Sunday evening daylight broken
Nothing stopping me from smiling
Just a fleeting glimpse and
Everything is fine

But this ain't what I planned
Don't know who I really am
I'm not asking anyone to understand

It doesn't matter if the light burns my eyes
'Cause I'm where I wanna be
And it doesn't matter if I'm swallowed by the sky
'Cause I'm following the sun
Following the sun
Following the sun

It doesn't matter if the light burns my eyes
'Cause I'm where I wanna be
And it doesn't matter if I'm swallowed by the sky
'Cause I'm following the sun
Following the sun

No it doesn't matter if the light burns my eyes
'Cause I'm where I wanna be
No it doesn't matter if I'm swallowed by the sky
'Cause I'm following the sun 
'Cause I'm following the sun 
'Cause I'm following the sun 
'Cause I'm following the sun
