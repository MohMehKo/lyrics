I can’t see me, coming out of the swamp
Too late, she said, too late, she said
Now, she’s, just a head above the water
Trying to breathe, trying to breathe
You’re a little broken,
But I wanna get to know ya
I can’t help myself

[Chorus:]
Fill my heart with your emotion
Help me help myself
She said, she said
Fill my life with sweet emotion
Help me live again
She said, she said

Hear me calling, feel is gonna fall in
Cuts deep, she said, cuts deep, she said
So darling take it easy,
… make you feel …
Takes time she said
Takes time she said
I know your eyes are open
But I wanna get to know ya
I can’t help myself

[Chorus:]
Fill my heart with your emotion
Help me help myself
She said, she said
Fill my life with sweet emotion
Help me live again
She said, she said
She said, she said,
She said, she said,
She said, she said,
She said, she said

You’re a little broken,
But I wanna get to know ya
I can’t help myself

[Chorus:]
Fill my heart with your emotion
Help me help myself
She said, she said
Fill my life with sweet emotion
Help me live again
She said, she said.
