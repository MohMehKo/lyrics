I don't need a whole lot of money,
I don't need a big fine car, 
I got everything that a man could want, 
I got more than I could ask for, 
And I don't have to run around, 
I don't have to stay out all night, 
Cos I got a sweet, a sweet loving woman, 
And she know just how to treat me right, 

My baby, she's alright
My baby, clean out of sight
Well, let me tell you now, 
She's some kind of wonderful
She's some kind of wonderful
She's some kind of wonderful
Yeah

When I hold her in my arms, 
She sets my soul on fire, 
Oh when my baby kisses me, 
My heart becomes filled with desire, 
When she wraps her loving arms around me, 
Almost drives me out of my mind, 
Oh when my baby touches me, 
Chills run up and down my spine, 

Yeah, my baby, she's alright
My baby, clean out of sight
Well, let me tell you now, 
She's some kind of wonderful, she is
She's some kind of wonderful, yeah yeah yeah

Got a sweet little woman like mine, 
There's got to be somebody, 
Got a got a sweet little woman like mine,
