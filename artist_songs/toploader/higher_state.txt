its a happy day for you and i
the sun is up and shining in the sky
got a heart of gold that i can see
baby you got you now you got me
something's on so don't be late
its time to leave for the higher state

there is no time to be low tomorrow
there's only time to kill
there's no time to be high and fly
there's only time to thrill

so when i am up and you are down
baby that's when you gotta come around
gotta ease my pain and soothe my brain
gotta take me in out of this rain
something's on so don't be late
its time to leave for the higher state

there is no rhyme to express my emotion
there's only rhyme to feel
there is no rhyme to fulfill my devotion
there's only rhyme to heal

don't fret get high there's a new dawn that says hi
the higher state

[repeat]

its a happy day for you and i
the sun is up and shining in the sky
got a heart of gold that i can see
baby you got you now you got me

it is no crime to be lost with no direction
its just a crime not to live
and there is no crime to be asked for affection
its just a crime not to live

dont fret get high theres a new dawn that says hi
the higher state
