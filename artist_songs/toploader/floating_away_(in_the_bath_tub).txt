Floating away in the bath tub
This may sound strange to you
It feels so nice when you rub rub
Open my hands to the moon

Splishing and splashing and wishing and rushing
It's more fun in here than the zoo
Slippery salamanders on my tail
I'm the dog that ran off with the spoon
Or the cow that jumped over the moon

Do you know what it means?
To be floating away
Floating away
