I was so lost so out of time,
My spirit gone no appetite
No master plan to understand
I felt no balance in my hands.

[Chorus:]
You can swing to the right
If it makes you feel alright
You can veer to the left
Get your problems off your chest
Talk to God, I don't know
But you know which way to go
Oh, you give the balance to all things
There is a balance to all things.

I slept all day and not at night
no good night songs or lullabies
Made her stand took my hand
Through your eyes I understand.

[Chorus:]
You can swing to the right
If it makes you feel alright
You can lean to the left
Keep the cards close to your chest
Talk to God, I don't know
But you know which way to go
Oh, cause you give the balance to all things
There is a balance to all things

Into the wild with the conscience at your side
Stay true to yourself to this nothing.

[Chorus]

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, it goes on and on and on and on and
