the sun it kiss my cheek yeah that feels fine
the breeze it strokes my feet that feels fine
losing the track of the time
confused in a sun covered time

birdsong is all i hear while i am hear
im lost but cannot see these things i feel
circles appear in my mind
floating through space and through time

you might feel laughter in the sun
but laughter might help us when were done
you might feel laughter in the sun
but laughter might help us when were done

silhouetted by the sun my angel comes
dressed in white
a broad white smile outshines the sun
oh such a picture is this
my angel she stoops for a kiss

you might feel laughter in the sun
but laughter might help us when were done
you might feel laughter in the sun
but laughter might help us when were done
i said you might feel laughter in the sun
but laughter might help us when were done
you might feel laughter in the sun
but laughter might help us when were done
