When all the boats had left the shore
A thousand people, maybe more
As the sun burnt through their eyes
You could sense their deep surprise
And I guess one would assume
That we're playing different tunes

No one realised what was wrong
It was all lost in a song
And the people stopped to cry
A sea of tears flowed from their eyes
And then everybody says
But they always say to late

It's such a shame, we all feel the pain
Of stupid games, it's such a shame
There is no gain, we all feel the pain
Of stupid games

History passed me by at school
But I, by no means play the fool
The past and present melt to one
But the future now has gone
And I guess one would assume
That there's nothing left to lose

No more science left to bend
The world was flat we reached the end
The other side now maybe nice
Now's your turn to roll the dice

And then everybody's still
But I can't help but feel

It's such a shame, we all feel the pain
Of stupid games, it's such a shame
There is no gain, we all feel the pain
Of stupid games

Don't you even see that we don't
Want to play this game no more?
Send a satellite to rescue us alone
Alone once more

It's such a shame, there is no gain
We all feel the pain, of stupid games
It's such a shame, we all feel the pain
Of stupid games
