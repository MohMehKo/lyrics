I reached you oh so very late
Already waiting at the gate
The pictures on the wall
They remind us all that things have got to change
Or else they still remain
It's got to change

[Chorus:]
You had it all, but it broke your heart
You want it all, right from the start
It's over but never forgotten
It's over

I could not have done anymore
Already walking through the doors
But the pictures on the wall
They remind us all that things have got to change
Or else they still remain
It's got to change

[Chorus]

But the pictures on the wall
They remind us all that things have got to change
Or else they still remain
It's got to change

[Chorus repeat]
