The Midas touch is everywhere, everywhere
Your just not the same
When I turn you to gold
Like stories of old

The Midas touch is in me now, in me now
But how do I feel, when I'm torn in two
Between gold and you, gold and you
Gold and you

The boy with the Midas touch
Turning us all to gold
Only by touching us, only by feeling us
There's no escape from those take
The lifeblood of the people
You'll never be a king, my friend
You'll never be

Heaven sent, but hell bent, hell bent
You're just a child with the strength of many
Your head's on a penny
Lonely as sin, no riches within
No riches within
In love with the girl who works in your kitchen
You're leaving her itching for more
But she won't let you touch her
She won't let you kiss her
So, she'll never be yours

The boy with the Midas touch
Turning us all to gold
Only by touching us, only by feeling us
There's no escape from those take
The lifeblood of the people
You'll never be a king, my friend
You'll never be
Never be

The boy with the Midas touch
The boy with the Midas touch
The boy with the Midas touch
The boy with the Midas touch
No escape from those take
The lifeblood of the people
You'll never be a king my friend 
You'll never be
You'll never be king
You'll never be
You'll never be king
You'll never be
You'll never be
