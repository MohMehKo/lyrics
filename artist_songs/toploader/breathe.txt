A friend I had once told me
Such an unusual story
Of a man who did breathe in,
But never did breathe out
This tale reminds me of you
Though a different shade of blue
You cannot always take and never give,
This is not how to life

You gotta breathe in and out
You gotta spread a little love all around
Though I don't know this for sure
Just another knock at my door
A sprinkling of an inkling underneath an apple tree
I'll tell you when I find out
And show you what it is to breathe out
A natural progression lesson messing up your mind

You gotta breathe in and out
You gotta spread a little love all around
You gotta breathe in and out
You gotta spread a little love all around

I feel in you, another way to be
I watch as you breathe over me, I'm breathing

Like a tale on Jackanory
The end to this unusual story
Is a breath upon a window pane, so come on,
Step out of the rain

Thought I'd like to think this were true
You've become a deeper shade of blue
In my eyes, this comes as no surprise,
You've nothing left to give...no

You gotta breathe in and out 
You gotta spread a little love all around
You gotta breathe in and out
You gotta spread a little love all around
