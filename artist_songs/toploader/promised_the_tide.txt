I can't believe what I have seen
A girl that I know from a dream
She is the one, though she don't know
And I must find out where she's to go

I get the feeling that we met before
Although I do not think that she saw
Eyes open wide
Unleash the tide
As the ocean washed over me
And the setting sky took over me

I will sail upon this promised tide for days
But the promised tide may lie
About the promises it makes

When I find that which is naturally mine
I sail from the harbour out to the sea
I follow that map that I drew in a dream
To the land where you fell in love with me
To a place where you chose to be with me

I will sail upon this promised tide for days
But the promised tide may lie
About the promises it makes

I'm a sailor in search of land
I'm a player without a band
I'm a soldier in search of war
I have money, but I am poor

Land ahoy, I think I saw
The promised tide released me
Upon the shore, I got the feeling once more
As the girl from dreams stood over me
