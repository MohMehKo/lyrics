when you look to the past
you wont miss what you're missing no no
thank the heavens above these days are gone

keep good faith on the shelf
use it when you're not well
all the mistakes that you've made
don't matter know no

do you know what your future will be
do you know what your future will be

don't wear your heart on your sleeve
too many lives to retrieve
mother nature will help you if you let her oh

keep back a bit for yourself
keep it with faith on the shelf
safe under your wing its just a silly thing

do you know what your future will be
do you know what your future will be

get up get down
running around the town
round and round in your head
you gotta rest your sleepy head

so when you look to the past
you wont miss what you're missing
thank the heavens above
those days are gone

do you know what your future will be
do you know what your future will be
