[Mabel:]
Why can't I tell if you're into me
I'm a nine, you're five
Been away for a couple of weeks
It could be more cause I lost track of time
Driving on the wrong side, thinking of you
On the tenth floor, thinking of you
And it isn't like me to be insecure
Oh, what have you done to my mind? Whoa

Wanna be with you
Wanna be with you
Oh my God, I'm a mess
Boy, you got to me, got to me
You know you got to me

Tried to forget about you and no chance
I wasn't looking for a romance
Blue skies but I'm in the dark
Waiting on someone that gotta pick me up
Ooh, oh, whoa-oh
Thinking of you, thinking of you
Ooh, oh, whoa-oh
Thinking of you, thinking of you

[AJ Tracey:]
I'm thinking of you, are you thinking 'bout me?
I'm thinking of you, are you thinking 'bout me?
Girl, I said I'm thinking of you, are you thinking 'bout me?

You wasn't looking for this, but it found you
I ain't chasing hoes, I'm tryna always be around you
You said "give me some space, cause I'm thinking it through"
I'm just tryna hear you call and say "I'm thinking of you"
You're breathtaking like Gucci Mane's Cartiers
I'm away on business, I'm still thinking 'bout you half the day
It's like I'm tryna be that character I can't portray
And baby got a smile that can brighten up the darkest day
I'm on the M-way, charge with the mandem
Still I'm thinking of you, I'm alone so I'm drinking for two
You're like a song I'm tryna get out my head
And it's like everywhere I go, the DJ's spinning the tune
See, my favourite hoodie's sitting there, smelling of you
I weren't looking for a wedding, it's true, it's like I'm red and you're blue
We really need to talk about what this is
I see my phone ringing, I'm just dreading it's you

[Mabel:]
In the hills with the windows down
Telling me he wants to show me around
He knows somebody with a fancy house
On the playlist, soon to be famous
He took me to the beach, I was thinking of you
Standing in his room but I was thinking of you
And I don't want you to be insecure
Oh, don't wanna play with your mind, whoa

Wanna be with you
Wanna be with you
Oh my God, I'm a mess
Boy you got to me, got to me
You know you got to me, oh

Tried to forget about you and no chance
I wasn't looking for a romance
Blue skies but I'm in the dark
Waiting on someone that gotta pick me up
Ooh, oh, whoa-oh
Thinking of you, thinking of you
Ooh, oh, whoa-oh
I'm thinking of you, thinking of you, thinking of you

Ooh, I'm coming right back
You're enough to make me turn around and backtrack
Ooh, I'm coming right back
Tell all your friends that I'm coming right back
Ooh, I'm coming right back
You're enough to make me turn around and backtrack
Ooh, I'm coming right back
Tell all your friends that I'm coming right back
