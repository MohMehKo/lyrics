Lose a layer or two and let's get lost in time
Rest your head next to mine, there's nothing left to hide
Let's talk all night until the sunlight turns up

I can go all day wearing nothing but your kiss
I can go all day wearing nothing but your kiss

Take it off, tell me everything
Now there's nothing in between us
Nothing in between us
Take it off, thought I knew everything
There's so much more to love about you
More to love about you

Doesn't matter what you wear now that I've see you like this
I thought I knew you but there's something I missed
You can hold me closer, feel the warmth of my skin

I could go all day wearing nothing but your kiss
I could go all day wearing nothing but your kiss

Take it off, tell me everything
Now there's nothing in between us
Nothing in between us
Take it off, thought I knew everything
There's so much more to love about you
More to love about you

We go back to sleep around twenty to ten
We wasted the morning but I'll do it again
We go back to sleep around twenty to ten
We wasted the morning but I'll do it again

Take it off, tell me everything
Now there's nothing in between us
Nothing in between us
Take it off, thought I knew everything
There's so much more to love about you
More to love about you
