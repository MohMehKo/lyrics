Even rain in the middle of July
So I hanging at the same place we always do
All your friends know that we're here together
So why you gotta go, why you gotta go

Put your hands all over me
Asking me how much I love you
Nothing has changed since yesterday
I still adore you

You got me feeling so high
Maybe we could stop time
Every moment we're together, babe
We can make our own world
Just let me be my own girl
We'll talk about forever babe
You know I, you know I
You know that I do
You know I love you
Talk about forever, babe
You know that I do
You know I love you
Talk about forever

Lights dimmed glow
And I'm looking at my phone
Just trying to mind my business
Why we have to go down the same old road
I didn't know I was being dismissive

You got your hands all over me
Asking me if I still want you
Nothing has changed since yesterday
I'll reassure you

You got me feeling so high
Maybe we could stop time
Every moment we're together, babe
We can make our own world
Just let me be my own girl
We'll talk about forever babe
You know I, you know I
You know that I do
You know I love you
Talk about forever, babe
You know that I do
You know I love you
Talk about forever

You got me feeling so high
Maybe we could stop time
Every moment we're together, babe
We can make our own world
Just let me be my own girl
We'll talk about forever babe
You know I, you know I
You know that I do
You know I love you
Talk about forever, babe
You know that I do
You know I love you
Talk about forever
You know that I do
Talk about forever, baby
You know that I do love you, love you
Talk about forever babe
