Say we ain't got no dope
All I got's my forty 
Ain't got nobody baby
That I can call my shorty

(Sing that with me)
Say we ain't got no dope
All I got's my forty 
Ain't got nobody baby
That I can call my shorty

I'd like to give a shout out to all my VIP's 
And individualize 'cause I'm an MC 
I can because I care because my family's here 
Cause I (cause I what) 
Cause I (cause I what) 
Cause I 'preciate the mentality of music
I'm savin' all my sentences unless of course I'm smoothly spoken 
Quiet type the kind to watch out for
No man of the clan I'm perpetratin' the scam
Sure I'm the boy with the fallopian voice
Straight from the sleeve of any wizard of choice 
I got the reason to be roamin' out the coverage area 
Send me the bill if all my lovin' is scarin' ya

Dare you to dream the way that I believe 
I got the skill to go commando in any fatigues 
I got the best damn band in the music scene
But I could also flow solo or just let it be because 
Of the love
Oh the self realization is your if and and but
But you gotta know your name before the play of the game
Keep a levelheaded check on your health and stay sane

Address the tack on the track
The needle's on the record
Prepare for playback
Sayjack 
Oh could I buy another vowel? I need another clue and I could also use a towel 
And 
How goes the medium tempo
Slayin' all the teachers like the class of '84 
And down low
You know my fidelities go 
Well I would never hurt a fly with the didas on 

I got control
I keep a clean toilet bowl
2000 flushes blue and still goin' strong 
Do I do what I do for the sake of the song comin' through on the radio? 
Naw it's for you 
This is proof
My own story's a spoof
I'll always be a gypsy 
I'll forever be aloof 
And if you never get to likin' me it's okay too
But you made it this far so pay your toll at the booth
Ah yes you made it this far so pay your toll at gate 
Yes you made it this far now make some noise in this place 
I said we made it this far now let's get back to the part that we sing (what?)

We ain't got no dope
All I got's my forty 
Ain't got nobody baby
That I can call my shorty

We ain't got no dope
All I got's my forty 
Ain't got nobody baby
That I can call my shorty

True or false?
I can be a sensitive man
With sensible plans for the everyday woman 
And I can keep you eatin' out the palm of my hand 
Because the dope that we smoked was grown on my land 
The words I burn they don't come from a can
The movie in my mind'll be the winner at Cannes 
So take your chance
Apply for full or part-time romance 
Clever or the better measure up to whatever 
Cause it don't matter how tall
How fat or how small
Equal opportunities are open to all

The casting call line forms down the hall
All you need is I.D that shows that you're legal
But people with egos, a freakshow, a syndrome 
You best not go
You know I don't need those 
If you got a problem that I really aughta read 
Then post it on the web care of R-K-O-P

It's easy like me but a bit less than cheesy 
Go heavy on the melody and add a dash of pink 
And if you can't stand the kitchen get the hell out the heat

To meet with the geek all you need is a heartbeat
And to meet with the geek on the streets all you gotta do is know the words you sing 
So everybody repeat this after me
(sing it)

Ain't got no dope
All I got's my forty (all I got is a forty)
Ain't got nobody baby
That I can call my shorty 

Ain't got no dope
All I got's my forty (all I got is a forty)
Ain't got nobody baby
That I can call my shorty

Well I'm I'm type A positive and just the way I like it
Right away I'm satisfied with my food before I try it 
Can't deny it to save my life 
I'm never lyin' 

To brave this mic without the same thing twice 
Is actually an act of stayin' up all night 
With the mood just right
And the purchase of a flight
From the west cost
To these Netherlands lights it's aurora borealis' company that I'm tight with 

Despite everything that you've heard
I'll admit that most are true 
And I'll be keeping my word
And I will do the double duty on the search for new verbs 
And I'll report to work early to deliver the worm

With a back well covered by my buddies of ease
Now ain't no way in hell that I will ever have to say please
Breakin' all the codes on the latest machines
I'll even let you download me for free
(for free)
(for free)
(for free)

We ain't got no dope
All I got's my forty 
Ain't got nobody baby
That I can call my shorty

We ain't got no dope
All I got's my forty 
Ain't got nobody baby
That I can call my shorty
