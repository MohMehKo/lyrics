It was way too close
I almost gave up the ghost
But after some repose
I gathered my composure

It could've been hit for me
I could've been history
I could've given up easily
But I guess it wasn't meant to be

I feel like I'm back in the game
I feel like something has changed
I feel like I'm back in control
I know in my soul I'm gonna make it

Yes, I am back in the game 
And suddenly everything has changed
I'm not gonna let it slip through my hands
This is my chance, I'm gonna take it

I put another couple minutes on the clock
I ain't finished cause it isn't time to stop
Don't you ever say it's over when it's not
I'm here to win it, gonna give it all I got

Put another couple quarters in the slot
You never know when you will get another shot
I'll go however many rounds until I drop
I'm on a roll I'm gonna show you what I'm not

Well I guess I'm back in the game
I feel like something has changed
I feel like I'm back in control
I know in my soul I'm gonna make it

Yes, I am back in the game 
And suddenly everything has changed
I'm not gonna let it slip through my hands
This is my chance, I'm gonna take it

When I was down, when I was broke, when I was feeling lost
When I was down on my knees and couldn't shake it off
I remembered to breathe so I could feel strong again

One breath, one day, one night at a time
Fighting my failures and fears
Freeing them from my mind
So I could let love in and let love out again

See, I am back in the game
I feel like something has changed
Yes, I feel like I'm back in control
I know in my soul I'm gonna make it

Yes, I am back in the game
Suddenly everything has changed
I'm not gonna let it slip through my hands,
This is my change, I'm gonna take it

Let it be, let it be a brighter day
Let it be, let it be the only way
Let it be, let it be another victory

Let it be, let it be a brighter sun
Let it be, that I'm not the only one
Let it be, let it be another victory
