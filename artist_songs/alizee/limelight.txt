Dream always and all ways
I don't know where I'm going.
Looking for the limelight (bright)

I can't recall where I've been, 
In this long long white night
Find a way and away
I don't know if I should... 

Burning waves of ecstasy... Oui... 

Stairs, lights, music, sweat
Scares, frights, panic, threat
