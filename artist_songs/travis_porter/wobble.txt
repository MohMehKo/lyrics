Big face honeys in my honey by the porch
Got some pains in my nipples, have to tell the bitch to shut
And you know I got it kicked by the mega bitch day
By the thought filled thousand nigga, back another day
I got money, I got bitches, I got hoes, I go fishing
With my feet like a stick pick that up like a pig
Then I take it to the prior like a wobble, wobble, wobble
Take it to the mouth, nigga, gobble, gobble, gobble.

We ball like basketball, got a white girl fruitin' on acid, yo
My friend ain't got no swaggin on, baby fought with me, yeah, you can have it all
Yeah, met on a Thursday, fucked on a Friday,
Put up in a 'rrari, magic, face it
Beam for the school with already badass, at least ain't a minute, I ain't trickin' if you got it
Bottle on earth, hoes turn up on side,
We got our boss on top of boss, hot auto, what you like?
Big room full of schless, I don't fought, don't wanna fight
Make a wobble on a dick, ride it like a motorbike.

Told that girl up on top of me why don't smokin' that broccoli
Say I got so much pass, she thought that she was Monopoly
Say I'm sexy, you ass, better not step on my property

I'm the man, no, you know I'm the man, no?
Make that ass wobble like one of your hands, bro
Like it lepro, she know how to do it
She gonna wobble wobble wobble and she do it to my music.
