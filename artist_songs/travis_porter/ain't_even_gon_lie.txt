I got a girl at home baby and, ain't even gon lie
And I want you to step out on her, ain't even gon lie
But girl you're too damn bad babe, ain't even gon lie
I gotta get you to my crib baby, ain't even gon lie
Girl I ain't gon' even, ain't gon' even, ain't even gon lie
Man I ain't gon' even, ain't gon' even, ain't even gon lie
Girl I ain't gon' even, ain't gon' even, ain't even gon lie
Man I ain't gon' even, ain't gon' even, ain't even gon lie

[Verse 1:]
I was down town to the west end, I was flexing
I was shining 'cause my watch match my necklace
Shawty name was Porhsa, she was georgous
It was real 'cause she complimented my jordans
Damn she freaked out she see the porsche
My girl left the crib or we can go to yours
And what we doin, ain't no need to know
And if they ain't fucking baby, they don't need to go

[Verse 2:]
I said first of all I got a girl at home
Ain't no need to lie
Baby girl call my cellphone, said she wanted me to stand by
Get a hotel and get situated, after that I say bye
Ask whatever I told the truth
Ain't no need to deny shit
Shawty sopping my main bitch, ye she cook and she clean shit
Damn right she a bad bitch, that's the bitch that I've been with
Look, that's just how the shit goes
Could see a pair in your hole
Quick break it down on these hoes

[Verse 3:]
Philip set the valet, he could stay was balet
AP was doing numbers hey you should've swinged my way
My hopped on the top, I don't need your doors and
Lil mama I got just what you be fiending for
Said she from Vegas, don't got a mega off on benz

Know them bandz gonna make it dance
