[Verse 1:]
Look, like 4 or 5 chicks came in this week
Even though I'm racked up I pretend to be cheap
With these number Jordan's and this 1000$ fleece
2 10000$ chains and I just signed a new lease
Man I pour up by the 4 every day do the math
What I speak in week, 28 split in half
Man I picked her up myself, when she left she took a cab
When I walk inside a set ain't no telling what I'm a grab aye

[Hook:]
20 racks in my pocket, gotta get it
20 racks in my pocket, gotta get it
Got yo girl in my pocket, gotta get it
Got yo girl in my pocket, gotta get it
20 racks in my pocket, I'm a witness
20 racks in my pocket, I'm a witness
Niggas tryna count my pockets, mind your business
Niggas tryna count my pockets, mind your business

[Verse 2:]
Niggas tryna count my pockets, got mo in the stash
Bought my mama a new car and bought my bitch a Aston
It ain't nothing but some hunnids in this bank roll
I'm official, I'm 100 if you ain't know

Real niggas, shout out Young Capone and Macy Yo
20 bands in my pocket, bout to spend it
Got yo girl in my pocket by the 20's

[Hook:]

[Verse 3:]
Niggas tryna count my pockets, mind your business

Getting pulled up close, I get stupid low

Got yo ho in my pocket like them rubber bands
