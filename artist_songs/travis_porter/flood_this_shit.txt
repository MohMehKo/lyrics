Fuck it, I don't give a fuck
In KO dealin' with my whole team
Flood that bitch like the water on
Rain rain thunderstorm
Louie stealin' all my dough

Turned up, bottles keep them coming
Weather man make it rain money

My B-boys be stained
They stribble right down so shlutty
I'm always spending money
Spend 10 racks layer money
Ball all night till the sun in
Stripper girls know they love me
Bills in my bank roll
All night spending pesos
Now my goons and my arms arive

Throwing it up while she hit the floor
So me and the ones we flood this shit
Let the covers up, my joint falls

[Chorus:]
And when she do it

And when she do it
