Make yo head go up and down like you jumpin on trampoline
Girl don't come trample me it's enough for all you three

Get a lil closer let me show u what they all gon see
And it's going where yo jaws should be
Keep yo draws on cause NAW they ain't all for me
Pass that hoe to Strap and he gon beat them walls fa me
He gon break the law fa me

Why these hoes is all on me
And I ain't all alone
This bitch gave me stadium nigga fuck a dome
