Bank (Bank) roll on me, Hoe dont matter where I'm at 
Guala, guala, guala, bitch you know I get it
Dollar, dollar, dollar, fuck it up in Magic City
Bitch spent about a 50, canary-yellow diamond
Look like lemonade, hell yeah them bitches shinin'!
Sack right, pass (pass) right
Clothes in the winter that don't come out 'til next year
When I'm down in Florida, I be at the Fountain Blue
Diamonds doin' numbers, yeah them bitches Mountain Dew
Porsche panamara (pyooom!), take off at the light 
If you aint got no sack, then you ain't got no life!

I went to M.I.A. just to watch the game
and I walked across the street, to the condo on Biscayne
Big face roley, bitch should know me
And when yo' bitches see me, they like holy guapamole (Uh)
We be 'bout that chedder, we be 'bout that cheese

Nigga's talkin' crazy, man it's ludacris
Baggin' nigga's bitches like the grocery store
I said my name is Guap, she caught the holy ghost
And I just turn up for the hell of it
Pack in my drawer's pocket, but you still can smell this shit
And I don't fuck with hoes that say they celibate
I do what I want, they say I'm arrogant
It's Guap bitch, label me the president
If you ain't talkin' money, man that shits irrelevant!

[Ali]
....like money guap
Gettin' it, I can not stop
Buying shit I can not stop
Polo on my shirt, nigga Polo on my socks
Blessed cause I be kickin' shit, I got rich off of investin' shit
And I just keep requestin' it
I'm rich as fuck, no question it
Stackin' in the winter, Ballin' in the summer
I'm busy countin' money, ain't got time for all that drama
And I just got a call, I'm headed overseas
Money is all I need, pussy is not a need
Family I got to feed, and that is not a choice
I'm feeling real good, in that four door Porsche
I'm all about a check, but not by force
Lookin' good, livin' good of course!
