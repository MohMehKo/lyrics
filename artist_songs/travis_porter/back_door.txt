She said her man acting up, but where the hell he at.?
Acting like you in love, say why u doin dat.?
All the arguing baby you ain't got to do that.
Just hit me up need I'm a show where it's real at.
And later she calling my phone and say she ain't alone cause her boyfriends home,
But he sleep.
I arrive and I beep, that's this week.
But next week I'll be back for repeat. YYYEEEEEEAAAAA!

[Chorus:]
Aaaaa now here we go again.
She said her man actin up, well here we go again.
All the fussing need fighting, well here they go again.
She say he upstairs sleep. Can I come over then.?
Now I'm heading to the back door.
Now I'm standin at the back door.
She done snuck me through the back door.
I got a quickie and now I'm headin out the bak door.

[Verse 1:]
Joker outside her hormones going wild.
She was playing with herself like she was an only child
And all the whole while he didn't know one thing.
I got wood so you kno it was splinters on her tongue ring.
By golly I'm all in this bitch.
He couldn't have met this ass cause he don't kno shit.
Plus they all want to hit, but she said she not a whore.
If you ain't want us both to fuck what you let them in for.?
We on the floor, we all on the couch, he all in her ass and I'm all in her mouth.
I went ham wham bam thank you mam even to a slow jam it was still a grand slam...
GOD DAMN!

[Chorus:]
Aaaaa now here we go again.
She said her man actin up, well here we go again.
All the fussing need fighting, well here they go again.
She say he upstairs sleep. Can I come over then.?
Now I'm heading to the back door.
Now I'm standin at the back door.
She done snuck me through the back door.
I got a quickie and now I'm headin out the bak door.

[Verse 2:]
Now Tiffany is a freak, Tameka's a man-eater.
And if her man find out then best believe he's going to beat her.
Then Nikki hit me up (wassup, wassup) she say she want some dicky
I'm at the bak door so put on yo dickie.
You can sneak me round the bak around12
I just want a quicky, but she want a round 12.
This girl is hell. Her man is upstairs and if he wake up, he's smelling sex in the air.
Come out there, I'm gone. Headin to the next bitch.
Back door exit, hopped in my crown vic.
Hit me up later though, turn up my radio. I can fuck you but I ain't captain save a hoe...

[Chorus:]
Aaaaa now here we go again.
She said her man actin up, well here we go again.
All the fussing need fighting, well here they go again.
She say he upstairs sleep. Can I come over then.?
Now I'm heading to the back door.
Now I'm standin at the back door.
She done snuck me through the back door.
I got a quickie and now I'm headin out the bak door.

[Verse 3:]
Now let me tell you bout this girl named Kieshia.
Yea Kieshia got a man, but Kieshia she a freaka.
But Kieshia she a pleaser, she a nasty senorita.
And all you have to do is give her pizza.
I think that you should meet her.
But I hope her man doesn't see her,
Because I'm goin ham,
I'm fucking all on the freezer and back in high sckool I had a ass behind the bleecher.
And she remind me of this girl Tameka (Tameka). DAMN...

[Bridge:]
But aaaa here we go again.
I hit her on on the sofa, now we on the floor again.
She can't swallow so I'm in her throat again (you on ha throat).
And after that I guess I'm out the door again.

[Chorus:]
Aaaaa now here we go again.
She said her man actin up, well here we go again.
All the fussing need fighting, well here they go again.
She say he upstairs sleep. Can I come over then.?
Now I'm heading to the back door.
Now I'm standin at the back door.
She done snuck me through the back door.
I got a quickie and now I'm headin out the bak door.
