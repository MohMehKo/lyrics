Yea, I'm still in this bitch
My nigga T Cole E
Foo Foo
Black Ball
We back at it, nigga

Hard back at it, the same old thing
Me and Spinz got 10, 50 girls with tongue rings
Ho catch me the hunnids, I'm just being honest
Your body doing magic, my diamonds doing numbers

Back at it again, back at it with Spinz
When I ain't whippin the coupe I'm in back back of the Benz
Back mackin in France
You don't understand it boy
Yea we make a movie but we don't ever played oh

Ok now ho I'm back at it
Established better credit
I'm bout to cop a whip
I'm bout to go get tatted
I'm bout to scoop yo bitch
We bout to hit up magic
Got diamonds, ho is stunned
I think they crossed the gandget, oh well

[Hook:]
Ho, I'm back at it
Ho, I'm back at it
Back, at it, back at it again
Too turnt up, back at it with Spinz
Too turnt up, back at it with Spinz

Ok, on the highway, know a nigga smash shit
I don't give a damn about no 5 o'clock traffic
Weed burning up, windows rolled up
I'm headed to the cash with a blunt rolled up
So what?

Still on that same shit, fresher than a bitch
Switch up the floor low
Switch up the holler
Yo bitch my squad here
Put a house tomorrow nigga
Ain't no freeloadin, I'm hangin around with ya'll niggas uh

T's going down, I'm digging in the pound
I pull up with my round, I know they gon hold me down
Behold TTU, they turnt up on the crew
We back it, line to line and you're a pig, cool

[Hook:]
Ho, I'm back at it
Ho, I'm back at it
Back, at it, back at it again
Too turnt up, back at it with Spinz
Too turnt up, back at it with Spinz
