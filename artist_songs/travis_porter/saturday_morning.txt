Ugh

Today feels like there'll be no problems

Man it's Saturday morning
Just woke up
Just hopped out the bed
And start stretchin' and yawnin'
Today is a good day
Because Saturday mornin' (Saturday mornin')
I hopped up brush my teeth and my hair
And then I took a look in the mirror
It's a Saturday morning
I hope I have me a good night
Because it's Saturday morning

What should I do today
I hopped out the bed brushed my teeth and face
Check my cell phone I got three missed calls
Hopped in the shower just to wash my balls
Hopped out the shower then I dry off
Fuck that man I think I need some time off
The club is kind of a drag
And I think I need a drink or two
So I took the drink and said

Saturday morning
Just woke up just hopped out the bed
And start stretchin' and yawnin'
Today is a good day
Because it's Saturday mornin' (Saturday mornin')
I hopped up brush my teeth and my hair
And then I took a look in the mirror
It's a Saturday morning
I hope I have me a good night
Because it's Saturday morning

(Yawn)
Oh my breathe stank
I need a brush my teeth
What the fuck
Who the hell are you

Last night was long as fuck
Cause I was drunk as fuck
And I was crunk as fuck
Don't think I'm wakin' up
I hear the buzzer beepin'
I hear the phone ringin'
I hear these people hollin'
Like who the fuck is kickin'
Now who the fuck is in here
And why you in my bed
She said you met me last night
And you got in my legs
I said you gave me head
Well shit what's your name
I don't remember her name
But shit it's all game

It's Saturday morning
Just woke up just hopped out the bed
And start stretchin' and yawnin'
Today is a good day
Because it's Saturday mornin' (Saturday mornin')
I hopped up brush my teeth and my hair
And then I took a look in the mirror
It's a Saturday morning
I hope I have me a good night
Because it's Saturday morning

(Yawn)
Oh shit
Man last night was crazy
What fuckin' time it is
Two o'clock p.m.

Woke up late this morning
Long night of horing
Tick tick tick
I think it's time for recording
I brushed my teeth washed my face
Now I'm rejuvenated
Check my palm pilot
What am I to do today
Feelin' new today
It's a good day
Drink a lot of liquor
Smoke a lot of good today
Saturday night it's going down
I hope my car don't end up in the impound
Yea

[Phone ringing]
