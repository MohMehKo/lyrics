[Intro:]
Thank You God

[Hook:]
Ok, I put em on my chest to remind me
I put some diamonds in them things just to blind em
And then my niggas come around try to block me
I took the main in they plot, they wanna rob me
Why them niggas hatin dog? Why they wanna take it from me?
I don't know
Why they wanna take it from me?
I don't really know
I can't let these niggas take it from me
I don't really know
Can you keep a secret? They just want my Jesus pieces

[Verse 1:]
Ferrari, Camaro, Lamborghini to Bentley
My niggas itchin to bust shoot these bitches, waitin to see me
Me and 3 we be leanin, do 100 on Cleveland
I put that ice on my neck
And out that ice on my pinky
My nigga fuck what you thinkin
Somebody tryin me up
Keep Bugatti in this bitch, my nigga we linin em up
They want my Jesus pieces, my seats like recess pieces
I keep the bass up loud, man I'm super geekin
And I get that super soaker in the super sport but come tryin
Let my nigga 2 Chainz say I start a fuckin riot
Louie belt, Louie hat, ho I'm Louie to the floor
BBS's in my Jesus pieces, look at how they glow

And I keep a couple blunts, yea I blow a little lit

Yea, they only want me for my Jesus pieces
Yea, my jeweler Joseph got me hooked dog

[Verse 3:]
I stopped by enjoy 'cus I don't ball em all
I stopped takin to these hoes 'cus I don't fuck em all
Keep a big bank roll in my back pocket
Ah, I spend a grip on my fuckin draw
I say I'm a G 'cus I don't give a fuck
Old people don't like it but I don't give a fuck
That's my personality, quarter ounce my faculty
Got a bad bitch and I don't know her nationality
Uh, I don tried to take my Jesus piece
They want me underground, tryna bury me
Tell me why your main bitch tryna marry me
Big diamonds in my chain, that's that codeine
