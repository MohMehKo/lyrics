[Verse:]
Ah
All I wanna do is take all my niggas to Vegas
Buy a pound of weed and smoke it get them niggas faded
Yeah and buy some liquor man we gonna get wasted
Poppin' bottles on them hoes and tell them"Bitch we made it"
Yeah I wanna get a hundred grand of singles
Stack them shit so just like Pringles
Thanking God I'm single
Yeah, ready to mingle down
I'm trying to slam dunk
Yeah tryin' to finger roll
You know that feeling feeling feelin'
Like everything's changing
That feeling, feeling like you was
Instantly famous, feel that
Yeah, fuck that nigga Yeah I'm a kill that
And Y'all niggas don't know me
My team we got that feeling
We need some fucking trophies

[Chorus:]
Uh, we do it for the whole team
You know that feeling like you won a superbowl ring
We don't never get a day off, nah
Make the city proud like we won the playoffs
That feeling, that feeling, that feeling, that feeling
That feeling, that feeling, that feeling, that feeling
Feeling, that feeling, that feeling, that feeling
Feeling, that feeling, that feeling, that feeling

[Verse:]
I got this feeling this feeling I know it
That I'm about to make some millions, some millions then blow it
My my my my new bitch brazilian, she gorgeous
This new life that I'm living it's hard to absorb it
Ever had that feeling when you pull out they say who that
New school, blue black, drop top, push back
It's Ali I knew that, threw the whole bar 2 stacks
When I'm in the building and the hoes run a full flack
Trust an puerto rican, margaritas, burrito
Vacation with my people, we do this for our people
You know that feeling like you won a superbowl ring
No bo-ho man I'm playing for the team

[Chorus:]
Yeah, we do it for the whole team
You know that feeling like you won a superbowl ring
We don't never get a day off, nah
Make the city proud like we won the playoffs
That feeling, that feeling, that feeling
That feeling, that feeling, that feeling, that feeling
That feeling, that feeling, that feeling, that feeling
That feeling, that feeling, that feeling, that feeling

[Verse:]
Fill 'em to the fall, jerk 'em to the right
Feeling like a Mo, look at me and not the size
We're here for those how we roll
It's the feeling of a boss
I got trials on my line, got a million dollars house
We used to rot in coogie sweaters
Now it's Gucci all the time
Freshen hair, leather season
Wanna toll the summer time
Used to have a little bank roll
Now my bank roll larger, Strain former Camaro
Hot dite Charger
Gerry Guardian seats
Green light Shlick rims
Check my ring out Oh I'm on my superbowl shit
I'm flat in the sky, I'm up there with the birds
I do it for the team, you can motherfuck what you heard

[Chorus:]
Yeah, we do it for the whole team
You know that feeling like you won a superbowl ring
We don't never get a day off, nah
Make the city proud like we won the playoffs
That feeling, that feeling, that feeling
That feeling, that feeling, that feeling, that feeling
That feeling, that feeling, that feeling, that feeling
That feeling, that feeling, that feeling, that feeling
