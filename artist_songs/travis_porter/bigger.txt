[Verse 1:]
I get a big pound of get and burn it down with my niggas
Smoke in every room, ho rollin up swishas
In the hotel suite, you could smell it from the outside
Freaky ass freak, give me head form the southside
Blunt so swole, motherfucker like Cee Lo
Canary stone, shine a motherfucker, cost a kilo
Niggas on the west side, niggas on the eco
But I be on the east side catch me in the street ho

Damn getting money, hell yea that shit's ever did
She suck it all up, she ain't leaving no evidence
Bitch named Evelyn, higher than she ever been
Put er on the molly then she fucked me with my best friend
Doin some Versace then I dropped er by the west end
We go hard bout it, 20 grand on my left hand
Get a whole pound then blow it with my niggas
Whole room cloudy, ho rollin up swishas
A lot of niggas said they getting money, how they figure?
We smoke about a pound, ho we need 1000 swishas

You niggas don't never touch the rim
'Cus ya'll some air about niggas, old square about niggas
That mean yo trap don't bounce, that mean yo ass can't count
Shit I just made a large amount
And then I threw it in my account
And if that shit too much I keep an account in just a count
