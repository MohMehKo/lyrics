[Verse 1:]
Lay yo body down just so I can touch ya I hopin that you're ready and I dont wanna rush
Ya so just to set the mood I put on a lil usher and now we trading places and wrestling under covers.
Uh. 10 to 15 I'm ready to blast off while we playing under covers

Nan then she brought another friend. I told her...

[Chorus:]
Get naked. Take ya clothes off, wipe off ya lip gloss, ya body so soft.
