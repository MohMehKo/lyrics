If I ever been this drunk befo', then I neva eva think I been this drunk befo'
But I'm drunk, befo'....its fo' (four)

[Chorus]
Breakfast at the Waffle House, 20 sausage biscuits
Hold on, excuse me ma'am, what comes on a sausage biscuit?
20 more orange juices, 20 more biscuits

[Verse 1]

Joint joint joint joint smoke smoke smoke
