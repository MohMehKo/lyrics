[Intro:]
Nah, man I remember when I was 17
A nigga always had a dream but how could you blame us?
Who ever thought a nigga would be this famous?

[Hook:]
I remember when I was 17
And I had a dream to get up on the screen, now I'm in
But how could you blame us?
Who'd ever thought we'd be this famous?
Now I hit the club in foreign cars
Keep kush in my gars, I'm buyin out the bars
But that money can't change us
Who'd ever thought I'd be this famous?

[Verse 1:]
BT and MTV, they know me
Respect this grind, respect my time
They better respect this rollie
That nigga just turned 20 fore he think he Kobe
These niggas fake, these niggas flaws, man you niggas phony
And I'm 3 things and I'm not boy
I remember I was brought up watchin 3 6 and them hot boys
Ridin round them blocks boy
The club is always hot boy
Hit the club, party like a rockstar, shot boys
And I was slick that I can sell a dream
I was hell, I took a share when I was 17
Young niggas livin fast, that's a motor sport
Fucked up, bounced back, ain't even go to court
Niggas getting killed and my niggas was killin
Had to kill that shit and change our way of livin
Used to hit the club just to bust heads
Now I'm bustin bad bitches I done buck yea

[Hook:]
I remember when I was 17
And I had a dream to get up on the screen, now I'm in
But how could you blame us?
Who'd ever thought we'd be this famous?
Now I hit the club in foreign cars
Keep kush in my gars, I'm buyin out the bars
But that money can't change us
Who'd ever thought I'd be this famous?

[Verse 2:]
I remember them cold nights in December
Through the storm but we won, we some winners
I sip the whip up, getting on for the hood
Gotta show love every time I ride through it
You done did so much work in the A Town street
Used to be smoking purps in the A Town E
Night Cuban lean, Jesus piece, free Sinner Sweet
They after me, they after me, they callin me they majesty
I'm on the road and I ain't stopping got em dancing on the pole
Get that pussy poppin
We used to raj a bow, now it's rich nigga cutting
24 show, every day going shoppin
When I was 17 would've never dream it
With you to be scheming, nigga hittin licks
99 problems but ain't none bout a bitch
And to the day I rest I'm goin HAM with my clique, yep ha

[Hook:]
I remember when I was 17
And I had a dream to get up on the screen, now I'm in
But how could you blame us?
Who'd ever thought we'd be this famous?
Now I hit the club in foreign cars
Keep kush in my gars, I'm buyin out the bars
But that money can't change us
Who'd ever thought I'd be this famous?

[Verse 3:]
Look, I remember I just wanted to be popular
This is what I wanted, I ain't wanna be no doctor bruh
My mama want a lawyer, my grandma wanted a preacher
But comin where I come from I ain't wanna be neither
At the age of 15 I was workin on a dream
My people ain't had no money so I can barely do a thing
So I went and got a job and I thought it was the answer
My brother told me dream, he just tryna set examples
So I learn how to record, we did it on our own
After a couple months of struggling we done finally made a song
Oh shit, be the best for the night, don't forget
And I'm a do this til it's over with, yea

[Hook:]
I remember when I was 17
