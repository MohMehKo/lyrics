Goin deep in it
Going deep in it
Said the pussy so good I could sleep in it
Goin deep in it
Going deep in it
All my bad bitches to the V.I.P

She ain't ever did it, she gon' try tonight
Goin deep in it like I'm Roddy White
Me, ya old man couldn't see a peon
Touch down down like my name Deon
Diamonds on my chain that's Sierra Leone
We gettin money bitch, that's what planet we on
Bicth named Venus said that I'm the meanest
Told her shut up bitch, and come suck a penis
Ridin' in a Beamer, smokin on the doobies
Pretty ass face with a big ass booty
Uh, huh got a fat ass, how that mouth feel?
At the party at T-Raww crib

Gold chains niggas' top rank
Hundid' billas' on yo' face
Make a bitch pop shake
No safe, ask "why"
Keep the combo on my waist
Case a nigga hate
Jason style put em' in a lake
I don't gotta answer to nobody
I did it don't regret it
No time for sorry, Whip game Ferrari
You starin, I'm stuntin' hardly
All these bitches they Barbies
But I'm the life of the party
Got a... Condo got [?] you could live in
Schooling these hoes, the gon' have to pay tuition
At the party at my crib you don't get a mission
What ya' bitch told her, stop bitchin'

Going deep in it
Going deep in it
Said the pussy so good I could sleep in it
Going deep in it
Going deep in it
All my bad bitches to the V.I.P [x2]

I'm going deep in it
I'm going deep in it
But I found all the bitch I won't sleep on it
I won't sleep in it, yeah I'm a leap in it
But when I put it in your mouth
Don't put your teeth in it
She in to too bad she cool
On the late night might fuck you in the pool

Need help on the rest
