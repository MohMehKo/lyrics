[Verse 1]
Crazy crazy turkey ham banana
my life is very crazy, I am something you can't handle
you don't like what you seein', I suggest you change the channel
and for you thirsty hoes, here's a dollar, buy a Fanta
or buy a Tropicana, she told me watch my manners
I think that I'm the shit, I need to go buy me some Pampers
I'm all the way in Savannah, with this girl I call Diana
I hit it from the back, and then Ali just went bananas
but shawty keep on textin me, molestin me
why is she harassing me? and asking me why are you so crazy crazy crazy?
I don't know why I'm so crazy, mane I got a stomach achey
In the morning, eggs and bacon, told yo girl dont fix it naked

[Chorus]
I go banananananana, I go crazycrazycrazy

[Verse 2]
I'm so high in the air, I cannot breathe
I'm so low to the Earth that I can't even touch my knees
I'm so right that I'm left and I'm so up that I am down
and if you want some trouble, well look just what you found. It is me.
One Fifty Six Three, in the 350z. Riding down Columbia Drive, yeah you niggas remember me.
So when I pull up its a unreal crazyazyyayyayyay, if you turnt up to the max then scream yay ay yay.

[Chorus]
I go banananananana, I go crazycrazycrazy

If you know you turnt uup, say yay ay yay
