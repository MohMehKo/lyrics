[Interlude - Strap]
"What you say?"
"I said I wanna do it now, I don't wanna wait 2 hours to get you home"
"You gone swallow the bottle?"
"What?"
"Hmm?"
"Am I gone swallow the bottle?"
"Um hmm"
"Where the bottle at?"

Bottles [6x]
Models [5x]

[Chorus]
Pop bottles, take one of them hoes and tell em follow
Where the hell the waitress, tell her bring another bottle
Poured it in her mouth I said I wanna see you gargle
Then she answered back, guess what
I can swallow
She can swallow the whole bottle [4x]

[Verse 1 - Strap]
She swallow the whole bottle

If you drink champagne, watch the bottle bust
Nada [5x] you cant kiss me

Open up ya mouth, now let me see you swallow

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 - Quez]

She can swallow the whole bottle
She is freaky, she's a model
Her friend's geeky, but she swallows the whole bottle
The whole bottle

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Ali]
Well I ordered her a shot and then she said she want a bottle
So she opened up her mouth and she went gobble gobble gobble
She swallowed the whole bottle
Thats crazy, thats amazing
She swallowed the whole bottle
Her name is Stacy, she's only 18
Like damn she so young, but she so fine fine fine
She legal so I'll get it from behind hind hind
Like damn think I'm running out of time time time
Wait, can I think of one more line line line

[Chorus]
