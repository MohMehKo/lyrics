[Chorus]
I got me a college girl
She is the best girl in the world
She loves to take shots with the homie
She never leave me lonely
She's my one and only
College girl
I got me a college girl

[Quez:]
College girl I love to romance her
I remember when I went to pick her up from Savannah
She used to go to Georgia state she used to be a panther
Get her in the bed she scratched a nigger like a panther
And she takes shots with the homie
Her favorite food is pizza so she loves the peperoni
AKA so she's a sexy tenderoni
I don't fuck with other bitches cause them other hoes be phoney..
Got a good head on her shoulders
Together we'll go older
She is a modest girl but until she graduates she's a college girl

[Chorus]

I got a college lady
Born in the 80s
She is a grady baby
Graduate from Grady
That's in high school
She is in Harvard now
She is so far away now
I am sending flowers
Every time she visit
You know we are hanging out
And when I am not around
I am who she thinks about
That's my Howard girl
Checked out my spelman girl
Shawty freaks me real good
You better tell them girl
No overnight visitations
So I am sneaking in
And when I am beating in
Her room mates keep on peaking in
Class At eight
So I can't stay late
So six in the morning I'm escape
Gone.

College is where she wants to be
I got a college girl come stay with me

[Strap:]
Watching a thing it don't even matter
I made it to the top den put my baby on the ladder
Smoking and drinking just me and my baby
When I am on the road
I'll be thinking bout my baby
You say you love her
So many miles away
I wish she would never ever moved away
I gotta a shorty at UGA
Shorty's at Georgia State
Shorty in Jamaica
But no one can take her place
I love college
And college girls
So shout out to my colleges all around the world
(What you talkin' bout)
Clark Atlanta (what's up)
Savannah (what's up)
Georgia Southern (what's up)

Howard and Albany
Fuck with all my lady's
All these college girls
Man got me going crazy

[Chorus]
