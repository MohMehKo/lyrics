We're gonna party, have a good time
We're gonna live our life to the fullest
No regrets, no rewinds
Check your watch, is party time

I got ten minutes to get ready
Got not on my line, but we ain't gonna buy a new GJ
Smoke a cent that's while I rhyme
Then I put up in a six give a low have me high five
Then I pull a pole three to a let go

Party, party, party
Put your hands up and party in the room, party

I ain't gotta check my watch to know it's party time
Baby, know we party like this all the time
Drinking, looking straight like we don't lost our minds
Early in the morning is a quarter to nine
Get up, get up, cause you don't know how cool I was
It don't turn me off and not if it gives cause
Drinking all night shots shots shots
So we stay shot shot shot
Gotta prove this pass pass pass
Leave that and turn it on

Get on the floor, get turned on
Shake it once more, get fucked off
Yeah, we got these ladies taking their clothes off
We gonna party party party till it goes on

We're gonna party, have a good time
We're gonna live our life to the fullest
No regrets, no rewinds
Check your watch, is party time

I got ten minutes to get ready
Got not on my line, but we ain't gonna buy a new GJ
Smoke a cent that's while I rhyme
Then I put up in a six give a low have me high five
Then I pull a pole three to a let go

Film me and saw me gone, taking the plane away
Third player with a model, yeah, like no tomorrow
Swimming in Romania I got all my Gucci goggles

Party, party, party

Yeah, it got me shaking like a bag of peas
But it makes this fucking jump like a trampoline
Yeah, and if you're here put your hands up
Put your caps on, do a jump

What the hell is you talking about?
Man, I'm hungry as a bitch at a party at waffle house
Man, I'm getting placement, my brother in uk

What what what what
What the hell are you doing, dog?
It ain't a party like ours, if it is some, I'll ruin, yo
Twitch it all up, put a liquor in now fly
Yeah we're pretty, drunk, and we're waking up for lunch.

We're gonna party, have a good time
We're gonna live our life to the fullest
No regrets, no rewinds
