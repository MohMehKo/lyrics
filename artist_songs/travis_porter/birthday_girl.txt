Birthday girl birthday girl let me see your hands
Put it on put it on put it on my tab

Just turned 21
Time to have some fun
And we gone do it all
Cause baby you’re the birthday girl
Lil mama this ya song
So party all night long
And we gone have a ball
Shut it down on your birthday girl

Lil mama it’s ya b-day
And I ain't wit dat drama lil mama fuck what she say
Ima make it rain, cats and dogs ain’t no cliche
She say she from LA but landed in the peach state
Now that's GA
See lil mama this yo song
She got on a thong
Sippin on patron
Wondering when we going home

She just turned 21 21
Girl we about to have some fun, have some fun
We need
2 shot of that p-tron
We need
2 shots of that grey goose
We need
2 shots of that get right
We need
And 2 shots of that get loose
Then we hit the dance floor
I said you gotta work that girl
Then the DJ gave a shootout to the birthday girl

Just turned 21
Time to have some fun
And we gone do it all
Cause baby you’re the birthday girl
Lil mama this ya song
So party all night long
And we gone have a ball
Shut it down on your birthday girl

It’s ya birthday, know you want a shot
Take it back to 04′
Drop it like it’s hot
Girl you know where I’m going
Meet me at the spot
Still drinkin Ciroc
It’s damn near 4 o’clock
But Like Gucci Said
She’s only 21
So I only feed her crumbs
But I fuck her till she cums
I Love the way you dancing when you playing wit ya tongue
I’m not really romantic but you might just be the 1
Whatchu wish for
Ima give you what you need
Hit you from the back
Pullin on ya weave
And we do it this away
And do it that away
As long as you blow the candles out bc it’s ya birthday birthday

Just turned 21
Time to have some fun
And we gone do it all
Cause baby you’re the birthday girl
Lil mama this ya song
So party all night long
And we gone have a ball
Shut it down on your birthday girl

Okay you just turned 21
Let’s go live it up
Let’s go hit the club
Let’s go have some fun
We can hit up magic
We can throw some 1′s
You invite ya friends
It’s whatever she wants
How bout we go to Vegas
We gone have a ball
We gone get it poppin tomorrow forget it all
And we gone do some gamblin
We gone do some fuckin
I don’t usually do this so you should feel lucky
So quit all that fronton
Sayin you won’t do nothin
Cause I know you ready, just waiting to push ya button
So now she sucking, fuckin, trippin, wasted
Fell asleep at 6 and woke up in different locations

Just turned 21
Time to have some fun
And we gone do it all
Cause baby you’re the birthday girl
Lil mama this ya song
So party all night long
And we gone have a ball
Shut it down on your birthday girl
