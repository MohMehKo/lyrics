[Chorus]
Somebody call the ambulance
Cause shawty done shot me down
There go the sirens [x4]
Talkin bout wee who [repeat]
There go the sirens

[Quez]
Somebody call 911 lil shawty done shot me down
And I'm bangin on the ground
Cant move or make and sound
I was walkin in the club and I seen lil shawty in the crowd
And the next thing I heard was Pow
Now I'm in the emergency room
Waitin on my surgery
Shawty so fine its hurtin me
Man I think I'm worried G

And I donâ€™t think I'm gonna make
But It could of been worst
I could have seen lil shawty naked
Damn

[Chorus]

[Strap]
Wee whoo its ture she shot me
Squeeze Once squeeze twice
Damn I think you got me
Girl your love is like a siren
Contagious like a virus
And I cant even lie look in your eyes
And I've been shot by cupid 
And they say I'm stupid 
Cause I love ya 
But girl I swear nobody is above ya
Hurry call the ambulance

And then I heard that siren 
Ooowee

[Chorus]

[Ali]
Excuse doctor I think its an emergency
And hurry up because she doin it on purpose see
Nothin physical but I do need some surgery
I started flirtin and she started flirtin and we

And then we started me messin around
And she the baddest chick in the town
Here that sound?

[Chorus]
