Think first,
Hit the kush, take a drink first,
Now my problems seem worse,
Reminisce about my granddaddy in a Hearse,
Man it hurts
Dedication, determination, it all pays off,
You just gotta have patience,
And I'm a hot rapper,
That's irrelevant,
Time is a evasive when,
Two girls pregnant,
And I'm under a lot of pressure, and,
And I don't know what to do,
Momma told me, boy just be you,
And she said, handle your business, be a man,
I'm going through some shit mamma and I don't understand,
Why me? I used to think this couldn't be,
Thought that only happened on TV,
Now this shit is 3-D,
But you gotta keep your head up,
Stay down to the ground, cause that's where you came from."

"At times, shit can get a little crazy, (a lil crazy),
But you gotta keep your head up,
Just know that you're gonna make it (you're gon make it),
Even when you're fed up,
You just gotta keep your head up, (keep your head up),
You just gotta keep your head up, (keep your head up)."

"Just a couple weeks ago they locked up my little homie,
Used to laugh at a girl who try to act like she don't know me,
Since middle school, we was born ready,
Had chicks in school going faster than Tom Petty,
Or Jeff Gordon,
We used to leave the schoolyard cause it was borin,
Smoke a blunt and come right back,
See I was fallin man, I had to get back on track,
But he wasn't with it,
He was trying to get it,
Selling nicks and dimes,
Now he ain't even with it,
He found a faster way to get it,
Had a little 380 with him,
And I ain't seen my nigga since, man, damn."

[Ali:]
"Being famous was just a dream,
Everybody had my back that's what it seemed,
Making beats was my thing,
Then I started listening to Pop,
It had a nigga think that he can sing,
Now I'm laughing at this shit,
I'm all famous and shit,
I wish my pops could see this shit,
It's gonna happen one day,
I'm straight right now, cause I know."
