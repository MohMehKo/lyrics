It's our party we turn up when we want to
Codeine & molly shawty do what you want to
5 girls dancing in a motherfucking line
BBS's on my chick, got them hoe going blind
Pop that pussy for me do a trick on a dick
Make that ass talk to me while I blow a hoe's look
100 piercings on her, 100 tats on me
Could have paid lil shawty rent 2 times,
But I caught the new Louie V, get money
Shawty thick from the front, thick from the back
Bend that ass over, pop that pussy from the back
Come and get this money, act like you want it
I don't trick on pussy but I spend a couple hundred

[Verse 2:]
I train a bitch to suck your dick and take your roley off your wrist
Yeah she on that kinky shit, cocky bizness off the bitch
I pimp a bitch, a stripper bitch, I thank the lord I cop the bitch
I made 300 off the bitch, I bought the bitch a anklet
My condo your bitch furnished it, I'm always talking money bitch
It's Gucci Mane and Travis Porter, we ain't with that funny shit
Like my bitches crazy thick, she ain't gotta pay for shit
I'm far from having money problems but don't like no lazy bitch
You do a trick I throw a grip, you suck my dick I pay your rent
My dick taste just like peppermint, your boyfriend is irrelevant
The money make my pants sag, my ball stay like an elephant
It's Gucci Mane the president, the warehouse party on the bitch

[Verse 3:]
Ok, do a trick on a dick, now she nasty
20 g's on my wrist, yeah I'm flashy
8 bitches in the VIP think we need 8 more
Shawty wanna do a trick, told her ride my skateboard
Asked her what's her favorite trick, she said an Ollie
Asked her what's her favorite drug, then she told me molly
She popped one and she went crazy, pulling tricks with her friend Shelly
Start landing her friend tasty, fell in love with them big faces
Yeah, bout to throw em on the asscheeks
Told that girl to drop it low, look how she dancing
Damn we threw so many ones, we up in magic
Make that shit do a trick like it's magic

[Interlude:]
Big face hunnids, bank roll
Big face hunnids in the bank roll
