Pop a rubberband, pop a rubberband
Pop a rubberband, pop a rubberband
Shorty won't let go and she know that I'm the man
She say she wanna dance, hold a puppet in her hand
And I pop a rubberband, pop a rubberband
Pop a rubberband, pop a rubberband
And when we hit the club, we don't go there just to stand
We brought a couple grand, we gon make those bitches dance
And we pop them rubber bands

Used to jack, rollin' up a jack
Shout so deep, see her error form the front
I'm playin' with them damn, I'm playin' with, I'm a band
I pop 'er like they village, yea, I pop 'er like they village
Bring me anything, meet me girlies and we offer
Drop the chain, call me Dirty or Tiago
When my color runs in the flute, tell my bug it up
I love this stripper good, man I just can't get enough
20 G's in a rubberband hoe on a man
Then standin' on the speaker, why we do my money then?
One step, two step, three step, four
Pop pop pop that pussy, if you won't they gon

Pop a rubberband, pop a rubberband
Pop a rubberband, pop a rubberband
Shorty won't let go and she know that I'm the man
She say she wanna dance, hold a puppet in her hand
And I pop a rubberband, pop a rubberband
Pop a rubberband, pop a rubberband
And when we hit the club, we don't go there just to stand
We brought a couple grand, we gon make those bitches dance
And we pop them rubber bands

All black with some gold on
For Diablo's on the whip, get my roll on
Bad yellow bone bitch, ain't got no clothes on 'er
For a dope G bitch ain't got no doors on 'er
Pop a rubberband, bitch I do this every night
Go outside tonight, early morning catch a flight
I turn the lights off, baby welcome to the show
You ain't down to play your role but you gotta go
If you don't wanna go then baby take a shot
I know you want these rubber bands, drop it like it's hot
Yea, I'm tryna flip into a movie set
And when she see a rubberband it get her pussy wet

Pop a rubberband, pop a rubberband
Pop a rubberband, pop a rubberband
Shorty won't let go and she know that I'm the man
She say she wanna dance, hold a puppet in her hand
And I pop a rubberband, pop a rubberband
Pop a rubberband, pop a rubberband
And when we hit the club, we don't go there just to stand
We brought a couple grand, we gon make those bitches dance
And we pop them rubber bands

Look, Shorty runnin', shake that ass on me
I say cool, man I'm glad I got some cash on me
Young nigga 21, I'm a fuckin' boss
All this money that I foam could've bottle off
And y'all niggas can't afford those
No, he doin' that, his 3 or 4 clothes
Yea, and I ain't nothin' like that other man
Still lookin' polished with the hoties up in rubber bands
Spendin' money all across the world
Up the magic closet, have it with my neighbor Earl
Yea, pulled up in the new Range
No, we had to make it rain with the loose change

Pop a rubberband, pop a rubberband
Pop a rubberband, pop a rubberband
Shorty won't let go and she know that I'm the man
She say she wanna dance, hold a puppet in her hand
And I pop a rubberband, pop a rubberband
Pop a rubberband, pop a rubberband
And when we hit the club, we don't go there just to stand
We brought a couple grand, we gon make those bitches dance
And we pop them rubber bands
