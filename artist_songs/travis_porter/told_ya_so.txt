[Intro:]
I hate to tell em that I told you so uh

[Verse 1:]
Ey, life's fuckin great, I dig er I love er
Makin all this money so I'm doin for others
And how the hell we stood together 'cus nigga we brothers
And we gon ball foreva just me and my bothers
Me and my people, me and my fam
Me and this new chick, just flew her in town
Got this chick out in Vegas, do whatever I tell er
Am I gon settle down? Shit, I'm thinkin neva
Playa condos, nice whips, pretty women
I'm in love with this shit 'cus nigga we livin
Nigga we winnin, I hate to tell ya
Promise I'll never settle for failure, believe that

[Hook 1:]
All we getting is money, we been getting all our life
I love being single, I ain't lookin for no wife
I'm bout to get this cheap dog, I'm tryna get this paper
And this song right here is for them haters
I hate to tell ya
Yea, I hate to tell ya
Uh, I hate to tell em
What? I hate to tell em

[Hook 2:]
I got a bad bitch in the backseat, got a bad bitch in the front
And she'll do about anything, she'll buy whatever I want
I hate to tell em
What? I hate to tell em
That I told you so

[Verse 2:]
Bad bitch in the back, bad bitch in the front
One countin the cash, one rollin the blunt
Boy all we get is paper, wanna flip by acres
Tryna get that new house, make Oprah my neighbor
We stay kickin flava, fuck all you haters
We hear them talkin but no they won't face us
I told ya'll nigga watch this
I iced out my neck and I iced out my wrist
Leaned off my Sprite, then I Sprite up my whip
Meaning on my hip, I sank a nigga ship
And they found blue where I pipe down your bitch
You only live once, I'm a die filthy rich, why this?

[Hook 1:]
All we getting is money, we been getting all our life
I love being single, I ain't lookin for no wife
I'm bout to get this cheap dog, I'm tryna get this paper
And this song right here is for them haters
I hate to tell ya
Yea, I hate to tell ya
Uh, I hate to tell em
What? I hate to tell em

[Hook 2:]
I got a bad bitch in the backseat, got a bad bitch in the front
And she'll do about anything, she'll buy whatever I want

[Verse 3:]
Yea my niggas we get lost today
Somebody tell me what time it is
I ain't even wearin no watch today
And I swear to God these niggas won't get the best of me
And Keyshia wanna have sex with me
But I'm tryna fuck Stephanie oh yea
If that ain't privy nigga what do you call that?
If that ain't money nigga, tell em to call back
I really hate it for his lady
I hate to be doing what that nigga doing on the daily nigga
It takes a team, nigga go chase yo dreams
Cash rules everything, around me go chase the cream
Yea, a couple niggas gone and I hate to feel em
Them niggas asked me where I been and I hate to tell em

[Hook 1:]
All we getting is money, we been getting all our life
I love being single, I ain't lookin for no wife
I'm bout to get this cheap dog, I'm tryna get this paper
And this song right here is for them haters
I hate to tell ya
Yea, I hate to tell ya
Uh, I hate to tell em
What? I hate to tell em
