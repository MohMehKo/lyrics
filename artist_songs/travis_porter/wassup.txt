Nervous ass nigga, keep on watching for the cops
Keep a blue file in my socks,

[Verse 1:]
Banged up, got a big chick,
Drank more, have a lot of sip
Roll around on Pergosette
Whole pound of that purple shit
Feragamo my fashion, smoke one with young Ashton
My nigga throwin a B, ya already know what's breakin
Wassup? Wassup? What's happenin?
My plug sent me a package
I make a lot of money and I'm living like savage
Got a Audemar on my hand
Just manage your ho 10 bands
3-65 we gon hound
Any bitch out here kinda help
Grind on that sex, countin up them racks
Pound of that gas, all my rounds get cash
'Cause the big pan was the band
That D shoe was the beer
Nigga everything ain't worth my partner
Got everything for sale

[Verse 3:]
25 cameras, 25 hammers
Chilling in the hood with my hand on the hammer
East side of Atlanta, Columbia drive shoutin
Try me if you want, I bust yo head with that 40
I'm a walkin bank, you know I be kept talkin
Never saw the draw but I know how to make it profit
When I'm in the streets you never try me
When I hit the club don't check for ID
This shit here so FIE and yea we got the beach from the sea
Young niggas gon have the club on swole
Listen to my song when I fuck yo ho
Walk through the door with 2 bad hoes
I'm a young ass nigga, you a killa on the low
She gon leave the finders flow
Told the bitch to find the do
So she started questioning, you know I got the extra ho like

Wutchu wutchu wutchu know about a whole quarter block?
Pop the mollies, yea we got it, you want it comin sure
Yea them folks might circle round but this shit don't ever stop
They words blast in that water like we threw it off the dock
I just finger fucked a whole bag of that loud
Breaking all these laws, tryna make my mama proud
Me and Kwe pulled up, sure crib be town
Make yo girl say wussup
I'm a beat that pussy down
Ain't even worried bout ya'll
Ya'll clowns ain't in my sight
Me and my partners threw it out on the corner
We done worked all goddamn night
Glock 40, I ain't even finna fight
That tool make a fool think twice
Bad check make a bitch get right
Travi go the boys take flight
