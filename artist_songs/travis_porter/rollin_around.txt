[Hook:]
I'm rollin around
Just a night on the town
I'm sippin on brown, got me dancing around
Yea we smoke at the pound
Putting all for the town
I'm rollin around
Boy hoppin out that Phantom
Big rims and rollies, said nigga welcome to Atlanta
I'm rollin around
Rollin ridin down Candle
I'm squatin on them forges
Make them shorties go bananas, bananas

[Verse 1:]
Hoppin out that Phantom, sippin on that lean
Bad bitch like Ama, had to put er on the team
Pretty young thing, girl you look like a model
Diamonds in my ring and diamonds on collar
Maseratis, Ferraris, Behinas, Zebachi
Takin trips to Philps, fuck it buy now Versace
Switchin whips to whips, fin em hop in the Audi
I just flew in shorty, she came from DC
And now she blowin gas, I keep it like BP
I told er to meet me, the room on Pete street
It's cool if you keep it secret, the room is 803
Put on them Vicky Secrets, lay down just wait on me, Chi

[Hook:]
I'm rollin around
Just a night on the town
I'm sippin on brown, got me dancing around
Yea we smoke at the pound
Putting all for the town

Boy hoppin out that Phantom
Big rims and rollies, said nigga welcome to Atlanta
I'm rollin around
Rollin ridin down Candle
I'm squatin on them forges
Make them shorties go bananas, bananas

[Verse 2:]
I just picked lil shorty up, she flew in on Delta
I told er leave her bets right there, the driver man gon help ya
8 down, lil shorty fine, bad just like a stripper girl
First thing I told er, you look better than yo picture does
Yo picture does
Don't pitch a fit, let's pick a bitch and go hit the club
Gotta switch the whip, hop in the 6, turn the speakers up
Now we up in cheeta just rollin up, drink in our cup
You think it's fuck
So you know what's on my mind, right?
Pass a girl that blunt and get mine right
Then she took a shot of Patron, girl you know it's bout to be on
And I beat the pussy so good
She ain't even wanna go home

[Hook:]
I'm rollin around
Just a night on the town

Putting all for the town

Boy hoppin out that Phantom
Big rims and rollies, said nigga welcome to Atlanta
I'm rollin around
Rollin ridin down Candle
I'm squatin on them forges
Make them shorties go bananas, bananas

[Verse 3:]
I'm ridin round in my town tonight
And I'm sippin white
With a bad bitch
And she half white
And she half black
Her ass fat, she count stacks
Don't love her but she love me back
They say damn Lee, where you found that?
I met er chillin chillin chillin at the hookah bar
She was shocked 'cause she was talkin to a superstar
But wait, fast forward, had her head bangin up against the headboard
She want dick every night, she be prayin for it
She be prayin for it and I'm rollin around
I got this chick in LA, bout to fly in town
I'm gon pick er up and yes I'm gon beat er down
And damn it she a hottie
She wanna go to Follies
And yea some older molly 'cause I'm rollin around

[Hook:]
I'm rollin around

I'm rollin around
Rollin ridin down Candle
