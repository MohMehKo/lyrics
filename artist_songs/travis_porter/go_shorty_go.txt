I was walking through the crowd and I seen her with her team
I taped her on her shoulder and said girl I like your jeans
I told her go shorty shorty go shorty shorty go (go)
Go shorty shorty go shorty shorty go

She was dancing like a stripper so I had to throw some ones
She winked her eye at me and said it's time to have some fun
