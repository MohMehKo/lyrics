Welcome to my city, let's take a ride down 2805
Can't drive fast cuz the speed limit 55
And where I'm from, you gotta ride superfly
22's or better, you gotta ride superhigh
And as I ride down Peachtree
Stop and beep beep and then I hops on 20 East
Cuz that's my side of town
And every time I come around, boy we holds it down
And yeah you know we gone get it
Even if we gotta steal it, A-town be the feelin
And Ion think they really with it
But if niggas want problems, tell dem boys come get it

[Chorus]
I got my windows up, I got my top let down
I got my speakers up loud, I'm breakin the ground
Aww, you know I be reppin my town
Even when I'm outta town I'm still holdin it down
For my city [x2]
ATL hoe

[Strap]
Gone for my city, strong for my city
Niggas don't smoke nun but strong in my city
Ridin round feelin like I'm King Kong in my city
Windows down, beat up, who fuckin with me?
Nobody, my ice cold, so zero
Eastside, young nigga, neighborhood hero
Watch for potholes, ridin downtown
Whole lotta hoes, blowin by the pound
Don't wanna turn it down, write me a ticket
Reached out to wonder, diamonds glistenin
Roll my window up, and roll my indo up
Back to the condo to make some more bucks

[Chorus]
I got my windows up, I got my top let down
I got my speakers up loud, I'm breakin the ground
Aww, you know I be reppin my town
Even when I'm outta town I'm still holdin it down
For my city [x2]

[Quez]
When I'm outta town a nigga reppin and shit
We on top but they act like we second and shit
We gone rock, matterfact we gone wreck in dis bitch
And it's 2011, you respectin this shit
I'm from the eastside nigga that's the east of the A
Yeah ATL I'mma rep where I stay
Decatur where it's greater, I never been a hater
If you ain't gettin paper, sayonara see you later haaa
I'm smokin on the best weed that money can buy
Ur girlfriend and my dick are Bonnie & Clyde
So go head with yo soft ass
And better walk around with yo hallpass up in my city

[Chorus]
I got my windows up, I got my top let down
I got my speakers up loud, I'm breakin the ground
Aww, you know I be reppin my town
Even when I'm outta town I'm still holdin it down
For my city [x2]
