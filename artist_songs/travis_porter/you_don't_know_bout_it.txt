[Pre-Hook:]
Tell me what ya know bout dis, tell me what ya know bout dat
Tell me what ya know bout Phipps, tell me what ya know bout Saks
These niggas ain't got no check, them boys ain't holdin no sack
Them niggas don't know bout dis, them boys don't know bout that

[Hook:]
Hey...
You don't know bout it [x3]
Tell me what ya know bout that
You don't kno nothing [x3]
Tell me what ya know about that

[Verse 1: Strap]
Young nigga you don't know about this, young nigga you don't know about that
Spend a couple racks at Saks, do a track get it right back
Nigga you don't know nothing bout nothing, that gas I put in my blunt
Smoke a zip, take a sip, pull up, nigga I'm stuntin
Hop out, looking like money, y'all broke niggas just too funny
Can't even count up six hundred, that's a shame you a God damn dummy
Boy you know you ain't holden no stacks, boy you know you ain't holden no strap
Boy you know you ain't been in no trap, everybody know Strap

[Pre-Hook:]
Tell me what ya know bout dis, tell me what ya know bout dat
Tell me what ya know bout Phipps, tell me what ya know bout Saks
These niggas ain't got no check, them boys ain't holdin no sack
Them niggas don't know bout dis, them boys don't know bout that

[Hook:]
Hey...
You don't know bout it [x3]
Tell me what ya know bout that
You don't kno nothing [x3]
Tell me what ya know about that

[Verse 2: Ali]
Exspensive jordans and belts, I get my gucci from Phipps
Exclusive tires on the whip, they say I'm feelin myself
I'm all in the vip, I give the waitress a tip
Then I withdraw a hundred thousand and spend it all on myself
My bitch is thicker than milk, but they short as my sleeves
I've got bitches in Africa, I be all over-seas
Ain't no twenties in my pocket, all I keep is some g's
I'm a young nigga gettin it boy, who fuckin with Li

[Pre-Hook:]
Tell me what ya know bout dis, tell me what ya know bout dat
Tell me what ya know bout Phipps, tell me what ya know bout Saks
These niggas ain't got no check, them boys ain't holdin no sack
Them niggas don't know bout dis, them boys don't know bout that

[Hook:]
Hey...
You don't know bout it [x3]
Tell me what ya know bout that
You don't kno nothing [x3]
Tell me what ya know about that

[Verse 3: Quez]
Every car I'm in I'm in the back seat,
And I just tell them where to go just like a taxi
And I keep goons if you niggas try attack me,
And they just pull they pistols out, you niggas run like a track meet
But I'm always working, you can catch me Phipps plaza splurgin
So much shit, it filled up the excursion
Tried to take my bitch, too bad she said she was a virgin
Meanwhile I'm with yo bitch behind the curtain, what you know bout that

[Pre-Hook:]
Tell me what ya know bout dis, tell me what ya know bout dat
Tell me what ya know bout Phipps, tell me what ya know bout Saks
These niggas ain't got no check, them boys ain't holdin no sack
Them niggas don't know bout dis, them boys don't know bout that

[Hook:]
Hey...
You don't know bout it [x3]
Tell me what ya know bout that
You don't kno nothing [x3]
Tell me what ya know about that
