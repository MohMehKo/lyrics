Is it the way I dress my self
Is it the way I brush my hair
Is it the way I do my dance
IS it the way I carry myself

I'm a differenter er er er [x2]
You can be a differenter er er er [x2]

Flow super different
My Clothes super different
My hoes super different then yours

Shows forward killing on the road
Forward living strap a fool mr. differenter
Er er might sound like a blur
But I'm so fucking different had to add er to my word
Swimming with the fishes
Flying with the fishes
I know this shits so crazy
We so mutha fucking different

Is it the way I dress my self
Is it the way I brush my hair
Is it the way I do my dance
IS it the way I carry myself

Wake up in the mourning
No noon
Cause I was tired then a bicth
I ain't go to sleep til six
But I was drunker then mul last nigh and I feel sick
I brush my teeth and wash my face
What I gone brush my hair
White boy black boy life style
I don't really care
I hit the club with some skinnys and some flip flops
I lolli-gag on the beat no 5467

[Chorus]

Ahh shhe
