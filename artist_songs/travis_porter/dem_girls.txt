[Chorus: x2]
Play this for dem girls
Play this for dem girls
Play this for dem girls
Gettin' naked across the world

[Big Sean:]
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it with no hands
Do it how you do it when you do it when yo man
You got me I'm 'bout to lose it
Claiming you the best well you might have to show improvement
Ok how did you manage to clap it back, and land it
And keep your balance
Haven't seen that around the atlas
Let me add you to my e-mail atlas
You got my mind in a, better kush
Got it, in the attic
It's just B-I-G and Travis
Ass so big that shit is Jurassic
Do not stop with them shots, gimme

Quit talkin' I'm off it, retard, Timmy
Boooo show 'em you ain't scared
Now play this, play this, play this, could you play this for all them girls around the world

[Chorus:]
