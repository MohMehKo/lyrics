[Verse 1:]
She say she want a baller,
She say she want a baller, fucked once
Then never ever called her
She asked why, bitch I grew up on the corner
Tryina get head till I bust like the chola
I got a thing and she gonna need moms
I started this mac shit, nigga Steve Jobs
Iha, in the Porsche hit the block
Then I pull up on the porch, where they do that at
Smokin big ass philly, you gotta light it with the torch
Where yung niggas smoking at
He say he the truth but he really not
Cause the summer only time he hot
All my niggas hot, we do this and we do these hoes so scam
9 times outta 10, that mean we the only one left
Nigga think different than the impress, now say

[Hook:]
9 times outta 10, me and all my niggas known to win
Catch me whippin in the beamer or the Benz
9 times outta 10, catch me with a bad yella bitch
With a twin and a dark skin friend
9 times outta 10, I'm a make her do a back bend,
We gonn be up in this bitch till the end
9 times outta 10, all my niggas keep some rolled up
You ain't smokin till we showed up, nigga

[Verse 2:]
From ATL to Hollywod, got the hoes on molly and they rolling good
9 times outta 10 I'm rockin 8 chains,
I'm a big dog, I'm a great thang
Hoppin out the beamer, partner in the rarri
Thick bitch named Keyshia shaking her follies
And your bitch with me, half naked in the lobby
We go up to the room I blow smoke on her body
I walk it how I talk it, play it how I say it
Throw the money up and fall down on the head
9 times outta 10 kush in the win
9 times outta 10 f's on the rim
Fuck em, fuck em, fuck em, fuck em all
50 thousand in the rubber band, how we ball
Drop head motherfucker that's the ladies
Ball hard on the hoe like I'm baby

[Hook:]
9 times outta 10, me and all my niggas known to win
Catch me whippin in the beamer or the Benz
9 times outta 10, catch me with a bad yella bitch
With a twin and a dark skin friend
9 times outta 10, I'm a make her do a back bend,
We gonn be up in this bitch till the end
9 times outta 10, all my niggas keep some rolled up
You ain't smokin till we showed up, nigga

[Verse 3:]
My life is amazing, oh yes picture perfect
Young fly nigga, hoppin out of driver service
Young rich nigga, counting up a couple g's
I'm never long, keep me a couple free's
Then up the strip club, have a 3 way
Fuck it, I ain't had a half cup 10 days
9 times outta 10, I'm grinding
10 out of 10 I'm shining
9 times outta 10, I'm prolly pulling up in the Benz
If I fucked her then I prolly fucked her friends
9 times outta 10, the niggas out here know how we do it
Cause when we do it, we do it
We know it show how we do it
I count a hunned in cash, I get my money real fast
Niggas be tryina catch up, they say I'm talking too fast
Say I got too many hoes, said we got too many shows
Yeah she in love with the swag, but they in love with the flow.

[Hook:]
