[Verse 1:]
Look, I walk in, shorty start shakin
Don't know about cold but you look good naked
Bring me my ones 'cus I ain't got patience
Tryna turn up but a nigga steady weighin
Put that pussy in my face, make it worth my while
Maybe we can meet up at the after hour
After that, hit the crib, you can take a shower
After that, hit the bed, we gon fuck for hours
Got the fame and the power, the bitches and the cheddar
Nigga I'm a G and that's my favorite letter
I bet you she won't leave, that's only if you let er
I love the strip club, have to put it on my schedule

Smash on their head, who the fuck is they Texas?

Hit the club with my nigga, higher than a bit

[Verse 3:]
Okay I walked in late, 30 minutes for their calls

And you know just how I go
Baby girl go and work the pole
My paper real long and my entourage deep
I need to get them haters removed from my dick
I have to get the rollie removed from my wrist
Now I'm rockin custom shit, Loubretton kicks
Getting drunk and my niggas whilin

And I'm a throw it in the air
Pop the bottle then I pour it on her hair yea
