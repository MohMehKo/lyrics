Slow [x5]

[Ali:]
I told her cut the lights low, turn on the stereo
Take your clothes off, leave on the radio
Come sit close to me, this how it's supposed to be
We can drink a lil drank, smoke a lil weed, pop a pill
It's whatever she want it don't matter to me
She scream like... when she get on top of me
When I get it from the back, when I hit it from the side it ain't no stopping me
And she don't want him she just want me well pimp that's obviously
We doing it slow, it's early in the morning a quarter to 4
She teasin' me, teasin' me as she drop it low
Ain't tryna move fast baby let's go

[Chorus: Kelly Rowland]
Slow motion
Girl you fast why don't you give me that
Slow motion
Hop on this dick baby girl give me that
Slow, slow motion
We can go a couple rounds but we gotta slow it down

[Kelly Rowland:]
Come and tap my body, yeah my body calling
[Strap:]
I hear what it's saying by the way your body talking
[Kelly Rowland:]
When I move my body slow do it make you want me more
[Strap:]
The way you moving on that pole make me wanna break you off and ohh...
I like it like that she working her back, I don't know how to act.

I'm tryna get you outta all them clothes (all them clothes).

[Chorus: Kelly Rowland]
Slow motion
Girl you fast why don't you give me that
Slow motion
Hop on this dick baby girl give me that
Slow, slow motion
We can go a couple rounds but we gotta slow it down

[Quez:]
It's sunday night, coolin' it at home
Shawty hit my phone, said she's home alone
Told her to come on, she know I wanna...
Then I sent a deal, couple shots of patron
So my mack right she said she will go down if I act right
Who knows, she blows it down like a bag pipe
You know you a pro and that's a fact right there

And we can do it slow motion, motion
You know what I need...
And we can do it slow motion, motion
That's what I need

[Chorus: Kelly Rowland]
Slow motion
Girl you fast why don't you give me that
Slow motion
Hop on this dick baby girl give me that
Slow, slow motion
We can go a couple rounds but we gotta slow it down
