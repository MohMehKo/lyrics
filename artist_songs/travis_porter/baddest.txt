[Hook:]
She's the baddest girl I ever seen
I had to scoop her, put her on my team
It's been a couple months I made her move
Now I'm the realest nigga that she knows
I gotta head grind, uuh baby
She know I got no bread right, already
That's why we kick it so tight, ohh baby
Take our place, let us show our things
In return she give me all I need

[Verse 1:]
She the baddest bitch that I ever did see
But ever that least, she was looking for another nigga but that wasn't me
But I never did speak so I spoke
Hit her with the words that I do it
Said she wanna give me some ass
But a nigga really want that dough
God bless me, get up on that ass like a jetsky
I'm fast, I'm gone, bitch don't really wanna test me
I'm bad to the bone, had it to the girl till it's over tail
I don't wanna play it's show and tell
Baby if you show that ass
Baby girl I show the nail
And baby girl I'm so for real
You the baddest bitch I know for real
Girl you know you almost can kill

[Hook:]
She's the baddest girl I ever seen

That's why we kick it so tight, ohh baby
Take our place, let us show our things

[Verse 2:]
I like boujie women, ghetto women too
She 35, and I'm almost 22
Big house, swimming pool
On the condo, what a great view
Oh this your girl, I like her too
I can mark the test, wish y'all success
Brought 'em to the crib, made 'em cut the grass
Got 'em in the bed, I leave him in the grass
Pretty face, nice ass
She everything I want, she got me spinning cash
I flew her in, then flew her out
Flew her back in, we be fucking round

[Hook:]
She's the baddest girl I ever seen
I had to scoop her, put her on my team
It's been a couple months I made her move
Now I'm the realest nigga that she knows
I gotta head grind, uuh baby
She know I got no bread right, already
That's why we kick it so tight, ohh baby
Take our place, let us show our things
In return she give me all I need

[Verse 3:]
I got seen one in magazine
Put you on my team and show your ass to finer things
Let's go to Amsterdam I'm really living like a king
I promise every day with me it's like you're living in a dream
I drip you out in all designer things
I'm talking private jet shit, big diamond rings
She want the key to the crib and want to be my queen
She's so thick take her 10 minutes to get into them jeans
This shit crazy, asian persuasian, foreign vacations
Your body is amazing, c'mon let me taste it
If the head right, I give her er'thing tonight
Let's cut the light slow, cut up some bear white

[Hook:]
She's the baddest girl I ever seen
