[Chorus:]
[Travis Porter:]
I said I like the way she take it down low
She put her hands on her knees and grind slow
She say she workin but she get off 'round 4
I let her hit the weed, baby let yo mind go
[Tyga:]
Down low down low
I like it when she take it down low, down low
Real strippers only do it down low, down low
Baby take it off down low, down low
Then drop it to the flo'

You wanna fuck with' her you gotta bring yo A game
My portna tried to fuck her, she told him the same thang
She work at Magic City all about her change mane
She like that freaky shit so we goin do a train mane

She dancin' like she ain't never danced, and I ain't finna stop her
She get it from her momma, so momma a pussy popper
Same with' Nicole and Sasha, all of her sisters strippers
Family reunion at aunties and I'm servin all for dinner

[Chorus:]
[Travis Porter:]
I said I like the way she take it down low

Real strippers only do it down low, down low

[Tyga:]
Uh 100 rainin'
Big titty hangin'
Same ol' stripper pop that pussy on my table
I need more bottles lady,
Some Nuvo and some Rose
Young Money in this bitch go and tell the DJ
Aw, I swear she hit that pole like a field goal
And I just kicked that sex game like a nympho
She fuckin underrated, I fuck her till she fainted

One night like in Vegas, I make that bitch look famous
Uh, so let yo hair down, ready to roll
Pick you up around 4, and yo nigga ain't gotta know
We creepin' 'round here we goin' hit that corner store
Let me get that magnum on that hoe
I'm a call her what she want, that's my side bitch
Always play the game
She don't fuck promoters all them niggas lame
I take her to my kingdom, on that king mattress she lay

I'm a a Last King, put my jewels on yo face

[Chorus:]
[Travis Porter:]
I said I like the way she take it down low

Down low down low
I like it when she take it down low, down low
Real stripper only do it down low, down low

Girl you lookin' good
I love the way movin'
Bend it over hit the flo' and put your back into it
It go left cheek, right cheek Ooh that's hot she do it

I asked her what her name?
She said "boy I though you knew it"
Well it must've slipped mind
But you look willing and able
And you look like a stallion I'm a add you to my stable
She take it to the flo' she ain't coming up for air
'Cause she like it down low while she shakes her derrier

I said I like it when she droppin' it low
I told her hit me up as soon as she's ready to go
Then she said around 4, baby just let me know
You keep on starin' at me like yo ass is ready to go
Let's go shit, but that ain't it, no
That ain't all, as soon as she hit the crib
1st thing she did was drop her drawls
And yea she very pretty, met her at magic city

[Chorus:]
[Travis Porter:]

I like it when she take it down low, down low
Real stripper only do it down low, down low

Baby take it off down low, down low
