[Verse 1:]
I'm on my forth drink, she on her forth too
You feeling freaky girl, I'm feeling freaky too
Pull up in that porsche coupe, she pull up in the porsche too
Hop up girl you know we can do it in the front seat of the porsche boo
I don't drink and drive, but I will tonight
Just to get off in that woo I hope you feeling right
Ye, and I'm hoping that they hear right
You never suck no dick, but shit you will tonight
Pop this pill let's take this flight, bring some clothes let's spend the night
You like brown, you like white, fine as hell she black and white
Got her crawling all on the floor
She's screaming out daddy good Lord!

[Verse 2:]
Drinking on lean, and shawty taking shots
Call your home girl we're gonna turn it up a notch
2 bad broads, one white, one young
2 chain zone, one white, one young
Play drum so whip, dripping when I fly by
Sipping on scissors, smoking layla
When I'm up in California my lil bitch from the bay
A hood bitch run the dick every day
Got some fake tits then she moved to the A
Real big booty and she know how to shake
I'm in the strong club feeling some type of way
That ass is a 10, but that face is an A

Girl what you got on, girl you smelling good
And I know I can get down with her
She just my type 'cause she drink round liquor
Let her hit the weed now she say she feel it
Her ass looking soft baby let me feel it
Girl I'm a gonna climb on top and do a type of dance

Girl I know you fade to white

But you can't I had to let her know it
Bitch you know a nigga paranoid
