[Verse 1]
Sick, sick. 
Sick of being lonely
Tick, tick. 
Ticking like a bomb
All I want is someone to hold me, to keep me safe so I don't feel alone

Cause I'm sick sick sick. 
Sick of being lonely
The closest thing to my lips these days is lipstick and I'm sick of it
Tick, tick. 
Ticking like a bomb

[Chorus]
All of my love on the walls
Come on save. come on save me
My heart and my head are at war
Hurry baby, cause you running out of time
Tick Tock

[Verse 2]
Tired and tired. 
Tired of being lonesome
Got no more to give
Run, run.
Running from my own shadow
Got no more reason to live

Cause I'm sick sick sick. 
Sick of being lonely
The closest thing to my lips these days is lipstick and I'm sick of it
Tick, tick. 
Ticking like a bomb

[Chorus]
All of my love on the walls
Come on save. come on save me
My heart and my head are at war
Hurry baby, cause you running out of time

[Bridge]
Like a tide, lovers come and go (lovers come and go)
You be the yes and I will be the no
You burn hot and I will glow down low

Because I'm sick sick sick.
Sick of being lonely
Oh, The closest thing to my tongue these days is candy
It's driving me crazy

[Chorus]
All of my love on the walls
Come on save. come on save me
My heart and my head are at war
Hurry baby, cause you running out of time [x2]
Tick Tock.
