You say you love me
One minute
Then you're walking away
You wanna hold my hand baby, but you too scared to say
You said you love me, love me
That you need me, need me
You don’t show it, I'll know it
If falling is so easy then why am i crying
It’s not supposed to be like this
I wanna know my place
C’mon, invade my space
Wanna feel like am needed
I’m needed by you

[Chorus:]
I wanna know what it feels like to be haunted by you, Oh!
I wanna know what it feels like to be wanted by you, Oh!

You kiss me honey like you want me to stay
Love is so hard to get but so quick to throw away
You say you want me, want me
That you crave me, crave me
Then show it
I'll know it
Like a moth to a flame
It’s not a game for the same
It’s not supposed to be like this
I wanna understand
Wanna do what I can
I wanna feel like am needed
I'm needed by you

[Chorus:]
I wanna know what it feels like to be haunted by you, Oh!
I wanna know what it feels like to be wanted by you, Oh!

[Bridge:]
Just touch and go
But give me, give me
Running so fast to know it (wanting to know)
It’s not just a phase we cannot erase
What we had, what we had
(eh eh eh)

[Chorus:]
I wanna know (I wanna know) what it feels like to be haunted (I gotta know) by you, Oh!
I wanna know what it feels (I wanna know) like to be wanted (I gotta know) by you, Oh!

I wanna know what it feels like to be haunted by you, Ohhh!
