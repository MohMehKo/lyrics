Don't need nobody but you
To make my life so complete and new
You want to know if it's true
If thought of you I said silly do
So let's go

[Chorus:]
Here we go, nasty roads,
[?] to the middle while the speakers blow
Shooting me, living happily ever after.
That's right, that's right
Shoot back, relax, baby let me drive.
Show me, 'cause he's happily ever after.

It's like you don't even know
How much I care 'cause I'm always gone
Girl didn't like out here we [?]
To take you all to the great beyond, let go.

[Chorus:]
Here we go, nasty roads,
[?] to the middle while the speakers blow
Shooting me, living happily ever after.
That's right, that's right
Shoot back, relax, baby let me drive.
'Cause he's happily ever after.

Oh oh oh oh
I said baby yeah
Oh oh oh oh
Come on and take a ride with me
Oh oh oh oh
And baby oh oh oh
Oh yeah.

Come on baby
Come on, come on, come on baby
Do you wanna go?
