It's tree o'clock 
And you're still not home
You're already two hours late
I gave you the benefit of the doubt
But baby girl you always disappoint me
And lately you've been bringing it home
That smell that you're wearing is not my cologne
I put up wit it ?Rcause I love you so
But baby I just can't take it no more
You're making me say goodbye
No matter how hard I try
You've taken advantage of me
Now I don't have a choice baby
You're making me say goodbye No 
I can't take on e more lie
I love you so, I wanna stay
It hurts so bad I gotta leave
Girl I know the signals on the phone
Two if I'm home and three if I'm gone
I suspected it a year ago
I confronted you, you told me I was wrong
The other night I couldn't all asleep 
I heard you whisper his name in your dreams
What kind of man would I be to stay
There ain't no question
I gotta leave
You're making me say goodbye
No matter how hard I try
You've taken advantage of me 
Now I don't have a choice baby
You're making me say goodbye
I can't take one more lie
I love you so, I wanna stay
It hurts so bad I gotta leave
I did the best that I could do for you baby
But I guess my best wasn't good enough for you
How could you let him break up out happy home
How could you say the words ?Â°I love you?+
When you don't mean a damn thing
You're gonna reap what you sow baby
And it's gonna catch up to you
And it's gonna get next to you baby, baby
You're making me say goodbye
No matter how hard I try
You've taken advantage of me
Now I don't have a choice baby
You're making me say goodbye
I can't take one more lie
I love you so, I wanna stay 
It hurts so bad I gotta leave
