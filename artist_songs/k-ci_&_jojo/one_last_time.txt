One last time, time, time 
One last time, time, time 

Who am I to say 
The hurt you are to feel 
The one who has the broken heart, 
knows what it takes to heal 
But if you understand 
the human that I am 
then find it in your heart 
The place where lovers start 
so we can try again 

Then you can give me one last time 
to hold you and make you realize, 
The love that I have inside 
I need to have you 
One last time 
Here in my arms, 
I need you in my life 
baby one last time 

I know that I was wrong 
though I can't explain 
I never meant to break your heart 
or push your love away 
But she could never mean 
much of anything 
cause love is more than physical 
it's mental and it's spiritual and 
We are spirits needing 
One last time 
I wanna hold you and make you realize 
the love I have inside 
I've gotta have you one last time 

Here in my arms 
I need you in my life 
I was wrong 
But I wanna make it right 
just hold on 
Believe in love and stay with me tonight 
One last time 

Who am I to say, the future will reveal 

One last time, time, time 
One last time, time, time 
One last time, time, time 
One last time, time, time 
One last time, time, time 
One last time, time, time 
One last time, time, time 
One last time, time, time
