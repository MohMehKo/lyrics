Hold up, love
I know I’m not the one that you’ve been speakin’ of
Rumors start
But all the time I was the one who gave you so much love

You came along
I was already in the game before I picked you up
You broke my trust
‘Cause I thought you loved me, you just cashed me up

Now I’m through with you (you)
You don’t know what to do (to do)
Now who’s playin’ fool
You loved me now it’s ugly

‘Cause I’m not checkin’ for you (no, no, no)
Your hatin’ and it cool (its so cool)
Without me there’s no you
Now you’re through ‘cause I’m done with you

It’s me who made it easy
Now it’s you tryin’ to front and run game on me
It’s not like you can hang and sexy
‘Cause you wouldn’t be known if you didn’t know me

Hear me, mami, take it easy
If you hate JoJo, you’re hatin’ K-Ci
Speak up when they ask you, shorty
Who’s the one that made you, then say that it’s me

Now you think
Every thing that I done for you came so easy, uh
And now you seem
To be actin’ like it really was you that made me

But you don’t see
When you step out on the scene that they really see me
And no one seemed
To even really notice you ‘cause you’re not with me

Now I’m through with you (through with you)
You don’t know what to do (what to do)
Now who’s playin’ fool
You loved me now it’s ugly

‘Cause I’m not checkin’ for you (no, no, no)
Your hatin’ and it cool (said it’s all cool)
Without me there’s no you
Now you’re through ‘cause I’m done with you, you

It’s me who made it easy
Now it’s you tryin’ to front and run game on me
It’s not like you can hang and sexy
‘Cause you wouldn’t be known if you didn’t know me

Hear me, mami, take it easy
If you hate JoJo, you’re hatin’ K-Ci
Speak up when they ask you, shorty
Who’s the one that made you, then say that it’s me

It ain’t cool you 
Tryin’ play me (ooh...)
Baby, I can’t believe that I’m hearin’ ‘bout you
Just tryin’ play me (hear me)
Baby girl, you’re crazy

Baby girl
It ain’t cool you
Tryin’ play me (ooh...)
Baby, I can’t believe that I’m hearin’ ‘bout you
Just tryin’ play me
Baby girl, you’re crazy

It’s me who made it easy
Now it’s you tryin’ to front and run game on me
It’s not like you can hang and sexy
‘Cause you wouldn’t be known if you didn’t know me

Hear me, mami, take it easy
If you hate JoJo, you’re hatin’ K-Ci
Speak up when they ask you, shorty
Who’s the one that made you, then say that it’s me

It’s me who made it easy
Now it’s you tryin’ to front and run game on me
It’s not like you can hang and sexy
‘Cause you wouldn’t be known if you didn’t know me

Hear me, mami, take it easy
If you hate JoJo, you’re hatin’ K-Ci
Speak up when they ask you, shorty
Who’s the one that made you, then say that it’s me
