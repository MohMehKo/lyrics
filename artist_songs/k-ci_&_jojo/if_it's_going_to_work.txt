[Verse 1:]
I'm tellin the truth 
You don't believe a word 
How can we start over again? 
I know I lied 
You said let's try 
But still you wont let me in 
Girl it's easy to confess 
When the truth's been revealed 
And it's easy not to believe a word that I am saying 

[Chorus:]
So baby if you want me (If you really want me) 
And baby if you need me 
You gotta let me know with us there's still a chance 
(You gotta let me know) 
You gotta put the past behind us and start all over again 
I got to know If It's Going To Work 

[Verse 2:]
When circumstances don't seem right 
Why can't you just go on with the fact 
Not what you hear, but what you know 
You wanna believe the bad 
After we work it out 
Why do you bring it up again? 
I know it's gonna be so hard 
But we've got to start somewhere 

[Chorus:]
So baby if you want me 
And baby if you need me 
You gotta let me know 
With us there's still a chance 
(You gotta let me know) 
You gotta put the past behind us and start all over again 
I got to know If It's Going To Work 

[Bridge:]
I never loved no one like you 
Never, never, never, never, never baby 
It doesn't matter who you think you we're before 
I'm tryin' real hard, yes I am 
To bring back the trust 
If we don't bring it back 
There's gonna be no more us 

[Chorus:]
So baby if you want me 
And baby if you need me you gotta let me know 
With us there's still a chance 
(You gotta let me know) 
We gotta put the past behind us 
And start all over again 
I got to know If It's Going To Work 

Yea, yea, yea, yea, yea 
Baby baby 
ooh yea, 
Can I get a witness? 
Shoo doo doo doo 
It's gonna be alright 
Can I get a witness? 
I said let me know, and I need to know 
I gotta know right now baby... ooh
