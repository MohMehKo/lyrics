I don't mind what they say
I don't mind what they think
I don't care how they feel
My love for you is so real

I heard 'em say I love you too much
I heard 'em say we never fuss
I know you heard some things too
And that's what you heard
Lady, it's true
But did they say I'll never leave
Or did they say I want to be free
Don't let those fools take up your time
Just tell 'em like me
That I don't mind, I don't mind

I don't mind what they say
I don't mind what they think
I don't care how they feel
My love for you is so real

I know you heard about my past
Said I'm sorry the relationship didn't last
I was a fool, oh a big fool
But now I know what I need to do
Lift up my head and I walked that mile
I think about me, forget about my pride
I wanna know what you wanna do
Is it gonna be them or me and you, yeah

I don't mind what they say
I don't mind what they think
I don't care how they feel
My love for you is so real

Every time I see you
I'm just like a child with a brand new toy
And baby I don't mind
I don't mind, I don't mind
And baby I don't mind
I don't mind, I don't mind
And baby I don't mind (What they say)
I don't mind, I don't mind (Or what they think)
And baby I don't mind (How they feel)
I don't mind, I don't mind
You give me my energy, yeah

I don't mind what they say
I don't mind what they think
I don't care how they feel
My love for you is so real
