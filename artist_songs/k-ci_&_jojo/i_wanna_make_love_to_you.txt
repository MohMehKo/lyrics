Either you're with me or against me 
Tell me what you wanna do 
Do you wanna be with me? 
Baby, you're looking so good tonight 
I can't control myself 
I wanna take you home with me 
And lay you on your back 
Take off all your clothes 
Make love to you like you've never, ever known 
And I'mma take my time 
And give it to you right 
I wanna make love to you all night 

[1] - I just wanna make love to you 
But we got to do it right 
I just wanna make love to you 
I don't wanna fuss and fight 

I just wanna make love to you 
But we got to do it right 
I just wanna make love to you 
I don't wanna fuss and fight 

Twenty-four seven, three-sixty-five days of the year 
All I wanna do is just have your body near 
All I wanna do is do you so right 
All I wanna do is make love to you all night 

Twenty-four seven, three-sixty-five days of the year 
I'll do anything to have your body here 
Let's fly high, like the bird we call a Dove 
Let's fly high when we're makin' love 

[Repeat 1]

[JoJo] Baby, you're lookin' so good 
[Rose] You look so nice 
[JoJo] Do you wanna dance? 
[Rose] Boy, I don't mind 
[JoJo] Take my hand and follow me 
[Rose] I thought that you would never ask me 
[Both] Let's dance the night away 

[JoJo] 
You're gonna think that we are makin' love on the dancefloor 
I'm gonna do so many freaky things to you 
I'm gonna hold you so close 
Grind on you real slow 
I'm gonna make you wanna get your coat and come on home with me 

[Repeat 1]

I just wanna make love to you
