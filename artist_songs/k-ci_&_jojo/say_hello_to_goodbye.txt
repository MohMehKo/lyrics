I drive you out yo mind
I told you this before
I made you my everything but baby
You still wanted more
And now you're feeling crazy
Wanting just it let it go
And we're the reason why
Why we lose control

Always getting, no apologizing
Not realizing that we

I'm saying hello to goodbye
I don't wanna hurt no more
I'm saying hello to goodbye
Cause it ain't gonna work no more
I'm saying hello to goodbye
Goodbye, cause we cred
Let's cry, cried for the very last time
I'm saying hello to goodbye

See I appreciate what we have
Btu we went from good o worst
From better to bad
Said I'm tired, tired of wanting
I is nobody's fault
Love was leading the way
And somewhere we got lost

Always getting, no apologizing
Not realizing that we

I'm saying hello to goodbye
I don't wanna hurt no more
I'm saying hello to goodbye
Cause it ain't gonna work no more
I'm saying hello to goodbye

There's no more pretending
No more
No fairytale ending no more
But we gave it our best
But our best wasn't good enough
For love, for love
Keep it together, together
Forever and ever, forever and ever

I'm saying hello to goodbye
I don't wanna hurt no more
I'm saying hello to goodbye
Cause it ain't gonna work no more
I'm saying hello to goodbye
I'm saying hello to goodbye
I don't wanna hurt no more
I'm saying hello to goodbye
Cause it ain't gonna work no more
I'm saying hello to goodbye
