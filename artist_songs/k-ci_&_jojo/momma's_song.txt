We gonna do something a little different for y'all 
On this song because 
Me and my mama was watching the news the other day and 
We saw a lot of thangs that's goin' on in the world 
And mama just happen to just come up with some lyrics to a song 
She said "I want y'all to sing this song for me on this CD 
Cuz y'all never sang a song for me before" 
And ah, this was written by mama 
And this is what mama told me to tell y'all 
She said 

[1] - We all need that kind of love 
That special love 
The love from above 

We all need that kind of love 
That special love 
The love from above 

Look into the mirror of life 
And tell me what you see 
I see people all over the world 
Who needs to know the meaning of love 

Let me tell you what real love is all about 
If you see a man down, don't step on him 
Reach down and pick him up 
Pick him up, give him a helping hand 

[Repeat 1] 

Oh, see that mother over there 
Strugglin' to survive 
She has about five little children 
No food or clothes to put on their backs 

And what you should do 
If you see somebody like that 
You should go up to them 
Lend them a helping hand 
Offer a roof over their head 
Cuz the world is in need of love like that 

[Repeat 1 ]
[Repeat 1 while: ]
K-Ci help me, K-Ci help me 
Tell 'em where we need love 
USA, Africa, Bosnia, Ethiopia 
Korea and China, even Iraq too 
Even in Haiti 
That's what we all need 

[Repeat 1 until fade]
