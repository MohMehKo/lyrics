[* = speaking]

For your love...

*Baby I'm like a sad man
*I knew I was wrong
*But when I told you all those lies, huh
*I was a fool to make 'em
*I was a big fool
*But you got to beleive me when I said I loved you.

For you love I would do anything baby *(Everyday hasn't been sunny
(Just for your love, just for your love) without you eversince,)

For you love I would go anywhere honey,
*(Huh, but then again everyday hasn't been, cloudy either)
And just for you love I would do anything baby,
(Just for your love, just for your love)
For your love I would do anything

Listen...
I see the tears
I caused you to cry
Now I know it was a mistake
When I lied, baby
Not a day goes by
I don't wish to see your eyes
I wish I could bring you back my way
Everyday for your love I pray

For your love I would do anything baby
For your love I would go anywhere honey
And just for your your love I would do anything baby
(Just for your love, just for your love)
For your love I would do anything

Listen, listen, listen baby...
It's been awhile
Since I felt your embrace
Things are so sad in my dreams
All I see is, All I See Is Your Face, ...baby
I dream about the day you said goodbye
For your love I'll climb any mountain
It doesn't matter, how high aby

For your love I would do anything baby (Anything, babe anything baby)
For you love I would go anywhere honey (I will go anywhere)
And just for you love I would do anything baby, (You x7)
(Just for you love, just for you love)
For your love I would do anything
