They're always running around
Telling me I should be free
But there's no kind of way
I'd let them take your love from me
You see I'm not one who goes on
Speculation, hearsay, gossip
But I'm a firm believer 
In trusting, caring and loving
My love for you is so timeless
It's deeper than the depth of emotion
And every day goes by, I am finding
The reasons that I love you more and more
Now and forever will I always love you and be true
Now and forever will I keep what we have new
I will cherish, adore you
Trust and give my all to you
Now and forever will I always love you
I'm not entrusted in starting all over again
To give you up on someone's words
It's not something I'd do
You see you can tell a tree
By the fruit that it bears
And from where I stand
I see my field is yielding
Wish we could sail away on the ocean
Float away on midnight dreams
And we don't need a magic potion
So we can live inside our dreams
Now and forever will I love you and be true
Now and forever will I keep what we have new
I will cherish, adore you
Trust and give my all to you
Now and forever will I always love you
You're everything I want in a lover
You're everything I need in a friend yes you are
You're the shoulder that I'm leaning and depending on
And I could never hurt you
You're everything to me
