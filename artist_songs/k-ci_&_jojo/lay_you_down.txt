[Chorus:]
I want to lay you down
And make love
You don't have to say a word
Just get pick up
Girl it don't matter where you [?]
Cause tonight you're all mine
And it's bout time I lay you down

That dress is perfect the way I like it
The body is working I'm so excited
I'm so gone 'about what's going on
My pulse is racing
I wanna kiss you all over I'm so impatient
I want you can I tell you what I wanna do
I wanna lay you down baby

[Chorus]

Lady please let me be your collar
You wish is my command
Girl I can't get enough
You're beautiful thinking bout what I would do to you
Pull you close pull your panties down
Make you scram make your love come down
It's ok, I'm gonna work it out
As soon as they let, as soon as they lay

[Chorus]

Lay down, lay down
I won't stop until you've had enough
Lay down, lay down
I won't stop until you've had enough

[Chorus]

Lay down, lay down
I won't stop until you've had enough
Lay down, lay down
I won't stop until you've had enough
