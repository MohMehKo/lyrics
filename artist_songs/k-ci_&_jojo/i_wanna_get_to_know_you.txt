Hey pretty lady, you look so fine
I wanna hit the dance floor, if you don't mind
You're the perfect honey to come and boogie with me
I gotta get you close enough to feel your heartbeat

It's your frame that makes me lose control
It's your vibe that makes me want you more and more
Whatever it is girl, don't stop
I promise I will take you all the way to the top

[1] - I wanna get to know you baby
If it's alright
I wanna see ya move your body for me all night
Want you get down, want you get down

I wanna get to know you baby
If it's alright
I wanna see ya move your body for me all night
Want you get down, want you get down

The time is right now, no second chance
For you and I this is the last dance
I know you want me, I see it in eyes, it's true
Give me all your numbers so I can reach out and touch you

It's your frame that amkes me lose control
It's your vibe that makes me want you more and more
Whatever it is girl, don't stop

[Repeat 1]
[Repeat 1]

Everybody get your grove on in this party
Hope you ain't got nothing to do tonight
We're about to come and rock this party right

Everybody gots to boogie up in this party
Hope you ain't got nothing to do tonight
We're about to come and rock this party right

[Repeat 1 until fade]
