Everybody thinks I'm going crazy 
'Cause I don't even sleep
They say I'm lookin weak
But everything they say is true
Girl I can't make it without you
And I don't know which way to go 
Up or down, fast or slow
So I think it's time for me to go away 
And I know it sounds crazy
But your not my lady anymore
I never thought
I never thought
I'd lose my pride 
I'd lose my pride
I never thought of suicide (oh)
Until you took your love away (way)
I never thought 
I never thought
I'd lose my pride (lose my pride)
I'd lose my pride
I never thought of suicide
Until you took your love away (love away)

If I die I know I'd still look over you
Lovin you, forever and forever, no need to
Heaven is not that far away
Heaven is not to far away
I can still see your precious face
Said I might have been a fool, think this way would make you gladder
When I look down on you I can see I made you sad
It's too late for me to change it
Only God can explain it

I never thought
I never thought
I'd lose my pride
I'd lose my pride (I never thought)
I never thought of suicide
Until you took your love away (til you took my love away)
I never thought
I never thought
I'd lose my pride
I'd lose my pride
I never thought of suicide
(yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Until you took your love away

I never thought that I would feel this way
(never thought I'd feel this way, never never never never) 
I never thought anyone could turn my sun away (oh, oh, oh)
Until I fell in love with you 
(I fell in love with you baby)
How could you leave me all so smooth
Knowing girl that I'd never have you

I never thought

I'd lose my pride (I would lose my pride)
