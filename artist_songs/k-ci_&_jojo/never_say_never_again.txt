I got something to tell y'all today
Some of y'all might not like it
But then again somebody out there might just well
So let me take my time to tell you
I feel good about telling you all of this
Can I get a witness yeah, yeah

Ever since I was a baby boy
I played with ladies like my toys
Always said I would never fall in love
Don't want to care about a woman that much
Never thought I would meet a girl
Who would change my attitude now my heart doesn't care
What I had on my mind is how fast I want to come to you
Baby you're the reason why

[1] - I won't never say never again
I won't never say never again
I won't never say never
Cause lovin' you baby has taught me a lesson
No, I won't never say never again

JoJo sing it
Ooh you got me going deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper
I just want to get a little deeper with you baby, ooh
Don't stop let's go all the way, let's go all the way
I wanna get a little deeper inside of you
Baby I feel I can't get you out of my mind

[Repeat 1]

Never, never, never
Never say never again
Never, never, can I get a witness
I am so hooked on you
And I don't know what I'm gonna do
If I don't have you in my life

[Repeat 1]

My mama told me
She said K-Ci a lady should always be your precious gift
But I didn't listen to mama, I didn't listen to mama
Mama I'm sorry...

[Repeat 1]

Ooh baby, ooh baby
Out of all things that I've done to you
