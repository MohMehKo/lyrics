I'm sitting here, thinking about what you did
Trying to figure out exactly what love is, baby
See I never knew that I'd be a fool
And let you take control of my heart, oh, oh why?

Why did you hurt me?
Why am I here all alone?
Why did I trust you for so damn long?
For so damn long

How can I love again
When all the love that I have is for you?
And how can I feel again
With all the drama you put me through?
And how can I trust?
With all of the lying it's hard to do

How can I go on?
How can I ever fall in love again?
How can I ever get to feel again?
How can I ever get to trust you again?

I can't go blamin' no one but myself
I don't even want to think about loving no one else
I guarantee that you will see that this would never happen again
Not to me, not to me

Why did you hurt me? And why, am I here all alone?
Why did I trust you for so damn long?
Tell me, why did I love you? Why did we try for so damn long?
Why did I let you into my heart?

How can I love again
When all the love that I have is for you?
And how can I feel again
With all the drama you put me through?
And how can I trust?
With all of the lying it's hard to do

How can I go on?
How can I ever fall in love again?

How can I love again
When all the love that I have is for you?
And how can I feel again
With all the drama you put me through?
And how can I trust?
With all of the lying it's hard to do

How can I go on?
How can I ever fall in love again?
How can I ever get to feel again?
How can I ever get to trust you again?

Tell me how, I can't blame nobody but myself
I don't know nobody loving you but nobody else but me
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
