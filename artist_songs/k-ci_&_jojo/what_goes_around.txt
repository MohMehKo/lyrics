What goes around, comes back around
Although you travel, you just can't keep going down
What goes around, comes back around
You're gonna get back, what you gave at?

Been a long road and I'm a better man
Made so many mistakes in life, no I understand,
And I won't go, imagine the man I used to be,
The selfish thing, am I not, then I'm not [?] me

[Pre-Chorus:]
I was at cheating time, I would stay out all night
Bette had to pay you too close,
Remember when I was doing wrong,
I got attention love, I took advantage of,
Uh 'cause when you come, bring you to your knees.

[Chorus:]
What goes around, comes back around
Although you travel, you just can't keep going down
What goes around, comes back around
You're gonna get back, what you gave at?

I was alone, as a truth pretender,
When it came to breaking hearts, I was the worst of finger
But now I know, everything you plan, but you surely grow
Hardly broke in but now I understand

[Pre-Chorus:]
I was at cheating time, I would stay out all night
Bette had to pay you too close,
Remember when I was doing wrong,
I got attention love, I took advantage of,
The pain you cause when I tell you [?]

[Chorus:]
What goes around, comes back around
Although you travel, you just can't keep going down
What goes around, comes back around
You're gonna get back, what you gave at?

Oh yeah, what goes around
Just might come back to you
What goes around baby, yeah yeah

[Chorus:]
What goes around, comes back around
Although you travel, you just can't keep going down
What goes around, comes back around
You're gonna get back, what you gave at?
