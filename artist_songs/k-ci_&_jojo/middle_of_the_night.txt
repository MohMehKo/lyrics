Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yep yep
Alright
Alright, around

Feeling so good tonight
She said baby, baby are you asleep?
I said baby yes I was, I'm up now
(So what's up?)
She said baby, baby baby, I can't sleep
Then I said baby, baby baby let your head on me
We head

Middle of the night sex, middle of the night sex,
Middle of the night sex, that's middle of the night sex
It's middle of the night sex, it's middle of the night sex.

She said baby, did you make sure [?] is all sleep
I said baby, I said baby, yes I did, so you can scream
Scream loud as you want to.

My baby, would you [?] yes I'm going too deep
And baby, after this we're going back to sleep
We head

Middle of the night sex, middle of the night sex,
Middle of the night sex, that's middle of the night sex
Middle of the night sex, middle of the night sex

You don't have to worry at all, no you don't
'Cause I love you just as much as you do
What happen to middle of the night sex

Middle of the night sex, middle of the night sex,
Middle of the night sex, middle of the night sex
Middle of the night sex, middle of the night sex,
Middle of the night sex.
