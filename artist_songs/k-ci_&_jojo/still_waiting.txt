Check this out
It's Devante with the Hailey Bros.
Waitin on you baby
You know what I'm saying
Itis been a long time
They still waiting
Still waiting to get it on
Coming straight from the Dirty South

I'm telling you something,
Girl you should listen.
I'm making an offer,
But it's your decision.
The choice is yours,
It's all up to you.
So don't be a fool,
You know who to choose, girl.

Every time I see you walking by,
with the other guy,
I just wonder why
Can't that be I,
Kissing your lips and rubbing your thoghs,
Waking up every morning by your side.

Tell me why I'm still waiting for you,
To come fell ectasy,
On my knees,
Check my stees,
Let me knock it with ease.
I'm still waiting for the day,
When I can fill his space,
When I can take his place,
You can fill my face all around you, girl,
Uh-huh

I'm dreaming about you,
Scheming to catch you,
Been meaning to tell you,
I'm feening to smell you.
It's nothing that you said,
It's nothing that you did,
It's just the way you are,
Girl you flip my lid.
