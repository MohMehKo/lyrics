I don't want anybody else
If I can't be with you, I rather be by myself
And I don't want anybody else
If I can't be with you, I rather be by myself

As long as you keep doing to me
What you did to me the first day
I don't need nobody else, I don't need nobody else
I'm not looking for a girl because
I already have a woman and I, I don't need nobody else
I'm happy with my baby and my baby is you

And I don't want anybody else
If I can't be with you, I rather be by myself
And I don't want anybody else
If I can't be with you, I rather be by myself

When I called the other night, I didn't tell no lie
Baby you know you're so right, I want you to be my wife
Can I be with you, everyday I wanna be near you
And baby I won't front on you
You know that I want you baby, baby

I don't want anybody else
If I can't be with you, I rather be by myself
And I don't want anybody else
If I can't be with you, I rather by myself

Can't, can't you see that
I don't want anybody else but you and only you
Can't you see that I will never
Never love anybody else but you
I give my life to you, you're all I wanna do
Baby come home to me, I feel so happy

And I don't want anybody else
If I can't be with you, I rather be by myself
And I don't want anybody else
If I can't be with you, I rather be by myself

And I don't want anybody else
If I can't be with you, I rather be by myself
And I don't want anybody else
If I can't be with you, I rather be by myself

And I don't want anybody else
If I can't be with you, I rather be by myself
And I don't want anybody else
If I can't be with you, I rather be by myself
