I don't wanna be the one girl you keep giving excuses to
I just want it to be us girl, now and forever
And I don't know if you realize what you doing to me
If you say you love me then you say you don't
Girl, you're driving me crazy

I don't know if you're leaving today baby
I don't know if you're going to stay
I don't know if you've made up your mind
You keep saying, "Bye bye"

I don't understand, I thought you were happy here
You keep acting like you wanna go
What can I do to make you stay
To keep you from saying, "Bye bye"

You keep bringing up the past girl, holding it over my head
How can this fire last if you keep on putting it out
I'm trying my best to give you everything that I could
But you keep on pushing me away

I don't know if you're leaving today, baby
I don't know if you're going to stay
I don't know if you've made up your mind
You keep saying, "Bye bye"

I don't understand, I thought you were happy here
You keep acting like you wanna go
What can I do to make you stay
To keep you from saying, "Bye bye"

Bye, bye bye
Keep you from saying, "Bye bye"
Bye bye
Bye bye, bye bye

I don't know if you're leaving today, baby
I don't know if you're going to stay
I don't know if you've made up your mind
You keep saying, "Bye bye"

I don't understand, I thought you were happy here
You keep acting like you wanna go
What can I do to make you stay
To keep you from saying, "Bye bye"
