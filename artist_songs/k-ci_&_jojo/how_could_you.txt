All I can do
Is sit alone
In my room
Thinking about you
How could it be
That you are not here with me
When I gave you the best of me
I face each day
Without a smile
And life is so unfair
I feel like I wanna die
Cause you didn't give me
Give me a last goodbye
I've waited weeks for your call
I've waited here by the phone
But when the silence grew long
I knew that something was wrong
Right then I knew it babe
How could you do it babe
How could you tear my poor heart in two
How could you do it babe
Do it, do it, do it
How could you do it babe
Tear my poor heart in two
Ain't no more blue up in my sky
Only cloudy mornings
And these tears like rain you left behind
All of those memories
In the corners of my mind
I started looking at us
At a picture in a frame
As I start to cry
Cause I can't picture us apart
Oh my god can you help me
With this pain I'm feeling
I'm feeling deep down inside
Girl tell me it's not true
Will I have to spend the rest of my life without you
How can I get through
This pain of loosing you
