[Intro:]
A lot of imitators, perpetrators, duplicators
Kci and Jojo haters 
Copying our style for years (Ooh ooh, yeah yeah, uh huh uh huh)
A lot of imitators, perpetrators, duplicators
Kci and Jojo haters 
Copying our style for years

[Verse: 1]
Shoulda been a little while now
I think about 10 years
Been around the whole world y'all
Even heard a lot of cheers
A lot of imitators, perpetrators, duplicators
Kci and Jojo haters 
Copying our style for years
(come around here)
(but we still here, that's why we're the first ones to make you say ooh yeah)
Ooh ooh, yeah yeah, uh huh uh huh
(somebody say ooh yeah)
Ooh ooh, yeah yeah, uh huh uh huh
Ooh ooh, yeah yeah, uh huh uh huh
Ooh ooh, yeah yeah, uh huh uh huh

[Verse: 2]
It's a shame that I always 
Have to be conscious and cautious
Of every riff I make
And every song I sing
What happened to the day
When everybody was creative
Woooooh I can't go on
Feeling this way about it
You know but you won't admit it
Who was the first person to make you say ooh yeah
Ooh ooh, yeah yeah, uh huh uh huh
Ooh ooh, yeah yeah, uh huh uh huh
(you know that I know and I know that you know)
Ooh ooh, yeah yeah, uh huh uh huh
(kci was the first one to say it I was the one to duplicate it)
Ooh ooh, yeah yeah, uh huh uh huh
(all the rest of you, move on, move on)

[Bridge:]
Wave your hands in the sky (shake your hands)
(Me and Kci about to come and do it this time)
Wave them front side to side
We don't care what you hear
We're just here to make you say ooh yeah
Ooh ooh, yeah yeah, uh huh uh huh
Ooh ooh, yeah yeah, uh huh uh huh
Ooh ooh, yeah yeah, uh huh uh huh [Fade out]
