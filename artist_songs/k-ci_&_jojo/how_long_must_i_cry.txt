Baby, listen
I never meant to be so, so hard on you 
But my, my pride had me thinkin' 
Thinkin' that it was the right thing (That's right) 
But girl, I really love you 
And it's drivin' me crazy 
That you're not here to hold me anymore 

[1] - How long must I cry 
How long do I have to try 
To make happiness my friend 
And how long will it be 
Until you've come back to me 
And let me feel your love again 

I said I really love you 
And girl, I'm thinkin' of you 
There's no one in this world 
Could take the place of you 
Because you are my baby 
And you drive me crazy 
There's nothing else I would say or do 
If I don't have you back in my life 

I'm willing to live and die for you 
Baby, don't you know that my words are true 
I really love ya, still thinkin' of ya 
Can't imagine livin' life without ya 
I really miss you, no need to dis you
Can't live another day without you 
And everything I said to you, baby it's true 
I do love you, baby
