mmmmmm
mmmmmm
listen baby aa
listen
like a rainbow after the rain
like a cool summer rain
like a flower growing by the spring
in the middle of the desert
your my oasis
when I'm tired and thirsty yes you are
you fill me up till I get enough
your like dew drops on my face baby you gotta shake it

I just cant find the words to show you how much
I really love you more
there is no words to touch the thought of losing you
makes me wanna cry everydays a brand new day

like an early morning sunrise
oh baby your full of surprises
and if it ain't with you
I'm so glad God gave me you
and if I had to change one thing about you baby
I wouldn't change a thing
don't you know that I'd give my life to protect you
cause you brought me my dignity

I just can't find the words to show you how much
I really love you more
there is no words to touch the thought of losing you
makes me wanna cry
everydays a brand new day 

oooo yeaaaaa a a
I,I,I,I just can't find the words to show you how much
I really love you more
there is no words to touch the thought of losing you
makes me wanna cry
everydays a brand new day

oooooo oooooo

dont ever wanna lose your love nooooo
heyyy hey heyyy
