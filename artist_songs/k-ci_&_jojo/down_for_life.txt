I’ve been lookin’ at a photograph of the time 
When life was so much simpler 
(Ooh, yeah, yeah) Oh (Ooh, yeah, yeah), uh-huh 
(Ooh, yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah) 

Didn’t have a lot of things in life, wasn’t much 
But we sure had some fun 
(Yeah, yeah) Yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah) 
(Yeah, yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah) 

Lookin’ back on things, you appreciate every day 
The joy and the pain and the laughter 
(Ooh, yeah, yeah) Oh (Ooh, yeah, yeah), huh 
(Ooh, yeah) That’s right (Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah) 
I kinda make you wish that we were still in love, 
love, love 

So what, what I’m tryin’ to say to you 
Is that I’m still in love with you 
And I want a second try 
And what, and what I wanna hear from you 
Is that you feel the same way too 
And that you’re down with me 
You’re down with me 
You’re down with me for life 
(Ooh, yeah, yeah, ooh, yeah, yeah) 
You’re down with me for me 

Oh, yeah 
Yeah...ooh... 

I’ve been thinkin’ ‘bout some arguments that we had 
That now seem, oh, so petty 
(Ooh, yeah, yeah) Yeah, yeah (Ooh, yeah, yeah), oh, oh 
(Ooh, yeah) Yeah (Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah) 

Lookin’ back on things, it makes you feel kind of dumb 
We wasted so much time 
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) Baby, yeah 
(Yeah, yeah) Oh, yeah (Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah) 

Look around, you must appreciate everything 
Our lives are full of blessings 
(Ooh, yeah, yeah, ooh, yeah, yeah), Yeah, yeah 
(Ooh, yeah) Oh, love, yeah (Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah) 
Kinda makes you wanna go back and get it 

What, what I’m tryin’ to say to you {What I’m tryin’ to say to you} 
Is that I’m still in love with you {I’m still in love with you} 
And I want a second try {Yeah...} 
And what {What}, and what I wanna hear from you {Ooh...} 
Is that you feel the same way too {Do you feel the same way too} 
And that you’re down with me {Yeah...yeah...} 
You’re down with me 
You’re down with me for me for life {Are you down with me} 
(Ooh, yeah, yeah) Ooh, yeah (Ooh, yeah, yeah), yeah, yeah 
You’re down with me for me 

I wanna write a brand new song 
‘Bout you and I 
And how we got through all of the storms 
And we survived 
Yeah, we made things right and what 

What, what I’m tryin’ to say to you {What I’m tryin’ to say} 
Is that I’m still in love with you {I’m still in love with you} 
And I want a second try {I want a second try} 
And what {Yeah}, and what I wanna hear from you {I wanna hear} 
Is that you feel the same way too {Do you feel thesame way} 
And that you’re down with me {Down with me} 
You’re down with me {You’re down with me} 
You’re down with me for me for life {For life} 
(Ooh, yeah, yeah) Yeah (Ooh, yeah, yeah), oh, yeah 
You’re down with me for me {Are you down for me} 
(Ooh, yeah, yeah) Ooh, yeah (Ooh, yeah, yeah), ooh,yeah, yeah, yeah 
Said you’re down with me for life 
Ooh, yeah, yeah, ooh, yeah, yeah, ooh, yeah 
You’re down with me for life 
Ooh, yeah, yeah, ooh, yeah, yeah, ooh, yeah 
I said you’re down with me for life
