How is it that I love yo
But wanna only for one day
Be that as it may
Believe me when I say
I love to love you baby
Respecting how I feel
To be human nature
Cause I know you [?]

That's why I play it cool
That's why, never asked about you
She never ever, she never, she never ever
She never asked about you

And they say don't ask don't tell
She ain't going nowhere
And I ain't going nowhere
Even though we're going nowhere fast
And they say don't ask don't tell
She ain't going nowhere
And I ain't going nowhere
And thought she don't ask I don't tell

Now I'm a adjust to how I plan to be
Baby girl you gotta believe
But it don't matter now cause
How it worked out, we were doing the same
And I never lied o you
I never felt the need
And went here to give
Cause you never tripped
This is how it had to be

That's why I never called your phone
That's why you neevr called my home
I let you do you
You let me do me we both know

And they say don't ask don't tell
She ain't going nowhere
And I ain't going nowhere
Even though we're going nowhere fast
And they say don't ask don't tell
She ain't going nowhere
And I ain't going nowhere
And thought she don't ask I don't tell

One day baby won't be a thing
You made me'put a ring on her finger
Girl you can see it wouldn't be grand
Btu until that day
You know what they say

And they say don't ask don't tell
She ain't going nowhere
And I ain't going nowhere
Even though we're going nowhere fast
And they say don't ask don't tell
She ain't going nowhere
And I ain't going nowhere
And thought she don't ask I don't tell

And they say don't ask don't tell
She ain't going nowhere
And I ain't going nowhere
Even though we're going nowhere fast
And they say don't ask don't tell
She ain't going nowhere
And I ain't going nowhere
And thought she don't ask I don't tell
