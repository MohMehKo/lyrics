Wish that I could have you in my space
Wish that I could kiss and caress your face
How is it that I love you and I don't even know you?
Did you plant a seed inside of me when you said, "Hello"?
Hello darlin', hello sweetheart
She said, "I'm lost and I don't know my way around"
She said, "Hello darlin', hello sweetheart
Can you please show me which way to go?"
She said, "Please show me which way to go"
If I changed my look would I have a chance
Or does it seem I'm used to only one night stands?
And my idea of romance is nothing more
than a kiss in the wind
Never could understand anything about
love till she said, "Hello"
Hello darlin', hello sweetheart
She said, "I'm lost and I don't know my way around"
She said, "Hello darlin', hello sweetheart
Can you please show me which way to go?"
She said, "Please show me which way to go"
Notice me right before your eyes
Wanting you, hidden love by surprise
Left undone, I cant give up until we're one, oh
Notice me right before your eyes
Wanting you, hidden love
Left undone, I cant give up, I can't give up until we're one, oh
Hello darlin', hello sweetheart
She said, "I'm lost and I don't know my way around"
She said, "Hello darlin', hello sweetheart
Can you please show me which way to go?"
She said, "Please show me which way to go"
Hello darlin', hello sweetheart
She said, "I'm lost and I don't know my way around"
She said, "Hello darlin', hello sweetheart
Can you please show me which way to go?"
She said, "Please show me which way to go"
Hello darlin', hello sweetheart
