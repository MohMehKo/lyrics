[Chorus:]
If it's feeling good to ya, say yes
If it's feeling good to ya, say yes
If it's feeling good to ya, say yes
If it's not feeling good, then say no
If it's feeling good to ya, say yes
If it's feeling good to ya, say yes
If it's feeling good to ya, say yes
If it's not feeling good, then say no

Listen, tonight it's not about me, it's you
Whatever you wanna do
Your wish is my command
(Your wish is my, your wish is my command)
The task, the task is out of bounds
Don't wanna stop until I hear the sound
The one that let's me know
I got you in the pleasure zone

[Chorus]

JoJo, JoJo take the time and sing it
Baby I like everything you do
I'm excited by the way you move
I'm excited by the way you touch me all over
I love the way you scream my name
When you start to cream
I love the way you look at me
When we're making love

[Chorus]

Baby if it's feeling real good to you
Baby don't hide it, don't fight it
If it's feeling real good to you
Baby don't hide it, don't fight it
If it's feeling real good to you
Baby don't hide it, don't fight it
If it's feeling real good to you
Baby don't hide it, don't fight it
Ooh oh, say yeah

[Repeat Chorus until fade]
