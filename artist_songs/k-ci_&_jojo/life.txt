Just like a birdie 
I just wanna fly free 
And own a piece of land 
Somewhere, somewhere off in the country 
Oh, oh yeah, listen 

Temperature's like a hundred degrees 
Like I got chains on me 
Blackmail and a family of three 
Been right on my destiny 
Rake it out fly way 
Cuz it's too much for the man 
Shouldn'ta gone down this way 
What happened to my master plan 
Cuz I can't figure out 
I coulda been a love child 
Shouldn'ta gone down this way 
Tell me, how did I get life? 

[1] - Life, life 
Life, life 
Life, life 
Life, life 

Oh, somebody done done me wrong (Done me wrong) 
My eyes to the ceiling all night long (All night long) 
Time is slippin' away from me (Away from me) 
And it ain't no tellin' when I get home 
I gotta get home, yeah 

Just about to see the dollar sign, 
thats close to a piece of mind 
and everything was about to be fine
So tell me, so how'd I get life? 

[Repeat 1]

Everything that I hoped for is gone now 
Buried in the ground 
Hopes and dreams and all those things 
I'll never see, said I'll never see 
(Somebody gave me life) 

[Repeat 1 until fade]
