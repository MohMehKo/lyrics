That you're so special?

Lady, that's what you are to me, special

When I wake up, I feel brand new
So renewed
When I wake up, I feel like singing
La da da de da

Clap my hands, reminisce on your romancing

Love the way you take good care of me
Girl, it's so, so sweet to me, yeah

I'm so glad I can depend on you
