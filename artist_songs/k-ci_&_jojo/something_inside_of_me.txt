If you should ever go blind, 
I promise I'll be your eyes.
I pledge of allegiance and die right by your side. 
Because I love you so much.

And I love you with my life my life girl

I feel it now more than ever before. 
It's really too hard to ignore. 
I walk in my dreams, and the wind blows you sit inside of me. 
Won't be afraid to love as long as you let me into your heart. 
And be in a life together and share the joy of children forever.

Something inside of me. 
That I want the world to see. 
There will always be the space in my soul. 
Until you fill this emptiness inside of me. 
Inside of me.

My friend, the one who knows my passion. 
I can hardly look in your eyes. 
It takes my breath with just the simplest reaction. 
And you should stop thinking about it and just let it start. 
And girl a life together and share the joy of children forever.

Something inside of me. 
That I want the world to see. 
There will always be the space in my soul. 
Until you fill this emptiness inside of me. 
Inside of me. 

Why deep in love of you like I do. 
Place your hand on my heart. 
I know it beats for you. 
Said I know I won't have a world without you. 
I said my life is so incomplete. 
Until I see you. 

Something inside of me. 
That I want the world to see. 
There will always be the space in my soul. 
Until you fill this emptiness inside of me. 
Inside of me.

Something inside of me. 
That I want the world to see. 
There will always be the space in my soul. 
Until you fill this emptiness inside of me. 
Inside of me.
