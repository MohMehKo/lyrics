Love is truly something
And it's the one thing we can't live without
Makes you think, you're invincible
Makes your heart feel so unbreakable
But you know love can hurt

So love me carefully
Just be true to me
Love me honestly
'Cause we know sometimes
Love can be done so painfully
So at the end of the day
All I want is you to love me
Carefully

Mine past brought a ending
Didn't think I'd ever love again
Then you came in my life
And you made everything seem right
So this time around, I'm asking and beggin' you please

Love me carefully
Just be true to me
Love me honestly
'Cause we know sometimes
Love can be done so painfully
So at the end of the day
All I want is you to love me

Two hearts sharing something
So incredible, so unpredictable
I'll take care of you
So take care of me
I'll be there for you
You be there for me
Then we can love each other faithfully
Oh, so carefully

Love me carefully
Just be true to me
Love me honestly
'Cause we know sometimes
Love can be done so painfully
So at the end of the day
All I want is you to love me
Carefully

Love me
Love me
But we know, oh
Sometimes love can be done so painfully
At the end of the day for the rest of my life
All I want is for you to love me carefully, oh, oh
Carefully, baby
