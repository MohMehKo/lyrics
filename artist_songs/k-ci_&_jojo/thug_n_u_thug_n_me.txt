[Tupac]
By age 13 I was buckwild
Good in my knucklegame
Made it through a tough childhood
Never be the same
Walked in my daddy's shoes
No time to be a peaceful man
Just shatter fools
That's 'til I put my eyes on you
Goddamn sweetheart
You got some thighs on you
Now I can't wait to get you home
Get you all alone 
In my bedroom
Baby can we bone and get it on?
Tell me lady how you like me
And if you want it harder, baby
Come and bite me
But do it lightly
Cuz that excites me
The lady bite 
And if you lick me right
I'll do it all night
Only got fucked by a drug dealer
Never felt the real 
passion of a thug nigga
Though I like the way you scream when you lovin' me
I'm goin deep 
It's the thug in me
So whatcha sayin, girl?

[Chorus]
Thug nigga like me
Need a thug lady like you
I got alotta thug in me (In me)
That I wanna put in you (Put in you)

Thug nigga like me
Need a thug lady like you
I got alotta thug in me
That I wanna give to you, girl

[K-Ci]
Woke up this mornin'
Feelin' kinda horny
I want you to come over
To get some of this thug love
Tell me how you want it, girl
Tell me how you like it, girl
Tell me do you need it, girl
Don't try to fight it
Come on

[Chorus]
Thug nigga like me
Need a thug lady like you
I got alotta thug in me (In me)
That I wanna put in you (Put in you)

Thug nigga like me
Need a thug lady like you
I got alotta thug in me
That I wanna give to you, girl

[K-Ci]
How do you want it? (How do you want it?)
I said toss it up (Toss it up) 
Let me be your dentist (Be your dentist)
Let me floss it up (Floss it up)
Tell me how you want it (Want it)
Tell me how you need it (Need it)
Tell me how you like it (Like it)
Don't try to fight it (Fight it)

[Chorus]
Thug nigga like me
Need a thug lady like you
I got alotta thug in me (In me)
That I wanna put in you (Put in you)

Thug nigga like me

Moan baby when we bone/It's on
It's so strong niggas in the next room will come
I got your head swinging
Tongue kissing
As I hit it from the back
With the bed ringing
Give me space
As I lick your face
Stick the place
Sychronized so I grind
When they kick the bass
Love fucking in the mornin'
I get you wet, bust a sweat
Then I'm gone
Left you on your own, girl
Tell me what you feel like
Blindfolded I'm cold do it real nice
That's if it feel right
Maybe it's the thug in me
I pull your hair
While we fucking in the chair
When you loving me
Up against the wall
You can have it all
Just try 
Bet my kiss can get you high
Don't pass by
Grab me by my nuts
When I'm loving you
Now open up and let me put the thug in you

[Chorus]
Thug nigga like me
Need a thug lady like you
I got alotta thug in me (In me)
That I wanna put in you (Put in you)
Thug nigga like me
Need a thug lady like you
I got alotta thug in me
That I wanna give to you, girl
