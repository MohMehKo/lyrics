How many times you're gonna let him use you 
You'd think that you would know by now 
How could you let him trest you so bad 
How many times will you let him break your heart 
I heard he lied to you 
I heard your love he
abused/don't say it isn't so 
I see it in your eyes 
It's something you can't hide 
How many times you're gonna let him use you
You'd think you would know by now 
How could you let him treat you so bad 
How many times will you, let him break your heart 
He gives you lonely nights 
And he can hear you cry 
And love he denies 
He's never gonna change 
He just can't accept the blame 
How many times are you gonna let him abuse you 
You'd think that you would know by now 
How could you let him treat you so bad
How many times will you, let him break your heart 
Girl dry your eyes 
Get up off your face 
Don't be ashames. Find someone else new 
Someone who'll appreciate you 
Always love you 
How many times will he break your heart 
And I hope that you 
Feel the same way too
Yes I pray that you 
Do love me too.
