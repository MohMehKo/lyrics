We fell this time
With a dying grace
Though we're malleable beings,
Not enough, it seems

And don't lay tired
Knew we both would break
Though we're malleable beings
Not enough, it seems

And maybe were wrong to let it go
Maybe we were wrong to keep it so long
We were only dust and fragile clay
Flying far, miles away

We'll close our eyes
And erase our minds
Though we're malleable beings,
Not enough, it seems

And don't lay tired
Knew we both would break
Though we're malleable beings,
Not enough, it seems

And maybe were wrong to let it go
Maybe we were wrong to keep it so long
We were only dust and fragile clay
Flying far, miles away

And maybe were wrong to let it go
Maybe we were wrong to keep it so long
We were only dust and fragile clay
Flying far, miles away
