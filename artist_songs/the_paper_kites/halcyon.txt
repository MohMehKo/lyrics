You're free
A lover sinking in the sea
And we
Will let the water fill our lungs
And sleep

Love, we go down, we go down
Breathe, it's over now, over now
We can love, we can love
We can love, we can love
And the birds will sing our song in Halcyon

You're free
A love is coming home to me
The sea
Will pull our bodies down into the deep

Love, we go down, we go down
Breathe, it's over now, over now
We can love, we can love
We can love, we can love
And the birds will sing out song in Halcyon
And the birds will sing out song

The birds will all sing out
The birds will all sing out
The birds will sing out song
The birds will all sing out

We can love, we can love
We can love, we can love
And the birds will sing out song in Halcyon
