Don't let this unwind
You know we say it all the time
You've got a fair and fragile mind in your way

It's a saving king of face
Cause it holds me in my place
And there's no one I could take over you

Til I've faded out of sight
All my days and nights
You never leave my mind

Never did I find all the answers I've untied
But then you always pushed the light in your way
And your voice was trembling
At the thought of you couldn't win
But it's the only race I'm in
Running strong

Til you did I faded out of site
All my days and nights
You never leave my mind
And I know it's nothing new
Turn me black and blue
Holes let in the light
