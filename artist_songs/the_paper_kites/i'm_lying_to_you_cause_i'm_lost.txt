Shaking in the evening sun 
Counting all the times I run
Trying to be honest
Selfish from a point of view
How'd it get away from me?
Held up in the old Q.C
Watching out the window
Crying in my hotel room

Oh I'll do anything that you want
Except what you're wanting from me

I'm lying to you cause I'm lost
Lying to you cause I'm lost
Lying to you cause I'm lost

My mother seems to know it all
Sensed it from a distant call
How's she so objective?
Tell me how you really feel
And I was once a maker of my time
A celebrated man of mind 
Always feels a dream until the real sets in

Oh I'll be anything
Except what you want me to be

I'm lying to you cause I'm lost
Lying to you cause I'm lost
Lying to you cause I'm lost
So tell me darling what's it cost
When I'm lying to you cause I'm lost?
Lying to you cause I'm lost
I'm lost, I'm lost

I'll be anything
I'll be anything
Except what you want me to be
