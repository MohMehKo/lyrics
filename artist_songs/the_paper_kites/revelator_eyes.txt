Branded on fire
Sure in your love
Chasing a light in a locked door
And I do want it, want it for a peace of mind
Want it tonight
It's so right, so right, so right

Tell me when you let go
You can let it right in
I don't like the way you
Speak like you're tied up
You can say what you want but I'm giving it a chance
You can say what you want but I'm giving it a chance

Give me little reason to refuse my centre
Shifting in with feelings of a sweet surrender
I can feel it I can feel it alone
And I know why I can see it show
In your revelator eyes
In your revelator eyes

Stand on your side
Won't give it up
Take the desire in you I saw
And I do want it, want it for a peace of mind
Want it tonight
It's so right, so right, so right

I can see you lie low
Keeping to your hiding
Call it reaction
To your denying 
You can say what you want but I'm giving it a chance
You can say what you want but I'm giving it a chance

Give me little reason to refuse my centre
Shifting in with feelings of a sweet surrender
I can feel it I can feel it alone
And I know why honey it won't go
In your revelator eyes
In your revelator eyes
In your revelator eyes
In your revelator eyes
