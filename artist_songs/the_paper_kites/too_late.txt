Magnetic, you're pulling me in with the words you don't say
Cinematic, this chemistry coming through
You're always in my head
Branding your fire on my lips
But this still won't work, no

No love you have come too late
No love you have come too late

Such darkness
But I know your face cause I learned it as if I was blind
In the moment
I feel like I am and I hate that I know it so well
You're always in my head
Searing your thoughts in to my skin
But this still won't work, no
