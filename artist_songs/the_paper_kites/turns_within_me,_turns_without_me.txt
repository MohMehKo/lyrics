Oh lover
I don't know a thing or two
And it never sounded like I thought it would
When I spoke it to myself
Oh lover
I'm still a stranger to you so
When you think about your mother
Could you say that any other
Loved you that long? 

And you'll keep me settled for a while I know my love
Just let me waste a little time
It turns within me
It turns without me 
And oh it turns me round, round, round

Oh dreamer
I've got to let some of you be
Cause I think I've found a turbulent
Solitary citizen like me
And oh lover
You've got a power on me now
It's the kind that brings me to my knees
Alchemizes libertines 
And steals you from yourself 

And you'll keep me settled for a while I know my love
Just let me waste a little time
It turns within me
It turns without me 
And oh it turns me round, round, round
