Bring me out with your loving
It's been a long time waiting I know
Keep in my eyes, still by-and-by
No I never heard a sound
Never heard a song
I said mmm all the day long

Tell me how do I answer?
Walk the green line right to your door
Maybe with age comes better days
Will we ever know its right?
Ever feel it's wrong?
I said mmm all the day long

Will it grow, is it passing?
Hard to say and hard to ignore
Still you I find, most of the time
And you're rolling in my head
Rolling in my song
I said mmm all the day long
