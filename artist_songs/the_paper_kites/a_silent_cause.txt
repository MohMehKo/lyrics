I heard that you're moving away
Fumbled in my pockets for a final word
And I tell you 'Don't be late'
Smile when you tell me you wont
Shuffle your feet and you don't
Want to read between the air of silence
Then the rain begins

I don't want to love you
I want to learn you
But I'd love to know you well

So long to your family home
I wonder if you'll ever get that feeling back?
Your family home
Covered my eyes with your hands
Walked me through all of your plans
I told you I could see it all
But all I saw was you
Through the space in your fingers 

I don't want to love you
I want to learn you
But I'd love to know you well

You say all the people you know
All are slowly dying from a silent cause
From their quiet desperations
I walk you home in the rain
Pass by the yellow line train
Thought that I was different when you looked at me
But this quiet desperation is killing me too
Killing me too

I don't want to love you
I want to learn you
But I'd love to know you well
