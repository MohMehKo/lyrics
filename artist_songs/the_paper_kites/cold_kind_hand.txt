Hold the ties that you're given
Validate my time
Spent defining your rhythm
Spent defending mine

And I feel like I'm calling for an answer
And the reason is waiting for a change
Move with it, take me as your comfort
Now I plead for love
With a cold kind hand

Overthrow indecision
Lacerate your lie
Up, around is your vision
And I know my pride

Won't you hear when I'm calling for an answer?
With the season it's begging for a change
Move with it, take me as your comfort
Now I plead for love
With a cold kind hand

Running to crawl
Hold any motion at all
And I take it knowing is more than you're giving
Taste you like I want to
Like I want you now

Hold the ties that you're given
Validate my time
Spent defining your rhythm
Spent defending mine

And I feel like I'm calling for an answer
And the reason is waiting for a change
Move with it, take me as your comfort
Plead for love with a cold kind hand
With a cold kind hand
With a cold kind hand
With a cold kind hand

Taste you like I want to
Take me like I want you now
