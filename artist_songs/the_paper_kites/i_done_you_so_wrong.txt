You ask me, and I'll tell
Never walked such a desolate hell
But my holding is still strong
And I know that I done you so wrong
When you go away, you're still in my, still in my head

My waver, my foe,
In the morning I let it all go
But I'm needing, and I'm cold
Don't want that we'll never grow old
When you go away, you're still in my, still in my head

Don't give up, don't give up
Weather me
Don't smooth the rough, don't smooth the rough
Weather me

I feel it and I know
It runs deeper than ever I show
We walk even, we walk far
Keep me close, keep me safe from harm
When you go away, you're still in my, still in my head

Don't give up, don't give up
Weather me
Don't smooth the rough, don't smooth the rough
Weather me
