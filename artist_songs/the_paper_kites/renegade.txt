Had a dream that I sent for your love in the morning
And you came to me at about a quarter to three
Said I didn't look like I used to look and man I do not know your face
And I woke to discover that the things that you said
Were true to me in some kind of way

So I stared down the figure in the bathroom mirror
Took the razor in my hand
Now I could draw a line or I could cut my hair
But it don't change the way I am

Cause I'm a part of the world I live in now
Only set apart from the world I live in now
Ghost of a renegade 

San Marino sun took me in, it eclipsed me
And the world it was vacant like I'd never seen
And once I walked the rhythm in my own damn way 
Part of the evolving age
But I heard the warning from that young mans lips
And he said that times would change
