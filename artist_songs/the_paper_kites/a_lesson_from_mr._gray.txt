Now, I could go
I feel like it any time
I'm walking out of line,
And I know it

Diffused, controlled,
So easy to compromise
My thoughts, and the way I talk,
And the way I move

Oh you, and me,
We're shifting eternally
A lesson from Mr. Gray,
And I know it

And I don't mind
If you let me stretch my mind
'Cause just seeing how it's been being
It's just a matter of years

Feel the vital signs
But I know it's time
Take my desire

This time you know
That it's taking its toll
The picture paints it out,
Can you see it?

Alive and dead,
I sicken in my bed
I'm dying of a lack of trying
What are the calls?

Feel the vital signs
But I know it's time
Take my desire
And I see,
it never ended quite
Losing my mind
Take my desire
