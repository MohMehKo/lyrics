Here I know I'll stand
Gravitate that way
What else can I say?

We're where two will be
Raise me and I'll sing
I know you, I know me

See resistancy
Oh, I'm lost, wearing through
We move with urgency
Oh, I'm lost where I'm new

Do I not forgo
Any love you know?
How else can I show?

Builder incomplete
Turning in my sleep
You I long to keep

See resistancy
Oh, I'm lost wearing through
We move with urgency
Oh, I'm lost where I'm new

We're where two will be
Raise me and I'll sing
I know you, I know me
