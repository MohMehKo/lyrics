Well there's a stranger that I keep in my room
And it poses a question of the things that I don't want to do
But there's a hole at work asleep in the night
And it raises my glass to all the things that I don't want to deny
Sleeping in a bed I want to last for more
And I've been calling in my dreams for other things
And I don't even know why

Something's happening to me my love
Like I woke up from a dream only to find
That I still hadn't woke up

Oh and it's just your sweet love gone
Oh it's just your sweet love gone
And I've gotta find another way to go about it now

I'm disillusioned by the cinema view
And it plays like a song on repeat
And says it's better than you
But still it holds me like a grip on my mind
And I can't shake the feeling to wonder
Like there's something to find
But it's creeping in my head
That I've been feeding a lie
And either way you make a call
You've gotta live or you've gotta try

Misdirection always leaves me a mark
Like I fell in to a crowd all going different ways
And pulled me apart 

Oh and it's just your sweet love gone
Oh it's just your sweet love gone
And I've gotta find a different way to go about it
To keep it around now

Something's happening to me my love
Like I woke up from a dream only to find
That I still hadn't woke up â€“ I was asleep
And all the things that weren't right
Well they were still going on
I can't tell you it's right
When it's wrong 

Oh and it's just your sweet love gone
Oh it's just your sweet love gone, it's gone
And I've gotta find a different way to go about it
To keep it around now
