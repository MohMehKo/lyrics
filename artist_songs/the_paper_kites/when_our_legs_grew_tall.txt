In the spring we wake
Where all dreams we make
There's a place we once knew
Something old, something true
To just spend all day
Going back that way
Now the days go so fast
Give me time, give me past

And I know
It's been so long
Since we were children of the sun
So we go..

Lay our heads down on the green
Like when we were young
See the world up from the trees
Like when we were young
Memories, memories

How I'd love to find
That old place of mine
Feel the afternoon glow
Something warm, something slow
But our minds got small
When our legs grew tall
And our eyes don't see right
Give me soul, give me sight

And I know
It's been so long
Since we were children of the sun
So we go..

Lay our heads down on the green
Like when we were young
See the world up from the trees
Like when we were young
Memories, memories

On the green
On the green
