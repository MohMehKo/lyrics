[Verse 1 - Hurricane:]
[?] is part of the planet but I’m a sick individual that’ll take her to the land of Oz
Brain sicker than a book of the bumblebee
Give her sodomy then get the tools outta garage
So da ba sheka neda deka
Better get it cus I’m thinkin'
I better come get it I can suffer 'bout as quick-a-ly but I sped it
To do it to her leave a better predicament when they die
Gropin' that nigga was on a try, give a midwest high
Better get out the woods or (descend the summers?)
You can clearly hear me comin'
Adrenaline steady runnin'
I’m runnin', fiendin' for somethin
I’m about to get it now
I was overlooked by the sucker with a bat
Never fuck with the cat or the cow
Probalé labalé high psychology
Come on they gotta be get a padded room or a straitjacket
I don’t know man I think I’m
(Insane)

[Verse 2 - Mr. Dos Muchos:]
Anybody tryna be the one to come and get it
Then they betta be upset
That a ton of us are ready
Hit the fuck up outta intricate and every nigga really livin'
I don’t wanna be the person that you’re hopin' will give pity
Cus they’re lookin' at 'em differently come across a menace
I’m invincible, pretend to put his hands on [?]
And look what I got all those jumpy niggas as apprentice
I gotta murder everybody comin' with a vengeance (one)
Now the sickest that be on for the brain
I don't gotta tell nobody that the bitches are on the game
When they lookin' at 'em and really wanna beat the motherfucker
That'll run up on somebody then I try a bigger lane
Wanna copycat but then [?] on the west
I make 'em all money like my name is (David West?)
I'ma mess around and be a victim when I'm dealin' with the villain, blame it on
(INSANE)
Uh, get at

[Verse 3 - Troll:]
Trigger in minimum figure, the ammunition is quicker like I pull 'em
Trigger be leavin' up all of these scriptures
Everybody pullin', get 'em, they runnin' with venom
We sippin' the liquor, pull it, get 'em, clack
Hit 'em with an automatic, cut 'em all like I'm ravin'
I'm [?] in' like I'm Jesus, I'ma kill the body chemist
They call me a savage cause I damage anything on my way with a brain and I'ma clang

[Verse 4 - D-Loc:]
Comin' up in it, back the double up with the thang
Nigga get back motherfucker, nigga be comin' up quicker
The homie will blow my motherfuckin' brain
Back with the 44 Magnum and cut the nigga with the cane now
Up in the crane now, uppin' the katana
The nigga comin up in the hood, The Untamed
The gorilla comin' and strappin' the gilla, my nigga, remain for (squella?)
Comin' up quicker, when I'ma do my thing, my nigga
Comin' up in it, backin' the double and grabbin' the 44 Magnum and ready to do whatever
A nigga D-Loc The Vulture be straight carryin'
Get the (bud?) 'til venom'll kill 'em, finna hit 'em up, kill 'em and leave 'em in coma
Comin' and I'm in love with the jeopardy
Comin' through and nigga tryna test me and a nigga beat up a motherfucker
'Bout any kinda type of sick cause I'm too incredible and niggas are like
(Insane)

[Verse 5 - Crucified:]
Pull 'em stuckin' 'em get 'em all nasty and takin' 'em and puttin' 'em all up like majority
So then bustin' 'em through the hospital
It's like a posse
And so bring 'em around the corner on the street in which we take 'em 
And then go on 'em and make 'em feel like insane 
And so motherfucker they are never confront us
And we get 'em with the power and with question
How do you feel pushy and don't give a fuck because of it
And like an evil we smash 'em and take 'em to the another song
Whenever we hit 'em a front me after smash 'em, we gonna hit 'em with the venom
And wait the moment 'til my choppers all will feel and will go like an insane
And we are murdering 'em all like murderers and venom all 'em and get 'em all blinked motherfucker
I'm fuckin' beast, we are that murdering choppers and we still get 'em on the flames
This is for sneak and for the venom as soon as I'm steppin I get 'em all victimized
Whats chopper from us bring 'em and stick 'em motherfucking majority 
And like a leader come and fuck the fucking egos
It's time to chase 'em everybody cause its real hard to fuck that bitches
And make 'em like pitches in the fucking visions and make 'em all be the scared
I'm that motherfucker that gonna beat 'em
And gonna rip 'em
And hold 'em on their bag and saying like you are my ham and something shit
Because they are very wicked bitches that might gon' die
And I'm gonna take em and kill 'em bitches and runnin' up in your house
(Insane)

[Verse 6 - KD The Stranger:]
Псины псевдо
Советы давали, но беды миновали, потому доконали морально
Меня тупо не понимали, потому намерено мешали
Потом пытали, подумайте пули парабеллума были летальны
Точёны навыки по ночам, по началу и миновали страны
Это потому были зависимы от микрофона
Наоборот такими поломали талоны
половина которых пытались потом балаболить
НЕ зомбированы массами
За грамотой не ламинированной они прятали разумы
Словами заминировали виды сразу
Тебя постепенно два материка атаковали фразами
Но вы били ногами по полу
Не слышали мы топота
Так заведено было
(Insane)

[Verse 7 - Charlie Ray:]
Hmmm... Bitch please, you be layin' in the gravel
When I know about the niggas 
That I'm bringin' to the batter
I be kickin' on your head 
And got it shakin' like a rattle
Anybody wanna beef with me when I murder all the cattle
Skate down and get ghost 
Quicker than my brain gets when I hit the slopes
We be beatin' mother flame, they will deliver the pain 
But when I take 'em with the griller 
Then I'ma hit again the do' with the flow so SWITCH!
I fuck 'em with the lyric and murder, I'm homegrown
I be singing like an alien and tell 'em to phone home
Like I'm about to hop in the ship with the brother
Take a drink over with 'em 
And tell 'em how many bitches slain dick 
Then I gotta go with the niggas who can't spit
Every single record that I bring is the same shit
Here's why you don't fuck with niggas who brainsicken 
(Insane)﻿

[Verse 8 - Z (of Firing Squad):]
I'm a
Monster in the dark, when I tore up their face
Give it a barely other inevitable, I have to pay
I chop for the Brain, but heat it like a [?]
But we're equally gassed, so I Shoot For The Face
Show pity when I'm switchin' lanes
And strategically came to the spittin' range, split the thangs
Stop, get choked, the chains
It's the power squad, that's who, [?]
Literal when I get on, when I gas 'em with the mask off
Talkin' about what we said, then I be comin' surely after
I'm mysterious, hate 'em, let 'em laugh all they laugh off
It's pityful, I couldn't boy, none of 'em are [?]
Act when I smack, my brain gonna fuck 'em
On way to my mind, hold on motherfucker
Killer when I'm dealin' with the villain that is speakin' B.R.A.I.N. 
(Insane)
Brainsick, bitch

[Verse 9 - Twisted Insane:]
Hit 'em whenever they wanna go and get up the pain in you
Choppin' 'em up into pieces doin' it 50 when I'm doing the voodoo
Taking up with my nieces I will find people with telekinesis 
Takin' 'em off Filicia
And being sure that you are fuckin' poodles
Hypnotizin' people lookin' at me like I'm Godzilla 
I'm comin' out of the ocean with bullets ready to kill em
I seek 'em like I'm a pilum I'm lookin' for motivation 
Maybe thinkin' about something then I will remain a pillar
Takin' 'em up in their back 
And puttin' their sack up, into their (homies?)
And if they tell me everything I wanna know what they fucked
Finally gettin' to talkin', now the others remember stalkin'
I hope they tell me everything I wanna know, they are still fucked
Doublin' up with the wack and I'm finna be puttin' their body in 'em
And they don't wanna see me when I'm really on my thang 
I will cook 'em in the kitchen and eat 'em with the feast
Motherfucker, I'm
(Insane)
