If you could see what I can see
Through my eyes
Through the shadows you'd believe what I believe
Tell no lies
Get your carcass ripped apart and violently
All this dark inside of me
Come take part in my disease
Night Vision
Night Vision
Night Vision
Night Vision

Nightmare files
Run up on a nigga with a thousand people with me I don't fight fair now
Everybody quick to run their motherfucking lip and be criminal but be tripping when the lights go out
Hide? no how
No way when I OJ
Competition with the psycho style
And you can bet you finna catch a rifle round
Then a nigga call the brain and let the cyclone down
Disintegrate a victim on a dinner plate at home
Kill them and I break bones
Cause you niggas ain't real
I'm R.Kelly laughing at that nigga Trey Songz
Then I dump them in a river they don't demonstrate skill
Do your best with the vest then I penetrate steel
Something like your bitch when she come to see me
Invest in the best cause I been on their heels
And a nigga never tried to do it for the T.V
Instead I'm a bick it with my niggas in red and the homies in blue and then we finna make green
And I ain't even talking about a little bit of bread
Money bigger than my head
What they need to pay me
Until I see green like I'm nocturnal
Glock turn a nigga to a puddle
Make a mop with your dreads
Cleaning up on aisle three
Chop like a copter I'm repping for the block fuck a cop and a fed
You can find me in the studio when I'm at home
And I ain't talking to nobody, I ain't picking up the phone
I'm working, trying to catch a body, hit the weed, I'm in the zone
I'm finna choke a motherfucker quit your breathing, bumpin' Bone
Everybody know not to fall when you run
If you dipping from a nigga wickedly grippin' a chainsaw
And you can do it all with a gun but I'm more fun
Pay me a visit, come see what they saw

If you could see what I can see
Through my eyes
Through the shadows you'd believe what I believe
Tell no lies
Get your carcass ripped apart and violently
All this dark inside of me
Come take part in my disease
Night Vision
Night Vision
Night Vision

[Twisted Insane:]
I'm bustin' out the van and I'm willin' to fill 'em with venom
It's only the beginnin', no healin' the women and children
There ain't no penicillin, no healin', I'm dealin' the feelin'
There ain't nobody chillin', I'm still in the building to peel 'em
I post up in the park and I'm bustin' on people who squealin'
If anybody know me they know I'm becomin' a villain
I walk up on you niggas like I was the devil and drill 'em
Hit 'em up with the sick, I'm the definition of a killer
The master, murder them, all o' ya overdosing on potion
Roasting these bitches that wanna whoop but that's baloney
I fill 'em up full of semen I'm seeming to be a demon
You planning to overthrow me but motherfucker I'm on to you
You can tell she 'bout to fall just by the way she's running
Bullets going every which or way the site the gauge is dumping
Should've shut the fuck up, hit the kitchen and just bake the muffins
Fuck a lovey dovey stupid bitch 'cause you ain't taking nothing
Night vision green
Meaning that my nigga pimping snooky playing hooky but you bitches on my team
Fffuck it I was all up out the door, I gotta go
But I was moving hella slow like I was faded off of lean
Leaning to the side because I'm faded off of goose
I was always banging steady hanging like a noose
I be on my shit don't trip it bitch I thought you knew
I will leave your blood up on the floorboards like ooh
When the people see me they be telling stories of a bat
Eating people like you Michael Keaton only black
Fuck what you believe in, I'm a demon who is speaking to you
Every single week and there's a reason that's a fact
I'm bustin' out the van and I'm willin' to fill 'em with venom
It's only the beginnin', no healin' the women and children
There ain't no penicillin, no healin', I'm dealin' the feelin'
There ain't nobody chillin', I'm still in the building to peel them
