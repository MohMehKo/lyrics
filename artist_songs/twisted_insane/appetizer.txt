Hopping on them killing and murdering always,
Kill em when I serve em and burn em in hallways,
If they wanna test it I'm giving em all AIDS,
I will put you up in a ditch and your bitch will dig all day,
Fill em full of Sickopotamus I recall it,
They find the body it's highly obvious ain't no stopping this,
When I'm popping this niggas dropping it I ain't making no promises,
But I be all up in it like I was a gynecologist,
The lyrical fiend,
Jumping up over the niggas putting their bodies up in the river cause they don't wanna worship a monster,
Not done till I conquer,
I'm taking they heads off whenever they wanna run up and they get their brain split bizzankers,
In the nighttime out putting in work,
Everyone looking at me, cause I be putting em in the dirt,
Hacking away at the feet, stabbing the dinner until it hurt,
All hail Insane or you will get merched,
Niggas talk wack and they take a cat nap,
One false move and your hearin the blap blap,
You never know when niggas is coming to klack klack,
That's why I keep a strap in my ghostbusters backpack,
Fuck with me then,
Anytime any city it don't matter you gone have to fuck with my friends,
The B-R-A-I-N,
Si-ai-i-ai-ick,
Go ahead and trip watch the lil homies go in,
