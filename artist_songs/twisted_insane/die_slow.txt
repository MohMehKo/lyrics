I was on a road
Sittin with a 40 
And I get ta grinning
As I check a message on my phone
As I get ta looking 
Seeing what it was 
I get to drimming 
As it was a bitch 
And she was saying she was gone 
Wait hold up watchu talkin bout
I must've heard you wrong
Is she fuckin with a nigga
Bitch I really have to kill him
And I get to finding out
When I was on the road 
That she was out there being hungry 
Bringin niggas round my children
Bitch you really got some nerves
Like you've really never heard
Of the words that I 
Say inside a verse
I will curse you 
Nobody fucks around
With my emotions
U was thinking it was funny
I will put u in a hearse
And I made a voodoo doll
When it was tricky like you
Really bitch u must
Think I am silly
I am serious to death
Do us part
Don't let me start
On all the wicked shit
I read on doing
Doing to you if u ever
Fuckin left
Standing over you
When you was sleeping 
And I'm bout a put a backup in ya chest
Watchu really thought
That you would go 
And fuck a nigga
Ina beanie on the cushin
But u really think ur bleesed
Did u run up out of sex
Did he make u cum
Hit it from back
Did u suck his dick
Like you do me
So u got gobble him
And probably swallow him
And fuck him and feet him
Now u wishin that u never
Knew me
Cuz I'll really fuckin put u
In a horror movie
When they ask who did it
Tell em black widow did it
Fuck him I would take him
With my hands if I could
But I really think I should
Put a scapple up in it
And I'm feelin jus ta take
Ya adams apple and split it
But if I really do it 
Then the music is gone
And I don't wanna fuck around
And lose my career for a stupid
Ass bitch I will 
Put it in a song
But what about your muthfukin
Kids and the stories
They be telling me about
The niggas u sneak in at night
U b thinking that they sleeping
But they really peeking
At you while you on your knees
Suckin runnin niggas pipes
Walk up in the room
Meet ur doom
Hit the lights 
With the twist of my knife
You'll be laying in blood
Brains in my fit-it
I remain hella wicked
Put a bullet in the chamber
Put a bitch up in a mud
Die Slow
