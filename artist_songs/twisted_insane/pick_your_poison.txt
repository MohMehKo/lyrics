[Verse 1: Twisted Insane]
If I take another hit
Then I'mma have another fit
And get to talkin to my seatbelt
Really get to zonin
When I really get to rollin
The homie told me you know I know exactly just how he felt
Hit em all up behind my heat
Feelin like I was trippin cuz I couldn't feel my feet
I'm running up on the deep
And then I'm right about ta leap
And why the fuck can't I stop grinding my teeth
Pick your poison and bring your boys in
I got the toys and the go through niggas
Fully loaded clips when I'm off a trip
You don't really wanna see the shit I'll show you niggas..
My heart is beatin' quicker
Maybe it was the pill or maybe it was the liquor
You feel like superman when your drinkin' from my elixir
But there ain't nobody stoppin' this venom I will deliver
And I want more slippin in-to my pores
Got me sicker than a horse
Even if it was yours
I will puke it up on the floor
Have you wiping up the blood to see me lookin threw your chores
And I don't really care about how sober you are when you walkin' because you are gonna leave lit!
You can shoot it, you can light it
You can sniff it, you can shit
I got a million different ways for you to take a fuckin hit,
Pick your poison

[Hook]
Over doses and bottles or baggies take your pick
Dawg you ain't had enough if that shit ain't make you sick
We in the street for that profit to get them pockets swollen
Now get to pickin your poison and watch that rocket go

Shrooms, extacy, alcohol, emilien, heroin,
Overdose-in, crystal-meth, pick your poison

[Verse 2: Charles Xavier]
Huh, now a nigga like me
I ain't fuckin with the powder see I'd rather really pop a pill
Chase it with a little bit of liquor hit the Mary got me feelin like I got some helicopter skills
And when I thought I was done theres more after
My niggas lookin at me like dawg you gonna have ta
The hits on me and since I'm in the rotation I betcha
That I'll make it to Mars before NASA
Now shut the fuck up and give me a pain pill
So I can remain chill
And stay in the game still
Otherwise I'll be in with love pain invitable
Ready to murder somebody theirs nobody I can't kill!
You niggas better lay off or it's Adolf
Put a motherfucker in a oven with the stake sauce
But I probably hit the weed and forget and burned my fuckin house down you can see that I'm sick so
Whateva just make sure I'm loaded
So I can take my mind off of this horse shit
I see so much of this dosage
Cuz yall niggas disrupt my focus
And I just wanna be numb
See I don't care what it is so give it up or I'mma have to stick a sword in
They probably wonder who in the hell let the boys in
Twisted-Insane and C.Ray pick your poison

[Hook]
Over doses and bottles or baggies take your pick
