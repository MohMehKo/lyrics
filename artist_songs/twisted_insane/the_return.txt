Round Seven...

It's the return
Tell me when the fuck is everybody finna learn
Ain't nobody on my level he could be the devil I don't gas shit to give them burn
Ain't nobody wanna murder with the venom I'll V-S a nigga, really want his turn
Send him on a mission nigga better listen if a nigga don't then put him in an urn
I'm Godzilla
Adios a nigga mamacita when the fuck I tell em pull up on me get em in there with a 9 and then we met up at the rear roofing
Tried to hit the elevator comin' to my floor got a couple rolled when I'm bout to blow
Hit the hallway then turn right, it's no 210
