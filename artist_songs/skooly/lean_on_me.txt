Baby I'm yours no need to lie
Baby I'm yours no need to cry
You the one I adore no need to lie
And you mean so much more no need to cry
(And baby girl) You can lean on me
I'll be there so you can lean on me
Here's my shoulder you can lean on me
I won't leave so you can lean on me

There ain't too much wrong with the way we live
My house is your home you can stay at my crib
And I'm so in love and its plain to see
Need help with my heart give me love on 3
I'll take care you girl like 1, 2, 3
And I swear I'm in love and I ain't goin' no where
No more rainy days
Everything gone change
I'm a take away all the pain
Love my soul

Baby I'm yours no need to lie
Baby I'm yours no need to cry
You the one I adore no need to lie
And you mean so much more no need to cry
(And baby girl) You can lean on me
I'll be there so you can lean on me
Here's my shoulder you can lean on me
I won't leave so you can lean on me

Rich kid
Sk8 board
Take ya girl and giver her back
And we straight like that
That's what happenin' with it
And I know you like it slow but right now we goin' fast
And I know she got a ass
I'm fuckin' with it
No light, no camera, just us
From the front to the back I bust
Put another strap on
Hope that it will last long
Bet them neighbors know my name like Trey Songz
Girl I'm a fuck you good
Get ya bragg on
I'm a bend that ass over like the last song
Up down, up down and switches
Splash splash lemme switch positions
In the bedroom now we in the kitchen
Don't talk, don't talk just listen
I'm in it
Let's get it
I'm with it

Baby I'm yours no need to lie
Baby I'm yours no need to cry
You the one I adore no need to lie
And you mean so much more no need to cry
(And baby girl) You can lean on me
I'll be there so you can lean on me
Here's my shoulder you can lean on me
I won't leave so you can lean on me

11 o'clock
On the dot
I stole my pop's drop
I'm sittin' on yo street
I got a real sexy thing that I been textin' and she waitin' for me
Put it up
Put it out
Girl we out of town
The speed limit 70
Can we do 69
We can do it to the grind
Up and down 'round and 'round
And now she want some more
It's a rodeo

Baby I'm yours no need to lie
Baby I'm yours no need to cry
You the one I adore no need to lie
And you mean so much more no need to cry
(And baby girl) You can lean on me
I'll be there so you can lean on me
Here's my shoulder you can lean on me
I won't leave so you can lean on me
