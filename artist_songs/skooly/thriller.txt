Watch watch out

Drop the top dog
Take her top off
Get my rocks off
Good fellows, not soft
They gonna pop off
In the 9 with it, getting guap dog
Shit can't stop dog
Shit won't stop dog
At the top dog, from the block y'll
Say thy real niggas
But they guap short
You're a little nigga
You're a hot dog
From the top of the block looking down dog
Used to come up on the block to hang round, you all
Niggas never gave me shit, didn't make a sound dog
Niggas could never make me hits
They stole my sound, dog
From where the bottom was
They gave me problems for it
I'm a motherfucking product of environment
This is no motherfucking question
All them niggas bluffing
That's the end of discussion
Fuck that shit you talking
You ain't talkin bout no money
