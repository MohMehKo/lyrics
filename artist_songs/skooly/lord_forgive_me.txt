We gon' have problems again, we gon' shoot choppers again
Huh, cause niggas, they playing round with' it
I pray everyday just to get it, niggas ain't with' it
I will not play with no nigga
Hop out them inches, ooh, extension in britches, huh
Not stuntin' on niggas, we stuntin' on them bitches
Come from a life of the whippin', my brother had knife in the kitchen
Brother used fork in the pot
You know the story behind it, he had a historical spot
Shout out to Fatty and Naja, lowkey I'm all that they got
I cannot wait till they out!
Them niggas shaking the block, them niggas breaking the clock
I'm coming to take all your spot
They gonna take what you got, they gonna take all you got, whoo!

I went through hell for mines, I went through hell for mines
When I open my eyes, I can't see nothing but scales and signs
Pay them no never mind
(Youngin' turning to a monster, trucker turning to a Tonka)
Then they chopper sprayin' like we talking, huh
West side till I'm gone in, let's ride when I'm hungry
Oh that's right, you are that guy getting chastised in the corner, ha
Sippin' syrup till I'm yawning, still won't rest my eyes in the morning
Ahhh, two cups won't take my pain, in two months I'm a take my fame
You pussy niggas keep playing with the game, I guess I'm just random with things
I guess I'm into handling things, breaking shit, dismantling things
More stripes than Adidas, catch a nigga like I'm Randy Moss
I love your mama and just know that we blessed, word to my ankle and neck, haha!

Lord forgive me again
Did what I did, committed a sin
Did what I did, did what I did, did what I did, yeah
