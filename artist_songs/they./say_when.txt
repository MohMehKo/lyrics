Yeah we lost another soul, so know your way
They say to stay up in your lane and know your place
All this talkin' seem to make shit complicated
It's like goin to war if you'd leave it up to me
It's that new phenomenon
This that shit that Malcom's on
All my niggas got armor on
So go on and act like it's not your fault
Claim that you keepin' us safe
How could I trust what you say
Nigga get the fuck out my face
Who do you think that you playin' with?

You or me, I'll go first
That's on God, that's on God
Do ya thang, gon' shoot us down
We're down to die, down to die

You know we're down to shoot, but all ya gotta do is say when
Baby, skip the conversation
You know we're down to shoot, but all ya gotta do is say when
Baby, skip the conversation

I got this shit from my grandfather
These politic niggas some scam artists
Call it the land of the free but that shit ain't for me
We'll go out like some damn martyrs
Watch how THEY. shove all that money
Way deep in my pockets and tell me to stop it
Do what you do, yeah that's cool
But for me being neutral was never an option
We never shy from the drama
I used to swim with piranha
I put that shit on my mama
Which one you bitches will run up?
Now shoot down my brothers and let em fall
And then we some thugs if we get involved
Fuck you and ya system, you killin' my niggas
And you think we about to just let you off?
(Fuck that, Pull up!)

You or me, I'll go first
That's on God, that's on God
Do ya thang, gon' shoot us down
We're down to die, down to die

You know we're down to shoot, but all ya gotta do is say when
Baby, skip the conversation
You know we're down to shoot, but all ya gotta do is say when
Baby, skip the conversation
