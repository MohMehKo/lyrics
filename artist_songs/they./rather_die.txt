Front seat, can't sleep, keep straight, or
Stay behind
Can't turn back, no, can't shake this
State of mind

Pray for me, pray for me, you don't know what to
Say to me
Ain't this so crazy?
Yeah, I don't know what I'm sayin'
And I could be wrong
But, I'd rather feel something than nothin' at all
One more time, baby

I'd rather die
Than wonder why I never tried
I wanna dive into the fire
Been waiting to feel like I'm alive
One more time, baby

I'd rather die
Than wonder why I never tried
I wanna dive into the fire
Been waiting to feel like I'm alive
One more time, baby

Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah

Am I the only one under the sun
Who's had enough and wants to run
But never does?
Sick from who I've become and now
My freedom seems to be the sweetest one
I'd die just to get a little taste
See it from the look on my face
But you ain't ever been in my place
You ain't ever...

Pray for me, pray for me, you don't know what to
Say to me
Ain't this so crazy?
Yeah, I don't know what I'm sayin'
And don't get me wrong
But, I'd rather feel something than nothin' at all
One more time, baby

I'd rather die
Than wonder why I never tried
I wanna dive into the fire
Been waiting to feel like I'm alive
One more time, baby

Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah

I'd rather die
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
I'd rather die
