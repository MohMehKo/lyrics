Lately we've be looking for the silence
You know how it is, you know the way it goes
This is what it feels like to be honest
Don't act like you ain't never been here before
We don't give a fuck about the mileage
We ain't really here 'cause we just come and go
This is what it feels like to be honest
You know how it is, you know the way it goes

Hit this, isn't it twisted how we just sit here puffing all day?
Hit this, isn't it this shit, what we be missing, wanted all day?

We're lightin'
We're floatin'
It's all for, the silence
We're livin'
We learn for
We long for, the silence
We're lightin'
We're floatin'
It's all for, the silence
We're livin'
We learn for
We long for, the silence

You been tired of the sirens
I been running from the lights
You been searching for the silence
Just to light it up tonight

Hit this, isn't it twisted how we just sit here puffing all day?
Hit this, isn't it this shit, what we be missing, wanted all day?

We're lightin'
We're floatin'
It's all for, the silence
We're livin'
We learn for
We long for, the silence
We're lightin'
We're floatin'
It's all for, the silence
We're livin'
We learn for
We long for, the silence

Usually people ask the simple question
They'll ask, how was it?
I think I see it, tell me?
So thank you
It's like you just

We're lightin'
We're floatin'
It's all for, the silence
We're livin'
We learn for
We long for, the silence
We're lightin'
We're floatin'
It's all for, the silence
We're livin'
We learn for
We long for, the silence
