Say somethin'
Know that there's two sides to every story
Tryna call the shots but you ain't even got the gun
Tryna play with fire, ended up just gettin' burned

You know, you know
Don't say that I didn't warn you
You should let go
Put it all out in the open
Say we ain't talkin' no more
Say we ain't fuckin' no more
Go ahead and let it be known
They gon' keep asking it
I'm gon' keep telling 'em
We ain't fuckin' no more
Don't talk about me no more, shit
I came and got what I wanted
You don't matter no more, you don't matter no more

Tell 'em, tell 'em why, why
Tell 'em, tell 'em why, why, why
Tell 'em, tell 'em why, why
(Tell 'em why, tell 'em why)

Tell 'em, tell 'em why, why
Tell 'em, tell 'em why, why, why
Tell 'em, tell 'em why, why
(Tell 'em why, tell 'em why)

Tell 'em why you never ever got that diamond
And why you only get to ride in the Impala [?]
I'm Sorry for the timing
Never needed that side bitch
And That's the truth
Way you trippin' is the proof
Sorry, had to cut you loose
Know that shit was overdue, overdue

You know, you know
Don't say that I didn't warn you
You should let go
Put it all out in the open
Say we ain't talkin' no more
Say we ain't fuckin' no more
I came and got what I wanted
You don't matter no more, you don't matter no more

Tell 'em, tell 'em why, why
Tell 'em, tell 'em why, why, why
Tell 'em, tell 'em why, why
(Tell 'em why, tell 'em why)

Tell 'em, tell 'em why, why
Tell 'em, tell 'em why, why, why
Tell 'em, tell 'em why, why
(Tell 'em why, tell 'em why)
