Sometimes I start to wonder if
You could ever learn the game
Even if I ever wondered
You could never do the same
I got everything I wanted
You just hope I wouldn't change
Ah, you caught me in the moment
Ah, you are, you at the same

Just know everything you do comes back around
(Don't know what to say, don't know what to do)
Just know everything you do comes back around
(Don't know what to say, don't know what to do)
Just know everything you do comes back around
(Don't know what to say, don't know what to do)
Just know everything you do comes back around
(Don't know what to say, don't know what to do)

These days things just ain't the same
Real strange to see it on your face
You know you stay tryna catch me miss the thing
Way in to put me in my place
You came gon' run it all day
Court side, I was with another chick
You swear that shit ain't even face your fear
You would turn around and do the same to me
You say, "you don't know what the bullshit"
Had enough
'Cause my excuses are adding up
You say "I see you playin' games"
Okay that's what's up
On to the next nigga, batter up

Sometimes I start to wonder if
You could ever learn the game
Even if I ever wondered
You could never do the same
I got everything I wanted
You just hope I wouldn't change
Ah, you caught me in the moment
Ah, you are, you at the same

Just know everything you do comes back around
(Don't know what to say, don't know what to do)
Just know everything you do comes back around
(Don't know what to say, don't know what to do)
Just know everything you do comes back around
(Don't know what to say, don't know what to do)
Just know everything you do comes back around
(Don't know what to say, don't know what to do)
