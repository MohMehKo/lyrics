Goin' off the deep end
Drownin' for the weekend
We don't need a reason
Put it all on me

No, I know 'round the way
That's just how it is
Yeah, I do it for no reason
That's just how it is
I deserve somethin' different
Than the average
If you in town for the weekend
Give me a blessin'
I ain't gon' judge ya
We don't know better
I ain't the only nigga
So there ain't no pressure
Just come and get it
I know you're ready
It's automatic

Give it to me, ain't no time to play
Won't hesitate, when I'm divin' in
Swimming so deep in your water
Vision blurry, vision blurry
We're going off the deep end (ooh)
Drowning for the weekend (ooh, no)
I don't need a reason (ooh)
Put it all on me (ooh, oh)
I see you're greedy (ooh)
You must be feanin' (ooh, oh)
Don't worry you gon' get your treatment (ooh)
Put it all on me all, all on me (ohh, ohh)

Long days
She been workin' long days
Main nigga got no juice

Four Seasons
Get it poppin' off like Pompeii
Parked up, Mauro
She wanna get up on me in the broad day
Shit, real shit
Did that one time
Your type be catchin' them feelings
They never on time
I ain't been trustin' no bitches in Rio
Way back in 09'
We gonna see if with me if we
Keep it together or nah

Give it to me, ain't no time to play
Won't hesitate, when I'm divin' in
Swimming so deep in your water
Vision blurry, vision blurry
We're going off the deep end (ooh)
Drowning for the weekend (ooh, no)
I don't need a reason (ooh)
Put it all on me (ooh, oh)
I see you're greedy (ooh)
You must be feanin' (ooh, oh)
Don't worry you gon' get your treatment (ooh)
Put it all on me, all, all on me (ohh, ohh)

For the one time, say your name
