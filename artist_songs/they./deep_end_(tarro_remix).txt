No, I know 'round the way
That's just how it is
Yeah, I do it for no reason
That's just how it is
I deserve somethin' different
Than the average
If you in town for the weekend
Give me a blessin'
I ain't gon' judge ya
We don't know better
I ain't the only nigga
So there ain't no pressure
Just come and get it
I know you're ready
It's automatic

Give it to me, ain't no time to play
Won't hesitate, when I'm divin' in
Swimming so deep in your water
Vision blurry, vision blurry
We're going off the deep end (vision blurry, vision blurry)
Drowning for the weekend (vision blurry, vision blurry)
I don't need a reason (vision blurry, vision blurry)
Put it all on me (vision blurry, vision blurry)
I see you're greedy (oh nana, oh na-nana)
You must be feanin' (oh nana, oh na-nana)
Don't worry you gon' get your treatment (oh nana, oh na-nana)
Put it all on me all, all on me (oh nana, oh na-nana)

Oh nana, oh na-nana
Oh nana, oh na-nana
Oh nana, oh na-nana
Oh nana, oh na-nana

Long days
She been workin' long days
Main nigga got no juice
She been waitin' on this all week
Four seasons
Get it poppin' off like Pompeii
Parked up, Mauro
She wanna get up on me in the broad day
Real shit
Did that one time
Your type be catchin' them feelings
They never on time
I ain't been trustin' no bitches in Rio
Way back in 09'
We gonna see if with me if we can keep it together or nah

Give it to me, ain't no time to play
Won't hesitate, when I'm divin' in
Swimming so deep in your water
Vision blurry, vision blurry
We're going off the deep end (vision blurry, vision blurry)
Drowning for the weekend (vision blurry, vision blurry)
I don't need a reason (vision blurry, vision blurry)
Put it all on me (vision blurry, vision blurry)
I see you're greedy (oh nana, oh na-nana)
You must be feanin' (oh nana, oh na-nana)
Don't worry you gon' get your treatment (oh nana, oh na-nana)
Put it all on me all, all on me

Going off the deep end (deep end)
Drowning for the weekend (weekend)
We don't need a reason (reason)
