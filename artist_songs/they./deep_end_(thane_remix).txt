Goin' off the deep end
Drownin' for the weekend
We don't need a reason
Put it all on me
Goin' off the deep end
Drownin' for the weekend
We don't need a reason
Put it all on me

No, I know 'round the way
That's just how it is
Yeah, I do it for no reason
That's just how it is
I deserve somethin' different
Than the average
If you in town for the weekend
Give me a blessin'
I ain't gon' judge ya
We don't know better
I ain't the only nigga
So there ain't no pressure
Just come and get it
I know you're ready
It's automatic

Give it to me, ain't no time to play
Won't hesitate, when I'm divin' in
Swimming so deep in your water
Vision blurry, vision blurry
We're going off the deep end
Drowning for the weekend
I don't need a reason
Put it all on me
I see you're greedy
You must be feanin'
Don't worry you gon' get your treatment
Put it all on me all, all on me

[Dante:]
Long days
She been workin' long days
Main nigga got no juice
She been waitin' on this all week
Four Seasons
Get it poppin' off like Pompeii
Parked up, Mauro
She wanna get up on me in the broad day
Shit, real shit
Did that one time
Your type be catchin' them feelings
They never on time
I ain't been trustin' no bitches in Rio
Way back in 09'
We gonna see if with me if we
Keep it together or nah

[IshDARR:]
You can put it all on me
Put that all on me
You can put it all on me
And she knew that
Yes you know that
If I ever, ever change, I never go back
Like I never called in the first place
You know who I am in the worst way
Worst days get brighter, what I learned
You a damn fool with the wordplay
What the link read? I don't parlay
No guilt trips, black Barbies
Still my main main, girl, I'm sorry
I'm just balling 'cause I'm young
You can put it all on me
Put that all on me
You can put it all on me
And she knew that
Yes you know that
If I ever ever change, I never go back
You blaming my ways now
Searching for a way out
But it ain't no options
Let the wolves up out the cage now
THEY., IshDARR, make them fuckers head shake now
Nah nah nah nah
So you can put it all on me

(Drownin' for the weekend)
