Phases, thinking lil' nigga going through
In phases, this the lifestyle nigga rich and shameless
Fake a smile cause they think a lil' nigga made it
Bitch I got four imported straight from Montreal
Maybe it's the alcohol, maybe it's the smelly riches on
Nigga vision make 'em wanna get involved
Tell that bitch that she can have it all
Tell that nigga she ain't get the call
Can't nobody do it like a lil' nigga do it
Check my fucking catalog, I got

Money and the bitches and the power
Never gave a fuck I wanted more
Sinning for a nickel on the dollar
Just to cop a penny for it all
This ain't for the grade A I don't need a medal
I don't think they get it, no, no, I can't stop
Bitch I got four imported straight from Montreal
Maybe it's the alcohol, maybe it's the smelly riches
Or a nigga vision make 'em wanna get involved
Tell that bitch that she can have it all
Tell that nigga she ain't get the call
Can't nobody do it like a lil' nigga do it
Check my fucking catalog, I got
