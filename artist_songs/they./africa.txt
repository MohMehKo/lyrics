I would do
I know I won't forget but in case you didn't know
Your smile and everything make me do
I would like to thank God for making this possible
And I would like to dedicate this album and every other note
That I play to him you know
(Yeah brother)

City of broken dreams
Check a nigga wallet
Money stack up to the ceiling
City of double D
Haven't you gone by it
What you stack up to the ceiling

Money's a devil they tell 'em, but they only tell 'em
'Cause they never felt what it feels to be on it
(Y'all niggas ain't got no motherfuckin' bitches)
Check my cerebellum I can tell 'em
Know what, you can lose California Cannabis
Which is for what you can't handle
It's never been worth it
(Y'all niggas ain't got no motherfuckin' bitches)
Check my cerebellum I can tell 'em

Money, money, money is all that nigga deserve
(Y'all niggas ain't got no motherfuckin' bitches)
Money, money, money is all that nigga deserve
(Y'all niggas ain't got no motherfuckin' bitches)

I would do

City of broken dreams
Singing for a dollar
Forgive me but I love the feeling
Know what they want from me
So I don't even bother
I do it all for a reason

Money's a devil they tell 'em, but they only tell 'em
'Cause they never felt what it feels to be on it
(Y'all niggas ain't got no motherfuckin' bitches)
Check my cerebellum I can tell 'em
Know what, you can lose California Cannabis
Which is for what you can't handle
It's never been worth it
(Y'all niggas ain't got no motherfuckin' bitches)
Check my cerebellum I can tell 'em

Money, money, money is all that nigga deserve
(Y'all niggas ain't got no motherfuckin' bitches)
Money, money, money is all that nigga deserve
(Y'all niggas ain't got no motherfuckin' bitches)

I would do

Tell 'em niggas how to [?] itself
This is what a nigga dream about
Take another shot of liquor with a couple [?]
Just to chase it down
We gon' never be on bigger ground
This is what a nigga preach about
We will always be a menace
To society so tell 'em that they can keep the crown

Money, money, money is all that nigga deserve
(Y'all niggas ain't got no motherfuckin' bitches)
Money, money, money is all that nigga deserve
(Y'all niggas ain't got no motherfuckin' bitches)
