We was from the North side, went to Georgetown
Good genes got you thick on, like, both sides
Head down, big stuff like oh my
Ever since you moved to California
You ain't been the same, you ain't been the same
Know you think you slick, but I know the way
Young nigga rich, you know what it takes
You know how to get it

What you want from me? You know who I am
I take what I get, that's just how I am
Give it all to me, I know what you did
Don't care what you say, I know where you've been

That's okay, that's alright
That's okay, that's alright
You think you're slick, but I like it
That's okay, that's alright
That's okay, that's alright
That's okay, that's alright
You think you're slick, but I like it
That's okay, that's alright

You the one that gon' act like you don't know who we are
We the only niggas in here who could buy the bar
Throw them ass and titties, they gon' get you very far
Knock them out the park, you got the juice like Barry Bonds
Lord, you got them blessings, girl, you know just who you are
You could get it better, bring it back, I swear to God
We can make a movie, girl, and you could be the star
Fly you out the country just to hit that ass abroad

What you want from me? You know who I am
I take what I get, that's just how I am
Give it all to me, I know what you did
Don't care what you say, I know where you've been

That's okay, that's alright
That's okay, that's alright
You think you're slick, but I like it
That's okay, that's alright
That's okay, that's alright
That's okay, that's alright
You think you're slick, but I like it
That's okay, that's alright
