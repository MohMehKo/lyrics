Just close your eyes and speak,
Say what we both know is inside you
If you want I'll keep
So much bury deep

Wake up its gone,
What made you fall away?
What came undone?
What made you fall away?

We were so true.
We were pure.

You saw how my heart was full of hurt.
I held you to stop breaking down around me.
I tried, I was weak
Just close your eyes and speak.
Feelings I keep, bury so deep, you fell away from me.
You fell away from me.

You breathed so deep, you loved so deep
I built all these walls
To keep you close.
