How long will I have to wait here for you?
I need to be content with what you do.
But when I watch you waste your wishful control of me
It upsets me so I will smile, I will walk away

tell me how you feel (I've changed my mind)

So much you tried to take from me
I followed you obsessively too long.
You make no sense with what you say
I've cut myself to get away.
It hurts.

Tell me how you feel (I've changed my mind)

Let me know I'm something to you.
Let me know I'm something to you.

Make me feel I'm something,
Make me feel I am,
Make me feel something,
Make me feel for you.
