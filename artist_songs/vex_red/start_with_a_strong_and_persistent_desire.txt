Need some time, disinfect
To purify what you have left
It's all I have claim to be
You ripped and fell away from me

They said it's alright
They said you're alright
I wish they knew what you have done

Why you kill me
Why you hate yourself
Why your killing
Why? Why?

Cut you down

Trust in me never mind
I wish sometimes you'll find
They said it's alright
They said you're alright

I wish they they knew
I wish they'd cut you down 

Why you kill me
Why you hate yourself
Why your killing
Why? Why?

You are the pain. You are the hurt, You are the hate
