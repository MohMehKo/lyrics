But I'm on fire
You surround me
You steal my breath

Trapped inside here
But you're around
I should go home
Move away from here

This time I'm leaving
Its time you left me alone
I wont hurt myself
For you or anyone
Look to me
Cos I'm on fire
I should go home
Move away from here

This time I'm leaving
It's time you left me alone
I wont hurt myself
For you or anyone

This time I'm leaving
It's time you left me alone
I wont hurt myself
For you or anyone 
This time I'm leaving
It's time you left me alone
I wont hurt myself
For you or anyone
