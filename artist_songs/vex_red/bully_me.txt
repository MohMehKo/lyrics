Say something to me
Tell me this is fake
Forget compromise
They just complicate
Long ago, empty again

I don't want sympathy
I'll do it my way
I don't want to listen
To what they will say
I'm much to paranoid

Your calling me 
You want peace
May I will be
May you care

It becomes a habit
A priority
Never will forget it
It's inside of me
It makes me feel ugly
I don't want it to be

Your calling me 
You want peace
May I will be
May I care

Holy Sent me
I want to die

Your calling me 
You want peace
May I will be
May I care

Your calling me 
You want peace
May I will be
May I care
