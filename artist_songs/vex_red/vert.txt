Hide away
Keep safe
Put your hand
on your eyes
They wont mind
You will be fine

I need you 
Whisper
I need home to

Fake with open arms
Rests inside of you
You should see the harm
They can do to you
If we stay to long

wanted you to touch
wanted you to see

They'll never find you
Through your hands
I try to give you
All I can

Because I'm quiet
You think I'm weak
But all these secrets
Belong to me

Fake with open arms

They'll never find you
Through your hands
I'll try to give you
All I can

Because I'm quiet
You think I'm weak
But all these secrets
Belong to me
