You know I've always felt
I ' m here with no one else
I hear, I've come apart
You've seen what's in my heart

I get so bored make your move,
I won't waste away for you
Don't bring me down
We're the same kind
I'm crying without you

I'm feeling all your pain
You know I feel the same
You really shouldn't question me

You're never satisfied
It's fucking me inside
You really shouldn't question me

It's true
It's all because of you
We're all so lost
You sleep
To rest your head
But me
I sleep to dream

I get so bored make your move,
I won't waste away for you
Don't bring me down
We're the same kind
I'm crying without you

I'm feeling all your pain
You know I feel the same
You really shouldn't question me

You're never satisfied
It's fucking me inside
You really shouldn't question me
