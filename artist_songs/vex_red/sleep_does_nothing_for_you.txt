Thoughts that stay trapped inside
My spirit
Helps me to recognise
I am
Nothing like you believe
Why do you want to question me?
Constantly

I'm different to you

Burn my wall down
Blacken all I am
You let me down
You are no better than me

Why should I be
more like you
But we tried that before
I still find my own way home
I still felt I was alone In here

I want to be heard
be missed
I want be loved
Be kissed
I want to be foetal
I wish
I could be moulded
To fit

You said you'd help me
You said you'd help me
You said you'd help me
