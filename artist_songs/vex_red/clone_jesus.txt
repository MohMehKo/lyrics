So you think you've calmed down
But your still the same now
You think you can hide truth
But its all inside you

Don't go to far
To hide your heart

Fake man
Give it all up
Then what you tell
Lives all wrong

Your not Jesus, Your not God
I know you think I am wrong
You don't have to open your heart
I can see you 
Wearing the crown

Fake Man
Give it all up
Then What you tell
Lives all wrong

You go to far
To hide your heart

Wait man
Give it all up
Then What you tell
Lives all wrong
