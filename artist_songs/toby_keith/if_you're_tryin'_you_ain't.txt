Yeah, you can try to love your woman, try to love your friends
Try to love your neighbor, you can try it again
Try to go to church, try to live your life
Probably still be tryin' on the day that you die

Well, if you're tryin' you ain't tryin', there's work to do, son
You can't get up early, baby, you can't get it done
Roll up your sleeves, don't tell me that you can't
Make something, something, if you're tryin' you ain't

Try something old, try something new
Try it when no one else is even watchin' but you
Try just a little, try it too much
Try an over do it and it still ain't enough

And if you're tryin' you ain't, there's work to do son
You can't get up early, baby, you can't get it done
Roll up your sleeves, don't tell me that you can't
Make something, something, if you're tryin' you ain't

Tryin', tryin' you ain't
Tryin', tryin'

Well, if you're tryin' you ain't, there's work to do son
You can't get up early, baby, you can't get it done
Roll up your sleeves, don't tell me that you can't
Make something, something, if you're tryin' you ain't

And if you're tryin' you ain't, there's work to do son
You can't get up early, baby, you can't get it done
Roll up your sleeves, don't tell me that you can't
Make something, something, if you're tryin' you ain't

Tryin', tryin'
Tryin' you ain't
Tryin still tryin
Tryin' you ain't

Tryin', tryin'
Tryin' you ain't
