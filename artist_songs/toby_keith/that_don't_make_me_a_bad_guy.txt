That don't make me a bad guy 
It don't scar my resume 
Don't you give me the black eye 
Judging by my day to day 
Easy to love and hard to keep 
Let it dance on the wild side 
I'm only good as I gotta be 
Yeah that don't make me a bad guy 

Chiva whiskey in a paper cup 
Catch a buzz and I sober up 
Comin' down with a pot-a-joe 
Sleep it off and away I go 
Runnin hard til the money's gone 
Half a day and all night long 
Get a girl with my romeo 
Yeah love a while then it's adios 

That don't make me a bad guy 
It don't scar my resume 
Don't you give me the black eye 
Judging by my day to day 
Easy to love and hard to keep 
Let 'er dance on the wild side 
I'm only good as I gotta be 
Yeah that don't make me a bad guy 

Yeah like a man I go to work 
Feel clean in my dirty shirt 
Ain't got a lot but I really try 
I've gotten good at gettin' by 
I'm a son of my daddy's name 
Yeah mama's proud and everything 
When it's time to make some noise 
Boys will be boys 

That don't make me a bad guy 
It don't scar my resume 
Don't you give me the black eye 
Judging by my day to day 
Easy to love and hard to keep 
Let 'er dance on the wild side 
I'm only good as I gotta be 
Yeah that don't make me a bad guy 

Villin or an outlaw 
I might kiss yer girl 
Or catch you with a south paw ain't 
Dangerous, contankerous maybe 
Just lookin' for a real good time 
Yeah a real good time 

Yeah 

That don't make me a bad guy 
It don't scar my resume 
Don't you give me the black eye 
Call me some kinda renegade 
Easy to love and hard to keep 
Let 'er dance on the wild side 
I'm only good as I gotta be 
Yeah that don't make me a bad guy 

I'm only good as I gotta be 
That don't make me a bad guy
