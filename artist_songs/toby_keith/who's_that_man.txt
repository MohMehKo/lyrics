Turn left at the old Hotel
I know this boulevard much too well
It hasn't changed since I been gone     
Oh, this used to be my way home

They paved the road thru the neighborhood
I guess the county finally fixed good
It was gettin rough
Someone finally complained eneogh

Fight the tears back with a smile
Stop and look for a little while
Oh it's plain to see
The only thing missing is me

That's my house & that's my car 
That's my dog in my back yard
There's the window to the room
Where she lays her pretty head
I planted that tree out by the fence
Not long after we moved in
That's my kids and that's my wife
Whose that man, runnin my life

If I pulled in would it cause a seen
There not really expectin me
Those kid's have been thru hell
I hear they adjusted well

Turn around in the neigbors drive
I'd be hard to recognise
In this pick-up truck
It's just an old fixer up

Drive away one more time
Lot of things going thru my mind
I guess the less things change
The more they never seem the same

That's my house & that's my car 
That's my dog in my back yard
There's the window to the room
Where she lays her pretty head
I planted that tree out by the fence
Not long after we moved in
That's my kids and that's my wife
Whose that man, runnin my life
