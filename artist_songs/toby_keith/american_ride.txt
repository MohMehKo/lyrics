Winters getting colder, Summer gettin warmer 
Tidal wave comin cross the Mexican border 
Why buy a gallon it's cheaper by the barrel 
Just don't get busted singing Christmas carols 

[Chorus]
That's us, that's right 
Gotta love this American ride 
Both ends of the o-zone burnin 
Funny how the world keeps turnin 
Look Ma, no hands 
I love this American Ride 
Gotta love this American Ride 

Mama gets her box off watchin desperate housewives 
Daddy works his ass off payin for the good life 
Kids on the youtube learnin how to be cool 
Livin in a cruel world, pays to be a mean girl 

[Chorus]
That's us, that's right 
Gotta love this American ride 
Both ends of the o-zone burnin 
Funny how the world keeps turnin 
Look Ma, no hands 
I love this American Ride 
Gotta love this American Ride 

Poor little Lithamus, Americas town. 
She gained five pounds and lost her crown. 
Quick fix plastic surgical antidote. 
Got herself a record deal, can't even sing a note 

Plasma gettin bigger, Jesus gettin smaller. 
Spill a cup of coffee, make a million dollars. 
Customs caught a thug with an aerosol can. 
If the shoe don't fit, the fits gonna hit the shan. 

[Chorus]
That's us, that's right 
Gotta love this American ride. 
Both ends of the ozone burnin. 
Funny how the world keeps turnin. 
Hot dog, Hot damn. 
I love this American ride. 
Gotta love this American ride. 
Oh yeah, 
Na na na na na na na na...
