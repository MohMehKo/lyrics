Whiskey knows my weakness
Bartender knows my pain
My heart knows I'm hurtin'
And the bar stool knows my name

This glass knows I'm empty
The devil knows my game
The good Lord knows I'm lonely
And the jukebox knows no shame

Nobody makes me cry,
Nobody gets me high
Nobody says goodbye
Or takes me back in time
To the place that we once were
Nobody thrills me,
Nobody chills me
Nobody kills me
Like Haggard, Hank and her

Memory and drinks don't mix too well
It's misery and gin
Like a whippoorwill I'm too blue to fly
What I wouldn't give, my baby would just walk in
'Cause I'm so lonesome I could cry

Nobody makes me cry,
Nobody gets me high
Nobody says goodbye
Or takes me back in time
To the place that we once were
Nobody thrills me,
Nobody chills me
Nobody kills me
Like Haggard, Hank and her

Oh, nobody kills me
Like Haggard, Hank and her
