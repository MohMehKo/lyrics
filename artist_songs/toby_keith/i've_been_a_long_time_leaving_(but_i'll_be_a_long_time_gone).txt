I've been a fool, I've been a fool
Forgivin' you each time you done me wrong
I've been a long time leavin' ya, but I'll be a long time gone

Loved you so much, loved you so much
I stayed around when I should've moved along
I've been a long time leavin' ya, but I'll be a long time gone

I say, "Hi there high line, hello highway"
Here come a big old semi my way
I stick up my thumb, hear the truck come
But the truck goes by and he looks like he's flyin'
And he whoops the big legs on my Levi's
They go woop woop woop woop woop

I've been a fool, I've been a fool
Forgivin' you each time that you've done me wrong
I've been a long time leavin' ya, but I'll be a long time gone

I say, "Hi, there high line, hello highway"
Here come a big old semi my way
I stick up my thumb, hear the truck come
But the truck goes by and he looks like he's flyin'
And he's whoopin' the big legs on my Levi's
They go woop woop woop woop woop woop woop woop

And I've been a fool, I've been a fool
Forgivin' you each time that you've done me wrong
I've been a long time leavin' ya, but I'll be a long time gone

Gone gone gone
Gone gone gone
