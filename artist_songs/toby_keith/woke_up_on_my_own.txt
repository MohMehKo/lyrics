I didn't call you up and tell you
Girl, I'm sorry, with whiskey on my breath
I didn't ask you to forgive me
'Cause girl, I know you haven't yet

I didn't midnight knock your front door
Catch you scared to be alone
I didn't wake up with an empty bottle, baby
Just kinda woke up on my own

For the first time in forever I see clearly why you're gone
Didn't open up my eyes because you said goodbye, baby
Just kinda woke up on my own

I didn't find strength in a stranger, I didn't go to bed all stoned
And I didn't come to see the light this morning, baby
Just kinda woke up on my own
I didn't come to see the light this morning, baby
Just kinda woke up on my own
