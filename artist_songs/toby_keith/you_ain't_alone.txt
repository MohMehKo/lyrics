I’ve chased all the cracks up and down the ceiling
Worn a path across these hardwood floors
I’ve stared at the walls and I’ve looked out the window
And I pray for your knock upon my door

There’s a sad lovers’ moon shining on the evening
I miss you more than ever and I’m sorry that you’re gone
I wish things were different
I had no way of knowing
If you’re all by yourself tonight
You ain’t alone, you ain’t alone

No coffee on the stove
And on the table in the kitchen
There’s a busted hand of midnight solitaire
There’s a ghost in the bedroom
A nightgown on the dresser
A broken heart that wishes you were there

There’s a sad lovers’ moon shining on the evening
I miss you more than ever and I’m sorry that you’re gone
I wish things were different
I had no way of knowing
If you’re all by yourself tonight
You ain’t alone, you ain’t alone

Tears of sorrow and regret
Ashtrays full of cigarettes
Empty bottles lined up just like soldiers
But by now somebody holds her
