Bet you’ll be glad to know
I got a brand new girlfriend
She took my broken heart
Patched it up again
She’s good lookin’
And she drives a convertible
She likes to laugh a lot
Totally flirtable

[CHORUS:]
I know that you think I’m lonely
But you got it wrong, Clementine
Hey, I don’t miss you too much
But still I think about you all of the time

I hear the people talkin’
They say you’re lookin’ good
They seen you walkin’ with him
Down in the neighborhood
You got all lovey-dovey
With this handsome man
I did not catch the rest
I got it second hand

[Repeat Chorus]

I think about you when I’m dancin’
And when I’m asleep, I think about it too
And if by chance I start romancin’
You guessed it, I think about you

Baby, I know that you think I’m lonely
But you got it wrong, Clementine
Hey, I don’t miss you too much
But still I think about you all of the time

Hey, I don’t miss you too much
But still I think about you all of the time
