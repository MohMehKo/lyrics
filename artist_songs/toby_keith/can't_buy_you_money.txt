I got a sweet little woman at home
She knows that I love her true
I got three little kids at home on the floor
They love there daddy too
I got one on the way and I don’t think I can pay the doctor bill
I never finished paying the last one off
Don’t guess I ever will

So we save it all up for a rainy day
But it’s always sunny
Guess all the happiness in the world
Can’t buy you money

I got an old work truck
It will barely get me to town and back
I try to put in a little over time
But that don’t put in no jack
So I bring it home
Were my baby got my hot supper cooked
Then I lay down and rest my weery bones
Get back up at six

Just workin’ hard in the land of milk and honey
Hey, all the happiness in the world
Can’t buy you money

But if I had plenty
I could keep us afloat
Then in the end if my ship don’t come in
I’d just buy a bigger boat
I ain’t got no money
I’m knee deep in dept
We must be livin’ on love from above
Because we ain’t hit bottom yet

I pick my paycheck up and go strait to the bank
That’s my usual route
Then I go home and pick up the wife and the kids
Because we’re goin’ out
It’s a drive threw window
Pick out a combo super size
Swing on down to the wallmart
Let the kids pick out a prize
My truck broke down at the red light
She thinks it’s real funny
Yes, all the happiness in the world can’t buy you money

So we save it all up for a rainy day
But it’s always sunny
Guess all the happiness in the world
Can’t buy you money
