Yeah me and bobby p stayed out all night 
Kickin it and cutting up and getting right 
I had a good time 
Till I cam crawlin in bout daylight 
And you were bawlin 
And remember that time I took your car 
You told me not to drive it but my truck wouldn't start 
I had to leave it parked it got a whiskey dent 
Down at the handlebar where I swore I never went darlin 

[Chorus]
You get mad sometimes 
I drive you right out of your mind 
I don't mean to make you crazy 
I'm not the devil just a dude 
Baby girl I know that you 
Could do better than me maybe 
But its too later, you already love me 
Yeah its too late, you already love me 

Starch my shirt and press my pants 
Mett your boss at tyour christmas dance 
In a suit and tie 
I wore my boots and jeans 
And when he rolled his eyeys 
Girl I caused a scene baby 

[Repeat Chorus]
