Midnight in the desert 
So far away 
It's a fingernail moon 
Dancing through the milky way 
Stars down in dixie 
Look the same way here 
And I got your picture 
Stuffed down in my battle gear 

I could sing that song 
You know the one that drives you wild 
And close my eyes and dream 
That I can kiss my baby's smile 

Even the man in the moon 
Is singing the blues 
Hope you still love me baby 
I'm missing me some you 

When your head hits the pillow 
To pray for my soul 
That's when your little soldier 
Goes out on patrol 
Never thought when I kissed you 
Goodbye in tennessee 
That I'd ever be lonely 
But I'm about as lonely as one man can be 

I could sing that song 
You know the one that drives you wild 
I could close my eyes and dream 
That I can kiss my baby's smile 

Even the man in the moon 
Is singing the blues 
Hope you still love me baby 
I'm missing me some you 

I miss you baby 

I could sing that song 
You know the one that drives you wild 
I can close my eyes and dream 
I can kiss my baby's smile 

Even the man in the moon 
Is singing the blues 
Hope you still love me baby 
Cause I'm missing me some you 
Oh, I hope you still love me baby 
Cause I'm missing me some you
