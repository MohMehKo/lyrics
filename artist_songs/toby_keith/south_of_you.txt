Sailed out of Biscayne Bay
Headed for the island
No map, no plans, no place to be
One broken heart to fix
So many memories
One photograph of you and me

I may be somewhere east of nowhere
Somewhere west of a town
That sits just north of an unknown latitude
I will sail this ship forever
Till I reach peace of mind
Live my life somewhere south of you

I’ve heard you say a thousand times
I’d never be a sailor
Yeah that’s one thing that I may never be
When a pirate makes his mind up
And it don’t care where he’s going
He’ll find a wind and ride out on the sea

I may be somewhere east of nowhere
Somewhere west of a town
That sits just north of an unknown latitude
I will sail this ship forever
Till I reach peace of mind
Live my life somewhere south of you

I will sail my ship forever
Till I reach peace of mind
Live my life somewhere south of you
