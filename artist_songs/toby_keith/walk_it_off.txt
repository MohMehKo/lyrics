Walk it off
Pick up all the pieces of your broken heart
You don't have to worry
She don't care anymore
She ain't there anymore
Hit the wall
'Cause no one you can call is gonna ease your pain
So take your torn umbrella out into the rain
Walk it off

Run
Boy you were born to run
Now the day has come
She's left you standin' still
So deal
How does it feel
To have to face the fact
She ain't coming back
Walk it off
[repeat]

Walk it off
Though you might not ever see her face again
Sittin' here alone just scares you half to death
Boy don't hold your breath

Walk it off
