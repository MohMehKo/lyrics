I stopped at a road house in Texas
A little place called Hamburger Dan's
I put a quarter in the jukebox
Play the Truck Drivin' Man

The waitress she poured me some coffee
I thanked her and called her back again
I said this song sure does fit me
Cause I'm a truck drivin' man

Pour me another cup of coffee
For it is the best in the land
I'll put a quarter in the jukebox
And play the Truck Drivin' Man

I climbed up inside my old semi
And then like a flash I was gone
I had them old wheels rollin'
I'm on my way to San Antone

Pour me another cup of coffee
For it is the best in the land
I'll put a quarter in the jukebox
And play the Truck Drivin' Man

Pour me another cup of coffee
For it is the best in the land
I'll put a quarter in the jukebox
And play the Truck Drivin' Man
And play the Truck Drivin' Man
