Mother earth has changed since i was a child
The east is a beast and the west is really wild
And the headlines say the end looks grim
And the future don't look so bright

You can't even open your mailbox, you can't take the plane
And everybody'lookin'for somebody to blame
I think I'm gonna let the president
Save this ol' world tonight

I'll light us a fire
And she'll turn off the news
We'll open a cold one and shake these blues

[chorus]
It's all good
It's alright
I'm gonna sit here with my baby all night
And let the troubles of this world 
Roll on by us like they should
It's all cool
It's ok
We've got everything going our way
Can't complain if we're alright
It's all good

I'm just a ragular Joe, with a beautiful girl
Just gettin by in a day-to-day world
We ain't got a lot, but we don't need anything

Covered in kises, surrounded by love
Showered with blessings from up above
When you'r sittin' on top of the world, man we got everything

we live out here in the country
Where the workin' class do
We've got our health and our happiness too

[chorus]

No can't complain 'cause we're alright
And it's all good
