I walk downtown in my broke down shoes
To the side street pub with the bar band blues
Take a backseat at the front door table
Order me a Bud and a shot of Black Label

Closed this place down once again
Sittin' here wishin' you'd walk right in
Down my shot, shoot my beer
I ain't gotta go home but I can't stay here

It's a short, short walk down to my second home
But that boulevard gets longer when you're walkin' back alone

And I don't know where you might be
Wherever it is, it will be without me
I keep thinkin' I'll come home
One day and find you

Long as I got that neon light
Shinin' like a beacon in the night
I know I can make it downtown by myself
'Cause if you don't know where you're goin'
You might end up somewhere else

Kickin' off my shoes, tumblin' through the front door
Knowin' too well the kind of night I'm in for
Cubs got beat again on Sports Center
My bedroom's cold as my TV dinner
One more cigarette and I'll kill the light
And I'll lay there wishin' you were sleepin' at my side

And I don't know where you might be
Wherever it is, it will be without me
I keep thinkin' I'll come home
One day and find you

Long as I got that front porch light
Shinin' like a beacon in the night
I know I can make it home all by myself
'Cause if you don't know where you're goin'
You might end up somewhere else

Girl, I don't know where you might be
Wherever it is, it will be without me
Keep thinkin' I'll come home
One day and find you

Long as I got that front porch light
Shinin' like a beacon in the night
I know I can make it home all by myself
'Cause if you don't know where you're goin'
You might end up somewhere else

Ah, somewhere else
You might end up somewhere else
Somewhere else
Hey
