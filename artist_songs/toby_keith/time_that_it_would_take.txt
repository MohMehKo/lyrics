Forget about my crazy days 
Forget about my checkered past 
What's all this Interrogatin? 
Baby, forget about that 
You don't want to ask no questions 
You don't know the answers to 
You might wish that I was lying 
Once you heard the brutal truth 
I can think a thousand things i'd rather do with you 

In the time that it would take me to explain the way I am 
Honey I could be well on my way to being your new man 
We could waste the day away digging up my buried bones 
Or you could turn it up and shake it, shake it all night long 
I could rationalize and apologize and justify my way right in your door 
But in the time that it would take me to tell you where i've been 
Honey I could take you places you ain't never been before 

Yeah come on girl now don't you judge me 
Come on girl cut me some slack 
Once I get you where i'm going baby you'll come on back 
You and me are gas and matches 
You and me could take this town 
Light it up and get her smokin' 
You and me could burn it down 
Or you could get all hung up on 
How much i've been around 

In the time that it would take me to explain the way I am 
Honey I could be well on my way to being your new man 
We could waste the day away digging up my buried bones 
Or you could turn it up and shake it, shake it all night long 
I could rationalize and apologize and justify my way right in your door 
But in the time that it would take me to tell you where i've been 
Honey I could take you places you ain't never been before
