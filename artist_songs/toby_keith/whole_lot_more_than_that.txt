If I want a new truck, gonna need more money 
If I want more sugar, gonna need a new honey 
If I'm going to the dance, gotta get a new hat 
Getting over you's gonna take me a whole lot more than that 

If I'm gonna watch a game, gonna need me a boob tube 
If I'm gonna to the lake, gotta take an igloo 
If I'm gonna catch a buzz, gonna need me a twelve pack 
Getting over you's gonna take me a whole lot more than that 

Going to need more whiskey, than one man can drink 
Drown this memory, that just won't sink 
I've hit rock bottom, in this bottle of Jack 
Getting over you's gonna take me a whole lot more than that 

If I need me a hangout, I'll find me a hot spot 
If I need me a new song, gonna find me a jukebox 
If I need me a kitty, I'll find me a cat 
Getting over you's gonna take me a whole lot more than that 

Going to need more whiskey, than one man can drink 
Drown this memory, that just won't sink 
'Cause I've hit rock bottom, in this bottle of Jack 
So getting over you's gonna take me a whole lot more than that 

Going to need more whiskey, than one man can drink 
Drown this memory, that just won't sink 
I've hit rock bottom, in this bottle of Jack 
Getting over you's gonna take me a whole lot more than that 
Getting over you's gonna take me a whole lot more than that 

Gonna take a little bit more than that
