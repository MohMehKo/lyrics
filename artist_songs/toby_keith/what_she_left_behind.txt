Bottle of perfume left on the table
By her side of the bed
I spray a little in the air
And outta nowhere, she's there
Hair on fire in the middle of the night
Just like that, she's lovin' me
Just like yesterday and into the thin air
She disappears again

Took her sandals, took her sundress
Took her ten dollar sand dollar necklace
She left a barefoot beach and a sunset
And all the love we made that night
Took some blame and some time for herself
Pretty much left everything else
It ain't what she took that messes with my mind
It's what she left behind

Clothes she wore the night before
Still layin' on the bathroom floor
When I found her ring on the sink I died right there
Where she said goodbye
Have a bottle of wine, where she found the nerve
A goodbye I never heard
On a teardropped letter I didn't read
But the worst thing she left was me

Took her sandals, took her sundress
Took her ten dollar sand dollar necklace
She left a barefoot beach and a sunset
And all the love we made that night
Took some blame and some time for herself
Pretty much left everything else
So it ain't what she took that messes with my mind
No, it ain't what she took that messes with my mind
It's what she left behind
It's what she left behind
What she left behind
