If the White House was in Texas, man
We'd get a straighter answer
If they'd let us smoke what we want
We'd have a lot less cancer

There'd be a bunch more daddies
Sons could be proud of
We'd have half the crime
We'd have twice the fun

With a few more cowboys
Be a lot less outlaws
With a few more amens
Be a lot less bad calls
With a few more yes Ma'ams
And a lot less yes men
This world would be a better place to live in
With a few more cowboys

If we did it with a handshake
We'd save a lot of paper
That'd save a lot of trees
We're shipping overseas to make her

If we stood by our word
Took care of our own
Bought it made in the USA
We'd keep it here at home

With a few more cowboys
Be a lot less outlaws
With a few more amens
Be a lot less bad calls
With a few more yes Ma'ams
And a lot less yes men
This world would be a better place to live in
With a few more cowboys

If we had a little more grit
Less politics, more fist fighting
Met 'em at high noon
Hell, it's about high time
We looked 'em in the eye
Got our head out of the sand
Hit 'em with a big John Wayne
By God, they'd understand

With a few more cowboys
Be a lot less outlaws
With a few more amens
Be a lot less bad calls
With a few more yes Ma'ams
And a lot less yes men
This world would be a better place to live in
With a few more cowboys

All in all we'd have a better world
With a few more cowboys
We'd have a few more cowboys
With a few more cowboys

If the White House was in Texas, man
We'd get a straighter answer
If they'd let us smoke what we want
Be a lot less cancer
