Chug-a-lug chug-a-lug

Grape wine in a mason jar
Homemade and brought to school
By a friend of mine after class
Me and him and this other fool
Decided that we'll drink up whats left
chug-a-lug so I helped myself
first time for everything
umm my ears still ring

Chug-a-lug Chug-a-lug
Make u wanna holla hidy hoe,
Burns your tummy don't you know
Chug-a-lug chug-a-lug

4 H and an FFA
On a field trip to the farm
Me and friend sneek off behind
This big old barn
Where we uncovered a covered up
Moonshine still
And we thought we'd drink our fill
And I swallowed it with a smile
ohh I run ten mile

Chug-a-lug chug a lug
Make u wanna holla hidy hoe,
Burns your tummy don't you know
Chug-a-lug chug-a-lug

Jukebox and sawdust floor
Somthin' like i've never seen
Heck I'm just going on 15,
But with the help of my fanaglein' uncle
I get snuk in for my first taste of sin
I said let me have a big old sip
bbbb i done a double back flip

Chug-a-lug chug a lug
Make u wanna holla hidy hoe,
Burns your tummy don't you know
Chug-a-lug chug-a-lug chig a chagle uh
