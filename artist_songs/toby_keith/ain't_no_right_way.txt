7 in the morning
She has to make a choice
Precious baby girl,
Or bouncing baby boy
She could either keep it,
Or give that child away
So she quit school that morning,
And became a mom that day

[chorus]
Ain’t no right way,
To do the wrong thing,
You can justify,
But it’s still black and white,
Paint it any shade,
But it won’t change
Ain’t no right way,
To do the wrong thing

News came on my TV,
A mother cried and said,
That her son was fighting for his life
Cause her husband lost his head,
Might have been a problem child,
If that boy were mine,
I wouldn’t beat him half to death,
Trying to make him walk the line

[chorus]
Ain’t no right way,
To do the wrong thing,
You can justify,
But it’s still black and white,
Paint it any shade,
But it won’t change
Ain’t no right way,
To do the wrong thing

Now empowered politicians,
Trying to pass a law,
They won’t let our children pray
For the better of us all,
If God blessed America,
Then how could someone vote,
To take prayer from our classrooms,
Right when we need prayer the most

[chorus]
Ain’t no right way,
To do the wrong thing,
You can justify,
But it’s still black and white,
Paint it any shade,
But it won’t change
Ain’t no right way,
To do the wrong thing
To do the wrong thing
