Well, I'm sick and tired of wakin' up sick and tired
As of today there's gonna be some changes made
Well you might as well keep your feet on the ground
Girl I won't stand still for your movin' around.
It's high time you quit your lowdown ways

Any talk you talk I hear over town
Is that really true girl that you just wanna jump up and down.
Hell, the word as well as I can recall
Everywhere you've been you've been the belle of the ball
It's high time you quit your lowdown ways.

I remember one time now way back down on the farm
My daddy had a dominiker hen but she wouldn't stay home
Damn, she could fly higher than a jet airplane
But not after daddy clipped her little ol' wings
It's high time you quit your lowdown ways.

Well, I'm sick and tired of wakin' up sick and tired
As of today there's gonna be some changes made
Well you might as well keep your feet on the ground
Girl I won't stand still for your movin' around.
It's high time you quit your lowdown ways
Honey it's high time you quit your lowdown ways
