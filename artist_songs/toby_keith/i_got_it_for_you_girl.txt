C'mon baby lay back down 
You don't have to leave right now 
Anything you got downtown...can wait 

I love those high heel shoes 
Everything looks good on you 
You make it look brand new...everyday 

[Chorus] 
I've got it, in a bad way 
I wanna kiss your sweet face 
And lay like this forever 
I need you, to need me 
Complete my world 
I got it for you girl 

Baby I can hear your breathe 
Whisper softly on my chest 
And I can feel your sweat...all over me 

The sheets stuck to your skin 
You give me that want to grin 
Baby I want to...again 

[Chorus] 
I've got it, in a bad way 
I wanna kiss your sweet face 
And lay like this forever 
I need you, to need me 
Complete my world 
I got it for you girl 

Everything you dreamed of 
Just lay right here and sleep on 
Never gonna have to want again 
I got it for you girl 
Oh I need you, to need me 
Complete my world 
I got it for you 
Wanna give it to you 
I got it for you girl
