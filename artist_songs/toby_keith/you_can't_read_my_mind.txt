Why'd you have to wear that dress this evening
And those high heels with those buckles on your feet?
I love the way your hair falls down across your shoulders
But you ain't gonna hear that from me

You got my heart racing like a freight train
Wishin' you and me were somewhere else
I know how good it's gonna be when we get to where we're goin'
Think I'd better keep it to myself

'Cause baby, I can't tell you what I'm thinking
I've had way too much to drink tonight
Oh, this is where I usually say something out of line
Just be glad that right now you can't read my mind

Every time we dance we're getting closer
And I'd like too say a thing or two about it
But trust me you don't wanna get me talkin'
I'm better off just dancin' all around it

'Cause baby, I can't tell you what I'm thinking
I've had way too much to drink tonight
Oh, this is where I usually say something out of line
Just be glad that right now you can't read my mind

'Cause baby I can't tell you what I'm thinking
I've had way too much to drink tonight
Oh, this is where I usually say something out of line
Just be glad that right now you can't read my mind

Oh, the road to love is paid with good intentions
Just be glad that right now you can't read my mind
Just be glad that right now you can't read my mind
