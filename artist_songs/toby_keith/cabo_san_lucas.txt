Girl the last time you saw me I wasn't this cool 
And i'm hangin' out in mexico down by the pool 
In cabo, cabo san lucas 
If I send you a ticket would you fly in? 
I'd sure like to see you we could hook up again 
In cabo, cabo san lucas 

[Chorus]
I know it sounds crazy, but I bought a guitar 
And i'm singing my songs downtown in a bar 
You can come with a friend, you can come by yourself 
You can sleep here with me, I ain't got nobody else 
In cabo, cabo san lucas 

Well the baja gets hot this time of year 
And except for the fisherman, they all disappear 
In cabo, cabo san lucas 
Pacifico is great, tequila is too 
I got it all goin, but I ain't got you 
In cabo, cabo san lucas 

[Repeat Chorus]

I'll show you the stars and the moon on the sea of cortez 
And the beach at san juan as the sun's sinking down in the west 
I'm leavin' you this message, and if you give a damn 
And you wanna call me you know where I am in cabo, cabosan lucas 
Way down in mexico 
Way down in cabo
