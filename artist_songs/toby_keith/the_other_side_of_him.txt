Standing on the other side of him, a little dress I didn't know.
Something new done to her hair, was a girl I used to hold.
As close as we once were, further than I've ever been.
She's a million miles away standing on the other side of him.

Nothing but a ghost of the love we used to know.
They say that's the way it goes when it don't go easy.
Guess I brought it on myself. She loves someone else.
And I can't help but wonder if she sees me

Standing on the other side of him, broken as I can be.
Wishing it was him standing on the other side of me.
I don't have to wonder where she is, who she's with, or how she's been.
I see all I need to see standing on the other side of him.

Nothing but a ghost of the love we used to know.
They say that's the way it goes when it don't go easy.
Guess I brought it on myself. She loves someone else.
And I can't help but wonder if she sees me.

Standing on the other side of him. Further than I've ever been.
She's a million miles away, standing on the other side of him.

Oh, oh.
