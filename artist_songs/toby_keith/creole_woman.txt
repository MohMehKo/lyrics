I stopped in Thibodeaux, Roadhouse in Louisian 
I wasn't stayin' long, I was a wanted man 
The aire was thick with danger, I watched the vixens dance 
My six gun in my pocket, my pistol in my pants 
I let her walk up on me, she pinned me to the door 
She said she swore she knew me, we'd never met before 
She pressed up hard against me, I stared into her eyes 
She grabbed my face and kissed me, she had me hypnotized 

[Chorus]
I'm runnin' down the road, can't find the interstate 
It's like I'm being followed and I can't get away 
The snakes and alligators, they whisper in the wind 
I hear her calling to me, I turn around again 
Cry of a Creole woman 
Woke up the devil down in me 

She took me to her bedroom, smelled like a cheap hotel 
Never had a Cajun queen, I'm used to Southern belles 
But through the smoky billows of my tobacco leaves 
I watched her in the mirror as she was lovin' me 

[Repeat Chorus]

What's this you wicked woman, some kind of voodoo game? 
Hell I haven't slept since Thursday, don't even know your name 
This spell you got me under, got just one remedy 
Just like a poison potion, that goes down smooth and sweet 

[Repeat Chorus]
