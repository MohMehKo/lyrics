He's flying high tonight 
He's got a brand new lover
Here you come a-runnin'
You're looking for some cover
I know you're sad and lonely 
I know you're feeling blue
You miss him so much 
Oh let me get to close to you

Oh, he ain't worth missing
Oh, we should be kissing
Stop all this foolish wishing
He ain't worth missing
I know your head is turning
I know your heart is burning
Girl, you gotta listen
Don't you know he ain't worth missing

You know I'm here to save you
But you ain't through crying yet
Look at your pretty face
All red and soaking wet
I'm gonna try and make him 
Just a memory
Come on baby, let's get started
First thing you got to see

Oh, he ain't worth missing
Oh, we should be kissing
Stop all this foolish wishing
He ain't worth missing
I know your head is turning
I know your heart is burning
Girl, you gotta listen
Don't you know he ain't worth missing

If you need someone to hold you
Someone to ease your pain
Well, I'll be holding steady
Girl when you get ready
I'm gonna show you
Love is a good thing

Oh, he ain't worth missing
Oh, we should be kissing
Stop all this foolish wishing
He ain't worth missing
I know your head is turning
I know your heart is burning
Girl, you gotta listen
Don't you know he ain't worth missing

Oh, he ain't worth missing
Oh, we should be kissing
Stop all this foolish wishing
He ain't worth missing
I know your head is turning
I know your heart is burning
Girl, you gotta listen
Don't you know he ain't worth missing
