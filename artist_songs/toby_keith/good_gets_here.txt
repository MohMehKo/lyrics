She said, "What makes you think
You could be my one and only?
How do I know you just won't
Leave me lonely?
I been lookin' for someone
To call mine."
Girl, if I ain't it
I'm a pretty good waste of time

Hey, I ain't bad, I do alright
Dig a ditch or dig on me tonight
I'm good for a laugh
Good for a beer
Baby, I'm good 'till
Good gets here

I don't know what tomorrow holds
But I can hold you now
You can miss a lot of livin'
Chasin' love around
Baby, I'm all yours
If you want me
Come and get me
I'll give it a go
Baby, if you let me

I ain't bad, I do alright
Dig a ditch or dig on me tonight
I'm good for a laugh
Good for a beer
Baby, I'm good 'till
Good gets here

Now if you need a simpler man
I probably ain't that guy
But baby, I can save your day
'Till he comes by and by

I ain't bad, I do alright
Dig a ditch or dig on me tonight
I'm good for a laugh
Good for a beer
Baby, I'm good 'till
Good gets here

I ain't bad, I do alright
Dig a ditch or dig on me tonight
I'm good for a laugh
Good for a beer
Baby, I'm good 'till
Good gets here
