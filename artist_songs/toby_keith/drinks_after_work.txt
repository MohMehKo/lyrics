Talk on the phone, stare at the screen,
Doin' the job, livin' the dream,
Gettin' paid, 
Yeah right.
Thinkin' about what I'll say to prove
That we should go out for a laugh or two
'Stead of going home tonight.

[chorus]
From a long day, no break,
We made it to the middle of the week
And I'm thinking that I'm probably gonna need
To get to know you casually.
Just having fun, two for one, 
Let's watch a good time get a little better.
Ain't no ball and chain for the suits and skirts
Just drinks after work,
Drinks after work.
Tell me what's it gonna hurt,
To have a little drink after work?

Happy hour's like a holiday,
Hanging with you's like getting away,
Let's conversate 
For a little while.
Well, keep me company, catch me up 
It's a whole lot better than being stuck
In a drive-time 9 to 5
I'd rather see you smile.

[chorus]

[bridge]
Well, it's been a long day
And the boss don't get it.
Don't you wanna take the edge off
With some 7 and 7? 
Just crushin' on a friend
Tell me what's it gonna hurt
Sippin' and tippin' some drinks after work? 

[tag chorus]
A long day, no break
We made it to the middle of the week
And I'm thinking that I'm probably gonna need
To get to know you casually.
Just having fun, two for one
Let's watch a good time get a little better.
Ain't no ball and chain for the suits and skirts
Just drinks after work,
Drinks after work.
What's it gonna hurt,
To have a little drink after work?
