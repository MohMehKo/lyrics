My neighbor carl, he lives next door 
Pink flamingos on his porch 
At night he teaches driving school 
And he sits out by his plastic pool 

He takes off his shirt he opens up a cold one 
Old Carls Deans a fool but it takes one to know one 

[Chorus:]
Musics playin up and down the block 
Mostly chirstian blues, country folk and southern rock 
It's a little piece of paradise way out here in the woods 
There's always something going on down in the trailerhood 

Across the street there's gambling Jane who's always got the poker game 
If you care to try your luck you can buy a seat for 15 bucks 
You can call to raise or you can check and fold 'em 
I like five card stud but it's moslty texas hold 'em 

[Chorus]

My new tattoos and farmer tans, rodeo and nascar fans 
Dallas Cowboy football on TV 
When the storm starts gettig bad, you hear the those sirens humming 
Grab a six pack and a lawn chair there's a tornado coming 

.... alright .... 

[Chorus]

I got 'er made in the shade with the moonshine lemonade 
There's a party going on down in the trailerhood 

Bring me another beer Momma
