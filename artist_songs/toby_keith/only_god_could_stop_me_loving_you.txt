We saw the moon in Colorado
Made music in Tennessee
We found the gold of El Dorado
It's so good, making love, you and me

These arms, they will never hold another
These eyes, they are blind to any other
And these lips, no other boy will ever kiss
And this heart, it will always feel like this

Only God could stop me loving you
Only God could tell me not to
He sent you from Heaven
Just to make my dreams come true
When he opened the door
That you came walking through
Only God could stop me loving you

Now we struck oil in Oklahoma
And won the Oscar in Hollywood
And climbed the canyons of Arizona
And baby, making love never felt so god

These arms, they will never hold another
These eyes, they are blind to any other
And these lips, no other boy will ever kiss
And this heart, it will always feel like this

Only God could stop me loving you
Only God could tell me not to
He sent you from Heaven
Just to make my dreams come true
When he opened the door
That you came walking through
Only God could stop me loving you

Only God could stop me loving you
Only God could stop me loving
Loving you, loving you, loving you, loving you
