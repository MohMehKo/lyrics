Sometimes I lie awake
Starring at the ceiling
I'll have someone beside me
But she won't know your name
She won't be here long
Hell she's almost a memory
You'll never be really gone
Girl, are you feelin' me?

[Chorus]
Do you fall asleep missin' my kiss in the dark?
Wake up the next morning not sure where you are?
Is it killin' you, like it's killin' me?
Are you lying there, lying to somebody else?
Trying to find the one thing I can't find for myself?
When he's touching you, really touching you,
Are you feelin' me?

You ever wish on a star that ain't fallin',
Hoping you dreams will come true?
Pray for the day that you know it's comin,
well I do, baby I do, baby I do
Baby I do

[Chorus]
Do you fall asleep missin' my kiss in the dark?
Wake up the next morning not sure where you are?
Is it killin' you, like it's killin' me?
Are you lying there, lying to somebody else?
Trying to find the one thing I can't find for myself?
When he's touching you, really touching you,
Are you feelin' me?

Oh, when he's touching you, are you feelin' me?
Are you feelin' me?
Are you feelin' me?
Oh, are you feelin' me?
Girl, are you feelin' me?
Oh, when he's touching you
