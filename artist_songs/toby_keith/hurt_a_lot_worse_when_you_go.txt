Go on and call me up. 
Tell me you made a grave mistake. 
You know I never once turned you away. 

Bad as I hate to say, 
I know how good it's gonna be. 
If just for a night, I lay you down by me. 

And you lie. 
Like you wont say goodbye. 
Like you do every time. 

Come here and kiss me 
And act like you miss me. 
Make me believe we're together. 
Come here and hold me 
And baby control me. 
Touch me like you'll be here forever. 
You never cut me deep enough to tell you no. 
Ohhhh 
Tell me you love me, 
It'll hurt a lot worse when you go. 

I'm not what you want. 
No, I'm not ever gonna be. 
More than someone you come to in need. 

And you lie. 
Like you wont say goodbye. 
Like you do every time. 

Come here and kiss me 
And act like you miss me. 
Make me believe we're together. 
Come here and hold me 
And baby control me. 
Touch me like you'll be here forever. 
You never cut me deep enough to tell you no. 
Ohhhh 
Tell me you love me. 
It'll hurt a lot worse when you go. 

You never cut me deep enough to tell you no. 
Ohhhh. 
Tell me you love me. 
It'll hurt a lot worse when you no. 

Girl, tell me you love me. 
It'll hurt a lot worse when you go.
