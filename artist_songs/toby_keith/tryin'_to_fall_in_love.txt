If women come a dime a dozen, I ain’t got a penny
Some guys are gettin’ way too much, some guys don’t get any
But if I had a nickel for every time I’d had enough
I’d still be busted and heartbroken still be tryin’ to fall in love

I fell in love with Linda she didn’t love me back
I went crazy over Chrissy, she went crazy over Jack
Maria down in Mexico, my Spanish Mona Lisa
Tried to fly her back to Texas but she did not have a visa

If women come a dime a dozen, I ain’t got a penny
Some guys are gettin’ way too much, some guys don’t get any
But if I had a nickel for every time I’d had enough
I’d still be busted and heartbroken still be tryin’ to fall in love

Bought Renee a dozen roses, all she did was make me beg
Displayed my love for Donna with a tattoo on my leg
There’s a tree where me and Carla carved our names with a pocket knife
But like our love it burned down with a lightning strike

If women come a dime a dozen, I ain’t got a penny
Some guys are gettin’ way too much, some guys don’t get any
But if I had a nickel for every time I’d had enough
I’d still be busted and heartbroken still be tryin’ to fall in love

Why does everybody say there’s lots of fish out in the sea?
When I’m swimming after women they’re all laid up on the beach

If women come a dime a dozen, I ain’t got a penny
Some guys are gettin’ way too much, some guys don’t get any
But if I had a nickel for every time I’d had enough
I’d still be busted and heartbroken still be tryin’ to fall in love
Yeah busted and heartbroken still be tryin’ to fall in love
