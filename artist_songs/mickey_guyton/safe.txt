The storm is calling, rain's falling down like tears
The water's rising, bringing on my darkest fears
I need a lighthouse, someone to guide my way
Oh, just wrap your arms around me, let me know I'm safe

Sometimes it's heavy, this life can be so cold
Sometimes I feel lost, can't seem to get back home
I need a compass, someone to guide my way
Oh, just wrap your arms around me, let me know I'm safe

Come on love, show me love, take this crying from my eyes
Come on love, show me love, I could use some tonight
All the daylight's fading, my hope is slippin' away
Oh, baby wrap your arms around me, let me know I'm safe

Come on love, show me love, take this crying from my eyes
Come on love, show me love, I could use some tonight
All the daylight's fading, my hope is slippin' away
Oh, just wrap your arms around me, let me know I'm safe

Oh, please wrap your arms around me, let me know I'm safe
Let me know I'm safe
