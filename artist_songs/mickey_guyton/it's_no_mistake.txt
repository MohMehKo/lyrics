Ever since I met you,
I'm all about you.
Never wrote a love song,
until I felt you.
Feelin' like the new me.
Fit together perfect.
All the time I waited,
but you were worth it.

I knew that,
the minute you walked in,
there's no doubt,
that I don't wanna live without you.

It's no mistake,
I am with you.
I love the way,
you do what you do.

One look at your face,
and I knew right away.
It's no mistake,
I am with you.

We don't need a party,
to keep dancin'.
Bein' in your arms,
is like livin' in a mansion.
So fancy,
I couldn't imagine.
I don't wanna sleep,
cause I'll miss out on the action.

I knew that,
the minute you walked in,
there's no doubt,
that I don't wanna live without you.

It's no mistake,
I am with you.
I love the way,
you do what you do.

One look at your face,
and I knew right away.
It's no mistake,
I am with you.

ooooooooh
ooooooooh

It's no mistake,
I am with you.
I love the way,
you do what you do.

One look at your face,
and I knew right away.
It's no mistake,
I am with you.

One look at your face,
and I knew right away.
It's no mistake,
I am with you.

It's no mistake,
I am with you.

I am with you.

It's no mistake...
