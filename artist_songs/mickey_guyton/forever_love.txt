Everyday is an endless summer
Every night with you is a dream
With us it's all or nothing
Ain't no in between
Let's keep the music playing
Playing out our love song
Safe inside your arms
Is right where I belong
I never felt like this, oh
With just one kiss

It happened so fast
Oh, before I knew it
We were dancing in the moonlight
Let's make this last
Breathe in every moment
Boy, it's gonna be different this time
Baby, have you ever
Ever felt forever love

Boy, I wanna fix you dinner
Open up a bottle of wine
Yeah, get a little too close
Maybe see a few sparks fly
When you're laying there beside me
The only thing I wanna do
Underneath this lone star sky
Is lose myself in you
Over and over again
It was only a matter of when

It happened so fast
Oh, before I knew it
We were dancing in the moonlight
Let's make this last
Breathe in every moment
Boy, it's gonna be different this time
Baby, have you ever
Ever felt forever love
Forever love, oh
Oh, forever love

What I thought was love
Was one long string of maybes
I've been broken too
But I never let it break me
Then you saved me
Oh, you saved me

It happened so fast
Oh, before I knew it
We were dancing in the moonlight
We're making it last
Breathe in every moment
Boy, I know it's different this time
Baby, have you ever
Ever felt forever love
Forever love
Oh, forever love

This is forever love
Oh, this is forever love
