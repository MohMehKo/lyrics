You got the perfect dress waiting on a hanger
The kind that makes you feel a little dangerous
Don't you know you're gonna drive those boys right out of their minds
Hey, don't you know it's high time that you shine

So, put the top down on your pretty little mustang
Oh, roll through town like you own the whole thing
Making heads turn, making hearts spin, flying like the wild wind
In your pretty little mustang
Yeah, your pretty little mustang

Go on and light up the dark just like a firefly
Drop every jaw in the room when you walk by
Only like the sky owns the stars and the moon
Make them all breathlessly want more and more of you

So, put the top down on your pretty little mustang
Oh, drive it like you stole it, like you're making a getaway
Making heads turn, making hearts spin, flying like the wild wind
Yeah, your pretty little mustang
Yeah, your pretty little mustang

You got the perfect dress waiting on a hanger
Oh, put the top down, put the top down

Put the top down on your pretty little mustang
Oh, roll through town like you own the whole thing
Making heads turn, making hearts spin, flying like the wild wind

Oh, put the top down on your pretty little mustang
Oh, roll through town like you own the whole damn thing
Making heads turn, making hearts spin, flying like the wild wind
In your pretty little mustang
Yeah, your pretty little mustang

Oh, your pretty little mustang
