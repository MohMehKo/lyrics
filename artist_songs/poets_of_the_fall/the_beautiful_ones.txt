Flies with a broken wing, she's ever so graceful, so like an angel,
but I see, tears flow quietly.

The struggle she's seen this spring, when nothing comes dancing,
paying a handsome fee, and still she smiles at me.

And I can't take it, no I can't help but wonder...

Why do we sacrifice the beautiful ones?
How do you break a heart of gold?
Why do we sacrifice our beautiful souls?
Heroes of tales unsung, untold.

Sweet as an angel sings, she gives though she has none left but the last one, free, unhesitatingly.

And I am humbled, I'm a broken mirror, and I can't help but wonder...

Why do we sacrifice the beautiful ones?
How do you break a heart of gold?
Why do we sacrifice our beautiful souls?
Heroes of tales unsung, untold.

Why do we sacrifice the beautiful ones?
Why when they walk with love alone?
Why do we sacrifice our beautiful souls?
Just trying to find their way home.
