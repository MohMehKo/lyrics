More in my face than is my taste 
I grow so weary I'll surrender 
to what they say Let them lead the way 
Till' I can no longer remember 
my darling dreams Prewritten scenes, 
whatever felt my own 
So to save face I'll take my place 
Where I may safely feel alone 

Glad the waters are so shallow 
When the river runs so cold 
Glad the waters are so shallow 
When the river runs cold 
Glad the waters are so shallow 
When the river runs so cold 
Glad the waters are so shallow 
When the river runs cold 

I'm quick to wait, and so to hate 
They call me gracious for my patience 
And I feel proud under that shroud 
And all the while it's all evasion 

Some humor here to fend off fear 
And I'm a little more lost, oh dear 
So to save face I'll hold my place 
So I may safely feel alone 

Glad the waters are so shallow 
When the river runs so cold 
Glad the waters are so shallow 
When the river runs cold 
Glad the waters are so shallow 
When the river runs so cold 
Glad the waters are so shallow 
When the river runs cold
