We can't seem to let go
The thread's so thin it just doesn't show anymore
It seems like we're playing charades
Playing like we're afraid to live

And this is one sacrifice I don't want to make

If there's no end
There can be no beginning, 
There can be no beginning
If there's no end
It feels like forsaking the dawn, 
We awaken and still we don't see
I am still secretly grateful you're living this moment with me

We can see where it leads
It's like you can't, 
Can't kill the monster that feeds on you
No matter what you do it seems to get you every time

And that's a predicament if I know anything

If there's no end
There can be no beginning, 
There can be no beginning
If there's no end
It feels like forsaking the dawn, 
We awaken and still we don't see
I'm still secretly grateful you're living this moment with me
Secretly grateful you're sharing this moment with me

If it's just one life we're given, 
One time you're living...

I feel your touch light up a wild desire
Borne on my ache to take us ever higher
In our love we are birds of prey
Every cry serves to lead astray

So carry my ache and you will know the feeling
Inside I am weak but for this love I'm bearing
So breathe your life in my shades of grey
Or kill the lights and we'll fade away
