I want to feel the sun shine
On my face like a new day's just begun
And I'll steal a moment's fun
And reflect on all those days long dead and gone

The memories still rock my cradle
Yesterdays sing me a lullaby

I can't fight it
It takes me back
To the days when you and I ran free of worries
Underneath the wide, clear, blue sky

I'll never be the one, no
To regret the things that I have never done
And I'll reason with, with myself till I no longer feel the need to justify

I can't fight it
It takes me back
And I remember reaching high,
like borne on wings of sheer belief through my clear blue sky

Thinking 'bout the times we had
All our days in the sun
Memories now brilliant and mad
They still linger on

Can't fight it
It takes me back
To the days when you and I ran free of worries
Underneath the wide, clear, blue sky

I can't fight it
It takes me back
And I remember reaching high,
like borne on wings of sheer belief through my clear blue sky
