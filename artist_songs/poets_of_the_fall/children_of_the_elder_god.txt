Warriors, torchbearers, come redeem our dreams 
Shine a light upon this night of otherworldly fiends 
Odin's might be your guide, divorce you from the sane 
Hammer's way will have its say, rise up in their name 

Oh, Memory and Thought
Jet black and clawed 

Children of the Elder God
Scourge of light upon the dark 

Scratching hag, you can rake your claws and gnash your crooked teeth 
You've taken slaves like ocean waves, now feel the ocean seethe 
Father Thor, bless this war, between the dark and light 
In their songs let their wrongs bring dissolution's night 

Oh, Memory and Thought
Jet black and clawed 

Children of the Elder God
Scourge of light upon the dark
