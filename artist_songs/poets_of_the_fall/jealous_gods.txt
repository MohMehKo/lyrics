Can you feel the void between us
Nothing there but light, yet it seems like the weight of the world
Keeping us here in the dark
If I allow our blessings define us
Bearing the scars of our loss like it's all we deserve
When passions we hold will depart

If I could build a bridge between us
Arcs of soaring rainbows
Strength of mother earth
Would it fill our hearts

If I instilled a faith to guide us
Blind and sweet like free flow
A seed in every word
Could we lose the facades
Are we just jealous gods

With every wall ablaze around us
Calling out your name like it's now and never surrender
Victory is yours to claim
By every trick of light by sleight of hand
That makes a miracle reality right where you stand
They got their claws in good and deep
So you see there ain't no placing the blame

And so I'll build a bridge between us
Arcs of soaring rainbows
Strength of mother earth
For a brand new start

And instil new faith to guide us
Blind and sweet like free flow
With every single word

We won't go down as frauds
Like jealous gods
Like jealous gods
We are the perfect flaws
Perfect with our flaws
Just jealous gods
Just jealous gods
We're the perfect flaws
The perfect flaws

I can sense your apprehension
Fear for naught for I'm here and I'm made of your love
Found in the quick of things

And we can walk the bridge between us
Arcs of soaring rainbows
Strength of mother earth
Let it fill our hearts

And instil a faith to guide us
Blind and sweet like free flow
There's a joy for every hurt

Forgiveness in the flaws
Even for jealous gods
