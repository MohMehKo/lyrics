When you leave the world behind
Lock the doors and turn the lights down
Whispers, schemes, resigned
And you haven't got the will
To try and fight
Do you see how it's your thoughts
Come conjuring?
Emotions show the world
You keep within

So weave the world a play
Such turns of fate
To let you have your way
Lest the only one betrayed
Will be standing center stage

A dream's a deed unsigned
A nameless ghost of yesterday defied
So the answers aren't streamlined
To open up before you pay to try
And it's all seen through your lenses
Coloring
The images you call
To give you wings

So weave the world a play
Such turns of fate
To let you have your way
Lest the only one betrayed
Will be standing center stage

Like a thread from a seam
Drawn away to reveal
That we all make this dream
And sometimes it feels so real
Do you see how it's your thoughts
Come conjuring?
Emotions show the world
You keep within

So weave the world a play
Such turns of fate
To let you have your way
Lest the only one betrayed
Will be standing center stage
