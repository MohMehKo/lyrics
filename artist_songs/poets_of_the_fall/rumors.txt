Like whispered hot secrets your restless dreams will fade away
In still life like motion slow through the frantic rush of the day
With lackeys of lust crowding the streets

N' I know they would steal your heart to see my love tortured
Render trust a hostage to fortune
Rumors seduce like fire
[x2]

Seducing illusions driving the chariot of hearts astray
Standing silent vigil over the moments of ease that still remain
With a thorn to the side for every good deed

N' I know they would steal your heartâ€¦
Oooh...

Every day is a day we awake into this life
Another chance another line to define
And we will dance, we will play, and experience a lifetime
Every day is a day we die

Cos I know they would steal your heart...

N' I know they would steal your heart to see my love tortured
Render trust a hostage to fortune
Rumors seduce like wildfire

Steal your heart to see my love tortured...
