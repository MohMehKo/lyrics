What is beauty compared to grief
What is joy in league with sorrow
A dead rushes' fleet drifting on a quiet tide

N' does a sunset know its worth
Making yesterday tomorrow
Is there a silence on this earth before every tear's been cried

For you, for you
I would bring down the heavens on this earth
For you, for you
I would even trust the devil for rebirth

With every road once paved with gold
Both hands with a heart to hold
How could we look past all the stories we have told

Could we lose ourselves again
In a childlike faith
Trust the wishing well, dance like Tinker Bell

For you, for you
I would walk forever through this barren land
For you, for you
I would hold a deadly viper in my hand

For you, for you
I would bring down the heavens on this earth
For you, for you
I would even trust the devil for rebirth
