Some people never
Settle for the one
One love forever
Searching for the sun
Heat-blasted faces
Promises at dawn
A constant flux of stages
Before they're gone

How do you live so gracefully?
(And would you show me)
How can I save the child in me?
(A world the child would see)
How do you fault so gracefully?
Serenity in a shattered world
The child in me

Harlos by the half-moon
Charlatans by wine
Seeking out your pleasure
The sweet concubine
That abrasive acquaintance
It's a wonder how we fall
Stopping at these stations before they're gone

How do you live so gracefully?
(And would you show me)
How can I save the child in me?
(A world the child would see)
How do you fault so gracefully?
Serenity in a shattered world
The child in me

I've been waiting
Feel the love rebuilding
Off the edge now
Falling down
'Cause I've been waiting
I've been biding my time
On the edge now
Falling down

How do you live so gracefully?
(And would you show me)
How can I save the child in me?
(A world the child would see)
How do you fault so gracefully?
Serenity in a shattered world
The child in me
The child in me
The child in me
