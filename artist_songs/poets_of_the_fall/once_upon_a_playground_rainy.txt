Hello old lovers of mine
My little boy wishes
Of fortune's kisses
Now dreams cast aside

In the fading light
Your crown of thorns
Becomes a halo
Of branching horns
And yet so beautiful

I see you gently swaying
In a sea of seesaws
Slumming in the shack
Tony built last year
I know you'll be holding
Court with jackdaws
Crying when nobody
Ever sees your tears
When no one sees your tears

What used to fly us from here
To the stratosphere?
What became of our passion
Is there no one who cares?
Hear the soft minor key
Of the one-time me
Still the acrobat
With my heart on my sleeve
And it's so beautiful

I see you gently swaying
In a sea of seesaws
Slumming in the shack
Tony built last year
I know you'll be holding
Court with jackdaws
Crying when nobody
Ever sees your tears
When no one sees your tears

Out back
When the gates are closed
Like a pitiful skeleton pose
We held our first line of defense
Saw our likeness
And it made no sense
Toy soldiers in the muck and dirt
Salvation in your every word
Lost in the fray of everyday

I see you gently swaying
In a sea of seesaws
Slumming in the shack
Tony built last year
I know you'll be holding
Court with jackdaws
Crying when nobody
Ever sees your tears
When no one sees your tears

You're still fighting, I see
Like a modern day Bruce Lee
Standing proud in this parody
