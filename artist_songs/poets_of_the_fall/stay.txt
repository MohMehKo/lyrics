Morning comes slow today 
Memories push through from yesterday 
Where will I be tomorrow 
What do I have to show 

From my life 
Stay 
I need you here for a new day to break 
Stay 
I want you near like a shadow in my wake 

Flow with life down the drain 
Memories and force of will sustain 
Where will I be tomorrow 
What will be left to show 

From my life 
Stay 
I need you here for a new day to break 
Stay 
I want you near like a shadow in my wake 

It's the little things 
Little things 
Little things 
That make the world 

Stay 
I need you here for a new day to break 
Stay 
I want you near like a shadow in my wake
