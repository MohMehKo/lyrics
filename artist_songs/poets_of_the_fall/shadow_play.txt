I can feel it in the air
I can feel it young and strong
Like an intoxicating dare
(Like an intoxicating dare)
For some residue of joy
Simple pleasures and delights
Would you buy that ruthless ploy
Would you buy that ploy?
Mark my words
It's not quite what you thought

Shadow play
Directed by you
Love portrays Ms. Take
The Oscar goes to hate
Dragons slain
The princess rescued
It's all what you create
Your shadows will be played

And here now comes the sweet caress
Unreality to guide us
With a forceful righteousness
(With a forceful righteousness)
And you can taste the kiss of death
More divine than breath I know
Always just the right address
Just the right caress
Mark my words
It's not quite what you thought

Shadow play
Directed by you
Love portrays Ms. Take
The Oscar goes to hate
Dragons slain
The princess rescued
It's all what you create
Your shadows will be played

So this is what you think you need
To play the game
A pretty royal flush
Of second hand fame
For proof of excellence
For critical acclaim
Aloof preeminence
Preceding your pen name
Clich√©s of violence
And off mark blame
Some character flaws
To masticate the shame
Sex in a dress in a wide array
Sex in a suit, hello, happy birthday
Mark my words
It's never what you thought

Shadow play
Directed by you
Love portrays Ms. Take
The Oscar goes to hate
Dragons slain
The princess rescued
It's all what you create
Your shadows will be played
It's all what you create
Your shadows will be played
