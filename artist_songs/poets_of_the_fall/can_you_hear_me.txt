Hiding deep within, doors cry opening
Lead into the light of love deep like the sea
Rich in variety, heartfelt and open, wide like a life, unique, yet so alike

Can you hear me, I know I'm just a whisper
Can you hear me, brother mine, sweet sister
Love will find an answer

You flow inside of me, language and imagery, pure in simplicity
Thirsting for unity, realized harmony,
No need to hide away your life, unique, yet so alike

Can you hear me...

There's yet life in these words I speak for peace of mind and our release, 
And you can have what you want if you want it like you need to breathe, 
like you need to breathe, like you need to breathe
Embrace reality

Can you hear me, I know I'm just a whisper
Can you hear me, brother mine, sweet sister
Love will find an answer
