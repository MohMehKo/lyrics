The same great light that broke the dark
The same great peace that calmed the seas
Hallelujah, is living in me

The same great love that gives us breath
The same great power that conquered death
Hallelujah, is flowing through me

And what, what if I believed in Your power
And I really lived it
What, what if I believed Christ in me
What if I believed

I would lay my worries down
See these hills as level ground
What if I believed, Christ in me

The same great love that casts out fear
The same compassion that draws us near
Hallelujah, is living in me yeah

The same great mercy that I received
Amazing grace for a wretch like me
Hallelujah, is flowing through me

And what, what if I believed in Your power
And I really lived it
What, what if I believed, Christ in me
What if I believed

I would lay my worries down
See these hills as level ground
What if I believed, Christ in me
Oh, I would praise You with my life
Let my story lift You high
What if I believed, Christ in me
What if I believed, Christ in me

And what, what if I believed in Your power
And I really lived it
What, what if I believed, Christ in me
What if I believed

I would lay my worries down
And I'd see these hills as level ground
What if I believed, Christ in me
Oh, I would praise You with my life
Let my story lift You high
What if I believed, Christ in me
What if I believed, Christ in me
What if I believed, Christ in me
