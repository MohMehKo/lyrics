Everybody waits for the moment the bride comes out
Open up the doors and watch her walk down the aisle
Is she lovely, is she shining, is she looking at the one she loves?
Everybody's watching, what are we all about
When we open up the doors is religion all that walks out
Are we lovely, are we shining, are we looking at the One we love
Or is His glory divided 'cause we're looking at ourselves too much?

Let's be beautiful
With love so radical
Full of compassion
Oh what would happen
If we were powerful
From grace that overflows
Love into action
Oh what would happen
If we were beautiful
Beautiful

We could be the body of the invisible God
Shining like a light in places where hope is gone
Are we courageous, are we fearless, are we following the One we love?
With love contagious, that frees us, to hope and to trust

Let's be beautiful
With love so radical
Full of compassion
Oh what would happen
If we were powerful
From grace that overflows
Love into action
Oh what would happen
If we were beautiful

Oh there, a revolution has begun
Oh there, a revolution is His love
Oh, come on, let's leave our fears here at the door
Oh, come on, we're invited to more

So let's be beautiful
Let's be beautiful
Let us be
Come on, come on

Let's be beautiful
With love so radical
Let us be
Oh, let's be beautiful

Let's be beautiful
With love so radical
Full of compassion
Oh what would happen
If we were powerful
From grace that overflows
Love into action
Oh what would happen
If we were beautiful
If we were beautiful

Let us be beautiful
Come on, come on
Let's be beautiful
