You are the air held in our lungs
It's not enough if we're not breathing.
What good is a song stuck in a heart,
If we don't sing, the stones start screaming.
Open up our eyes, make what we have inside be

More than just believing, more than words we say,
Oh, we are Yours, it's Your revolution,
Lead on, we will follow, Your love stirs our soul
Take us where You want to go, it's Your revolution

You walk ahead, we fall behind,
The further we fade into the darkness.
And for all the times we run ahead,
Call us back to where Your heart is.
So open up our eyes, so what we have inside is

More than just believing, more than words we say,
Oh, we are Yours, it's Your revolution,
Lead on, we will follow, Your love stirs our soul
Take us where You want to go, it's Your revolution

Oh, this could be the journey of a lifetime
Oh, we want to be tethered to Your timeline 'til what we have inside is

More than just believing, more than words we say,
Oh, we are Yours
Lead on, we will follow, Your love stirs our soul
Take us where You want to go, it's Your revolution

More than just believing, more than words we say,
Oh, we are Yours, it's Your revolution,
Lead on, we will follow, Your love stirs our soul
Take us where You want to go, it's Your revolution

Whoa, it's Your revolution,
Whoa, it's Your revolution
