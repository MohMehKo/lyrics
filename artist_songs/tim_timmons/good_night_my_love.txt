Goodnight my child, goodnight my love. 
Always forever you'll be. 
Nothing you say, nothing you do 
Will ever change how I love you.

Goodnight my child, goodnight my love. 
Always forever you'll be. 
Nothing you say, nothing you do 
Will ever change how I love you.

Just as our God sings this song over us
I will pass this blessing down

Goodnight my child, goodnight my love 
Always forever you'll be 
Nothing you say nothing you do 
Will ever change the way how I love you
will ever change how I love you.
