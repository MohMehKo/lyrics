I'd be lying
If I said I wasn't tired of trying
And now I'm down to my last excuse
So here I am waiting for You

When I take the wheel and everything starts falling apart 
I start to wander off the road that leads to Your heart
Still there You are

In the broken, when I'm losing my way
When I'm lost in all the doubt and the shame
You remain, You remain

Sweet surrender
To know that I am Yours forever
And that You'll never leave me alone
You'll come running when I turn for home

I'll take the wheel and everything starts falling apart
I start to wander off the road that leads to Your heart
Still there You are

In the broken, when I'm losing my way
When I'm lost in all the doubt and the shame
You remain

And though the time keeps on ticking away
When the fire is gone
Hope is starting to fade
You remain, You remain
God, You remain

I've tried to do this now for so long on my own
You'd think I've figured this whole thing out some how
But just when I think I can fall faster further away
I turn around and there You are

In the broken, when I'm losing my way
When I'm lost in all the doubt and the shame
You remain

And though the time keeps on ticking away
When the fire is gone
Hope is starting to fade
You remain, You remain
God, You remain
