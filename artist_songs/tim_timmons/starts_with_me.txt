What can I do to leave a legacy?
How can I speak with authority
When I can't see You, I can't see You
How can I know the dreams You have for me?
How do I believe beyond what I have seen?
When I can't hear You, I can't feel You now
Oh no, no, no

[Chorus:]
You're my revival song, You start where I belong
On my knees, on my knees
When I am weak you're strong, You meet me here
When I'm on my knees, on my knees
Oh, it starts with me

Why do I try to work outside of You?
Knocking down doors I shouldn't be going through
Well, I'm so tired, I'm so tired
You take my burdens off of my shoulders
You break the lies that hold me back
So I'm not sure enough
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus:]
You're my revival song, You start where I belong
On my knees, on my knees
When I am weak you're strong, You meet me here
When I'm on my knees, on my knees
Yeah, it starts with me

I really wanna change the world
I really wanna sing Your song
But I know revival's got to start with me
I really wanna change the world
I really wanna sing Your song
But I know revival's got to start with me

[Chorus:]
You're my revival song, You start where I belong
On my knees, on my knees
When I am weak you're strong, You meet me here
When I'm on my knees, on my knees
You're my revival song, You start where I belong
On my knees, on my knees
When I am weak you're strong, You meet me here
When I'm on my knees, on my knees
It starts with me
