Everywhere I go on this road, high and low
Where I go, I go with You
And I won't be afraid, this my hope, come what may
Where I go I go with you

There's a city that calls me by name
There's a city that calls me by name
Yes, as I run this race I am cheered by the saints
There's a city that calls me by name

[Chorus:]
Everywhere I go on this road, high and low
Where I go, I go with You
I won't be afraid, this my hope, come what may
Where I go I go with you
Where I go I go with you

There's a future that runs through my veins
There's a future that runs through my veins
And there's nothing on earth that could stand in the way
There's a future that runs through my veins

[Chorus]

There's a Spirit I cannot contain
There's a Spirit I cannot contain
The same power that raised Jesus up from the grave
The same Spirit I cannot contain

[Chorus]

You're breath upon these bones
Your fire in my soul
Your kingdom is my home
So I don't walk alone
[x2]

[Chorus x2]

Everywhere where I go, I go with you [x4]
Where I go I go with you
