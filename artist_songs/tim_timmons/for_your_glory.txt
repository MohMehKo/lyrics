You are the story, beginning and end
Every moment in time with Your hands
Creation sings holy, holy for Your glory
Beginning and end

Even darkness cannot hide Your shining
Even shadows cannot change the truth

You're working, You're moving, in all things You're using
For glory, for Your glory God
You take joy in suffering and make it an offering
For glory, for Your glory

You are the promise here in our hearts
You wrote upon them all that You are
We cry holy, holy for Your glory
Here in our hearts

Even in the valley You're not shaken
Even silence cannot change the truth

You're working, You're moving, in all things You're using
For glory, for Your glory God
You take joy in suffering and make it an offering
For glory, for Your glory God

In our weakness in our fight
In the midst of every trial
Be lifted high, be lifted high
In the waiting in the fire
Every moment of our lives
Be lifted high, be lifted high

You're working, You're moving, in all things You're using
For glory, for Your glory God
You take joy in suffering and make it an offering
For glory, for Your glory

In our weakness in our fight
In the midst of every trial
Be lifted high, be lifted high
In the waiting in the fire
Every moment of our lives
Be lifted high, be lifted high

You're working, You're moving, in all things You're using
For glory, for Your glory God
You take joy in suffering and make it an offering
For glory, for Your glory
