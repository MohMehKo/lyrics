Sometimes I run and sometimes I crawl
Sometimes I'm standing still
Sometimes You whisper and sometimes You call
Sometimes the quiet kills
All I know is how, oh how I need You now

I will follow love
Every moment choosing
You above it all
At the risk of losing
Everything I hope I still believe

There is a peace and there is a war
Both running through my veins
One is a stream, and one is a storm
Both calling out my name
All I know is how, oh how I need You now

I will follow love
Every moment choosing
You above it all
At the risk of losing
Everything I hope I still believe

You are hope, You're the love undying
Wild like a fire that will keep me finding
Everything for good I still believe

You in the famine
I still believe, You in the feast
I still believe, You through the fire
I still believe, You are my peace
I still believe, You're in the silence
I still believe, You're ever near
I still believe, You in the fire
I choose to believe above the fear
'Cause I know Your kingdom is forever
It's already here but not quite yet
So I will believe You in my living
Yes I will believe You in my death

I will follow love
Every moment choosing
You above it all
At the risk of losing
Everything I hope I still believe

You are hope, You're the love undying
Wild like a fire that will keep me finding
Everything for good I still believe
Oh, all things for good, I still believe
