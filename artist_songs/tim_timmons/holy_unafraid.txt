Greater are You God
Who was, and is, and is to come
Greater than the darkness
In this world You overcome

We believe we are more than conquerors
Jesus, victory is Yours
We receive the gift You left for us

So we pray, pray, pray
Would You shake our souls awake
Holy Spirit open the gates
You lead the way
With power and strength
You send us in Your name
You're with us
Now we are made
Holy unafraid, holy unafraid

There's no one, nor thing, nor weapon
Formed that will prevail
With man it is impossible
But You are stronger still

We believe we are more than conquerors
Jesus, victory is Yours
We receive the gift You left for us

So we pray, pray, pray
Would You shake our souls awake
Holy Spirit open the gates
You lead the way
With power and strength
You send us in Your name
You're with us
Now we are made
Holy unafraid, holy unafraid

In Your love that's wide enough
We are holy
By Your power inside of us
We are unafraid
[x2]

So we pray, pray, pray
Would You shake our souls awake
Holy Spirit open the gates
You lead the way
With power and strength
You send us in Your name
You're with us
Now we are made
Holy unafraid, holy unafraid
Holy unafraid, holy unafraid
