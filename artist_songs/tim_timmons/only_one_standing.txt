I have tried to stand without Your power
Built my house on sand with my own mortar
And the ground below is quaking
I have looked to man for my approval
Built my confidence apart from You
And now all the walls are shaking
So I turn my eyes to the only hope I know

I surrender all
Would You tear down all these walls
That rise between us, blinding freedom
I surrender all
Would You let my kingdom fall
For Yours alone will be
The only one standing

I am made of dust, You are eternal
Worthy of my trust, faithful forever now
Never will You leave me, no
So I turn my eyes to the only hope I know

I surrender all
Would You tear down all these walls
That rise between us, blinding freedom
I surrender all
Would You let my kingdom fall
For Yours alone will be
The only one standing
Be the only one standing

Would You take back what is Yours
I cannot hold this
My feeble fortress
When there's resistance from my soul
Show me the night sky
Remind my pride of how powerful You are

I surrender all
Would You tear down all these walls
That rise between us, blinding freedom
I surrender all
Would You let my kingdom fall
For Yours alone will be
The only one standing
Be the only one standing
Be the only one standing
