Got my headlights shining
Down an old dirt road
Smoke my cigarettes
I should quit I know

The radio's playing
Old country songs
Someone's leaving, someone's cheating
On and on

I think I might like
The quiet nights
Of this empty life

[Chorus]
'Cause someday maybe
Somebody will love me like I need
And someday I won't have to prove
'Cause somebody will see
all my worth but until then
I'll do just fine on my own
With my cigarettes
And this old dirt road

See I left another
Good man tonight
I wonder if he'll miss me
Lord knows I tried

But I think that maybe
The thing that I did wrong
Was put up with his bullshit
For far too long

I think I might like
The quiet nights
Of this empty life

[Chorus]

I ain't gonna sleep
I don't wanna dream
About the things that I used to need
I ain't gonna cry
Or go on living lies
I'm just gonna drive

[Chorus 2x]
