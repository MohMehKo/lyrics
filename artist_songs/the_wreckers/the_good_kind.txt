Do you want to run away together
I would say it was your best line ever
Too bad I fell for it

And I walked alone
Waiting for you to come along
Take my tortured heart by the hand
And write me off

[Chorus]
Do you know I cry
Do you know I die
Do you know I cry
And it's not the good kind

You forced me to become strong 
When I just craved being weak

And you think you know
And I would like to think so
But do you know that when you go
I fall apart

[Chorus]

I'm tired of hiding 
Behind these lying eyes
I'm tired of this smile
That even I don't recognize

[Chorus 3x]

Do you know I cry
