I took off my iron smile babe
Cause I felt it weighed me down tomorrow when the world wakes up I'll be in another town
You don't know what you want at this moment could be me
You move your hand across my knee turn me into some novelty

I guess I'm one more girl on the stage
Just one more ass that got stuffed in some jeans
It's one more day that you don't find true love because you don't know what it means yeah.

Did you ever take the time to think about who I might be?
Where I've been what I'm thinking who I love what I've seen yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

One more car out on the road there you might pass on your way home
Someone's sister, someones wife or just some bitch who's probably got no life.

Yes I'm one more girl on the stage, just one more ass that got stuffed in some jeans.
And it's one more day that you don't find true love because you don't know what it means yeah.
