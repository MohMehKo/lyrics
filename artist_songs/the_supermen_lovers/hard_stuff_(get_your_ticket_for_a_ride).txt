Yeah baby, now you know
That it's hard stuff going down 
In a heavy way, each and every way 
Come on, come on. 

Hard stuff 
Working on hard stuff
Hey, you're losing heart dust 
Dancing around stuff 
Hey, you're making hard stuff
Working on hard stuff (Yeah, yeah) 
Hey, you're losing heart dust 
Dancing around stuff 
Hey, you're making - (Let me tell ya) 

When I began to go crazy 
The pace in my life start to rise 
People in town seem so lazy 
They all think I'm losing my mind (Good call) 

Ghosts and spirits at my window 
They all think I'm wasting my time 
Junkies and freaks out on the street
And the race just keeps going on 

Get your ticket for a ride 
Combination seems alright 
Put the levers in and on 
Destination's out of sight 

Stave off the world where I can fly 
Free in my mind, yet I die 
Even my dad don't see me fight 
I try to work hard to be right 

Neighbours and friends rest in my hallway 
Watching me losing my mind (Brothers and sisters) 
Brothers and sisters divert my road 
As the countdown's going on 

Get your ticket for a ride 
Combination seems alright 
Put the levers in and on 
Destination's out of sight 

Hard stuff 
Working on hard stuff
Hey, you're losing heart dust 
Dancing around stuff 
Hey, you're making hard stuff
Working on hard stuff
Hey, you're losing heart dust 
Dancing around stuff 
Hey, you're making-

Get your ticket for a ride 
Combination seems alright 
Put the levers in and on 
Destination's out of sight 
[x4]

Get your ticket for a ride 
Destination's out of sight.
