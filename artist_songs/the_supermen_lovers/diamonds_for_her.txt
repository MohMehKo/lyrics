How can I say my friend its hard for me to begin
How can I show my friend the joy that I feel for real
And my body and soul were the ticket for a good opportunity 
Other girls all around have been dancing on a rhythm of slavery 

How can I say my friend
How can I say my friend
How can I say my friend for real

And now that the nights become longer than everyday
And the pain becomes stronger than all my rage 
And the reasons I found to stay all around
I could give everything for diamonds for her

That the nights become longer than everyday
And the pain becomes stronger than all my rage 
And the reasons I found to stay all around
I could give everything for diamonds for her

How can I trust my friend the words that they used to say
How can I have the rules this game that they want to play
Me and her were just sitting in the back on the leather of my parent's car 
And the birds in the sky have been singing a rhythm of propriety 

How can I trust my friend
How can I trust my friend
How can I trust my friend for real

And now that the nights become longer than everyday
And the pain becomes stronger than all my rage 
And the reasons I found to stay all around
I could give everything for diamonds for her

That the nights become longer than everyday
And the pain becomes stronger than all my rage 
And the reasons I found to stay all around
I could give everything for diamonds for her
