Spend your whole life chasing dreams
Went from sidelines to major leagues
And now they say
"You finally made it you must be happy"
But on dark nights
When you're counting sheep
And the good times are fast asleep
You think "I'm ok, just maintain it I should be happy"

But when five years pass
The same things don't make you laugh
And now ten years go by alone

So maybe it's time to go home
Pack it up and leave ‘em a note
Saying "I don't wanna do this alone"
So go pack those yellow boxes
And make your way home
When everything is out of control
And you feel like you have traded your soul
For gold pack those yellow boxes
And make your way home

Pack ‘em up pack ‘em up
Yellow boxes
Pack ‘em up pack ‘em up
Yellow boxes
Pack ‘em up pack ‘em up
You can always
Pack those yellow boxes

So you can spend your whole life
How it's supposed to be
And love right unconditionally
And you can say
I found a way ‘cause I got my family

Don't let five years pass
Time you'll never get back
Don't let ten years go by alone

So maybe it's time to go home
Pack it up and leave ‘em a note
Saying "I don't wanna do this alone"
So go pack those yellow boxes
And make your way home
When everything is out of control
And you feel like you have traded your soul
For gold pack those yellow boxes
And make your way home
Ohh ahh
You can always
Pack ‘em up pack ‘em up
Yellow boxes
Pack ‘em up pack ‘em up
Pack ‘em up pack ‘em up
Yellow boxes
Pack those yellow boxes

Home, pack it up
And leave ‘em a note sayin'
"I don't wanna be here alone"
So can you pack those yellow boxes
And get yourself home
When everything is out of control
And you feel like you have traded your soul
For gold pack those yellow boxes
And make your way home

Pack ‘em up pack ‘em up
Pack ‘em up pack ‘em up
Make your way home
Pack ‘em up pack ‘em up
You can always
Pack those yellow boxes
Make your way home
