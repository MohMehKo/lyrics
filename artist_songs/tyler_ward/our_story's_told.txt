Say goodbye, one more time
Let me rise, back to life
I was wrong, you were right
Let me go, it's polite

Leave a light on for me
Just in case we meet in time
Leave a light on for me
But for now, close the blinds

[Chorus:]
Our story's told
It's time for goodbye
This room is cold
There's nowhere to hide

Take a bow and strike the stage
Shows are over today
Grab your jacket as you leave
Thanks for coming, you're free 

Say goodbye
To the dream
You untie
I'll rip a seam
You should go
And I believe
We both know
What you need
Leave a light on for me
Just in case we meet in time
Leave a light on for me
But for now, close the blinds

[Chorus]

Take a chance on the thought that you wouldn't stay
Haven't found a place where you feel ok
And you fear
You're missing out on priceless days

Can't get back to the start when you were brand new
Forgetting all the things that we used to do
Disappear
I think I'm gonna need a few, but I'm singin'

Leave a light on for me
Just in case we meet in time
Leave a light on for me
But for now, close the blinds

[Chorus]

You are free, now search for answers
You are free to fly

Leave a light on for me
Just in case we meet in time
