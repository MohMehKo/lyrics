Woah...
Its safe to say
That you and I should call it quits but we never did
Cause I keep running back to you
Don't leave me alone
I'm at my best when I'm with you
Raise up your glass for broken hearts
These shattered pieces form the scars
Tonight we fight, tonight we fall, tonight is when we love again
Raise up your glass for broken hearts
These shattered pieces form the scars
Beyond the past, we can make it last, tonight is when we love again
Were face to face but it still feels like I can't get to you
They said drop the chase
That's just something that I could never do
So come out of your daze you may not feel this like I do
But in the thunder, I'm gonna get to you
Raise up your glass for broken hearts
These shattered pieces form the scars
Tonight we fight, tonight we fall, tonight is when we love again
Raise up your glass for broken hearts
These shattered pieces form the scars
Beyond the past, we can make it last, tonight is when we love again
We were made as sons and daughters, by the sins of our fathers
They took fame, we take honor
We were made as sons and daughters, by the sins of our fathers
They took fame, we take honor
Hey...
We were made as sons and daughters, by the sins of our fathers
They took fame, we take honor
Woah...
Tonight we fight, tonight we fall, tonight is when we love
Raise up your glass for broken hearts
These shattered pieces form the scars
Beyond the past, we can make it last, tonight is when we love again
