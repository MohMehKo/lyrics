Out of the East never see the sunrise
Spoon fed peace, swallowing knives
We know that promise is sweet,
But it's laced with venom
And we're their living sacrifice

Oh
Now baby

One by one you line us up, two
By two, and three you'll send us home

Are you, are you
Coming to the tree
They strung up a man,
They say who murdered three

Strange things did happen here,
No stranger would it be
If we met at midnight in the hanging tree

Jack rabbit on the rooftop now
Your magic can be seen for miles
Stop sellin' all our dreams to the wild
Can you hear us

Jack rabbit on the rooftop now
Your magic can be seen for miles
Can you hear us
How-how-howl, yeah

How do you see while the black crow flies
Caught between who's wrong and right
It's cruel, your game to gain momentum
But go on and feast your eyes

Oh
Now baby

One by one you line us up, two
By two, and three you'll send us home

Are you, are you
Coming to the tree
Where I told you to run,
So we'd both be free

Strange things did happen here,
No stranger would it be
If we met at midnight in the hanging tree

Jack rabbit on the rooftop now
Your magic can be seen for miles
Stop sellin' all our dreams to the wild
Can you hear us

Jack rabbit on the rooftop now
Your magic can be seen for miles
Can you hear us
How-how-howl, yeah

Are you, are you
Coming to the tree
Wear the necklace of hope,
Side by side with me

Strange things did happen here,
No stranger would it be
If we met at midnight in the hanging tree
