I know you gotta leave, but I don't want you to go (yeah)
I'm kinda nervous, but I gotta let, let you know

That you were a red light, red light, red light
You came into my life at the wrong time
But now I can't imagine my life without you, so

Oooh oooh ooh ooh ooooh
(Stay)
Oooh oooh ooh ooh ooooh
(I just want, I just want you to)
Oooh oooh ooh ooh ooooh
Oooh oooh ooh ooh ooooh
(Stay)

I told you everything people wouldn't want to hear
(My regrets, my flaws, and my fears)
You know my past but you still wanna stay near
My dear

Yeah you were a red light, red light, red light
You came into my life at the wrong time
But now I can't imagine my life without you
(So I need you to)

Oooh oooh ooh ooh ooooh
(Stay)
Oooh oooh ooh ooh ooooh
(My regrets, my flaws, and my fears)
Oooh oooh ooh ooh ooooh
(Yeah, I need you to)
Oooh oooh ooh ooh ooooh
(Stay)

You know, this doesn't make much sense to me
(So I need you to)
I was fine with being so lonely
(Yeah, I need you to)
No, this doesn't make much sense to me
(So I need you to)
I was fine with being so lonely

Yeah, you were a red light, red light, red light
And at the right time it was possible to see
That you were always green, so

Oooh oooh ooh ooh ooooh
(Stay)
Oooh oooh ooh ooh ooooh
(You came at the wrong time)
(You came at the wrong time, but I need you to stay)
Oooh oooh ooh ooh ooooh
(Yeah, my regrets, my flaws, and my fears)
Oooh oooh ooh ooh ooooh
(Stay)
