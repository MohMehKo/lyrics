You say you love me
But what does that mean?
You say you need me
Is this only a dream?
Pull me in and push me back
Don’t know where I’m going
I never felt like this before

If I’m really the one
Then tell me what I can do
If I’m really the one
I wish I knew, yeah

Well, why are you
Pulling the strings
And telling you lies
Will I wait
Anticipate
Will I turn away?
Just look me in the eyes

And tell me what I can do
When you say
The others don’t matter
Just tell me what I can do, 

Because I can’t take this love you’re faking
Don’t pretend, do you know what you do to me?
And I can’t take this, hearts are breaking
Is it the end?
Are you blind to what I need?

Now where do we go from here?
And stop telling you lies
‘Cause our future seems so unclear
Will you please, oh please let me break these times

‘Cause if I’m not the one,
Then let me be

Because I can’t take this love you’re faking
Don’t pretend, do you know what you do to me?
And I can’t take this, hearts are breaking
Is it the end?
Are you blind to what I need?

Because I can’t take this love you’re faking
Don’t pretend, do you know what you do to me?
And I can’t take this, hearts are breaking
Is it the end?
Are you blind to what I need?
