Headed back home
Boarding the plane
Like an old ghost thought I heard your name
And my heart stopped, skipped a beat for one second
Turned around, but who was I kidding?
Just a sweet girl
Was she here to save me?
Will I finally get to move on, maybe?
Quick drinks, so that I can move closer
Ask her name, hoping for closure

So this is what it's like to be lonely?
Spending every minute thinking 'bout you
But looking for somebody else to hold me
Only hoping they will know me like you do
Get out of my mind for a moment
You took my heart and marked it like a tattoo
They say that time will heal like a potion
But time has only got me missing more of you, of you
(Lonely, lonely)
(Lonely, lonely)

It's been a few months
And not much has changed
Still check my phone to see if your name's on it
Drive past the places we used to go
Our song keeps spinning on the radio
And I know I sound a little clich√©, but I
I never thought the things could change
So please, don't forget me when the summer fades
All the while, I'll be trying to replace your face

So this is what it's like to be lonely?
Spending every minute thinking 'bout you
But looking for somebody else to hold me
Only hoping they will know me like you do
Get out of my mind for a moment
You took my heart and marked it like a tattoo
They say that time will heal like a potion
But time has only got me missing more of you, of you
(Lonely, lonely)
(This is what it's like to be, this is what it's like to be)
(Lonely, lonely)
(This is what it's like to be lonely)

All I want is for you to know
That I'm sorry for all the things I didn't didn't do
All I want is for you to know
That I'm sorry for all the things I didn't didn't do
If I call you up in the middle of the night
If I send you a text asking, "How is your life?"
It's just me checking in insecure
Wondering if I exist anymore
If I say something and I started a fight
Between you and yours, yeah I'll act so surprised
Surprised, surprised
I'll need a little time

So this is what it's like to be lonely?
Spending every minute thinking 'bout you
But looking for somebody else to hold me
Only hoping they will know me like you do
Get out of my mind for a moment
You took my heart and marked it like a tattoo
They say that time will heal like a potion
But time has only got me missing more of you, of you
(Lonely, lonely, lonely)
(Lonely, lonely, this is what it's like to be lonely)
(Lonely, this is what it's like to be lonely)
