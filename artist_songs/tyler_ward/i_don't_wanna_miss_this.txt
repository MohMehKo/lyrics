In the middle of the night she calls my name
I swear I hang on every word
Her voice like lighting and thunder
It's her spell I'm going under
In the middle of the night she calls my name

And it feels so good
When I'm in her arms
Like a child
Who's safe from harm

I don't wanna
Miss this
I don't wanna
Mess this up

I see the sun set down on your smile
This is where I lay my fears back down
You're the song that I'm singing
Your my end and beginning
I see the sun set down on your smile

And you save me now
Like you saved me then
And you showed me how
To feel again

I don't wanna
Miss this
I don't wanna
Mess this up
