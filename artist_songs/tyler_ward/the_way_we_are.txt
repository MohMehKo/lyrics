[Verse 1:]
I'm backseat to your freeway
This could never be safe
Cause, I might get lost in you
I'm just a little bit defeated
I've got my reasons
One being you're just passing through

You know I love you but I'm
Feeling afraid, you never say
One thing to keep me holding on
You push me away

[Chorus:]
Why do you lie beside me?
When you never have time
And you're fine without me?

And I, think it's pretty unlikely,
That the words on your mind
Could ever inspire me
To stay and love the way we are [x2]

[Verse 2:]
Every time you are lonely
Why am I the only one
You come running to
Got me saying that "I love you"
When I know that the truth is
You could trade me for something new

You keep me hanging like you're
So unaware, you're never there
You should know better but you don't
And it's never fair

[Chorus:]
Why, do you lie beside me,
When you never have time
And you're fine without me

And I, think it's pretty unlikely,
That the words on your mind
Could ever inspire me
To stay and love the way we are [x2]

[Bridge:]
Somebody wake
Somebody shake me from
The hold she has on me
I'm so afraid
I wanna be saved but what
If she let's go of me
If she let's go of me?
Yeah

[Chorus:]
Why, do you lie beside me,
When you never have time
And you're fine without me

And I, think it's pretty unlikely,
That the words on your mind
Could ever inspire me
To stay and love the way we are [x2]
