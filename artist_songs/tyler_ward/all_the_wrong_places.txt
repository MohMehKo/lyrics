Tell me why do you fall?
So far that you cant contain it?
Tell me why cant you see that your searching all the wrong places
Baby, you don't know
But I will try to explain it
Baby, why can't you see that your searching 
All the wrong places

I don't wanna play these games anymore
Tired of watching you walk out the door
Hiding here still, scared to reveal 
How we really feel
Baby this is so real
[x2]

[Justin Reid:]
Tell me have you ever noticed when we're all alone
How you get so nervous
Baby why cant you see that your searching
All the wrong places
You say you've been through it all
And you don't know how your gonna change it
Baby why can't you see that your searching 
All the wrong places

I don't wanna play these games anymore
Tired of watching you walk out the door
Hiding here still, scared to reveal
How we really feel
Baby this is so real
[x2]

Just looking right at the stars
Just look where we are
Just look where we are
[x2]

[Eppic:]
My wall covered by your picture
Even got your favorite lillys
And purchased two plane tickets
That woulda got us to Italy
Was attendin' the show
Your favorite artist the headliner
Got me searchin' the venue
With the incentive that I find her
On a date in the cafes of Venice
Was but a fantasy, dancing, fall in love with menace
But it felt pretty real to me
This was a song of a song
Unless the sun dissipates
So does the love

I don't wanna play these games anymore
Tired of watching you walk out the door
Hiding here still, scared to reveal
How we really feel
Baby this is so real
