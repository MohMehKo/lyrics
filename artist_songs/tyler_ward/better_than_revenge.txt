The story starts when it was hot and it was summer
And I had it all, I had her right there were I wanted her
He came along, got her alone, and let's hear the applause
He took her faster than you could saw sabotage

I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
He had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
He underestimated just who he was stealing from

He's not a saint, and he's not what you think
He's an actor, whoa-oh
He's better known for the game that he's [?]
He never loved her, whoa-oh

Soon he's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you any friends
He should keep in mind, he should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge

They look at life like its a party and they're on the list
They look at me like I'm a trend and they're so over it
I think their ever present frown is a little troubling
They think I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme they're name with things

Sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
Oh, they didn't teach you that in prep school, so it's up to me
But no amount of vintage suits give you dignity

He's not a saint, and he's not what you think
He's an actor, whoa-oh
He's better known for the game that he's [?]
He never loved her, whoa-oh

Soon he's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you any friends
He should keep in mind, he should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge

You! wouldn't gotten away with this
I would look at what most would get
A woman in a relationship expects an unfortunate turn of events
Would move your lips off my lady
I should give you no harm
[?] under my arms
But beneath this innocence that means [?]

Soon he's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you any friends
He should keep in mind, he should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge
