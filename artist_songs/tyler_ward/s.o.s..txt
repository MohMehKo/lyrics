SOS can someone help me
I need a miracle, I need a miracle
SOS can someone help me
I need a miracle, I need a miracle

This is more than a problem
I’ve got something to say
But my words never come out right
If I could pull it together and just gather a phrase
This is what I’d say tonight

[Pre-Chorus (x2):]
SOS can someone help me
I need a miracle, I need a miracle

[Chorus:]
Can you help me out
Trying to find my way
Been shattered into pieces
Tryin‘ to get `em back again
Can you help me out
Trying to find my way
Been shattered into pieces

[Pre-Chorus (x2):]
SOS can someone help me
I need a miracle, I need a miracle

Thought I was headed for greatness
Collecting red letter days
Watching all the stars align
But I traded in greatness
For all their beautiful ways
Now I’m screaming "Someone save my life"

[Pre-Chorus (x2):]
SOS can someone help me
I need a miracle, I need a miracle

Trying to get `em back again

[Chorus:]
Can you help me out
Trying to find my way
Been shattered into pieces
Tryin' to get `em back again
Can you help me out
Trying to find my way
Been shattered into pieces

[Pre-Chorus (x2):]
SOS can someone help me
I need a miracle, I need a miracle
