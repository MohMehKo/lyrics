"Experience. Incredible. New. Amazing. Music… Music."

[Chorus:]
Jump in my Hoopty-Hoop baby
Ain’t got a lot of money but I think we’re gonna make it
You know that when I count down from three
We can make believe that
We’ll be standing taller than the Hollywood trees
Singing oh, oh, oh, oh, oh we’ve got this love thing going on
Singing oh, oh, oh, oh, oh we’ve got this love thing going on

(Three – Two – One)
When I count down from three (know)
It’s just you and me (so)
See us on the beach or even flying over seas
No limit to where we can go
Hold tight like a rodeo
Round the world like a merry go
We won’t stop until you say so

[Pre-Chorus:]
If you can just dream it
Out love will bring it to life

[Chorus:]
Jump in my Hoopty-Hoop baby
Ain’t got a lot of money but I think we’re gonna make it
You know that when I count down from three
We can make believe that
We’ll be standing taller than the Hollywood trees
Singing oh, oh, oh, oh, oh we’ve got this love thing going on
Singing oh, oh, oh, oh, oh we’ve got this love thing going on

The Bay, New York, Berlin, the Philippines
Now baby when we’re dreaming we’ll be speaking Japanese
Hitching rides all the way to Mars
Making friends with the yellow stars
Driving candy coated color cars
When I’m with you baby nothings far

[Pre-Chorus:]
If you can just dream it
Out love will bring it to life

[Chorus:]
Jump in my Hoopty-Hoop baby
Ain’t got a lot of money but I think we’re gonna make it
You know that when I count down from three
We can make believe that
We’ll be standing taller than the Hollywood trees
Singing oh, oh, oh, oh, oh we’ve got this love thing going on

[x2]
If you’re down, don’t frown, I’m around, we can get out
Now we’re going up
Just wave to airplanes while we’re North oft he Milky Way

[Chorus:]
Jump in my Hoopty-Hoop baby
Ain’t got a lot of money but I think we’re gonna make it
You know that when I count down from three
We can make believe that
We’ll be standing taller than the Hollywood trees
Singing oh, oh, oh, oh, oh we’ve got this love thing going on
