Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my...

Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
I got my windows down, and the radio up, get your radio up

Yea when I first saw that bikini top on her
She’s poppin’ right out of the South Georgia water
Thought ol’ good Lord, she had them long tanned legs
Couldn’t help myself so I walked up and said

Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin’ stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
And this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Looks so much better with you up in it
So baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
I got my windows down, and the radio up, get your radio up

She was sippin’ on Southern and singin’ Marshall Tucker
We were falling in love in the sweet heart of summer
She hopped right up into the cab of my truck
And said, “Fire it up! Let’s go get this thing stuck!”

Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin’ stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
And this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Looks so much better with you up in it
So baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

[Eppic:]
My windows down, my seats back
My music up and we ride
Her legs up on my dashboard
And it’s just the way I like

[Black Prez:]
Hey country girl, this country boy
Like everything about you
Don’t change a thing, no way
You stay the same and I got you

[Eppic:]
I like saw that, all that
Head to toe you all that

[Black Prez:]
Tell ol’ boy he can call back
Send her a text say, “fall back” cause

[Eppic:]
I can see you got a thing for the fast life

[Black Prez:]
So come on, shawty, let me show you what the fast like
Whipping ‘cross the border, Colorado, California

[Tyler Ward:]
Cause baby you a song
And you make me wanna roll my, roll my...

Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin’ stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
And this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Looks so much better with you up in it

Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
I got my windows down, and the radio up, get your radio up

(1,2,1,2,3,4)
I got my windows down, and the radio up, get your radio up
I got my windows down, and the radio up, get your radio up
I got my windows down, and the radio up, get your radio up
I got my windows down, and the radio up, get your radio up
