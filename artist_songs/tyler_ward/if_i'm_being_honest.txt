I remember the first day
You and I were perfect
Parked out in the driveway
With our favorite song
We were so invincible
The two of us together
But now it seems so far away
Where did we go wrong?

[Pre-Chorus:]
Did I let you down
Did I let you down
Are you listening now
Are you listening now
(Are you listening now)

[Chorus:]
Cause if I'm being honest
Honestly I never wanna give up but it's hard sometimes
There's gotta be a reason
Even if we're too messed up yeah we've gotta try
You're the fireworks at night
That color in my black and white
And if I'm being honest
Honestly I'm never gonna give up,
I ain't leaving without you

I remember summer stars
Can't forget the feeling
Laying out in the backyard
with you in my arms
We could talk for hours then
The time it never mattered
But now it feels so far away
Is yesterday gone

[Pre-Chorus:]
Did I let you down
Did I let you down
Are you listening now
Are you listening now
(Are you listening now)

[Chorus:]
Cause if I'm being honest
Honestly I never wanna give up but it's hard sometimes
There's gotta be a reason
Even if we're too messed up yeah we've gotta try
You're the fireworks at night
That color in my black and white
And if I'm being honest
Honestly I'm never gonna give up,
I ain't leaving without you

Those nights when we came home wasted
No one says my name like the way you say it
Those nights in the pouring rain
When you didn't need to say, „No need to explain, no“
Thoses days with the, „Where have you been“
When you try to put a smile and you try to pretend
Sometimes it's just the way that it is
But I'm not getting go, no I'm not giving in

[Chorus:]
Cause if I'm being honest
Honestly I never wanna give up but it's hard sometimes
There's gotta be a reason
Even if we're too messed up yeah we've gotta try
You're the fireworks at night
That color in my black and white
And if I'm being honest
Honestly I'm never gonna give up,
I ain't leaving without you
