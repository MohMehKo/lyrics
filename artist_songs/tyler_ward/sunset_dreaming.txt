She said I'm tired
Of all the smiles
And explanations
For all the dreams you never let me see

I'm tired of the trials
And implications of all the words you never said to me
And you (will forever be a part of...)
Of who (I am)

She hides her screaming, 
In sunset dreaming
That's where she goes to cry
And crashes down on her knees
Searching for Reasons why.

She said I'm tired
Of all the lying, 
I'm through with trying
There's nothing left but scattered memories

Of you (and a love you never gave me...)
And who (I am)

He's lying, She's crying
Where did this go wrong?
He's lying, She's crying
But not for long...
