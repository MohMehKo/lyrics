[Verse 1]
I'm running backwards in the rain
Got my hand up for a taxi
I finally got her name
Then we slipped into the backseat

I whisper, "are you okay?"
She nods her head with feeling
I could see the pain
And I can not explain how

[Chorus]
I am captivated by
The way you look tonight
And I've seen what you've been into

So I will never cross the line
I won't tell you any lies
I was sent here for the rescue

[Verse 2]
She couldn't see past his stare, when desire took them over
With a quick and simple prayer she cried, "God bring this to closure"
"I can not take this anymore and I know that what I'm waiting for

Is so much bigger, so much better, get me out, please deliver"

So I'm here breaking down your door
Calling out your name
I want to take away the pain
You know I'm here like I was before
Screaming out your name
Waiting for the change

[Chorus]
I am captivated by
The way you look tonight
And I've seen what you've been into

So I will never cross the line
I won't tell you any lies
I was sent here for the rescue

[Choir]
Leave your burden, weak and weary, I will lead you home
Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound
