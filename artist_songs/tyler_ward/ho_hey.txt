I've been trying to do it right
I've been livin' a lonely life
I've been sleepin' here instead
I've been sleeping in my bed
Sleeping in my bed

So show me family
All the blood that I would bleed
I don't know where I belong
I don't know where I went wrong
But I can write a song

I belong with you
You belong with me, 
you're my sweetheart
I belong with you
You belong with me, 
you're my sweetheart 

I don't think you're right with him
Look at what it might have been
If you took a bus to China town
I'd be standing on canal and Bowery
And she'd be standing next to me

I belong with you
You belong with me, 
you're my sweetheart
I belong with you
You belong with me, 
you're my sweetheart

And love we need it now
Lets hope for some
Cause oh... we're bleeding out

I belong with you
You belong with me, 
you're my sweetheart
I belong with you
You belong with me, 
you're my sweetheart

I belong with you
You belong with me, 
you're my sweetheart
