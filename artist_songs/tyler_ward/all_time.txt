They can have their bright lights, fast cars
Burning down Hollywood Boulevard
Their nice suits, 'round their heart
Hope they keep a piece of who they are

'Cause planet Earth is spinning fast
And L.A. lights keep flying past
But I think I've found something to last
With you

Cause, it's you and me for all time
And nothing's gonna break us
A hundred years could go by 
But baby they can't shake us

Well, nothing seems to stay together
But I know that we'll forever
It's you and me for all time
And nothing's gonna break us

I don't need a big yard, big home
And I just can't not know to what, oh
I don't need my song playin' on the radio
I got all I want calling you my own

'Cause planet Earth is spinning fast
And L.A. lights keep flying past
But I think I've found something to last
With you

Cause, it's you and me for all time
And nothing's gonna break us
A hundred years could go by 
But baby they can't shake us

Well, nothing seems to stay together
But I know that we'll forever
It's you and me for all time
And nothing's gonna break us

The city could crumble and fall
We'll still be here through it all
And even when the stars all go dark
I'll still have you in my arms

The city could crumble and fall
We'll still be here standing strong
And even when the stars all go dark
I'll still have you

It's you and me for all time
And nothing's gonna break us
A hundred years could go by 

Cause, it's you and me for all time
And nothing's gonna break us
A hundred years could go by 
But baby they can't shake us

Well, nothing seems to stay together
But I know that we'll forever
It's you and me for all time
And nothing's gonna break us
