You unexpected us, and he couldn't get me to fall
Is this your plan now all along because
If I don’t make up its finally shut down
Now you’re a memory that I can not put down

And all the words I left unsaid (I think I miss you now)
A love like valentine with roses in your bed
God I hope you come back soon (I keep for the turn around)
Cause everything you were just shot me to the moon

Maybe I was wrong, maybe this time you were right
I should of held on, I should of put up a fight
Cause you were leaving me intoxicated by
The way you held me, the way you turned off the lights

And all the words I left unsaid (I think I miss you now)
A love like valentine with roses in your bed
God I hope you come back soon (I keep for the turn around)
Cause everything you were just shot me to the moon

Cause you’re the only one that ever understood
And you’re the fire that blazed across the sky
I say I'm sorry with the hope this isn't over

Yeah, I wasn’t sick of this dance for anyone in particular
Uneducated to the ways of lust, took it like it was part of my curricular
Didn’t love you anymore, didn’t have already, didn’t really have to
Command to takes  to see the relation of this ship was getting unsteady
Now that I got my tux fitted for the task, I’m suited 
For the petals of roses not covering the shored of Cali
Leaving the meaning of love translucent

These are the words I left unsaid (cause you're the only one that ever understood)
I love you more then you could ever understand
A love like valentine won’t do (I say I'm sorry with the hope this isn't over)
Cause ill move the earth the sun the moon
Till you realize I'm waiting here for you
