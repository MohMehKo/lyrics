And the conversation was right
Underneath the shade of moonlight
You were standing there
With sun-touched hair
And your dress the color white

Like an aeroplane
I took flight
Fell in love with you that first night
Cause you danced with me
And I could see that there was more to life
I'm falling
I'm falling
In love with you
I'm falling
I'm falling
In love with you-ooh

Just before the strike of midnight
You said "This could be the good life"
And you say "Goodbye, hope that I get to see you soon"
Then I walked for several miles
Couldn't rid me of my smile
Cause you found me and I found you
In this lovely month of June

I'm falling
I'm falling
In love with you
I'm falling
I'm falling
In love with you
