If time was still the sun would never, never find us
We could light up the sky tonight
And I would see the world through your eyes
Leave it all behind

If it's you and me for forever
If it's you and me right now
That'd be alright, be alright

We're chasing stars to lose our shadows
Peter Pan and Wendy turned out fine
So won't you fly with me?

So now the past is come alive
And given meaning and a reason
To give all I can
To believe once again

Cause it's you and me for forever
If it's you and me right now
That'd be alright, be alright

Cause we're chasing stars to lose our shadow
Peter Pan and Wendy turned out fine
So won't you fly with me?

Maybe you were just afraid
Knowing you were miles away
From the place where you needed to be
And that's right here with me

It's you and me forever
You and me right now
That'd be alright

We're chasing stars to lose our shadow
Peter Pan and Wendy turned out fine
So won't you fly with me?

If it's you for me forever
If it's you and me right now
I'd be alright, be alright

We're chasing stars to lose our shadow
Peter Pan and Wendy turned out fine
So won't you fly, fly, fly with me?
