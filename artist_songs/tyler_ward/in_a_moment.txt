People talk about bad days
Obsessing over what they can't change
And I used to be them too
But then you walked into my life
And I let go my vices
Yes it's true

In a moment, look what you've done
I can't help myself
There's nowhere else to run
No more questions just confession of love

My mama always said "son better hold out for a good one"
So now I'm clinging to you
And if you leave it up to me
You're stronger than this whiskey
So I'm gonna fill up on you

In a moment look what you've done
I can't help myself
There's nowhere else to run
No more questions just confession of love

You take the pain away
Only sun, no more rain
All the tears washed away
No more fears, better days

In a moment look what you've done
I can't help myself
There's nowhere else to run
No more questions just confession of love
