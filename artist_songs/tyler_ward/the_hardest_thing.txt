[Verse 1:]
A still framed photograph
Of you and me together
Is all I have of me and you
Anymore
We were so in love and
We thought it'd last forever
But in the storm
We were torn

[Chorus:]
And I won't forget you
Don't regret you
The hardest thing I've had to do
Is live without you
And I wonder why
We both walked away
I'm lost without you
Still crazy for you
Just turn around come back
Because your smile is overdue
And I miss you

[Verse 2:]
If I only knew the words to say
That would make you turn around (turn around)
I would say those words to you
More than a million times
It's been forever but that hasn't changed
What you mean to me
And darling can't you see?

[Chorus:]
That I won't forget you
Don't regret you
And the hardest thing I've had to do is
Live without you
And I wonder why we both walked away (we walked away...)
I'm lost without you
Still crazy for you
Just turn around come back
Because your smile is overdue
And I miss...
I miss you

[Bridge:]
I'm sorry for all I did
What I said
And
The things I hid
I'm finally over me
Is that too late for you?
I can't imagine where I'd be
If you had never rescued me
You gave me hope to live
Now I need you
Yes, I need you

[Chorus:]
And I won't forget you
Don't regret you
And the hardest thing I've had to do
Was live without you
And I wonder why
We both walked away (we walked away...)
I'm lost without you
Still crazy for you
Just turn around come back
Because your smile is overdue
And I miss you
