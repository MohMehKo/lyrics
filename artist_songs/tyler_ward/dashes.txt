Maybe one day I'll come back here
Maybe one day I'll be able to love you like I should
I know it looks like I'm running
I never said that what we had here wasn't good

If I don't try now I'll go crazy
I don't want to wish that I had when I look back on my life
There’s a feeling I'm chasing
Feels like what I want's on the other side

So let me go
Give me dashes on the road
Maybe I'm walking to a place I don't know
I gotta see how things, they turn out
'Cause dreams in this town get cold
You'll miss your chances if you're marching in time
Even if I go alone
The least you can give me are dashes on the road

There's a city I never laid eyes on
And I can swear there's an answer waiting there for me
Driving to my horizon that's always been just out of reach
It's just what I need
If you love me, then let me just go

Oh, give me dashes on the road
Maybe I'm walking to a place I don't know
I gotta see how things, they turn out
'Cause dreams in this town get cold
You'll miss your chances if you're marching in time
Even if I go alone
The least you can give me are dashes on the road

Yeah, I'm a little scared to leave home
But every time that I close my eyes
I know that I must go

So, let me go
Give me dashes on the road
Maybe I'm walking to a place I don't know
Maybe everything turns out
And I'll finally find my soul
You’ll miss your chances if you're marching in time
Even if I go alone
The least you can give me are dashes on the road
Even if I go alone
The least you can give me are dashes on the road
