I think your pretty, 
Without any make-up on
I think your funny, 
When you tell the punch-line wrong
I know you get me, 
So I let my walls come down, down

Before you met me
I was all right, 
But things were kinda heavy
You brought me to life,
Now every February 
You'll be my valentine, valentine

Lets just fall into the night
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I
Will be young forever.

You make me feel like I’m living a teenage dream
The way you turn me on
I can’t sleep, 
Lets runaway and don’t ever look back
Don’t ever look back

My heart stops,
When you look at me
Just one touch,
Now baby I believe
This is real,
So take a chance and don’t never look back
Don’t ever look back

You drove to cali,
You held me along the beach
No room for tell’n,
Your taste is like candy sweet
I finally found you,
My missing puzzle piece
I’m Complete

Lets just fall into the night
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I
Will be young forever.

You make me feel like I’m living a teenage dream
The way you turn me on
I can’t sleep, 
Lets runaway and don’t ever look back
Don’t ever look back

My heart stops,
When you look at me
Just one touch,
Now baby I believe
This is real,
So take a chance and don’t never look back
Don’t ever look back
Got my heart racing 
In those skin-tight jeans
 Be my teenage dream tonight
I love the way you look at me
In those skin-tight jeans
Be my teenage dream tonight

Tonight
