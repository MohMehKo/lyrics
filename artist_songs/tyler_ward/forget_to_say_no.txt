Ah...
It can happen any day or night
In the middle of a crowded street or underneath the summer moonlight
You might hear music playing
Fireworks will fly
Heart skips can get you dizzy
Move so fast and just like that
Oh...
You forget to say no
Oh...
You forget to say no...
Ever seen an angel lookin' back into your eyes
Ever get that crazy feelin'
Burnin' like a fast car spinnin' on a dime
There's no holdin' back, and no reason to
You lose your mind, the stars align
Before you even know, it happens in a moment
Oh...
You forget to say no
Oh...
You forget to say no...
What's your name?
Where you from?
Would you like to dance?
Do you wanna fall in love?
Do you wanna fall in love?
Yeah...
Oh...
You forget to say no (do you wanna fall in love with me, tonight?)
Oh...(do you wanna fall in love with me, tonight?)
You forget to say no (do you wanna fall in love with me, tonight?)
You forget to say no (do you wanna fall in love with me, tonight?)
You forget to say no
