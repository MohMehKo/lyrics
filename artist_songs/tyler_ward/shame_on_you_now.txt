[Chorus:]
If you didn’t know the words when you walked in 
Shame on you now. 
If you didn’t know the words when you walked in 
Shame on you now.

[Verse 1:]
(Alright, Youtube) 
She goes Tyler, I just banged my head on the bathroom door by complete accident, it hurt. 
I wanna see your closet, is it full of black T-shirts? 
I just can’t believe, the love love love is taking over me hehe 
It’s very interesting to see your neighbors attack you 
I thought that Brent looked familiar then I was like “Wait, I bought a sweatshirt from him” 
Rotate! 
Insanity work outs, dentist and some reruns of House 
Oh yeah that sounds pretty dope, Mrs. future Tyler Ward 
There’s a monkey on the couch 
Morning voice I like that 
Your morning voice UGH 
Morning voice I like that 
Your morning voice UGH

[Chorus:]
If you didn’t know the words when you walked in 
Shame on you now. 
If you didn’t know the words when you walked in 
Shame on you now.

[Verse 2:]
(Ok, Facebook) 
Roses are red 
my name is Dave 
This poem makes no sense 
Microwave 
I close my eyes, take a deep breath and I fly away to Neptune 
When life gives you lemons, make apple juice 
From coast to coast 
Bazinga baby. Gotta say I love you, I love you 
Hi mom. 
They say that purple has no rhyming word but the first thing I thought was dimple 
And life is beautiful 
It’s gonna be a brother vs brother Super Bowl 
I wish that everybody was blind so everyone could stop judging me by the sight 
And have a deep look inside let your heart be your eyes 
And do what’s right, do what’s right.

[Chorus:]
If you didn’t know the words when you walked in 
Shame on you now. 
If you didn’t know the words when you walked in 
Shame on you now.
