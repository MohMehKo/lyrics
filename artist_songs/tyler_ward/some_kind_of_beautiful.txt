Gotta take a chance running after somebody [x4]

Driving home in the rain
Seven miles from lover’s lane
Got her taste on my lips
Still feel her on my fingertips
And now she makes me feel
Like I’ll never be alone again
Cause I’ve never had love like this

Her eyes, that smile
Can make the young boys stay awhile
I took a picture with my memory
So I can fall asleep
With you next to me all the time
She makes me feel like I’ll never be alone again
Cause I’ve never known love like this

[Chorus:]
And you are some kind of beautiful
(Gotta take a chance running after somebody) [x2]
And you are some kind of beautiful

We’re alone
I am safe
All my fears fades away
I am home in your gaze
Will you stay
Will you stay
And now she makes me feel like I’ll never be alone again
Cause I’ve never known love like this

[Chorus:]
And you are some kind of beautiful
(Gotta take a chance running after somebody) [x2]
And you are some kind of beautiful

I fall asleep with you next to me
Memorize the sound of your heartbeat
It’s beating loud from this point of view
I can’t believe that you’re near me
You took all that I’m fearing
And turned all my skies to blue

[Chorus:]
And you are some kind of beautiful
(Gotta take a chance running after somebody) [x2]
And you are some kind of beautiful

Gotta take a chance running after somebody [x4]
