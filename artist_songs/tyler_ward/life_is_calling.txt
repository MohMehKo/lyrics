Rain is falling, falling from a pie 
and people outside look for cover.
But I'll just stand here and look towards the sky.
My smile you grows with the sound of the thunder.
Even tho it's raining, it's a beautiful day.

'Cause I can see the sunshine 
through the clouds starring back at me
and it seem to say,
your life is calling come this way.
Come on.
And the cold wind's been pushing me around too long 
it starts today
My life is calling I'm on my way (uh ah)

All the sinners overtaste my mind
It's got me thinking of better days
So I lay my head down
and I can't help but smile
'cause I know there is purpose in the pain
Even tho it's raining, it's a beautiful day

'Cause I can see the sunshine 
through the clouds staring back at me
and it seem to say
Your life is calling come this way
And the cold wind's been pushing me around too long
it starts today
My life is calling, I'm on my way

Come on, don't stay
Drop everything you don't have to wait til friday
Come on, come my way
Come on, don't stay
Drop everything you don't have to wait til friday
Come on, come my way

'Cause I see the sunshine 
trough the clouds staring back at me
and it seems to say
Your life is calling, come this way
And the cold wind's been pushing me around too long
it starts today.

My life is calling, I'm on my way
My life is calling, I'm on my way.
My life is calling, I'm on my way.
