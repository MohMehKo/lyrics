You watching me, 
In secrecy
From the corner of my eye, 
I catch you walking by.

Can you agree, 
That we could be, 
More than just a quick hello, 
If we don't jump, we'll never know

That kind of love's easy, 
The kind you never knew
That kind of love's easy
The kind that you never get used to.

I know your sacred
They never cared, 
And your past was push and shove, 
It's time to find real love.

So don't be shy, 
Your like paradise
And it's my highest guarantee
That you finally get to see
Sing it again say, 
That kind of love's easy
The kind that you never knew
That kind of love's easy
The kind you never get used to... 

That kind of love's easy
That kind of love's easy
That kind of love's easy
That kind of love's easy

Yeah, Yeah C'mon

That kind of love's easy
The kind that you never knew (That we never knew, yeah)
The kind of love's easy
That kind you never get used to

Yeah (that kind of love's easy)
Yeah (that kind of love's easy)
Yeah (that kind of love's easy)
Yeah (that kind of love's easy)
