I send a simple I miss you yesterday
Wasn't surprised you didn't answer right away
Probably the lights flight heared you on the radio
So when you called back I just smiled

Small talk no details of your life
Then you cut to the point of what wasn't right
We haven't talked for a while
Now you finally have some time to explain your side

She said
You used me
You won't use me anymore
No not anymore
No
And you used to be
You used to be what I was looking for
No not anymore

Give me a minute so I understand your side
You're telling me you thought our love was just a lie
If all the secrets that I shared were a disguise
Then explain the tears I cried
I always listened when you shared your fears and doubts
What about the nights lying there on my couch
The stage was set for a fairytale
And I wasn't acting out
So what's with the fall out

She said
You used me
You won't use me anymore
No not anymore
No
And you used to be
You used to be what I was looking for
But not anymore

I guess the point of this song
Is to tell you I think of you
A little to often and
If my name comes up ever round in your world, yeah
I hope you know I was doing my best
The best that I knew how
And you were too
So can we move on now
