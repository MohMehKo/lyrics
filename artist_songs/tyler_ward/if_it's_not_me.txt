If we only have tonight
There's something you should know
I've been trying to get this right
But still learning to let go

So I'll put away the alcohol
That always covered up
Everything I'm feeling
That was never good enough

If it's not me, let it be someone
Someone you need, that you can rely on
I hope they can see, exactly what I see
So innocent and sweet, the best of everything
If it's not me

And if I'm being real
All my insecurities
Are finally catching up with me
Yeah

And if I'm really being honest
I just did what I wanted all the time
I was looking for a heart that was pure enough
To give me the real stuff

If it's not me, let it be someone
Someone you need, that you can rely on
I hope they can see, exactly what I see
So innocent and sweet, the best of everything
If it's not me

So lean in closer
Let me whisper once again

If it's not me, let it be someone
Someone you need, that you can rely on
I hope they can see, exactly what I see
So innocent and sweet, the best of everything
If it's not me

If it's not me
