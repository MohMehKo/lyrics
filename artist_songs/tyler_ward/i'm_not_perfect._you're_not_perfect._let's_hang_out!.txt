One, two, three
I learned a lot of things since I've grown up owned up
I hope your listening
'Cause you've been talking by me with you nose up hold up 
As if you haven't sinned

See I was just doing my best for you
But my best never got me from A to B
So now I'm finally fighting a real truth
It's simple and easy

You see I 'm not perfect
You're not perfect too
But we are worth it
So can I come out sit down hang out with you
(hey, hey) (uuuuuh) (hey, hey) (uuuuuh)

I was only showing off my text book best looks
I needed growing up
'Cause really what you wanted was some real love feel us
Kinda doesn't cover up

See I was just doing my best for you
But my best never got me from A to B
So now I'm finally fighting a real truth
And it's simple and easy

You see I 'm not perfect
You're not perfect too
But we are worth it
So can I come out sit down hang out with you
I'm not perfect
You're not perfect too
But we are worth it
So can I come out sit down hang out with you

Maybe you think I'm still a bad man noo
So I'll just be me and tell the truth it's home
Even when you diss me (I'm gonna ask you to come over anyway)
And never say you miss me (I'm gonna tell you I miss you anyway)
We're both doing our best round here
And if I know one thing

I'm not perfect
You're not perfect too
But we are worth it
So can I come out sit down hang out with you
