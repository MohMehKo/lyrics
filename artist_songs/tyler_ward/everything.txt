I whisper softly in the air
I'm alone when you're not here
And no one can take your place

Can be what you need me to be?
will that be enough for you?
Cause the past I can't erase

I could never get this right
These tears keep falling from my eyes
I just need you by my side.

And all I believe
Is that you're my everything
Please don't walk away

All I can breathe
Is the air of you and me,
Please don't turn away

Hold me close for one more night
lie to me say we're fine
Even though we're not okay

It was me that needed to breathe
and time has let me see
That you color all my grays.

And, I could never get this right
and these tears keep falling from my eyes
can I change your mind?

Because all I believe
Is that you're my everything
Please don't walk away

All I can breath
Is the air of you and me
Just hold me in this pain
