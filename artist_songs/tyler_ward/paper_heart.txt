In the parking lot of a 7-11
With a picture of you like a picture of heaven
But my tears fall down upon the wheel
Breaking apart is how I feel
Just how I feel

Cuz I've been shot down
Everybody turn around
To the sound of my breaking heart
Just burn, everybody take a turn
Light a match under my paper heart

Yeah, oh c'mon

A lonely song plays through the radio
I'm lost with no place to go
And as the moon shines down
Through my windshield
I look for something green

Cuz I've been shot down
Everybody turn around
To the sound of my breaking heart
Just burn, everybody take a turn
Light a match under my paper heart
Shot down
Everybody turn around
To the sound of my breaking heart
Just burn, everybody take a turn
Light a match under my paper heart

Yeah

Why did you go
So far away (so far away)
Far away (far away)
I have to know
If there's a way
This might change
Until then I'll just say

That I've been 
Shot down
Everybody turn around
To the sound of my breaking heart
Just burn, everybody take a turn
Light a match under my paper heart
Shot down
Everybody turn around
To the sound of my breaking heart
Just burn, everybody take a turn
Light a match under my paper heart

Yeah,
My paper heart
Yeah, c'mon
