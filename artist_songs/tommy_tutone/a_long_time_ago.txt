I used to jump over the moon to get to the other side
I wish I had a dime for all the times I tried
I used to be a one horse show
But that was A LONG TIME AGO

Somebody'd say something wrong; I'd want to take him outside
Some girl'd look at me twice; I'd want to make her my bride
I used to be a pistol, you know
But that was A LONG TIME AGO

I'd be settin' on ready at the starting line
Jumping that gun - trying to beat my own time
Back when I knew everything that there was to know
That was A LONG TIME AGO

I used to drive throught the walls; I never drove around
You set 'em up, and I'd knock 'em right down
But I was riding in a rubber rodeo
That was A LONG TIME AGO

We use to ride all night, and I'd let you off at dawn
Then I'd keep on rockin' until the nest one
I never shifted down into low
But that was A LONG TIME AGO

Always setting on ready at the starting line
Jumping that gun: trying to beat my own time
Back when I knew everything that there was to know
That was A LONG TIME AGO
That was A LONG TIME AGO
That was A LONG TIME AGO
Long, long long time ago

[SOLO]

Always settin' on ready at the starting line
Jumping that gun; trying to beat my own time
Back when I knew everything that there was to know

[breakdown]
I never told the truth when a lie would do
I think I was waiting for someone just like you
I'm getting tired of howling at the moon, you know
We used to do that stuff:

Way back A LONG TIME AGO
A LONG TIME AGO
That was A LONG TIME AGO
That was A LONG TIME AGO
