Angel I love you, you know I love you, but what can I say 
You're not really here anymore and I know it
It's getting late they're waiting outside you're gonna run away
One more time, it might be-e too la-a-ate

Angel say no
You're better on your own
Angel say no no no
Baby don't you know-ow

Don't try to tell me, baby don't tell me, I already know
You got that look in your eyes that shows me (hey)
I can't take it, I just can't take it, when you start to go-o
Well any American boy would fe-el the same way-ay
