I can't stand this another day, yeah
Since we met I've been so desperate, yeah
Memories with a lasting bite
You and me and the other night
Baby, all the things you do

You set my heart on fire
(I'll be your only one)
You are my heart's desire
(I'll be your only one)
Just give me the sign
I'll put my love on the line
You set my heart on fire
(I'll be your only one)
Be your only one

I have got a pocket full of change, yeah
You have got my mind rearranged, yeah
I will take you out to Palisades
We won't leave 'til we've seen the whole parade
Then I'm gonna take you home

You set my heart on fire
(I'll be your only one)
You are my heart's desire
(I'll be your only one)
I'll put my love on the line
Just give me the sign
You set my heart on fire
(I'll be your only one)
Be your only one

I'll be your only one
I'll be your only one
I'll be your only one
I'll be your, oh
Be your only one
