Why, baby, why?
Why can't I leave you alone?
I just turn my back and you're gone
Running around all over town
Why make me cry?
Why, baby, why?

Why, baby, why?
Why can't I learn to say no?
You take so much love when you go
And when you're gone, I'm so alone
Why, why, baby, why?

I can't take another day
Wondering what the matter can be
'Cause I'll tell you straight
I can't dig this wait
You make me play hide-and-go-seek

Cry, baby, cry
I know I should leave you alone
You just steal my heart then you're gone
Guess you're above
True, true, true love
Why, why, baby, why?

I can't take another day
Wondering what the matter can be
'Cause I'll tell you straight
I don't dig this wait
You make me play hide-and-go-seek

Why, baby, why?
Why can't I leave you alone?
I just turn my back and you're gone
Guess I misjudged
Bye, bye, bye love
You make me cry
Why, baby, why?
Why, baby, why?
Why, baby, why?
Why, baby, why?
