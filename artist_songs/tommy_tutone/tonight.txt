Do you wanna dance or fight?
Do you wanna kiss or bite?
Well, I don't take no lip
I don't want no scene tonight
Baby, this is it
Hey, tonight
Tonight

I, I don't wanna hurt your face
Baby, you don't know your place
Do you know what I mean?
Just don't remember what you saw tonight
You'll come out real clean
Hey, tonight
Tonight

Tonight you're here for glamour
Tonight you're here for show
Tonight there's things a-goin' down
You don't need to know

Yeah, tonight's not just another night
You can tell the stakes are high tonight
And when they look at me
They're gonna see that things are well in hand
'Cause that's how things will be

Tonight, the slightest nod
Could mean your life or just hello
There's decisions bein' made tonight
That I don't even know
Our future comes and goes tonight
On what I say and do
I got here on my charm, baby
And there's not enough, not enough for two

So do you wanna dance or fight?
Do you wanna kiss or bite?
I don't take no lip
And I don't want no scene tonight
Baby, this is it
Hey, tonight
Tonight
Tonight
Tonight
Hey, tonight
Tonight
Hey, tonight
Hey, tonight
