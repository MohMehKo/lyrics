Don't want to be wrong again
Don't want to see you with him
See you running all over town
It's you and Joey now
You sure do get around
Don't want to be right again
I think I'd much really rather pretend
That's not easy 'cause you're on parade
I liked it better when you pulled down the shade

Go on and do what you're gonna do
Girl, I guess I got no hold on you
He's with you now; I'll bet he's touching lace
Just don't take him to OUR SPECIAL PLACE

Don't want to be right again
Like I was about you and him
All these rumors going around
Don't you know this is a one purse town
Took a walk just to be alone
Down by the river where we used to go
He's got you now, but what do I care
Just as long as you don't bring him here

I played with fire; I got burned
I fought and fought it, but I finally learned
Bet I know what you're gonna do

Go on and do what you're gonna do
Girl, I guess I got no hold on you
He's with you now; I'll bet he's touching lace
Just don't take him to OUR SPECIAL PLACE
Go on and do what you're gonna do
There's not much left to hold on to
He's with you now; I'll bet he's touching lace
Just don't take him to OUR SPECIAL PLACE
Just don't take him to OUR SPECIAL PLACE [repeat]
