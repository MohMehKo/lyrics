That's no way to love
Waving bye-bye
That's no way to live
Hiding and crying
Tell the whole town, darlin'
That he's gone away

Left you late last night
But you'll be alright
Hey girl, you just want to be loved, now
Time to go, baby
Just walk on by

That's no way to cry
That's no way to cry

See him on the street
There he goes, now
Yeah, you're watching him
You know he knows now
Just let him cruise on by
It's a bye, bye, bye

See them on the town
She looks so pretty
Watch them run around
Wave as they go by
He's got everything
Bet you're wonderin' why

That's no way to cry
That's no way to cry

So long, Cheryl
You're out on your own
He's gone without a doubt
Don't hang around
It's all over town
You know what you got
You got one thing
You always got yourself

Just don't let your love tear up your mind, now
Don't you worry, there'll be other guys, now
Time to go, baby
Just walk on by

That's no way to cry
That's no way to cry
That's no way to cry
That's no way to cry

That's no way to cry
That's no way to cry
That's no way to cry
That's no way to cry

That's no way to cry
