Find yourself sleeping late
Throwing plates and breaking dates
Seeing red and feeling blue
Everybody thought that you were such a little angel
I guess you're human too

Steal your daddy's credit card
Drive right through the neighbor's yard
Generally acting quite rude
Everybody's talking about the new Jenny, Jenny.
She's got an attitude.

ATTITUDE! Blowin' off your homework 'cause
You're just not in the mood
ATTITUDE! Look out world, 'cause

Jenny's got the blues. (Jenny's calling)
She's busting loose. (Jenny's calling)
She's trying to reach out one last time
Jenny's got the blues (Jenny's calling)

In and out of trouble, in and out of love
I sent you to the Prom in your pretty white gloves
All your little problems got disposed of
But that's not enough for you

ATTITUDE It's hard to be straight up
When everybody's down on you.
ATTITUDE! Look out world, 'cause:

Jenny's got the blues. (Jenny's calling)
She's busting loose. (Jenny's calling)
She's trying to reach out one last time
Jenny's got the blues (Jenny's calling)

Pretty little ribbons. Pretty little bows
All your little dolls had the latest doll clothes
Now you're all grown up, and
Nobody knows what to do with you

[solo]

ATTITUDE! 90 Miles an hour
Down the wrong side of the rode
ATTITUDE! Look out world, 'cause:

Jenny's got the blues. (Jenny's calling)
She's busting loose. (Jenny's calling)
She's trying to reach out one last time
Jenny's got the blues (Jenny's calling)

[Repeat Chorus]
