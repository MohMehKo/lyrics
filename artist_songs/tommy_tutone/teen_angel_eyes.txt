I never knew it could be like this
Your eyes your kiss
I’ve never known such tenderness
Not til I met you
If I could only make you believe
That what he gives you isn’t what you need
But you see him you don’t see me
No matter what I try
My teen angel eyes
Keep on denying
I’ll stand right by your side
My teen angel eyes

There’s no telling how a love will grow
And no explaining when it starts to show
We’ll keep it hidden so no one will know
It came from your true love
They make us pay but they can’t forgive
What we’ve had together
Hear them talking bout those pregnant kids
Let them talk forever
My teen angel eyes
Just keep on denying
I’ll stand right by your side
My teen angel eyes

But now it’s tearing me apart
How could you give him back your heart
And I just bent back over
Why should he be your lover
When I stood by your side

Teen angel eyes
Keep on denying
I stood right by your side
My teen angel eyes
