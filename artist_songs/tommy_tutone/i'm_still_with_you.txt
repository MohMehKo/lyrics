When you first had your big dream (I was with you)
When you said it just couldn't be (I was with you)
I was there, when you said were afraid
I said go ahead, try it anyway
Now, you're here on graduation day
I can't stand this, but I couldn't stay away

'Cause I'M STILL WITH YOU (I'm still with you)
Though we're miles and minds apart
I'm still with you (I'm still with you)
Yeah you still live in my heart.

When you tried to climb that wall (I was with you)
When you were afraid to fall (I was with you)
I was there; I said stand upon my shoulder
I didn't let you go until you made it over
Now you finally got your pilots wings
Now you don't remember anything

But I'M STILL WITH YOU (I'm still with you)
Though we're miles and minds apart
I'M STILL WITH YOU (I'm still with you)
Yeah you still live in my heart

[Bridge:] 
Stand and take your bow
I knew then, and I still know it now
I'M STILL WITH YOU!

[SOLO]

[REPEAT BRIDGE]

I'M STILL WITH YOU (I'm still with you)
Yeah you still live in my heart
I'M STILL WITH YOU (I'm still with you)
Though we're miles and minds and miles and minds apart
