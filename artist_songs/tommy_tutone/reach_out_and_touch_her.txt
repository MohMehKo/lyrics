Reach out and touch her
She's right there you know
Not like the last time when you let it all go
All these years that you loved her
And you never let on
Always waiting for the moment
And then she was gone

All the things that you could have told her,
You should have told her,
The fact is that: she never knew
There's no one else can do it, son; no one but you

Reach out, and tell her you care
Reach Out; she's standing right there.
This is the chance you've been waiting for
All of these years
So REACH OUT AND TOUCH HER.
You know that you love her

All the things that you could have told her,
you should have told her,
The fact is that: she never knew
There's one else can do it, boy; no one but you

So REACH OUT AND TOUCH HER
She's right there you know
Not like the other times
Don't let it go
Yeah, REACH OUT AND TOUCH HER
REACH OUT AND TOUCH HER
REACH OUT AND TOUCH HER.
You know that you love her
