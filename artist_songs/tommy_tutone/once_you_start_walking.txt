Even though It's kind of cold outside
I'll get my jacket, and I take that ride away
'cause it's that kind of day
But I'll be thinking about a better time
A year that passed when things seemed to work out just fine
In their own way
I don't want to lose you, don't want to use you so easily
So hold out, hold out. Can't you see?

Once you start walking
We might never get back
Once you start walking away.

We've been chopping at this overtime
I came out here so I could unwind alone
Baby, what's gong wrong
Tried so hard to see what to say
We tried so hard but the words just got in the way
But I don't think it's all gone
Heaven and earth can't believe that we're fighting this way
So hold on, hold on one more day
Girl don't you know that:

Once you start walking
We might never get back
Once you start walking away.

Heaven and earth can't believe that we're fighting this way
So hold on, hold on one more day
Girl don't you know that:

Once you start walking
We might never get back
Once you start walking away.
Why don't we keep talking
We just can't let this fade
Once you start walking away.
Once you start walking away.
Once you start walking away.
