Baby gets worried when we go out together
I know she's thinkin' I'm thinkin' I could do better
We go to parties and she runs away
She says she don't know what to say
I wish she wouldn't run and hide
I need that woman by my side

Baby, it's alright
Baby, it's alright
It's alright you know I'll never leave you alone
No, oh no

Baby, I love you, and I'm no pretender
Just because it's hard, well, d-d-don't surrender
Don't picture some old-fashioned love
That's not what I'm thinking of
I don't think you'd like that kind
It's just not real, baby, you'll find

That it's alright
Baby, you're fine tonight
It's alright you know I'll never leave you alone
You know I'll never leave you alone
Alright, you know I'll never
Never leave you alone, yeah

I've got arms just made to hold you
I've got things I should have told you
I'll walk you right up to your door, girl
I need you in my life
More and more and more and more

Baby, it's alright
Baby, it's alright
It's alright you know I'll never leave you
It's alright you know I'll never leave you
It's alright you know I'll never leave you alone, baby
Leave you alone, babe

Baby, it's alright
Baby, you're fine tonight
It's alright you know I'll never leave you alone
It's alright you know I'll never leave you

Baby, it's alright
Baby, it's alright
It's alright you know I'll never leave you alone
It's alright you know I'll never leave you alone
It's alright you know I'll never leave you alone
