You know I never wondered
What was on your mind
I always knew the thunder
Would keep our love in line
I didn't want to believe her
When she said our love was through
I hear the sound of the concertina
Playing a song of solitude, oh, oh

Oh no, don't leave and not say goodbye
Don't leave me here to be swept away by the tide
Not say goodbye

Clouds drifting across the horizon
Covering the harvest moon
Waitin' for my fate's decision
Will my love rendezvous?
I call to you in desperation
You're the one for whom I sigh
But the night is full of apprehension
The howling wind only hears my cry, cryin', cryin'

Oh no, don't leave and not say goodbye
Don't leave me here to be swept away by the tide
It's not your style to relieve a man of his pride
Oh no, don't leave and not say goodbye

I call to you in desperation
You're the one for whom I sigh
But the night is full of apprehension
The howling wind only hears my cry
Cry, cry, cryin'

Oh no, don't leave and not say goodbye
Don't leave me here to be swept away by the tide
It's not your style to relieve a man of his pride
Oh no, don't leave and not say goodbye
Not say goodbye

Not say goodbye
Not say goodbye
Not say goodbye

Not say goodbye
Not say goodbye
Not say goodbye
