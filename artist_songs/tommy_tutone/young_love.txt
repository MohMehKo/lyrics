I sure miss us baby - we were really something
They're still talking about the way we ran wild
We were young and going steady
Dying for each other
On the phone or on the miracle mile
I've go from one to another
Since the world came up and tore us apart
But I wonder where you are and what you're doing tonight

It was young love
Hey but it was real love
Young love
Baby don't you know it was real love

I'm completely ready
Ready now to see you
This feels like one of our old nights
We'd be hiding from your daddy
Telling all our secrets
Nobody ever new me like that
I go from one to another
But it's always you I'm thinking of
I hear your voice in the wind tonight

It was young love
Hey but it was real love
Young love
Baby don't you know it was real love

Keep a walking. What was that whisper?
Hear me calling you across the years
Turn around; I'm right beside you
Maybe some day I'll be right there

[SOLO]

I Go from one to another
But it's always you I'm thinking of
I hear your voice in the wind tonight

[Breakdown]
And I see your face in the streetlights
And I'm calling you across the years
Saying "Baby, won't you come back
Baby won't you come

It was young love
Hey but it was real love
Young love
Baby don't you know it was real love
It was young love
Hey but it was real love
Young love
Baby don't you know it was real, real love
