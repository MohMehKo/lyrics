It's been a few years, since I packed my bags, left all I knew
Face fear, to define a life that's built on breaking through.
How much longer will it take, no I can't wait forever.
A picture painted in my mind, it seems my days are numbered.

Maybe I'm the one that's scared of all that we could make.
Maybe you're the one who left me on a lapse of faith.
But even when it seems the weight is far too much to take.
I won't collapse for anything.

You call, there's a quiver in your voice that I read.
"Give up, don't you think it's time you came back home to me.
You've been chasing a dream, but dreams don't last forever.
Though it means more than anything, at least we'll have each other."

Maybe I'm the one that's scared of all that we could make.
Maybe you're the one who left me on a lapse of faith.
But even when it seems the weight is far too much to take.
I won't collapse for anything.

Heart beat slow, guide me where to go.
It's taken long enough to get here, would I be better off
Cold but not alone. Here without a home.
Tell me why I can't quit shaking, while I'm bleeding at the stake
And I don't know anymore, what I'm really fighting for.
This is bigger than the both of us, you're the only one I trust anymore.

Maybe I'm the one that's scared of all that we could make.
Maybe you're the one who left me on a lapse of faith.
But even when it seems the weight is far too much to take.
I won't collapse for anything.

And what kills me, is how could you forget me?
I stayed right where you left me.
But open wounds cant heal when you're still tearing them apart.
And what fills me, is hope to find what's missing.
And I refuse to quit til I've rebuilt another heart.
