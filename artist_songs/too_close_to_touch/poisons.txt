Take a breath and a break to clear this bitter taste
that's in my mouth
To fight the fear of all we've thrown away
Still I lie here awake, with a chest so vacant
Sense of hope that our loves just latent
And I'm tired of just pretending,
we'll ever have a perfect ending
How could you give up on us, give up on me

And its killing me, how you willingly
You found somebody else along the way,
and you know that it's true

If you wouldn't suffocate your head
with what your heart misread, you'd see it all so clear
Swallow those lies, til it dies of the same old causes
Hope to God, that I cut your losses
But I swear, I'm done pretending
Its never going to be the same, again
We clench our teeth to hide the truth,
our tongues can taste the words they fail to speak
Fail to speak the truth

Maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm selfish
Say that I lose the things I love
Drown it all out, leaving me breathless
Keeping me safe til I wake up
Say what you want, you did this for fun
I know what you've done

And its killing me, how you willingly
You found somebody else along the way [x3]
I know that it's true
