If it's the will that has to be there, 
To find my way out of this hell that dwells inside of my head.
Then I'll find the hope I misplaced and fear faced without a doubt. 
In a sea of shipwrecked thoughts my lungs are filled with lead now.

I've been sinking so long.

What am I worth, what am I worth? 
Would it be easier to grow? 
It's better than keeping me alone, I know.
[x2]

I've never been the type to give in, 
Maybe it's that feeling in my bones,
That keeps me far from home.
I'm miles away from all that I know, 
Maybe it's too hard for me to quit
Down this path that's barely lit.

What am I worth, what am I worth? 
Would it be easier to grow? 
It's better than keeping me alone, I know.
[x2]

You know what's shaken me, is all the broken things. 
I'm picking up what never went missing.
Replace the piece of mind, fell out so far behind. 
So many words with a jaw still clenching.
But now I'm through with you, nothing to do with you. 
I'm giving up on what was never 
There for me this time.
Why don't you say it.

We will never make it on our own this time, 
You're wrong, you're wrong.
You're wrong, you're wrong.

What am I worth, what am I worth? 
Would it be easier to grow? 
It's better than keeping me alone, I know. 
[x3]

Every touch, every taste, every smell that
May escape from my lungs as I breathe in
The things I see 
May what I hear not shake me.
