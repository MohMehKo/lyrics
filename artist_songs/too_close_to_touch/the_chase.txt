A recurring dream that stings into my memory.
A thought of what could be, disintegrates and gets the best of me.
And I know we both know how, these types of things always go down.
But if I could find you know, we could remember what it's like to feel.

And if we slow this down, and take things slower this time.
Maybe find the time between the lines between the lines.

If you make me a part of your plan- pick me up just one time.
Don't let me fall out of your hands. [x2]
Well I won't let you.

The mind breaks down, the delicate design. 
Of where we've been, and what we've left behind.

And if we slow this down, and take things slower this time.
Maybe find the time between the lines between the lines.

If you make me a part of your plan- pick me up just one time.
Don't let me fall out of your hands. [x2]
Well I won't let you.

Give me a chance to make a move, whats left to lose
So much more that I want to prove- If i could get to you.
A recurring dream, that stings into my memory.

If you make me a part of your plan- pick me up just one time.
Don't let me fall out of your hands. [x2]
Well I won't let you.
