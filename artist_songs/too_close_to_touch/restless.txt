Oh, I'm stressing, rattling my brain for a feeling that's missing
Oh, I question everything it's taking the weight of my chest
But now I'm done, giving into the things they want
I've dealt with doubt enough, shutting out all the noise and all their distractions, now

All I know, I'm outta my head, 
Outta my mind do whatever makes us 
Lose control just for a night
Trapped under the city lights
[x2]

Look inside for what you think, either way, we're breaking free
Who needs sleep when we have the world at our feet
I'm thinking lately it's been hard to see
Under pressure, I'm on the edge again, let it take control
Shutting out all the noise and all their distractions

All I know, I'm outta my head, 
Outta my mind do whatever makes us 
Lose control just for a night
Trapped under the city lights
[x2]

Dangerously out of reach
Feel the earth beneath our feet
Chasing things we cannot see
Nothing's ever what it seems

Searching for another way
Truth is hard to find these days
Chasing things we cannot see
Nothing's ever what it seems
[x2]

All I know, I'm outta my head, 
Outta my mind do whatever makes us 
Lose control just for a night
Trapped under the city lights
[x2]
