Rewind back to then, see I was just a kid.
And I didn't know, oh Mother, where did he go?
And that solemn look she gave, oh God that image stayed.
The pain alive despite disguise, through her trembling lips and bloodshot eyes.

Paralyzed for a moment, bet your life you wouldn't stay.
Better hope we don't cross paths, cause there'll be hell to pay.
I am better without you. You couldn't love what you would undo.
I'm a man today, no thanks to you. All the feeling of regret, I hope you know what you left.
I'll never miss you.

See me, yeah I'm upset. And my brothers wont forget.
Introduced for the first time at 8 years old to a world so cold.
A cowards claim to fame, all for his selfish gain.
But his failed attempts to break our home, made us stronger than we'll ever know.

Paralyzed for a moment, bet your life you wouldn't stay.
Better hope we don't cross paths, cause there'll be hell to pay.

I know I never say it enough, what you did for both of us. You kept me strong.
Its hard enough to see the road that leads us home.
Its hard enough to walk when we cant bear the load, that's on our shoulders.
And when the day tries to break away, its hold on our soul, don't let go.

First time, through a broken life, seconds tick, running out of time.
Where were you when I needed you? You said you'd be there for me through and through.
You said you'd be there for me.

Paralyzed for a moment, bet your life you wouldn't stay.
Better hope we don't cross paths, cause there'll be hell to pay.

There'll be hell to pay. I'm a man today, no thanks to you. There'll be hell to pay.
