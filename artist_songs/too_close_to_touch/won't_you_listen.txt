Have we been blinded by the sights you sought to see?
Or maybe buried underneath a vision;
the person you thought you could make us be
The foresight of our life, caught between a rock
and a hard place, it leaves a bitter taste
Of tongue tied words you spoke in vain,
we hear nothing, nothing but promises

Saw you never face it But you could never shake it
You left the only thing that ever mattered at all
Alone you'll never make it Forever forced to fake it
You left the only thing that ever mattered at all

Are you happy? Do you hear me?
Did you feel our hearts breaking slowly?
Maybe all you care for is all you see,
shut our hope in a bottle and cast to sea
It's perceptions of what could have been,
what might have been, what should have been
Through these veins, out the pen
Stain the canvas every night
I'd be lying if I said I'm fine somewhat
It's hard to breathe when it's tight sealed shut

The foresight of our life, caught between a rock
and a hard place, it leaves a bitter taste
Of sorry slipping through your teeth,
and I know you know that, I'd be lying if I said
I'm fine somewhat I'm breaking free, today you'll see
that your words weren't enough
