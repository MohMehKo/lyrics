Bright eyes from headlights
And hope to find the place we used to sleep
I will do everything to fix this
Swear I can change
Don't let this fade

My trembling lips don't
Hide the hell that's streaming down your face
And you can't do anything to fix this
I hear you say too far away
Tell me it's different and mean what you say
You won't leave me hanging and you're not afraid

Don't ask me, don't ask me why
Why I wait for someone that won't show
Don't ask me, don't ask me how
How I stay awake when you're fast asleep
In a dream that does not involve me

Red eyes and tail lights
And open ended promises we made
I scream we could've fixed this
Ended our pain
Don't drive away
You know I'll wait

Don't ask me, don't ask me why
Why I wait for someone that won't show
Don't ask me, don't ask me how
How I stay awake when you're fast asleep
In a dream that does not involve me

It's hard to sleep these days
Left with a ghost and it won't go away
It's all that I have left
This wishful thinking
It's hopeless today
And that may not change

Don't ask me, don't ask me why
Why I wait for someone that won't show
Don't ask me, don't ask me how
How I stay awake when you're fast asleep
In a dream that does not involve me
