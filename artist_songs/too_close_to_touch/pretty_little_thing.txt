Just don't get me started on the simple things.
Right before you fly you fix the broken wings of.
Everything that carries you forward now. 
Patching up the holes remaining in your word now.
I start to question what is real or not. 
Pick apart my every thought.
Dig in to a dark place. 
Bury the thought of your face.

It's all right, it's all right.  
Tell me you need me 
Telling you that it's all right, it's all right, 
But you're no good for me.

Pretty little thing, attention only when in need, 
Cause you know that I'll cave in.
Pretty little thing, you know the way to make me weak.  
But I'll stand on my own feet.
Shame on you for hitting where it most hurts.  
Shame on me for listening.
Pretty little thing, I think you better turn away.  
My attention is ending.

Whatever helps you sleep at night, is certainly beside me.
Cause I've been searching for the answers 
On this old abandoned road you've built, desperate to see.

Just don't get me started on the simple things.  
Right before you fly you fix the broken wings of, 
Every single promise that you flew my way.  
Picking up that notion that you may come back.

It's all right, it's all right.  
Tell me you need me 
Telling you that it's all right, it's all right, 
But you're no good for me.

Pretty little thing, attention only when in need, 
Cause you know that I'll cave in.
Pretty little thing, you know the way to make me weak.  
But I'll stand on my own feet.
Shame on you for hitting where it most hurts.  
Shame on me for listening.
Pretty little thing, I think you better turn away.  
My attention is ending.

What if I was worth more to you, than every broken breath we take.
I hear your call, you're crying out, I scream your name.

Pretty little thing, attention only when in need.

Pretty little thing, attention only when in need, 
Cause you know that I'll cave in.
Pretty little thing, you know the way to make me weak.  
But I'll stand on my own feet.
Shame on you for hitting where it most hurts.  
Shame on me for listening.
Pretty little thing, I think you better turn away.  
My attention is ending.
