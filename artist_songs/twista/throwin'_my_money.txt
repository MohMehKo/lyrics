[Intro: R. Kelly]
In the club, throwin money
Turned up, Kells and the Twista

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
The way she work it on that pole (hah!)
Got me throwin my money, throwin my money
The way she twerk it on that pole (hah!)
Got me throwin my money, throwin my money
The way she pop it on that pole (hah!)
Got me throwin my money, throwin my money
The way she slide down on that pole (hah!)
Got me throwin my money, throwin my moneyyyyy

[Twista]
Pop that booty, let me watch it girl
Drop it, I will not knock it, better yet I'ma reach into my pocket girl
Watch it girl, she sluggin, come on over here cause I see what you doin
Tippin off the plenty booze
how you be attractin plenty dudes with the Jimmy Choo shoes you in
What you doin takes some talent, so I gotta say that I'm enjoyin what I witness
My, money flow is endless, lookin at her work that pole like a gymnast
Climbin up to the top, turn it upside-down, then open up her legs
Lookin sexy all the way to the bottom
I'm throwin dollars cause it look like she finna hit her head
Now she twirlin around it, then do a split right in front of it
Ready to go back up, when she look at how thick the money get
She do it caterpillar, ballerina, diamond toes, aerial and vert'
Full rockin inverted crucifix, fan kick
Po' pounds, windmills, stacks spin in reverse

[Chorus]

[R. Kelly]
I ain't got no plans tonight
Get somewhere, you can help me get my head right
And I love your swag, cause it's just like mine
Siamese, twins, freaky, you, we be, two, of a, kind
Strip club is our playground, she playin on her monkey bars
Up and down like a rollercoaster, I call that ass a theme park
Way she handle her business (business) from the sky she make it drop
My money no limit (limit) tonight I'm 'bout to go astronaut
Never ride solo, Mr. Franklin always with me
She done been around that pole so many times she should be dizzy (dizzy)
Rolex that's real time, these niggaz exaggeratin
Her ass can hold a glass, that's no exaggeratin

[Chorus]
