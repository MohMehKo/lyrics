Now I know it's been a long time since a muthafucka done made a good song about reefa 
And who better for you to handle this then a tidanamo with analys of the cannabis sativa 
Go and get a pillow and a cigerillo if I know it's the killa I'm yellin roll one up joe 
Open the backwood up trippin on me cause I was sloppy I better get fucked up though 
I be smokin 4 diffrent kinds of kush its the best of me especially the purple and the og 
But ya'll might call it the granddad rather safer and take a pull slowly 
Eye lids low ain't no doubt about it that somebodys gon peep me 
Go ahead and ride I think I'mma chill because I'm kinda sleepy 
Me and my niggas in my crew will get into it now we be at odds hardly 
Cause we smokin on a ounce of the ganja that bob marley 
Me a rock to the reggae music whenever me feel the spliff workin 
Kill off in any rudeboy if ya take away my herb its da earth sin. 

[Chorus]
Smokin on dat fire (smokin on dat fire) 
Puffin on dat dro (puffin on dat dro) 
Kush weed gets me higher (kush weed gets me higher) 
And da diesel get me blowed (and da diesel get me blowed) [x2]

Smell good, let me hit dat 
Blow kush wit 8 Ball & Mjg 
Smoke haze, I use to a seagal 
Freeway put me on to da backwoods 
And bleek introduced me to diesel 
And snoop turned me on to the chronic,
Smokin it I was feelin bionic,
Lookin at me rollin a blunt and I'm huffin and puffin and I cant get enough of this stuff,
And I'm loosin my logic, you can smell all of my folicals and imma follow you cuz of da dro,
But if it aint, I'm call my autobile,i be gettin nothin but love cuz I be smokin da bud,
Its lookin like its from a high time auto particles I be grindin up wit da hash
And I put some on yo blunt if you come up wit da stash,
So take it to the head its a gift from coupe but if I share it wit a bitch,imma be fuckin her ass,
Stay havin sessions and my ends is plenty,
So when I'm smokin my friends is wit me,
Make em feel da slow breeze cuz I blow trees like da windy city,
Let me call up da weed man cuz if we out, then shit we on it,
Me and you can hook up and go get an ounce and I got 250 on it 

Smokin on dat fire (smokin on dat fire) 
Puffin on dat dro (puffin on dat dro) 
Kush weed gets me higher (kush weed gets me higher) 
And da diesel get me blowed (and da diesel get me blowed) [x2]

[Lil Boosie]

Got me rippin track to track, like Webbie say where dat real at, dat one hit and you feel that,
