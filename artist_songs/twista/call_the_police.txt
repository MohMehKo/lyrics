[Chorus - Ray J]
We keep bombing like this...
They can call the police
And if we can keep making all this noise 
They’re gonna call the police
We wake up our neighbors
People got to go to work
And if we can keep making all this noise 
They’re gonna call the police

Hit it up against the wall like a beast
Hit it out in hall like freak
How we’re doing what we’re doing
I don’t see anybody up in the building 
I got no sleep
How we’re gonna get all these people out
Noise bumping up against the ..
And they .. somebody gonna ..
Call off the landlord
I’m a freak up in the sheets
Especially when I’ll be fucking up to the beat
The neighbors said if we keep it up
They’re gonna have to call the police
And we’re gonna be up in the streets
Cause I act like a fool 
When my chick gets so .. when she wants
..
You’re about to, this hotel if you keep on screaming
You’re about to .. out the crib if you keep on screaming
Making love is terrific
Whenever I hit her
We never knew how loud we were
We make noise too much turn the radio up
..

[Chorus]

I’m gonna hit it now
We can do all night
Baby turn around
On the bed line
On the coach line
On the floor line
...
We better stop all this noise
They’re gonna mess around
They’re gonna call these boys
I get bombing in the house
I get everybody in the room ..
And all of my neighbors
They would be ...
And if we decide from some liquor
Let me see where I can find some from
The damage I can do .. guarantee 
Somebody call the 911
All the freaky noise that you make ..
Let me put this .. in the face
You’re gonna wake somebody up
Even though I paid the rent for the crib
I don’t really wanna cause a .. because
.. domestic violence
So we got to do it in silence

[Chorus]
