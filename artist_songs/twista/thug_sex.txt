[Intro: Twista (Quozel Benton)]
We can thug fuck if you want to
Shawty show me what you gon' do
(Baby let me see what you got)
(See if you can hit my G-spot)
We can thug fuck if you want to - rough sex
Shawty show me what you gon' do - I fuck you hard
C'mon let me see what you got - work it girl
See if I can hit the G-spot

[Twista]
Let me see your ass up in the air
Fuck holdin your waist baby, let me pull your hair
You ain't gotta worry 'bout a nigga cummin too fast
I can fuck you for two hours with my thumb in your ass
Oooooooooooh - off a shot of Patr√≥n
I can hit you with some hard dick all night long
How I cut I'm not a wanksta
Bitches love me cause I fuck like a gangsta
Now bring it back shawty, other motherfuckers poke too slow
I grip ya neck and fuck ya fast while I choke ya hoe
I'll load you up with a banana clip
You fuckin with dude but Twista got a fatter dick
Won't you come and try this shit
We in the bed long, shawty know her legs long
Baby I'm a freak, I hope you like to get head long
And don't get shit on my face
After I fuck you good I'ma let you sit on my face
Now c'mon shawty

[Chorus: Twista (Quozel Benton)]
We can thug fuck if you want to - rough sex
Shawty show me what you gon' do - I fuck you hard
C'mon let me see what you got - work it girl
See if I can hit the G-spot - like that
(We can thug fuck if you want to) Rough sex
(Come and show me what you gon' do) I fuck you hard
(Baby let me see what you got) Work it girl
(See if you can hit my G-spot)

[Twista]
You ain't gotta ask "Did he hit her?"
When it come to sex I'm gettin mo' pussy than kitty litter
I'm a big freaky muh'fucker, when I hit you you gon' have to get sprung
I'll treat you like a cat, give you a bath with my tongue
Oooooooooooh - jaws droppin off what I'm poppin
I don't give a fuck cause this be dope when I see y'all rockin
In the club throwin bubble up
Shitted on them when I pulled in a Lexus bubble up, shawty come and cuddle up
Spent two-fifty on me, a 'dro sack (or some kush)
I get high then go break the hoe back (and that's real)
I bust a nut cause the ass was so soft (ain't it man)
Got in my car, dropped the top, and drove off {skrrrrt}
Look at the time on my circular watch
Hit the hood and make sure the shawties got some work on the block
I'm immaculate when it come to hustlin
If it's beef I'm who they have to get when it come to bustin
Thug when it come to fuckin

[Chorus]

[Twista]
Got some fiends, bring them in, bring a friend
I lean and bend cause I'm sippin on Seagrams gin
in some cranberry or over soda
Shawty come and put my numbers in your Motorola, later you can hold a boulder
Cause strict lil' mama, I'm Twist' lil' mama
The one that have you ridin Benzes sippin Cris' lil' mama
I'm the one chillin up in V.I.P.
Can't get in unless I let you, even if I see I.D., ooh what a G I be
If you ain't thuggin then shawty you gotta go (ain't it man)
Cause I got my homies at the front do' (that's chuuch)
Can't get in unless you in the ghetto zone
If you wild I wanna fuck you with those stilettos on
Oooooooooooh - let's bring some heat in the place
Do I have to skeet on yo' waist or can I skeet in yo' face?
If they ever ask you if Twista a classy nigga
Tell them "Naw, that nigga thuggin, he a nasty nigga"
So what's up shawty?

[Chorus]
