Yeah, yeah, just how long little momma? I'm coming through in a minute
Done here, put that little pink thang on for me, through, twister

I'll have you going, have you by the flowing, every time you think of me
And when they play my song I'll have you in the phone, sweating and you waiting for me

You sweating and you waiting, sweating and you waiting, sweating and you waiting for me [x2]

I see little momma in the mood, she thinkin about you, she really want bad
Body ready for kissin and huggin and the bear but... call you dad
Listen what you gonna be spendind because the words coming out of my mind is pow
My hat... I get you... even through you got out the shower
He gonna be the a last an hour so you gotta... twisted to get freaky
Body dripping with sweater you listen the cutter I bust you go nuts if you see me
I wanna pick her out of the mouth when she wrecking another motherfucker to hit it against the hair tool
And if they let me gonna be fucking with then let my music get prepared for
Scrip from my shot shot caulder,.. fucking with a boulder
The ice... marvey get with the flow, I can turn a room with a bear to a sauna
And never tells you it's a celebration because you're about to be the one girl
And you gonna... and listen to me, you wait for me to come and I'm about to beat it up

I'll have you going, have you by the flowing, every time you think of me
And when they play my song I'll have you in the phone, sweating and you waiting for me
That's right, sweating and you waiting, sweating and you waiting, sweating and you waiting for me [x2]

Now even through you're not so classy, you see... when I talk so nasty
And I love it when you tell your secret to telly cause you take it out so sassy
Look how I touch you when I spike that juice, mmm, do you like that boob?
And I got up in the strawberry's a whip cream, cause I be loving the way you wipe that fruit
I take of piece of them then put it right back, to squeeze the... back
And I go down and lick it at the crime,.. you don't know how to act
So does... and you be waiting, nobody be sweating but your heart be racing
... time's a crime, but you're trying to exercise your patience
Then I pull up the acupuncture looking... while I'm acting...
Then she's telling me the topper, the topper, the topper, until I give away
She sais I never let the white... alone and take me home and make me more
Cause I be coming with the shit that makes you hot
I think you better turn the AC on

I'll have you going, have you by the flowing, every time you think of me
And when they play my song I'll have you in the phone, sweating and you waiting for me
Oh yeah, sweating and you waiting, sweating and you waiting, sweating and you waiting for me [x2]

It's another one for ya, some of you can bump in night
When you're getting ready for whoever to come do that
You all know how Twista does it
