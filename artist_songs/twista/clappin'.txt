[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Killers on deck, my semi's up to bat
My money on first, and my niggaz in the back
Don't be surprised nigga if we start blastin
We get it, we get it, we get it clappin

[Twista]
I got the whole team ready for whatever
We gettin money so I could be never scared to face y'all
Killers on deck, money on first, semi up to bat
I guess it's a deadly game of baseball
Motherfuckers is snitchin and bitchin to authority 
who would do whatever to get you to court
These niggaz juiced up on steroids 
and this is the Mitchell Report
Performance enhancement drugs 
will make a nigga wanna take a chance with slugs
Try to stick a nigga up for extortion 
because you workin on a tip, they scandalous
Ain't no runnin over here takin nothin 
cause we gon' get to bustin if they don't explain they self
These killers late '80s babies
They don't honor shit, and yo' mayne in jail
Better come over here like a hyper asked for white
Don't be comin like a G and try to ask for turf
Semi-automatic'll send you to the afterlife
Holier dome lookin like after-birth
Took a stand but you thought I woulda ran 
if I didn't understand the plan because I can I can
Couldn't talk man-to-man 
but now yo' momma cryin in the ambulance ("My baby!")
When he was teachin I wasn't to hold you miss the preliminary 
so now yo' body layin in the cemetery
Now your family reminiscin and sayin you shoulda listened 
whenever they lookin at yo' obituary
Told you we got the game on lock
We the champions of the league, we be ready to bleed
If you wanna get it crackin you're gonna be comin after when I bust
I make 'em back up [?] because I got the

[Chorus w/ ad libs]

[Twista]
The only way that I could be on my empire 
is if I was callin the shots like I'm the umpire
And I got the bitches callin the pimps sire 
but if I go out on the block it's only gunfire
Thinkin you can make it to the ninth inning 
but the whole game is another level and dimension
Like when the niggaz put you on the pedestal 
attention quickly turn into medical attention
Plenty whips you probably be in 
cause you got that right block
Talkin shit like Ozzie Guill√©n 
cause you got that (White Sox)
'Til you suffer consequences and repercussions 
because of a homie who was snitchin and walkin with the law
Now you ain't tippin no more, but you be thinkin you hard
so you gon' try to take it from another nigga? Naw
Now you come up for the money like you Iron Man
when you should've just asked politely
Now I let it rip, cause I got the clip
then my metal bitch, and I call her Aphrodite
Motherfucker I'm alpha mighty
You think I'ma let you just take my guap?
Round here we put a bullet in the head of pinch hitters
nigga you can't take my spot
Cause I know you can't take my Glock
If you come at me I gotta make that pop
I get money, you put hundred dollar bills over the ones
nigga you gotta fake my knot
You ain't gon' be able to make that stop
but I could make a bitch make that drop...

[Chorus - repeat 2X]
