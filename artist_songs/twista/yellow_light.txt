Hey hey heeeyy hey. 
HEY! HEY! 
Sometimes I go fast 
Sometimes I just stop 
Sometimes I take it slow, when I let the sex drop 
But most of the times I go qu qu qu qu quick 
When I'm hittin that shit, and she like it, she like it 
But tonight she said she dident want to go too fast, 
And tonight she said she want me to take my time 
So, I took her down and asked her if she liked that, and she say hell yea 
Then I started to hit it from the back said its cool and she said hell yea. 
She said ohh baby just take controll baby as long as you take it slow baby 
And we can hit it all night baby 
She gave me the green so I had to go 
Start screamin my name on the window 
And everytime I start goin real fast, she looked at me and said 

Yellow light 
HEY 
Yellow light 
HEY 
Yellow light 
HEY 
Yellow light 
Gota slow it down 
Yellow light 
HEY

Yellow light 
Gota slow it down 

I told her that I want to beat it up fast 
So mama let me know when your down 
Tonight she dont want a drill section 
She wanna feel it so she told me to take it sloww 
Im so used to mackin it pokin it back to back 
When I attackin it I wanna go n get inn 
She blew the whistle like *whistle* be still 
Hold it in now roll it in 
She lifted her pumps to hold my face 
Because she want me to control my pace 
She said she wanna feel it all 
Slidin through the wiffles of the walls 
Cause the feelin was too cold to wait. 
Well I can bring it 
Down to 50 
Down to 40 
Down to 30 
Any speed you want me to 
I can do, for you.

Green too fast 
Red too slow 
She want it in the middle so I gotta 
Yellow light.
