[Chorus] 
I'm doin' me 
And you should do you 
Why you worried 'bout me 
You need to worry 'bout you 
I'm-I'm doin' me 
And you should do you 
Why you worried 'bout me 
You need to worry 'bout you 
Yeah boy I do 
And you should do you 
Yeah boy I do 
And you should do you 
Yeah-yeah boy I do 
And you should do you 
Why-you-why-you worried 'bout me 
You need to worry 'bout you 
Yeah boy I do 

[Verse 1] 
Act-act-act-act a damn fool 
Ball and I talk shit on every cut I do 
(Yeah boy I do) 
Dr-dress like it's my duty 
The stitchin' in the pants 
Match the brown in my Gucci 
(Ya-ya-ya-ya-yeah boy I do) 
Blow-blow-blow one before court 
Then pull up on your block in the new four door Porsche 
(Yeah-yeah boy I do) 
Talk-talk business on my cellular 
Smoke a lot of weed 
And make money on the regular 
(Yeah boy I do) 
Be-be-be-be about mine 
Take my cars to the club in a single file line 
(Yeah boy I do) 
Windy City campaign 
Fuck the orange juice 
I mix the 'Tron with the champagne 
(Ya-ya-ya-yeah boy I do) 
A hundred thousand for the watch 
A hundred thousand for the car 
A couple thousand for the Glocks 
(Yeah boy I do) 
Get-get nice I do 
See the way the outfit match up with ice I do 

[Chorus] 

[Verse 2] 
St-st-stay fuckin' with the crooks 
Peel the backwood 
And mix the sour diesel with the kush 
(Yeah boy I do) 
Smoke-smoke out my perimeter 
This Benz is so-so sick 
That they gonna have to take my temperature 
(Ya-ya-ya-yeah boy I do) 
Stay flooded like a star 
Make the color of the diamonds 
Match the color of the car 
(Yeah-yeah boy I do) 
Play-play a G-shock 
If I'm in the club 
I got on the AP watch 
(Yeah boy I do) 
Stay-stay sippin' on the Goose 
Then throw twenties 
At the thickest one in here that's gettin' loose 
(Yeah boy I do) 
The da-the damn thing soon 
As I get up in the motherfuckin' champagne room 
(Ya-ya-ya-yeah boy I do) 
Range Rover white body 
White 24 Vellano's 
While you sittin' on Asanti 
(Yeah boy I do) 
The tr-truck candy blue 
Suede interior 
Killin' 'em with the strut I do cuz 

[Chorus] 

[Verse 3] 
No-nothin' less than stackin' dollars 
And I stay lookin' fresh 
In nothin' less than Parish and Prada 
(Yeah boy I do) 
I'm only fuckin' with ya boss 
I ain't gotta break it down 
I just get it all off 
(Ya-ya-ya-yeah boy I do) 
Ma-ma-move-move with alarm 
I'm not a shark in the water 
I'm a school of piranha 
(Yeah boy I do) 
In the Maybach on my iPad 
Shut the curtain on the haters 
Whenever I ride past 

[Chorus]
