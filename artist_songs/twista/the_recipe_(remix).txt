[Intro]
Reloaded
That’s right, Twista dot com
Shut the thick short drum
Dru wuddup
Ruby Hornet
Who you know do it better
Than the number 1 co-signer?
That’s right

[Hook]
You might catch me in that leather
Looking like a baws
No one thinks they’d never have me
But he hit me up
Texas, I be screwed up
Shot town, I be really getting it
But nothing like my own town, I’m forever living
They come for (on the way you runnin’ for the wind when we together)
Women we wanted got that wonder we weather
Know that sound, they were coming big
What what more can I say?
Well welcome to LA

[Verse]
We live in the city, the shire’s cold
Cold, woa, when the winter cold I feel every bit of dope
I feel like a gyroscope
So off balance is a challenge to be runnin’ from murder
You bitch upon yourself
From the inner feeling spirit that burning that
Can have a taste of butter for me
How I never try ‘em though
Religiously realest
But if runnin’ my opponent if he want it
A product of my environment though
Can see I’m a cook
I’m on the front porch blowin’ eons of kush
A G, I’m a G, I’m a G
Genius, I run with the money like kids will cross me on his book
Nickin’ 2-50 2 cards in the deck
Then if at the way you want it, November season the winter
Said you’ll fill your heart with respect
Fin the knuckles if you don’t the situation could be pretty icky
Nigga what I’m back
My niggas we dine in my city then when I’m in the whack
Go pimpin’ then I’m feeling like I’m that
You scarin’ the violinist and go take a little bit of that
Too ‘bove when I’m on the west side
Had a little bit of haze when I had a bad style
But this be the best style
If I had any kind of luck if you say you have a better bag
And remember that fire
Cuz some of this give some of that
We can smoke until we burn my whole house down
Left eye, can’t spend it all, can’t smoke it all, can’t hit ‘em all
I don’t give a fuck, let’s try
Knowin’ I’m the remedy
Nigga when the killer’s up, checks on enemies
Shot town be the shit
But I finna take a trip to give me some of the west coast trinity

[Hook]
You might catch me in that leather
Looking like a baws
No one thinks they’d never have me
But he hit me up
Texas, I be screwed up
Shot town, I be really getting it
But nothing like my own town, I’m forever living
They come for (on the way you runnin’ for the wind when we together)
Women we wanted got that wonder we weather
Know that sound, they were coming big
What what more can I say?
Well welcome to LA
