American gangsta, U.S hustla 
Home of the brave and in god we trust 
Im just a American gangsta, U.S hustla 
Home of the brave and in god we trust 
Im just a American gangsta 

[Verse]
Chi-town bred 
Cuz I gotta rep my city to the death 
Annialate them till I dont see nothin left 
Remember I spit it for the bitches 
Now I'm spittin for the thugs 
Hat cocked to the right 
Hat cocked to the left 
Brotha its a formal 
Its a focus on ya chest 
I spit it for the lords, and the for the folks and for the crips and for the bloods 
Im like an american dream 
Role to the green, with the souls and the breeds and the cobras a kings and the 2-16 
Millimeter bullets from the niggas that 
Tryin to do opposite. 
They dont really wanna see how phyco I can get 
I dont really see a mutha fucka stoppin this 
Tryin to come at u and the apocalypse 
.40 cal will have ya screamin, I dont wanna die 
I am becomin nauseous with the fake thugs 
So its love 
To the real G's and all the boss's 
To the niggas in the caller case 
That got into it big 
To get wut nobody gave us 
We was born into this system, so dont be mad at what u made us. 
Pull the pistol and cock it and bust in the sky 
One time for the U.S, for turnin my niggas to gangstas cuz gettin money is what they do best. 
Hard to fight like I ever did like Al Capone 
Gangsta's is boss's, 
K-town is the mutha fuckin hood, the Rock is the company, come and step into my office. 

[Chorus]
American gangsta, U.S hustla 
Home of the brave and in god we trust 
Im just a American gangsta, U.S hustla 
Home of the brave and in god we trust 
Im just a American gangsta, U.S hustla 
Home of the brave and in god we trust 
Im just a American gangsta, U.S hustla 
Home of the brave and in god we trust 
Im just a American gangsta 

[Verse]
Forever see me in a lack 
Got work but ya never see me in a pack 
A mutha fucka said he never seen me with a strap 
And I heard a mutha fucka say he dont see me in the hood. 
Lil nigga I dont see u, cuz homie my hood is worldwide, and gettin money is wut we do. 
Make ya knee joints lock when I freak u 
Hit the 3 point shot like Hedo 
Turkoglu up in the game 
U killin the game like pac, nigga we point glocks like he do, see u. 
No one will recognize I'm the maker of the Midwest 
Im like for real? 
Controversy in the middle.... 
I guess I'm like shaquille. 
U can go on feel like ya feel 
Nigga kno the hands I like to kill 
But if u can hit me with the bangs 
Lil cheap for shit, lets strike the deal 
Got my phycos in the city rollin wit me 
Always ready busta cap at the king like duuu. 
I can bury ya bodies like an animal 
Because I'm a cannibal, I eat a nigga like food. 
Rippin thru ur flesh so I can devour the heart 
Music is my playground, but if the rappin dont get you,
I hit this head with the back of the pistol until this bitch nigga lay down. 
And no competition I had to be fuckin a twig? 
Whoever comin for me gangsta, ima get it everytime I wanna get it. I'm living proof 
Its a category F5.
