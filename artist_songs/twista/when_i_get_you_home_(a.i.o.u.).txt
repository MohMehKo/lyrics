[Hook:]
Wanna get u home, home
Wanna get u home, home
Wanna get u home, home
Wanna get u home

Wanna get u home, home
Wanna get u home, home
Wanna get u home, home
I’m going home

[Chorus:]
U keep on talking all that shit up on ya 2-way and ya phoonnee
Girl, but when I get u home (hit it, hit it uh oh)
U and I alone (hit it, hit it uh oh)
And the house is (A A)
And the bed is (I I)
Bathroom is (O O)
And the kitchen is (U U)
When I get home
U and I alone

[1st Verse - Twista:]
Now come and tell me where u get dat from
Now Twista he out here messing with all da ladies
Ask what I wanna hit dat fo’
Cuz u sexy and I’m a balla baby
Ask me why I got a nasty mouth
U da one steady trippin wit da sassy mouth
But when get u into da apartment that’s when it get up and sparkin
And that’s when we let all da passion out
Like da way u walk in slow in da room
And smelling sweet as a rose
And looking good in da red thong
Looking thick as hell do it to me well
Got me sprung
And I know I got ya head gone
Either slow or faster girl
When I gone how u trippin is a disaster
When I step up to da tunes of da neptunes u wanna bring drama
And that’s when I gotta ask u girl why

[Chorus]

[2nd Verse - Twista:]
When u were sleep last night
After rubbin u down and making passionate love
I put on a pair of Air Force Ones, six figures of jewelry
And met my guyz at da club
Pulled up out front and we had to stunt
Homie was sittin’ on 26s
We about to do da dummy from da blow
Blow a little money steady in da scummy wit these bitches
That’s about when u stunt in da car
Tell my whole mothafuckas how I stunt at da bar
Cuz u startin trippin when u were in da crib sleep
But u don’t even need to get started at all
U know I’m in da V.I.P.
Lookin at all this ass and I’m finna to leave
I’m finna to cut u as soon as I’m out
But u steady u gotta gotta wit da mothafuckin drama
Girl shut up what da fuck is talkin about

[Chorus]

[3rd Verse - Pharrell:]
Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey 
Girl don’t u worry about me fallin to sleep
Girl it’s early
I’ll kiss u up from ya head to feet don’t u worry
My appetite is no thin, sweet and nothin so curvy
I grab u like we don’t have all night
Even though it’s early
Trippin on me when I go to da mall
Trippin on me when I go to da club
Trippin on me when I kick it wit my boyz
U be trippin on me when I’m on da tour bus
U don’t trip when I getcha gone
U don’t trip when I getcha chrome
U be trippin on me when I’m away from u
But I bet u don’t trip when I get u home

[Hook]

[Chorus]

A A
I I
O O
