[Intro]
(You about to take them panties off)
This that 2011 shit, Twista, uhh
(You about to take them panties, b-b-bout to take them panties off)

[Chorus: 3pc]
Panties ooooooooff
You about to take them panties oooooooooff
Ohhhhhhh ohh ohh yes!
Panties ooooooooff
(You about to take them panties off)
You about to take them panties oooooooooff
(You about to take them panties, b-b-bout to take them panties off)

[Twista]
You ain't gotta try to exaggerate the way you walk 
or give a side profile, I see it
Fillin me with euphoria when I peep it
I wanna see you in Victoria's Secret
Body look like it should a straight stuntin
If somebody say they don't like it then they frontin
We go on a date and then all of a sudden
I got you in the room gettin at ya buttons
Got you down to your sexy underwear 
so when you're ready for pleasure baby you lookin at the help (yeah)
Sit back and blow one
and watch you dance in the mirror while you lookin at yourself (hey)
And I love how you lay back in the bed 
and open up your legs like "Come and get this daddy"
Then it was off for whatever I got on my body 
because she a hottie, I wanna hit this gladly
I ain't finish undressin her so I started kissin and huggin 
and caressin her then I took the top off
How my tongue got her squirmin and movin and archin her back
I think she ready for somethin to pop off
And I can see you got a pretty thong
I wanna freak your body 'til the A.M.
So ain't no reason for you to keep 'em on
She hot so I think she finna take them

[Chorus]

[3pc] Ohhhhhhh ohh ohh yes!

[Twista]
She lookin better than a burger with cheese
Started takin off her clothes with ease
I see the panties, do I wanna rip these? 
Or do I want a striptease?
One side at a time
Pull 'em down with your thumbs like a freak
Or do you wanna lay down
and let me take 'em off with my tongue and my teeth?
Cause I ain't see the whole ass yet
Let's get down to the bare assets
If it take too long to get past that
I'ma think you too scared to have sex
If we was in the position I'll have to pull it in the ride 
I will pull 'em to the side
But we in the lavish condo in Chicago 
way up high on flo' fifty-five
Takin off your clothes get me high
Mama got looks like granddaddy kush
Grind on her with the soul pole
Now she about to take 'em off and let me get to the bush
Swoosh, two points
I know I'm about to score so it ain't no more relaxin
The Twista finna get into some action 
cause I can see lil' mama about to snatch them

[Chorus]

[3pc]
Ohhhhhhh ohh ohh yes!
...
Panties ooooooooff
You about to take them panties oooooooooff
