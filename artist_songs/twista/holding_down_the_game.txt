[Intro]
Chi town balla k town nigga
Runnin through the streets with my hands on the trigga
And on the block smokin weed with hash
When I breeze pass
I'm bout to run through the game like I was steve nash

Naw naw T naw I feel that shit man but we gotta come with some of that
Origianal twista shit you know
Some of that chi town playa shit you know you know that old shit man lets
Kick that shit T
Alright I got ya cause

[Verse 1]
Take a look at my impala
Make 'em take a look at my chevy capris
Now take a look at my platinum bu500 benz rolling through the streets
In the city of the goals
Shit making money is the mission
I'ma glistenin killin off the competition
Steady tipping cause of how I be pimpin hoes
Now I know just how to treat 'em cause I need 'em
I don't really got to beat 'em so we cool
As long as they bring me my money
Got 'em walkin survin ass with a passion
While I'm talkin better never see you laughin
Know I gotta show 'em ain't a damn thing funny
Twista got game
Finna spit it to 'em hard
Get your dame
Put 'em on the boulivard
Now I got 'em in training with my bottom bitch
She can learn a lot a shit
Like how to get it on a stroll
Be in control and shit on the other hoes
And be able to get fedy for her daddy from a lot a tricks
But the thump bumpin speakers in the trunk
Cause a nigga have to cop a little some some
Leavin niggaz bodies slump when I let the thumpa dump
If I ever catch you fukin with the bump bump
Like a diamond I'm flawless
Aint no fucking with rawness
When you enter my vacinity better be cautious
If you into makin money step into my office
Makin hoes close shop
My flow caine got the block hot
Two for tens got me swoopin' through the city in the drop top
Screamin out I just don't give a fuck
I'm the truth in the booth from when you see me coming through with the crew
I make you do what I do
I'm a win for the city
For the chi till I die cause theres just no givin up

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I'm holdin down the game
What would you be hatin for
I'm a playa from the go with the shit that you've been waitin for
I'm holdion down the game
Show me how you get buck lil momma
You can make a buck the momma
Niggaz out here like to fuck lil momma

[Interlude]
Take a look at my japer
Now come look at the diamonds up in the ears
Now come take a look at the gators
Jumpers and 150 hat crocadile on the bib
And the ice on my charm
Man I'm no joke came up big in the 04
Now as fast I can kill 'em with the slow flow
Specially if I been smokin that hydrogen bomb

Shit man now thats what I'm talking about
Now thats that origianl twist right there man
Man but you know what man lets gon slow it down man
And take it down south houston style cause

[Verse 2]
Chi town balla
K town nigga
Runnin through the street with my hand on the trigga
And on the block smokin weed with hash when I breeze pass
I'm bout to run through this game like I was steve nash
Aint no fuckin with the twista when I toss words
Thats the 22 up against a moss berg
Feel the thump in your trunk from the fatty chacer
Alias auralius nigga call me gladiator
Spittin screw words at a screw pace
2 times stronger than them bitches call me screw face
You fuckin with a real ass nigga
Stuffin pockets tryin to make 'em bigger
Gotta let you know

[Chorus]
