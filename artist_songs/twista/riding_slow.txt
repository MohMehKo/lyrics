No no car, no nothing, I was hustling (Straight up)
I was selling game on the bus (You hear me)
Crunch time, I love pressure nigga, I could win the game...

I hit the high way in the drop top
Riding like ain't no wind feeling cocky cuz the roof gone
To the head if I have but I better to be blowing in the wind
And I'm rolling with a bad bitch
And she rolling up a wood for me
Then light it up for her, god fly she me looking good for me
Hold it when we in the hood for me
45 under her thigh, we be only doing lavish shit
The way that you only be imagining it
When access to the finer things
I hit the block up with designer clothes
Fucking with the finest hoes
In that Gucci and diamond rings
And I got the hook up on what I want
What I need, no fuck need fee
I get it for the good price
A nigga that you should be envious of
Blowing plenty of drugs
I could show you what it look like

[Hook:]
I'm riding slow and smoking gold
If you say that I'm the man
Riding with the top down
Riding slow and smoking gold
In the whip getting booty
With the roof drop down
Riding slow and smoking gold
I can get it how I want it
I can get it how I need it
Riding slow and smoking gold
Riding slow and smoking gold
Riding slow and smoking gold

I get the blunt up out the Resealable pack a backwoods
And I put it in the sky
Far from a rookie cookies in this a fact I got good
And I'm only blowing with you if you in my circle
If you fucking with the click, I hit you with the purple (Kush)
I'm the one to go and get to hit you with some murbles
And I hope you got some bitches with you when I serve you
And I'm rolling in the Jag now
Blowing heavy just for fucking with the traps
And I got them doing dimes now
Holla at me if you fucking with the waps
I make the room drop cuz what I know will get them right
They was thinking I would soon stop
Until I broke a piece of the moon rock and put it in the pipe

[Hook:]
I'm riding slow and smoking gold
If you say that I'm the man
Riding with the top down
Riding slow and smoking gold
In the whip getting booty
With the roof drop down
Riding slow and smoking gold
I can get it how I want it
I can get it how I need it
Riding slow and smoking gold
Riding slow and smoking gold
Riding slow and smoking gold
