I'm calling ya daddy (daddy)
Can you be my daddy (daddy)
I need a daddy (daddy)
Won't you be my daddy (daddy)

Come and make it rain down on me
Come and make it rain down on me

[Verse 1]
Now come and kick it with the Twista
Black Caddy, Mack Daddy,
With a hoe up in the back seat
With the '97 pimp flow
Gotta feeling when you smocking
When I flip it to a track speed ?
Talking about a beautiful figure
Astonishing as Greek mythology
Body be just like a girl in uh..
What's that movie? nevermind
Let me enter your atmosphere
As you enter my world
And lemme touch that booty
I can't believe that your momma that cold
Her daughter got such an astonishing soul
You need a modeling role
Still a player know you got it
When you climbing from the bottom
To the top of that pole
Cause you can pop and control
Your fatty's so accurate
When I'm smacking it
It's making me say
"What I gotta do to get with that?"
When it come to making it rain,
I can get it wet
When it come to cuttin the monkey
I can get it wet
You gone see me to ya baby
You need a better man
Here come the politics,
I'm gonna be your weatherman
Cause everytime I'm lookin up
And I see more ass
I'm gonna constantly see
Rain in the forcast
This-a-way that-a-way
I'm flicking 5,000 ones
Or whatever you wanna call it
It's a celebration
You the champion
Here's the fetti confetti
Come on and get drunk
with the money hauler?

[Chorus]
You done been good,
But you can do better
I done been wet,
But I can get wetter
Come and make it rain down on me
[x2]

[Verse 2]
But when I'm not for the feminine
And everybody that perceive with the hatred
I'm gonna teach them a lesson
I take shots of adrenaline
Cause that's the way I receive immunization
Against the recession
I got the muscle off my hustle and flow money
An entrepreneur with ways to get more money
So don't be trippin whenever you see me throw money
Hah. It's just a little bit of show money
But if you want me to get it wet another ways
Then I'm gonna have to beat it up the first time I play with you girl
Touch your ears and your neck and play with your pearls
Then I reach up in your pants and play with you pearl?
When I lay you down you ain't gotta be fronting or faking
On me baby cause I know it takes the right touch
I ain't stoppin til you wet up the covers
Because I gotta keep on fucking til I see a lot of white stuff
Now you got me excited I can't hold it
I'm feeling it coming I'm bout to let off an explosion
Let it ride when I see you I'm animated and shaking
When I touch your body you catchin convulsions
That's when I know I'm doing what I'm supposed to
You chose me. I chose you.
Don't think I can get it wet? I told you
Come and let the Twist rain down on you

[Chorus (x2)]
