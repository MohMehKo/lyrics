[Chorus X2]
Talk to me 
Thats the only way I can find out whats going on 

Now how and the fuck am I supposed to Know whats goin on 
You nowin the truth but you steady just be holdin on 
You harboring feelings but you don't be tellin me 
When you be see'n me would it be better if we was hollin on the phone 
They tellin me you got a problem, if its a cancer 
Baby the twista got tha cure that can solve it I got the answer 
Too many guys, too many guns 
Plenty muscle when I hustle 
You think a nigga was takin enhancers 
We need to holla and get it resolved like gentelmen 
Because if we don't I got those the turn niggas feminine 
I'ma pursue when I pop it to'em they're goin to be choppin and screwin as if I swallowed a bottle of benalyn 
I'ma just goin to end up and dumpin if we just don't holla bout somethin 
Because you just might makin a plot to come murder me 
Oh, your word to be, open heart surgery 
Yeah you got a white t but I'ma be turnin motherfucka burgundy 
I think there's a better way that we can handle this 
So sit down and talk at the table, we got to be adamant 
Takin a ride, and choppin it up in the phantom 
As two niggas breakin it down like an analyst off the with cannabis 
He say, she say 
A nigga was steady be hearin the bogus remarks 
Thought I was goin to have to go get it when it get dark 
We talked about it, shit squashed 

[Chorus]

Now how will I ever be knowin about when struggles arrive 
If you don't be open enough to let me see inside 
Right on the surface of things you thinkin that he's still alive 
But since he's been incarcerated his spirit has died 
He's sittin off up in the county while he goin be fightin a case 
I'm seein the pain cause I'm lookin him right in his face 
Never got caught off for pushin a bird 
Now he goin be lookin and 30 for murder 
Even though he ain't on the tape 
Soon as he got locked up I had to visit him early 
The truth was the homies and none of those niggas was worthy 
He gave me my game and told me how bitches'll burn me 
Damn, I want to kill of the district attorney 
The loser aka the prosecuter was a steady accuser 
Of my boy as bein around as the number one shooter 
They sayin that the evidence is a rueger, a steady pursuer 
What it do and make you disappear like the bermuda triangle 
Why dangle a weapon in front of the court that I know he won't use 
Now you in deep shit 
Now I just gotta go pay off my lawyer's retainer 
Homie gonna have a better defense 
And I know that you ain't really feel like talkin about it 
You want your freedom and just to put it past you 
This is the only way that we can fight'em, dawg 
So me and my lawyer goin sit down and ask you 

[Chorus]
