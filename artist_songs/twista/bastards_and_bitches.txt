[Verse 1: Twista]
Bastards and bitches
After my riches
I’m so spectacular with this knowledge
Get back to the business
I’m like Dracula with this,
My binoculars is in this
Octopus back to fictitious
But its just the act of a madness
Nigga, that’s far from scary,
And I’m like a barbarian, arian, arian
Halin’ until I start to airin’ ‘em
So don’t even start comparing them
I’mma just start to bury him
I bury him, take him take a swim in the sharks aquarium
Lyric extortionists, turn you to corpses
Every portion, thoughts of a provocative contortionist.
On my mind and my mind better
Who copy? I feel like a homonym
And to my sincerely when I start to live in this pain
I can take what I’m bombin’ them
God like I’m in dromadem
Better get Osiris or should I say assuf?
Brother of heru, I told you that I was a scholarship
Take a walk in my moccasins
you’ll do a journey of knowledge and horror
Sodom and Gomorra
Biblical processes as if I was readin’ the Torra

[Verse 2: Shawnna]
Uh, bastards and bitches
After my riches
But I count my stacks and my digits
Like it was ten mathematician.
You gonna slice your wrister thin
Tight to go listening to what I get like it’s like nitroglicerine uh
My oral skills is a horrible chlorophyll
With hallucinogenic that you can smoke down mechanic
it’s so repelled
Shawnna can do shit that be damaging
Leaving them standing stiff as a mannequin
Run a bitch up ‘cause I’m hot
They cannot be thinkin’ that I can be killed with a medicine
Redirected, I spit is like magic
‘Cause I am a sorceress
Fortune and fortunes is leaving the call full of corpses
Motherfuckers should vote for this
On the court with this
I am a beast , I hal and bang these bodies with niggas
My hobby is strangers
So don’t make me have to come up and shut you, nigger!

[Outro]
You know the hardest bitch doing this
Kids get shorter, Bonnie and Clyde on the way
