[Chorus x2]
Twista been comin with fast lyrics for year, I'm glad to see niggas catch up to speed
But when I come to doin a intricate pattern I bet you y'all can never fuck with me (no way)
Cause when it come to this music, I am a Mobsta, I am a chief
And when it come to this rap shit then I am a monster, I am a beast

[Verse 1]
Never let negative energy interfere with this
I be from the Outer Limits and I devour to men to haters that intend to annihilate what I put together they don't want to do what I got out from a military 
And they want to push and then fire my lyricist 
I would murder'em with the dialect of an apostle I'm apocalyptic and I can kick it whichever way you wanna hear it ain't no tellin who Imma kill and bury 
How can you fuck with a nigga willin to kill'em all 
With the ability to body and brigade a muthafuckas that come with the ruckus screw who any that's out of me whoever strategy you will try to initiate 
Theoretically I'm decipher that's infinite 
In other words I'm a molto I came through with polo and one day Imma go back and tell'em how them niggas that hate on me cause I kept a circle and no will not affiliate 
Ain't no impossible nigga I go the whole yard
Ain't no law with my continuum my minimum is forever and ever nigga so whatever you wanna do it don't really matter to me lets handle it right now
What happen to goin and pullin nigga hoe card 
Fuck all the thuggin on the internet cause I'm not into that I'm on a higher intellect and I don't wanna catch a murder cause I know that it's possible that you might die

[Chorus x2]
Twista been comin with fast lyrics for year, I'm glad to see niggas catch up to speed
But when I come to doin a intricate pattern I bet you y'all can never fuck with me (no way)
Cause when it come to this music, I am a Mobsta, I am a chief
And when it come to this rap shit then I am a monster, I am a beast

[Verse 2]
Now they be tellin me Twista come with the hard shit
I don't wanna disappoint'em so I gotta get it in and kill'em with every syllable after syllable like a gorilla do when I beat'em at a physical 
I be knowin the way I spit it be God's gift
Cause I'm feelin so fab, when I fuck a nigga up, and send immaculate conception of something and more than one the proportion of the distortion is biblical 
Like Isaiah Deuteronomy and Leviticus
I be a lyrical prophet I'm a disciple with a rifle when like John the Baptist, my raps is a revelation of the genesis of ya down fall
I'm a playa you should follow me cause I'm infamous
And my flow is off the chain, I be rappin about something holy then I talk about your body being cut up in pieces, out on the premises when they found y'all 
You gotta give me the status of being a legend
In my continuum what I be givin'em be killin'em in everybody feelin'em  I'm colder than December I'm a symbol and I make'em remember my emblem 
I hit you with the automatic and see you in heaven 
Committed a verbal murder we heard the surgery wasn't a success
When you was in the hospital so if I ever get charged, I hope that Imma get the moinimum

[Chorus x2]
Twista been comin with fast lyrics for year, I'm glad to see niggas catch up to speed
But when I come to doin a intricate pattern I bet you y'all can never fuck with me (no way)
Cause when it come to this music, I am a Mobsta, I am a chief
And when it come to this rap shit then I am a monster, I am a beast

[Bridge x2]
Now there'll be no killing of Twista cause I'm omnipotent 
But most of them niggas just hate on me cause I flow different 
Like the way that I spit it once I get in a niggas ass
Intricate patterns of intelligently spoken words, killin my enemy off with the dialect the Chicago and Imma blast
