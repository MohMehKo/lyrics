Twista (Twista)
Uh, Yea, F5 (Baby)
Wassup lil' mama (tasty), you know when I see you up in that SLR, and take you to the 5 star Terry
Its about too

[Chorus]
Jump Off (girl you can get it)
Jump Off (whenever your ready)
Jump Off (go ahead and let it)
Jump Off (yea girl I said it)
Jump Off (fuckin' get it)
Jump Off (I am so ready)
Jump Off (time that we let it)
Jump Off (yea boy I said it)

[Verse 1]
I gotta couple of stacks
I gotta couple of sacks
I gotta couple of blunts
I gotta cup of patron
I'm feelin the fuck in the zone, lookin for a girl that'll let me get up in their thongs (uh)
damn I don't know what's up on the beat
when I'm lookin at em' I can see that everyone of them thick
they all wanna find out who a nigga comin to get, because the hummer is slick and they want some of the dick. (uh)
do you see the twista comin' around? I'm always thumpin the ground, for a woman a bound, and I be runnin with hounds and we be huntin em' down, and when I catch em' you know that I'ma be bustin em' down. (then I)
run off (hot girls I gots to)
bump off (who aint scared to leave me)
slumped off (she make sure I get my)
nut off (and thats why I love her)

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
hustle mode I'm a cookin a brick
and a form of killer mode then im thumpin a clip
and a form of party mode I'ma stomach a fifth
and if I feel freaky mode then im fuckin a bitch (uh)
I love hoes that be ready to holla, when I pull up on em in a black chevy impala.
gotta get em if they lookin bottom heavy and Prada
and they will feel to get dollars, if they be ready to swallow (uh)
who be hittin the after party we lightin em' up
and whoever rollin with me is gon' have to get buck
I need somebody I can call in the mornin for sex, I need somebody I can call up after the club
come off (with them drawers and then I)
bust off (in them drawers and get me)
one off (straps over nothin)
jump off (when I'm rollin with mine)

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 3]
I score the pussy like a touchdown, cuz she can jump off, I'm gonna touch now
that aint a bad thing, you gotta trust me baby, yous a busty baby, you a bust down (uh)
somebody who can get up any good time off the night
actin like a fiend when she be grabbin the pipe
smokin green while you servin the white
she lookin conservative tight, but never nervous to fight (uh)
I got the head hunters thats comin to get me
suckin on the dick until it was formin a hickey
me and her be like servin the soda or
mix enough of the formula 44 with the formula 50
skunked off (I'm crunk cuz I got me)
one off (I cant hear like I cut the)
chrome off (I'm feelin like I got my)
drunk on (and thats why I love her)

[Chorus x2]
