[Verse 1]
I be the grossest, nigga spitting dirt about the hood, then that go with the flow that's ferocious
Kill 'em off with the minimal dosage, you don't wanna see the result of my ultimatum when I focus
And I got the streets on lock, Muthafuckas feast on Twist like they feast on Pac, I'm a beast and the beats don't stop
Twista and the Legendary Traxter and we so hot
Kill 'em off if we ever get into it in a minute I'mma murder em and put 'em in a body like ain't nothing they can do about it
Dump 'em in the streets you'll never know it was get money that was in the controversy cause I off whoever knew about it
Take it up another level when im off of tropical, the reason I went overdosing off my mentality
Phys-i-cally I be from the inner city yeah the Windy City but I'm spiritually from another galaxy
And I be... one of them... niggas that... never do... give a fuck... what you say as long as Ima get em up
Witness that I fly, look at the way I kick back, niggas in the Chi guest you can say I spit that
Devin Hester, D. Rose, never see me at a show with cheap clothes, take over the game no cheat code
I'ma ball like Shaq no free throws, I'm on...
When it be coming to this rap shit I'm top shotta
Midwest godfather, hotter than the city like Bambaataa
And I'ma damn problem, a speedknot mobsta
Blowing on the top ganja
Everything I wear cost top dollar

[Hook]
If your on what im on come fuck with me
If your about getting money come fuck with me
If you blowing on loud come fuck with me
If you need a new style come fuck with me

[Verse 2]
I am the Higgs' boson
Blast and the raft lance vic with voltons
Come on write that over more gigs and role bombs
Make you have to hold your kids in your arms
Got you the remedy we stand the test of time like ima the statue of liberty
And ima bringing the wrath of my enemy and I am immortal when im in a portal
Full of math than chemistry
Telling you that ima get em when I see you coming with the rhetoric
That let me know that you want to get annihilated
I am at the pinnacle when on the beat I leave a enemy at the back of me and anybody violated
Put em at the bottom of the barrel ima animal I kill em with the ammunition
There ain't gonna be no murdering me
Coming to the surfaces of the earth ain't no purposes in rukus, worth of a person holding hundred million money for me
Protons, neutrons, electrons
Building blocks to a decepticon
You just met with tron
Don't upset lebron
Kobe Wan Kenobi
Left hand ima black ginobili
Shoot em no more monetarily death and holy matrimony
Shit on muthafuckas if I ever catch em acting phony
When it be coming to this rap shit im top shotta
Mid-west god father, hotter in the city like bambaataa
And ima damn problem, a speedknot mobstaz
Blowing on the top ganja
Everything I wear cost top Doller

[Hook]
If your on what im on come fuck with me
If your about getting money come fuck with me
If you blowing on loud come fuck with me
If you need a new style come fuck with me
