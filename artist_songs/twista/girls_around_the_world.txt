See this is for them girls around the world

Tell the DJ bring it back
And he could play it from the top.

She say she want some Marvin Gaye
Salute it and balls
Little bit of easy make some jizzy
Old school now niggas throwin that...
Now I'm trying to see your hands up
Screaming this so song and tell your girlfriend fuck the niggas
'Cause I singin with Patrone
Premis burn I little miss fancy now
Gimmy chew and Gucci dime she all about the money
Tell them hoes the holla back now
All the single ladies raise your glasses if you feelin
I can say we can turn this party to the party
If the feelings right
We go shawty this so song, your shawty is so song
Now tryin to be alone girl I'm tryin to take you home
Your shawty is so strong, your shawty is so song
So will forget this night baby but don't leave me alone

Give me juice and gin and don't really matter 'cause I go in
Hurry up and get your friends
Sort of fuck like I got twins
