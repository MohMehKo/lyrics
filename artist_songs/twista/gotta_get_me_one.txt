[Static - Chorus]
Yeah, gatta get me one, gatta get me one yeah, so I can creep up on her,
So I can ease up on her, so I can get touch and feelin',
Put a dip in ya back and get me one slow jam. 
Yeah, gatta get me one, gatta get me one yeah so I can creep up on her, 
Everybodys tryna get wit somethin, can I get one slow jam. 

[Twista - Verse 1]
When it come to ballin' I do it wit no hands,
Left the Lambrogini at home and took the Broham (damn) I think the club finna close man,
But I be the Twista you know how I be doin' it wit the slow jamz,
Take a look at the shawty chillin' by the dow man,
I'm really into her perssona cause she don't be takin' drama
But she thick when I ask her where she get then she say she get it from her momma,
So I think I'ma,pop champain cause the glass tall,
The bar tender said it was the last call,
I told her give it to me fast so we can slow dance and I can put my hands on her ass,
(yes) and she like it when I,hold and grip control them hips,
And you know I like it when she get low and dip,
Plenty swagga when she move slow and sip,
When they cut the lights on you gon roll wit the Twist,
Lookin' so lovely in the fit you gat on,
But it don't matta if you was in a dress or you in some jeans,
Fragrence by addidas, purse from anotha country, look at you girl you doin' yo thing,
Everybody leavin' wit somebody and I gatta get me somebody so I be doin' what I do,
Gatta get me one too, before the night go I tell the mistro thats yo que. 

[Static - Chorus]

On my way to the floor,
Baby hold on to my shoulders,
Girl I wont let you fall,
Just hold on to my shoulders. 

[Twista - Verse 2]
She was lookin' nice, to hot for the carveya she a melt the ice,
Lil mamma kinda like Rihanna she was livin' the life,
She be given advice, but just to have an orgasm she gatta get a device,
Whats that for, is ya man a boy, cause he don't know how to give you what you here for,
I think I gatta show you what the pilot get for, and the question is what I whisper in ya ear for,
You nasty, love be on top, mad if I pop, if you miss the drop,
You nasty, how you made me choke you, told me I can put it anywhere I want to,
Sex so good she do it wit no hands, I met you while the dj was playin' the slow jam,
As soon as we got into it into my slow dance its the beginnin' is when I was feelin' the romance,
Now I be Twista wit the super tight flow one might go thats so cute,
I gatta get me one befo the night go I tell the mistro thats yo que.

What happened to the slow jamz in the club,
The dj don't play them anymore,
I used to meet the ladies on the floor and we wait for the dj to play one.
