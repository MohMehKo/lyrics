[Hook - Twista:]
I’m a beast, boy, with an intergalactic flow
Trouble intermittence from another planet
But I spit that fly shit, though
That shit go, damn, that shit blow
Put me in a laboratory, I’mma cook, that’s how shit go

[Verse 1:]
Fendi, Prada, Enny, inter-quantum physics
Alien that never heard about the bitches on the earth
So I think I’mma visit
Niggas coming at me acting like they hard
Yelling fuck me, fuck you, too
Don’t get it twisted when I spin it scientific
‘Cause the niggas that with us do shoot
New coupe, think you’re messing with a dupe, fool, fool
Dark matter aka melanin
Outer space black power, Zulu!
Yelling out like Louie, yelling out moo-boo
Yelling out like Wayne, yelling out soo-woo
‘Cause I’mma wreck them, ‘cause I’m coming for a whole other spectrum
Tryna throw me in the flames…kick me out the game but I ain’t gonna let ‘em
It’s a fascination with the science, my creation, I am God, look at how they way shit go
Take it to a whole other motherfucking level when I say I made that ho

I’m a beast, boy, with an intergalactic flow
Trouble intermittence from another planet
But I spit that fly shit, though
That shit go, damn, that shit blow
Put me in a laboratory, I’mma cook, that’s how shit go
I’m a beast, boy, with an intergalactic flow
Trouble intermittence from another planet
But I spit that fly shit, though
That shit go, damn, that shit blow
Put me in a laboratory, I’mma cook, that’s how shit go

[Verse 2:]
In the beginning there was Adam, ATOM
I am the Higgs Boson, meaner I was way before him
I kick logic, science, astrological when I be spitting you a verse
Feel like you probably fucking with me, you the first
But in a parallel universe, all up in my face
You think you something out of this almost empty space
So nigga, you ain’t nothing
Telling everybody that’s it’s on, we can spray
I know that ain’t you, the cells in your body got their own DNA
I know that ain’t you,
Coming with some shit you’ve never heard before
Like genes, chromosomes

I’m a beast, boy, with an intergalactic flow
Trouble intermittence from another planet
But I spit that fly shit, though
That shit go, damn, that shit blow
Put me in a laboratory, I’mma cook, that’s how shit go
I’m a beast, boy, with an intergalactic flow
Trouble intermittence from another planet
But I spit that fly shit, though
That shit go, damn, that shit blow
Put me in a laboratory, I’mma cook, that’s how shit go

Niggas coming at me
That’s how shit go
Niggas coming at me
That’s how shit go
