Fuck that army rollsty
I know y’all enjoying this mixtape as of yet
I go by the number one co-signer Don Cannon
Back to back with the homie Twista and 42 keys
And we reloaded motherfuckers
I know the hand this was like damn
When do these niggas sleep?
I told a bitch nigga like this
You only sleep when you start to play your music

Never talk or bother me, about I give you the vision of a movie through the eyes of a twist
Put in jail for nothing doing to me and my people better pushing on none my books
Spitting for smoke that says enough about dro
Spitting for pimps that says enough about hoes
Speaking for niggas that get money and do brothers in the streets
Okay, I know about those
If you know somebody that gotta get down
Come up halla if you know they really wanna get a pack
If it go through never do a lil some for you for being up in this back
Go ahead and halla cuz them cheap, I know them niggas
But it ain’t got shit to do with me
I just know them niggas
Live a good life, look jack city bitch
Drivin’ cars that bigga shit, rack city bitch
Put a lock in that creep all time
Some machine gun run forward and come back then
When a nigga see another they don’t fit to get medium attention from all the bulletinin’
Let me slow down before somebody got to dot, try to pull it with ‘em
Shot town don’t like nobody
Twista fuck that nigga
But if somebody touchin’ this song
He shot town, we love that nigga
I let the shorty jerk if I don’t spray your head nigga
Bath & bodyworks, no lingerie – you’re dead nigga

I mean, what am I supposed to tell you niggas?
It’s the bank of America
Wells Fargo, 24h fitness in every hood
Go get to weighin’ up nigga
You know you at MacDonald’s with these eatin’ motherfuckers
That take a hustle to take a Mr. chow body
This game ready for due
