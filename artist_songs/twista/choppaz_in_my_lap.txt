Cause popping them thangs is in my culture

Never suffer I’m on my grind
I gotta be safe, pistol in the waist
So I got that strap across my thighs
I’ma jump back when I get that info
Up that thang out the window
Hit up anybody that be standing in the area
Then peel off, 10 4
Chi town like that, socks is on my hat

So every motherfucker that be stunting on the block

Black skully, black mask,
Fuck that black I need all white when I blast
See my face, I hit all face when I blast
Hopped out the scooter in the Bentley
Do the whole dash
You murder mine, I murder yours
I’m from Illinois, you can kill that noise
I got plenty toys, choppas the whole 9
Take me out, I got goons that will handle mine
Black and gold, you bury me
Drop the top through the ab, when you carry me
Let my jiggle scream, fuck them what they getting be
Catch my killer, shake his hand then go and kill him kid

Banana clip, gorillas
How many trimmers and more spitters
How many dreamers and more killers
Surrounded by kingpin drug dealers
Choppas on my lap right, I’ma up that bitch like every night
Motherfuckers steady sitting like fucking kites
Like niggas gonna let that die down
Got a flight now, you in Chi Town
Spit around, take the round
This is where you bow down
Let me get into my motherfucking zone now
Put about 6 more, let me fix those
Nigga with the barrel
Spit the whole clip like an arrow
Knock out his bone marrow
Bitch I own … 35’s and 9’s nigga
Your bitch screaming, bodies leaning
Niggas die, nigga
And we swanging everyday on the grind nigg
And when you cross the line
Niggas die, nigga
