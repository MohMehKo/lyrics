Ash to ash, dust to dust
we live and die.
But in the Son, in the Son
we are alive.
All for one, all for one
from every tongue and tribe
in Jesus crucified
'cause Jesus is alive
now, once and for all time.

We are one
we are all for one.
all for Jesus
Jesus, once for all.
To the glory of the one true God

King of kings, Lord of lords
Till kingdom come.
And in the end, in the end
God all in all.
He will be everything,
everything to everyone,
when death is finally done
and victory is won,
once and for all of us.

We are one
We are all for one.
all for Jesus.
Jesus, once for all.
To the glory of the one true God

We won't be moved, we're standing tall.
Once of the dust, now of the Son.
All life and death and what's to come
belong to Christ, and Christ to God.
So here we stand, hands lifted high.
The very hands and feet of Christ.
No holding back, no wasting time.
We live for love

For we are one.
we are all for one.
All for Jesus.
Jesus, once for all.
To the glory of the one true God.
We are one.
We are all for one.
All for Jesus.
Jesus once for all.
To the glory of the one true God.
