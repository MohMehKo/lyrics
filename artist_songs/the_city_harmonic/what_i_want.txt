May my life speak louder than words
And what I’m saying
Is “Jesus, I’m sure You’re what I want”
Yeah, that’s what I want

These words ain’t cheap, no, they bleed on the page.
I see what I’ve been and that needs to change
And that’s what I want
Yeah, You’re what I want

Ha–la–la–lelujah, yeah
Hallelu
Ha–la–la–lelujah, oh yeah
What I want is You

I want to sing, sing and mean every word
Cause what I’m singing is “Joy to the world”
And that’s what I want, yeah,
That’s what I want

So go on sing, sing, all of heaven and earth
But don’t just sing, be and be every word
That’s what I want, yeah,
That’s what I want

Ha–la–la–lelujah, yeah
Hallelu
Ha–la–la–lelujah, oh yeah
What I want is You

(Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah)

Ha–la–la–lelujah,
Hallelu
Ha–la–la–lelujah, yeah
What I want is You.

You're everything I want
You're everything I need
You're everything I want
You're everything I need
You're everything I want
