Could a spark of Your love light a fire in me
Just a spark warm my cold heart
It's the living that breathe
When I breathe in
Hope I breathe in
Create some meaning again
And I breathe in, peace will be there
Just a stream of love
Ohhh

This little light's gonna shine
With just a spark to light a fire
Just a spark

Could a spark of Your love light the whole church on fire
When we care for our neighbor
More than we care for style
When we breathe in
Hope we breathe in
Create some meaning God
When we breathe out
Peace will breathe out
Just to breathe out love

This little light's gonna shine
With just a spark light a fire
Just a spark

Just a spark could change the heart
Just a spark come change my heart
Just a spark is just a start
Light a fire in my heart

Light a fire in my heart
Light a fire in my heart
Light a fire in my heart
A fire in my heart
With just a spark
