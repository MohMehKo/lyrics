I have a dream
That you can have with me
Of a city that shines so bright at night

Where love is true
But this love He finds you
And there is a fire in His eyes
Where I can see everything's alright

It feels like home
Sweet home
There's no, no, no, no, no, no, no place like home

When I awake
That day of glory
Your love will light the sin-deep streams

O we will meet
Our souls are longing
We'll be a symphony of peace
Brothers and sisters will be free
Thank God Almighty they'll be free

It feels like home
Sweet home
There's no, no, no, no, no, no, no place like home

It feels like home
Sweet home
There's no, no, no, no, no, no, no place like home
Yeah!

Ooooohhh
I hear the bells are ringing
Ooooohhh
I see the city lights
Ooooohhh
The dream was real until you close your eyes

It feels like home
Ooooohhh

It feels like home
Home
Home

It feels like home
Home
Home

It feels like home
