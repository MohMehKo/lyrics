I have breathed in deep
the sweetest scent of spring,
I've been silenced by the stars
I've been lost in melody that
Made me weep and said,
"Oh, how great Thou art"

You are more
You are more
You are all of this and more
More than a fleeting touch
More than just flesh and blood
More than a mystery
You're all of this and more
More than a promise kept
More than my life and death
More than a miracle
You're all of this and more
All of this and more

You have whispered silently
of all You've done for me
It took my breath away
You have opened wide
the arms of love Divine and shown
such amazing grace

You are more
You are more
You are who all this is for
You are more
You are more
You are all of this and more
More than a fleeting touch
More than just flesh and blood
More than a mystery
You're all of this and more
More than a promise kept
More than my life and death
More than a miracle
You're all of this and more

It's never enough to say I need You
More than anything else
â€˜cause I need You like a fire
needs the air to feel alive
More than a fleeting touch
More than just flesh and blood
More than a mystery
You're all of this and more
More than a promise kept
More than my life and death
More than a miracle
You're all of this and more
All of this and more
