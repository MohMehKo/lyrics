I give my heart up in my empty hands
And as I look it's like
I see the sum of who I am
All my hopes, all my dreams, all my thoughts
And the things I love
All my sin, all my fear
All my sorry's for the things I've done

You can have it all it's Yours
All of it Yours
All of it Yours
All of it Yours
Yours, all of it Yours
All of it Yours
All of it Yours

I give my days up like grains of sand
And as I look it's like
I see the sum of who I've been
Every hour that I stole
Every hour I lived life the same
Every day, every dollar
Washed away into a sea of grace

You can have it all it's Yours
All of it Yours
All of it Yours
All of it Yours
Yours, all of it Yours
All of it Yours
All of it Yours

Ooooo

I'm Yours, I'm Yours, I'm Yours, I'm Yours
I'm Yours, I'm Yours, I'm Yours, I'm Yours

Ooooo
