I lift my eyes up,
In these days of trouble.
Will my help come from You?
And if I stumble,
Will You pick me up?
What else could a father do?

You know just where I’m going.
You made the open road.
So take my hand, Lord, and lead me home.

Ooo, my God.
Ooo, my God.

I lift my heart up,
Whether it’s whole or broken,
Good God I know You’re gonna work it out.
So on my heart beats
To a beat that I put my hope in
The love of my God pouring out.

Yeah
Ooo, my God.
Ooo, my God.
I will sing, sing, sing and You will be my song.
Yeah

(Ooo, my God)

I’m gonna sing it like it’s everything to me,
I’m gonna sing it like the deep calling out to deep
I’m gonna sing it like it’s all I’ve got
Cause all that I want is to sing for the love of God.

I'm gonna sing it like it's everything to me,
I'm gonna sing it like the deep calling out to deep.
I'm gonna sing it like it's all I've got
Cause all that I want is to sing, sing, sing.
