I’ve been waiting for you, just waiting for you
When you gonna turn?

I’ve been tracing your spine, mixing your blood with mine
When you gonna turn?

When you gonna turn around and tell me how
all I want won’t be
Coming down to where I’m found, your silent vows
steal the life from me

I’ve sentenced myself to the outskirts
I’ve wandered the places we’d go
I drank down the streets with a taste of defeat
‘til the sky turned to coral and gold

You’re further than the ocean goes, my love
You’re further than the ocean goes,
and my love’s not enough
to reach you
