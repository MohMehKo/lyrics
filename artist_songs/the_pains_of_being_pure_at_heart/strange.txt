When everyone was doing drugs,
we were just doing love
A stranger said you’re strange like me

Ana, our dreams are coming true

Don’t tell me that a day will come
when we dress like everyone
cuz I can tell you’re strange like me

Don’t say the hour’s growing late
Don’t say we should be going straight
cuz I can tell you’re strange like me

And dreams can still come true,
and it’s coming true for you
