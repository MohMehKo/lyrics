Serpent friend of mine, your venom sweet as wine,
still I don’t believe you

Possess my hopes and then, don’t know what came of them,
still I just don’t leave you

Perhaps the fault is mine, and this the final time
you set yourself upon me

The fall will not be far, can still see what we were
and won’t be anymore

When the venom comes I’ll close my eyes,
as my body numbs and life unties,
I will feel your pull one last time,
then will I escape you?
