Twist your body like your mind,
a constant aversion to forgo perversion
No one notices when you’re shut up
or beat up covertly in places I can’t see

Eternally, internally you are free,
though they try to chain you,
you don’t mind

Eternally, internally you are free,
even if they shame you,
would you mind, when you’re mine

Sweet masokissed in the morning mist
Why would you ever leave this place,
When all I need is your chip-toothed smile to know that
life’s more than ok?

Sweet masokssed if it came to it,
would you go all the way?
‘Cuz that’s what Jesus did, but I don’t care for him
and I want you here to stay

Don’t set me free
