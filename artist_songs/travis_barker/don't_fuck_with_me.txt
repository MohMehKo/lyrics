[Jay Rock]
Shit shit
I'm just a skinny ass nigga
With word on my shoulders
Hard night as a motherfucker
My daddy was a solider
I'm holy never
Straight forward
Leap with it
Split
Haters all in my vision
I'm trying to start my living
Shots what I'm given
I don't miss when I kill em

Lord wont show me some mercy
Its just business
Gotta get it
In my city better watch it
Devil
Always busy
Stetchin' my mind shit
Smoking toll I'm busy
When I'm speaking my mind
Trying to stay out of prison
Every time that I'm spitting
Caps that I'm pillagin'
Shit I'm 
Natural born killer

[Chorus]
Trying to get mine when you see me at the crime
Don't fuck with me
If you see me getting high
Trying to keep my piece of mind
Don't fuck with me
You don't like what I'm saying
You don't like my appearance
Don't fuck with me
The doctor told my mama that I'm 50-150
Don't fuck with me

[Paul Wall]
Ain no motherfucker gonna hold my grind
Put the line
Ain't got time
I gotta keep it
While I'm still in my prime
My future looking clearer
Darth vader
Escaping like ya mean
No feel
No deal
Post it up on the top tier
Too many powder breaks
Shaking in the case dear
Skid row
Right back at the spot
Till they drop me in the grave 
I can't stop
One way or another
I will be on top
In jail 
Knock on wood 
I gotta get it outta here
Don't fuck with me

[Chorus]
Trying to get mine when you see me at the crime
Don't fuck with me
If you see me getting high
Trying to keep my piece of mind
Don't fuck with me
You don't like what I'm saying
You don't like my appearance
Don't fuck with me
The doctor told my mama that I'm 50-150
Don't fuck with me

[Kurupt]
I'm a hellhound
For youth
Blue chukka motherfukcer
Steve soul
Healer monster
Keeler monster
Jay humphries
Godzilla
Killa
Nigga
Backup swilla
Multiple villains
Eclipse the gorillas
I'm ape shit for
Cooked like bacon eggs and grits
On some G-shit
Take some cheddar
Bricks
Get you clips
Get the fuck off the
Molatov
Kurrupt I'm sick
And quickly so nigga 
Don't fuck with me

[Chorus]
Trying to get mine when you see me at the crime
Don't fuck with me
If you see me getting high
Trying to keep my piece of mind
Don't fuck with me
You don't like what I'm saying
You don't like my appearance
Don't fuck with me
The doctor told my mama that I'm 50-150
Don't fuck with me
Don't fuck with me
Don't fuck with me
Don't fuck with me
Don't fuck with me
