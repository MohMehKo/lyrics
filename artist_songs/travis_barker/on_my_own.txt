Yeah

Well, I've been down for a very long time
I've given up, I'm a never rewind
I need a minute, I know it's complicated
But it's always gotta happen to me

I don't win, I don't care
It doesn't mean that I'll get my share
Let it go, now let it out
And let me tell you what I'm talking about

Oh, that's alright, I'm on the ropes but I'm ready to fight
You stick around 'cause I can't be left alone
Oh, that's okay, I wouldn't have it any other way
Well, I took a chance and I made it on my own

I don't wanna play and I don't wanna burn
I'm fucked up and I never learn
Wait a minute, I know I'm gonna hate it
So I'm gonna get it over with 

Well, I don't start, I don't care
It's settled up until it doesn't seem fair
I wanna go, I want out
'Cause I don't know what I'm talkin' about

Oh, that's alright, I'm on the ropes but I'm ready to fight
You stick around 'cause I can't be left alone
Oh, that's okay, I won't have it any other way
Well, I took a chance and I made it on my own
I made it on my own

Oh, that's alright, I'm on the ropes but I'm ready to fight
You stick around 'cause I can't be left alone
Oh, that's okay, I won't have it any other way
I took a chance and I made it on my own
Made it on my own
