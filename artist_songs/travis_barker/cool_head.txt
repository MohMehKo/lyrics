(Yeah, yeah) 
Relaxed and I'm thinking did I forget to mention 
I'm sitting on a location, I call it new station 
Destructing my best hope is 
Mother fuckers ain't got no life, no vision, no ambition 
No will to do a damn thing, they often speak greasy and talk down on a nigga make it shinin' 
how is that bubbly? 
so menstrual psychology 
Tamponing, stressful overloaded jealous niggas 
I'm in my own world, literally no bullshit baby! 

[Chorus:]
I keep a cool head, I keep a cool head now, whoa 
I keep a cool head, I keep a cool head 

Ain't nobody tripping on, I'm cool, relax 
I keep my mojo on, damn no turning me off 
I keep making that money, that money, that money, 
Yeah, keep my mojo on, damn, no turning me off 
Ain't nobody tripping on, I'm cool, relax 
I keep my mojo on damn no turning me off 
I keep making that money, that money, that money, yeah 
I keep my mojo on, damn, no turning me off. 

[Chorus:]
I keep a cool head, I keep a cool head now, whoa 
I keep a cool head, I keep a cool head now, whoa 
I keep a cool head, I keep a cool head now, whoa 
I keep a cool head, I keep a cool head now 

[2x Bridge:]
They stay living right in their own eyes, in their own lies,in their holes 
We see beyond the hate, we see a poor soul who hasn't been told they only know what they've been shown 

[2x Chorus:]
I keep a cool head, I keep a cool head now, whoa 
I keep a cool head, I keep a cool head now, whoa 
I keep a cool head, I keep a cool head now, whoa 
I keep a cool head, I keep a cool head now
