Tell the waitress go and get a tissue
Keep it 100, he don’t want no issues
Nah, 100 I'm straight blunted up, and she on it now
Tryna see the tattoos on my stomach, I
Got shots in the air, where the gun at, I, blaow

Better cuff yo' chick for the rest of her life

Send a text, bet she slide like a playground
Uh, one time for the bay now
