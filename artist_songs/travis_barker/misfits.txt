Screaming loud
I wear this mask I'm in disguise
This is how we fight
From inside we came to break into your minds to ignite

Go!

Barricade the door we're getting dumb
Not afraid be ready when they come
Hustlin everyday we've been on the run
The Show is over but we're far from done

We are the misfits alive in this sound
We are the misfits we'll take you motherfuckers down

Go! Sabotage...

WE ARE THE MISFITS
WE ARE THE MISFITS
WE ARE THE MISFITS
WE ARE THE MISFITS
WE ARE THE MISFITS
WE ARE THE MISFITS
WE ARE THE MISFITS
We'll take you motherfuckers down

FUCK THE ORDER, WE CHOOSE DISORDER!

FUCK THE ORDER, WE CHOOSE DISORDER!
FUCK THE ORDER, WE CHOOSE DISORDER!
FUCK THE ORDER, WE CHOOSE DISORDER!
FUCK THE ORDER, WE CHOOSE DISORDER!

Rise to the sky or die.
