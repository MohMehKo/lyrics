In the city lights, the night will give me life
I hear the drums, Ima war chief gimme knife
Got kush fuck the knife just give me light 
Spark it up in my grow room, pretty sight
Got a house on the hill with the pretty type
You ain't got a kush man, what a shitty life
I don't wanna hit a bowl on ya mini pipe
Tryin to hit my 8 footer, reach Diddy heights
Now I'm swinging on the drums like Tarzan
[?]
Sixteen of em, I been needin em
On stage screamin em [?]
They call me the Greenthumb, the serene one
I laid back from the drum like a beach bum
Shit is hot as summer, another classic number
Everybody give it up for the cocky drummer.

[Chorus:]
And the beat goes on (and the beat goes on)
And the beat goes on (on and on and on)
And the beat goes on (and the beat goes)
(And the beat goes on)

Here come the west coasters, wylin out loco
My eyeballs bleed from the weed I been smokin
Keep walking son, I keep the song hostile
Mad weaponry, I bring by the stockpile
Way too deep, my block legendary
Many MC's tried to creep and got burried
He aint come to Cypress, back with the tightest
Man behind the king, we know you gon' like this
Roll with the top dog, do it like a rockstar
Stuffin em up, a double dose of hot sauce
You got your ears on, and your listenin
To bad motherfuckas in this here business
Handle shit right, get your stack on
Anybody hating, it's the fool that you smash on
Gonna say last time and I'm gonna jump
[?] give a drummer some

[Chorus]
And the beat goes on (and the beat goes on)
And the beat goes on (on and on and on)
And the beat goes on (and the beat goes on)
And the beat goes on (on and on and on)
And the beat goes on (and the beat goes on)
And the beat goes on (on and on and on)
And the beat goes on (and the beat goes on)
And the beat goes on and on and on

Shit is critical, we are the invincible
Riot starter, start riots on principle
At the pinnacle, the game is winnable
Put the record on the table, guaranteed spinnable
Follow the leader, the level is going off the meter
The funk freaker, with the big drum beater
What you scared for, better prepare yourself
[this verse is not complete - please send the rest to AZLyrics team!]

[Chorus]
And the beat goes on (and the beat goes on)
And the beat goes on (on and on and on)
And the beat goes on (and the beat goes on)
And the beat goes on (on and on and on)
And the beat goes on (and the beat goes on)
And the beat goes on (on and on and on)
And the beat goes on (and the beat goes on)
And the beat goes on and on and on

Ans the beat goes on [till end]
