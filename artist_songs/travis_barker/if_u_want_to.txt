Your mind's all a flutter no pigs on the gig, no swine for the supper
no wine in the cupboard, everything of mine must show signs of the suffer
And keep you oppressed to the other, struggle
To keep it all fresh like tupper
One of the tougher ginger bread men out the cutter,
Skin ain't Huck Finn but I ain't Nigger Jim mother fucker
I'm more like clubber from the upper cut of the gutter
Never can't tell I won't bow down to the bull like Calcutta
That ain't what I'm rapping for, I'd rather be a matador
So tar, tar, rev and roar
I know that sounds fucked up like a rap tour?
But there's no roof clips if I lose so I choose
To keep on seeing red like crips in
Ha!
He the guy who rise to eye pools
..
Hey I must admit it, I ain't sayin I'm the best OH!
..
Niggas just jealous, cuz what I got restin on my neck OH!
Cuz it took me from down on the ground to soarin' like a G4!
Mug if you want to, bug if you want to, chill if you want to
Strug if you want to, build if you want to, joke if you want to
Disrespect me, that's what you wan' do

Been around the world the things that I've seen
these things get turned into things that I sing
things stringed together with similes in between
then ming with the thing
since little green marines I
been, mean, jing ming, ring, ling, string, bean, dream, team, bling, bling, 3, rings, ring, ling ..

So move towards it, I had to root for it like my home team, now they all lean,
Singin' that Queen, Somebody to Love, Rhapsody Boheem, we are Champeens,
Ya'll that worried bout the dust better stay on your scene?
I drop the lyric with..
You can document it, Colombine bowling
I got the spirit I fly over Wayne
It's the fly MC..

I must admit it, I ain't sayin I'm the best OH!
..
Niggas just jealous, cuz what I got restin on my neck OH!
Cuz it took me from down on the ground to soarin' like a G4!
Mug if you want to, bug if you want to, chill if you want to
Strug if you want to, build if you want to, joke if you want to
Disrespect me, that's what you wan' do

I'm preforming mama, now everybody know me mama,
All these hoes on me mama, why the hell you ain't want me mama, hey
I'm preforming mama, now everybody know me mama,
All these hoes on me mama, why the hell you ain't want me mama

Success is my friend, who knew that when I grew up I'd be just like him
Expect my roar if you reject my whim, erect my law, respect my pimp
I bring the pain, Method Men, I bring the pain
S&M, jump the family one of my bestest friends,
Try and kill us all your deaths breaks in, I'll just reply with excess winds
Please God correct my sins to protect my kin, as they keep thinking
.. my leg..

I must admit it, I ain't sayin I'm the best OH!
..
Niggas just jealous, cuz what I got restin on my neck OH!

Mug if you want to, bug if you want to, chill if you want to

Disrespect me, that's what you wan' do
