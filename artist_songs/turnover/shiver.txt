Three days passed since I last saw you face to face,
And you’re not here anymore tonight than the one before.
I told you it would be the same.
Well, I wish that I could say that I didn’t lie.

Maybe tonight you’ll say you’re sick of this.
Maybe tonight I’ll miss you more.
But I’m tired and you’re sad and
Both of us could use a break from all of this.

Three weeks passed since I last saw your smiling face,
And I wish you were with me tonight.
I told you before I hope things will be the same,
But if I said that I was sure it’d be a lie.
Hey, how are things where you are?
I don’t miss much about being home,
But I miss the sound of your dogs barking
As I climbed up your front steps
And how I didn’t always seem to feel alone.

I can’t help but shiver, shiver, here without you.
Shiver, shiver, here without you.
Shiver, shiver, here without you.
Shiver, shiver, here without you.

Here without you.
Here without you.
