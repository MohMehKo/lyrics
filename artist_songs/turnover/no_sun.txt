Can you hear me now?
I'm crying out so loud
And this weight on my back is bound to crush me
I'm shattered glass, and you're the rock that was thrown
You're the match that lit the fire
That burned down the place that I called home
Now I'm a wanderer with no home to run to
Nothing I call mine
If you called what I'm doing "living"
I would say that that's a stretch
I'd say it's more like passing time

So can you hear me?
I'm calling your name
I wish you were here
I wish you were here
Can you hear me?
I can't yell any louder
I miss you being mine
I miss you by my side

Because you were the light
Kept away the clouds
But now there's no sun
Yeah, it rains all the time now
Yeah, you were the light
You were the one
And now there's no sun
Now there's no sun

And while I've been alone
I've had some time for introspection
Objective reason and long nights thinking
Focused on my self-reflection
Honestly, I don't think that I've ever felt this hopeless
Thought filled nights breed tired eyes
Constant reminders of all that I miss
There's no sun anymore
There's no sun anymore

Because you were the light
Kept away the clouds
But now there's no sun
Yeah, it rains all the time now
Yeah, you were the light
You were the one
And now there's no sun
Now there's no sun
