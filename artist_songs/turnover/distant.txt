Trying to call home as the miles take me further down the road
I know that it's hard but believe me when I say we'll be okay when it's all done
I know these past few weeks have been a test on us
But if you'll just wait up these lights will lead me home to you

Because it's never felt so good to know
It's all over my head
And even though I've never been this far from you before
It feels like home's right here again

These passing clouds turn grey
As you recede and hours turn to days
Friends fall far behind fading to my memory 
And make me realize 
Maybe all the clouded judgement blocked my eyes from what I need to see
These decisions are still haunting me

It's never felt so good to know
It's all over my head
And even though I've never been this far from you before
It feels like home's right here again

Decisions are still haunting me
