I speak in broken words
Uncomprehensive complex verse
Of what I've lost again more of a brother than best friend
All the memories
Of all the things held close to me
There's nothing left but ghosts and what's fucked up
They mean the most

And this is all I've got left
I'll keep it clutched into my chest
I'll be okay
To see you come
I'll die another day

Carcinogenic thoughts
And all the things
I've fled and fought
Succeed to break me down
Continue on without a sound
Holding fast and strong
I've known you'd be here all along
A lie is all this is
I'm just another fucking kid

And this is all I've got left
I'll keep it clutched into my chest
I'll be okay
To see you come
I'll die another day

And this is all I've got left
I'll keep it clutched into my chest
I'll be okay
To see you come
I'll die another
And this is all I've got left
I'll keep it clutched into my chest
I'll be okay
To see you come
I'll die another day
I'll die another day
