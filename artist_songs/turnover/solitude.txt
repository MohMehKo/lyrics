Tired of driving through the night
Stinging eyes and my knuckles clenched to white
And it's still snowing outside
It hurts to think of all I've had
And all the pain that I've caused with these hands
And how I want it back
Oh God can you tell me why
I can't shake these thoughts that haunt my mind
It's killing me inside
Surrounded by December cold
There really is no other place like home
No other place I'd go

I remember when nights just like this one tonight
I'd spend with you and I'd feel alive
I'd love to spend them by your side
Just the two of us alone in time
I still remember how you'd laugh
And how it felt when I held your hand
They're cancerous these memories
They're breaking me like a disease

Solitude, I'll be alone
Can't ever go back, won't go back home
So I'll wait here until my last breath
And breathe relief as it slowly leaves my chest
