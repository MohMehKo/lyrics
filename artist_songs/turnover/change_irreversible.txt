I don't care much for the springtime
Twenty odd plates on the same side
I don't know, I'd say the same about the fall

Oh, it's just been such a long night
I was anxious till the first light
I've been finding I spend most of them like this

Usually it's all fuzz
Keeping me awake at night
There's nothing that'll help what
Trouble I've been thinking of

Usually it's all fuzz
(Once you take the first step, it's)
Keeping me awake at night
(Irreversibly changing)
There's nothing that'll help what
(I don't think I'm being selfish)
Trouble I've been thinking of
(How would you like me to live?)

Disappointment waiting for me
Like a hunger in the morning
Draw a straight line that I can follow easily

There's a grey lens over my eyes
The perception wasn't quite right
If you're in the dark enough your eyes adjust

Usually it's all fuzz
(Once you take the first step, it's)
Keeping me awake at night
(Irreversibly changing)
There's nothing that'll help what
(I don't think I'm being selfish.)

My fingers tracing
Soft on the curtain
I'm sick and nervous
Dive in the pavement

I don't care much for the springtime

There's a grey lens over my eyes
(Soft on the curtain)
There's a hunger waiting for me
(I'm sick and nervous)
Disappointment in the morning
