Yesterday the yellow lights had all gone grey
Black and white swallowed the light of day

And as you laid and cried a million eyes 
All turned their backs to protect your lies
And God above and the ones you love
Couldn't even tell they were too caught up

You're so alone and all I can't help but see
On the back of my eyelids, the darkness surrounding me

These sleepless nights never felt so long
Your bloodshot eyes never looked so wrong
