You can find me drifting slowly sinking beneath the sea.
I try to catch my breath, a silent struggle drowned in my apathy.
Yeah I’m still caught up on all the things I know I’ll never be.
Erase me.

You won’t find me 
Because I don’t know where I am myself. You see,
I’ve been waiting for so long and hoping that I’d see 
A sign to point me in the right direction,
But where I am the signs have been torn down.
No, I won't be found.

I’m feeling fragile, cast aside these walls surrounding,
Losing touch with what's around me. I just don’t feel like myself anymore. 
I can’t even sleep. Take my dreams they’re yours to keep.
Take my head and hold me down. I’m in too deep. I can’t get out.

Running in circles and falling in holes all the way to where I’m trying to go.
Most of the time that I think there’s an end, I come to find out that it’s not even close. 

You can find me drifting slowly sinking beneath the sea.
I try to catch my breath, a silent struggle drowned in my apathy.
Yeah I’m still caught up on all the things I know I’ll never be.
Erase me.

Most of the time I’m invisible.
Most of the time I’m between the cracks.
Most of the time I’m wandering.
Most of the time I’m not coming back.

Most of the time I’m hopelessly lost.
Most of the time I’m between the cracks.
Most of the time you’ll find me drifting.
Most of the time I’m never coming back.
