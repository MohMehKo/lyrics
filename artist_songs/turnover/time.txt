It's 3AM right now in late July
The sky has never been as clear as I swear it is tonight
We'll laugh until dawn about the shit we did
And sleep the day away tomorrow
Dream of doing it again

Stars in my eyes and the wind on my face
Abandoned parking lots with my best friends
Remembering the days
We won't grow up, we'll live this life for years
And make those memories I'll remember

Every day we spent sleeping until noon 
And waking up without shit to do
I'd sit out back in the summer air
While the time wasted away
Every night that we spent driving around
No place to be, just hanging out
I wouldn't change a thing about those wasted days
Or the time I threw away

Those days are gone but memories won't fade
I still remember every second in my head like yesterday
I'll hold on tight to all that I have left
And keep it clutched in close to me

Every day we spent sleeping until noon 
And waking up without shit to do
I'd sit out back in the summer air
While the time wasted away
Every night we spent driving around
No place to be, just hanging out
I wouldn't change a thing about those wasted days
Or the time I threw away
