Without you
There's no tomorrow
Without you
Without you
There's no tomorrow

Oh, my son
Too young
To understand
That life is dark
Sometimes
There is just not enough light

And you
You broke me
Everyday
But I fought you back
I think
I could die
In the next room
Without you noticing

Without you noticing

Life is dark everyday
You die everyday

And yes
It hurts me so
To realize
That death won't do us
Won't do us part
But something
Something else might

We
We die
Alone
And we live without
And yes
It hurts me so
Without you noticing

Where do we go?
Where do we go from here?
And where do we go?
Where do we go?
Where do we go from here?
What will happen to us?

Gotta breathe in
Gotta breathe out
Up on your feet
Gotta think twice
The future is dark
The future is vile
Without you
There's no tomorrow

Without you
There's no tomorrow

Gotta breathe in
Gotta breathe out
Up on your feet
Gotta think twice
The future is dark
The future is vile
Without you
There's no tomorrow

(Gotta breathe in)
(Gotta breathe out)
(Oh)
Without you
There's no tomorrow

Gotta breathe in
Gotta breathe out
Up on your feet
Gotta think twice
The future is dark
The future is vile
Without you
There's no tomorrow

(Gotta breathe in)
Where do we go?
Where do we go from here?
(Gotta breathe out)
And where do we go?
(Oh)
Where do we go?
Where do we go from here?
What will happen to us?

(Gotta breathe in)
(Gotta breathe out)
(Oh)
Without you
There's no tomorrow
