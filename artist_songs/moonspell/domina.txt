You're thinking down for Judgement Day
What took to the skies, what took you away?
Tears run fast, and so did blood
But nothing can break through your eyes, break through your eyes

We're always close, but are we ever there?
What came from the skies to take you away
Our children grew, left us behind
But no-one should pay such a price

Just another day and it's all the same
In this world of the next
You bring me down and I resurrect
In this world of the next

Watch the storm, its eye above
Watch our world die...
