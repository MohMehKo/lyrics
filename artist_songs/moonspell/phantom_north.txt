Phantom north, for all is lost
Body changing seeds of yet a new lord
Dreaming... becoming...

The freezing scene, those seas of green
Our souls together in truly everything
Moon to a massacre in blood riddled lies
Dreamed of destruction again tonight

Shadows standing still
Shadows moving fast

What came between us? We will never know
Phantom north I wish you away!

The shattered screams from when lives end
Our souls becoming one, inspired again
Moon to a pinpoint in the trouble of skies
Everything you wished for called upon tonight

Shadows standing still
Shadows moving fast

What came between us? We will never know
Phantom north (wind) I wish you away!

Phantom north, for all is lost
Body changing seeds shaming a new host
Moon to a sound in your tidal sighs
I am destruction again tonight

Shadows standing still
Shadows moving fast

What came between us? We will never know
Phantom north (wind) I wish you away!
Phantom north (wind) I command you away!
