Somos memórias de lobos que rasgam a pele
Lobos que foram homens
e o tornarão a ser

[English translation:]
We are wolf memories
that tear the skin apart
Wolves that once were men
and shall be them again

They awake for flesh
Choose pain as a path
Refuse a light
To blind you and me

Full Moon Madness,
We are as one and congregate
Full Moon Madness
We rise again to procreate

Somos memórias de lobos que rasgam a pele
Lobos que foram homens e o tornarão a ser
ou talvez memórias de homens.
que insistem em não rasgar a pele
Homens que procuram ser lobos
mas que jamais o tornarão a ser...

[English translation:]
We are wolf memories
that tear the skin apart
Wolves that once were men
and shall be them again
or perhaps memories of men
who insist of not tearing for to be wolves
but that never shall be them again...

They awake for flesh
Choose pain as a path
Refuse a light
To blind you and me

Full Moon Madness,
We are as one and congregate
Full Moon Madness
We rise again to procreate to seal our fate

Irreverence was cast out from the sky
And eternity lost its sex forever
And under the same heaven they voted to emptiness
They still celebrate under a Full Moon Madness...

They awake for flesh
Choose pain as a path
Refuse a light to blind you and me

Irreverence was cast out from the sky
And eternity lost its sex forever
And under the same heaven they voted to emptiness
We still celebrate under a Full Moon Madness...
