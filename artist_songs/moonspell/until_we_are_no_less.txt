You reached the top of the chain
Inhale
Exhale
You made it till the end of days

Every man is a sinner
Every man is a liar
Life's a slow procession
Into the fire

Carry the weight
Or crush under it
Carry the weight
Or crush

Every man is a sinner
In the name of the father
History's repeating
Into the fire

Carry the weight
Or crush under it
Carry the weight
Or crush

We started wanting
To be ourselves
Until we are no more

Carry the weight
Or crush under it
Carry the weight
Or crush

Every man is a leader
Every man is a martyr
Every man is in trouble
Caught in your fire

Carry the weight
Or crush under it
Carry the weight
Or crush

We started wanting
To be ourselves
To live our lives

We went too far perhaps
Beyond control
Until we are no more
