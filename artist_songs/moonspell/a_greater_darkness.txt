A greater darkness for all it's worth
A friend so young who's life was cut
We drink the rain to clear our throats
We drink the poison to make it go

The little mercies above all things
No final act. no final scene
A friend for life and in death too
Forever strong, forever hold, inside our soul

So raise your hands above the waters
We are the thieves in giant shoulders
Se raise your hands, our hearts sink lower
To watch you drown inside the monster

The day now ends and all within
A greater darkness covers everything
Is there no end for such a pain
Is there no hope, no other life no way to know?

So raise your hands above the waters
We are the thieves in giant shoulders
Se raise your hands, our hearts sink lower
To watch you drown inside the monster

So raise your hands inside the monster
