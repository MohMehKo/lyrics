In your thoughts

“Behold the bridegroom cometh
In the middle of the night”
Behold the rats who follow him
Why do they want our destruction?

Do broken men still sail in your blade
Are your bravest still afraid
Now it’s the womb that chases the seed
Now it’s the time of the need
Of hunger and revolt
Inverting our thoughts

Forever hold
Forever sworn
Forever mine

It’s the time to know, it’s the time to see!
Love is blasphemy

In your thoughts

Behold the gloom bride coming
Riding the tail of the star
Beware the scum who follows her
Now it’s the time of the kill.
