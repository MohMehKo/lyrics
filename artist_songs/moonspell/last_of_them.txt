(Black, black, black)
(Black, black, black)
(Black, black, black, black, black, black, black)

Let me guide you to where it's silent
Across the limit of survivors' guilt
The crowds are waiting, their sight was taken
By the burning sun
We're moving on a straight line
Into depths unknown

My curse is to love you (to love you)
Until we see the last of us
My terms of surrender (surrender)
Nothing but eternity

My curse is to love you (to love you)
Until we see the last of us
No chance of surrender (surrender)
Before we fight our destiny

Black magic, unconditional love
Black magic unconditional
Black magic, unconditional lust
Black magic irresistible

Let me touch you where it's forbidden
And test the limit of your sanctity
The crowd suspended, they have stripped naked
For the lust of God
The fire burns as if there's no tomorrow
No tomorrow

You know my heart will fail
You know my back will break
And again and again
It won't hurt just for you
To reveal my pain

My curse is to love you (love you)
Until we see the last of us
No chance of surrender (surrender)
Before we fight our destiny

(Black, black, black)
(Black, black, black)
(Black, black, black, black, black, black, black)

You know my heart will fail
You know my back will break
Again and
You know my heart will fail
You know

My curse is to love you (to love you)
Until we see the last of us
My terms of surrender (surrender)
Nothing but eternity

My curse is to love you (to love you)
Until we see the last of us
No chance of surrender (surrender)
Before we fight our destiny

Black magic, unconditional love
Black magic unconditional
Black magic, unconditional lust
Black magic irresistible

Black magic, unconditional love
Black magic unconditional
Black magic, unconditional lust
Black magic irresistible
