You don't believe that I love you
And even if that was true
Why just to keep our unhappy home
I'm gonna try to pretend that I do
But I'm breakin' down
I'm breakin' down
I'm breakin' down
I'm breakin' down
My baby she left me 
said she ain't comin' back around
and I'm breakin' down
I'm breakin' down

And if I thought that it was okay
For a grown man to cry
I would have filled up the whole mighty ocean
When she said goodbye
and I'm breakin' down
I'm breakin' down
I'm breakin' down
I'm breakin' down
You know my baby she left me 
said she ain't comin' back around 
and I'm breakin' down
I'm breakin' down

One day you said everything was just right
I don't see how it changed overnight
One day you said everything was so strong
The next day you turn to me and say 
It' s been wrong all along

Oh and now you won't even look at me
You pass me by in the street and you won't even speak 
I never meant to cause you any harm
How could two people start so close
And end up so far
I'm breakin' down
I'm breakin' down
I'm breakin' down
I'm breakin' down
