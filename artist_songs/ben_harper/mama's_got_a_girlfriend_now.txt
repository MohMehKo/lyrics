Papa he left home today
Said he ain't comin' back again
Said he ain't gonna be nobody's second best
Just cause mama's got a special kind of friend

Papa he left home today
Said he ain't comin' back no more
Said he ain't gonna take no damn back seat
And how could mama do him so low

But mama's got a girlfriend now boy
Mama's got a girlfriend now
Mama's got a girlfriend
Mama's got a true friend
Mama's got a girlfriend now

You see mama don't watch your damn football
And your beer drinkin' just won't do
You're just stayin' out late
And you're preachin' the hate
And you never have been true

You see mama she want her somebody
Who will let her be herself
So she's leavin' you 
And your stinky damn ways
Cause she's found somebody else

And mama's got a girlfriend now boy
Mama's got a girlfriend now
Mama's got a girlfriend
Mama's found a true friend
Mama's got a girlfriend now

Papa he left home today
He was wavin' his hands and cryin'
You could tell by the sound 
And the tone in his voice
That his heart was slowly dyin'
But mama said "Boy if I ever
Catch you 'round here again
You ain't never gonna have nobody else
Not a woman or a man"

And mama's got a girlfriend now boy
Mama's got a girlfriend now
Mama's got a girlfriend
Mama found a true friend
Mama's got a girlfriend now
Mama's got a girlfriend now boy 
Mama's got a girlfriend now
Mama's got a girlfriend 
Mama's found a true friend
Mama's got a girlfriend now
