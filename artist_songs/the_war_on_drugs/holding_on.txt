Once I was alive and I could feel
I was holding on to you
And I redefined the way I looked at dawn inside of you

I went down a crooked highway
Alone outside the line
I've been rejected, now the man has turned and I'm out of time

Ain't no way I'm gonna last
Hiding in the seams, I can't move the past
Feel like I'm about to crash
Riding on my line, I keep keeping on

Once we were apart and I could see red
Never trying to turn back time
Never meant to bring my pain to the front and into your life

Now I'm headed down a different road
Can we walk it side by side?
Is an old memory just another way of saying goodbye?

Ain't no way I'm gonna last
Hiding in the seams, I can't move the past
Feel like I'm about to crash
Riding the same line, I keep keeping on

And he never gonna change
He never gonna learn
I keep moving on the path, yeah
Holding on to mine

When you talk about the past
What are we talking of?
Did I let go too fast?
Was I holding on too long?

Ain't no truths from the past
As silent as the sea
And it holding on too long
But you're right in front of me

And I'm moving on a cast
Shadows on my seam
I keep moving with the changes, yeah
Ooh
