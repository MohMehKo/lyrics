Well the comedown here was easy
Like the arrival of a new day
But a dream like this gets wasted without you
Under the pressure is where we are
Under the pressure, yea it's where we are babe

Holding over like an illusion 
When it all breaks down and we're runaways
Standing in the wake of our pain
And we stare straight into nothin'
But we're covered all the same
You were raised on a promise
To find out over time
Better come around to the new way
Or watch as it all breaks down here
Under the pressure

River break down here
Stolen away up top
I [?] down the river
Staying alone
When you come here [?]
Lying in a ditch
Pissing in the wind
Lying on my back
Loosening my grip
Wading in the water
Just trying not to crack
Under the pressure
Well I'm surviving
Under the pressure
