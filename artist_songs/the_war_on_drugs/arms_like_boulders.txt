And so now 
Now that you realized that planets are spheres
With oil on the inside
And your god is only a catapult waiting for the right time to let you go
Into the unknown
Just to watch you hold your breath
Yeah and surrender your fortress
And your thoughts will tumble like rocks do 
Over the valleys of factory oceans
The Turkish carpets are flapping as the wind
Drops you down to the surface
Yeah you're looking for the sweethearts

And you're, you're the kind to hide your eyes from the sun
And in your world, the strong survive
But I won't take my body down

Let me tell you
Your arms are like boulders
And your shoulders are cliffs 
But your head keeps rolling off
And your spine it is weak and the weights on your shoulders 
From difference of opinion

There is a song you hear on the radio
It's a funeral march so you change the channel
But it's all you hear as you're driving up the 101 from Mexico to California
There's no snow when you're looking for your sweethearts
Yeah there's no snow when you're looking for your answers

And you're, you're the kind to hide your eyes from the sun
And in your world the strong survive 
But I won't take my body down

And by the time they get your letter of explanation
You'll be dead and gone
Barking up a new tree
And I've got some new friends scaring off the families while tying up your lose ends
Chasing squirrels around your property
Making sure that they know that this is your kingdom
And nothing will stop it
Yeah nothing will stop it
If nothing will stop it
Yeah nothing will stop it

And you're, you're the kind to hide your eyes from the sun
And in your world the strong survive
But won't you lay your body down
Yes and now, now's the time to wrap your ears around the sound
Of your train coming round
You'll have to lay everything down
