Should have known when you came down here
There is no need [x2] there is no urgency
they had your eyes 'neith the cold cold reflection
and in your mid there are pieces that may need connection
after all you have made so many new connections.
Don't be so surprised at your friends and their new directions
they will not follow you to the coast.
Cause there's trouble down here there's trouble down there.
There's trouble everywhere [x2] don'tcha know.
Don't dare return to the place you were born
by sliding in on golden thrones.
And they will not follow you to the coast and back again.
They know what's best for them down the road.
Cause the pieces in your mind
pieces in your mind that may need some reconnections
are places the places in your mind you can put all your new decisions.
Yeah there's trouble down here there's trouble down here
There's trouble everywhere [x2] don'tcha know.
There is no need [x2] there is no urgency
There is no need [x2] there is no urgency

There is no need [x2] there is no urgency
There is no need [x2] there is no urgency.
There's trouble down here there's trouble down there.
