Dig a hole
Plant a seed
Top it off
Watch and see
Pray for rain
Wait a week
It never comes
Underneath the surface
Underneath the surface
The absence is threatening
But just behind the curtain
Just behind the curtain
Something is happening

Judging by the look in your eyes
I'm getting carried away
With all my waiting and my wishing
But I, I know the winds will change
Together we'll get caught in the rain
Caught in the rain
Caught in the rain
Together we'll get caught in the rain
Caught in the rain
Caught in the rain

Lie awake
You never sleep
I tell myself
Gotta make you happy
Whatever cost
Whatever fee
Tomorrow comes
Darling, on the surface
Darling, on the surface
The silence is deafening
But just behind the curtain
Just behind the curtain
Something is happening

Judging by the look in your eyes
I'm getting carried away
With all my waiting and my wishing
But I, I know the winds will change
Together we'll get caught in the rain
Caught in the rain
Caught in the rain
Together we'll get caught in the rain
Caught in the rain
Caught in the rain

There between the wind and clouds
I finally see, I've found out
How impossible it seems
To open up the flood gates
Open up your hands, let go
How impossible it seems
It's possible to me

Dig a hole
Plant a seed
Top it off
Watch and see it

Judging by the look in your eyes
I'm getting carried away
With all my waiting and my wishing
But I, I know the winds will change
Together we'll get caught in the rain
Caught in the rain
Caught in the rain
Together we'll get caught in the rain
Caught in the rain
Caught in the rain

There between the wind and clouds
I finally see, I've found out
How impossible it seems
To open up the flood gates
Open up your hands, let go
How impossible it seems
It's possible to me
