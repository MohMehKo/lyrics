I couldn't keep it a secret any longer
I'm tired of playing cool
If it's a sentimental season girl
Then I'm crazy about you

Well you never come around,
You're never coming home
I'd give you the skin off my bones to get you alone

Pick up the phone, pick up the phone,
Cause when you don't
Girl, I can't handle it
Pick up the phone, pick up the phone tonight
Cause I need someone,
Someone to surrender
To let me inside, to let me inside
I'm all alone
Oh, don't be so cold
Pick up the phone

I couldn't stay in a cage any longer
I'm a lion hear me roar
You've got me tied up so tight
But it ain't right
Girl, it's just not right

If I knew the words to say to you
To melt your heart
Or to get you alone

Pick up the phone, pick up the phone,
Cause when you don't
Girl, I can't handle it
Pick up the phone, pick up the phone tonight
Cause I need someone,
Someone to surrender
To let me inside, let me inside
I'm all alone
Oh, don't be so cold
Pick up the phone

Cause I'm here dying of a broken Friday night
I wanna know why you're not talking
Girl, you bury me alive

Cause I'm the one you want
When all the boys are cruel to you

Pick up the phone
I couldn't keep it a secret any longer
I won't be kept in a cage any longer
You can't keep me away no longer
To get you alone...

Pick up the phone, pick up the phone,
Cause when you don't
Girl, I can't handle it
Pick up the phone, pick up the phone tonight
Cause I need someone,
Someone to surrender
To let me inside, to let me inside
I'm all alone
Oh, don't be so cold
Pick up the phone
