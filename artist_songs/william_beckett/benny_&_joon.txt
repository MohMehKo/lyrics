Hey!
Hey!
Spreading rumors in the hallways, like telephone,
Watered down with white noise, overblown,
Are they ever gonna just leave us alone?
Take a look at all the white coats in the room,
Staring at us sideways, like we’re Benny and Joon,
Yeah we saw that movie, too.

We know what they don’t know, o-o-o-o-o-oh,
We see what they can’t see, o-o-o-o-o-oh.
They say we’re crazy
I say well maybe that’s true,
But we know who we are now,
Just leave us alone. Hey!
Just leave us alone. Hey!

When I met you from the voices in my head,
It felt like a reaction from all the meds.
Now I don’t feel that depressed.
Well now they got me strapped down in the chair,
But as long as you’re beside me, babe, I don’t care.
Well I guess it’s been a really fucked-up year.

No, No, we know what they don’t know, o-o-o-o-o-oh,
We see what they can’t see, o-o-o-o-o-oh.
They say we’re crazy
Okay, well maybe that’s true,
But we know who we are now, in spite of all the flaws,
In spite of all the poison, chemicals and all.
We know who we are now, we know who we are now.
just leave us alone. Hey!
Just leave us alone. Hey!

Take a look at all the white coats in the room,
Staring at us sideways, like we’re Benny and Joon,

We know what they don’t know, o-o-o-o-o-oh,
We see what they can’t see, o-o-o-o-o-oh.
They say we’re crazy
Okay, well maybe that’s true,
But we know who we are now,
Just leave us alone. Hey!
Just leave us alone. Hey!
Just leave us alone, just leave us alone, just leave us alone.

Yeah we saw that movie, too.
