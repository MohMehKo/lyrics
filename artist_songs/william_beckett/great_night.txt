Started out a night full of promise
But if I'm perfectly honest
It was too good to be true
I thought we had quite the connection
But I was headed in a different direction from you
What can I do to thank you?

I've had a great night!
I've had a great night!
But this wasn't it, oh no!
This wasn't it!
I've had a great night!
I've had a great night!
But this wasn't it, oh no!
This wasn't it!

I was there with my glass half full
You were drinking like a raging bull to get through
An hour or two
You're voice was cutting like a knife in my head
What did you say?
What have I said?
I wanna make an excuse to thank you

I've had a great night!
I've had a great night!
But this wasn't it, oh no!
This wasn't it!
I've had a great night!
I've had a great night!
But this wasn't it, oh no!
This wasn't it!

Thanks for the icing on the cake
But it came just a little too late
It's all my fault
My heart's locked up in a vault
Thanks for the trip around the moon
Sorry it had to end so soon
But I couldn't breathe
And air is something I need!

I've had a great night!
I've had a great night!
But this wasn't it, oh no!
This wasn't it!
I've had a great night!
I've had a great night!
But this wasn't it, oh no!
This wasn't it!
