[William Beckett]
You keep painting a scene
Try so hard to believe, this is easy.
And every cheap magazine will reminder her, that people don't change.
But the truth of the matter, is the basterds, and patrens keep repeating.
Your asking for answers, to questions like you're chasing a dream.

You're not alone,
Know that I'm here,
Know that I won't take you for granted.
The holes in our heart, are ready to heal.

So.. Stop waiting, stop taking control, your life is on the line.
Stop looking, I'm right here, it's not a sign of a time.
It's time for a sign.
It's time for a sign.

The beast of the burden, burning lies down a sign, on a tv.
Yeah. You caught every corner, till you left, with a circle of pain.

I know how you feel, like there's nothing to gain.
Know that I never leave you guessing.
The holes in our lives, are starting to fill.

So.. Stop waiting, stop taking control, your life is on the line.
Stop looking, I'm right here, it's not a sign of a time.
It's time for a sign.
I'm  here for you.
Here for you and you forever.

[Derek Sanders]
You and you and forever.
You and you and forever.

You're not alone,
Know that I'm here,
Know that I won't take you for granted. No.
