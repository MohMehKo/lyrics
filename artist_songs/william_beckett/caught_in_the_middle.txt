She locks the door
Caught in the middle
I sit by the staircase
Caught in the middle
She won't come down
And I'm stuck here glued to the ground

Give me something to take
Cause I'm bout to break
You know a tightrope walk won't do it
You better run headfirst into it
And say whatever you're saying
You're gonna wake up here without her
Lonely

I can't escape
Caught in the middle
She cleans the apartment
I feel like exploding
But I'm stuck here glued to the ground

Give me something to take
Cause I'm bout to break
You know a tightrope walk won't do it
You better run headfirst into it
And say whatever you're saying
You're gonna wake up here without her
Lonely

I gotta get out, gotta get out
But I don't know how
I gotta get out, gotta get out
I can't hear the sound
The rain is coming down
And I'm caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Give me something to take
Cause I'm bout to break
You know a tightrope walk won't do it
You better run headfirst into it
And say whatever you're saying
You're gonna wake up here without her

Give me something to take
I feel like exploding
Cause I'm bout to break
I feel like exploding
Caught in the middle

Give me something to take
