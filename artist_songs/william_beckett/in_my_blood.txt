I gotta stop and remember what my mother said:
It's in my blood
And I don't want to dampen the experience
Of living and learning and love

I've got plans to make and hearts to break,
even if that heart is in my chest
And another thing,
I wouldn't bet on this ending well

Oh, oh, oh, one night, one time is not enough
Oh, oh, oh, in the moment I can't help myself
In the morning I'm gonna feel like hell
But I do it anyway

Don't get me wrong, it's not like I enjoy it
But I'm too far gone
And I've fought, climbing up the mountain
But I'm never quite reaching the top

I've got plans to make and hearts to break
Even if that heart is in my chest
And another thing, I wouldn't bet on this one ending well

Oh, oh, oh, one night, one time is not enough
Oh, oh, oh, in the moment I can't help myself
In the morning I'm gonna feel like hell
But I do it anyway

I've got plans to make and hearts to break
Even if that heart is in my chest
And another thing, I wouldn't bet on this one ending well
No, this won't end too well

Oh, oh, oh, one night, one time is not enough
Oh, oh, oh, in the moment I can't help myself
In the morning I'm gonna feel like hell
But I do it anyway

I've gotta stop and remember what my mother said:
It's in my blood
