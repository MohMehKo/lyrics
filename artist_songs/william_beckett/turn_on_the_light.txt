Can I come over?
Can I stay the night?
'Cause all my friends are sad
And I need someone,
Someone to hold me tight
'Cause I've been feeling bad, so bad.

We could stay awake for hours,
We could talk all night
About everything you want,
about everything you are.

I, I will listen

m I awake or am I dreaming?
Let's put the moon to bed tonight
I'll be your shelter when the storm's rolling in
If you'll wait for me, wait for me
Turn on the light

Can I come with you?
Can I stay a while?
'Cause I believe in you
And you believe in life
The future's wide if you let me inside
We could dance,
If you give me the chance

I, I'll be waiting

Am I awake or am I dreaming?
Let's put the moon to bed tonight
I'll be your shelter when the storm's rolling in
If you'll wait for me, wait for me
Turn on the light

I will build you castles painted white
We could live forever, we could live forever
I'll do anything to be with you tonight, tonight
I will find you

Turn on the light

Can I come over?
Can I stay the night?

Am I awake or am I dreaming?
Let's put the moon to bed tonight
I'll be your shelter when the storm's rolling in
If you wait for me, wait for me
Turn on the light
Turn on the light

If you wait for me, wait for me
Say you'll wait for me, wait for me
Turn on the light
