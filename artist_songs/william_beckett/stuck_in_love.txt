This may be an after-thought
But after all the luck was gone
So was your interest in me
I was suspicious and naive
It started with a simple kiss
Blinded by your innocence
But I see clearer this time
The smoke in the mirror is starting to rise

Stuck in love with you
Take a look at what you got me into
The paralyzing truth
Is living even one minute without you
Is a moment I'd rather not have to live to see
Well I'm stuck in love, I'm stuck in love
So hopelessly 

Even with my best excuse
I can't convince myself that you
Were good for more than cheap thrills
I need to leave you but I never will (I never will)

Stuck in love with you
Take a look at what you got me into
The paralyzing truth
Is living even one minute without you
Is a moment I'd rather not have to live to see
Well I'm stuck in love, I'm stuck in love
So hopelessly 

Take your time
You've already got mine
Take it
We're locked inside
A room with one light
You'd break it
Will you break it, you break it?
Will you break it, you break it? 

Stuck in love with you
Take a look at what you got me into
The paralyzing truth
Is living even one minute without you
Is a moment I'd rather not have to live to see
Well, I'm stuck in love, I'm stuck in love
I'm stuck in love
So hopelessly
