Tick tock, time is of the essence
I don't mind sharing my possessions with you
Bad news, don't know how to take it
You said, I don't know how to break it to you

Don't know if this can be fixed again
But can we just pretend?

Let's slip away, off to a place
Where everything you wish comes true
Let's stand hand in hand, face to face
I'll take your breath away from you
I know my heart is not prepared
To wake without you lying there

You said to hold myself together
You said you want someone better for you
(May everything you wish come true)
Okay I know what you're saying
You need space from all the suffocating I do
(I'll take your breath away from you)

Don't know if this can be fixed again
But can we just pretend?
Pretend now

Let's slip away, off to a place
Where everything you wish comes true
Let's stand hand in hand, face to face
I'll take your breath away from you
I know my heart is not prepared
To wake without you lying there
(Lying there, oh)

Let's slip away, off to a place
Where everything you wish comes true
Let's stand hand in hand, face to face
I'll take your breath away from you
I know my heart is not prepared
To wake without you lying there

Tick tock, time is of the essence
You said you wanted someone better for you
