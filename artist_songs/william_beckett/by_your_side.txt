Get some rest, it's a winding road
That stretches toward the truth
And it might go on forever
I confess
There's an empty shell
That's broken, battered, bruised
Only not when we're together
Oh

Tonight I'm by your side
Even in your darkest hour
I swear I'm not lying
Even when sweet turns sour
I will be by your side

We could lie
Like runaway trains exploding off the tracks
And I think about our daughter
And survive
Forget all the things I wish I could take back
And remember what we taught her
Yeah, remember what we taught her
Alright

Tonight I'm by your side
Even in your darkest hour
I'm swear I'm not lying
Even when sweet turns sour
I will be by your side
By your side
By your side
Yeah

Tonight I'm by your side
Even in your darkest hour

Tonight I'm by your side
Even in your darkest hour
I swear I'm not lying
Even when sweet turns sour
Even in your darkest hour
I will be by your side
