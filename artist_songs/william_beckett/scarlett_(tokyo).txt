Let it go
Take a bullet to the shore
Forget about the ones
Calling us hopeless
All alone
In the city by the sun
In the carousel our love*
Is falling to pieces
One last star rise before I go

Oh Scarlett
I don't care how far it is
I wanna go to Tokyo from the West most coast
Tokyo from the West most coast
Oh Scarlett
Go back to where we started
I wanna go to Tokyo from the West most coast
Tokyo from the West most coast

In the dark
In the moonlit midnight cold
All the light my love has known
Will not be forgotten
There you are
In the shadows close to home
On an island of your own
Lost in this moment
One last star rise before I go

Oh Scarlett
I don't care how far it is
I wanna go to Tokyo from the West most coast
Tokyo from the West most coast
Oh Scarlett
Go back to where we started
I wanna go to Tokyo from the West most coast
Tokyo from the West most coast

One last star rise before I go

Oh Scarlett
I don't care how far it is
I wanna go to Tokyo from the West most coast
Tokyo from the West most coast
Oh Scarlett
Go back to where we started
I wanna go to Tokyo from the West most coast
Tokyo from the West most coast

Oh Scarlett
I don't care how far it is
I wanna go to Tokyo from the West most coast
Tokyo from the West most coast
Oh Scarlett
Go back to where we started
I wanna go to Tokyo from the West most coast
Tokyo from the West most coast
