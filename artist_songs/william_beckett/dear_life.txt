Call me cold, cold-hearted
Hard-headed, headed straight for disaster
Call me out, out-smarted
A smarter mind would have minded my manners

Don't get me wrong, don't get me wrong
Never meant to take you for granted
Chuck a bomb, bombarded
Boarded up, up head in the rafters

Loss of composure, with nothing to say
When the weight's on my shoulders, I get carried away
My only intention is seeing you smile

Holding, holding on for dear life
Holding, holding on to get it right
Don't get me wrong, get me wrong
Never meant to take you for granted
Holding, holding on for dear life
Holding on to get it right

Kind of kind, kind of funny
Funny times, time's not in our favor
Get me hard, hard honey
Honey bitter, bittersweet behavior

Don't get me wrong, get me wrong
Never meant to take you for granted
Call me cold, cold-hearted
Hard-headed, headed straight for danger

Loss of composure, with nothing to say
When the weight's on my shoulders, I get carried away
My only intention is seeing you smile

Holding, holding on for dear life
Holding, holding on to get it right
Don't get me wrong, get me wrong
Never meant to take you for granted
Holding, holding on for dear life
Holding on to get it right

Call me cold, cold-hearted
Hard-headed, headed straight for disaster
Let's go back to where we started
We were happy, happily-ever-after... right?

Holding, holding on for dear life
Holding, holding on to get it right
Don't get me wrong, get me wrong
Never meant to take you for granted
Holding, holding on for dear life
Holding on to, holding on to get it right
Holding on to, holding on to get it right
Holding on to, holding on to
Don't get me wrong, get me wrong
Never meant to take you for granted
Holding, holding on for dear life
Holding on to get it right
