Ooh, Ooh, 
Tell me how you're feeling about her heart,
Do you hear the dam when it falls apart?
Do you know her name or anything at all,
About the weight she carries up and down the halls?

There's a star about to fall.

There's a girl out there who wants it just the same as you and me,
Picturing herself, picture perfect she'll never be.
Her father left her mother,
Her mother left her to believe, time has got to be stuck in her way.
Ooh, Stuck in her way, Ooh, Stuck in her way.

Another day, another lonely place,
Another day, I'm gonna go insane.
No one else seems to have it this hard,
No one else has to cover these scars.

Falling like a house of cards.

There's a girl out there who wants it just the same as you and me,
Picturing herself, picture perfect she'll never be.
Her father left her mother,
Her mother left her to believe, time has got to be stuck in her way.
Ooh, Stuck in her way, Ooh, Stuck in her way, Ooh, Stuck in her way, Ooh. 

Soon enough you're gonna graduate,
Start again when you turn the page.
It gets better girl just you wait ,
It gets better girl just you wait.
Ooh, Just you wait, Ooh, Just you wait, Ooh, Ooh.
