I love it when you keep me up at night,
Lie away until we bathe in the sunlight
And laugh about it when we lost track of time

I love it when we run around all day
Slow it down, and collapse under the shade
Forget the world and get lost in your eyes

Wells may dry, but I know I
I always wanna feel this way
I always wanna feel this way
Two young hearts about to bloom
If this is a dream, okay
I don't ever wanna wake up
I'll just lie here next to you
Hanging on a honeymoon

Let's get a room so we can lock the door,
And throw the key out of a third floor window
Grab the bucket, we can ice the champagne

Intoxicated by the words you say
Double vision with my knees wobbling
You drive me crazy when you whisper my name

Time might fly, but I know I
I always wanna feel this way
I always wanna feel this way
Two young hearts about to bloom
If this is a dream, okay
I don't ever wanna wake up
I'll just lie here next to you
Hanging on a honeymoon
