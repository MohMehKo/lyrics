You let me in and you're still getting dressed
You take the time to always look your best
There's a million people just like me
But there's no one I'd dare compare to you

We're at the show under the marquee
You light a smoke and then lean into me
There's a million people just like me
But there's no one I'd dare compare to you, no

Daunting daydream, haunting heartstrings
Love, am I tall enough to reach such heights
And walk that line without looking down?
Alright

Behind the wheel as you crack a smile
I'm trying hard to make it worth your while
There's a million people just like me
But there's no one I'd dare compare to you

And then at home, I know what's on your mind
You're staring hard across the room with that look in your eyes
And there's no one I'd dare compare to you

Daunting daydream, haunting heartstrings
Love, am I tall enough to reach such heights
And walk that line without looking down?
Thank you my dear for getting me the strength I fear
I would not find without you around

Daunting daydream, haunt my heartstrings
Love, am I tall enough to reach such heights
And walk that line without looking down?
Well, thank you my dear for getting me the strength I fear
I would not find without you around, oh no
