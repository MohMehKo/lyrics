We laid in bed and talked 'til 3 A.M.
Now I'm restlessly counting cracks in the ceiling
We fooled around,
We were spontaneous
Now it's calendars and inconvenience

Caught in the current tearing us apart,
But I'll keep on swimming until my arms give out

Cause I can't let you go
Cause I can't let you go
Can't watch you drift away
No matter what it takes
I'll bring you back to shore
I can't let you go

Your smile could fill a room with radiance
Now it's barely bright enough to light the hallway
There was a time when we were dangerous
But now we play it cool and tell ourselves it's okay

Caught in the current tearing us apart
But I'll keep on swimming until my arms give out

Cause I can't let you go
Cause I can't let you go
Can't watch you drift away
No matter what it takes
I'll bring you back to shore
I can't let you go

I want to always feel the way I did
When you caught me by surprise for the first time

Cause I can't let you go
Cause I can't let you go
Can't watch you drift away
No matter what it takes
I'll bring you back to shore
I can't let you go
