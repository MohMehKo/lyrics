So I hear you're feeling pretty bad about
Since graduation, how your life's worked out
Disappointment spread across your face

And all the friends you had got outta town
Traveled the world and have their lives mapped out
While you're moping, hanging 'round your place

Don't forget
To remember that the walls you hide behind
Are the same ones that surround each and every soul alive
Soul alive

There's a light that shines
Just beyond the darkness, the dead of night
A whisper in the wind, "stand up and fight"
Breaking walls down
Walls

Sometimes motivation isn't hard to find
Out in the open, in the spotlight
And it disappears as quick as it came

Oh girl, just wait two years it's not that long
You gotta stop stressing 'bout all the things that went wrong
And start believing in yourself, Charmaine, Charmaine, Charmaine

There's a light that shines
Just beyond the darkness, the dead of night
A whisper in the wind, "stand up and fight"
Breaking walls down
Walls down
Walls down

Start believing in yourself Charmaine (whoa)
Start believing in yourself Charmaine (whoa)
Start believing in yourself Charmaine (whoa)
(There's a light that shines, whoa)
Start believing in yourself

There's a light that shines
Just beyond the darkness, the dead of night
A whisper in the wind, "stand up and fight"
Breaking walls down
Walls down
Walls down
Break my walls down
