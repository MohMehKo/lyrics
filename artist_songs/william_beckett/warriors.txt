She never sleeps
Never lets you leave
You're here for life 
So give it up
So give it up
Dirty streets, got no sympathy for you tonight 
So give it up 
We're gonna die young, so give it up
I wanna know that I'm not alone here 
Are you with her or against her?

Search and destroy
There's nothing left to fear
No desperation
The streetlights 
It's my city and I owe no explanation

Fake calls 
Princes rise and fall 
No, she don't mind 
Whoa, it's not enough
She won't stop it's not enough
If you feel the way I feel it's the course you're on now
I wanna know that I'm not alone here 
Are you with her or against her?

Search and destroy 
There's nothing left to fear 
No desperation 
The streetlights 
It's my city and I owe no explanation
Search and destroy
There's nothing left to fear 
No desperation 
The streetlights 
It's my city and I owe no explanation

There's no where to hide 
She'll find you 
There's no where to hide 
She'll find you 
There's no where to hide 
She'll find...you

Search and destroy
There's nothing left to fear
No desperation
The streetlights
It's my city and I owe no explanation 
Search and destroy 
There's nothing left to fear 
No desperation 
The streetlights 
It's my city and I owe no explanation
