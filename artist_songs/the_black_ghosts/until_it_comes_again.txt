Until it comes again

Until it comes again

it used to be it was all I want, my only care
nothing else had a single part to play in my head
but now times led my mind astray, something was changed along the way
and no amount of tears can bring it back round til it comes again

so maybe we should pretend we're who we want to be
and forget who we really are and where we really be
cause I've no time to start again but I won't to a bitter end
can we keep it down til its back round til it comes
again

until it comes again, until it comes again

one more time to take the test to make it real
or one more nail in this relationship make it
impossible to heal
on the good ship hope we sail but the stars above say
the wind will fail
can we keep afloat until its back round until it comes again

until it comes again, until it comes again
until it comes again, until it comes again
