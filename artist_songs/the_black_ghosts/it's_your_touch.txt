Its your touch
It's the way you bring love
And I can't explain why I'm falling for this feeling
Its your smile
It's the look in your eyes
And I can't explain what you've done to me

Yeah you know how to steal my show
Its about time, its about time
Yeah you know how to make things flow
Its about time, its about time

And I guess that you're wondering what I'm doing for you
And I guess that I'm wondering quite the same thing
Is it because I'm here that you're looking for someone else
If you were on your own what would you do

Its your touch
It's the way you bring love
And I can't explain why I'm falling for this feeling
Its your smile
It's the look in your eyes
And I can't explain what you've done to me
And I guess that you're wondering what I'm doing for you
And I guess that I'm wondering quite the same thing
Is it because I'm here that you're looking for someone else
If you were on your own what would you do

Its your touch
It's the way you bring love
And I can't explain why I'm falling for this feeling
Its your smile
It's the look in your eyes
And I can't explain what you've done to me

No I can't explain what you've done to meâ€¦.
