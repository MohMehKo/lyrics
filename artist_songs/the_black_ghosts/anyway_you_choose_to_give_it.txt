I hope you know what your doing to me here
What your doing to me me here
Take some responsibility for your awareness of the levels on which we lie
I'd hate to believe only to find that I'm wrong
I'm wrong, I'm wrong, I'm wrong, I'm wrong
I'm wrong, I'm wrong, I'm wrong, I'm wrong
Don't act that way it's unbecoming just do what you do
Do what you do, do what you do, do what you do, do what you do

I only know that you're the one that always makes me feel it
It's nothing that you do or say it's just the way you are
If I could bottle what you got then life would be too perfect
I'll take it as it comes, any way you choose to give it

I challenge you to make a wrong move
A wrong move, a wrong move
Even when your acting the fool I cannot see through you
Through you, through you
The culmination of experience that I can only ever dream of
Is tearing your clothes off
How many lifetimes does it take to live in the present day
Live in the present day, live in the present day

I only know that your the one that always makes me feel it
It's nothing that you do or say it's just the way you are
If I could bottle what you got then life would be too perfect
I'll take it as it comes, any way you choose to give it

I only know that your the one that always makes me feel it
It's nothing that you say or do it's just the way you are
If I could bottle what you got then life would be too perfect
I'll take it as it comes, any way you choose to give it

Any way you choose to give it is sincerely a pleasure of mine
Mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine
But don't think you can imitate the accent of fate
You've got to walk the line, walk the line
And I can think of a few things to say to make things right
But by the time I say them we will be in different light
Please appreciate the limits of the flesh
The spirit will not rest, will not be satisfied with anybody else

I only know that your the one that always makes me feel it
It's nothing that you do or say it's just the way you are
If I could bottle what you got then life would be too perfect
I'll take it as it comes, any way you choose to give it

I only know that your the one that always makes me feel it
It's nothing that you do or say it's just the way you are
If I could bottle what you got then life would be too perfect
I'll take it as it comes, any way you choose to give it
