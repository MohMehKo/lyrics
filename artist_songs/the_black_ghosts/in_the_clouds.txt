I don’t know what I’m doing when I'm not with you
My head is in the clouds
We’re in a bubble baby, big enough for two
I’ll never let you out

All we need 
To find is a tunnel
From this world

I don’t know what I’m doing when I'm not with you
My head is in the clouds
We’re in a bubble baby, big enough for two
I’m never getting out

Over time
It will be
All we need to feel

We’ll be frozen in time
Gliding through the galaxy
I just want to give up all

I don’t know what I’m doing when I'm not with you
My head is in the clouds
We’re in a bubble baby, big enough for two
We’re never getting out
