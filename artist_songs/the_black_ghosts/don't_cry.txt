Don't cry, dear, it ain't worth it
The rain on your face says it all
Don't cry, dear, it ain't worth it
Together we'll fall

It's true, I won't believe it's not

I feel it from my nose to my toes

I've got no time to figure out why

Before I say I do
Would you like to know what I am thinking?

Don't cry, dear, it ain't worth it
The rain on your face says it all
Don't cry, dear, it ain't worth it
Together we'll fall

And I would like to read your time
Highlight all the best bits
And you could sleep relentlessly
The power of the blind

You see what others can't see
At least that's what you tell me
What other reason could there be
For giving me your heart?

Don't cry, dear, it ain't worth it
The rain on your face says it all
Don't cry, dear, it ain't worth it
Together we'll fall

Don't cry, dear, it ain't worth it
The rain on your face says it all
Don't cry, dear, it ain't worth it
Together we'll fall
Together we'll fall
Together we'll fall
