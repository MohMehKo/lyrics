Peaceful protest
Silent attention
Ignore the prevention
And go for the front.

The climate is changing
The headline's Raging
The panic contagious
are overload

Can you forget thats all gone wrong
I can't remember much forgetfulness
Can you forget this all gone wrong
I can't remember much forgetfulness

Your keys are missing
The date of that first kissing
The library book
The name of film with the dirty look

Wait to find
Those pleasant times
They fell apart in chemical laughter
then a teenage chapter

Can you forget that is all gone wrong
I can't remember much, forgetfulness
Can you forget this all gone wrong
I can't remember much, forgetfulness

Can you forget that is all gone wrong
I can't remember much, forgetfulness
Can you forget this all gone wrong
I can't remember much, forgetfulness
