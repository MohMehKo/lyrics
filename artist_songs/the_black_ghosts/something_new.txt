A different time and place some new faces in my life is what I'm needing
I've grown old too fast and whole weeks pass without a single glimpse of meaning
And if disaster came at least there'd be a change
it's got to be better than sitting on this beach
I feel it there in front of me but in my present life
of holding court with scheming money grabbers its
getting further out of reach

So give me something new
Something to break through the normal
The things I have to do to keep myself from falling
out of view
A different way to walk some new words to talk a
climate change is what I'm needing
I've turned to the dark I've ignored the spark
I've found ways to numb my feelings
But its no good, behind my hood are dreams of better
days in better places
I feel it there in front of me but in my present life
of holding court with ungrateful pretenders
its getting further out of reach

So give me something new
Something to break through the normal
The things I have to do to keep myself from falling
out of view

So give me something new
Something to break through the normal
The things I have to do to keep myself from falling out of view
