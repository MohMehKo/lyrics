If the sky burns then we'll take turns holding back the blue.
If the feel falls off and see saws we'll stick the sails with glue.
Couldn't be no better, no matter how high.
Let me take you there, drinking the moonlight.

If I tell you that I love you, look me in the eye.
If I write it in a letter, read between the lines.
if you draw up this better, girl you'll make my day.
Should've known better, water will find a way.

If the truth hurts, dead computers, dancing in the lane.
If the dream fades, best plans unlaid, fuck away the pain.
Couldn't be no better, no matter how high.
Let me take you there, drinking the moonlight.

If I tell you that I love you, look me in the eye.
If I write it in a letter, read between the lines.
if you draw up this better, girl you'll make my day.
Should've known better, water will find a way.

If redemption, love acsension, burns within the flame.
If the circle, colour purple, drawn around my name.
Couldn't be no better, no matter how high.
Let me take you there, drinking the moonlight.

If I tell you that I love you, look me in the eye.
If I write it in a letter, read between the lines.
if you draw up this better, girl you'll make my day.
Should've known better, water will find a way.
