Oh oh oh oh
I feel I'm walking on the moon today
oooo

My steps are long
My breath is short
My voice won't carry
The weight of my heart

I spent too long
Falling to the ground 
Staring up back to you 
As it spins around, around, around

I feel I'm walking on the moon today
oooo
I don't know what I've done to get this way
oooo

My friends are gone
Lost fire below
Or am I sinking 
Out of control?

Searching for 
The meteorite
Astral body
Set me alight, alight

I feel I'm walking on the moon today
oooo
I don't know what done to get this way
oooo

Up here, no one hears you cry
No one hears you laughing
Up here, no one sees you smile
No one hears your heartbreak

No one looks for an answer
No one asks you why
No one stops you dancing
No one stops you getting high

No one holds you hand 
No one shuts the door 
No one makes demands 
No one asks for more 

We want more, We want more, We want more, We want more, We want more, We want more, We want more, We want more, 
We want more, We want more, We want more, We want more, We want more, We want more, We want more, We want more
(oooooo aah, oooooo aah)
