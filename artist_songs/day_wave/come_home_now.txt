People always say, "Get out of your head
You've been there too long
Pretty soon, you'll be dead"
Then I thought, oh, I've been thinking too hard
I should come down now to get out of my head

Yeah, I should come down now and get out of my head

She said, "Darling, come home now
Cause you've been away too long"
I said, "Hey now, I've been right here"
Somehow I know I'm wrong

People always say, don't be so blunt
You're gonna hurt somebody, don't kill no one
And I guess they're right, I should just be nice
Cause if I'm not careful, I might hurt someone

Yeah, if I'm not careful, I might hurt someone

She said, "Darling, come home now
Cause you've been away too long"
I said, "Hey now, I've been right here"
Somehow I know I'm wrong

She said, "Darling, come home now
Cause you've been away too long"
She said, "Darling, come home now"
Somehow I know I'm wrong

She said, "Darling, come home now
Cause you've been away for too long"
I said, "Hey now, I've been right here"
Somehow I know I'm wrong
