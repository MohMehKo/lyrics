You can't just play another
When you owe me
A round-tooth, runaway town
And we don't need each other
'Cause we're only
Around to be in a crown

I can't remember all of it
But I wanted
To be here, under the ground
And you don't want to be here
But you always
Find your way down

But I wanted
To be here, under the ground
And you don't want to be here
I wanted
To be here
But I wanted
To be here, under the ground

But I wanted
To be here, under the ground
(I can't remember all of it)
But I wanted
To be here, under the ground
But I wanted
To be here, under the ground
(And you don't want to be here)
I wanted
To be here, under the ground
But I wanted
To be here, under the ground
(I can't remember all of it)
I wanted
To be here, under the ground
But I wanted
To be here, under the ground
(And you don't want to be here)
