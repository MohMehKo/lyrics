I'm not a kid anymore
I wake up at one
So what am I good for
Besides trying to have fun?

I do whatever I want
But I still want more
If I do whatever I want
Why am I still bored?

What am I good for?
Somebody tell me
Cause I don't know anymore
What am I good for?
Somebody tell me
Cause I don't know anymore

Spend my days alone
Lost in my head
Talk with the wrong tone
Everyone's upset

I still have no girl
After all this time
I say, fuck the world
After all this time

What am I good for?
Somebody tell me
Cause I don't know anymore
What am I good for?
Somebody tell me
Cause I don't know anymore

What am I good for?
Nothing at all
What am I good for?
Nothing at all

What am I good for?
Somebody tell me
Cause I don't know anymore
What am I good for?
Somebody tell me
Cause I don't know anymore
