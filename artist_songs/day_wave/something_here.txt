I'm laying around
My head on the ground
I feel that I'm sinking in
I'm walking around
I look at the ground
I feel like they're listening

There's something here, oh
And my head feels heavy
There's something here, oh
And my head feels heavy

There's nothing to say
So keep from my way
I feel that nothing's real
Turning around
To touch the ground
I feel that nothing's real

There's something here, oh
And my head feels heavy
There's something here, oh
And my head feels heavy

I'm laying around
My head on the ground
I feel that I'm sinking in
I'm walking around
I look at the ground
I feel like they're listening

There's something here, oh
And my head feels heavy
There's something here, oh
And my head feels heavy
