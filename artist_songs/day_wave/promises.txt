Hey now, I wanna get to know you
Cause you're funny and you look good too
Am I cool?
Maybe not but I could try
So let's do something tonight before we die

When I see you my arms feel weak
When I see you I cannot speak
When I see you, when I see you

Promise me you won't run away with my heart
Promise me you're not trying to kill me
Promise me you won't run away with my heart
Promise you I'm not leaving you in the dark

Hey now, we don't have a lot of time
Cause rumors that the sky might fall tonight
But it's okay 'cause we have the whole day
So we could find a plane and fly away

When I see you my arms feel weak
When I see you I cannot speak
When I see you, when I see you

Promise me you won't run away with my heart
Promise me you're not trying to kill me
Promise me you won't run away with my heart
Promise you I'm not leaving you in the dark

When I see you my arms feel weak
When I see you I cannot speak
When I see you, when I see you

Promise me you won't run away with my heart
Promise me you're not trying to kill me
Promise me you won't run away with my heart
Promise you I'm not leaving you in the dark

My heart
My heart
