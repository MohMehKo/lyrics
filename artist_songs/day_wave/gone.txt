You think I'm still the same
In every single way
But I changed

You think I need something
To make this go away
But I changed

And I feel this way
I feel this way alone
And I feel this way
I feel this way alone

And you're gone, you're gone
And you're gone, you're gone

The things I'll never say
Keep them tucked away
Cause I changed

The things you want to hear
But they all disappear
They're not here

And I feel this way
I feel this way alone
And I feel this way
I feel this way alone

And you're gone, you're gone
And you're gone, you're gone
And you're gone, you're gone
And you're gone, you're gone

Do I belong?
Do I belong?
Do I belong?
Do I belong?

And you're gone, you're gone
And you're gone, you're gone
And you're gone, you're gone
And you're gone, you're gone
