I know what you need
I know what you don't see in me
You're always the same
Who do you think that I should blame?

I am okay
You're always the same way
And nothing will ever change
And I blame
(Baby, baby, baby...)

Cause you are who you are
Cause you are who you are

I know that you wait
I know what you don't see in me
It's okay
It's okay

Cause you are who you are
Cause you are who you are
Cause you are who you are
Cause you are who you are
