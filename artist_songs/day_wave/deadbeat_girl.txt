I wait
I waited for you
I wanted for you
Something new
For us to do
You say
You've found your calling
You're running away
And there's nothing left
For us to do

Okay I'm looking for a reaction
Oh
But you're not good at them
Okay I'm looking for a reaction
Oh
But you're not good at them

I know what you're doing
You're running away again
I know what you're doing
I'm already way ahead
'Cause you're a deadbeat girl
A deadbeat girl at heart
And when you try to be okay
You just fall apart
I know
I know you're hurting
I'm not gonna say anything
Or anything
I know
I know it's bad
I'm not gonna stay around
For anything

Okay I'm looking for a reaction
Oh
But you're not good at them
Okay I'm looking for a reaction
Oh
But you're not good at them

I know what you're doing
You're running away again
I know what you're doing
I'm already way ahead
'Cause you're a deadbeat girl
A deadbeat girl at heart
And when you try to be okay
You just fall apart

'Cause you're a deadbeat girl
A deadbeat girl at heart
And when you try to be okay
You just fall apart
'Cause you're a deadbeat girl
A deadbeat girl at heart
And when you try to be okay
You just fall apart

I know what you're doing
You're running away again
I know what you're doing
I'm already way ahead
'Cause you're a deadbeat girl
A deadbeat girl at heart
And when you try to be okay
You just fall apart
