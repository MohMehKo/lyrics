Come down
I won't come back down
I'm too burnt out
Again

And I know
I've done this before
I'll just fall out
Again

I'm wasting all my time
I push it all away
I'm wasting all my time
I push it all away

Follow in your footsteps
I'll keep going on
Again

And I know
I've done this before
I'll just fall out
Again

I'm wasting all my time
I push it all away
I'm wasting all my time
I push it all away

Come down
I won't come back down
I'm too burnt out
Again

And I know
I've done this before
I'll just fall out
Again

I'm wasting all my time
I push it all away
I'm wasting all my time
I push it all away

I'm wasting all my time
I push it all away
I'm wasting all my time
I push it all away
