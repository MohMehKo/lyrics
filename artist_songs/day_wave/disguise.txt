All I can do is keep away from you
I could be messed up inside but perfect in your eyes

All of our lives we're walking in disguise
But we're perfect in our eyes
We're perfect in our eyes

Take this from me 'cause I'm dying quietly
We could be messed up inside but perfect in our eyes

All of our lives we're walking in disguise
But we're perfect in our eyes
We're perfect in our eyes

(Perfect in our eyes)
