Hurry up, hurry up let's go
I've been tired all along
This place is bringing me down
And my feelings are all around
Don't know how to feel about

You
You

I know I'm looking around
I'm out of place in the wrong town
We won't be done 'til we've had our fun
But I just want to go home now
Cause I don't know how to feel about

You
You
