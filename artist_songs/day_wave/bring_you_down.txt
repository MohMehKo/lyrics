I'm shaking and I don't want to be that way
I'm fading and I don't want to be that way

And I'm not changing all I know
I need a place to go

I want to be around
But I, I bring you down
I want to be around
But I, I bring you down

I'm holding back but I don't want to be like that
The days we had, I don't want to be like that

And I'm not trying all alone
I need a place to go

I want to be around
But I, I bring you down
I want to be around
But I, I bring you down

You're asking for too much
You're already here
You're asking for too much
You're already here

I want to be around
But I, I bring you down (Down)
I want to be around
But I, I bring you down (Down)
