You think you know me
But nobody knows me
I'm stuck in my head
When you show me that everyone falls in
I'm stuck in my head

I don't want to let you in
When I'm sinking to the ground for nothing
I don't want to let you in
Cause I pull you to the ground for nothing

Well you might know this
I'm thinking about it
Cause you're stuck in my head
And I'll be honest
I'm running away
Cause you're stuck in my head

I don't want to let you in
When I'm sinking to the ground for nothing
I don't want to let you in
Cause I pull you to the ground for nothing

You're always somewhere
You're always somewhere
You're always somewhere
You're always somewhere

I don't want to let you in
When I'm sinking to the ground for nothing
I don't want to let you in
Cause I pull you to the ground for nothing
