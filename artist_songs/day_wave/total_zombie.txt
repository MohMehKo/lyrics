Here I go
No, I can't be around you anymore
Just turn around and let me walk away
Just turn around and let me walk away

Close your eyes and I'll close mine
Honey, close your heart, it just takes time
And we'll be alright, we'll be alright
Close your eyes and I'll close mine
Honey, close your heart, it just takes time
And we'll be alright, we'll be alright

Cause I'm such a total zombie
And you're gold, honey
I wish I would have been told
Only a fool would want me
And you're gold, honey
I wish I would have been told

Just look around
The world around you is upside down
And I'm falling, I'm falling
I'm bringing you underground

So just close your eyes and I'll close mine
Honey, close your heart, it just takes time
And we'll be alright, we'll be alright
Close your eyes and I'll close mine
Honey, close your heart, it just takes time
And we'll be alright, we'll be alright

Cause I'm such a total zombie
And you're gold, honey
I wish I would have been told
Only a fool would want me
And you're gold, honey
I wish I would have been told

Close your eyes and I'll close mine
Honey, close your heart, it just takes time
And we'll be alright, we'll be alright
So just close your eyes and I'll close mine
Honey, close your heart, it just takes time
And we'll be alright, we'll be alright
Only a fool would want me
And you're gold, honey
I wish I would have been told

Cause I'm such a total zombie
And you're gold, honey
I wish I would have been told
Only a fool would want me
And you're gold, honey
I wish I would have been told
