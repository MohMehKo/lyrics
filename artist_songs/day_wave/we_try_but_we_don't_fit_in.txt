I made a mess with all of my friends
I made a mess, I'll do it again

Hold on, who am I again?
Go on, I just make a mess
All my friends, we're just the same
We all pretend that we're okay

I made a mess with all of my friends
I made a mess, I'll do it again

We don't fit in
Not even a little bit
We're in between
The things that we're supposed to be

We try, we try
We try, we try

I made a mess with all of my friends
I made a mess, I'll do it again

I, I'll do it again
I, I'll do it again
We try, we try
We try, we try

I made a mess with all of my friends
I made a mess, I'll do it again

We try, we try
We try, we try
