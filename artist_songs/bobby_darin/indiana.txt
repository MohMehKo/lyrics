[Johnny:]
Back home again in Indiana

[Bobby:]
Ah... talk about the South! 

[Johnny:]
And it seems that I can see 
The gleaming candlelight 
Still shinin' bright 
Through the sycamores for me. 
The new mown hay 
Sends all its fragrance... 

[Bobby:]
You know 'bout that jazz. 

[Johnny:]
From the fields I used to roam. 

[Bobby:]
I'm a Yankee myself. 

[Johnny:]
When I dream about the moonlight on the Wabash 
then I long for my Indian home. 

[Bobby:]
Sounds like it could be fun! 

Back home again in Indiana

[Johnny:]
Way out west! 

[Bobby:]
And it seems that I can see... 

[Johnny:]
See what? 

[Bobby:]
The gleaming' candlelight... 

[Johnny:]
One watt. 

[Bobby:]
Still shinin' bright 
Through the sycamores for me. 
The new mown hay... 

[Johnny:]
Cut it yourself? 

[Bobby:]
Yeah... sends all its fragrance 
From the fields I use to roam. 

[Johnny:]
Roamin' in the gloamin'. 

[Bobby:]
When I dream about the moonlight on the Wabash 
then I long for my Indiana home. 

[Johnny:]
When the meadowlark 
Is singin' in the springtime... 

[Bobby:]
I want to sing a little swing. 

[Johnny:]
I got the key, just follow me. 
Scat sing. 

[Bobby:]
You mean? 
Scat sing. 

[Both:]
Scat sing. 

[Johnny:]
When things are peachy 
On the old Ogichee... 

[Bobby:]
Where the heck is that? 

When they start to shiver 
On the Hudson River... 

[Johnny:]
I know where that is! 

[Bobby:] Yeah! 

[Johnny:]
I dream of my Indiana... 

[Bobby:]
New York and Old Savannah... 

[Both:]
Dream of my Indiana home. 
Scat sing
