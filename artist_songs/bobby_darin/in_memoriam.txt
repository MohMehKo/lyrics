He's a ruthless opportunist 
And he motivates by greed 
He's just the way his father was 
And that we sure don't need 
So they all cried out destroy him 
For he wants to see us drowned 
They never understood him 
So they put him in the ground. 

Now some had stood for hours 
And some sat on the grass 
Listening to their radios 
For where the train had passed 
And a crowd will get impatient 
As the clock hands turn around 
They never understood him 
So they put him in the ground. 

They handed out some candles 
To the somber weary crowd 
And told us not to light them 
Till our eyes beheld the shroud 
Not even at that moment 
Could there be tranquility 
I could feel them push and argue 
Hey, sit down, I cannot see 
They never understood him 
So they put him in the ground. 

When the fathers closed their bibles 
And the family left the site 
The ropes and walls and hedges 
Kind of faded in the night 
Replaced by all the people 
Who made a prayerful sound 
They never understood him 
So they put him in the ground. 

Some people say the eighth of June 
But the morning of the ninth 
The workmen gently lowered him 
By the beam of three work lights 
Easy, take it easy 
Set him down real slow 
He'd been on some rougher trips 
But he couldn't tell them so 
They never understood him 
So they put him in the ground. 

Now no man has the answers 
And he was just a man 
And yet I can't help feelin' 
That he knew a better plan 
A shorter road to justice 
On the trip that's freedom bound 
But they never understood him 
So they put him in the ground.
