They all laughed at Christopher Columbus
When he said the world was round
They all laughed when Edison recorded sound

They all laughed at Wilbur and his brother
When they said that man could fly
They told Marconi wireless was a phony
It's the very same cry

They laughed at me wanting you
Said I was reaching for the moon
But oh, you came through
Now they'll have to change their tune

They all said we never could be happy
They laughed at us and how
But ho, ho, ho
Who's got the last laugh now?

They all laughed at Rockefeller Center
Now they're fighting to get in
They all laughed at Whitney and his cotton gin

They all laughed at Fulton and his steamboat
Hershey with his chocolate bar
Ford and his Lizzie kept the laughers busy
That's how folk are

They laughed at me wantin' you
Said it would be, "Hello, goodbye"
But oh, you came through
Now they're eating humble pie

Yeah, they all said we'd never get together
Baby, let's take a bow
For, ho, ho, ho
Who's got the last laugh?

Ha, ha, ha
Who belongs to that laugh?
He, he, he
Who's got the last laugh?
