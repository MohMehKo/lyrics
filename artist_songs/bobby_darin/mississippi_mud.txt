[Bobby:]
Hey, John, you evah been to Mississippi? 

[Johnny:]
No, man, but I sure would like to visit down there. 

[Bobby:]
You would? 
Well, I'll tell you what then, let us hop on a plane and went. 

[Johnny:]
O-kay, I hear it's very nice. 

[Bobby:]
It is, it is. 

[Johnny:]
When the sun goes down 
The tide goes out 
The people gather 'round 
And they all begin to shout. 

[Bobby:]
What? 

[Johnny:]
Hey, hey, Uncle Dud 
It's a treat to beat your feet 
On the Mississippi Mud. 
It's a treat to beat your feet 
On the Mississippi Mud. 

[Bobby:]
And what a dance do they do 
Lordy... how I'm tellin' you 
Why, they don't need no band 
They keep time by clappin their hand. 

[Both:]
Just as happy as a cow 
Chewin' on a cud 
When the people beat their feet 
On the Mississippi Mud. 

[Bobby:]
Lordy, how they play it 
Goodness, how they sway it 
There's Uncle George and cousin Jack 
Look at those fools peckin' on their back. 

[Johnny:]
What joy! 
That music thrills me. 

[Bobby:]
It do. 

[Johnny:]
Boy... it nearly kills me 
Sister Kate hollers, "Son!" 
You sure get muddy 
But, it's mighty good fun 

[Both:]
When the sun goes down 
The tide goes out 
The people gather round 
And they all begin to shout. 
Hey, Hey, Uncle Dud 
It's a treat to beat your feet 
On the Mississippi Mud 
It's a treat to beat your feet 
On the Mississippi Mud. 

[Bobby:]
What a dance do they do

[Both:]
Lordy... how I'm tellin' you 

[Johnny:]
They don't need no band 

[Bobby:]
They don't? 

[Johnny:]
They keep time by clappin' their hand

[Bobby:]
I see. 

[Johnny:]
Just as happy as a cow 
Chewing on a cud 
When the people beat their feet... 

[Bobby:]
Yeah! Yeah! 

[Johnny:]
And the people clap their hand 
On the M I double S I double S I double P I Mud. 

[Bobby:]
An "A" for spelling.
