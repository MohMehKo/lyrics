I live in a jingle jangle jungle 
If you ain't got it you can't be 
Fightin' over crumbs 
Wait till payday comes 
Gettin' green ink thumbs 
From countin' 
While it's mountin' 
In this jingle jangle jungle I call home. 

You live in a jingle jangle jungle 
If you can't earn it you ain't free 
Where a life is spent 
Tryin' to meet the rent 
Payin' back the cent 
You borrow 
Some tomorrow 
In this jingle jangle jungle you call home. 

We live in a jingle jangle jungle 
You're only worth what you can buy 
So keep on workin' hard 
To keep your own back yard 
Teach your kids that God 
Ain't fiction 
Contradiction 
In this jingle jangle jungle you call home. 

I live in a jingle jangle jungle 
If it don't jingle it's gonna fold 
All the things you own 
Are only here on loan 
It's by bread alone 
You're livin' 
Call this livin' 
In this jingle jangle jungle we call home. 

I live in a jingle jangle jungle 
Where people die to make some green 
Turnin' men to boys 
Makin' new war toys 
Dancin' to the noise 
Of ticker 
Can't get much sicker 
In this jingle jangle jungle we can home.
