Sunday 
Where has what you stood for gone 
Sunday 
Have you been asleep 
You say keep the faith but there's no faith to keep. 

Sunday 
Master of a dyin' breed 
Sunday 
Lyin' in a heap 
You say keep the faith but there's no faith to keep. 

Sunday 
Virgin child who can't wear white 
Sunday 
Much too late to weep 
You say keep the faith but there's no faith to keep. 

Sunday 
Tellin' lies on history 
Sunday 
Ain't you in too deep 
You say keep the faith but there's no faith to keep. 

Sunday 
Bow down to the blood you've shed 
Sunday 
Bodies piled so steep 
You say keep the faith but there's no faith to keep. 

Sunday 
Build your house of solid gold 
Sunday 
Let the people sleep 
You say keep the faith but there's no faith to keep. 
You say keep the faith but there's no faith to keep.
