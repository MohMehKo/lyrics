In old Savannah, I said Savannah
The weather there is nice and warm
The climate's of the Southern brand
But here's something I don't understand

Hey got 'em a gal there

A pretty, pretty gal there
Who's colder than an Arctic storm
Got a heart made like a stone
Even icemen leave her alone!

They call her Hard Hearted Hannah
Vamp of Savannah
The meanest gal in town
Leather is tough
But Hannah's heart is tougher
She's a gal who loves to see a man suffer!

Tease 'em, and thrill 'em
To torture and kill 'em
Is her delight, they say
Saw her at the seashore with a great big pan
There was Hannah pourin' water on a drownin' man!
She's Hard Hearted Hannah
The vamp of Savannah, G-A!

They call her Hard Hearted Hannah
Vamp of Savannah
The very meanest gal in town
You can talk about your cold, refrigeratin' mamas
She's the polar bear's pajamas!

Tease 'em, and thrill 'em, torture and kill 'em
Is her delight, they say
An evenin' spent with Hannah on your knees
Is like travelin' through Alaska in your B-V-Ds!
She's Hard Hearted Hannah...
Cold-blooded Hannah...
She's Hard Hearted Hannah
The vamp of Savannah, G-A!
