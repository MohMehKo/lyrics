Tell me how do you feel
When your baby's loving your best friend?
(I wanna know, I wanna know)
I said, how do you feel
When your baby's loving your best friend?
(I wanna know, I wanna know)

Yes, do you feel like going crazy
Or do you feel you've always been?
(I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know)

Hey, hey, tell me how how do you feel
When your baby crosses your mind?
(I wanna know, I wanna know)
Tell me how do you feel
When your baby crosses your mind?
(I wanna know, I wanna know)

Do you crack up with loud laughter?
Or do you break down and start crying?
(I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know)

Tell me how do you feel, partner
And I want the truth and not a lie
(I wanna know, I wanna know)
Yeah, how do you feel, partner
I want the truth and not a lie?
(I wanna know, I wanna know)

Because if you feel good on the inside
I must admit you're a better man than I
(I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know)

Oh, would you feel happy now
Or would you feel sad
When you lost the best girl
That you ever had?

I wanna know
(I wanna know)
I wanna know
(I wanna know)

I wanna know
(I wanna know)
I wanna know
(I wanna know)
I wanna know, yes, I wanna know
(I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know)

Would you feel happy now
Or would you feel sad
When you lost the best girl
That you ever had?

I wanna know
(I wanna know)
I wanna know
(I wanna know)

I wanna know
(I wanna know)
I wanna know
(I wanna know)
I wanna know, yes, I wanna know
(I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know)

It's alright
(It's alright)
It's alright
(It's alright)

It's alright
(It's alright)
It's alright
(It's alright)

It's alright
(It's alright)
It's alright
(It's alright)
