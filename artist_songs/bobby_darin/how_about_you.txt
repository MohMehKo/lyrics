I like New York in June
How about you?
I like a Gershwin tune
How about you?

I love a fireside 
When a storm is due 
I like potato chips an' moonlight an' motor trips
How about you?

I'm mad about good books
Can't get my fill
And Mr. Kennedy's looks
Give me a thrill.

Holdin' hands in a movie show
When all the lights are low
May not be new
But I like it...
How about you?

I like New Jersey in June
How about you?
An' I love me a Bernstein tune
How about you?

I-I-I love a TV set
When a storm is due
Ya know I like my fish an' chips, rock an' roll and filter tips
How about you?

I'm nuts about good cooks
Can never get my fill
And Mrs. Darin's looks
Kinda give me a thrill.

Holdin' hands in a movie show
All the way in the last row
May not be new
But I like it...
How about you?
