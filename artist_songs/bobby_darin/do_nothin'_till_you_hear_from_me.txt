Do nothin' till you hear from me
Pay no attention to what's said
Why have people tear the seam of anyone's dreams?
Is way over my head

Do nothin' till you hear from me
Atleast consider our romance
If you should take the word of [?] you've heard
I haven't a chance

True I've been seen with someone new
But does that mean that I'm untrue?
When we're apart the words in my heart
Reveal how I feel about you

Some kiss me, cloud my memory
And other arms may hold a thrill
Please do nothin' till you hear it from me
And you know you never will

True I've been seen with someone new
But does that mean that I'm untrue?
When we're apart the words in my heart
Reveal how I feel about you

Some kiss me, cloud my memory
And other arms may give me a thrill
Don't do nothin' till you hear it from me
And you never will
