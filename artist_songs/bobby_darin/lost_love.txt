I lost the love I needed
The love to make me strong

I left the love I needed
How could I be so wrong?

If I were only granted
The right to start anew
My love would be lost to you

Lost love behind me
True love won't find me
Because I'm so lost

For all the years I wasted
And all mistakes I made
For all the loves I tasted
How dearly I have paid

If I could be forgiven
For all the pain I caused?

Too late
My fate is lost

Lost love behind me
True love won't find me
Because I'm so lost
