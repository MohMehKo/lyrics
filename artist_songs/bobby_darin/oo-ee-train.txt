Ooh ooh wee 
Come on train carry me home
Ooh ooh wee
Come on train carry me home
I been too busy makin' money
To remember that my honey's alone.

Ooh ooh wee
Wheels won't you play me your sound
Ooh ooh wee
Wheels won't you play me your sound
I gotta get to my lover
So wheels you better cover ground.

Make the all aboard sound
Let the whistle scream
Let the lineman stoke 
Till it runs out of steam.  

Ooh ooh wee
Will my baby still remember my name?
If she's with somebody else
I only got myself to blame.

Ooh ooh wee
Come on train carry me home
Ooh ooh wee
Come on train carry me home
I been too busy makin' money
To remember that my honey's alone.

Ooh ooh wee...
Come on train have mercy on me...
