Moon River, wider than a mile,
I'm crossing you in style one day.
Old dream maker, you heart breaker,
Where ever you're going,
I'm going your way.

Two drifters, off to see the world.
There's such a lot of world to see.
We're after the same rainbow's end,
Waiting 'round the bend,
My huckleberry friend,
Moon River and me.
