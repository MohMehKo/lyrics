Just once in a lifetime
A man knows a moment
One wonderful moment
When fate takes his hand

And this is my moment
My once in a lifetime
When I can explore
A new and exciting land

For once in my lifetime
I feel like a giant
I soar like an eagle
As tho' I had wings

For this is my moment
My destiny calls me
And tho' it may be
Just once in my lifetime
I'm going to do great things
