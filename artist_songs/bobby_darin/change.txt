Whatever you've done it's all over 
Wherever you've been is so strange 
Yesterday's long gone forever 
Damned if what you're feelin' isn't change. 

Music that used to seem hollow 
Now seems to fit in your range 
Today is the now and the never 
Damned if what you're feelin' isn't change. 

It's fun to wander along a yesterday road 
trying so hard to retain 
All of the wondrous and beautiful times that 
never can happen again. 

So get yourself up off your past, friend 
There's so much to rearrange 
Tomorrow sits right next to never 
Damned if what your feelin' isn't change.
