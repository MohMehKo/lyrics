[Johnny:]
If I had my druthers 
I'd druther have my druthers 
Then anything else I know. 
While you'd druther hustle 
Accumulatin' muscle 
I'd druther watch daisies grow. 
While they're growin' slow an' 
The summer breeze is blowin' 
My heart is overflowin' and so. 
If I had my druthers 
I'd druther have my druthers 
Than anything else I know. 

Robert, you think you could agree with that kind of philosophy? 

[Bobby:]
Agree? I live it! 

If I had my druthers 
I'd druther have my druthers 
Then work any whereas at all. 

[Johnny:]
Don't nobody call. 

[Bobby:]
It ain't that I hates it 
Why, in fact, I even contemplates it 
While watchin' raindrops fall. 
I sits there for hours 
Developin' my powers 
Of figurin' how flowers gets tall. 
If I had my druthers 
I'd druther have my druthers 
Then anything else at all. 

[Johnny:]
If I had my druthers 
To choose from all the others 
I'd druther be like I am. 

[Bobby:]
I like you just the way you are. 

This thing called employment 
Detracts from my enjoyment 
And tightens my diaphragm. 

[Johnny:]
Oh, you poor lamb! 

Whilst I'm doin' nary 
A thing that's necessary 
I'm happy as a cherrystone clam. 

[Bobby:]
Some of my best friends are clams! 

If I had my druthers 
To choose from all the others 
I'd rather be like I am. 

[Both:]
If we had our druthers 
We'd rather have our druthers 
Than anything else we know. 
Our forefathers wrote it 
And often times we quote it 
Whenever we're feelin' low. 

[Bobby:]
Monsieur John? 

[Johnny:]
As direct descendants

[Bobby:]
We figure independence

[Both:]
Ain't only in Missouri and so. 
If we had our druthers 
We'd rather have our druthers 
Than anything else we know. 

[Johnny:]
Why sho'... 

[Both:]
Than anything else we know

[Bobby:]
Yebo'... 

[Both:]
Then anythin else we know
Enco' ... 
Than anything else we know. 

[Bobby:]
Goodnight. 

[Johnny:]
Leave a call.
