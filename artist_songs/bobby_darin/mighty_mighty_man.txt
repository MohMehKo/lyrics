Well, don't cha put your love on me so close tonight
I can feel it burnin' through your lips when [?]
Be awful careful baby when you touch-a my hand
Tonight I feel like a mighty mighty man

Got a passion down in my soul
A new kinda feeling that I cannot control
If you love-a me baby they you'll understand
Tonight I feel like a mighty mighty man

Mighty, goodness baby
Mighty as a man can be
Wella wella wella Mighty,
Like a Tarzan swingin in a tree

Well-a come a little closer let me be your friend
Saturday night and I just-a got-a paid
I'm gonna love-a you baby all that I can
Tonight I feel like a mighty mighty man

Well, mighty, goodness baby

Well come a little closer let me be your friend
Saturday night and I just-a got-a paid

Tonight I feel like a mighty mighty man
