Let me tell you 'bout a girl I know
She is my baby and she lived next door
Every mornin' 'fore the sun come up
She bring me coffee in my favorite cup

That's why I know, yes, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so

When I'm in trouble and I need me a friend
I know she stick with me until the end
Everybody asked me how I know
I smile and tell them say, "She told me so"

That's why I know, yes, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so

Now, if I call her on the telephone
And tell her, baby, I'm all alone
By the time I count from one to four
I hear her on my door

In the evenin' when the sun go down
And there ain't nobody else around
She kisses me and she hold me tight
Tell me, "Daddy, everything's alright"

That's why I know, yes, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so

Now, if I call her on the telephone
Tell her, baby, I'm so here alone
By the time I count from one up to four
I hear her on my door

In the evening when the sun go down
And there ain't nobody else around
She kisses me and hold me tight
Tell me, "Daddy, it's just right"

And I know, yes, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so
Hallelujah, I just love her so
Hallelujah, I just love her so

She's my woman, I wanna tell you
Hallelujah, I just love her so, yeah, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so
