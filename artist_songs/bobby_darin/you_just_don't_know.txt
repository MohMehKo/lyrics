You just don't know, little girl
How much I love you
You just don't know
The way I feel inside

I love you so, little girl
I just can't tell you 
You are my life
You're my love 
You're my pride

Before you came
My life was just routine
You taught me 
What a love could mean

You hurt me so, little girl
If you should leave me
I need you so, little girl
You just don't know

Sing it to me sweetly now

You hurt me so, little girl
If you should leave me
I need you so, little girl
You just don't know
