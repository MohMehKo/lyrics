You look to me
Like misty roses
Too soft to touch
But too lovely
To leave alone.

If I could be
Like misty roses
I'd love you much 
You're too lovely
To leave alone.

Flowers often cry
But too late to find
That their beauty has been lost
With their peace of mind.

You look to me
Like love forever
Too good to last 
But too lovely
Not to try.

If I believed
In love forever
I'd forget the past
Cause you're just too lovely
Not to try.

You're too lovely
Not to try 
Much too lovely
Not... to try...
