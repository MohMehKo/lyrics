I woke up this mornin' feelin'
Just as though my head were reelin'
Reelin' from a dream I had last night  

Then I turned and faced your pillow
Wept just like the weepin' willow
Seems like the dream I had was right

You were gone 
And the love I was givin' is 
And the reason for livin' is 
But the memory of your love lives on

Til the day that heaven calls me
No arms'll ever hold me
My love and happiness are gone

I sit here just thinkin' 'bout you
Wonderin' how I'll live without you
Tryin' to figure out what I did wrong   

But I guess it doesn't matter
If you found-a someone better
I'll be here when that someone is gone

Yes, you're gone 
And the love I was givin' is 
And the reason for livin' is 
But the memory of your love lives on

Til the day that heaven calls me
No arms'll ever hold me
My love and happiness are gone

Til the day that heaven calls me
No arms'll ever hold me
My love and happiness are gone

My love and happiness are gone 
My love and happiness are gone
