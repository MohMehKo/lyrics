Ah, hey there rolling river
On your way to sea
Won't you look for my true love
And send her on home to me?

Whistlin' winds, well, I beg of you
With all of the things that you see
Won't you look for my true love
And send her on home to me?

I've been trying for a long, long time
To find the one I adore
Mr. Wind keep looking over this land
Mr. River search every shore until you find her

Mr. Moon if you're listening
Won't you answer my plea?
Won't you look for my true love
And send her on home to me?

I've been trying for a long, long time
To find the one I adore
Mr. Wind keep looking over this land
Mr. River search every shore until you find her

Mr. Moon if you're listening
Won't you answer my plea?
Won't you look for my true love
And send her on home to me?

I wanna know, won't you look for my true love
And send her on home to me?
Please, tell me that you gonna look for my true love
And send her on home to me

I wanna hear you tell me
That you gonna look for my true, true love
And send her on home to me
One more now, won't you look for my true love
And send her on home to me?
