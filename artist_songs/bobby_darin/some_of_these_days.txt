Some of these days
You're gonna miss me, baby (Aw... play it, lips!)
Some of these days
You'll feel so lonely.

You're gonna miss my huggin' 
You'll miss my kissin'
You may even miss me, baby 
When I'm gone away.

You're gonna feel lonely
And want me only
'cause you know, honey
Kinda always had your way.

Say baby if ya leave me, oh yes oh yes...
You know it's gonna grieve me
You're gonna miss your boney little daddy
'cause one of these... YEAH!
Said some of these days (Aw... do it, Sophie!)
You're gonna miss me honey, huh...
And I'm talkin' about da-a-ays 
When you feel all lonely.

You're gonna miss my huggin'
You're gonna miss my kissin'
You may even miss me, honey
When I'm long gone away...

I hope you feel lonely
And want me only
'cause you know lover
Ya always had your way.

And if-a you-a-a leave me 
You know it's gonna grie-ee-ee-ve me
You'll miss-a your brown-eyed daddy (Grab it now!)
Some of these daaaaa-ays...
