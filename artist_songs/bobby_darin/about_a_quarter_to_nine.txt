One, two, three!

The stars
Are gonna twinkle and shine
This evenin'
'bout a quarter to nine

My lovin' arms
Are gonna tenderly twine
This evenin' around you
Quarter to nine

I know I won't be late
'cause at half past eight
I'll be waitin' there
I'll be waitin' where the lane begins
Waitin' for you on needles and pins

And then
The world is gonna be mine
This evenin'
'bout a quarter to nine

Get it!

Oh, the stars
Are gonna twinkle and shine
This very evenin'
'bout a quarter to nine

Both these lovin' arms
Are gonna tenderly twine
All around you
'round a quarter to nine 

I know I won't be late 
'cause at half-past eight
I will hurry there
I'm gonna be waitin' where the lane begins
Waitin' on you on needles and pins

And then 
This world is gonna be mine
This evenin'
'bout a quarter to nine!

Thank you
