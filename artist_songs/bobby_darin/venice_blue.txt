I saw Venice turn blue
Before my very eyes 
I saw Venice turn blue
The moment love died.      

I walked by the canal
Or through some little square
And echoes of her words
Pursue me everywhere.

Now my Venice is blue
As the mandolins play
The song she used to sing
Before love slipped away.

With the lovers hand in hand
The gondolas go by
I wish that I could weep
But all my tears are dry. 

I see Venice all blue
Before my misty eyes 
I see Venice all blue
Because our love has died.  

My aimless footsteps stop 
Before an old caf√© 
Or by some little shop 
Where she would often stray.  

I see Venice all blue  
Beneath the rising moon 
And still I look for her 
Beside the wide lagoon. 

And then I try to smile  
And hope I can forget 
The laughter that we shared 
The shining day we met.  

Two pigeons in the square  
I now say my goodbyes  
Goodbye my vanished dream 
Goodbye oh Bridge of Sighs. 

I've seen Venice turn blue  
And too lonely to bear 
For she...
Forgot to care.
