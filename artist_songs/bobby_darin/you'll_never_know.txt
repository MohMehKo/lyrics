You'll never know
Just how much I miss you
You'll never know
Just how much I care.

And if I tried
I still couldn't hide my love for you
You ought to know
For haven't I told you so
A million or more times.

You went away
And my heart went with you
I speak your name
In my ev'ry prayer.

If there is some other way
To prove that I love you
I swear I don't know how
You'll never know
If you don't know now.

If there is some other way
To prove that I love you
I swear I don't know how
You'll never know
If you don't know now.

You’ll never know...
You’ll never know...
