There are so many 
Fabulous faraway places to see
Such as Mexico, Sweden 
Hawaii, Japan and Capri
There's so many 

Exciting and wonderful places
Mountains and jungles and desert oases
Pleasant as home is
It isn't what Rome is...

So why stay there...

When there are so many 

Fabulous faraway places to see
Why should Spain and Tahiti and Rio 
Just be only names to you and me...

I feel certain there're people
We'd be glad to know there
So tell me why don't we 

Get up and just go there 
Go to those fabulous places...

Where we long to be... 
Like Bangkok and Hong Kong and Paris and Venice
Tokyo and Cairo and Lisbon and London
Wonderful fabulous places 
We're longin' to see.

There are so many
Simply incredible places to see
When I think of the warm Caribbean
I see a new world for you and me
I'd give anything just to have 

One single day there
And once we get there
I know that we'll stay there
Stay in those fabulous places...

Where we long to be...

Like Bangkok and Hong Kong and Paris and Venice
Tokyo and Cairo and Lisbon and London
Siam! Sienna! Vienna! Verona!
Java! Jamaica! Bombay! Barcelona!

Show me those fabulous... places...
We're longin' to see...
