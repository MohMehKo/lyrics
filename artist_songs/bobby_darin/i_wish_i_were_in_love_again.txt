Sleepless nights, daily fights
Quick toboggan when you reach the heights
I miss the kisses and I miss those bites
I wish I were in love again

Broken dates and the endless waits
Lovely loving with the hateful hates
Conversation with flying plates
I wish that I were in love again

No more care, no despair, I'm all there
You know I'd rather be punch drunk

Believe me sir, I much prefer
Classic battle between a him and a her
I dislike quiet and I wish I were
In love again, [?]

Furtive sigh, the blackened eye
The words, "I'm gonna love you 'til the day that I die"
The self deception that believes the lie
I wish that I were in love again

When love congeals, it soon reveals
The faint aroma of performing seals
Double crossing of a pair of heels
I wish that I were in love again

Hey, no more strain and I ain't feeling no pain
Today I'm sane but I would rather be punch drunk

Believe me sir, I much prefer
The classic battle of a him and a her
I can't stand quiet and I wish that I were
In love all over again
