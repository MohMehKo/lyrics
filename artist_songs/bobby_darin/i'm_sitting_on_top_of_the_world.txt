I'm sitting on top of the world,
Just rolling along
Just rolling along.

I'm quitting the blues of the world,
Just singing a song
Just singing a song.

Glory, hallelujah, I just phoned the parson,
"Hey, Par, get ready to call!"
Just like humpty dumpty
I'm ready to fall.

I'm sitting on top of the world,
Just rolling along
Just rolling along.

I'm quitting the blues of the world,
Just singing a song
Just singing a song.
