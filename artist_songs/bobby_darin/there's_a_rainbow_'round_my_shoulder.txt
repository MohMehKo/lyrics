There's a rainbow 'round my shoulder
And a sky of blue above
How the sun shines bright
The world's all right
'cause I'm in love.

There's a rainbow 'round my shoulder
And it fits me like a glove
Let it blow, let it storm
I'll be warm
'cause I'm in love.

Hallelujah... how the folks will stare
When they see the solitaire
That my little sugar baby is gonna wear.

There's a rainbow 'round my shoulder
And a sky of blue above
And, I'm shoutin' so
The world will know
That I'm in love.

Hallelujah... how the folks are gonna stare
When they see that diamond solitaire
That my own true baby's gonna wear.

There's a rainbow 'round my shoulder
And a sky of blue above
And, I'm shoutin' so...
So the world will know...
I'm in love...
I'm in love...

There's a rainbow 'round my shoulder
And I'm in love.
