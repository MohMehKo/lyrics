I didn't know what time it was
That I met you
Oh what a lovely time it was
How sumblime it was too
I didn't know what day it was
You held my hand
Warm like the month of may it was
And I'll say it was grand.
Grand to feel life, to be young, to be met, to be yours alone
Grand to see your face, feel your touch, hear your voice, say I'm all your own  

And I didn't know what year it was
Life was no prize
I wanted love and here it was
Shining out of your eyes
I'm wise and I know what time it is now

Grand to feel life, to be young, and met, and yours alone
Grand to see your face, feel your touch, hear you voice, say I'm  your own 

I didn't know what year it was
Life was no prize
I only wanted love and here it was
Shining out of your eyes
I'm wise and I know what time it is now
