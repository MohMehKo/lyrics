Now you're here
And now I know just where I'm goin'
No more doubts or fears
I've found my way.

For love came just in time
You found me just in time
And changed my lonely life
That lovely day.

Just in time
I found you just in time
Before you came my time
Was runnin' low.

I was lost
The losin' dice were tossed
My bridges all were crossed
Nowhere to go.

Now you're here
And now I know where I'm goin'
No more doubts or fears
I've found my way.

For love came just in time
You found me just in time
And changed my lonely life
That lovely day.

Now you're here
And now I know exactly where I'm goin'
No more doubts or fears
I have found my way.

For love came just in time
You found me just in time
You changed my lonely life
That lovely...
It will always be lovely
Lonely life that lovely day.
