Softly, I will leave you softly
For my heart would break
If you should wake
And see me go
So I leave you softly...

Long before you miss me
Long before your arms
Can beg me stay
For one more hour
Or one more day...

After all the years
I can't bear the tears to fall
So softly as I leave you there
As I leave you there
As I leave you there...

Softly... after all the years
I can't bear the tears to fall
So softly as I leave you there...

As I leave you there...
As I leave you there...

As I leave you there...
As I leave you there.
