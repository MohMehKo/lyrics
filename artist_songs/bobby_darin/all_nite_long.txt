If you see me comin', baby, lift your window high
If you see me comin', lift your window high
And if you see me going, hang your head and cry

You've got a wail, got to roll all nite long
Got to move, got to rock all nite long
Got to roll, got to reel-a all nite long
Got to reel like you feel-a all nite long

Got to love me, pretty baby, till the sun comes up at dawn
Baby, you're so beautiful but you're gonna cry one day
I said, "You're so beautiful but you're gonna cry one day"
You're gonna feel so bad for-a treating me this way-a

You've got a wail got to roll all nite long
Got to move, got to rock all nite long
Got to roll, got to reel-a all nite long
Got to reel what you feel-a all nite long

Got to love me pretty, baby
Till the sun comes up at dawn

Forget your blues, let your love come tumbling down
Forget your blues, let your love come tumbling down, down
Have you heard the news, big loving Daddy's in town?

You got to roll, got to rock all nite long
Got to move, got to wail-a all nite long
Got to roll, got to reel-a all nite long
Got to reel like you feel all nite long

Got to love me pretty baby
Till the sun comes up at dawn
You've got to love me pretty baby
Till the sun comes up at dawn

You've got to love me pretty baby
Till the sun comes up at dawn
You've got to love me pretty baby
Till the sun comes up at dawn
