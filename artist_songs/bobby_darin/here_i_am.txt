If you're lookin' for a new love
Here I am 
If you're searchin' for a true love
Here I am. 

I'll hold you day and night
I will never let you out of my sight 
If you're lookin' for a new love 
Here I am.

Have you ever been lonely
Have you ever, ever been blue
Does your heart need a someone
Who is kind, faithful and true.
If you're lookin' for that someone 
Here I am
If you're searchin' for an only one
Here I am.

I have never shared a true love
And I've-a never had me a real love
If you're lookin' for a good love
Here I am. 

If you're searchin' for a true love
Here I am...
Here I am...
