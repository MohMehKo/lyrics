I guess I'm good for nothing but the blues
A lonesome feeling that I just can't lose
When baby said she'd leave me, they walked right in to grieve me
Guess I'm good for nothing but the blues

I think I'll pack my things and go away
It's much too rough here so I shouldn't stay
The things around here haunt me, they're startin' in to haunt me
Guess I'm good for nothing but the blues

There isn't anyone who can help me
Not a single thing I can do
I just sit and moan waiting for the phone
To tell me she's coming back again

I wish my baby hurries home to me
Our love was somethin' wonderful to see
My empty arms are achin', I feel my poor heart breakin'
Guess I'm good for nothing but the blues
