How did I know that the warmth of the glow would last
And how did I guess that the long loneliness was past
I merely looked at you and I knew then and there I knew
It's you or no one for me

I'm sure of this every time we kiss
Now and forever when forever is done
You'll find that you are still the one

So please don't say no to my plea
'Cause if you do then I'm all through
There's this about you
My world's an empty world without you
It's you or no one for me

It's a matter of now and forever
When forever is all done
You'll find you are still the one

So please don't say no to my plea
'Cause if you do then I'm all through
There's this about you
My world's an empty world without you
It's you or no one for me

It's you or no one for me
It's you or no one for me
