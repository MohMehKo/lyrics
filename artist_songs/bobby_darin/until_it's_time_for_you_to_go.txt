You're not a dream
You're not an angel, you're a man
I'm not a queen
I'm a woman, take my hand

We'll make a space
In the lives that we'd planned
And here we'll stay
Until it's time for you to go

Yes, we're different worlds apart
We're not the same
We laughed and played
At the start like in a game

You could've stayed
Outside my heart but in you came
And here you'll stay
Until it's time for you to go

Don't ask why, don't ask how
Don't ask forever, love me now

This love of mine
Had no beginning, it has no end
I was an oak
Now I'm a willow, now I can bend

And though I'll never
In my life, see you again
Still I'll stay
Until it's time for you to go

Don't ask why, don't ask how
Don't ask forever, love me now

You're not a dream
You're not an angel, you're a man
I'm not a queen
I'm a woman, take my hand

We'll make a space
In the lives that we'd planned
And here we'll stay
Until it's time for you to go
