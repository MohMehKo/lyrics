Have dreamed about romance a lot
Men like Galahad and Sir Lancelot
Always did the things I'd like to do.

Physically I'm not as durable
But romantically I'm incurable
And I'd like to do the same for you...

Have ya got any castles
You want me to build, baby?
Have ya got any dragons
You wanna have killed, baby?

I'll get into my seven league boots
I'll get into my bulletproof suits
Get out my revolver that shoots
And rat-a-tat-tat... down they'll go.

Have ya got any mortgages
You wanna have paid, baby?
Have ya got any villains
That you wanna have laid to rest?

After all my adventures are through
And I bring home a dragon or two
You can tell all the papers
That I did it because... I love you.

Have ya got some castles
You want me to build, baby?
And maybe ya got a few dragons
You'd like to have killed, baby.

I'll get into my ivy league suit
Put on a pair of desert boots
With an ivy league suit 
Some desert boots...      

'kay, boy... you'll never get into westerns that way...

Ah... ya got some mortgages
You'd like to have paid, baby?
Maybe ya got some villains
You wanna have laid to rest?

After all my adventures are through
And I bring home a dragon or two
You can tell all the papers
That I did it 'cause... I love you... you.
