Goodbye... Charlie
Hate to see you go
Goodbye, Charlie
Gee... I'm feelin' low
But, I'm cluein' you in
Someone's doin' you in, pal.
Goodbye... Charlie
Hate to see you fade
My, my Charlie
Thought you had it made
But, they're dumpin' you off
After bumpin' you off, pal.
Don't you know lechery
Leads you to treachery
Things boomerang
Someone you trifle with
Pulls out a rifle without a pang
Bang... bang... bang!
Goodbye... Charlie
Cashin' in your chips
Wild-eyed Charlie
Time you came to grips
There ain't... no doubt...
Strike three... you're out...
Goodbye... Charlie
Goodbye!
Now don't you know lechery
Leads you to treachery
Things boomerang
Someone you trifle with
Pulls out a rifle without a pang
Bang... bang... bang!
Goodbye... Charlie
Cashin' in your chips
Wild-eyed Charlie
Time you came to grips
And, there ain't... no doubt...
Strike three... you're out...
Goodbye... Charlie
Goodbye!
