Night and stars above
That shine so bright
The mystery of their fading light
That shines upon our caravan

Sleep upon my shoulder
As we creep
Across the sand so I may keep
This memory of our caravan

This is so exciting
You, you're so inviting
Resting in my arms
As I thrill to the magic charms

Of you beside me here
Beneath the blue
My dream of love is coming true
Within our desert caravan

This is so exciting
You, you're so, so, so inviting
Resting here in my arms
As I thrill, thrill to the magic charms

Of you beside me here
Beneath the blue
My dream of love is coming true
Within our desert caravan
