The days of wine and roses laugh and run away
Like a child at play
Through a meadowland toward a closing door
A door marked nevermore that wasn't there before

The lonely night discloses just a passing breeze
Filled with memories
Of the golden smile that introduced me to
The days of wine and roses and you
