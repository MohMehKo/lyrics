Something in your smile speaks to me
Something in your eyes shows me the way
And helps me to say the things
That I could never say to you

Something in your voice sings to me
Something in your laugh makes me rejoice
And there is no choice except 
To let my thoughts all stray to you
And stray to you they do

Something in you is rich and rare
And there is something more
Something in you is everything
I've never known before

Something of your charm clings to me
Something of your warmth has stayed in my heart 
And made me a part of you for just a little while
So think of me as something in your smile
Please think of me as something in your smile
