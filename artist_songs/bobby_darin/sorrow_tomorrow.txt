Sorrow, tomorrow
Sorrow, tomorrow...

Makin' eyes at all the guys 
While you dance with me          
I must be blind to love your kind 
'cause it's so plain to see...

If I should love you 
For more than tonight... 

There would be sorrow
There would be heartache
There would be sorrow, tomorrow.

Havin' fun with anyone 
Livin' for today
My achin' heart is torn apart
I just can't live that way...

If I should love you 
For more than tonight... 

There would be sorrow
There would be heartache
There would be sorrow, tomorrow. 

Trouble's waitin' just around the corner
Heartache's waitin' just around the bend
I don't want to think about tomorrow
'cause tomorrow my happiness could end. 

I asked my pride to step aside 
I know this love's so wrong
Can't stand the pain 
Of lovin' in vain it's not where I belong...

If I should love you 
For more than tonight...

There would be sorrow
There would be heartache
There would be sorrow, tomorrow.

You believe me... 
There would be sorrow
There would be heartache
There would be sorrow, tomorrow...

I know... you know
That there would be... sorrow
There would be... heartache
There would be sorrow, tomorrow.
