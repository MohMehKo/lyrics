When day is done
The shadows fall
I dream of you
When day is done
I think of all the joys we knew

That yearning, returning
To hold you in my arms
Won't go love
I know love 
Without you night has lost its charms

When day is done
An' grass is wet with twilight's dew
My lonely heart is sinking with the sun
Although I miss your tender kiss
The whole day through
I miss you most of all
When day is done

When day's all done
An' grass is wet with twilight's dew
My lonely heart is sinking with the sun
Although I miss your tender kiss
The whole day through
I miss you most of all
When day is done
