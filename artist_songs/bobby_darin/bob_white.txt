[Bobby:]
Just listen to the Bob White 
He never could sing right. 

[Johnny:]
You should hip him to the latest sound 
And the talk that's goin' 'round. 

[Bobby:]
Well, I was talkin' to the parakeet 
And he said, "Man, now about that beat?" 

[Johnny:]
How about that beat? 

[Bobby:]
Hey, Bob White 
Ain't ya gonna swing tonight? 

[Johnny:]
Several people heard the albatross

[Bobby:]
Yes. 

[Johnny:]
Whisper Robert is on the sauce

[Bobby:]
I know for a fact he's on the wagon. 

[Johnny:]
Bob White 
Nothing but a neophyte. 

[Bobby:]
John, what does that word mean? 

[Johnny:]
Amateur! 

[Bobby:]
Even the pheasant 
Found it unpleasant 
Hearin' you hit that flat note. 

[Johnny:]
Whereas the sparrow 
Froze to his marrow 
When he heard that note. 

[Bobby:]
The opinion of the tufted grouse 
Is you'll play to an empty house. 

[Johnny:]
Could happen to anybody! 

[Bobby:]
Sure could. 

[Both:]
Get up off that pad 
Shape up make it, Dad 
Bob White 
You gotta sing it out tonight. 

[Johnny:]
Take a letter to the meadow lark 
In reply to his rude remark

[Bobby:]
Well, the mails must go through. 

[Johnny:]
Bob White 
Invites you to a bash tonight. 

[Bobby:]
My tux isn't even pressed! 

Take a wire to the nightingale 
Tell him Bob ain't begun to wail 
Bob White's 
Gonna put him down for spite. 

[Johnny:]
Circulate the word! 

Call up the catbird 
Tell that old fat bird 
He's gonna sing a storm up. 

[Bobby:]
Hip the canary 
It'll be scary 
After the warm up. 

[Johnny:]
Man, he's even gonna gas the goose 
He'll be looser than Dr. Seuss

[Bobby:]
Wait a minute, John, do I detect a note of meaning that he's gonna be right in tune? 

[Johnny:]
Man, I'm tellin' ya... he's gonna be on the moon! 

[Bobby:]
I see. 

[Both:]
Bob White 
He's gonna ball it up tonight. 

[Johnny:]
Oh, he's in there. 

[Bobby:]
Ah, he whistles pretty. 

[Johnny:]
Yeah, like a bird! 

[Bobby:]
What?! 

[Johnny:]
Hear the wire from the albatross

[Bobby:]
Sounds urgent! 

[Johnny:]
It reads Robert is still the boss

[Bobby:]
Well, thank you very much, folks. 

[Johnny:]
Bob White 
He was in the grove tonight. 

[Bobby:]
I quote directly from the whoopin' crane 
He says, "Man it was like insane." 

[Johnny:]
He made it plain

[Bobby:]
Bob White 
Reelin' for a groovy fight 

I thought I had him dead in the third round. 

[Johnny:]
Hey, old papa redbird 
Who is the head bird 
Says you were in there swingin' 

[Bobby:]
He was tryin'. 

Even a jackdaw 
Flew out the back door 
Buckin' and wingin'. 

[Johnny:]
You instigated such a swingin' gig 
That all them quadrupeds wanna dig. 

[Bobby:]
Here, here, you mean... 

[Johnny:]
Here come the moose and elk! 

[Bobby:]
There goes Lawrence Welk! 

[Both:]
Bob White! Bob White! Bob White! 
You really sang it out tonight! 

[Bobby:]
Ah, it's for the birds.
