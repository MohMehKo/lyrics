Though you vacation in Hawaii 
Or go to Switzerland to ski 
When you're scanning the snow covered mountain 
Or fanning yourself by the sea 
Don't dream of anybody but me

Though you may fly the Scottish Highlands 
Or take a trip to some isle near Napoli 
When you're whistling "The Campbells Are Coming" 
Or humming "The Isle Of Capri" 
Don't dream of anybody but me

In a cafe on the Rhine 
Any place along the line 
I'll forgive you when a stranger puts your little heart in danger 
If his face resembles mine

When a guy at a mike in a nightclub 
Begins bellowing something off-key 
Won't even mind if suddenly he reminds you of me

No matter where you care to roam 
Doesn't even matter whom you choose to see 
Whenever your head hits that pillow 
Whatever the hour may be 
Don't dream of anybody but me 
Don't dream of anybody but me 
Don't dream of anybody but me
