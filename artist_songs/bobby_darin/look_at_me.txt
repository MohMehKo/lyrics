Look at me 
This at least you owe me
Just a glance to show me
That you really care

Look at me
Pride is taken from me
And tears just don't become me
But they're always there

Just one look
One look will do
That's all it took
To make me fall in love with you

Please turn around
I'll be looking for you
Waiting to adore you
Baby, look at me

Just one look
One look will do
That's all it took
To make me fall in love with you

So turn around
I'll be looking for you
Waiting to adore you
Baby, look at me
