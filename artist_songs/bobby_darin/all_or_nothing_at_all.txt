All or nothing at all 
Half a love just never appealed to me
If your heart never could yield to me 
Then I'd rather have nothing at all
Aw, give me your all or nothing at all
If it's love there is no in between
Why begin then cry for something that might have been
No, I'd rather have nothing at all
But please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't you smile or I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes 
The touch of your hand makes me weak 
And my heart may grow dizzy and fall
And if I fell under the spell of your call
I would be caught in the undertow
So you see, I gotta say no, no
All or nothing at all
Or nothing at all
Give me all of your all
