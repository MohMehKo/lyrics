There are sad things
There are bad things, the blues
When they threaten 
Start betting you'll lose

You hide yourself behind a prayer
The blues'll come and they'll find you there
I mean the blues, they call Pete Kelly's Blues

There's no exit
You can try the blues
If you're born with,
You will die with the blues
Think what you choose
That happy dream is yours they say
If you can pay the dues
That's why I'm stuck with,
Fresh outta luck with the blues

There's no exit
None you can try with the blues
See if you're born with,
You gotta die with the blues
Think what you choose
That happy dream is yours they say
If you can pay the dues
That's why I'm stuck with,
So outta luck wit the blues

Some call em Pete Kelly's Blues
You can em anything you choose
I call them blues
