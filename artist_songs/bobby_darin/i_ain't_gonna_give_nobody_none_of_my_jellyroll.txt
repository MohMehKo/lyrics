[Johnny:]
I ain't gonna give nobody none of my jellyroll... 

[Bobby:]
How 'bout your short'ning bread? 

[Johnny:]
Oh, I wouldn't give you a piece a pie to save your soul... 

[Bobby:]
I guess that's what you said. 

[Johnny:]
My ma told me today 
When she went away... 

[Bobby:]
To buy groceries. 

[Johnny:]
To be a good boy 
She'd give me a toy 
'cause I'm my mama's 
Pride and joy. 

There ain't no use of anyone to keep a hangin' 'round... 

[Bobby:]
Maybe I'm waiting' on your ma. 

[Johnny:]
You don't know my ma 
She'd really put you down... 

[Bobby:]
Put me down? 

[Johnny:]
Ma's bakin' up a storm 
And her oven is still warm. 
I know you want it 
But you can't have it 
And I ain't gonna give you none. 

[Bobby:]
You dirty boy! 

I ain't gonna give nobody none of my jellyroll... 

[Johnny:]
Oh... such a stingy chap! 

[Bobby:]
I wouldn't give you a piece a pie to save your soul... 

[Johnny:]
How 'bout a zuzu snap? 

[Bobby:]
Her cherry pie is fine 
Her layer cake divine. 
But I'm tellin' you twice 
You can't get a slice 
Unless you're extra special nice. 

Now, there ain't no use of you to just keep a hangin' 'round... 

[Johnny:]
Oh... pretty please! 

[Bobby:]
I love you but I hate to put you down 
Yeah... my jellyroll is sweet... 

[Johnny:]
That it is! 

[Bobby:]
It sure is hard to beat 
Well, I know they want it... 

[Johnny:]
But, they can't have it... 

[Both:]
Whoa, Miss Nelly, I need my jellyroll! 

[Johnny:]
Dibs on the dishpan. 

[Bobby:]
I got seconds.
