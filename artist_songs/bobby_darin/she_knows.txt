Soft music crowd overflows
Strange faces and party time clothes
Some dance but I’m not one to tango 
She knows

Part of the picture is making the scene
But making a cool pistachio dream
She knows I’m no Sunday smoker, no sir

Putin’ on a show 
Keep with time with one another
Stepin’ in between the broken lines
As anyone can see 
No, she wouldn’t go so low with me
if she didn’t know what’s on my mind
As if she didn’t know

My pleasure, feelin’ at home
Knowin’ she’s near me, we’re finally alone
That’s me and that’s the me that she knows 
She knows

Hey hey hey hey

My pleasure, feelin’ at home
Knowin’ she’s near me, we’re finally alone
That’s me and that’s the me that she knows 
She knows

There’ll be good days, there’ll be bad days
There’ll be days she needs a comforting words
