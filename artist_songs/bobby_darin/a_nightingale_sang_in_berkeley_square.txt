That certain night
The night we met
There was magic abroad in the air
There were angels dinin’ at the Ritz
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley Square.

I may be right
May be wrong
But I’m perfectly willing to swear
That when you turned and smiled at me
A nightingale sang in Berkeley Square.

The moon that lingered over London town
Poor, puzzled moon
He wore a frown
How could he know we two were so in love
The whole darn world seemed upside-down.

The streets uptown were paved with stars
It was such a romantic affair
And as we kissed
And said good night
A nightingale sang in Berkeley Square.

How strange it was
How sweet and strange
There was never a dream to compare
With that hazy, crazy night we met
When a nightingale sang in Berkeley Square.

Ah, this heart of mine
It beat loud and fast
Like a merry-go-round in a fair
For we were dancin’ cheek to cheek
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley Square.

When dawn came stealin’ up all gold and blue
To interrupt our rendezvous
I still remember how you smiled and said,
Was that a dream
Or was it true?

Our homeward step was just as light
As the dancin’ feet of Astaire
And just like an echo far away
A nightingale sang in Berkeley..
A nightingale sang in Berkeley..
That night in Berkeley Square.
