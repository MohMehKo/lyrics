I'm here in a crowd, so noisy and loud
And suddenly there isn't a sound
'Cause she just walked in with her funny little grin
Now there's nobody else around

She's everything I told you
And much more as well
There's only one little item
That I forget to tell

She's everything I ever wanted
Everything I'll ever need
There's only one little item
To which I must conceive

When she nears me, how she cheers me
Her eyes, so warm and so gay
But what can all this matter to me
Those eyes aren't looking my way

She's everything I told you
I swear by stars above
There's only one little item
I'm not the guy she wants
