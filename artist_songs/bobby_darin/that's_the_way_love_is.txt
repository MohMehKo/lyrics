You're feeling low and oh so small 
Then suddenly you're eight feet tall 
She just walked in the room 
And the gloomy room just glows 
That's the way love is 
That's how it goes

You're such a drag from nine 'til five 
Then all at once you're so alive 
It's just the way she winks her eye 
Or wrinkles her nose 
That's the way love is 
That's how it goes

It's the world's oldest unsolved riddle 
The kind of game you just can't win 
And if you come up with the answer 
You're a better man sir, than I, Gunga Din

So when that tingle hits you deep 
And you're tired but you just can't sleep 
Don't you take my word 
Go and ask anyone who knows 
That's the way love is 
That's how it goes

It's the world's oldest unsolved riddle

And you're tired you don't sleep 
Don't you take my word 
Go and ask anyone who knows 
That's the way love is 
That's how it goes 
That's how it goes 
That's how it goes
