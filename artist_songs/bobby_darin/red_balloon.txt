Bought myself a red balloon
Got a blue surprise
Hidden in the red balloon
The pinnin' of my eyes
Took a love light from my eyes
Blue, blue surprise

We met as friends
You were so easy to get to know
Will we see one other again
Oh, my, I hope so

Bought myself a red balloon
Got a blue surprise
Hidden in the red balloon
The pinnin' of my eyes

Playin' 'round with children's toys
As a child I got 
Haven't time for children's toys
Though I have a lot

Bought myself a red balloon
Got a blue surprise
Hidden in the red balloon
The pinnin' of my eyes
