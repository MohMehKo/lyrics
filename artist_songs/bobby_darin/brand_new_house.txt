I wanna brand new house with an old brown jug
And an old spinnin' wheel on an old hook rug
For my brand new house and my brand new bride
With lotsa lovin' locked inside

I'm gonna bolt all the windows and lock up the door
I'm gonna love ya, baby, like never before
In my brand new house with my brand new bride
And lotsa lovin' locked inside

I wanna grandfather clock and an easy chair
With a mother Hubbard cupboard that'll never be bare
My brand new house with my brand new bride
And lotsa lovin' locked inside

I'm gonna draw all the curtains and pull all the drapes
To make sure none of our lovin' escapes
From a brand new house with my brand new bride
And lotsa lovin' locked inside

And when the landlord comes to call
There won't be no one here at all
And when I hear the ringin' of the phone
I'll pick it up and say, 'We ain't home'

Don't wanna fancy car, don't need no furs
Just wanna a pair of towels marked his and hers
For my brand new house with my brand new bride
And lotsa lovin' locked inside

I don't know where I'm goin', don't know where I've been
I don't wanna a house with the world creepin' in
To my brand new house with my brand new bride
And lotsa lovin' locked inside

Lotsa lovin' locked inside so much lovin' child
Lotsa lovin' locked inside
One more time
Lotsa lovin' locked inside
