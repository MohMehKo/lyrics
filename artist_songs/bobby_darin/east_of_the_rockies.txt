[Johnny:]
I left my baby east of the Rockies 
North of the Rio Grande 
West of M'sippi 
South of Dakota land. 
When you hit Texas 
Take Route 33 
Turn right at Dreamy Valley 
Left at Lover's Alley 
Standin' 'neath the apple tree. 

I'll make a little trip for my uncle 
But, I'll return I know 
And I'll remember 
Just where I has to go. 
East of the Rockies 
North of the Rio Grande 
West of M'sippi 
South of Dakota land. 
Just think of Texas 
Route 33 
Dreamy Valley 
Lover's Alley 
Stop and see the apple tree 
Find my baby waitin' there for me. 

[Bobby:]
I left my baby east of the Rockies 
North of the Rio Grande 
West of Missouri 
South of Dakota land. 
When you hit upon Texas 
Take Route 33 
Turn right at Dreamy Valley 
Left at Lover's Alley 
Standin' 'neath the apple tree. 

My boat is shovin' off and I'm sailin' 
But, I'll return I know 
And I'll remember 
Just where I have to go. 
East of the Rockies 
North of the Rio Grande 
Hey, west of M'sippi 
South of Dakota land 
Just think a Texas 
Route 33 
Dreamy Valley 
Lover's Alley 
Stop and see the apple tree. 

[Both:]
I'll find my baby waitin' 
I ain't procrastinatin' 
My baby's waitin' there for me.
