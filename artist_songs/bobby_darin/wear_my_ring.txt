Wear my ring on your finger
Wear my love within your heart
And say you'll always be as much in love with me
As at the start

Oh yes, wear my ring on your finger
And make this solemn vow
That you will always be as much in love with me
As you are now

And when we're old and we're gray
We will still have this day
To remember when December comes in May

(Won't you) wear my ring on your finger
Proving that love is ours to share
You're mine to have and hold
Just like this ring of gold you wear
