Up in the mornin', out on the job
Work like the devil for my pay
But that lucky old sun has nothin' to do
But roll around Heaven all day

Fuss with my woman, toil for my kids
Sweat 'till I'm wrinkled and gray
While that lucky old sun has nothin' to do
But roll around Heaven all day

Good Lord above, don't you know I'm pinin'?
Tears are in my eyes
Send down that cloud with a silver linin' 
Lift me to Paradise

Show, show me that river, take me across
And wash all my troubles away
Like that lucky old sun give me nothin' to do
But roll around Heaven all day

Show me that river, please, take me across
And wash all my troubles away
Like that lucky old sun give me nothin' to do
But roll around Heaven all day
