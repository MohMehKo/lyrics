I guess I'll have to change my plan 
I should have realized there'd be another man 
I overlooked that point completely 
Until the big affair began

Before I knew where I was at 
I found myself on a shelf 
And that was that

I tried to reach the moon 
But when I got there 
All that I could get was the air 
My feet are back upon the ground 
I lost the one girl I'd found

Before I knew where I was at 
I found myself hung up on a shelf 
And that was that

I tried to reach for the moon 
But you know when I got there 
All that I could get was the air 
My feet have returned the ground 
I lost the one girl 
I lost the one girl 
Lost me the one girl I had found
