When I was little, my mama said to me
Someday you'll find a love to last eternally
I want you with me
Everywhere I go...
Please don't leave me
You know I love you so.
I'll be the ruler of this whole wide world
If you'll only say you'll be my girl
I want you with me
In everything I do...
You know I need you baby
You know I'm in love with you.
There is no mountain that I can't climb
Find me the mountain, child, I'll find the time
I want you with me
Every day of my life...
You know you can make me happy
Baby, won't you be my wife.
I'll swim an ocean with a ragin' foam
If I know you'll be there when I come back home
I want you with me
You know I love you so...
Yes, I want you with me baby
Everywhere I go
You know, you know, I want you with me
Yeah, yeah... I love you so...
Well, I want you with me baby
Everywhere I go.
