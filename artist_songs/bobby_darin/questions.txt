How do you kill a mountain 
How do you make it fall 
Well you chip away 
Every day 
And soon the clay 
Will fade away 
And the hole you've dug 
In the dream you hug 
Will be like a bug 
In your ear 
Can't you hear. 

How do you kill the sunshine 
How do you turn it out 
Well you close your eyes 
To the cries 
And the lies 
In the law's disguise 
And the light will fade 
In the evenin' shade 
Which is only made 
By the sun 
Are you dumb. 

How do you kill the ocean 
How do you make it dry 
Well you first dilute 
Then pollute 
Cut the fruit 
At the root 
And the ocean's floor 
Will be like a whore 
Who will lie no more 
'cause she's dead 
Use your head. 

How do you kill the country 
How does she disappear 
Well you trade your tent 
In for rent 
That will be spent 
On poured cement 
And the things that grew 
When the earth was new 
Which have nurtured you 
Will be gone 
Blow your horn. 

How do you kill an idea?
