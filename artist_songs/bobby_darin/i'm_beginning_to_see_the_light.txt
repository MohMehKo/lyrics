I never cared much for moonlit skies,
Never winked back at fireflies,
But now that the stars are in your eyes
I'm beginning to see the light.

I never went in for afterglow,
Or candlelight on the mistletoe,
But now when you turn the lamp down low
I'm beginning to see the light.

I used to ramble through the park
Shadow boxing in the dark
Then you came and caused the spark
That's a four-alarm fire, now.

I never made love by lantern shine,
I never saw rainbows in my wine,
But now that your lips are burning mine
I'm beginning to see the light.

I never cared much for moonlit skies,
I never winked back at fireflies,
But now that the stars are in your eyes
I'm beginning to see the light.

I never went in for afterglow,
Or candlelight on the mistletoe,
But now when you turn the lamp down low
I'm beginning to see the light.

You know I used to ramble through the park
Shadow boxing in the dark
Then you came and lit that spark
That's a four-alarm fire, now

I never made love by lantern shine,
I never saw rainbows in my wine,
But now that your lips are burning mine
I'm beginning to see the light.
