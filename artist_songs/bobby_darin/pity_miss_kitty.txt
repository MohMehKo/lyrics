Pity, pity, pity Miss Kitty
Have a little mercy on me
Well, pity, pity, pity, Miss Kitty
Won't you set my poor heart free?
You know Johnny B. Goode and Zorro, too
Can't love you any more than I do

Pity, pity, pity Miss Kitty
Didn't I buy you new shoes?
Well a, well a, well a
Pity, pity, pity Miss Kitty
I even paid your dues
Be my Kewpie doll, return to me
We'll be as happy as we can be

Won't you wear my ring around your neck
We'll be walkin' down the aisle, never lookin' back
For your precious love I'd swim the sea
I'd give up Skinny Minnie and her sister Jennie Lee

Well, pity, pity, pity Miss Kitty
How long are you gonna make me wait?
Well a, well a, well a
Pity, pity, pity Miss Kitty
All you gotta do is name the day
I'm in endless sleep, oh lonesome me
Come on Kitty, have pity on me

Oh, won't you wear my ring around your neck
We'll be walkin' down the aisle, never lookin' back
For your precious love I'd swim the sea
I'd give up Skinny Minnie and her sister Jennie Lee

Well, pity, pity, pity Miss Kitty
How long are you gonna make me wait?
Well a, well a, well a
Pity, pity, pity Miss Kitty
All you gotta do is name the day
I'm in endless sleep, oh lonesome me
Come on Kitty, have pity on me

Come on Kitty, have pity on me
Come on Kitty, have pity on me
Come on Kitty, have pity on me
