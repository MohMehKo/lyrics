Dear heart...
Wish you were here to warm this night
My dear heart...
Seems like a year
Since you've been out of my sight. 

A single room...
A table for one
It's a lonesome town all right.

But soon I'll kiss you hello
At our front door
And dear heart...
I want you to know
I'll leave your arms, nevermore.

But soon I'll kiss you hello
