Gonna tell the whole world about
Gonna stand right up and shout
Gonna tell the whole world how I feel about you
'Cause you know how
How to treat me right
How to hold me tight
And when I'm-a feelin' bad
Know how to make me glad     

Of all the girls that I've known and I've known some 
When you're away babe, I'm so lonesome for you
I say you
I mean you.

Let me tell you 'bout it!
I've been in love with you since you were ten
And if I had to live my life again
Oh baby, I'd still be in love with you
'Cause you know how
How to treat me right
How to hold me tight
And when I'm-a feelin' bad
Know how to make me glad

Of all the girls that I've known and I've known some
When you're away babe, I'm so lonesome for you
I say you
I mean you.

Talk about it now!
'Cause you know how
Oh, how to treat me right       
How to hold me tight
And when I'm-a feelin' bad
You know how to make me glad     

Of all the girls that I've known and I've known some
When you're away babe, I'm so lonesome for you
I mean you
I say you.
Talk to me now...
