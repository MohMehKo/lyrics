It brings a tear into my eyes
When I begin to realize
I've cried so much since you've been gone
I guess I'll drown in my own tears

I'm gonna sit and cry just like a child
My pourin' tears, they're runnin' wild
If you don't think you'll be home soon
I'm gonna drown in my own tears

I know it's true
Into each life some rain must pour
But I'm so blue every night without you
It keeps on rainin' more and more

Why can't you come on home?
So that I won't have to be all alone
If you don't think that you'll be home soon

I guess I'll
(Drown in my own tears)
Oh, don't let me now
(Drown in my own tears)

When I'm in trouble
(Drown in my own tears)
Looks like I'll drown in my own tears
