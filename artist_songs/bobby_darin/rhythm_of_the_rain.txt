Listen to the rhythm of the falling rain
Telling me just what a fool I've been
I wish that it would go and let me cry in vain
And let me be alone again

The only girl I care about has gone away
Looking for a brand new start
But little does she know that when she left that day
Along with her she took my heart

Listen to the rhythm of the falling rain
Telling me just what a fool I've been
I wish that it would go and let me cry in vain
And let me be alone again

Now rain please tell me does that seem fair
For her to steal my heart away when she don't care
I can't love another when my heart's
Somewhere far away

The only one I ever cared about has gone away
Looking for a brand new start
But little does she know that when she left that day
Along with her she took my heart

Listen to the rhythm of the falling rain
Telling me just what a fool I've been
I wish that it would go and let me cry in vain
And let me be alone again
