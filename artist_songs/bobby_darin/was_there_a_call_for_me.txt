Was there a call for me
I had to talk to someone
Waiting for days is driving me crazy
Was there a call for me

When lovers disagree
All of your dreams come undone
I am not denying, it got me crying
Was there a call for me

My lips are growing cold
My two arms long to hold
And thanks to you my story is told

By the way, once again I'm saying, "Was there a call for me"
Unfriendly clouds give warning
Here comes the dawning, cold rainy morning
Was there a call from me

Here comes the dawning, cold rainy morning
Was there a cold for me
Filled with the mist of tears I've resist
Tell me, was there a call for me
