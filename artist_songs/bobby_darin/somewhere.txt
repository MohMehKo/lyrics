Somewhere beyond the sea
Somewhere, waiting for me
My lover stands on golden sands
And watches the ships that go sailing

Somewhere beyond the sea
He's
(She's)
There watching for me

If I could fly like birds on high
Then straight to his
(Her)
Arms I'd go sailing

It's far beyond, a star
It's near beyond the moon
I know beyond a doubt
My heart will lead me there soon

We'll meet beyond the shore
We'll kiss just as before
Happy we'll be, beyond the sea
And never again I'll go sailing
