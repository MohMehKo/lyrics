I cannot make it, girl, through the day 
Ah babe, but I can see the wind 
I cannot seem to make my way 
Ah babe, but I can see the wind. 

Float in smoke, let it father me 
Ah babe, but I can see the wind 
What man is doin' doesn't bother me 
Ah babe, 'cause I can see the wind. 

I do not seem to hear myself 
Ah babe, but I can see the wind 
I am a part of somethin' else 
Ah babe, but I can see the wind. 

Shadowed clouds may smother men 
Ah babe, but I can see the wind 
Letting out the other me 
Ah babe, but I can see the wind. 

The space around me isn't any more 
Ah babe, but I can see the wind 
I think I'm standing' but there is no floor 
Ah babe, but I can see the wind. 

I can see the wind 
I can see the wind 
I can see the wind 
I can see the wind 
I can see the wind 
I can see the wind 
I can see the wind
