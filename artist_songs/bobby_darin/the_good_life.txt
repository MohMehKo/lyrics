Oh, the good life, full of fun
Seems to be the ideal
Yes, the good life let's you hide
All the sadness you feel

You won't really fall in love
For you can't take the chance
So be honest with yourself
Don't try to fake romance

It's the good life
To be free and explore the unknown
Like the heartaches
When you learn you must face them alone

Please remember, I still love you
And in case you don't know
Well, just wake up
Kiss the good life "hel-lo"
