Jailer, bring me water 
Jailer, bring me water 
Jailer, bring me water 
My throat is kind-a dry. 
Well, I never had me no money 
Never had me no money 
Never had me no money 
I ain't that kind-a guy. 

Oh, jailer, bring me water 
Jailer, bring me water 
Jailer, bring me water 
My throat is kind-a dry 

I'm gonna work 'til the good Lord calls me 
Be workin' 'til the good Lord calls me 
I'm gonna work until the good Lord calls me 
It'll be in the by and by. 

Oh, jailer, bring me water 
Jailer, bring me water 
Jailer, bring me water 
My throat is kind-a dry. 

Now, jailer, should ya see my baby 
Jailer, if ya see my baby 
Jailer, if ya see my baby 
Just tell her I said, "Good-bye." 

Everybody singin' 

Jailer, 
Jailer, bring me water 
Come on jailer, bring me 
Jailer, bring me water 
Come on jailer, bring me 
Jailer, bring me water 
Come on jailer, bring me 
My throat is kind-a dry. 

Ah, jailer, won't ya bring me some... 
Bring me water 
Jailer, won't ya bring me some... 
Bring me water 
Jailer, won't ya bring me water 
My throat is kind-a dry.
