They say the neon lights are bright
On Broadway
They say there's always magic in the air
But when you're walkin' down that street
And you ain't got enough to eat
The glitter rubs right off and you're nowhere
They say the chicks are somethin' else
On Broadway
But lookin' at them just gives me the blues
'Cause how ya gonna make some time
When all you got is one thin dime
And one thin dime won't even shine your shoes
They say that I won't last too long
On Broadway
I'll catch a Greyhound bus for home they all say
But they're dead wrong, I know they are
'Cause I can play this here guitar
And I won't quit till I'm a star
On Broadway
But they're dead wrong, I know they are
'Cause I can play this here guitar
And I won't quit till I'm a star
On Broadway
On Broadway
I'm gonna make it, yeah
On Broadway
I'll be a big, big man
On Broadway
I'll have my name in lights
On Broadway
Everybody gonna know me
On Broadway
All up and down Broadway
On Broadway
