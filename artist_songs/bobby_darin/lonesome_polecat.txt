[Bobby:]
I'm a lonesome polecat 
Lonesome, sad and blue 
'cause I ain't got no 
Feminine polecat 
Vowin' to be true
Can't make no vow 
To a heard of cows

[Johnny:]
I'm a mean old hound dog 
Bayin' at the moon 
'cause I ain't got no 
Lady friend hound dog 
Here to hear my tune
A man can't sleep 
When he sleeps with sheep

[Both:]
I'm a little old hoot owl 
Hootin' in the trees 
'cause I ain't got no 
Little gal owl fowl 
Here to shoot the breeze 
Can't shoot no breeze 
With a bunch of trees
Why can't I lose 
These lonesome polecat blues?
