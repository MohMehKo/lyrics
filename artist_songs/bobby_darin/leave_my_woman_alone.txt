Well
Now, if you don't want, you don't have to get in trouble
If you don't want, you don't have to get in trouble
If you don't want, you don't have to (get in trouble)
Say, you better leave my woman alone

Well, I know you are a playboy
And you've got your women all over town
But listen, buddy, if you ever sweet-talk my little girl
I'm gonna lay your body down

Say, if you don't want, you don't have to (get in trouble)
Now, if you don't want, no you (get in trouble)
No, you don't want, you don't have to get in trouble
Say, you better leave my woman alone

Well I know you got all kinds of money
And a brand new sixty-two
But if I ever see my little girl in your sports car
I'm gonna do some work on you

Say, if you don't want, you don't have to (get in trouble)
No, if you don't want, you don't have to (get in trouble)
If you ever don't want, you don't have to (get in trouble)
Oh, you better leave my woman alone

I don't believe in starting trouble
And I don't want to pick me a fight
But if you take heed and stay away from my little girl
Everything will be alright

If you don't want to (get in trouble)
No, you don't, if you don't want {get in trouble)
I mean to tell you, if you don't want, you don't have to (get in trouble)
Oh, you better leave my woman alone

My woman alone
My (woman alone)
You better leave (woman alone)
You better leave (woman alone)
You better leave (woman alone)
You better leave (woman alone)
You better leave (woman alone)
You better leave (woman alone)
You better leave (woman alone)
You better leave (woman alone)
You better leave (woman alone)
You better leave (woman alone)
You better leave (woman alone)
You better leave (woman alone)
You better leave (woman alone)
You better leave (woman alone)
You better leave (woman alone)
You better leave (woman alone)
You better leave (woman alone)
You better leave (woman alone)
You better leave (woman alone)
You better leave (woman alone)
You better leave (woman alone)
You better leave (woman alone)
You better leave (woman alone)
Why don't you leave (woman alone)
You better leave (woman alone)
You better leave (woman alone)
You better leave (woman alone)
You better leave (woman alone)
You better leave (woman alone)
Now, you better leave (woman alone)
You better leave (woman alone)

Now if you don't want, you don't have to (get in trouble)

If you don't want, you don't have to (get in trouble)
Say, you better leave my woman alone
My woman alone
My (woman alone)
