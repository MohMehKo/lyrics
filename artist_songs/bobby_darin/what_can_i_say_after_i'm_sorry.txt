What can I say, dear, after I say I'm sorry?
What can I do to prove it to you I'm sorry?
I didn't mean to ever be mean to you
If I didn't care, I wouldn't feel like I do

I was all wrong, but right or wrong, I don't blame you
Why should I take somebody like you and shame you?
I know that I made you cry and I'm so sorry, dear
So what can I say, dear, after I say I'm sorry?

Let's give it to the ensemble
Aah, play that single finger style
Two, three

What can I say, dear, after I say I'm sorry?
Tell me what I can do to prove it to you, I'm sorry
I didn't mean to ever be mean to you
If I didn't care, I wouldn't feel like I do, do, do, do

Aah, I was all wrong, but right or wrong, I don't blame you
Why should I take somebody like you and put the shame to you?
I know that I made you cry and I'm ever so sorry, dear
For what can I say, dear, after I say
What can I say, dear, after I say
What can I say, dear, after I say I'm sorry?
