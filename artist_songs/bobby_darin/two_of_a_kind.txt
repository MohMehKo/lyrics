Two of a kind
For your information
We're two of a kind

Two of a kind
It's my observation
We're two of a kind

Like peas in a pod
And birds of a feather
Alone or together you'll find
That we are two of a kind

What's so wrong thinkin' life is a song and reachin' for a star
And who's to say if we'll go the whole way - at least we got this far
Sharin' our lot, our vittles and viands, we're two of an ilk
Say, what if we've got rare Chateaubriands or crackers and milk

Makin' it plain
Explainin' it fully
We're simila-la-larly inclined
Because we're two of a kind

Two of a kind
When he's out of rhythm, I'm singin' off key
(I never heard ya do that, John)
Say, never you mind, cause I'm stickin' with 'im, to C above C
(He's-a for me)
Oh, need we explain
When he warbles sweetly, I'm flat and completely behind
Because we're two of a kind

I get kicks when I meet the cute chicks who hang around this lad
And especially when they whisper to me, "Hey, honey, who's your dad?"

Two of a sort
Like two pomegranates from off the same tree
I'm with ya sport, whatever you plan it's-a goes double with me
(It's-a goes double with you, huh?) (Yeah!)
Yeah, I got a terrible thought
Most frightfully upsetting
And yet we are getting resigned
To being two of a kind

We're two of a kind
We like workin' single
Or workin' in twos
Keep us in mind, give us a jingle, we've got taps on our shoes
(We'll dance!)
We're both of us like, the Tower of Pisa
I'm-a lean-a like he's-a inclined
Because we're two of a kind
Because we're
Two of a kind
