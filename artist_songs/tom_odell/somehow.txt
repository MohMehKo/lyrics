I don't speak the language that you speak
There'reâ€‹ some words I know I'll never reach
But when I see you smiling back at me

Somehow, somehow
I know exactly what you mean
Somehow, somehow
I know exactly what you mean, oh

When you look, when you look a little hurt
Sometimes I sing a song that I have learnt
I swear to God there's no way you could've heard

But somehow, somehow
You sing every single word
Somehow, somehow
You sing every single word, oh

Sometimes I go running in the dark
When I don't know how to read the stars
But where I run, it don't matter how far

Somehow, somehow
I always end up in your arms
Somehow, somehow
I always end up in your arms, oh

Somehow, somehow
Somehow, somehow

No, I don't know what happens when you die
And just the thought, you know, it kind of blows my mind
But when I look, when I look up to the sky

Somehow, somehow
I know that it will be alright
Somehow, somehow
I know that you will be beside, oh
