Tear me down
Tell me I don't need to fear
Tell me now
Tell me somebody's near
Sirens
Sirens are all I hear

They keep calling out
Keep calling out someone's name
Keep calling out
And all I can do is pray
That these sirens
Sirens don't come our way

Or we'll be
All run—run—running away
We'll be
All run—run—running away
All run—run—running away
When sirens they come our way

It's raining now
It's raining on someone's fears
Raining down
I've heard the rain is the city's tears
But these sirens
These sirens are all I hear

And they keep calling out
Keep calling out someone's name
Keep calling out
And all I can do is pray
That these sirens
These sirens don't come our way

Or we'll be
All run—run—running away
We'll be
All run—run—running away
All run—run—running away
When sirens they come our—
When sirens they come our way

All run—run—running away
All run—run—running away
We'll be
All run—run—running away
When sirens they come our way
