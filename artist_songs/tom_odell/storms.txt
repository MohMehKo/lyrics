So long
So long living
With these heavy clouds
Following me

Can't go
Can't go on running
With these muddy roads
Holding my feet

Need one of these storms
One of these storms
One of these storms
To wash me clean

So long
I've spent so long
Just living
With these heavy clothes
Upon my skin

So long
So long thinking
These sleepless nights
They keep me thin

I need one of these storms
One of these storms
One of these storms
To wash me clean

I need one of these storms
One of these storms
One of these storms
To wash me clean
