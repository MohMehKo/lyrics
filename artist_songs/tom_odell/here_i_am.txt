I thought I was over you
I’d put out the flame
Said tonight would be different
I wouldn’t need to play your games
I walked past your tower block
Saw her flicking the blinds
I said tonight would be different
And that I’d walk on by

But here I am
Running up the seventh floor
Knocking the eleventh door
I’m a sick of trying
I’m a sick of trying
Baby could you love me some more

Baby could you love me some more

Told myself I’s a prisoner
And I’d broken my chains
That I could be anyone
I’d run a thousand miles away
And I imagined America
Somewhere as far
Someplace with no memories
That couldn’t cut my heart

But here I am
Running up the seventh floor
Knocking the eleventh door
I’m a sick of trying
I’m a sick of trying
Baby could you love me some more
Baby could you love me some more
Baby could you love me some more
Baby could you love me some more

Cause I’m going out my head here darling, going out my head here darling,
Going out my head here darling, going out my head 

But here I am
Running up the seventh floor
Knocking the eleventh door
Saying what I said before
Baby could you love me some more
Baby could you love me some more

Going out my head here darling, I’m going out my head.
