Stick me up on channel two
Pourin' out my heart for you
It's a funny thing but it pays my rent,
I'm just the entertainment

Bring me in from the cold rain
I play a couple notes in exchange
They smile at me and call me their friends,
But I'm just the entertainment
I'm just the entertainment

I sing, I dance, but boy I entertain you
Hum, hum, hum, hum

Last night I lost my head
I found it in some woman's bed
I asked her what it all meant
She said 'I'm just the entertainment'

So if you feel like having a time
Maybe drink a bottle of wine
Come on down bring all your friends
I'll be your entertainment, I'll be your entertainment

I sing, I dance, and boy I entertain you
Hum, hum, hum, hum
Hum, hum, hum, hum
