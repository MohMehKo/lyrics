Why, sparrow, why won't you tell me why I'm sad?
Sing us both a melody, the best that you can
Fly, sparrow, fly. Won't you sit on my hand?
Sing it in that language we both can understand

When you sit on that tree
You look in my eyes
I wonder what goes on in your mind

Speak, sparrow, speak. Please won't you try?
Tell me why you'd walk if you knew that you could fly
Speak, sparrow, speak. Oh, please won't you try?
Tell me all the answers to this meaningless life

But you're up on that tree
And you look in my eyes
I wonder what goes on in your mind

Stay, sparrow, stay. Won't you stay in my window?
I've never been so close to anything so beautiful
Wait, sparrow, wait. Oh, please don't you go.
I love the way your feathers move as the wind it blows

But you're up on that tree
And you look in my eyes
I wonder what goes on in your mind

Sing, sparrow, sing, sing away our pain
When you get the bones of it. No, we are just the same
I said sing, sparrow, sing, sing away our pain
I'll never hear a melody as sweet as today

'Cause you're up on that tree
And you look in my eyes
And I wonder how, but you're saying goodbye
