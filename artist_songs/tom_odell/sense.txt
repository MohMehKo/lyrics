Hard to know, maybe if I'd skim the stone,
Walk a different way back home, it would all make sense.
Or shut my eyes, could lose myself in teenage lies.
If I fell in love a thousand times, would it all make sense?

Cause I, I'm feeling pretty small,
Sometimes feel like I'm slipping down walls
And every line I ever get a hold it seems to break.

Called you up and I could tell you just how much,
No no, maybe I'll just get drunk and it will all make sense.
Or if I weren't so nice, I convince my friends that you aren't right
I could promise you my heart don't cry, but would it all make sense?

Cause I, I've been feeling pretty small,
Sometimes feel like I'm slipping down walls
And every line I ever get a hold it seems to break.

Oh I, I've been feeling pretty small,
Sometimes feel like I'm slipping down walls
And every line I ever get a hold it seems to break.
