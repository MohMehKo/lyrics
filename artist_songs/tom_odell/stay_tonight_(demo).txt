If I walk in white rivers
Would you walk with me?
Or if I follow white rivers
Might I find the sea?

Or if I wrote my own life
Yeah, might I find the roads
Or if I change my old secret
Will my heart be whole

Or if I gave my all
Would you try?
And if I said I was wrong,
Is that right?
Or if I said, "Don’t go."
Honey, will ya stay tonight?

Or if I learn an old silence
Yeah, might I understand
Or if I practiced old violence
Yeah, might I be a man.
And if I found the right roadhouse, yeah.
Yeah, would I find the start?
Or if I build the right pieces,
Can you build a heart?

And if I gave my all
Would you try?
And if I said I was wrong
Is that right?
And if I said, "Don’t go."
Will you stay tonight.

If I gave my all
Would you try?
And if said I was wrong
Am I right?
And if I said, "Don’t go."
Will you stay, tonight
