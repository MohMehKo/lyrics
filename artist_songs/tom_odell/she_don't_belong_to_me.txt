My lover wears a t-shirt as she wanders
My lover wears a t-shirt as she wanders
My lover wears a t-shirt as she wanders
My lover wears a t-shirt as she wanders down the lanes
Stepping over cracks of all the worlds that she could save
As I begin to wonder will I ever be enough
Her hand, it slips away from mine along with all the love

Rhymes
The rhythm of her heart
Rhythm of her heart
Rhythm of her heart

My-y-y wander it could be
Like a feather blowing in the wind, she don't belong to me
My-y-y how happy we could be
Like a feather blowing in the wind, she don't belong to me

She let's you in her bed at night and keeps you from the cold
No matter how hard you hold her yeah, you always wake alone
Like the sun, she lights you up and everyone around
But sure as hell that sun will set, she'll always let you down

Rhymes
The rhythm of her heart
Rhythm of her heart
Rhythm of her heart

My-y-y wander it could be
Like a feather blowing in the wind, she don't belong to me
My-y-y how happy we could be
Like a feather blowing in the wind, she don't belong to me

Yeah, yeah
No no, she don't
No no, she don't
Yeah
She don't
No no, she don't
No no, she don't
Yeah

You'll see, you'll see
You'll see anything she wants
You'll pray, you'll pray
You'll pray that she take you home
You'll see, you'll see
You'll see anything she wants
You'll see, you'll see, you'll see

My-y-y how happy we could be (you'll see)
Like a feather blowing in the wind, she don't belong to me
My-y-y how happy we could be (you'll see)
Like a feather blowing in the wind, she don't belong to me
Yeah
