A coffee stain on a window sill
A bad translation to a foreign film
Or just wandering around with you
Just wandering town with you
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Would be enough

The tiny cracks on the city stone
A welcome back to your troubled home
Or just wandering around with you
Just wandering town with you
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Would be enough

But oh
I didn't see the sea until I crossed
Oh
And I didn't feel your love until I lost

The moving shadows on your swaying light
All your picture notes of the porcupines
Or just wandering around with you
Just wandering town with you
Oh, oh, oh, oh would be enough

But oh
I didn't see the sea until I crossed
Oh
And I didn't feel your love until I lost

Oh
I didn't see the sea until I crossed
Oh
And I didn't feel your love until I lost
