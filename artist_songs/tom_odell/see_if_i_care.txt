Pass me a spoon, flutter your eyes
Send me a text, send me it twice
Invite me around, beg me to stay
Put your hands on my hips, and push me away
Push me away

See if I care
See if I care
See if I care

Dress up all cute, bring me some wine
Tell me again, itâ€™s me that you like
And just when you know, you got me again
Go out on your own and sleep with my friend
Sleep with my friend

See if I care
See if I care
See if I care
See if I care
See if I care
See if I care
