Be here love
And the world has come between us
And the world has come between us
Be here love
And the world has come between us
And the world has come between us

We are so right here
You are so young
Let's misbehave
And we'll find the edge of the world
Be here love
And the world has come between us
And the world has come between us
You are so right here
We are so young
Let's misbehave
And we'll find the edge of the earth

Be here love
And the world has come between us
And the world has come between us
Be here love
