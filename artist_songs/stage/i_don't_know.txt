Send my regards to my brother down there
He walks by the ocean, the pain disappearsThe sky is now falling, heaven's unknown
And you find out the clouds were never alone

Send my regards to my lover down there
She sleeps by the music, she breathes in my air
The people are saying, the lost must be strong
But her ears are now ringing, her man of song

Will I remember your name
I don't know
Will I remember your name
I don't know

Send my regards to my mother down there
She gave me my name and my brown-colored hair
The man to my left says he's Moses in black
And the whole world is sad now, so I'm going back

Will I remember your name
I don't know
Will I remember your name
I don't know
