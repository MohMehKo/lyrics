We're all afraid our country is bleeding
We're all OK and no one is leaving
We're all the same and no one's leaving
We're breathing
We already lied tonight
We've already tried to fight
It's all the same
So why are you dreaming
We're all OK our country is bleeding
We're breathing
We already lied tonight
We already tried to fight
It's the song that makes you sad
To be loving the life like that
It's the man that makes you mad
It's the love you never had
We already lied tonight
We've already tried to fight
We are ready
I'm tired for sleep
We already lied
We are ready
