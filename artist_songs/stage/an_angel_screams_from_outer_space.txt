Maybe I'll rape you after school one day in March
Maybe I'll learn to scream the anger from your heart
You'll teach me math, we'll learn to play those stupid games.
A virgin bleeds, an angel screams from outer space
Oh, oh
Didn't want to make you suffer
Didn't want to make you cry
I just wanted to set your mind free
Didn't want to spread the lies
Maybe I'll rape you after school one day in March
Maynbe I'll learn to scream the anger from your heart
You'll teach me math, we'll learn the numbers and the signs
A virgin bleeds, an angel screams and I feel fine
Oh, oh
Don't follow me home
