Listen to the insects
Prey on the enemy
For when you hunt the loved
You hunt yourself
When the feast is over
You're lying down to feel
You're crazy and so sore
I feel like now to stop
I felt like this once before
Listen to the insects
Prey on the enemy
For when you hunt the loved
You hunt yourself
When the feast is over
The pain begins and holds
Until you have
No more stomach to digest
So live happy, live with anorexia
