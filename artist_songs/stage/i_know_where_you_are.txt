I hope that you missed me
I'm glad that you kissed me
I'll see you again when I die
Know that I missed you
Know that I'll kiss you
Whenever an angel flies by
Youre'crazy in bathtubs
Those innocent backrubs
Demons were scared of thee
I know it's confusing
I know it's amusing
The devil is inside of me
I know where you are
I know where you are
So thanks for my music
Know that I used it
I named every song after you
The guitar is stronger
I learned how to love her
The wood brings me closer to truth
I know where you are
I know where you are
I know where you are
We walk, we find
I dance by your inner mind
I just want to thank you
The pain made me stronger
The artist is what I will stay
Know I forgive you
I hope I outlive you
I'm glad that you stood in my way
I know where you are
I know where you are
I know where you are
I know where you are
Want to thank you
Want to thank you my friends
