We are falling from these rooftops
We are losing where we stand
All my lovers were forgotten
When I died right at your hands
Where were you when I was bleeding
Where were you the last three years
I have seen the world together
With my pen and all my tears
I will be something, thats's all
You will be nothing at all
I will be something, thats's all
You will be nothing at all
I am screaming from these rooftops
I am crying out demands
All my people are forgotten
All my friends are in this band
Where were you when I was teething
Where were you through my kid fears
Introduced me as an orphan
To all, all, all my family
I will be something, that's all
You will be nothing at all
I will be something, that's all
You will be nothing at all
