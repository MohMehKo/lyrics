If I would die tomorrow
And you were finally free
I wouldn't feel a difference
If you would die with me
'Cause I'm already sad
And I'm already sad
Now that the war is gone
And the bodies left to die
A man looks up for his country
With the flag in his eyes
Oh, I know I'll find my direction home
Telling all your secrets
Watch them all grow old
Nevermind the reasons
Or why they're ever told
You my friends are sacred
So you my friends must die
A mand looks up from his country
Is the God we love alive?
Oh, I know I'll find my direction home
Oh, you loved the song of my direction home
I know I'll find my direction home
