Science is dead
Jesus was a test tube baby
Science is read
A beaker was the Virgin Mary
Losing yourself
Burn all the sages remember
I am no dead
Come down the ancients before me
And it feels like science died
And it feels like science died
Science is dead
I feels like science died
And ie feels like science died
Maybe soon we'll ride to space again
And it feels like science died
