Let's take a walk for a while
We'll find out all we missed
I've seen all the things you have done
Creations from my sins
You tried to find comfort in books
You tried to find comfort in sex
You haven't felt a love
Since you fell out of the best
So hold on
Let's take a walk for a while
We'll find out all we missed
I've seen all the things you have done
I killed all of the scientists
They tried to put numbers on life
They tried to put numbers on God
I haven't felt a love
Since you fell out of my arms
So hold on
I'm in love with a memory
I'm in love with your memory
Let's take a walk for a while
We'll find out all we missed
I brought the knife, I will use it
Oh so good
I'll find you, I swear I'll find you again
I hope you're swimming with virgins
I swear, I swear I'll find you again
I'll be the one with blonde hair
I've always wanted blonde hair
Going to find you there
To be like you
To be like this
Going to find you there
Going to be like this
Don't do this
To find you there
To speak to you
All the scientists say they want my hair
Going to be like this
Going to find you there
Going to be
Been like that, you suddenly realize it's over now
You're going to heaven alone
I see you there
I feel you there
I'm not sad anymore
I feel you here

You look like the one my life is about
The truth won't kill me, it will just knock me out
See I fell in love, when you were too young
Your canvas was set, but the colors were wrong
