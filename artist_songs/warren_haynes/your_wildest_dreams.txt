If you need me
You know where you can find me
I'll be there, yeah, in your wildest dreams

Heard the word out on the street
Oh, that you're feeling guilty
Your decision was made in anger and haste
Say a love like ours will stand the test of time
Listen love like ours is too good to waste

When I needed someone to hold me
You are often gone with someone else
And time don't stop the pain with tears I, I cried
Now you're telling me we can put it all behind us
Yes, you're telling me, "Honey, this time I've changed"

Well, if you need
You know where you can find me
I'll be there, yeah, in your wildest dreams

Oh, but I can't deny what we had was real
So real that I might never be the same
Sometimes the flame burned brighter, brighter than the sun
And we cooled ourselves in the soft summer rain

Yeah, sometimes I still long to hold you, to drown myself again
And time, it never gonna stop the pain with tears I've cried
And I'm not trying to say I won't be lost without you
I'm not trying to say I won't breakdown

But if you need me
You know where you can find me
I'll be there, yeah, in your wildest dreams, oh yeah
I'll be there, oh
Yes, I will

Time ain't never gonna stop the pain
Time ain't never gonna stop the pain
Oh yeah

Oh yeah

Oh
You know where you can find me, oh

Time ain't never
Never, never, never, never gonna stop the pain

Oh
If you need me
You know where you can find me
Yes, I'll be there in your wildest dreams
