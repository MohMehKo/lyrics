It feels so good to breathe the air
Another spin around the sun
On this spec of life
In the universe
The gift of love
Is there for everyone

Angels working over time
Day or night to hold the hands
That play all alone
A baby's born pure to the world
As the old man lays down his head and closes his out
With nothing said

Every year another promise is made
A pint of beer raised towards a better day
Lets find a star, a star to call our own
And make a wish, maybe we can make it home

Ain't it good to be alive?
To feel the sun, strong against your face
Strawberry blonde waves of silky hair
Spills over me like the milky way

Ain't it good to be alive?
Ain't it good to be alive?

Alive, alive? [x2]

Ain't it good to breathe the air
Another spin around the sun
On this spec of life in the universe
A little peace of life in everyone
Ain't it good to be alive?
Ain't it good to be alive?
To feel the sun strong against your face
It spills over me like the milky way

Alive, alive? [x2]
