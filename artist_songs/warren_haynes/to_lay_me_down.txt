To lay me down
Once more to lay me down
With my head in sparkling clover
Let the world go by

All lost in dreaming
To lay me down
One last time
To lay me down

To be with you
Once more to be with you
With our bodies close together
Let the world go by

Like clouds a-streaming
To lay me down
Once more
To lay me down

To lay me down
To lay me down
To lay me down
Once more
To lay me down

To lie with you
One more to lie with you
With our dreams entwined together
To lie beside you

My love still sleeping
To tell sweet lies
One last time
And say good night

To lay me down
To lay me down
To lay me down
One last time
To lay me down

To lay me down
One last time
To lay me down
