He said "man, there's got to be a plan
There's always been a plan and
What's happening ain't right
And we can't let go of our power
'Cause we're rich and we're straight and we're white

Content with our sins
But don't you go calling us selfish
Comfortable in our own skin
As long as it doesn't touch anyone else's

Time to beat down the dust
Can't have it dragging us down
Can't have it clinging to us
Can't have it turning us brown"

He said "Man has always been the man
And that's always been the way it should be
And they don't need to understand
As long as we make them
Believe that they're free

And keep everyone scared 
That something's being taken away
That's the only way to keep
Things 'Back in the day'"

Time to beat down the dust
Can't have it dragging us down
Can't have it clinging to us
Can't have it turning us brown
Time to beat down the dust
Can't have it rising you see
Time to beat down the dust
Keep it off [?] you and me

And when the day finally comes
We'll be so far away
They'll never know what we stole
It'll be all hidden away
And we can supply our own energy
God knows we own enough companies
Maybe even start our own country
Where all rich, white men are free

Time to beat down the dust
Can't have it dragging us down
Can't have it clinging to us
Can't have it turning us brown
Time to beat down the dust
Can't have it rising you see
Time to beat down the dust
Keep it off [?] you and me
