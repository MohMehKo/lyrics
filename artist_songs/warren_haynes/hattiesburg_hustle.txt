Poor boy-hailed from Mississippi
Had dreams beyond just a family
Left home when he was just seventeen
Never even looked back till he was twenty three
By then he'd been through the ringer
Made himself a name as a singer
Read about in all of the papers
How the boy got lost in the vapors

Ego is a muscle-just add fame and watch it swell

Lot of things have changed since the old days
God bless the fool who gets in your way
Too much time living with your own disease
Too many lines blurring out the boundaries
Lost friends fallen by the wayside
Lost lovers take it all in stride
Eyes closed [?] still it should be plain to see
You're not the boy that you used to be

Ego is a muscle-just add fame and watch it swell
Do the Hattiesburg Hustle, shuffle 'em off to Hell

Take me back in time
Show me things as they were
Let my soul unwind
Take me to the place where things ain't such a blur

Poor boy-hailed from Mississippi
Had dreams beyond just a family

Ego is a muscle-just add fame and watch it swell
Do the Hattiesburg Hustle, shuffle 'em off to Hell
Shuffle 'em off to Hell
Shuffle 'em off to Hell
Shuffle 'em off to Hell
