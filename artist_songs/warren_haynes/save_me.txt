If I needed you, would you come to me?
If I was lost, would you comfort me?
If I had all I could take of this old unforgiving world
Could I count on you to pull me through

And save me
Shelter me from the pouring rain
Lift me up with your precious love
Make this half-a-man feel whole again

If I needed strength to carry on
And feeling your touch, oh, it was the only way
Would you be here today
To find a way to save me?

Losing you, hardest thing I've ever done
And I give up our live together
To find my day in the sun

And now when I look into someone's eyes
I see the reflection of a fool
Too proud to pray but still waiting for the day
You'll come back into my life

And save me
Shelter me from the pouring rain
Lift me up with your precious love
Make this half-a-man feel whole again

If I needed strength to carry on
And feeling your touch, oh, it was the only way
Would you be here today
To find a way to save me?
