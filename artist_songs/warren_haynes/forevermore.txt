I can feel the rain fall down
Like tears upon my shoulders.
I can feel the hard wind blow,
Blow on forevermore.

I can feel the gods look down,
Some laugh while some are crying.
I can feel their wasted tears
Cry on forevermore.

Cant you see,
My whole world is nothing
Without you.
Cant you see
My whole world is nothing
Without you.

Once in another past
You brought me joy and laughter
Now that its all used up
I cry forevermore.

Once in another life
A paper sun is shining.
Now that its all burned up
Darkness forevermore.

Cant you see
My whole world is nothing
Without you.
Cant you see
My whole world is nothing
Without you.

Where will I run to
When I need a place to hide.
Far away from New York city.
Who will I turn to
Now that my love is dying.

Cant you see
My whole world is nothing
Without you.
Cant you see
My whole world is nothing
Without you.

I can feel the rain fall down
Like tears upon my shoulders,
I cant feel my love
Shes gone forevermore.
