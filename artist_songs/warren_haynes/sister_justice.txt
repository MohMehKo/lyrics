Climb that ladder walk that line
Do what we say and you'll be just fine
Count your money don't count on me
I'll be there laughing basking my luxury

Stay in your world God knows I stay in mine
Drink your poison while I drink my wine
I said I'm masquerading as someone who cares
I'll be there when they push you
Down those golden stairs

Do your dirty work
But don't come crying to me
Sister Justice

She ain't blind she just don't want to see
Here on the island every man's an island
And every day is judgement day
Don't come crying to me

Tears in your coffee dirt in your dreams
The rich get richer while the poor man screams
Got the boys in battle face down in the mud
On foreign soil trading oil for blood

Do your dirty work
But don't come crying to me
Sister Justice

Don't dirty me up
I see you in the frozen rain
Don't dirty me up
I don't understand your pain
Don't dirty me up
But I fear what I can't explain
