Five cars in a four car garage
The whole world is your entourage
You could circle the moon
With your circle of friends

Party with a valet
And it's sunday night
"Let's take the Jag, honey"
Got to do it right
Make that impression
The cycle never ends

"What are you drinking?
Can I get your coat?
Didn't quite catch your name"
"Gin and tonic honey and yes you can
And it don't matter we're all the same"

Up here in the power and the glory
Ride it while it's hot
Come on and tell your story
Yeah give it all you got

In the corner your gracious host
Dangling carrots in front of everybody's nose
Must be nice to wear people like a ring

He say "I make the money so I make the rules
I make the distance between the face cards and the fools
We play with my deck
And there ain't but one king"

It's "senator this" and "govenor that"
Just who all do you employ?
How many judges are in your pocket?
'Cause that's what separates men from boys

Up here in the power and the glory
Ride it while it's hot
Come on and tell your story
Yeah give it all you got

Place no others before me
They might get chewed up used up
That's the way it goes
Up here up here in the power and the glory

Backstage in the dressing room
It's all hush hush
Somebody's been crude somebody's been crushed
"He was my hero how could he be so mean?"
Well it ain't no secret ain't nothing new
You whip out your gold card
And you paint the town blue
Ride off into the sunset on your trusty limousine

Tell the boys "got to clean it up
Yeah get me out of this mess"
Anyway you know what they say
Good press
Bad press
It's all press

Up here in the power and the glory
Ride it while it's hot
Come on and tell your story
Yeah give it all you got

Place no others before me
They might get chewed up used up
That's the way it goes
Up here up here in the power and the glory

Up here in the power and the glory
Ride it while it's hot
Come on and tell your story
Yeah give it all you got

Power and the glory...
