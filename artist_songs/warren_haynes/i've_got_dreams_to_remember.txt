I've got dreams,
Dreams to remember
Many many dreams
Hard dreams and
Rough dreams to remember

Saw you there last night
Another mans arms held you tight
I don't know how I felt inside
All I know is I walked away and cried

I've got dreams,
Dreams to remember
Many many dreams
Hard dreams and
Rough dreams to remember

I know you said you was just afraid
But I saw you kiss him again and again
These eyes are lit they don't fool me
Why did you hold him so tenderly

I've got dreams,
Dreams to remember
Many many dreams
Hard dreams and
Rough dreams to remember

I still want you to stay
I still love you anyway
Don't you ever leave
Come on baby
Don't you know you satisfy me

I've got dreams,
Dreams to remember
Many many dreams
Hard dreams and
Rough dreams to remember

I still want you to stay
I still love you anyway
Don't you ever ever leave me
Don't you know that you satisfy me
I've got dreams, dreams to remember
I've got dreams, dreams to remember
