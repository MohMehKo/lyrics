The time is right for looking in the mirror
The time is wrong for holding on to the past
Look around you'll see the world is changing
Changing all too fast

Time is of the essence so they say
We're not supposed to waste it so we do
The changes that we need are gonna come
But it's up to me and you

We gotta listen to the word on the wind
Higher voices calling
You gotta listen to the word on the wind
We got to get together
If we're gonna make it, my friend

Love is really never not the answer
And hate is never far enough away
The question of our future lies
Inside the games that politicians play

We gotta listen to the word on the wind
Higher voices calling
You gotta listen to the word on the wind
We got to get together
If we're gonna make it, my friend

Time to believe in what you know
Time to surrender
Surrender to what you don't

The time is never wrong for understanding
The time is never right until it's here
The danger of deception is we all
Hide behind what's so unclear

Word on the wind
We got to get together
If we're gonna make it, my friend
