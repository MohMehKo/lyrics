Tears on the inside of your face
But none on the outside
No pain could penetrate the callouses
Palaces you've built from the ground floor

Show only the dark side of your past
So long since you've tried
To replace the wooden mask that
Hangs around your neck
Like some token of war

A survivor
Is what you call yourself
But have you looked through
The eyes of someone else?

Is it me or you that's killing you, baby?
Is it me or you that's trying to hang on?

Like a bullet dancing in your breast
You hide the answer
And point it at my chest
With your aiming eyes
The same eyes that used to be my window

The denier
Never seeking help
But has it grown too late to help yourself?

Is it me or you that's killing you, baby?
Is it me or you that's trying to hang on?

You say "Nobody wants to save you
Nothing in this world could save you"

But maybe I could save you if only I knew
Is it me or you?

Tears on the inside of your face
But none on the outside
No pain could penetrate the callouses
Palaces you've built from the ground floor
