Dive in, dive in, boy
The water's only deep
And head first is the only way into this life

Oh sit right down
Is there anything I can do
To be a friend to you
Maybe give you something you could keep
But what would that be

Ride on, ride on, boy
Your white horse into the wind
Critic's darling-poet to the working man
They try to love you but they will never understand

Oh sit right down
Is there anything I can do
To be a friend to you
Maybe give you something you could keep
Everything you had you either lost or threw away
And at the end of the day
I guess that's what I'll be
When you're finally through with me

You and your mystical charm
A hole in your soul-another in your arm
People bow down to you
But they could never bow so low as when you sink
Like a stone
Into your blue throne

Wasted, wasted, wasting away
Like the years we've both seen come and go
No way to bring it all back
Screaming your lungs out
Where have all the listeners gone?
Did they turn their back on greatness?
Did they turn their back on a light divine?
They say every star burns out in time

Boy, sit right down
Is there anything I can do
To be a friend to you
Maybe give you something you could keep
But what would that be
Everything you had you either lost or threw away
I'll tell ya, at the end of the day
I guess that's what I'll be
When you're finally through with me
When you're finally through with me
When you're finally through with me
