Everyday will be like a holiday
When my baby comes home
She's been gone
For such a long time
Since she's been gone
She's been on my mind
But I got a letter this morning
Just about noon
She said don't worry I'll be home soon and

Everyday will be like a holiday
When my baby comes home

I won't have to worry
Sitting by the phone
When she gets here I know I'll never be alone
She called me, said "baby I'll be there sometime today" and
When she gets here she'll never go away and

Everyday will be like a holiday
When my baby comes home
Everyday will be like a holiday
When my baby comes home
Everyday will be like a holiday
When my baby comes home
