I'm on a roll,
I'm on a roll this time,
I feel my luck could change.

Kill me Sarah,
Kill me again with love,
It's gonna be a glorious day.

Pull me out of the aircrash,
Pull me out of the lake,
I'm your superhero,
We are standing on the edge.

The head of state has sent for me by name,
But I don't have time for him.
It's gonna be a glorious day!
I feel my luck could change.

Pull me out of the aircrash,
Pull me out of the lake,
I'm your superhero,
We are standing on the edge.

Pull me out of the aircrash,
Pull me out of the lake,
I'm your superhero,
We are standing on the edge.
