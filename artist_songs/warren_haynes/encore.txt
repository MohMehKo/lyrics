Encore, replay, encore, replay, encore, replay

Baby I know I blew it
But I just wanna do right
If you'd just let me renew it
Just try one more time, oh girl
Baby let me redeem myself,
I never loved, loved nobody else, no, no
I'll do it right, make it right

Encore, replay,
Baby please don't throw our love away
Encore, replay,
Let me make up for yesterday
Encore, replay,
You're the only one I give a piece of mine
Encore, replay,
We'll make it worth next time
Baby let's rewind, hey
We've been playing ,we've been trading
You can blame it on your so called friends
Who let us see straight
We were doing alright till they came
But, do all you want me too

Encore, replay,
Baby please don't throw our love away
Encore, replay,
Let me make up for yesterday
Encore, replay,
You're the only one I give a piece of mine
Encore, replay,
We'll make it worth next time

Baby give me one more chance
To fix all the hurt I've caused in our romance
Just let me try it again
We've been taking in... lies
Just give me one more try
Believe me, I didn't do it baby
I didn't do it baby.
