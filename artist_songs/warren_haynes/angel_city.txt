Angels in the heaven demons on the ground
My head is spinning somewhere in between
Homes that look like mansions
Not so far away from the cardboard ones
That make our streets unclean

Lord I don't know why
I just wound up here
I can outrun the pain
But I can't explain
Why I can't outrun the fear

Guess the angel I had on my shoulder
Stayed back in my hometown
And here in angel city
There just ain't enough angels to go around

Demons cast their blanket of darkness
On the ground like nightfall
And we confuse it with magic in the air
See that girl with the day-glo halo
She ain't been here long at all
Says someday she's going back
If she can just remember where

And the guy sleeping on the streets
Yeah I wonder "does he pray?"
And I wonder about me
Why I don't get up and leave
When I ain't got no reason to stay

Guess the angel I had on my shoulder
Stayed back in my hometown
And here in angel city
There just ain't enough angels to go around

Yeah,they say this town is like quicksand
I say "it's time
I gotta take my life into my own hands"

Guess the angel I had on my shoulder
Stayed back in my hometown
And here in angel city
There just ain't enough angels to go around
