Waycross boy,
Self-medicated prophet
Freight train running through your heart
No way to stop it
The love of all the angels
Couldn't fill the hole it left
Songs and whiskey eased the pain
But the weary never rest

Wanderlust
It's bigger than the best of us

Like so many before you
You took the big bird to the west coast
But California gold ain't what you craved most
Beauteous Harmony with your lover's what you missed
But you can't stop your rambling
Once your soul's been kissed

Wanderlust
It's bigger than the best of us

So many roads
So many shattered dreams
So much southern pride
Bursting at the seams
No talent hacks
Trying to tell you who you are
Waycross boy shoots the moon
Winds up a star

So you take the journey
Maybe for the last time
But your heart's still beating
Somewhere in Carolina
And you're still burning
Down by the Joshua tree
And we all come to see you now
In the garden of memories

Wanderlust
It's bigger than the best of us
