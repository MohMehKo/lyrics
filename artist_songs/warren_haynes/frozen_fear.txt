Saw you from the corner of my eye
I know loneliness when I see it
Normally I'm not the hero type
But there was something between us
I could feel it
I could feel it

So I thought I'd throw you a line
I've needed one myself so many times
Now here were are, somewhere between "thankful" and "where do we go now?"

I know you're just running scared
And after all you've been through
You've got to beware
But don't be afraid to live your life my dear
Unwillingness
Is just frozen fear

Find someplace soft and warm
I know we all need a little shelter from the storm
Times like these
You've got to leave it all behind
And know a new sun is
Gonna rise and shine

I know you're just running scared
And after all you've been through
You've got to beware
But don't be afraid to live your life my dear
Unwillingness
Is just frozen fear

I know you think it can't be done
But every moment a new life is begun
People rise above everyday
Things that you and I will never have to face

Hold onto me if you need to
I know the river's deep and wide
Trust in me I'll see you through
And I'll be there on the other side

I know you're just running scared
After all you've been through
You've got to be aware
Don't be afraid to live your life my dear
Unwillingness
Is just frozen fear
Just frozen fear
