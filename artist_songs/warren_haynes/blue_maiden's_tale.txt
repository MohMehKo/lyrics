The sun did rise, yesterday, on that frozen hill
As the crow flies, about twenty miles from Brownsville
As I lay asleep
Comfortably caught in my dream
Visions of you
Wading in a mountain stream

And there's a story
No one knows if it's true
About a maiden
Just as pretty as you
It's a tale of a soldier who
Left that maiden blue

As I walk alone
This path that I chose long ago
Try as I may
I can't keep my demons below
And every tear that I've caused
Comes back twelvefold
And my destiny is to walk through
The rain and the cold

And there's a story
No one knows if it's true
About a maiden
Just as pretty as you
It's a tale of a soldier who
Left that maiden blue

The sun did set, last night,
On Brownsville town
And the darkness that fell
We hope never again shall be found
And I lay awake
Hearing echoes
Of a young maiden's song
And sleep never came
Just the thoughts of the one I did wrong
The one I did wrong
