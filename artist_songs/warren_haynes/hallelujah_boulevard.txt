Everything is shiny and surrounded by light
Endless rows of halos
Like stars in the night
Sidewalks paved with diamonds
Up on hallelujah boulevard

He saw it on the T.V.
And it looked so clean
Like some enchanted island
Like he stepping into a dream
Now he's hell bent for glory
To get to hallelujah boulevard

And a soapbox preacher with
His busload of faith
Fueled by his religion
Gonna charge through the gate
And he won't slow down till he
gets to hallelujah boulevard

We don't need a miracle
We don't need nothing but ourselves

A boy walks the streets when
He should be in school
Gold chains around his neck
But no golden rule
He says he'll do what he has to do
To get to hallelujah boulevard

And a homeless junkie knows he's home at last
Knows he'll never have to watch
Another rich, white man pass
And he can see those lights a 'shining
Up on hallelujah boulevard

Is that a sword in your side or just a thorn?
Do we tear ourselves apart
Just to know we're torn
So we can grow forlorn?

Are we climbing a mountain
That's not even there?
Building a rocket ship that runs
On hopes and prayers?
Trying to leave this world behind
In search of hallelujah boulevard?

We don't need a miracle
We don't need a miracle
We don't need a miracle
We don't need nothing but ourselves
