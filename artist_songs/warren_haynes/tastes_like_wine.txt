Hey, are you still here in the morning light
Last night was a world I've never known
Parallel universe in one small room collided
Now the seed is sewn
Time, time, my friend, we've been through so much, it seems
Alone together till the end

And, now, though I find this all so threatening
I can feel it - sinking into my skin
The gods must be nervous - can't you feel it shaking inside you
World must be trembling like I am

Clouds must be breaking - blood raining down from the heavens
And it feels like gold - tastes like wine

Strength has always been my enemy
Solitude I've known like my own name
People, by now, know what to expect from me
Nothing - and I will do the same

The gods must be nervous - can't you feel it shaking inside you
World must be trembling like I am
Clouds must be breaking - blood raining down from the heavens
And it feels like gold - tastes like wine

The gods must be nervous - can't you feel it shaking inside you
World must be trembling like I am
Clouds must be breaking - blood raining down from the heavens
And it feels like gold - tastes like wine
