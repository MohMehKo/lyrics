Sit behind your desk in a little blue chair
Last week it was red guess you got tired of that
Stare out the window at the rest of the world
Used to be your world guess you got tired of that

You like to keep yourself busy, busy, busy
Don't want to be like moss on a tree
Everybody knows you're busy, busy, busy
Being all that you can be

Movers and shakers big deal makers
Acres of corruption in this little big town
Heartbreakers fakers and undertakers
That's what it takes to keep it all spinning
Keep it all spinning around

Looking back on a time when you were no big deal
Just a boy from Brooklyn
Guess you got tired of that
The only hits you knew were the Italian kind
Yeah you used to be a good boy
Guess you got tired of that

You like to think that you're invincible, invincible
Safe from it all behind these black rock walls
The titanic was unsinkable
Nobody's too big to fall

Movers and shakers big deal makers
Acres of corruption in this little big town
Heartbreakers fakers and undertakers
That's what it takes to keep it all spinning
Keep it all spinning around

Yeah you like to think that you're invincible
Safe from it all behind these black rock walls
