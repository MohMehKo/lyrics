I can't help complaining about the situation
I'm 'bout to lose my mind
So easy to judge and preach about salvation
With somebody else's ass on the line
Everybody just livin' for today and they
Kiss tomorrow good-bye

So many people concerned about my occupation
Livin' in a wishing well
Some say I was premature in my resignation
I say only time will tell
I don't want to be another fool
Caught up in the past and

Kiss tomorrow good-bye
Kiss tomorrow good-bye
Kiss tomorrow good-bye
Kiss tomorrow good-bye

Oh, love's confusion
Keeps me here in this warm illusion
Give it to me every little dream
Fascinate me fill me to the seam

Blindness whole damn nation got the
"Forest for the trees disease"
Learn from your brother and your sister
From another land they ain't your enemy
Or we can all just bow our heads to pray and

Kiss tomorrow good-bye
Kiss tomorrow good-bye
Kiss tomorrow good-bye
Kiss tomorrow good-bye

Kiss tomorrow good-bye
Kiss tomorrow good-bye
Kiss tomorrow good-bye
Kiss tomorrow good-bye
