You upset me
More than anybody on this planet
Make me feel so bad some times
Honey, I can't stand it
Make me wonder why you're even with me
Then you turn around, turn around
Tell me how much you miss me

Oh, I don't understand half the things you do
But I, I'd take a bullet for you

You test me on a regular basis
Contest me
Honey, you know I can't take this
Make me look deep down, deep down inside of me
So deep down inside, to a part of me I don't want to see

Oh, I don't understand half the things you do
But I, I'd take a bullet for you

Yeah, sometimes when you hold me
The whole world seems to fall away
No matter how much I hate to admit it
Our love is here to stay

Oh, I don't understand half the things you do
But I, I'd take a bullet for you:
Take a bullet, baby
