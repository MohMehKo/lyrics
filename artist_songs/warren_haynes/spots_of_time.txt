Spots of time flash before my eyes
Like ribbons of light
Helplessly I try to touch them
Before they disappear into the night

Running fearlessly as in a dream
Headlong into the wind
Cool night air, blowing through our hair
Moonlight dancing on your skin

Do you remember
How young we were or is it just me
Imagining like I always do
When we were once wild and free

Young man yearning for days gone by
Innocence once removed
Familiar feeling of a front porch swing
And a song, always soothes

Spots of time like windows appear
You can look out or in
But you can't get to the future I regret
By going through the past, my friend

Do you remember
How young we were or is it just me
Imagining like I always do
That we were once wild and free

A mother's tears, a sparrow's wing
A lover's eyes softly glistening
Memories that to me are everything
But to others maybe only ashes and dust 

Do you remember
How young we were or is it just me
Imagining like I always do
When we were once wild and free

Do you remember
How young we were or is it just me
Imagining like I always do
When we were once wild and free
Wild and free
