Every heart wants the upper hand
But it was more than I could ever stand
Said you were runnin when you hit the ground
Mostly you were just hangin around

You said love has always been kind to you
Now you know, it can be unkind too
Pay no mind when I slam the door because
We both now know that’s what you came here for

Have you been waiting on a broken heart?
Did you see the end from the very start?
I saw it too, but I never knew that you
were only waiting on a broken heart

Clock’s always tickin up on the wall
Waitin’ for someone to take the fall
One hand says it’s time to move on
The other says that it’s time to move on and

True love’s always been such a racket
You try every code, but you never can crack it
Cause there’s love that’s new and all the rest
but the love that’s gone, baby, hurts the best

Have you been waiting on a broken heart?
Did you see the end from the very start?
I saw it too, but I never knew that you
were only waiting on a broken heart
