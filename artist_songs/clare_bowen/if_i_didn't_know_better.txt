If I didn’t know better, I’d hang my hat right there
If I didn’t know better, I’d follow you up the stairs

Stop saying those sweet things
You know I’d like to hear
The horns are blowing louder
The bailiff's drawing near

Why do I keep drinking
Wasting my time on you
If I didn’t know better
Well, dammit, I do

There’s a hole in what you’re saying
I can plainly see
You've a lover that’s waiting
But, baby, you’re right here with me

Ooh
You might as well be the devil
Keeping me out past three
Well, you’re the one with that apple
But, baby, you can’t blame me

Why don’t you keep drinking
Give me one night with you
If I didn’t know better
Well, dammit, I do

Oh baby i do
Baby, you’re right here with me
Sweet daddy, you know I do
