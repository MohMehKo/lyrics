I can see your eyes staring into mine,
But it's a battlefield and you're on the other side.
You can throw your words, sharper than a knife,
And leave me cold in another house on fire.

I lay low, lay low and watch the bridges burn
I lay low, lay low. What more could I have done?

[Chorus:]
Now you only bring me black roses,
And they crumble into dust when they're held
Now you only bring me black roses,
Under your spell

She told me twice all her good advice,
But I couldn't see I was clouded by your lies.
Up in smoke, a vision she foretold,
She said, "Stay away 'cause that boy's a warning sign."

I lay low, lay low and watch the bridges burn

[Chorus]

And I'm done trying to be the one picking up the broken pieces
And I'm done trying to be the one who says, "I love you dear but I'm leaving."

Now you only bring me black roses
And they crumble into dust when they're held
Now you only bring me black roses
But I'm not under your spell

I'm not under your spell [4x]
