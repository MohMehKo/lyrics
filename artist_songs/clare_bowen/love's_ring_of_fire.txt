Love is a burning thing
And it makes a fiery ring
Bringing hurt to the hearts desire
I fell in the ring of fire.

I fell into into the burning ring of fire
I fell down, down, down, down
Into the deepest mire.
And it burns, burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire, the ring of fire
The ring of fire

The taste of love is sweet
When two fiery hearts meet
I believed you like a child
Oh, but the fire went wild.

I fell into into the burning ring of fire
I fell down, down, down, down
Into the deepest mire.
And it burns, burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire, the ring of fire
The ring of fire
