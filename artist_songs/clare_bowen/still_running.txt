Looking back at a life I've been given,
It's got me puzzled how I lost control,
When your hearts screaming words 
Like "Just leave it", 
But I was broken with nowhere to go

Said if I had a heart and a reason
I played a part in the role as a fool
Didn't know I was trapped in believing
To know this game was just all about you

You took my freedom but I'm still running,
You tore my heart out but its still beating,
You stole my beauty but I'm still glowing
These walls I've built up, you can't climb no more

As I reflect on the things that have happened
Here are the scars that I'm left to embrace
If it's your story, then run with the millions 
And never give up on this mindless pace

Said if I had a heart and a reason 
I played a part in the role as a fool
Didn't know I was trapped in believing
To know this game was just all about you

You took my freedom but I'm still running,
You tore my heart out but its still beating,
You stole my beauty but I'm still glowing,
These walls I've built up, you can't climb no more

You took my freedom but I'm still running,
You tore my heart out but its still beating,
You stole my beauty but I'm still glowing,
These walls I've built up, you can't climb no more

You took my freedom but I'm still running,
You tore my heart out but its still beating,
You stole my beauty but I'm still glowing,
These walls I've built up, you can't climb no more

I'm still running
And my hearts still beating
I'll keep glowing
The walls I've built up, you can't climb no more
