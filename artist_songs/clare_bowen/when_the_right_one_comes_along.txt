There's no music, no confetti
Crowds don't cheer, and bells don't ring
But you'll know it, I can guarantee
When the right one comes along

What they're thinkin', what you're feelin,
You no longer have to guess
All those questions are finally put to rest
When the right one comes along

Every single broken heart will lead you to the truth
You think you know what you're lookin for
Til what you're lookin for finds you

In a cold world, it's a warm place
Where you know that you're supposed to be
A million moments full of sweet relief
When the right one comes along

Every single broken heart will lead you to the truth
You think you know what you're lookin' for
Til what you're lookin' for finds you

It's so easy, nothin' to it
Though you may not believe me now
But I promise honey you'll find out
When the right one comes along

All that changes is only everything
When the right one comes along
