I'm afraid to go up to the second floor
If you wanted to work it out why'd you lock the door?
I thought I was good at loving you
But our light went out when you wanted it to
I wish you the best, I'm headed west
It's all I know to do

I will fall, I will fall if you come around
Just when I think my heartbreak settled down
I will fall, I will fall if you come around

We said goodbye it was forever
And I spent the last year piecing my life together
Just when I think I've let you go
Your song's playing on the radio
And just like that it rushes back,
Every part of you

I will fall, I will fall if you come around
Just when I think my heartbreak settled down
I will fall, I will fall if you come around

Ooh, ooh, ooh [x3]

I will fall, I will fall if you come around
Just when I think my heartbreak settled down

I will fall, I will fall if you come around
Just when I think my heartbreak has settled down
I will fall, I will fall if you come around
