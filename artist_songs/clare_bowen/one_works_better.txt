Well, this plane can fly with just one engine
This heart can beat without affection
I’m not a choice, I’m a natural selection

Well this house can stand just fine on it’s own
This hands gonna rule without a throne
I’m not a mother, I’m the queen of invention.

I’m gonna make you see the difference between just quitting and survival
I’ve got a voice, and I made my choice between heartbreak and revival
Oh I know you’ll hate, how I make everything look easy to do
Know that it’s my pleasure, doing everything better without you
Cause this one works better than two

Romantics are a dying breed
And this romance is dead to me
So I’m gonna bury your love six feet under

Well they say that one’s a lonely number
But a lightning struck and I found my thunder
There’s another side of you that you’re about to discover

I’m gonna make you see the difference between just quitting and survival
Oh I’ve got a voice, and I made my choice between heartbreak and revival
Well I know you’ll hate, how I make everything look easy to do
Know that it’s my pleasure, doing everything better without you
Cause this one works better than-

two wrongs don’t make a right
When one leaves, the other behind
And I found you only regret
When you stay to long with the one that you’ll forget

I’m gonna make you see the difference between just quitting and survival
Oh I’ve got a voice, and I’ve made my choice between heartbreak and revival
Yeah I know you’ll hate, how I make, everything look easy to do
Know that it’s my pleasure, doing everything better without you
Ooh honey it’s my pleasure, doing everything better without you
Cause this one works better than two
Cause this one works better than two
