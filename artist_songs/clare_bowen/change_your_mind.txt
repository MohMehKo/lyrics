[Verse 1:]
When you wake wanting me 
And you can't go back to sleep
Change your mind
When you're weak and all alone
And you're reaching for the phone
Change your mind
Keep on going til you're gone
Even when you when you think it's wrong
When you look back in regret
The moment that you left

[Chorus:]
Change your mind
Baby don't come back this time
Don't wanna have to say goodbye
All over again
So if you think there's still a chance to make it right
And I'm the only one you want tonight
Change your mind
Change your mind

[Verse 2:]
In the early morning haze
When my kiss is all you crave
Let it go
Cause I don't wanna do that dance
The push and pull, the second chance
I already know
Yeah, I know
You'll just promise me forever
And then you'll take it back just like that
Say you can't live without me, then you'll 

[Chorus:]
Change your mind
Baby don't come back this time
Don't wanna have to say goodbye
All over again
So if you think there's still a chance to make it right
Change your mind
Change your mind
Change your mind
