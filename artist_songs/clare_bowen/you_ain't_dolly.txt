You ain't dolly 
You ain't porter
She’s a little bit fuller
Yeah? Well you’re a whole lot shorter
Let’s dance all night and fill the juke box full a quarters
Coz you ain't Dolly
No? and you ain't porter

I noticed you right of the back in them cowboy boots 
Who couldn’t help but see you in that rhinestone suit 
Well that’s coz I’m the reigning queen of karaoke night 
Well if I get drunk enough to sing hell I just might 
But hey now don’t you worry cowboy coz I’ll get your through 
We’ll sing a cheating song just like they used to do 

Coz you ain't Dolly 
And you ain't Porter
She’s a little bit fuller
Oh sweetheart you’re a whole lot shorter
Let’s drink all night and fill the juke box full a quarters
Coz you ain't Dolly
No and you ain't Porter

You’ll probably see me country singing on the voice some day 
Yeah and I’m the guy they wrote about in 50 shades of grey
Why don’t you come on back to my place and you can have your way
Baby that sounds tempting but I just can’t stay
Oh oh we won first prize cowboy let’s just split the dough
Honey I will always love you but we’ll never know

Coz you ain't Dolly 
Babe you ain't no Porter
She’s a little bit fuller
And you’re a damn sight shorter

We danced all night and filled the juke box full a quarters
Coz you ain't Dolly
And you ain't Porter
no no 
You ain’t Dolly 
No and you ain’t Porter
