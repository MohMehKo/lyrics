You were the first to ever hold my candle
Picked up the flag when I just could not handle it
You were the only one that I ever trust to walk me home
You knew me long before I knew myself
From far away without a word you heard my cry for help
And from my knees you carried me all the way back home
Time has turned the tables on us both
No you're not alone

Fight on, fight on little brother
With the power and the grace of our mother
Fight on, fight on little brother
With the calm and strength of our father
When you growing tired and you wearing thin
That's when love steps in

You were the first to ever really listened
Picked up my shield when I had trouble lifting it
Now let me be the one that hold your hand and guide you home

Fight on, fight on little brother
With the power and the grace of our mother
Fight on, fight on little brother
With the calm and strength of our father
When you grow tired and you wearing thin
That's when love steps in
Love steps in
Love steps in
Love steps in
Love steps in

Fight on, fight on little brother
With the power and the grace of our mother
Fight on, fight on little brother
With the calm and strength of our father

Fight on, fight on little brother
With the power and the grace of our mother
Fight on, fight on little brother
With the calm and strength of our father

When you grow tired and you wearing thin
When you grow tired and you wearing thin
That's when love steps in
