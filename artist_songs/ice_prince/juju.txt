Badman

[Hook]
Everytime I see myself
I de feel like say na juju de worry me
I no fit explain everything
I de feel what I feel like mumu de worry me

Somebody pray for me
Cause every little thing I do
And every little thing I try
Somebody pray for me
Badman envy the way
They wan make me a cry

Somebody pray for me
Cause every little thing I do
And every little thing I try
Somebody pray for me
Badman envy the way
They wan make me a cry

[Verse 1]
Okay
Yeah
I no fit chop food keep plate
Can even ball cause the haters want me to deflate
Whatever I do, they search for the mistake
Some of them say that my album is worse than a mixtape
Some of them smile, when they face me
Some of them swear with their lives that they hate me
Fake friends they pretend with their smileys
Yellow and white everytime they reply me
But that’s bullshit
Me I’m on some new shit
If you got beef for me, chop it up, deuces
Cause no time for you hater-ation
I got busy days going for the federation
Number one homie
That’s me homie
If e de pain you go chop bee homie
I’m complete
Your whole street know me
I brought paint to the big ass me Tony

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
These days all the people wey you call friends
Chuuck hand for you eye and they no send
Life’s a bitch and everybody screws you
Have my over nails to your head, I de do you
The more you grow up
And get more famous
The more they treat you like shit to your own anus
And if you fly too much, they turn terrorist
And if you try to shine too bright, they turn eclipse
Some of y’all really showed love way back
Damn, now you hating my success
How the fuck am I supposed to relate that
Huh
Am I supposed to be upset
But see homie
I got kicks so fly, Jet Li homie
I’ll be milking the game, no tea homie
Quit bothering the dog, so flee homie
You can’t feed on me
You ain't shit

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I de ponder
Why e be say na me God de wonder
I started my career with a honda
Too fly and I’m neva going under
So don’t bother

[Bridge x3]
Brother you see
If you wish me well, I go wish you well oh
Brother you see
If you wish me fire, then go to hell oh

[Hook x2]
