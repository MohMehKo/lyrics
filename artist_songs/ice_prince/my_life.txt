[Verse 1:]
Lagos Port Harcourt
For everywhere the women don dey like us
For everywhere niggas don dey bite us
We no be the same brother Yankee no be Cyprus
Look around me look around you (yebba)
In the name of jehova I bind you (yebba)
People carry my matter for high court
Say my indomie I don dey package am with titus

[Bridge:]
See my jehova e dey bless my days
Smile like say I want to text my date
Find my space and I go close my gate
No bad nigga go dey own my gate
Say na too much money I dey loan my mate
Light my cigger and I bone my face
Hustle all day and I go own my state
No bad nigga ever come my way

[Hook x2]

[Interlude]

[Verse 2:]
Okay
See this nigga here no be juju no be medicine
My sky stays blue like say I be Radisson
Black boy riding the city of madison
On the bench mark like say I be Alex ferguson
I bin dey play but now I don dey serious
Alaba dey para say na genius
Omota for yabba don dey bully us
Omo no be joke I don dey travel with Julius

[Bridge:]
Bless my paddi if you think am great
Rap my shit and I go sing like drake
Chop bellefull I no dey lose my weight
Sleep past four and I resume by eight
Say na too much money Au revoir, Bonjour
Bad man come and I go try kungfu
Wanchan guy I no dey down my crew
Anywhere they party me I must come through
