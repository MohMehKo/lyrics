Ah two thousand and four Bolaji was the main guy
My nigga no dey ever comot with the same tie
Fly nigga, cool Cat wey dey make friends
If Bolaji no dey the club, the party no dey make sense
In two thousand and five Bolaji don dey finish school
The graduation party bad, omo pretty cool
See the girl, them a dress like Beyonce
If Bolaji na your padi, e mean say you belong shey?
In two thousand and eight Bolaji don dey come Lag
He don dey roll among the niggas wey dey form swag
He don dey chill among the niggas wey dey pop pass
Last thing wey I hear was he was buried in a compound
Damn

All of a sudden Lizzy dey nack all the towns men
Last thing wey I hear na Lizzy burial announcement
