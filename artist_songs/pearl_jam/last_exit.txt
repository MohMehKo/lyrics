lives opened and trashed..."look ma, watch me crash"...
no time to question...why'd nothing last...
grasp and hold on...we're dyin' fast...
soon be over...and i will relent...
let the ocean swell, dissolve 'way my past
three days, and maybe longer
won't even know i've left
under your tongue...i'm like a tab...
i will give you what...you're not sposed to have...
under my breath...i swear by sin...
for better or for worse...a best we began...
let the sun climb, oh, burn 'way my mask
three days, and maybe longer
shed my skin at last...shed...shed...
let the sun shine, burn 'way my mask
three days, and maybe longer
won't ever find me here
let the ocean dissolve 'way my past
four days, and not much longer...
let my spirit pass...
this is, this is...
this is, this is...
this is, this is...
my...last exit
