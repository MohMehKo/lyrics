he won the lottery when he was born
took his mothers white breast to his tongue
trained like dogs, color and smell
walks by me to get to him
police man
police man
he won the lottery by being born
big hand slapped a white male american
do no wrong, so clean cut...
dirty his hands, it comes right off
police man
police man
police stopped my brother again
police stopped my brother again
police stopped my brother again
police man 
police man 
jesus greets me...looks just like me...
do no wrong, so clean cut
dirty his hands, it comes right off
police man

police stopped my brother again
police stopped my brother again
police stopped my brother again

all my pieces set me free...human devices set me free...

human devices set me free... 
all my pieces set me free... 
human devices set me free...
