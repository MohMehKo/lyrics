Everyone's a critic looking back up the river
Every boat is leaking in this town
Everybody is thinking they can all be delivered sitting in a box like lost and found

But I found my place and it's all right
We're all searching for a better way
Get this off my plate
It's all right, I got my own way to believe

Find a lighthouse in the dark stormy weather
We all could use a sedative right now
Holy rollers sitting with their backs to the middle all alone and sinking is the bow

And if you want to have to pray, it's all right
We all be thinking with our different brain get this off my plate
It's all right, I got my own way to believe, it's okay

Sometimes you find yourself having to put all your faith in no faith
Mine is mine and yours won't take it's place
Now, make your getaway
Science says we're making love like the lizards
Try and say that fossils ain't profound
Simon says we're not allowed to consider
Simon says stand up sit down you're out

But I found my place
And it's all right, I'm bearing witness to some better things, get this off my plate
It's all right, I've got my own way to believe
It's okay, sometimes you find yourself being told to change your ways
There's no way, mine is mine and yours won't take it's place, now make your getaway

It's okay, sometimes you find yourself having to put all your faith in no faith
Mine is mine and yours won't take it's place
Now make your getaway, it's okay
Sometimes you find yourself being told to change your ways
For God's sake, mine is mine and yours won't take it's place

Now, make your getaway
Now, make your getaway
