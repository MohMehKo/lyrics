You ever hear the story of Mr. Faded Glory?
Say he who rides a pony must someday fall
I've was talkin' to my alter, says "Life is what you make it,
And if you make it death well rest your soul away, away, away"

It's a broken kind of feeling, she'll have to tie me to the ceiling
A bad moon's comin', better say your prayers
I wanna tell you that I love you, but does it really matter?
I just can't stand to see you dragging down again, again, again

So I'm singing, this is my kinda love
It's the kind that moves on
It's the kind that leaves you alone, yeah
Oh this is my kinda love
It's the kind that moves on
It's the kind that leaves me alone

I used to treat you like a lady, now you're my substitute teacher
This bottle's not a pretty, not a pretty sight
I owe the man some money, so I'm turnin' over honey
Ah, Mr. Faded Glory is once again doin' time, oh yeah

This is my kinda love
It's the kind that moves on
It's the kind that leaves me alone
This is my kinda love
It's the kind that moves on
It's the kind that, it's the kind that
Leaves me alone

Like a crown of thorns
It's all who you know
So don't burn your bridges,
'Cause someday, yeah

So I'm singing
This is my kinda love
It's the kind that moves on
It's the kind that leaves you alone, yeah
This is my kinda love
It's the kind that moves on
It's the kind that, leaves me alone

Don't burn your bridges, woman
