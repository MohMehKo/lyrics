Can't know what's high
'Til you've been down so low
The future's bright,
Lit up with nowhere to go,
To and fro the pendulum throws

We are here and then we go
My shadow left me long ago

Understand what we don't know
This might pass
This might last
This may grow
Easy come and easy go
Easy left me a long time ago

I'm in the fire but I'm still cold
Nothing works works for me anymore

Ah ah ah ah ah
To and fro the pendulum throws
To and fro the pendulum throws

To and fro
To and fro
