When I was told
You lied to me
I hung my head in shame
When I was told
That you were cheating me
I bit my lip in pain

So, back up
Back away
And you'd better go
Just for a little while
We'll do it one more time
Just for a little while

So, back up
Back far away
And you'd better go
Just for a little while
We'll do it one more time
Just for a little while
