I've had my share of my bad times
I've been shooting them up, drinking them down
Taking them pills, fooling around all my life
But I'm so tired of bad times, I have to change my ways

And I've had my share of good times
I've been moving around, living uptown
Having my ass up, almost every night
But I'm so sore from laughing, I haven't got the will to fight

All my life I have been waiting to find a reason
To give up or do it back oh every day of my life
I'm going to wake up every morning, do do, do do, lu
Home every evening, do do, do do, lu
Just jump into bed and lie there and laugh with my wife

Well, I've had my share of bad times
I've been shooting them up, drinking them down
Taking them pills, fooling around all my life
But I am so tired of bad times, I'll have to change my ways

And I've had my share of good times
I've been moving around, living uptown
Having my ass up, almost every night
But I'm so tired of laughing, I haven't got the will to fight
