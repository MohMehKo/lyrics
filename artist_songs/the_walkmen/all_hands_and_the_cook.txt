Break my back out in the yard
If you don't like it
Won't you tell me?
Work all day and in the night
Later on
Can I help it?

And by the way, it won't last
The rain will come, the summer's passed

Three shots fired to call us back
You were lost
When I found you

After all, you promised me
A broken nose, a twisted knee

Stop talking to the neighbor's dog!
I've got a temper and it's late
Break all the windows in my car!
Burn down the room when I'm asleep
Break out the bottles when I go
I'll dig a hole for all your friends!

You don't like it
Won't you tell me
You don't like it

By the way, it won't last
The rain will come, the summer's passed
