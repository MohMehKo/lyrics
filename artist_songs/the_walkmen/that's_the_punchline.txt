I know that you're superstitious
That you follow glamor
You're so caught up, they push you around
I knock them down
Because I see, it's easy to be so blind
When you say remember its face
It's not so bad
I say it 'cause it's true
That's the change of style
You're eccentric when you smile
That's the change of style
We could catch you but you're always changing

That's the punch line, that's the way it should be
And that's the last time you'll ever hear it from me
That's the punch line

How come in all of your fashion
Magazines and people, they always look so mean
I know, I'm going down
And I'm rolling over
I'm sick of that cynical kind of humor
Remember this world
It's not so bad, it's coming after you

That's the punch line, that's the way it should be
And that's the last time you'll ever hear it from me
That's the punch line

That's the change of style
You're eccentric when you smile
That's the change of style
When we laugh, it's 'cause we're laughing with you
