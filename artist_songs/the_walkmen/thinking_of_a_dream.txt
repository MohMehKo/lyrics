I'm waiting on a subway line
I'm waiting for a train to arrive
I'm thinking of a dream I had
I'm waiting for a train to arrive

Maybe you're right

We're gonna have a good time tonight
When you're coming around
You'll be sorry for the plans we made
When you're coming around
You'll be sorry for the things you said so
Don't lead me on
Don't lead me on
Don't lead me on
Don't
Don't

And when you're coming around
You'll be sorry for the things you said
Because no one speaks to me that way and me
I'll be hanging from the ceiling fan, waiting on

I'm waiting on a subway line
I'm waiting for a train to arrive
I'm thinking of a dream I had
I'm waiting for a train to arrive
