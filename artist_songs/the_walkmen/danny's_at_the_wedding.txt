I don't know where the evening's gone
The celebration's almost done
But I wasn't done
I wasn't done

Meet you down across the street
But somehow no one waited up for me
See the city sleeping
No one here is leaving

Let's go out and grab a drink
Yeah, I'll take care of everything
That's not saying much
It all was such a mess

Get stuck with the barmaid
I never saw you leave
I hope you've found what you were looking for

Know just how you're feeling
I don't know where you went
Danny's at the wedding, again
Danny's at the wedding, again

And if I'm given half a chance
I think I'd do it all again
'Cause I wasn't done
I wasn't done

The bird I have in my hands
Went back in the bush again
You caught me off my guard
It eats me inside out
He's walking out before its over

Trying to remember
Why the kids went home
One last call and everyone was gone

I really tried my best
I really tried my best
Never saw you leaving
Don't know where you went

Danny's at the wedding, again
