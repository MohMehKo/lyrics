Maybe it's not good and it's not bad
And maybe that's a problem that we have
Cuz everybody knows
I've seen you with your new boyfriend it's funny how you look at him I
Know we won't be seeing him again
Cuz everybody knows, that's the way it goes
Your monday morning train takes you uptown
Your friday evening bus brings you back down
So here's what they're saying
I'm sincerely yours.
