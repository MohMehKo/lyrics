Many rivers to cross
But I just can't seem to find my way over
Wandering I am lost
As I travel along white cliffs of Dover
Many rivers to cross
And it's all in my mind
Keeps me alive
Well I've been licked washed up for years
And I merely survied cause of my pride

And this loneliness won't leave me alone
It's such a drag to be on your own
My woman left me and she didn't say why
And I guess, and I guess I have to try, try

And this loneliness won't leave me alone
It's such a drag to be on your own
My woman left me and she didn't say why
And I guess, and I guess I have to try, try

Many rivers to cross
But just where to begin?
I'm playing for time
There have been times I've found myself
Sitting in limbo, oh no, oh no,
For a lifetime
Many rivers to cross
And I just can't seem to find my way over
Wandering I am lost
As I travel along white cliffs of Dover
