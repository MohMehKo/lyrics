There's mansions on the street
There's gardens in the gates
We sat up through the night for nothing
Falling down the stairs
Falling down
When all the lights are going off

I'm getting out of here
Some don't run, dear
some don't run, without me
It must have been a dream or something else

Should we call this off?
Should we try to laugh?
And will we make it out of here?
I was always after you until you started after me
Always after you until you started after me. 

And all in all
Where your debts gonna fall, yes, you will
So throw your papers in the air
'Cause I got paid anyway

Should we call this off? 
Should we try to laugh?
And will we make it out of here?
I was always after you until you started after me
Always after you until you started after me

And on and on
I see someone has got it in for me 
On and on
I see someone that's got it in for me
