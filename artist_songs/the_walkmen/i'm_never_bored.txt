My weekdays
So busy its my schedule
Well giving in my apartments just as full
Those ceilings and white unforgiving walls
And now thatâ€™s rigid than the days lined on my calendar
As subways trains they roll
me home late its hard to keep proper intervals of sleep
I like it thou

My weekends
I travel as I visit friends
Sometimes I go out sometimes I stay in
Its too late to change my self
Its only in the humor
In a story I recall
I mimic with my arms as I
Exaggerate a joke
Oh where I go

Its only in this drama
In a story I recall
I mimic with my arms as I
Exaggerate the plot

I go to
Unhook the vcr
Cable and
The bath of massive tangled grey & black
And turn across to somewhere in the back
I'm leaning over down behind the TV stand a radiated pause
A hissing line and stranded as
Spits among the dust
I give up
