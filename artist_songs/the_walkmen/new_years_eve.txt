The music's loud, in your room, turn it down
There's a neighbor who can't take it any more
I'll take your hand, in another one night stand
There's a lot for us to figure out 

So if this is how it ends, well lock the door behind you then and let me down easy 

The music's loud in your room turn it down, but the more we talk, the less we understand
