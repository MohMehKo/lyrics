For everyone…
And sleeping at night.
And you’re good enough.
I’m not gonna eat it.
You wear yourself out.
You’re talking backwards.
You wear yourself out.
You wear yourself out… out.

I thought I was too high.
I fall so low that now I,
I learn
Breaking out the room/break another room/get another room
I learn
Everything’s okay.

Call in the coast guard.
We’re going under
Sooner or later.
They’re going under
On the edges,
They’re going to burn now
Sooner or later.

You can
Mess around my head.
Hold on.
And then tomorrow night
We’ll sleep as on the right.

If this bird gets us home
I’ll never fly again.
And then, I learn
…another room
Hang on
