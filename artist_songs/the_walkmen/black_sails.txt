Black sails in the moonlight
Black patch on your eye
You shiver your timbers, baby
And I'll shiver mine
A treasure map is hidden
On your legs
Your veins are very close
Some day I'll wrap my big yardarms
Around your legs and sail away
I'll bury my heart on some island
And take you there someday to find it
I want you, I need you, I love you
No other man will ever reap your rays

Well you're so veiny
You probably think this map belongs to you
But I'm so crazy, what can I do?
So raise the anchor up
Hoist the canvas
Sail me to my heart
