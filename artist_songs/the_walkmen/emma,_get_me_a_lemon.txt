Emma get me a lemon
And if there are none
Get me a lime
And if we got none
Go out and get some
I'm gonna wait here
By your french door

And you ask me to come over
And its all coming together
There's so many ways we can take our time

And you tell me not to worry
Don't you ever think about it
I got so many ways to waste our time

Go let the dog in
I hear him scratchin'
Against the kitchen wall
Go let the dog in
I hear him howling
I got a feeling
It'll be all night

And you ask me to come over
And its all coming together
There's so many ways we can waste our time

And you tell me not to worry
Don't you ever think about it
It's a long way home, let's enjoy the ride
