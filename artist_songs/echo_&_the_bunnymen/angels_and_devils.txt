Call it a day
When night becomes our mad escape
Forgetting the things you mean to say
When all the right words come too late and
Everything falls out of place
Under the pillow
Out of the race
Out of the window

Devils on my shoulder

So, so happy
When happiness spells misery
And mister me hoping to be
Where ugliness meets beauty
Hope if you'll see
The demon in you
The angel in me
The jesus in you
The devil in me

Angels on my shoulder

Call it a day
When night becomes our bad escape
Forgetting the things you mean to say
When all the right words come too late and
Everything falls out of place
Under the pillow
Out of the race
Out of the window

Devils on my shoulder

So, so happy
When happiness spells misery
And mister me hoping to be
Where ugliness meets beauty
And if you see'll see the demon in you
The angel in me
The jesus in you
The devil in me

The demon's in you
The devil's in me
Devil on my shoulder
Angels coming closer
