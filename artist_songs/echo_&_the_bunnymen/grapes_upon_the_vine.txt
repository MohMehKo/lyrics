I’ve been kneeling… to a power up above…
As the ceiling… crashes down on all I love…
You’ve been singing… singing all the songs I gave…
You’ve been digging… you’ve been digging me a grave

And it’s one for the money, and it’s two for the snow…
And it’s me getting buried, and it’s you down below

Better the devil I thought I knew
I met the devil, the devil was you
I loved the devil, the devil in you
And the devils in who?

I’ve been tasting… all the grapes upon the vine…
I’ve been wasting… I’ve been wasting all your time…
You’ve been tasting… all the grapes upon my vine…
You’ve been wasted… you’ve been wasting all my time

And it’s one for the money, and it’s two for the snow…
And it’s me getting buried, and it’s you down below

Better the devil I thought I knew
I met the devil, the devil was you
I loved the devil, the devil in you
And the devils in who?
The devil in you
The devil in you
The devil in you
The devil in you

I’ve been drinking… I’ve been sinking raising toasts…
I’ve been thinking… thinking how to raise the ghosts…
That keep haunting… keep on haunting from the deep…
I’ve been walking… I’ve been walking in my sleep

The devil’s in you
