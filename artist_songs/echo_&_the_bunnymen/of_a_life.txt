Is this how the end begins?
Infra-reds and ultra-violets
No one there to mend your wings
flown by unconscious pilot

Tell me I'm not seein' things
Say it's love I've sighted
I wanna song to learn and sing
of a love requited.

This is where the beggin' ends
No more Trevi fountains
No more kneelin', no more bends
No more jumpin' off the mountain

Tell me I'm not seein' things
Say it's love I've sighted
I wanna song to learn and sing
of a life requited.

Of a life requited
Of a life requited
Of a life requited

No more champs and childish things
No more time for waistin'
now its time to find the things
I'm forever chasin'

Tell me I'm not seein' things
Say it's love I've sighted
I wanna song to learn and sing
of a life requited.

Tell me I'm not seein' things
Say it's love I've sighted
wanna song to learn and sing
of a love requited.

Of a life requited
Of a life requited
Of a love requited
Of a life requited
Of a life requited
