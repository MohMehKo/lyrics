Ungainly thing
Unworthy soul
To have to hold
To terrorize

Unsightly love
Unchecked unchanged
A love deranged
In thin disquise

All in a good cause 
I suppose
'Come as you like 
As a lifetime goes

A thick skinned world
Will feign concern
For reasons we 
Have still to learn

Preserve the world
For baby's sake
For baby must 
Accumulate

All in a good cause
I suppose
'Come as you like
As a lifetime goes

Chances have been wasted
Thrown to the wind
Grist to the mill
Gall is all I've tasted

Come away, come away
Come away, come away
Come away, come away

All in a good cause
I suppose
'Come as you like
As a lifetime goes

All in a good cause
I suppose
'Come as you like
As a lifetime goes
As a lifetime goes
As a lifetime goes
As a lifetime goes
