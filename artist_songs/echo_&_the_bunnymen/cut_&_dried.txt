You've seen enough
You've been too much
You've gone too far

And when thine lie offends
Thee prop against the bar
You awkward stage
As you approach middle age
Hard to take
Hard to gauge

So goodbye cut and dry
Nice to have known you
But something went awry
And I've outgrown you

I slither awhile
Before I shed my skin
And laugh when you said
There was no such thing as sin
No, no there is no greater me
The lad inspired by total greed

'til it breaks
'til it bleeds

So goodbye cut and dry
Nice to have known you
But something went awry
And I've outgrown you

And all your confidence
Has gathered dust on shelves
And all those who lent an ear
Heard no good of themselves
No market here for sound advice
And those who seek must pay the price
Blood from stone
Blood of christ

So goodbye cut and dry
Nice to have known you
But something went awry
And I've outgrown you
