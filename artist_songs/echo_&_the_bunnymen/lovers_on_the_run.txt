Rising tides dying suns
Wasted times for lovers on the run…
Left behind by things to come
Swept aside… like lovers on the run

Here it comes… your next today
Resetting all the bones you broke along the way
There it goes… your last morrow
Forgetting all the memories you weren’t supposed to know

Rising tides dying suns
Wasted times for lovers on the run…
Left behind by things to come
Swept aside… like lovers on the run

Here it comes my destiny…
Never really knowing what’s still left in me
There it goes my history…
In the blinking of an eye the worst and best in me…

Rising tides burning sun
Wasted times for lovers on the run…
Left behind by things to come
Swept aside… like lovers on the run

Lovers on the run
Lovers on the run
Lovers on the run
Lovers on the run

Rising tides burning sun
Wasted times for lovers on the run…
Swept aside by things to come
Left behind… like lovers on the run

Rising tides burning sun
Wasted times for lovers on the run…
Swept aside by things to come
Left behind… like lovers on the run (like lovers on the run)
Like lovers on the run (like lovers on the run)
Like lovers on the run (like lovers on the run)
Like lovers on the run
Lovers on the run (lovers on the run)
