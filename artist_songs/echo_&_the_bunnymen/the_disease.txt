My life's the disease
That could always change
With comparative ease
Just given the chance
My life is the earth
'Twixt muscle and spade
I wait for the worth
Digging for just one chance

As prospects diminish
As nightmares swell
Some pray for heaven
While we live in hell
My life's the disease
My life's the disease

If you get yours from heaven
Don't waste them
If you get yours from heaven
Don't waste them
If you get yours from heaven
