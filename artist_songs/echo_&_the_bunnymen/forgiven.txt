I'm just one of many 
Gave a love in vain 
Sold it out for pennies 
Saved up all my reign (rain) 

What do you want from me 
The ocean or the sea 
The salt inside the rising tide 
Tears you got from me 
Got from me
Got from me, yeah 

One day I'll be ready 
To take what could be mine 
Everything I'd buried 
I lay out on the line 

What d'you want to see 
The truth or mystery 
A blinding light, a blackest night
They're both inside of me 
Inside me
Inside me, yeah 

I'm just one of many 
Took a love in vain 
Sold it out for pennies 
Saved up all my reign (rain) 

What d'you want from me 
The truth or mystery 
The salt inside the rising tide 
Tears you got from me 
Got from me
Got from me, yeah 

I don't want to be forgiven 
All I want is to be free 
I know I'll never be forgiven 
I know I'll never be free
