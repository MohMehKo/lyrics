Who's been sleeping in my head
I know for sure it was not me
All those things I             and
All those things I couldn't see

In between now and the memory
Another you and another me

Sick suck sack
I want my reason back
And tell me how do you fall so low
Beaten off the ever beaten track
And where did all the hours go

In between now and the coming moon
Another me and another you
And it's my turn
And it's my turn
And it's my turn

Now yeah now yeah
Now yeah now yeah

Oooh, aaah, oooh, aaah

Who's been sleeping in my head
I know for sure it wasn't me
All those things I             and
All those things I couldn't see

In between now and the memory
Another you and another me

And it's my turn
And it's my turn
And it's my turn

Now yeah now yeah
Now yeah now yeah
Aaah, oooh
Underneath another god
Could've believed in you
Underneath another sky
Could've believed in me

Underneath another god
Could've believed in you
Underneath another sky
Could've believed in me
Underneath another god
Underneath another god
Underneath another god
