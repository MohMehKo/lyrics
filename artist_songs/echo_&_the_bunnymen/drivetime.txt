If we ride ride ride
Rider come on to the other side
Floating and floating on the night tide
Just beyond where the sun dies

If we fly fly fly
Fly with me now over oceans wide
Higher than heaven, higher than the sky
You, me and God can watch the sun rise
Baby c'mon, baby c'mon

Drivetime
On the drivetime
On the drivetime
Driving by

If we ride ride ride
Where the mist takes us
In a rising tide
Makes us and breaks us there's no-one to guide
Spirits following the blind

If we fly fly fly
Will it take us up too high-high
A prayer and no wings just a why why?
We can't see the skyline for the sky
Baby c'mon, baby c'mon

Oh, o-oh, o-oh, o-oh

Ride ride ride
Ride ride ride
To the sunrise
Baby c'mon, baby c'mon

Drive time

Oh, o-oh, o-oh, o-oh
