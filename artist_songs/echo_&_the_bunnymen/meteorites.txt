Hope… where is the hope in me?
Can it be found… among all the ghosts in me?
Smoke… choking the fire in me…
Will I be found… by someone close to me?

Life’s lost soldiers on the march
Leaving their trenches now…
Nights got cold as life got dark
Freezing the senses now

Lies… I promised you meteorites…
Would form in your eyes…
My comets would treat you right…
Birth… worth being born to see…
Life take it’s toll… cursed by mortality…

Life’s lost soldiers on the march
Leaving their trenches now…
Nights got cold as life got dark
Freezing the senses now

Can it be found… can it be found?
Please be found, please be found, please be found
Please be found… please be found
Please be found, please be found, please be found

Life’s lost soldiers on the march
Leaving their trenches now…
Nights got cold as life got dark
Freezing the senses now

Life’s lost soldiers on the march
Leaving their trenches now…
Nights got cold as life got dark
Freezing the senses now
