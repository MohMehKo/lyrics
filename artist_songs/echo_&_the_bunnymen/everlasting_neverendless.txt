Everlasting neverendless
Moments lost in time
Every last thing they can send us
Will be yours and mine and mine and mine

Don't look down
Don't look down
Don't look down

See this through or we could watch it die
Me and you, saying our last goodbye
Goodbye babe, goodbye baby goodbye

Hear us calling
Ever crying
Wonder when it stops

Don't look down
Don't look down
Don't look down

See this through or we could watch it die
Me and you, saying our last goodbye
Goodbye babe, goodbye baby goodbye
Goodbye babe, goodbye baby goodbye

See this through, see this through
Me and you, me and you
Me and you, see this through
Me and you, me and you
