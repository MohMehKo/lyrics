I’ve been where you are
Ascending to dizzy heights
I’ve seen how the stars
Can light up the darkest nights

Flew too close to the sun
Before I’d become
What can’t be undone

I know how the sky
Makes you believe anything
I’ve flown where you fly
Thought I’d grown angel’s wings

Flew too close to the sun
Before I’d become
What can’t be undone

Burn it down, burn it down
Burn it down, burn it down
Burn it down, burn it down
Burn it down, burn it down
Burn it down
Burn it down
Burn it down
Burn it down

I’ve been where you are
Ascending to dizzy heights
I’ve seen how the stars
Can light up the darkest night

Flew too close to the sun
Before I’d become
What can’t be undone

Burn it down, burn it down
Burn it down, burn it down
Burn it down, burn it down
Burn it down, burn it down
Burn it down
Burn it down
Burn it down (put your fingers in the fire)
Burn it down (put your fingers in the fire)
Burn it down (put your fingers in the fire)
Burn it down (put your fingers in the fire)
Burn it down (put your fingers in the fire)
Burn it down (put your fingers in the fire)
Burn it down
