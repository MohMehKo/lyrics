Flying
And you know I'm not coming down
You're trying
But you know you must soon go down
All my colours
Turn to clouds
All my colours
Turn to cloud

Zimbo zimbo zimbo zimbo zimbo
Zimbo zimbo zimbo zimbo zimbo
Zimbo zimbo zimbo zimbo zimbo
Zimbo zimbo zimbo zimbo zimbo

What d'you say
When your heart's in pieces
How to play
Those cards in sequence
That box you gave me
Burned nicely
That box you gave me
Burned nicely

Zimbo zimbo zimbo zimbo zimbo
Zimbo zimbo zimbo zimbo zimbo
Zimbo zimbo zimbo zimbo zimbo
Zimbo zimbo zimbo zimbo zimbo

Flying down
Flying down

All my colours
Turn to clouds
All my colours
Turn to cloud

Hey I'm flowing
Hey I'm flowing
That box you gave me
Burned nicely
That box you gave me
Burned nicely
Hey I've flown away
Hey I've flown away
All my colours
