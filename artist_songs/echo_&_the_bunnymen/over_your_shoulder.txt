Over your shoulder
I'm here
The face on your head looks older
We're here

Never gonna change
Never gonna disappear
Stars shine down on me tonight
Doors close tight

Day of departure
Is near
Ears on your head 
Don't hear

Never gonna change
Never gonna disappear
Stars shine down on me tonight
Doors close tight

Victims fall
Ghosts descend
You get scared and I'll defend
I don't really care but I'll pretend
The good and bad right to the end

Look in the cellar
We're here
I've been meaning to tell you
I'm here

Never gonna change
Never gonna disappear
Stars shine down on me tonight
Doors close tight

Victims fall
Ghosts descend
You get scared and I'll defend
I don't really care but I'll pretend
The good and bad right to the end

Never gonna change
Never gonna disappear
