All the world is sleeping
I can close my eyes
What's the darkness keeping
One more time to die
I want to be redeemed
I need a new surprise

Feeling good for nothing
Tastes like solid rain
Feel the same as you
Say you feel the same

I got it
I got it good
On my white knuckle life
Oh yeah, if only I could
Get out the other side

In my nightmares
I'm the nightmare

You're like a nightmare
In my mind
You're like a nightmare

Hell's the shelter
The freak show's inside
I'm the mirrorball
You're the dying light

I got it
I got it good
On my white knuckle life
Oh yeah, if only I could
Find somewhere else to hide

I got it
I got it good
On my white knuckle life
Oh yeah, if only I could
Get out the other side
