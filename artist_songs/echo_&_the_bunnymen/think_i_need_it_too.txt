Must have forgotten something
How to forget how to be true
Covered myself in numb things
Don't touch me, and I won't touch you

Trying to remember something
Why am I here? And who are you?
You must have meant something
Animals came in two by two

Whatever you want
Whatever you need
Whatever you want
Whatever you need
Think I need it too
I think I need it too
I think I need it too

Just as I thought I'm thinking
How can I change when I don't want to
Kept getting caught kept drinking
How can I blame what I've got to
Putting the wheels in motion
Auto-pilot, I can't drive
Covered in calomine lotion
Scratching my heatlumps bee-stung hives

Whatever you want
Whatever you need
Whatever you want
Whatever you need
Think I need it too
I think I need it too
I think I need it too

Whatever you want
Whatever you need
Whatever you want
Whatever you need

Whatever you want
Whatever you need
Whatever you want
Whatever you need
Think I need it too
I think I need it too
I think I need it too
I think I need it too
I think I need it too
