Will you walk through my storm
Can I be your one and only
Will you talk me through 'till dawn
Never felt so lost and lonely

When night turns into morning
And you don't know how long you must wait
As life came without warning
Your destiny will come too late

In the pool of my life
Kissing the ground that made me
Ancient rules wrong from right
Wish I'd found you when you could save me

When night turns into morning
And you don't know how long you must wait
As life came without warning
Your destiny will come too late

Can it ever be the same
Will we ever dream again
Walk through the sweet, sweet pain of love

No one ever broke the bough
the cradle fell anyhow
There's angels in the thunder clouds, above

When night turns into morning
And you don't know how long you must wait
As life came without warning
Your destiny will come too late

Kiss the ground...
