You said you could make it disappear
Make my pathway clean and clear
You said I was just a touch away
But I'm not even close
No, nowhere near
You said you could make it disappear
Make my pathway clean
And my pathway clear

How d'you want to go?
Should we go together?
I don't want to go
Gonna live forever
Live forever

Shadows in the fog are moving in
From the world outside
To my world within
I'm sucking on the dust that moves the air
The pieces move
But I'm still there
Shadows in the fog are moving in
From the world outside
To my world within

How d'you wanna go?
Calm or stormy weather
If we've got to go
Let's go together
Together

You said you could make it disappear
Make my pathway clean and clear
You said I was just a touch away
But I'm not even close
No, I'm nowhere near
You said you could make it disappear
Make my pathway clean
And my pathway clear

How d'you want to go?
Should we go together?
I don't want to go
Gonna live forever
Live forever

Live forever
Live forever
Live forever
