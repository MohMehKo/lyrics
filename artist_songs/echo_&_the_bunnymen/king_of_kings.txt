Met Jesus up on a hill
He confessed I was dressed to kill
Saw fear eternal in his eyes
He's seen what happens when the soul dies

I'm the king of kings
Wearing broken wings
I've lost my crown
The world so far below
And all I really know
Is that you don't look down

Came alive in the dead of night
Sought salvation in the city lights
One more drink then one drink more
Every hour like the one before

I'm the king of kings
Wearing broken wings
I've lost my crown
The world so far below
And all I really know
Is that you don't look down

Don't look down
It's such a long way to fall

Came alive in the dead of night
Sought salvation in the city lights
One more drink then one drink more
Every hour like the one before

You're like me, and I'm like you
Can't see the point in a point of view
All time lows we're hitting the high
Two wrongs tryin' to make it alright

I'm the king of kings
Wearing broken wings
I've lost my crown
The world so far below
And all I really know
Is that you don't look down
