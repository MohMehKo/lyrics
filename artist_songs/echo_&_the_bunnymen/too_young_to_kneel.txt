Who's gonna hold you 
When you're too scared to feel
Who's gonna cure you 
When the pain won't heal
Who's gonna be there 
When the world goes wrong
Who's gonna tell you 
You're the only one

In my blood
In my soul
In this mind of mine
Can your touch
Turn me cold
Make my glitter shine

Who's gonna reach you 
When you can't be caught
Who's gonna teach you 
What you can't be taught
Who's gonna beat you 
When you won't be fought
Who's gonna buy you 
When you can't be bought

In my blood
In my soul
In this mind of mine
Can your touch
Turn me cold
Make my glitter shine

Who's gonna pray for you 
When you're too young to kneel
Who's gonna fake it 
When it gets too real
One more question answered 
In the falling star
I heard they found 
Death on Mars

In my blood
In my soul
In this mind of mine
Can your touch
Turn me cold
Make my glitter shine

In my blood
In my soul
In this mind of mine
Can your touch
Turn me cold
Make my glitter shine

Ah ah ah
La la la
La la la la
La la la li
