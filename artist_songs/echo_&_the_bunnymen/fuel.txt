There is an easier route

Have you had enough
Of your infancy, well?
Would you pass me the bit
Between Heaven and hell?
There’s an easier route
The hypotenuse
By bypassing the tongue
Home and dry and unstuck

Come and get me
I’m coming ready or not
I can learn you
A few minor things
A hymn to learn and sing

Falling over ourselves
Never bothered to choose
Do they laugh at your need?
Are they changing to you?

There’s a book on the floor
Many pages for me
I can fit it too well
Do you know what that means?

Come and get me
I’m coming ready or not
Falling over myself
Getting ahead of you...

Have you had enough
Of your infancy, well?
Are you planning the move
Between Heaven and Hell?

You can teach me
A few major things
Some animal things
Some hymns to learn and sing

Come and get me
I’m coming ready or not.....
