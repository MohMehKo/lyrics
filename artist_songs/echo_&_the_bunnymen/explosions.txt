No!
No sun on the hill has come
And I need to know
How the light goes on
It's so numb
On the tip of my tongue
And I need to know
How the fire goes on

One more round (one more round)
Give one more round (one more round)

Explosions
Always sweet it sounds
Holes blow in the ground
Like the world is falling down

Erosion
Always worse lit down
Follows me around
Till my leaves are turning brown

No hush
You might stare too slow
And I need to know
When my heartbeat's gone
Ain't not much
Neither breath nor hope
And I need to know
How the right is wrong

Give the light back on (light back on)
Light back on (light back on)

Explosions
Always sweet it sounds
Holes blow in the ground
Like the world is falling down
Oceans
Full of cargo bound
The world's a Mach-o-found
Beyond the seas
Where sailors ground

Explosions, explosions, explosions, explode around
Explosions, explosions, explosions, explode around
Give back you want now (what you want)
Give back you can (while you can)
Take back you want now (what you want)
Take back you can (while you can)

No sign that everything
But I need to know
Where I belong
And no sight of a guiding light
I need to know
Where the road has gone

Explosions
Always sweet it sounds
Holes blow in the ground
Like the world is falling down
Oceans
Full of cargo bound
The world's a Mach-o-found
Beyond the seas
Where sailors ground

Devotion
Always wears a crown
Always leaves me down
To pray when me
And my prayers are found

Explosions
Always sweet that sounds
Holes blow in the ground
Like the world is falling down

Explosions, explosions, explosions, explo-oohh-sion
Explosions, explosions, explosions, explo-oohh-sion
Explosion explo-oohh-sion
Explosion explo-oohh-sion
