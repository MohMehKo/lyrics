Bells
High on a hill
History chimes
And you want a new beginning
Tell me
In biro or quill
Your purpose and mine
Prove that our world is spinning
So
Here goes
Nothing better
And
Here's to
Something else

Until tomorrow
But that's another time
It's just another time
It's just some other troubled time

The seed
Grew up a boy
Turned to a man
Is this the world you wanted? 
It seems
Under the soil
Over the sand
Not quite the seed I planted
I've seen you
And now
I know better
I've been you
Now I'm
Someone else

Until tomorrow
But that's another time
It's just another time
It's just some other troubled time

Until
Tomorrow
Until...
