Try to ride it
Try to hide it
Deep inside it

Try to love it
Try to hate it
Try to touch it
But you can't feel

Hit by something
Hit by something
Hit by something
just won't heal

Try to take it
And try to make it
Always break it
When it gets too real

Try to love it
Try to hate it
Try to touch it
But you can't feel

Hit by something
Hit by something
Hit by something
just won't heal

Hey, when you dream tonight
Under the stars above
You'll need a dream tonight
Of vodka
Of vodka
Of vodka

Hit by something
Hit by something
Hit by something
You've forgotten how it feels

Hit by something
Hit by something
Hit by something
I've forgotten how to feel
Feel feel feel
