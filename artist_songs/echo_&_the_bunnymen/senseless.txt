I will not wait, I will not see
The things you crave are lost on me
You took some earth. Gave it a name
You plant a cross and trade the blame

Dyed in the wool and dead of mind
You took your stand. Left sense behind 
You stake it all on a sense of place
And lose your head to save your face

You've had your say 
Close your mouth
If you know the way 
Then point it out
Point it out

The ways and means as yet unclear
I only know where not to steer
I have no plan, but this I know
You're said your peace in God's main goal

You've had your say
Close your mouth
If you know the way
Then point it out
Point it out

All our voices out of tune
All our graveyards full too soon
What's the matter, let it drop
Stupid, senseless, make it stop
Stupid, senseless, make it stop

All our voices out of tune
(I will not wait)
All our graveyards full too soon
(I will not see)
All your money in the bank
(The things you crave)
How it festered, how it stank
(Are lost on me)

Lose a thing you hold dear
(You took some earth)
All our freedoms disappear
(Gave it a name)
What's the matter, let it drop
(You plant a cross)
Stupid, senseless, make it stop
(And trade the blame)

Stupid, senseless, make it stop
Stupid, senseless, make it stop
Stupid, senseless, make it stop
