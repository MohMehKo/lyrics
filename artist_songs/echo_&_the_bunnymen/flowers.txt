I've been laying down the flowers
I've been waiting in the sun
I've been counting down the hours
One by one
One by one

I've been catching my reflection
I'm still looking at someone
Still perfecting imperfection
Like everyone
Every no one

I even saw it come
Knew the hit would run and run
And I, as it came undone
Knew that I'd lost everything
Everything I'd won

Here's to all the things we'll never
Here's to all we could have done
Here's to what became whatever
Whatever web we spun, web we spun

I even saw it come
Knew the hit would run and run
And I, as it came undone
Knew that I'd lost everything
Everything I'd won

I've been laying down the flowers
I've been waiting in the sun
I've been counting down the hours
One by one
One by one 

I even saw it come
Knew the hit would run and run
And I, as it came undone
Knew that I'd lost everything
Everything I'd won
