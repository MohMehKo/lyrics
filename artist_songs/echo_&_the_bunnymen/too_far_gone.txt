Heaven come on
Don't try to catch me
When I fall
I don't belong
You won't even hear me
When I call

Touch down
There's no warning
Just my spirit falling
Falling

Something's wrong
You don't want to hear
The things I know
Too far gone
Gone so far
There's no where left to go

Touch down
There's no warning
Just my spirit falling

Something's wrong
You don't want to hear
The things I know
Too far gone
Gone so far
There's no where left to go

Get me out of the here and now
I want to be another here
Another
Set me up 'cos I know how
It's easy

Sucker-sucker-sucker
Sucker-sucker-sucker
Sucker-sucker-sucker

Shooting stars
Love the way they burn
Inside your eyes
From here to the end
Burning up the cold
And lonely sky

Touch down
There's no warning
Just my spirit falling

Something's wrong
You don't want to hear
The things I know
Too far gone
Gone so far
There's no where left to go

Get me out of the here and now
I want to be another here
Another
Set me up 'cos I know how
It's easy

Sucker-sucker-sucker
Sucker-sucker-sucker
Sucker-sucker-sucker

Heaven come on
Don't try to catch me
When I fall
I don't belong
You won't even hear me
When I call
When I call
When I call
When I call

Something's wrong
You don't want to hear
The things I know
Too far gone
Gone so far
There's no where left to go

Get me out of the here and now
I want to be another here
Another
Set me up 'cos I know how
It's easy

Sucker-sucker-sucker
Sucker-sucker-sucker
Sucker-sucker-sucker
