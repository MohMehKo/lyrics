It's just a dangerous bend
On a slippery slope
Another rainbow's end
On the highway of hope
It's always next time
Always next time
Always last time

Just get me out of this jam
It's stuck to me like glue
And I can't remember who I am
My memory lost on you

I had things inside my head
And they put me behind them
Though they'd be safe in my head
And now I just can't find them

It's just a trick of the light
And some sleight of hand
Another kiss goodnight
Along the rise of man
And it's the last time
It's the last time
Till the next time

So get me out of this jam
It's stuck to me like glue
And I can't remember who I am
My memory lost on you

It's gone and that's too bad
The best thing that I ever had
Had the whole world in my mouth
Ate it up and spat it out
