Polly put the kettle on
I met a man
And asked of them
He told me that
The pound was strong

I knew that bridge was falling
So jimmy put the gas masks on
And swam and swam
Up to the dam
And everyone came along

Don't think we can talk        
making war
Don't think we can risk it
Another heavy biscuit           
Can I beat the count of ten
I'm lying just to stay alive
Dying in my           again
Taken to a dive
Trying to survive

When's it going to take you
And how's it gonna make you feel

You can't even spell it
So how you gonna tell
If it's real? 

A bomb blew up my shelter
I never even felt a thing
I brushed away the dust and
Gave ole jimmy custer a ring

Don't think we can talk        
making war
Don't think we can risk it
Another heavy biscuit           
Can I beat the count of ten
I'm lying just to stay alive
Dying in my           again
Taken to a dive
Trying to survive

I knew that bridge was falling
So jimmy put the gas masks on
And swam and swam
Up to the dam
And everyone came along
