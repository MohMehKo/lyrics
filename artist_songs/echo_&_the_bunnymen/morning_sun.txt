Show me the hole I can fall in
To the ground to the ground to the ground
Speak to me speak and give my calling
'Cause I'm going down going down going down

It's only lies and alibis
Alibis and lies
We know something dies every day

I've lost or I've forgotten
More than I'll ever know
Born just a someone with some kind of nothing
I let it go let it go let it go

It's only lies and alibis
Alibis and lies
We know something dies every day
Here it comes the morning sun
Another hit and run
And we're just the ones in the way

Coming down with you

Give me a hope I can lean on
'cause I'll bend in the calmest winds
Give me one more than dreams for me to dream on
My jury's in coming in coming in
