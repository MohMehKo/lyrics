Everybody knows, how your garden grows
Everybody knows, how your garden grows
Everyone can see, I'm blind as I can be
The woods look just like trees
Look like trees to me

And I don't even get it
I don't know what you're trying to say
You're never gonna let me forget it
It's always gonna get in the way

It's moving much too fast
You know it ain't gonna last
I think we're heading for a crash
Heading for a crash

It's coming to a natural end
I'm going round my last bend
There's something you just can't mend
Things you just can't mend

I can't even remember
I don't know what the day is today
You're putting the no in November
And taking all the be's out of May

Everybody knows, how your garden grows
Everybody knows, how your garden grows
Everyone can see, I'm blind as I can be
The woods look just like trees
Look like trees to me

And I don't even get it
I don't know what you're trying to say
You're never gonna let me forget it
It's always gonna get in the way
