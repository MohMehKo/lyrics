Hide and seek, cloak and find
All the colours in your mind
Tied together, sunday's clown
Traced and feathered, laced and bound

It's you now... yeah
Everybody's looking for you now... yeah

I know you know we know I'm going down
Help me get my feet back off the ground

Come with me and I will show
What not to be, where not to go
Chase the shadows, through black holes
Find the darkness, in your soul

It's me now... yeah

Everybody says it was me now...yeah
Everybody's looking for me now

I know you know we know I'm going down
Help me get my feet back off the ground
I know you know we know I'm going down
Help me get my head back in the clouds

Hide and seek, cloak and find
All the colours in your mind
Tied together, sunday's clown
Traced and feathered, laced and bound

I know you know we know I'm going down
Help me get my feet back off the ground
I know you know we know I'm going down
Help me get my head back in the clouds
