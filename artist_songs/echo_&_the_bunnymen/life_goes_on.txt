How do you stop yourself from
Falling apart and going under
Lost in a world that's got your
Name tag, nametagged and your number

One by one they will find you
Life goes on behind you
Behind you

When does it start to fade and
When do the roads start leading nowhere
When all your prayers have been prayed
That's when you know your dream is over 

One by one they will find you
Life goes on behind you
Behind you

One of these days I'm gonna
Do as I say and do it my way
I'm gonna grow those wings
And learn to fly and hit the sky

One by one they will find you
Life goes on behind you
Behind you
