Buried alive
Person unknown
Dying inside 
Half the way home
Somewhere under a delvaux moon
Childhoods end came too soon
Came too soon

Don't want to know when 
Don't wanna know why
Don't wanna believe that life is just to die
You were the one who sang lullabies
I'm still hangign out to dry, out to cry

Hey now, hey now
Don't you cry
It's just the dying of the light
Time to say our goodbyes
I'll look for you in that goodnight

Is anybody here?
I wanna go out, the way I came in
My flame blowing out 
In the Summer wind
Somewhere under a delvaux moon
Childhoods end came too soon
Came too soon

Hey now, hey now
Don't you cry
It's just the dying of the light
Time to say our goodbyes
I'll look for you in that goodnight

Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
