I'm gonna lift you up
I'm gonna lie you down
I'm gonna be the king of kings
You're gonna rise above
All of the other stuff
You'll be the queen of everything

Nothing's gonna be the same
Nothing's gonna be the same
I'll fly tonight
I'll fly tonight
Into your light

I'm gonna mess you up
I'm gonna let you down
I'm gonna cut you to the bone
You're gonna lose your nerve
You're gonna learn to hate
You'll have a life you've never known

Nothing's ever gonna change
Nothing's ever gonna change
I'll fly tonight
I'll fly tonight
Into your light
I'll fly tonight
I'll fly tonight
Into your light

If I should fall
From such great height
Will be I be caught
Mid-flight
If I should steer
As far and wide
Will you be near
When I go wrong

I'm gonna lift you up
I'm gonna lie you down
I'm gonna be the king of kings

Nothing's gonna be the same
Nothing's ever gonna change
I'll fly tonight
I'll fly tonight
Into you light

If I should steer
As far and wide
Will you be near
When I go wrong
When I go wrong
When I go wrong
When I go wrong
Will I go wrong
Will I go wrong
