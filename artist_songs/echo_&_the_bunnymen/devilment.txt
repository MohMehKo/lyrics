Devilment's accomplishment
The devil remembers you found 
Your true vocation
To live beyond your station

leaves wrapped in quotations
Rolling out saliva on salvation
All the more
And all that you've been looking for

Floored by design
Speak as you find
Speaking as you find
All the one skin
All the one mind

Floored by design
Speak as you find
Speaking as you find
Staggering blind
As you chase time
Waste time

Blank expression, blank verse
It could get worse
If all your past preceeds you
To find the soul to take you

shout of indignation
Lost their worth
And meaning in translation
Unhappiness will quantify the moral

Floored by design
Speak as you find
(Speaking as you find)
All the one skin
All the one mind
(One mind)

Floored by design
Speak as you find
(Speaking as you find)
Staggering blind
As you chase time
As you waste time
As you waste time

Devilment embarassment
The face in your old mirror
Now Just hates you
And you, you

Eyes lost in comtemplation
Hands are trembling
Heads gone on vacation
And settled scores are all 
That you've been fighting for

Floored by design
Speak as you find
(Speaking as you find)
All the one skin
All the one mind
(One mind) 

Floored by design
Speak as you find
Speaking as you find
Staggering blind
As you chase time
As you waste time
As you waste time
You waste time
You waste time
You waste time
