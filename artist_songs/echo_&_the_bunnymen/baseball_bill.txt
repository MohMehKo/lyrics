Here I go 
It must be four in a row
I gotta get my head down tonight
But you know I know 
When the streets are aglow
I'll be heading for the city of light

You talkin' to me?
'Cause I don't wanna know-no-no-no
You can't even see 
What's already on show-oh-oh-oh 

I'm hitting my prime 
And you're wasting my time
You're denominator commonest low
My head's burning up
And I'm down on my luck
See you in the 48th row

With a matchbox full 
And a sulphurous skull
Trying to set my mind to rights
I'm gonna burn, burn, burn, 
As the universe turns
Out of mind and out of sight

You talkin' to me?
'Cause I don't wanna know-no-no-no
You can't even see 
What's already on show-oh-oh-oh 

Baseball Bill went in for the kill
He blew it when he found his soul
Lost his will to live 
When he saw someone give
'Cause giving always takes its toll

You talkin' to me?
'Cause I don't wanna know-no-no-no
You can't even see 
What's already on show-oh-oh-oh 

You talkin' to me?
'Cause I don't wanna know-no-no-no
You can't even see 
What's already on show-oh-oh-oh 

Ooh Baseball Bill

Ooh Baseball Bill

Ooh Baseball Bill
Ooh Baseball Bill
