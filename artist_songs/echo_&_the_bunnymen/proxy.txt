Show me something that I've not seen before
Show me somewhere that I've not been before
You give me so much I don't want anymore
And until I get my fill
Awake on the sea, asleep on the shore
You're making me just want to keep wanting more
I'm understanding, and I'm standing under awe
Just like many, but nobody
Not like any, everybody

Everybody, look at us now
Everybody, look at us now
Everybody, look at us now
Look at us now
Yeah, look at us now
Yeah, look at us now
Look at us now

I love it when you say you're better than me
Like you know you're not as clever as me
You can't connect intellectually
And until I get my fill
My head is heading for the head surgery
Everything you said, you heard it from me
Your repetition's just repeating on me
Just like many, but nobody
Not like any, everybody

Everybody, look at us now
Everybody, look at us now
Everybody, look at us now
Look at us now
Yeah, look at us now
Yeah, look at us now
Look at us now

Am I the wrong one?
Am I the wrong one?
Am I the wrong one?
Am I the wrong one?

Everybody, look at us now
Everybody, look at us now
Everybody, look at us now
Everybody, look at us now
Everybody, look at us now
Everybody, look at us now
Everybody, look at us now
Everybody, look at us now
