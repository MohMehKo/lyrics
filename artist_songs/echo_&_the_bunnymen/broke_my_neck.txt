I'll forget
Just what I meant
All I meant
Lost respect
If I fall from grace
I'm dead
What I meant
Lost all track
And the way I went
No sign of face to face
No chance of face to face

I helped myself
I couldn't help myself
I tell myself
Go on and help yourself
You can help yourself
I can help myself

No sign of face to face...
