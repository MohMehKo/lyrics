Come on down to market town
Come on down to market
Come and watch the sun go down
Come and watch the darkness

Come on down to market
Come on down to market
Come and ride the mag around
Ride the magic carpet
Come and find what's underground
Finish what we started
Finish what we started
Come on down to market

No survivors, no survivors
No survivors would be found
No survivors, no survivors
No survivors would be found

What you gonna do?
When they come for you?
What you gonna do?
When they come for you?

Come and find the ladder down
Come and see the darkness
Come and see the light go down
Hard to find you hardly
Come and heed the darkness
Come and climb the ladder down
Finish what you started

No survivors, no survivors
No survivors would be found
No survivors, no survivors
No survivors would be found

When you know it's going down
When you know it's down
Na nana nana annananan

No survivors, no survivors
No survivors would be found
No survivors, no survivors
No survivors would be found
