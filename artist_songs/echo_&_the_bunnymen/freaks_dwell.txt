Lost your reason
Lost your game plan
Sit you down
I'll set the scene man

Brilliant            
Bronze bohemians
Thought they were 
A football team man

Let me take you to a hell
Where all the freaks dwell
Passed my god of woe

Pleasure pasture
Business sometimes
One more embrace
For the good times

Self-made man will
Unmake beds sure
Gagged and bound
And fights like hellock

Let me take you to the hell
Where all the freaks dwell
Passed my god of woe

Let me take you to the hell
Where all the heads swell
Pay no mind at all

Cross your heart and
Hope to prosper
All your sin will be forgiven
Needs they muster
Devil drives the biggest car
You've never driven

Let me take you to the hell
Where all the freaks dwell
Passed my god of woe

Let me take you to the hell
Where all the heads swell
Pay no mind at all
