Take this gun, take these pills
Make a wish and make a will
A wish became, a will because
I wish I am just who I was

And I always hear them singing
And complaining about the world
And my chiming bells are ringing
But I never heard a word

In the arms, our love
Cling to orders from above
To light our lives with whats
Faith received is grace returned

Well I always hear them singing
And complaining about the world
And my chiming bells are ringing
But I never heard a word

When you feel, will you be feelin'
How she felt against your skin
And as you kneel, will you be kneelin'
Deep in prayer or steeped in sin
Without a [?] within
Within the hole in the holy
A crack in the heart
Its love and love only that sets our worlds apart
Worlds apart, joined at the heart

Take this gun, take these pills
Make a wish and make a will
A wish became, a will because
I wish I am just who I was

But i always hear them singing
And complaining about the world
And my chiming bells are ringing
But I never heard a word

When you feel, will you be feelin'
How she felt against your skin
As you kneel, will you be kneelin'
Deep in prayer or steeped in sin
Without a [?] within
Within the hole in the holy
A crack in the heart
Its love and love only that sets our world
A part of me is giving
A part of me gives in
And takes the beauty out of living
And the guilt of all our sins
The guilt from all our sins

And the [?] is a means to an end of the things 
that tempt you away from the path to the true way

In the crippled fire, and the lips do kiss the flame
Will you lower, or go higher
The blameless or the blame
Blameless or the blame

With a hole in the holy
A crack in the heart
Its love and love only that sets our world apart
