On this burning
Burning bed of nails
Touched the needle
Got the need
Tables turning
Turning under me
Open up
And let it bleed

Out of the black
In to night
Into the dark and hollow rain
Out of the black
In to night
Into the dark and hollow
Dark and hollow rain

One more chance
To make some sense of it
One more push
To make the fall
Split in two
I'm getting used to it
Push the button
And make the call

Out of the black
In to night
Into the dark and hollow rain
Out of the black
In to night
Into the dark and hollow
Dark and hollow rain

On this tangled
Tangled web I weave
I'm the spider
And the fly
Stuck to things
I know I'll never leave
Burning bed of nails
And I

Out of the black
In to night
Into the dark and hollow rain
Out of the black
In to night
Into the dark and hollow
Dark and hollow rain
