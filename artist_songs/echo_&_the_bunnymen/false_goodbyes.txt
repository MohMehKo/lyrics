Whisper who dares
Your daylight glows
I doubt that it shows me
Covered in glory

A problem shared
Is entertainment 
In your hands
Ain't life bland

What matter or
What consequence in truth
All our lives strange honor
In a realm of false goodbyes

Suspend belief
But keep it brief
Thereby hangs a tale friend
Hung from your wit's end

And is that all
The level best 
That you can do
More fool you

What matter or
What consequence in truth
All our lives strange honor
In a realm of false goodbyes

Such dedication in the plot
Such animation and for what
A pile of nothing like as not
And when the crowd come out to play
I'll read the lesson for today
About the one that got away

What matter or
What consequence in truth
All our lives strange honor
In a realm of false goodbyes

What matter or
What consequence in truth
All our lives strange honor
In a realm of false goodbyes
