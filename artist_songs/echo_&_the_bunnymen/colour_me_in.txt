Crash
Here it comes
Is it nearly over?
Flames
Up in smoke
That's the way it burns
Every mother's son
Knows he's going nowhere
Brave and then broken
That's the way it turns

Lost
In the tide
Into the ocean
Dust turns to dust
And surf to surf
Trying to slip my life
Into slow motion
Me to earth

Colour me in
Red         
For all of that sin
And all of that        

Hey, who am I
Hey, who am I
Lost in the mirrors
That               
Can't bear to look
Look into my own eyes
I don't want to see
That I want to be

Colour me in 
Red         
For all of that sin
And all of that         

Crash
Here it comes
Is it nearly over?
Flames
Up in smoke
That's the way it burns
Every mother's son
Knows he's going nowhere
Brave and then broken
That's the way it turns

Lost
In the tide
Into the ocean
Dust turns to dust
And surf to surf
Trying to slip my life
Into slow motion
Me to earth

Colour me in 
Red         
For all of that sin
And all of that         

Colour me in 
Red         
For all of that sin
And all of that
