Failure's child is weak and mild
Wide-eyed and sad and strange           
A moment is the most 
She'll hang her day upon
Others plan a life
Without the faintest hope of change
And belay all her knowledge
Of where hope has gone

In these ugly times 
An ugly mind will have its say
And your betters would not
Have it any other way

Oh my eyes 
for the sins I may not shed
Burn like coals inside my head
Smoldering black and flaming red

Oh my eyes 
for the sins I may not shed
Burn like coals inside my head
Smoldering black and flaming red

Reconciled and pacified
By bread and circus clowns
Who keep you all in stitches
As they keep you down
Dust yourself down
Tell me what on earth
The fuss was for
'Cause what you've seen is nothing
To what's still in store

In these ugly times
An ugly mind will have its say
And your betters would not
Have it any other way

Oh my eyes
for the sins I may not shed
Burn like coals inside my head
Smoldering black and flaming red

Oh my eyes
for the sins I may not shed
Burn like coals Inside my head
Smoldering black And flaming red

Oh my eyes
for the sins I may not shed
Burn like coals inside my head
Smoldering black and flaming red
