If… I got distant
From all the gifts that heaven sent… every missed and misspent…
Wish… every instant
Every twist was different…
Not every lip sent kiss meant…
This… is the distance… between guilt and innocence…
In self-built self defence…

New horizons, new horizons, new horizons, new horizons

Is… this my sentence
All this life as penitence?
In the past imperfect
Tense… are the senses…
Life just a sequence of events… then a breathless silence

New horizons, new horizons, new horizons, new horizons
New horizons, new horizons, new horizons, new horizons

If… I got distant
From all the gifts that heaven sent… every missed and misspent…
Wish… every instant
That every twist was different…
Not every lip sent kiss meant…
This… is the distance… between guilt and innocence…
In self-built self defence…

New horizons, new horizons, new horizons, new horizons
New horizons, new horizons, new horizons, new horizons

Horizons, horizons, horizons, horizons
