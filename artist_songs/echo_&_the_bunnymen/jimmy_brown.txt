Jimmy Brown
Made of stone
Charlie Clown
Lost his way home

Bring on the dancing horses
Headless and all alone
Shiver and say the words
Of every ghost you've heard

First I'm gonna make it
Then I'm gonna break it
'Til it falls apart
Hating all the faking
Shaking while I'm breaking
My brittle heart

Billy stands
All alone
Sinking sand
Skin and bone

Bring on the headless horses
Wherever they may roam
Shiver and say the words
Of every ghost you've heard

First I'm gonna make it
Then I'm gonna break it
'Til it falls apart
Hating all the faking
Shaking while I'm breaking
My brittle heart
Brittle heart

Jimmy Brown
Made of stone
Charlie Clown
Lost his way home

Shiver and say the words
Of every lie you've heard

First I'm gonna make it
Then I'm gonna break it
'Til it falls apart
Hating all the faking
Shaking while I'm breaking
My brittle heart
Brittle heart

Jimmy Brown
Made of stone
Sinking sand
Skin and bone

Bring on the new messiah
Wherever he may roam
First I'm gonna break it
Then I'm gonna make him
Find his own way home
