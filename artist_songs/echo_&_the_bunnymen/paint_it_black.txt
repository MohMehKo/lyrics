I see a red door and I want to paint it black
No colors anymore, I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

I see a line of cars and they're all painted black
With flowers and my love both never to come back
Maybe I'll fade away and not have to face the facts
It's not easy facin' up when your whole world's turnin' black

I look inside myself and see my heart is black
I see a red door and I want to paint it black
I see them turn their heads and quickly look away
I think that maybe it just happens every day

No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue
I can not foresee this thing happening to you
If I look hard enough into the settin' sun
My love will laugh with me until the mornin' comes

I see a red door and I want to paint it black
No colors anymore, I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

I wanna see it painted, painted, painted black
I wanna see it painted, painted, painted black
I wanna see it painted, painted, painted black
I wanna see it painted, painted, painted black
Black
