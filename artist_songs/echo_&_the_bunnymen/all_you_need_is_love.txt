Love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love

There's nothing you can do that can't be done
Nothing you can sing that can't be sung
Nothing you can say, but you can learn how to play the game
It's easy

Nothing you can make that can't be made
No-one you can save that can't be saved
Nothing you can do, but you can learn how to be you
It's easy

All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love
Love is all you need

There's nothing you can know that isn't known
Nothing you can see that isn't shown
Nowhere you can be that isn't where you're meant to be
It's easy

All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love
Love is all you need

There's nothing you can do that can't be done
Nothing you can sing that can't be sung
Nothing you can say, but you can learn how to play the game
It's easy

All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love
Love is all you need

All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love
Love is all you need

I've seen it in your eyes
I've read it in books
Who wants love
Without the looks

I've seen it in your eyes
I've read it in books
Who wants love
Without the looks

Yeah, yeah, yeah
She loves you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
And with a love like that
You know you should be glad

How does it feel to be on your own?
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone
Like a rolling stone

Please release me, let me go
I don't love you anymore
I don't love you anymore

They stone you when you want to go to bed
They stone you when they're chopping off your head
Why do I feel so all alone?
Everybody must get stoned

Love, love, love
Love, love, love

Love, love, love
Love, love, love

Get up
Stay on the scene
Like a sex machine
Get up, getup
Stay on the scene
Like a sex machine
