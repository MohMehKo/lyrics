Skin deep and sinking
You're fingerprints
Will stay with me
Always I'm thinking
Of how you left your dirt on me
On me

What was I thinking of
To give you a part of me
I can't get the stuff off
Forever inside me

Say the word and I will come
Burning like the golden sun
Say your will
It will be done
Your star is shining
Out at everyone
Everyone

Can't stop believing
Life's great untouchables
Can't keep from dreaming
Dreams turn to          

How did it get to this
I never saw it come
How do I get to miss
What I've never done? 

Say the word and I will come
Burning like the golden sun
Say your will
It will be done

Your star is shining
Out at everyone
Everyone

Skin deep and sinking
You're fingerprints
Will stay with me
Always I'm thinking
Of how you left your dirt on me
On me

What was I thinking of
To give you a part of me
I can't get the stuff off
Forever inside me

Say the word and I will come
Burning like the golden sun
Say your will
It will be done
Your star is shining
Out at everyone
Everyone

Say the word and I will come
Burning like the golden sun
Say your will
It will be done
Your star is shining
Out at everyone
Everyone

Everyone
