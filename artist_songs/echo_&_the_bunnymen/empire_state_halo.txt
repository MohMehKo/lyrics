Gazed in the crystal ball
Looks like I'm lost again
Where do I find the tunnel's end
Follow the rise and fall
Of all the better men
From here to Bethlehem

All free souls beware
The moon is in my head

Around the empire state
I saw the angels fly
Heaven above and Thames below
We don't have long to wait
Ran out of alibis
Ran out of things I've ever known

The streets were paved with snow
and I saw your halo glow

And this love is just for you
And all your love
Will learn to love me too
Love me too

All free souls beware
The moon is in my head

And this love is just for you
And all your love
Will learn to love me to
Love me too

The moon is in my head
