I'm water… swim to me
Be my fire… burn with me

One day, you'll see
After the Fall has fallen
One day, I'll be
The one your heart's still calling

I'm air… breathe with me
Be my prayer… believe in me

One night, you'll see
The moon and stars in motion
One night, your sea
Will melt into my ocean

I'm water… swim to me
Be my fire… burn for me

I'm going out...

One day, you'll see
After the Fall has fallen
One day, I'll be
The one your heart's still calling

One night, you'll see
The moon and stars in motion
One night, your sea
Will melt into my ocean
