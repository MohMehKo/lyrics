Jimmy Brown 
Made of stone 
Charlie Clown 
No way home 
Bring on the dancing horses 
Headless and all alone 

Shiver and say the words 
Of every lie you've heard 

First I'm gonna make it 
Then I'm gonna break it 
Till it falls apart 
Hating all the faking 
And shaking while I'm breaking 
Your brittle heart 

Billy stands 
All alone 
Sinking sand 
Skin and bone 
Bring on the dancing horses 
Wherever they may roam 

Shiver and say the words 
Of every lie you've heard 

First I'm gonna make it 
Then I'm gonna break it 
Till it falls apart 
Hating all the faking 
And shaking while I'm breaking 
Your brittle heart 

Brittle heart
Brittle heart
Brittle heart
And my little heart
Goes

Brittle heart 
And our little heart 
Goes

Bring on the new messiah
Wherever he may roam
Bring on the new messiah
Wherever he may roam
Bring on the new messiah
Wherever he may roam
Bring on the new messiah
Wherever he may roam
