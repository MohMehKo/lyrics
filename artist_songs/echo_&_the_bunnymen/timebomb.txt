Easy it comes
And easy it goes
Over my head
And down below
Message received
Loud and clear
Voices are calling
Through my fear

In search of the mine
Got nothing to lose
Just after what's mine
How can you refuse
All sugar and blood
Bad blood in my veins
I wish that I could
Go back where I came

In a gold mine lie the buried treasures
Get a piece of what's going down
I'll get mine and
You'll wait forever
If you don't take it
When it comes around
It comes around

I wanna see
I wanna know
Who's got the blueprint
For my soul
When did it change
When did I go
Out of my head
To out of control

ahead
To poisoned to          
To easily lead
To easily confused
There's no turning back
It's over and gone
Instinct           
It's time to move on

In a gold mine lie the buried treasures
Get a piece of what's going down
I'll get mine and
You'll wait forever
If you don't take it
When it comes around

In search of the mine
Got nothing to lose
Just after what's mine
How can you refuse
All sugar and blood
Bad blood in my veins
I wish that I could
Go back where I came

In the gold mine lie the buried treasures
Get a piece of what's going down
I'll get mine and
You'll wait forever
If you don't take it
When it comes around
Around
