It's the twists and turns
Of the cigarette burns
The holes in the mind
Of the nebulous mass
Forget         
Or you don't learn
The debt between mine
And the hole in your past

I'm the dust
Of someone's ash
See you in hell
With the rest of the trash

I need love
A love with question
A clean mind
And a pocket of space
I want a map
And a sense of direction
Looking for love
And the thrill of the world

Just spinning round
Trying to find            
You wanna be out there
When you're underground
Now, now, now
N-now, now, n-now
Do you feel it lowdown

Too many thoughts
Might have twisted my thinking
I just can't think straight anymore
I've got the bends
I can feel myself sinking

Just can't keep on
Keep on coming back for more

In love
There's no need to worry
I've got nails
So hold on hold on
Think back before you started thinking
About the things you were
Sold on sold on

Keep spinning round
Trying to hold on
But you're failing now
You wanna be up there
But you're underground
Now, now, now
N-now, now, n-now
Do you feel it lowdown
Lowdown lowdown lowdown

And the world
Keeps spinning around
Trying to find          
You wanna be out there
But you're underground
Now, now, now
N-now, now, n-now
Do you feel it lowdown
Spinning round
Spinning round
Spinning round
Now, now, now
N-now, now, n-now
Do you feel it lowdown
Lowdown lowdown lowdown
Lowdown lowdown lowdown
