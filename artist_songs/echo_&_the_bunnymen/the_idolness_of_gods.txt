If the world was half as mad as me
Like that could ever be
I'd say the world was crazy

If I'm just half the man I was
I'd say that's just because
I must have gotten lazy
Lazy...

In duty and in love
In beauty wearing off
Beware, be wary of
The Idolness of Gods
The Idolness of Gods
The Idolness of Gods

On the ropes against the tide
There's nowhere left to hide
Once you've seen my insides

Broken hope broke open wide
See the knock-out punch your pride
I've got you seats at ringside
Ringside...

In duty and in love
In beauty wearing off
Beware, be wary of
The Idolness of Gods
The Idolness of Gods
The Idolness of Gods

Oh, what now?
Oh, what now?
No, not now

No, not now
No, not now
No, not now

Nights and tears are falling down
Keep splashing to the ground
Eyelashes getting drowned-drowned

Life's frontiers grew walls around
New pastures can't be found
I'm crashing cars in your town
Your town...

In duty and in love
In beauty wearing off
Beware, be wary of
The Idolness of Gods
The Idolness of Gods
The Idolness of Gods
