Love it, hate it
Want it, had it
Need it, got it
Down-da-down-da-down

Take it, took it
Shake it, shook it
Flaked it, flucked it
Down-da-down-da-down

Do you know who I am?
Do you know what I've got?
Did you know who I am?
'Cause I know what you're not

Read it, wrote it
Heard it, spoked it
Need it, broke it
Down-da-down-da-down-da-down-da-down-da-down-da-down

Do you know who I am?
Do you know what I've got?
Did you know who I am?
'Cause I know what you're not

Love it, hate it
Want it, had it
Need it, got it
Down-da-down-da-down

Do you know who I am?
Do you know what I've got?
Did you know who I am?
'Cause I know what you're not

Do you know who I am?
Do you know what I've got?
Did you know who I am?
'Cause I know what you're not

Do you know who I am?
Do you know what I've got?
Did you know who I am?
'Cause I know what you're not

Do you know who I am?
Do you know what I've got?
Did you know who I am?
