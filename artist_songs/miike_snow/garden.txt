So many worlds, so many worlds for me to penetrate
I wanna last and take the sun from all the half-awake
Cause you weren’t here, you know that you weren’t here

So many times we were the ones to write and settle wars
Cause when you don’t, you’re signing up to take it on all fours
And you aren’t here, I know that you aren’t here

Someday we’ll be old men rotting
Someday we’ll be eyes in a garden

So many times we were the ones to reach the heart of wars
Cause if you don’t they tie you up and pull you into fours
And you aren’t here, you know that you aren’t here

Someday we’ll be old men rotting
Someday we’ll be eyes in a garden
Someday we’ll be old men rotting
Someday we’ll be eyes in a garden, a garden...
