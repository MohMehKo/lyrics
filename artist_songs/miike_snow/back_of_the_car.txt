Don't want to be your bible
Don't want to toy with your survival
Just want to keep you company
And when you're free you can come for me
Don't want to be your planet
Cause it was not like you planned it
Just want to have you come and play
Just say my name from day to day

I tried and it's never enough
I always jumped to hide when I needed your love
I want to be the man in the back of the car
I will let it ride
Your love will carry me (love affair)...

Don't want to burst your bubble
But the world is toil and trouble
Everybody wants a piece
There's something they don't really need
I don't want to get high
I just want to survive and have fun on the side

I tried and it's never enough
I always jumped to hide when I needed your love
I want to be the man in the back of the car
I will let it ride
Your love will carry me (love affair)...
