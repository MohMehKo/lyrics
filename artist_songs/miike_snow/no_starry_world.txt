You can’t feel it the old magic
You keep selling drugs for lesser kind of addicts,
Lesser kind of addicts

Its so sweet and synthetic
You’re at Charles de Gaulle with dumbbells in your baggage
Dumbbells in your baggage

Miles Standish was not a hero
He just talked fast when it fell below zero
Fell below zero

Say anything, I say anything,
Pay anything not to be pressed for survival
Don’t press me for survival

Sell me no
Starry world
Sell me no
Starry world

But I tried
No starry world
You’ll never know how I tried
I tried
No starry world
You’ll never know how I tried
