Morning bled at the water's edge
The city was bringing me down
And my mind was on a ledge
Saying who's gonna help you now

Without sun we pull what feeds us
From the heat that's in between us
How can we expect to build a boat
Seagulls running everything

Hard, you make it hard, hard

It's all the opposite I think
The ladder runs side to side
Enough to make you want a drink
But there's no place to hide

Watching shadows within shadows within
They hide their dark selfs from the sun
And her voice is just a memory
You're not fooling anyone

Hard, you make it hard, hard
Hard, you make it hard, hard
