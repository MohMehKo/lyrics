I am not the fast one
Not the hunter, not the prey
Can I get motion?
Can I live another day?
I don't want pressure
I don't need a wall to fall
I just want to be there
Want to be there when you come

Take your time, take your time
To decide if you are mine
Yeah, I know that it's hard
And your eyes the full of dark
Take your time, take your time
To decide if you are mine
There's a price to it all
And we're not forever young

Cause it's a lonely, lonely, lonely life
It's a lonely, lonely, lonely life
It's a lonely, lonely, lonely life
It's a lonely, lonely, lonely life

You seem so nervous
All your feelings in your face
I wish I could help you
To not feel so out of place
I'm under pressure
Will I miss you when you're gone?
And all your pleasures
Haunting me before the dawn, yeah

Take your time, take your time
To decide if you are mine
Yeah, I know that it's hard
And your eyes the full of dark
Take your time, take your time
To decide if you are mine
There's a price to it all
And we're not forever young

Cause it's a lonely, lonely, lonely life
It's a lonely, lonely, lonely life
It's a lonely, lonely, lonely life
It's a lonely, lonely, lonely life
Cause it's a lonely, lonely, lonely life
It's a lonely, lonely, lonely life
It's a lonely, lonely, lonely life
