I met you on the Palisades
The sun was spilling kerosene
And I was feeling wide awake
Girl, you can be so obscene
And when you sang a lullaby
A missionary called your name
You disappeared and hopped a flight
For the Serengeti plain

Tell everyone you know
Open up the door
Tell everyone you know
Open up the door

When your love has gone
You carry on
This is her song
This the song for no one
This the song for no one

I think I own a photograph
That shows her in the freezing rain
With the Italians on the bank
They know how to entertain
A string of pearls behind your hair
A music box to catch your tears
Now call your mother in L.A.
She hasn't heard your voice in years

Tell everyone you know
Open up the door
Tell everyone you know
Open up the door

When your love has gone
You carry on
This is her song
This the song for no one

When your love has gone
You carry on
This is her song
This the song for no one

You can jump a ride
But don't ask why
And don't close your eyes
This the song for no one
