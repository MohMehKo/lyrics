You took the yellow diamond spears and turned it on its head
And everybody wants to turn up, give it to them
Sharp through tension, sharp through tension
You've put a lasso on the scene
Feeds and pages, feeds and pages
Look away and take the backdoor to

The heart of me
Because I can't believe
That anything's cool anymore

I want to touch you, I want you to touch me
I can't stop this hurtful shit from happening
You and I, we've been through it
And this is no time wave
Dip into the lake, the mountains
Shake the fear of God into

The heart of me
Because I can't believe
That anything's cool anymore

I remember standing in a cathedral
Somewhere in Northern Europe, I think it was Paradiso
The space around my head was ringing
And I felt like I finally touched this world
I felt as if I finally understood
That we have to build something of our own now
Even if I didn't know it at the time
I choose to

The heart of me
Because I can't believe
To the heart of me
Because I can't believe
