I was born into money
And sold down the river
I was choked by the jailor
And fucked the gorilla
I ran through the country ahead of my time
I escaped through a keyhole before they erased me
I married the beetle and learned to be graceful
It's why all this warfare pours out of my eyes

Now I see just what you mean
It hurts too much to breathe
All alone in this plastic jungle
Sometimes I wanna get slain
I wanna get slain
I wanna get la la la...

She told me that she loved me
I didn't believe her
The son of a junkie is ancient Korean
But don't blame the girl she's out of her mind

Now I see just what you mean
It hurts too much to bleed
All alone in this plastic jungle
Sometimes I wanna get slain
I wanna get slain
I wanna get la la la...

Sometimes I wanna get
Sometimes I wanna get slain
I wanna get slain
I wanna get la la la...
