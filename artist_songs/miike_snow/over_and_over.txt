These are the days when the heels feels hell fires
And the barking needs to keep telling you something deep - in your sleep
They said that it's all coming and everything, 
everything will get cleaner, and brighter, and old
Take my breath away

But that won't make me change the way I see the world
Over and over, over and over
My fate's the same, but let me hold on to you, girl
Over and over, over and over
My fate's the same, but let me hold on to you, girl

These are the days when the ones you hit to despise
Who will try to take shits only nine to five - to survive

But that won't make me change the way I see the world
Over and over, over and over
My fate's the same, but let me hold on to you, girl
Over and over, over and over

But that won't make me change the way I see the world
Over and over, over and over
My fate's the same, but let me hold on to you, girl
Over and over, over and over
