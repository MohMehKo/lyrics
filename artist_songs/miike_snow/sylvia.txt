Reach the city steps tonight
Following the power lines
Met a man barside
With eclipses for eyes
And you tell yourself you won't let them touch
Did I say too much? Did I say enough?
I don't know, Silvia
I don't know, Silvia

Circle round the room still
Have fun breaking my will

No, I can't have you here
Someone else on your skin

And it's all my fault for not getting off
so you made it start, can you make it stop?
You don't know, Silvia
You don't know, Silvia

SIIIIIIIILLLLLLLLVVVVVVVVIIIIIIIIAAAAAAAA
SIIIIIIIILLLLLLLLVVVVVVVVIIIIIIIIAAAAAAAA

Reach the city steps tonight
Following the power lines

And your skin is so white
Underneath the black night
And your voice cries out for the coup de gr√¢ce
And the lights go out, will there be a trace?
That I loved, Silvia
That I loved, Silvia
(That I loved, Silvia)

SIIIIIIIILLLLLLLLVVVVVVVVIIIIIIIIAAAAAAAA
SIIIIIIIILLLLLLLLVVVVVVVVIIIIIIIIAAAAAAAA

(That I loved, Silvia)

(SIIIIIIIILLLLLLLLVVVVVVVVIIIIIIIIAAAAAAAA)
(SIIIIIIIILLLLLLLLVVVVVVVVIIIIIIIIAAAAAAAA)
