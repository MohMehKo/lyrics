I want to be your starlight in the darkest hour
I want to feed you love and give you all my fire

Be the weakness that takes you to a higher power
I want to taste you and the sweetness turns to sour

Want you to hold me like you'll drop me and I'll shatter
Want you to touch me like you're drowning in my water
Cry over me like if you don't you'll become sadder
I wanna climb you like the tallest of the ladder

I wanna blow your mind like Alice with the hatter
Throw me around here like sanity doesn't matter
Cry over me like every tear will bring us closer
I wanna ride you like the highest rollercoaster

I wanna be your starlight in the darkest hour
I wanna hold you just like Paris holds the tower
And, feel you like the constant flowing of the ocean
And love you like I'm drunk off of the strongest potion (yeah)

I wanna meet you at the bottom of the ocean
I wanna live my life beside you in slow motion
