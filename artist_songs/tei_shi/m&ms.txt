I can be your bullet proof vest
Or the gun that you hold
To your chest
I could be your bulletproof

I had a dream that you left me 
I deserved it
I deserved it
I had a dream that you left me 
I deserved it
I deserved it

Say it to me one more time
I'm not cut out for this thing called life
I'm stranger than anyone you could
Ever hurt (to call it)
Anyone you could ever hold
I deserved it

I had a dream that you left me 
I deserved it
I deserved it
I had a dream that you left me 
I deserved it
I deserved it

Say it to me one more time
I'm not cut out for this thing called life
I'm stranger than anyone you could
Ever hurt (to call it)
Anyone you could ever hold
I deserved it

I can be your bullet proof vest
Or the gun that you hold
To your chest
I could be your bulletproof
