Hey, you're runnin' around here
Like almost everyday
No, I'm never alone
And I surely don't notice you

Baby had a heart and then it went away
Dropped it on the floor and let it separate
All the neighbors sad and now they see it [?]
Askin' when they'll see me in the light of day
Maybe in the year 3k

Cold, I'm cold
When I'm in your way, I'm cold
Cold, I'm cold
When I'm in your way, I'm cold
Hey, you're runnin' around here
Like almost everyday
No, I'm never alone
And I surely don't notice you

Baby had a heart and then it went away
Dropped it on the floor and let it separate
All the neighbors sad and now they see it [?]
Askin' when they'll see me in the light of day
Maybe in the year 3k

Cold, I'm cold
When I'm in your way, I'm cold
Cold, I'm cold
When I'm in your way, I'm cold
Hey, you're runnin' around here
Like almost everyday
No, I'm never alone
And I surely don't notice you

Baby had a heart and then it went away

Cold, I'm cold
When I'm in your way, I'm cold
Cold, I'm cold
When I'm in your way, you say
That I'm in your way
You're cold when I'm in your way
When I'm in your way
When I'm in your way
When I'm in your way
When I'm in your way

I wonder what your next move
I wonder what your next move is
I wonder
I wonder what the truth is

Cold, I'm cold
When I'm in your way, I'm cold
Cold, I'm cold
When I'm in your way, I'm told
That I'm in your way
You say that I'm in your way

Baby had a heart and then it went away
Askin' when they'll see me in the light of day
Maybe in the year 3k
