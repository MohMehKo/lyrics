It leaves me empty when I'm lookin' inside myself
All the questions I would rather ask someone else
What if I don't know, what if I don't know
How to be my friend, how to be my friend

Lift me up from this place
Lift me up from this place
Lift me, lift me

It ain't so fuckin' real
Well, all your honesty's just a brand
It makes me feel so anxious
Have to sit on my own too hands
What if I don't want, oh, what if I don't want
To pretend to live my own life

Lift me up from this place
Lift me up from this place
(Lift me, this place)
(Lift me)

Teach me something
I don't have to
Swallow whole and imitate and
Someone who can make me forget
Everything I've ever done
Teach me something
I don't have to
Swallow whole and imitate and
Someone who can make me forget
Everything I've ever done

(Lift me)
(Me, me, me)
(Me, me)

Teach me something
I don't have to
Swallow whole and imitate and
Someone who can make me forget
Everything I've ever done
Teach me something
I don't have to
Swallow whole and imitate and
Someone who can make me forget
Everything I've ever done
