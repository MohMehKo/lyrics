Are you God?
You created me
Am I fraud?
That's what you say to me

I'm not livin' inside of your world
I'm eatin' more than everyone says I should
You feel it too, too, too
You feel it too, too, too

Baby, what a privilege
If you made me
In your image
Why you afraid of me?

I'm not livin' inside your world
I'm eatin' more than everyone says I should (I should)
You feel it too, too, too
You feel it too, too, too

If, if you wanna let go
If you wanna let go
If, if you already know
If you already know
If, if you wanna let go
If you wanna let go
If, if you already know
Then we're ready to go

I'm not livin' inside your world
I'm eatin' more than everyone says I should (I should)
You feel it too, too, too
You feel it too, too, too
I feel it when they're tellin' me that I'm good
(Tellin' me that I'm good)
I'm eatin' more than everyone says I should (I should)
(Everyone says I should)
You feel it too, too, too
(You feel it too, you feel it too)
(Everyone says I should)
You feel it too, too, too
(You feel it too, you feel it too)
(You feel it too, you feel it too)
You feel it
You feel it
