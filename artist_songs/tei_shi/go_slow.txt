Go slow
I wanna hear the floorboards squeak
And I go slow
I wanna fill the space between
If you're giving what you're giving to me
Feeling like a new machine
And if you're living how you're living for me
I wanna hear the floorboards squeak

Go slow
I wanna hear the floorboards squeak
And I go slow
I wanna fill the space between
If you're giving what you're giving to me
Feeling like a new machine
And if you're living how you're living for me
I wanna hear the floorboards squeak

And baby won't you reach out to me?
Baby won't you reach out to me?

Go slow
I wanna hear the floorboards squeak
And I go slow
I wanna fill the space between
If you're giving what you're giving to me
Feeling like a new machine
And if you're living how you're living for me
I wanna hear the floorboards squeak

And baby won't you reach out to me?
Baby won't you reach out to me?

Go slow
I wanna hear the floorboards squeak
And I go slow
I wanna fill the space between
If you're giving what you're giving to me
Feeling like a new machine
And if you're living how you're living for me
I wanna hear the floorboards squeak

And baby won't you reach out to me?
Baby won't you reach out to me?

Oh darling...
Oh darling...
Oh darling...
Oh darling...
