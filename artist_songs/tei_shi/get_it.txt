Baby when you hold me
It's a feeling I can only fight
And know I should (know I should)
And you know that you stole me
When you looked at me and told me
It was understood

And you know that you've won
And I know you'll come

Come get it, get it, get it
Get it, get it, get it
Get it, get it, get it
Get it, get it, get it

Baby I know that you'll come and get it
When you're good and ready (good and ready)
I know that you'll come and get it
When you find you're good and ready

Baby I can smell it all around you
Can't you tell it lingers in the air?
And I know that you felt it
When the ice around me melted
Then you pulled my hair
(Pulled my hair, pulled my hair)

And I knew it was love
I fit you like a glove

Come get it, get it, get it
Get it, get it, get it
Get it, get it, get it
Get it, get it, get it

Baby I know that you'll come and get it
When you're good and ready
Good and ready

I know that you'll come and get it
When you find you're good and ready

I know that you'll come and get it
When you find you're good and ready
I know, I know that you'll come and get it
When you find you're good and ready
I know, I know that you'll come and get it
When you find you're good and ready
I know that you'll come and get it
When you find you're good and ready

Good and ready
Good and ready
