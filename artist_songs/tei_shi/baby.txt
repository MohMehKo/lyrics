Baby, why you tryna' blame me?
Even though I'm tryin' up on patience
You know I'm the same me, baby
We could try doin' somethin' fun tonight
We both know we're runnin' out of secrets
Only in the daylight, we thrive

Listen here (Oh, baby love)
So don't look at me, I'll disappear (I'm on you)
We can mend this now with a full house
Take a bow and shed a single tear, oh dear
But hold me close, and we can dance to the violins
Let me know, I wanna go down in silence

It's not personal (Oh, baby love)
Just wish I could reverse it all (Can't have it all)
Give me something good and send a wink my way
If it hurts at all, I'll stop the fall
Sleep tight (Oh, baby love)
And dream about me all night (I don't wanna go)
Take a dive and swim inside a memory
Say everything is alright, oh my

If you're in there
Just know that I'm not scared (Don't save me, love)
I'll take you by the shoulder
Squeeze them tight and shake you
'Til I wake you, hey you (Hey!)

To lose you (Oh, baby love)
Is something I refuse to do
If everything's a choice in life just like they say
Well then I choose you, do-do
Hold me close, and we can dance to the violins
Let me know, I wanna go down in silence, silence

Go down
And we can dance to the violins 
Let me know
I'll go down in silence, silence
Baby
Oh, baby love
(I've had enough)
Oh, baby
You know I'm the same me, baby
