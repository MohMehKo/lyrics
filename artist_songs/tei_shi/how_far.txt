A friendly exchange of blame, if you please

If it pleases you to see me struggling
I will talk of the things that I hate in myself

As if I
I'll change
And I'll change
And I'll change
And I'll change
And let's try
How far can I take us
Before it forsakes us?

How far can I take us before it forsakes us?

It's a dangerous slip of the tongue
And if it pleases you to see me struggling, I will

I told you I was coming for you

We'll change
And we'll change

And let's...

How far it can take me before it forsakes me?
