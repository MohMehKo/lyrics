I've been waiting days for ways to carve me in
Popping pills so sadness won't show on my skin
Baby, what's wrong with you?
Can't you see I have an appetite
Wait, what's wrong with me?
Lonely
Lonely, as a satellite
Is it trust, or lack there are that makes me weak?
Is it mine or by design that I am here?
Darling, will you let me live?
This is something I can't give
Darling, you were right for this
This is something I can't mage
Darling, will you let me live?
This is something I can't give
Darling, you were right for this
This is something I can't mage
Darling will you let me live?
This is something I can take
Darling, you were right for this
This is something I can take (satellite)
Darling, will you let me live?
This is something I can take
This is something I can make (satellite)
