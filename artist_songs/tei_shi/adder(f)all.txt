Please fall with me...

Please fall with me
He wants to see my insides
Please fall with me
He wants it, he wants it

I'm not what you want
If you what you want is a lover
I'm not what you need
If what you need is a mother

Please fall with me
Come on, baby, show me what you wanna see in me
Please fall with me
He wants it, he wants it
