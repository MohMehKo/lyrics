I get a very dizzy
I jump through hoops and climb trees
Cover my tracks in the breeze
All in a silent plea
That you'll see me, see me
See me, see me, see me, see me

Why would I ever agree?
Or care about the way you see me?
I'll run away if I please
I'll fight you with apathy, oh
If you'll just go see me, see me
See me, see me, see me

You never look at your surroundings
You only think how they might change
But I'll be like the trees
And I'll grow while no one's watching
And I'll unravel you mister
If you'd just go see me, see me

I get a very dizzy
I jump through hoops and climb trees
Cover my tracks in the breeze
All in a silent plea, oh

You never look at your surroundings
You only think how they might change
But I'll be like a tree
And I'll grow while no one's watching
And I'll unravel you mister
But I'll be like the trees
And I'll grow while no one's watching
And I'll unravel you mister
