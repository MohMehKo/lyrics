In the heat of the moment
You could say that you want me
In the heat of the moment
In the heat of the moment
In the heat of the moment
I could tell you that you want me
In the heat of the moment
In the heat of the moment

But I never wanna ask of you
Anything that's on my mind
Anything to show that I'm
Livin' just in the moment
No, I never wanna say to you
What I keep inside
'Cause when I think about it

You don't know me like you say you do
You see it too
No, no, no, no, baby
You don't know me like you say you do
You see it too
No, no, no, no, baby
You say you do (You say you do)
You say you do (You say you do)
You say you do
And I don't know, baby
You say you do (You say you do)
Please, don't say you do (You say you do)
You say you do
But I don't know, baby

Out in the open and I ask you to hold me
I could feel you on me
In the heat of the moment
But in the cold of the mornin'
When I'm beggin' you to show me
You just slip and leave me lonely
In the cold of the mornin'

But I never wanna ask of you
Anything that's on my mind
Anything to show that I'm
Livin' just in the moment
No, I never wanna say to you
What I keep inside
'Cause when I realize it

You don't know me like you say you do
You see it too
No, no, no, no, baby
You don't know me like you say you do
You see it too
No, no, no, no, baby
You say you do (You say you do)
You say you do (You say you do)
You say you do
And I don't know, baby
You say you do (You say you do)
Please, don't say you do (You say you do)
You say you do
But I don't know, baby

You say you do
What should I do?
Keep loving you?
You say you do
You keep lovin' me
But you don't know me
How can it be?
You say you do

You say you do (You say you do)
You say you do (You say you do)
You say you do
And I don't know, baby
You say you do (You say you do)
Please, don't say you do (You say you do)
You say you do
But I don't know, baby
You say you do (You say you do)
You say you do (You say you do)
(You say a lot of things)
And I don't know, baby
You say you do (You say you do)
Please, don't say you do (You say you do)
'Cause I don't know, baby
