I don't mind it, every meanin'
Everybody, but me
In fact, I'd rather be right here together
Love that part, except they had a heart
They see the urges, hurdles
And just inside, I don't

Compromise anything
Waste time on shiny things
If you know what you seek
Put your legs into it

'Cause, baby, you crawl
Then you walk, then you run the show
Build it up just to watch it fall
What you wanna feel when you hit the floor? (The floor)
Let you talk like you run the show
Build you up just to watch you fall
What you wanna feel when you hit the floor? (The floor)

I don't mind it, every meanin'
Everybody, but me
In fact, I'd rather be right here together
Love that part, except they had a heart
They see the urges, hurdles
And just inside
Don't think about 'em, gonna be
When I hit the floor, will you laugh at me?
Worry about what you gonna do
When you hit the floor, and we laugh with you, don't

Compromise anything
Waste time on shiny things
If you know what you seek
Put your legs into it

'Cause, baby, you crawl
Then you walk, then you run the show
Build it up just to watch it fall
What you wanna feel when you hit the floor? (The floor)
Let you talk like you run the show
Build you up just to watch you fall
What you wanna feel when you hit the floor? (The floor)

Don't compromise anything
Waste time on shiny things
If you know what you seek
Put your legs into it

'Cause, baby, you crawl
Then you walk, then you run the show
Build it up just to watch it fall
What you wanna feel when you hit the floor?
Let you talk like you run the show
Build you up just to watch you fall
What you wanna feel when you hit the floor? (The floor)

'Cause, baby, you crawl
Then you walk, then you run the show
Build it up just to watch it fall
What you wanna feel when you hit the floor?
Let you talk like you run the show
Build you up just to watch you fall
What you wanna feel when you hit the floor? (The floor)
