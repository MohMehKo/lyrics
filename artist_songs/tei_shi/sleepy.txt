I'm tired of knowin' what I need, never chasin' it
On fire, they want me on my knees like I'm suckin' it
I'm fast, but no one gives a shit 'bout the life I live
But tongue tied, they all have a say on the moves I make

Maybe I'll just (sleep, sleep, sleep)
Lay my head down (sleep, sleep, sleep)
Maybe I'll just (sleep, sleep, sleep)
Never be found (sleep, sleep, sleep)

Tell me what I need to to call my faults
And hold them up to me without us weeping
I'm swinging under, please
Can you make an example out of me?
Don't give me no more sympathy

I'm tired, me, I'm all tangled up in the strings in it
I'll die tryna' find my way out their stubborn grip

Maybe I'll just (sleep, sleep, sleep)
Lay my head down (sleep, sleep, sleep)
Maybe I'll just (sleep, sleep, sleep)
Never be found (sleep, sleep, sleep)

Tell me what I need to to call my faults
And hold them up to me without us weeping
I'm swinging under, please
Can you make an example out of me?
Don't give me no more sympathy

Don't give me no more sympathy
Don't give me no more sympathy
(On fire)
Don't give me no more sympathy
(On fire)
Don't give me no more sympathy
(Burn, baby, burn)
Don't give me no more sympathy
(Burn, baby, burn)
Don't give me no more sympathy
(Burn, baby, burn)
Don't give me no more sympathy
(Burn, baby, burn)
Don't give me no more sympathy
(Burn, baby, burn)
(Burn, baby, burn)
(Burn, baby, burn)
