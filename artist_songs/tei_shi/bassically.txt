Baby, I'll behave
If you let me stay
Please don't think
That I'm begging you for love

Baby, let me stay
When the world is gone
Promise I'll behave
Never right your wrongs

Is that what you want?
Like the other boys
Someone you can flaunt
Like the other toys

Is that what you found?
Like the other boys
Someone you can drown
Like the other noise

Baby, I'll behave
If you let me stay
Please don't think
That I'm begging you for love
