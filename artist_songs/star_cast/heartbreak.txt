I love you so
But why I love you
I'll never know
You found a reason for leaving
Soon as I gave my love to you

I'm broken hearted once again
I've been dismissed by my man
Why don't you just understand
I can't handle every night I'm lonely, wishing I could feel your touch
Wanting, waiting, missing you so much
Baby, stop playing, night after night I lay here crying and praying

I really want you by my side
I wanna be the only lover in your life
But all I get is your "goodbye"
(But even though your leaving, cheating, causing me grief
I'm clinging to this love baby)
Maybe, eventually, you fall in love and stay with me

I love you so
But why I love you
I'll never know
You found a reason for leaving
Soon as I gave my love to you

(I keep holding on) 'cause something's holding me
(I'm a puppet) on a set of strings
(Underneath a spell), my sickness vexing me
(I'm looking crazy to all of my friends
With my affair coming to an end)
I can't even start to comprehend
Why I keep on over again

(If I thought I could), I just really would
(Walk right out your life) for the last time
(Leave all this behind) erase you from my mind
(And close the door on you) from all you put me through
(A mess is what I have become for you
No control, oh I'm falling for you)
And even though I'm hurting continuously
Need you to be in my life, baby

I love you so
But why I love you
I'll never know
You found a reason for leaving
Soon as I gave my love to you
