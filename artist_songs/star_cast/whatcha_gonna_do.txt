I told you I'd be your Bonnie, Bonnie
And you could be my Clyde
As long as you love Bonnie, Bonnie
She'll never leave your side

Quarter to one the job was almost done
You stuffed the bag got out the gun
Checking the time on your phone
I saw the texts and now I know
And my finger's on the trigger
And my eyes on you
I'm asking point blank baby
Better tell me the truth

Bad boy, bad boy
Whatcha gonna do
When a good girl's just too good for you?
Bad boy, what will you do
When you're just too bad to be true?
Bad boy, bad boy
Whatcha gonna do
When a good girl's just too good for you?
Bad boy, what will you do
When you're just too bad to be true?
Bad boy, bad boy...
Bad boy, bad boy...

I told you I'd be your Bonnie, Bonnie
And you could be my Clyde
But if you betray Bonnie
You won't sleep too well at night
You shoulda known better making a rookie play
Against a player champion
I take the money and the gun
And then I dial 911
I hope you run faster than them police sirens
'Cause I just skipped town
With the getaway driver

Bad boy, bad boy
Whatcha gonna do
When a good girl's just too good for you?
Bad boy, what will you do
When you're just too bad to be true?
Bad boy, bad boy
Whatcha gonna do
When a good girl's just too good for you?
Bad boy, what will you do
When you're just too bad to be true?
Bad boy, bad boy...
Bad boy, bad boy...

Well, it's a shame you placed
Your one phone call
On the one girl who don't care at all
If you rot in jail for the rest of your life
This is one of them times
You shoulda called your wife, yeah

Bad boy, bad boy
Whatcha gonna do
When a good girl's just too good for you?
Bad boy, bad boy
What will you do
When you're just too bad to be true?
Bad boy, bad boy
Whatcha gonna do
When a good girl's just too good for you?
Bad boy, yeah, what will you do
When you're just too bad to be true?
Bad boy, bad boy...
Bad boy, bad boy...
