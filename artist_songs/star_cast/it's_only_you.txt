Its only you
Its only you
No one could ever make me change my mind
About us together
No matter where I am
Or how far I'm from where you go
Just know that
You are mine
And I am yours forever

If you ever get lost
Don't worry at all
I'll come for you
Because you're all that matters
And we're all that matters
When words get in the way
Know that I care
More than a song could ever say

I want the best for you
I dream of a life where we both end up more than alright, yeah
And if it takes a lifetime then that time is spent by your side
I don't regret it
And I don't apologize
I'm doing my part and keeping us together
As long as you remember that
I am yours and
You are mine forever

Its only you,
Its only you,
No one could ever make me change my mind
About us together
No matter where I am
Or how far I'm from where you go
I want you to always know

You are my heart
Even when it hurts
Take my love
When you can't give in return
We'll risk it all
We will not fail
And so what if we do
'Cause I'll still have you

If you ever get lost, lost, lost
Don't worry at all
I'll come for you
Because you're all that matters
And we're all that matters
When words get in the way
Know that I care
More than a song could ever say

Its only you
Its only you

Its only you
