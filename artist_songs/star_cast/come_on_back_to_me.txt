There's a light
Inside the dark
See the days are long and cold and broken
Filled with scars
I know it ain't easy
To keep movin' on
So you can come on home to me

Stay with me baby
Baby, baby
I'm here for you
I'm here for you
Through the rain and the battles, whatever
I'll be there, too
'Cause it ain't time to go
Yeah, this I know
Yeah, this I know
We got much more to do
So come on, come on back
Come, come back
To me

I've been through it all, battered and bruised
This life... It ain't no way
For no one to live
My broken spirit's had enough
I can't stay
The system has failed
I'm goin' through hell
And I just want my mother's love again
Want to run into her arms

Don't go, don't go, come on back
Come on home, baby, back to me
Don't leave 'cause I need you back
Come and lay your head down next to me

I know it ain't easy
To keep movin' on so you can
Come on home to me
You don't have to stay
Come take my hand
You've had enough
I'll wipe your tears away with all of my love
My love

So, come on back
(Come on home)
Don't you leave, don't you go
(Come on, baby)
I need you here
(Come to my arms, let me hold you)
Don't leave me
On my own
(Just one time)
I want you home
I need you close
Right here in my arms
So come on back
(So come on home)
To me
