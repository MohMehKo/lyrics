Don't you bring no bad news
I've had enough
I need to free my soul
I been up I been down criticized
Running from bondage, oh

Time is up, had enough
I had some things to go change
I, I, I ain't no more pretty girl no

Pray for downfall
Hold your breath and see me fail
A cold day in hell
You brought your coat but I know
I'm a winner
It's hurts you to see me excel
Haters wish you well
Before you go, tell me what you waiting for

It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright

Don't make me no difference
Don't pay me no never mind
I'm out here in my bad
You can duplicate
My style, my flow, my shoes, my hair, my coat
But you ain't got this swag

Pray for downfall
Hold your breath and see me fail
A cold day in hell
You brought your coat but I know
I'm a winner
It's hurts you to see me excel
Haters wish you well
Before you go, tell me what you waiting for

It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright

Came from the bottom
No stopping me now
Putting my hand to the clouds
Put them down down down down OH

No cares no problems
No worries now, cause I'm better now
The joy I found [x4]

It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright

It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
