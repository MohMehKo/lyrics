Oh oh no no baby it's 3 o'clock in the morning
I figured this call might wake you up
But I can't wait till the morning
I'm on my fifth round and I don't care
I'm turnt up so wake up
Oh you oh you gotta hear me babe
You need to feel me baby
I'm so tired too tired all the things you do
I don't know why I ain't never been tricked like this
But I ain't never been kissed like this except by you by you
I ain't never been loved like this
I ain't never been touched I ain't never gave a fuck like this

And it just makes me hate and love you more
I just don't get it baby

Don't know why I keep on crushing on you babe
Save my loving for you babe
Keep on seeing you needing you like I do
Cause no one makes me this mad
No one gets me this turned on
But no one makes me this sad
Baby I don't know why I
Keep on falling for you babe
Keep on calling on you babe
Keep on seeing you needing you like I do
Cause no one else has your touch
No one else has your problem
No one makes me feel loved like you

When we first started out everything was great
Stayed hand in hand even though
We was both like night and day
But when I think back I'm afraid that I don't know exactly where at but
You flipped the script changed the words hold up its coming back
Now I remember clearly it was a Saturday you came walking in tip toeing
Through the halls all soft cause you thought I was sleeping and what's this (what's this)
Smelling like perfume I don't wear olives on your breath
Even though you hate martinis with a twist

And it just makes me hate and love you more I just don't get it baby

Don't know why I keep on crushing on you babe
Save my loving for you babe
Keep on seeing you needing you like I do
Cause no one makes me this mad
No one gets me this turned on but no one makes me this sad
Baby I don't know why I
Keep on falling for you babe
Keep on calling on you babe
Keep on seeing you needing you like I do
Cause no one else has your touch
No one else has your problem
No one makes me feel loved like you

Need you when I hate it that I need you like I do
Want you so I love it that I want you like I do
Crave you and I hate it that I crave you like I do
Love you so I love it that I love you like I do

Need you when I hate it that I need you like I do
Want you so I love it that I want you like I do
Crave you and I hate it that I crave you like I do
Love you so I love it that I love you like I do

Don't know why I
Keep on crushing on you babe
Save my loving for you babe (I said I don't know why)
Keep on seeing you needing you (I keep on standing by)
Like I do cause no one makes (and you keep on acting foul)
Me this mad no one gets (this time you crossed the line)
Me this turned on (never would've thought you'd put your hands on me I)
But no one makes me this sad (you done lost your fucking mind)
Baby I don't know why I keep on falling for you babe (and I'm bout to lose mine)
Keep on calling on you babe keep on seeing you needing you like I do (cause I love you, love you, love you, love you, but I do)
Cause no one else has your touch (said I hate you love you hate you love you)
No one else has your problem no one makes me feel loved like you (and no one makes me feel loved like you)

Oh no no no
