I heard a couple of bad things when you were with me
I used to think it was gossip, I shouldn't believe
While I was going around thinking you're my baby (oh yeah)
Boy you were takin' the sugar from every lady

Boy it went on, and on, and on
Yeah, it went on for way too long (whoa, my babe)

It ain't about what you got
It's all about what you do with it
Ain't about what you got
It's all about what you do with it
How does someone so sexy be so damn repulsive, babe?
It ain't about what you got
It's all about what you do with it

Baby, all of my ladies are hittin' me up saying
"You better open your eyes girl, your boy's been playing"
(You know he's been playing)
Even though on the outside you looking so tasty
Baby boy on the inside, you're nothing but shady

Boy it went on, and on, and on
Yeah, it went on for way too long (whoa, my baby)

It ain't about what you got
It's all about what you do with it
Ain't about what you got
It's all about what you do with it
How does someone so sexy be so damn repulsive, babe?
It ain't about what you got
It's all about what you do with it

It ain't about what?
(Na na na...)
It's all about what?
(Na na na...)
It ain't about what?
(Na na na...)
It's all about what?

On, and on, and on
Went on for way too long
On, and on, and on
Went on for way too long

It ain't about what you got
It's all about what you do with it
Ain't about what you got
It's all about what you do with it
How does someone so sexy be so damn repulsive, babe?
It ain't about what you got
It's all about what you do with it
