You make me feel
Like I've never been in love before,
Got me wishin', got me hopin' it's real
'Cause I never had someone like you,
No I never knew a love like you, yeah

Feelin' crazy 'cause you know I care, yeah
You the only one to take me there,
Every second, every hour I'm fightin' for air, yeah
I can't make this feeling disappear

I'm starting to trust you, it's scary to know that the loving is strong,
I gotta use caution, can't tell what's right from wrong,
It comes when you touch me, boy, you don't know,
But there's something different with you, Lord knows

You make me feel
Like I've never been in love before,
Got me wishin', got me hopin' it's real
'Cause I never had someone like you,
No, I never knew a love like you,

Can't you see that, baby, all I want is you, you, you,
Ain't nobody else gone know the things you do, do, do
I'd go crazy if I'd ever were to lose, lose, lose
Yeah, I'm in love, but I never felt all the way you love,

I'm starting to trust you, it's scary to know that the loving is strong,
I gotta use caution, can't tell what's right from wrong,
Feel it when you touch me, boy, you don't know,
But there's something different with you, Lord knows

You make me feel
Like I've never been in love before,
Got me wishin', got me hopin' it's real
'Cause I never had someone like you,
No, I never knew a love like you,

Yeah, I think a bitch in love,
You, you, you, you,
You the only one I want,
I don't know what's gotten into me,
Got me slurring all up in my speech,
You got every single part of me, part of me,

If I let you in, don't you let me down,
Never thought you'd be the one I wanna be around,
Let me hear you say you love me,
Let me hear you say it loud,
I'd be showing more affection,
Damn, it's crazy how...

You make me feel
Like I've never been in love before,
Got me wishin', got me hopin' it's real
'Cause I never had someone like you,
No, I never knew a love like you,
