My friends say that I'm crazy
(You crazy girl)
Cause I give you my love
But you my little sexy baby
You do it to me good

I like to have you all around both day and night
I love the way you take me out to wine and dine
They say I need to slow it down
But I don't mind, cause they don't understand
That I don't need no man, no I don't need no man

To make me feel good
Let that be understood
Treat me like you know you should
No I don't-I don't need no man
I got a real job
I got my own car
And I'll protect my heart
No I don't-I don't need no man
And you know
I'll send you running toward the door
Go, go, go...
They just don't understand
That I don't no need man
But you know that I ain't playing
Cause I don't need no man
No I don't need no man

I don't need no man, man, man
Love the way you like to hold my hand, hand, hand
Oh such a gentlemen you give me what I want
And if I had the choice I'd never leave this man alone

I like to have you all around both day and night
I love the way you take me out to wine and dine
They say I need to slow it down
But I don't mind, cause they don't understand
That I don't need no man, no I don't need no man

To make me feel good
Let that be understood
Treat me like you know you should
No I don't-I don't need no man
I got a real job
I got my own car
And I'll Protect my heart
No I don't-I don't need no man
And you know
I'll send you running toward the door
Go, go, go...
They just don't understand
That I don't no need man
But you know that I ain't playing
Cause I don't need no man
No I don't need no man

I don't need no man but I know you know
That boy you are the only one I wanna be loving on
Aye just don't get too comfortable right now that I'm feeling you
I let it all burn if you show me you want me too
I don't need no drama in my life won't deal with it
I ain't about to worry all night you know this
Love come wrapped up tight with a ribbon on it
And I don't need no man to make me happy I really want you
But I don't need no man

To make me feel good
Let that be understood
Do me like you know you should
No I don't-I don't need no man
I got a real job
I got my own car
And I'll protect my heart
No I don't-I don't need no man
And you know
I'll send you running toward the door
Go, go, go...
They just don't understand
That I don't no need man
But you know that I ain't playing
Cause I don't need no man
No I don't need no man
