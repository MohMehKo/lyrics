Baby what's up?
What you want, what you need, as for me, I ain't never been afraid of love
No I ain't never been the type to be shy, I know everything you thinking of
If you're looking for the one night, that ain't what I like
But if you don't stop, then I won't stop
I'll give you everything I got, whoa

You told me you're looking for love (looking for love)
For love
So don't look, so don't look no further you got it
Someone to tell you secrets to trust, to trust
So don't look, so don't look no further you got it

Now we been kinda getting 'long, talking on the phone
Last thing before bed, first thing in the morn'
You been dropping 'lil hints, talking real slick
Tryna make me feel like if there was a list
That you'd be on top, number one spot
Well baby take your time, I got only one heart
But if you don't stop, then I won't stop
I'll give you everything I got, hey, say

You told me you're looking for love (looking for love)
For love
So don't look, so don't look no further you got it
Someone to tell you secrets to trust, to trust
So don't look, so don't look no further you got it

Baby, baby I wanna be the
The one you love to call on
The one you know you're needing
Oh baby, baby I wanna be the
The one you love to call on
The one you know you needing, oh

Quiero amarte (I wanna love you)
Necisito amarte (I wanna love you)
Voy a amarte por siempre (I'm gonna love you forever baby)
Quiero amarte (I wanna love you)
Necisito amarte
But if you don't stop, then I won't stop
I'll give you everything I got, ooh-oh-oh

You told me you're looking for love (looking for love)
For love
So don't look, so don't look no further you got it
Someone to tell you secrets to trust, to trust
So don't look, so don't look no further you got it

You told me you're looking for love (looking for love)
For love
So don't look, so don't look no further you got it
Someone to tell you secrets to trust, to trust
So don't look, so don't look no further you got it
