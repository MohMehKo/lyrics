I've been fighting shadows my whole life
Struggling with what's wrong and what's right
Until I found my light on a dark night
I've been searching for nothing
'Cause I've been, I've been
More than enough for too long
I've been weary waiting but
The time is now

So I'll be on
My way back home
To find the girl I used to know
I'll find where I belong
I'll be there
Even if I take the long way home
Even if I take the long way home

'Cause the children's spirits stolen for power
Don't know their names or their faces, but they're ours
We've been searching for something
But we know we've been
More than enough for so long...

So I'll be on
My way back home
To find the girl I used to know
Even if I take the long way home
Even if I take the long way home

Broken street lights is all that I know
But them streets ain't paved with gold far as I know
'Cause the children's spirits stolen for power
Don't know their names or their faces, but they're ours
We've been searching for something
But we know we've been
More than enough for so long

So I will be on
My way back home
To find the girl I used to know...
