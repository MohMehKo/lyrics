Do I l-l-l-l-love you?, Oh yes 
Do I w-w-w-w-want you?, Oh yes 

Yes, I want you, Yes, I need you 
Yes, truly I do, Yes 

Does the touch of your hand 
Take me through wonderland? 
Will my love be deeper than the sea? 
Y-y-y-yes, yes, oh yes 

Do you re-re-re-remember? 
The night we met? 
Won't you please remember? 
How could you forget? 

I vowed it then 
I vow it now 
I vow to make you mine somewhere 
Yes, yes, oh yes
