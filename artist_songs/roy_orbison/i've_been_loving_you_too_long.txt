I've been loving you a little too long
To stop right now
You're tired, and you wanna be free
My love is growing stronger
As you become a habit to me
Ooh, and loving you a little too long
I don't wanna stop right now
Oh with you my life has been so wonderful
I just can't stop now

You're tired and your love is growing cold
My love is growing stronger
As our affair grows old
And I've been loving you a little too long
I don't wanna stop now

Ooh, too long, long
Don't wanna stop my loving you right now
No, oh I've been loving you a little too long
To stop right now
Ooh, loving you a little too long
To stop right now

No, no, I can't stop now. no
Loving you a little too long
To stop right now, I can't stop...
