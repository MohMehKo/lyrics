Mama, just had to call, oh, Mama 
Your baby boy just had his heart 
Broken in two, she said we're through 
But to send her best to you. 
Oh, Mama, I'd like to run to you, Mama. 
I'd come home today, leave right away, 
But things won't work that way 
Gotta stay, be a man, 
If I can, Mama. 

No, Mom, I don't know. I called her tonight. 
No, not at home. Yeah, you're probably right. 
Yes, I'll take care of myself. No, I'll be alright. 
I'll go to bed early tonight. 
Oh, Mama, tell Dad I think of him, Mama. 
How's Uncle Joe, my puppy, Coco,
Tell them hello, oh, better go 
But gosh, I loved her so. 

Umm, Mama, don't worry so much, darling Mama. 
Now, Mama don't cry, just say goodbye, 
Can't have us both in tears, oh, Mom, you know me. 
Yes, I'll always be your baby through all the years.
