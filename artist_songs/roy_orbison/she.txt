She was the wind, the earth and sky
She was the one who made me laugh and cry
She was cake and she was wine
She was fun and she was mine

She'd lie lie lie to me  
And I'd believe her 
She'd cry and cry and cry for me
I couldn't leave her

No one could hurt, no one could flirt
And no one could smile like she could
She was misery and sorrow
She was reason for tomorrow

The smile of the cat was on her face
A Chaparral she love to run the race
The style of the fox men embrace
To know her was to love her
And no one could treat me like she could

She was just a little girl
She was a woman of the world
She was all my dreams
She was many things
But she is, she was, she'll always be 
A woman
