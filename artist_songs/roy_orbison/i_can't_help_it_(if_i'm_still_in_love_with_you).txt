Today I passed you on the street
And my heart was at your feet
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
Somebody else stood by you're side
And he looked so satisfied
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you.

A picture from the past came slowly stealing
As I bruced your arm and walked so close to you.
And suddenly I got that old time feeling
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you.

It's hard to know that other lips will kiss you
And hold you close the way I used to do
Oh heaven only knows how much I miss you
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you..
