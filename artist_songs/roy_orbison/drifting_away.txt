Sadness slips into the room 
On silent steps of sorrow 
Stealing sleep and all my dreams 
Where will we be tomorrow? 

Lying with you, crying with you, drifting 
Talking till dawn yet we go on, drifting 
Don't understand where we began just drifting apart 
Drifting apart feeling alone drifting away 

We can't seem to work it out 
drifting from day to day 
Wasn't it all about, drifting away 
Drifting away, drifting away 

Losing the feeling 
And now the music of the song is almost gone 
That we used to play 
From sweet surrender from drifting away, drifting 

Two lovers lost two rivers crossed, drifting 
Two bridges burned, no lesson learned, drifting 
Lonely together, hurting each other 
Still we can't say that it's over 
Can we bring back yesterday? 
Will we be forever, forever drifting away 
Drifting, drifting away
