We walk in shadows, we talk in shadows 
We date in shadows dark and cold 

But wait, it will be alright 
Wait, baby hold me so tight 
I hate to break your loving heart in two 
But wait, I can't stay away from you. 

I promise you I'll be with you tomorrow night 
I have to wait until the time is right 

Yeah wait a little longer now 
Wait a little stronger now 
Wait a little longer now for me 
Oh what you do to me 
Wait now until I am free 

Yeah Yeah Yeah wait a little longer now 
Wait a little stronger now for me 
Wait, come on come on girl 
Wait, try to be strong girl
