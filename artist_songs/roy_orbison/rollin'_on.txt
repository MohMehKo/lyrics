Wagons loaded full up ain't got time to pull up 
On my way to Frisco back to San Fransisco 
Rolling on Rolling on to San Fransisco 
Rolling on to Frisco bay 

Rolling on and lady luck is getting bolder 
The high sheriff man looking over my shoulder yeah 
Rolling on, rolling on, rolling on 

Kicking up the hot dust San Fransisco or bust 
Don't want to delay now hey I'm on my way now 
Rolling on rolling on to San Fransisco 
Rolling on to Frisco bay 

Rolling on and lady luck is getting bolder 
The high sheriff man looking over my shoulder yeah 
Rolling on, rolling on, rolling on 

Born a loser not me ain't no troubles got me 
Can't afford to be late San Fransisco won't wait 
Rolling on, rolling on
