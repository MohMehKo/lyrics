I knew many loves before I met you 
But I'll never love again 
I could probably know others too  
But I'll never love again 
Thats enough knowing your love 
I'll never love again
I'll never love again
I held many girls before I held you 
But I'll never love again 
I could probably hold others too 
But I'll never love again
Thats enough knowing your love 
I'll never love again
I'll never love again
I'll never love again
I'll never love again
