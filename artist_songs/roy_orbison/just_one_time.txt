If I could see you just one time 
Oh, how it'd ease my troubled mind 
If I could hold you just one time 
And then pretend that you're still mine 

Lips that used to thrill me so 
They now thrill someone else I know 
Gone is the love that once was mine 
Wish I could see you just one time 

Oh, oh, oh, oh I miss you so 
Oh, I need you so 
I'd, I'd, I'd give this heart of mine 
If I could see you just one time 

Wish I could relive just one time 
Turn back the pages and there I'd find 
That same old love that once was mine 
Wish I could see you just one time 

Oh, oh, oh, oh I miss you so 
Oh, I need you so 
I'd, I'd, I'd give this heart of mine 
If I could see you just one time 
Mmmm...
