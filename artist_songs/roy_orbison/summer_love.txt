Autumn Leaves, when they fall 
Whisper to the wind, ringing out, telling all 
Of the summer's end. 
Now you're gone far away, how I long to hear you say 
"I love you." 

Whirling leaves, swirling leaves tell me I'm alone 
Wishing you were here with me longing for you home. 
Winter nights are lonely nights how I long to hold you tight 
I miss you. 

A gentle breeze in the trees will tell me spring is here 
And I feel anxiety knowing you'll be near. 
Summer nights, I'll hold you tight 
Under the moon above you'll be my summer love. 

When summer's here and you are near every day I'll pray 
Autumn leaves will never come and with me you'll stay 
You will mean more to me, yes, you'll be 
More than just a summer love
