Another day, another night 
Another tired old country song 
You know, I sing of love delight 
But I know it's all wrong 

The life I live out on the road 
Is one I swear no one could love 
Yet I feel I must go on 
And sing this tired 
This tired old Country song 

I move around from place to place 
But all the towns look just the same 
I see the same old face 
Losin' still my claim to fame 

I'll sing the guitar blues 
Drink my drink and pay the dues 
Then I guess I'll ramble on 
And sing this tired 
This tired old country song 

Why did I have to compromise 
To reach my piece of the fame? 
Life could have been so different 
In that eight to five game 

So I guess I'll settle down 
Get my feet back on the ground 
Once a country star 
Now I'm just a country clown 

Hang my guitar on the wall 
I won't need it anymore 
For I think the time has come 
To end this tired 
This tired old country song 
To end this tired 
This tired old country song
