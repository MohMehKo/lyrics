I see through teardrops 
That old clock on the wall 
The hands are far apart 
They tell me that my heart misses you 
And you're not with me 
Guess it's time to cry 
Yes it's time to cry 

I hear the doorbell 
The postman just came by 
All he ever brings 
Are bills and nothing things 
Oh no, he returned your letter 
And it's time to cry 
Yes it's time to cry 

Time to cry 
Ever since you said goodbye 
Time to cry 
What else can I do but cry over you? 

I just can't stand it 
The telephone won't ring 
The sun is out of sight 
Another lonely night begins 
And you're not mine 
Guess it's time to cry 
Yes it's time to cry
