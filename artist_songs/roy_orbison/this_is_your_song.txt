This is your song, to let you know how much I love you 
You have my heart and I know I can't live without you 

This is your song, to keep you when the nights are lonely 
Only for you darling, you're all that I've waited for 
And this song, my love is yours for evermore 

And through the years you can be sure that I'll be faithful 
My love for you will ever grow and this I will do 
I will give my heart and song to you
