I never thought it could be like this 
Give me another kiss if you don't mind, one more time 
To flatter you with many stories 
Used cliches that would be boring 
Would just waste time, precious time 
I don't have to say a thing 
It's written on my face 
Any doubt that you still have 
Let our love erase 

[Chorus:]
We're into something good and you know it 
We're into something good don't be afraid to show it 
We're into something good, baby 

I don't see how you conceal it 
There's no way that you can't feel it, when we do what we do 
Now you can't get this close to me 
Send all these vibrations through me 
And not know what to do 
So wipe the tears away 
Don't be afraid of me 
Love between us should come 
Oh so free and easy 

[Chorus]

We're into something good, baby 

[Chorus]
