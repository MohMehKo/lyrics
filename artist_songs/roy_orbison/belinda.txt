Oh sweet, sweet Belinda 
They say that you are looking for a home 
Fresh out of a love affair 
Fresh out of hope 
Fresh out of dreams 

I know you're as strong as any human can be 
But you need love, why don't you take it from me? 
I know I ain't much, but you can have me for free 
Belinda 

Oh sweet, sweet Belinda 
You don't owe me no gratitude or love 
We're just two souls stuck here 
Two lonely rivers filled with light 

Two lights shining on the darkness ahead 
Two feet touching in a cold winters bed 
I promised you safety, but I loved you instead 
Belinda 

Oh-oh Belinda I'd die of loneliness 
If you ever left, Belinda 

Oh-oh Belinda I'd die of loneliness 
If you ever left, Belinda
