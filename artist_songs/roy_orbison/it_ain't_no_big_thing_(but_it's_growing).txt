You're losing interest in me, and it's showing. 
It ain't no big thing, but it's growing. 
The pain of heartbreak, I've just starting knowing. 
It ain't no big thing, but it's growing. 

Everyday the hurt grows bigger than before. 
But I'll pretend that I don't notice, 
If I can hold you one day more. 

You got the look of someone who is going. 
You're gonna leave me and it's showing. 
A little tear I can feel, start to flowing. 
It ain't not big thing, but it's growing.
