There's got to be a morning after, if we can hold on through the night 
We have a chance to find the sunshine let's keep on looking for the light 
Oh can't you see the morning after? it's waiting right outside the storm 
Why don't we cross the bridge together and find a place that's safe and warm? 

It's not too late, we should be giving, only with love can we we climb 
It's not too late, not while we're living, let's put our hands out in time 
There's got be a morning after, we're moving closer to the shore 
I know we'll be there by tomorrow and we'll escape the darkness 
We won't be searching anymore 

There's got be a morning after, we're moving closer to the shore 
I know we'll be there by tomorrow and we'll escape the darkness 
We won't be searching anymore 

There's got be a morning after 
There's got be a morning after 
There's got be a morning after
