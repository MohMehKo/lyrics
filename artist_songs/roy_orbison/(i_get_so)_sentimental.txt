I get so ooh sentimental 
Darling when it comes to you, 
I'm just too ooh sentimental 
And its breaking my heart in two. 

I said a-hey,hey now 
At the end of the day now, 
I get carried away now 
Thinking of you, ooh 

How you looked that night, 
You kissed goodbye just right, 
Then turned away 
And I miss you night and day. 

Hey,a-hey, hey now, 
At the end of the day now, 
I get carried away now, 
Thinking of you, ooh 

Who holds you tight?, 
I wonder where you are, 
Are you alright 
For you know, I still love you, 

But I'm just so sentimental, 
Baby because of you, 
Yes I'm just too sentimental 
And it's, breaking my heart in two...
