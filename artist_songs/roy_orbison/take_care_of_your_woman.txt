Take care of your woman, don't treat her mean 
Make her feel like a woman and she won't ever leave 

When she's walking in the darkness, be the light she needs 
Give her dreams for tomorrow and she won't ever leave 

Take care of your woman and make her know that you care 
Let her know that you love her, you want her, you need her and she'll always be right there 

Through the storms of emotion be the calm that she needs 
Be a rock of devotion and she will never leave 

Take care of your woman and make her know that you care 
Let her know that you love her, you want her, you need her and she'll always be right there 

Through the storms of emotion be the calm that she needs 
Be a rock of devotion and she will never leave
