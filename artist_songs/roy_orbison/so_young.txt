Dawn comes up so young, dreams begin so young 
And if you live just for today the day may soon be done 
But there's a place where dreams always stay so young 

A place to hear the sun go down and fade away 
To see the wind just run away with yesterday 
Anyplace for those who care Zabriskie Point is anywhere 
Time runs out so fast on love too good to last, so young 

A time to look forever's there or never found 
To touch the sky and really feel the world go round 
To live to love to laugh to cry to be alone 
Young, so young love was meant to be wild and free 
So young young, so young love is space in life 
A place in time a state of mind too late I find 
When tomorrow's gone and love is lost so young
