Where is tomorrow? An island of dreams. 
Where is tomorrow? Flying on golden wings, tomorrow. 

Where is tomorrow? The end of time. 
Where is tomorrow? You're no longer mine. 

Tomorrow, tomorrow. I'll get over you. 
Tomorrow, tomorrow. When tomorrow comes, 
Then I'll stop loving you, tomorrow. 

Where is tomorrow? Tomorrow is gone. 
Gone losting stardust, hiding from the dawn. 
Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow. 

I long for tomorrow.
I'll be strong tomorrow. 
I want cry for you tomorrow. 
Where is tomorrow? 
Where is tomorrow? 
Tomorrow.
