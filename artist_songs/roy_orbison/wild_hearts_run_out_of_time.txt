You're gone again this morning. 
How long will you keep running on and on. 
Can't you see the warning. 
I need you more than ever. 
Before you're gone forever. 
Please don't let your heart run out of time. 

Wild hearts run out of time. 
When you're up against the night. 
Don't stand there all alone. 
In the dying of the light. 

Wild hearts run out of time. 
And you'll need a love like mine. 
To show you hope is there. 
In the sunshine of your mind. 
Wild hearts run out of time. 

Don't let this old world turn you. 
Don't let the wild life hurt you anymore. 
Don't let the bright lights burn you. 
Please don't stand there crying. 
Because the time is flying. 
I can't let your heart run out of time. 

Wild hearts run out of time. 
When you're up against the night. 
Don't stand there all alone. 
In the dying of the light. 

Wild hearts run out of time. 
And you'll need a love like mine. 
To show you hope is there 
In the sunshine of your mind. 
Wild hearts run of time. 

It could be yours or mine. 
It happens all the time. 
Wild hearts run out of time. 

It could be yours or mine. 
It happens all the time. 
Wild hearts run out of time. 
Wild hearts run out of time.
