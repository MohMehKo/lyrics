I'm in a blue blue mood 
Now that you're gone away 
I'm in a blue blue mood 
It's been a lonesome day 
I'm in a blue blue mood 
I see you everywhere
I reach out to hold you 
But you're not there 
It's just my blue blue mood. 

Maybe, someday, yeah love will come 
And stay, and things will turn 
Out right, oh oh oh but for tonight 
I'm in a blue blue mood. 

I'm in a blue blue mood 
I'm in a blue blue mood 
I'm in a blue blue mood.
