You wink your eye at every guy 
Don't you know you're gonna cry 
You say hello to every Joe 
You're gonna know, I told you so 
You're everybody's baby, everybody's knockin' on your door 
But then one day, they're gonna say 
That you're nobody's baby no more 
Ah-ah, you'll cry when they say bye-bye 
Ah-ah, you're gonna cry 
Then dry your eyes, and quit your cryin' 
And be nobody's baby but mine
