Morning comes into my room, through pretty purple curtains 
And looks upon a man so satisfied, I hold a woman in my arms 
And watch her while she's sleeping, and I know that I'm the man on Suzie's mind 

I'm the pretty dress she buys, I'm the little bug she drives 
I'm the picture that she shows to everybody that she knows 
I'm the wiggle in her walk, I'm the giggle in her talk 
I'm the happy little song she sings, she wears my love for all to see 

Sail on by, silver moon, I won't follow you this time 
I've got heaven in my arms tonight, I'm the man on Suzie's mind 
I'm the stops on her way home, I'm the dime in the telephone 
I'm the honey that she talks about, I'm the old meanie when she pouts 

I'm the carpet, need her feet every night before she sleeps 
I'm the pillow where she lays her head, I'm the last word that she said 
Sail on by, silver moon, I won't follow you this time 
I've got heaven in my arms tonight, I'm the man on Suzie's mind 
I've got heaven in my arms tonight, I'm the man on Suzie's mind 
I've got heaven in my arms tonight, I'm the man on Suzie's mind...
