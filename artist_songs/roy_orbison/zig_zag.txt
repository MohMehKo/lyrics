You have got me going zig zag 
Gets my mind to blowing zig zag 
You can't lose me if you try zig zag zig zag 
Pass it on by 

I don't need no highing zig zag 
Girl you got me flying zig zag 
I can nearly touch the sky zig zag zig zag 
Pass it on by 

You have got my heart turned on 
Why don't you push it on ahead 
Till your heart turns on 
You've got love and our lovin' is dead 

Instead of wishing for the knowing zig zag 
The way you got me going zig zag 
I'm so glad you caught my eye zig zag zig zag 
Pass it on by 

You have got my heart turned on 
Why don't you push it on ahead 
Till your heart turns on 
You've got love and our lovin' is dead 

Instead of wishing for the knowing zig zag 
The way you got me going zig zag 
I'm so glad you caught my eye zig zag zig zag 
Pass it on by 

Pass it on by...
