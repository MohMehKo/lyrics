When I stop dreaming that's when I'll stop loving you 

The worst that I've ever been hurt in my life 
The first time I ever have wanted to die 
Was the night when you told me you loved someone new 
And asked me if I could forget 

When I stop dreaming that's when I'll stop loving you 

You may teach the flowers to bloom in the snow 
you may take a pebble and teach it to grow 
you may teach the raindrops to return to the sky 
But you can't teach my heart to forget 

When I stop dreaming that's when I'll stop loving you 

When I stop dreaming that's when I'll stop loving you
