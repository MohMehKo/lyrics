May the world you live in bring the good life 
That grows sweeter as it mellows with time 
May the world you live in be a world love lives in 
A love like your love and mine 

May the children you bear bring contentment 
As you guide them with your gentle hand 
May you know all the things true love can bring 
Between a woman and a man 

May the dreams that you build always be filled 
Keep the love shining in your eyes 
If the bad times or the sad times ever come to you 
Let this man be the one that you always turn to 

May the seasons of your life touch you gently 
And may happiness you always find 
May these arms that surround you always be around you 
And the world that you live in forever be mine
