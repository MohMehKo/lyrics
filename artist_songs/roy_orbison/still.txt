Still, still.
I'm still in love with you. 
Still, still.
I can't love someone new. 

No one can take your place.
No one ever will. 
Oh my darling, I love love you still. 

Still, still.
I miss your magic touch. 
Still, still.
I need you oh so much. 

No one shares my embrace, 
No one ever will. 
Oh my darling I love you, love you still. 

Why did you have to go? 
Why did you deceive me? 
Come back my darling and never leave me. 

Oh still, still.
My heart still aches for you. 
Still, still.
It almost breaks in two. 

No one can take your place.
No one ever will. 
Oh my darling I love you, love you still.
