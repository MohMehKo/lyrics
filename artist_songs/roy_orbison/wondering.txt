Wondering, wondering, I wonder what to say 
Wondering, wondering, I wonder what to do 
Will your love be true, or will you run away 

When you have been alone, without love, all alone 
You wonder what you'll feel when new love comes along 
Is it really real? 

Ah ... aaaah ... aaah, 
I wonder. 

Wondering, wondering, I wonder all the time 
Wondering, wondering, are you really mine? 
Will your love be true or will I wonder 
Till the end of time?
