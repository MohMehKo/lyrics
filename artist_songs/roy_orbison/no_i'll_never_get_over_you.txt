I could find another girl to kiss m, I could find another girl to miss me. 
I could find another girl who wants to be true, but I'll never get over you. 
I got over Marie Lou.I got over Suzie Q, I got over Connie too. 
I get over losing you to somebody new, but I'll never get over you. 

No I'll never get over you, ah ah, oh no, ah ah. 
No I'll never get over you oh no, my heart tells me so. 
I don't know just what there is about you, but I know that I can't live without you. 

I could find another girl to flirt with, I could find another girl to hurt with. 
I could find another girl almost like you, but I'll never get over you. 
I got over Linda Lou, I got over Peggie Sue, I got over Betty too. 
I got over losing you to somebody new, but I'll never get over you. 
No I'll never get over you oh no, ah ah ah, oh no. 
No I'll never get over you, oh no, my heart tells me so. 
No I'll never get over you...
