I know you tried your best to love me 
You smiled when your heart told you to weep 
You tried to pretend that you were happy 
Ooh last night I heard you crying in your sleep 

You gave the best years of your life, dear 
And each precious vow you tried to keep 
I love you so much I want you happy 
Ooh last night I heard you crying in your sleep 

Your heart is yearning for an old love 
With new love it's useless to compete 
It hurts me to know that you're unhappy 
Yeah last night I heard you crying in your sleep 

You know that you are free to go, dear 
And don't mind me if I weep 
I know I can never make you happy 
Cos last night I heard you crying in your sleep
