She come from Kansas City, lookin' mighty pretty 
She's as sweet as Kansas City wine 
Oh, it's such a pity, she won't wanna kiss me 
She won't hang her love out on the line 
No, she won't hang her love out on the line 

A mystery to me, she's not what you see 
She's a strong, mighty woman who loves to disagree 
If I could just talk to her 
I know that I could fool her 
But she won't hang her love out on the line 

She don't care for nothin' she holds onto her lovin' 
I wonder if she'd ever change her mind? 
I'll fall in behind her, hopin' that I find her 
When she hangs her love out on the line 
When she hangs her love out on the line 

A mystery to me, she's not what you see 
She's a strong, mighty woman who loves to disagree 
If I could just talk to her 
I know that I could fool her 
But she won't hang her love out on the line 

I'd take her lovin', I'd take her lovin' 
I'd take her lovin' anytime 
I want her lovin', I need her lovin' 
but she won't hang her love out on the line 
she won't hang her love out on the line 
she won't hang her love out on the line 
No,she won't hang her love out on the line 
she won't hang her love out on the line
