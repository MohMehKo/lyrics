Roly-oly on now, river 
Roly-oly on your way 
Roly-oly on now river 
Wash my cares away 

River so wide and so deep 
Wake the sandman from his sleep 
River remind him 
He has a promise to keep 

Roll on, mighty river 
Running wild and free 
Get along now, river 
Bring a dream to me 

Hey now, river 
Go down, River 
Don't slow down, river 
Bring a dream for me 

Roly-oly on now, river 
Roly-oly on your way 
Roly-oly on now river 
Take my troubles away 

Robin Hood river, roll on 
Go steal a dream from the dawn 
River, you'll find me 
Where all the dreamers have gone 

Roll on, mighty river 
Running wild and free 
Get along now, river 
And bring a dream to me 

Hey now, river 
Go down, River 
Don't slow down, river 
Bring that dream for me
