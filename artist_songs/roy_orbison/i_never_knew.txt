I never knew how much I'd miss your touch till you said good bye 
I never knew you'd hurt me too, till you made me cry 
It never seemed you ever dreamed of hurting me this way 
You said we're through what could I do I never knew 
(never knew) 
You left and you went away after saying never ever let me go oh 

Now it's over and you're gone and I'm alone to cry 
Oh yes it's true how I love you I never knew 

You left and you went away after saying never ever let me go oh 

Now it's over and you're gone and I'm alone to cry 
Oh yes it's true how I love you I never knew 

You left and you went away after saying never ever let me go oh 

Now it's over and you're gone and I'm alone to cry 
Oh yes it's true how I love you I never knew 
(I never never knew)
