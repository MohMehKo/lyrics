You fool you, that's what my friends all say 
You fool you, don't throw your love away 
You fool you, remember yesterday 
Your baby walked away, away, from you. 

So there you go, come running back again 
Stars in your eyes, be leading lights 
Your hungry heart still longs for love 
You think she'll win, and so you pretend 

You fool you, that's what my friends all say 
You fool you, don't throw your love away 
You fool you, remember yesterday 
Your baby walked away, away, from you. 

Ooh ooh ooh ooh, Ooh ooh ooh ooh, 
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, Ooh ooh ooh ooh, 
You fool you.
