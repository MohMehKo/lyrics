Baby, when we're walking by and we happen to meet another guy 
Don't give him the eye... that's a no no, no no no no, no no no no no 

Sugar, when another man wants you to understand 
Don't hold his hand... that's a no no, no no no, no no no 

No, don't be like some other girls, if you love me, come on let it show 
If you ever get tired of me, baby just let me know: no no no no, no no no no no 

Sweetheart, when it's party time and you're groovin', everything is fine 
Don't forget you're mine... that's a no no, no no no, no no no, no no 

Woman when the dance is through and the fella's wait around for you 
Dont kiss someone new...that's a no no, no no no, no no no, no no
