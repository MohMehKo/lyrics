You're the figure of a woman 
You're the mind of a child 
A pretty whirlwind 

You don't know just what you're doing 
When you love me with your smile 
A lovely whirlwind 

A whirlwind Of warm desire 
Whirlwind, Burning fire woman, realize 
That the devil in disguise, is a whirlwind 

Born to be running wild and free 
Whirlwind 

Born to make fools of guys like me 
You pick me up like a whirlwind 
You put me down like a whirlwind 
Each time you touch me I'm trouble-bound 
Whirl, whirl, whirlwind
Whirl, whirl, whirlwind 
Whirl, whirl, whirlwind
Whirl, whirl, whirlwind 
Whirlwind
