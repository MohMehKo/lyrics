When she was leaving, she didn't make much sense 
She said before I go, just give me one last kiss 
I'd tried to tell her 
That it would only add to the pain 
That's when those tears started to rain 
As I look back I see mistakes we made 
But I never thought, that we would lose our way 
I tried to hold her 
I tried to persuade her to wait 
But those leavin' tears are always too late 

I'd hate to try and count the tears that fall 
Maybe you should never count tears at all 
Something was lost and we never found it 
No matter how hard we tried 
And it seems that there's no way to get around it 
When tears tell you goodbye 
Tonight I saw her, I didn't know what to say 
I just tried to smile, but had to walk away 
I turned to tell her 'I love you' 
But she had faded into the rain 
Now those lonely tears are all that remain 
Now those lonely tears are startin' over again 
Lonely tears,lonely tears
