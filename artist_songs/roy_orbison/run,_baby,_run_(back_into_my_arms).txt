Run,run baby run
Run baby run, run baby run

Run baby run, run baby run
Run baby run, back into my arms
Run baby run, run baby run
Run baby run, back into my arms

Even though you hurt me
I still love you, it's true
Even though I know that you will hurt me again
I will love you as I did then

Run,run baby run, run baby run
Run baby run, back into my arms
Run,run baby run, run baby run
Run baby run, back into my arms

I'm not the kind of guy
To ever hurt you or let you down
So if that guy you're seeing ever makes you cry
Leave him, tell him goodbye

Run,run baby run, run baby run
Run baby run, back into my arms
Run,run baby run, run baby run
Run baby run, run baby run...
