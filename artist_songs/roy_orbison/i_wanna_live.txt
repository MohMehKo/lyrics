Flowers have blooms, the oceans have waves. 
The sky has the clouds, people have babes 
I wanna live, 'till I get old 
I wanna watch all of this grow. 

I wanna live, live and let live. 
I wan't the love this life has to give. 
I wanna smile and be friendly with you. 
I wanna live and let you live some too 

Rover is big, Teddy is small. 
Betty is short, Jimmy is tall. 
They wanna live, live and let live. 
They want all the love this life has to give. 
They wanna smile be friendly with you. 
They wanna live that you live too.
