I looked behind a silver cloud, I found a pretty rainbow there 
I walked out to the rainbow's end and found a rainbow love 
The one that I was looking for, the dream that I was dreaming of 
There, down at the rainbow's end I found a rainbow love 

I found my pot of gold, my rainbow love 
Just you and all your loving, charming rainbow love 
I searched, hoped someday I'd find someone to bring me peace of mind 
I found what I've been dreaming of when I found my rainbow love
