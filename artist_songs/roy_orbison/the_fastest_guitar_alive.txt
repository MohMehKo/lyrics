Hey here I go a lucky so and so 
Happy 'cos I know I've got my fast guitar 
Singing pretty songs, knowing I belong 
I am first and last, and always a fast guitar 

The fastest guitar alive 
Rattling strings like a gattling gun 
Shaped like a lovely woman 
Stay right where you are 
My guitar is a fast guitar 
The fastest guitar alive 

I'm rolling on like a rolling stone 
gathering no moss, I play a boss guitar 

The fastest guitar alive 
Strumming like a battling soldier's drum 
Shaped like a lovely woman 
Stay right where you are 
My guitar is a fast guitar 
The fastest guitar alive 

Hey here I go a lucky so and so 
Happy 'cos I know I've got my fast guitar 
The fastest guitar 
The fastest guitar 
The fastest guitar alive
