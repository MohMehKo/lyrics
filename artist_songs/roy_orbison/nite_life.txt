When shadows fall, the day is done 
The mountain tops hide the setting sun 
The magic of the night is here, for all young lovers far and near 

Nite life, ooh la la la, stars coming out to play 
Nite life, rah rah rah rah 
See how they light the milky way 
At the end of day, mmm nite life 

Nite life, aye aye aye aye look at the moon above 
Nite life, ma ma ma ma, it's time to fall in love 
Yeah, so come on, mmm nite life 

Nite life, no need to be blue 
The moon and the stars are belong to you 
Nite life is so much fun when you're in love, and love is young 

Nite life tra la la la, laughing and painting the town 
Nite life, ha ha ha ha, it's just a merry go round 
When the sun goes down, mmm nite life
