I left Nabraska lookin' at sundown, needin' a shave and a bath 
Wyoming night time could be a comedown, where do I go for a relapse? 
Cheyenne, Cheyenne 

Goofin' with the bar fly.pretty little green eyes sure can throw a smile 
Head's in the right place, baby's got a sweet face, falls down western style 

Cheyenne, Cheyenne get me high an' keep me that way 
Cheyenne, Cheyenne still try an' steal my heart away 
Cheyenne, Cheyenne 

Annie is a cowgirl, a here and now girl, she says she can make me her man 
She showed me how, I said "oh wow" I'll come again when I can 

To Cheyenne, Cheyenne get me high an' steal my heart away 
Cheyenne, Cheyenne stop your cryin', cos I'm here to stay 

Cheyenne, Cheyenne, Cheyenne, Cheyenne, Cheyenne, 
Cheyenne, Cheyenne, Cheyenne, Cheyenne, Cheyenne...
