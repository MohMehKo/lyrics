Smile an everlasting smile 
A smile can bring you near to me 
Don't ever let me find you gone 
'Cause that could bring a tear to me 
This words have lost their glory, 
Let's start a brand new story, now my love 
Right now there'll be no other time 
And I can show you all my love 

Talk in everlasting words 
And dedicate them all to me 
I will give you all my life 
It's here if you should call to me 

You think that I don't even mean 
A single word I say 
It's only words and words are all I have 
To take your heart away
