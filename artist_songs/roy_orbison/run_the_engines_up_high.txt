Standing in this airport waiting all alone 
Listening to the falling raindrops playing a lonely song 
I didn't want to leave that girl, but I couldn't stay 
But when the feeling's gone, you know it's gotta end just this way 

Run the engines up high, get her ready to fly 
Take me up and away, gonna find some better days 
Run the engines up high, get her ready to fly 
Leaving yesterday's sorrow, gonna chase tomorrow 

When I step up on board this plane, I'll never look behind 
I'll close my eyes and let the whining engines ease my mind 
I may get off in Dallas, or go on to L.A. 
But anyway, I've got some time to think a while along the way 

Run the engines up high, get her ready to fly 
Leaving yesterday's sorrow, I'm gonna chase tomorrow 
Run the engines up high, get her ready to fly 
Take me up and away I'm gonna find some better days...
