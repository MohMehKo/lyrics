Well you can act like a monkey, shake your hands do the limbo till you can't stand, 
Well you can mash your potata, hippy hippy shake, but the beats' still wild and your feet still ache 
I say it's just another name for rock and roll everybody, everybody sing 
It's just another name for rock and roll, rock and roll 

Well you can do the duck, walk your dog down the street, loop the loop to a swingin beat, 
You can twist and shout and do the stomp, a chase a chicken on a pony romp ah but 
It's just another name for rock and roll everybody, everybody sing, 
It's just another name for rock and roll, rock and roll 

Well they all try to shake it another way, but they rock, they roll just the same 

They only call it by another name and I don't care what they say, woah,oh,oh 

Down in the jungle where the tree tops are steep, they get the fever for a bongo beat, 
They do the ubangie stomp, the safari hop, do the monkey until they drop 

Ah but it's just another name for rock and roll everybody, everybody sing 
It's just another name for rock and roll, everybody, everybody sing 
It's just another name for rock and roll everybody, everybody sing.......
