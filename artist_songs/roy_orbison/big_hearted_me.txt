Big hearted me,big hearted me 
big hearted me 
I had to give my love away 
I give it to a girl 
that broke it in two like it was clay 
I should have known better 
I should have never let her 
But I couldn't break free 
I gave her all my love so generously 
big hearted me 

Big hearted me,big hearted me 
I bought her everything 
A mink and a ring 
A home so fine 
I thought she loved me so 
There never was a doubt that she was mine 
Until one day I opened my eyes and plain as could be 
My love was all gone 
She left me all alone 
Big hearted me 

Big hearted me 
big hearted me 
Big hearted me
