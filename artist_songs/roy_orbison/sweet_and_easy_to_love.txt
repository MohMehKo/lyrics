Well it's so sweet and easy to love you 
Like I do yes it's true I love you 
And it's so sweet and easy to want you 
On my mind all the time say you're mine 

I want you to say you'll always stay and be my love so true 
Because I know if you ever go I won't get over you 
Cause it's so sweet and easy to love you 
Like I do yes it's true I love you 

Well it's so sweet and easy to love you 
Like I do yes it's true I love you 
And it's so sweet and easy to hold you 
Close to me, lovingly, tenderly 

Now I will never love another I want only you 
I want to say in every way that you're my dream come true 
Cause it's so sweet and easy to love you 
Like I do yes it's true I love you 
I love you, I love you
