Our summersong lingers on in my memory 
Since you've been gone from me 
Summer's come again, and again I'm alone 
Wish you were near when I hear our summersong 

Our summersong lives on and on and on 
Inside of me, and it will, yes 
Until you return to me 

Oh, when the leaves fall away from the trees 
I'll still be blue all winter long 
And I'll sing our summersong and dream of you 
I'll sing our summersong and dream of you
