Love Star, oh star of love have you forgotten me?
I'm so lonely for someone to love
Love Star, so high above look down so you may see
Someone for me like I'm dreaming of

You see because my heart is shy
Somehow love has passed me by
And noone knows how much I cry
When I'm all alone for a love of my own

Love Star, they say for every heart a love star shines
So please, please shine for mine and let me find my love.
