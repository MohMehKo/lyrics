He calls you from the office and he tells you that he's sorry 
But it looks like he'll be working late again and he asks you how your day went 
But he didn't say he missed you and he'd rather be home with you and the kids 
Then suddenly the day has lost it's meaning and you find it hard to hold the tears inside 
And the tears begin to fall, and another day's gone by 
As you dry the tears from your eyes, just another reason why a woman cries 

You ask him if he'd call you when he's working late again 
But it's nine o'clock and still he hasn't called and the dinner fixed with special care 
Is getting cold, and he's not there - you wonder if he really cares at all 
Another lonely night and he's not with you and you find it hard to hold the tears inside 

And the tears begin to fall, and another day's gone by 
As you dry the tears from your eyes, just another reason why a woman cries 

Now you push aside the curtains and you're looking out the window 
And the kids are playing with him in the yard, he takes you out occasionally 
And once more you're a family and he thought about your birthday after all 
It's then you know the reason why you love him and he'll never know the joy you feel inside 
And all the tears you've cried, just a part of a woman's life, when a woman's happy inside 
It's another reason why a woman cries, just another reason why a woman cries
