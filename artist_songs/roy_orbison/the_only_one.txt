Everyone you know's been through it 
You bite the bullet, then you chew it 
Tie a knot at the end of your rope 
Buy a book to help you cope 
But no consolation gonna come 
You're the only one 

Take a look at history 
Recant some bits of poetry 
You'll find the words still ring true 
Some things don't change 
Some things do 

And you're the only one with a broken heart 
The only one who's afraid of the dark 
The only one in a crowded room 
The only one who sees the blue moon 

What you wouldn't give right now 
To be another face in the crowd 

And you're the only one who is all alone 
The only one whose love is gone 
The only one who has given in 
The only one who will give again 

And you're the only one with a broken heart 
The only one who's afraid of the dark 
The only one in a crowded room 
The only one who sees the blue moon
