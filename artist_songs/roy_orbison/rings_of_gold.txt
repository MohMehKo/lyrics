I remember when you said 
"With this ring I thee wed" 
Now you've gone betrayed my trust 
Rings of gold have turned to rust 

Tears can't wash away the sin 
Love that's dead can't live again 
Knowing there's no hope for us 
Turns those rings of gold to rust 

Plans we made just yesterday 
Sands of time have chipped away 
Now they've crumbled into dust 

Love before was clean and pure 
Never more can I be sure 
You will not betray my trust 
Rings of gold have turned to rust 
Rings of gold have turned to rust
