[Roy:] I was all right for a while 
I could smile for a while 
[KD:] THEN I saw you last night 
You held my hand so tight 
WHEN you stopped to say hello 
[Roy:] You wished me well 
You couldn't tell that 
I've been crying over you, 
crying over you 
And you said "So long" 
Left me standing all alone, alone and crying, crying, crying, crying 
It's hard to understand 
But the touch of your hand can start me crying 

I thought that I was over you But it's true, so true 
I love you even more than I did before 
But darling, what can I do? 
For you don't love me 
And I'll always be crying over you, crying over you 

[Roy:] Yes now you're gone 
[Both:] And from this moment on, I'll be crying, crying, crying, crying 
Yeah, crying, crying over you
