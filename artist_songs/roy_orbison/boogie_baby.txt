How do you expect me, honey 
To stand here so nonchalant 
When the way you move your body 
It's telling me what you are 

You're a boogie baby, ain't no maybe 
And you're driving me crazy, ooh tonight 

It's just not fair, no 
That look in your eyes when you smile 
You're a liberated woman 
But you still know how to use your feminine wiles 

You're a boogie baby, ain't no maybe 
And you're driving me crazy. ooh tonight 

Woman, you are already a star 
And what you're doing is tearing me apart 
You'd better find yourself another man 
If you're not out to tease 
Cos this here man is looking to please 

Lights flickering 'cross the floor 
Making my light head spin 
Or is it just you. you sexy lady 
Winkin' my way again 

You're a boogie baby, ain't no maybe 
And you're driving me crazy, ooh tonight 

Woman, you are already a star 
And what you're doing is tearing me apart 
You'd better find yourself another man 
If you're not out to tease 
Cos this here man is looking to please
