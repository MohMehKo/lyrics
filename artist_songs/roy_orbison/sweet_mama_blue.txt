I know a place in New Orleans, 
They call The Castle of Kings and Queens. 
Where an old sweet black woman sings
And plays piano like a dream. 
She puts out all her beautiful heart and soul for you. 
Sweet mamma blue. 

Sweet mamma blue will only sing about the truth. 
And it will get to you. 
Sweet mamma blue will sing of love as only she can do. 
Sweet mamma blue.
Sweet Mamma Blue 

One night I stayed past closing time. 
"Sweet mamma blue my troubled mind." 
She sang the night away for me. 
She made me see what I couldn't see. 
That only by loving life will all your dreams come true. 
Sweet mamma blue. 

Sweet mamma blue will only sing about the truth. 
And it will get to you. 
Sweet mamma blue will sing of love as only she can do. 
Sweet mamma blue.
Sweet mamma blue. 

They say she's gone from misery. 
But she still lives in my memory. 
I still can see her smile and say 
"I'll bet you make it all the way." 
If you will try the Lord will surely see you through 

Sweet mamma blue, 
The world sure will miss you. 
And when I feel blue I think of you. 
Sweet mamma blue.
Sweet mamma blue. 
Sweet mamma blue...
