All too soon we were blown upon our seperate ways again 
And our warm summer dreams 
Joined the fallen leaves that tumbled in the wind 
With the echoes and traces of voices and faces 
And places that I've left behind 

But there's times in the morning 
And there's times at the close of day 
When your memory comes easy as smiling 
And that's something they can't take away 

I may die without ever knowing happiness again 
Leaving nothing behind but a line of lonely footprints in the sand 
But I know that wherever I go, I will never trade anything I'll ever find 

For the times in the morning and the times at the close of day 
When your memory comes easy as smiling, and that's something they can't take away 
When your memory comes easy as smiling, and that's something they can't take away
