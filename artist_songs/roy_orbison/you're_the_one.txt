You give me the feeling of ascending. 
Touching down and lifting off on feeling. 
Rising through the thunder and the lightning. 
Til I kmow the wonder so exciting. 
The world below us doesn't know us. 
Still they try to follow where we run. 
Between you and me. 
Ooh, you're the one. 
You, kissing my breath away. 
You, sharing our yesterdays. 
You tomorrow. 
Lead I'll follow. 
When I hold you, I am undone. 
You're the one. 
You're the one. 
Riding trough the heaven of sensation 
Taken in your sunshine, sweet vibration. 
Holding nothing back, you're my elation. 
Trough the night my sighless fascination. 
You hold me in and out of dreams. 
Awake, asleep and loving leaves me stunned. 
Between you and me. 
Ooh you're the one. 
You, kissing my breath away. 
You, sharing our yesterdays. 
You tomorrow. 
Lead I'll follow. 
When I hold you, I am undone. 
You're the one. 
You're the one. 
You're the one. 
You're the one.
