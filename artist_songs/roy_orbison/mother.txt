The eagle perched on the flying pole
He arched around the wire
This isn't what we intended for you
Wake up, no don't lie

Mother what have we done to you,
Mother can we make it up to you,
Mother what can we do to start anew

Hear now what I am saying
If just for your own sake
To balance out your portion
You must put back what you take

Mother what have we done to you,
Mother Can we make it up to you, mother
What Can we do to start anew

And why can't it be Like it's been to mother
For each other to live We just all have to give

Mother what have we done to you,
Mother can we make it up to you, mother
What can we do to start anew
