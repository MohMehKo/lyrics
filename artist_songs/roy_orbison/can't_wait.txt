Can't wait till we get back together 
Can't wait, the sooner the better 
It's late, I should have told you long ago 

I hope that we can set things straight 
What I've got in my heart won't wait 
Tomorrow may be too late to apologise to you 

Ooh I wish that it was tonight 
With our troubles behind us, tonight 
Go where no one can find us tonight 
With no city to blind us tonight 

As I sit here and say "oh gee" 
As the feeling just sweeps over me 
Takes me into the night floating free 

In a skyward direction 
My soul has been freed by your love and affection 

Can't wait till we get back together 
Can't wait, the sooner the better 
It's late, and I still can't taste your kiss 

And you know that a love like this 
It just can't wait 

It can't wait, no no no 
It can't wait, no no no 
It can't wait, no no no 
It can't wait, no no no...
