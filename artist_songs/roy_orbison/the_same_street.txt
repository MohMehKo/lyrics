I still live on the same street, that we lived on. 
The same old street, where memories were made on. 

I shouldn't stay, why don't I go?
Each day hurts a little more. 

It won't be the same street anymore, since you've gone. 
It won't be the same street anymore. 

Each day I walk alone, where we once walked before. 
See all familiar places, where we talked before. 

But I can't run from memories. 
They're mine and they belong to me. 

It won't be the same street anymore since you've gone. 
It won't be the same street anymore.
