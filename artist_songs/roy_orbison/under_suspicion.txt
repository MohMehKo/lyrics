Well I've been mistreated 
Lied to and cheated 
Misled and abused 
Like an old rag you threw away 

First you fill me with thunder 
Then you let me go under 
You can run, you can hide 
But you ain't gonna get away 

Cos you're under suspicion 
Of leavin' the scene of a broken heart 
Under suspicion of a hit and run love affair 

Well you ain't got a conscience 
And you've made me the victim 
Of a cruel and unusual crime 
Now you're under suspicion, under suspicion 
Under suspicion of a hit and run love affair 

No matter where you'll be going 
I got ways of knowing 
Somewhere down the line 
You're gonna pay 

Cos you're under suspicion 
Of leavin' the scene of a broken heart 
Under suspicion of a hit and run love affair 

Well you ain't got a conscience 
And you've made me the victim 
Of a cruel and unusual crime 
Now you're under suspicion, under suspicion 
Under suspicion of a hit and run love affair 

Under suspicion, under suspicion 
Under suspicion, under suspicion...
