For a while I can sing 
All the world and everything is touching you 
Knowing you are real a miracle beside me 

For a while I can breathe 
Life is you, and I can cling to fantasies 
Seeing me with you keeps my soul alive now 

Tomorrow, if I die 
At least I'll know why I live 
You're mine, if only for a while 

For a while, for a while 
You hold my world and you can spin it 
For a while, for a while 
Life is good because you're in it 

Tomorrow, if I die 
At least I'll know why I live 
You're mine, you are mine, if only for a while
