You make my warm spot hot 
You make my bells ring-too ding-ding 
You make my warm spot hot 
And the things I need a lot you got 

Woah my little baby 
You know you drive me crazy 
You make me feel so good I say wow, yeah 

This has got to be the only way for me 
There ain't nothing going to stop me now 
You say your daddy don't like me much 
That's 'cause he knows I got that touch 
And there's some things of yours he knows 
I been touching too much 

But you make my worm spot hot 
You make my bells ring too, ring-ding ding-a-ling 
You make my warm spot hot 
The things I need a lot you got 

You've got me turning flips 
When you kiss me in the lips 
You turn the spark right into a fire 
And the flame just won't go out 
'Cause there can't be any doubt 


This love of yours is what I desire 
The preacher said I ain't no saint 
Well he's right, that's one thing that I ain't 
But I pray that me and you 
Can do the things we do all night long 

'Cause you make my worm spot hot 
You make my bell ring too, brrrrrring ding-ding 
You make my warm spot hot, baby 
The things I need a lot you got come-on and burn me now 

Well I'm letting all the people see 
That what they say don't bother me 
'Cause you're the one I'm thinking of 
When I get down ready to love 

You make my worm spot hot 
You make my bells rings too, ding-ding 
You make my warm spot hot 
And the things I need a lot you got 

You make my warm spot hot 
You make my bells ring too, brrrrrring ding 
You make my warm spot hot 
You make my bells ring too, ding ding ding a-ling
