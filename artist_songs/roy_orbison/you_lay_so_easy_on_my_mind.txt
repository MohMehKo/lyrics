You lay so easy on my mind oh so easy on my mind 
Whenever I need you, all I ever do is close my eyes 
You lay so easy on my mind yes, so easy on my mind 
Wrap me in your warmness, let me feel your body touching mine 

Everything you say and do finds me wanting you 
Each moment brings to light a million dreams 
Having something real is something I can feel 
When I feel you, angel, touching me 

You lay so easy on my mind oh so easy on my mind 
There's not a part of me your sweet love won't reach to satisfy 

Everyday I love you more, you're the one I'm living for 
And the best you'll ever give you've given me 
You completely satisfy every need inside 
I pray you'll never take your love from me 

You lay so easy on my mind oh so easy on my mind 
There's not a part of me, your sweet love wont reach to satisfy 
You lay so easy on my mind
