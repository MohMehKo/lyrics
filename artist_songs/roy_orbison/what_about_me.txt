You're happy now yes it's plain to see 
You're not concerned with your old used-to-be 
You've got no heartaches or misery 
You're happy I see, what about me? 

You pass me by with your head up high 
You've no regrets since we said goodbye 
You could at least show some sympathy 
You're happy I see, what about me? 
What about me? What about me? 

I live with the promises you didn't keep. 
What about me? What about me? 
Those sweet words you said were just words to deceive. 

One day you'll find your love untrue 
You'll feel the same way I feel about you 
You could at least show some sympathy 
You're happy I see, what about me?
