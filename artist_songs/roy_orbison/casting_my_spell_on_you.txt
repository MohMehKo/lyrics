I took a black cat, (a cave bat) threw 'em in a pot pot, pot pot pot pot 
I took a green snake, (a blue snake), tied 'em in a knot knot, knot knot knot knot 
I took the dog's paw, (a calve's jaw) hung 'em on the line line, line line line line 
I took a horse hair, (a green bear) made a crazy sign sign, sign sign sign sign 

I'm casting my spell on you, casting my spell on you, casting my spell on you 
You'll never never be untrue, yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah 

I took a ghost too, an old shoe, put 'em in the ground ground, ground ground ground ground 
I took and old dish, a dried fish, made a crazy sound sound, sound sound sound sound 

I took in a goose egg, a frog leg, put 'em in a sack sack, sack sack sack sack 
I got a Hindu, (a tattoo) a genie on my back back, back back back back 

I'm casting my spell on you, casting my spell on you, casting my spell on you 
You'll never never be untrue, yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
