The sun on the rim of the hill overlooking all that I love 
Lights up every leaf and blade, birds circling high above 
With trembling hand I reach down and say "This is my land" 

This land will pass on to my child, when he's grown 
To love it as much as I, for all the sons gone by 
And when he's a man he'll do what he can 
For this my land, this is my land 

When young men die in glory and for freedom take their stand 
May they sing this same proud story, this is my land 

When life fades away, and my body is laid to rest in the ground 
May this comfort fill my soul here on the land, I know 
That those after me say with much dignity 
"This is my land, this is my land"
