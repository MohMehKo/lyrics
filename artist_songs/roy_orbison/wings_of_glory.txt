I could ride on wings of glory 
To a mountain in the sky 
With fantasies and dreams of love 
Too beautiful to die 

And step into the door 
That time will never close 
With promises of all desire 
And love no other knows 
No other knows 

When am I gonna stop reaching for a rainbow? 
You know I always wanted to fly 
Could I reach the top, even with the moonglow 
Blinding both of my eyes? 

Some resist the urge 
While tempted all the more 
All can feel their weakness 
Should they walk in the door 

As we ride on wings of glory 
Together we sill fly 
To live our dreams and fantasies 
To music in the sky 
In the sky 

When am I gonna stop reaching for a rainbow? 
You know I always wanted to fly 
Could I reach the top, even with the moonglow 
Blinding both of my eyes?
