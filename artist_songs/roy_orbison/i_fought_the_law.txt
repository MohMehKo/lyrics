I'm breakin' rocks in the hot sun, I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won, I needed money 'cos I had none
I fought the law and the law won, I fought the law and the law won
I left my baby and I feel so bad, I guess my race is run
She's the best girl I ever had, I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won, I was robbing people with a six gun
I fought the law and the law won, I fought the law and the law won
I miss my baby and good fun, I Fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won, I left my baby and I feel so bad
I guess my race is run, She's the best girl I ever had
I fought the law and the law won, I fought the law and the law won
