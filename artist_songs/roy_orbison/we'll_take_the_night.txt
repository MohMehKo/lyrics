Baby it's hard sometimes to wake and face this life everyday. 
Sometimes it's bad enough to stop and through the good all away. 
Tonight let's put the world aside and let go together. 
The night is one place we can hide in each others arms. 
Dream on forever. 

Come on baby, and we'll take the night. 
While the stars are willing and the moon is right. 
Dreams are shining in a magic light. 
Come with me, oh we'll take the night. 
You and me, oh we'll take the night. 
Baby, we'll take the night. 

Look up and let the night unfold. 
Hold on to the feeling. 
Reach out and let it touch your soul. 
And give in to love, love is believing. 

Come on baby, and we'll take the night. 
While the stars are willing and the moon is right. 
Dreams are shining in a magic light. 
Come with me, oh we'll take the night. 
You and me, oh we'll take the night. 

If everystar should fall. 
And tomorrow lose all meaning. 
We would still have had it all. 
It's locked away inside our hearts. 
There for the dreaming. 

Come on baby, and we'll tale the night. 
While the stars are willing and the moon is bright. 
Dreams are shining in the magic light. 
Come with me, oh we'll take the night. 
You and me, oh we'll take the night. 

Come on baby, and we'll take the night. 
While the stars are willing and the moon is bright. 
Dream are shining in a magic light. 
Come with me, oh we'll take the night. 
You and me, yeah we'll take the night.
