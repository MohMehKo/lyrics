They say we're searching for love we'll never find 
They say we're foolish kids we're two of a kind. 

We know we've found our love when your lips meet mine 
That's when we know they're right we're two of a kind. 

No matter what they say when it's all said and done 
When we are old enough we two will be one. 

And when they pass me by with your hand in mine 
Then they'll just smile and say they're two of a kind. 

No matter what they say when it's all said and done 
When we are old enough we two will be one. 

And when they pass me by with your hand in mine 
Then they'll just smile and say they're two of a kind.
