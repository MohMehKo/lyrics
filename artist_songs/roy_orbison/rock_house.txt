Blue light, big crowd 
Jukebox plays loud 
No fear, no care 
Everybody's rockin' everywhere 
Rock house, rock house, rock house 
We're goin' to the rock house 
Well rock it in the mornin' 
Rock it in daylight 
Rockin' through the evening 
And I won't be home at night 
Rock house, we're goin' to the rock house 
Rock-a-rock house 

Heartache, you lose 
No trouble, no booze 
Come one, come all 
Well rock it up and have a ball 
Rock house, rock house, rock house 
We're goin' to the rock house
