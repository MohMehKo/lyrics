I love you I do. 
I love you truly truly true. 
Truly true. 
If the world should end today, I could say. 
At least I've had my day with you. 
Truly true. 
Truly baby, I love you 
Truly, truly, truly true. 

And for some the world may end. 
But for us it will begin again and again. 
Truly true, I love you I do. 
I love you truly truly true. 
Truly true.
