I peeped in to say good night 
When I heard my child in prayer 
"Send for me, some scarlet ribbons 
Scarlet ribbons for my hair" 

All the stores were closed and shuttered 
All the streets were dark and bare 
In my town no scarlet ribbons 
Scarlet ribbons for her hair 

Through the night my heart was aching 
Just before the dawn was breaking 
I peeped in and on her bed 
In gay profusion lying there 
I saw ribbons, scarlet ribbons 
Scarlet ribbons for her hair 

If I live to be a hundred 
I will never know from where 
Came those lovely scarlet ribbons 
Scarlet ribbons for her hair
