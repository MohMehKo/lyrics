Sugar and honey, is what I cry for 
Sugar and honey, is what I'd die for 
And darlin' doll you make my life worthwhile 
Because I want you Sugar and honey. 

Sugar and honey, keep me goin 
Sugar and honey, I been a-knowin' 
Well everytime your lovin' lips meet mine 
You know I want you Sugar and honey. 
A little bit-a sugar, a whole lotta honey 
It's alright Sugar and honey mornin' noon and night 
Give me sugar and honey anytime.

Sugar and honey, for the flavor 
Every little bitty thing you do 
Just makes me love you, Sugar and honey.

It's alright Sugar and honey, mornin' noon and night 
Yeah sugar and honey anytime, ah sugar and honey all the time
