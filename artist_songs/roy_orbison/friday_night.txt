Well I was driving in my car 
With fourteen women after me 
Down Fifth Avenue 
A friday night it just to be 
She was standing on the corner 
Thumbing a ride 
I said: "Hop in baby 
Scoot closer by my side" 
Honey let's go riding you look so exciting 
Where have you been hiding? 

[Chorus:]
Friday night, feeling tight 
Friday night, think she might 
Friday night, friday night 
There's no telling what you'll find 
Cruising on a friday night 

She didn't say a word 
She just kept those big blue eyes on me 
I wondered what she could be thinkin' 
As she put her little hand on my knee 
I took another sip of malted brew 
And then I looked in her eyes 
And as I sank into her baby blues 
I thought "My oh my" 
There's no use in fighting you look so exciting 
Where have you been hiding girl? 

[Chorus]

Cruising on a friday night 
Cruising on a friday night 
Cruising on a friday night
