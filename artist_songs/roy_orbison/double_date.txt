Me and my buddy went on a double date 
I was feeling great, I could hardly wait 
I got my lovin' baby and introduced my friend 
He fell for her, she fell for him 
On a double date, on a double date 

Now my baby's gone, I'm all alone 
All because of a double date, of a double date 

Then my one time buddy went on a double date 
He was feeling great, he couldn't hardly wait 
He got my loving baby and introduced his friend 
Ha ha, and then that was the end 
On a double date, on a double date 

Now my baby's gone, I'm all alone 
All because of a double date, of a double date 
Of a double date, of a double date...
