When love's light slowly starts to fade. 
On dreams and promises we made. 
What can we do to right this wrong. 
After the love,after the love has gone. 

When did our love began to die. 
It seems too late to wonder why. 
This feeling seems so strong. 
After the love, after the love has gone. 

After the love has gone. 
How can we still be friends. 
How can we carry on. 
After the love,after the love has gone. 

And now it's time to say goodbye. 
Just walk away, try not to cry. 
We'll love again before too long. 
After the love, after the love has gone. 

After the love has gone. 
After it finally ends. 
There'll be no sweet love songs. 
After the love, after the love has gone. 
How can we still be friends. 
How can we carry on. 
After the love, after th elove has gone
