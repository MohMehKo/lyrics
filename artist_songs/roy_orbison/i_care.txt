I don't believe you when you say there's nothing wrong 
And you can't hide the tears in your eyes from me 
Don't you know we've been together much too long 
Please don't hide it,oh baby can't you see 

[Chorus:]
That I care, yes I care, and I swear I do, oh I do, oh I do 
I really do love you, oh I care, yes I care, and I swear I do 
Oh I do, yes I do, I really do want you 

Would it matter if I told you I was sorry 
For all the little things I didn't do for you 

And if you ever left me girl don't you know I'd worry 
You know all i ever wanted was you 

And I care, yes I care, and I swear I do, and I do, oh I do 
I really do love you, oh I care, yes I care, and I swear I do 
Oh I do, Yes I do, I really do want you 

Oh I want you to want me too 
Just to love me just to love me 

[Chorus]
