I woke up with the power out
Not really something to shout about
Ice has covered up my parents hands
Don't have any dreams, don't have any plans

I went out into the night
I went out to find some light
Kids are swingin' from the power lines
Nobody's home, so nobody minds 

I woke up on the darkest night
Neighbors all were shoutin' that they found the light 
"We found the light!"
Shadows jumpin' all over my walls
Some of them big, some of them small

I went out into the night 
I went out to pick a fight with anyone
Light a candle for the kids
Jesus Christ don't keep it hid! 

Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

Ice has covered up my parents hands
Don't have any dreams, don't have any plans
Growin' up in some strange storm
Nobody's cold, nobody's warm

I went out into the night
I went out to find some light
Kids are dyin' out in the snow, 
Look at them go, look at them go! 

Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

And the power's out 
In the heart of man
Take it from your heart 
Put it in your hand

What's the plan? What's the plan? 

Is it a dream? Is it a lie? 
I think I'll let you decide
Just light a candle for the kids
Jesus Christ don't keep it hid! 

'Cause nothing's hid
From us kids
You ain't foolin' nobody 
With the lights out!

Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

And the power's out
In the heart of man
Take it from your heart 
Put it in your hand

And there's something wrong 
In the heart of man
Take it from your heart
Put it in your hand

Where'd you go?!
