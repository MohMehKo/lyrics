Every inch of sky's got a star
Every inch of skin's got a scar
I guess we've got everything now

Every inch of space in your head
Is filled up with the things that you read
I guess you've got everything now

Everything you've ever seen
Fills the spaces up in your dreams
You've got everything now

(Everything now)
(Everything now)

Every inch of road's got a sign
And every boy uses the same line
You've just done everything now

Every song that I've ever head
Is playing at the same time, it's absurd
It reminds me, we've got everything now

Turn the speakers up till they break
Cos every time you smile it's a fake!
Stop pretending, you've got...

Everything now! (I need it)
Everything now! (I want it)
Everything now! (Can't live without it)
Everything now!
Everything now!
Everything now!

Every inch of earth's got a town
Daddy, how come you never come round?
I miss you, like everything now

We won't need the food in your stove
Leave your car in the middle of the road
Just help your family with everything now

Turn the speakers up till they break
Cos every time you smile it's a fake!
Stop pretending, you've got...

Everything now! (I need it)
Everything now! (I want it)
Everything now! (I can't live without it)
Everything now!
Everything now!
Everything now!

Everything now! (I need it)
Everything now! (I want it)
Everything now! (I can't live without it)
Everything now!

La La La La La La La
La La La La La La La

Everything now! (I need it)
Everything now! (I want it)
Everything now! (I can't live without it)
Everything now!
Everything now!
Everything now!

Can we get back again
Can we get back again
From everything now
