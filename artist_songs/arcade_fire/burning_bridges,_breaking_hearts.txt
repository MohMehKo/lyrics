Burning bridges, breaking hearts
Everything you taught us to do
We're burning bridges, and breaking hearts
No home to come home to
We're burning bridges, and breaking hearts
I won't look you in the eye
And burning bridges, breaking hearts
Caught you in a friendship lie

Took a visit, to your old house
The windows were all boarded up
Try to hold these, memories
The ocean in a paper cup
There's no future in this town
They barricade the buildings there
To the lion, you've been cast
Only bones are gonna last

There's a city, underground
There's a city made of glass
There's a city, underground
Hurry cause it's breaking fast

There's no future in this town
They barricade the buildings there
We're burning bridges and breaking hearts
No home to come home to

We're burning bridges
(and breaking hearts)
We're burning bridges
(and breaking hearts)
Burning bridges, breaking hearts
(breaking hearts)

Burning bridges, breaking hearts
Everything you taught us to do
We're burning bridges and breaking hearts
No home to come home to

We're burning bridges and breaking hearts
Everything you taught us to do
We're burning bridges and breaking hearts
No home to come home to
