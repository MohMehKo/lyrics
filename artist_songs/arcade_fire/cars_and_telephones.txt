I read the pages about me
In her autobiography
They were brief and to the point

Our flesh, while you are getting dressed
A memory that needs to be repressed
I'll just wait until it's over

Since you've gone away I never know just what to say
Since you've gone away I never know just what to say

Cause I like cars more than telephones
Your voice in my ear makes me feel so alone
Tonight I'm gonna drive, the silver moon is shining bright
Over the interstate, God saying hurry don't be late
Soon the sun will rise, that's when the romance dies
And I'm just tired of running around

I walked to get the mail today
I guess your letter never came
I'll just check again tomorrow

A flash while you are getting dressed
A memory that needs to be repressed
I'll just wait without saying a word

Since you've gone away I never know just what to say
Since you've gone away I never know just what to say

Cause I like cars more than telephones
Your voice in my ear makes me feel so alone
Tonight I'm gonna drive, the silver moon is shining bright
Over the interstate, God saying hurry don't be late
Soon the sun will rise, that's when the romance dies
And I'm just tired of running around

But fuck it, I love you even if, I'm gonna feel like shit
By the time I get to you, now the sky is turning blue

The stars they disappear one by one as the daylight nears
And yes you're in my head, but that doesn't make you here

And I've lost all my friends, but you're the one I miss the most
And now I'm almost there, yeah, I'm almost to the coast

And if I had any notion of how I'm gonna drive my car across
The Atlantic Ocean I'd be fucking set
