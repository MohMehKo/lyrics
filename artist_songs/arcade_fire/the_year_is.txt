I see the lightning almost every day
I've stopped pretending its a bird of prey

My little brother's got a strange disease
he gives a name to everything he sees

ABC, DO RE MI, KKK, NAACP
USA, DOA, NYC, RIP

We heard the thunder on your daddy's farm
your momma said it was a fire alarm
the neighbors heard it and they started to run
we were deciding what to name our son

Let's call that son of a bitch

ABC, DO RE MI, KKK, NAACP
USA, DOA, NYC, RIP

The years is...
(shout out any year that comes into your head, its all the dark)
