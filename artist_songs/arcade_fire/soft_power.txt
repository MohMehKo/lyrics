Soft power got them so upset.
They think it's over.
But it's not done yet.

Soft power in the underground
Gonna let the wind
Blow the shit all around.

Well,
Soft power gets into our brains
Soft power now it's never going to be the same
All your voices in the streets tonight
Soft power
It's alright

All your power makes the world go round
You can cut the speakers
You can cut all the sounds.
But can you hear us
Singing our song?
Soft power
Now it's coming on strong

Soft power gets into our brains
Soft power now it's never going to be the same
All your voices in the streets tonight
Soft power
It's alright

Soft power
Look at them go
Soft power
They're about to explode
Soft power
In the Underworld
Soft power
Every boy and girl

We were born
So it's our right
You can cut all the power
You can cut all the lights
But we can see you even in the dark
Your words are fire
And we are the spark

Well
Soft power gets into our brains
Soft power now it's never, ever going to be the same
All your voices in the streets tonight
Soft power
It's not alright

Soft power
Look at them go
Soft power
They're about to explode
Soft power
In the Underworld
Soft power
Every boy and girl

Call a doctor
when it's not alright

Call a doctor
Cause it's not alright

Call a doctor
It's not alright

Call a doctor
Cause it's not alright

Well.

We'd love to help you
But we're not home.

It's impossible now.
