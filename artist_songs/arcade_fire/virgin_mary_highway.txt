I lay on my back in the lake at night in the summer time trying to remember
Every last second, every last breath that I spent with you
The yellow dotted line, reflected in your eyes
You scream as the crickets fly in the open window
Please don't cry love

Come on babe, we both know that I'll stay
The Virgin Mary lives beside the highway
Let's go and see her
Let's ask her blessings today

We've both felt love before even if we deny it
That familiar feeling of believing that we'll die without it
But we never do, well not completely

Come on babe, we both know that I'll stay
The Virgin Mary lives beside the highway
Let's go and see her lets ask her blessings today

You know I'm adrift without you
Come on home, you know I still feel it
Yeah

You know I'm adrift without you
Come on home, you know I still feel it
Yeah
