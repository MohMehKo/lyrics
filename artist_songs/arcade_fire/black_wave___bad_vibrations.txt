We can reach the sea
They won't follow me
Shadows they fear the sun
We'll make it if we run!

Run from the memory
Je nage, mais les sons me suivent

Left my name with the border guards
A name that I don't need
Ce sera un long voyage
Sur les vagues de l'oubli

Run from the memory
Je nage, mais les sons me suivent

Stop now before it's too late
Been eating in the ghetto on a hundred dollar plate
Nothing lasts forever
That's the way it's gotta be
There's a great black wave in the middle of the sea
For me

Stop now before it's too late 
Been eating in the ghetto on a hundred dollar plate
Nothing lasts forever
That's the way it's gotta be 
There's a great black wave in the middle of the sea
For me
For you 
For me
It's always for you 

Stop now before it's too late
Been eating in the ghetto on a hundred dollar plate
Nothing lasts forever
That's the way it's gotta be
There's a great black wave in the middle of the sea
For me

Stop now before it's too late
Your lover was for hire
Have you noticed he's been late
Nothing lasts forever
That's the way it's gotta be
There's a great black wave in the middle of the sea
For me
For you
For me
It's always for you

The sound is not asleep, it's moving under my feet
The sound is not asleep, it's moving under my feet
The sound is not asleep, it's moving under my feet
The sound is not asleep, it's moving under my feet
