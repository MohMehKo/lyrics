Brazil, where hearts were entertaining June
We stood beneath an amber moon 
And softly whispered, "Someday soon"
We kissed and clung together

Then - tomorrow was another day
The morning found us miles away
With still a million things to say
And now, the twilight moves the skies above
Recalling thrills of our love
There's one thing I'm certain of
Return, I will, to old Brazil
