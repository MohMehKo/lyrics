Take the makeup off your eyes
I've got to see you, hear your sacred sighs
Before the break up, comes the silence
I'm talking to you. You say you're over it,
But I know

I thought I knew you. You thought you knew me
But now that you do, it's not so easy now
That I know

You can cry; I won't go. You can scream; I won't go
Every man that you know would have run at the word go
Little boys with their porno, oh, I know they hurt you so
They don't know what we know. Never know what we know

And all your makeup, just take it all off
I've got to find you before the line is lost
I know I hurt you, I won't deny it
When I reach for you, you say, "I'm over it."
But I know

You can cry; I won't go. You can scream; I won't go
Every man that you know would have run at the word go
Little boys with their porno, oh, I know they hurt you so
They don't know what I know. It's so little that we know
But the cup it overflows. Little boys with their porno
This is their world, where can we go?

Makes me feel like something's wrong with me
Makes me feel like something's wrong with me
Can you see me?

You can cry; I won't go. You can scream; I won't go
Little boys with their porno. Little boys with their porno
Makes me feel like something's wrong. It's the only world we know
Yeah, something's wrong. Little boys with their porno

And boys they learn some selfish shit until the girl won't put up with it
On and on and on we go. I just have to know. I'm not over it
I'm not over it

So love is real like a disease. 
Come on tell me please, 
I'm not over it
I'm not over it
