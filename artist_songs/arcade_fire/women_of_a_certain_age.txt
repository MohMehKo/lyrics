Women of a certain age
Made to feel they gotta change
Some of them change their faces
But they don't smile the same
Some of them take night courses
Some of them get divorces
As the world gets strange
It's time for a change

Go and let your men get strange markings
Go and let the world get strange
Never change

Women own the world tonight
'Cause all the boys, they just wanna fight
And women of the world are born
To all the boys little wars
Mother, sister, daughter
The boys, they just can't father
It's time to take the ranks
When it's away from the strange

Go and let your men get strange markings
Go and let the world get strange
But never change
Never change
Never change
