It's a shame about the roadblock
We're afraid that we'll get caught or stopped
Let's go right now, surf city eastern block
I'm in the trunk, my surfboard on top

The eighties ain't been kind to anyone
I just want to find myself some sun
It's 1984, I'm on the run
Goodbye Berlin, hello Autobahn

It's a shame about the roadblock
If they catch us we won't ever talk
Let's go right now, surf city eastern block
I'm in the trunk when the inspector knocks
