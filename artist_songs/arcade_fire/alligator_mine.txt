Run run run run run run run away
Run run run run run run run away from me from me

You breath like airs a tourist in your heart babe
When colder weather comes you'll just suffocate

You kiss like love's a tourist in your heart babe
When colder weather comes you just disappear from me
But I cant wait to have your sweet love again before you

Run run run run run run run away
Run run run run run run run away from me from me

You breath like airs a tourist in your heart babe
When colder weather comes you'll just suffocate

You kiss like love's a tourist in your heart babe
When colder weather comes you just disappear from me
But I cant wait to have your sweet love again

You're cold blooded, stealin' my sunlight
You're cold blooded alligator mine

You're cold blooded, stealin' my sunlight
You're cold blooded alligator mine

You run away again my
I wont stay alligator mine
