On the twelfth of January
You don't need what you can't carry
The blood will flow into the ocean
The voices breaking with the motion

Crucified
Then crucified again
Crucified
Then crucified again

In the night, they started singin'
They had no right to keep believin'
But down bellow, there's someone screamin'
A broken church, no bells a-ringin'

They crucified
Then crucified again
They crucified
Then crucified again

Crucified again
Crucified again

The preachers talk on television
Hand out the judgments of their religion
But when I heard those women singin'
They made a sound I couldn't believe in

Crucified
Then crucified again

He who strikes the blow forgets it
But he who bears the scar remembers
The fire is burnin' down to embers
The fire is burnin', but I can't remember

Crucified
Then crucified again
Crucified
Then crucified again

Crucified again
Crucified again
Crucified again, and again, and again

All you great and mighty nations
Who think you've payed for your high stations
The cities may be built in the sand
But ours were built by their fathers' hands

They crucified
Then crucified again
They crucified
Then crucified again

Crucified again
Crucified again
Crucified again, and again, and again

Till the crowd cries
Do it again
[Repeat]

Crucified again
Crucified again
