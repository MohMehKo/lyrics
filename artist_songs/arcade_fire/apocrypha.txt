I said I wanna be born
Born again
But not right now

Please don't take me there
But God said,
Son, it's time to go
But when you'll return 
I don't know just yet

But even stars they die when they get old
The precious ones that we used to hold
So if you gonna shoot you better hit your mark
Send that arrow,
Sent it through my heart
My heart

You said,
This time, I won't get turned away
This time, I won't get turned away
This time, I won't get turned away

You said

Well, Joan of Arc
I walk in the dark
She said,
I've seen how the world ends
First they love you
Then they kill you
Then they'll love you again, and again
Again

She said,
This time, I won't get turned away
This time, I won't get turned away
This time, I won't get turned away
[Repeat]

But Jesus Christ
What did you do
To deserve what they done to you?
[Repeat]

We're coming downtown
See what we got
We got the right
[Repeat]

We know something ain't right
We know something ain't right

I said
Going downtown
See what we got
We got the right

We got the right
