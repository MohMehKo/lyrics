You came without warning,
All your love was so
Grab my neck and pulled it
Keep dragging me alone
I should be happy,
But all I feel is blue!
But I still don't wanna
Stay away from you!

Ooh, I know it's a good thing
Find someone for me
I would say I'm happy,
They say talk is cheap!
I didn't wanna pull my heart under the light
Just in case it falls over to its demise
She wears my favorite color
Everyday in her eyes!

Never thought I'd find someone to keep
God knows I'm hard to please
Never thought I'd find someone to keep
God knows I'm hard to please

Ooh, I know it's a good thing
Find someone to be with me
I would say I'm happy,
They say talk is cheap!
Do you wanna pull my heart under the light
Just in case it falls over to its demise
She wears my favorite color
Everyday in her eyes!
