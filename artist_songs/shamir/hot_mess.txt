What ever happened to Mort Marcus or Satcha. How about Hugo Mittens or Elijah Smoothe or Alfonse Decree and Teddy Pasta a straight hair rasta with a bone straight weave that will bring you to your knees. Assuming they're all hot messes like me. Mm...who knows?

This is the time [x5]

Never thought I'd be this cold
Cuz of my life I've lost a hold
You can have it. It's yours, not mine
Cuz the only thing on my mind is...

It's all of me what's born to be
Cuz what they say is not what it seems
Feel like I'm right but always wrong
Guess I just don't belong
(Damn he's a hot mess. Damn he's a hot mess
Damn he's a hot mess. Damn he's a hot...)

Can I have a drink? Don't wanna think
Cuz my outlook is on my enemy
Just wanna sleep cuz I miss the link
Between what I want and what's given to me

It's all of me what's born to be
Cuz what they say is not what it seems
Feel like I'm right but always wrong
Guess I just don't belong
(Damn he's a hot mess. Damn he's a hot mess
Damn he's a hot mess. Damn he's a hot...)

Damn, he's a hot mess. [x16]

My body aches. My mind's at rest
Thinking about every bad decision
Feel so alone. Don't have a home
But I'm part of a bigger mission

It's all of me what's born to be
Cuz what they say is not what it seems
Feel like I'm right but always wrong
Guess I just don't belong
(Damn he's a hot mess. Damn he's a hot mess
Damn he's a hot mess. Damn he's a hot...)

Damn, he's a hot mess. [x16]
Sexy, sexy, sexy, sexy. [x4]
Damn, he's a hot mess. [x6]
Damn. The time
