We're just shells
That are dwelled
But our souls blow
Would you knew what you shouldn't said
But for love we leave
Is our legacy
So we'll keep at the light
And our memory
Because it doesn't get darker
Unless you expected to
It's just getting harder to contain the truth
Because it doesn't get darker
Unless you expected to, ye-yeah
It's just getting harder to contain the truth

And they tell us things
That seats you off us and love
But they're just lying
It's only getting hard
Without asking
Well I'm made of flesh
You will keep it at the light
Above all raise
Because it doesn't get darker
Unless you expected to
It's just getting harder to contain the truth
You know it doesn't get darker
Unless you expected to
It's just getting harder to contain the truth
You can't contain the truth
You can't contain the truth
You can't contain the truth
You can't contain the truth
