Show me your glowing honor
My shining knight
Blind me with valor and honor
Shaded from the wicked night

My eyes seem to deceive me
But my heart knows the truth

We wish that blithe behavior
Was left in our, our youth
But we, we have no clue

Charm on crude as you do
That your horns are picking up
I know the game you're playing
No more cat and mouse

We wish that blithe behavior
Was something we can choose
And was left in our, our youth
But we, we have no clue
Was left in our, our youth
But we, we have no clue

Youth, youth, youth, youth, youth
Wish we left it in our... [x16]
Oh youth! [x8]
