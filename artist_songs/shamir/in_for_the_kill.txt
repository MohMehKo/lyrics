Let me off and say goodbye
I'm ready to be sacrificed
Tell my love I wish them well
And I'm sorry [?]

[?] I'm holding on desperately
But you know they always will
Going in for the kill

[?] I'm just a compromise
But still, there's life in my eyes
Stay still and surrender to the [?]

[?] I'm holding on desperately
But you know they always will
Going in for the kill

Please don't cry
Turn around and say goodbye
I'll be back someday
And when [?]
I promise you
I won't make the same mistakes

[?] I'm holding on desperately
But you know they always will
Going in for the kill
But can't you see
I'm holding on desperately
But you know they always will
Going in for the kill
