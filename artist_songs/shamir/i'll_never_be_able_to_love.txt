I'll never be able to love
I'm not content with that
I'll never find that missing piece
To make up for what I lack

I'll never be able to cry
Cuz when I do, I feel ashamed
Cuz I was torn when I was young
And crying means you lost the game

I'll start to be alone
Vert was my name
But for some reason everyone like me
And I just can't handle the attention I gained

I'll never be able to cry
Cuz when I do, I feel ashamed
Cuz I was torn when I was young
And crying means you lost the game

You lost the game, oh
You lost the game, oh
You lost the game, yeah

I'll never be able to love
But who am I to say
I'll never find that person I
Wouldn't mind seeing every day
Every day
Every day
Every day
