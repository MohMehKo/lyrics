Love never came easily to me
There were no fish swimming in my sea
I resided myself to the fact
That I would always love never to be loved back
But that's okay, I know some day

When the sun has set, I will go dig up the dead
Lift their bodies from their graves
And I'll lay them in my bed
To fill their hollow hearts with all of my broken parts
And all the love they were never shown
To all those who have lived and died alone

I guess I thought it couldn't really hurt
To search for sweethearts underneath the dirt
Sure, they may be made of dust and bone
But I will take them home from their lonely tombstone
To be with me in the Dead Sea

When the sun has set, I will go dig up the dead
Lift their bodies from their graves
And I'll lay them in my bed
To fill their hollow hearts with all of my broken parts
And all the love that they were never shown
To all those who have lived and died alone

When the sun has set, I will go dig up the dead
Lift their bodies from their graves
And I'll lay them in my bed
I will fill their hollow hearts with all of my broken parts
And all the love that they were never shown
To all those who have lived and died alone

To all those who have lived and died alone
