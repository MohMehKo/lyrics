Hands are shakin got your finger on the trigger 
Jesus ain't complainin gonna figure it out 
Somebody raped my tapeworm abortion
Come on motherfuckers and deliver the cow

Brain and body melting while there's roaches multiplying 
It's the alien infection it's the coming of Christ
All these sentimental halos and these consequential angels
When I'm runnin with the devil don't deliver the fight

Don't look at me now
Fell too fast your wings won't hold
Don't look at me now 
Fell too fast your wings won't hold 

Yeah and when I want to
Yeah I will find you
Yeah and when I want to
Yeah I will blind you

Brains are frying while the kings and queens are dying 
Satan won the race and the miracle mile
Somebody raped my tapeworm abortion
Come on mothertuckers and deliver the cow
It's all over me now 
Let me go, let me go, let me go
What's come over me now 
Let me go, let me go, let me go 
It's all over me now 
Let me go, let me go, let me go 
What's come over me now

Johnny sat down beside the old oak tree
Cut off his hand what did he see
All of the animals are dead 
The rats have crawled through his house and out through their head
One of them ate a hole in the sky
To believe this would be a fate worse than dying
