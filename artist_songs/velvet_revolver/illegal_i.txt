One fine day
I'll settle down
When you bloody me
I ran aground
With my broken face
And fisticuff 
Fuck the rest and
All their stuff 

I - Don't - Anymore 
I - Don't - Anymore 

Just look and you'll
See me
Lying there
Lying there

Just look and you'll
See me
Lying there
Lying 

Another way 
A battle ground 
A ready teller whore
Who makes no sound
Keep the money bitch
Keep the stuff
Fly around the world
And keep it up 

I - Don't - Anymore
I - Don't - Anymore

It's killing time on the streets
All hate Sunday
