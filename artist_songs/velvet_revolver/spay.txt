Wasted all all a disgrace
Rearranged the pretty messes
Pray on your abandoned knee
To fucked up pleasures
To the kids with king of rights
Underneath the night tonight
You would rather spite your face
Than change your life

[Chorus x2]
Spay
Why won't you
Why won't you
Why won't you
Spay yourself

Blitzkrieg the bitches bald
May the trophy sell the gold
Pay the toll or sell your soul
Come on come all
When the bill is on collections
Pepper holes and ugly messes
The singer sings of diamond things
And all excesses

[Chorus x2]

There is a love that doesn't lease
Through the night
Heed all your baggage
And consume all your life

[Chorus x2]
