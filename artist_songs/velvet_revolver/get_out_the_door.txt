Come on closer, won't you tell me what you got
Wait a minute girl, you're something that you're not
Big cities screaming, driving feathers to and fro
Brass in pocket, thought you hit it when you walked up to my door
I've been down this road so long
Seen miles and miles of freaks before

[Chorus]
Get out the door
Get out the door
Gonna kick you when I saw what you were packing
Gonna kick it out the door
Get out the door
Gonna kick you when I saw what you were packing
Gonna kick it out the door

Like Transformers girl there's more than meets the eye
Another beer and then I mighta end up buyin'
The city screams it's full of Angelos and Toms
Never underestimate the danger of sunset boulevard
I've been down this road so long
Seen miles and miles of freaks before

[Chorus]

I've been down this road so long
That miles and miles of freaks before
Think I stop and think I strong
But never could I been so wrong, so wrong

[Chorus x2]
