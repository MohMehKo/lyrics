Can't rise from the bottom
Time flies when ya got it
Your time has receded
Wasted
Could and should have been
And didn't

[Chorus]
I've given up my hand for a brother
Given up a hand for free
I've risen and forgiven and I've pardoned
But you set yourself free

Nose dive, crash to the bottom
Angel, your wing was always broken
Fought for rights of the prophets
Not for the spirits of your daughters
Didn't

[Chorus]

Walk slowly
Seems like time has stopped
Seems like I'm slow dancing
But I'm flying
Where do I go?
The home I know is closed
I'm free, free yeah
I'm free, free, yeah
Free, free, yeah

I've bitten off my hand for a brother
Given up a hand for free
I've risen and forgiven and I've pardoned
But you set yourself free

Bitten off my hand for the stuff
And livin' off the shit you steal
You perished for religious and forgotten
daughters that you couldn't see

Given up my hand (You set yourself free)
Given up my hand for free
Given up my hand (You set yourself free)
But you set yourself free
