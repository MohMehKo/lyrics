At school the teacher saw
The talent in your eyes
So pleased to meet ya
She looks so pretty, so unsatisfied
Underneath the bleachers
The kid and Mrs. Jones
She's his favorite teacher
Consider it love 101

[Chorus]
We ain't got nothin' to hide, hide
We ain't got nothin' to hide, hide, hide
We ain't got nothin' to hide, hide
We ain't got nothin' nothing nothing to hide.
Oh you say it's wrong you say what you do, you do, you do
Oh you say we're wrong you say what we do, we do, we do
Oh you say it's wrong you say what you do, you do, you do
Oh you say we're wrong you say what we do, we do, we do wrong

What we do wrong

Rollin' in the street lights,
In his old man's ride
Head in his lap goin' up and down up and down
Oh no, cop lights
Standin' in the courthouse
In front of every child
She said "Your Honor I plead to,
Crime of being satisfied"

[Chorus]

Kinda feelin' in love
I'm kinda feelin' in love
I'm kinda feelin' in love
Kinda feelin' love (But I'm Just 16) [x5]

Oh you say it's wrong you say what you do, you do, you do
Oh you say we're wrong you say what we do, we do, we do
Oh you say it's wrong you say what you do, you do, you do
Oh you say we're wrong you say what we do, we do, we do wrong

We do wrong
You do wrong [x7]
