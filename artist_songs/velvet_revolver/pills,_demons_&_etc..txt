You, you got skills you got the pills
You're getting older
You got the weight of all that's left you on your shoulder
But the world still waits for you
Though you stare right through me

You got your demons and your ways of life
You could pull the trigger and
You'd end the strike

I got the news you had the blues you bought a ticket
To the one place that I won't be going to visit
What the fuck where you thinking
Now I stare right through you

You got your demons and your ways of life
You could pull the trigger and
You'd end the strike
You got your demons and your fancy wine
It would go down easy if you'd spend the night

You got your demons and your ways of life
You could pull the trigger and
You'd end the strike
You got your demons and your fancy wine
It would go down easy if you'd spend the night
