As soon as I walk in the front door you’re drunk on the wine
You’re the craziest bitch ill ever find
Like I said ill walk in the front door
Sometimes she chased me out through the other door
Don’t start that shit tonight
The police and that kind
And when I lay there and I dream
Its all their faces that I see
Don’t drop that dime
Don’t drop that dime
Sweet Caroline oh mine don’t drop that dime on me tonight
It all begin with that old sinking feeling
Then we start drinking rye
I could smell the crazy coming out in that hard rain tonight
Like I said ill walk through the front door
Another woman she was parked at the back door
Ill get busted, yea ill probably get busted once or twice before yea
And when I lay there and I dream
Its all there faces that I see
Don’t drop that dime
Don’t drop that dime
Sweet Caroline oh mine don’t drop that dime on me tonight
Oh the pain so sweet
Oh the game so mean
I caught your lie
I drove all night
You cherish whispers while I sleep
Don’t drop that dime
Don’t drop that dime
Sweet girl oh mine don’t draw that gun on me tonight
Don’t drop that dime
Don’t drop that dime
Don’t shoot that gun o mine don’t shoot that gun at me tonight
Don’t drop that dime
Don’t drop that dime
Don’t shoot that gun o mine don’t shoot that gun at me tonight
Yoodle
