Love songs keep pumpin' on my radio
You split on Monday
Took your machine that kept me afloat
Now you're back it's Tuesday

I call it love insanity
I call it my reality
She mine, mine all mine
She mine, mine all mine

Cool kids keep movin' as the car explodes
Roll around on Sunday
Dual diagnosis is the way to go
Poppin' pills like candy

I call it love insanity
I call it my reality
She mine, mine all mine
She mine, mine all mine

While away
Our old mistakes
Break the fray
Change
She mine, mine all mine
She mine, mine all mine
She mine, mine all mine
She mine, mine all mine
