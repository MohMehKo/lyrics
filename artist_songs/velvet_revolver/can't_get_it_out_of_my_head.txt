[ELO Cover]

Midnight on the water
I saw the ocean's daughter
Walkin' through the burnin' rain
Hopin' just to know her name

[Chorus]
And I cant get it out of my head
No, I cant get it out of my head
Now my old world is gone for dead
Cause I cant get it out of my head

Breakdown on the shore line
Can't move, I've been paralyzed
Morning don't get here till night
Searching for her silver light

[Chorus]

Out of my head

Bank job in the city
Robin Hood and William tell and Ivanhoe and Lancelot
They don't envy me
Sitting still I want to drown
In my dreams the world keep going round and round

[Chorus x2]
