Honey so long, nice to see you
Won't be long before I come back home
When the plane lands, will you reach me
Will you call me on the telephone

Tell my son I wish I never yelled at him yesterday cause everything's changed
Radar signal seeking you, but finding nothing at all, hey --
Blow the horn and call the cavalry there's something happening, hey --

Goodbye mother, tell my daughter
Have to leave get off the telephone
There's a problem, sinking feeling
Hero's dying, plastic armor on

Tell my son I wish I never yelled at him yesterday cause everything's changed
And you, you gave me all you had, hey --
I hope someday you will be happy, without me

Lost in a world thats quickly going mad
A human missile streaking to the ground
Angels and the demons fight to save the lives
While all the others cry

As for you, you made my life worth living, hey --
I pray one day you will be happy, without me

Goodbye
Goodbye.
