You operate and motivate on synthetic fuel
You're mother nature and an atom bomb
As long as you're kept full of pretty bodies
Your little secret will be safe with me 

Around again
Insane again
It comes again
And sets me free

[Chorus:]
So set me free, set me free
'Cause I think you need my soul
Set me free, set me free

You're kept alive and polarized with one thing in mind
Metabolize everything that you see
But now and then or a little later
Now I'm gonna take you down with me

Around again
Insane again
She comes again
And sets me free

[Chorus x2]
So set me free, set me free
'Cause I think you need my soul
Set me free, set me free

[Bridge x2]
So take me down
Take me, down, down, down, down
Take me down, take me down

[Chorus x4]
So set me free, set me free
'Cause I think you need my soul
Set me free, set me free

My freedom!

That's a wrap!
