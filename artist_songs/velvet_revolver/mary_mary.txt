Got a feelin' feelin' in your eyes
Got a fever, fever, fever in your thighs
In your thighs
Mary, Mary, Mary by my side
Got time and love the kind you cannot buy
Cannot buy
Black boots strong legs got style
My baby knows the walk you see her come for miles
Come for miles

[Chorus]
Want to find out what you're saying
Want to play the games you're playing
Mary, Mary, on my mind (Get back sugar baby)
Mary, Mary, on my mind (Get back sugar baby)
Mary, Mary, on my mind

Modern lover modern kind
When we close the door we're never out of time
Out of time
Black hair, red lips, brown eyes
Can't tell you how it feels that you're mine, o' mine
Mine o' mine

[Chorus]

Baby, baby, baby's on my mind
When we close the door we're never out of time
Out of time

Want to play the games you're playing
Mary, Mary, on my mind (Get back sugar baby) [x4]
Mary, Mary, on my mind

Come on out
Get on out
