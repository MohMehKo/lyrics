Me
I'm a man
Who is trudging
Best I can
Through a minefield
Built to blast
Can I make it
Will I last

Free my mind, levitate 
Don't let any of those fuckers in my headspace

Please
Let me be
No more questions
No more needs
You're the cancer
You're the leech
Sent to bleed me
Of disease

Free my mind, levitate
Don't let any of those fuckers in my headspace 
Let me go my own way
Burn the rest of them that try to keep me enchained

Living taking chances
Isn't all that it's meant to be
Dying with your face on
A t-shirt isn't all that original

Me
I'm the man
Will I make it
Will I last
