They lost imagination
Designer institution
They checked out the revolution
Don't see no resolution

They got their arms around us
We got our arms around it
They barely got each other
Dance
Dance, dance little hooker shake it
Dance or you will be banned
You're the one who is all mistaken
You're the gas and a dollar laugh

Then came the resolution
Don't need no moderation
Sell out your generation
Don't give no restitution

They got their arms around us
We got our arms around it
They barely got each other
Dance

Dance, dance little hooker shake it
Dance or you will be banned
You're the one who is all mistaken
You're the gas and a dollar laugh

She's all right
Saw the medic tonight
That's alright
Self exposed hunger strike
Just hold tight you'll see the sun and you'll feel alive
She's alright
Lost in a world she holds tonight

[Solo]

[x2]
Dance little hooker shake it
Dance, or you will be banded
You're the one that is so mistaken
You're a gas and a dollar laugh
You're a gas and a dollar laugh
