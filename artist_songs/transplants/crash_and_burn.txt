[Chorus x2:]
Crash and burn crash and burn crash and burn tonight
We're gonna keep on partying till the wake of daylight

[Tim]
Rosy is a Puerto Rican porn star; that girl knows how to get down
Yeah, making money, making movies, lying horizontal dropping all her clothes on the ground
Yeah, now Rosy said: "Wake up, Tim it's midnight, it's a city out there to go for a ride"
Yeah, like two vampires, we ride through the cities, we stripped her backside
I don't give a fuck, never did never would, never could back down, not one time
So I'm gonna keep, making music, making records, keep telling people what's on my mind
I'm the same kid that I ever was even though I got platinum plaques on my walls
And I dress in black and it's a fact I don't give a goddamn at all

[Chorus]

[Rob]
I think back to better days, took a license to ill
Before I ever held something I fell in love with them pills
Back before I had to ride and go in for a kill
Way before I tried to rhyme and go in for a deal
It's real survives with guns playing only from the shoulders
Wrong way down a one way still avoid the rollers
Still I beat a motherfucker like it's going outta style
Tried to cheat me outta my cash so I beat it out his child
I'm wild, my pupils dilated same as my people
I'm the only mother present to build you a church steeple
Speak evil to the world teach all the boys and girls
That they can't trust no one, show 'em fuck what you heard
Cause I mind my own business and I do my own dirt
And I make my own money cause I got my own work
I swear somebody better send a ceast and desist
Before I squeeze it with my fist and they cease to exist

[Chorus]

[Rakaa]
A party was bash for how long it was lasted
Some turn cash like hash to ashes
some dash hot slugs run the fastest
Who we fought to eat, unless we fasting
But thugs are not like most actors casted
Thugs might blast and smash your casket
America's worst fear, white, brown and black kids, together
fed up, strapped up to tatted
bald heads, jerry curls, classic perms,
various sets that'll flash off sherm
toast to a new day having its turn
tequila, the bottle is like a bath for worms
the paranoid, that's way past concerned
I hope the country and the world get past this term
this is show and tell, so the class will learn
party go until the cops come and crash and burn

[Chorus]
