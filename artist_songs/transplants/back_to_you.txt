You gotta watch where you go and watch what you do
Gotta watch what you say and who it's said to
You gotta watch who you cross and watch how you move
Cause one day it'll come back to you

One day this'll be over, and I'm goin' be singing the blues
But that day ain't here yet no, so I'm goin' to be pushing through
This time we're gonna work it out, this time we got it right
This time we're gonna hold our weapons level and shoot them into the night

You gotta watch where you go and watch what you do
Gotta watch what you say and who it's said to
You gotta watch who you cross and watch how you move
Cause one day it'll come back to you

I can't believe that it happened my friend
Or better yet, that it happened again
I think about the time and the money spent
Too much, too long, too broke to mend
All the choices you made, they were made by yourself
Not once did you ever think of anyone else
Well I got no more to give, so you got no more to take
Cause if you got no heart then you got nothing to break

You gotta watch where you go and watch what you do
Gotta watch what you say and who it's said to
You gotta watch who you cross and watch how you move
Cause one day it'll come back to you

Take down the opposition and who are you going against?
At what side are you going to stand in line, and I ain't sitting on no fence
These days I fight smarter and harder than ever before
These days I learn from my mistakes, know who to trust no more

You gotta watch where you go and watch what you do
Gotta watch what you say and who it's said to
You gotta watch who you cross and watch how you move
Cause one day it'll come back to you
