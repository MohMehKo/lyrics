She loves me (nope), she loves me not
She done cool either way, she can shake up the spot
She can take a cab, she ain't came with the drop
And Imma do something similar, shaking the cops
Trying to get that, nah bitch alla-kazaam
Ali Baba in my lungs with a can in my hand
Trying to make me see it different, I ain't even convinced
Trying to make it to a place that don't even exist

Something different man, something like a dream here
Sounds never heard, seen sights I've never seen
Ain't really much to live for, nothing to believe
Where I'm at is where it's at, feels something like a scene

Something's different, something's different
Something's different, something's different
Something's different, something's different

They say that money make the man, nah the man make the money
Getting mail like the post office rains when it's sunny
In the woods where the bears ain't looking for the honey
You better watch your back, ain't a damn thing funny
The streets done changed, it used to use crews
Now every man's for himself, so watch these fools
Cause they follow no codes, got no loyalty
And everybody wanna kill a king to be royalty

Something different man, something like a dream here
Sounds never heard, seen sights I've never seen
Ain't really much to live for, nothing to believe
Where I'm at is where it's at, feels something like a scene

Something's different, something's different
Something's different, something's different
Something's different, something's different

Something's different, something's different
Something's different, something's different
Something's different, something's different

It's like something real different
And ya'll can feel the earth shifting
I stay politic-ing in every verse spit
But I'm still live with the Mary-J blaze
I'll be the same way when everything change
And folks turn they back and burn the bridge
I'll apply the little lessons that we learned as kids
Trying to really change this world by doing music
But I need a new drug, like Hewey Lewis
Something different

Something different man, something like a dream here
Sounds never heard, seen sights I've never seen
Ain't really much to live for, nothing to believe
Where I'm at is where it's at, feels something like a scene

Something different man, something like a dream here
Sounds never heard, seen sights I've never seen
Ain't really much to live for, nothing to believe
Where I'm at is where it's at, feels something like a scene

Something's different, something's different
Something's different, something's different
Something's different, something's different

Something's different, something's different
Something's different, something's different
Something's different, something's different
