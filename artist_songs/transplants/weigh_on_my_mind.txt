[Chorus]
I got so many problems (I got so many problems)
And they weigh on my mind (And they weigh on my mind, now)
I don't solve 'em, no, I just cause them (I don't solve 'em I just cause 'em)
And they weigh on my mind (And they weigh on my mind now)

Tell me, where do you go when your money's all gone?
When your friends are all gone? When your love is all gone?
No right turns, always seem to be wrong
All goes bad, it's so hard to be strong
It's an uphill battle I don't think I can win
I try to do right but I'm surrounded by sin
Say, he's a better man, don't compare me to him
I've climbed the highest tree, now I'm stuck on a limb

[Chorus]

I look for guiding light, but the bulbs they all burned out
Got up to the door and the lights they all turned out
Said they couldn't teach me so I guess I'm all learned out
Saw my soul die, didn't fly, it just squirmed out
In the blink of an eye I turned my home to a house
I know what to say but no words will come out
My time's almost up, I don't have any doubts
I said my time is almost up and I don't have any doubts

I'm gonna hold on as long as I can here
And my American dream, I have some doubts there
I'm gonna hold on as long as I can here
And my American dream, I have some doubts there
And I don't wanna fight here

[Chorus]
