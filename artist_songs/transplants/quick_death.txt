"And I ask you, my brothers and sisters, who is the true animal?"

Looks so violent.
Death is silent.
Beating me with your words (I’m bleeding now).
Battled to your head
And degenerating here at the brand new hope.
Devils surround me.
Anger astounds me.
Tearing apart my soul (beneath my guts).
About to go outside,
But it was then I,
Seemed to have lost control

"And now, my brothers and sisters, the inversion begins"

Forever in night light.
Losing in hindsight.
Ownership changes hands (you'll never know).
It only gets through me (causing a slow death).
Welcome to human hell.
I've got you a new fate.
Back in the sweepstakes.
Leaving the streets behind (your final sign).
Silence is true peace (Don’t ever read me).
Aloud cause I’ll take your life.

I’ll have you,
I’ll have you [4x]
wishing for

I'll have you
I’ll have you

I’ll have you,
I’ll have you [4x]
wishing for

A quick death [10x]

I’ll have you,
I’ll have you [3x]
wishing for

I’ll have you
I’ll have you

I’ll have you,
I’ll have you [4x]
