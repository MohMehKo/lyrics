Well, I don't know just where I'm going
I can't remember where I've been
All I know is what I know
And I hope someday we'll meet again.

You gotta come quick if you really want it
Move fast if you wanna survive
Life is a cruel joke if you don't watch it
What it is just to stay alive
Things will gonna get crazy living in the city
Standing in the goddamn rain
Ended up this goddamn blueprint
The rest of them all insane.

Come around, why y'all come around
Come around on the wrong part of town.

Well, I don't know just where I'm going
I can't remember where I've been
All I know is what I know
And I hope someday we'll meet again.

I've seen the blood drain through the cracks of the sidewalk
I bathed in the flames of the city night
I've lost just enough, realize all that I've got
Can all go away in the blink of an eye
Here's one for the road and one more the past
Doing various fight funerals, occasional laugh
Let's drink to the times, both the good and the bad
And I may not be waking up so this might be my last.

Well, I don't know just where I'm going
I can't remember where I've been
All I know is what I know
And I hope someday we'll meet again.

And if you wanna see how I see it
Life hangs on a thread
And when it comes to playing it safe
I'll take a chance instead
There were times that I was guilty
And I tried to do what's right
Ain't no one who gonna break me down
Not without a fight.

Come around, why y'all come around
Come around on the wrong part of town.

Well, I don't know just where I'm going
I can't remember where I've been
All I know is what I know
And I hope someday we'll meet again.

Come around, come around.
