This song goes out to a good friend of mine
He lives life to the fullest, (yeah) every single day

Down in Oakland
I'm gonna find them
I'm gonna get them
I'll go rewind them
You can not hide them
I will go find them
Oh down in Oakland
It's such a scene, man

With a hard boy drunken Ballentine
He's got 7 teeth left in his head, yea
He works at docks in the day
At night he walks with the dead
And this lady comes over to him
She wants to take him for a ride
She said, "This dirty old town got no place a hide"

Time going away in town
And you got nowhere to go
Oh you cannot move around
When your stuck in a blizzard snow
You wear your wrongs and your rights
And you choose what's gonna be a sight
She said, "In this dirty old town there's no place a hide"

Down in Oakland
I'm gonna find them
I'm gonna get them
I'll go rewind them
You can not hide them
I will go find them
Oh down in Oakland
It's such a scene, man

"Hey, where am I?"

Down in Oakland
I'm gonna find them
I'm gonna get them
I'll go rewind them
You can not hide them
I will go find them
Oh down in Oakland
It's such a scene, man
