[Chorus:]
We trusted you, we put out a helping hand
Only in return, we get a stabbing in the back

I paid a visit to a man who was pretty crazy
Cooled off in the shade, we were feelin' lazy
Trouble starts coming, nothing can phase me
When tomorrow looks very hazy
Took us for granted, let's start here
Friendship over, so very clear
Then what is fair is gonna be fair
Fuck you...you're over

[Chorus]

It's time to weed out the weak, do away with their lives
I see it so clear now, through my open eyes
Stood by your side, you put a knife in my back
Never ever thought it'd be you who would do me like that
But we live and we learn, or so it's said
One thing about you, I can't wait till you're dead
The mistakes I've made won't happen again
Keep my enemies closer than I keep my friends

It's got me fucked up, I just can't let it go
Will we ever be the same? Well my answer is no
Think about your death every goddamn day
Wanna know what I think? This is what I must say
I say we line 'em all up, then we gun 'em all down
Then we all celebrate when they all hit the ground
Don't wake up now, it's gonna be too late
Don't give me that shit about cleaning the slate
You've been at it too long, all your life that I've checked
Now your time's almost up with a noose on your neck
Smile in my face, better watch your back
Two-faced motherfucker gets both jaws cracked

[Chorus]

[Instrumental]

If you don't stand for nothing I can't really stand behind you
Who knew you withdrew your point of view
I lost mine, you cry and whine all the time
And I cant stand aside or anywhere near you
I'd get in check, you're a wreck, no respect,
In effect you elect me to fuckin' hate you
I'll break you down on the ground, I've found
You're a clown, I'm around, you want war? I'll take you
Stand aside, take a ride, I won't try, you're a lie, my lyrical lesson will teach you
So take a stand if you can, my man, go where I stand, I'll hold my land
But in the real world you get squashed and then stung
Get hit bitch, slit, aw then you get hung
in a fantasy all day long, it must be so fun being so fucking dumb

[Chorus]
