All the priests and the prophets and the peace missionaries
(You gotta see it to believe it)
They all got tricked by the evil think-tank terrorists
(You gotta see it to believe it)
When World War III starts homicide destruction
(You gotta see it to believe it)
And we're all blind-sighted by the kiss of corruption
(You gotta see it to believe it)

This will be the death of us all
One world, one bomb, one phone call
This will be the end of the line
No life, no chance, no more time

It's Government spending and Government rules
(You gotta see it to believe it)
The governments pending, we're governed by fools
(You gotta see it to believe it)
The burning of buildings, the burning of schools
(You gotta see it to believe it)
The city's in shambles, and life is in ruins
(You gotta see it to believe it)

This will be the death of us all
One world, one bomb, one phone call
This will be the end of the line
No life, no chance, no more time

Who's got the weapons to pull the fucking triggers?
(You gotta see it to believe it)
We got the thermonuclear bombs that blow up bigger
(You gotta see it to believe it)
You see, thermonuclear war ain't no illusion
(You gotta see it to believe it)
From the drop-off point to the final conclusion
(You gotta see it to believe it)

This will be the death of us all
One world, one bomb, one phone call
This will be the end of the line
No life, no chance, no more time

It's a nuclear nightmare, political bombs
(You gotta see it to believe it)
One push of the button, and everyone's gone
(You gotta see it to believe it)
No one to brag to, 'cause no one is left
(You gotta see it to believe it)
Everybody falling victim to a horrible death
(You gotta see it to believe it)

This will be the death of us all
One world, one bomb, one phone call
This will be the end of the line
No life, no chance, no more time

This will be the death of us all
One world, one bomb, one phone call
This will be the end of the line
No life, no chance, no more time

You gotta see it to believe it
You gotta see it to believe it
You gotta see it to believe it
You gotta see it to believe it
