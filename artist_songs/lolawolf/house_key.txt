Go ahead and say we're through
I don't care, I'll just get another you
I'll get another dude that look like you
I don't need you, and you don't need me
Give me back my house key

You can leave it with my new boyfriend
You can leave it on the back, back, back porch
I don't care when you leave it, leave a message
You used to never get the message
Yeah I'm talkin' shit, yeah I'm talkin' shit

Go ahead and say we're through
You used to always try to tell me what to do
I'll get another dude that look like you
I don't need you, and you don't need me
Give me back my house key
You know, fuck it, I don't care if we're through
I don't care, I'll just get another you
I'll get another dude that look like you
I don't need you, and you don't need me
Give me back my house key

What you mean, what we do about our friends?
I don't wanna spare 'em
These my boys and I don't wanna fuckin' share 'em
This ain't that movie, it's the sequel
Actually no, this is the prequel
I have all my friends, we are no longer equal
All I'm askin for's my key-key-key-key
So slip it to the doorman
Slip it to the doorman
Slip it through the door, man

This could be easy
This could be easy
This could be easy
This could be easy

Go ahead and say we're through
You used to always try to tell me what to do
I'll get another dude that look like you
I don't need you, and you don't need me
Give me back my house key
You know, fuck it, I don't care if we're through
I don't care, I'll just get another you
I'll get another dude that look like you
I don't need you, and you don't need me
Give me back my house key
