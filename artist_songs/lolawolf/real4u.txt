I know just how to make it real for you
I know you're scared
When you wanted me, I couldn't want you
But now I can

Since I know how to love you
[?] I think I'm tryin'
Now that I know what to do
I'm sellin', I'm buyin'
I'm in your head
I scrolled your lion
Laid you down, put on voodoo and now you think I'm lyin'?
I wanna... win my [?]
Don't think I understand
Where, oh where, oh where, oh where
Oh where you think you're flyin'

I know just how to make it real for you
I know you're scared
When you wanted me, I couldn't want you
But now I can
I know just how to make it real for you
I know you're scared
When you wanted me, I couldn't want you
But now I can

Don't tell me to take my time, then tell me I'm slow
I get it, I change my mind, always changin' my mind
Double tap, can you feel me? Can you feel me?
You wanna hold my hand? Nah, I don't think you understand
Got you, got you, got you, got you
Got you to come close
Now come on, stay, I said come on, stay

I know just how to make it real for you
I know you're scared
When you wanted me, I couldn't want you
But now I can
I know just how to make it real for you
I know you're scared
When you wanted me, I couldn't want you
But now I can
