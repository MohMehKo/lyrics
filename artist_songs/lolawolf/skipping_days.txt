Hanging out on the hotel floor
If you're down, I'm gonna ask for more
Feelin' alive, I've been alive before
Dancin' till my body's sore

She'll it up, she'll it up with me
Got to pay for good company
Tell me, tell me, it'll be alright

And I'm always thinkin' of ways
I'm always thinkin' of ways to get better
And she keeps on skipping the days
She will sleep until the night if you let her
And I'm always thinkin of ways, I'm always thinkin of ways to get better
And she keeps on skipping the days
Skipping days

Can't let the night go
Cause I don't wanna start over
Can the night go through?
The days make them much shorter
I don't know what I'm thinkin' about but I
I'm feeling cornered
I think you know what I'm talkin' bout
This shit seems out of order

Close my eyes, forget about the time
Waitin' here I'm gonna stand in line
You know I really hate this town

But she'll get up, she'll get up with me
Got to pay for good company
Tell me, tell me, it gon' be alright

And I'm always thinkin' of ways
I'm always thinkin' of ways to get better
And she keeps on skipping the days
She will sleep until the night if you let her
And I'm always thinkin of ways, I'm always thinkin of ways to get better
And she keeps on skipping the days
Skipping days

Can't let the night go
Cause I don't wanna start over
Can the night go through?
The days make them more shorter
I don't know what I'm talking about but I
I'm feeling cornered
I think you know what I'm talking 'bout
This shit seems out of order
