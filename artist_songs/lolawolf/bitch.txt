"I slept in the darkness, it was lonely, and it was silent
What is this love?"

You, you make me feel
So brand new

When you talk about me
You’re not alone
When you talk about me
Talk about me

Who’s the bad ass bitch that nobody heard that everybody heard of?
Now everybody heard that?
Now everybody heard of?
[x4]

Do, do what you want
I’ll do it too
You have the walk and you’re talking it too

When you hear about me, I heard it too
When you hear about, you’ll hear about me

Who’s the bad ass bitch that nobody heard that everybody heard of?
Now everybody hear that?
Now everybody heard?
