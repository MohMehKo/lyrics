I won't tell you one more time
I'm not trying to make you mine
Fall in love and you love when it's done
You fall in love and you love when it's done

Who is she and what's her name?
They all start to look the same
Fall in love and you love when it's done
You fall in love and you love when it's done

But you made me feel so good
I can make a teardrop
Girl, you make me feel so good
Teardrop
How does it feel, them eyes are filling up
How does it feel
I'ma make the teardrop
How does it feel, them eyes are filling up
How does it feel
I'ma make the teardrop
Drop, drop, drop, drop...

Forever is like Jesus, it's just...
Something that we've made our self believe in
So... makes maybe our death a little less scary
It makes us feel safe but
Forever is so much more worse than that
Because you are here, but you're not with me
And love games are fucked
Fucking love games
Love's not a game and if it is, I don't want to play

I won't tell you one more time
I'm not trying to make you mine
Fall in love and you love when it's done
I can make a teardrop
Fall in love and you love when it's done
Teardrop

How does it feel, them eyes are filling up
How does it feel, them eyes are filling up
Oh you fall in love and you love when it's done
I'ma make your teardrop
Drop, drop, drop, drop...
I'ma make your teardrop

Love and you love when it's done
Fall in love and you love when it's done
Hey, fall in love and you love when it's done
Fall in love, fall in love, fall in love
Fall in love and you love when it's done
Fall in love, fall in love, fall in love
Oh, you fall in love and you love when it's done
