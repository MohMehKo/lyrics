Normally I get it right, I get it right
I like to work it out like a lady, right
Now I can't sleep, now I can't sleep
I got my mind on this man, keep me up all night
I gotta read along, this ain't sing along
Read 'em like a book cause they spell just how they look
He says he's gotta go, I love you, see you honey
Like I'm about to pay and I just ran out of money
His jersey's blank on the back, I think his name was...
Though, I think that's right, no, I'ma go ask, no
I ain't gon' ask, I ain't gon' ask
If he's the teacher, I'm in back of the class
I raise my hand, I wave my hand
I got the answers that he'll never understand

Normally I get it, get it
Normally I get it, I get it right
Get it, I get it right
Normally I get it, I get it right

My friends say I should wait
I should really take my time and show up late
And hang right back
Cause guys like that
But I'm a lady, right?
Don't guys like that?
Don't guys like dirty, is it too early?
Am I too flirty? Don't want to come off too thirsty
Now I'm looking in the mirror, I'ma show up like a grown up
If I'm late then he'll wait, I showed up late, he didn't wait
Got my confidence back when I saw him on the streets
Said meet me in the club, he said, "fuck the club"
I said meet me in the pub, he said, "what's a pub?"
What's a pub? Oh shit, he's serious
Show him how to drink so his heart will sink
Up to me, wanna curl up next to me
I took what the doctor didn't order
And turned right back to the old me
Old me, drinkin' Old E, old me
Old me, fuckin' hold me
Old me, now fuckin' hold me
I gave you shit the doctor didn't order
And now you owe me

Normally I get it, get it
Normally I get it, I get it right
Get it, I get it right
Normally I get it, I get it right
Get it, get it
Normally I get it, I get it right
Get it, I get it right
Normally I get it, I get it right
