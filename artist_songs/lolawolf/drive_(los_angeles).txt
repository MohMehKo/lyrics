Would you take me to the west side?
Would that be alright?
I could stare at your window
And fuck you tonight

Cause I want you in the worst way
But I don't have a car
So you have to come and get me
To have me where you are

Let's drive [x3]

Can we drink today and lay down
On the Hollywood sign?
And I promise not to breakdown
After my second line

Can it stay like this forever?
What happened last night?
The last thing I remember
Oh, the headlights so bright

Let's drive [x4]
