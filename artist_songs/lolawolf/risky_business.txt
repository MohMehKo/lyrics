It's risky
That shit is risky business, right?
He got that slurry rhythm, he got that limp
I'd take that boy home but man that's just risky business

What would you do, after me?
What did you do, after me, when I want you?
What do I do?
You're the kind that makes me shy
Only time you seen me cry
You liked it when I cried

It's risky business
That shit is risky, right?
He got that slurry rhythm, he got that limp
I'd take that boy and keep that shit my business

Got that temptation like anyone else
It's risky, but I'm feelin' frisky

Nothin' for you is a lot for me
Nothin' for you is a lot for me
When I want nobody but you
Tell them bitches that it's fine
Boy you must think that they're blind
Bitches, they're blind

It's my own business
That shit is risky business, damn that shit's just risky, right?
He got that slurry rhythm, he got that limp
I'd take that boy home and damn that shit's just risky business

Got that temptation like anyone else
It's risky
