Do ya?
Do you really wanna go and let the heat get to you?
And I've been watching all my words, they pass right through you
There's no talking while we're walking like we used to
And the clothes are coming off but there's no mood, yeah

You come running from the cold
Everytime I let you go
Everytime I let you go
Feel like breaking up
Summertime
Summertime
In the summertime
Feel like breaking up

Come now
You can't really go and let this get you down now
Think of all the fun we had all over town now
And yes you took over my mind, my mind's gone changing
And now it's just a different flavor I've been feeling
(I give up)
And you come running from the cold

Summertime
Summertime
In the summertime
Feel like breaking up
I can't help myself
