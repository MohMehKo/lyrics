Try to speed up the beat
Don’t know honest I can be
Calm Down

Rooms feeling pretty slow
I'm kindly asking you to watch your tone
Look at me
We ain’t on the phone
Watch your tone
Calm down

I get down and heavy all the time
Baby I want it
I need it

Gotta handle my shit
Could you move over just a bit
Close your eyes and you'll be fine
I get down and heavy all the time
Can't you see I'm losing my mind?

I get down and heavy all the time
Calm down
I need it
(I'm way over it now
I'm fine
Baby, I won't let them now so nevermind
And I'm way over it now
I'm fine
It's way over)
