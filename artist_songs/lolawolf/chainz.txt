I, I want you to try
But I can't stand up
Now I'm making you cry
And I, I want you to go
But I can't hold on
No I can't hold on

Now you got me in a head lock
And I got you in a tie-down
We're gonna cut a little blood back
No, I can't believe we found
Now you got me in a head lock
And I got you in a tie-down
We're gonna cut a little blood back
Can't believe we found love

Ahh
I'd put you in chains if I could change who you are
I'd put you in chains if I could change who you are
I'd put you in chains if I could change who you are (I'd put you in chains if I could change who you are)
I'd put you in chains if I could change who you are

I, I want you to die
But I can't go on
Without you being mine
And you, you tell me to stop
But I can't slow down
No I can't slow down

We could dance until the daylight
Or sit and have a stare-down
Should I judge you for your heartache?
I can't believe we found love
Dance until the daylight
Sit and have a stare-down
Judge you for your heartache?
I can't believe we found love

Ahh
I'd put you in chains if I could change who you are
I'd put you in chains if I could change who you are
I'd put you in chains if I could change who you are (I'd put you in chains if I could change who you are)
I'd put you in chains if I could change who you are
