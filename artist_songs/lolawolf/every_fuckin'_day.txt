I got everyone over in the middle of the day
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

Cause I mean what I mean
And I say what I wanna mean

I invited all my neighbours 'cuz I know they get curious
Then I kicked them all out
'Cuz they way too fuckin serious

Every fuckin' day
I think of you
Every fuckin' day I'm serious
I mean you got to be curious
Oh, you think you know me well
But not that well
What you think of me?

I mean you must be curious
Even just a little
You think I'm alive
Yeah I'm alive
My friends say I should let it go
Let it go!
I ain't really had it though
All I really wanted was to have them over
Who the fuck parties in the middle of the day?
All I wanted was to have them over

Every fuckin' day
I think of you every fuckin' day I'm serious
I mean you gotta be curious
Oh you think you know me well
But not that well
Every fuckin' day
I think of you every fuckin' day I'm serious
I mean you gotta curious
You think you know me well but not that well
What you think of me?

Oh, fuck!
Got the cops calling on us
Bet it was the neighbours
I don't blame them
To be honest
