Put me in a time machine
Wanna have fun
Cover me in gasoline
Wanna have fun
Tell a lie that I'll believe
Wanna have fun
Beat me down, make me plead
Wanna have fun

You and me and she are history
Yeah you and I and she just could not be
Sick of your melody, sick of your sign
Tired of everyone doing it right
So sick of your melody, sick of your sign

Outta my door, slip on my floor
Get outta my house
Ask for more, what good are they for?
Get outta my house
Spend my days wasting time
Get outta my house
Oh, get out, don't make me shout
Get outta my house

You and me and she are history
You and I and she just could not be
Sick of your melody sick of your sign
Tired of everyone doing it right
