I was stabbed and didn't care
I got drink but you weren't there
Getting loose on the floor
Beware

You should know how we act up here [x2]

Are the lights still on?
We gon' take 'em down slow
Get your friends high
They can't ask us why
We don't gotta know
Get your friends high
Ayo, ayo

Getting down with my lonely friends
They know how the story ends
Turn it up
Make my body bend
I can tell you how the story ends

You gon' lie down and play dead

Are the lights still on?
We gon' take 'em down slow
Get your friends high
They can't ask us why
We don't gotta know
Get your friends high
Ayo, ayo

You gon' lie down and play dead
