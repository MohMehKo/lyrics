Stay with me
Stay with me
Until the sun
I want you to stay with me
Stay with me
Until the sun has seen what we have done
All night long baby, what we've done

Baby let me do it
I could do it, wanna make you feel
Like you're the only one to lay down
You're the only one that laid down
Baby let me get it
I can get it, gonna love you so good
You gotta go, you wanna stay now

I can't take you home

Stay with me, until we're done
I want you to stay with me, until we're done
Stay with me, until the sun has seen what we have done
All night long baby, what we've done

Baby let me do it
I could do it, wanna make you feel
Like you're the only one to lay down
You're the only one that laid down
Baby let me get it
I can get it, gonna love you so good
You gotta go, you wanna stay now

I can't take you home
