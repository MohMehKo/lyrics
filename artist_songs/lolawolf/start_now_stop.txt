God damn
I'm not done with it
It's not my man, but I'm in love with it
I'm in love with you, but you are not mine
Ouh, you wanted me to come over
If I promise not to cry
I held it down like a soldier
Now you're asking me to leave

Oh, give me a reason
Cause I ain't going home
You don't wanna start
I ain't swinging low, I'm just leanin'
Or maybe you don't know
You don't wanna start now stop

Just like, like you wanted to
I'm down, I'm down
For what you wanna do
So what you wanna do
I'm down, I'm down
What a surprise to discover
You always think when you lie
It's no big deal just a bummer
Well we tried

Oh, give me a reason
Cause I ain't going home
You don't wanna start
I ain't swinging low, I'm just leanin'
Or maybe you don't know
You don't wanna start now stop

I ain't swinging low, I'm just leanin'
Or maybe you don't know
You don't wanna start now stop

Oh, give me a reason
Cause I ain't going home
You don't wanna start
I ain't swinging low, I'm just leanin
Or maybe you don't know
You don't wanna start
