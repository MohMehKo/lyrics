Feels like I'm falling
Gonna hit the ground
Concrete's a-calling, a familiar sound
I'm sick of floating, but I'm in the clouds
Feels like I'm falling

I'll take the pleasure, but I'll miss the pain
I feel surrender running through my veins
I can't remember how to be this way
Feels like I'm falling

And it feels like I'm losing my edge
And I still trying, but I'm crumbling instead
You make me feel so…

You make it lovely
So make it lovely
Don't make it too lovely
Make me feel lovely, I wanna make you love me
Don't make it too lovely

You'll be surrounded when you're in the crowd
I'll keep you grounded, with the rope I found,
But when I break down and I scream out loud
You'll be surrounded

Too hard to follow or play your game
Call me tomorrow
I won't be the same
I'll let you borrow into this game
Gets too hard to follow

And it feels like I'm losing my edge
And I keep trying, but I'm crumbling instead
You make me feel so…

You make it lovely
So make it lovely
Don't make it too lovely
Make me feel lovely, I wanna make you love me
Don't make it too lovely
