I can see you in the crowd
I can see you 'cause your heart lights up the sky
I can hear you screaming loud
Roaring like the thunder in the night
You're everywhere I go
I can, I can feel it in my bones
You're the only thing I know
You make me whole
Philadelphia, I'm coming to you when the night falls
New York, LA, Miami, no, it won't be long
Then it's London and Paris and Tokyo, Brazil
Don't you worry, I'll soon be around
Because the world is our playground
Everywhere in the world is our playground
I feel it in the atmosphere
Feeling the times change like waves of sound
A new day's already here
It comes into the light from underground
I wanna be where you are
I'll take you everywhere I go
When I look up to the stars
It takes me home
Philadelphia, I'm coming to you when the night falls
Chicago, Las Vegas and the Bay, no, it won't be long
Then it's Sweden, New Zealand, Mexico, Dubai
Don't you worry, I'll soon be around
Because the world is our playground
Everywhere in the world is our playground
Philadelphia, I'm coming to you when the night falls
Seattle, Atlanta and Houston, no, it won't be long
Then it's Egypt, Jamaica, China and Russia
Don't you worry, I'll soon be around
Because the world is our playground
Everywhere in the world is our playground
The world is our playground
Everywhere in the world is our playground
