It's 2 AM and cold outside
Is it too late to come, oh?
I can't even sleep at night 'cause, oh
It's 3 AM, I'm parked outside
I'm walking to your door, oh
And that can't wait another night 'cause, oh

25, 25/7 and
I give you all my attention
Baby, you're my obsession
25, 25/7 and
I give you love and affection
Baby, you're my obsession
Baby, you're my obsession
Baby, you're my obsession

It's 4 AM, I'm by your side
Our clothes are on the floor, oh
Don't wanna say goodbye
No, I want more

25, 25/7 and
I give you all my attention
Baby, you're my obsession
25, 25/7 and
I give you love and affection
Baby, you're my obsession
Baby, you're my obsession
Baby, you're my obsession
Obsession
25, 25/7 and
25, 25/7 and gotta know, gotta know know know know
Baby, you're my obsession
Baby, you're my obsession
Baby, you're my obsession
Baby, you're my obsession
Baby, you're my obsession
