Vice

Got your girl on my dick cause she know I'm 'bout to blow (Blow)
Blow, blow, blow, blow, blow
Got these hustlers yellin' bricks cause they know I'm 'bout to blow (Blow)
Blow, blow, blow, blow, blow
Cocaine on my clothes cause I'm whippin' up the blow (Blow)
Blow, blow, blow, blow, blow
Put some yay up in her nose then I tell that bitch to blow (Blow)
Blow, blow, blow, blow, blow

Tell a bitch to go, I ain't got time for hoes
You know I'm 'bout to blow, no propane
All these drugs gave me a buzz
Dope dealers showin' love
Bitch, I came up out the dope game
Ain't a damn thing changed, kept it real from day one
Kill a motherfucker if the day ever come
Keep the chopper with the drum
Hit you with the baseline
While I'm yellin', "Redrum, nigga"
Get the fuck up off my dick, that's a girl's job
What you about that crack, boy?
Drop it in the pot, then I whip it with the ice
Bet it's comin' right back, boy
Eatin' good over here, if I ever go hungry
I will rob you like a jackboy
Try to run up on my team
Well, say hello to nina
Leave your brains on your lap, boy

Got your girl on my dick cause she know I'm 'bout to blow (Blow)
Blow, blow, blow, blow, blow
Got these hustlers yellin' bricks cause they know I'm 'bout to blow (Blow)

Cocaine on my clothes cause I'm whippin' up the blow (Blow)
Blow, blow, blow, blow, blow
Put some yay up in her nose then I tell that bitch to blow (Blow)
Blow, blow, blow, blow, blow

Tell a bitch to get down, drop it to the floor
Tell a bitch to sit down, stop actin' like a groupie
Know you do lights, camera, action
Like we 'bout to film a movie
Circle full of winners cause you know we never loosin'
Spittin' like a Uzi
Shoot anything that's movin'
Don't step in my direction
I don't need a bodyguard, I keep a chopper for pretection
I got my plugs and my connections
So don't play with me, bruh
Hit you with a hundred rounds
So don't play with me, bruh
Bitch, you burnin' up the town
I got the yay by the boatload
Cocaine by the bandos
Tryna run a touchdown in my city
I'll make you niggas fumble
