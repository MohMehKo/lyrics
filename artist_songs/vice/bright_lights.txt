I can go for miles and not run out of steam
I can do my thing, I can make you believe
Got me out here living, yes I'm living my dreams
I do sound crazy but follow me ah

Walking like a boss, talking bright lights
Talking like a boss, talking bright lights
Walking like a boss, talking bright lights
Talking like a boss, talking bright lights

Woah woah
Woah woah
Bright lights
Bright, bright, bright lights

Super natural style, you see I am the shit
Walking like a boss, I am nobody's bitch
Talking like it 'cause when you're rolling like this
Come follow me if you dare we goin'

Walking like a boss, talking bright lights
Talking like a boss, talking bright lights
Walking like a boss, talking bright lights
I wanna see my name in bright lights

Woah
Woah
Bright lights
Woah woah
Bright lights

Hanging at the top with me
You must have come on up me
Gave it all you got with me
Don't need plenty friends with me
Cause I know we got chemistry
And we gon' move electrically

You wanna see your name in
I wanna see my name in
We wanna see our name in
Bright lights, baby, bright lights, baby
If you wanna see my name in
You gon' see your name in
We gonna see our names in
Bright lights, baby, bright lights, baby

Woah
Bright lights
Bright lights
Woah woah
Bright lights
Bright, bright, bright lights
Woah woah
On top of the world I see
Bright lights
Woah woah
On top of the world I see
Bright lights
Woah woah
On top of the world I see
Bright lights
Woah woah
On top of the world I see
Bright lights
Woah woah
