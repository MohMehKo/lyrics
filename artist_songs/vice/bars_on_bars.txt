Bars on bars on bars on bars (Vice)
This is how I do, bitch (FNF)
I can't find the verse in my phone (Whoa)
Fuck it, let's get it

You can feel the essence of the spirit in your presence
When I step up in your presence, I'm a wrap 'em up like presents
I'm in love with these strippers, it's a shame that I finesse 'em
I done took 'em for they money but I had to go and get it
We be strappin' automatics, boy, you know I'm Illmattic
So ill when I deal I ain't never stop sellin', boy, you know I'm still at it
Sellin' work to these addicts, stayin' higher than an addict
Then I pop me a brick and I get low like a basement
You know we sellin' all that base, bitch
Free freebase for them base heads
New face, took a bitch and I replace her
Then erase 'em like erasers
I be racin' like a racer
Bitch, I'm ballin' like a peso
You don't know about the paper
You a motherfuckin' hater
I done seen my mama cry, lotta tears from her eyes
But my daddy used to lie and I know he used to beat her
So I call him Tiger Woods cause I know that he a cheater
I be jumpin' in the Cooper, speedin' off like I'm a cheetah
Earned a lotta stripes and I ain't talkin' 'bout Adidas
If you actin' like a hot head, I'll pop lead (Bang)
Cool you off like a freezer, boy, you know I keep the heater
They be askin' why I'm sellin' then convict me as a felon
Now I can't get a job, I'll be damned if I'm tellin'
I'd rather move coke, I don't like to sell weed
Cause them pounds, you can smell 'em
Two Glocks in the stash spot
I hit 'em with the pressure, they be foldin' like a laptop
The bando be boomin' and I'll be trappin' at the crack spot
Crackhead play the banjo, that's a signal for the traps, ha
I must be a muslim, I ain't fuckin' with the pigs and I ain't talkin' to no damn cops
Reminiscin' 'bout the times when and my homies used to play up in the sand box
Now we got a little older and we started sellin' boulders, we be trappin' by the sand box
Here's a shout-out to my mama, give a fuck about my father, I don't care about my damn pops
I don't even need a hook, [?] with the flow
Bars on top of bars, I keep hoes on top of hoes
I don't even need a hook, [?] with the flow
I give you bars on top of bars
My nausea really bad, I think I need to pop a bar

Haha, yeah, you know? Just had to give you one of 'em straight throughs where I go straight through, ain't no curves over here, only curve we got over here's when bitches get curved, tell the bitch to swerve, you know? I keep it G, nigga
