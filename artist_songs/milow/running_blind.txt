You always take me back, don't know if I do the same
It was dark upon 'til your light showed me the way

I try, try running but I flew right into you
It's like I've been living with closed down eyes

Why was I running blind with you here?
The whole time running blind with you here
The whole time, open my eyes

You always make me in more than I'm ready for
You hit me up until my own mind blows me away

I try, try running but I flew right into you
It's like I've been living with closed down eyes

Why was I running blind with you here?
The whole time running blind for a long time with you here
The whole time, open my eyes

Open my eyes
Open my eyes
Open my eyes

Why was I running blind with you here?
The whole time running blind for a long time with you here
The whole time with you, with you
For a long time with you, with you
For a long time with you, with you
With you, with you
