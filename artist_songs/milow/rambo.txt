When I was little I wanted to be king
I built castles in the air but never found my way in
For a week I was Rambo but couldn't take the pace
Then I thought I'd be a rocket man
But never made it into space
All my life I tried so many things I couldn't do
But I can't think of anything I wouldn't try again
Try again for you

I worked to be a wizard I tried it for a year
I had five white rabbits but not one would disappear
I dreamed of being a fireman but that went up in flames
Said okay I'll be a cowboy
But it turned out I'm no Jesse James
All my life I tried so many things I couldn't do
But I can't think of anything I wouldn't try again
Try again for you

I played guitar in a band and finally got laid
Then we fell apart as soon as bills needed to be paid
Got a job in a restaurant where I burned every dish
Was a sidewalk Santa Claus
But I couldn't grant one single wish

I set off to see the world it finally felt right
But I got lost the second day
Sso I went home the following night
All my life I tried too many things I couldn't do
But I can't think of anything I wouldn't try again try again
No I can't think of anything I wouldn't try again try again
Again and again and again and again for you
