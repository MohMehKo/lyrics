Where did the summer go?
I found it in Monaco, dancing in Mexico, sushi in Tokyo
I wanna be where you are, driving a classic car
Cuba is not so far, I can bring my guitar

Baby, are we there yet?
Meet me at the sunset
Summer will be over soon
I'll see you when you get there
But until we get there
We'll be howling at the moon
Baby, are we there yet?
Meet me at the sunset
Summer will be over soon
I see you and you'll get there
But until we get there
We'll be howling at the moon

Awoooh
Howling at the moon
Awoooh
Howling at the moon

Where is de summertime?
Take me back to Hawaii, skyscrapers in Dubai, palaces in Versailles
So want you fight with me? Eat dinner in Sicily?
Be who you wanna be, right where you wanna be

Baby, are we there yet?
Meet me at the sunset
Summer will be over soon
I'll see you when you get there
But until we get there
We'll be howling at the moon
Baby, are we there yet?
Meet me at the sunset
Summer will be over soon
I see you and you'll get there
But until we get there
We'll be howling at the moon
Baby, are we there yet?
Meet me at the sunset
Summer will be over soon
I'll see you when you get there
But until we get there
We'll be howling at the moon

Awoooh
Howling at the moon
Awoooh
Howling at the moon
Howling at the moon
Awoooh
Howling at the moon
