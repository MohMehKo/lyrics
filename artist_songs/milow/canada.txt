I'm gonna move to Canada
Yeah I've made up my mind
Leave everything behind
I'll catch a plane, fly away from this rain

I'm gonna move to Canada
I'm gonna meet Neil Young
I just know we'll get along
Show up at his house
Convince him and his spouse
I'll pick up my guitar and play
A couple of my songs
A couple of my songs
A couple of my songs
That I'll sing at the top of my lungs

I'm gonna move to Canada
Yeah I've made up my mind
Leave everything behind
I'll catch a plane, fly away from this rain

Mister Young will be impressed
And offer me a record deal
And tell me to call him Neil
We'll have a ball until Canada's too small
Then I'll pack up my guitar and I
Will move to the US
I'll move to the US
I'll move to the US
To be a sensational succes

I'm gonna move to Canada
Yeah I've made up my mind
Leave everything behind
I'll catch a plane, fly away from this rain

After Canada the USA is a piece of cake
All the sales records I'll break
"The Best Thing Since The Beatles"
Is what magazines will write
With my guitar and band
I will conquer every town
I'll conquer every town
I'll conquer every town
Me, the singing rock'n roll clown

I still wanna move to Canada
But for now I'll just stay here
I think it's best for my career
When I get home from the office
Where I've worked all my life
I pick up my guitar and play
A couple of my old songs
A couple of my old songs
A couple of my old songs
And I think: "Damn"
"Neil Young would have loved these songs,
He would have loved these songs"

Maybe next year
Maybe next year
