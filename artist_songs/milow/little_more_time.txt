an eyelash on your cheek crashed down and broken
decided to leave so it jumped on a tear
since '94 you've been wanting to grow up
since '94 been trying to get out of here

I don't wanna find out whatever I needed
I'm way too afraid of what I could find
you're losing the thread while I'm losing my head
I wish that I will make up my mind

don't write me off
because I should try hard enough
I just need a little more time
don't write me off
because I haven't tried hard enough
I just need a little more time

the closer we get the more it looks like we've made it
I finally like this time of year
the closer you look we get less overrated
I hope that next week you'll still be here

an eyelash on your cheek crashed down and broken
decided to leave so it jumped on a tear
since '94 you've been wanting to grow up
but just like your eyelash you didn't get far
