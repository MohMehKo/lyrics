She's too blue-eyed possibly
Then again she couldn't be
One two she knows kung fu
Three four kicked in my door

One two she just cut through
Three four what an uproar
Five six she pulls me out
And throws me to the wind

Her eyes are shining like a midnight sun
Oh the countdown has begun
Five four three two one
