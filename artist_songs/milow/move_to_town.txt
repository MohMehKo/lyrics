Here in the city the measure is frozen
Billboards are screaming nothing is real
In every small town there's air you can breathe in
It's not about the money or fast food on wheels

The lights are too bright for my eyes
Inside there's a feeling that rings like a bell
I've had enough and I long for the silence
This place hasn't treated me well

I have decided to leave this city
These buildings and people bring me down
I have decided to leave this city
I think that I'm gonna move to town

Here in the city no one's connected
Careers are controlling everyone’s lives
In every small town there's barely possession
Mothers aren't burdens or grandfathers' wives

I won't make a sound
I won’t follow this merry-go-around
That keeps going round with or without
Me I'm leaving I'm leaving I'm leaving

Tomorrow I'll make my way out of the city
Tomorrow I'll hop on a train or a bus
I'll never stop running away from cities
Where girls don't leave husbands for boys like us
