We live in the city of a thousand lights
Stars collide with satellites
We take the dark out of the night
In one of those places, strangers meet
Will I find you, will you find me?
The odds can change so suddenly

Well maybe tonight's on your side
You're wide eyed looking at these bright lights shine on you
Well maybe tonight's on your side
You're wide eyed looking at these bright lights shine on you

Lonely one, lonely one, lonely one
Whatever it is you've done
You're not the only one
Lonely one, lonely one, lonely one
You're not the only one
Only one, lonely one

We live in a hundred different lives
Whatever it takes just to survive
Keeping each other hypnotized
All of the faces on the street
Will I find you, will you find me?
Live can change so suddenly

Well maybe tonight's on your side
We're wide eyed looking at these bright lights shine on you

Lonely one, lonely one, lonely one
Whatever it is you've done
You're not the only one
Lonely one, lonely one, lonely one
You're not the only one
Only one, lonely one

Lonely one, lonely one, lonely one
Whatever it is you've done
You're not the only one
Lonely one, lonely one, lonely one
You're not the only one
Only one
Lonely one, lonely one, lonely one
Whatever it is you've done
You're not the only one
Lonely one, lonely one, lonely one
You're not the only one
The lonely one
The lonely one
