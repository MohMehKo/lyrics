If you ever lost your philosophy
Water's rising up from the sand
You just Keep on drifting away from land
If you ever lost your horizon
You can't even find the sun
And you just keep on staring until the damage is done

Out of time out of fight
Tracing circles that don't feel right
Out of time out of fight
At least we know that at least we tried
At least we tried
We're swimming against the tide

If you're ever lost on a tightrope
Running on the tip of your toes
You keep on getting higher but never cole
And if you're ever lost in the darkness
You don't know where to begin
You Need to change you wanna live again

The only time you're really lost
Is when you're standing still at any cost

Night and day day and night
At least we know that at least we tried
At least we tried
We're swimming against the tide
