I like to read stories from the bottom of the world
Although they've all been told before
You wanna stay 25 for a couple more years
But be careful with what you're wishing for

Because in a minute it might be gone, gone, gone

I like to watch stories from the bottom of the world
Because they're truly prefunded
Is adolscence now decades long
You would think so by looking around

In a minute, it might be gone
Falling down, shaking it's letting go
Launching ships, all the time
Falling down, shaking it's letting go
Launching ships, all the time, all the time

I like to tell stories from the bottom of the world
Don't care that it's been done before
Just remind yourself that you should try
To care less and sunbathe more

Because in a minute it might be gone
Falling down, shaking it's letting go
Launching ships, all the time
Falling down, shaking it's letting go
Launching ships, all the time, all the time

In a minute it might be gone
