sometimes everything seems awkward and large
imagine a Wednesday evening in March
future and past at the same time
I make use of the night and start drinking a lot
although not ideal for now it's all that I've got
it's nice to know your name

You don't know you don't know
you don't know anything bout' me

an ocean a lake I need a place to drown
let's freeze the moment because we're going down
tomorrow you'll be gone, gone, gone
you're laughing too hard this all seems surreal
I feel peculiar now what do you feel
do you think there's a chance that we can fall

you don't know you don't know
you don't know anything about me
what do I know I know your name
you don't know you don't know
you don't know anything about me anymore

I gave up dreaming for a while
I gave up dreaming for a while

I've noticed these are mysterious days
I look at it like a jigsaw puzzle and gaze
with wide open mouth and burning eyes
if only I could start to care
my dreams and my Wednesdays ain't going nowhere
baby baby baby you don't know 

you don't know you don't know
you don't know anything about me
what do I know I know your name
you don't know you don't know
you don't know anything about me
