She was a friend of a friend of mine
I noticed her as she passed me by
She didn't even look me in the eye
I tried to think of things to say
Poured some wine, but she looked away
I didn't even talk to her that night

For a while, I thought I stood a chance
When she smiled so sweet
For a while, I thought I'd figured her out
That we were meant to be

But she said, "No, no, no"
She just said, "No, no"
She said, "No, no, no"

People put me in my place
I felt the door slam in my face
Spent a long time standing in the rain
I've been on the losing end
All my dreams seemed just pretend
Once or twice thought, I would go insane

For a while, I swore I stood a chance
But I was back on my feet
For a while, I had figured it out
That it was meant to be

But they said, "No, no, no"
They just said, "No, no"
They said "No, no, no"
No, they said, "No, no, no"
They just said, "No, no"
They said, "No, no, no"

No, no, no
No, no, no
No, no, no
No, no, no

Funny how your worst mistake
Can lead you to your lucky break
It only made me who I am today

All the while, always stood a chance
I was asleep on my two feet
Took a while to figure it out
To see the forest 'fore the trees

And now I know, know, know
And now I know
And now I know, know, know
And now I know, know, know
And now I know
And now I know, know, know
No, no, no
And now I know, know, know
And now I know
No, no, no
No, no, no
And now I know, know, know
And now I know
No, no, no
