It just started raining, your grandkids are playing
We're waiting, we'll be eating soon
The woodstove is burning, my typewriter's learning
The only thing missing is you

I couldn't say so I set down to write it instead
I'm afraid, if you stay away I might forget
You're still alive in my head

I'm thinking about buying an old house
I'm trying to fix it but I could use some help
A home with a garden, they say it's a bargain
But I, I can't do it myself

I couldn't say so I set down to write it instead
I'm afraid, if you stay away I might forget
You're still alive in my head

And when will you arrive
I'll get in my car and drive to wherever you are
They call me on the phone
It's taking way too long, way too long

I couldn't say so I set down to write it instead
I'm afraid, if you stay away I might forget
So I set down to write it instead
I'm afraid, if you stay away I might forget
You're still alive in my head

I got two of my own, and a third will be born
In november, you would be proud of me
So much has changed since you left
It feels strange, it's already 1983
