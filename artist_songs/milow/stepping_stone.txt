we should have a word together
I think you and I
we never should have slept together
never should have tried

we should have a word together
it's time you understand
that I think the situation
is getting out of hand

like a stepping stone a breaking bone
the moves we make alone
still we pretend nothing's wrong at all
you have changed I have changed
in a different way we changed
every step we take we're more alone

we should have a word together
I know that I said
that we were meant to be together
I wish I never had

we should have a word together
it's time we break our fall
because trying isn't always better
than not trying at all
