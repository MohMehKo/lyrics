If I had a way to get out of this day
If I had a way I'd get out today
Man, I would run away, man, I would run
Cause these walls block out the sun
Yeah they block out the sun

Today I've got nothing to lose
I could go wherever I wanted to
Leave, jump onto the world

If I had a way to get out of this deal
If I had a way I'd break the deal
I'm gonna grab the wheel, and man, I will drive
5000 miles just to survive, 5000 miles

Today I've got nothing to lose
I could go wherever I wanted to
Leave, jump onto the world
As it's spinning 'round going down
Taking me along for the ride
For the ride

If I had a way I'd get out today
Man, I would run away
