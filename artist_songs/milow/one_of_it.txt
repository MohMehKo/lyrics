you came over
like a midnight appetite
nobody believes me now
I ran across and
saw a thousand people on my way
on my way on my way out

one of it, two of it
one of it, we'll make
the most of it
you'll love it

one of it, two of it
one of it, we'll make
the most of it
you'll love it

you left me out there
in the early morning rain
why would you believe me now
I'm only trying
to protect my point of view
I want you to let me in

one of it, two of it
one of it, we'll make
the most of it
you'll love it

one of it, two of it
one of it, we'll make
the most of it
you'll love it

and you'll try
to give me something to give me something
ooohhh
onto something we're onto something
ooohhh
let's try

one of it, two of it
one of it, we'll make
the most of it
you'll love it

one of it, two of it
one of it, we'll make
the most of it
you'll love it

can you count me in
can you count me in
