against the wall
looking like a princess down the hall
who is starting to want something so badly that it hurts
now she hopes it's not too late
she drinks a lot
and figures out she's everything he's not
she is starting to want something so badly that it hurts
and now she hopes it's not too late to start to play

they must find a new name for this sullen silver game

it's time to go
now that she knows more than she wants to know
she is starting to want something so badly that it hurts
and now she knows that it's too late to stay
change has never been a decision it just happens
she knows exactly what she's gonna do
