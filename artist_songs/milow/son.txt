Listen up and take a minute I need to tell you why
I do the things the way I do and weeks are flying by
I'm trying to fill a void in my life these days
By filling it with work and work
And accomplishments and praise
Anything that keeps me busy anything that keeps me up
Cause if I start to let it out I think I'm never gonna stop
Afraid I'm never gonna stop

Listen up and take a minute wherever you are
I've been mourning you with the bottle and with my guitar
For this song I sat myself down to put in words
What's underneath and what's unsaid
How much this whole thing hurts
How much this whole thing hurts

Listen up just take a minute I need to tell you why
I do the things the way I do so months are flying by
Since you're gone it isn't always easy all I do is run
But the hardest part the hardest part
Was growing up your son
Was growing up your son
