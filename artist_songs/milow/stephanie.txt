Stephanie always makes a lot of plans
She has decided, she has decided
She's gonna leave as soon as high school ends
In her house where no one ever cares
In her room in the attic, room in the attic
She wakes up to the sound of footsteps on the stairs

If it's true what they, what they say
Stephanie has gone away
If they're right, if they're right
Stephanie took off last night

Stephanie lives with a mother and son
Who can no longer hide it, no longer hide
Their hate for her, she is daddy's favourite one 
On an August night in 2004
At the end of the summer, the end of the summer
When they enter the room a baseball bat falls on the floor

If it's true what they, what they say
Stephanie has gone away
If they're right, if they're right
Stephanie took off last night

Do you know that Billy Joel song
It says: "Only the good die young"
If they're right, if they're right
Stephanie was killed last night

Stephanie always made a lot of plans
She had decided, she had decided
She was gonna leave as soon as high school ended
On that terrifying August night
Down by the river, down by the river
Is where Stephanie was left after she died

If it's true what they, what they say
Stephanie has gone away
If they're right, if they're right
Stephanie was killed last night
If they're right
Stephanie was killed last night

She never really wanted much
She never really had a chance
She never really wanted much
She never really had a chance
She never really wanted much
She never really had a chance
She never really wanted much
She never really had a chance

She never really wanted much
She never really had a chance
Never really wanted much
