I used to walk away too fast to keep the past behind me
Turned my back on my hometown, my friends and family
I know more than once or twice, I told myself a lie
I couldn't hide, even if I tried

It amazes me how you turn it around
Life can change just like that
Been blown away before but never like that
Don't look down, never look back
Our kind of love is easy like that
Love like that is easy

And you taught me to take my time, and how to take it slow
Where would I be without you now? I hope I'll never know
All I can say is that tonight, I've never felt more alive
I see everything with brand new eyes

It amazes me how you turn it all around
Life can change just like that
Been blown away before but never like that
Don't look down, never look back
Our kind of love is easy like that
Love like that, love like that
Love like, love like, love like that
Love like that is easy

I don't know why I make it hard when it's simple?
You just love who you love

Life can change just like that
Been blown away before but never like that
Don't look down, never look back
Our kind of love is easy like that
Love like that, love like that
Love like, love like, love like that
Love like that is easy
