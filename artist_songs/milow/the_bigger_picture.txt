again there's blood in your mouth
because you keep stumbling into walls
it seems like you got signed up
for a portion of trouble every week

look at this bloody mess
and take a good look at your heart
it shouldn't be bleeding for
him or for this fucked up world

I've got something to say
I've got something to say
things are not always as bad as they seem
no things are not always as bad as they seem
