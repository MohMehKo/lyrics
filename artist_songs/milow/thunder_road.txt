The screen door slams, Mary's dress waves
Like a vision she dances across the porch as the radio plays
Roy Orbison's singing for the lonely
Hey, that's me and I want you only
Don't turn me home again, I just can't face myself alone

Don't run back inside, darling, you know just what I'm here for
So you're scared and you're thinking that maybe we ain't that young anymore
Show a little faith, there's magic in the night
You ain't a beauty, but hey, you're alright
And that's alright with me

You can hide 'neath your covers and study your pain
Make crosses from your lover, throw roses in the rain
Waste your summer praying in vain
For a savior to rise from these streets

Yeah, well, I'm no hero, that's understood
All the redemption I can offer, girl, is beneath this dirty hood
With a chance to make it good somehow
What else can we do now?

Roll down the window and let the wind blow back your hair
Well, the night's bustin' open, these two lanes can take us anywhere
We got one last chance to make it real, to trade in these wings on some wheels
Climb in back, heaven's waiting down on the track

Oh-oh, come take my hand
Riding out tonight to case the promised land
Oh-oh-oh-oh, Thunder Road, oh, Thunder Road

Lying out there like a killer in the sun
It's late, we can make it if we run
Oh-oh-oh-oh, Thunder Road, sit tight
Take hold, Thunder Road

Well, I got this guitar and I learned how to make it talk
And my car's out back if you're ready to take that long walk
From your front porch to my front seat
Door's open, the ride, it ain't free

And in the lonely cool before dawn, they'll hear our engine roaring on
But when they'll get to the porch we'll be gone on the wind
So Mary climb in
It's a town full of losers, and I'm pulling out of here to win
