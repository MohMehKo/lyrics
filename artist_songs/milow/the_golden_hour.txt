You've spent all your life between the neon sun
Waiting for sunrise,
While you're hands are tied
Waiting for a sign to keep your head up high

You better take some lessons, on how to count addresses
If you wanna change
Now you're drowning in the whiskey sour
Always use it in the goldenhour [x2]
Night is shinnin' like pollution
Head is full of confusion, in the golden hour

You spend half the life waiting for the time
Try to get it right

[x2]
You better take some lessons, on how to count addresses
If you wanna change
Now you're drowning in the whiskey sour
Always use it in the goldenhour [x2]
Night is shinnin' like pollution
Head is full of confusion, in the golden hour
