I grew up in the 90's at least that's what I tried
looking for ways to be satisfied
I went to San Diego to try out my luck
came back 12 months later and again I was stuck
I felt like a goldfish stuck in a bowl
I was waiting for something that I could control
after 2000 no longer a kid
the world didn't end but something else did
when my father takes off I'm already 19
he wasn't as happy as I thought he seemed
if this is my screenplay I don't like my role
these are the things that you just can't control

although I feel a lot older I'm just 23
if you're looking for answers don't come to me
instead of a future I've got a guitar
but dreaming out loud won't get me far
still I feel I'm ready for rock'n roll
there might be something that I can control
by the time I hit 30 I'll have enough
of being a twentysomething in love
my friends will all be married or they will be gone
me, I'll still be wondering what's going on
if that's what it takes then I'll sell my soul
as long as there's something that I can control

one day I'll wake up and I'll be 38
doing the things I used to hate
the trick to forget the bigger picture is when
you look at everything in close-up as often as you can
our revolution is covered in mold
there's only so much you can control
this is no anthem because anthems are proud
and pride isn't something that this is about
I shouldn't care shouldn't care
but I do and that's sometimes too hard to bear
still walking the same road with my shoes full of holes
just waiting for something that we can control

if I ever reach 50 or 65
too early to tell if I'll still be alive
we were born in the 80's and now we are here
my generation's dream will disappear
I'm at a graveyard passing the rows
a silent surrender we'll never get close

this is my story you swallowed it whole
about us feeling the need to be in control
