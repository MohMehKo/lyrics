Only when you're in California
You drive along the coast
The towns you pass are often ruthless
They leave you chasing ghosts
Leave you chasing ghosts
I'm dreaming of blue skies
If I what if I close my eyes

I rush down the freeway
Slowly peeling back my brain
Fighting for patience
While moving to a faster lane
I'm trying to enjoy the California rain

Someone sang that when you're lonely
You end up back and forth
Tonight I'm leaving San Diego
I take the 5 up North
I'm chasing blue skies
I'm starting to blur the lines
