I'm from a town where nothing ever takes you by surprise
Perfect rows of pretty houses, roses, and white lies
I know that's why I pushed so hard just to get out of here
And looking back tonight, I see you crystal clear

Don't try deny me
I don't really wanna stay the same
Don't try deny me
I'm wanna get back, back in the fast lane
Back in the fast lane

I wanna live, I wanna cry
I don't wanna be afraid to try
I wanna bleed, I want the pain
I'm gonna get back, back in the fast lane
I'm gonna get back, back in the fast lane

My rearview mirror tells a story and the credits roll
I turn my collar up and turn my face towards the cold
Learn how to grow from mistakes to stop beating myself up
I learn when you fall down, stand up, just don't give up

Don't try deny me
I don't really need to stay the same
Don't try deny me
I'm gonna get back, back in the fast lane

I wanna live, I wanna cry
I don't wanna be afraid to try
I wanna bleed, I want the pain
I'm gonna get back, back in the fast lane
I'm gonna get back, back in the fast lane
Back in the fast lane

And I can't stay no more
It's slowing me down, down, down
Peddle to the floor
Faster than the speed of sound

I wanna live, I wanna cry
I don't wanna be afraid to try
I wanna bleed, I want the pain
I'm gonna get back, back in the fast lane
I'm gonna get back, back in the fast lane
Back in the fast lane
