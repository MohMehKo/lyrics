It took a while but now I see
My old man worked for the KGB
The government found out about
His work and had to take him out
It took a while but now I see
Why dad was such a mystery
Sometimes you cheat sometimes you lie
It’s part of the job when you’re a spy

It took a while but now I see
My old man worked for the KGB
The government found out about
His work and had to take him out
Sitting in the yard I didn’t understand
Holding his dead body in my hands
Now it’s getting clear to me
My dad he worked for the KGB

On the 4th of March in his backyard
A sniper shot him in the heart
He was only 53
But a hero for the KGB
A hero for the KGB
And a hero to me
