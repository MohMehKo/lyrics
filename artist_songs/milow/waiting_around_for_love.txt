Where's my love cause I don't know
Where my love got so cold?
"Yeah, I was there", first time I lied
That's what it says on the timeline

But we can change it
You and me are racing
Baby, I'll race ya
We can escape this together
And change our faith forever
You don't have to wait

You can do it now
Cause it's different now
And we're kissing now
I get it now
Instead of waiting around for love
You can do it now
Cause it's different now
Girl, we're kissing now
I get it now
Instead of waiting around for love

Yeah, my love, I'm still in love
What you'd think I'm in here for?
Last time I've lied that was the last
Seems like it all happens so fast

But we can change it
You and me are racing
Baby, I'll race ya
We can escape this forever
And find our faith together
You don't have to wait

You can do it now
Cause it's different now
And we're kissing now
I get it now
Instead of waiting around for love
You can do it now
Cause it's different now
Girl, we're kissing now
I get it now
Instead of waiting around for love

For love
For love
For love

You can do it now
Cause it's different now
And we're kissing now
I get it now
Instead of waiting around for love
You can do it now
Cause it's different now
Girl, we're kissing now
I get it now
Instead of waiting around for love (do it)
Instead of waiting around (do it)
Instead of waiting around for love (do it)
Instead of waiting around (do it)
Instead of waiting around
