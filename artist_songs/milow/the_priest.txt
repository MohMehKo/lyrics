I'm Peter van der Hold
I'm 68 years old
I doubt some questions have increased
In 42 years of being a priest
I'm at the end of my life
I'm not sure if I'm gonna survive
I often don't know what to say
When I talk to Him, when I pray
In reply I receive
Only silence, no relief
I've waited in vain for a little advice
from that great voice in the ethereal skies

Once I was revolutionary
A devoted mercenary
A gifted student in God's hands
Now I'm old and sick of his demands
I tried to be honest and good
Did my job the best I could
But I always stayed that average man
Right in the spot where I'll began
During the grief with which I've dealt
Spent three decades since I've felt
The certainty I so have thought 'bout the existence of the Lord

I've seen enough, that's why I know
God left this place, long long time ago

I'll give him to my perish
Things I don't have myself but cherish
And namely love and charity
Mostly purpose that's what sets you free
So I'm where the metaphore
I'm not comforting anymore
I think I'm almost done with my search
Got old so fast even in my church
But feels as if I'm kept out
Some sort of secret about
The meaning of life sometimes
Can't fail to notice these are mediocre types

I've seen enough, that's why I know
God left this place, long long time ago
I've seen enough, that's why I know
God left this place, long long time ago

And time has made me good at one thing
And horrible at everything else
The blessings of a world divine
Were always elsewhere and never mine
Oh, I would like to hold someone
Briefly maybe have some fun
My body's hardly designed
So I'm not really the hugging kind
Not once has it been
Someone with a softer skin
Who reached out for me in the middle of the night
'Cause my own lumpy mattress would've turn on the light
I think I've been miscast
And the time of saints is passed
My faith is reclassed but not least
After 42 years of being a priest
The church is like a woman
Thing out of reach like a vision
She glimmers in the distance which I could never quite get
Now I've left you with my regret

I've seen enough, that's why I know
God left this place, long long time ago
I've seen enough, that's why I know
God left this place, long long time ago

I've seen enough, that's why I know
God left this place, long long time ago
I've seen enough, that's why I know
God left this place, long long time ago

It's my portion, it's my call...
It's my portion, it's my call...
