In this age of eternal night
The blind are leading us to the light
As we stumble in the dark
The creatures climbing aboard the Ark
It's gonna be a crazy ride
Not everyone will get out alive

Don't you wanna know (if you're gonna make it)
Will you be left behind (will you be forsaken)
Maybe you don't care (maybe I'm mistaken)

We watched it all from the highest hill
That bloody beast move for the kill
The money changers the chiefs of staff
Melted down the golden calf
And now they say they've spent it all
And now on you and me they call
Last night my mind was on my side
Today the river is too wide

Don't you wanna know (if you're gonna make it)
Will you be left behind (will you be forsaken)
Maybe you don't care (maybe I'm mistaken)

Sometimes I have no hope at all
Sometimes I see over the wall
There's a sun rising again
I see the storm that's blowing in

Don't you wanna know (if you're gonna make it)
Will you be left behind (will you be forsaken)
Maybe you don't care (maybe I'm mistaken)

Don't you wanna know (if you're gonna make it)
Will you be left behind (will you be forsaken)
Maybe you don't care (maybe I'm mistaken)

Dadadadada....

(Maybe I'm mistaken, maybe I'm mistaken
maybe I'm mistaken, maybe I'm mistaken)
