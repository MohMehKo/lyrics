A weeks too long, not to ring
Re-colours her hair, and waits for him
Not cat against dog, just head over heels
Sex twice a day, best time in years
Oh no, why hasn't he phoned?
She has to wait until he's on his own
Lying and Denying so nobody knows
I'll tell her this week is what he tells
Her to keep her on loan
He'll buy her one day

Sex drives, oral highs, cheating wife's spouse
Cream cakes, coffee dates, floral gifts, goodbye
Pass the way for the day had a change of kind
Sex change, to mundane for the average mind
Oh no, she just can't see
Where he is and where he's been
Looked prim and straight
Like she's always been

All that she saved for went missing again
She could be, she could be, she could be wrong
She could be, she could be, she could be wrong
She could be, she could be, she could be wrong
It looks like, it looks like, it looks like the worlds gone wrong

They found a body in the lake
maybe it wasn't really his name
Same colour, same weight, same size feet
It's the not knowing that kills you
Oh no the clocks stopped slow, everytime you're on your own
ya' hide from the spies so nobody knows
Scratch through the pages on the lazy days news for a clue
Still looking for you
