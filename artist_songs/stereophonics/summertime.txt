Summertime and the living is easy
Fish are jumping, the cotton is high
Your daddy's rich and your mother's good lookin'
So hush, little baby, don't you cry?

One of these mornings you're gonna rise up singing
You're gonna spread your wings and reach for the sky
But until that mornin' you're gonna wind up singin'
And mommy and daddy are standin' by.
