I know your time
Is on your mind,
Since I'm away
I heard a cry,
Yes, you've been caught
Caught cheating on me.

I know your kind
You get around
But I give you
All of my time,
Yes, you've been caught
Caught cheating on me.

Now I love you
Like the way I'm meant to do,
Yes, I love you
Like the way I'm meant to do
But you've been caught
Caught cheating on me.

I know you lie
Down the line,
When I get back
You look in my eye
Yes you've been caught
Caught cheating on me.

Yes you've been caught
Caught cheating on me.

But I love you
Like the way I'm meant to do,
Yes I love you
Like the way I'm meant to do,
But you've been caught
Caught cheating on me.
