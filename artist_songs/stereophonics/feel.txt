Here it comes again
Like the first time again
I cant sleep
I watch the rain
But im happy again
How can this be
Why did this feeling
Creep on up on me

I cant be sure
You never can
But the signs i know
Where does it come from
Where does it go
Why does it kill you
Painful and slow
Im out of the fire
Im into your home

I wanna feel you feel you feel you
Feel you again

It makes you a cheat
It makes you a liar
Step out of the fire
It gives a spring in the step
Smile on the face
Sing like a bird
Ya running the race again
What makes you bad
Makes you feel much better
Than you ever can

You cant touch it see it breathe it
Feel its all you can

It makes the world go round
It makes you homeward bound
It makes you want it more
You look around every corner
To see if theres more around

You wanna take it all its never quite enough
You know ya need it all

You wanna feel it feel it feel it feel it again

It'll kill you in the end
But not to have it
You havent lived
It will break you
Make you
Take you
Hate you again
From me to you
From you to me
Look out your window
And you will feel it feel it feel it feel it more

Here it comes again
That feeling again
I cant sleep
Sit and watch the rain
Again watch the rain
Again
