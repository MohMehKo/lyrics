The day is dawning in the rainy park
Trees around, some falling down
It's ok, I don't mind
You can take your clothes and run

Falling over, spinning round
Orange leaves spread on the ground
Sleep in the day
Swim in the night
Light your fires
It could be tragic, today

Take me
Here
Take me
Here

Bowled me over from the start
Poison arrow through the heart
I'll undress you
You'll undress me
The place is dark
No one can see

Lay me down on the grassy ground
Stars aligned for miles around
I don't know you
You don't know me
Who's to know what will be, today?

Take me
Here
Take me
Here
Take me
Here
Take me
Here
