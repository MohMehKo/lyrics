When will those clouds all disappear? 
Angie Angie 
Where will it lead us from here? 
With no loving in our soul and no money in our coats 
Well you can't say we're satisfied 
Angie Angie 
Well, you can't say we never tried 

Angie beautiful but ain't it time we said goodbye? 
Angie I still love you 
Remember all those nights we cried? 

All the dreams we held so close 
Seemed to all go up in smoke 
Well, let me whisper in your ear 
Angie, Angie 
Where will it lead us from here? 
Oh Angie don't you weep 
All your kisses still taste sweet 
I hate that sadness in your eyes 
Angie Angie 
Ain't it time we said goodbye? 

With no loving in our soul and no money in our coats 
You can't say we're satisfied 
But Angie 
I still love you baby 
Ev'rywhere I look I see your eyes 
There ain't a woman that comes close to you 
So come on baby dry your eyes 
Angie Angie 
Ain't it good to be alive? 
Angie Angie 
They can't say we never tried
