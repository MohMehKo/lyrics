You fly with angel's wings
You've got my blood in your veins
And your eyes see everything
And they shine like diamond rings

You're my Sunday, make my Monday come alive
Just like Tuesday you're a new day, wakes me up
Wednesday's raining, Thursday's yearning, Friday nights
Then it all ends at the weekend, you're my star

Sometimes, I cave right in ('Times I cave right in)
But this fight you have to win (This time we have to win)
And your songs you love to sing
May your dreams forever live

You're my Sunday, make my Monday come alive
Just like Tuesday you're a new day, wakes me up
Wednesday's raining, Thursday's yearning, Friday nights
Then it all ends at the weekend, you're my star

You're my star, yes you are
It's a thrill to see your imagination
Just watching you is an education
What's in your mind is my fascination
It blows my mind it sets my heart to racing

You're my Sunday, make my Monday come alive
Just like Tuesday you're a new day, wakes me up
Wednesday's raining, Thursday's yearning, Friday nights
Then it all ends at the weekend, you're my star
