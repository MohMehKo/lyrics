You stole my money honey
You're cold your blood's stopped running
And know you're buying your new life
Can't help but find you funny
The clothes you wear are something
You made your whole life boasting lies

Pretend you're high and something
To think, you think I'm dumb, you're blind!

I'll get by fine without you
I lie about you
You got no spine only mine
Don't you know wrong from right

It's up to you
You're such a fool

See I'm a giver, taker!
You liked your cocaine chaser
The girls you love all sleep around
You got a piece of something
But what it's worth is nothing
Coz what you want you just can't buy

Pretend you're high on something
To think you think I'm dumb, you're blind

I'll get by fine without you
I lie about you
You got no spine only mine
Don't you know wrong from right
You got no style about you
I try to like you
I got no time for you now
Cos your time's running out

It's up to you
You're such a fool

I'll get by fine without you
I lie about you
You got no spine only mine
Don't you know wrong from right
You got no style about you
I try to like you
I got no time for you now
Cos your time's running out

It's up to you
It's up to you
Such a fool
It's up to you
