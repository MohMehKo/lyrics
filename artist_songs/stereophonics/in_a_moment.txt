Don’t know where you’re going
Used to be a star
And everywhere you turn
They’re raining on your fire
You’re searching for an answer
Your hands and tongue are tied
And everything that you thought you knew
Is buried deep alive

You could take tomorrow
If you wanna
You should take tomorrow
But you gotta wanna

You think you got it all
Writings on the wall
Praying to your lord
Searching for your soul
Cause you just need to know
The emptiness will go
In a moment

Looking in the mirror
I’m talking to myself
Stare at my reflection
And I look like someone else
I ask myself a question
Can I face another day?
So I look myself right in the eyes
And I tell myself again

You could take tomorrow
If you wanna
You should take tomorrow
But you gotta wanna

(All your love within the moment)

You think you got it all
Writings on the wall
Praying to your lord
Searching for your soul
Cause you just need to know
The emptiness will go
In a moment

You think you’re gonna fall
Afraid you’ll lose it all
You’re praying to your God
Thank him for your love
And you just need to know
Hope is gonna flow
In a moment

Boy, time is on your side
Time will heal your mind
Then you’ll learn to fly high
