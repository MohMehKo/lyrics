I heard you're doing well 
Selling art and everything 
I like you're stuff; good for you 
I'll buy a piece or maybe two 

Do you ever think of me? 
Do you remember all our stupid dreams? 
Rainbows and pots of gold 
So much to prove before we got old 

I took you places round the world 
I miss you're face sometimes you know 
You took my picture a thousand times 
I bought them back; I don't mind 

I lost my way but found my track 
I'm sorry if I never listened back 
I've been round; I've been up and down 
And you missed the one we dressed like clowns 

And how's your car and how's your life? 
How's my friend; when's she gonna be your wife? 
I'm sitting up writing down 
These things I sometimes dream about 

I knew your number off by heart 
It's the only one I like to talk 
It wasn't me using you 
I trusted you; one of the few 

And we had some laughs; had some rows 
But in the end the walls came down 
You like the place I'm living now 
It's a shame you can't come around 

And I've grown a lot since we last spoke 
Got myself together; fixed what was broke 
I wonder if we'll talk again 
Or drink together just like then 

I suppose it's different now it's new 
Whoever points the finger at who 
I really hope you're happy both of you 
And maybe sometimes you miss me too
