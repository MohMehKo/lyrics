Let me in
Came in through the door
Right before my eyes
All this time
Had my picture on the wall

Saw my fears
And thought of all those days
And all my memories
Everyday
Through your eyes
Then you're gone

All my life
And I mean everyday
You were my everything
Everything
Then you choose
To turn your back on us all

And you won't live this life
And you won't leave these scars

Common tell me did you feel it
Common tell me did you need me
Common why did you leave me
Oh no

Common tell me did you feel it
Common tell me did you need me
Common why did you leave me
I've gotta know

Common tell me did you feel it
Common tell me did you need me
Common why did you leave me
I've gotta know
