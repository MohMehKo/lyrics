I don't know where you are or what you wanna do 
It seems so these days I'm losing out on you 
You come home so late, I don't know where you been 
I wanna hold you tight but you make me wanna scream 

Oh, so now we're fighting in the streets
I can't breathe cos I don't believe what you say 
No, your white lies don't protect me 
Be honest with me, it's all we can be to sustain 

I drove around all morning,
Thinking of starting again 
Turning my back on a good thing
I turned the car round instead 

No, your white lies don't protect me 
Be honest with me, it's all we can be to sustain 
Oh so no more fighting in the streets 
I can't breathe, cos I don't believe what you say 

No, your white lies don't protect me 
Be honest with me, it's all we can be to sustain 
Oh so no more fighting in the streets 
I can't breathe, if I don't see you again
