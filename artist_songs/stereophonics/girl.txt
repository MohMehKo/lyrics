I've seen the one to take my eye
She's my Sunday best
She'll blow my mind rob me blind
Then she'll take the rest
Another drink in ya sink
Down a drunken well
Chasing stars catching cars
To the moon again

Girl you got me going
Don't you wanna fly?
Girl you got me going
Don't you wanna fly?
Girl you got me going
Don't you wanna fly?
Girl you got me going
Don't you wanna fly?
High! Yeah yeah yeah

Mirror face to her place
Head's hazy mess
Falling down look a clown
Jekyll's out again
Feeling sick lunatic
Beat myself up well
Call the cars fuck the stars
Get me down from hell

Girl you got me going
Don't you wanna fly?
Girl you got me going
Don't you wanna fly?
Girl you got me going
Don't you wanna fly?
Girl you got me going
Don't you wanna fly?
High! Yeah yeah yeah
