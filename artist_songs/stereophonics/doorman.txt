Doorman you got an attitude
Ya like immigration in a cheaper suit
You'd like nothing more than to break my face
No rhyme no reason no colour or race

You'd like to throw me out on the street
It ain't my fault that you can't read
You look like a monkey scowling at me (ooh ooh aah aah)
Well suck my banana suck it with cream

'Cause all I wanna do
Is get closer to you
'Cause all I wanna do
Is make a mess out of you

Promotion for you is to stamp my wrist
If you're a good boy ya get the guest list
Ya don't listen don't think no mind of your own (yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Your job is prevention but you just provoke (yeah yeah)

'Cause all I wanna do
Is get closer to you
'Cause all I wanna do
Is make a mess out of you
Yeah eh yeah yeah

'Cause all I wanna do
Is get closer to you
'Cause all I wanna do
Is make a mess out of you
'Cause all I wanna do
Is get closer to you
'Cause all I wanna do
Is make a mess out of
You!
