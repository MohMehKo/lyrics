Maybe one thing
Maybe something
Maybe nothing
All I know is friend
It's nothing new

Maybe it's me
What is to be?
Maybe lucky
All I ask is where
We're s'posed to be

I give a lot
I take a lot
It's nothing new to me

Maybe you've grown
Am I so wrong
How long's too long
All I want is us to be happy

Maybe moving 
Always proving
Am I losing
All that's meant to be?
That's meant to be?

Ya hear a lot
Ya told a lot
It's nothing new to me

Maybe laughing
Something lacking
Always sometimes
All I hear is how, it's meant to be

Maybe learning
Always searching
Am I asking
Things I'll know too soon?
I'll know too soon

We talk a lot
Don't do a lot
It's nothing new to me

I give a lot
I take a lot

It's nothing new to me
It's nothing new to me
It's nothing new to me
