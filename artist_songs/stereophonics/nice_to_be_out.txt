He asked me 'So where have you been?' 
Let me think now let me see 
I was stood once where Hitler's feet stood 
When he made a speech in Nuremburg in '38 
When he tried to build the perfect race he said 
'Black men ain't gonna run along side our perfect sons' 

There's Dallas to the library 
The place they ended Kennedy 
I stood were Oswald took his shot 
In my opinion there's a bigger plot 
Cost less back into the left, the picket fence, the better bet 
Paris came and summer went 
The tunnels now a flower bed. 

The famous turf that made Geoff Hurst 
The vodka stops to quench my thirst 
The Golden Gate stroke Alcatrez 
The fat man failed to get us passed 
Is Jimmy's corner in 'Raging Bull' 
De Niro's jokes and bottle pills 
Elvis tales from Mr Wood. 
Would any Richard Burton if you could 

The tourists stare at tourist stops 
One more picture one more got 
Another a top up for a change 
it makes you think the same 
Talking more about yourself 
There's a mirror to have a check 
Checks are always passing through 
Some depart but a lot come too 

The restaurant talk of pick your teeth 
Bite your tongue oh chewy meat' 
Sleep or drink or drink to sleep 
One more week and we will meet 
We talk of what we haven't done 
Since we departed back a month 
We argue while we have to shout 
All in all it's nice to be out
