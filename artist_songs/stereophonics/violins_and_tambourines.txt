Looking out the window, staring at the road
Doesn't really matter, which way to go
Everything is changing, nothing ever seems,
To stay the same

Violins and Tambourines, n' candy canes and magazines
Preachers sermons on the streets
I killed a man but is life is cheap they say

Stopped on the way home, side of the road
met her at the drug store saving peoples souls
she offered me redemption, take a drink instead if thats ok

Violins and Tambourines, n' candy canes and magazines
Preachers sermons on the streets
I killed a man but is life is cheap they say

Violins and Tambourines, n' candy canes and magazines
Preachers sermons on the streets
I killed a man but is life is cheap

Violins and Tambourines n' children sing songs in the street
Innocence is under rated, knock me out I'll be sedated
Violins and Tambourines and how many drums in unity
Teach yourself romance or pay it, every time we meet you

wants to save me
she wants to save me
Can't she save me
Won't ya save me
Oh yeah
