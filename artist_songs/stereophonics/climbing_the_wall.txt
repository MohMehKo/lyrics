I'm just lying here
Thinking to myself again
I'm round the bend

I've been driving round 
Talking to myself again
Not making no sense

What makes you and
What makes me
What makes men lie
Through their teeth
And what makes ten-ton birds
Fly me across the sea

And who's to say, that if the sun went out today
That all the movie stars would drive their cars away
Fallen angels from their pay cheques on parade

What's going down?
What's going around?
I'm climbing the wall

I'm just standing here
Looking at myself again
I'm going blind

I'm just sitting here
Playing with myself again
It's turning me on

So what makes you and what makes me
What makes women lie through their teeth
And what makes ten-ton ships
Sail me across the sea

And who's to say, that if the sun went out today
That all the movie stars would drive their cars away
Fallen angels from their pay cheques on parade
What's going down?
What's going around?
I'm climbing the wall

So what makes you and what makes me
What makes people lie through their teeth
And what makes ten-ton trains
Rail me under the sea

And who's to say, that if the sun went out today
That all the movie stars would drive their cars away
Fallen angels from their pay cheques on parade
What's going down?
What's going around?
I'm climbing the wall
