Is it heaven or hell at dawn
you really go it up or your going down
do you say your prayers late at night
or do you save them for the desperate times

do you see the beauty of a rose, i doubt it
do you hear the children sing aloud, no
can you see the leaves change the colors out there
can you taste the water in your mouth

is it any wonder
is there any hope
100mph
yet the race just still runs slow
the race just still feels slow

do you believe in good will forever guide
does your devil take you to your other side
can karma kill you in your mind
do you plan to solve this one tonight
do you see the beauty in a rose, i doubt it
can you hear the children sing aloud

is it any wonder
is there any hope
100mph
yet the race just still runs slow
the race just still feels slow

were running out of time, my friends
your running out of time, oh yeah, oh yeah

is there any wonder
is there any hope
100mph
yet the race just still runs slow
the race just still feels slow
the race just still runs slow
the race just still feels slow
