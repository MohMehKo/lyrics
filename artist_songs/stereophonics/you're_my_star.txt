You fly with angels wings
You've got my blood in your veins
And your eyes see everything
And they shine like diamond rings

You're my Sunday, make my Monday come alive
Just like Tuesday, you're a new day, wakes me up
Wednesday's raining, Thursday's yearning Friday nights
Then it all ends at the weekend, you're my star

At times, I cave right in
(Times I cave right in)
But this fights, we have to win
(This time we have to win)

And your songs you love to sing
(La la la la la, la la la la)
May your dreams forever live
(La la la la la, la la la la)

You're my Sunday, make my Monday come alive
Just like Tuesday you're a new day, wakes me up
Wednesday's raining, Thursday's yearning Friday nights
Then it all ends at the weekend, you're my star
You're my star, yes you are

It's a thrill to see your imagination
Just watching you is an education
What's in your mind, is my fascination
It blows my mind, it set's my heart racing

You're my Sunday, make my Monday come alive
(You make me come alive)
Just like Tuesday you're a new day, wakes me up
(You make me come alive)
Wednesday's raining, Thursday's yearning Friday nights
(You make me come alive)
Then it all ends at the weekend, you're my star
