Gotta get in on the scene hun?
Voice activate machine
Got ya hair in a haircut
You gotta fill up the dream
You got ya finger on the pulse babe
You got your rock n roll on?
You wanna screw driver too now
I hear they're fun on

You got it all this side up
But you ain't got it down
Push the pedal now

Activate your sweet voice babe
Let your world come out
You get ya head off the chopping block
And get ya ouija board out
You got ya rubber on a pencil
In case you make a mistake
I hope you got it all down babe
I'd hate to think you're a fake

You got it all this side up
But you ain't got it down
Push the pedal now
You got it all this side up
But you ain't got it down
Push the pedal now
And push...

You got it all this side up
But you ain't got it down
Push the pedal now
You got it all this side up
But you ain't got it down
Push the pedal now
You got it all this side up
But you ain't got it down
Push the pedal now
You got it all this side up
But you ain't got it
Push
