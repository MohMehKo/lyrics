This is a story about 2 Lovers
Who went their seperate ways
Impassioned lovers wrestling as one
The Smooth Tip

Common sense may tell me that the ending will be blue
Listening to my friends all goes up in smoke
When I'm making love to you
No one knows how you do your thing.
I'm a puppet on a string
Cause still waters run deep and kisses never lie
And day light turns to darkness
Humming birds do fly
And if I loved you too much baby,
It really don't matter
Just do it, do it
Do it to me on the smooth tip
Can't nobody groove me like you do
Do it to me on the smooth tip
Cause I'm down for you
I just got caught up in a triangle my dear
Then you ran away from here
Steal my heart and then you rob me blind
But no one in the world is that fine
Cause violets are blue
And roses are red
And I forgave all of your short comings once in the bed
And even though you never touched my sensitivity
I've got to admit it
You did it to me on
The smooth tip smooth tip baby
Can't nobody groove me like you do
Do it to me on the smooth tip
Cause I'm down for you
Nice and easy so bitter sweetly
You did me on the smoothe tip-I was down for you
And even though I may not kiss
Those sweet sweet lips again
I'll never forget you did it to me on the smooth tip
Ooh child come here
And let me whisper something in your ear
Smooth - I am smooth as silk baby

[rap: Lady Levi]
De way the man rest he is like a smooth operator
Wicked inna bed make me run likkle fever
Hug me kiss me rub me all over
Killing me with caresses
Yes me long fi be your lover
Long long time una still de pon me mind
You come first rest of dem ah reverse
I see you and I want you
And I hope that you want me to
You have the sweetest grind it a blow fi me mind
You make me whine my line
In the park in the dark you can get my love anywhere
