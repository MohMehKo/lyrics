You know, baby
We go back a long way
But it hasn't always been easy
You know
I mean, you living on the east coast
And me living on the west coast
It's tearing me apart
We've got to stop meeting like this

Try to understand
When I say how much I care
It hurts me so inside each time we say goodbye
And it's so unfair

And I've cried, yes, I've cried
As I face my calendar
I mark red Xs off and with each tear that drops
Baby, it gets harder to bear

'Cause your love could send a rocket up to the moon
Your love hit me just like a lead balloon
So let's make a wish, seal it with a kiss, my baby
You know we've got to stop meeting like this

Try to understand
Our long-distance love affair
Has gotten out of hand, it's more than I can stand
Ooh... girl, this I swear

And it hurts, yes, it hurts
Baby, as I face my calendar
I mark red Xs off and with each tear that drops
Baby, it gets harder to bear

Your love could send a rocket up to the moon
Your love hit me just like a lead balloon
So let's make a wish, seal it with a kiss, my baby, yeah
You know we've got to stop meeting like this

Can you find a way to say goodbye
Without really saying goodbye
Can you make it easier on me
Can you stop these tears I cry
Baby, I can only try
Can you find a reason why
Love shouldn't die

I hear what you're saying
And my love will be waiting
I hear what you're saying
And my love will be here
After your other lovers fall
If you'll only stop meeting like this... baby

(You know we've got to stop, my love)
This hurting in our hearts, my love
(I've been blind) So blind (So blind)
Time after time

(You know we've got to stop it, baby)
(Woo... ooh... ooh... ooh... hoo...)

You know we've got to stop, my baby
I've been goin' crazy
Out of my mind
Time after time... yeah... hey... hey... baby
