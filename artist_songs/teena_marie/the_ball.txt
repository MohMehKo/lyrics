Tender I remember, how you loved to turn me on
Sweetly so completely, when you sang your sassy song
Did you have a lighthouse, Yes, I'm sure indeed you did
Where you used to take me, where the family jewels were hid

[Chorus:]
You said, "Can I, can I, may I, can I, take you to the ball"
Take me to the ball
You said, "Can I, can I, love you, can I, love you after all"
Take me to the ball

The ball, the ball, sang your sassy song, sing it
The ball, take me to the ball

There was sugar sweet as candy, there was sweetness on your lips
And you sang it in a love song, and confection surely drips
There was laughter and then after, when we could have danced all night
We got into one another, and I know you know that's right

[Chorus:]
You said, "Can I, can I, may I, can I, take you to the ball"
Take me to the ball
You said, "Can I, can I, love you, can I, love you after all"
Take me to the ball

I remember how we danced, when you were mine
How we played "the suite" romance and all was fine
How we always took the chance to be divine
Love was always happening, love was happening at the, the ball...

The ball was fine-all the time-trying to blow my mind, baby
Take me to the ball
When we danced-to the beat-of a different drummer, baby
Take me to the ball-play it

I remember how we danced, when you were mine
How we played "the suite" romance and all was fine
How we always took the chance to be divine
Love was always happening, love was happening at the, the ball...

The ball was fine-all the time-trying to blow my mind, baby
Take me to the ball
When we danced-to the beat-of a different drummer, baby
Take me to the ball-play it

[Chorus:]
You said, "Can I, can I, may I, can I, take you to the ball"
Take me to the ball
You said, "Can I, can I, love you, can I, love you after all"
Take me to the ball

You said

[Chorus]
