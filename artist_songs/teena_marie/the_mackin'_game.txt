What's my name
Say my name
(Lady to the T)
Ain't nothing but the macking game
What's my name
Say my name
(Lady to the T)
Ain't nothing but the macking game
All my macking women throw the left to the right, now
(Super fly)

Me and my girls
Throwing long hair and afros to the wind
We got a love jones, baby, kicking in
Just for you
True blue
Lights in the basement
Moaning, groaning, thuggish ruggish boning
So smooth silky and the youngblood's here
Come here, daddy
It's the pioneer group
Put the needle on the record
I've got things to do to you

So faded
All the pimps are down on me cause I want you

Don't let the feminine gestures
Make you believe I can't pimp this lecture
I'm what you call a mack professor
With volumes and macklapedias
To touch him and work her
My first word, serve
I want ice down your back, baby
To correct your posture
Cause you're much to fly, now
To walk around with your shoulders down
(What you mean?)
I want you to feel secure when I'm around
(Aw)
Now, that's macking
Oh, don't sleep
I gets down
Mack packing
This is how you tell
See how well I taught her
Ask about your four plays to dismiss being [? ]
I'm not hating
Just enhancing your game
Incense, candles, rose pedals in the bath water, man
And one important thing
A lioness ain't meant to be tamed
Now, baby, that's game

Jimmy's at the front door with his cousin, Greg
So I runs out the back door with my nickel bag
Up against the wall
Down the other side
Roller coaster... [? ]
No boredom on this ride
When the hunter game gets captured by the game
Ain't it a shame
I'm going to put him on the streets
I'm going to make him say my name
(Everything you needs to know bout macking, you gots to get from me)

What's my name
Say my name
Say my name
Ain't nothing but the macking game
What's my name
Say my name
(Lady to the T)
Rewrite the macking game
What's my name
Say my name
Say my name
Ain't nothing but the macking game
What's my name
Say my name
(Lady to the T)
Ain't nothing but the macking game
All my macking women throw the left to the right, now
($45 was big money)
(With platform shoes)

Back in the day
But I got mine
Righteous time
It surely wasn't easily, easy

I got to rewrite the macking game
And it ain't the same
Like it use to be
Back in the days
Following you in the rain
I've got a whole new strategy
Use you up
And drop you off where you have to be
And, no love
Don't take it as a tragedy
You're still the one I give the keys to my chastity
Hit you up and rub you down quite nastily
Have you calling my name
Coming right after me
You asked where did the love go
Hide and seek
We can find it on the down low
Watch me peak like an avalanche
Didn't you know
Erupt like a volcano
Watch my lava flow
I like it slow
Never in need to rush
As you pushing
I've got the Midas touch
The name is Lite
And I'm too wild to tame
Ripping down like an avalanche
With the macking game

Ripping down like an avalanche
Stings like a bee
Player, flossy floss
Baby, catch my papers
[? ]
Just because he wants to make love to me
Doesn't mean he loves me
He thinks that I don't know that he thinks I'm fine
He thinks I don't know that he wants to blow my mind
When the hunter gets captured by the game
Ain't it a shame
(Yeah, I got a whole new strategy)
I'm going to put him on the streets
I'm going to make him say my name

What's my name
Say my name
(What's my name)
Ain't nothing but the macking game
(Say my name)
What's my name
Say my name
Ain't nothing but the macking game
What's my name
Say my name
(Say my name)
(Say my name)
Ain't nothing but the macking game
What's my name
Say my name
(I'm going to rewrite the macking game)

Somebody get De De
She's out of control
(Ooooooo)
You want me to what
Sing in your ear
That's funny
[giggle]
Fire and desire
[giggle]
Yo, busta
Why don't you go get me something to eat
Then run by the DJ booth and tell them to play that song that I like
Yeah, you know the one
By Alicia Keys
Yeah
You know my name
