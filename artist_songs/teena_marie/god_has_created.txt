[Teena Marie:]
With a child's heart I have seen that dreams really do come true...

[Smokey Robinson:]
I love you,

[Teena Marie:]
God created you for me to love

I do believe that God above
Created you for me to love

[Smokey Robinson:]
He picked you out of all the rest
Because He knew I'd love you best

[Teena Marie:]
I had a heart so big and brave
I had a heart so brave and true

[Both:]
But now I give my heart to you

[Smokey Robinson:]
I love you

[Teena Marie:]
God created you for me to love

[Teena Marie:]
Take care of it

[Smokey Robinson:]
Take care baby

[Teena Marie:]
As I have done

[Both:]
For you have two and I have none...
