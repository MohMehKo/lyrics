EEEEEEE...

(You are under my power... the power of love)

[Verse 1:]
You say my kisses taste like magic
(What's up)
That's got to be the classic line
There's no no kisses now that I'm in love baby
'Cause that would really blow my mind
I'd pull a rabbit out my hat
Or cross a black cat's path to find you
And darling you can best believe
There's nothing up my sleeve but love

[Chorus:]
It must be magic
(It must be magic)
Must be magic
(It must be magic)
Got me under your spell baby
Must be magic
(It must be magic)
Whoa baby must be magic
(It must be magic)

[Bridge:]
Ooh you got me tilting
Just like a pinball machine
You working my love such a magical feeling
You got me tilting just like a pinball machine
And I love it love it love it

(It must be magic baby. Cause it feels so good)
(It must be magic baby. Cause it feels so good)

[Verse 2:]
You say you know I got the potion
(What's up)
No baby don't stop don't you dare
Latin, Houdini and Merlin the magicians
To you they never could compare
I see no long, balck, flowing cape
But yet, I can't escape those two eyes
(When I look in your eyes)
And we don't need no crystal ball
Cause we have said it all but love

[Chorus:]
It must be magic
(It must be magic)
It must be magic
Got me under your spell baby
Must be magic
Whoa baby must be magic
(It must be magic)
Ooh you got me tiltingt like a pinball machine
Workin my love such a magical feeling
You got me tilting just like a pinball machine
And I love it love it love it
I can't get enough of it of it no no no no
It must be magic
(It must be magic)
Whoa baby must be magic
(It must be magic)
I'm a fortune I can tell baby
(It must be magic)
Cause it feels so good to me
(It must be magic)
Got me love, got me lovin you
It must be magic cause it feels so good to me
It must be magic cause it feels so good to me
It must be magic got me love, got me lovin you...

[Singers:]
Teena went to wonderland the blood is getting thick
Never met the king and he taught her all the tricks
She feels the heat there's magic in her feet
Now she's movin always groovin to the funky beat

Under your spell, hoo it must be magic
What is it? What is it? [x2]

It must be magic cause it feels so good to me
It must be magic got me under your spell baby
It must be magic cause it feels so good to me
It must be magic I'm a fortune I can tell baby...
