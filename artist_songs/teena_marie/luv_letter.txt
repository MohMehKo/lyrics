Music is meant to inspire
To elevate you and to take you higher
Like the prophets spoke words to my soul
Letters of love like silver and gold

Sign myself to you forever
(Oooh oooh oooh, oooh oooh, oooh oooh)
Sign myself to you forever
(Oooh oooh oooh, oooh oooh, oooh oooh)

You came to my rescue baby and I'm a sign myself to you
Back it up for you, I'm a write that down for you
I know you've heard about me and what the people say is true
The way I mix my metaphors, the way I do just what I do

I'm a love letter baby
Sign myself to you
Sign myself to you baby
Just sign myself to you
I'm a love letter baby
Might just make you cry
Don't let my smoke get in your eyes

I ain't saying nothing baby, ain't been said before
If all in life is vanity, I'm gonna even up the score
This one's for my music, the pretty notes each melody
This one's for the many blessings living inside of me

I'm a love letter baby
Might just make you cry
Don't let my smoke get in your eyes
I'm a love letter baby
Put you right to sleep
Read it and weep baby
Read it and weep

Read my eyes baby, my eyes won't ever lie
Read my lips, my lips gonna want to testify
Read my heart, gonna cross my heart and hope to die
Read me I'm your love letter, might just make you cry

Signed, sealed, delivered
I'm yours baby, I'm yours baby
Signed, sealed, delivered
I'm yours baby, sincerely yours baby

It's going down so eloquently, I'm gonna set the mood sublime
Speak your name like perfume, give you all my love in time
With all sensitivity, how can I express to you
Call me artful when I dodge, spittin' good game to you

I'm a love letter baby
Make your fever rise
Don't let my smoke get in your eyes
Said I'm a love letter baby
Put you right to sleep
Just read it and weep baby
Just read it and weep

Said I'm a love letter baby
Sign myself to you
Sign myself to you baby
Just sign myself to you
I'm gonna sign myself to you baby
Just sign myself to you

Signed, sealed, delivered
I'm yours baby, I'm yours baby
Signed, sealed, delivered
I'm yours baby, sincerely yours baby

Sign myself to you forever
(Oooh oooh oooh, oooh oooh, oooh oooh)
Sign myself to you forever
(Oooh oooh oooh, oooh oooh, oooh oooh)

Please Mr Postman
Deliver me, deliver me, deliver me
Please Mr Postman
Deliver me, deliver me, deliver me

Sign myself to you forever
