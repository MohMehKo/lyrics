Oh, I love the rain
Beating on my window pane

I'll give you all my love
And keep nothing for myself
I'll sacrifice for you
And pay the price for love itself
Unconditional like a guy who takes the fall
Through the fire baby to the limit to the wall

Here I am can I be your fool
What you want 
Cause I'll get it for you
And I don't know what to do
Cause I'm so in love with you
All my empty pockets spend
Ride with you to the very end
Telling you I'm down and then I'd do it all again

That's the definition of down
Baby let's get down to Ground Zero
That's the definition of down
Damn I dig you baby and you know
You know yeah you know

Deep down will dig for you
And ask for nothing in return
I'll give you all my specials baby
And any time you need to burn 
I'll make it so organic daddy
Just like a stroll around the park
Get down like nice and easy
Like shadow boxing in the dark

Here I am can I be your fool
What you want 
Cause I'll get it for you
And I don't know what to do
Cause I'm so in love with you
All my empty pockets spend
Ride with you to the very end
Telling you I'm down and that I'd do it all again

That's the definition of down
Baby let's get down to Ground Zero
That's the definition of down
I'm bout to put it down baby you know
You know yeah you know
Baby you know, yeah, you know

Through the fire to the limit to the wall
Here I come every time you call
Like the autumn leaves that fall
Never hesitate to give my all

Through the fire to the limit to the wall
Here I come every time you call
Like the autumn leaves that fall
Never hesitate to give my all

Through the fire to the limit to the wall
Here I come every time you call
Never hesitate to give my all
Like the autumn leaves that fall
Through the fire to the limit to the wall
Never hesitate cuz that's my definition   

That's the definition of down, Of down
Baby lets get down to Ground Zero, Baby lets get down
That's the definition of down Get down
I'm bout to put it down baby you know, Baby and you know
That's the definition of down, That's the definition
Baby lets get down to Ground Zero, Baby lets get down down
