Am I dreaming, are you real
Can this be heaven that I feel
Raindrops falling down
Make the sweetest sound... sweetest sound
Now that I have you

Greet the morning with a smile
Feelings within me running wild
Gray clouds in the sky
My love cannot hide
Now I have you in my life

I'm feeling things I never felt before
Now that I have you
And nothing seems to matter anymore
Now that I have you

Gentle lover, angel child
Come let me hold you for a while
Love shines from your eyes
Such a sweet surprise
Now I have you in my life

I'm feelings that I never felt before
Now that I have you
And nothing seems to matter anymore
Now that I have you
