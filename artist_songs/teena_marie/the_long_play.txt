[Intro:]
Good evening
This W-H-E-V-N
My co-letters on the Love Program
Broadcasting to you from a heavenless station
I'm a make it hot, yes
It's a sexy situation
I'm dropping lyrics on you, lover
Underneath the covers
And what better way than to prologue the passion?
Baby it's the foreplay, make you mine for the asking
I'm giving 360 degrees of the Lady T smoothe
Tentalatting black ivory keys
Like JB, ain't that a groove?
Legendary Players
Got you loving me madly
As I'm walking out the door
You wanna meet my daddy
Curled up in a corner
Sucking your thumb
I'm giving you The Long Play
Turning you on
And uh

[Verse 1:]
Pillow from my lips like honey
Got you listening to me faithfully
Do my fannies just like easy money
Just like liquid cash, baby

I've been setting up shop, got you all in
Spilling like a drop top Benz and
Sexy jompy, blazin to the max
We're kissing racks like a cardiac

[Chorus:]
(Give me the long play)
Drop it on me baby, that's my song
(Give me the long play)
Put me on repeat and I go on mm mm
(Give me the long play)
Dial it in and we can go all night
(Give me the long play)
We won't stop until the morning light

[Verse 2:]
Turn the radio up and dig my flavor
It's going down like a quiet storm
I know your sweet spot and I can't even fade you anymore
You've been digging my cells like fine wine
Cruising all up and down my close line
All your treasures I'm about to explore
Mon Cherie, some wild amour

[Chorus:]
(Give me the long play)
Drop it on me baby, that's my song
(Give me the long play)
Put me on repeat and I go on
(Give me the long play)
'Cause we gon make it last forever
Don't wanna wait no more, just open up the door
And give me the long play

[Bridge:]
Darling
Just for me and my baby
'Cause it seems like a mighty long time and my love's coming down
May I introduce you to my little friend?
She's my secret weapon and
Hear me talkin baby, what I say?
I'm bout to put you on the long play
The long play, the long play

[Interlude:]
Uh daddy
(Give it to me daddy)
Things you do and I'm next to you
(On the long play)
On the long play

[Chorus:]
(Give me the long play)
'Cause we gon make it last forever
Don't wanna wait no more, just open up the door
And give me the long, give me the long, give me the long play

[Bridge:]
Darling
Just for me and my baby
'Cause it seems like a mighty long time and my love's coming down
May I introduce you to my little friend?
She's my secret weapon and
Hear me talkin baby, what I say?
I'm bout to put you on the long play
The long play, the long play

[Chorus:]
(Give me the long play)
Drop it on me baby, that's my song
(Give me the long play)
Put me on repeat and I go on
(Give me the long play)
'Cause we gon make it last forever
Don't wanna wait no more, just open up the door
And give me the long play
