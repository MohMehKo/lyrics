Everybody knows I've had my share of lovers baby
Let's let the record show
Some of them were rich and famous
But most of them were poor and shameless
Then came you and what was I supposed to do
When we're rolling around to a saxophone sound
Sassy slow
I like the way that you lfow deep inside
As we glide on a magic carpet ride

Give me a slow grind cause it'll do it to me
Every time - baby, baby
I want some more grind cause it'll do it to me every time
Slow grind - I told you I was going to have my cake
Slow grind - I told you I was going to have my cake

Everybody knows I'll have my cake and eat it too baby
This is my secret G
So put your finger on my trigger
When you pull back I figure
That you are ready to fire on me
When we are rolling around to a saxophone sound
Soakin' wet
I like the feeling I get deep inside
As we glide on a magic carpet ride

Give me a slow grind 'cause it'll do it to me every time
Slow grind - I told you I was going to have my cake
Slow grind - I told you I was going to have my cake

Loving you like this I can't help reminisce and wish
That we could do it all over again my sweet sweet baby
Memories of love we made you and I lying in the shade
You and I would never stop
You were on the bottom and I was on the top
