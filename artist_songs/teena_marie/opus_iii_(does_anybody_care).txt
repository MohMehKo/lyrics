Memories past but not forgotten
The dye is cast-Soon ripe-Soon rotten
"Ars longa vita brevis-Art is long and life is short"
My euphonic heartache-Do I brag, complain or sport
It's not enough to say you care
You've got to spread the word
Have you heard
Jesus was just a man
The Bible tells us so
He gave more than just his hands
And he never said no...
