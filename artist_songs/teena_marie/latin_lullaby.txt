Give me a kiss and I'll savor this night
Just as the wind breathes it's breath to my life
You have awakened a part of my soul
A pleasantry
Here in my dreams

And so I am lost in the shadows on the wall
And this Latin Lullaby is all I have to remind me...
Oh so many stars
But no not half as bright as you
And a warm mandolin wind
Plays next of kin
Like a lover
Like a Latin Lullaby

Come to my bed like a thief in the night
Steal me away take your breath from my life
Leave my alone you can come back to me-another time
And I'll surrender
Just like the passion that flows through my veins
More like the river and with your love came nector and honey
The sweetest of thing
Your laughter brings me to my knees

And so I am lost in the shadow of your smile
And this Latin Lullaby is all I have
To remember
How we danced that night
Under a warm calypso breeze
And you played me like the strings on your guitar
So tenderly
Like a Latin Lullaby

No one else can see inside my soul-makes me whole
No one else can touch my heart the way you do
There in your eyes I have danced a thousand times
Lost inside the sweetest melody-that is you

There in your eyes I have loved you a thousand times
Lost inside the sweetest melody

Oh so many stars
But no not half as bright as you
And a warm mandolin wind
Plays next of kin
Like a lover
And so I am lost in the shadow of your smile
And this Latin Lullaby is all I have to remember
