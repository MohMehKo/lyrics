Two weeks ago last Sunday, I was on my way from church
I met a guy named Youngblood, who was totally berserk
He told me he was looking for a place to lay his head
I read him Romans 8:14 and this is what he said

Girl, some of my homeboys told me 'bout a freaky party
Down on 63rd and Babylon
Come on girl, let's go, I got plenty of blow, and it's more fun doing wrong
The ladies call me lover, 'cause I got the gift of gab and a few other specialties
I'd really like to make you, if you'd only let me date you
You'd belong only to me

He said I know that there's a freak deep down inside of you
Dying to get out, and ooo

He asked me to help Youngblood get to the freaky party
But I'm not gonna help Youngblood get to the freaky party

I can't begin to tell you of the sadness in my mind
Knowing there was no contentment in two eyes so blind
I told him that the joy would surely bring eternal bliss
I read Galatians Chapter 4, and he said yea check this

Girl, some of my homeboys told me 'bout a freaky party
Down on 63rd and Babylon
Come on girl, get live, it's a much hipper vibe
And it's more fun doing wrong
The ladies call me baby 'cause I've got a killer smile
And they love my smooth touch
Only time will tell, if there's Heaven or Hell
Or if I'm just out to lunch

He said I know that there's a freak deep down inside of you
Dying to get out, and ooo

He asked me to help Youngblood get to the freaky party
But I'm not gonna help Youngblood get to the freaky party

Gril, some of my homeboys told me 'bout a freaky party on 63rd and Babylon
Come on girl, let's ride, it's a long way to slide and it's more fun doing wrong

And the ladies call you lover 'cause you got a killer smile and they love your smooth touch
But all that you have done, you can tell to the one
Who has given you so much...
