[Verse 1:]
Please don't tempt me with your sugar pops
Look at you confection surely drops
Understated sexy with your moods
You want these and baby I want those
Nosy neighbors all up in our business
Trying to figure just how ill it is
Want you so bad I can't keep my cool
Bees got honey baby I got you

[Pre-Chorus:]
Sweet baby you're a tease
Your bout to give me some cavities
Please my pallet dive your girl insane
Yeah you know your like a sugar cane

[Chorus:]
So sexy on the real
They'll never know just how good it feels
Talking smack you really are the truth
You give me a sweet tooth
(I got a sweet tooth)
Feigning for the taste I'm gonna chase you
(I got a sweet tooth)
Feigning for the taste I'll take the bait too
(I got a sweet tooth)
Feigning for the taste I'm gonna chase you
(You give me a sweet tooth)
Feigning for the taste I'll take the bait too

[Verse 2:]
Like a child in a candy store
So sick with it I want me some more
What you got you want my teeth to rot
I can't front you know my sweet spot
Now or later I'll take mine now
It's a wrap just throw your girl a towel
Secrets seem soft or so they say
Brown sugar baby I'll take mine that way

[Pre-Chorus:]
Sweet baby you're a tease
Your bout to give me some cavities
Please my pallet dive your girl insane
Yeah you know your like a sugar cane

[Chorus:]
So sexy on the real
They'll never know just how good it feels
Talking smack you really are the truth
You give me a sweet tooth
(I got a sweet tooth)
Feigning for the taste I'm gonna chase you
(I got a sweet tooth)
Feigning for the taste I'll take the bait too
(I got a sweet tooth)
Feigning for the taste I'm gonna chase you
(You give me a sweet tooth)
Feigning for the taste I'll take the bait too

[Bridge:]
Sweet like honey baby ice tea
Every time that you make love to me
Bee's got honey baby I got you
Messing with you got me a sweet tooth

[Rap:]
Sugar daddy smooth
Skin like butterscotch
Comment allez-vous
Can I get a taste of you
I watch you every move
It's looking like you could be the Wonka to my factory
Take complete control of me
Some say your no good rotten to the core
That you'll only give a piece to keep me running back for more
But I'm a fan of risk
Addicted to adrenaline
So take me on a trip and break me off a kiss

[Chorus:]
So sexy on the real
They'll never know just how good it feels
Talking smack you really are the truth

[Bridge:]
Sweet like honey baby ice tea
Every time that you make love to me
Bee's got honey baby I got you
Messing with you got me a sweet tooth

[Chorus:]
(I got a sweet tooth)
Feigning for the taste I'm gonna chase you
(I got a sweet tooth)
Feigning for the taste I'll take the bait too
(I got a sweet tooth)
Feigning for the taste I'm gonna chase you
(You give me a sweet tooth)
Feigning for the taste I'll take the bait too

[Outro:]
Confection surely drips from your lips
I need a taste, just a little taste
Cause your sweetness is my weakness

[Chorus: x2]
(I got a sweet tooth)
Feigning for the taste I'm gonna chase you
(I got a sweet tooth)
Feigning for the taste I'll take the bait too
(I got a sweet tooth)
Feigning for the taste I'm gonna chase you
(You give me a sweet tooth)
Feigning for the taste I'll take the bait too
