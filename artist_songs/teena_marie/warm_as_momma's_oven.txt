It's hot in here
Ooh
Come on in
Let's go chill
What's that you say
Yeah, that's the way
That's the way I like it

Gonna give you somethin' you can hold on to
You let me dive right up under the fire, baby
The thought has just occurred to me, the possibilities are endless
You are my soul's one burning desire, baby

So if you feel it in your heart and you wanna love me
And you feel it in your arms and you wanna hold me all night
Woman desire's, oh, so fine
And I'm givin' you all that I got

I'm gonna give you lovin'
Just as warm as momma's oven
I'm gonna make you feel so good
Just like you knew that I would

Gonna give you somethin' you can write home about
Here in a letter to your mom or your daddy
Why don't you tell them how it makes you feel, that our love is so real
I never wanted someone so badly

So if you feel it in your heart and you wanna love me
And you say what's on your lips that you kiss me all night
Woman desire, you look so sublime
And I'm givin' you all that I got

I'm gonna give you lovin', sweet baby
Just as warm as momma's oven
I'm gonna make you feel so good, my baby, baby
Just like you knew that I would

If you can't take the heat get out the kitchen (Get out the kitchen)
And if you're waitin' for my love then you'll be wishin' (Maybe you'll be wishin')
For somebody just like me, I'm on a mission, yeah
Come get to this kissin', baby, come get this kissin' {Come and get this kissin'}

This is for the lover in motion (Shoo-doo-doo)
This is for the lover in motion (Shoo-doo-shooby-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo)
This is for the lover in motion (Shooby-dooby-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo)
This is for the lover in motion (Shooby-dooby-doo-doo-doo-doo)
(Shoo-dooby-doo-doo)

If you feel all my love inside
Come on let's ride the tide, come on, my baby
You're so fine, the mood is so sublime
Givin' you all that I got

I'm gonna give you lovin', sweet baby
Just as warm as momma's oven
I'm gonna make you feel so good, my baby, baby
Just like you knew I would, just like you knew it

And if you're waitin' for my lovin' you'll be wishing
For somebody just like me, I'm on a mission
Come get to this kissin', baby, come get this kissin', baby

And the gin and the juice is the potion
