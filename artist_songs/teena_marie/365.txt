I've got a head rush, hush
You're heaven's dial, a crush
I prayed for you forever
And he sent you last November-Finally

You better hold tight flight
Two shadows, one at night
Each instant lasting so long
The spirit in this very song-Reminding me

That life has taught me lessons
Like don't dare to question fate
For God will do the gifting
All we've got to do is wait

So if anybody asks you if your love is alive
Tell them all to count up to 365

365
365 days a year
Three hundred and sixty-five
That's how much I love you dear

I got a love jones in my bones
I hear a saxaphone
A melody so haunting
It leaves my heart never wanting
More than you

You really fit the bill
The first day of April
And now I know that deep inside my heart
You're gonna play the biggest part in my love debut

For with you comes the passion
Like springtime I fathom grand
I cherish every blessing I get
When you kiss and hold my hand

So if anybody asks if your love is alive
Tell them all to count up to three hundred and sixty-five

365
365 days a year
Three hundred and sixty-five
That's how much I love you dear

Do you remember last November, baby
That's when I met you
When heaven sent you baby, ah
Sometimes I stop and throw my hands up in the air
You make me holler, hey
Tee Tee won't go away
It's more than just a feeling-It's destiny
I'm gonna testify about the long you're giving to me
I'm gonna break it down for you
Gonna break down
Break it down
Break it on down-I love you

If anybody asks if your love is alive
Tell them all to count up to three hundred and sixty-five

365
365 days a year
Three hundred and sixty-five
That's how much I love you dear
