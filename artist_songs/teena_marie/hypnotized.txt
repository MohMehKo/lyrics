Hypnotized, you got me hypnotized
All it took was one little look into your eyes
I'll do what ever you say, command me baby and I'll obey
Because I love you - need you - I want you
Feels so good sometimes I just want to say
La la la ha ha
You got me walking and talking in a trance
In a magic spell of romance
Make me hold you - make me kiss you
My heart is yours to command
Hypnotized - gee, gee I'm so hypnotized
Just one touch from your fingertips
One kiss from your soft and tender lips
I'll go wherever you want me to go
Everything I got darling is yours - yes it is
La la la ha ha

You got me caught up in a spell that you cast
Please, please make it last
