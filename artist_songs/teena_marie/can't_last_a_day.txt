[Teena Marie:]
If the sun in the sky disappeared from view
If the love in my heart baby wasn't true
If the rivers and seas would just up and dry
If the moon pass away from the deep blue sky
If I lost all my faith in the Higher Power
Tell me where would I be in the final hours
I'll be losing my way baby I'd be through
Cause I can't live a day honey without you

Can't live a day baby without your love (can't last a day)
Can't even last one day without your love

Look at me baby
Thinking that I'm real cold
Thinking that I can keep from calling
To talk to you
Filling my days with
Things to occupy my mind
My mental state playing tricks on me
But my body never lies
Trust when I tell you
Baby your love is king
I'll be alright 'til you come back
But I wish you'd never leave
Losing the battle
What's up with my defense
Can't last a day without you
This don't make no sense

[Chorus:]
Don't need your touch (I don't need your touch)
Don't need your voice (your voice)
Don't need your hands (baby)
Can't last a day (can't last a day)

Don't need your arms (I don't need your arms)
Wrapped around me (wrapped around me, baby)
Don't need your love (I don't need your lovin')
Can't last a day (can't last a day)

[Faith Evans:]
Don't need your lovin'
Don't need your candy kiss
Don't need your voice to remind me
These are all the things I miss
Feels kinda crazy
When my love's coming down
Try not to listen baby
But my heartbeat starts to pound
Hot like the summer
Sweet like the morning dew
I need you like the four seasons
With each day comes I love you
Where have my faith gone
You hold it in your hand
Guess I should learn to trust you
Cause I need you baby, baby, baby

Don't need your touch (I don't need your touch)
Don't need your voice (your voice)
Don't need your hands (baby)
Can't last a day (can't last a day)

Don't need your arms (I don't need your arms)
Wrapped around me (wrapped around me, baby)
Don't need your love (I don't need your lovin')
Can't last a day (can't last a day)

If the sun in the sky disappeared from view
And the love in my heart baby wasn't true
If the rivers and seas would just up and dry
If the moon pass away from the deep blue sky
If I lost all my faith in the Higher Power
Tell me where would I be in the final hours
I'll be losing my way baby I'd be through
Cause I can't live a day honey without you

[Chorus:]
[Faith Evans:]
Would you tell that you love me can I have you?
[Teena Marie:]
Would you be my baby and my one and only Would you listen
I can't last a day without you

[Together:]
Trust me when I tell you baby

[Teena:]
Baby, your love is king
I'll be alright 'til you come back
But I wish you'd never leave

[Faith Evans:]
Losing the battle
What's up with my defense

[Together:]
Can't last a day without you (cause I need you baby)

[Chorus: fades out]
