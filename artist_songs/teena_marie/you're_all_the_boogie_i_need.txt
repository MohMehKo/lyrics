You make me feel like dancin' all night long
You flip my light switch and you turn me on
You shake me
Earthquake me
You're all the boogie I need

I'll slip into a sexy negligee
You know the kinda games I like to play
Gimme a kiss, I'll be your dish
You're all the boogie I need

You're all the boogie I need
Come on and dance this one with me baby
You're all the boogie I need
You can get your sweet sweet lovin' from me baby

With your unique physique you make me feel
The things I felt impossible are real
You sweet beau, can't say no
You're all the boogie I need

Baby, I got the urge to do the unknown
The kinda things that Mamma banned in home sweet home
I need your touch, let's munch a bunch
You're all the boogie I need

You're all the boogie I need
Come on and dance this one with me baby
You're all the boogie I need
You can get your sweet sweet lovin' from me baby

Get it from me baby, hey aah
You're all the boogie I need
I love you boogie child come on
Let's dance a while baby
