I miss your gentleness that spoiled me
Your tender kiss that so aroused me
I miss your nakedness next to mine
Your sweet familiar scent has left me
With memories that come and get me
In the dreams I have at night

I need you more than I can say
How can I express
Through all these words I know
I'm a lady, yes I am
With my destination planned
I don't have time for babies no, no
And it's hard, hard to keep a man

But I tell you one thing that I'm gonna do
I'm gonna have my cake and eat it too
One day, some way, somehow, somewhere
Somewhere, somewhere
Can you wait baby
Somewhere
Can you wait baby

I count my blessings, make my wishes
And still I find myself suspicious
That truly love isn't just a myth
And it's hard to fall in love when you know
You got to rush to do the next show
And you can't be with the one you're with

But I need you more than I can say
How can I express
Through all these words I know
I'm a lady, yes I am
With my situation planned
I don't have time for babies no, no
And it's hard, hard to keep a man
But I tell you one thing that I'm gonna to do
I'll have my cake and eat it too
One day
Tell you one thing that I'm gonna do
I'll have my cake and eat it too
One day, somehow, some way
I'll tell you one thing that I'm gonna do
I'm gonna have my cake, baby, and you
One day, someway, someway
Sugar

Tell you one thing that I'm gonna do
I'm gonna have my cake and eat it too
One day, somehow, someway
Sugar, please don't hold your breath
'Cause you just might turn blue
If your patience doesn't get the best of you
One day I'm gonna have my cake, my love
And you
