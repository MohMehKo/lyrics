[Lady Levi:]
Now here comes Lady Levi 'longside Lady Tee, the great Lady Tee, 'nuff respect every time
So go ahead and put those "five" in the ear
And wave from side to side
Who I am, is defined by the way I act, by the way I care
By the way I share
Who I am shouldn't make people stop and stare
Cause everybody's got their different stylings

[Teena Marie:]
Global warmings, got you hotter
Than you've ever been before
Dissapation, of the rights of culture
And the family structure is no more

Green-eyed dragon still the root of all that's evil
And another baby's born diseased
Drug-addiction wastes the land of milk and honey
Mama cries and falls down to her knees
Wonderin' why all our cosmic lies are broken
But will I have to watch my children die?

My brothers and sisters please
Love all that is earthly
My Lord help us up above
Recycle our hate to love

Nows the moment, from an inner conscience
Rebuild the thinking of the human race
Before mass extinction of all sacred beings
And the true devotion can take place

One-eyed beast of [? ] in the corner laughing
Prostitutes our children, pimps them blind
Air pollution just as thick as thieves, I can't breathe
Bullets fly another mother cries
Now that all our cosmic laws are broken
Will I have to watch my children die?

My brothers and sisters please
Our earth is so holy
My Lord help us up above
Recycle our hate to love

As the earth goes, around the sun
Stars gave birth to you and I
We're evolving to a higher being
And she trying to tell you
Of her days gone by

[Alia Rose:]
Peace to my children in the Middle East
Peace to my brothers in South Central's streets
Peace to my sisters on the west side
Peace to my homies on the shoreline
Peeps to my peeps in the ghetto
Peace to my Locs in the Barrio
Peace to the mothers and the fathers who
Who ever lost a child before their life was through

[Teena Marie:]
What you think is small is [? ]
No compassion then pain versus
Terrorism cause great offense
I am Love and Loves my greatest gift

My Lord, My lord help us up above
