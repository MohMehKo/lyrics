Hey, baby
What you feel like doin'
Just me, just you
Just us two

(Just us two) Oh, baby
(Just us) Ooh-wee-, ooh-wee, ooh-wee, ooh, ooh baby
(Just us two) Ey... hey...
(Just us)

I saw your face and love struck me just like a lightning bolt
Just like 20, 000 volts
You seemed so shy I guess I'll shoot a rocket to the moon
Can't afford to lose this groove

I got to let you know
On my knees I prayed for you to love me
Tender love warm my heart
'Cause you got to court me to spark

(Just us two) Always and forever
(Just us) 'Cause no one else could love you better
(Just us) Just me, just you
(Just us) Just us two

I haven't kissed you yet, I don't think I can handle it
Just a hopeless romantic
I hear your body talkin', ooh, sweet words of love sublime
Tell me, can you read my mind

There's not a spoken word I can say
'Cause I prayed for you night and day
Tender love warm my heart
'Cause you got to court me to spark

(Just us two) Until the 6 becomes 9
(Just us) Even if it takes 100 lifetimes
(Just us) Could never wear us down, can't tear us down
(Just us) Just us two

(Just us two) Always forever
(Just us) 'Cause no one else could love you better
(Just us) Just me, just you
(Just us) Just us, just us, just us two

Just us two always, oh... oh...
Always, always
Well, I'd kiss the ground you walk on
No one else could love you
Not like I do

Ooh, baby, ooh, I hear you talkin' too
Soft and sexy, so sublime
No one could have told me that your love would come
So hot like the summertime

Please, baby, please, you got me on my knees
Tender lover warm my heart
Just like 20, 000 volts
Your love struck like a lightening bolt
You got to court me to spark

(Just us two) Always forever
(Just us) 'Cause no one else could love you better
(Just us) Just me, just you
(Just us) Just us two

(Just us two) Until the 6 becomes 9
(Just us) Even if it takes 100 lifetimes
(Just us) Could never wear us down, can't tear us down
(Just us) Just us, just us, just us two

Just us two
Kiss the ground you walk on
Ooh, whoa
Just us

Every time you touch me when you mix the wind with rain
It gets my rhythm goin' and my fire turns to flame, ooh
Every time you touch me I go insane

(Just us two) Always forever
(Just us) 'Cause no one else could love you better
(Just us) Just me, just you
(Just us) Just us, just us, just us two

(Just us two) Until the 6 becomes 9
(Just us) Even if it takes 100 lifetimes
(Just us) Could never wear us down, can't tear us down
(Just us) Just us, just us, just us two

There's a fine line between sensuality and the spirit
And you and I will find a way
To bring those two things together
Magically
Harmonizing, everlasting love
Until the 6 becomes 9, I'll be loving you
