Contrary to popular opinion I'm extremely shy
I'm not the kind of girl who goes for any kind of guy
I seem together yea you always say I'm cool
But baby ooh you know that there is always an exception to the rule

Cause I loved you since day one baby
I thought about it I'd swim the deepest sea
To love you my only lover

You are the answer and you are the deal
You are the driver the smoke and the spoke in the wheel
And I never, no I wouldn't lie
I'm gonna love you until I die

Since day one in my neighborhood
In my little black book, baby in my bed
Since day one in my daddy's car in my love my life
And I'll love you forever

Baby ooh I can't control my passion
I need to be free
I'm not too proud I want you baby
My desire it burns so righteously

I say forever that's a mighty long long time
I go down fast like second nature
Ooh wee baby that's the bottom line
Cause I loved you since day one baby

My knees were weak I loved you forever
I loved you since day one

You are the answer and you are the deal
You are the driver the smoke and the spoke in the wheel
And I never no I wouldn't lie
I'm gonna love you until I die

Since day one in my neighborhood
In my little black book, baby in my bed
Since day one in my daddy's car
In my heart and my soul
And I'll love you forever

Don't you get the feeling that
We've known each other somewhere before
Tenderly through time, Love's a mystery
Then it must be magic, effervescent, laced with passion Filled with ecstasy
Love is calling you, Love's calling me

Since day one... etc...
