[Verse 1:]
You can take possession of my body
I'll give you the full authority
Call me on my unrestricted number if you like
If you want some company
I'm gon' leave it up to your discretion
'Cause it seems I've finally found my dime
And, if you wanna play with my affection
Then call me on my private line

[Chorus:]
Carte blanche, baby
Any story you write
I'm gonna sign for you, baby
You've got carte blanche, baby
You're really bossy, I know
But, I love when you take control

[Verse 2:]
There's someone here who wants to handle something
Giving you complete autonomy
It seems a crime to forget all we once were
I'm gon' let you handle me
I'm giving you the blank card, it's the black card
Like the jokers, highest guaranteed
And, if I let you kiss me it's all over
The kiss would give me much more potency

[Chorus:]
Carte blanche, baby
Any story you write
I'm gonna sign for you, baby
You've got carte blanche, baby
You're really bossy, I know
But I love when you take control

[Verse 3:]
Ask me; what you want?
And, I'll give you the world on a silver platter, baby
Here I stand holding a heart so true
And, if that doesn't do
Baby, then I'll try something new

[Interlude:]
What you wanna do?

[Verse 4:]
Handle your business, baby
I'm gonna let you handle me
I'm gon' let you dominate the hour, baby
I'm giving you the power over everything

[Chorus:]
Carte blanche, baby
Any story you write
I'm gonna sign for you, baby
You've got carte blanche, baby
You're really bossy, I know
But, I love when you take control

[Outro:]
So nice with it, baby
I'm gonna let you handle me
Got my signature, baby, you can rest assure
You got the cure, baby
Sign my name on the dotted line
And, it's right on time
You're so fine
