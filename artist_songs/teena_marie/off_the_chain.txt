Westside girl is dancing
Off the chain, it's sickening
Lady Tee is...
(Do you feel me)
Mmm

Got your dinner waiting on the table
I've even chilled the wine
Come over, baby
Boy, don't be crazy

You've been waiting for a little something
And your girl's about to break you right off
You're about to know my name
Baby's off the chain

Got you feeling
Off the chain
She sexing
Off the chain
She's flipping
Off the chain
Baby
Your girl is I'll
She's off the chain
It's sickening
Off the chain
She's moaning
Off the chain

Mercury's rising and it's hot like fire
I'm feeling feverish
About to lace you
Can almost taste you

West coast's popping all around your body
And my s***'s of the hook in the south
You'll never be the same
Baby's off the chain

Got you feeling
Off the chain
She sexing
Off the chain
She's flipping
Off the chain
Baby
Your girl is I'll
She's off the chain
It's sickening
Off the chain
She's certainly
Off the chain

Did you ever think that we'd be making love like this
How can you resist me, baby
Now that we have kissed
I've been saving all my love
For only you
West coast is on and popping
Boy, you den started something

[rap baby:]
West coast's got your chest on swoll
Dirty South's insatiable
Northeast, tell me now what you say
Got your taste buds tanging like Alize
Lady's banging all out your back
Got your heartbeat racing like a heart attack
Going on and on to the break of dawn
And s*** don't stop to the early morn

Off the chain
Off the chain
Baby's off the chain
Do your thang
Do your thang
This love is good
It's off the
Off the chain
Off the chain
Baby's off the chain
Do your thang
Do your thang
This love is good
It's off the
Chain
Chain
Chain
Uh

West coast's popping
It's off the chain
East Coast's flipping
It's off the chain
Midwest's banging
It's off the chain
Dirty South is off the chain [x2]

Got you feeling
Mm
She's fine
She's sickening
She's moaning off the
Your girl is I'll
She's off the
She's sick
And she's off the
She's flipping off the
She's freaking off the chain
