Into the cave where lust and love became one
Where the round wound and the black bottom quiver
Where the ivory gets tickles by cool black hands
We create dance and melody
Resounding
Unpretentious spirit
Oh that we are the leaders of tomorrow
At a quarter past eleven they'll come running
Caged but ever free
To the sound of the drum and the runes on the wall
We remember our heroes ex-per-ession
Sassy
Lester
Billie
Satch and the Duke
Yes Lord, this is the place to be

In the eleventh hour baby
When the moon is high
Sugar when my passion starts to flow
I got a fantasy, it's for you
And I know a real hot spot
I can take you anywhere you want to go
I know a place down by the tracks
Where they got a little jazz band
It's such a sexy situation
We'll bust a bottle of Cristal
Then just wait to see what happens
Won't you come with me
You can meet me over at the Sugar Shack
Quarter past eleven, hurry baby
You can meet me over at the Sugar Shack
I got your sugar, your sweetness, your lovin' that's my weakness
Do you like it like this
I'm down for whatever turns you on
I got a fellin' deep inside me
That we like it similar
And as they say in French voulez-vous right there
I know a place down by the tracks
Where they got a little jazz band
It's such a sexy situation
We'll bust a bottle of Cristal
Then just wait to see what happens
Won't you come with me
You can meet me over at the Sugar Shack
Quarter past eleven, hurry baby
You can meet me over at the Sugar Shack
I got your sugar, your sweetness, your lovin' that's my weakness
Flashback, it was a real hot night
There was a love explosion, just like dynamite
You gave me sugar kisses, put them everywhere
Dishin' it out, you whipped it up I swear
In the eleventh hour when the moon was shining
Shining on my eyes and I was high signing
Come on, come on, won't you sweet swwet back You can meet me over at the Sugar Shack
Ooh sugar, sugar, sugar
I walked into the room, a hush fell on the whole place
Drop dead fine just a diva with a purpose
I slide to the right, everybody follows suit
Serious times such a sexy situation
