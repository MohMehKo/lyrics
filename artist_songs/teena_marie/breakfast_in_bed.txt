I guess that you - got next to me
Honey you were so persuasive
I gave in much to easy
Why you wanna come around here
Boy looking so fine
Let's talk about first impressions
It was the lasting kind
And I must confess the evening went straight to
My head
Cause we made love all night and then had
Breakfast in bed
Breakfast in bed - heavy on the cream
Kisses over easy and a side of everything
Breakfast in bed - loves the seasoning
May I take your order please
You must have known that I was hungry for your loving
I gave you all of my love and
Then gave you some more baby
Love deep enough to swim in
I opened up my heart and told you to come on in
Come on - come on in and let's have breakfast in bed
