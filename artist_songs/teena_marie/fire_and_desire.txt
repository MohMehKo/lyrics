[Spoken: Rick James]
Wow. It's really good to see you again, baby.
And I must admit you're looking very, very, very nice these days.
I guess life must be treating you well.
Oh me?
Well, I've just been doing the same ol' thing I've always been doing, you know.
I've got a new lady now and it's a little different than it was when I was with you.
You know, I think back to when we met, the way I used to be and the cold way I used to act.
But more than that, I think of how you changed me with your love and sensitivity.
Remember when I used to

[Sung:]
Love them and leave them
That's what I used to do Use and abuse them
Then I laid eyes on you
It was pain before pleasure
That was my claim to fame
With every measure, baby
Tasted teardrop stains, yeah
I was cold as ice, long ago baby, baby
I wasn't very, very, very nice you know
Sugar, sugar, sugar
Then I kissed your lips and
You turned on my fire, baby
And you burned me up within your flame
Took me a little higher
Made me live again
You turned on my fire, baby
Then you showed me what a love could do
Fire and desire, baby
Feel it comin' through
And I thank you baby

[Spoken: Rick James]
Oh how I thank you, baby.
You taught me so much and you showed me so much love and sensitivity,
That since you've been gone
I don't think I've ever felt this way before.
You know, it's funny how a man can change so quickly from a cold blooded person,
Thinking he's God's gift to women.
Remember how I used to do that?
Must have been crazy then.
Remember when you used to

[Teena Marie:]
Love them and leave them (oh)
That's what I used to do Use and abuse them (whoa)
Then I laid eyes on you
It was pain before pleasure (oh)
That was my claim to fame
