What do we do now, honey
Now that we know how to love
Shall we start again remembering

Now that we've played the game
Now that we've changed the name
Tune in tomorrow

What did we do then, lover
Where did we fit in with fate
Shall we start again on one thin line

Between love and hate
I'm gonna have my cake
Tune in tomorrow

Am I to take the hurt apart and show you what it's done to me
Shall I read your life story my love starting out with how it used to be
When love was new
You and I are just one soap box opera from saying goodbye to yesterday
Tune in tomorrow, same time, same place

What do I do now daddy
Now that I know how to cry
Shall I laugh it off sarcastically

Or should I draw the line
I really ought to blow your mind this time
This time tomorrow

What do we do now my love what did we do then
Shall we start again my love from jump street baby
Now that I'm beat
Tune in tomorrow

I don't need a T.V. cause I got enough to grieve me till tomorrow sugar
Tune in tomorrow channel one through fifty-four and I can's take this mess no more
Maybe that will express what I been going through

Ooh daddy daddy little mamma is just too through
Tune in tomorrow any station you desire
It doesn't really matter baby cause Tee Tee is gonna light your fire
