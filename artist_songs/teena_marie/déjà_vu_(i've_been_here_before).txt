I'm young and I'm old
I'm rich and I'm poor
I feel like I've been on this earth many times before
Once I was a white Gazelle
On horse back riding free
Searching in the darkness for a piece of me

I can feel this for sure
I've been here before
I can fell this for sure for sure
I've been here before

I used to be a queen you know
In a island by the sea
With rainbow colored people
Happy as can be
Never had a problem
There never was a care
And Love was ever flowing and it's feeling shared

And I can feel this for sure... ooh
I've been here before
I can feel this for sure
For sure for sure
For sure for sure
Oh I've been here before
Yes I have
I can feel it
I can feel it... ooh
In my heart I feel it

The soul feels like the Universe
It's vast and never ends
Stars to me are the Children
Babies are my friends
God is like a galaxy
Within my spirit flies
Felt this way a million times
Please don't ask me why

The question of my lifetime
If you ask my point of view
They say it all was Karma
Call it Deja vu
Call it Deja vu
Call it Deja vu
Call it Deja vu
Call it Deja vu
And I can feel this for sure
I've been here before
And I can feel... this for sure
I've been here before
I've been here before
I can feel it

I'm young and I'm old
I'm rich and I'm poor
I feel like I've been on this earth many times before
Once I was a white Gazelle
On horse back riding free
Searching in the darkness for a piece of me

I used to be a queen you know
In a island by the sea
With rainbow colored people
Happy as can be
There never was a problem
There never was a care
And Love was ever flowing and it's feeling shared

And I can feel this for sure
For sure for sure
For sure for sure
I've been here before
I swear It
I can feel this for sure
I've been here before

If hate is on your mind
And you can't give love the time
If anger if your friend
Don't know when you die you'll come back again
And In the master's plan...
You'll come back woman or man
If your life is full of sin...
Don't you know when you die you'll come back again!
I thank God... thank God... thank God...
I am not coming back no more!
I've been here before...
Thank God... thank God... thank God!
(I don't want to come back no more!)
