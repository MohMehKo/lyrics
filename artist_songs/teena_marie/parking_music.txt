Baby slow down - park the car turn the key off
There must be ten zillion stars out tonight
I'm ready for love I've got real smooth intentions
The lovers in me wants to hold you real tight
I've been waiting, anticipating
Cause your love sends me, baby you know that
The lover in me wants to bring out the best that's in you
Come on baby, come on baby, come on
Let's make parking music - baby making music
Music to make love by
Music just for lover - underneath the covers
Only you can satisfy - satisfy - you're so fly
You're so fly - you're so fly - you're so fly
Fly just relax let me ease all your tensions
Ahh come baby - let me touch your special place
I'll do all I can I got things on my mind
I'm gonnna love you like I never - you're so fine

Cause your love wrecks me - baby you know that
The lover in you wants to bring out the best that's in me
Come on baby, come on baby, come on
Let's play parking music, baby making music
Music to make love by
Music just for lovers - underneath the covers
Only you can satisfy - satisfy - you're so fly
Whispering in your ear

My only wish is to satisfy you - come on, come on

Giving you something you can feel
