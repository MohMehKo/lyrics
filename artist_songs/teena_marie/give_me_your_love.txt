Want you so bad, can't even get mad at you

Breathing in the air

Settling a tingle all up and down my spine
Make every movement change
Make love all through the night
I want to be a part of you
Keep our thing up tight
Keep the faith in all you do 'cause everything is alright

Give me your love, give me your love, give me your love (give me all your love, give me all your love)

[Verse 3:]
Can't for the more you do, but you have to do
I share the weight whatever fate has wing to you
To worry bout no attitude you just be yourself
'Cause I can live with you in solitude
And need no one else

Give me your love, give me your love, give me your love (give me all your love, uh uh baby)
Give me your love, give me your love, give me your love (give me your love, give me your love)
