Sunny Skies
It's funny you and I were both so blue
Do you feel the things I do
Sunny Skies-I still can see your eyes
When you said hello I knew all too soon you'd go
When the autumn came you went away
Was our summer love a bit too hot for you to stay
Don't make this last forever-It's raining January
Through December
Please don't take away my Sunny Skies
Please don't take away my Sunny Skies
A tear fell from my eyes and since you went away
I've been sad and blue and grey
Sunny Skies-It's really no surprise
That I'm lost alone and I wish you just come home
When the autumn leaves came tumbling down
I looked everywhere and you could not be found
Don't make it last forever-It's raining January
Through December
Please don't take away my Sunny Skies
Please don't take away my Sunny Skies
Would you take the leaves from trees
So that they can't breathe
Would you take the wings from birds
So that they can't fly
Would you tell a secret told in trust
This I know you'd never do this I beg of you
Please don't take away my Sunny Skies
Please don't take away my Sunny Skies
