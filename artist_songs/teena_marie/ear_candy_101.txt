Talkin' to ya (Class is in session)
Talkin', talkin' sweet
Talkin' to ya(Welcome to Ear Candy 101)
Bout to bring the heat, Talkin' to ya, bout to bring the heat (Where every thing you're serious about, ha, you can do for fun)

I could talk real proper to ya like an English Major
Put it down in street terms baby, like an OG player
Maybe speak some spanglish to ya, yo tengo me azucar
Whatever you want baby, taste muy mucho
I'll recite some sonnets for ya, sweet like William Shakespeare
I will be the candy maker, you can be the taster
Put you in my trick bag baby like the Alper Dodger
Sit back in my easy chair and let me massage ya

[Chorus:]
Driving you mad (Ear Candy)
Baby I'm bad (Ear Candy)
Breaking you off (Ear Candy)
Cause I'm the bomb (Ear Candy)
Keeping it raw (Ear Candy)
Laying down the law (Ear Candy)
With every kiss, it don't get no better than this

Would you like a sample baby, what's your favorite flavor?
Drop it like an old school record, now you in danger
Put you on my metaphors, my double entendres
Maybe they can set you free or keep you in bondage
Maybe I can be your queen, if you play your cards right
Maybe you can be my king, if you keep your love tight

Rewind, Something about that ear candy,
Just rewind
Something about that ear candy is

[Chorus:]
Driving you mad (Ear Candy)
Baby I'm bad (Ear Candy)
Breaking you off (Ear Candy)
Cause I'm the bomb (Ear Candy)
Keeping it raw (Ear Candy)
Laying down the law (Ear Candy)
With every kiss, it don't get no better than this

Ooo my love, my love
Something about that ear candy keeps you coming back to me

Something about that ear candy keeps you coming back to me (Something about my ear candy)
Something about that ear candy keeps you coming back to me (I'm talkin' to you in you ear baby)

Welcome to Ear Candy 101
Where every thing you're serious about, you can do for fun
Maybe you might let me tell you a sweet little story
Close your eyes and listen as I put you before me
Maybe I can be your queen, if you play your cards right
Maybe you can be my king, if you keep your love tight

[Chorus x2]

Something about that ear candy keeps you coming back to me
Something about that ear candy keeps you coming back to me
Something about that ear candy keeps you coming back to me
Something about that ear candy keeps you coming back to me
