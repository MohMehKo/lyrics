Boy you dropped a bomb on me a long, long time ago
And all I ever wanted was to love you baby
Something sacred in my life, a flame to burn, a candle bright
I want to stay just for your loving baby [? ]
Known so many others in my life, none like you
No one else can make me feel the things you do
And if I had the chance to do it all again
I'd do it 'cause you've always been my true love and my best friend

You baby, you baby, you baby
(All I ever wanted was)
You baby, you baby, you baby
(All I ever needed baby)
You baby, you baby, you baby
(Understand me child)
You baby, you baby, you baby
(Hear me talking to you)

Looking out the window when I woke today
I wished you all the finer things the world could give you daughter
Sunshine on your face, good health, prosperity and grace
And time to reap what you've been sowing, love and laughter
Had so many others in my life, none like you
No one else can make me feel the things you do
And if I had the chance to do it all again
I'd do it 'cause you've always been my first love and my next of kin

You baby, you baby, you baby
(All I ever wanted was)
You baby, you baby, you baby
(All I ever needed was)
You baby, you baby, you baby
(I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night)
You baby, you baby, you baby
(I got a walk through the dark with a light so bright)

Deep inside my heart of hearts
Only heaven knows the things I pray for late at night when I'm alone
Faith, hope, love and charity
All these things for my family
And from the moment that I wake up I say a little prayer for you
Like Aretha said, "I say a little prayer for you."

You baby, you baby, you baby
(All I ever wanted was)
You baby, you baby, you baby
(All I ever needed was)
You baby, you baby, you baby
(Understand me?)
You baby, you baby, you baby
(I know y'all hear me now)

All I ever wanted was a place to call my own
Just a little slice of paradise and home
I thank the Lord above for sending me your precious love
And from sunrise to sunup it's all about you baby yeah

You baby, you baby, you baby
(I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night)
You baby, you baby, you baby
(I got a walk through the dark with a light so bright)
You baby, you baby, you baby
(I got a joy and a happiness I've never known)
You baby, you baby, you baby
(I've got a love in my life and my own sweet home)
