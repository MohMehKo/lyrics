Rescue me and my precious cargo
We have short time to be wed
White knights, with silver shadoes
Have placed thoughts in my head
The King and I, In a mystery series
Much ado-about
Sheldons romance-sweet novella
Passion crying out
Thoughts of you go to my head
You turn me on-Ooo you so heavy
You turn me on-Oooo you so heavy
Consider me, and my love ahoy
Sugarcoat me in your path
I'll surrender, I need a little sympathy
When there's noone you can trash
Call me I'm your pacifier
When you need some company
Sister can't fly ith one wing
So just give her what she needs
You make me feel like drifting
Through my golden years

Thoughts of you go to my head
You turn me on-Ooo you do heave
You tailor-make me
And I'm dressed in secret fears
Thoughts of you go to my head
You turn me on-Oooooo you so heavy-heavy-heavy
