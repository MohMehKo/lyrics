Turn around to see you
In a crowded place
I watch for the emotions
On a guarded face
Saying lead me on

Victim of a dream
And a memory
But when I try to break free
You say to me
C'mon lead me on

A matter out of time
In the reaches of space
Caught up in the patterns
In the light of a life
Walk across the bridge
To the shadows of the night

Saying lead me on
Lead me on
Lead me on
On and on

Voices in the night
Chase the demons away
Looking in the mirror
It's easy to say
C'mon lead me on

The choices of a lifetime
In the dreams of a day
When the coast is gettin' clearer
I hear you say
Lead me on

A matter out of time
In the look on your face
Caught up in the patterns
In the light of a life
Walk across the bridge
To the shadows of the night

Talk to me of lightning - I'll hear what you say, my love
Reaching for the meaning all of the way
I can keep believing in you and me, my love
Finding the answers that we need - sometimes it's meant to be

Turn around to see you
In a crowded place
I watch for the emotions
As they cross your face
Saying lead me on

I see you in a dream
And a memory
A captive of the light
You say to me
Lead me on
