Late last night I couldn't stop the tears from falling
Seems like I was crying all night long
Me baby gone away and left me blue
And there's not a lot that me can do
No there's not a lot that me can do

Foolish pride to think that I could just forget it
Knowing that the need would still be here
Lonely, lonely room, I hold my pillow close to me
Just an empty bed of memories
Just an empty bed of memories

Stop the world, I want to get off
It's turning, it's turning baby, much too fast
Stop the world-yeah-stop the world

So political the situations, really
Crazy like a you know what I mean
Me baby come and gone-vibration too far out of hand
Just an empty bed in my homeland
Just an empty bed in my homeland

Oh, stop the world, I want to get off
It's turning, much too fast
It's turning, much too fast, much too fast
Stop the world-yeah-stop

Stop, stop breaking my heart
Stop, stop breaking my heart
Stop, stop breaking my heart
Stop, stop breaking my heart
Stop, stop breaking my heart
Stop, stop breaking my heart
Oh stop the world

Stop the world-yeah stop
Stop the world, I want to get off
Stop the world-oh-ooo baby
Stop the world, baby, stop the world
Oh baby-you're breaking my heart baby
Stop the world-baby stop the world
Oh-oooo
