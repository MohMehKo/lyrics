War is all around us
Fighting everywhere
Poverty, destruction
Do they really even care

Brothers fighting brothers cause their color's blue
So we're living in the red zone, what am I supposed to do

Sometimes I feel like I don't want to sing at all
Then I think about you baby and I know I got stand up tall

Babies making babies, full of china white
Cracking down a dark street, they can't even see no light
Living for a pipe dream smoking out the blessed minds
Killing sweet, defenseless people
They don't even do no time

Sometimes I feel like I don't want to sing no more
Then I think about you baby
And what my sweet Lord had for me in store

I'm living in the red zone but you know it's not that bad
Cause I got you beside me and I don't have to feel so sad
I'm living in the red zone, don't you worry about a thing
Cause you got me to hold you tight
And you'll be standing in the wings

Holocaust apartheid all around the map
One lady has 10, 000 shoes and another has food stamps
So many bag people with nowhere to go
I can't believe it still goes on
Living in the red zone

Sometimes I feel like I don't want to sing at all
Then I think about you baby and I know I got to stand up tall

I'm living in the red zone but you know it's not that bad
Cause I got you beside me and I don't have to feel so sad
I'm living in the red zone, don't you worry about a thing
Cause you got me to hold you tight
And you'll be standing in the wings

You reached in and drew a string of lights all around my heart
You comfort me and you walked me through the dark
I'll always love you for the things that you've given me
To be loved by you is a blessing
