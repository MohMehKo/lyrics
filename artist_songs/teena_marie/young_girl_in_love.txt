Well you sat back, tipped your hat and gave me a wink
You pulled up my chair and we had a drink
You can't imagine what I'm feeling tonight
Love at first sight, ooh baby
I'm just a young girl in love

So we got up, walked out, went to your place
There's no confusing the smile on my face
It's not an easy thing to run away from
I want you to give me some
I'm just a young girl in love

If I listen to my momma she say
You're just a young girl, and you can't feel this way

If I listen to my daddy
I'll be alone, I'm just a young girl for your love

We walked into your room and you shut the door
I've never been in this position before
I think I bit off more than I could chew
I can't be here with you
I'm just a young girl in love

I tried to say but my lips wouldn't move
There's no prevention when it comes to you
I guess it's all over, so here I am
Let's do it all again, baby, baby, baby

If I listen to my momma she say
You're just a young girl in love, and you can't feel this way

If I listen to my daddy
I'll be alone, I'm just a young girl in love

Ooh aah hey biff bam... ooh aah hey... you got the grandest slam
