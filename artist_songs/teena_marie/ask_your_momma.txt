Society
Who's to say who loves you
And on the colors of love
Are we to be schooled
Society
Our minds, bodies, and souls will meet tolerance
Society
Put an end to ignorance

Ask your momma can she feel it
Does she know about my love
Does she know you got my heart in your hand
Ask your momma will she cry when she sees
This 14K band of gold, oh, baby
Wonder will she say what will I tell my friends

Society's child
Some people think I was born with a silver sthingy in my mouth
That isn't right, that isn't right, uh, uh
I had dreams of grandeur
And I was labeled like Campbell soup
Baby, all I wanted to do
Was sing to you and love you true

I see the looks down their noses
I hear shots in the dark
We sleep on no bed of roses
Tug of wars on our hearts, hey

We think we're the perfect blend
But they can't see beyond the skin, whoa...

Ask your momma does she remember
The bible says about equals
Or is it this different when it hits this close to your home
Ask your momma will the children suffer
Or will they hate us for our dreams, oh, baby
I wonder will she say what will I tell my friends

Society speaking
Some of my best friends are different shades
It's a shame, it's a crime
They blow your mind, time after time, baby

I had pretty visions
And I was labeled and I was robbed
Baby, all I wanted to do
Was sing to you and love you true

I see the looks down their noses
I hear shots in the dark
We sleep on no bed of roses
Tug of wars on our hearts, hey

We think we're the perfect blend
But they can't see beyond the skin, whoa...

Ask your momma can she feel it
Does she know about my love, oh, oh
Does she know you got my heart in your hand
Ask your momma will she cry when she sees
This 14K band of gold, oh, baby
I wonder will she say what will I tell my friends

Hey... baby
Hey... hey...
Ask your momma can she feel it, can she feel it
Feel it in her heart
Can she feel it in her heart
Can she feel it in her heart
Ask your momma

It's such a crime, it's such a crime
It's such a crime
It's such a crime, it's such a crime
It's blowing my mind, baby

It's such a crime
It's such a crime
It's blowing my mind
It's blowing my mind
It's blowing my mind
Time after time

I see the looks down their noses
I hear shots in the dark
We sleep on no bed of roses
Tug of wars on our hearts, hey

We think we're the perfect blend
But they can't see beyond the skin, whoa...

Ask your momma can she feel it
Does she know about my love
Ask your momma can she feel it
Does she know about my love
