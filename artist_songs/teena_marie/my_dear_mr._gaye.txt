Come inside from the rain
Let me make love to you until the drops dry on the windowpane
Heart to heart you took my soul
And now my feelings must be revealed
And our love we must unfold

Like all the ladies loved you My Dear Mr. Gaye
All the ladies loved you My Dear Mr. Gaye

Trouble man now you're home
Let me hear you whisper softly
Secret words to me alone
Free your mind and take my soul inside your feelings
Sing one for me
For my love it sings for you

Like all the ladies loved you My Dear Mr. Gaye
All the ladies loved you My Dear Mr. Gaye

Soon you will see
A pretty rainbow shining through the clouds
Open up the heavens
God has sent an angel
And just like rain comes down
You will always be around...
