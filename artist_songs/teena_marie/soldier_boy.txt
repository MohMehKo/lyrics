Soldiers...
I'm sending this one out to all the men and women overseas...
Soldiers...
In hopes that you come home to your families...S
Oldiers

Give your love just for a lifetime
Faith is just at the right time
Hope here in the night time
Daylight brings the sunshine

Comfort when you needed it
Triviality trust try chance believed it

Send you sweet things through the front door
Give you all of this and much more

Soldier boy sleep there with the angels
Soldier boy keep you safe from danger
Soldier boy we will always be together
I love you, but God he loves you better

So much war and poverty
Wished that you could rest your head on me

To kiss each others' tears away
Keep all your fears at bay

Home as soon as possible
Remind you of the golden rule
See your son and daughter's eyes
In them I keep hope alive

Soldier girl sleep there with the angels
Soldier girl keep you safe from danger
Soldier girl we will always be together
I love you, but God he loves you better

Open up your heart you'll find it's heaven sent
And all your thoughts become so pure so relevant
Exceptions in your mind you'll find immaculate
And all you winter is no longer; test for test

Our Father, who art in heaven,
Hallowed be thy Name.
Thy kingdom come.
Thy will be done,
On earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
And forgive us our trespasses,
As we forgive those who trespass against us.
And lead us not into temptation,
But deliver us from evil.

I look around the world and all I see is so much pain and turmoil
Got to teach your kids not to waste and destroy the earth's soil
Send our children off to war and watch them die for crude oil
Find a positive of what is blue or we are foiled

If I had one wish right now, I'd wish I could hold you
Remind you of the sweet things your mama told you
Wrap my arms around you until this has been brought to closure
Read my letters back to back; you'll always be my soldier

You can count on me to understand; in my milk and honey land
Things are really not that bad; joyous tidings don't be sad
I'll be waiting right here for you; I am well and I adore you
Unconditional my love; higher than the stars above

Soldier boy sleep there with the angels
Soldier boy keep you safe from danger
Soldier boy we will always be together
I love you, but God he loves you better
