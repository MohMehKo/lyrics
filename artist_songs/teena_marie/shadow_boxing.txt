Loving, fresh as the morning dew
Sunrise talks just to you
Nocturnal night one last adieu
I'm coming, I'm going
I'm swimming, I'm flowing
I'm right here beside you babe
Passion was not the answer
Was not the question
Yet it was all of this and more
Your river and heartlight
The ebb in the tide at night
The do, in the do me babe

I'm dreaming of, the one I love
I fall into a slumber deep
In eyes as black as ebony
And if there ever was a spark
It's when we're shadow boxing in the dark
Shadow boxing in the dark
Do I have to break it down for you
Shadow boxing in the dark
For this is all the love I've found in you

Ooo baby
Loving, warm as a zephyr breeze
Soft when you're touching me baby
Rhythm inside -ooo- if you please
I'm coming, I'm going
I'm swimming, I'm flowing
I'm right here beside you babe

Here I am baby
Hush my drunken heart again
Savoring every moment of your love
Wanting so much what's inside of you
Needing your touch baby - oh what more can I do

Do I have to break it down for you - oh baby
For this is all the love I've found in you - oh darlin'
Shadow boxing in the dark
Shadow boxing in the dark
Do me, do me
I love you, I love you
Shadow boxing baby in the dark
I need to break it down babe
Straight from my heart
Do me, do me
