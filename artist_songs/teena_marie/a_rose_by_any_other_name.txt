Lately all the flowers seem to be so plain
Can u tell a rose by any other name

[Gerald Levert:]
Lady your body moves
Like poetry
Like a diamond in the raw
U shine 4 me
No one else can hold a candle
To u girl
Cause your everything I need
In my world
Baby

Lately all the flowers seem to be so plain
Can you tell a rose by any other name
(Take your time)

[Teena Marie:]
Oh I got a song 4 u boy
Tellin the world about the joy
In my garden
In the shade
Cause my world was spinnin round
Until u made my love come down
Never gonna let u go(no)
I'm never gonna let u go

Lately all the flowers seem to be so plain(seem so plain)
Can you call a rose by any other name(any other name)
Here inside your garden it's like I feel unchanged(I've been changed)
Can you call a rose by any other name(any other name)
