I might as well be wearing rose-colored glasses
Looking at the world through rose-colored you
For you know your smile is ever convincing me
That nobody else's love will ever do

Can I speak of you
My lips know nothing but your name
Can I speak of passion
Without feeling guilt or shame
Heaven must have known I needed something real
To call my very own

Cupid is a real straight shooter
Looks like he got me, shot me
Cupid is a real straight shooter
Looks like he got me, shot me
With your love
Shot me with your love
LOVE love

Did you say the sky was turquoise and orange
Well deep inside my heart I know that this is true
For your smile is ever convincing me
That nobody else's love will ever do

Can I speak of hearts and ancient art as passionate
Can I talk eternal and will you know what I meant
Heaven must have known I needed your heart for my special valentine

Cupid is a real straight shooter
Looks like he got me, shot me
Cupid is a real straight shooter
Looks like he got me
Gone and shot me with your love, L O V E
Gone and shot me with your love, L O O V E, love

Sent from up above
Cupid won't you send out this my special valentine
Won't you shoot your arrows high
Hey shoot 'em up sky high
Hey and it's all about your love

I wrote a song about you, baby
I'm gonna tell the world, how much I love you
Give it to me

Heaven must have known I needed you
Baby to call my very own

Cupid is a real straight shooter
Cupid draw back your bow, and let your arrow flow
Straight to my lover's heart for me
Shoot me with your love
