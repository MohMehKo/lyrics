[Interlude:]
There is a rose, my rose is black
(Am La Rosa)
There is a rose, my rose is black
(Am La Rosa)
There is a rose, my rose is black
(Mi madressita)
There is a rose, my rose is black
(And it's mis ojos, mi vida)

Most hazel eyes
Promise the same, soft the shore
Dark Spanish eyes
Makin me bound, crying for me

Wide as the wind
You make me wanna love again
You make me wanna call your name for a long time
Bonita
You make me wanna walk your way, it's the right time (bonita)
For love

[Chorus:]
(Maria bonita)
...
She's my lady
(Maria bonita)
Es mi vida
You make love last forever
(Maria bonita)
Es mi madre
...
(Maria bonita)
Es mi vida
Save your love just for me

[Interlude:]
There is a rose, my rose is black
(Am La Rosa)
There is a rose, my rose is... rosa
(La rosa es linda y negra)

... eyes, green like the sea beckons to me
Whispers my name
So soft and real, answers my prayer
So white inside, you make me wanna ride the tide
You make me wanna call your name for a long time
Maria (Maria)
You make me wanna walk your way, it's the right time for love

[Chorus:]
(Maria bonita)
...
She's my lady
(Maria bonita)
Es mi madre
You make love last forever
(Maria bonita)
Mi carrida
...
(Maria bonita)
Es mi madre
I save your love just for me

There is a rose, my rose is black
(Am La Rosa)
There is a rose, my rose is black

There is a rose, my rose is black
(Am La Rosa)
There is a rose, a black rose
Soy tu rosa

Wide as the wind
You make me wanna love you again and again
You make me wanna call your name for a long time
Maria
You make me wanna walk your way, it's the right time for love

[Chorus:]
(Maria bonita)
...
She's my lady
(Maria bonita)
Es mi madre
You make love last forever
(Maria bonita)
Mi carrida
