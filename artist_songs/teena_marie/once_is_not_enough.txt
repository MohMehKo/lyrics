The first time that I met you- you drove 85 miles per hour
You said riding with the top down made you feel so free-gave you power
I thought your eyes were deeper that any I've seen
And then you hit me with your love machine
I said could we go somewhere and be alone
You kissed me on my cheek and drove me home

Once is not enough- when you kissed me baby
Once is not enough- when you hold me in your arms
It's never enough- I've got to have your baby
Once is not enough- I need you 25 hours everyday
8 days a week-25 hours-8 days a week

I laid awake that night baby I tossed and turned 'til a quarter to seven
I slipped off to LaLa and there you were and I was in heaven
You put your arms around me and loved me so sweet
You said you've got the symptoms of someone in life
I said it's more like a heavy psyche

Once is not enough- when you kissed me baby
Once is not enough- When you hold me in your arms
I need a little more- I've got to have you baby
Once is not enough- I need you 25 hours everyday
8 days a week-25 hours-8 days a week

Once is not enough- Once is never enough- Once is not enough
If I want to make love to you- I should be able to
But once is not enough- It's not enough
