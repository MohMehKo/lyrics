Saw you there, Tall and dark, Handsome too
Put it all together baby and you got
Lots of groovy loving, Lover by the dozen
Giving you things like diamond rings
What they wouldn't do for you
At it's best there's still the emptiness
You travel down that road alone
Really got it going on

Snap your fingers and they all come running
But what about your love baby
Snap your fingers and they all come running
What are you thinking of baby

There you go up and down, in and out
What's another casual fling in the life of a groovy lover,
Underneath the covers
You hold on tighter still, to the thrill
What you wouldn't do for this
In your eyes you're so desensitzed
Traveling down the road alone
Really got it going on

Do you really have it all together,
I don't think so baby
I don't think that passion lasts forever, no no no

Snap your fingers and they all come running
But what about your love baby
Sanp your fingers and they all come running
What are you thinking of baby

[Rap:]
You got snakeskin boots, and raw silk suits
A big old house with lots of loot
Fancy cars with compact discs
And plenty of lips to kiss
You got leather and polished satin
You got that umpth, you're what's happening
You walk that walk, and talk that talk
But what about your love baby

Snakeskin, diamonds materialistic things baby yeah
Really kinda got it going on

You got cool boy
You got it all together
Snap your fingers and they all come running
I've been down that road a time or two
I've had my share of lovers just like you

[Rap:]
You got satin sheets, a penthouse suite
Diamonds in your rolex, honey
Materialistic things sonny
Snap your fingers and they come running fast
The old and young
Snap your fingers, but what about your love baby
