Ooh... hoo... hoo... hoo... hoo... hoo... yeah...

Last night I saw a shooting star fall from the sky
I thought of you and wished you here
I tried to see your face to free you in your dreams
But miracles need wings to fly

Do you understand a heart that beats for you
A love that knows no one but you
I say a little prayer each night and I try not to cry
'Cause miracles need wings to fly

{Miracles need wings to fly, wings to fly}
Miracles need wings to fly
Miracles need wings to fly
{Miracles need wings to fly, wings to fly}
Miracles need wings to fly

Last night I couldn't sleep, I didn't even try
I called your name so desperately {So desperately}
I tried to kiss your lips, invade your private dreams
But miracles need wings to fly

Do you understand the hurt that has no end
A love that wants to be more than just your friend
I say a little prayer at night and, yes, sometimes I sigh
'Cause miracles need wings to fly

{Miracles need wings to fly, wings to fly}
Miracles need wings to fly
Miracles need wings to fly
{Miracles need wings to fly, wings to fly}
Miracles need wings to fly

Do you understand my heart, understand my pain, listen
Do you understand, my dear, when you play those games
Do you understand my hurt, understand my care
Do you understand my mind, when I'm always there, oh

Miracles need wings to fly
And that's why
I keep my head up to the sky
Miracles need wings to fly
And that's why
Eagles spread their wings to the sky, oh, hey... hey... hey...

Miracles need wings to fly
And that's why
I keep my head up to the sky
Hey... hey... hey... keep your head to the sky (To the sky)
