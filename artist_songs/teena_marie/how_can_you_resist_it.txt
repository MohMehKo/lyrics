He had brunet hair with blond streaks
A different kind of fellow
Sitting on the road in New Orleans

He ate fillet gumbo, I think I ordered steak
I looked into his eyes and said
For Heaven's sake, listen to me
I got you need

I don't know what to do anymore
I've shown him all of my love and more

And I said stay by my side
Got your ticket to ride
And he blushed at my verbal logistics
And he shied but he came
As he asked me my name
And I said I am love
And how can you resist it

Poetry in motion but it don't pay no dues
And me, I'm always playing my rhythm and blues
Sitting on the road, Bourbon Street

I got country cousins they got a steely knife
But he doesn't want to settle down
For the rest of his life
So I'll just keep it cutting

I don't know what to do anymore
I've shown him all of my love and more

And I said stay by my side
Got your ticket to ride
And he blushed at my verbal logistics
And he shied but he came
As he asked me my name
And I said I am love
And how can you resist it

Now that you've kissed it
How can you resist it
If you go
I know you're gonna miss it
How can you resist it
After all
You told me that you wished it
How can you resist it
