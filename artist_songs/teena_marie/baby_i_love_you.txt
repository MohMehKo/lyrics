Baby I Love You (Baby... I Love You Baby)
Baby I Love You (Baby... Rolling thru the Shaw)
Baby I Love You (Baby... Westside)
Baby I Love You (I love you baby)

Late nite creeping down the blvd,
Rollin thru the shaw like ma and pa,
In my lap full of luxury, feeling free it's you and me
Just swing down, sweet chariot star
Give me one more hit of it
Because Yo love be the bomb

How do you like it? Tell me how it feels?
Say you love me baby
And now we're rolling up close on a brand new day
The love we have boy alway stays in my mind
Like a real fine wine... always tender
Just swing down, sweet chariot star
Give me one more hit of it cause this love be the bomb

It came down on me like a rain storm,
Glissens and dances
Drippin like dew drops from silver saxs
Hollywood player, sweet ear candy licks
Sexy jb pump sounds in the background
Calm down baby baby
I got you open like a door make you holler for more
Sweet things on the killin floor
Make love not war for sure

How do you like it? Tell me how it feels?
Say you love me baby
And now we're Late nite creeping down the blvd,
Rollin thru the shaw like ma and pa,
In my lap full of luxury, feeling free it's you and me
Just swing down, sweet chariot star
Give me one more hit of it
Because Yo love be the bomb

I make you feel good. I make you feel real good
Whenever we're together.
Chillin in the cut, Philly blunt like december
Mix it in my blender.
Make it mo better mo better
It's weak my baby when your not around
And I'm weak so weak when your putting it down on me
You be the amproshia I swill, diggin on x factor
Swear I will

How do you like it? Tell me how it feels?
Say you love me baby
And now we're rolling up close on a brand new day
The love we have boy alway stays on my mind
Like a real fine wine... always tender
Just swing down, sweet chariot star
Give me one more hit of it cause this love be the bomb

Crystal and cream these dreams are made of
Curled up on the sofa where we just made love
Sometimes a lil risk ain't never too nasty
What do you want? Oh Baby just ask me.
I love it when you whisper Lady T in my ear

How do you like it? Tell me how it feels?
Say you love me baby
And now we're Late nite creeping down the blvd,
Rollin thru the shaw like ma and pa,
In my lap full of luxury, talk to me baby please
Swing down, sweet chariot star
Give me one more hit of it
Because Yo love be the bomb

Baby I love you, say you love me too
Here's what we gone do...
Just build a nice house with an ocean view
