[Verse 1:]
Today I watched your diamonds
Sparkling in the sand
God whispered to me
Everything's alright
She's a lot like you
That girl – she's special and...
Have you forgotten,
When you was throwin caution to the wind?

[Bridge:]
You were young and free
Three things from the wise
Hush now, let it be
If she comes back to you
You will always know
That you have to make her much more beautiful

[Chorus:]
Beautiful,
My baby – she's so beautiful
She sees down deep inside of my soul
She's so beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful,
She's something like the summer rain
She gently plays her rhythms on my window pane
My baby's beautiful, my baby's lovely

[Verse 2:]
Tonight I had a movement
Here inside my hands
My tiny deserve
I don't have all the answers baby but you
Your fruit's like paradise
Little girl you're special and
So young and so restless
Sweet thing makes me breathless like the wind

[Bridge:]
You were young and free
Three things from the wise
Hush now, let it be
If she comes back to you
You will always know
That you have to make her much more beautiful

[Chorus:]
Beautiful,
My baby – she's so beautiful
She sees down deep inside of my soul
She's so beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful,
She's something like the summer rain
She gently plays her rhythms on my window pane
My baby's beautiful, my baby's lovely

[Verse 3:]
If she was a flower then she'd be a perfect rose
If she was a river then her heart would overflow
She sees inside of my soul
She takes me high and low
'Cause she's so beautiful

[Interlude:]
You're beautiful, beautiful
You're beautiful
You're beautiful, baby
My baby
Beautiful
She's something like the summer rain
She gently plays her rhythms on my window pane
My baby's beautiful, my baby's lovely

[Outro:]
You're beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful
You're beautiful
Girl, you're beautiful
Yea, you're beautiful
You're so beautiful
Yea, you're beautiful
Beautiful, girl you're beautiful
You're so beautiful
And girl you're beautiful
You're so beautiful
Girl, you're beautiful
You're so beautiful
Girl, you're beautiful
Yea, you're beautiful
