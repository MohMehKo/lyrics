Creep, creep, creep,
Creep, creep, creep,

Baby's got another girl,
'Cross town by the tracks,
Baby likes to sleep around,
Well I guess I shoulda asked,
Lipstick on your collar baby,
Y'all know that's not my shade,
My phone's been ringing off the hook,
And I got hang-up calls for days.

Please don't stand so close to me,
I know you're lying,
Please don't kiss my neck baby,
I know you're cheating,
Please don't say another word,
I can't hear ya,
Your voice'll make me sleep with the enemy,
The way you talk silky soft,
Your touch'll make me sleep with the enemy,
I can't resist when we kiss,
Your hands'll make me sleep with the enemy,
In other words it's a shame,
Be careful not to sleep with the enemy,
Sometimes I just don't know my name.

Baby's like a sex machine,
He got limbs that's made of steel,
Got a six-pack showing strong,
And I like the way it feels,
What's that perfume I been smelling?
Y'all know that's not my scent,
You got a whole lot going on,
And it's more than just the rent.

Please don't push up on me boy,
I know you're cheating,
Please don't kiss my lips baby,
'Cause you been creeping,
Pelase don't say another word,
I can't hear you,
Your voice'll make me sleep with the enemy,
The way you talk silky-soft,
Your touch'll make me sleep with the enemy,
I can't resist when we kiss,
Your hands'll make me sleep with the enemy,
In other words it's a shame,
Be carfeul when you sleep with the enemy,
Sometimes I just don't know my name.

Feel so good to me, it must be a sin,
Somebody hold me back I'm giving in, yeah,
And if the man would ever leave I'd rather be blind,
Somebody call the doctor I'm about to loose my mind.

Creep, creep, creep,
Shit, baby,
Creep, creep, creep.

Your voice'll make me sleep with the enemy,
The way you talk silky-soft,
Your touch'll make me sleep with the enemy,
I can't resist when we kiss,
Your hands'll make me sleep with the enemy,
In other words it's a shame, baby,
Be carfeul when you sleep with the enemy,
Your life just might not be the same.

Now that I have made my bed,
I gotta lie in it,
Truth be told, don't say a word,
'Cause I ain't buying it,
I can't be blamed,
It's a shame, the way you make me feel,
You know your touch is just a tease,
I'm sleeping with the enemy.

Don't stand so close to me,
When you try to get the last kiss,
I know your moves,
Don't touch me, don't push up on me,
I can't avoid you,
Boy, you got me going in circles.
