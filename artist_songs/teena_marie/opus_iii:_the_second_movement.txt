I remember your songs
And they were timeless Minnie
The perfect melody
You were the sweet and soulful bird
And you left a fire Marvin
Here in the darkness
To light my life
To lift my voice
To bring some peace
Into my world
Kyrie Elieson
Christie Elieson
I love you Lord, you heard my cry
And pitied every groan Donny
As long as I live
Whilst trouble rise
I'll hasten to your throne...
