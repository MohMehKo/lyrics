Everybody says that you're so beautiful
From the inside to the out
My precious jewel
I hope that I can give you all the love you need
I'd lay down my life for ya baby, yes indeed

High Yellow girl
Golden lady fair, with hair, like lamb's wool
High yellow child
So familiar to me, like the river Nile

I lie awake at night sometimes my eyes get full
How did I deserve such love from an angel
Oh, the lovely simple thangs, your soul rushing
The sun rises and sets on ya baby, blessed be

High yellow girl
Skin like clover honey, eyes like mother's soul
High yellow child
One half dark like daddy, one half mama bright

So familiar to me (you look like me)
Your smile, it reminds me of every aromatic saffron
High yellow child, Yellow child high

Patiently, I waited, for so long, I prayed
And my sweet Jesus sent me you on Christmas day
Last night I picked up my guitar, chile I'm feelin you
What can I give to my daughter, hey y'all, tell the truth

High yellow girl
Golden lady fair, with hair like lamb's wool
High yellow child
So familiar through me, like the river Nile

So familiar to me, your smile
It reminds me of aromatic saffron
High yellow child, Yellow child high
They call here Mello Yellow
Cause her skin is caramel
They call her Mellow Yellow
Cause her skin is caramel
High Yellow child
