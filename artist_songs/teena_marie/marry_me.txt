Baby, baby, baby, I, I love you, yeah
And just to make you love, I played the fool
But lately I been thinking something's missing, baby
With me & you, what can I do?

11 years have come & gone, so quickly, baby
And yet my wedding finger still is bare
All that's left is just a faded promise that you made
I guess that proves that all in love is fair

[Chorus:]
Pay attention baby, it's my turn to do the talking
This might be the last thing that I say fore I start walking
Whatcha gotta do, Whatcha gotta do, Whatcha gotta do
You got to marry me, marry me, marry me, baby, yeah
And make a respectable woman out of me

It doesn't have to be expensive, baby
Maybe something sacred, down by the shore
Just our closest friends, family, and children
And one thing more (naw, wait a minute) no, two things more
I'd like to hear the wedding march played sweetly, baby
That much for tradition in our lives
Maybe you could pop your collar when the preacher asks
Do you take this woman for your wife?

[Chorus:]
Pay attention baby, it's my turn to do the talking
This might be the last thing that I say fore I start walking
Whatcha gotta do, Whatcha gotta do, Whatcha gotta do
You got to marry me, marry me, marry me, baby, yeah
And make a respectable woman out of me, out of me, baby
You got to marry me, marry me, marry me, baby, yeah
And make a respectable woman out of me

Who's gonna love u when your hair turns gray, baby?
Who's gonna love in that special way?
Pay attention baby, it's my turn to do the talking
This might be the last thing that I say fore I start walking

Whatcha gotta do, Whatcha gotta do, Whatcha gotta do, boy, my lord
I need something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue
I'm talking to u boy, hear me

Whatcha gotta do, Whatcha gotta do, Whatcha gotta do
You got to marry me, marry me, marry me, baby, yeah
And make a respectable woman out of me, out of me
Marry me, baby, you got to marry me, marry me, marry me, baby, yeah
And make a respectable woman out of me

I don't think u heard me, I'm gon say it one more gain
Marry me, marry me, marry me, baby, yeah
And make a respectable woman out of me
