We were rich and we were poor
Two children playing grown-up games
The prince and the princess
You loved me hard-just like a rock
I threw away your building blocks
And left you with silence

And now I'd trade one day of wealth and fame
For just one model airplane
Where is the love that you made me

If I had Aladdin's lamp, here is what I'd do
I'd rub Aladdin's lamp until Aladdin's lamp turned into you
La la la

You used to write me poetry
And emerald city love songs
The jest and the jester
And somewhere in your nursery rhymes
I found and lost my innocence
And what could be better

And now we live in separate worlds
But here inside I'm still your little girl
Where is the love that you made me

If I had Aladdin's lamo, here is what I'd do
I'd rub Aladdin's lamp until Aladdin's lamp turned into you
La la la
If I had Aladdin's lamp, here is what I'd do
I'd rub that magic lamp until Aladdin's lamp turned into you
If I had Aladdin's lamp, here is what I'd do
I'd rub that lamp, Aladdin bring him back

And ooh wherever you are, this one's for you baby
Ohh ooh-maybe that will express what I'm going through
Aladdin, I'm gonna rub all over you, rub me rub, ooh
I need some magic words while I'm alone
I'm feeling like a saxaphone
