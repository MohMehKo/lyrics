Morning whispers to me unaware
I awake to fingers floating softly through my hair
Paradise this feeling being lost inside of you
An adventure in the raw a phantasm for two

You say you love me with your eyes
My heart soars up to the skies
And it's all so crazy
What you do to me, baby

You make love like springtime
And I can't control my passion
You make love like springtime
Even when love's not in fashion

I love you so and I can't let go of you
Ooh la la la ooh la baby ooh la la oui

Poetry in motion teach my spirit dove
No words need be spoken I know what you're dreaming of
Like this song I wear your love like heaven on my breast
Rainbow colors all so pure I feel like I've been blessed

You say you love me with your eyes
My heart soars up to the skies
And it's all so crazy
What you do to me, baby

You make love like springtime
And I can't control my passion
You make love like springtime
Even when love's not in fashion

I love you so and I can't let go of you
Ooh la la la ooh la baby ooh la la oui
You're making love to me like oooh

You know that you made so happy
I couldn't leave you if I tried
I had a dream and it was you
I made a wish and you made it come true

You're making love to me like springtime
I thank the Lord above you're mine
You're making love to me like summer
I'll never need no other lover
You're making love to me like autumn
Your love will never be forgotten
You're making love to me like winter
I thank the Lord when we're together
You're making love to me like springtime
I thank the Lord above you're mine hey...
