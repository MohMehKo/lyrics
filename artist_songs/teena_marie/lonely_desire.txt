Hey you, back there!
Crying out in dark despair
Your spark-long gone
Did it vanish like the light of dawn

You lied-you tried
Playing it off like it don't hurt you
You used to be so full of fire
Now all that's left is lonely desire

Lonely desire-who put out your fire
Lonely desire-who put out your fire

Why do-you do
All the things that you despise
Your ways so crazed
I could have told you they were born to die

Your heart bleeds-weak knees
Playin it off is so hard to do
You used to be so full of fire
Now all that's left is lonely desire

Lonely desire-who put out your fire
Lonely desire-who put out your fire

Oh did you know I saw what I pretended not to see
I saw you
You ought to think about it
You ought to let me get close to you

Let me start your fire
Let me start your fire
Let me start your fire
I'll put an end to this lonely desire, baby

Oh did you know I saw what I pretended not to see
I saw you
You ought to think about it
You ought to let me get close to you

Adlib... sho do sho do-
You need lovin' too
Let me start your fire
