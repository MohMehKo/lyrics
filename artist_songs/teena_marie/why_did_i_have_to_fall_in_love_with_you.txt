Some say you're shy but I think differently
It's really just that you're unsure of me
Some say that I'm a woman of the world
But all I want to be is your girl

Loving you has made me feel a million things
I've never felt in love before
You got the nicest smile and when I hear you speak
I go crazy, I'm so weak

Why did I have to fall in love with you
Why did I have to fall in love with you
Oooh I've got a real good lovin' for you baby

Some say you're just a picture on my wall
They think that I don't want your love at all
Some say I'm fickle and I'll soon forget
But they don't know my match has finally been lit

Loving you has made me feel a million things
I've never felt in love before
You got the nicest smile and I quiver when you speak
I go crazy, I'm so weak

Why did I have to fall in love with you
Why did I have to fall in love with you
I go crazy for your lovin' baby...
