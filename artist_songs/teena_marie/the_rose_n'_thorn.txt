Still my heart the dawn is filled with tears
I never thought that I would find you here
Wait for me be merciful be kind
Embrace the joy in pain when love is blind

And if you cry just know that I would never say goodbye
If you speak of me just by chance
Or hear me calling through your next romance
I am the thorn that wants to be the closest to the rose you are
Kind of blue be virtuous at best
To know the pain of too much tenderness

And if you cry
Just know that I could never tell a lie
If you hear my voice just by chance
Or feel me touch you in a lover's dance
I am the thorn that wants to be the closest to the rose you are
I am the thorn that wants to be the closest to the rose you are

And if you cry
Just know that I would never say goodbye
If you speak of me just by chance
Or hear me calling through your next romance
I am the thorn that wants to be the closest to the rose you are
I am the thorn that wants to be the closest to the rose you are

It's always darkest just before the dawn
