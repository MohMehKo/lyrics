If I had a castle by the ocean
A crown of jewels to place upon your head
Then I'd build a dynasty
From the north to south end seas
And I'd make you my once and future king

If I had a coat of many colors
Warm enough to wrap you in when the winter wind sets in
Then I'd fly you eagle free, faster than your destiny
And I'd love you my once and future queen

Tell me that you love me, one more time
Lady, it feels so good to hear you say you're mine
Yes, it's true, I'll love you one more time and I'll,
I'll never go, I'll never leave, I'm gonna give you all of me

You will always be my once and future dream
Oh baby, sing out, say it again
You will always be my once and future dream
Oh, lady-lady, ough-girl

If I swam so deep into the ocean
And I found Atlantis or the Kingdom of Neptune
Then I'd give them both to you
And darling, if that didn't do
Then I'd give you my once and future dream

Tell me that you love me, one more time
Baby, it feels good to hear you say you're mine
Yes, it's true, I'll love you one more time and I'll,
I'll never go, I'll never leave, I'm gonna give you all of me

You will always be my once and future dream
Oh, I wanna talk about your love, tell you darling
Baby, you will always be my once and future dream
Oh-oh baby, o-oh girl

You are my dream
Somewhere in time
You are my dream
Where eagles spread their wings to fly
You are my dream
When you were the sparkle and you were the tear in my eye
You are my dream
I don't need nobody else, but you, baby
You are my dream

And if I give my world to you,
Then you will always be, always be, my love

My once and future dream,
My all, my everything, oh love, oh love,
I wanna talk about your love, tell you darling
Baby, you will, always, you will always,
Be my once and future dream

Future dream, future dream
You will always,
Be my special love,
Be my future love,
Be my one and only love, oo-ohh
Ooo, you will always, be my girl, be my, be my,
Once and future dream

I'll see you in my dreams
