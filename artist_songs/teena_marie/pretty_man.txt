Pretty man you've got the world in the
Palm of your hands
You pass me by my eyes they cry from too much passion
Pretty boy if I could just be your favorite toy
I'd play for free, come undress me in tender fashion
Pretty man - so suave could you be my love
You are so fine - so tall and tan my pretty man
Ooo- as warm as the sunswets on the desert sands
You touched my hand and my world stood still
A beauty I could not describe
You just take my breath away
Te quiero much y mi vida es tuya
Mi vida es solamente tuya, tuya

Hombre orgulloso tu tienes el mundo en tu palma
Tu me pasas y mis ojos lloran con tanta passion
Hombre galante si pudiera ser tu amante
Me entriego a ti cuerpo y alma sere tu calor
Pretty man - so suave could yo be my love
You are so fine - so tall and tan my pretty man
Ooo - an sweet as ambrosia
The gods have blessed me with
Your milk and honey ways
My life is yours alone, you are poetry,
You are music
You are my heart
Te quiero mucho y mi vida es tuya
Mi vida es solamente tuya, tuya
