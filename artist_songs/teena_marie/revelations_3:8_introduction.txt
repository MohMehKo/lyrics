I woke up, this morning, thinking of you
The silence spoke to me, I was speakin to you
Not diggin' the ways of the World
Becoming deeper in you
Recieved gift of life like my little girl,
Now I'm breathin' for you
A unconditional Love, arms around me
Giving spiritual hugs,
Through the prophets, you sendin your Love
In it, I find Salvation, from hearts and minds, it's sacred
Your Kingdom is near, and I can taste it...
