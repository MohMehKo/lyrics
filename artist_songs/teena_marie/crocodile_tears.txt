Tears on your pillow falling down around you everywhere
What makes you think that after all this time I really care
I used to think you were the sweetest guy on earth
But now, in fact I see
All these nights I waited for you, you were ripping, running
In the streets
And now, you're crying Crocodile Tears
Keep on crying Crocodile Tears
Tell you story sob sad
Keep on cryin crocodile Tears
'Cause it's driving you mad
Lipstick and perfume saturate your clothing, it's not mine
Don't look surprised boy
Thinking that I'm not the hurting kind
I ran into an old friend
And she told me 'bout a guy whose love was true
And then I saw a snapshot and I guess you know
The picture was of you
Keep on Crying Crocodile Tears
Tell you story sob sad
Keep on cryin Crocodile Tears
'Cause it's drivin you mad
What makes you think that I'm still in love with you
After all this time
How can you stand there and say you love me too
When I know you're out of your mind

[spoken:]
(Huh you've got to be kidding
Do you want one violin or the whole orchestra
Tears-yeah, That's the ticket-big ones
But, I think I'll just give you one violin)

My Darling, I loved you so
'Cause I loved you with a passion
And I loved you with a love you know was true
And I loved you with conviction
Tears make you think that I still could love you true
After all this time
How can you stand there and say you love me too
When I know you're out of your mind
[ad lib:] Keep on crying Crocodile tears
Tell your story, Tell your story
Keep on crying Crocodile Tears
Tell your story, Tell your story
Tears, Crocodile Tears-Mega-Tears-Big Ones
Good-bye baby good-bye-Let's call it a day
