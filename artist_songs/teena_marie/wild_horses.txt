Gee whiz but you look so good to me
And it's funny how it gets me every time
When we kiss a thousand different feelings cross my mind

Touch me and it don't take no time to make me over
And it's plain to see
That every little bit of you lives inside of me

[Chorus:]
Time after time you give 'em to me
Those butterflies got me spinning likea top
I don't want to stop baby I'm
I'm like a puppet on a string - And
Wild horses can't keep me away
Wild horses can't keep me away
Wild horses can't keep me away
Wild horses

Keep me away - from you my baby
No chance 'cause I've traveled fast through time
Just for you to be here with me blowing my mind
And it is going to take me about a thousand years baby
Just to let you know, that this love will never die
And no one could ever make me tell you goodbye

[Chorus]
