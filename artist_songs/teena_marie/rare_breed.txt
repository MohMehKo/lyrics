[Intro:]
This one is for all the ladies
This one is for all the sexy ladies
This one is for all the ladies
This one is for all the sexy ladies

[Verse 1:]
I could say that I was born with maids and servants at my feet
But everything I ever tasted in this life is sweet
I could say a silver spoon was in my mouth when I appeared
And the queen of England whispered to me in this very ear
She said

[Pre-Chorus:]
My lips, my eyes
The way I'm ridin'
My heart, my soul
I'll do it till I
I'm satisfied,
My very essence
The way I dance

[Chorus: x2]
Baby I'm a rare breed
Do you know what a lover needs
Baby I'm a rare breed
I'm that special one

[Verse 2:]
I could say they broke the moon
That day my mama gave me breath
Unless I do it my way from my birth until my death
I can say I had the world here in my hands and I believe
The angels step beside me to protect my very dreams
And they said

[Pre-Chorus:]
My lips, my eyes
The way I'm ridin'
My heart, my soul
I'll do it till I
I'm satisfied,
My very essence
The way I dance

[Chorus: x2]
Baby I'm a rare breed
Do you know what a lover needs
Baby I'm a rare breed
I'm that special one

[Bridge:]
'Cause I was born to be wild baby
And I like to play
I said I like to play
'Cause I'm find your instrument baby
It's in my DNA
It's in my DNA

[Verse 3:]
Tell 'em who you roll with
Tell 'em how you ride
Tell 'em 'bout your slick brick
Do it
Tell 'em who you be with
Yes I'm gonna find
Coming up as a Shawty in the fast lane
Baby I'm for real

I could say that I was royalty
And this too would be true
'Cause I lived on the west side baby
And I rode for you
I could say that I'm one of the baddest ladies in this game
And if you wanna write it down
Then don't forget my name
'Cause I said

[Pre-Chorus:]
My lips, my eyes
The way I'm ridin'
My heart, my soul
I'll do it till I
I'm satisfied,
My very essence
The way I dance

[Chorus: x4]
Baby I'm a rare breed
Do you know what a lover needs
Baby I'm a rare breed
I'm that special one
