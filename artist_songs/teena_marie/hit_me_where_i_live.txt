On the Venus rocks
Yeah, huh
Just me, the master
And my box
Blues and sounds
Decimals high
I fly above this hood
That wears me

Venus, Harlem baby
So you could shake it
So you could shake it

I know a guy his name is Doug
He plays the bottom
Cuts the rug
I love to hug that jitterbug

He swam around in circles till
He found the inside of my web
And now no secret's left to tell

He said James
What the people say
Penny for your thoughts
She came from Velo
That's below the farm

She drive across town
And she'd teach me how to give
She be in deep places
And it hit me where I live

Hit me where I live
I tell ya somethin'
That I love my rhythm
Mixed up with my blues

Hit me where I live
I'm tryin' to tell ya
That we're joined here at the hip and side
Like glue
Ooh

Chocolate sister, name is mick
So artistic with her tricks
She holds my notes
Sings all my licks

Movies, yardbird
We be fed
Collard greens and sweet cornbread
Let's hide the brooms under the bed

He said James
What the people say
Penny for your thoughts
That's Brooklyn bubblegum
Hey bring the sauce

He came from chi town
And he mixed my Shhh real good
He be in deep places
And it hit me where it should

Hit me where I live
I tell ya somethin'
That I love my rhythm
Mixed up with my blues

Hit me where I live
I'm tryin' to tell ya
That we're joined here at the hip and side
Like glue

Take me to the bridge (James)
It's just over the ridge
If you don't ain't that a bitch
Cause I need to scratch this itch
Now you choked up on this crunk
I ain't never been no punk
Just like two skunks in a trunk
Gonna drive you off into some funk

Yeah
I'm sendin' this one out to chocolate city
And all it's vanilla suburbs
We do be workin' music all night long
We do be workin'
We do be workin' music all night long
So you can shake it

Hit me where I live
I'll tell you su'in
That I love my rhythm
Mixed up with my blues

Hit me where I live
I'm trying to tell you
That we're joined here at the hip
And side like glue

James what the people say
Penny for your thoughts
I be from Venus that's down by the rocks
I been around the way
A legend in my hood
I been in deep places
And I know that it's all good

We do be workin' music all night long
We do be workin'
We do be workin' music all night long
So you can shake it

Yo Mick, remember that time
We went to see tower of power
You had on that three piece suit
And a sprinkler's
Runnin' across your face

Big ups to you
You'll always be my boo
