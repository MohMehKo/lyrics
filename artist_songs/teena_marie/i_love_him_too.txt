[Teena Marie:]
Aw naw, I don't believe this
There's a new girl in town
Is your name De De O'Neal?

[De De:]
Yeah, that's me.
They call me Cognac

[Teena Marie:]
You know you've got a lot of nerve comin' up in here in
My party

[De De:]
Oh, no disrespect Miss Teena
Evidently, you've got something to say to me
So say it, girl
Bring it!

What makes you think...
That I'm peace enough to stand by
And let you take my man from me
And what makes you so sure that he's in love with you?
Cause anytime he wants to, get love
He's making love to me
You feelin' me?

[Teena Marie:]
You're just a young girl
With stars in your eyes
I don't think you even understand it, De De
Or that you realize
I give him all my precious time
And maybe I've been a bit too blind
But for last 7 years or so, you see
He's been making love to me
Do you understand me?

I love him too
Just as much... if not maybe more than you do
Don't be no fool

[De De:]
I love him too
And if you think I'm going to give him up

[Teena Marie & De De:]
Then you're a fool

[De De:]
You better think about the consequences

[Teena Marie:]
You better think about the mind and common senses

[De De:]
You better think about the things that I can bare

[Teena Marie:]
You better think about my child that's on the way

[De De:]
You better think about the lovin' game, I'm not here to play

[Teena Marie:]
You better think of right now you're in my domain

[Teena Marie & De De:]
You better think

[Teena Marie:]
You better think and stop believing in all the trust cause

[Teena Marie & De De:]
He's been making love to us

[Teena Marie:]
What a revelation

[De De:]
And I love him too

[Teena Marie & De De:]
Just as much

[Teena Marie:]
If not maybe more than you do

[De De:]
Don't be no fool

[Teena Marie:]
I love him too

[Teena Marie & De De:]
And if you think I'm going to give him up

[Teena Marie:]
You've lost a screw
Don't be no fool

[Teena Marie:]
Listen, you'd better think again, girl
You'd better think again
Cause I love my baby, love my baby

[De De:]
You'd better think again, sister girl
You'd better think again
Cause I love that man
Hey don't you know, he's mine

[Teena Marie:]
And if I haven't broke it down and tied it to you, dear

DeDe: Yeah yeah yeah

[Teena Marie & De De:]
Then, let me make this crystal clear
Just so you know where I'm coming from

[De De:]
Woman-to-woman

[Teena Marie:]
Woman-to-woman

[De De:]
I love him too

[Teena Marie:]
I love him, I love him, too
Just as much if not maybe more than you do

[De De:]
I love him too

[Teena Marie:]
I love him, I love him
You better think about the consequences

[De De:]
You better think about the mind and common senses

[Teena Marie:]
You better think about the things that I can bare

[De De:]
You better think of right now you're in my domain
