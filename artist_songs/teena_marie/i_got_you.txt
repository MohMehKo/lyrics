Don't worry bout it boo

It was the age of aquarius
At the start of pices
Just before the dawn
Turnin' me on
You was the bomb
Steppin' to me
Here comes the real G

You stepped to me like a warrior
Braids all down your back
You sure could fire it up
Throwin' it down
Bustin' it up
Under your - [Help! What's this word? ]

You be my bitter and my sweetness, baby
That's fo' sho'
My power and my weakness
Honey there's mo'
I tried to get away but I could never be
Freeeee...

You know the way I take it
You understand it
Don't worry bout it boo

It was a time for miracles
Dreams and visions seemed to come true
Whenever we wished them to
Didn't they baby?
Yeah, you were so young and so nice
And couldn't believe what a cassanova
Brown skinned man like me
Want to do for you
You were my passion and my pleasure
And you were my pain
I tried to school you
And to rule you and make you tame
I tried to teach you
But you didn't wanna play the game
With me, oh no

You know the way I like it
The way I need it
I got you, don't worry bout shhh...
You know the way I want it
The way I feel it
I got you, don't worry bout shhh...
You know the way I dig it
The way I planned it
I got you, don't worry bout shhh...
You know the way I take it
You understand it
Don't worry bout it boo
Because I got you

Just call my name
I'm gonna be there for ya baby
It's you that I love baby
I'll be right by your side
I wouldn't be me without ya baby
I wouldn't be free without ya baby
I wouldn't be free
Oh oh oh baby baby baby baby...
I wouldn't be free
I wouldn't feel the things I
Feel and baby no

I wouldn't have
This kind of passion in my soul
I would have never been as cold as icy snow
I would have never left my home
(Rick continues to say "and my Blow")
Buffalo, no no
(Teena says the Buffalo
They think they're slick)
You be my bitter and my sweetness
My power and my weakness
And there's mo'
I tried to get away
But I could never really be free
