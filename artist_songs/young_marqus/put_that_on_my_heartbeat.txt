[Young Marqus:]
And I put that on my heartbeat
Together yeah we shall be
Above where the clouds be
Together no matter what any hater compare us to
Fly to England and Paris
I got your back no embarrassments
You say you trust me
I'm saying ditto
You say you miss me
I'm saying ditto
You say you like me why singing it is soprano
Don't harmonize much but I write it down in piano
Our future brighter than Time Square
Appreciate it whenever it's time shared
And girl we hotter than nine layers
It makes greatness whenever we make our minds share
It's kinda rare to find an everyday valentine
Now we ain't gotta talk about it like a pantomime
Taking private vacations out there in Santomire
And bring her back to Georgia
I got her feelin like Atlanta's mine

[Chorus - Jacob Latimore:]
Oooooh
Don't listen to them words, they hating undercover
Ooooh there it go
In one ear and right out the other
Ooooh you know
Misery loves company
Right into the sky baby
I swear I'd never leave your side baby
I put that on my heartbeat
I put that on my heartbeat
Put that on my heartbeat (oh-oh, yeah) [x2]
Put that on my heartbeat

[Young Marqus:]
Like an artery with no blood in it
That's what I am without you
Like a spirit with no soul
A soul with no heart
A heart with no body
And I put that on my heartbeat we'll never be apart
I'll be your light when there is darkness
And I know you've heard of Marqus
And I know you heard he's coming up like stairs in apartments
I'm just joking baby, nah I ain't arrogant
Pull up in a phantom ghost
Look how they stare at it
Look how they stare at us
You be shining and glistening
A couple a diamonds and crystals
Girl you the bomb and some missiles
Oh you smiling girl
Tell me what you're thinking bout
You can tell me anything and we can think it out
I hope I be the same dude that you read about
In the Forbes list, I swear baby you're gorgeous
Look at that chick
Girl you bad, know that I got ya babe

[Chorus]

Look at that chick
Girl you bad
Know that I got ya babe
I really wanna kiss you
Cause you looking like something I ain't ever had [x2]

[Chorus]

If you see what I see, put it on my heartbeat baby [x4]
