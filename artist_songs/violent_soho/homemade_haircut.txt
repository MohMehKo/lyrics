Wake up
You've been dreaming again of the news
Tired times
You're confused
[?] for days
I'll never leave this house
I swear
He blew up half of the school
With the fire cracker
It's true
He laughs to the girls that he likes
Fuck that he's got a homemade haircut

Take me down into the underground
Tastes so sweet it's just a simple sound
They won't swallow me whole
This school's gonna suck by soul

Complain
He's stuck in his own fair game
Back and forth in his mind
With mud wiped over his face
Fuck that he's got a homemade haircut

Take me down into the underground
Tastes so sweet it's just a simple sound
They won't swallow me whole
This school's gonna suck by soul

Stop digging trying to find your soul
They stole it and fed it to all their wolves
Soldiers walk around in circles
Soldiers walk around in circles
Waiting for all their lives to surface
[?]
They'll keep wishing that god shows up
They'll keep wishing for friendly fire
The home haircut that saved us all
The home haircut that saved us all
Now it's time to take the fall
Now it's time to surface
