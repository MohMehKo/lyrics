You're not the Alpha Omega
I want my Heaven but Heaven's not real
(They said, they said)

Give me the pastor of violence illusions are false but yours is the best
(They said, they said)

I spoke to god
On the last day
He gave me my answer with reason instead
We used up the powder, blew it into your graves
Just give me away, just give me away

Can’t stop
The eye-saw appearing
Give it your best son but you’ll fail in the end
(Again, again)

Ears drop
The mess, oh the reasons
I got no feelings
But feelings aren’t real
(Again, again)

I spoke to god
On the last day
He gave me my answer with reason instead
We used up the powder, blew it into your graves
Just give me away, just give me away

I close my eyes hear the world turn to dust
I’m a father’s son
Born to the middle class
I use a gun and put it to our name
Just give me away
Just give me away

Shut up

I am a fan of all the angels, flying round my head
But I can’t see the light
I’ll whither, wither here

Woah

It’s you, it’s you, it’s you, it’s you
It’s you, it’s you, it’s you, it’s you
It’s you, it’s you, it’s you, it’s you
It’s you, it’s you, it’s you, it’s you
