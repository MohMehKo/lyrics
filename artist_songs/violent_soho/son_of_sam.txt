Followin' the queue
And take your hat off
The emptiness in you
Innate fake drama

Beautiful girl, you got a hole in your heart
Sitting pretty till the world tore apart
You were the Son Of Sam
No one cares or even understands

Lift your hands in praise
And eat your answers
Dragged by all your curls
Happy dead laughter

Beautiful girl, you got a hole in your heart
Sitting pretty till the world tore apart
You were the Son Of Sam
No one cares or even understands at all

The city took my only love
The end of the line, the beat and the hum
You look so pretty in the light of the night
The only joy, the sound of her lung

Beautiful girl, you got a hole in your heart
Sitting pretty till the world tore apart
You were the Son Of Sam
No one cares of even understands

Beautiful girl, you got a hole in your heart
Sitting pretty till the world tore apart
You were the Son Of Sam
No one cares or even understands

Beautiful girl, you got a hole in your heart
Sitting pretty till the world tore apart
You were the Son Of Sam
No one cares or even understands
