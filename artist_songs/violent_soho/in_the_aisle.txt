He waves to the locals, while he walks around
Draggin' a cricket bat in the ground
Sucker for slackers, glory and rage
Waiting for god. Waiting for god

He yells gibberish to pick a good fight
Breaks his head into a wall every night
Free up the country for glory and rage
Waiting for god. Waiting for god

Why does everything you say sound hollow?
Why does everything you say sound hollow?

Waiting for drug fucks to carry him home
Sunk to the carpet, it's eating him whole
Nihilist pop shit won't leave him alone
Waiting for god. Waiting for god

I wish you would only exist in my mind
Away from the world and the feelings inside
Great pretender that leaves you behind
Waiting for god. Waiting for god

Why does everything you say sound hollow?
Why does everything you say sound hollow?

Why does everything you say sound hollow?
(Why does everything you say sound)
Why does everything you say sound hollow?
(Why does everything you say sound)
