Killjoy
You're like a rhinestone pickup line
My drunk guitar's more fun than you'll ever be
Dear God
You're a monologue repeater
A computer is a better friend than I'll ever be (than I'll ever be)

I ditched you Saturday night
Cause I want you to know
Take a photograph
It's going to last longer
I feel so temporary
Like some viceroy asshole maybe

Yeah
King or the viceroys
Yeah
King or the viceroys
King or the viceroys

Oh God
Give it up the charisma
This cold call waving is a sign of a weaker disease

I ditched you Saturday night
Cause I want you to know
Take a photograph, it's going to last longer
I feel so temporary
Like some viceroy asshole maybe

Yeah
King or the viceroys
Yeah
King or the viceroys

Why want it
Why need it
Why guess it
Can't help me
God help me
God help me
I am my own and so are you
King or the viceroys
King or the viceroys
King or the yeah
King or the viceroys
King or the
King or the shit
