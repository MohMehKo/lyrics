I dropped and I hit the floor
Cold pavement rubbed my leg and left me low
That bleed, a bit of extra salt
Tough motherfucker thinks he owns the world

I'm leaving this for the martyrs
I'm leaving this I'm through
Wrap me like a blanket
Cover me I'm through

I'm leaving this for the brawlers
I'm leaving this I'm through
Throw me in the river
Somebody cut me loose

Well I'm gonna take my time
And I'm gonna live my life
Someone recognise this
Somebody cut me dry

Throw me in the river
Let them fall don't lie
I won't recognise this
I'll be a sacrifice

C'mon don't leave me out to dry
This Tory conference is going all night

I'm leaving this for the martyrs
I'm leaving this I'm through
Wrap me like a blanket
Cover me I'm through

I'm leaving this for the brawlers
I'm leaving this I'm through
Throw me in the river
Somebody cut me loose

[x2]
Well I'm gonna take my time
And I'm gonna live my life
Someone recognise this
Somebody cut me dry

Throw me in the river
Let them fall don't lie
I won't recognise this
I'll be a sacrifice

I'm leaving this for the brawlers
I'm leaving this I'm through
Throw me in the river
Somebody cut me loose

Don't want to let you down
Don't want to let you down
Don't want to let you down
