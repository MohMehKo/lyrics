Down by the quarry
Smoke towers suck up all the sunlight
All the trees sway back and forth
You can hear them bend

Just let me rest now
Skyscrapers can crumble tomorrow
I felt the ghost now
Touch my hand while I lay in this water

No one can take me from this home
No one to take a photograph
This picture wont' last

Let me rest now
Just wanna float in American water
I felt the ghost now
Touch my hand while I lay in this water

We don't last long anyway
Oh God
