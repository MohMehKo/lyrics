With a cross between her legs
She went to say her final vow
Brushed her hair aside with oil
And in your head you made a smile

But they don't know, they don't care
They don't even understand
And they sigh while the sleep
The prayers will stay beneath their sheets

You say the universe is weak
But in your head, you bend your knees

In her eyes, you saw the highest of the highs
And all its weight
In her simple mind you grabbed to all the truths
You kept away

But they don't know, they don't care
They don't even understand
And they sigh while they sleep
The prayers will stay beneath their sheets

You say the universe is weak
But in your head you bend your knees

The suburb prayed and ate its meat
The deer smelt nice you made a wish
For it to end, for it to end

To own complete the emptiness
You wished and smiled the night away
And it was neat, you gave away
You gave away your final touch
The sky caved in and you were crushed
