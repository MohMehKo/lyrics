Old folks have the best view here
Grids with grass and tin roof glare
Victory dance when no-one's won
Pension dreams have come undone

Ohh ohh tell me when it's worth
Yeah what it's worth
Ohh ohh tell me when it's worth
Yeah what it's worth

Every morning there's a halo
Hanging from a thread
Every morning there's a halo
Hanging from a thread

Call - response as egos flair
Bitumen reflects a stare
Tiny king lays down a house
I'm just coming up here for air
I'm just coming up here for air

Ohh ohh tell me when it's worth
Yeah what it's worth
Ohh ohh tell me when it's worth
Yeah what it's worth

Every morning there's a halo
Hanging from a thread
Every morning there's a halo
Hanging from a thread

So low
Low
So low
Low
