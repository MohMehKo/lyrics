Well I say, yeah!

I guess I'll wait in line for the next life
Put all my coat-tails on to impress you
Faux nihilist cop inside, blessing everyone
Been waiting all this time
Let me in, I'm alright

'Cause they say what they want
Preaching males, ego high
Pushed aside, pushed behind
Just shut up, you'll be fine

'Cause I'm waiting for an answer
Give me my next line
Waiting for an answer
I won't eightfold now

They got the holy shakes, glossolalia
They'll pop like soda now
Let me in, I'm alright

'Cause they say what they want
Preaching males, ego high
Pushed aside, pushed behind
Just shut up, you'll be fine

'Cause I'm waiting for an answer
Give me my next line
Waiting for an answer
I won't eightfold now
Waiting for an answer
I won't eightfold now
Waiting for an answer
I won't eightfold now

Watered eyes and vision kings
Selling everything
Chirping with a frown
England couch life ain't the thing
Like a magazine
A rut stuck in your mind

'Cause they say what they want
Preaching males, ego high
Pushed aside, pushed behind
Just shut up, you'll be fine

'Cause I'm waiting for an answer
Give me my next line
Waiting for an answer
I won't eightfold now
Waiting for an answer
I won't eightfold now
Waiting for an answer
I won't eightfold now
