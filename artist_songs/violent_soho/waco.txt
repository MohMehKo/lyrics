Cookie cut it
Control it
In a Waco on your own

Burn your mirror to the floor
I'll be a waiting
Stop bleeding
In a waiting room I own

In a Waco I call

Yeah I'll be waiting
We'll be screaming
For a second son

Yeah I'll be waiting
We'll be screaming
For a second son

Dress it up right
Camouflage it
In a Waco on our own
Waiting back that siren song
False message
I believe it
Need a prophet of my own

In a Waco I'll call

Yeah I'll be waiting
We'll be screaming
For a second son

Yeah I'll be waiting
We'll be screaming
For a second son

Cookie cut your desire
Fucking liars
In a Waco no-one wants

Sing a song for a profit
Meg Ryan
On a bully radio

Cookie cut your desire
Fucking liars
In a Waco no-one wants

Sing a song for a profit
For a prophet
On a bully radio

Yeah I'll be waiting
I'll be screaming
For a second son
