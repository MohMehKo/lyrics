With a cross between her legs
she went to say her final vow.
Brushed her hair aside with oil
and in your head you made a smile,

but they don't know, they don't care,
and they don't even understand.
And they sigh, while they sleep,
their prayers will stay beneath their sheets.

They say the universe is weak,
but in your head you bend your knees.

In her eyes you saw the highest
of the highs in all its weight.
In her simple mind you grabbed
to all the truths you kept awake.

But they don't know, they don't care,
and they don't even understand.
And they sigh, while they sleep,
their prayers will stay beneath their sheets.

They say the universe is weak,
but in your head you bend your knees.

The suburb prayed and ate it's meat.
the deer smelt nice you made a wish,
for it to end, for it to end,
to own complete the emptiness.

You wished and smiled the night away,
and it was me you gave away.
You gave away your final touch,
the sky caved in and you were crushed.
