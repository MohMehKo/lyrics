Tell everyone
Tell everyone you'd like to tell
That I'm not gonna make it
Waiting and waiting for God
To carry me to shore
No, I'm not gonna take it

And I said to my mother
Gonna change you, gonna save you
But I'll be here anyway

Everyone knows it's just like that
The government knows it's just like that
The writing is written on your back
I'll take an island in your eyes
Watch the sun get high and pretend until it's all gone
I don't ever wanna go
This cathedral is my home

Wake up inside
Wake up inside what you don't know
'Cause we're not gonna make it
For years we've been acting so cold
Useless chat and ice
No we're not gonna take it

And I said to my mother
Gonna change you, gonna save you
But I'll be here

Everyone knows it's just like that
The government knows it's just like that
The writing is written on our back
I'll take an island in your eyes
Watch the sun get high and pretend until it's all gone
I don't ever wanna go
This cathedral is my home
This cathedral is my home
