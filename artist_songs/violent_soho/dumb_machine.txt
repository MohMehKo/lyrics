Ball and chain, 
Look behind you it's all the same. 
At your filth and your cigarette burns, 
I knew you would never learn. 

Look at you kid, you're so cool.
Wanna be you, I wanna find your soul, 
But I feel like a dumb machine.
Throwing punches strapped to a chair I can't leave. 

The hours in your heart won't keep you warm. 
I wish, I wish, I iwish, I'd never learn. 

While the country turns to flames, 
You sit laughing drooling for fame. 
As the country sits here and burns, 
Walk beside me dead. Admire the world. 

And I wont join your game, 
Think you're stupid you only look straight. 
And the feeling it won't go, 
Just wanna get out, out of my soul. 

The hours in your heart won't keep you warm. 
I wish, I wish, I wish I'd never learn.

On your head you roll. 

The hours in your heart won't keep you warm.  
I wish, I wish I'd never learn. No, no...
