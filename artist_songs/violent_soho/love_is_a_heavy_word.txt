I hate your photos
Your stupid sports clothes
I'm your lover
And your reject too

She's an idiot
Not illiterate
De-censored
Mute playboy

Love, love is a heavy word
I said, love, love is a heavy word
I said, love, love is a heavy word
I said, love, love is a heavy word

But I'm in love
I'm in love now
Yeah, I'm in love
I'm in love now, yeah

Yeah, got my head up here
Too high
Got my head up here
Too high

Stapled stomach
Pretty monarch
Ridicule all the boys
With a high IQ

He's illiterate
Inconsiderate
Analyze all the minds
Of the fools, oh

Love, love is a heavy word
I said, love, love is a heavy word
I said, love, love is a heavy word
I said, love, love is a heavy word

I'm in love
I'm in love now
I'm in love
I'm in love now, yeah

Yeah, got my head up here
Too high
Got my head up here
Too high

Love, love
Love, love is a heavy word
Love, love is a heavy word
Love, love is a heavy word

Love, love is a heavy word
Love, love is a heavy word
Love, love is a heavy word

Love, don't, don't, I said don't, don't, I said
Say my name, send a letter to God
Say my name, I'll say yours too, yeah

Yeah, got my head up here too high
Got my head up here too high
Too high, too high
Too high, too high
