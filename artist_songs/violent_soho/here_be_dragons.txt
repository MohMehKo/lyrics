Rally your daughters
We'll end it all now
Kick down the door, sons
Fill the street with our blood, yeah

So you want to get higher
I am your one
Happy tune the parents
And kick me, kick me, I'm bored

You don't want it
Teenage riot in you
You don't see it
Teenage riot in you

You can't hear it
Teenage riot in you
Don't stop it
Teenage riot in you

Save the sheep from perfume
Give them your heart
Kiss them they want it
And tear down their cheap house

You don't want it
Teenage riot in you
You don't see it
Teenage riot in you

You can't hear it
Teenage riot in you
So don't stop it
Teenage riot in you

Fear the Gospel, yeah
Fear the Gospel
Fear the Gospel, yeah
Fear the Gospel

I got to stop it
I don't need it
I can't bleed it
I can't see it

Nut, I feel it
I can't stop it
I got to have it
Teenage riot in you

Don't stop the
Teenage riot in you
You can't stop the
Teenage riot in you

Don't want the
Teenage riot in you
Can't stop the
Teenage riot in you
