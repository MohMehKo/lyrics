The valley is empty. 
The crying has ended. 
Television screen's on high. 
The phonies killed another night. 

This breathing's irritating, 
No sunlight, no cravings. 
Love will never be the same, 
Its truth, youth or lame ideas. 

People don't like to hurt, 
People scrape at the earth, 
They just feel no age. 
Idiots in my mind. 
Idiots talk at night. 
I'll just sit and wait. 
I know it will be okay. 
I know it will be okay. 

The ghost that kept watching. 
The siblings were waiting. 
I could never understand. 
Love is fake. I'll kill I swear. 

People don't like to hurt, 
People scrape at the earth, 
They just feel no age. 
Idiots in my mind. 
Idiots talk at night. 
I'll just sit and wait. 
I know it will be okay. 

I belong.
