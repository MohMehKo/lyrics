All those followers that pray all night and day
Chasing shadows all the shadows oh the fame
And I know where you were
Dreading all the times that we could have been

Is there some place where I can go
When I escape it all
Always I know
Yeah let me find some fucking peace
Always I know
Yeah let it crash let it be
Always I now
Someplace I go
A slow wave I control
A slow wave I control

As they raised their flags across the melting streets
And wrapped a pretty gaze that kept them nice and neat
And I know where you were
It's all this hollow hum that makes me sick

Is there some place where I can go
When I escape it all
Always I know
Yeah let me find some fucking peace
Always I know
Yeah let it crash let it be
Always I now
Someplace I go
A slow wave I control
A slow wave I control

[x8]
Slow wave that I control
