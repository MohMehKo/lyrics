Shiny hair, black eyes, soulless shirts
Pride in bitches on this street that's where it hurts
Apparently we're social fabric to the core
I'll take this thread and I'll grind it to the curb
I'll say my vows, I'll sign my name
I don't crash, getting wiser holds the spiteful savor
I will resign, drop my affairs
Coy demeanor, face the fact it ain't the colder weather
Neighbour neighbour helps me breathe out everyday
Neighbour neighbour keeps me up at night
Head high, though unarmed it's alright
Screamin everyday
Look down these zones, look at my things
These days, I'm feeling weaker than the last December
You have my time, I'll build this day
I don't crash, overrated conversation fades away
Neighbour neighbour helps me breathe out everyday
Neighbour neighbour keeps me up at night
Head high, though unarmed it's alright
Screamin everyday
I never liked you anyway
I never liked you anyway
There are no reasons
There's only bridges burned
There are no reasons
There's only bridges...
Neighbour neighbour helps me breathe out everyday
Neighbour neighbour keeps me up at night
Head high, though unarmed it's alright
Screamin every
Head high, though unarmed it's alright
Screamin every
Head high, though unarmed it's alright
Screamin every
Head high, though unarmed it's alright
Screamin everyday
