I remember times
All those nights
When we drove so far away
Take me there
Fearless air
We can find a hideaway

And I'll be free
Unwind the sheets
Let the breeze trickle like lead
There's a place
I like to hide
Anywhere, yeah I don't... mind

There's no light
In my cave
My holy cave

All of these lights
Hurt my eyes
With a glaze
I can't escape

Underground
Where reason sound
100 miles
No noise complaints

When Jesus comes we'll all
Hold hands
And stare the sun right in the... face

There's no light
In my cave
My holy cave

And I'll find a hideaway
In a shadow that I make
And I'd like to fade away
In a cave that keeps me safe

I won't stay
I will go
I won't stay
I will go

I'll be right
I'll be there
I'll be there
Yeah I'll be right

My holy cave
