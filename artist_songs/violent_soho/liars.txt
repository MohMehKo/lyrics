I remember afternoon drives on Cleveland Road
That smelt like fear
With the rich kids and their parents, that western world 
That kept me well and safe
I'll never know what's inside that's eating me

It's ok to watch the TV
It's ok, I understand
Fire up and take on rival
It isn't hard, it's in your head
This fucking heat wave
This fucking heat wave
This fucking heat wave

It's the status that your dad chased when you were born
That smelt like fear
And the lovers you forgotten, so fucking bored
Tried memories and safe
I'll never know what's inside that's keeping me

It's ok to watch the TV
It's ok, I understand
Fire up and take on rival
It isn't hard, it's in your head
This fucking heat wave
This fucking heat wave
This fucking heat wave

This fucking heat wave
This fucking heat wave
This fucking heat wave
This fucking heat wave
This fucking heat wave

It's ok to watch the TV (This fucking heat wave)
It's ok, I understand (This fucking heat wave)
Fire up and take on rival (This fucking heat wave)
It isn't hard, it's in your head (This fucking heat wave)
