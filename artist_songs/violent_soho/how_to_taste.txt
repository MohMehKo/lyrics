She said
To kick it through the middle
I'm screaming through an interface
Please take me away to another place

She said
That buffy was a loser
Sick of sitcom parables
Someone tell me what to say

Tell me how to taste
Tell me how to taste
Tell me

What I see
What I know
Take the time
Turn it slow
Why won't you mediate me

City cries
City knows
Repeat the phrase
Repeat it slowly
Why won't you mediate me

She wants
To kick it marijuana
Ya filthy motherfucker
Please take me away to another place

She said
That plastic was so beautiful
Something like a monologue
Did someone tell me what to say

Tell me how to taste
Tell me how to taste
Tell me

What I see
What I know
Take the time
Turn it slow
Why won't you mediate me

City cries
City knows
Repeat the phrase
Repeat it slowly
Why won't you mediate me

Turn it over
Cause I'm letting go
Turn it over
Cause I'm letting go

She says
Shes nothing but a failure
Blames it on her mother
Someone tell me what to say

Tell me how to taste [x9]
Tell me
