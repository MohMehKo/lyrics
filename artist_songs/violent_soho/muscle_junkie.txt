You thought the world
Owed you a smile
Your parents cheer
Your dad was proud

Monday does not apply to you
Fuck you, fuck you
I can't trust you

So dig my head
Into the ground
This muscle junkie
Tied me down

And cut my limbs
Stuff them with air
I won't, I won't, I can't
Breathe here

So lick the magazines
With sweat
And pour money
Into their blank heads

Celebrities will die like you
Fuck you, fuck you
I hate your face, yeah

Always
Why can't you see?
Always
You'll die like

Never be you, that I know
Now never be you that I know
Now never feel you, I know

I hate your face, I hate your face
I hate your face

Always
Why can't you see?
Always
You'll die like

Dig my head
Into the ground
This muscle junkie
Tied me down

And cut my limbs
Stuff them with air
I won't, I won't, I can't
Breathe here
