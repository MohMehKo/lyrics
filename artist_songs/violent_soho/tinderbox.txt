And she cut my hair
And she cut yours too
The fastest memory
I feel it too
And we lost our way
Travelled so far
The oldest lovers
The thirteenth hour
And so I tried so hard
To save it
Closer by your great resentment
40 years of leads to nothing now
I tried so hard to save it
Closer by your great resentment
40 years of leads to nothing now
We yelled the loudest
You took the crown
To generation
Of family sound
And we buy the burn
That tin of bones
This is forever
Our final fall
I feel
I feel
I feel like I just can't get it right
And I fall
When I fall
I just can't get it right
How I feel
How I feel
How I feel
When I fall
When I fall
When I fall
And so I tried so hard
To save it
Closer by your great resentment
40 years of leads to nothing now
I tried so hard to save it
Closer by your great resentment
40 years of leads to nothing now [x3]
