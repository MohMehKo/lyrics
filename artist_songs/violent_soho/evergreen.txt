Sometimes I stare
I swear I saw a flash
A tiger in the sky

Tonight It's all a waste
Rhetoric and drunks
A bitument to taste

I stumble while I'm staring - faith
I wish it was as simple as you make
I stumble while I'm staring - fake
I wish it was as simple

You tried all those times
You tried to connect
But faulted on the line

Inside it's so contrived
Black box that knows nothing
Repeats it all again

I stumble while I'm staring - faith
I wish it was as simple as you make
I stumble while I'm staring - fake
I wish it was as simple

[x4]
So simple now

I stumble while I'm staring - faith
I wish it was as simple as you make
I stumble while I'm staring - fake
I wish it was as simple

[x8]
So simple now
