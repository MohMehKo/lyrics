Dressed up like a funeral home
You're cold but lovable
Dream up all the centrefolds
For what?

'Cause I raised your glass
Signed your card
And this is all I got
Your highbrow piss
No sounds, all tricks
And this is all I got

You worship wars
Your skin ain't torn
And this is all I got
'Cause it's outside
Outside

Shrugged shoulders and after-thoughts
Burn your cards and walk away
Fantasise for another day
For what?

When they stand on the family shore
Holding hands and staring high
Did you think that this would work?
For what?

'Cause I raised your glass
Signed your card
And this is all I got
Your highbrow piss
No sounds, all tricks
And this is all I got

You worship wars
Your skin ain't torn
And this is all I got
'Cause it's outside
Outside

Holy mother
Holy mother
Holy mother

I'll say go and you say where now
It's been made for you this weather
Lilly Lally dancing fuck-ups
Gold Coast mums and prefect drop-outs

I'll say go and you say where now (outside)
I'll say go and you say where now
I'll say go and you say where now (outside)
I'll say go and you say where now
