Hit me with your love
Strike gently
I can't get enough
So simply

Hit me with your love
Strike gently
I can't get enough
Strike gently

Your words, they stay
They just want to linger here
They won't go away
It's just when you swing
Down upon my neck
The pressure you bring

See we stroke that fire high inside tonight
Gonna need to heat
So you can make that iron hot, don't stop
Just take swings down on me
And you can grab the handle
I'll be your anvil

Hit me with your love
Strike gently
I can't get enough
So simply

Hit me with your love
Strike gently
I can't get enough
Strike gently

I've singled it out
The reason I have no fear
If you cut me down
It's something that's real
You give when I'm in need
It's just for the feel

See we stroke that fire high inside tonight
Gonna need to heat
So you can make that iron hot, don't stop
Just take swings down on me
And you can grab the handle
I'll be your anvil

Hit me with your love
Strike gently
I can't get enough
So simply

Hit me with your love
Strike gently
I can't get enough
Strike gently
