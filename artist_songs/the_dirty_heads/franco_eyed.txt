I’m on that overload over kill
I’m redlinin on blue pills
High octanes my intake
I’m P-Swayze man Point Break
Make no mistakes I don’t care
Not one shit will be given here
I make the room shake, earthquake
Turbulence, outer space
Yeah, let it go, cruise control
full speed ahead with my eyes closed
I smoke the best just hydro
Makes my eyes red like Diablo
I’m taking off, next to go
Molotov set to blow
These crimson eyes are set to glow
Medieval shit man, crossbows
We dangerous beast mode
Got catapults full of bags of dope
Man set in stone, good to go
Found my zone in the Alamo
Yeah big time, dinosaur
So big colossal
You stuck in dirt man fossils
We taking off full throttle, lets go

Yelling at the sky singing
Rolling Franco Eyed singing
Yelling at the sky singing

Ok get it got it get it good
Like a big bad wolf when you’re lost in the woods
Put teeth in the beat like it’s rocking a hood
Wear the clothes of a sheep and I wish you would
Try to find me like you wish you could
Roll real deep, and it’s understood
We getting real fucked up and I’m feeling real good
Gotta Carrie me home, Underwood
I’m nice on the mic like a knife to the throat
The nights real high cause the bass real low
Right by your side when you fight with a bloke
Watch where you bite cause you might just choke
Dead man walking end of the rope
If I hear this one more time then I might just blow
You’re a Dirty Head
You’re filthy bro
Fuck it then someone give me the soap
Mopping the floor with yah
Break down the door to rock the performance
Top of the morn’ to yah
Awkwardly orbit the top of the score like friends in the core
Man I’ll go to war for yah
These crazy lights these lazy nights I’m Franco eyed
Got me yelling at the sky like

Yelling at the sky singing
Rolling Franco eyed singing
Yelling at the sky singing

Yelling at the sky singing
Rolling Franco eyed singing
Yelling at the sky singing

Inhale then exhale
Clear the bong no stale smoke
Lungs open like a ship sail
Mutiny when you double toke
My boot hits like a drum kick
No two shits do I give a fuck
My crews thick like a fat bitch
And she’s hungry fool get eaten up
You’re a steppin stone we walkin tall
Footprints all down the hall
Knocked down we stand up
We party hard get yah hands up
We blaze up smoke you out
Mind trapped we broke you out
There’s an undertone don’t hesitate
We love Cali we medicate
In my zone it’s sucka free
And you’re the bitch it sucks to be
When the Dr.’s in it’s about y’all
Remember this no house calls
My doors are open with a nurse waitin
Sexy bitch bring in my first patient
Heart racin’ paper chasin’
I’m Bruce Wayne and you’re Dick Grayson

Yelling at the sky singing
Rolling Franco eyed singing
Yelling at the sky singing

Yelling at the sky singing
Rolling Franco eyed singing
Yelling at the sky singing
