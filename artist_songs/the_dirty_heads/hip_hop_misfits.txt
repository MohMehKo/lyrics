Got a ball and a biscuit a bullet and a Triscuit
Got your knees bucklin' like a torn up meniscus
Got your buddy askin' you man what is this I can'talk shit dog it's too good to dis this

Well it's the dirty heads man they straight from the pacific
I don't really like 'em they kind of dip-shits this one's a drunk
While the other gets lifted this one's a punk
You don't believe me just listen cause I'm mischievous
And I got the sickest word play like Sid vicious
And the Pistols rocked the U.K.
Cause I'm a vandal off the handle that's what you say give me a beat
And I will gladly pay you Tuesday

So if you want to say something to the audio professionals
Then speak into the microphone it's right above my testicles
Got you haggard MCs runnin' hiding under vestibules
Rhymes like everybody man they kinda like bisexuals
Pop's is a carpenter mom's is an arm twister blah blah blah blah blah blah
Blah blah blah blah mister
Move it along mister fuck it along mister
You can grab my dick don't give a shit and get a palm blister

I know you love the dirty heads always be blaring 'em
I'm doctoring your pussies like a veterinarian
You whinin' like a baby maybe need a cesarean
Man Dirty J is wasted boy you better take care of him

I don't mind being knocked off ridiculed made to feel minuscule
When you consider the source it's kinda pitiful
When you consider the force it's kinda beautiful
When you consider the choice it's quite unusual
Took it from Slipknot and flipped it to hip hop
Walkin' the tight rope the way to the tip top
You think that your punk rock you're wearing a faux hawk

Because you're not a
