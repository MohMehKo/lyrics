[Verse 1:]
Well it's the high plane's drifter mixed with Jack the Ripper
Dropping lyrics like some waiter, I was sitting on the shitter
Hit you right in the kisser, popped like a blister
Making moves on the track, check mate Bobby Fisher
You mad at me
Mad at me, like I valeted your sister
Drove her like a whip
And I tipped her, just picture
This a vicious one, I'm on a mission son
This my kitchen stop you bitching 'till the dishes done
Not like you used to, might need a booster
Chop up the beat like I used a yakuza
We got the producer
He supah dee dupah
And I am so stoned like I checked out Medusa

[Chorus:]
Medusa [x3]
Run up on the track, liquor shot, Medusa
Medusa [x3]
Run up on the track, liquor shot, Medusa

[Verse 2:]
No time like now, Imma get it going
Get the hell off of my cloud
There ain't no room and I keep growing
Watch me now I'll go no handed
Got yo feet stuck in the granite
Can't stand still, no, I can't stand it
Keep it moving of the planets
Yeah that new shit, the future
That all should be useless
No time fo that bullshit
Hang that nuisance from these nooses
Yeah highly elevated, I feel at home in my zone
Just wanna be sedated like my name is Joe Ramone
Bag of bones inside my closet
Bag of weed inside my pocket
Keep it there to keep me cool
Yeah fuck that drama I don't want it
Yeah I run around getting high like you used ta
I get so stoned like I checked out Medusa

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
We got to run up on the track
Liquor shot, liquor shot
Keeping us stoned as afulak
Liquor shot, liquor shot
I watch the captain and my clock
Liquor shot, liquor shot
Boo yaka boo yaka, see that!
Liquor shot, liquor shot
You get so stoned you see medusa from your left a liquor shot
On your door a liquor shot
From Medusa sinkodak
And every time we speak achak
Boy ya put on twitter dat some
I go word for word
Pick up every idieygolah
If I'm Medusa you're off I see
You know if I do dat
Sit daminadaett
Da left you soon hakkun
Ey you dat
I agrip, halle make you challis gon gush
Ooh I'm gonna make you stoned
Nana nema I move you to dat
You know how we roll

[Chorus x2]

Medusa [x4]
What once was, Medusa
Dirty Heads, Medusa
Medusa [x2]
