Time to get up
Time to get down
We rep our city
We rep our town
Yeah we gone fight
And we gone win
By blood and bone
By teeth and skin
Ah fuck your boss if you got laid off
Fuck em all like you broke the law
Head or tales when the coin is tossed
We ain't gonna stop when we lose the draw
Bag of grass like I mowed the lawn
Broken smile with a broken jaw
Hold the bell with a broken arm
And the motor on you posers gone

They don't want you to believe
That you're a living miracle
Live [?] and see
Cos they don't even know
They don't even know
That you're a living miracle
They don't even know
They don't even...

Time to get up
It's time to get down
We rep our city
We'll take that crown
All day and night
We fight to win
Can't stop us now
Cos we don't give in
Yeah time to go, it's time to roll
Let's lose control like animals
Slide hands and knees through the rain and snow
We crawl along til we reach the gold
No ass slap and no half ass
And I'm all in when I get it
Yeah you back tracking I'm gaining action
It's long gone when I hit it. C'mon

They don't want you to believe
that you're a living miracle
Live [?] and see
Cos they don't even know
They don't even know
That you're a living miracle
They don't even know
They don't even...

By our sweat and tears
We don't walk alone
Sharper than our fangs
We gone let em show
Cos you away now
And we at home
Well you don't understand
We will show ya

They don't even know
They don't even know
That you're a living miracle
They don't even know
They don't even...
