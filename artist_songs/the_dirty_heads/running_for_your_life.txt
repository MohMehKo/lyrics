Like a rouge wave let the water spill
My friends are crazy 88 call it kill bill
Ask me read or blue, I took both pills
Now paint is dripping off the fog like a pent drill
We got 4 bottles hey
Smash it on the ground you can smash it to your face
Never running low you know we stack it by the case
Like an old bridge let it bury you
Tell the reaper to his face, I ain't scared of you
Tonight is the night we gonna carry you
With the spirit with the spirit like a parachute
We're bombing out today
Massive when we're coming and forever gonna rage
Look up to the lights, put it down on a stage
Tonight you live for something so you better celebrate

Red lights racing
Going for a ride
No breaks, yeah
Running for your life
Don't waste it
The moment's never right
So make it
Running for your life
Running for your life, yeah
Running for your life
The moment's never right, yeah
Running for your life

Tied up and tangled, no sense in resisting
What sound does my voice make if nobody's listening
All I can hear is the wind as it's whistling
All my life I've been searching
Just looking for something
Can't find nothing if you don't go hunting
Man, dive into the flames, you can do it if the devil can
And imma make my mark, yeah
But imma start with a spark, yeah
And I'll explode to peace sign
Tie dye flag wave higher than the sky line
When a beast is reality
Dreaming is easy, life's just a quandary
Take a wrong turn you get lost in jumanji
Forget about the past yo that shit's dirty laundry

Red lights racing
Going for a ride
No breaks, yeah
Running for your life
Don't waste it
The moment's never right
So make it
Running for your life
Running for your life, yeah
Running for your life
The moment's never right, yeah
Running for your life

Well it's the crazy 88, check 'em bobbin' on your face
We out her smashing grapes, Alexander living great
I'm enrolling living roman and I'm toking in my toga
Keep on rollin' the aroma, now I'm living in a coma
High as f***k can't feel my face, I kinda wish that I was sober
30 seconds off from mars and I rolled that on the rover
Propaganda's on the wall, I made her paint over the poster
Muzzle on the fat lady the party's never over
Listen up kemosabi, hands up, it's a robbery
Find me at the brothel pants down in the lobby
Six shooter high nooner [?] can't stop me 
Ain't counterfeit spit of some shit you can't copy

Red lights racing
Going for a ride
No breaks, yeah
Running for your life
Don't waste it
The moment's never right
So make it
Running for your life
Running for your life, yeah
Running for your life
The moment's never right, yeah
Running for your life
