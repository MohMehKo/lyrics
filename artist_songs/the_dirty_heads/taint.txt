Well its the two baddest, long haired, mother fuckers right here
People call us dirtbags and you know that we just dont care
If you relate to this statement let me see ya hands
'cause people hate on these things that they don't understand
Supposedly, yes, we're all created equal
Then why the fuck is there so many angry people
Like my fans and the industry they've both got their complaints
Now I'm stuck between a asshole and a dick just like a taint
A smile and a screw face
A rock and a hard place
A dream and reality
Which one would you chase?
So if your listenin'
