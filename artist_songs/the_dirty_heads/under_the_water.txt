I'm tired, I'm restless
I've already said this
I might need a medic
I'm trapped in these mornings without you
These mornings without you, yeah
I'm more than just nervous
With walls on the surface
I know that you've heard this
I just want a morning here with you
A morning here with you, yeah

Ooh, ooh, ooh, nowhere to run to when it gets harder
Ooh, ooh, ooh, no one can find us under the water, no no
Ooh, ooh, ooh, sharing a breath under the hurricane
Ooh, ooh, ooh, no one can find us under the water, no no

I've been thinking about leaving
Slowly sinking down
But while I'm thinking, you keep reaching
Never let me drown
You show me I'm worth it and no one is perfect
We all have a purpose and mine is to love this life with you
To love this life with you

Ooh, ooh, ooh, nowhere to run to when it gets harder
Ooh, ooh, ooh, no one can find us under the water, no no
Ooh, ooh, ooh, sharing a breath under the hurricane
Ooh, ooh, ooh, no one can find us under the water, no no

Cause in this moment we become free
Two warms hearts under the cold sea
Yeah, we float on, we float on
And in this time we become one
We could find peace with nowhere to run
Yeah, just hold on, just hold on
And in the darkness there will be light
Two lost souls in a starlit night
Don't let go because it won't feel right, yeah
I hear you calling, I'm calling back now
The rain is falling under the light town

Ooh, ooh, ooh, nowhere to run to when it gets harder
Ooh, ooh, ooh, no one can find us under the water, no no
Ooh, ooh, ooh, nowhere to run to when it gets harder
Ooh, ooh, ooh, no one can find us under the water, no no
Ooh, ooh, ooh, sharing a breath under the hurricane
Ooh, ooh, ooh, no one can find us under the water, no no

Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, no one can find us under the water, no no
