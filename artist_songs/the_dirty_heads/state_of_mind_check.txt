State of mind check
state of mind check [says it for a while]

Realize what you're doing
understand the choice you're choosing
Realize what your doing understand the choice your choosing
Is there no other way out? thing to talk about
I'll start to scream and we all start to shout
If I'm wrong then I'm wrong
But I'm not and I know it
Cuz I got class style veness and I show it
Just tryin to speak about what exactly is on my mind
And if you dont agree thats just fine I dont care
And no I dont think that I ever will
I'm not in this to make friends nor the dollar bill
Just tryin to speak about my point of view

Ahshoobeedoobeedoo ahsoobeedoobeedoobeedoo

Yo state of mind check relax before you step no need to raise your fist it's not the complex yo
Its so easy once you overcome
Like if your battles break a fist and my wisdom
I find another way I live another day I smoke another j it takes the pain away
This is all I got I said its all I got I said this all I really need to say

I say simmer down simmer down take a step back and look around
Realize realize realize just whats going down oh what is going down
Tell me whats goin down just whats going down

State of mid check relax before you something that you really dont want to do
Yo this is all I got yo this is all I got sing
Its all really need to say to you [repeat]

I say simmer down simmer down take a step back and look around
Realize realize realize just what is going down oh what is going down
Tell me whats going down
Just whats go-oing down
