Remember your armor before you start this war
Remember your honor before you close the door
I'm looking for answers that you'll never have
Wearing the colors of the rain, yeah

If you want me to believe
Then tell me the truth
Tell me the truth
First it was me, now you're saying it's you
Make up your mind
I'm done searching for clues
Tell me the truth
Tell me the truth
Ask me more questions; I'll tell you no lies
Something's been stuck in the back of my mind
Tell me the truth
Tell me the truth
Tell me the truth

Remember what's spoken of boys and on their tongue
Choosing to forget all that's been done
I'm waiting for questions that you'll never ask
Wearing the colors of the rain, yeah

If you want me to believe
Then tell me the truth
Tell me the truth
First it was me, now you're saying it's you
Make up your mind
I'm done searching for clues
Tell me the truth
Tell me the truth
Ask me more questions; I'll tell you no lies
Something's been stuck in the back of my mind
Tell me the truth
Tell me the truth
Tell me the truth

All my life I've been wil'in
Every day steady grindin'
Still chasing that dream
Destiny beyond the horizon
The real travel in silence, while the fake get loud and get violent
Keep my eyes close and my head down, but my speaker's standing behind it
Iâ€™ve seen what happens to dreams of people get lost and they get reminded that false people tell true lies and use flashing lights, so we blinded
So easy to be divided
So hard to stay steady minded
But I'm still here and I'm still strong
And I [?]

Tell me the truth
Tell me the truth
First it was me, now you're saying it's you
Make up your mind
I'm done searching for clues
Tell me the truth
Tell me the truth
Ask me more questions; I'll tell you no lies
Something's been stuck in the back of my mind
Tell me the truth
Tell me the truth
Tell me the truth
