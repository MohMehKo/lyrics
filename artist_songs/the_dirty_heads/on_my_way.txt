Well as I wake up
And feel the sunshine
It's like my mind's as clear as the Alpines
I'm feelin' so good
Time for me to unwind
Let all these problems slip right offa my spine
I got this feelin'
Feelin' like I can't be stopped
And I wont, until I find myself on top
And I know, I know that I will be there someday
Until then I'm happy just being on my way

On my way, I'm feelin' fine
Another day, is left behind
On my way, I'm feelin' fine
On my way, another day
On my way, I'm feelin' fine
Another day, is left behind
On my way, I'm feelin' fine
On my way, on my way

Well as the day fades into the nightshade
Listen to the sounds that the wind and the leaves make
I can feel the energy comin' off the streets I walk through
Now I feel I can do anything I want to
Feeling, feeling I got on my side
And I'm so close I can just reach out and grab it
And I know, I know I'll be there someday
Until then I'm happy just being on my way

On my way, I'm feelin' fine
Another day, is left behind
On my way, I'm feelin' fine
On my way, another day
On my way, I'm feelin' fine
Another day, is left behind
On my way, I'm feelin' fine
On my way, on my way

I am on my way okay
Just another passing day
This is not a passion play
Let me see your plaster face
Go feed your rat, fuck the race
Trim the fat, just in case
This skinny skater kid is no longer out of place
The tanks are rocked fresh, If you've got nothing left
I'm the Die Antwoord, answer it's set
If you listen to the words that I'm playin off the kid
You'll see my lyrics' like a baseball cause my rhymes are intimate

Well as I wake up
And feel the sunshine
It's like my mind's as clear as the Alpines
I'm feelin' so good
Time for me to unwind
Let all these problems slip right offa my spine
I got this feelin'
Feelin' like I can't be stopped
And I wont, until I find myself on top
And I know, I know that I will be there someday
Until then I'm happy just being on my way

On my way (Feelin' I've got (dunno what he says.. )
Another day (And I'm so close I can just reach out and grab it)
On my way (And I know, I know I'll be there some day)
On my way, another day (Till then I'm happy just being on my way)
On my way
(Feeling like I can't be stopped)
Another day (and I wont)
(Till I find myself on top)
On my way (and I know)
(I know that I will be there someday)
On my way, another day (Until then I'm happy just being on my way)
On my way, I'm feelin' fine
Another day, is left behind
On my way, I'm feelin' fine
On my way, on my way
