I see you've been chasing your monsters
And they've been driving you bonkers
Just blind them with Rocket Launchers
Of light and to blow out their conscience
If you really want to juxtapose
And take a darker color with a blush of rose
And then you put it in your ink and watch it grow
Your mind is always open when your eyes are closed
Because you're blind to color and your blind to creed
You're blind to all the things that you don't need
Then you find a mind and then you plant a seed
Then you nourish it a little let it free

You're building it up
And they're breaking it down
Wanna give up
But keep holding your ground
Turning it up
But they're deaf to the sound
Oh the sound the sound of change

I can hear it now, the horns are playing
The victory sound, I live in the now
The sky is my home, and I live in the clouds
Now or never, bound forever
Making a change, making it better
I live for this shit, I love the pain
It's part of the journey, it's part of the game
I've been alone in the dark and the rain
I've seen the end and I wasn't afraid
I've been in tears and I wasn't ashamed
I hear a sound the sound that I'm hearing is change

You're building it up
And they're breaking it down
Wanna give up
But keep holding your ground
Turning it up
But they're deaf to the sound
Oh the sound the sound of change

You're building it up
And they're breaking it down
Wanna give up
But keep holding your ground
You're turning it up
But they're deaf to the sound
Oh the sound the sound of change

Well they try to put hands on my ears
Oh oh the sound
In my heart I'm still hearing it clear
Oh oh the sound
Tell me why do they fear what is real?
Oh oh the sound
You can't stop what is already here
Oh oh the sound

You're building it up
And they're breaking it down
Wanna give up
But keep holding your ground
You're turning it up
But they're deaf to the sound
Oh the sound the sound of change

You're building it up
And they're breaking it down
Wanna give up
But keep holding your ground
You're turning it up
But they're deaf to the sound
Oh the sound the sound of change

OOOoooOO oh oh oh oh
OOOoooOO oh oh oh oh
OOOoooOO oh oh oh oh
Oh the sound the sound of change

OOOoooOO oh oh oh oh
OOOoooOO oh Oh oh oh
OOOoooOO oh oh oh oh
Oh the sound the sound of change
