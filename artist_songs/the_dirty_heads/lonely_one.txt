Well I've been done this road before
Down this road before,
It's just so dark and cold
Well I've been down this road before,
Down this road before it's just so long and alone...

I said she kissed me goodbye,
Kissed me goodbye
Then she turned to walk away never comin' back for me.
Well now I'm askin' her why
Askin' her why
Baby I just can't believe that you're up and leavin' me...

Cause now I'm alone,
Now I'm the lonely one,
Now I'm alone,
Now I'm the lonely one

Now I'm the lonely one,
Beneath this lonely sun,
I roam the streets at night searchin' for my only one.
Alone that's gone so wrong, a heart that broke in two
I got one half with me you took the other one with you
And when the morning comes I try hard to be stronger
But the way she got me feelin' I can't take it any longer
I'm the lonely one, yeah
I'm the only one,
And now I roam the streets at night beneath this frozen sun,

Well I've been done this road before
Down this road before,
It's just so dark and cold
Well I've been down this road before,
Down this road before it's just so long and alone...
I said she kissed me goodbye,
Kissed me goodbye
Then she turned to walk away never comin' back for me.
Well now I'm askin' her why
Askin' her why
Baby I just can't believe that you're up and leavin' me...
'Cause now I'm alone...
Well now I'm the only one.
Now I'm alone,
Now I'm the lonely one.

You say our love needs autotune 'cause when we sing we're out of key,
Me without your love is like the birds without the bees
It's like the fish without the sea,
It's like the snot without the sneeze.
I'm broken down and barren like the trees without the leaves,
I'm the moon and you're the sun, and it's the light that we acquire,

Little lonely ember find your way back to the fire?
We can burn together put it back up in the sky,
We can yearn together, wet it down let it die.

I'm the lonely one,
I'm the lonely one,
Well I've been done this road before
Down this road before,
It's just so dark and cold
Well I've been down this road before,
Down this road before it's just so long and alone...
I said she kissed me goodbye,
Kissed me goodbye
Then she turned to walk away never comin' back for me.
Well now I'm askin' her why
Askin' her why
Baby I just can't believe that you're up and leavin' me...
'Cause now I'm alone...
Well now I'm the only one.
Now I'm alone,
Now I'm the lonely one.
