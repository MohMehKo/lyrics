We live like titans we live immortal
the uninvited the other side of the road
we are the right hand you are the mortar
we’ll build you up and then make you the cornerstone
See mirrored mountains painted in water
We will disturb them jump in and bring ‘em to life

Ohhhhhhhhhhhh
One hand comes after the other
Ohhhhhhhhhhhh
No time to run for cover
Ohhhhhhhhhhhh
feels like I’m climbin forever
Ohhhhhhhhhhhh
One hand comes after the other

I feel the weight of the world upon my shoulders
It feels like the weather outside is getting colder
No sense in hiding, I just keep climbing
The sky is the limit and that’s right behind me
I can feel it coming down harder than before
God speed, keep steady man heavy is the storm
be warned and be told
time won’t wait for the helpless
I’ll rest when I’m dead till then I’m livin restless
Yes you can’t hold me down cause my confidence is constant
I’m killin this shit death with Charles Bronson
look around man the whole world is watching
What you gonna say, take caution

Ohhhhhhhhhhhh
One hand comes after the other
Ohhhhhhhhhhhh
No time to run for cover
Ohhhhhhhhhhhh
feels like I’m climbin forever
Ohhhhhhhhhhhh
One hand comes after the other

(One hand comes after the other One hand comes after the other)

Realizing everything in life is beautiful,
I know this world can make us crazy act like animals
I’ve seen the worst and now I know there’s always brighter days
Once you reach the bottom ups the only other way
I keep on climbing till I find just what I’m lookin for
Can’t stop me now I’m going to climb until I can’t no more
We take our chances and sometimes they have the price to pay
That’s just the way it goes, there ain’t no other way

Ohhhhhhhhhhhh
One hand comes after the other
Ohhhhhhhhhhhh
No time to run for cover

Ohhhhhhhhhhhh
One hand comes after the other
Ohhhhhhhhhhhh
No time to run for cover
Ohhhhhhhhhhhh
Feels like I’m climbin forever
Ohhhhhhhhhhhh
One hand comes after the other

One hand comes after the other
One hand comes after the other
One hand comes after the other
One hand comes after the other
