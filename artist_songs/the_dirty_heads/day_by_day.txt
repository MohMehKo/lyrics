All hyped up, ready to begin
Styrofoam MC's keep crumbling
Dirty Heads stay tight couldn't loosen with a wrench
These rivers run deep, Mariano trench
Pickin' up speed, easy round the bend
Eye on the scope, target focused in
My guitar is my gun, I strum it like the wind.
Zoomed in on the pulse of the nation once again

So don't wait for me my friend
I'm just wasting time again

So day by day, I will move on
Can't stop now, it's been too long
Day by Day, I will grow stronger
Strides I take, they will grow longer
Day by Day, step by step,
Live my life, no regrets
Day by day, I will keep movin' on, day by day

Bright lights on
Coming off the hinge
Rambling on like a Led Zeppelin
I got my sword and my pen like mad mordagin
Outta the abyss starting to ascend
Top of the class peak of the summit
Throw your worries of a cliff watch them as they plummet

Bandana and a harp playin' while you're strumming
Bobby McGee and Duddy b while your humming like

Don't wait for me, my friend
I'm just wasting time again

So day by day, I will move on
Can't stop now, it's been too long
Day by Day, I will grow stronger
Strides I take, they will grow longer
Day by Day, step by step,
Live my life, no regrets
Day by day, I will keep movin' on, day by day

Moving forward, beyond the borders
Take warning, my day has come
Stop for nothing, wait for no one
Take warning, my day has come
Take warning my day has come

So day by day, I will move on
Can't stop now, it's been too long
Day by Day, I will grow stronger
Strides I take, they will grow longer
Day by Day, step by step,
Live my life, no regrets
Day by day, I will keep movin' on, day by day
