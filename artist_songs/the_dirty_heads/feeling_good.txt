Feels good feeling good, man I told you so
Just live your life like you should and let your worries go
Keep your head up even if you're fed up
Things will never change if you run from what you're scared of
Just remember who you are and where you came from
If you get lost: count your steps and retrace 'em
Cause things change, but it ain't what defines you
Yeah, sometimes we need things that remind you

Even without light, you can always find me
Even when you're flying blind

I'm feeling good
This world is mine for the taking
I'm gonna take it
I ain't going to lie, I'm feeling good
I'm gonna make this world mine
Two joints and a bottle of wine
No reason to deny I'm feeling good
This world is mine for the taking
I'm gonna make it, I'm gonna take it this time
I ain't going to lie, I'm feeling good
It feels like it's already mine
No reason to deny I'm feeling good

It feels good to get the demons out
A new day, a new dawn, beginning now
I feel I can do anything
Just need to believe in what got me here
So far, but so full of melody
And no time for my fucking with my enemy
Too business-minded, I'm full of energy
You get what you give, so I'mma give everything, yeah
Got me running for the summer man, yeah
And y'all can tell him that I'm coming man, yeah
Eyes redder than a blood moon
Y'all can try and hide, but the world gon' be mine soon

Even without light, you can always find me
Even when you're flying blind

I'm feeling good
This world is mine for the taking
I'm gonna take it
I ain't going to lie, I'm feeling good
I'm gonna make this world mine
Two joints and a bottle of wine
No reason to deny I'm feeling good
This world is mine for the taking
I'm gonna make it, I'm gonna take it this time
I ain't going to lie, I'm feeling good
It feels like it's already mine
No reason to deny I'm feeling good

I ain't going to lie, I'm feeling good
No reason, no reason
I ain't going to lie, I'm feeling good
No reason to deny I'm feeling...
I'm feeling good

This world is mine for the taking
I'm gonna take it
I ain't going to lie, I'm feeling good
I'm gonna make this world mine
Two joints and a bottle of wine
No reason to deny I'm feeling good
This world is mine for the taking
I'm gonna make it, I'm gonna take it this time
I ain't going to lie, I'm feeling good
It feels like it's already mine
No reason to deny I'm feeling good
This world is mine for the taking
I'm gonna take it
I'm gonna make this world mine
Two joints and a bottle of wine
No reason, no reason
This world is mine for the taking
I'm gonna make it, I'm gonna take it this time
It feels like it's already mine
No reason to deny I'm feeling good
