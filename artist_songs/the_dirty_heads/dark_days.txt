Lately I've been thinkin' 'bout
Things that I don't know about
I've been thinkin' that I have not reached my summit
I'm just holdin' myself back, there is no reason I'm not on it
You can talk all that you want but without tryin' you can't own it
I'm as high as a man can be, I'm never comin' down.
Stars look at me with envy I get so high off this ground.
My sound remains legit, this talent is the shit.
This beat is off the hook man my feet they just don't quit.
I'm gonna take this shit and run with it.
Say I'm Forrest Gumpin' it.
Gonna sail my ship to the end of the sea
When I get back y'all have fun with it.
Believe me when I say I give two shits 'bout yesterday
Gonna get all Warren G. up on your ass and regulate.
I get when the getttin's good, what I got is always fresh
I do not stop I'm on to the next, this bubble's 'bout to pop so make way

I've been through the darkest places
Can't track the time I've wasted Oh.
'Cause that's the only way I know.
I've walked through the darkest days and
somehow I've found my shade Oh.
'Cause that's the only way I know.

And no matter where I go
My past is still the same.
So It's time to just let go.
Make way

Life is just like clockwork, and I don't have a stopper.
They say my ticker's awkward so Im'a take a shot first.
Before I try to fix the problems that I have at hand,
I sink in seconds move in slow mo, quick sand.
I'm searchin' in a darker bind and try to find my way
Keep on gossipin' death to all the words you say
I take the troubles and I throw em back to yesterday.
Tomorrow starts now so I won't wait to make the same mistake.

I've been through the darkest places
Can't track the time I've wasted Oh.
'Cause that's the only way I know.
I've walked through the darkest days and
somehow I've found my shade Oh.
'Cause that's the only way I know.

And no matter where I go
My past is still the same.
So It's time to just let go.
Make way

Someone told me I should wait (Someone told me I should wait)
For my time to fall into place (For my time to fall into place)
But I might miss the chance to take (I might miss the chance to take)
To stay right where I am today
Make way

I've been through the darkest places
Can't track the time I've wasted Oh.
'Cause that's the only way I know.
I've rocked through the darkest days and
somehow I've found my shade Oh.
'Cause that's the only way I know.

And no matter where I go
My past is still the same.
So It's time to just let go.
Make way
