[Chorus]
You better dance all night
You gonna make it right
Until we all fall down, we all fall down
Cause it's you that I've been missing
[x2]

Top of the world, peak of my high
Don't look now I just took flight
Apocalypse now, we own the night
Got two choices surf or fly
Skate or die, sink or swim
Crash or fly, look within
I do not let this bullshit phase me I see lights and I go crazy
Cool is the wind, dark is the sky
Blackbird sings in the dead of the night
Take these broken joints and get high
take your worries kiss 'em goodbye
Tonight has been so amazing
I see you and I go crazy
You put me into this trance
I hear music lets dance

We ain't gonna stop now, dancing on top
We ain't gonna stop now, no

[Chorus x2]

I be bold like a leopard, fierce like a lion
Like an eagle flying across the sky, and they wonder why
when they ponder on the creation of his majesty
I believe in we, I believe in you and me
As we swim upon the ocean, swim on the sea
Wont you please come with me, running up into the hills
And the trees we can fall down through the tumbleweeds

I will be our king, you will be my kingdom
I will promise to sing them

[Chorus x2]

You know were gonna act like there's one last day
and you don't have to ask cause you know I'm gonna say
make it one more round, yeah one more round
You know we're gonna act like there's one last day
and you don't have to ask cause you know I'm gonna say
make it one more round, yeah one more round

[Chorus x2]
