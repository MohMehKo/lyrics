You're searching for a home
A place to lay your head
The sirens sings a song
That shakes you from your bed

You are a ritual
You are the seven seas
You're missing Jamaica
Back where your daddy sings
Girl, you've been everywhere
And you've done everything
I feel I can't compare
Us to to the world you've seen

She asked where I wanna go
I said the end of the world with you
She said I feel like I'm home
At the end of the world with you

With every wake and more
You're calling out to me
The parts I've never known
You shed your mystery

You're Alexandria
You are the fall of Rome
As long as I'm with you
Then we can feel at home
Girl, we've been everywhere
And we've done everything
And now I can't compare
Us to the world you've seen

She asked where I wanna go
I said the end of the world with you
She said I feel like I'm home
At the end of the world with you

She asked where I wanna go
I said the end of the world with you
She said I feel like I'm home
At the end of the world with you

When years have passed
And I have gone
Your memory will sink with me
You shown me all
That I can see
So take me away and let me sleep

She asked where I wanna go
I said the end of the world with you
She said I feel like I'm home
At the end of the world with you

She asked where I wanna go
I said the end of the world with you
She said I feel like I'm home
At the end of the world with you
