There's a hole in my heart where your love used to be.
I try and fill it with old memories.
Since you've left it's been gone all along yeah,
My love for you burns hot like the sun.

There's a hole in my pocket where my money's far from.
It seems to far faster than it comes yeah,
I try and save it, but it just can't be done.
My money burns hot like the sun.

When it rains it pours and it's comin' down.
It's rainin' down from the skies above,
When it rains it pours and it's comin' down.
I spent my money and I lost my love
I spent my money and I lost my love, it's comin' down from the skies above [x2]

Well I got rain drops fallin' on the top of my head
But they feel heavy as rocks from all these words that been said
And all these lies that been told, and all these promises gone,
We'll fill your futures with gold for just another hit song,
I'm sick and tired of sittin' and listenin' to your babbling,
About how you're gonna save all my problems but you haven't been.
And days that go by, and then I'm still left to dry
And man you wonder why I'm yellin' I'm just sick of lies.
Cause when it rains it pours and it's comin' down.
It's rainin' down from the skies above,
When it rains it pours and it's comin' down.
I spent my money and I lost,
When it rains it pours it's comin' down
It's rainin' down from the skies above
When it rains it pours and it's comin' down
I spent my money and I lost my love

Rain fallin' down...
Black clouds comin' and they won't go away.
The rain comes down from the skies turned grey...
Black clouds comin' and they won't go away.
The rain comes down...
Black clouds comin' and they won't go away.
The rain comes down from the skies turned grey...
Black clouds comin' and they won't go away.
The rain comes down...

Cause when it rains it pours and it's comin' down.
It's rainin' down from the skies above,
When it rains it pours and it's comin' down.
I spent my money and I lost,
When it rains it pours it's comin' down
It's rainin' down from the skies above
When it rains it pours and it's comin' down
I spent my money and I lost my love... [x3]
