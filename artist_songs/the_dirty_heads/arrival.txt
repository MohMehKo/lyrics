We found was a place we could 
Go to get away from ourselves
When we found it, it was broken
Wanna stay here and fix it with me 
Wanna stay here and fix it with me 

Out here we are 
Out here we are 
Out here we are 
Out here we are
Out here we are 
Out here we 

We arrive and
I know nothing
I owe nothing
We owe nothing now

And now it's ours and we rebuilt it 
It's a place for me and you 
Won't you come back when you feel it
I'll be waiting right here for you
