I wonder why I wasted all of my time
I could've been, I could've been there with you
Wonder why I even try girl
Cause there's just nothin, nothin I can do
Nowhere that I can go, no
Nothin that I can say girl, that's gonna take the pain away

This time I feel like dyin, feels like I'm dead within
Sometimes I wish I was, girl, so I could hold you, again

Build your castle in the sky, now no one can tell you lies,
Heaven's not so far if I can see you in my dreams
When I feel my time is near, I won't be sad cause you'll be there
I know you're right there waiting for me, yeah, yeah, yeah

It's hard to make it on my own
I need your love girl, so much more than I'd ever known
Sometimes it's hard to breathe
Sometimes it hurts so bad, girl, that I just fall to my knees.

Yeah, waiting for me (I never thought that you would wait for me)
No, waiting for you (I didn't think that we could never be)
Yeah, waiting for me (I never thought that you woul-)
Yeah waiting for me

Build your castle in the sky, now no one can tell you lies,
