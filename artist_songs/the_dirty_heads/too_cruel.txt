I got an open mind, like a golden child
You try to go for points, I try to go for style
I do my city proud, I try to keep it wide
Ichiban, wicked one, Okinawa loud
I drank Guinnesses and go to dinner with my nemesis
Have a couple laughs while they plot how to finish this
Interested on how to get up on a wizard list
Senseless, you sense I'm the Sensei you 'prentices

I'm the salt up in the cut
Who you tryna play but us?
Like a DJ turning stuff
Who you tryna fool?
We all know that shit's unplugged

We're so cruel
Yeah, cruel
Yeah, cruel
Alright
No, we're so cruel
Yeah, cruel
Yeah, cruel
Alright
No, we're so cruel

I'm howling at the moon
Harry fucking Henderson
Catch me in the mood
I ain't too cool for wrecking shit
Stoners on the loose
Call that shit a hippy flip
And we just getting going
Yeah this shit's just my starter kit
I'm on a good one, real fucking good one
I'm feeling brand new, yeah I'm talking redone
I'm talking 'bout me, talking 'bout the real one
I'm not with Jenny tossin' rocks at the building
How they stoned, all that shit
So fly, call me pilot
MCs getting turn a kit
Body bag that murder vic'
The seven dance is evident
We stampede: an elephant
We crash out on king beds,
Y'all bitches soft like pillow mints

We're so cruel
Yeah, cruel
Yeah, cruel
Alright
No, we're so cruel
Yeah, cruel
Yeah, cruel
Alright
No, we're so cruel

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, no we're so cruel
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, no we're so cruel
Act so pure, but you're far from farm breed
Think your charm could disarm an army
Said it's hard to stop me, I'm far from obvi-Us
When a bus parks fucking hockey
Her pot of coffee went Abu Dhabi
And my dick went limp like some Laffy Taffy
But her body stopped me, and I'm tired of talking
You want an accent? Here's a mouth full of Cockney
Said you wanna ring and you think that I'll drop me
Just for some pussy that'll bust outta Box Spring
All of the times that you tried to off me
The tables are turned and now the music is offbeat
You wanted me back, so you keep kissing me softly
I'd rather jack off in a sock with some hot tea
I'm over and out, we're like a walkie-talkie
I'm leaving now bitch, try to stop me

We're so cruel
Yeah, cruel
Yeah, cruel
Alright
No, we're so cruel
Yeah, cruel
Yeah, cruel
Alright
No, we're so cruel

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, no we're so cruel
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, no we're so cruel
