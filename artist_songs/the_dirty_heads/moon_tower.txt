Let's go outside
Look up at the stars tonight
See 'em when the full's out
You can meet me at the moon tower
Let's all get high
Look up at the starlit sky
Let's all go for a ride
Meet me at the moon tower tonight

Yeah, yeah
Man school's out forever
Long live the summer, sayonara cold weather
I'm talking joints and margaritas
Girls rocking hoodies, wearing three-stripped Adidas
We on a mission for a good time, going all-in
You bring a joint man? Well it'd be cooler if you did
Cause I don't know, yeah I don't know where the night will go

Driving down a dark road
Rolling down the window
Hands out, hands out, hands out now

Let's go outside
Look up at the stars tonight
See 'em when the full's out
You can meet me at the moon tower
Let's all get high
Look up at the starlit sky
Let's all go for a ride
Meet me at the moon tower tonight
The moon tower tonight
Meet me at the moon tower tonight

Welcome to the magic hour; night shade green
Sky's crying light like we're living in a dream
Are we lying on the ground? Are we floating in the beam?
My mind is feeling galaxies I ain't ever seen
I want to take this trip, so I can taste your lips
And this weightlessness, outer space and kiss
And this maintenance on my face is bliss
Making love up in the moon tower just for kicks

Driving down a dark road
Rolling down the window
Hands out, hands out, hands out now
Driving down a dark road
Rolling down the window
Hands out, hands out, hands out now

Let's go outside
Look up at the stars tonight
See 'em when the full's out
You can meet me at the moon tower
Let's all get high
Look up at the starlit sky
Let's all go for a ride
Meet me at the moon tower tonight
The moon tower tonight
Meet me at the moon tower tonight

Driving down a dark road
The moon tower tonight
Rolling down the window
The moon tower tonight
Driving down a dark road
The moon tower tonight
Rolling down the window

We goin' up, never coming down
We goin' up, never coming down
We goin' up, never coming down
We goin' up, never coming down
We goin' up, never coming down
We goin' up, never coming down
We goin' up, never coming down
We goin' up, never coming down
We goin' up
