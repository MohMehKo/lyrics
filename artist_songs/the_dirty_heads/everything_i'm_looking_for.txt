This time I'm sure girl, what I'm looking for.
Yes, you're all that I need, girl, and more.
I say, I sing, you filled the gap, yeah.
Ya let me relax, oh, and I've forgotten all I was worried of.
Ya make me feel so right, yeah.
Yeah, even when I'm wrong.
Oh, and I wonder what took me so long.
Could ya tell me what took me so long?

Oooh well she's got everything I'm lookin', everything I'm lookin', yes everything I'm looking for.
Well baby you got everything I need and more.
One more time, I sing,
Everything I'm lookin', everything I'm lookin', yes everything I'm looking for.
Well baby you got everything I need and more.

I'll never make another lover a victim,
I'll never forget my mother's wisdom.
She taught me love, oh, well she taught me soul.
I'll never forget these words of my father,
He told me, "Son," he said "don't let life bother you,
There's nothing out there that you can't do, no."
And then he said, "When you're stressed out and feeling down, son,
Just take a deep breath and look around, son.
The sky is blue, oh yes, the sun it shines right down on you.
Oh, no matter what you got people here lovin you."

Well I guess got everything I'm lookin', everything I'm lookin', yes everything I'm looking for.
Well baby you got everything I need and more.
One more time, I sing,
Everything I'm lookin', everything I'm lookin', yes everything I'm looking for.
Well baby you got everything I need and more.

So jam it now
So jam it now

Well I guess I got everything I'm lookin', everything I'm lookin', yes everything I'm looking for.
I guess I got everything I need and more.
One more time, I sing,
Everything I'm lookin', everything I'm lookin', yes everything and more.
I guess sometimes we just forget what we're livin' for.
