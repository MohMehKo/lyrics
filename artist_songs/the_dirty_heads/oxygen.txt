Tornado, I see you coming around
Don't let go, you know I'm holding you down
People shouldn't change like the weather, man
People shouldn't change if they innocent
People act strange when it's getting out of beat
So let me be your oxygen

Please don't go, I will stay
When everyone is leaving and you're feeling strange
See them fall, hear them say
Trying to breathe but you're feeling strange
Oh woah, feel like you're living, but you might be better off dead
If you're going under then
I'll be your oxygen
I'll be your oxygen
I'll be your oxygen
I'll be your oxygen, yeah

Domino, this world keeps knocking you down
Let them know, no one can push you around
Getting hard to breathe in the everland
Feels like you never see the sun again
Domino, this world keeps knocking you down

Please don't go, I will stay
When everyone is leaving and you're feeling strange
See them fall, hear them say
Trying to breathe but you're feeling strange
Oh woah, feel like you're living, but you might be better off dead
If you're going under then
I'll be your oxygen
I'll be your oxygen
I'll be your oxygen
I'll be your oxygen, yeah

Laughing with these feelings in your head
They don't mean nothing, they don't mean nothing, no
Feeding off the words that they all said
They don't mean nothing, no

Please don't go, I will stay
When everyone is leaving and you're feeling strange
See them fall, hear them say
Trying to breathe but you're feeling strange
Please don't go, I will stay
When everyone is leaving and you're feeling strange
See them fall, hear them say
Trying to breathe but you're feeling strange
Oh woah, feel like you're living, but you might be better off dead
If you're goin under, then I'll be your oxygen
I'll be your oxygen
I'll be your oxygen
I'll be your oxygen, yeah
