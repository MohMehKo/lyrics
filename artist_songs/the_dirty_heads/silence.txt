Check my haiku
Written on bamboo
Get another tattoo
As I light up a camel
Just might have a fight at night
While I write by the light of the candle
When the vibe gets low and the mind will show
And the voice begin to ramble
Leave me for dead and take my head
Raise a cup put up on the mantel
Lifes color’s vibrant
Wonder where the time went
I am living priceless while your life is on consignment
Sniper with alliance
Rifle breaks the silence
I’m shooting off my mouth to show
The essence of defiance
Time to shred rage is on
If the feeling ain’t right then I’d rather be wrong
And if this night’s just right hangovers long
Molotov night
Mobbin’ on
Smile on my face in the middle of a riot
Looking from the top
Even if you wanna try it
You meet me at the highest
Leave ‘em with the lighter
It’s dark in the shadows when you’re hanging out with giants 

Cast away to an island
Nothing’s harder than hiding
Being all by myself
You’re resorting to violence
You turned into a tyrant
Telling me stop being silent
But the silence deafening 

But the silence deafening
But the silence deafening 

Captive I hold in my words like hostages
Push me too far I unload my battle ship
I’m on the edge my short fuse it has been lit
Cause you create madness
I crave the opposite
Like smoke and mirrors
Hurricane
Numb as hell
Novocaine
Close the window, pouring rain
Man, too much booze and Vicodin
It’s time to go and I’m gone
You can’t touch the high that I’m on
You don’t know my state of mind yeah
I’ve gone too far and beyond
I’m light years away and I’m fine
My course is set to incline
No one can break my silence
They so violently keep trying
I’m just holding on to what’s real
I’m searching out for what’s true
You can take all that you want
But I’m not stopping till I’m through 

Cast away to an island
Nothing’s harder than hiding
Being all by myself
You’re resorting to violence
You turned into a tyrant
Telling me stop being silent
But the silence deafening 

Cast away to an island
Nothing’s harder than hiding
Being all by myself
You’re resorting to violence
You turned into a tyrant
Telling me stop being silent
But the silence deafening

But the silence deafening
But the silence deafening
But the silence deafening
But the silence deafening
But the silence deafening

But the silence deafening
