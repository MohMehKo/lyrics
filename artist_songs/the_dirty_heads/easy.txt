It's easy
I got time to get high I got time to get by.
It's easy
We got time for mistakes we got time to re-try
It's easy
So live fast and die young and don't wait till you're done
It's easy
And the world keeps spinning long after you're gone.

Well it's the only life I know, and boy how we have grown, life will make us change in our own ways.
And when we're dead and gone, the world keeps moving on, so I live my life like it's my final day.
And no I ain't got much to lose, and no there ain't much left to gain, so I'm satisfied sometimes just staying sayin'.
Well I've often lost my mind, and I've gone crazy sometimes, but I know some how I'm gonna find my way

Well I'm stuck in the middle of a gun fight, I'm stuck in the middle of a showdown,
I'm standing in the dirt and watching tumble weeds pass by.
I'm stuck in the middle of a high noon, I'm stuck in the middle of a typhoon,
I got more fucking rhymes than the stars up in the sky.
It's the good it's the bad it's the ugly then there's me, so I guess I'm a little bit of all three.
It's the heater lyrical bandolero out your speaker always looking for dinero.
So what you really thinking about hmmm something, I'll tell you what you're thinking about hmmm nothing.

And the world keeps spinning long after you're gone.
