Picking up slack, you live for it lady
You never have a good time and go
Takin' it back, you try for it daily
You only like that old rock 'n roll
You wait for the night you're rockin' it steady
You can't stop and fuck up your flow
You fight from the fix
The weight of it's heavy
You feel like you'll never let go

[Pre-Chorus:]
And over, and over
And over, and over again
Oh yeah
Over, and over
And over, and over again

[Chorus:]
Look to the warming sun
We left the troubles all around the town
You know we didn't hurt no one
We lit the sky up then we burned it down

Slippin' in time, we move with it only
We didn't know the night went so fast
We broke all our bones
The city, it owed we
We never let it live in the past
We live in the light, we wake with it slowly
Learn to love the one thing that lasts
When daybreak came on
It was one thing it showed me
That there was nothing left in our path

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

Oh, 'round and 'round we go
Oh, now we reapin' what we sowed
Oh, 'round and 'round we go
And ooo

[Chorus]
