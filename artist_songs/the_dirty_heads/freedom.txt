Shout it from the South
If you're feeling better
I don't wanna stop
Can you hear it calling?

Like it was London underground, 1980 honesties
Sound system hits, so you walking on the streets
A fast chat on good wax
Tied up the mass tax
So we need some freedom just one night to let the hate pass
Settle a bet with another cocaine
Russian Roulette, but I'm rushing your brain
Comin' around, you huffin' again
Glue from your bag? You fucking insane
How was it made? Charlamagne
Sorting the stone; call it a game
Shout it like an old school DJ: pon de replay!
We lose it like a madhouse without sedatives, we elements
Floating through the sky without our red wings and our medicine
It's heaven-sent, I'm setting in
It's hell up and irrelevant
Who you think you letting in your party? We come in through the vents

A little bit of freedom tonight
I need a little peace in my life
I need a little freedom tonight
You know it's got me feeling alright

Under pressure
I'm rolling down my window, need some fresh air
I'm blowing out these wings
I leave my demons in St. Elsewhere
Cause I just need some freedom
A reason to get reckless
I'm starting to get restless
Knock some buckets off my checklist
I'm rolling up my sleeves, my energy can be infectious
I'm climbing out the grave just like my heart's been resurrected
I finally feel alive, look at my future's redirected
And I'm just moving forward
Fuck the past, that shit's dissected
Yeah, it's my time right now
Don't get it misunderstood
Cause that feeling's right and the vibe is good
And [?] like boys in the hood
Takes me back to my backward hat
Old skate shoes and my Cadillac
Leaning the cube
Dazed and confused
Got drive [?] full of molecules
So hot on the mic and I can't be stopped
God [?] take what I got
[?] and the dick so deep: Fraggle Rock
Yeah, lost in thought, but I found my own
Lost my mind, but I found my zone
I'm tripping and you're vibing and I-I

A little bit of freedom tonight
I need a little peace in my life
I need a little freedom tonight
You know it's got me feeling alright

You want freedom? Look in the mirror
And say, "yes master."
Show no fear
Through disasters, way past the pasture
Still troubled out and run fast
With no capture
All smiles, miles from the fly
And a perfect rapture
Keep happily adapting to the next chapter
Lost in peaceful thoughts, engulfed in laughter
They built the wall, we'll build the ladder
Help me up, where's your manners?
Mixed in blenders
Friends then scattered
So fragile they've been shattered
Till nothing matters
Cut the chatter and adapt to listenin'
Envisioning better days
Mentally richer, Benjamin
Still a slave to change; I'm free
Let's throw a parade
I feel liberated
Thanks to those who paved the way

A little bit of freedom tonight
I need a little peace in my life
I need a little freedom tonight
You know it's got me feeling alright
