There was a bright colored garland
In the lights of my garden
She said calm yourself darling
I'll find your piece of mind for you

Into the darkness, we'll find our freedom
Our hearts are one and together they're beating
Stars they are falling at night so appealing
This feels like love and love feels like healing
Anticipation slowly is building
We'll find our peace in this night so revealing 
This is the moment, I hear it calling
We'll sit together and watch as the stars they are falling for you

They're falling, they're falling
She's calling
They're falling

There was a bright colored garland
In the lights of my garden
She said calm yourself darling
I'll find your piece of mind for you

When my levels are stressed
Reach the peak of their crest
I smell the flowers in the hair
I feel the lightness of her dress
I lay my head down and hear your heart through your chest
We can breathe it in together 
We can blow one out, the best
You tend my worries
All my trouble and dreams
We can bury 'em together, always knowing one thing
When it grows from the earth, it's a rebirth that sings
And if it comes to fall apart, it's a new start that brings

They're falling, they're falling
She's calling
They're falling

There was a bright colored garland
In the lights of my garden
She said calm yourself darling
I'll find your piece of mind for you

We walked alone inside our garden
She showed me all the things I knew I'd do, I knew I'd do
We walked alone inside our garden

There was a bright colored garland
In the lights of my garden
She said calm yourself darling
I'll find your piece of mind for you

There was a bright colored garland
(we walked alone inside our garden)
In the lights of my garden
She said calm yourself darling
(she showed me all the things I knew I'd do, I knew I'd do)
I'll find your piece of mind for you
