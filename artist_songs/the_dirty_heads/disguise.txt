The one life to live so Ima live it
The one chance to give so Ima give it
All that I have with no limit
We made it this far but it’s only the beginning

Got my eyes set strictly on the prizes
Standing in my own two shoes my whole life is
Easier said than done but I survive it
Aim for the stars dream big and don’t hide it

I got my head up in the clouds now
I’m so high I’m never coming down
I like living up here watching life from the sky
Everything becomes clear

And as the mist rises I can see horizons
A new day has dawned I’m just happy to be alive
Ima make it to the top and if not I die trying
If I’m lying watch my nose grow Barbara Streisand

I got my head up in the clouds now
I’m so high I’m never coming down
I like living up here watching life from the sky
Everything becomes clear

[Chorus]
When life is boring
Write your own story
In skies you’re soaring
When life is surreal
Put on your disguise
And just live in the sky
Put on your disguise
And just live in the sky

I’ve seen things I just can’t explain
I’ve seen the fire and I’ve seen the rain
I’ve been places and ask questions
But was told that my answers were blowing in the wind

So now I follow the purple haze
All the way through the everglades
I’ve broken to to the other side
Just to find myself building castles in the sky

Never rise up I can see reality below me
Flowing on a dream to the house of the holy
Hands clinch tight praying death come slowly
Cause life is too short to give up what you're holding

I got my head up in the clouds now
I’m so high I’m never coming down
I like living up here watching life from the sky
Everything becomes clear

[Chorus]
When life is boring
Write your own story
In skies you’re soaring
When life is surreal
Put on your disguise
And just live in the sky
Put on your disguise
And just live in the sky

When life is boring
I chill on story?
And the sky is so ream
When life is so real
Throw it up in the sky
And this living skies
Running in the skies
This living skies

When life is boring
I chill on story?
And the sky is so ream
When life is so real
Throw it up in the sky
And this living skies
Running in the skies
This living skies
