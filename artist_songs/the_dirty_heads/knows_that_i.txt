She knows that I
I'm never ever gonna run away
So close your eyes
Cause words only get in the way

Maybe you wanna love me
Maybe you wanna leave
Maybe you wanna run to him
Or stay here with me

And now you sit and stare with a crooked smile
Sit think in your own denial
Admit when we touched our lips
It hit both you and I
A heart with a different name
Ashamed that you felt the same
Deal with the pain and still remain
Or hope for a change

She's like a welcome summer rain, comes with perfect timing
She said love needs pressure, pressure turns to diamonds
Like a welcome summer rain, comes with perfect timing
Love needs pressure
Well pressure makes diamonds

She knows that I
I'm never ever gonna run away
She knows that I
I'm crazy but I'm not insane
She knows that I
Mean every word that I say
So close your eyes
Cause words only get in the way

Well I got this loving feeling up inside of my soul
It's like every step I take I feel it calling me home
I'm put in situations just so hard for me to stay true
But its so easy for me cause I keep thinking of you
And our love, it keeps me knowing everything will be fine
And your love, it keeps me going when I'm losing my mind
And your love, it keeps me warm when I'm sleeping alone
It's your love that keeps me strong. I can't wait to get home

She's like a welcome summer rain, comes with perfect timing
She said love needs pressure, pressure turns to diamonds
Like a welcome summer rain, comes with perfect timing
Love needs pressure
Well pressure makes diamonds

She knows that I
I'm never ever gonna run away
She knows that I
I'm crazy but I'm not insane
She knows that I
Mean every word that I say
So close your eyes
Cause words only get in the way

Go to him and say
I'm gone, you never thought I could go
I'm gone, you never loved me so
I'm gone, you never thought I could go
I'm gone
I'm gone

She knows that I
I'm never ever gonna run away
She knows that I
I'm crazy but I'm not insane
She knows that I
Mean every word that I say
So close your eyes
Cause words only get in the way
