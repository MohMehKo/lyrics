In my neighborhood
I never sweat when I'm
In my neighborhood
I feel much better when I'm
In my neighborhood
I never sweat when I'm
In my neighborhood
I feel much better when I'm
In my neighborhood
I never sweat it when I'm
In my neighborhood
I never sweat it

Well I just got out the water
And I'm late for school I asked dirty
To skip and said that's cool
So I grabbed up on my skate
And we went to get a magnum
I said fuck it make the grade graduation
I don't have it and now its 3 years later
And I still haven't walked
I used to get kicked out of class
Now I get paid for when I talk
And you can jump on my streets
That I come from beach I now that you're pissed
Cuz you didn't make this beat
And I know you don't like me
But I know you like my flow
I know you don't like me cuz I say dude and bro
Lot of rappers talk bout things they don't know
How to do drugs have sex get drunk and rock a show
I love coming home cuz its always so wonderful
Cuz when you're in your neighborhood
You're much more comfortable.

[Chorus]

Went out of my way your feeling alone
As a distance pressures away you could be home where I fit in.
I'm reminiscing about the days were we didn't care
Two dirty kids with no shoes and long hair
No car but front porch and two chairs
No place to go no way to get there

These Cali woman be the best I've seen
Be the best I've seen be the best I've seen
Cali weed be the brightest green
Be the brightest green be the brightest green.

[Chorus]

Move stop move move move stop
Move stop move move move stop
Let the beat drop dr-dr-dr-drop
Beat drop dr-dr-dr-drop

[Chorus x2]
