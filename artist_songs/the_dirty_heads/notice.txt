I was a fool for playin' it cool,
I tell ya
You made it clear it wasn't workin' for you
I couldn't get just a passin' glance
And you didn't know
So I'm tellin' you now and I'm takin' this chance, to let you know

I wish you'd notice (notice) when I'm not around
I wish you'd notice (notice) when I'm not around
So I could show this (show this) new love that I've found
I wish you'd notice (notice) when I'm not around

If I could read your mind and find out what to do,
I'd do it
I'd change up my style all the way to my shoes
You're lookin' now
Situation arisin', am I breakin' the rules?
Will you tell me
If I try to get a little attention from you,
What do I do to make you

Notice when I'm not around
This is hopeless and bringin' me down
I wanna show this new love that I found
To make you notice when I'm not around

I said that the trance that you had me in
No longer pulls at my heart like a tidal wind
And now that I've gone,
Now I've moved on,
You'll no longer hear me singin' this song
Like

Notice when I'm not around
You're so hopeless, it's bringin' you down
I tried to show this new love that I found
And now you notice when I'm not around
