Whenever the times get rough
Whenever you've had enough
Whenever the shine wears off
Forever, you're still gold to me [repeat]

You're still gold to me

Cool is the temperature we always staying frozen
This is the color of our life we staying golden
Strong is our bond deep is our love deep as that ocean
Weeding through the fake and gravitating to devotion

I'm tearing down all these walls that surround me
Open up my mind and let my voice start shining
Speak the truth react the words spoken
Hold on to these walls I've been holding you

Whenever the times get rough
Whenever you've had enough
Whenever the shine wears off
Forever, you're still gold to me [repeat]

You're still gold to me

High is the state of mind I mean I move slow motion
Calm is the energy I give my mind is open
I've seen so many people live their life with hate inside
It blows my mind to think that he just can't focus on that brighter side

I hear the sounds of your song all around me
Open up your heart and feel this love that's surrounding
Speak the truth react the words spoken
Hold on to these ones that stay gold to you

In time I'll tell who your friends are
Keep em close keep your enemies closer
I believe there is good in all
Then some lose their way and fall
Yet I remain true

Whenever the times get rough
Whenever you've had enough
Whenever the shine wears off
Forever, you're still gold to me [x2]

You're still gold to me [x5]
