Her name was Lily his was Todd
She was tall and he was odd,
And all the other girls said she was too fat for the squad
She just wanted friends
He just wanted broads
He'd do anything for pussy, change his ways he swore to god
He needs to straighten up
He isn't smart enough
I wouldn't be his date
He doesn't dress like us
Remember all the times that he got beat up on the bus
But what he learned from that was to be careful who you trust
He knew that they were wrong so he took it with a yawn
He knew his time would come and he'd be moving on
So he locked himself inside a room and started writing songs
You could catch him in the back of class singing all along like

Check the level cause something's coming over me
Something's got a hold of me always controlling me
It's in the audio, it's in the air, it's in the way you move
It's everywhere, it's something beautiful, that you don't know
So feel the audio, and let it go

So back to miss lily when she used to let the days pass
Sitting home alone sucking food up off her placemat
They used to call her fat so she started losing weight fast
Got sick in debate class, to throw up what she ate last
She didn't know that the things they said that left her hurting
Would actually turn out to make her a better person
She locked herself inside her room got to the rehearsing
Walking down a runway in a dress she made from curtains
So she was slimming up
She was tall enough
She became a model she was paid and she was loved
See what they thought they knew about these two was givin up
Cause no matter what they said these two just didn't give a fuck
They had it all along they just figured it out
How to take the negativity and turn it all around
Now lily's turning heads up on the runway in Milan
And Todd is selling millions while his fans sing along like

Check the level cause something's coming over me
Something's got a hold of me always controlling me
It's in the audio, it's in the air, it's in the way you move
It's everywhere, it's something beautiful, that you don't know
So feel the audio, and let it go
It's the six string slayer the rhyme cultivator
Picking home grown rhyme straight out the incubator
Cross fade to the right while I slide to the left
There's something coming over me controlling every breath
Gasping for air my fears burn through

If there's something in the audio then what they said was true
Full speed ahead code red phase two
The sound waves control the minds of me and you
It's in the audio, it's something beautiful, that you don't know
So feel the audio, and let it go
