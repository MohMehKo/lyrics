She said she's free after 8
I said that's perfect, not too early, not too late, yeah yeah
Let it be, let it be your escape
We can float, we can float away-ay

Baby let's smoke and dream
Baby let's smoke and sing
Baby let's go outside
Baby let's smoke and dream
Baby let's smoke and sing
Baby let's feel alright

And if you want...
Give me your, give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your, give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your, give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your, give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your love

Yeah, love and levitation
I hold you close and we share some smoke celebration
Yeah, love is motivation
I still got hope cause I found that love is salvation
We'll roll one up and live life like hippies on vacation
Day dreaming, no boundaries, and no separation
Live life like we on one
Two joints in the morning
Three more when the sun's gone
Better hold on when we float on
Live life like we on one
Two joints in the morning
Three more when the sun's gone
Better hold on when we float on

Baby let's smoke and dream
Baby let's smoke and sing
Baby let's go outside
Baby let's smoke and dream
Baby let's smoke and sing
Baby let's feel alright

And if you want...
Give me your, give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your, give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your, give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your, give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your love
