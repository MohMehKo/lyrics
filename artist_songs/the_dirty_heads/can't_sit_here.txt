Can't sit here man, seat's taken
Ain't no room for these mother fuckers fakin
Filling up my mind space, taking up my head room
I'm just trying to chill and get stoned in my bedroom
Imma keep it real, far out, fuckin' Neptune
We be getting loose, footloose, no sunday shoe
If you need me, I'll be gettin' nude near the blue lagoon
We be gettin' crazy, motor city, man Ted Nug
I be run a hat, stuck a racoon, D boone
You ain't got shit on my locks Vidal Sassoon
Blast from the past but I'm back to relax you
Two joints in the morning and two more in the afternoon

And yea two more after that too
I'ma hit it so hard, I turn the joint black and blue
And now I'm chillin' like I always do
And that's my lesson on how to change your attitude

Yea well if the world should crumble down around me, I'll (never give it up)
Yea and if the darkness falls and surrounds me, I'm (never giving up)
Yea and if the ground is all I that have found then I'll (never give it up)
And I believe you're all you that you perceive so y'all best believe that I'm (never giving up)
I'm never giving up, I'll never give it up...

Yea I'll be out here, I'll be out here all day
And I'll be out here doing this shit my way
It feels good yea feeling good all day
I ain't got shit to do and it's Friday
I'm goin in yea, goin in all the way
I never leave a show - do or die, I always say
And I ain't givin up even if the skies are grey
Cause we got work to do, we all got a price to pay
But hard work pays off man in dividends
And this shit makes me feel like I'm a kid again
Yea takin over - that's the state of mind I'm livin in
Cause I ain't givin up, no I ain't ever givin in

So thankful, show my gratitude
Imma roll one up if the shit turnin black and blue
And now I'm chillin like I always do
And that's my lesson on how to change your attitude

Yea well if the world should crumble down around me, I'll (never give it up)
Yea and if the darkness falls and surrounds me, I'm (never giving up)
Yea and if the ground is all I that have found then I'll (never give it up)
And I believe you're all you that you perceive so y'all best believe that I'm (never giving up)

Even if I was the last man on earth
And still residing on the sunny side of dirt
Then I would build a stage for myself with no curtains
I would do a play every day for the birds then
I ain't givin up if I ain't drippin blood
And I ain't givin up if I don't see my guts
I ain't givin up if I ain't grippin guns
I am overrun but tryin to show some love
Everybody please put your two fingers up

And if the world should crumble down around me I
And if the darkness falls and surrounds me I
And if the ground is all I've found then I
And I believe I'll make it there this time

Yea well if the world should crumble down around me, I'll (never give it up)
Yea and if the darkness falls and surrounds me, I'm (never giving up)
Yea and if the ground is all I that have found then I'll (never give it up)
Yea and I believe you're all you that you perceive so y'all best believe that I'm (never giving up)
I'm never giving up, I'll never give it up...
