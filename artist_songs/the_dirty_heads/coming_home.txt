I'm coming home
It won't be too long
And I will be there
By the rise of the sun
I've been waiting oh so patiently to hold you near
Never let you go, and never let you go

Heeeeeeey I feel it in my soul, I feel it in my soul
Heeeeeeey I never let you go

Well I've been alone, since I been gone
Out on the road, so girl just hold on
I've been waiting, oh so patiently to hold you near
Never let you go, I never let you go

Heeeeeeey I feel it in my soul, I feel it in my soul
Heeeeeeey I never let you go

To your arms I run
To your heart I strum, to the beat
To your love I am, only just a man
Control me

To your arms I run
To your heart I strum, to the beat
To your love I am, only just a man
Control me
Yeah Control me

Heeeeeeey I feel it in my soul, I feel it in my soul
Heeeeeeey I never let you go I never let you go
