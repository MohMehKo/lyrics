Well, you never quite forget the first tape you bought
Mine was Naughty by Nature back when OPP was hot
Who'd have thought that I could ever turn out this way?
I'm blaming Ad-Rock, Mike D and MCA
Yeah, it was Beasties on my mind pretty much all the time
Till I started smoking pot and figured out about Sublime
Oh my God, I never wanted something so badly
I wanted to learn to play guitar and sing just like Bradley
And the B-lines that Eric dropped reminded me of hip hop
And I'm singin', "Lovin' is what I got, I got, I got"
'Cause when the loving was gone
I learned to play the blues through Stevie Ray Vaughn
I needed music for all the ways it helped me feel
And now I'm loving my guitar the way that B.B. loved Lucille

Can you feel it (yeah)
I'm like 6 damn strings never sounded so appealing
Can you feel it (yeah)
I'm like once you grab the mic you better sing like you believe
Like you believe
Like you believe
Like you believe

Well Bob Marley was the tune, little J was in the womb
My mom would put the headphones on her belly, feel me move
And every Jimi Hendrix riff, I'd give her a little kick
Just to let her know to turn it up a little bit
And "Please, when I grow up can I sound like Police? "
That's what I was thinkin' while I prayed on my knees
But now that I'm grown, I found a sound of my own
I'm in the studio now and I feel I'm home

Can you feel it (yeah)
I'm like 6 damn strings never sounded so appealing
Can you feel it (yeah)
I'm like once you grab the mic you better sing like you believe
Like you believe
Like you believe
Like you believe

Well now my music's been shelved
Because these people don't believe in me
But I'm a fill the shelf up
Before they hear the end of me
I'll be writin' songs until the end of all eternity
I never went to college, man, my band was my fraternity
Never stick my nose into shit that ain't concernin' me,
But I'll be the first to swing, man, if you're burnin' me
Every day you wait is just another day wasted
I'm so damn close, man, I can taste it

Can you feel it (yeah)
I'm like 6 damn strings never sounded so appealing
Can you feel it (yeah)
I'm like once you grab the mic you better sing like you believe
Like you believe
Like you believe
Like you believe
Like you believe in you, like you [x4]
