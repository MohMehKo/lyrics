When I'm just trying to kill time
I got my headphones
And when I'm waiting in line
I got my headphones

I try to come up with rhymes
Up in my headphones
Up in my headphones
Up in my headphones

Step in in the club and feel the bass from the drums
Every time I rap I get stupid dumb
I got the type of voice that make you bleed from your gums
So give me some coke, boy and don't forget the rum

Because it's Dirty J and I don't like to boast
Well, I'm an MC but I wear my pants tighter than most
I like spike belts and hitting high notes
I like punk rock bitches with the fur coats

I rock broken laces sometimes a low brim
And I got people searching for me like I was animal chin

When I'm just trying to kill time
I got my headphones
And when I'm waiting in line
I got my headphones

I try to come up with rhymes
Up in my headphones
Up in my headphones
Up in my headphones

And when you drive me insane
I got my headphones
And when I get on a plane
They give me headphones

Just to turn up my brain
I put my headphone
Up in my headphones
Up in my headphones

Well, it's the continental beat, man, making beats man
With these headphones I'm making beats while I'm traveling
I got my eyes shut, yo, I got my head back
And yes, you know I got more volumes that's a foe blast, foe blast

And if you hear these words then move back
Because it's the fundamental beat man, with the disk man
Making beats in my head in the back of the van
Yo in the back of the van

When I'm just trying to kill time
I got my headphones
And when I'm waiting in line
I got my headphones

I try to come up with rhymes
Up in my headphones
Up in my headphones
Up in my headphones

And when you drive me insane
I got my headphones
And when I get on a plane
They give me headphones

Just to turn up my brain
I put my headphone
Up in my headphones
Up in my headphones

When I'm just trying to kill time
I got my headphones
And when I'm waiting in line
I got my headphones

I try to come up with rhymes
Up in my headphones
Up in my headphones
Up in my headphones

And when you drive me insane
I got my headphones
And when I get on a plane
They give me headphones

Just to turn up my brain
I put my headphone
Up in my headphones
Up in my headphones
