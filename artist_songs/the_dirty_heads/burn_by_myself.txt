Well the fires been licking its lips at me
And it's hungry from what I can tell
Feed it some leaf to make its peace
Don't wanna burn by myself
By myself by myself
Don't wanna burn by myself
By myself by myself
Don't wanna burn by my self

Well it's still burning bright from what I can see
And I really could use some help
Will you give it some water to quench this beast
Don't think I can do it myself
Cause that fires been licking its lips at me
And it's hungry from what I can tell
Feed it some leaf to make its peace
Don't wanna burn by myself

By myself by myself
Don't wanna burn by myself
By myself by myself
Wanna share it with somebody else

Won't you please, please pass it to me

You know it's been moving so well
Keep it going strong till all of its gone
One more to all of our health
Cause that fires been licking its lips at me
And it's hungry from what I can tell
Feed it some leaf to make its peace
Don't wanna burn by myself
By myself by myself
Don't wanna burn by myself
By myself by myself
Wanna share it with somebody else

Well the fires been licking its lips at me
And it's hungry from what I can tell
Feed it some leaf to make its peace
Don't wanna burn by myself
By myself by myself
Don't wanna burn by myself
By myself by myself
Don't wanna burn by myself
By myself by myself
Don't wanna burn by myself
By myself by myself
Wanna share it with somebody else
