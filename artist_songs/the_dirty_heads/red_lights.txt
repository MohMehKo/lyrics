Blurred eyes on the highway
Raindrops on the window
Don't stop for the sirens
Sound of the tyrant gone with the wind blows
Get lost in the moment
Find peace in the night
It is what it is, you can't stop shit
Just go with the flow till the flow feels right
I go to the glow of the light
And I know when the moment's right
Keep hoping I feel less sight
Cause you lost control when the flames ignite
Calm down when I breathe in
Exhale with a reason
I float above, vision's above
Looks like the sky is bleeding

I feel like it lasts for so long
It's getting harder to find my way back home
I do not care, I'm fine right here
I feel I'm better off out on my own

Staring at these red lights
Trying to keep my head right
I don't need no bullshit
Keep it from my eyesight
Staring at these red lights
Trying to keep my head right
I don't need no bullshit
Keep it from my eyesight
You cannot stop me, I'm the vital one
Let me get lost in my delirium
You cannot stop me, I'm the vital one
Let me get lost in my delirium

Lately I've been lazy-eyed
Caught in my mind like a crazy guy
Foaming at the mouth like a rabies bite
Wishing I'd be vaporized
Floating around like we're rating's high
Fuck in the sky like a mating fly
Shit ain't free like it's '80s night
So back on the ground till my plane is fried
Sitting in the shadows of the battles that I can't escape
Seething, think I'm bleeding, while I'm leaning on my lidocaine
One punch, one K, Titan like I'm anime
Yeah that'd be great if you could step out of my office space

I feel like it lasts for so long
It's getting harder to find my way back home
I do not care, I'm fine right here
I feel I'm better off out on my own

Staring at these red lights
Trying to keep my head right
I don't need no bullshit
Keep it from my eyesight
Staring at these red lights
Trying to keep my head right
I don't need no bullshit
Keep it from my eyesight
You cannot stop me, I'm the vital one
Let me get lost in my delirium
You cannot stop me, I'm the vital one
Let me get lost in my delirium

Let me get lost
You cannot stop me

Staring at these red lights
Trying to keep my head right
I don't need no bullshit
Keep it from my eyesight
Staring at these red lights
Trying to keep my head right
I don't need no bullshit
Keep it from my eyesight
You cannot stop me, I'm the vital one
Let me get lost in my delirium
You cannot stop me, I'm the vital one
Let me get lost in my delirium
