She said she heard me on the radio
She said I even sounded good in her car through her 87 stereo
Yeah she thought I was cool, but you don't know me at all
He said he heard me on the radio
He said I said every word that he was thinking 
Man he felt like we're related though
Yeah he thought I was cool, but you don't know me at all
(You thought you know me cause you listen to the songs I'm singing)

But they don't talk about my bad days 
And they don't know they price that I've paid
What I've lost
How I've tried 
Yeah I close my eyes and just keep moving on

I don't care about what they say
I don't do it for the payday
No I don't
And I won't
Yeah I close my eyes and just keep moving on

She said she heard me on the radio 
She said I even sounded good in her car through her 87 stereo
Yeah she thought I was cool, but you don't know me at all
He said he heard me on the radio
He said I said every word that he was thinking 
Man he felt like we're related though
Yeah he thought I was cool, but you don't know me at all
(You thought you know me cause you listen to the songs I'm singing)

I'm still looking for the right line
I really think I'm losing my mind
Yes I do, I do, yes it's true
But I close my eyes and just keep moving on
You don't hear me when I'm screaming
And just like you I got my demons
Yes I do, we do
So close your eyes and just keep moving on

She said she heard me on the radio 
She said I even sounded good in her car through her 87 stereo
Yeah she thought I was cool, but you don't know me at all
He said he heard me on the radio
He said I said every word that he was thinking 
man he felt like we're related though
Yeah he thought I was cool, but you don't know me at all

We do it all for us
We do it all for you
Yeah, no matter what happens with this love 
we can all get through
