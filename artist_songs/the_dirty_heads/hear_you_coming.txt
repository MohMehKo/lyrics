[Verse 1:]
Yeah, tell me what's your name, who's your daddy
Said we can take it back like when Duddy had a Caddy
This trench coat talk, make it snappy
See you with your heels walk a shame through the lobby
With your long leg stride private eye
Girl you got secrets that your walls can't hide
Room double-o-seven like a spy
If you only knew that I'm on the other side
And I'm ready when you come home from drinking on the weekend
Headboard knocking and the bed start squeaking
Are you all alone or you hanging out with him
Cause I know it's not me yeah, but I can still pretend

[Chorus:]
Sing like a choir
Waves of desire
Try and stay quiet
But I can hear you coming
It's a sound I can savor
Walls thin as paper
Try and stay quiet
But I can hear you coming

[Verse 2:]
On a cold night she makes a warm bed
She's out of sight, yeah rocking like an old vet
She turns the light down, candelabra
She makes it sound so sweet, Frank Sinatra
Yeah, I'm talking Marvin Gaye, I'm talking Al Green
I'm talking champagne, yeah she wants to set a scene
Yeah she was a wild one, she got a wild side
She drinks at Woodstock body painted tie-dye
Butterfly tattoo right above a belt line
Spirit so free yeah pocket full of sunshine
She's all alone yeah, but she ain't lonely
I can hear you coming you can try but you can't hide from me

[Chorus:]
Sing like a choir
Waves of desire
Try and stay quiet
But I can hear you coming
It's a sound I can savor
Walls thin as paper
Try and stay quiet
But I can hear you coming

I said sing like a choir
Waves of desire
Try and stay quiet
But I can hear you coming

Sing like a choir
Waves of desire
Sing like a choir
You try and stay quiet
But I can hear you coming

[Chorus:]
Sing like a choir
Waves of desire
Try and stay quiet
But I can hear you coming
It's a sound I can savor
Walls thin as paper
Try and stay quiet
But I can hear you coming
