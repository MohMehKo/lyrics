This is for my people out there feeling like they're black sheep
Running from the wolves that are nipping at your back feet
Leather jacket, pocket knives
Fencing in the backstreets
Burst into flames like a match to a gas leak
Only thing that kept me back in school was art class
Had a friend with the black flag armband
He said, "it's cool if they all don't understand you
Just be yourself, you know what you're here to do."
There's the haters, there's the bullies, there's the know-it-alls
But they just hate the faults, so they just hate us all
It's irrelevant
If they feel big and tall cause we're just tiny ants out in space on a giant ball

Hate on 'em, wait on
Go throw some shade on 'em
Hate on 'em, wait on
Go throw some shade on 'em

Wanna call me weak cause you think you're strong
Does it make you feel good?
Wanna shut me up cause you think I'm wrong
Does it make you feel good?
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
It doesn't make you right
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
It doesn't make you right
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh

Sometimes I wonder why, I can't understand
My head keeps running like a river over troubled sand
And I'm just thinking of these reasons you would do me wrong
I can't think of one; I guess we all got our opinions
And I'm just out here trying to be good, do right
Trying to do things with my life
You just love causing a strike
Keep my eyes closed and my head down
Pass straight, my mind clear
My energy stays vibrant because I'm vibing on that raw shit, yeah
And fuck that bullshit holding me down
Only way outta here is up
Y'all too busy sticking around for me

Hate on 'em, wait on
Go throw some shade on 'em
Hate on 'em, wait on
Go throw some shade on 'em

Wanna call me weak cause you think you're strong
Does it make you feel good?
Wanna shut me up cause you think I'm wrong
Does it make you feel good?
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
It doesn't make you right
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
No, it doesn't make you right
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh

Wanna call me weak cause you think you're strong
Does it make you feel good?
Wanna shut me up cause you think I'm wrong
Does it make you feel good?
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
It doesn't make you right
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Gonna get loud cause we don't agree
Does it make you feel good?
Gonna go to war cause you don't know peace
Does it make you feel good?
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
It doesn't make you right
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
No, it doesn't make you right
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh

Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
It doesn't make you right
Ooh ooh, yeah, ooh ooh
It doesn't make you right
Ooh ooh, yeah, ooh ooh
Do you ever really try?
See it from the other side?
Yeah, it doesn't make you right
It doesn't make you right
Now you really really wanna
Now you really really wanna
Yeah you really really wanted to, but you never even tried
