Tad of a minor threat
Born out of a sun set
Been holdin the mic for many years
And still dont have any guns yet
Any one havin fun yet
My heart beats like a drum set
Take a look up in the sky and feel the heat
Thats were I'm from yes
Take a look around when we startin the sound
Were like a public toilet seat
Man you dont want to sit down
And if you come to be yourself original then let it shine
And if your friends are friends of love then all your
Friends are friends of mine.

[CHORUS]
If you come to be yourself original then let it shine
And if your friends are friends of love then all your
Friends are friends of mine
If you come to be yourself original then let it shine
If your friends are friends of love then were all friends
Let it shine
Let it shine
Let it shine
Why dont you let yourself
When you need yourself
Why dont you let yourself shine

Original we can flow, test the waters deep below
Temperature set to explode, never stoppin till its
Gold, through the fire through the cold, over mountains
Down the road, cities come and cities go, movin individuals.
So if you seen us then you know we aint trying to
Be no one, we just dirty headed kids from the city of
The sun, and I wish that we could stay but its time
For us to shine if your friends are friends with love
Then your friends are friends of mine.

[CHORUS]

Why dont you let yourself
Why dont you let yourself shine

[CHORUS]
