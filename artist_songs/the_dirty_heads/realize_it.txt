Feeling South but you're warm up in your North Face
It's all perspective: you the jockey of the horserace
Think you got it bad while someone living off of your waste
Waiting like a music lover looking for that chord change
Game of life, this no fucking board game
We put in work and paid our dues before the tours bang
Back when we were barely eating, sleeping on the floor stained
Now we joining people all together like we ordained

Everybody's gotta make mistakes
Everybody's gotta feel heartache
Everybody's gotta love someone

Someone to realize it
To realize it
To realize it
To realize it, yeah

These psychedelic undertones, they circulate my mindframe
Trouble comes my way, but I just faze it out like day dreams
Born in the '80s, but my heart lives in the '60s in a meadow full of daisies, running naked with some gypsies, man
Half empty glasses overflow with expectations
I take opportunities and make them revelations
We all got the same 24, man life's an audible
Call ya own plays, or you'll get played up like some pocket pool

Everybody's gotta make mistakes
Everybody's gotta feel heartache
Everybody's gotta love someone

Someone to realize it
To realize it
To realize it
To realize it, yeah

Spaced out and you're feeling high, but your head's down waiting
Laced out in a golden jewels, but you miss that craving
Photo on that brain's the truth outta what you've been faking
Now you're looking up at the skies saying, "someone, save me."

Someone to realize it
To realize it
To realize it
To realize it, yeah
Someone to realize it
To realize it
To realize it
To realize it, yeah
