[Verse 1 - Teeflii:]
I want you wet yeah, your body laying next to me
You was tryna tease me, until I met you, wanna please me
Girl cut your phone off, fuck a text message
You don't wanna be interrupted

[Pre-Chorus - Teeflii:]
Leave the lights on, I'm tryna see this shit
The dark is only gon' fuck my vision

[Chorus - Teeflii:]
So let's start it off right by you filling my cup with some liquor
I'm bout to put it into you, fuckin' with them weak niggas
You gon' forget about everything while I'm undressing you
You do everything I say while I'm undressing you
Girl take it off, girl take it off
Girl take it off, girl take it off

[Verse 2 - Teeflii:]
You'll see you ready
I wanna see you handle it
I done popped a molly, now a nigga mind racing
I know you like it fast, but I'm gon' give it to you slow

[Pre-Chorus - Teeflii:]
Leave the lights on, I'm tryna see this shit
The dark is only gonna fuck my vision

[Chorus - Teeflii]:]
