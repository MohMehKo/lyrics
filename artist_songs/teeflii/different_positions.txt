TeeFlii on this motherfucker

Never had it like this (no never)
I know he never did you like this (no never)
Different positions
Different positions
I'll put you in different positions
Oh, I'll put you in different positions

Showing out tonight
Don't even worry about your nigga
Cause he don't like it when you do freaky shit
He can't even handle your body, body

So drop down and give me fifty, girl, [?] with it [x2]

Never had it like this (no never)
I know he never did you like this (no never)
Different positions
Different positions
I'll put you in different positions
Oh, I'll put you in different positions

These other bitches ain't where you at
Tell them hoes get on your level

Throwing it back, looking back at it
Let me feel all on you
Girl you want this thug love, thug love

So drop down and give me fifty, girl, [?] with it [x2]

Never had it like this (no never)
I know he never did you like this (no never)
Different positions
Different positions
I'll put you in different positions
Oh, I'll put you in different positions

Let me lick you up and down 'til you say
Let me lick you up and down 'til you say

You wanna go another round

Never had it like this (no never)
I know he never did you like this (no never)
Different positions
Different positions
I'll put you in different positions
Oh, I'll put you in different positions
