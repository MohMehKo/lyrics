Any if I had every woman in the world
You'd still be number one
But Lord knows that I'm managing my best to stick it out with you
You only get one chance to love
So you better love right
See, I can't wait for you anymore

It ain't nowhere to pray, nowhere to hide
It ain't no wrong, it ain't no right

Oh, you say it's love over money
But I say it's money over love
Cause you and I acting like we don't give a fuck
You say it's love over money
But I say it's money over love
And you and I seem to have a reason we can't trust

You say you really don't give a fuck, you only want to love me
You want to talk about how you're going to faithful to me
It's tearing you down, it's tearing you up
I know because, because every day you be calling me
You need to give a little or give your all
Cause every single time that you leave
I know that you, that you be coming back

It ain't nowhere to pray, nowhere to hide
It ain't no wrong, it ain't no right

Oh, you say it's love over money
But I say it's money over love
Cause you and I acting like we don't give a fuck
You say it's love over money
But I say it's money over love
And you and I seem to have a reason we can't trust

Every time you get mad, that's when you say it's over
You and I ain't getting uh
You and I ain't getting along
Every time you get mad, that's when you say it's over
I'm not gon' give a fuck how you feel
I'm not gon' give a fuck how you feel

Oh, you say it's love over money
But I say it's money over love
Cause you and I acting like we don't give a fuck
You say it's love over money
But I say it's money over love
And you and I seem to have a reason we can't trust
