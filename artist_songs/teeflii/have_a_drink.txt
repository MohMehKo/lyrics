If you got a drink, or if you got some weed
Drink up, smoke up

Shut it down, take you down, put it down
See I'm a shut it down, take you down, put it down
Yeah, I'm a shut it down, take you down, put it down
Shut it down, take you down, put it down

[Verse 1:]

Bottles of Patron, girl you got me on
Girl don't play around, pop these Molly's with me
You all on this dick tryna fuck with me

Stay ready, you ain't gotta get ready, just

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
I see you Annie, yeah
You've been patiently waiting, yeah

They cock blocking, let them hate then
You can't be on my team if you ain't trying to get it in
Stay with me, I look that pussy eye-to-eye
We gon' fuck all night
Stay ready, you ain't gotta get ready, just
