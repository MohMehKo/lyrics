Do I Have to fight anyone, anyone?
I said don't lie, keep it real
I Said Don't try, What you're waiting for?
Don't make me pull up on your main hoes (It's all over) [x2]
Don't make me pull up where they're guarding money
Money, money, money, money [x2]
Don't make me pull up where they're guarding money

Ain't nothing new a nigga's different
You are traumatised
You think a nigga's stressed
How me and girl can get a dinner special
Cause I'm so motherfucker disrespect
Don't make me hit the club with 50 niggaz
Don't make me leave the club with 50 bitches
I let them talk you while I'm really livin'

Do I Have to fight anyone, anyone?
I said don't lie, keep it real
Don't try, What you're waiting for?
Don't make me pull up on your main hoes (It's all over) [x2]
Don't make me pull up where they're guarding money
Money, money, money, money [x2]
Don't make me pull up where they're guarding money

I know what your girl wants
She doin' and kickin' it like the World Cup
I promise it ain't nothin' sweet here nigga
And shout out to my real streets niggaz
I'm makin' it five
And blowin' it six

Do I Have to fight anyone, anyone?
I said don't lie, keep it real
Don't try, What you're waiting for?
Don't make me pull up on your main hoes (It's all over) [x2]
Don't make me pull up where they're guarding money
Money, money, money, money [x4]

Don't make me pull up where they're guarding tha money
