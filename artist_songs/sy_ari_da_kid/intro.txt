Everything you do
If you think you wanna do what you think I've done
Then do what I've done
And stick with God
Number two fail big
That's right fail big
Today's the beginning of the rest of your life
And it can be it's gonna be very frightening
It's a new world out there
It's a mean world out there
You only live once
So do what you feel passionate about
Passionate about
Take chances professionally
Don't be afraid to fail
Cuz you know the IQ test was 9 dots
And you had to draw 5 lines with a pencil within these 9 dots without lifting the pencil
The only way to do it was to go outside the box
Don't be afraid to go outside the box
Don't be afraid to think outside the box
Don't be afraid to fail big
To dream big
But remember dreams without goals are just dreams (are just dreams [x4])
