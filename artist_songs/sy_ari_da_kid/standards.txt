I bet this meet your standards

Standards
They say make sure you got standards
Cool kid on the campus
Sometimes I don't understand it
But I
I just want you
And I, oh I
Know you want me too, know you want me too

She ain't too fine
Ain't got the body of stallion
But she went college, stay smiling
I'm vibing, she 'bout it
[?]
She don't ever tell a lie
She so beautiful inside
But you niggas steady styling, on her
But if I tell her that she mine
Pull up with her in the ride
Y'all gon' prolly say I'm wilding
I guess she don't meet your

Standards
They say make sure you got standards
Cool kid on the campus
Sometimes I don't understand it
But I
I just want you
And I, oh I
Know you want me too, know you want me too

Say she a bad bitch
She bought the body of a goddess
Now she dancing, she model
Got booking in her bio
She the hottest
All she wanted was the fame
Got treated like a name
Now she acting like a side chick
She don't know real love
Ain't even got none
The moment she empty your wallet
I guess can't meet her

Standards
They say make sure you got standards
Cool kid on the campus
Sometimes I don't understand it
But I
I just want you
And I, oh I
Know you want me too, know you want me too

Standards
Y'all don't meet my standards
Y'all look for the wrong thing in a person I can't stand it
Sometimes we have sit downs just to see where we are standing
Sometimes I make to plant my seed then leave this planet
And I'm the man god damn it
Being real is an advantage
Y'all folk trying to keep up with a lifestyle you can't manage
Brainwashed by the television better hurry up and change channels
Love for anyone, love don't get caught up in them cameras
You ain't got standards
Please raise your standards
Standards
You should make standards
