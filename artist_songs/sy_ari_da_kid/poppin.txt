[Intro:]
What I've have to say today is Sy ari been talking shit to me ok
He tell me that he a greater rapper then me not'an I'm the greatest

[Verse - Sy ari da kid:]
Yeah, If you ain't got no hatters you ain't poppin niqqa
I'm with a white girl like I'm not a niqqa, a lot of niqqas always with alot of niqqas
If ion kill that niqqa then a cop will kill'em
They say you ain't a shooter till you shot a niqqa, girl tell a niqqa she ain't got a niqqa
All they wanna know is when you drop a niqqa, buying one pair of shoes ain't shopping niqqa
We them niqqas had cars since high school, you that niqqa trynna walk through the drive through
You that niqqa playing ball wearing goggles, looking for my rivals waiting on they arrival
Broke ass rappers couldn't even buy vowel, I make movies, you make virals
Say the word she a bird like a owl, do whatever pops say like monel
These rappers still flexing for the models, doin' shows for a section in a bottle
I'm ballin got hoop dreams we treadin', check your news feed
How you from the ghetto and you're room clean
How you a team player and got two teams yeah, I'm Michael Jordan with the hoop ring
A new king doing me that's how I do things
Turnt said "I could've been a hot boy" who are you it doesn't matter the rock voice
Still stone cold stunnin' more hoes frountin', popo coming niqqa don't know nothing
Young niqqa raise hell now we can't fail, 10, 11, 13 man I hate 12
Valentine's day sending niqqas hate mail fuck a album I bet the mixtape sell yeah

[Outro:]
Where just like that, when someone comes up and says something like "I'm a God"
Everybody says who do he think he is I just told you who I thought I was "a God"
I just told you that's who I think I am. Would it been better if I had a song called "I am a niqqa"
Or if I had a song said "I'm a gangster" or if I had a song said "I am a pimp"
All those colors and patinas fit better, on a person like me right?
But to say you are a God, expecially when you got ship over to the country that you in
And you're last name is a slave owners, how could you say that? How could you have that mentality
