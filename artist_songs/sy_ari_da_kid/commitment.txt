[Intro:]
Hello? (Mumbled)
Hey. (Mumbled)
What you wanna talk about? (Mumbled)
I mean Ion think that's not a good idea, you already know my situation

[Verse 1:]
Aye, maybe I'm trippin, maybe I'm afraid of commitment
Maybe I'm afraid of the tought of spending my whole life with the same one women
And everyday something different I can't keep slayin' them bitches and some people say I'm addicted
But If it ain't what it isn't (hey) but anyway it been a minute
So we hang and we kicked it, we maintain at a distance you done change on a niqqa
Don't change on me (aye) I feel like we playing games girl. (Oh nooo)

[Hook:]
I feel like we playing games girl
(Oh nooo) Talk to me
Talk to me just talk to me (aye) used to argue on the strong are you on?
But If I pull up on you the look in your eyes you can't tell me no

[Verse 2:]
Can't save you're ass, don't make a niqqa hate your ass
Got me asking these questions like "how you get bae so fast, can erase you're pass"
Aye I'm a let you meditate on that, now what's your take on that I'm a wait on that aye
Nevermind that's time wasted I'm tired of taking these chances baby you violate that's a violation
(Oh no no)

[Hook:]
I feel like we playing games girl
(Oh nooo) Talk to me
Talk to me just talk to me (aye)
Used to argue on the strong are you on?
But If I pull up on you the look in your eyes you can't tell me no

[Verse 3:]
I feel like you just in you're feelings I feel like I should handle feelings
And baby I'm a make you feel it
A real niqqas gone feel me
You know my woman gon feel this (aye, aye)

[Hook:]
(Oh nooo) Talk to me
Talk to me just talk to me (aye) used to argue on the strong are you on?
But If I pull up on you the look in your eyes you can't tell me no
Talk to me, talk to me just talk to me (aye) used to argue on the strong are you on?
But If I pull up on you the look in your eyes, you can't tell me no

[Outro:]
Just talk, (aye) just talk to me
(Aye) you can't tell me no
