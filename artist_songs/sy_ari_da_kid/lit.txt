[Chorus:]
I'm still totem [?] minding my business
Still slumming, fucking all y'all bitches
And I ain't going nowhere without my nigga (without my nigga)
And all my nigga ride, we gonna handle my business

And we don't give a fuck cause we stupid lit
Fuck that nigga, take his bitch
Shoot him up, sell a brick
Pop a bottle, smoke a zip
We don't give a fuck cause we stupid lit
Me coke, stupid rich
I went broke, now we rich
Pop a bottle, smoke a zip
We don't give a fuck cause we stupid lit

[Verse 1:]
Money on my mind, tool up on my waist
Disrespect the fam, shoot him in his face
I just had a dream, my whole crew was getting face
Kilo like a castle, pooling like a lake
I don't get depression, I might switch directions
Bottles in the section, models giving blessings
Slumming life I'm living, fucking niggas' bitches
Just don't violate my niggas, and don't be taking pictures

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
All my bitches turnt, all my niggas lit
I'm an MC with a hammer
Too legit to quit
Fuck a nine to five
I work six to six
[?] got no money (bitches got broke)
Let me reminisce
Fucking right, [?] where we from ain't nothing nice
Now we lit up every fucking night (turnt)
Disrespect the niggas, that's my fucking vice
In the kitchen like a butter knife (whip)
Bitches geeking off a hundred lights
Single nigga, I don't want a wife
What more can I say, I'm loving life
Roll the fucking dice, slum

[Chorus]

[Outro:]
We don't give a fuck cause we stupid lit [x3]
Say we don't give a fuck cause we stupid lit
We don't give a fuck cause we stupid lit
Say we don't give a fuck cause we stupid lit
