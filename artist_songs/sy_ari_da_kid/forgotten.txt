Hey
You can forgive but you can't forget
But you can't forget
Every joy you bring

It seems like she forgotten
Them dark days no Gotham
I'm from where the plot thickens
In the big host plotting
Looking for info to gossip
The stones niggas that's this close to profit
Pimps hoes and scholars that lift clothes for dollars
Nit foes decided
They misguided
While other chicks go to college
They strive for money
Cuz nigga time is money
All disguised as lovely
But inside is suddenly
The pride come before the fall
But then we all stand tall
So what's wrong
Before you walk you crawl
First you gain everything then you lost it all
Now the cards involved
And you car getting auctioned off
Excuses like you had an abusive life
But if you ain't the abusive type
Shorty tell me how that proves you right
Only one life to live and you could lose tonight
It seems like you've forgotten yeah
It seems like you've forgotten

Hey
You can forgive but you can't forget
But you can't forget
Every joy you bring

It seems like he's forgotten
In the streets like possums
I'm from where the young die
And the police watch the wire
Pops is missing all locked in prison
You posted on the block with niggas with rocks and pistols
Then put it all on a gram
Cropped the images
Stop the insolence
Wondering why the cops is killing us
Damn that's no excuse for a hate crime
It takes time to hear the truth through the grapevine
And great minds think alike
Lot of idiots clash
Where the broke niggas rob in the city of cash
For them unmade dollars
You'd rather be in the grave before you slave for days to pay homage
Stunting on your page for days to raise comments
Raved at the minimum wage at late hours
Ashamed of your friends who engage like big cowards
The world we made ours
But it seems you've forgotten
But it seems you've forgotten

Hey
You can forgive but you can't forget
But you can't forget
Every joy you bring

It seems I've forgotten
No amnesia
So damn eager even
Both hands bleeding
No man can grow land thinking no man needs them
One hand wash the other
Both hands clean
Gotta hustle to shine
No complaints
Fuck it I'm fine the sales made the customers smile
I lost track of all my hip hop shit
But in my heart is where hip hop lives
They say I'm no longer a hip hop kid
But who are they to say what hip hop is
I was dead broke waiting for a break to come
I can't become that one nigga that ain't become who he should have been
Fuck all the wouldas and could have beens
Them hard times when niggas fold I wouldn't bend
Spoiled rotten
Tried to put the pat down had to pick it back up again
It seems I've forgotten
You can forgive but you can't forget
But you can't forget
