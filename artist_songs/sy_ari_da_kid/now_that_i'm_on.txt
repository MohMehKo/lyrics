[Intro:]
Now That I'm On [x3]

Fuck free, do business playin for the fee
Eatin breakfeast at the club, like where's Angela Yee
Don't Envy, life's a piano, try not to damage the keys
You'll vanish with greed, before you've planted the seed
You had decided to gamble like niggas that move to Nevada,
And you and your partners maneuver for dollas but who was your partners cause you wasn't honest when you was in college,
You flew to Bahamas like you was Obama but leave it behind you Hakuna Matada,
I'm blowin like niggas that's cool with Osama (Pause)

[Hook:]
Now that I'm on, these bitches love me
These niggas hate me, back on my g shit
Now that I'm on, these hoes wana fuck me
The streets going crazy, them boys wana sneak diss
Now that I'm on
Yeah Yeah Yeah
Now that I'm on
Now that I'm on

[Verse 1 - Future:]
Back in the Louis store, back in the Gucci store
Back in my Crystal Louis Vuitton, yeah, where it started ho
Spikes on spikes on spikes, ice on ice on ice
Got bitch on bitch on bitch (where they at),
They foreign and they right
Now that I'm on, 5 different phones
Got 3 different spots, and ain't never home
I change the stone in my watch, I got yo bitch on lock,
She in love with Future, she team pluto Hah!

[Verse 2 - Slim Dunkin:]

Shoot, drop, next sunday, got em last week
Ion say it's my car, I let the tag speak
Fuckin on rooftops, butt make the coupe drop
Bad boy pull up, loud nigga, who saw
You came in a groupie gettin it, let's illuminate it
Want this Breitling on my wrist, you gotta amputate it

[Verse 3 - K Camp:]
Them lame ass niggas still hate, that that shit I don't like
Could spot a snake from a distance, don't need to look in your eyes to know you ain't right
Everyday I wake up in the morning, I'm just thankful for the day
Take some weed and smoke a blunt, they same I'm throwed like a bouquet
None of that bullshit don't excite me, boy I had to make a way
Can't help these bitches, love my presence, she gon get unwrapped today
I could tell the way a hater look at me, his face tell me I'm on
At first that ho ain't get no play, and now she blowin up my phone

[Verse 4 - Riff Raff:]
Marcus Vasell, 80 for a see through visor
40 bricks in Michelin Tires, curb and fries, tied buys
Neon violet, auto pilot
Equalizer, fall like spider
Ruby flow, that Aston Martin
Bre-break it down for basic minds
Candy brown, the inside drowned it
Ice cream seats, with cocaine mounts
Forgot to pay the bail bonds, rap game, Barry Bonds
Bobby Bonilla, in the keywee 2 seater
70 million, act like they know me
200 thousand but still they owe me

[Outro - Future:]
I came from the bottom, from a place where the cops are the robbers
It's mo money, mo problems
We don't give a fuck, another day another dollar
Now that I'm on
Now that I'm on
