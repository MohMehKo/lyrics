[Pre-Hook - Sy Ari Da Kid:]
Word around town nigga, we a problem
I know niggas trappin', I know niggas robbin'
Go back to the block, all my niggas ridin'
And it's all good cause they know I got it

[Hook x2 - Sy Ari Da Kid & Slim Dunkin:]
They say we them niggas
I'm like we them niggas
They say we them niggas
I know we them niggas

[Verse 1 - Sy Ari Da Kid:]
Kid still G-ing, ridin' with your BM
Call that bitch on twitter got a number through the DM
She black but look Korean
Need a whip that's European
My cream that bitch from right here
You don't need to put the key in
Nigga it's AM no PM
Got so many niggas in the pen wanna free 'em
Nigga who say we was beefin', if we was you wouldn't be breathin'
I'm workin' through the week days, grindin' on the week-end
See I don't know Drake but I get hoes like the Weeknd

[Verse 2 - Slim Dunkin:]
Aiyo I'm ridin' in my old school (SQUAD!)
Come out in your new shit

Yeah I'm on that coupe shit (OKAY!)
Cranberry errythang, allergic to that blue shit (SOO-WOO!)
We them, that WOO WOO Pyru shit (TURN UP!)
Call me "Mr-say-I-won't"
Do the shit the way I want
Rock my flag anywhere
Nigga name a day I don't
And I ain't playin' no games, water boy
Strapped like Woody, I'm Andy I got all the toys (DUNK!)

Welcome to Jurassik Park the land of the lost
Don't make me turn up nigga

[Verse 5 - Sean Teezy:]
Precision is key, no sticks in the tree
Get wrong with the team, restriction and fees
I'm up to sumthin' mine just tippin' for free
Touch down, foul, turn around 360 degrees
I do this with ease, fuck it, I do as I please
Stay true to my C
Bitches take 2 and I leave
Ain't shit to a nigga can't break me
I make money, money don't make me
Crazy what type of nigga you take me for?
You bitch chose up, why you hate me for?

[Verse 6 - Cap-1:]
Say that we them niggas, ain't no mystery (HUH?)
Stupid in the kitchen, not know chemistry (AND WHAT?)
TRU Religion pants, belt Louis V. (LOUIS V.)
I pull 'em by the 2's, her, you and me
Turn up with it, tell the motherfuckers they don't keep it in my city
Bein' here gettin' it
Nigga got drink, got kush, got soft, got pills, got magic
Rock star status, bitch I count it
Pockets full of hunnid all I do is gettin' money
Fuck bad bitches, party with the O's
Back on the road nigga put into a show let's go
