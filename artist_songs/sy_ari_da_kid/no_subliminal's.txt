[Hook x2 - Sy Ari Da Kid:]
Rap Game Fucked Up, Errybody Beefin
Internet Gangstas, Errybody Tweetin
Breakin All the rules, nigga errybody cheatin
See he campaign, nigga, errybody eating

[Verse 1 - Sy Ari Da Kid:]
Real boss nigga, you don't even wanna touch me
Two dyke hoes barely even wanna fuck me
Throw that old shit out the roof, this a new kid
If I ain't the best in Atlanta nigga who is
Bet the root of evil that I ain't brink hell
Ask around the northside bitch my name ring bells
Yea bitch I think I'm Konan
You better get yo man
Like look mam wale a finger when he got no hands
Say it's cool, I run with winners, and they hate to loose
I hustle niggas like uncle Phil when he's playing pool
And you can get, we can go all day
Cause the flow silky smooth like the zohan phrase

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Sy Ari Da Kid:]
Look God damnit you a turkey, and you lien
Plus you got bad knees, Andrew Bynum
Frontin-Ass rappers, these real niggas hate ya
The only Maybach you know about is the end of April
Sucka Ass you done let ya main bitch degrade ya
Plus you got the sour face, like you bit a grapefruit
Tee and L's steady passin the weed
Ricky like a mouse headed to the trap for the cheese
Faggot Ass pricks, never getting daps from a G
Type a niggas putting lotion on the back of ya knees
Still cruising down the runway
You don't want the gunplay
Kid 'll shut um down like Chik-Fil-A on a Sunday

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Slim Dunkin:]
Trap game fucked up, duckin the red dog
A nigga life fast, call me Dunkin the Hedgehog
Standin on the ball, with, with, with, them steel tuckers
Whole squad fucked his bitch and he still cuffed her
Two beans, lean, and the ros√©
All three, might need to check your pulse rate
No co-pay, finna ball give a damn what the coach say
I'm from the hood tell your kids don't look up to me
I'm the bad guy, momma told you not to fuck with me

[Hook]
