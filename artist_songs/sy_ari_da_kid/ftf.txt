[Verse 1 - Sy Ari da Kid:]
Have you ever made love? (hey...)
I showed you what fake was (Ayy)
We fight just to make up and you done need no make up

[Hook:]
You fine girl you fine girl... We Fight then Fuck
See I'd give up but I'm in love
We shouldn't fight this much, girl
I misjudged you... Fight then fuck

[Verse 2 - Sy Ari da Kid:]
You say you don't wanna fight
Seem like you looking for that (ayy)
You look so good when you mad
You look so good when you not (wait)
I put that good on your ass then put my foot on the dash (SCRRRR)
I hit that thing from behind, watch how you look from the back (BANG)
I got you fed up today
These ain't your regular ways
I got you talking that shit
You saying things that you never would say
I'm like "no wonder you whining" cus you getting better with age
You so ahead of the game and I never said I would change
But girl...

[Hook:]
Have you ever made love? (hey...)

[Verse 3 - Sy Ari da Kid:]
Let's fight for something
Cause you know every time we fight we fucking
And you know you a freak girl, type disgusting
And you know I don't call you the wife for nothing
Head so good, caught a slight concussion
My niggas even said you a dime a dozen
Your friends stay hating, I don't like them, fuck em
We can talk about it later that's a light discussion
Ahhh yeah baby [x3]

We fight then fuck
We shouldn't fight this much
Girl I misjudged you
