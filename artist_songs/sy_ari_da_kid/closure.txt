We need closure
I think we need closure
You say it's over but you can't let me go
I hate to tell you I told you so
Cause you was lost girl
And you just wanna find love
But do it all girl
I'm gon always blame us

Know its been a minute but
I've been on my grind
You've been on my mind
Hope you ain't in a rush
Know about your pride
Put it to the side
I've been chilling in the cut
Look me in the eye
I ain't gonna lie
I see other women but
They ain't nothing like you
I swear
I ain't gon lie no more
Don't wanna cry no more
We ain't gotta try no more

We need closure
I think we need closure
You say it's over but you can't let me go
I hate to tell you I told you so
Cause you was lost girl
And you just wanna find love
But do it all girl
I'm gon always blame us

[Tink:]
Tryna end this chapter
Pussy all you was after
Call then I hang up
I don't wanna fuss but I want attention
And it cant be from another guy
Said that I was done
Never meant it once
Can't be with another guy
Can't be on the other side
I love you but I don't wanna cuff you
Its not personal
I'm just used to you
And you not the same
Why this pain feel so good
Tell me to cut you off it I could

We need closure
I think we need closure
You said its over but you can't let me go
I hate to tell you I told you so
Cuz you was lost girl
You just wanna find love
But do it all girl
I'm gon always blame us
