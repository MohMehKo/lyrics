[Intro]

[Chorus:]
Sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, not all the time, sometimes, yeah

[Verse 1 - Sy Ari Da Kid:]
Sometimes I be doing overtime
Sometimes I look up at the world, it's like I know it's mine
Them good ole days and making them bad decisions
Because learning from them would only equal the lavish living
Sometimes I be hanging out with the white women, let them say "nigga" and tell my homies they're light skinned
We might bleed the same, but the price different
You'll never catch me celebrating in a life ending
Now I influence niggas that used to influence me
You and these acquisitions, it was never you and me
Sometime I tip the waitress more than her gratuity
Don't worry about what I'm doing, just know I'm doing me
Sometimes used to be one time, now every time it feels like crunch time

[Hook:]
Sometimes I feel I want it all, and more
Sometimes I feel like going off (and go off)

[Chorus:]
Sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, not all the time, sometimes, yeah

[Verse 2 - Sy Ari Da Kid:]
Sometimes I just wanna get away
But it's all for the love, for the love, for the love, it's always love
That's what these niggas say
That's what the hoes think (hey)
They ain't got no ring
Sometimes I be reminiscing 'bout them old days
Since I was a Little Rascal, nigga otay
And I'm so straight
[?]
Fuck a day one, what about day two
They gon' try to say they made you
But that's just something that you can't prove
Sometimes I notice that I hate rules
Don't let them tell you what you can't do (true)

[Hook:]
Sometimes I feel I want it all, and more
Sometimes I feel like going off (and go off)

[Chorus:]
Sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, not all the time, sometimes, yeah

[Coda:]
One time, two times
Baby one time, two times
One time, two times
Baby one time, two times
One time, two times
Baby one time, two times
