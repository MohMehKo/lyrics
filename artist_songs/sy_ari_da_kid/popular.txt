[Hook x2 - Sy Ari Da Kid:]
I'm so, I'm so popular
I'm so popular [x2]
I am
I'm so popular [x2]
All your bitches know me [x2]
Most these niggas hating
Well at least they know me

[Verse 1 - Sy Ari Da Kid:]
I'm so popular, I am
I think I concur, I do
So cold on a bitch
I'm sure I confer
I might cop a vert
Tryna pull up in the drop then swerve
Whole team eating good
And we got dessert
Hear that money calling (hello)
That's that guap alert
Why you hating on me?
Did what I deserve
I might take your hoe
Know she got that work
That's that sloppy seconds
I heard she hit
Don't get why I convert

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2 - K. Camp:]
I'm so popular I could've hit my teacher
Could've hit that hoe
Put you up again young nigga let me teach you
I was on the court and you was in the bleachers
Boy don't look like that, you know I charge for features
You know me, young KC, in this bitch with Sy Ari
Make that call no referee
Saw him in the bank and the rest homie
Baby girl you can rest on me
Nigga don't trip she'll be home by 3
Flip her like a spatula I swear my niggas after her

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3 - Sy Ari Da Kid:]
Got these niggas lurking
Got these bitches touching
Check my Instagram, I'm a trending topic
Make a quick deposit
Get your team and then divide it
R.I.P. to Nando, he had them strippers popping
Broke nigga sit silent
It ain't tripping if you got it
Bitches give me knowledge
Feeling like I finished college
And I gotta do it big
They gon miss the wallets
No American express
Boy what's in your wallet

[Hook x2]
