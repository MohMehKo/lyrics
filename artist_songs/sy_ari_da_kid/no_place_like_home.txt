If a bird leave's its cage, let it fly, let it fly, away (hey)
And you can't hide a pain but love is pain
Pain is love insane

And people say that love ain't real anymore
And if it isn't don't live here anymore
Cuz there's no place like home
Its nice alone and those summer days
Just feels so cold you know
But there's no place like home
Feel like a part of me is lost
I can't believe your gone
There's no place like home

Come on your home ain't got no address
And this house just ain't no home
Without your touch got me sleeping
On the wrong side of the mattress
And it's all over for us

And people say that love ain't real anymore
And if it isn't don't live here anymore
Cuz there's no place like home
It's nice alone and those summer days
Just feels so cold you know
But there's no place like home
Feel like a part of me is lost
I can't believe your gone there's no place like home

Ohh yeah, ain't nothing wrong with being lost
Instead that means that you in a new place after all
And I say, I say ain't nothing wrong with being lost
Instead that means that you in a new place after all
So don't you come back home
