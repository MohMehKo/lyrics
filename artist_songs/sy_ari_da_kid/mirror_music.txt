[Intro:]
I only trust two niggas, and I'm not one of 'em
I only trust two niggas, and I'm not one of 'em
Yeah

[Verse 1:]
Yeah, they say we are kings, but that ain't the truth
A throne doesn't fit two, it ain't coupe
Take a look at the ring of fire, we made it through
That feeling when you replace something that's irreplaceable
Everybody doubted us, friendly competition
I began a competition, just to end the competition
While I pen this compostions, without using a pen
I condraticted what I said before I entered my perdition
This is my prediction, is shit that I was kickin'
I was different, I was itchin', just figure out the difference
Still get a slight irritation whenever niggas call me
Still a one man army, with a army, still copy, still made it my own
And I still got Dunks number saved in my phone
Some times I call, hopin' that he'll answer
Got me goin' bald, Jordan think I had cancer
Battle like the KKK and the Black Panthers
Up in nine, fuckin' on a job, bad Santa
A waste like a good lens on a bad camera
Prayin' that a buck is near, nigga that's Tampa
Shit, how you gon' win when, you ain't right within'
How you gon' win when, you ain't fight 'till end
That's right, you gon' lose, cause you ain't never lose it
Locate the point, then prove it, facts

[Interlude:]
I only trust two niggas, and I'm not one of 'em
I only trust two niggas, and I'm not one of 'em nigga
Yeah, I know it's crazy

[Verse 2:]
Me and Boo way out in Cali, he gave me my respect
Akon up at the Waffle House told me I was next
Noticed that my feet, always movein' with the ground
I agree to disagree, cause I knew that I was now
Niggas out lookin' like new cars with old engines
Don't mention I'm, lookin' for Nicole Kidman
All I ever do is talk, niggas don't listen
Is crazy close of both eyes give me more vision
How you gon' diss gold diggers, we all gold diggin'
Them broke niggas, bragging 'bout four figures
That ain't no money to a real go getter
I ride like 'em rubber tires on a four wheeler
You ain't get the bigger picture, should have posed, nigga
Just like the post nigga, comment if you wanna, nigga I ain't gonna delete it
Fuck talkin' when you workin' real niggas gon' see it
We connect them dots and crossed meetings
Still trynna finish the puzzle with lost pieces
Lord Jesus, taught me to walk even
When I felt I wouldn't make it, nights when I fought demons
Amen

[Outro:]
I only trust two niggas, and I'm not one of 'em nigga
I only trust two niggas, and I'm not one of 'em yeah
[?] music, that shit sound crazy right, that shit crazy
