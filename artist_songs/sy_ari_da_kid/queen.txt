Girl open your eyes
Don't let 'em lies no
Wipe away them tears girl
Ain't got to cry
Cause you know you a queen
You know you a queen
And I ain't trying to be a hater
All my real niggas they know what I mean

Girl don't do no talking, right now you should listen
Let me guess he claimed he the realest nigga living
I be he said he different
And he don't know these women
I never been a pimp, but I'm gon' keep it pimping
Seem like anytime he home, you run to the kitchen
But anytime you need him that when he just come up missing
I feel I got to let you know my partners say I'm tripping
Cause I love all my queens but I don't love these bitches

Why you won't let him go
You know he wrong for you
That's why this song's for you
You ain't bitch, you ain't no hoe
You ain't no thot and that's for sure

Girl open your eyes
Don't let 'em lies no
Wipe away them tears girl
Ain't got to cry
Cause you know you a queen
You know you a queen
And I ain't trying to be a hater
All my real niggas they know what I mean

You said he spent a couple bands on you, alright
But then he put his hands on you
That shit gangster and he know it
His pride won't let him show it
Ain't the one to save these hoes
Cause girl I ain't heroic
But I will put you on game
And let you make the decision
You know that's a crime
Girl you finna catch a sentence
And I know I'm a G don't put them lames in my division
Cause I love all my queens and I don't love these bitches

Why you won't let him go
You know he wrong for you
That's why this song's for you
You ain't bitch, you ain't no hoe
You ain't no thot and that's for sure

Girl open your eyes
Don't let 'em lies no
Wipe away them tears girl
Ain't got to cry
Cause you know you a queen
You know you a queen
And I ain't trying to be a hater
All my real niggas they know what I mean
Cause you know you a queen
You know you a queen
