Ain't got a lot of words
Ain't got a lot of hurt, no more
Phone on do not disturb
Baby you ain't got to curve
Ain't gon' worthy
I don't deserve you but you deserve me
You heard me I said you heard me
I know you heard me
Tell me what's up
Tell your man to shut the fuck up
Cause he don't know about love
You let every body doubt us
Including you, ya including you
How a one on one turn to two on two
I know me but baby who are you
You don't know what these lame niggas could do to you
They could ruin you
I was doing me but you was doing you
So let's politic as usual
Cause girl you know its politics as usual
I got some secrets only you would
I've been some places me and you should go
Sometimes I feel like I'm gon' lose control
This intermission got me moving slow
So wait for me
Wait for me
Wait for me
