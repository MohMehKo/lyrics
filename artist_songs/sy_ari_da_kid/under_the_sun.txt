[Hook - Sy Ary Da Kid:]
Niggas wanna hate when you win
But they love when you stuck in the hood (Wooh)
Talk shit behind my back when a nigga pull up so good
I can't let these fuck niggas try me, I wish a nigga would
Say she gon'leave me to find another nigga but I know she won't do it
Tell me sum that I don't know
I already knew that
Tell me sum that I don't know
Show me sum that I ain't seen before
Think I know everything
Tell me sum that I don't know

[Verse 1 - Sy Ary Da Kid:]
Yea, I don't give a damn what a bitch talking about
Bring another bitch in while I kick one out
Got an Iphone 4 but she bad nigga probly won't get the fire till the six come out
I don't know why I'm chilling in the cup with these niggas
They ain't holdin' a nigga down, man what's up with these niggas
I don't like their shit on a nice day
Feeling white racist I don't fuck with these niggas
I think I finna ball like "?"
Boo said I hit em with the new flow
And If they gon' hate just let em gon' hate
And pull up to the bank in a two doooooor
These niggas still where the fools go
Turn up on a price, that's too low
"Side" do it big like Saumo
Finna pop like tags on my new clothes
Packaging moves, boy you was captain at school
What the fuck happened to you
I'm back in your view
Ballin' and actin' a fool
I should be on Shaqtin a fool
That I can prove
How the waist matching my shoes
Clean, I know that you lost
You throwing that salt
Don't put nun' of that in my foul
[?] And I'm cool

[Verse 2 - Sy Ary Da Kid:]
Ain't no one under the sun
Fool me nigga? I don't think so
Look me in the eye, Don't blink ho
You a old ass nigga playing bingo
Young nigga trynna go further like a minko
Why you gotta sound so clich√©
Scratch that nigga no DJ
Most of these hoes selling pussy on ebay
I ain't got time for y'all niggas that got time
And y'all just lyin'
You better get yours, cause I'm a get mine
Just open yours eyes, cause we ain't gon' shine forever
But as long as we here say as long as we here then we might as well shine together
Nigga it's now or never

[x2:]
I don't love these bitches
I can't trust these bitches
No, I don't love these hoes
And fuck these niggas
