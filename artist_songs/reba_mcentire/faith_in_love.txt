[Reba:]
We felt this coming on
We've seen it for a while
But there are no regrets between us
We can leave here with a smile
We have to talk about it
What we've always known
The hardest part about today
Is tonight we'll be alone
Alone

[Chorus:]
We were just two hearts
Bound for different roads
Oh why they didn't lead us to forever
We may never know
[Reba:] oh I will carry you with me
[Gary:] I will hold on to our memories
[Reba:] don't let the dreams we didn't find
[Together:] make you feel like giving up
[Reba:] keep holding on and
[Together:] don't lose your faith in love

[Gary:]
Life's gonna move on
And the pages start to turn
We'll be stronger people now
From the lessons that we've learned
This one's gonna hurt
It's a little deeper break
But just know I'm praying for you
As I watch you walk away

[Chorus:]
We were just two hearts
Bound for different road
Why they didn't lead us to forever
We may never know
[Reba:] oh I will carry you with me
[Gary:] I will hold on to our memories
[Reba:] don't let the dreams we didn't find
[Together:] make you feel like giving up
[Gary:] keep holding on and
[Together:] don't lose your faith
[Gary:]in love

[Reba:] it can hold you, it can save you
[Gary:] from anything or anyone
[Reba:] heaven knows who's waiting for you
[Gary:] when two hearts come undone

[Bridge:]
[Reba:] oh I will carry you with me
[Gary:] I will hold on to our memories
[Together:] don't let the dreams we didn't find
Make you feel like giving up
[Gary:] keep holding on and
Don't lose your faith
[Reba:] oh never ever lose your faith

[Together:] in love

[Reba:] don't ever lose your faith
