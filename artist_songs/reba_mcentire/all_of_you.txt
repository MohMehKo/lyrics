I think about holding you and kissing you,
Wanting you and missing you....

Clock is tickin and the wind is howlin,
And I'm just starin at the candle burnin.
Bottle of red that we never opened,
Your voice in my head, tossin and turnin.
The radio is playing our song,
I can't sing along, can't even listen.
I dial your number but I don't let it ring....

I think about, 
Holding you and kissing you,
Wanting you and missing you,
Building up and breaking down walls.
I dream about,
Finding you and keeping you,
Loving you and living you,
I'm telling you, I want it all,
All of you....

I can't let go and I keep can't holding on to nothing,
But i just keep trying,
To tell myself there's a damn good reason,  
But it's not enough,
To keep me from crying.
I've memorized every look, every touch,
Every time you told me our hearts weren't lie-ing.
I'm wondering now, do you even know....

I think about,
Holding you and kissing you,
Wanting you and missing you,
Building up and breaking down walls.
I dream about,
Finding you and keeping you,
Loving you and living you,
I'm telling you, I want it all....

I can't break free of you,
I don't know how.
Oh I'm not about,
To let go of you,
I love you,
I need you now....

I think about,
Holding you and kissing you,
Wanting you and missing you,
Building up and breaking down walls.
I dream about,
Finding you and keeping you,
Loving you and living you,
I'm telling you, I want it all....
All of you....

All of you.......
