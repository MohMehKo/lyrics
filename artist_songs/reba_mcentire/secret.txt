She's quiet this morning she can't say why
Sends her husband off to work with a kiss goodbye
Unlocks that old diary turns to the third of May
Adds another tear to the page
And it's lonely being the only one who knows the truth

She has a secret that she can never tell
One wrong decision still puts her heart through hell
Does he miss her does he forgive her
The love that they shared will always be a secret

Only she knows she still loves him and she hates the choice she made
Wishes she could find him tell him why she walked away
Every day gets harder livin' with herself
But she knew he's be better of raised by someone else
God, it's lonely being the only one who knows the truth

She has a secret that she can never tell
One wrong decision still puts her heart through hell
Does he miss her does he forgive her
The love that they shared will always be a secret

She unlocks that old diary turns to the third of May
Adds another tear to the page
