I know he was made just for me
Two hearts that fit perfectly
He gives me love-more then enough

But way before he came along
There was somebody else making me strong
There is no doubt
I'd be nothing without

God and my girlfriends
They're always there when
I'm feeling down, always around, lifting me up
I love how they know me, forgive me, and show me
Again and again, I can depend
On God on and my girlfriends

They were there when I walked down the aisle
And again when my first baby smiled
Good times and bad, happy or sad
What would I do if I didn't have

God and my girlfriends
They're always there when
I'm feeling down, always around, lifting me up
I love how they know me, forgive me, and show me
Again and again, I can depend
On God on and my girlfriends

Anywhere, anytime of the day
Just a prayer or a phone call away

God and my girlfriends

They're always there when
I'm feeling down, always around, lifting me up
I love how they know me, forgive me, and show me
Again and again, I can depend
On God on and my girlfriends
