How Blue (how Blue) can you make me
How long till heal
How Can I go on loving you when you're gone
How Blue (How Blue) can I feel

Oh honey why did you leave me
Ain't you got a heart left in your chest
I swear to that I'm dyin'
'Cause my mind won't let my body rest

How Blue (How Blue) can you make me
How long till I heal
How can I go on loving you when you're gone
How Blue (How Blue) can I feel

If I sink any lower I'll go under
If I cry anmore I'l go blind
No there ain't no relief for this missing you grief
How long can you torture my mind

How Blue (How Blue) can you make me
How long till heal
How can I go on loving you when you're gone
How Blue (How Blue) can I feel
How can I go on loving you when you're gone
How Blue (How Blue) can I feel
