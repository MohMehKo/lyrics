Mama moved out
Daddy sold the house
They split up the money
And went on their way

And all the king's horses
and all the kings men
Couldn't put mama and daddy back together again

Starting over again
Where should they begin
'Cause they've never been out on their own
Starting over again
Where do you begin
When your dreams are all shattered
and the kids are all grown
And the whole word cries

He got an apartment
She moved in with her sisters
He's schemin' big deals with one of his friends
While she sits at home
Sortin' out pieces
Of left over memories from thirty odd years

Starting over again
Where do you begin
When you've never been out on your own
Starting over again
Never any end

What will the neighbors say
They're talkin' talk it's small town news
They're facing fifty years old wrecking up a happy home
And this far down the road
You find yourself alone
Two fools
Starting over again
Where do you begin
When you've never been out on your own
Starting over again
Never any end
When your dreams are all shattered
And the kids are all grown
And the whole world cries

And all the kings horses
And all the kings men
Couldn't put mama and daddy back together again
