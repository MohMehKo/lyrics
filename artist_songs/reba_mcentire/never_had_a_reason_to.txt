All the girls I grew I up with
Got a husband house and kids
That's what everybody did after school
If I'd a had a steady boyfriend
I mighta stuck around like them but
Back then I never had a reason to

L.A.'s like another planet
Had to live there to understand it
I thought when I first landed California's cool
Till I saw good girls gettin' outa control,
Endin' up sellin' their souls
Oh no I never had a reason to

Never had a reason to stay
To not walk away
Nobody's heart was gonna break over me
Never had somethin' worth keepin'
Or somebody I needed
Like I'm needin' you
Baby don't you see it's true
I never had a reason to believe in love

To some love comes as a vision
To some it's a sweet baptism
Me and love had a head-on collision
When I ran into you
Got some feelings I'm figurin' out
No I don't know exactly how
Baby till now I never had a reason to

Never had a reason to stay
To not walk away
Nobody's heart was gonna break over me
Never had somethin' worth keepin'
Or somebody I needed
Like I'm needin' you
Baby don't you see it's true
I never had a reason to believe in love
