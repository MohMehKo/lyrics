I always knew this day would come
World is just too small
To keep our paths from crossing
Here we are just look at us

I always wondered what I'd say
Would I tell you that life is great?
I'm getting better all the time
Really lookin' up

Could I be too proud
To show my heart?
Well, to tell the truth
It's not that hard

I'm still not over you
Still the only thing I wanna do
Is open up my arms and reach for you
And to hear you say, you want me, too

You're the one for me
Time doesn't seem to disagree
Baby, I'm still not
Over you getting over me

Guess I'll never be
Over you

So there it is, I've said it now
God I wish some way somehow
You'd look at me, start to cry
Say, you missed me too

But you moved on
I understand
Yeah, I tried that too
But here I am

I'm still not over you
Still the only thing I wanna do
Is open up my arms and reach for you
And to hear you say, you want me, too

You're the one for me
Time doesn't seem to disagree
Baby, I'm still not
Over you getting over me

Guess I'll never be

Strong enough to finally set you free
I know love will never let me be

Over you
I'm still not over you
