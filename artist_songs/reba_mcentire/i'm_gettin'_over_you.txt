I changed my number, bought some new clothes
Got some different records and a new stereo
I'm gettin' over you, I'm gettin' over you

I'm goin' out dancin', learnin' new jokes
I'm stayin' out later than I should I suppose
But, I'm gettin' over you, I'm gettin' over you

I took our name off the mailbox
Redecorated our room
I'm not sayin' the hurtin's all gone
But it'll be gone soon

I'm gettin' over you
So what if you're not here
I'm gettin' over you
And it'll happen one of these years

I ordered make-up from Vogue magazine
I'm takin' aerobics two nights a week
And I'm gettin' over you, oh, I'm gettin' over you

I'm gettin' over you, Mmm, I'm gettin' over you

My friends come over and they'll wonder why
You're picture's back on the wall
It's their proof that losin' you
Don't bother me at all

I'm gettin' over you
So what if you're not here
I'm gettin' over you
And it'll happen one of these years

Yeah, I'm gettin' over you
I'm gettin' over you
I'm gettin' over you
Ooh-ooh I'm gettin' over
I'm gettin' over you...
