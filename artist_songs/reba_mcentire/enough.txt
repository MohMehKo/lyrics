He tells me he's working late
He tells me that he can't stay too long
So I turn the lights off
I fall asleep before he's home
Tomorrow I'll wake up alone
Feeling that familiar low
My heart's screaming, no

But everytime I think I've had enough
He comes around and wraps me up in love
And I wind up giving in
Cause he gives me just enough
To make me think that 
There's still hope for us
In the end it's only me
Wishing I could be
Wishing I still was
Enough

He think it's best to tell me lies
He don't even try to hide, the truth
So he won't hurt me
He made a promise he can't keep
He can't promise anything
The half of him he gives to me
Will never be enough

But everytime I think I've had enough
He comes around and wraps me up in love
And I wind up giving in
Cause he gives me just enough
To make me think that 
There's still hope for us
In the end it's only me
Wishing I could be
Wishing I still was

Enough to make him wanna stay
Enough to make him walk away
I just wanna hear him say I was

Enough
To make me think that 
There's still hope for us
But in the end it's only me
Wishing I could be
Wishing I still was
Enough

I know I'll never be
Oh, I know I never was
Enough, Enough

Oh I'm wishing I could be
No I'll never be
Oh, Enough
Never was, Enough
Never be
