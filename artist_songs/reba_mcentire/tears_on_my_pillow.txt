You don't remember me
Oh but I remember you
Was not so long ago
You broke my heart in two

Tears on my pillow
Pain in my heart
Caused by you

If we could start anew
I wouldn't hesitate
I'd gladly take you back
And tempt the hand of fate

Tears on my pillow
Pain in my heart
Caused by you

Love is not a gadget
Love is not a toy
When you find the one you love
You fill your heart with joy

If we could start anew
I wouldn't hesitate
I'd gladly take you back
And tempt the hand of fate

Tears on my pillow
Pain in my heart
Caused by you

Tears on my pillow
Pain in my heart
Caused by you

You, you, you...
