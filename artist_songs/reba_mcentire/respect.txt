All I'm askin'
Is for a little respect when you come home
Hey, baby - when you get home
Hey, mister

I ain't gonna do you wrong
While you're gone
I ain't gonna do you wrong
'Cause I don't wanna
All I'm askin'
Is for a little respect when you come home
Hey, baby - when you get home
Yeah

I'm up to givin' all my money
And all I'm askin' in return honey
Is to give me my propers when you get home
Yeah, baby - when you get home
Yeah

Your kisses: sweeter than honey
Guess what - so is my money
All I want you to do for me
Is give me some respect when you get home
Hey, baby - give it to me
When you get home

All the time you keep on tryin'
You're runnin' out, fool

And find out I'm not alone
