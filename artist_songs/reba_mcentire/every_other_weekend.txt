[Reba:]
Every other Friday
It's toys and clothes and backpacks
Is everybody in
Okay, let's go see dad
Same time in the same spot
Corner of the same old parking lot
Half the hugs and kisses there are always sad
We trade couple words and looks and kids again
Every other weekend

[Kenny:]
Every other weekend
Very few exceptions
I pick up the love we made in both my arms
It's movies on the sofa, grilled cheese and cut the crust off
"That's not the way mom makes it, daddy," breaks my heart
I miss everything I use to have with her again
Every other weekend

[Kenny:]
I cant tell her I love her

[Reba:]
I can't tell him I love him

[Both:]
'Cause there's too many questions and ears in the car

[Reba:]
So I don't tell him I miss him

[Kenny:]
I don't tell her I need her

[Both:]
She's(He's) over me, that's where we are

[Kenny:]
So we're as close as we might ever be again
Every other weekend

[Reba:]
Every other Saturday
First thing in the morning
I turn the TV on to make the quiet go away
I know why, but I don't know why
We ever let this happen
Fallin' for forever was a big mistake
There's so much not to do and all day not to do with him
Every other weekend

[Kenny:]
Every other Sunday
I empty out my backseat
While my children hug their mother
In the parking lot
We don't touch,
We don't talk much,
Maybe goodbye to each other
As she drives away with every piece of heart I got,
I reconvince myself we did the right thing,
Every other weekend

[Kenny:]
I can't tell her I love her

[Reba:]
I can't tell him I love him

[Both:]
'Cause there's too many questions and ears in the car

[Reba:]
So I don't tell him I miss him

[Kenny:]
I don't tell her I need her

[Both:]
She's (He's) over me that's where we are
We're as close as we might ever be again
Every other weekend

[Kenny:]
Yeah, for fifteen minutes,
We're a family again

[Reba:]
God, I wish that he was still with me again

[Kenny:]
Every other weekend
