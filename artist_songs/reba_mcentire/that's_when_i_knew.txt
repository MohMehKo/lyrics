It wasn't when you walked out, wasn't when you said goodbye
It wasn't when I sat down and had myself a real good cry
Oh, it wasn't when I tore your picture from the frame
Threw it in the fire and sent it up in flames
I still felt the same

Oh, but then tonight, I met someone
We went out and we had fun
He made me laugh, we danced all night
And I didn't see your face when I was looking in his eyes
That's when I knew
I was over you

I was staying busy, trying to keep you off my mind
Baby, but your memory, it put up a real good fight
Oh, I went out with friends to have a drink or two
They tried to cheer me up, there was nothing they could do
I was missing you

But then tonight, there with him
It felt so good to feel good again
He took my hand and I didn't mind
And I didn't try to stop him when he kissed me goodnight
That's when I knew
I was over

Crying in my pillow
Praying that you'd come home
Waiting for the phone to ring
Wondering where it went wrong
Wishing I could move on
Thought I'd never feel this way
I thought I'd never see this day

Oh, but then tonight, I met someone
We went out and we had fun
He made me laugh and we danced all night
And I didn't see your face cause I was looking in his eyes
That's when I knew
I was over you
I was over you
