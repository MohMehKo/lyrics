Whatever way it hurts the least
That's how we should try to leave
We got a few things wrong, let's get this right
Whatever tears don't stain our cheeks
Whatever words don't cut so deep
And we don't even have to say goodbye

You take your heart, and I'll take my heart
We'll start over
If it's gotta break, let's break it clean
You'll find another, I'll find another
Let's hurt each other
Whatever way it hurts the least

Whatever lie won't burn your tongue
Tell it now then I'll tell you one
And we'll pretend that this is for the best
This isn't working anymore
So I hope what you're looking for
Is behind whatever door you open next

You take your road, I'll take my road
We'll start over
You go west and I'll go east
You'll find another, I'll find another
Let's hurt each other
Whatever way it hurts the least

We can be friends or we can be strangers
Whatever way it hurts the least
Cuss me now or call me later
Whatever way it hurts the least
Whatever way it hurts the least

You take your heart, I'll take my heart
We'll start over
If it's gotta break, let's break it clean
You'll find another, I'll find another
Let's hurt each other
Whatever way it hurts the least
Whatever way it hurts the least
