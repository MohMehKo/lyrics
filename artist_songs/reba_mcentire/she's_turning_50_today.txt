Her husband left on saturday.
For a woman who was half her age.
Sunday she just layed in bed.
With the covers pulled over her head.

But on monday morning she woke up.
And loaded up her pick-up truck.
Took one last look at her old life.
Then hit the gas, then said goodbye
To all her jeans and her old baseball caps.
Cause she knows for sure, she aint comin back.

This is a house she though
She'd never spend this day
Sitting behind the wheel, on the interstate.
40 was quite alright
She's changing roads tonight.
And its such a bittersweet
Way to celebrate
She's turning 50 today.

She left that Oklahoma town
The only world she had know till now.
Memories of those 20 years.
She watched them in her rear-view mirror.
Fade away
Oh, but thats all right
Yeah, this could be the time of her life.

This is a house she thought
She'd never spend this day
Sitting behind the wheel, on the interstate
40 was quite alright
She's changing roads tonight
And it's such a bittersweet way to celebrate
She's turning 50 today.

Oh, her windows are down
The wind blows her hair
There she goes, could be anywhere

40 was quite alright
But she's changing roads tonight
Tommorrow's a mystery
Oh, and she can't wait.
She's turning 50
She's turning 50
She's turning 50 today
