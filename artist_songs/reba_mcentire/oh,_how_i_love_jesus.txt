Because He first loved me...

There is a name I love to hear
I love to sing its worth
It sounds like music in my ear
The sweetest name on earth

Oh, how I love Jesus
Oh, how I love Jesus
Oh, how I love Jesus
Because He first loved me

It tells me of a Savior's love
Who died to set me free
It tells me of His precious blood
The sinner's perfect plea

Oh, to me He is so wonderful
To me He is so wonderful
To me He is so wonderful
Because He first loved me

Oh, how I love Jesus
Oh, how I love Jesus
Oh, how I love Jesus
Because He first loved me
Because He first loved me
Oh, He first loved me
