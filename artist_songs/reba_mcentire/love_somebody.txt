You're gonna hurt sometimes, leave you to be
By the side of the road with the dirt and debris
Your name in the dust on your face
And you can't shake it off
You're gonna learn some things you don't wanna learn
When the taste of the fruit leaves a bite and a burn
You're taking your heart and your phone
And you're turning them off

But still you're gonna love somebody
Don't you wanna love somebody?
You ain't alive 'til you love somebody
Everybody wants to love somebody

Don't say that you're done
Cause you're never done
Go on, go on, go on
And love somebody

You're gonna find someday the thicker the wall
The higher the fence, the harder the fall
When you're tryin' to sleep but you can't
Cause it keeps spinning 'round
You're gonna go somewhere that you've never thought
You'd ever go again, there's no way to stop
And there's no way to know that you're lost
Until you're finally found

That's why you're gonna love somebody
Don't you wanna love somebody?
You ain't alive 'til you love somebody
Everybody wants to love somebody

You can damn and doubt it
You can cry about it
But you can't live without it

That's why you gotta love somebody
Don't you wanna love somebody?
You ain't alive 'til you love somebody
Everybody wants to love somebody
