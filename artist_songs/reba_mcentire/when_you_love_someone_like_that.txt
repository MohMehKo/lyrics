Girl it ain't right, it just ain't right, don't tell yourself that it was you.
You followed your heart, you gave it your best, there's nothing more you can do.
Guys like him, are like the wind and you know it's just too bad.
They go in and out again and never know what they had.
Girl I can tell you he'll do the same to someone else,
It ain't about you, so dont be so hard on yourself.

'Cause when you love (when you love)
When you love someone like that, when you give what you can't take back.
When you love (when you love)
With all your heart and soul, it's so hard to let it go
Oh when you love someone like that (when you love someone like that)
Oh when you love someone like that

Oh, we've all loved and lost, it's happened to us all
(I hear what you say but I feel like the only one)
