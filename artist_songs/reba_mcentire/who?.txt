Who...who's gonna love ya like I do
Who...who ya gonna find that can do the things that I do
Before you say goodbye
You better think about it one more time
And tell me who...who ever held you any tighter
Who...who ya gonna find that can take you any higher
Before you put me down
You better stop and look around
And tell me who...who-who

Well you might just find a match that can kindle your desires
But what good is just one candle
When what you need is fires

And tell me who...who-who-who
Who...who-who/who...who-who

Before I let you go
One thing I've got to know
So tell me who
Who's gonna love ya like I do
Who...who-Who
Who you gonna find that can do the things that I do
Who...who-Who
Who ever held you any tighter
Who...who-Who
Who ya gonna find that can do the things that I do
