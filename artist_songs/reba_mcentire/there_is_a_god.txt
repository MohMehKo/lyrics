Try and put your arms around the 100 year old tree
Climb up on a horse and let it run full speed
Take a look down at the world from 30,000 feet
On your next flight

Watch a flock of birds against the morning sun
Close your eyes and listen to the river run
Catch a firefly in your hand or a raindrop on your tongue
That's right

There is a God
There is a God
There is a God
How much proof do you need?

Plant a seed and see what comes out of the ground
Find the heartbeat on your baby's ultrasound
In a few years hear it laughing
Don't it sound like a song?

Stop and think about what you don't understand
Things like life and love and how the world began
Hear the doctor say we can't explain it
But the cancer is gone

There is a God
There is a God
There is a God
How much more proof do you need?

Science says it's just all circumstance
Like this whole world's just an accident
But if you want to shoot that theory down
Look around
Just look around

There is a God
How much proof do you need?
There is a God
There is a God
There is a God
How much more proof do you need?
How much proof do you need?
Ooh yeah
There is a God
