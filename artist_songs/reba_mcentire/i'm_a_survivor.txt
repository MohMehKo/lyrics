I was born 3 months too early
The doctor gave me 30 days
But I must of had my momma's will
And God's amazing grace
I guess I'll keep on livin'
Even if this love to die for
Cause your bags are packed and I ain't crying
You walking out and I'm not trying to change your mind
Cause I was born to be...

The baby girl without a chance
A victim of the circumstance
The one who oughta give up
But she's just too hard headed
A single mom who works two jobs
Who loves her kids and never stops
With gentle hands and a heart of a fighter
I'm a survivor

I don't believe in self-pity
It only brings you down
May be the queen of broken hearts
But I don't hide behind the crown
When the deck is stacked against me
I just play a different game
My roots are planted in the past
And though my life is changing' fast
Who I am is who I wanna be

The baby girl without a chance
A victim of circumstance
The one who oughta give up
But she's just to hard headed
A single mom who works two jobs
Who loves her kids and never stops
With gentle hands and a heart of a fighter
I'm a survivor....

Oh...A single mom who works two jobs
Who loves her kids and never stop
With gentle hands and a heart of a fighter
I'm a survivor....

But I must of had my momma's will and God's
amazing grace

I'm a survivor...(Say once then hum)
