I might bite my lip, look down at my shoes.
I might clench my fist or just leave the room.
But, I'm not gonna cry, not one single drop.
Cause once I get started out, I may never stop.
I might even laugh, right in your face.
When you come out and ask, oh, if I'll be okay.
But, I'm not gonna cry, not one single drop.
Cause once I get started out, I may never stop.
It's gonna take the night of fighting with all I've got to keep the first tear from falling down,
but, if I don't hold the waters back, the dam is gonna crack and I'll be damned if I'm gonna drown.
So, I'm not gonna cry, if that's what you thought.
Cause once I get started out, I may never stop.
No, I'm not gonna cry, not one single drop.
Cause once I get started, I may never stop.
So, I might bite my lip, look down at my shoes.
