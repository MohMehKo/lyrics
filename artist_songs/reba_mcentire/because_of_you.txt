[Reba:]
I will not make the same mistakes that you did
I will not let myself
Cause my heart so much misery
I will not break the way you did,
You fell so hard
I've learned the hard way
To never let it get that far

[Reba & Kelly:]
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
[Reba:]
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
[Reba & Kelly:]
Because of you
I am afraid

[Kelly:]
I loose my way
And it's not too long (before you point it out) [Reba & Kelly]
I cannot cry
Because I know that's weakness (in your eyes) [Reba & Kelly]
I'm forced to fake
A smile, a laugh everyday of my life
My heart can't possibly break
When it wasn't even whole to start with

[Reba & Kelly:]
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
[Reba:]
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
[Reba & Kelly:]
Because of you
I am afraid

[Reba:]
I watched you die
I heard you cry every night in your sleep
(I watched you die...) [Kelly]
I was so young
You should have known better than to lean on me
(I was too young for you to lean on me...) [Kelly]
You never thought of anyone else
You just saw your pain
(You never saw me...) [Kelly]
And now I cry in the middle of the night
For the same damn thing

[Reba:]
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me but everyone around me
Because of you [Reba & Kelly]
I am afraid

[Reba:]
Because of you...
[Kelly:]
Mmmmmm... Oooooh...
[Reba:]
Because of you...
[Kelly:]
Mmmmmm... Oooooh...
