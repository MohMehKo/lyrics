I want a Sunday kind of love
A love to last past Saturday night
And I'd like to know
It's more than love at first sight
I want a Sunday kind of love

And I want a - a love that's on the square
Can't seem to find somebody
Someone to care
And I'm on a lonely road that leads to nowhere
I need a Sunday kind of love

I do all my Sunday dreaming
And all my Sunday scheming
Every minute, every hour, every day
And hopin' to discover
A certain kind of lover
Who will show me the way

And my arms needs someone to invoke
To keep me warm when Mondays and Tuesdays grow cold
And I need a love for all my life to have and to hold
I want a Sunday kind of love - oh yeah
Yeah, I don't want a Monday or a Tuesday
A Wednesday or a Thursday
Friday or Saturday
I don't want nothin' baby
But I want a Sunday kind of love
