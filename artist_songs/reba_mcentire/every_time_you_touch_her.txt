Do you hold her all night long
Do you sing her our love song
Do you kiss her lips until love makes her weak, oh darlin'
Do you promise her the moon
Does she think loves coming soon
Does she know each move is made from memory, oh darlin'

Every time you touch her (Every time)
Every time you touch her think of me
When she reaches out for you ,the same way my arms do

Does she know the truth your love belongs to me, oh baby
Do you wonder in the dark if she sees into your heart
Do you close your eyes so she will never see, oh baby

Every time you touch her (Every time)
Every time you touch her think of me

Nights were never made to spend alone I can wish you love, but I can't wish you gone
Do you hold her all night long
Do you sing her our love song
Do you kiss her lips until love makes her weak, oh darlin'

Every time you touch her (Every time)
Every time you touch her think of me
