Yeah-yeah-yeah
Mmm-mmm-mmm

You know it seems like I've loved you forever
Who could be closer than you and I
People even say we're so much alike
But they don't know why

I've been lovin' you so long
That I know every move you make
Every breath you take
What I feel is so strong
Sometimes I don't know where I end
And where you begin
(And/Oh) you make me so happy
Feeling like this
There's so much ahead that I don't wanna miss
Oh, I wanna keep it so good
So, so, so long

So fine - so real - so right
Oh, I wanna keep it so good
So, so, so long
Yeah-yeah-yeah
Oooooo-oooohh

Oh darlin', don't think for a minute
Time could ever steal the thrill away
You still got the power to be my man
And you know you can

I've been lovin' you so long
That I know every move you make
Every breath you take
What I feel is so strong
Sometimes I don't know where I end
And where you begin
(And/Oh) you make me so happy
Feeling like this
There's so much ahead that I don't wanna miss
Oh, I wanna keep it so good
So, so, so long

So good - so fine - so real - and so right
Oh, I wanna keep it so good
So, so, so long
(So long - so long)
So good - so fine - so real - so right
(So good - so fine - so long)
So, so, so long-ooh
(So good - so fine - so long)
So, so, so long - Uhh!
