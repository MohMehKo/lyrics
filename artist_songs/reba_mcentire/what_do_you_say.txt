Stuck at a red light outside an adult bookstore
His son said Daddy what are all those X's for
As the light turned green he changed the subject fast
Started talking about football as they drove right past

So what do you say in a moment like this
When you can't find the words to tell it like it is
Just bite your tongue and let your heart lead the way
Let's get out of here
Oh what do you say

Seventeen years old
She was out with her friends
They started drinking at some party
Till she was three sheets to the wind
Her momma always told her she could call no matter what
She was crying on the front steps
When her mom showed up

So what do you say in a moment like this
When you can't find the words to tell it like it is
Just bite your tongue and let your heart lead the way
Let's get out of here
Oh what do you say

Sometimes you gotta listen to the silence
And give yourself a little time to think

Her every breath is weaker than the last
And lately when she sleeps she talks about the past
Her husband knows she's tired of holding on
She looks at him and says I wanna go home

What do you say in a moment like this
When you can't find the words to tell it like it is
Just close your eyes and let your heart lead the way
Oh what do you say

Just close your eyes and let your heart lead the way
Oh what do you say
Ooo, what do you say
