People back home wouldn’t know me now.
I was in the dark, had my head in the clouds.
Changing is hard, and surviving is tough.
It’s amazing what it takes to wake you up.

I like some of the things about my new life,
Especially the part where I’m not your wife.
Here’s to the new me.
I never thought I could feel so free.
I’ll get over what you’ve done to me.
Say hi to the new me.

I was just saying!

People out here have a different idea,
The way I should talk and how I should live.
It wasn’t my plan to start over again,
But I’m playing my cards the best I can.

I like some of the things about my new life,
Especially the part where I’m not your wife.
Here’s to the new me.
I never thought I could feel so free.
Oh, I’ll get over what you’ve done to me.
Say hi to the new me.

Yeah, that’s right!

Here’s to the new me.
I never thought I could feel so free.
Oh, I’ll get over what you done to me
Say hi; say hi to the new me.
(Say hi!) I never thought I could feel so free (I could be so free!)
Oh, I’ll get over what you’ve done to me.
Say hi to the new me.
