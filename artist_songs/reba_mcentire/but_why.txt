I can open doors all by myself
And I'm strong enough to face this world
Without anybody's help
But why, why would I want to
Why, when you love me like you do

[Chorus:]
I could go on livin'
Without tasting your kiss
Get by without this moment
You touching me like this, but why

I could keep this feeling locked in my heart
I could bury these emotions, and put up my guard
But why, why start resisting
Why, look at all I'd be missing

[Chorus]

But why would i do that
I'd have to be crazy
To give all you give me
What you do to me baby

I could go on livin'
Without tasting your kiss
Get by without this moment
You touching me like this
And holding me and loving me like this,
But why, why would I want to baby
Oh, why
