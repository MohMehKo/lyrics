I thought I had my life under control
I was the one in charge of my heart and soul
Now I've lost focus and I'm losing more sleep than I should
I want you too bad, for my own good

My intuition tells me I'm in too deep
This time this heart of mine is playing for  keeps
I've fallen harder than I ever imagined I would
I want you too bad, for my own good

If anyone had told me I'd be feeling like this
I would have laughed in their face
Now I'm addicted to the thrill of your kiss
and it's a habit that I can't break

My independence is a thing of the past
My better judgement is fading fast 
But I wouldn't give you up not even if I thought I could
I want you too bad, for my own good
I want you too bad, for my own good
