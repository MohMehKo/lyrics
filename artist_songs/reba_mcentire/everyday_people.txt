College Kids turning twenty-one
And their senior year spring break was here
They headed south.. but not for sun
On their skin where the storms had been

It was hard
Fixing windows and shigles and doors
And the tide never felt so good before

[Chorus:]
Everyday People are the ones who are making miracles
And it's beautiful
Everyday People lifting up the world
Like an answered prayer
I thank God their there
They're the one's who care
Everyday People

Doctor said "Good News we caught it soon enough, we can clear this up"
But she's 30 and single with two kids to raise
Times are tough these days
So her friends made some calls and the word spread around
How her bills got paid she don't know how

[Chorus]

A little girl takes her Mama's hand
And walks inside saying "Please don't cry"
As the people who built this house just for them
Laugh through the tears as a family moves in

[Chorus]
