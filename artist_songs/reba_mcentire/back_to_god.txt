Oh have you looked around
Have you heard the sound
Of Mama's cryin'
Or do you turn away
When you see the face
Of the innocent dyin'
In these darkest days
Are you not afraid
That it's too late

You gotta get down on your knees, believe
Fold your hands and beg and plead
Gotta keep on praying
You gotta cry, rain tears of pain
Pound the floor and scream His name
Cause we're still worth saving
Can't go on like this and live like this
We can't love like this
We gotta give this world back to God

Have you lost a love?
Do you feel like givin' up?
Has your heart been broken?
Are your kids okay?
Will they come home safe?
Do you lie there hoping?
You can make a wish, you knock on wood
Oh it won't do no good

You gotta get down on your knees, believe
Fold your hands and beg and plead
You gotta keep on praying
You gotta cry, rain tears of pain
Pound the floor and scream His name
Cause we're still worth saving
We can't go on like this and live like this
We can't love like this
We gotta give this world back to God

You gotta get down on your knees, believe
Fold your hands and beg and plead
Keep on praying
You gotta cry, rain tears of pain
Pound the floor and scream His name
Cause we're still worth saving
Can't go on like this and live like this
We can't love like this
You can hope the best
Make a wish
The only answer is

We give this world back to God
Oh, give it back
