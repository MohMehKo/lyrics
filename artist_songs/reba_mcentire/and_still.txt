Thousands of people live in this town
And I had to run into him
When I saw him there on that busy street
Those feelings came back again
There was nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
He walked up to me, looked in my eyes

And still
The world stood still
I couldn't move
And all I could feel
Was this aching in my heart
Saying I loved him still

He said how have you been
It's great to see you again
You're really a sight for sore eyes
I said I can't complain
Oh, I'm doing fine
We talked as the people rushed by
We laughed about old times and all we went thru
That's when he hugged me and said I've missed you

And still
The world stood still
I couldn't move
And all I could feel
Was this aching in my heart
Saying I loved him still

That's when she walked up to him
He said this is my wife
I gave my best smile
But I was dying inside
He said we've gotta go now
It's getting late
It was so good to see you
Then they walked away

And still
My world stood still
I couldn't move
And all I could feel
Was this aching in my heart
Saying I loved him still
