It's a Sunday mornin', choir just a little off key
First kiss wasn't what you'd thought it be
The call you got that you thought could only be a bad dream
Your only child leavin' home when they turn eighteen 
Breakin' up ends up bein' the best thing
When you realize what you wanted, what you need

Hallelujah for the heartache
Hallelujah for the good days
Hallelujah for every breath we get
Hallelujah, Amen

It's a Saturday night you never want to end
It's a broken heart you never got to mend
It's the words that you heard that you can't unhear again
It's the way you didn't know was the last goodbye
When you learn everything has a last time
The same mistakes that you made you see in your little girl's eyes

Hallelujah for the heartache
Hallelujah for the good days
Hallelujah for every breath we get
Hallelujah, Amen

For the times we get
For the chance we don't
From the very first breath
Till it's carved in stone

Hallelujah for the heartache
Hallelujah for the good days
Hallelujah for every breath we get
Hallelujah, Amen
(Hallelujah... hallelujah... hallelujah)
Hallelujah for every breath we get
Hallelujah, Amen
(Hallelujah... hallelujah... hallelujah)
Amen
(Hallelujah... hallelujah...)
Amen
