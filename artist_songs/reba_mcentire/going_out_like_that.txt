It's been awhile since she put that red dress on
and slip into those high heels
She's got a couple of guys blowing up her phone
and she loves the way that feels
You'd never know she was going through a break up
There ain't a single tear messing up her make up

He thought she'd be sitting home crying,
but she ain't goin' out like that.
She's had enough of feeling like dying,
she ain't goin' out like that.
Everybody, here comes the life of the party, yeah, she is.
He might have left her brokenhearted,
but she ain't goin' goin out like that.

She's got her hands up dancin' like the floors on fire.
Yeah she's the hottest thing in here.
Guess she finally got tired of being sick and tired.
Now she's lookin like she don't care.
She was hurting, well she must've forgot.
She's smiling while she's throwing back shots.

He thought she'd be sitting home crying,
but she ain't goin' out like that.
She's had enough of feeling like dying,
she ain't goin' out like that.
Everybody, here comes the life of the party, yeah, she is.
He might have left her brokenhearted,
but she ain't goin' goin out like that.
