It sure gets quiet
When the kids go to bed
We lay here inthe silence
Putting off what must be said

I read a book you watch T.V.
As out love dies quietly
I'm so sad
I don't know what I've just read

Somebody should leave
But which one should it be
You need the kids
And they need me
Somebody should leave
But we hate to give in
We keep hopin somehow
We might need each other again

You say goodnight
And turn and face the wall
We lie here in the darkness
And the tears start to fall

If it as only you and me
Goodbye might come more easily
But what about
Those babies down the hall

Somebody should leave
But we hate to give in
We just keep hopin
We might need each other again
