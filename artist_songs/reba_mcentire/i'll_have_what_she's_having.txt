No I don't want no jack and coke
Please sit me where there ain't no smoke
Dont need nothin cloudin up my eyes

Well you see that girl over there
Dancin like shes on thin air
Theres got to be a secret to her smile

Well I think that I just found it
And hes twirlin her around
Well I'd like to place my order
You might wanna to write this down

I'll have what she's havin'
I want what she's got
Someone sweet as he can be
And by the way that HOT
A tall order I suppose
If you can find me one of those
I'll have what she's havin'

Well I like the way he looks at her
Its plain to see he knows the words
That makes her shine from forty feet away

If theres any justice in this world
He's got a twin who wants a girl
Who looks like me excuse me while I pray
So if you could slip my number in that pocket on his hip
It would be appreciated and reflected in your tip

I'll have what she's havin'
I want what she's got
Someone sweet as he can be
And by the way that HOT
A tall order I suppose
If you can find me one of those
I'll have what she's havin'

A tall order I suppose
If you can find me one of those
I'll have what she's havin'

Well I know its wrong to covet
But why should she have all of it
I'll have what she's havin'

Oh I'll have what she's havin'
