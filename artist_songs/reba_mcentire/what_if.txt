Sometimes I don't understand
Feels like I'm living in a world gone mad
look around all around it's just the same people
they just rush everywhere 
No time to ever take the time to care
we're the one's, we're the losers in this game
so where is the tenderness we sacrifice for progress 
and where is the love we need
you know it makes me wonder 

What if everybody, what if everybody reached out with just one hand (reached out with just one hand)
What if everybody, what if everybody sang out with just one voice (sang out with just one voice)
Maybe we could just change things 
What if everybody, what if everybody cared with just one heart (cared with their own heart)
What if everybody, what if everybody tried to light one spark (tried to light one spark)
Maybe we could change things somehow

Somehow it's all up to us 
we got to take this world and make it a world of love 
we got to do it now, we got to find a way to make it change somehow
There's got to be a way for us to make it better

What if everybody, what if everybody reached out with just one hand (reached out with just one hand)
What if everybody, what if everybody sang out with one voice (sang out with just one voice)
Maybe we could just change things 
What if everybody, what if everybody cared with just one heart (cared with their own heart)
What if everybody, what if everybody tried to light one spark (tried to light one spark)
Maybe we could change things...

Here in our hearts, oh the answer is there
if we only look there inside them
we can make it better oh we can make it 
we can make it better if we try together 

What if everybody, what if everybody reached out with just one hand (reached out with just one hand)
What if everybody, what if everybody sang out with one voice (sang out with just one voice)
Maybe we could just change things 

There's got to be (got to be a better way)
For us to make it better...
sang out with just one voice...

What if everybody, what if everybody cared with just one heart (cared with their own heart)
What if everybody, what if everybody tried to light one spark 
Maybe we could change things...
