[Pimp C:]
You know why I'm mad? Let me tell you why I'm mad
I'm mad because e'rybody on these records lyin
E'rybody lyin, everybody's this big D-boy
E'rybody's these hardco' gangstas
E'rybody gon' do this to each other when they see each other
And truth be told, we too blood 
to be havin to much money in this rap game to be goin to war with each other
Don't nobody wanna fight nobody in this rap game
Cause 98% of these dudes is cowards

[Chorus - Pimp C:]
Bitch don't try to play with me, don't try to play with me
Bitch don't try to play with me, don't try to play with me
Bitch don't-bitch don't try to play with me, don't try to play with me
Bitch don't-bitch don't try to play with me, don't try to play with me
Bitch-bitch-bitch-bitch don't try to play with me, don't try to play with me
Bitch don't try to play with me, don't try to play with me
Bitch don't-bitch don't try to play with me, don't try to play with me
Bitch don't-bitch don't try to play with me, don't try to play with me

Bitch don't try to play with me, I ain't to be played with (with)
Cause I'm a trill nigga, I be on some made shit
I be on some boss shit, never with a peon
Any city that I be in (be in) or corner that I be on (that I be on)
They know my face up in the hood like Leon (Leon)
Comin down candy poppin trunk, showin neon (neon)
AC blowin cold with a fresh, load of freon (freon)
Back the fuck up, when I gets my O.G. on (G on)
Pussy niggaz pullin jacks and blame it on recession ('cession)
Talkin 'bout he feedin his family, that shit's depressin ('pressin)
Ridin on them 30's but his kids still stressin (stressin)
Somebody need to teach his ass a motherfuckin lesson (lesson)
G's start ridin (ridin) yo' ass start duckin (duckin)
You keep on playin hoe games and you're bound to get a fuckin (fuckin)
You actin like a bitch (bitch) and that just ain't the way to be (be)
Play with them other niggaz, bitch don't try to play with me

[Chorus]

Bitch don't try to play with me, I ain't with them games G
Always kept it pimpin, never played the game lamely
Got a G uniform, so you wanna claim G
Buy my fitted, put it on, it don't make us the same, see?
I'm cut from a different cloth, came from a different womb
I'ma live a different life, you're buried in a different tomb (tomb)
Playin a different tune (tune) you sing the same song
Barely got a bottom bitch, talkin 'bout yo' game's strong (strong)
You must be kidding me, boy you a comedian
with jokes, while these bitches get broke any town you see me in
That's the lane that we be in, always on the peak, stroll
Cause we cold, and we get this money nigga three-fold (fold)
Got that rap hustle (hustle) got that crack hustle (hustle)
Got that bitch sellin her pussy on the track hustle (hustle)
But you can't break a bitch (bitch) that ain't the way to be (be)
Play with them other niggaz, bitch don't try to play with me

[Chorus]

[Pimp C:]
All my statements are MY statements, that's how I feel
You got some people already feel the same way that might not like how they feel
But that's how I feel
If you wanna get mad at me for the way I feel, then gon' get mad at ME
And a fight go with that, you feel me? [echoes]
