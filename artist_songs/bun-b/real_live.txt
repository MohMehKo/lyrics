And they know it when they see me ridin' my car. (car!)
Candy - with the dro inside a big jar, (jar!)
I'm bout to roll that motherfucka in a ci-gar (ci-gar!)
And when the Swisha sweet is hit I'd be - careful (why,)
That smoke will have you coughin all your shit up! (all your shit up!)

[Chorus: Bun B]

Everywhere I go hold up pimpin' is respected ('ey, 'ey!)
Hoes keep a playa chose, honor and except it. ('ey, 'ey!)
Astonishin collective, my ism is effected ('ey!)
Wake up to some pressed clothes, pussy and some breakfast. (God!)
Pimpin' is a threshold - physically neglected,
Women call my phone and plee for GLC to smash this ('ey, 'ey! cash!)
Tryna check on me and see what they can come and help with ('ey, 'ey, 'ey!)
