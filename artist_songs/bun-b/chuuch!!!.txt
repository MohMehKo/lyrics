Ah yeah
2010 and we still rolling
You know Bun
My dad used to tell me every time he thought he knew it all
Something new would come up
So at this time let's welcome
Drake, the newest member to the family
Whom my son, JS prince discovered
Make no mistake the army is behind ya
Now Bun I've been labeled as a quiet storm
And it maybe true
But I've been watching a genius at work on this album
And without further ado, yo pimp give us your blessings

Chuuch

Yeah
I'm back baby and better than I ever was
I got the streets on fire so forget a buzz
I ain't tripping on sounds scan a beat DS
It's easy to find with or without your GPS
And now we riding next
Biden or Obama
Go ask the hustlers, the gangsters, ask your mama
And they'll tell you the best that ever did it
Is still in here doing it, you can fuck with it
And I'm a hit it on the head with a hammer
Reppin H-town like five slam a jam
Am I hard enough, am I real enough, am I ready
Bro well you already know
On your march, set, ready, go

[Chorus:]
I came to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth
I came to represent for the south
In the streets and in the booth
I came from the bottom to the top
And I'm out here doing my thang
So if you're trying to get it like I get it let the congregation sing

Yeah
We back baby and better then we ever was
It's UGK so quit acting like we never was
You see the group is too trill and in effect
If Rap-a-lot is rolling with us
We in to wreak
So ask Tip, ask Hova, ask Diddy
Go ask Yeezy, Jeezy, ask 50
And they'll tell you I'm through when I spit it
It's still in here doing it, you can't fuck with it
And I'm a hit it in the chest with the nina
Reppin H-Town like James Prince Senior
Am I hard enough, am I real enough, am I ready
Bro well you already know
On your march, set, ready, go

[Chorus:]
I came to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth
I came to represent for the south
In the streets and in the booth
I came from the bottom to the top
And I'm out here doing my thang
So if you're trying to get it like I get it let the congregation sing

Yeah
It's back baby and better than it ever was
That dirty south shit
That you can only get from us
That H-town, slow down, drop the screw music
And it ain't going no where so get used to it
Go ask Trey, ask Paul Wall, ask Roll
Go ask Coppa, ask Slim, they already know
And they'll tell you they ready to represent it
It's still in here doing it, you can fuck with it
And I'm a hit 'em low, chop 'em at the knee
Reppin PAT like a young Pimp C
Am I hard enough, am I real enough, am I ready
Bro well you already know
On your march, set, ready, go

[Chorus: x2]
I came to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth
I came to represent for the south
In the streets and in the booth
I came from the bottom to the top
And I'm out here doing my thang
So if you're trying to get it like I get it let the congregation sing
