[chorus]
you can run for your life
you can stay here and fight
just dont die (dont die)
just dont die, die, die, die

you can open your mind
you can fall you can fly
just dont die (dont die)
just dont die, die, die, die

[Bun B]
look here homeboy its time to stop playin'
the world is gettin' crazy especially the hood i stay in
the old ways of the world is just decayin'
for better or for worse, i dont no, but all im sayin'
is day in and day out is the same old same, the same old players and the same old game
we make a couple dollars then we spend it
herdin in the drop but we always pretend it
like its all good but its all bad cause its slow, and we really cant move it like we used to no more (no more)
so we hustle just to keep up the illusion, we always winnin' we all or we losin'
lets keep it real, dont sweep the shit under the rug
dont nobody die rich from selling drugs
they just die (just die, just die)
now thats cold but thats true, so tell me what the fuck is yo ass gon' do

[chorus]
you can run for your life
you can stay here and fight
just dont die (dont die)
just dont die, die, die, die

you can open your mind
you can fall you can fly
just dont die (dont die)
just dont die, die, die, die

[talib kweli]
damn it feels good to see people up on it
you can feel it in the air like sequel up on it
 they dont know im rich, cause i dont flaunt it
already a target like the local with the scope on it
ate the food on your plate, im back for seconds
u dude's got it backward like the black sabbath record, check it
its like they tryin to get the message
we deep in the recession people reachin for their weapons, bleh
hunger said it make a peaceful mutherfucker violent
motivation niggas b whilin when their stomach growls
express yourself to strength in numbers no one wants an honest speak your mind, but always respect the code of silence (shhhhh)
brooklyn dudes quick to buck ya
but the quick its sticky the blood is too thick
the quicker picker upers, hey
you can bring bounty, shit its in your clothes
bring dounty
you cant get rid of it

[chorus]
you can run for your life
you can stay here and fight
just dont die (dont die)
just dont die, die, die, die

you can open your mind
you can fall you can fly
just dont die (dont die)
just dont die, die, die, die

(I mean......... ill roots)
