[Verse 1:]
She A Dime Piece Top Flight Brand
She Thick And She Stylish And She Tight Man
And Everynight Man When The Lights Low
She Good Man High Pro Nitro
Always Give Me What I Desire
All Night Long Never Get Tired
Its That Fire Its That Flame
Hit That One Time Youll Never Be The Same
Its The Tiger You Cant Tame
And If You Get Bitched You Got Nobody To Blame
She Know I Gotta Get Back To My Stack
But When I Try To Leave Shell Be Callin Me Back

[Chorus:]
You Know I Gotta Get On My Grind
I Dont Play With My Money Or My Time
She Know I Gotta Get Back To The Bread
But When Everytime I Try To Leave Baby Sad
You Know I Gotta Leave Cant Stay
You Know Im Coming Back Another Day
I Gotta Get Back To Stacking Cheese
But When I Try To Go Baby Said Please

[Verse 2:]
She Said She Hate When Im Not Home
Its Like Every Other Day Man In Gone
Chasing Out Cheddar Tryin To Get Paid
But She Rather Have Me Home Tryin To Get Laid
She Keep A Good Real House
She Can Cook She Can Clean No Doubt
She Keep Herself Looking Good
And The Engine Gonna Purr If I Check Under The Hood
Under The Hood Wish I Could She Know I Cant
She Begging Me To Stay But She Know I Aint
She Know I Gotta Get Back To My Stack
But When I Try To Leave Shell Be Callin Me Back

[Chorus:]
You Know I Gotta Get On My Grind
I Dont Play With My Money Or My Time
She Know I Gotta Get Back To The Bread
But When Everytime I Try To Leave Baby Sad
You Know I Gotta Leave Cant Stay
You Know Im Coming Back Another Day
I Gotta Get Back To Stacking Cheese
But When I Try To Go Baby Said Please

[Verse 3:]
Now She Blocking Off The Exit
She Tryin To Have My Keys And My Necklace
Telling Me To Come Sex This Acting All Reckless
Girl You On Some Next Shit
Getting Hotter Than A Candle Lit
I Dont Know If I Can Handle It
Babygirl So Scandelous
She Come Any Closer I Might Have to Dismantle It
Mantle It Beat It Out The Frame For Her
The Bed Hotter Than A Flamethrower
She Know I Gotta Get Back To My Stack
But When I Try To Leave Shell Be Callin Me Back

[Chorus:]
You Know I Gotta Get On My Grind
I Dont Play With My Money Or My Time
She Know I Gotta Get Back To The Bread
But When Everytime I Try To Leave Baby Sad
You Know I Gotta Leave Cant Stay
You Know Im Coming Back Another Day
I Gotta Get Back To Stacking Cheese
But When I Try To Go Baby Said Please
