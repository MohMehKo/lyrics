If your heart ain't busy tonight,
Maybe it would like to get with mine.
If your heart ain't busy tonight,
I could keep it occupied for a long, long time.

If your lips ain't got something pressing to do,
If your arms aren't held up, they're invited too.
If your heart ain't busy tonight,
Maybe it would like to get with mine, anytime.

Well it's kind of you, to lend me an ear.
That's a start but I believe
If I could only get the rest of you over here,
Then all of you might fall in love with, all of me.
If your heart ain't busy tonight,
Maybe it would like to get with mine, anytime.

Oh yeah.

If your feet are restless for somewhere to go,
And your eyes want something more to see.
Why don't you let them lead the rest of you to my door,
So all of you can fall in love with, all of me.

If your heart ain't busy tonight,
Maybe it would like to get with mine.
If your heart ain't busy tonight,
I could keep it occupied for a long, long time.
Yes I could.

If your lips ain't got something pressing to do,
If your arms aren't held up, they're invited too.
If your heart ain't busy tonight,
Maybe it would like to get with mine, anytime.

If your heart ain't busy tonight,
Maybe it would like to get with mine...uh huh.
