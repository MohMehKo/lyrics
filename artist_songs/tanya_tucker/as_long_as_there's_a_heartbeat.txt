There's a full moon up above tonight
But I don't know if it will always shine
And I can't say tomorrow it won't rain
One thing that I know will never change

As long as there's a heartbeat keeping me alive
And day turns into night and there's stars up in the sky
As long as there's a heartbeat keeping me alive
I'll give all my love to you

Through good and bad you stand right by my side
Through all the ups and downs we face in life
We'll grow old and silver haired someday
Youth may pass but love will still remain

As long as there's a heartbeat keeping me alive
And day turns into night and there's stars up in the sky
As long as there's a heartbeat keeping me alive
I'll give all my love to you

Time goes by it can make you feel alone
The future's so uncertain
But there's one thing you should know

As long as there's a heartbeat keeping me alive
And day turns into night and there's stars up in the sky
As long as there's a heartbeat keeping me alive
And I'll give all my love to you, I'll give all my love to you
