Love can't be measured with diamonds and gold
Before you spend your money I oughta let you know
If you wanna get to me, try the little things

Don't need that mansion on top of the hill
Too many rooms with nothing to fill
You can't furnish me with the little things

Rub my back, make me laugh
Hold me while I dream
All it takes to make my day
Is to tell me you love me, little things

It doesn't matter what mood I'm in
I always melt when you begin
Whispering little things

Rub my back, make me laugh
Hold me while I dream
All it takes to make my day
Is to tell me you love me

Oh, little things

Rainy walks, a midnight talk
Dance me on your feet
Hold me close, don't let go

All I'll ever need is a single rose
A kiss hello, that smile upon your face
The tender way, you say my name
Takes my breath away

Little things, oh yeah, aha

Love can't be measured with diamonds and gold
All I'll ever need, oh, is little things
Mmm, little things, little things
