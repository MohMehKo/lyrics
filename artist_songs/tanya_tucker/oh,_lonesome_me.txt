Well, everybody's going out and having fun
I'm just a fool for staying home and having none
I can't get over how he set me free
Oh, lonesome me

A bad mistake I'm making by just hanging 'round
I know that I should have some fun and paint the town
A lovesick fool is blind and just can't see
Oh, lonesome me

But I'll bet he's not like me, he's out and fancy free
He's flirting with the girls with all his charms
Yeah, I still love him so and brother don't you know
I'd welcome him right back here in my arms

There must be some way I can lose these lonesome blues
Forget about the past and find somebody new
I've thought of everything from A to Z
Oh, lonesome me

Well, I bet he's not like me, he's out and fancy free
He's flirting with the girls with all his charms
Oh, but I still love him so and honey don't you know
I'd welcome him right back here in my arms

Oh, there must be some way I can lose these lonesome blues
Forget about the past and find somebody new
I've thought of everything from A to Z
Oh, lonesome me
Oh, lonesome me
Oh, lonesome me
