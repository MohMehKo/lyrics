She'll always get you when your guard is down
Pick you up and then drag you round
And everybody knows you'll be found
Following a trail of tears

She keeps her heart all locked in chains
You'll never have a chanse to love again
But you won't be the first my friend
You're following a trail of tears

A trail of teardrops always fall
Cos girls like that don't care at all
She just wants to see you crawl
Crawling through the trail of tears

You'll tell her that you need her so
But she'll just laugh and then you'll know
That you've got a lifetime left to go
Following a trail of tears

A trail of teardrops always fall
Cos girls like that don't care at all
She just wants to see you crawl
Crawling through the trail of tears

You're asking me how I can tell
But it's a story that I know well
Cause I've been walked all over hell
Following a trail of tears

A trail of teardrops always fall
Cos girls like that don't care at all
She just wants to see you crawl
Crawling through the trail of tears

A trail of teardrops always fall
Cos girls like that don't care at all
She just wants to see you crawl
Crawling through the trail of tears

Crawling through a trail of tears 
Crawling through a trail of tears
