She wouldn't know me if she saw me
And you'd turn your head if you did
She'll never know how much you loved me
Or what kind of love we had
Or what kind of love we had

You threw away all our pictures
But the memories won't go away
She's asking questions that you don't have to answer
It's written all over your face, yes
It's written all over your face

I bet she knows when I'm on your mind
I bet she sees it in your eyes
What's in your heart you can not hide
I bet she knows when I'm on your mind
I bet she knows when I'm on your mind

Late in the midnight hour
When you're doing what lovers do
There's still a desire deep down inside
That's just between me and you, yea
It's just between me and you

Now don't you ever feel guilty
Giving just half of your heart
Holdin' on to your foolish pride
Is just keeping us apart.
Yea, it's just keeping us apart

In the cool of the night
When the howling wind calls my name
You can run to her arms
But it's not the same
It's just not the same
