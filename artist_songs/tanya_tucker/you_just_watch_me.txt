You just watch me, baby
One of these breathless nights
I'm gonna steal your heart
And make you mine

You're gonna say you want me
Beg me to never leave
If you don't think so
Then you just watch me

When you see me comin'
Ain't no use runnin' 'cause

I'll be the dream that haunts you
And when the dawn's upon you
I'll be the only light you'll see
You just watch me

You just watch me, baby
I'm the moon above
A blanket of night comin' down
To wrap you up

Open up your window
Breathe the cool night air
The winds of love
Are everywhere

When you see me comin'
Ain't no use runnin' 'cause

I'll be the dream that haunts you
And when the dawn's upon you
I'll be the only light you'll see
You just watch me
