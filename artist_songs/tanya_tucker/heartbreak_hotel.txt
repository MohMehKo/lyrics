[Intro:]
This is a heartbreak hotel
This is a heartbreak hotel
This is a heartbreak hotel
This is a heartbreak hotel
[repeat]

[I (Whitney)]
You said you'd be here by 9
And said you took your time
You didn't think to call me, boy
Here I sit, tryin' not to cry
Askin' myself why
You'd do this to me

[Refrain (Faith)]
Since you're not around for me to tell you baby face to face
I'm writin' you this letter, and this is what I have to say

[Chorus]
All I really wanted was someone to care
Instead you told me lies when someone else was on your mind
What you do to me, look what you did to me
I thought that you were someone who would do me right
Until you played with me emotions and you made me cry
What you do to me, you take what you did to me

[II (Whitney)]
Now I see that you've been doin' wrong
And played me all along
And made a fool of me, baby
You got it all wrong to think that I wouldn't find out
(Uh!)
That you were cheatin' on me baby
How could you do it to me

[Repeat Refrain]

[Chorus]
All I really wanted was someone to care
Instead you told me lies when someone else was on your mind (what you did...)
What you do to me, look what you did to me
I thought that you were someone who would do me right
Until you played with me emotions and you made me cry
What you do to me (why you do it?), you take what you did to me (you didn't have to do it to me, baby)

[Repeat Intro]

[repeat chorus 2x]

I ain't gon' take it..... I ain't gon' take it boy
