I warned you baby, a long time ago
You got to stop all this, hurtin' me so
But, I don't think you heard a word I said
Well I'm telling you now honey
That there's danger ahead
Treating me bad, telling me lies
That ain't cool baby, that ain't wise
You've been running around, spending all of my bread
You better change your ways now
'Cause there's danger ahead

Hell hath no fury, like a woman scorned
They should've told you that on the day you was borned
Better watch your step now, be careful where you tread
I'm telling you this baby
That there's danger ahead

Can't understand why you want to do me wrong
Straighten up baby, or you'll find me gone
I gonna love you, that's sure enough
But if you're looking for trouble, well I can get tough
I'm gonna quit all my cryin', dry all the tears that I shed
Yea I'm warning you baby that there's danger ahead
Well, I'm warning you baby that there's danger ahead
Oh, I'm warning you baby that there's danger ahead
