Sometimes you can be like a stranger 
in moments when you're so far away 
in the night when I reach out to hold you 
you just turn away, why do you turn away 

oh, I love you so when you're smilin' 
but your smile has faded overnight 
will we stay like this for a lifetime 
gettin' nothin' right, gettin' nothin' right 

why do we always have stormy weather 
why do we have it so rough 
is it so hard just to stay close together 
why can't we ever have love 

oh, I knew from the first time I saw you 
I just had to make you mine 
felt so sad when you told me 
about your troubled life, all about your troubled life 

so here we are just a few years further 
still tryin' to make it work 
I've a feelin' what we really need right now, girl 
is just a little love, oh baby, just a little love 

why should we always have stormy weather 
why should we have it so rough 
it's not so hard just to stay close together 
why can't we only have love
