If you could only see your way through
Your blue eyes into my heart
If you would only come inside my dreams
Maybe stay awhile, play around

I'll show you all the secrets of my mind
Do my best to please you all of the time

If you feel it you can have it
If you want it come and get it
You can do it we got a magic
I believe you won't regret it

I have tamed you for a lifetime
You have held me in my glory
I have seen you in my lifetime
Come and help me write the story

If you would only take a little more time
Then you'd see where I'm coming from
If you could only read between the lines
Baby, you'd know that I'm the only one

We go to places we've never been
I'll be your lifetime lady and lifetime friend

If you feel it you can have it
If you want it come and get it
You can do it we got a magic
I believe you won't regret it

I have tamed you for a lifetime
You have held me in my glory
I have seen you in my lifetime
Come and help me write the story

If you feel it you can have it
If you want it come and get it
You can do it we got a magic
I believe you won't regret it

I have tamed you for a lifetime
You have held me in my glory
I have seen you in my lifetime
Come and help me write the story
