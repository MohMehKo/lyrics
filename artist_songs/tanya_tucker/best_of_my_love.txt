Every night I'm lying in bed holdin' you close in my dreams
Thinkin' about all the things that we said
They're coming apart and it seems
We tried to talk it over but the words come out too rough
I know you were tryin' to give me the best of your love

Beautiful faces and light at the places look at the way that we live
Wastin' our time on cheap talkin' wine left us so little to give
That same old crowd was like a cold dark cloud
That we could never rise above
Here in my heart I give you the best of my love

Oh, oh, sweet darling, get the best of my love
Oh, oh, sweet darling, get the best of my love

I'm going back in time and it's a sweet dream
Here was a quiet night and I would be all right if I could go on sleepin'
Now in the morning I wake up and worry what's gonna happen today
And you see it your way and I see it mine but we both see it slippin' away
You know we always have each other, baby, I guess it wasn't enough

Oh, oh, but, oh, sweet darling, you get the best of my love
Oh, oh, sweet darling, every night and day you get the best of my love

Oh, oh, sweet darling, oh, you get the best of my love
Here in my heart, I give you the best of my love
