I only meant to love you don't you know it babe
Why couldn't you be contented with the love I gave
I've given you my heart and now you want my mind
Your love scares me to death boy it's the chokin' kind

You can kill a girl with bullets poison or a knife
But it hurts her more to take her pride and run her life
Whatever it is you want boy I hope you find
But that hat don't fit my head it's the chokin' kind

When you fall in love again now take a tip from me
If you don't like the peaches walk on by the tree
Find what you want and keep it treat it sweet and kind
But let it breathe don't make your love the chokin' kind
But let it breathe don't make your love the chokin' kind
