Everybody talk a bit too fast today
Did everybody say "we need it now"
Did they leave you wishing
You could vanish in thin air
And when you found out you couldn't
Then you found your way here

Come in out of the world
From out of the cold and lonely night
Come in out of the world
Where everything's judged in black and white
Let me take your coat and hat
And lay them on the shelf
And you can be yourself

Come in out of the world
Where everyone swears that they're your friend
Come in out of the world
Out where they use you again and again

Let me pour a glass or two
There's nowhere else to be
There's no one here but me
Come in

You don't need permission
To say what's on your mind
I'm willing to listen
If you're willing to take the time

Come in out of the world
From out of the cold and lonely night
Come in out of the world
Just let it go and hold me tight
And if you look into my heart
Before the night is through
You'll see the place I've saved for you
Come in out of the world
Come in out of the world
Come in
