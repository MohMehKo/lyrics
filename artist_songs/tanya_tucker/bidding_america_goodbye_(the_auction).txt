Dear Mr. Johnson, we're sorry to inform you
Your request for a second loan has been refused
And the board of directors up in the city
Has instructed us to take the farm from you
We understand your problems 
and wish that we could help you
But the fallin' price of wheat's not our concern
And the cost of operation may well be risin'
But the fact is that you lose more than you earn

This saturday mornin' there will be an auction
Underneath a cold gray country sky
And while the rest of the nation is still sleepin'
They'll be bidding America goodbye

And so Mr. Johnson let us say in conclusion
That we know your family's worked that land for years
If we can be of assistance during your transition 
Please don't hesitate to call us here

This saturday mornin' there will be an auction
Underneath a cold gray country sky
And while the rest of the nation is still sleepin'
They'll be bidding America goodbye

They'll be bidding America goodbye, goodbye
