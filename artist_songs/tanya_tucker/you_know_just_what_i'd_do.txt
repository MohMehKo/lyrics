If we lost all we had
Would I walk your rocky road or take a different path
Would I sell my pride for you
If you ask me to walk the streets
You know just what I'd do

Would your child have a home
If it should be born of love other than our own
Would I still stand by you
Knowing you've loved someone else
You know just what I'd do

If my love for you meant giving up my life
Would I lay it down for you
And if you were blind would I give you my sight
You know exactly what I'd do if you ask me to

Would I live with the scar that you carry in your heart
From another woman's war
Would I lend you wounds for you
If I knew you needed me
You know just what I'd do
