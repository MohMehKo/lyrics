It sure felt like forever
When we were together
Imagine my surprise
When You Told Me It Was Over
Threw your coat over your shoulder
And walked out of my life
You said that it was just infatuation
Something I'd get over soon enough

But it hurts like love
And it feels like heartache
You were here in my arms

Then you were gone
And now it's just too late
It's a crying shame
After all of this pain
I'm still not sure just what it was
But it hurts like love

I don't know how it happened
I gave it all my passion
Believing it was real
I was sure that it could save you
But all it ever gave you
Was this emptiness I feel
I know that it's only an illusion
But every night that I don't feel your touch

But it hurts like love
And it feels like heartache
You were here in my arms
Then you were gone
And now it's just too late
It's a crying shame
After all of this pain
I'm still not sure just what it was

But it hurts like love

I'm still not sure just what it was
But it hurts like love
