You’ve got a lot of nerve, showing up here,
Weren’t you the one who made it perfectly clear,
That you found someone, to make all your dreams come true.

And now you say you made a big mistake,
and you never, never, should’a walked away, 
and you know now, I’m the only one for you.

Should’a thought about that,
Before you broke my heart.
Should’a come back,
‘Fore you went too far.
Once the bridge is burned,
You can’t un-strike the match.
Should’a thought about that, uh huh.

When you left you said the hands of time,
Would heal the hurt, and I’d be fine
You said someday, I’d love another man.

Now you say your back to make things right,
Baby, there’s nothing wrong with my life.
You promise to be good, 
Well that’s too bad.

Should’a thought about that
Before you broke my heart.
Should’a come back,
‘Fore you went too far.
Once the bridge is burned,
You can’t un-strike the match.

Should’a thought about that.

(Thought about that)
Before you broke my heart.
(Should’a come back,)
‘Fore you went too far.
Babe you crossed that line,
Now you can’t come running back.

Should’a thought about that,
Before you broke my heart.
Thought about that,
When I was begging you to stay.
Once the bridge is burned,
you can’t un-strike the match.
Should’a thought about that, uh huh.

(Should’a thought about that.)

Oh now the bridge is burned.
