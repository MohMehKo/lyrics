Don't believe my heart can stand another you
I need someone who'll be gentle, kind and true
So go your way I've had enough, the game you play is just too rough
I don't believe my heart can stand another you

Of all the people in the world to be standing at my door
Telling me she left me, you know the one I left you for
I sat down and thought it over, now I've come to this conclusion
Don't believe my heart can stand another you

I don't believe my heart can stand another you
Well I need someone who'll be gentle, kind and true
Go your way I've had enough, the game you play is just too rough
I don't believe my heart can stand another you

I've tried every way I know to put you out of myself
I've been as far down as my knees but so far it has been no help
And with you already here what I must say get complicated
I don't believe my heart can stand another you

I don't believe my heart can stand another you
I need someone who'll be gentle, kind and true
I go your way I've had enough, the game you play is too damn rough
I don't believe my heart can stand another you, yeah

I don't believe my heart can stand another you, no, no
I need someone who'll be gentle, kind and true, yeah
I go your way I've had enough, the game you play is too damn rough
I don't believe my heart can stand another you
I don't believe my heart can stand another you
