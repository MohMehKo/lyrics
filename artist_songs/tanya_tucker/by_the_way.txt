By the way I really love you
Just in case you didn't know
And I know baby it's not easy
for you to say I'm the one
But I can tell by the way you love
By the way you smile
By the way you say nothin'
I can see it all in your eyes

By the way I really need you
Everyday of my life
Don't worry baby if words escape you

I feel what you're feelin' and that's enough
I can tell by the way you love

By the way you smile
By the way you say nothin'
I can see it all in your eyes
By the way I know it's not easy
for you to say I'm the one
But I can tell by the way you love me
I can tell I'm the one by the way you love me
