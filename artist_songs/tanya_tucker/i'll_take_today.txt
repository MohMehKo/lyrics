Yeah he's the one - the one I told you about
Yeah, it was serious, but it was long ago
He just might walk over here
And give me a kiss for old times
But don't you worry dear
Old times next to you, can never compare

I'll take today over yesterday, any day
I'll take lying in your arms tonight
Over and above any love I've known
Memories may find me, but they'll always be behind me
I'll take today over yesterday, any day

I'd be lyin' if I tried to tell you now
That I never loved him, and he doesn't ever cross my mind
But that was yesterday, and baby, I don't wanna go back
Here is where I'm gonna stay
With you in each tomorrow of my life

I'll take today over yesterday, any day
I'll take lying in your arms tonight
Over and above any love I've known
Memories may find me, but they'll always be behind me
I'll take today over yesterday, any day
