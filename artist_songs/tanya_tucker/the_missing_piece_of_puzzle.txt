You're the sunshine
That warms my heart each day
You're the rainbow
When gray clouds roll away

You're the melody for the words
That my heart's been tryin' to think of
You're that missing piece of puzzle
That it takes to put together love

You're the paint on the canvas
Where an artist spilled his dream
You're something to believe
In an answer prayer for me

You're my guiding angel
Sent from heaven above
You're that missing piece of puzzle
That it takes to put together love

You're that missing piece of puzzle
That it takes to make my life complete
You're something to remember when I'm down
And need to get back on my feet

You're that missing piece of puzzle
That it takes to put together love
You're that missing piece of puzzle
That it takes to put together love
