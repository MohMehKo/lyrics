It's after midnight - you lie awake 
Counting the hours till daybreak 
What can you do now, where can you go 
When you're about at the end of your rope 
You can...

Drive out to the edge of town 
Where the world is cold and dark 
Look for the flicker of a neon sign 
In the shape of a broken heart 
You'll hear music that will give you chills 
Coming from that run down bar 
You can slow dance with the ghost of love 
To the cry - of a blue guitar

Drive out to the edge of town

In the shape of a broken heart 
You'll hear music that will give you chills 
Coming from that run down bar 
You can slow dance with the ghost of love 
To the cry - of a blue guitar 

It's where the lonely people go 
When they just can't take no more 
You'll see what heartache is all about 
And you can cry till you're cried out 
When you... 

Drive out to the edge of town 
Where the world is cold and dark

You'll hear music that will give you chills 
Coming from that run down bar

To the cry - of a blue guitar
