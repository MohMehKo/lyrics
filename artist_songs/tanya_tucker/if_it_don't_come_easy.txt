I know a man, a good friend of mine;
He spends all his time tryin' to make love work out right.
But the woman he loves, she don't feel the same, no;
I don't know much about love but at least I learned one thing:

If it don't come easy, you better let it go.
'Cos when it don't come easy, there's no natural flow.
Don't make it hard on your heart, you might be better off alone,
If it don't come easy, you better let it go, yeah.

I know a woman, she's got a heart of gold.
You know she'd do anything to make her man feel right at home.
But the man she loves, now, he's a restless kind of guy,
I wish there was a way I could make her realise.

That if it don't come easy, you better let it go.
'Cos when it don't come easy, there's no natural flow.
Don't make it hard on your heart, when you might be better off alone,
If it don't come easy, you better let it go, yeah.

Let it go, though it's hard I know;
Let it loose, I tell you, it's no use.

If it don't come easy, you better let it go.
'Cos when it don't come easy, there's no natural flow.
Don't make it hard on your heart, when you might be better off alone,
If it don't come easy, you better let it,
You better let it,
You better let it go. 

If it don't come easy, you better let it go.
'Cos when it don't come easy, there's no natural flow.
