Grandpa I've been thinking bout you lately
Wondering if you'd found your peace of mind
I bet you'd be proud to know your grandsons
Never crossed that Mason Dixon line

And I still sing the old songs that you taught me
And I still pray to Jesus now and then
And just like you I wish that he would save me
To see the day the South will rise again

Daddy wore his purple heart so proudly
Long before he turned into a man
Buried with our flag across his casket
I was still too young to understand

And I still sing the old songs that you taught me
And I still pray to Jesus now and then
And just like you I wish that he would save me
To see the day the South will rise again

Mama spent her last years in the garden
While brother took his turn behind a gun
Lord, I'd give my life to find the freedom lost
Within the old songs that you sung

And I still sing the old songs that you taught me
And I still pray to Jesus now and then
And just like you I wish that he would save me
To see the day the South will rise again
