Somebody oughta tell that girl,
She's livin' in a dreamers world,
That boy is as gone as gone can be.
But it won't be me,
Naw, it won't me.

Somebody oughta set her straight,
She oughta give up the wait,
He'll never give up bein' free.
But it won't be me,
Naw it won't be me.

To see her fall apart would be more than I can bear.
I'm just too close to that girl in the mirror there.

Somebody oughta let her know,
She's got to let him go,
It's time to face reality,
But it won't be me,
Naw it won't be me

Naw it won't be me.

Well it won't be T,
Naw it won't be me.
