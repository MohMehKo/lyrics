Shine on me sunshine
Walk with me world
It's a skippidity-do-da day
I'm the happiest girl, in the whole U.S.A.

Good morning morning
Hello sunshine
Wake up sleepy head
Why'd we move that bojangle clock
so far away from the bed

Just one more minute
That's why we moved it
One more hug or two
Do you love waking up next to me
As much as I love waking up next to you

You make the coffee
I'll make the bed
I'll fix your lunch
if you"ll fix mine

Now tell me the truth
Do these old shoes look funny
Honey 
it's almost nine

Now you be careful
Gotta go I love you
Have a beautiful day,
And kiss the happiest girl, In the whole U.S.A.

[Bridge:]
Skippidity-do-da
Thank you oh Lord 
for making him for me
And thank you for letting life turn out the way

That I always thought it could be
There once was a time when I could not imagine
How it would feel to say
I'm happiest girl, in the whole U.S.A

[Chorus:]
Now shine on me sunshine
Walk with me world
It's a skippidity-do-da day
I'm the happiest girl, in the whole U.S.A.

[Repeat Chorus 2x (to fade)]
