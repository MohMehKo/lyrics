My cowboy rhythm with your uptown blues 
Might sound a little out of tune 
But I don't care I don't care 
It don't matter to me, baby 
I love you anyway 
Your silk Armani with my wrangler jeans 
Might make us look a little strange 
But I don't care I don't care 
It don't matter to me, baby 
I love you anyway 

Any fool can see the warning signs 
The difference in your world and mine 
But I don't care how fast or high you fly 
I love you anyway 

Any fool can see the warning signs 
The difference in your world and mine 
But I don't care how fast or high you fly 
I love you anyway 
Pig√©on Forge or St. Tropez 
We'll have one fine honeymoon either way 
So I don't care no I don't care 
It don't matter to me, baby 
I love you anyway 

wooh It don't matter to me, baby 
I love you anyway
