On the sidewalks of Savannah
There's an old man ragged and blind
He don't beg an' he don't steal
And he don't fool with wine

With an old guitar in his wrinkled hands
A thousand songs in his mind
You can't keep your heart from lovin'
The song man when you hear him cry

"Song Man, one song for a dime
I got songs that'll make ya happy
And songs that'll make ya cry
I got a special poor man's blues"

"Two for the price of one
It won't cost you a thing to hear me
Sing my favorite Gospel song"

"Lord, I'm comin' home, Lord, I'm comin' home
I've been a fightin' the devil too long
Lord, I'm comin' home"

All the old timers in Savannah
Have known him all of their lives
And they all say that he's done seen
A hundred years go by

With an old dog he calls Govenor John
He starts at the break of dawn
And he don't stop as long as someone
Wants to hear him sing a song

"Song Man, one song for a dime
I got songs that'll make ya happy
And songs that'll make ya cry
I got a special poor man's blues"

"Two for the price of one
It won't cost you a thing to hear me
Sing my favorite Gospel song"

"Lord, I'm comin' home, Lord, I'm comin' home
I've been a fightin' the devil too long
Lord, I'm comin' home"

Lord, I'm comin' home, Lord, I'm comin' home
I've been a fightin' the devil too long
Lord, I'm comin' home
