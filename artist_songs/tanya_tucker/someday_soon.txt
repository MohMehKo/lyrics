Someday soon

There's a young men that a know
His age is 21
He comes from down in southern Colorado
Just out of the service
And he's looking for his fun
Someday soon going with him someday soon

My parents cannot stand him
Cause he rides the rodeo
My father says that he will leave me crying
I would follow him right down
The roughest road I know
Someday soon going with him someday soon

And when he comes to calm
My pa ain't got a good word to say
Guess its cause he was just as wild
In his younger days 

So blow you ol' blue northern   
Blow my love to me
He's drivin' in tonight from California
He loves his darn ol' rodeo 
As much as he loves me
Someday soon going with him someday soon
