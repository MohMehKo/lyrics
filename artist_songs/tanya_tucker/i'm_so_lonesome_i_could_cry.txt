Hear that lonesome whippoorwill he sounds too blue to fly
That midnight train is whining low I'm so lonesome I could cry
I've never seen a night so long when time goes crawling by
The moon just went behind a cloud to hide its face and cry
Did you ever see a robin weep when leaves began to die
That means he's lost the will to live I'm so lonesome I could cry
The silence of a falling star lights up a purple sky
And as I wonder where you are I'm so lonesome I could cry
I'm so lonesome I could cry
