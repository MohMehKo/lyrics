You said goodbye on Tuesday
I figured I would see you by the weekend
I either didn't hear you right
Or maybe this ol' heart just didn't listen

So I'm writing you this letter I may never send
Wonderin' if you're wonderin' how I've been

It's lonely but I'm hangin' in
Hangin' out till I'm with you again
Runnin' out of reason to be strong
Hangin' in, hangin' out, hangin' on

Talk about blue Monday
Tomorrow it's a week I've been without you
I haven't gone to work yet
I couldn't do a thing but think about you

But I know that I can make it through whatever comes
As long as there is still a chance to save our love

It's lonely but I'm hangin' in
Hangin' out till I'm with you again
Runnin' out of reason to be strong
Hangin' in, hangin' out, hangin' on

It's lonely but I'm hangin' in
Hangin' out till I'm with you again
Runnin' out of reason to be strong
Hangin' in, hangin' out, hangin' on
