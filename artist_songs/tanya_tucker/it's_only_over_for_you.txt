Somehow I knew I'd see you tonight
Here in our old rendezvous
I'm at the mercy of old memories
You've got your somebody new

You may wonder why I keep coming by
With this heart so broken in two
Any fool can see with one look at me
That it's only over for you

It's only over for you
No, I'm not the one you found somebody new
You can go on believing we're through
Ooh, but it's only over, it's only over for you

As I watch you falling in love
You can't see me falling apart
And even though you hurt me I know
I still love you with all of my heart

But I won't hide my face in a stranger's embrace
When we dance into each other's view
No, don't be surprised at these tears in my eyes
'Cause it's only over for you

It's only over for you
No, I'm not the one you found somebody new
You can go on believing we're through
Ooh, but it's only over, it's only over for you
Oh, it's only over, it's only over for you
