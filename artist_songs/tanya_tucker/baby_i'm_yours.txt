Baby I'm yours
And I'm yours until the stars fall from the sky
Yours until the rivers all run dry
In other words until the day I die

Baby I'm yours (baby I'm yours)
And I'm yours until the sun no longer shines (yeah)
Yours until the poets run out of rhymes
In other words until the end of time

I wanna stay right here by your side,
Do my best to keep you satisfied
Nothing in this world could ever drive me away
Everyday you'll hear me say

Baby I'm yours (baby I'm yours)
And I'm yours until two and two makes three
Yours until the mountains crumble into the sea
In other words until eternity

I'm gonna stay right here by your side,
Do my best to keep you satisfied
Nothing in this world could ever drive me away
Everyday you'll hear me say

Baby I'm yours (baby I'm yours)
And I'm yours until two and two makes three
Yours until the mountains crumble into the sea
In other words until eternity

Baby I'm yours (baby I'm yours)
Till the sun no longer shine
Baby I'm yours (baby I'm yours)
Till the rivers all run dry
Baby I'm yours (baby I'm yours)
Till the mountains fall down from the sky
Baby I'm yours (baby I'm yours)
Till the poets run out of rhymes
Baby I'm yours (baby I'm yours)
Baby I'm yours ...
