Well I said friend don't take him he's all I've got
Please don't take his love away from me
I'm a beggin' to you friend don't take him he's all I've got
He's everything in life I'll ever need

He is life oh when I wanna live he's everything to me in life that life can give
He's my water oh when I need to drink
He's the first thought in my mind each time I try to think
Let me tell you now friend...

He's my fingers when I want to feel he's the only thing in life to me that's really real
He is love he's all the love I know
He could kiss the ground in the wintertime and make a flower grow
Let me tell you now friend...
