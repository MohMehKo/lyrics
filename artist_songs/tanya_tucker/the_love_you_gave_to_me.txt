I have walked through a world of temptation
I have witnessed the power of gold
I told myself I would not surrender
To all the things that steal the soul

A restless heart bound to wander
Never finding lasting peace
In the sea of life I went under
All my hope abandoned me

They tried to tell me of sweet salvation
And how glorious it could be
But I found nothing I could believe in
Live the love you gave to me

You rescued me and got the wheels turning
You always seem to know just what to do
The fire you started keeps right on burning
Nothing can shake my faith in you

I've been told of sweet salvation
And how glorious it can be
But I've found nothing I can believe in
Like the love you gave to me

They tried to tell me of sweet salvation
And how glorious it could be
But I found nothing I could believe in
Live the love you gave to me
