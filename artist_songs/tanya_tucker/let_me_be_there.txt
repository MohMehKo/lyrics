Wherever you go, wherever you may wander in your life
Surely you know I'll always wanna be there
Holdin' your hand and standing by to catch you when you fall
Seeing you through in everything you do

Let me be there in your morning let me be there in your night
Let me change whatever's wrong and make it right
Let me take you through that wonderland that only two can share
All I ask you is let me be there

Watching you grow and going through the changes in your life
That's how I know I'll always wanna be there
Whenever you feel you need a friend to lean on here I am
Whenever you call you know I'll be there

Let me be there in your morning let me be there in your night
Let me change whatever's wrong and make it right
Let me take you through that wonderland that only two can share
All I ask you is let me be there

Let me be there in your morning let me be there in your night
Let me change whatever's wrong and make it right
Let me take you through that wonderland that only two can share
All I ask you is let me be there, all I ask you is let me be there
