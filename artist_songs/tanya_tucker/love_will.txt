Money won't dry your tears
And words ain't always true
Flowers are nice to look at
But they won't satisfy you

But, honey, love will
Honey; love will
A whole lotta good things won't
But, honey, love will

Candy won't give you sweet dreams
Letters can't hold you tight
Phone calls - they can't touch you
Or keep you warm at night

But, honey, love will
Honey; love will
A whole lotta good things won't
But, honey, love will

You may stop your heart from fallin'
All in self-defense
When all you need is somethin'
To build your confidence

Honey, love will
True love will
A whole lotta good things won't
But, honey, love will

You may stop your heart from fallin'
All in self-defense
When all you need is somethin'
To build your confidence

Don't think that it won't
'Cause, honey, love will
