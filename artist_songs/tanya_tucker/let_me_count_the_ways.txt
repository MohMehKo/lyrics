Here goes one more empty night
Lonely lady foolish pride
Do I need you deep inside?
Let me count the ways

Losing tracks of tears I've shed
Feeling empty as my bed
Could you give me love instead
Let me count the ways

Who could count the times
You're on my mind more and more
Who could count the waves
That reach out for the shore

Days and nights are all the same
One part lonely, two parts pain
Do I need you back again?
Let me count the ways

Who could count the times
You're on my mind more and more
Who could count the waves
That reach out for the shore

Days and nights are all the same
One part lonely, two parts pain
Do I need you back again?
Let me count the ways
Let me count the ways
