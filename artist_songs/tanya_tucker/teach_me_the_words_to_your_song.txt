I hope it's all that I'd found
This may be my last time around
I tried so long but it's always gone wrong
'Cause I don't know the words to your song

Teach me the words to your song
Teach me and I'll sing along
I don't care anymore if it's right or it's wrong
Just teach me the words to your song

I've been hurt time after time
I've laid my heart on the line
I want to stay while the feelin's so strong
So teach me the words to your song

Teach me the words to your song
Teach me and I'll sing along
I don't care anymore if it's right or it's wrong
Just teach me the words to your song
Just teach me the words to your song
