I'm the center of attention in this bar room
'Cause I've got the biggest heartache of the year
And each night those swingin' doors reach out to me and draw me in
'Cause they know each night that I'll come back to wine me up again

Wine me up, turn me on and watch me cry for you
Lately drinkin' warm red wine is all I wanna do
And I never know how tight I'll wine me up 'til I waltz in
But I don't care 'cause I'll be back to wine me up again

I'd like to thank the men who raise the grapes way out in California
And I'm hopin' this will be their biggest year
'Cause scarlet waters all that's left to keep me hangin' on
And that's why I'll try to wine me up each day and night next year

Wine me up, turn me on and watch me cry for you
Lately drinkin' warm red wine is all I wanna do
And I never know how tight I'll wine me up 'til I waltz in
But I don't care 'cause I'll be back to wine me up again
I don't care 'cause I'll be back to wine me up again
