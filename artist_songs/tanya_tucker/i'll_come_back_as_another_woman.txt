You never gave me back the love I gave to you.
You just gave me half your heart and that half was untrue.
So I'll leave you with a promise, from a heart that's heard enough:
Someday you'll find out that you can't escape my love. 

I'll come back as another woman,
One with all the secrets to your heart.
I'll come back as another woman,
I'll be the one you burn for,
That you reach for in the dark.
I'll be the one that breaks your devil heart. 

Some day you'll wake up with your arms around a dream.
The love that she will make to you will be too good to believe.
You'll say: "I  love you," and for once it will be true.
You'll fall too fast to realise who you're talking to.

You'll give your heart and soul, she'll be the only one.
You'll be hers completely, there'll be no way you can run.
And with a smile she'll break your loving heart in two.
And, baby, you'll recall the one who said these words to you:

I'll come back as another woman,
One with all the secrets to your heart.
I'll come back as another woman,
I'll be the one you burn for,
That you reach for in the dark.
I'll be the one that breaks your devil heart. 

You'll hear the echo of my promise, (Ha, Ha, Ha.)
How you laughed and how I cried.
The one you finally give your heart to, (Ha, Ha, Ha.)
Will leave you crying in the night.

I'll come back as another woman,
One with all the secrets to your heart.
I'll come back as another woman,
I'll be the one you burn for,
That you reach for in the dark.
I'll be the one that breaks your devil heart.

I'll come back,
I'll come back
As another woman.
