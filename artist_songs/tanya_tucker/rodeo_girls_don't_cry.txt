Get your horse waylem

on the side of the highway
trying to sleep
dreaming of a new love
she knows she can't keep
hes back down the road
3 or 4 rodeos
might have been her dream cowboy
but she'll never know

riding like the wind
feeling so alive
the wind in her hair
and the dust in her eyes
spotlights are turning
night into day
and just for a little while
the pain goes away

cowboys tell them they love them
but their gone by the dawns early light
they come and they go
but the pain never shows
cause rodeo girls don't cry
awwww

she's giving it up
and gone home before
but it felt like a part of her died
no one could know
but the lord up above
rodeo girls don't cry

cowboys tell them they love them
but their gone by the dawns early light
they come and they go
but the pain never shows
cause rodeo girls don't cry
rodeo girls don't cry
i thought everybody knew
rodeo girls don't cry
