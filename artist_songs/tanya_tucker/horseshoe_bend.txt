It's been a Saturday everyday and a whole month of Sundays
And I get sadder every day he's gone

Horseshoe Bend old friend that's been so long since we saw him
When he laid me down upon your banks and made this girl a woman
As the Virgin Mother sang us a song
Horseshoe Bend he's just like you old river he'll keep rolling
And I'll keep praying someday he'll come home
It's been a Saturday everyday...

Here comes Frank again old friend and there ain't no sign of him
But just because I can't see him don't mean I forgot him
And I'll keep praying someday he'll come home
It's been a Saturday everyday...
[guitar - steel]
Horseshoe Bend old friend that's been...
It's been a Saturday everyday...
