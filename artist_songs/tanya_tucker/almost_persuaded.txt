Last night all alone in a barroom
Met a man with a drink in his hand
He had big brown eyes and coal black hair
And a smile that a girl understands

Then he came and sat down at my table
And as he placed his hands over mine
I found myself wanting to kiss him for temptation
Was flowing like wine

And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside
Then we danced and he whispered I need you
Let me take you away and be your man

Then I looked into his eyes and I saw
It the reflection of my weddin' band
And I was almost persuaded to let strange lips lead me on
Almost persuaded but your sweet love
Made me stop and go home
