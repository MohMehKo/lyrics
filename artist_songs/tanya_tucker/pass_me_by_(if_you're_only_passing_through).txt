Would you look at what came down the road today
Wanting me to be one more mistake to make
A bridge to burn to get to someone knew hey pass me by if you're only passing through
You sure look like the traveling kind to me
Don't stop if this ain't where you want to be
I don't know what you think you've run into
Hey pass me by if you're only passing through
[steel + harmonica]
I'm not gonna be your stepping stone among the other hearts that you've walked on
Lord help me if I fall in love with you hey pass me by if you're only passing through
Hey pass me by if you're only passing through
