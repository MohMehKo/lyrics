She don't want for nothin'
'Cause he buys her everything
But the one thing he don't give her
IS the love that she needs
She cries on pillows made of lace
Dreamin' of some other place

She's got a half a mind to run from
But she knows she'd be back again
She's got everything that a girl could want
But she needs more and she can't stop
Wishin' it all away

Wishin' it all away
Wishin' it all away

Looking out the window
There goes another falling star
Those diamonds on her fingers
Don't do nothing for her heart
She thought that there'd be so much more
Is this what she settled for

She's got a half a mind to run from
But she knows she'd be back again
She's got everything that a girl could want
But she needs more and she can't stop
Wishin' it all away
Wishin' it all away
Wishin' it all away

If she didn't have to go through leavin'
If it could all just disappear
Then she could start all over and be out of here

She's got a half a mind to run from
But she knows she'd be back again
She's got everything that a girl could want
But she needs more and she can't stop
Wishin' it all away
Wishin' it all away
Wishin' it all away
