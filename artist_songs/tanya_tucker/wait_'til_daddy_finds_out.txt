Somebody's drinking his whiskey
Somebody's loving on his wife
Somebody ain't gonna live till tomorrow
If daddy gets home a little early tonight

Wait 'til daddy finds out
He ain't gonna like it
Wait 'til daddy finds out
When he gets home tonight

Well, daddy's been a helluva father
And daddy's been working seven nights in a row
And daddy let mama get a little bit lonely
Sitting home waiting for her sugar to show

Wait 'til daddy finds out
Well, he ain't gonna like it
Wait 'til daddy finds out, yeah
When he gets home tonight

Well, I think I hear a car coming up the drive
I'm gonna run, find me a safe place to hide
'Cause I know what's gonna hit that fan
Oh, mama you better take a look outside

One man walked in the bedroom
One man walked out of town
One man's life spared this evening
And one woman shopping for a new night gown

Wait 'til daddy finds out
Well he ain't gonna like it
Wait 'til daddy finds out
When he gets home tonight

Now I think I hear a car coming up the drive
I'm gonna run and find me a safe place to hide
'Cause I know what's gonna hit that fan
Oh, mama you better take a look outside

Wait 'til daddy finds out
No, no, no, no, no, he ain't gonna like it
Wait 'til daddy finds out, yeah
When he gets home tonight

Wait 'til daddy finds out
No, no, no, no, no, no, he ain't gonna like it
Wait 'til daddy finds out, wait 'til daddy finds out
When he gets home tonight
