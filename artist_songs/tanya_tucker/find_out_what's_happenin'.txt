Baby, you know me well
You know I mean what I say
Before I say 'farewell'
I'll give you just another day

You'd better find out what's happening
Find out what's happening before long
If you don't find out what's happening
You're gonna find out that I'm gone

Tell me what you're gonna do
You better make up your mind
It all depends on you
Or I'm leaving you far behind

Baby, you know it's true
We've been through thick and thin
But if you don't come through
You won't ever see me again
