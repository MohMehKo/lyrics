I don't know where to start  
Now that we're fallen apart.
How can we talk to heart to heart you're so far away what can I say.
I've tried to under-stand but things got so out of hand
Held out as long as I can Now I'm on the telephone  saying.

Can I see you tonight
Just think of the time that we've wasted
Everything will be right  
It could be love if we make it.

Now that we're on the line  
I'll tell you what's on my mind
The love we're trying to hide.  
Well, it's suffering from to much pride.
When will we see the end to this game where nobody wins
For as long as nobody gives in It will go on and on and on.

Can I see you tonight
Just think of the time that we've wasted
Everything will be right  
It could be love if we make it.

Instead of breaking up  
Instead of breaking up

Can I see you tonight
Just think of the time that we've wasted
Everything will be right  
It could be love if we make it.

Can I see you tonight
Just think of the time that we've wasted
Everything will be right  
It could be love if we make it.
