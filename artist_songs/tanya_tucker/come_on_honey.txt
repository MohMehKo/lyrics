Come on honey, it don't matter no more 
Let your lovin' shine down on me 
Come on honey, well it don't matter no more 
Let your lovin' shine down on me, aha
Have you been hurt by some girl 
Who came to take you for a ride 
It seems when you woke up one mornin' 
She was not there by your side 
Well I'm not the kind who whispers into your ear 
The words that you want to hear 
Then she just disappears, whoa 
Someday you'll see that I'm devoted to you, oh 
I'll do what you want me to So

Come on honey, it don't matter no more 
Let your lovin' shine down on me 
Come on honey, it don't matter no more
Let your lovin' shine down on me, aha

What is the problem 
I don't understand why we can't get along 
Don't be afraid of the consequences 
I won't do you wrong 

I'm not the kind who whispers into your ear 
The words that you want to hear 
Then she just disappears, whoa 
Someday you'll see that I'm devoted to you, oh 
I'll do what you want me to So

Come on honey, it don't matter no more 
Let your lovin' shine down on me 
Come on honey, it don't matter no more 
Let your lovin' shine down on me

Come on honey, it don't matter no more 
Let your lovin' shine down on me aha
