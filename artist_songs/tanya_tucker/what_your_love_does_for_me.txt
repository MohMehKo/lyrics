I was givin' up on givin' love another try
But were easy on the heart
And easy on the eye
I wouldn't have believed it if I'd been told
I'd have my very own angel to hold
Like a warm blanket I can wrap around my soul
You're good lookin'
You're good luck
You make me feel like a million bucks
That's what your love does for me
Like a child, a little wild
And like everything I do is in style
That's what your love does for me
You look my outlook and you sure shook it up
With a little bit of sweatness
From your lovin' cup
What was once half empty is now half full
Now I'm an optimist, baby, dyed in the wool
Ever since you gave my lonely heart strings a pull
You're good lookin'
You're good luck
You make me feel like a million bucks
That's what your love does for me
Like a child, a little wild
And like everything I do is in style
That's what your love does for me
You set the mood
You set me free
Like a prisoner with my own jail key
That's what your love does for me
Like a new dime
Don't I shine
Feels like every day with you is spring time
That's what your love does for me
Feel like a child
I'm a little wild
And like everything I do is in style
That's what your love does for me
That's what your love does
That's what your love does for me
