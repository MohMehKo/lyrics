All through school he did real well
Got a good job in the sawmill, yeah
But he wanted more so he went away
As he stepped on board the 802
He could hear his daddy say

"Listen to the big bell a ringin' on the hillside
I hear the town choir singin', oh, so sweet and high
Lady Luck's got a heart of stone
And you're the pride of Franklin County
Don't you leave your natural home" Oh, yeah

A small town kid with the big city blues
A yearnin' heart and taped up shoes, yeah
He wanted more so he went astray
Took a gun and he stole a car and he was on his way

Listen to the big bell ringin' on the hillside
I hear the town choir singin', oh, so sweet and high, high
Lady Luck, she have a heart of stone
But the pride of Franklin County's gonna make it on his own

Well, he got tough, Lord, he was hard, yeah
He robbed a bank, oh, he didn't see the guard
The guard shot him down and as he lay there dyin'
People gathered 'round and they swore they heard him say

"Listen to the big bell ringin' on the hillside
Hear the town choir singin', oh, so sweet and high
Lady Luck's got a heart of stone
Now the pride of Franklin County's goin' home"

Listen to the big bell ringin' on the hillside
Hear the town choir singin', oh, so sweet and high
Lady Luck, she have a heart of stone
Now the pride of Franklin County's goin' home, yeah
Now the pride of Franklin County's goin' home, finally comin' home
