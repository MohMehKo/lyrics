Maybe you wish I was someone else
I've tried so hard to be myself
But I can see you need a change
Some folks get tired of the rain
Some folks get tired of the rain

One sunny day you'll change your mind
And look for clouds but you find
Your rainy girl won't rain no more
Some folks get tired of the rain
Some folks get tired of the rain

Hope you find those sunny days
As bright as you thought they would be
Remember who wanted what a change
It was you babe, not me

My love will last forever more
Just like the rain my love will pour
And when you go I'll love again
Some folks don't tire of the rain
Some folks don't tire of the rain
Some folks get tired of the rain
