You were movin' too fast to ever grow old
Must a took a wrong turn back down the road
Searchin' for truth where there just wasn't any
And the wine's not so sweet when you've had one too many

Somebody's knocking on your door is your day finally coming
Is it the hand of fate or maybe somebody tryin' to tell you something

Looking out the window at the fading light
If you could do it all over where would you be tonight?
Shadows on the walls like her long dark hair
And you know you know better when you say you don't care

Somebody's knocking on your door is your day finally coming
Is it the hand of fate or maybe somebody tryin' to tell you something

You tore it all apart now put it back together
It'd be easier if you could just live forever
You feel something coming that you don't understand
And you pray to the Lord it ain't out of your hands

Somebody's knocking on your door
Somebody's knocking on your door
Maybe somebody tryin' to tell you something
Maybe somebody tryin' to tell you something
