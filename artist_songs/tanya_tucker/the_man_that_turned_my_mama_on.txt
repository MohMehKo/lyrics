I wish I'd known the man a little better that turned my mama on
He must have been a heck of a man
'Cause mama was a lady don't you now

Mama was no prude but she was proper
Never wore her dress too short
She didn't care if you did
But she'd never taken a drink

Grandma Kate did the best she could
To see mama grew up right
So she'd be fittin' one day for courtin'
And to wear some gentleman's ring

I wish I'd known the man a little better that turned my mama on
He was always laughing and sang a right sweet song
I wish I'd known the man a little better that turned my mama on
He must have been a heck of a man
'Cause mama was a lady don't you know

I hear he came to town one day
In a rusty old '49 Ford
Sellin' ladies shoes
And assorted greeting cards

He was killin' good lookin' and easy to like
And turnin' all the ladies heads
But he saw mama first
And Lord knows how some of them travelin' men are

I wish I'd known the man a little better that turned my mama on
He was always laughing and sang a right sweet song
I wish I'd known the man a little better that turned my mama on
He must have been a heck of a man
'Cause mama was a lady don't you know

Mama seemed to forget the things
That grandma Kate had always told her
She ran away one night
With that traveling man

They bought gas at Reba's Truck Stop
And drove to Deseto County
But he brought her home
With a ring upon her hand

Mama's told me how the fever took him
When I was barely five
But I remember him pitchin' me up
And catchin' me

And I love to sit and listen to her
Tell me about my daddy
She says she thought
The sun must surely rise and set in me

I wish I'd known the man a little better that turned my mama on
He must have been a heck of a man
'Cause mama was a lady don't you know
I wish I'd known the man a little better that turned my mama on
He must have been a heck of a man
'Cause mama was a lady don't you know
