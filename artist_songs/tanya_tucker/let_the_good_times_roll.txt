It opens up with the same old scene 
you pushing me on that tire swing
Up so high I could almost touch the sky
The picture fades to you and me 
caught stealing a kiss behind the tree
It's so real it's like you never said goodbye
Every night I turn the lights down low
And take out that old video
I hold your pillow close in the TV's glow
And let the good times roll

The road moves on and it always will 
but I can make time stand still
I can turn it back and make things just the same
And though you're gone, you're still here, 
you're far away but always near
I can see your face and hear you call my name
Freeze frame

Every night I turn the lights down low
And take out that old video
I hold your pillow close in the TV's glow
And let the good times roll
When it comes to an end I can play it all again
You went away but the good old days are here to stay

Every night I turn the lights down low
And take out that old video
I hold your pillow close in the TV's glow
And let the good times roll

Now it's time to turn the lights down low
And let the good times roll

Let 'em roll
