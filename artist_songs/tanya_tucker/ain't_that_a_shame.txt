Well, you made me cry when you said goodbye
Ain't that a shame, my tears fell like rain
Ain't that a shame, yeah, you're the one to blame, oh

Well, you broke my heart when you said we'd apart
Ain't that a shame
Oh well, goodbye, although I cry
Ain't that a shame

You made me cry when you said goodbye
Ain't that a shame
Oh well, goodbye, although I cry
