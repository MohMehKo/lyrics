Right about now you'd be saying sweet nothings
And I'd be hanging on your every word
My lips would be wet with your kisses
And we'd be lost in our own little world

Right about now, I'd be feeling your heartbeat
And your fingers touching my skin
What I wouldn't give to be back in your arms somehow
Right about now

Right about now, you'd promise forever
And swear I hadn't felt nothing yet
Then you'd pull me a little bit closer
And I'd play just hard enough to get

Right about now, we'd be under the covers
Making love that knew no shame
What I wouldn't do to be with you somehow
Right about now

Baby

Now, the clock on the wall keeps ticking
But time's sure been passing slow
And it's myself that I've been kicking
For ever letting you go

But darling, you know where to find me
Should you have a change of heart
I sure could use a little of you no doubt
Right about now

I sure could use you, baby, right about now
Since you've been gone there's nothing, right about now
I sure do need your touching, right about now
Right about now
