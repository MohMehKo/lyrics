Out of the shoot he sits tall as the timber
One hand on the horse and one hand on the sky
Eight seconds later he lands in the money
And winning's a feeling that money can't buy
The kids love a hero and big silver buckles
The girls love the dream of a rodeo man
He loves the backroads and fields without fences
And I guess he loves me because I understand

He's a rain-rain-rainbow rider
He's hitched up his saddle he's ready to ride
He's a rain-rain-rainbow rider

A dream chasing cowboy with a rodeo girl by his side
Winter in Tuscon and spring in Savanna
Reno in June then off to Cheyenne
He remembers the fall that he took last September
He's hopin' he draws that ol' burr again
He's a rain-rain-rainbow rider
He's hitched up his saddle he's ready to ride
He's a rain-rain-rainbow rider
A dream chasing cowboy with a rode girl by his side

Lately he's talking about having a son
Someone who'll learn from the things that he's done
A young bronc bustin' a-buckaroo

A trailer behind an old white Eldorado
A red western sunset and a blue mountain range
Some things in this life he'd like to do over
But livin' with him is something I'd never change

He's a rain-rain-rainbow rider
He's hitched up his saddle he's ready to ride
He's a rain-rain-rainbow rider
A dream chasing cowboy with a rodeo girl by his side

He's a rain-rain-rainbow rider
A dream chasing cowboy with a rodeo girl by his side
