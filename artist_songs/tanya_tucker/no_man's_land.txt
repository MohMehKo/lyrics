Many years ago in Brushcreak Georgia
Molly Marlo was a virgin girl
She lived a mile from a fool named Barney Dawson
Hell bent on getting inside Molly's world

He caught her after church one Sunday morning
And took her body with his rough hard hands
And walked off laughing as she lay there crying
Since then she's been known as No Man's Land

Molly Marlo was No Man's Land
Love could never grow in No Man's Land
The men all tried but she denied them
And they sighed and wrung their hands
But they couldn't go walking
In No Man's Land

Molly grew into a luscious beauty
Each man's head would turn as she walked by
And as their hot eyes watched her body moving
They'd swallow hard and shake their heads and sigh

Molly went to school and studdied nursing
Now you might laugh but it's an honest fact
The first year that she nursed at Millards Clinic
Six men pretended they had heart attacks

Molly Marlo was No Man's Land
Love could never grow in No Man's Land
The men all tried but she denied them
And they sighed and wrung their hands
But they couldn't go walking
In No Man's Land

Years later Barney Dawson lay in prison
In feaverish pain that suffering shell of a man
He was glad to see the nurse from Millards Clinic
'Till he saw the burning eyes of No Man's Land

Molly Marlo was No Man's Land
Love could never grow in No Man's Land
Barney cried but she denied him 
And he prayed and wrung their hands
Now his soul's walking
Through No Man's Land
