She's fifteen and he's barely driving a car
She's got his ring and he's got the keys to her heart
It's just matter of time
They'll spread their wings and fly

[CHORUS:]
two sparrows in a hurri-cane
Trying to find their way
With a head full of dreams
and faith that can move anything
They've heard it's all uphill
But all they know is how they feel
The world says they'll never make it, love says they will

There's a baby crying and one more on the way
There's a wolf at the door with a big stack of bills
They can't pay
The clouds are dark and the wind is high
But they can see the other side

[go to chorus]

She's eighty-three and he's barely driving a car
She's got his ring and he's got the key to her heart
It's just a matter of time
They'll spread their wings and fly

[go to chorus 2]

[CHORUS 2:]
Like two sparrows in a hurri-cane
Trying to find their way
With a head full of dreams
and faith that can move anything
They've heard it's all uphill
But all they know is how they feel
The world says they'll never make it, love says they will
