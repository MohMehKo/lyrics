Yesterday oh how many do you wish you could relive
Turn the page and go back oh I wonder what you'd give
Looking back does it seem when you've planned when you've dreamed
You forgot the most important thing
Smell the flowers while the roses bloom take the time my friend and sing a happy tune
Oh how precious every mile so take a minute learn to smile
My friend let's stop a while and smell the flowers (smell the flowers)
[guitar]
Got a troubled mind friend if you let too much worry rule your days
When you look back do you feel like something precious slipped away
Oh my friend are you the man that the world slip through his hands
Can you remember when you smelled the flowers
Smell the flowers...
Smell the flowers...
