There's a tree out in the back yard,
That never has been broken by the wind.
And the reason it's still standin'
It was strong enough to bend.

For years we have stayed together,
As lovers and as friends.
What we have will last forever
If we're strong enough to bend.

When you say somethin' that you can't take back,
A big wind blows and you hear a crack.
When you say "Hey, well, I might be wrong,"
You can sway with the wind till the storm is gone.
(Sway with the wind till the storm is gone.)

Like a tree
(Like a tree)
Out in the back yard,
That never has been broken by the wind.
Our love
(Our love)
Will last forever,
If we're strong enough to bend.

When you start thinkin' that you know it all,
A big wind blows and a branch will fall.
When you say "Hey, this job takes two,"
We can sway with the wind till the skies turn blue.
(Sway with the wind till the skies turn blue.)

Like the tree 
(Like the tree)
Out in the back yard,
That never has been broken by the wind.
Our love
(Our love)
will last forever,
If we're strong enough to bend.
Our love
(Our love)
will last forever,
If we're strong enough to bend.
