Neither one of us will ever change
We're both the same and that's a shame
'Cause when we were together it was right
We had it all, you and I

You're not changin' me and I'm not changin' you
The only change is what we're goin' through
You took the part of me that I was proudest of
Now you're sayin' that's the part that you can't love

Changes, I'm gonna have to make some changes
Now that I know what your game is
I know that I would only lose, no matter what I do
And the first change that I'll make is gonna be you

If lovin' what you had ain't what you want
What do you need? You don't need me
You said I was the answer to your prayers
It don't seem fair, we both still care

Changes, I'm gonna have to make some changes
Now that I know what your game is
I know that I would only lose, no matter what I do
So the first change that I'll make is gonna be you

Oh, changes, I'm gonna have to make some changes
Now that I know what your game is
I know that I would only lose, oh, can't you see we're through?
(Changes)
Oh, somehow I'll get over you
(Changes)
Somehow, oh, changes, hard for a young girl to cope
(Changes)
