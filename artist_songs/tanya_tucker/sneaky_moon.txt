Radio sittin' on a window sill
I can hear the music comin' over the hill
How am I supposed to stay in bed
With a crazy little love song in my head

Ooh, sneaky moon, ooh, sneaky moon

June bug buzzin' on the front porch light
Heartbreak's waitin' for me outside
I swore, I wouldn't open that door
Here I am in those arms once more

Ooh, sneaky moon, ooh, sneaky moon

Safe and sound at home asleep
Is where I ought to be
Everywhere I go it just keeps
Creepin' up on me

Romeo waited for the sun to set
Before he serenaded Juliet
Eve met the devil on a Saturday night
But who tricked her into takin' that bite

Ooh, sneaky moon, ooh, sneaky moon
Ooh, sneaky moon, ooh, sneaky moon
Ahh sneaky moon
