Oh the sun's gonna shine in my life once more
Love's gonna live here again.
Things are gonna be the way they were before
Love's gonna live here again.

Love's gonna live here, love's gonna live here
Love's gonna live here again.
No more loneliness, only happiness
Love's gonna live here again.

I hear bells a-r9ng9n', I hear birds are singin'
Love's gonna live here again.
And I hear bees a-hummin' and I know the days are comin'
Love's gonna live here again.

Love's gonna live here, love's gonna live here
Love's gonna live here again.
No more loneliness, only happiness,
Love's gonna live here again.

Love's gonna live here, love's gonna live here
Love's gonna live here again.
No more loneliness, only happiness,
Love's gonna live here again.
Love's gonna live here again.
