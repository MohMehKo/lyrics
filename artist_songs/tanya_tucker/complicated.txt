Throw up a quarter and I'll call it
heads he loves me, tails he loves me not
I keep his picture in my wallet
I guess I miss him a little more than I thought
It's complicated
It's underrated
This is so much more than I anticipated
It's heart related
It's complicated

Am I flyin' am I sinkin'?
Do it feel good or do it hurt?

I'd like to tell him what I'm thinkin'
Right now I just can't find them words

It's complicated
It's underrated
This is so much more than I anticipated
It's heart related
It's complicated
We're walking hand in hand on Sunday
Havin' it out on Sunday night
We might be makin' up come Monday
Our love is never black and white

It's complicated
It's underrated
This is so much more than I anticipated
It's heart related
It's complicated

You love to love 'em and you hate to hate 'em
and hate to love 'em

It's complicated, yes it's tough
It's complicated woah yeah
He's wearing me out
This is difficult
You got another quarter?!
