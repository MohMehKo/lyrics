Okay Officer
I admit it, I was speedin'
But before you write me up
Let me tell you the reason

I wasn't tryin' to out run you
I was chasin' a guy who outta the blue
He committed a crime
Back about a mile or two, oh yeah

I was crusin' along
When he pulled up outta no where
He was hotter than the [Incomprehensible] he drove
And just one lane over

He aimed those angel eyes at me
He smiled like we were meant to be
For he stole my heart
From a moving car

It was highway robbery
He grabbed my heart and took off on the run
It was highway robbery
He oughta do time in my arms for what he's done

So, hey Officer
How 'bout you understandin'
Won't you turn your blue light on
And help me catch that bandit

He's got somethin' that belongs to T
I can't let him get away scott free
For it's only right
That he's mine tonight

It was highway robbery
He grabbed my heart and took off on the run
It was highway robbery
He oughta do time in my arms for what he's done

It was highway robbery
Well, he grabbed my heart and took off on the run
It was highway robbery
He oughta do time in my arms for what he's done
He oughta do time in my arms for what he's done, oh yeah

Hey Officer, let's talk 'bout this now
By the time you let me go
That boy'll be all the way in Texas
Sure is good lookin'
By the way, what color are your eyes?
