He just caught the Jamestown ferry, it's not a hot day in January
Like he said it'd be if he ever left me
A case of gone was all he carried as he got on the Jamestown ferry
And he said that gone was all he'd ever be

I didn't think that he'd leave me after sayin' how much he needs me
But the fact still remains, I'm sittin' here all alone
Missin' the lovin' of my baby, Lord, it's 'bout to drive me crazy
He was the sweetest piece of heaven I've ever known

He just caught the Jamestown ferry, it's not a hot day in January
Like he said it'd be if he ever left me
A case of gone was all he carried as he got on the Jamestown ferry
And he said that gone was all he'd ever be

As I walk through his kingdom of honky tonks and bars
I remember how he'd hold me and comfort me with talk
He didn't cuss with every breath he had a soothing Southern drawl
Made me feel like a lady through it all

He just caught the Jamestown ferry, it's not a hot day in January
Like he said it'd be if he ever left me
A case of gone was all he carried as he got on the Jamestown ferry
And he said that gone was all he'd ever be

He just caught the Jamestown ferry, it's not a hot day in January
Like he said it'd be if he ever left me
