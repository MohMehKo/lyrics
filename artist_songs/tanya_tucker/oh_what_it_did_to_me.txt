I saw you tonight
In her arms so tight
I watched as she held you tenderly

You say when she held you
It did nothing to you
But oh, what it did to me

You say when she kissed you
You didn't feel a thing
Well, I felt enough for all three

You want me to believe
It did nothing to you
But oh, what it did to me

And I felt the warm tears
Roll slowly down my face
As I watched another
Slowly take my place

And now it's all over
You want me to forget
And pretend that things are like they used to be

That it was just a kiss
That did nothing to you
But oh, what it did to me

You want me to believe
It did nothing to you
But oh, what it did to me, to me
