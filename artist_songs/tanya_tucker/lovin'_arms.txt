If you could see me now the one who said that she would rather roam
The one who said she'd rather be alone if you could only see me now
If you could hold me now just for a moment if I could really make you mine
Just for a little while turn back the hands of time if I could only hold you now
I've been too long in the wind too long in the rain taking any comforts that I can
Looking back and longing for the freedom of my chains
Laying in your lovin' arms again

If you could hear me now singing somewhere through the lonely night
Dreaming of the arms that held me tight if you could only hear me now
I've been too long in the wind...
Looking back and longing for the freedom of my chains
I can almost feel your lovin' arms again
