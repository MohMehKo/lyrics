I'm sittin' in this New York City hotel room alone
Wishin' I was somewhere else or on my way back home
Nashville Tennessee I know that's where I do belong
Cause I don't know no New York City song

They know I'm from Dixie when I open up my mouth
They don't treat the ladies here the way they do down south
I thought I could make it here but I can't get along
Cause I don't know no New York City song
And Lord I'd like to tell you just how much I'd like to leave
Cause in my mind that south bound song is tuggin' on my sleeve
New York City ain't the place a country girl should be
New York City ain't the place for me
Today I walked a New York City avenue downtown
I've never seen so many people hurryin' around
And when I smile they look as if to say that smiling's wrong
No I don't know no New York City song
I'm sittin' in this New York City...
Cause I don't know no New York City song
