If anyone had told me Things would get this far 
I'd have told them they were crazy Yet, here we are 
Pride can be our enemy We both know the cost 
So tell me if you're having Second thoughts 
We don't have to do this 
It's not carved in stone 
Or are we so lost we can't find 
Our way back home 
Tell me where's it written 
That we can't change our minds 
We don't have to do this 
We don't have to say goodbye

Years should count for something 
Tears can't be in vain 
To let this go so easy would be a shame

We don't have to do this 
It's not carved in stone 
Or are we so lost that we can't find 
Our way back home 
Tell me where's it written 
That we can't change our minds 
We don't have to do this 
We don't have to say goodbye 
If leaving is the answer 
Why does this feel so bad 
Should we really walk away 
From everything we had 

Tell me where's it written 
That we can't change our minds, no
We don't have to do this 
We don't have to say goodbye 
We don't have to do this 
We don't have to say goodbye
