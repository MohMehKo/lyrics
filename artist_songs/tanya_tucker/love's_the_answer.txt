If you think it's hard in this day and time
To hold your man like I been holding mine
There's no secret just some little things to do
It worked for me and it's bound to work for you

A loving smile will start his day out right
A goodbye kiss will bring him home at night
Reach out to him when he needs a helping hand
Touch him gently so, he knows you understand

Be proud of him when you know he's done his best
Let him know you think, he's better that the rest
If you wanna hold your man, this is the way
Love him more today than you did yesterday
Love's the answer, love's the answer

Be proud of him when you know he's done his best
Let him know you think, he's better that the rest
If you wanna hold your man, this is the way
Love him more today than you did yesterday
Love's the answer, love's the answer
Love's the answer, love's the answer
