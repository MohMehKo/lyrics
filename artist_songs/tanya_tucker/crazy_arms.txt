Now blue ain't the word for the way that I feel
There's a storm brewin' in this heart of mine
This ain't no crazy dream, I know that it's real
You're someone else's love now, you're not mine

Crazy arms that reach to hold somebody new
While my yearnin' heart keeps sayin' you're not mine
My troubled mind knows soon to another you'll be wed
And that's why I'm lonely all the time

So please take the treasured dreams I had for you and me
And take all the love I thought was mine
Oh, someday my crazy arms will hold somebody new
But for now I'm so lonesome all the time

Crazy arms that reach to hold somebody new
While my yearnin' heart keeps sayin' you're not mine
My troubled mind knows soon to another you'll be wed
And that's why I'm lonely all the time
And that's why I'm lonely all the time
