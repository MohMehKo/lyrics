Every now and then you feel like jumping off the deep end
Pack a few things head to New Orleans, commit a few sins
With a good rockin' daddy that can rock all night
Make you feel good, make you feel all right
You don't do it, baby, but you think about it

You wanna spend your life, your love and your money in the fast lane
Let the good times roll, body and soul ruin the family name
There's a devil on your shoulder and he's talkin' to you
I know what he's sayin' 'cause I've been there too
You don't do it, baby, but you think about it
Well we all got a list of the do's and don'ts
Â 
Save a little space for the wills and won'ts
Underline things like right and wrong
I could just go on and on and on

Yeah you want to get crazy girl, and there's no doubt
That somebody's doing what you're doing without
But you don't do it, baby, you just think about it
You think about it, baby
There's a devil on your shoulder and he's talkin' to you
I know what he's sayin' 'cause I've been there too
No, you don't do it, baby, but you think about it
No, no, no you don't do it, baby, but you think about it

I'm thinking about it right now, aha
