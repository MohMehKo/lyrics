I'm not Lisa, my name is Tanya
Lisa left you year's ago
My eyes are not blue
But mine won't leave you
Til the sun light has
touched your face

She was your morning light
Her smile told of no night
Your love for her grew
With each risin' sun

And then one winter day
His hand lead her's away
She left you here
Drownin' in your tears here
Where you stayed for years, crying Lisa

Lisa

I'm not Lisa
My name is Tanya
Lisa left you, years ago
My eyes are not blue
But mine won't leave you
Til the sun light 
Shines through your face

I'm not Lisa, my name is Tanya
