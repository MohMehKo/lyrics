Lay me down on porch at midnight
Get me high on the southern moonlight
Walk me down by the river star bright
Hold me, my friend, I'm home again

I'm a Tennessee woman
Who's been away from home
I know I don't belong in that city world
Old Smoky Mountains, do you remember me
I'm from Tennessee, I'm just a local girl

Make my bed where the sun can wake me
From my dreams of childhood take me
Where the winds of time can't shake me
Help me unload this weight of the road

I'm a Tennessee woman
I'm a Tennessee woman
