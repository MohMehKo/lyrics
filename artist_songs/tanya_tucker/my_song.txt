I wasn't lookin' for no one, I was just out tryin' to have some fun
When, baby, you walked in my world that day
Then you looked right into my eyes
And a voice that could make the devil cry
You just sang my poor heart away

Friends may come and friends may go
But lovers either stay or break your heart, oh, you just fall apart
I thought I could take it or leave it but I can't hardly believe it
But nobody ever sang a song about me before
And I begged you, baby, as you walked out the door

Please don't play my song for somebody else
It's so beautiful, let me keep it for myself
Please don't change the chorus and put in another man's name
Please don't take my song away, oh baby
Please don't take my song away

Sittin' here in my lonely room with the radio on one afternoon
I heard a voice that made me shiver
Oh, no one could sing that way if they didn't mean just what they say
And my tears fell like a river

Sang, "Oh baby, I love you, I was such a fool not to stay
We may never see each other again
But I'll never take your song away, oh baby
I'll never take your song away, oh baby
I'll never take your song away"
