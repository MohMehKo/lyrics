Mm, yeah
If all you want's a good time baby 
There's a party down the street
If you're trying to fight an old flame
Well I can't take the heat
If you're looking for a game to play
Well I wish you luck
All I have to offer you is love 
If you only want a keeper darlin'
Well I don't hold your key
If you're searching for a savior better
Get down on your knees
If you're looking for the answers, well

Hell I don't know much
All I have to offer you is love 

Darling there's a whole lot of things 
I've found I just can't be
If you're looking for real love baby
I've got all that you'll ever need
It might be more than you're after
Or not nearly enough
All I have to offer you is love
