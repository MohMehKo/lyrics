The first time that I said let's start our family
He said, "Hon I've got the whole wide world to see
So come along and be this drifter's lady
The best next thing to love is bein' free"

And I said, "Don't you feel the need to have some kids and settle down?"
He said not while there's some places left to go, yeah
I'd like to love you in Alaska underneath the midnight sun
I said, "Makin' love don't always make love grow oh didn't you know"

Acapulco and the Mexicaly sunshine, Hawaii on a rooftop in the rain
Out of Rio De Janeiro on a tramp liner and just outside of Paris on a train
I said don't you feel the need to have some kids and settle down
He said not while there's some places left to go

I'd like to love you in the backseat of a taxi leavin' town
I said, "Makin' love don't always make love grow oh didn't you know
And one day walkin' on the beach of Monterey"
A little girl came up and took me by the hand

And said, "Mom is it okay if I go swimmin'?"
But when he saw her mistake he blushed and ran
He laughed and reached for me but I just stepped away
I fought away the tears and tried to smile

Suddenly I knew I'd wait for him no longer
Just as suddenly he changed his style
He said, "Don't you feel the need to have some kids and settle down?"
Someday everybody leads a home

Yes, I'm finally learnin' love is more than just a runnin' round
But makin' love is hard to do alone
I said, "Don't you feel the need to have some kids and settle down"
Babe, I'm gonna take it on my own

See I'm finally learnin' love is more than just a runnin' round
Why makin' love might even make love grow
Didn't you know didn't you know?
