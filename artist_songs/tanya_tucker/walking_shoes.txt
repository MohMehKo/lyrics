I'm gonna put on my walkin' shoes tonight
Well, I'm a-leavin' here
'Cause you don't treat me right
All ya do is make me cry
So now I'm a-gonna say goodbye
I'm gonna put on my walkin' shoes tonight

Ya, I'll be wearin' my old travelin' hat
Now, baby, what do you think of that
'Cause all ya do is treat me wrong
So, honey, I'll be good and gone
I'll be wearin' my old travelin' hat

I'm the best thing, baby that you ever had
When ya find that out
You're gonna feel so bad
You'll beg me, please
Come back home to you
But it's too late
I'm puttin' on my walkin' shoes

Walk on

But I'll be wearin my it's all over coat
And I ain't even leavin' you a note
All ya do is cause me pain
And I ain't commin' back again
I'll be wearin' my it's all over coat

I'm gonna put on my walkin' shoes tonight
Well, I'm a-leavin' here
'Cause you don't treat me right
All ya do is make me cry
So now I'm a-gonna say goodbye
I'm gonna put on my walkin' shoes tonight
I'm gonna put on my walkin' shoes tonight
Yeah I'm gonna put on my walkin' shoes tonight
