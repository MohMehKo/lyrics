[guitar]
You're my soul song my everything-that-I-do song
My pick-me-up-when-I'm-blue song that's why I sing all the time
You're my soul song and that's why I call you my solid-gold song
Nothin' in the world could ever go wrong as long as you are mine

Never in the world have I seen anybody like you in all my time
You give me a feel good feelin' through and through and it's so fine
I'm up with the sun cause I don't wanna waste it
I love you so much I can almost taste it
I can sit still when I look up and see you comin' I start hummin' hmm
You're my soul song my keep-me-safe-from-all-harm song
My shelter-from-all-storm song that's why I sing all the time
You're my soul song my keep-me-warm-when-I'm-cold song
Nothin' in the world could ever go wrong as long as you are mine
You're my soul song...
