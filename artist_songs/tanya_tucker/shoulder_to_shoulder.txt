Picture you and I
Twenty years gone by
Looking back on time together
It’s not that far away
It’ll be yesterday
Before you turn and know it
So come along 
And take my hand
And hold on tight 
We’ll make it right
Sharing all the joys and sorrows
Together you and I
As we grow older
Shoulder to shoulder

Picture me and you 
Having made it through
Our separate lives together
It isn’t easy to do
But we can do it as two
Arm in arm 
We’ll face tomorrow
So come along 
And take my hand
Baby hold on tight
We’ll make it right
Sharing all the joys and sorrows
Together you and I
As we grow older
Shoulder to shoulder

The years ahead will find us
Together you and I
And we’ll grow older
Shoulder to shoulder

Sharing all the joys and sorrows
Together you and I
And we’ll grow older
Shoulder to shoulder
Shoulder to shoulder
Shoulder to shoulder
