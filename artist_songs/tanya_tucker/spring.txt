In a broken down apartment house
Lay a woman in labor
She said by the grace of God I'll have this child
And the help of a neighbor
At six o'clock the sun was rising
On upon the world
At seven forty five
The neighbor smiled and sayed
You've got a beautiful baby girl

She named her Spring
Winter's been a long time passin
She named her Spring
And though she's never been wed
She held her newborn child and said
Spring, I've waited a long, long time for you

In a broked down apartment house
Lay a woman dying
And by her side a little six year old girl
Who was softly crying
Momma don't go away 
And leave me all alone
Momma said to the welfare lady
Find my child a good home

I'll miss my Spring
Winter's been a long time passing
I'll miss you Spring
The angels carried her away
The welfare lady knelt to pray
Spring, she'll be a long time gone from you 

In a beautiful church out side of town
Stands a woman smiling
On her hand is a wedding band 
Of fashionable stylin
All the years in the orphan's home
He shared with you 
And now you hopes and childhood dreams
Have all come true

He loves his Spring
Winter's been a long time passing
He loves you Spring
He promised you today 
He'll never ever go away 
Spring, he's waited a long, long time for you
A long, long time for you
