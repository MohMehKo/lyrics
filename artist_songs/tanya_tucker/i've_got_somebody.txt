Everybody take a big long listen I've got somebody to love
Everybody take a big long listen cause I've got somebody to love
I used to worry bout tomorrow but tomorrow never came
Somebody with a crystal ball said you'll never be happy at all
Well that's one point for me and none for the ball
I've got somebody to love I've got somebody to take care of
I've got somebody to love
Everybody take a big long listen I've got somebody to love

I used to comb my hair for hours tryin' to make it look just right
I used to make fancy plans just to find someone and have a one night stand
Well that's all over now and here's the reason why
I've got somebody to love...
I've got somebody to love...
I've got somebody to love...
