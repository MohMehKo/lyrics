I never thought the time would come,
When I would want to have someone
To take your place, and love me while your gone.
I promised I would stay with you,
And that's just what I want to do,
But a woman can't spend this much time alone.

There'll always be just one more hill,
You'll have to climb, I know you will.
And I would never try, to change your way.
But just this once, lets think of me,
Now try to listen closely,
There's something on my mind of got to say.

While you're out there riding rainbows,
I get awful lonely on the ground.
So I was thinking, maybe, 
We could have a little baby,
That I could love, when you're not around,
Not around.

Sometimes my hearts an empty place,
And I need love to fill that space.
Those lonely nights, a smile could get me through.
Each time I'd see that silly grin
And smaller image of your chin,
I'd be content to hold a part of you.

While you're out there riding rainbows,
I get awful lonely on the ground.
So I was thinking, maybe, 
We could have a little baby,
That I could love, when you're not around,
Not around.
