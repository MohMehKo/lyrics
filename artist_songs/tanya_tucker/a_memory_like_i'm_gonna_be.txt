I can hear you smilin' on the 'phone
Bet you thought that I'd be cryin'
Go on, tell yourself I done you wrong
But we both know you'd be lyin'

We don't have to have a reason
If your heart is set on leavin'
To remember on some rainy day
A little simple word or thought

Or a birthday card, I bought
Just surrender, 'cause you can't get away
You never can be free
From a memory like I'm gonna be

That greener grass you think you see
Hah, is just a high-heeled illusion
Better count the cost of bein' free
Is it worth all that you're losin'?

It may be over, but it's not ending
'Cause there's one thing you're forgetting
An' you'll remember on some rainy day
The little things we used to do

Like that night in Baton Rouge
Just surrender, 'cause you can't get away
You never can be free
From a memory like I'm gonna be

When it all comes back someday
You'll be surprised on some lonely night
When you close your eyes

Just surrender, 'cause you can't get away
You never can be free
From a memory like I'm gonna be
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

(From a memory)
Just surrender, 'cause you can't get away
You never can be free
From a memory like I'm gonna be
