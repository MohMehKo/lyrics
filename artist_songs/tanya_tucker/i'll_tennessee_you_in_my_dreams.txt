I was on the telephone
It's time to hang up
But I can't bring my self
To say goodnight

This empty place inside my heart
Imagine that your miles apart
Oh darlin'
How I long to hold you tight

We both know it's too late
Travel down
There is just one way
I can be with you tonight

I Tennessee you in my dreams
Close my eyes and take away
This distance in between

Just knowing that you love me
Gives my spirit wings tonight
I'll Tennessee you in my dreams
