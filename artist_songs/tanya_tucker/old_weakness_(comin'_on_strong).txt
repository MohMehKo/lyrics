Two in the morning, too hot to sleep 
Tossin' and turnin' and twistin' the sheets 
I feel an old weakness comin' on strong 
Window wide open in the back bedroom 
Sweet smellin' honeysuckle in full bloom 
I feel an old weakness comin' on strong 
Feel like I'm runnin' real low on willpower 
Can't get you out of this heart of mine 
From the break of dawn 'til the midnight hour 
I keep fightin' to let you go 
But your love is beyond my control 
Took down that picture of you and me 
But every time I look up where it used to be 
I feel an old weakness comin' on strong 
Still got your number next to the phone 
Just when I believe I can leave it alone 
I feel an old weakness comin' on strong 
Feel like I'm runnin' real low on willpower 
Can't get you out of this heart of mine 
From the break of dawn 'til the midnight hour 
I keep fightin' to let you go 
But your love is beyond my control 
I feel an old weakness comin' on strong 
I feel an old weakness comin' on strong
