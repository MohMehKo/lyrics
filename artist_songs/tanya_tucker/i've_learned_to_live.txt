Like a child lost in the wilderness
I knew not where to go
Surrounded by the emptiness
Of a love that left me cold
I stumbled through that darkness
Of nights that have no stars
And days that have no sunshine
To warm my naked heart
Like a bird in flight brought down by stones
From an unknown assailant's sling
A stranger took you from my arms
And I lost everything
In days to come I nearly ran
Â 
Out of ways to stay alive
But through it all I never lost
The will to survive (and)

I'm not over you and I doubt that I'll ever be
But I've learned to live and you won't be the death of me, oh no
Yes I've learned to live and I'm doing well
But I'm not over you
Like a thief who takes just what he needs
And leaves the rest behind
You took the heart right out of me
And left me with my mind
And I've almost went out of it
At times believed I did
But gradually I learned you're someone
I'll have to live with ('cause)

I'm not over you and I doubt that I'll ever be
But I've learned to live and you won't be the death of me, oh no
Yes I've learned to live and I'm doing well
But I'm not over you

I'm not over you and I doubt that I'll ever be
But I've learned to live and you won't be the death of me, oh no
Yes I've learned to live and I'm doing well
But I'm not over you
