She tests every word like a fine wine 
She holds every thought like her last dime 
You can hear a pin drop from miles away 
You can hear a heart stop as plain as day 
We live in a land where silence is king 
Whispers have all disappeared 
Cry for an echo, you won't hear a thing 
Silence is king around here 
Silence is king around here 

Where are the dreams we were after 
Where is the joy and the laughter 
Were they only habits we were doomed to lose 
Or is destiny not ours to choose 

We live in a land where silence is king 
Whispers have all disappeared 
Cry for an echo, you won't hear a thing 
Silence is king around here 
Silence is king around here 
Desperate measures come from desperate times 
I don't regret what I have done 
If my actions made you speak your mind 
Angry words are better than none 

We live in a land where silence is king 
Whispers have all disappeared 
Cry for an echo, you won't hear a thing 
Silence is king around here 
Silence is king around here 

Silence is king around here
