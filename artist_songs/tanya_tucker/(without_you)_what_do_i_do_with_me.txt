What do I do, 
Now that I'm on my own?  
What we did together 
Beats anything I've done alone.  
Since the day that you left, 
I've been asking myself, 
Is this how it's gonna be?  
Without you, 
What do I do with me?

I don't want to go out, 
But I just can't stay home.  
I don't need company, 
But I sure don't want to be alone.  
And to tell myself that I'm doin' well, 
Is only makin' believe, 
Without you, 
What do I do with me?

Without you, 
Where do I go?  
Where do I turn? 
I'd sure like to know.  
What do I do, 
With all of our plans? 
And how do I spend 
All this time on my hands?

I've tried everything, 
I've been rackin' my brain. 
It must be as bad as it seems. 
Without you, 
What do I do with me? 

Without you, 
What do I do with me?
