I got a feelin' called the blues, oh Lord
Since my baby said goodbye
I don't know what I'm gonna do
All I do is sit and sigh, oh Lord

That last long day, you said goodbye
Oh Lord, I thought I would cry
He'd do me, he'd do you
He's got that kinda lovin'

Lord, I love to hear it when he calls me sweet mama
Such a beautiful dream
I hate to think it's all over
I've lost my heart it seems

I've grown so used to you somehow
But I'm nobody's sugar mama now
I'm so lonesome
I've got the lovesick blues

I'm in love, I'm in love with a good looking guy
That's what's the matter with me
I'm in love, I'm in love with a good looking guy
He don't care about me

I've tried and I've tried to keep him satisfied
But he just wouldn't stay
Now that he is leavin'
This is all I can say

I got a feelin' called the blues, oh Lord
Since my baby said goodbye
I don't know what I'm gonna do
All I do is sit and cry, oh Lord

That last long day, he said goodbye
Oh Lord, I thought I would die
He'd do me, he'd do you
He's got that kinda lovin'

Lord, I love to hear it when he calls me sweet mama
Such a beautiful dream
I hate to think it's all over
I've lost my heart it seems

I've grown so used to you somehow
But I'm nobody's sugar mama now
I'm so lonesome
I've got the lovesick blues
