Broken glass lies on the bedroom floor
A broken dream lies in my head
I was counting on a big surprise
But I got a big surprise instead

I didn't know people could change
So fast I didn't see the game you played
Now the morning finds me somewhere
In the past hanging on the promises we made

I know that life is just a big and restless ocean
With the wind and the water always changin' view
And I've always been the kind didn't count on much
But I thought I could depend on you, yeah

Weatherman says it's gonna rain today
And yes, I believe, he's right
My face is feeling just a little bit wet
With a big storm coming through tonight

I know that life is just a big and restless ocean
With the wind and the water always changin' view
And I've always been the kind didn't count on much
But I thought I could depend on you, yeah
