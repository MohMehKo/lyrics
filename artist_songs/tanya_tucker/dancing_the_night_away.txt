Standin' beside the ocean, lookin' across the water
Everything is beautiful here but I still don't feel like I ought ta
Things we wanted not so long ago well I've got 'em all now but I ain't got you no more
But I Remember the way you held me and all the sweet things we used say 
when we were two young lovers dancing the night away

I remember everything the way you wore your hair
The looks your body told me seem to float right through the air
I look so funny dancing but you loved me any how
I wish I could find somebody to love me like that now
But I remember the way you held me all the sweet things we used to say
When we were two young lovers dancing the night away
Let me see you dance, let me see you dance, oh baby let me see you dance

Standin' beside the ocean throwing rocks out in the bay
I should look for companionship but it just gets in my way
Lights are a glittering all along the shore
People dancin' there, I don't dance there any more
But I remember the way you held me and all the
Sweet thing we used say, when we were two young lovers dancin' the night away
Let me see you dance, let me see you dance, oh baby let me see you dance
