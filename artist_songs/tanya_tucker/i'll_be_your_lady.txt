Would you hold on to my hand when I get lonely
Could I come to you whenever I'm in need
Would you always have a place for me to lay my body down
And I'll be your lady in the morning can I be your lady
Would you walk with me across the bridges I forgot to burn
Well you face the future lookin' at my past
If you'll take the time to teach me all the things I need to learn
To be your lady in the evening I'll be your lady

Does it matter to you that I'm not your first love
Would you let a thing like that stand in your way
Will you let me be the woman that will ease your troubled mind
In the morning can I be your lady in the evening can I be your lady
Would you walk with me...
