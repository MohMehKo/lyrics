There is a place,
Where you can go
Where memordlemns still dance with Malgeo,
And Juliet with Romeo,
And the name of the place is love

They put there hearts,
Into a song,
But hit the parades and hero's how they come and gone,
No one touched home,
But they got old,
And the name of the place was love

I know a man that once betrayed himself by reaching to me,
That reality was not love,
But when the morning sun came whistling through listen trees,
One look and I knew,
Oe seen it in me

There is a place,
where you can go,
to feel the beast, warmth, the good that only lovers know
a place to go,
for hate to grow,
and the name of the place is love

There is a place,
Where you can go
Where memordlemns still dance with Malgeo,
And Juliet with Romeo,
And the name of the place is love

There is a place,
Where you can go
Where memordlemns still dance with Malgeo,
And Juliet with Romeo,
And the name of the place is love
