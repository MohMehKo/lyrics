Another love, just another love,
I don't wanna be just another love,
On your list of hearts, you've torn apart,
Then you've cast them aside.
Oh, can't you see, I don't wanna be,
I don't wanna be just another love in your life.

Well, I hear you've got a reputation in town,
For takin' all the young girls an' breakin' them down.
You're givin' me an invitation to stay,
But boy, you know, my heart says I oughtta be runnin' away.
Well, I've never been hurt, so I guess it's my turn,
I'm gonna see how strong I am.

Another love, just another love,
I don't wanna be just another love,
On your list of hearts, you've torn apart,
Then you've cast them aside.
Oh, can't you see, I don't wanna be,
I don't wanna be just another love in your life.

Well you've got some kind of magic in your big brown eyes,
Where'd you ever learn how to hypnotize?
Just like in romance books that I've read.
Drinkin' lemonade in the shade of my canopy bed.
Well, I've never been hurt, so I'll see what it's worth,
I'm gonna see how strong I am.

Another love, just another love,
I don't wanna be just another love,
On your list of hearts, you've torn apart,
Then you've cast them aside.
Oh, can't you see, I don't wanna be,
I don't wanna be just another love in your life.

Well, I've never been hurt, so I'll see what it's worth,
I'm gonna give your love a try.

Another love, just another love,
I don't wanna be just another love,
On your list of hearts, you've torn apart,
Then you've cast them aside.
Oh, can't you see, I don't wanna be,
Oh no, I don't wanna be,
I don't wanna be just another love in your life.
