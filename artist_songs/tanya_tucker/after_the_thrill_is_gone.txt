Same dancers in the same old shoes
Some habits that you just can't lose
It's no telling what a girl might use
After the thrill is gone

The flame rises but it soon descends
Empty pages and a frozen pen
You're not quite lovers and you're not quite friends
After the thrill is gone, oh
After the thrill is gone

What can you do when your dreams come true
And it's not quite like you planned?
What have you done to be losing the one
You held him so tight in your hand?

Well, time passes and you must move on
Half the distance takes you twice as long
So you keep on singing for the sake of the song
After the thrill is gone

You're afraid you might fall out of fashion
And you're feeling cold and small
Any kind of love without passion
Ain't no kind of lovin' at all

Same dancers in the same old shoes
You get too careful with the steps you choose
You don't care about winnin' but you don't wanna lose
After the thrill is gone, yeah
After the thrill is gone
