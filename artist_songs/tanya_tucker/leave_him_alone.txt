First you let him down then you come around
You build him up and get him up and turn his head around
You tear him down again and then you're gone leave him alone
Just about the time I've pushed you from his mind
You start to spin your web again and he falls for your lines
What have you got that keeps him hanging on oh leave him alone
I could make him happy from now on yeah
If only you would just leave him alone you don't love him
Now the way I do and God knows I do
All the way and every day ten times as much as you
Where you're concerned he can't tell right from wrong
Please leave him alone leave him alone leave him alone
