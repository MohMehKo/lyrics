With a 38 tucked out of sight
In a hopped up Ford on a Friday night
He was burnin' rubber, halfway to Waco
Destination- liquor store
And though he'd never robbed one before
He made up his mind to do it
Then he'd lay low.

Cause all he thought he needed was a little bit of cash to roll on
A good set of wheels and some gas to get him there
But all he really needed was something real to hold on to
All he really needed was somebody to care.

The edge of town was just in sight,
There she stood in his lights
With a sign in her hand that just read "San Antone"
He hit his brakes and he stopped that car
Said I hadn't planned to go that far
But I'll give you a lift to the far side of Waco.

She said, all I really need is a little bit of cash to roll on
A good timin' man with a little bit of time to spare
But what she really needed was something real to hold on to
All she really needed was somebody to care

(Somebody to care) they drove all night
(Somebody to care) yeah the miles rolled by
They talked and joked and laughed and cried
(Somebody to care) the sun was on the rise
(Somebody to care) when love shined in their lives
All they really needed was somebody to care

The liquor store went undisturbed
And nobody heard another word
From the kid with the hopped up Ford over by Waco
Rumor has it second hand
He's a happily married man
Runnin' his own garage down in San Antone

But all he thought he needed was a little bit of cash to role on
A good set of wheels and the gas to get him there
But what he really needed was something real to hold on to
All he really needed was somebody to care
