I seemed to know right from the start
Where I was goin' and how far
Like the river as she flows
I just always seemed to know

But you were born beneath the restless moon
Your heart still sings a wanderin' tune
Like the wind cannot be bound, oh
Walls would only tie you down

For awhile we traveled
In the same directions
But parted before the journey's end

I stayed within my boundaries
You sailed toward open skies
Like the river and the wind
Like the river and the wind

I always flowed between the lines
You followed roads that had no signs
The river knows where she belongs, yeah
The wind, he never finds a home

For awhile we traveled
In the same directions
But parted before the journey's end

I stayed within my boundaries
You sailed toward open skies
Like the river and the wind
Like the river and the wind

For awhile we traveled
In the same directions
But parted before the journey's end

I stayed within my boundaries
You sailed toward open skies
Like the river and the wind
Like the river and the wind
