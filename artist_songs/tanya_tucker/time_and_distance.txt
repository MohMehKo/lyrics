There is a place down in Tennessee I call home
There is someone down there I call my own
At least I think he is, Lord I pray he is
Least I could do is give him a call

Our love across the miles is holding strong
With every sign of going on and on
Least I hope it will, Lord I pray it will
But there is a danger still 'cuz we know

That time and distance will do their level best
To build a wall between us and put love to the test
The doubt and temptation step in and take control
Calling on suspicion to come and take it's toll
We can't lead love down the path of least resistance
We've got to hold our own against time and distance

They say out of sight out of mind
But I say love like ours can hold the line
I'm here to say they're wrong, I hope and pray they're wrong
And we can keep love strong 'cuz we know

That time and distance will do their level best
To build a wall between us and put love to the test
The doubt and temptation step in and take control
Calling on suspicion to come and take it's toll
We can't lead love down the path of least resistance
We've got to hold our own against time and distance
We've got to hold our own against time and distance
