You know I want you, baby
I can't help but feel this way
I got my eyes on your darlin'
Can't wait another day

Gonna wrap my arms around you
Squeeze you through the night
Love you till the morning
I wanna make you feel right

Well, now take my hand and show me
The things you do so well
You might just learn to love me
Only time will tell

I wanna kiss you all over
It's gonna feel oh so nice
You know it's hard on me, baby
Come on and make me feel right

Well, now take my hand and show me
The things you do so well
You might just learn to love me
Only time will tell

You know I want you baby
I can't help but feel this way
I got my eyes on your darlin'
Can't wait another day

Gonna wrap my arms around you
Squeeze you through the night
Love you till the morning
I wanna make you feel right
