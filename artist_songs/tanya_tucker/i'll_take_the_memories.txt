There's a moving van out in the drive
It's time to divide everything up
We've taken down the bed
Where so many nights we made love
We've gone through everything
And given back the rights
We once cherished
You can take the things you want
And leave the things you don't
But as for me

I'll take the memories
You can have the rest
I know we had some bad times
But our good times were the best
There's so many keepsakes
After' all we've been through
But I'll take the memories
If I can't have you

I don't know just what I'll do
I've been so used to loving you
Such a long time
Even though I'll try
There's no way that I'll get you off my mind
So while we're packing up our lives
And saying our goodbyes I want to tell you
You can take the things you want
And leave the things you want
And leave the things you don't
But as for me

I'll take the memories
You can have the rest
I know we had some bad times
But our good times were the best
There's so many keepsakes
After' all we've been through
But I'll take the memories
If I can't have you
