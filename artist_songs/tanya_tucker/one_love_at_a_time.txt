It makes me weak 
and in a hurry
All night long I lay 
and I worry
I'm so afraid I'm gonna talk in my sleep
Who do I love
Who am I using
Which one is which can get so confusing
I've got to chose one and set the other one free

One love at a time that's all I can handle
Burning both ends of the candle can drive you insane
With one love in your heart 
and one love on your mind
It can tear a girl apart 
I just need one love at a time

Ones got a birthday 
Its in December
Which ones in July
I can't remember
I get em mixed up
What am I gonna do
It keeps me uptight 
driving me crazy
They're both believing 
They're both my baby
Sometimes I wonder
Who's been playing with who

One love at a time that's all I can handle
Burning both ends of the candle can drive you insane
With one love in your heart 
and one love on your mind
It can tear a girl apart 
I just need one love at a time
Yes it can tear this girl apart
I just need one love at a time
