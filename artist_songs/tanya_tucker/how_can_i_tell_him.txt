He knows when I'm lonesome he's there when I'm sad
He's up in the good times he's down in the bad
Whenever I'm discouraged he knows just what to do that boy doesn't know about you
I can tell him my troubles makes 'em all seem right
I can make up excuses not to hold him at night
We can talk of tomorrow I tell him things I wanna do
But boy how can I tell him about you
How can I tell him about you boy please tell me what to do
Everything seems right whenever I'm with you
So boy won't you tell me how to tell him about you ah ah ooh

How can I tell him I don't miss him whenever I am away
How can I say it's you I think of every single night and day
But when is it easy tellin' someone we're through oh boy help me tell him about you
How can I tell him about you...
