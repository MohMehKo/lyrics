You give your hand to me and then you say hello
And I can hardly speak, my heart is beating so
Oh, anyone can tell you think you know me well
But you don't know me, you don't know me

You don't know the one who dreams of you at night
Who longs to kiss your lips and longs to hold you tight
To you I'm just a friend, that's all I've ever been
But you don't know me, no you don't know me

For I never knew the art of making love
Though my heart aches with love for you
Afraid and shy I've let my chance go by
A chance that you might love me too

You give your hand to me and then you say goodbye
I watch you walk away beside that lucky girl
And you'll never, never know the one who loves you so
No you don't know me, no you don't know me
You'll never, never know how much I love you so
'Cause you don't know me, you don't know me
