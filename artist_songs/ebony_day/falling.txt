Where did you come from, did you fall from a star
You're the light to my darkness
The hope when its hard
And I need to tell you that I might run away
Could you catch up with me
Sometimes I make that mistake

Na na na...

This doesn't happen, you caught me by surprise
I was looking for nothing
Then you caught my eye
I know that I can be guarded at time
But you made me see
My heart was locked from inside

I'm falling in love [x6]

I feel myself falling for the very first time
I can tell you my secrets
Got nothing to hide
No we're not perfect, but I love our mistakes
I'll give you my heart
Don't let it break

I'm falling in love [x7]

So here we are
You know the truth
Every single part of me loves every single part of you
Here we are
I've said it now
And I can't imagine feeling this for anybody else

I'm falling in love [x9]

My head is lost
In thoughts of us
I never want to escape
[x4]
