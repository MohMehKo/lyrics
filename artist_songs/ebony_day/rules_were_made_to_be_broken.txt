I don't normally do this
But the moment that you caught my eye
I couldn't just sit here
And let you pass me by
I don't kiss on the first date
If you want it then it's worth the wait
Maybe you can change my mind

Cause I can be too shy, but I don't wanna be too nice
Sometimes you do what feels right, feels right
I just wanna loose it, let loose and turn up the music
So come take my hand and lets do this, lets do this!

Cause rules were made to broken
And I don't care what time we leave the night's never over
If I've got you next to me
So come a bit closer
I don't really care you see I've already told ya
Rules were made to be, rules were made to be broken

You got me feeling wreckless
I wanna party till the sun comes up
And if the music keeps playing
There's no way we're gonna stop
Why are you hesitating?
I don't really wanna fall in love
I'm just looking for a little, fun

See I can be too shy, I don't wanna be too nice
Sometimes you do what feels right, that feels right

Cause rules were made to broken
And I don't care what time we leave the night's never over
If I've got you next to me
So come a bit closer
I don't really care you see I've already told ya
Rules were made to be, rules were made to be broken
Rules were made to be broken
Rules were made to be broken
I've already told ya
Rules were made to be, rules were made to be broken

This feels like the perfect night to brake the rules, let's break the rules
This feels like the perfect night just me and you, just me and you
This feels like the perfect night to brake the rules, let's break the rules
This feels like the perfect night just me and you, just me and you

Rules were made to be broken
And I don't care what time we leave the night's never over
If I've got you next to me
So come a bit closer
I don't really care you see I've already told ya
Rules were made to be, rules were made to be broken
(This feels like the perfect night to brake the rules, let's break the rules)
Rules were made to be broken
(This feels like the perfect night just me and you, just me and you)
Rules were made to be broken
(This feels like the perfect night to brake the rules, let's break the rules)
I've already told ya rules were made to be, rules were made to be broken
