You're the only one I dream of
Its the only way I see you these days 
My biggest fear when I wake up 
Is that I'll never see you again

I don't wanna wake up 
I don't wanna wake up 

I tried to put my heart on the line 
I guess that I just got there too late
The call I got replays in my mind
Those words I wish that I could forget

I don't wanna wake up, 
I don't wanna wake up. 

Help me stop, loving you, loving you
Cause I wish that I could bring you back and kiss you once more 
but you leaving would break me in two
Help me stop, loving you, loving you

365 days gone by
Lost track of all the tears that I've cried 
They said that it gets easy in time 
But I just wish that we could rewind 

I don't wanna wake up 
I don't wanna wake up

Help me stop, loving you, loving you
Cause I wish that I could bring you back and kiss you once more 
but you leaving would break me in two
Help me stop, loving you, loving you
I know you're looking down making sure that I'm fine 
But I wish I was up there with you
Help me stop loving you, loving you 

Cause I can't stop, loving you
