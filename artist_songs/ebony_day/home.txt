Oh when we wake up
The look that you give me is contagious
Like nothing else matters but this moment
That I will remember till I die
And when you kiss me
I don't know what happens but I can't breathe
It feels like I never saw life clearly
Until I looked into your eyes

I'm feeling like oh
I wanna make your heart a home
And we can live there till we're old
The stars align we here tonight tonight tonight

Oh are we crazy
To talk about our hopes for when we're thirty
Sometimes I wonder if you'll think of me
Cos right now you're never off my mind
And it's a mystery
How I ever lived without you baby
From the second I saw you serendipity
You were my wonderful surprise

I'm feeling like oh
I wanna make your heart a home
And we can live there till we're old
The stars align we here tonight tonight tonight
Can we go home
You'll always have a hand to hold
I'll be the shelter when its cold
You're the first and the last
And the worst is it hurts whenever I'm alone
So can we make your heart a home?

I wanna make your heart
I wanna make your heart a home

I wanna make you heart
I wanna make you heart a home

I'm feeling like oh
I wanna make your heart a home
And we can live there till we're old
The stars align we here tonight tonight tonight
Can we go home
You'll always have a hand to hold
I'll be the shelter when its cold
You're the first and the last
And the worst is it hurts whenever I'm alone
So can we make your heart a home?

I wanna make you heart...
