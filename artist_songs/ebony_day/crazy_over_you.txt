I don't know what's going on
How can it feels like you've been gone for so long
There is something very wrong
I get scared when I started thinking that you might be the one

I never felt like this before
I need you to know

I can't eat, can't sleep
When you near me, I can't breathe
You got me acting like a fool
I try to hate you
That's something I could never do
Boy, you're too good for me to lose
I'm crazy over you
I'm going crazy over you
I'm going crazy over you

This isn't how it's meant to be
(I can't believe) I'm chasing you when you should be chasing me
I try to keep it all inside
(Where do you go)
Where do you go when you've got nowhere to hide

I never felt like this before
I need you to know

I can't eat, can't sleep
When you near me, I can't breathe
You got me acting like a fool
I try to hate you
That's something I could never do
Boy, you're too good for me to lose
I'm crazy over you
I'm going crazy over you
I'm going crazy over you

Maybe, I'm crazy
Crazy over you
You got a secret
You crazy for me too
I can feel like when we kiss
I can taste it on your lips
So what if we're crazy?

I can't eat, can't sleep
When you near me, I can't breathe
You got me acting like a fool
I try to hate you
That's something I could never do
Boy, you're too good for me to lose
I'm crazy over you

I can't eat, can't sleep
When you near me, I can't breathe
You got me acting like a fool
I try to hate you
That's something I could never do
Boy, you're too good for me to lose
I'm crazy over you
Maybe I'm crazy
Maybe I'm crazy over you
I know your crazy for me too
I'm going crazy over you
I'm going crazy over you
