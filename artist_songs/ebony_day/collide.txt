My hearts been wrong, so many times before
But still I stay, cause loneliness it hurts me more
And I don't know, if I will ever find true love
Its hard to say, cause that is what I'm most scared of

Every time I feel like I've found the one he lets me down
Thought that if I gave him a second chance he'd come around
Maybe I'm losing the game cause I play my cards wrong

I, I'm gonna get it right next time
I'm reading every warning sign
Knowing that the world ain't black and white
I'll search the sky
The universe until I find
The kind of love that makes me blind
I know there'll be a day our paths collide

There you are, standing in front of me
Is this real, or is it just a fantasy
I can tell, that you feel like your dreaming too
Ask our hearts, they fit to make the perfect two

Don't know what your doing to me but I've never felt like this, oh

And I, I'm gonna get it right this time
I'm reading every warning sign
Knowing that the world ain't black and white
I'll search the sky
The universe until I find
The kind of love that makes me blind
I know there'll be a day our paths collide

And I, I'm gonna get it right this time
I'm reading every warning sign
Knowing that the world ain't black and white
Search the sky
The universe until I find
The kind of love that makes me blind
I know there'll be a day our paths collide
Our paths collide
