Hey baby even though I hate ya!
I wanna love ya I want you!
And even though I can't forgive you
I really want ya I want you!
Tell me, tell me baby why can't you leave me?
Cause even though I shouldn't want it
I gotta have it I want you! Head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulders I should be wiser
And realize that I've got

One less problem without ya! I got!
One less problem without ya! I got!
One less problem without ya!
I got one less, one less problem
One less problem without ya I got!
One less problem without ya! I got!
One less problem without ya!
I got one less, one less problem

I know you're never gonna wake up
I gotta give up but it's you!
I know I shouldn't ever call back
Or let you come back but it's you!
Every time you touch me and say you love me
I get a little bit breathless I shouldn't
Want it but it's you! head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulders I should be wiser
And realize that I've got

One less problem without ya! I got!
One less problem without ya! I got!
One less problem without ya!
I got one less, one less problem
One less problem without ya I got!
One less problem without ya! I got!
One less problem without ya!
I got one less, one less problem
