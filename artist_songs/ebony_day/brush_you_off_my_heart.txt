What you calling me for
Saying you want me back
I don't know about that
No I don't know about that
Because you been gone for weeks now
And it doesn't even hurt that bad
Do I want you back, I don't think I want you back
Cause you blow hot and cold
And I never know which way to go
So now I'm leaving boy
I won't be a toy for you

Did you think I'd fall apart
Losing you would be that hard
Did you really think you'd leave me a scared
Well you didn't leave a mark
I'll brush you off my heart
I'll brush you off my heart

You did me a favour
When you went behind my back
Oh yeah, I know about that

You've always been a player
And this is just another example
His is a cold heart back

So nah it time to go
Don't worry I show my self the door
You can watch me leaving boy
I won't be a toy for you

Did you think id fall apart
Losing you would be that hard
Did you really think you'd leave me a scared
Well you didn't leave a mark

I'll brush you off my heart

Well it might have been fun
But the fun never lasts
Nah were nothing but dust
So I brush you off my heart
Well it might have been fun
But the fun never lasts
Nah were nothing but dust
So I brush you off my heart
