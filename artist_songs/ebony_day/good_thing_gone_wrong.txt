I come a little bit closer
That is something that you wanna say
What don't you tell me
How we gonna be together forever and always
There was a time when
I used to hang on every word you say
But now those days are gone
Do you know?
That I use to lay awake
Think about the promises you made
Or the love I gave
And all the trustive through away
So when you sleep at night
With who every you hold tight
Hope you dream above last kiss
Cause baby this is it!
We're taking, or leaving
Tomorrow, I'm leaving, it's over
And I know, never coming back
No
Cause I'm done, but leaving
And your lies must I've been dreaming
I say to long
This is just a good thing gone wrong... gone wrong
This is just a good thing gone wrong... gone wrong
This is just a good thing gone wrong... gone wrong
What you looking confusefu
That something you don't understand
Are you forgetting?
I know you better than the lindes on the back of my hand
Think I forgive you
Like you carry behind my back
Boy you must be made
Do you know?
That I use to lay awake
Think about the promises you made
Now everything we have
I'm giving it back
We're taking, or leaving
Tomorrow, I'm leaving, it's over
And I know, never coming back
No
Cause I'm done, but leaving
And your lies must I've been dreaming
I say to long
This is just a good thing gone wrong... gone wrong
This is just a good thing gone wrong... gone wrong
This is just a good thing gone wrong... gone wrong
So get above you knees
Cause bad boy don't cry
If you may no enough to cheat on me
Than you may not enough to say goodbye
I let you bring my heart, but this could lost
Don't you say that you want me back
I'm better than that
We're taking, or leaving
Tomorrow, I'm leaving, it's over
And I know, never coming back
No
Cause I'm done, but leaving
And your lies must I've been dreaming
I say to long
This is just a good thing gone wrong... gone wrong
This is just a good thing gone wrong... gone wrong
This is just a good thing gone wrong... gone wrong
