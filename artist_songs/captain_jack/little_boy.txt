(Dream on, my little boy
Dream on, my little boy
Dream on, my little boy
Go out and have some joy)

(Little boy
Dream on my, little boy
Dream on my, little boy
Go out and have some joy)

(Duu, dubibadadadaduu
Dabadideidada
Duu, dubibadadadaduu
Dabadideidada)

Dream on, dream on, make my day
You will find a better way
Dream on and you'll realize
That one day you'll pay the price

Keep on going 'till tomorrow
You will find there is no sorrow
Keep on dreaming of this toy
You can use my little boy

(Dream on, my little boy
Dream on, my little boy
Dream on, my little boy
Go out and have some joy)

(Little boy
Dream on my, little boy
Dream on my, little boy
Go out and have some joy)

Duu, dubibadadadaduu

I'm your Captain, not your toy
I am not your little boy
I can show you better day
If you do it on my way

I give orders that you follow
Come with me into tomorrow
I'm your Captain and your toy
You can use my little boy

(Dream on, my little boy
Dream on, my little boy
Dream on, my little boy
Go out and have some joy)

(Little boy
Dream on my, little boy
Dream on my, little boy
Go out and have some joy)

(Hey, little boy
Do you think you're mister Right?
Hahaha)

(A girl like me still wants to choose the man
The only one she wants to be
Realize reality
You're not mister Right)

(Running on that one way street alone
I'm waiting for a loving man to come
Looking for a love to stay
Listen what I gotta say)

(Dream on, my little boy
Dream on, my little boy
Dream on, my little boy
Go out and have some joy)

(Little boy
Dream on my, little boy
Dream on my, little boy
Go out and have some joy)

(Little boy
Dream on my, little boy
Dream on my, little boy
Go out and have some joy)

(Little boy
Dream on my, little boy
Dream on my, little boy
Go out and have some joy)
