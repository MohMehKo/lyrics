Follow me - like a shadow
Follow me - into the night
And always by my side
You share with me the night
Today you are my light, follow me

You're in my brain... Like a shadow
I go insane... Like a shadow
Right by my side, walk with the light
I go insane... Like a shadow!!!!

You leave to the mountain
No one keeps you back
Looking for the fountain
The shadow Captain Jack
I leave and you follow
You're all around
Alive with the light
Your oxygen is sound

Follow me - into the night
And always by my side
You share with me the night
Today you are my light

Follow me - into the night... Like a shadow
And let me be your guide... Like a shadow
You always be around
Your oxygen is sound, follow me

All night and day
You join my way
And when I'm gone your work is done
But here we stay

You leave to the mountain
No one keeps you back
Looking for the fountain
The shadow Captain Jack
I leave and you follow
You're all around
Alive with the light
Your oxygen is sound

Follow me - into the night
And always by my side
You share with me the night
Today you are my light

Follow me - into the night... Like a shadow
And let me be your guide... Like a shadow
You always be around
Your oxygen is sound, follow me

You need no time
You're always mine
No crime no fake, now it's too late
You're always mine

You leave to the mountain
No one keeps you back
Looking for the fountain
The shadow Captain Jack
I leave and you follow
You're all around
Alive with the night
Your oxygen is sound

Follow me - into the night
And always by my side
You share with me the night
Today you are my light

Follow me - into the night... Like a shadow
And let me be your guide... Like a shadow
You always be around
Your oxygen is sound, follow me
