(Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Are you ready for Captain Jack?)

(Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Are you ready for Captain Jack?)

Another one bites, another one bites
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites, another one bites
Another one bites the dust

Another one bites, another one bites
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites, another one bites
Another one bites the dust

Steve walks warily down the street
With his brim pulled way down low
There ain't no sound but the sound of his feet
Machine guns ready to go

Are you ready, are you ready for this
Are you hanging on the edge of your seat
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat, yeah

Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust

And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey, I'm gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust

Baby, you can put me down
Start kickin' asses all around
Baby, you can put me up
Baby, I'm stronger than you as I'm ready for you

Baby, you can put me down
Start kickin' asses all around
Baby, you can put me up
Baby, I'm stronger than you as I'm ready for you

How do you think I'm going to get along
Without you when you're gone?
You took me for everything that I had
And kicked me out on my own

Are you happy, are you satisfied?
How long can you stand the heat?
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat, look out!

Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust

And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey, I'm gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust

Baby, you can put me down
Start kickin' asses all around
Baby, you can put me up
Baby, I'm stronger than you as I'm ready for you

Baby, you can put me down
Start kickin' asses all around
Baby, you can put me up
Baby, I'm stronger than you as I'm ready for you

(Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Are you ready for Captain Jack?)

(Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Are you ready for Captain Jack?)

Another one bites, another one bites
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites, another one bites
Another one bites the dust

Another one bites, another one bites
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites, another one bites
Another one bites the dust
