No longer spend my time
I don't want you anymore
Why don't you just leave me alone
Set me free

Set me free
No longer spend my time
What you did is a crime
You set me free
I'm better every day
Now get out of my way

I don't want you anymore
Go on and walk on out that door
Stay off my life forever more
I don't need you anymore
And don't forget to close that door
Stay off my life forever more

Aaah, time to set me free
Aaah, time to set me free

Set me free
No longer spend my time
What you did is a crime
You set me free
I'm better every day
Now get out of my way
[x2]

You just keep me hanging on
But I can make it on my own
Get off my life forever more
You let lies go on and on
Why don't you just leave me alone
Get off my side forever more

Aaah, time to set me free
Aaah, time to set me free

Set me free
No longer spend my time
What you did is a crime
You set me free
I'm better every day
Now get out of my way
[x2]

I don't want you loving
I don't want you need
I don't want you loving
Why don't you set me free?

Set me free
No longer spend my time
What you did is a crime
You set me free
I'm better every day
Now get out of my way
[x2]
