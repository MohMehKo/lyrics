Feel the vibes from outside, touch the blaze of emotion
Feel it raise to your mind
Feel the vibes from outside, touch the blaze of emotion
Cause you're one of a kind
Woohoh a cosmic evolution's here tonight
Woohoh a cosmic evolution's in your life

Waves are flowing - Positions are uncertain
See the interference - Feel it next to your mind
Rays are approaching - Energy is increasing
Quantized absorption - Feel it next to your mind

The world is uncertain - Action ruled by chance
Try to feel control - You're one of a kind
Distance is connected - Faster than the light
Listen to the bell - You're one of a kind
