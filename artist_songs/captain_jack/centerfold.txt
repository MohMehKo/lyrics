Nah nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah

Nah nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah

Nah nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah

Does she walk?
Does she talk?
Does she come complete?
My only homeroom angel
Always pulled me from my seat
She was pure like snowflakes, no one could ever stain
The memory of my angel could never cause me pain
Years go by, I'm looking through a girlie magazine
And there's my homeroom angel
On the pages in between

[Chorus:]
My blood runs cold, my memory has just been sold
My angel is the centerfold
Angel is the centerfold
My blood runs cold, my memory has just been sold
Angel is the centerfold

Nah nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah

Nah nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah

Nah nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah

Slipped me notes, under the desk
While I was thinking about her dress
I was shy, I turned away, before she caught my eye
I was shakin' in my shoes
Whenever she flashed those baby blues
Something had a hold on me
When angel passed close by
Those soft fuzzy sweaters, too magical to touch
To see her in that negligee is really just too much

[Chorus]

My angel is the centerfold
