Sir, yes Sir! 
You've gonna move your ass to my command - Sir, yes Sir 
Or do you wanna feel my hand? - Sir, no Sir 

You soldiers love is muddy dirt - Yes Sir yes Sir 
Till every bone and muscle hurt - No Sir no Sir 
Move your ass to my command - Yes Sir yes Sir 
Or do you wanna feel my hand - No Sir no Sir 
This company wants to be the best - Yes Sir yes Sir 
Or are you less than all the rest - No Sir no Sir 
I'm tuff but deal with all aspects - Yes Sir yes Sir 
But when we're through you'll get a rest - Yo yo yes Sir 

Ejo zak zak zak Captain Jack is coming back 
Turn it up, turn it down, move it all around 
Pow wow tak tak tak come and fight for Captain Jack 
You say yes, you say no, just say yes to start the show 

Give me a hundred sit ups, fools - Yes Sir yes Sir 
You f**kers ain't that f**kin cool - No Sir no Sir 
For me you take off all your shirts - Yes Sir yes Sir 
Unless you want to eat some dirt - No Sir no Sir 
All of you get on the floor - Yes Sir yes Sir 

Or should I kick your ass some more - No Sir no Sir 
Scream and shout and call my name - Yes Sir yes Sir 
Or do you wanna feel the pain - Yo yo yes Sir
