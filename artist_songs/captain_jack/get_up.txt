Get up and live for your life
Get up and live for the moment
If we all do the jive
Then everything is all right

Get up and live for your life
Get up and use all your power
If we standup to fight
We'll make it all day and night

Get up, get up, get down
Shake it all around
Get up, get up, get down
Work it to the ground
Get up, get up, get down
Shake it all around
Get up, get up, get down
Work it to the ground
Let me hear you say
Uuuuh nananana

Don't stop, work with it
Don't stop, get it get it
Don't stop, work with it
Everybody, get it, get it
Don't stop, work with it
All the ladies, get it, get it
Don't stop, work with it
Let me hear you say
Uuuuh nananana
