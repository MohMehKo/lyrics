TOGETHER we will go our way,
TOGETHER we will leave some day
TOGETHER your hand in my hand,
TOGETHER we will make our plans
TOGETHER we will fly so high,
TOGETHER tell all our friends goodbye
TOGETHER we will start life new,
TOGETHER this is what we'll do

GO WEST life is peaceful there
GO WEST in the open air
GO WEST where the skies are blue
GO WEST this is what we're gonna do
(GO West, this is what we're gonna do, Go West)

TOGETHER we will love the beach,
TOGETHER we will learn and teach
TOGETHER change our pace of life,
TOGETHER we will work and strive
I LOVE YOU I know you love me
I WANT YOU how could I disagree?
SO THAT'S WHY I make no protest
WHEN YOU SAY you will do the rest

GO WEST life is peaceful there
GO WEST in the open air
GO WEST baby you and me
GO WEST this is our destiny
GO WEST sun in wintertime
GO WEST we will do just fine
GO WEST where the skies are blue
GO WEST this is what we're gonna do

There where the air is free
We'll be (WE'LL BE) what we want to be
Now if we make a stand
We'll find (WE'LL FIND) our promised land

I KNOW THAT there are many ways
TO LIVE THERE in the sun or shade
TOGETHER we will find a place
TO SETTLE where there's so much space
WITHOUT RUSH and the pace back east
THE HUSTLING rustling just to feed
I KNOW I'M ready to leave too
SO THAT'S WHAT we are gonna do
WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO IS...

GO WEST life is peaceful there
GO WEST in the open air
GO WEST where the skies are blue
GO WEST this is what we're gonna do

GO WEST life is peaceful there
GO WEST in the open air
GO WEST baby you and me
GO WEST this is our destiny
GO WEST sun in wintertime
GO WEST we will do just fine
GO WEST where the skies are blue
GO WEST this is what we're gonna do
