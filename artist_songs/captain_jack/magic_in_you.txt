The magic is in you

When it's dark - outside
Find my house - tonight
When it's cold - outside
Find me here - That's right

When you're down - and blue
Come to me - into the crew
Move on up - get on the floor
The magic in you - is the key to the door

One step back - two steps ahead
Two steps back - is driving you mad
Three steps back - two steps beyond
Don't hide away - come and get on the front yeah

WHOOHA, WHOAHO, the magic is in you
WHOOHA, WHOAHO, no matter what you do
WHOOHA, WHOAHO, and if you're feeling blue
WHOOHA, WHOAHO, the magic is in you

When you're sad - then cry
Free your soul - and fly
There's no shame - on you
Just be pure - and true

Luck and joy - in time
Comes to you - so fine
Move on up - get on the floor
The magic in you - is the key to the door - yeah

One step back...
