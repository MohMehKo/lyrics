I got to turn it up - I got to turn it up
You got to turn it up - You got to turn it up
We got to turn it up - We got to turn it up
They got to turn it up - They got to turn it up

Give me the power to make me lose control
Give me the hour - feel it in my soul
Give me the feeling - got to have it all
Give me the hour - give me the power

We've seen the moonlight - shining on our way
We've seen the room that keeps us here to stay
We've been the key to make a better day
Let's face the hour - turn the power

I got to turn it up - I got to turn it up
You got to turn it up - You got to turn it up
We got to turn it up - We got to turn it up
They got to turn it up - They got to turn it up 

Give me the light - I need to see it all
Give me the right - I want to break the wall
Give me the night - to make me lose control
Give me the hour - give me the power

I've seen the sea - that takes my breath away
I've seen the tree - with leaves of autumn grey
I've been so free - since nature crossed my way
This is the hour - turn the power

I got to turn it up - I got to turn it up
You got to turn it up - You got to turn it up
We got to turn it up - We got to turn it up
They got to turn it up - They got to turn it up
