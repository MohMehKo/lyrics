We're talking away 
I don't know what I'm to say 
I'll say it anyway 
Today's another day 
To find you shying away 
I'll be coming for our love 
OK? 

Take on me (Take on me) 
Take me on (Take on me) 
I'll be gone 
In a day or two&#133; 

So needless to say 
I'm odds and ends 

But that's me stumbling away 
Slowly learning that life is OK 
Say after me 
It's better not to be 
Safe than sorry 

Oh the things that you say 
Is it live or just to play 
My worries away 
You're all the things 
I've got to remember 
You're shying away 
I'll be coming for you anyway
