Are you ready?
Ready for the race?
Are you ready?

Oh, oh, oh, ejo,
Are you ready?

Oh, oh, oh, ejo,
Are you ready?

The wheels go round and round
You hear the scream - you hear the sound
You're fast - you're on the run
You give the best to be the one
Come on and join the journey
This is a journey into sound
As long the wheels are turning
The race is all around

Are you ready?
Ready for the race?
Are you ready?

Are you ready?
Ready for the race?
Are you ready?

Oh, oh, oh, ejo,
Are you ready?

Oh, oh, oh, ejo,
Are you ready?

Are you ready?
Ready for the race?
Are you ready?

Are you ready?
Ready for the race?
Are you ready?
