Only you-ooh, can make me feel so true
I'll never ever be so blue
As long as I have you

Only you-ooh, can make me feel so true
Whatever ever I can do, it's because of you
Only you-ooh, can make me feel so true
I'll never ever be so blue
As long as I have you

Ahhhhhhhh!
All the hootchie mamas throw your hands up (Hands up!)
All the hootchie mamas throw your hands up (Hands up!)
All the hootchie mamas throw your hands up (Hands up!)
Gotta let me hear ya say yeah! ("Yeah!")

You like me, I like you and so happy
That you're my boo
Would you like to join my crew?
Fly up high to the sky, so blue!

Only you-ooh, can make me feel so true
Whatever ever I can do, it's because of you
Only you-ooh, can make me feel so true
I'll never ever be so blue
As long as I have you
