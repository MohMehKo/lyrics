Soldier, soldier, don't look down
I'm here for you in every town
Soldier, soldier, don't look down
I'm here for you in every town

Mama told Mary not to go downtown
Too many lovely boys hanging around
Mary didn't listen, she went away
There she met a boy who took her away

Mmm, soldier, soldier, don't look down
I'm here for you in every town

(Soldier, soldier, don't look down) (Soldier, soldier, don't look down)
(There's no sixpack on the ground) (There's no sixpack on the ground)
(Soldier, soldier, don't look up) (Soldier, soldier, don't look up)
(There's no whore gonna pick you up) (There's no whore gonna pick you up)

Mama is worried and she gets real loud
'Cause soldiers are a dirty crowd
Don't be mad, I love him so
It's my life and I have to go

Soldier, soldier, don't look down
I'm here for you in every town

(Soldier, soldier, don't look down) (Soldier, soldier, don't look down)
(There's no sixpack on the ground) (There's no sixpack on the ground)
(Soldier, soldier, don't look up) (Soldier, soldier, don't look up)
(There's no whore gonna pick you up) (There's no whore gonna pick you up)

Three months later all was well
In my dreams I hear the wedding bells (Ding, dong, ding)
Sixth months later all was gone
We had a little son, we are having fun

Mama, don't think twice
Soldiers can be nice

Soldier, soldier, don't look down
I'm here for you in every town
