What goes around comes around - In your face
What goes around comes around - In this place
What goes around comes around - In the states
What goes around comes around!

Be what you want, baby be what you wanna be
I like what you do to me
Be what you want, baby be what you want to be
Put me to xtc
Just take a look at me, and if you wanna
Be what you want, baby be what you want to be
You put me to xtc
Be what you want to be
Say you'll be good to me

What goes around comes around - In your face
What goes around comes around - In this place
What goes around comes around - In the states
What goes around comes around!

Stay in my heart, baby stay in my heart tonight
You know it will be alright
Pray for my love, baby pray for my love tonight
Stay and just hold me tight
Make it all through the night, and if you wanna
Stay in my heart, baby stay in my heart tonight
You know it will be alright
Just stay and hold me tight
I'll be your love tonight
