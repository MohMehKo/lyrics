Hey 1-2-3, everybody feel free
Hey 4-5-6, move on straight to the mix
Hey 7-8-9, let's do it one more time
Hey ready-set-go, the beat will never let you go
Come with me, I will show you a place to be
Come right now, no matter if you don't know how
Hey 1-2-3, com'on and get what you see
Hey 4-5-6, rock you straight to the kicks
Hey 7-8-9, let's do it one more time
Hey ready-set-go, we will never let you go
Come with me, I will show you a place to be
Come right now, no matter if you don't know how

One by one, baby come on
If we are two of two, our dreams they come true
Show me 4 on the floor, that's what we're waiting for
And if you dance now with me, everybody feel free
Hey you, tell me what you want to
Tell me what you need to,
Tell me where you got to, all together
Every everybody, tonight we start the party, all together

Move on up, move on up to the top
Fell the groove is hot, let the beat never stop
Shout baby shout, when you here the music loud
Give me five, and don't pay the price
Hey you, tell me what you want to
Tell me what you need to,
Tell me where you got to, all together
Every everybody, tonight we start the party, all together
