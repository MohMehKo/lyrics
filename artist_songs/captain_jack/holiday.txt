If we took a holiday
Took some time to celebrate
Just one day out of life, holiday
It would be, it would be so nice

Everybody spread the word
We're gonna have a celebration
All across the world
In every nation, yeah

It's time for the good times
Forget about the bad times, uuh yeah
One day to come together
To release all the pressure
We need a holiday

Holiday, celebrate
Holiday, celebrate

Do we need a holiday? Uuh yeah, uuh yeah
Is it time to celebrate? Uuh yeah, uuh yeah
Now let me hear you crazy boys! Uuh-let's go
And all the girls let's make some noise! Uuh-let's go

Put your hands up in the air
And you can feel it everywhere
It's partytime we never stop
Come join the revolution club

Holiday, celebrate
Holiday, celebrate

You can turn this world around
And bring back all of those happy days
Would you travel down
It's time to celebrate

Let love shine
And we will find
A way to come together,
And to make things better
We need a holiday

Holiday, celebrate
Holiday, celebrate

Do we need a holiday? Uuh yeah, uuh yeah
Is it time to celebrate? Uuh yeah, uuh yeah
Now let me hear you crazy boys! Uuh-let's go
And all the girls let's make some noise! Uuh-let's go

Put your hands up in the air
And you can feel it everywhere
It's partytime we never stop
Come join the revolution club
