I wanna know why lovers turn away from love
I wanna know, baby, why you had to go
Oh why? You let my heart break
Now it's too late there's nothing else to say
I'm telling you goodbye

Seven days, seven nights, seven years that you're by my side
A thousand stars shine along our way
My love please stay

Hey girl, come on
This is not the right time
You gotta keep going on
Believe and try
To be confident
Why don't you give him a smile
Your love - so strong
It's only misunderstanding
You're only hanging on the phone
He only loves you let your love shine

Seven days, seven nights, seven years that you're by my side
Endless times you have touched my heart
It's tearing me apart
Seven days, seven nights
Seven years that you're hold me tight
A thousand stars shine along our way
My love please stay

More time - you need more time
Remember the days - when everything went fine
Him and you - close to each other
The friendship crew - and you became lovers
Hey listen - you want him back?
Start to fight for love - and stop to attack
And I promise - when you're patient, you spend
Seven days and nights in love my friends

I wanna know
Why memories start to fade away
I wanna know
I carry on the heavy weight
Mmh why? - My heart's just dying
Now I'm crying
I want you back for good
Please don't bring me down

Seven days, seven nights, seven years that you're by my side
Endless times you have touched my heart
It's tearing me apart
Seven days, seven nights
Seven years that you're hold me tight
A thousand stars shine along our way
My love please stay
