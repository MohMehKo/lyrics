[Verse 1:]
All of my life and all of my days
I'll give You the praise
For You've done so much for me
And I adore Thee

[Verse 2:]
You taught me how to love my enemies
In the midst of the storm I'll be strong
That's why my spirit will always be free
For I adore Thee

[Chorus:]
I worship Thee
I worship Thee
I worship Thee and I adore Thee

[Vamp:]
I'll give You the honor
I'll give You the praise
Forever and ever
I'll lift up Your name
