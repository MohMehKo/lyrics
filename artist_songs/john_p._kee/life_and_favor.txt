[Speaker:]
Some people have seen where God has brought you from
They really don’t understand it
They don’t know your story.

[Choir Verse:]
You don’t know my story
You don’t know the things that I’ve come through
You cannot imagine 
The pain the trials I’ve had to endure

You don’t know my story
You don’t know the day He set me free 
You cannot imagine
The strongholds and the walls that severed me

[Reprise]
In all God has been faithful to me
He promised He would never leave me
My story proves that God can use me
Deliverance is my testimony
You don’t know -- my story!
You don’t know -- my story.

[Lead 1:]
You don’t know my story
The anguish and the guilt that consume me
Grateful I can tell it
For no more shall the shackles condemn me

You don’t know my story
For if you did you would lift up your hands
So just let me tell you
By faith you may as well break out and dance.

[Reprise]
In all God has been faithful to me
He promised He would never leave me
My story proves that God can use me
Deliverance is my testimony

You don’t know -- my story! 
You don’t know -- my story.

[Bridge:]
Through my testimony that the blood of the lamb – 
Delivered again
Now I have a testimony; 
Favor’s upon me

Grace and Mercy, Love and Peace 
Abound
All in you I’ve found
A lord that will not ever leave me
(He wont forsake me.)

You don’t know my story --

[Vamp:]
I’m delivered, here’s my story
Life and Favor upon me He brought me out
You don’t know it, let me tell it
Life and favor upon me He brought me out

God of Mercy He who loves me
Life and favor upon me He brought me out
Oh how wondrous is my story
Life and favor He brought me out

Can’t imagine what I’ve gone through
Life and favor upon me He brought me out
Can’t imagine what I’ve gone through
Can’t imagine.
