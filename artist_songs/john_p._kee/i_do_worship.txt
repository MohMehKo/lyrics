I do worship
I do worship
I do worship You [repeat]

For Your goodness and Your glory
For the joy inside Your story
I do worship You

O how excellent
Is Your presence
We will bless Your Name

For Your goodness and Your glory
For the joy inside Your story
For the peace You gave to me
For the day You set me, set me free
For Your goodness and Your glory
For the joy inside Your story
I do worship You

For Your goodness
And Your glory
For Your goodness
Hallelu Hallelu Hallelujah

He?s so faithful
He?s so faithful
He?s so faithful
Yes He is, Yes He is, Yes He is, Yes

Lord I love You
Lord I love You
Lord I love You
Yes I do, Yes I do, Yes I do, Yes

Lord I love You
