That was me standing right by the door
That was me in the corner on the floor
That was me when you prayed and asked for more
Did you see me...
That was me when your body was in pain
That was me when you felt you were insane
That was me that brought you out of the rain 
Did you see me...
Though you may feel, in life you walk alone
In order to carry on
You need to see my face 
I'm not in your darkest place

You need to see me in saddest situation
See me in the trial of your temptation 
In my lowest state, the dark I'll illuminate
So you can see my face-everyday

That was me that caused the sun to shine
That was me when you were losing your mind 
That was me that showed the rainbow as a sign 
Did you see me...
That was me that gave you a vision in your heart 
That was me that gave you faith enough to start
That was me that lit the candle in the dark 
Now Did you see me...
Though you may feel, in life you walk alone
In order to carry on
You have to see my face (my face)
I'm not in your darkest place

You need to see me in saddest situation
See me in the trial of your temptation 
If you pray by faith (pray by faith) 
I shall not delay (no I won't)
Then you shall see my face (you gotta see my face)
Oh yes

Yeah, yeah, yeah

So you can see my face... 

I need to see you in the saddest situation 
See you in the trial of my temptation
If I guild today (I will make a way yes I will)
I want to see your face (so you can see my face)
I wanna see ya
(see me and you finally)
I'll find you yes I will
Then you will see my, face.
