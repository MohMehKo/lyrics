So many things we don't know
Say it's hard to let go
We must put all our trust in You

You will do what You say
If we trust and obey, I know that
â€~Cause you have brought me through

My God will do what He wants to
Whenever He wants to, He is God

Zechariah spoke of You, it was clear, it was true
How personal he would claim his God
Matters not if you fail, I know that He will prevail
Because He sees, hears and knows my all

My God will do what He wants to
Whenever He wants to, He is God

Oh how David did agree in the Psalm 23
Called Him Shepherd over his life
Testimony I give, with the Shepherd I can live
God of Providence, You are my guide

My God can do what He wants to
Whenever He wants to, He is God
