It's in your name that all demons shall fail
It's in your name that I heed to your call
It's in your name that all power is given
I have authority in your name

It's in your name that I shall walk the walk
It's in your name that I shall talk the talk
By your word I'm anointed and I'm called
I have authority in your name

It's in your name that I shall lift my hands
It's in your name that I will obey your command
It's in your name that by faith I shall stand
I have authority in your name

It's in your name that I shall reach the prize
It's in your name that I shall not compromise
And everything I decree shall be mine
I have authority in your name

It's in your name that I shall reach my goal
It's in your name that I shall win a soul
It's in your name that your word shall never wax cold
I have authority in your name

It's in your name we worship
In your name we praise
Lord today I worship you
I give you honor
I give you praise
It's in your name we worship
In your name we praise
