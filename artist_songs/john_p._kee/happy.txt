[Verse:]
So happy that You came into my life
When I needed someone to walk by my side,
And You opened up the door
That had been closed all of my life.

When I needed someone to rock me in their arms.
Loosed my spirit, opened up my heart,
I wanted to love like I'd never loved before.
I wanted to love, You allowed that opened door to freedom;
Who the Son sets free, is free indeed.

[Chorus:]
I can sing because I'm happy
(I can sing because I'm free)

Happy, through Jesus Christ I am happy.
Happy, through Jesus Christ I am happy.
Happy, through Jesus Christ I am happy.
Happy, through Jesus Christ I am happy.
Happy, through Jesus Christ I am happy.
Happy, through Jesus Christ I am,
I can sing because I'm happy
(I can sing because I'm free)
