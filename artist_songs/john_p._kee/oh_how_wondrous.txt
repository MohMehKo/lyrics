Oh how wondrous is the name of the Lord
how we worship
His name is to be adored
God our maker
endured pain guilt and strife
so that we might
access our eternal life

[repeat]

We offer sincere praise
we stand and bless your holy name
your blood has loosed all the chains
all men shall proclaim
there's power in your name

How we love you
your name is so sweet
your joy is complete 
we love you
we reverence your face 
in this holy place

Jehovah Jireh
He who provides for us all
my strong tower
Who hears and moves when we call
Elohim he created us from the dust
Jehovah Shammah
the Lord is present with us

We offer sincere praise
we stand and bless your holy name
your blood has loosed all the chains
all men shall proclaim
there's power in your name

We offer sincere praise
we stand and bless your holy name
your blood has loosed all the chains
all men shall proclaim
there's power in your name

How we love you
your name is so sweet
your joy is complete 
we love you
we reverence your face 
in this holy place

[repeat x2]

Oh how wondrous is the name of the Lord

[repeat x14]
