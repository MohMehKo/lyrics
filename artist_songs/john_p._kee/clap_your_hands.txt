When I think of His mercy and His kindness
All I wanna do is thank Him
From the rising of the sun
To the going down of the same
O clap your hands and say Amen

Zion let us praise
His holy and righteous name
Worthy lamb is he
Oh, oh let us all proclaim
He shall come again
And I shall be ready, oh
Clap your hands and say Amen

Clap your hands
O clap your hands
Clap your hands
O clap your hands

[Altos:] If you've been delivered
[Soprano:] Clap your hands.
O clap your hands

If you've been delivered
Clap your hands
Sho'nuff delivered
Praise his name

Clap your hands
O clap your hands
Clap your hands
O clap your hands

Clap your hands!
