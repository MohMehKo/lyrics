[Verse 1:]
We made it through hard trials,
We made it through the pain.
Often criticized, we never gave up,
lied on, we remained strong;
my life is in God's hands.

[Verse 2:]
Many tire along the way,
they had no vision, no desire to stay.
Felt it would crumble if they were gone,
we kept praying, we stood strong;
my life is in God's hands.

[Vamp 1:]
He upholdeth me, He holds me up.
He upholdeth me with His right hand.

[Vamp 2:]
Stand, He holds me up.
Stand, with His right hand.

[Vamp 3:]
Yes, yes, yes,
with His right hand.

[Ending:]
My life is in Your hands.
