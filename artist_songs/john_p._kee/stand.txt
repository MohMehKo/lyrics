I decided to take a stand
Not knowing I'll lose my best friend
But I'd rather; I'd rather live right
Than in hell lift up my eyes
All of Gods children just stand
Tell somebody say you stand
Eh Lord eh

Stand for Holiness
Stand for Righteousness
And be counted among them
That shall reign with Him
You stand
When friends are gone
Stand when you're all alone
And believe He shall receive His own

I decided to take a stand
Not believing I'd lose
Some of my friends
I would rather; I'd rather live right
Than in hell lift up my eyes.
All of Gods children just stand
Stand, everybody say you stand

Stand for Holiness
Stand for Righteousness
And be counted among them
That shall reign with Him
You stand
When friends are gone
Stand when you're all alone
And believe He shall receive His own

Stand for Holiness
Stand for Righteousness
And be counted among them
I'm gonna be in the number
You stand
When friends are gone
Stand when you're all alone
And believe He shall receive His own

Stand for Holiness
Stand for Righteousness
And be counted among them
That shall reign with Him 
You stand
When friends are gone
Stand when you're all alone
And believe He shall receive His own

Everybody stand up and say
Stand for Holiness
Stand for Righteousness
And be counted among them
That shall reign with Him
You stand
When friends are gone
Stand when you're all alone
And believe He shall receive
And believe He shall receive
And believe He shall receive His own

(People say) stand (help me out)
You gonna do it
You gonna do, gonna do it no
(Point to somebody say) you stand
