[Verse 1:]
I've been deceived for the very last time,
My eyes are open and I've made up mind
That I'll have patience in whatever I go through,
I am encouraged in You.

[Verse 2:]
So many times my tears were ignored,
Before my real relationship with the Lord.
Now I hold my head up for I've been set free,
Nothing can discourage me.

They that wait on Him shall regain strength,
I encourage you in the Lord.

[Chorus:]
Be encouraged, hold your head up.
Be encouraged, don't you give up.
Be encouraged, hold your head up high.

[Repeat Verse 2:]

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
If you stand and never faint,
Please take heed to what I say.

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Vamp 1:]
Get it up, get it up, get it up.
Get it up, get it up, get it up.

[Vamp 2:]
Hold your head up, it's not over for you;
Everything He promised, I know He'll do.

[Vamp 3:]
Hold your head up.

[Repeat Chorus:]
