[Chorus 1:]
Oh lord I've come to receive my blessing,
Patiently awaiting for the harvest is nigh.
I got that Hebrews 11:1,
Faith to know my blessing shall come;
It's mine, all mine,
It's harvest time.

[Verse 1:]
I'm standing (I believe),
On Your promise (I believe),
I'm existing (I believe),
On Your word (I believe).

Everything (I believe),
That I speak (I believe),
I believe (I believe),
You'll give it to me (I believe).

Now it's the Father's (I believe),
Real good pleasure (I believe),
That the Kingdom (I believe),
Get in line (I believe);
(It's mine, all mine),
(It's harvest time).

[Repeat Chorus 1:]

[Verse 2:]
I'm believe in Him (I believe),
For great things (I believe),
He promised me (I believe),
A long time ago (I believe).

I know (I believe),
I'm gonna get it (I believe),
'cause the Bible (I believe),
Tells me so (I believe).

Now it's the Father's (I believe),
Real good pleasure (I believe),
That the Kingdom (I believe),
Get in line (I believe);
(It's mine, all mine),
(It's harvest time).

[Chorus 2:]
Oh lord I've come to receive my blessing,
Patiently awaiting for the harvest is nigh.
I got that Hebrews 11:1,
Faith to know my blessing shall come;
It's mine, all mine, anything I need,
It's mine, all mine, it's harvest time.

[Vamp 1:]
My blessing,
My blessing's on the way.
[Repeat as desired:]

It's mine, all mine, anything I need,
It's mine, all mine, it's harvest time.

[Vamp 2:]
There's a blessing in store for me.
There's a blessing in store for me.

[Repeat Vamp 1:]

[Vamp 3:]
I'm gonna get mine,
Gonna get it, get it,
Gonna get mine.

[Repeat Vamp 2:]
