I've been through so many valleys
I've felt the strain of strife
Trying to overtake my life

But you were there to comfort me
And give me life renewed
He's able to see me through

Lord, Your abilities strengthens my faith and comforts me
Most of all, The Lord won't leave me
Most of all, He's able to keep me
Most of all, He's able to see me through

This year has been a very trying one
In August I lost my dad
One of the very best friends I had

But during that time You were there
To exemplify Your love and care
He's able to see me through

Whatever your trials may be
You've conquered adversity
Jesus died that we might
Share abundant life

He's able, Jesus is able
He's able, Jesus is able
He's able, Jesus is able
He's able, Jesus is able

He's able, Jesus is able
He's able, Jesus is able
He's able to see you through

He's able to see, yes he is
He's able to see, yes
He's able to see me through
Hallelujah
