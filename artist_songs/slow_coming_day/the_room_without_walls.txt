All your work...
All your work...
Has been for nothing.
All this time...
All this time...
That you wasted.
Watching out my window,
Snowflakes are falling,
Falling down.
Don't tell me I'm wasting,
Wasting away.
Don't tell me I'm wasting,
Wasting away.
All this time,
All this time,
That you wasted.
