I woke up this morning and I forgot you were gone.
I imagined all this time that you were here with me.
Forgot all the pain and sorrow I have felt so many years.
Forgot about that day and all my wasted tears.
When can I see...see you again?
When can I see...see you again?
I woke up this morning and I realized you were gone.
I remembered your ashes as they were thrown to the ground.
I remember that day when a part of me died.
I will never let you go no matter how hard I try.
When can I see...see you again?
When can I see...see you again?
