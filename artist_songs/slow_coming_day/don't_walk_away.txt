Way to go this time.
You've done so good for yourself.
And do you realize
There's consequences for
Every single move that you made wrong
And self acceptance comes from forgiveness.

How long will you run from yourself
And keep pretending that everything
Will just work out like you planned?
Just walk away.
Simply betray
Everything that's been placed in your heart,
Deep within your heart.

And you're waking up
In the middle of the night,
Sweatpouring down your face.
And still you wonder why
Images ring true,
Strike like bullets to the flesh.
And shaking with fear
You don't know what to do.
You don't know what to do.

How long will you run from yourself
And keep pretending that everything will just work out like you planned?
Just walk away.
Simply betray
Everything that's been placed within your heart,
Deep within your heart.

Don't walk away from me.
There's so much more to see.
Don't walk away from me.
There's so much more to see.
Don't tell me I'm wrong this time.
Can't you see I'm stronger than that?
