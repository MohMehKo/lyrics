And he finds himself
Waking up in a different bed,
In a different bed.
With a crook in his neck
And sleep in his eyes,
He turns to sigh,
He turns to sigh.
He's running too fast
To know how far
He slid away,
He slid away.
It's one step over the ledge,
You're fading fast into dead ends
And tell me why you stand with
Tight wire and cold hands.
Her open wound,
Their bodies lie all alone,
They lie all alone tonight.
The sharp knife
It cuts through,
Deep through the skin,
Deep through her skin.
She's running too fast
To know how far
She slid away,
She slid away.
It's one step over the ledge,
You're fading fast into dead ends
And tell me why you stand
With tight wire and cold hands.
