You're stealing my heart again
Through every single move you make
And conquer over me with every glance of your blue eyes.
I am helpless for you.
I am helpless for you.
Hear the sound of my heart
Pounding in my chest for you.
I am helpless for you.
I am helpless for you.
I miss you more,
More than words could describe.
I miss you more,
More than words could describe.
