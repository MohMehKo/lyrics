Like a record replaying in my mind,
The events of that day play back
In my head. And though,
Though six years have gone and passed me by,
I remember it like yesterday.
And only if I could turn back time and wish you,
Wish you back to life.
I'd be on my way.
And only if I could turn back time and wish you,
Wish you back to life.
I'd be on my way.
Looking through my eyes you will see what
It feels like to be in misery.
And though six years have gone and passed me by,
I remember it like yesterday, like yesterday.
And only if I could turn back time and wish you,
Wish you back to life.
I'd be on my way.
And only if I could turn back time and wish you,
Wish you back to life.
I'd be on my way.
Don't say goodbye.
