He takes the blame
For his family's pain.
"It's not your fault son,"
I hear them say.
And what does he have now
But broken dreams
And only promises
That they'll never keep.
Can't you see, this boy is me?
Can't you see, this boy is me?
The tension builds,
The hurting words,
The yelling voice,
The falling tear.
The tension builds,
The hurting words,
The yelling voice,
The falling tear.

And what does he have now
But broken dreams?
And there is no chance they will ever be together again.
Can't you see, this boy is me?
Can't you see, this boy is me?
The tension builds,
The hurting words,
The yelling voice,
The falling tear.

The children are crying out,
"Who's to blame for this?".
The children are crying out,
"You're the one to blame."
