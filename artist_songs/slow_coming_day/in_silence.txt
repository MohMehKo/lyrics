Waiting in the silence with not a word to say.
A consequence of decisions gone astray.
Meaningless and empty is how it feels.
Continue to indulge in your selfish ideals.

Don't...don't wait around.
Don't...don't wait around 
To follow your dreams.

A teardrop falling but then wiped away.
The regret you held onto for another day.
Reality of this life will stare you in the face
And hold your secrets in a latch-box case.

Don't...don't wait around.
Don't...don't wait around
To follow your dreams.

And I've come this far and I'll stand my ground
No matter what they would say about me.
And I've come this far and I'll stand my ground
No matter what they would say about me.
And I've come this far and I've fallen down.
And I'm not getting up this time.
