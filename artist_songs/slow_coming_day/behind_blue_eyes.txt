Her bright blue eyes
Meeting with mine.
Her bright blue eyes
Meeting with mine
For the first time.

She mesmerizes all my thoughts.
She mesmerizes all my dreams.
Unaware of what I hold inside
And unaware of how I feel.
There's not a chance in the world.
There's not a chance in the world
That her lips would ever speak my name
Or her eyes look my way.

Don't turn your head or walk out the door.
I know I've never felt like this before.
I'm waiting around for your heart to mend.
I swear I didn't want this to end.
