Sit back and watch this dream
You call your life
Quickly pass you by
And know this was wasted time.
And take a look in the mirror
And tell me who have I become?
I know that I don't care.
I know that I don't care.

Recollect these thoughts
You hold inside this cage
And they'll come to find you out
And know this was wasted time.
And take a look in the mirror
And tell me who have I become?
I know that I don't care.
I know that I don't care.

And know that each lie
Will find you out.
