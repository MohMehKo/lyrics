I'm on the edge
With a feeling that I wasn't neglected
I would try to be the last person to prove you wrong
Now these people I call my friends are making no mistakes
And you'll be the next heart I break

And it's alright
For me to feel this way
And after all
We wouldn't stand for it
We wouldn't stand for it
[x2]

Well I've come to this conclusion
And I know it's been so long
Since I wonder why I stick around
If I am always wrong

And it's alright
For me to feel this way
And after all
We wouldn't stand for it
We wouldn't stand for it
[x2]

Break away
The situation's never seemed so clear
(Why you running away from me?)
(Why you running away from me?)
Break away
The situation's never seemed to
(Why you running away from me?)
To break away

And it's alright
For me to feel this way
And after all
We wouldn't stand for it
We wouldn't stand for it
[x2]
