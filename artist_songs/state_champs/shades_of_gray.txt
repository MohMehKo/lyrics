Back and forth we always take our time growing up, 
not knowing what's at stake before we change. 
So give me a chance and I'll take it, make it or break it. 
Time can only tell us who we are. 
So, can I please just have your name. 
So they say, there are shades of gray in a lifetime. 
If that is so, I'll let you know that I'm looking on the bright side. 
What's the point of being at this party? 
Hey girl! you're just another trend. 
Now you're all over the place. 
Let go, 'cuz I get along better with your best friend. 
I think you'll say that "this is all I stand for, so grow up and be a man!" 
I'll stay the same because I'm living it up now, 
day by day, so grow up while you still can. 
So they say, there are shades of gray in a lifetime. 
If that is so, I'll let you know that I'm looking on the bright side. 
What's the sense in being there for you for another night in an empty bedroom? 
What's the sense in being there for you to make it seem like I gave up my greed, 
when all along I had everything that I need. 
So they say, there are shades of gray in a lifetime. 
If that is so, I'll let you know that I'm looking on the bright side.
