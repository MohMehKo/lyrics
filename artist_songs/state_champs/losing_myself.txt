I said I'll always remember the wood grain beneath my feet in a busy street
I never said I was angry, but I think I'm still in misery
But it's what I needed and you took me by surprise

Sometimes I think I'm bound for losing it all
And I thinking I'm weighing
I think I'm weighing us down
But no, I won't fall, and I wouldn't trade it
I wouldn't trade it
I'm down for life

Another day I was selfish;
It reminds me of my wasted youth and all the one's and two's
I try to live in the moment;
It reminds me of the time we spent trapped in your apartment
We attract what we're ready for
It's something I can't ignore

Sometimes I think I'm bound for losing it all
And I thinking I'm weighing
I think I'm weighing us down
But no, I won't fall, and I wouldn't trade it
I wouldn't trade it now

Maybe some promises were broken; wasn't holding tight
But now I wanna know what it feels like
Sometimes I think I'm bound for losing it all
But I wouldn't trade it
I wouldn't trade it
I'm down for life

Call it off, I've made my move
I'm defenseless and I could use some time on my own and a place to say
I'm losing myself in the best way
Done with anything basic
I've had enough of the same shit

Tell me why
We attract what we're ready for
It's something I can't ignore

Sometimes I think I'm bound for losing it all
And I thinking I'm weighing
I think I'm weighing us down
But no, I won't fall, and I wouldn't trade it
I wouldn't trade it now

Maybe some promises we're broken; wasn't holding tight
But now I wanna know what it feels like
Sometimes I think I'm bound for losing it all
But I wouldn't trade it - I wouldn't trade it
I'm down for life
