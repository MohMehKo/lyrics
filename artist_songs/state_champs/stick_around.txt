This is a call for all the wasted days
And things I forgot to say
Like you bring me down 
I'll drag myself along
But I won't pray
Because that's not what I believe

Oh, won't you stick around

Well the line was drawn 
Won't you find someone 
That makes you feel like you're the one 
Who turns me on even when you're not around
And puts my feet right back on the ground
We'll fly together and jump to the second stone
Oh and she brings me to life
Knowing what's inside
Surprise, surprise
I'm ready come back home
So I'm leaving alone

What's this, but a story to lead you on? 
Of all the things we know
What's left to come? 
Is this your way? 
In my mind
I think I've been grinning since the day you said 
"I don't need you and all your lies
though my heart says otherwise" 

Well the line was drawn 
Won't you find someone 
That makes you feel like you're the one 
Who turns me on even when you're not around
And puts my feet right back on the ground
We'll fly together and jump to the second stone
Oh and she brings me to life
Knowing what's inside
Surprise, surprise
I'm ready to come back home
So I'm leaving alone

Lately weeks are going by so slow 
But the summer's coming at you just to let you know
Lately weeks are going by so slow 
But the summer's coming at you just to let you know

This is a call for all the wasted days
And things I forgot to say
Like you bring me down

You know I want you to 
Turn me on even when you're not around
And put my feet right back on the ground
We'll fly together and jump to the second stone
Oh and she brings me to life
Knowing what's inside
Surprise, surprise
I'm ready to come back home
So I'm leaving alone

Surprise, surprise
I'm ready to come back home
So I'm leaving alone
