How many times do you say that you're sorry
And that you think I'm up to no good?
You know I've said it before I'm not a monster
I'm just misunderstood
I'd like to take this time to cross my eyes to the reflection of you
Doing the same old thing
Wearing the same old ring
To see my point of view

Well these days are only getting longer
When everyday we're only getting stronger

How many times do you say that I'm lying to you?
Well let's be honest, baby, you have too.
I'm not ashamed to be in your way.
I'm headstrong, beyond any level you see me on
And I'm here to stay

Well these days are only getting longer
When everyday we're only getting stronger

What are you waiting for?
You knew before that we would
Throw it all away, throw it all away
(Throw it all away, throw it all away)
[x2]

Because affections held me to the ground
So I'll hold my breath and never make a sound
I'll never make a sound 
(We are the brave, don't try your luck here girl no not today)
We are the brave (we are the brave)
Don't try your luck here girl no not today

We are the brave
Don't try your luck here girl no not today

What are you waiting for?
You knew before that we would
Throw it all away, throw it all away
(Throw it all away, throw it all away)
[x2]

Because affections held me to the ground
So I'll hold my breath and never make a sound
(Throw it all away, throw it all away)

Yeah
