If this is all we know then I'm walking out that door tonight, 
and I'm heading in a new direction. 
The path of life has shown me things I don't wanna see, 
but you are the only exception. 
So let's drive all night, 
though it's obvious we've got nowhere to go. 
When in doubt, look towards the skyline. 
I've been living in the backseat of this life, 
searching for a sign that I can call mine, 
and it's in our eyes. 
Don't flatter me by saying you wouldn't have it any other way. 
That's not aloud, don't mess around, because today's a new day. 
Let's talk about what's important; 
My best friends, no more dead ends, and making moments last. 
So let's drive all night, though it's obvious we've got nowhere to go.
When in doubt, look towards the skyline. 
I've been living in the backseat of this life, 
searching for a sign that I can call mine, and it's in our eyes. 
I'm hanging on now, because time's gone way too fast. 
So give it all, make this small talk seem like it won't be our last.
