You’ve got your own problems to deal with so, I’ll say how it is
87 couldn’t get any longer, but I have to say that it’s makin' us stronger
Now all you have to do is sit and listen to the songs that make you feel alone 
And wish that I would come back home to you

Don’t let it happen again she said
Oh won’t you crawl back inside my bed
Oh what a let down its happened again 
But its never enough to keep you out of my head, of my head
Oh what a let down but we’ll just pretend 
that these promises were just a mistake, just a mistake
Feels like I’ve had the weight of the world on my back these past few weeks
And I’m losing sleep cause I know there’s something better to do at four in the morning 
When my life's not that boring 

Don’t let it happen again she said
(Well I’m trying, well I’m trying hard)
Oh won’t you crawl back inside my bed
(And do what I would never do to you)
Oh what a let down yeah it's happened again 
but it's never enough to keep you out of my head, of my head
Oh what a let down but we’ll just pretend 
that these promises were just a mistake, just a mistake
Oh look at what we've become

I say we’ve only just begun
We’ve only just begun
Oh what a let down yeah it's happened again 
but it's never enough to keep you out of my head, of my head
Oh what a let down but we’ll just pretend 
that these promises were just a mistake, just a mistake

You were just a mistake
