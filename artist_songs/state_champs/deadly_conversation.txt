We’re indifferent to this deadly conversation
I know you know we both know that it's...

I wonder if you think I'm still right there
When you make up your mind 
Slower than the changing of the seasons
Wouldn't you know I've come to terms?
That you wouldn't even care if I choked up and stopped my breathing

This isn't something more than life
I hope my calender breaks tonight
Before the morning comes
I hope you know that
We’re indifferent to this deadly conversation
I know you know we both know that it's wrong
To stay outside
Like ships in the night
I know you know we both know that it's wrong
So carry on

I wonder if you think I’m wasting time
I bet you got it all figured out
But must we try to break the ice
Beneath this heart of mine

I was perfectly lonely
I want you to show me
How you'd ever change my mind
When I was the same kid?

This isn't something more than life
I hope my calender breaks tonight
Before the morning comes
I hope you know that
We’re indifferent to this deadly conversation
I know you know we both know that it's wrong
To stay outside
Like ships in the night
I know you know we both know that it's wrong
So carry on

So don't you ever say my name
When it comes to who keeps you sane
I know that you're already gone

Cause when reality sets in place
You’ll be showing the world your second face
And we can carry on
I hope you know

We’re indifferent to this deadly conversation
I know you know we both know that it's wrong
To stay outside
Like ships in the night
I know you know we both know that it's wrong

This isn't something more than life
I hope my calender breaks tonight
Before the morning comes
Before the morning comes
