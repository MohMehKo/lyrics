I'll start this conversation. 
You were always known to choke on the words you say 
but still you pray that we can work this out. 
Your days are numbered if you think you're proving me wrong. 
You haven't seen anything yet. 
I walked on rooftops just to scream this out to you 
And make sure you don't forget. 
I live on the east coast baby, my heart is cold 
But lately I've been warming up no thanks to you. 
So, I'll end this conversation. 
I always knew where to draw the line. 
So keep talking, I'll shut your mouth 
if I have to say this one million times. 
But your days are numbered if you think you're proving me wrong. 
You haven't seen anything yet. 
I walked on rooftops just to scream this out to you 
And make sure you don't forget. 
I live on the east coast baby, my heart is cold 
but lately I've been warming up. 
Take me back to the love in a lifetime 
where I was waiting on a call that reads your name. 
The summer got closer. 
The lies that you told her now all make sense because it's over.
