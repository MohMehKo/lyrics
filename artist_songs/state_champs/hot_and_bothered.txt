A mile down the road
I spend my days in the big ATL
To everyone, everything
Well, I'm just a bit bitter, can't you tell?
But dear, I've never tried to be different
Then maybe, just maybe then you'll finally listen.

Try and say it, you'll be alright when you can't sleep through the night

[Chorus:]
Run the line
Run the line
There's gotta be something better than this
I'm leaving now, get off the ground, and say this with me
"So take flight, we're all fucking gone!" (you're crying)
"So take flight, we're all fucking gone." (you're crying)

So what's next? [?]
You want it all? What's in it for me?
Neglect to protect, and that is just my ego speaking
But they're right
Well I'm trying to be different
'Cause maybe then you'll, maybe then you'll finally listen.

Try and say it, you'll be alright when you can't sleep through the night

[Chorus]

What if I said I was bound to be the one to fall down continuously
You'll never know what I've been told
[x3]

[Chorus]

What if I said I was bound to be the one to fall down continuously
You'll never know what I've been told
[x2]
