who you are and why you're insecure.
I'm not certain yet, but I'll make sure

I hope that you know, inside I find it hard to rewind.
No, I don't wanna walk alone.

How'd you know that I could break this way?
I'm in town, it feels like we're miles away.
I'm still searching, while you're learning
who you are and why you're insecure.

I hope that you know, inside I find it hard to rewind.
No, I don't wanna walk alone.

(No, I don't wanna walk alone)

I could never resist, so prepare to be noticed.
I hope that you know, inside I find it hard to rewind.

I hope that you know, inside I find it hard to rewind.
No, I don't wanna walk alone.
No, I don't wanna walk alone.
