I know it takes some time to find the light
And get through the winter
And I used to sing about you in my life
But now I've reconsidered it all
These days remain fairly incomplete
But I won't wait to say that something's gotten into me

And to think we thought we made this place our home
You should know, I'm still wondering

How many stories have you told
Where you made it through hell with your eyes closed?
It's not that easy anymore (Believe me, it's not easy)
If seeing is believing, than everything you say is misleading
You told your story, but I don't feel sorry anymore

Selling yourself too short is the only way to break your decision
And I thought I told you to make your move
(But you wouldn't listen)

And to think we thought we made this place our home
You should know, I'm still wondering

How many stories have you told
Where you made it through hell with your eyes closed?
It's not that easy anymore (Believe me, it's not easy)
If seeing is believing, than everything you say is misleading
You told your story, but I don't feel sorry anymore

(This is the main event of the evening)
I've got a list of things to tell you and some time to kill
I told you that I'd settle down but I probably never will
At least I made up my mind
This is goodbye

How many stories have you told
Where you made it through hell with your eyes closed?
It's not that easy anymore (Believe me, it's not easy)
If seeing is believing, than everything you say is misleading
You told your story, but I don't feel sorry anymore

Anymore
