I intend to drive through the night 
And wonder if I'm ever not on your mind. 
I wrote a song for you so shout out every line. 
Well, I think it's time for me to be all I've wanted to be now. 
I think it's time for me to show how much I care. 
We couldn't make this town our own (I'm keeping secrets) 
So good luck with being on your own.
Watch what you say, 
Desperation might just take you to your grave. 
Let the record show you brought this on yourself. 
I intend to walk through the night 
And end up on the wrong side of the tracks to my train of thought. 
Well, I think it's time for me to be all I've wanted to be now. 
I think it's time for me to show how much I care. 
We couldn't make this town our own (I'm keeping secrets) 
So good luck with being on your own. 
Watch what you say, 
Desperation might just take you to your grave. 
Let the record show you brought this on yourself 
To prove how much I knew you knew better. 
You went and you said her name. 
To prove that we'll never be the same. 
This love story's a bust, I choose my friends. 
I'd rather be in love with them. 
This love story's a bust I chose my friends. 
Watch what you say, 
Desperation might just take you to your grave. 
Let the record show you brought this on yourself 
To prove how much I knew you knew better. 
You went and you said her name. 
To prove that we'll never be the same.
