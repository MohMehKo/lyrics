Apparently I'm nothing but a foolish boy with eyes.
That can see right though the fact that you are capable of lies.
Let's turn the page get one thing straight I'm fine (without you)
cause it's all the same.

So sing us a song (we all know)
and maybe it'll change your life.

I couldn't fake a smile and for a while 
I was putting you in your place
But if only I didn't have to see your face.
Don't tell me I'm not the same any more
I pay the do's you said I could pay for.
But now you're running. 
You're running right back to me.

So sing us a song (we all know)
and maybe it'll change your life.

It's not how it used to be.  
I agree. 
We're growing up but I'll stay young 
Even if it kills me.
Whoa.
[repeat]

I couldn't fake a smile and for a while 
I was putting you in your place.
But if only, if only I didin't have to see your face.
