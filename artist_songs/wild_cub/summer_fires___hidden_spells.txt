The summer fires
The hidden spells
Spoken in the daylight
Crooked little tongue tier
You can tell.

So brand new these naked answers turned away
That lonesome night in the middle of the day

My lunges are screaming for these answers
They’re tired of speaking nothing
We are running
We’re the running ones
And I said, give a little love

We’re tied to the riverside
We’re tied to each other
We’re swimming in the black dawn
Hiding from the other ones in the night

And you swam through me
You stood standing in the waves
That sad reflected truth gets in the way
