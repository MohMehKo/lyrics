In the hot night, I hear your voice
That blind horizon tying its blood red line to the center of choice

Hold on
I broke my back down waiting on a wishing well
Hold on
From the desert I drank of the wishing well

Up late, pour a little something in me
You slept so quiet and I can’t wake up the truth you’ve hidden in me
