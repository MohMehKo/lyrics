We turn the radio on
We roll the windows down
There’s a smell in the air like a fire’s burning somewhere outside of town
You said “drive”...

We don’t look into the mirror
When we don’t look at one another
And we brave our way through darkness like two cowardly lovers
And you said “drive”...

You put your pretty dress on
I put my suit on tight
And we dance like a couple in a bad, bad movie
But we can’t make out the lines
And you said “drive”...

We drive back through the ether
And we felt so alone tonight
All the little words were easy
But the thunder broke inside
