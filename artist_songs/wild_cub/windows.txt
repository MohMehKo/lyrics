No language, no intonation
Sad silence, hung darkness
Waiting, waiting…
I stood there waiting, waiting…
For something else
Something Else
Oh well
Something else.

I couldn’t hear it
I didn’t know if I could see it, love
When I need it, I can’t feel it in another
Waiting, waiting
I said “you look so lovely”
And you said “Oh well”
And in that love, the white noise of a shell
And I’ll wait.

Out of all the sad lies
And out of all the empty hearts
You stood proof to it
There’s some truth to it
A little flickers in the center of the dark

And we chase it in each other now
We chase it in the black night
It’s an apparition
It’s a superstition
I could try to tell you something
But just look me in the eyes…
In the eyes.
