We drive out
The edge of the ocean
Bright lights shining and the moon

We hold out
From each other
‘Cause we don’t know how to say the other words

And you said…
“Wait on me now
I’ll wait on you
If you say I need you now
I’ll save them here, these things I feel for you”

The night air
Rushes past me
Racing through the night
In our hearts

The water
Runs through me
We search in one another
For the truth
