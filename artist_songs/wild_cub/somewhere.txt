I see you blinking
Like a bitter little spark tonight
You're looking right
Ah come a little closer
But I don't know why I try and try
My little spark turning white
And I turn my eyes to the flashing lights
They say, "Try, try to remember"
Ohh you don't know my heart, it's dark
It's trying, trying, trying to find the little words that say

Look over your shoulder
I'll whisper back my love for you
I'll know on wood for you
I'll draw you closer
With a line upon the light for you
I'll walk back time for you

I hear you now
Like a storm cloud in the night somewhere
That dark force hanging there
Oh I wish there was something
To drown out all the light we share
When I see you standing there

I know my heart bleeds like a mirror when
You say those words
Oh you're not speaking
You're just repeating all the things we had
And all the little words that say

Look over your shoulder
I'll whisper back my love for you
I'll know on wood for you
I'll draw you closer
With a line upon the light for you
I'll walk back time for you

I know my heart bleeds like a mirror when
You say those words
You're not speaking, no you're not speaking
You're just repeating all the
Little little things

Oh you're not speaking
You're just repeating all the things we had
And all the little words that say

Look over your shoulder
I'll whisper back my love for you
I'll know on wood for you
I'll draw you closer
With a line upon the light for you
I'll walk back time for you
