We speak in a hidden little colour
Our love is the love we wanted more
Up late in the hot hot night
I need you and I need you alone

We see it in each other
It’s a black black shadow at the center of love
Back track to center, it’ll never be enough
We kill it in each other and another and another

I hate the way we’re speaking to each other
We kill it in each other til’ the money don’t stop

There’s nothing hidden from each other
We had that love, we wanted more
One hand reflected in the other
We tore it up, we wanted more
