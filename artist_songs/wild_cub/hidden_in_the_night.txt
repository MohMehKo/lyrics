The scattering lights
The rain in the streets
Hide your eyes when you’re walking near me
I know when something’s over
You don’t have to say those words
Their shapes are choking me

I said, let me run and hide
Don’t hold me no closer
I see it in your eyes when you have chosen
Somewhere there’s a right way
Somewhere there’s a reason
Somewhere I can run, run, run from me
And it was hidden in the night

Staring at the water
I’m Staring at the sea
The black sheet pulling itself from me
And I walk in a twisted circle
I’m treading that same ground
Walk with my eyes down
I can’t see
