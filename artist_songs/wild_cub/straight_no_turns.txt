Voiceless echoes we found each other
Some dark matter reflected in the other
We were waiting on love

Silent motion of truth, so quiet
We were waiting on love

Beneath those scattered lights we took shelter
We’re speaking in a lost tongue to each other
We were waiting on love

In the darkness, in the dark light
We found love

We’re speaking to each other in a hidden tongue
There’s fire in the center of it
We can’t keep it but the words aren’t wrong
There’s truth at the center of it
