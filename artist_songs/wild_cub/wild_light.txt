Met you in the middle of the pouring rain
Said “how about the weather?”
Speaking like a monkey to the weather vain
You said “try a little better”

I’ve been so broke down
Searching everywhere I’ve found
Nothing but a bitter heart
You shook it out sure like
Shook a little
Gave shape to something I had thought had coal in the middle

I need you now
It’s a wild light
We didn’t care if the time was right
We are
It’s a wild light

Standing in the morning’s unfolding light
I’m looking in the mirror
Who is that man and who am I?
Could you speak it to me clearer?

When I lay at night
The dying light
Casts across your body, I know
Sick of sentimental
Stop looking in the mirror
I know, I know…

I need you now
It’s a wild light
We didn’t care if the time was right
We are
It’s a wild light
I need you now
It’s a wild light
We are cold fire in the dead of night
We are wild light
