The receeding moonlight in your hand
Blue leaking, paint flickering strands
We were speaking, but those words echoed alone
The true words were fleeting
Nothing showed

When the stars shine down from heaven
They will light the streetlights with their song
I said my heart won’t run forever
That’s alright, it’s alright, it’s a lie…

You were kneeling at the edge of your bed
Bent pleading, the scattered words in your head
And I can see it, a shadow cast alone
And I don’t know, I don’t know…

When the stars shine down from heaven
They will leave a timid line drawn in our hearts
Well and that line burns forever
But it’s a lie, it’s a lie, it’s alright…

Oh it’s a lie, it’s a lie, it’s alright.
