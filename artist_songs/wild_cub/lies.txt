We looked into each other and
We turned from one another
And we said lies
Yeah we lies
We looked for other meanings
And in the darkness there were gleaming
Those little lies
We said lies
I reached for you and fell flat like the words we said out loud
That shapeless noise I try to tame for you
Hearts burn faster in the dark
They don’t know what love is, know what love is
What love
I see you in a glimmer
In lost light of the dimming
Timid lies
We said lies
You speak to me in rhythm
And you unveil what is hidden
In those lies
Silly lies
Laying in half light I see something traced out loud
The fragile lines you’ve written there for me
Hearts beat faster in the dark
They don’t know what love is, know what love is
What is love
We’re wishing, we’re hoping, we’re tightening the ropes to our arms
We got words but their tripping on the tips of our tongues
We couldn’t run from the pieces we were killing inside
But we tried, we tried
