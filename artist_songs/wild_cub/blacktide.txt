I didn’t know, what to do I just
Drove everywhere, I drove everywhere
Tried find some piece of you anywhere
I didn’t know I’d lied
we were young
we were blind
to the lines we’d written in blood
we felt nothing, we felt everything
we didn’t know
oh we couldn’t keep that love
oh we were young
I couldn’t speak
I reach to touch you and my arms are weak
All the words that you said to me
Oh they are wrong, wrong, wrong
oh they were wrong
they meant nothing
knowing I can’t take you tonight
we said something we said everything
we didn’t want to know
no no
oh we couldn’t keep that love
