I'm looking out on a scenic view
What a place of solitude
I feel peace within and I can finally breathe
But it's not the same without you here with me
Oh you take me to another stratosphere
Oh with you my troubles disappear

Pour me a rainbow, I need colour again
Pour me a rainbow, if you can, if you can
'Cause I wanna soar high and be your superman
Pour me a rainbow, you're my safe haven

Oh its always good vibes, when you're close near by
I feel them butterflies, come bring me them good vibes
Oh its always good vibes, when you're close near by
I feel them butterflies, come bring me them good vibes

Come on bring me them good vibes
Come on bring me them good vibes

Them good vibes, them good vibes
I need them good vibes, yeah
Come on give me them good vibes, yeah

Them good vibes, them good vibes
I need them good vibes, yeah
Come on give me them good vibes, yeah

When the roaring seas crashing in on me
Only your embrace makes me feel complete
You're my symbol of hope, defying gravity
The perfect energy like in a fairy tale

There's no denying the truth, together we shine gold
And dream in colour always like kaleidoscopes
Oh, a cosmic thing happens when we collide
Your heart illuminates, with you the future's safe

Pour me a rainbow, I need colour again
Pour me a rainbow, if you can, if you can
'Cause I wanna soar high and be your superman
Pour me a rainbow, you're my safe haven

Oh its always good vibes, when you're close near by
I feel them butterflies, come bring me them good vibes
Oh its always good vibes, when you're close near by
I feel them butterflies, come bring me them good vibes

Come on bring me them good vibes
Come on bring me them good vibes
Come on bring me them good vibes
