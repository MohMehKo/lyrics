My bad behaviour, my bad behaviour,
I told you I was troubled with
My bad behaviour

My bad behaviour, my bad behaviour,
I told you I was troubled with
My...

Don't tell me if I'm bad
Cause I don't no excuses
So don't be serious
You could have been persuaded

I want the key to your heart (to your heart)
And you've known from the start (from the start)
And if the smile comes it won't be the last (be the last)
But I've got a little problem that I can't seem to solve

My bad behaviour, my bad behaviour,
I told you I was troubled with
My bad behaviour

My bad behaviour, my bad behaviour,
I told you I was troubled with
My bad behaviour

Oh, oh, eh, oh
Bad Behaviour
Oh, oh, eh, oh

Oh, oh, eh, oh

So how's it a surprise
When you knew who you were dating
Just oath to have some fun
So we shouldn't been complaining

I want the key to your heart (to your heart)
And you've known from the start (from the start)
And if the smile comes it won't be the last (be the last)
But I've got a little problem that I can't seem to solve

My bad behaviour, my bad behaviour,
I told you I was troubled with
My bad behaviour

My bad behaviour, my bad behaviour,
I told you I was troubled with
My bad behaviour

Oh, oh, eh, oh
Bad Behaviour
Oh, oh, eh, oh
Bad Behaviour
Oh, oh, eh, oh
Bad Behaviour
Oh, oh, eh, oh

So tell me, t-tell me, tell me, why, why should I stop?
If we're having fun well do it till we drop.
So tell me, t-tell me, tell me, why, why should I go?
If we never know.

My bad behaviour, my bad behaviour,
I told you I was troubled with
My bad behaviour

My bad behaviour, my bad behaviour,
I told you I was troubled with
My bad behaviour

Oh, oh, eh, oh
