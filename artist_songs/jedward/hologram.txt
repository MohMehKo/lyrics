I used to be your future, now I'm your past.
Tell me how this happened? Why we turn to ash?
Where did your heart go? It don't make any sense.
I've been reaching out, but you reject my attempts.

Oh, enough is enough. I miss our chemistry.
And how it felt back then making sweet memories.
Oh, I'm on my knees. Praying, I do believe.
And calling out for you. Won't you acknowledge me?

Cause in my head you're just a hologram,
That no longer cares for love or affection.
How could you be this cold and so transparent?
I need to love you now, but you're a hologram.

Cause in my head you're just a hologram,
That no longer cares for love or affection.
How could you be this cold and so transparent?
I need to love you now, but you're a hologram.

Once upon a kiss, we had it all.
But now we're just a memory in a bottle.
I got nostalgic feelings running through my veins.
I know that I'm in trouble, cause I feel this pain.

Now we've reached a point of no return,
And turning back for you ain't an option.
Your silhouette is fading while my heart is breaking.
Tell me what to do, tell me how to stop shaking.

Oh, enough is enough. I miss our chemistry.
And how it felt back then making sweet memories.
Oh, I'm on my knees. Praying, I do believe.
And calling out for you. Won't you acknowledge me?

Cause in my head you're just a hologram,
That no longer cares for love or affection.
How could you be this cold and so transparent?
I need to love you now, but you're a hologram.

Cause in my head you're just a hologram,
That no longer cares for love or affection.
