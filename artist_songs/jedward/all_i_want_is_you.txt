Thought I was a man's man,
I was tough,
Didn't waste my time on romance,
And love,
And all that girl stuff

Tryna figure it out,
Don't know how you're doin' this,
You make me realise all my life I've been livin' upside down,
But you turned my world around

All I wanted was cars and girls,
Guitars, the world,
Now all I want is you,
All I ever thought about means nothing now,
Cause all I want is you

Woah, you,
Woah, you,
Woah, all I want is you

Woah, you,
Woah, you,
Woah, all I want is you

And I'll do,
What it takes,
I'll call you up a thousand times,
I'll take until you break

I need to figure it out,
Don't know how you're doin' this,
You make me realise all my life I've been livin' upside down,
But you turned my world around

All I wanted was cars and girls,
Guitars, the world,
Now all I want is you
All I ever thought about means nothing now,
Cause all I want is you,

Woah, you,
Woah, you,
Woah, all I want is you

Woah, you,
Woah, you,
Woah, all I want is you

To be with me for the rest of my life,
And I feel so amazing when I look into your eyes,
Turns my world around

All I wanted was cars and girls,
Guitars, the world,
Now all I want is you,
All I ever thought about means nothing now,
Cause all I want is you,

Woah, you,
Woah, you,
Woah, all I want is you

Woah, you,
Woah, you,
Woah, all I want is you
