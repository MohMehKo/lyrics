When I see your face in a crowded room,
Although you are miles away,
I know that you are with me here

Oooh,
I guess the nitty-gritty truth is too hard,
So I pick out all the good parts,
Where delusions work out for the better,
So I'll just live in a world of my makin',
Where I know you'll,

Give it up,
Give it up,
Give it to me,
Give me love,
Give me love,
Give it to me,
Cause I know you'll love me still

Always pleases me when I feel your breath on the collar of my shirt,
I know that you are with me here

Oooh,
I guess the nitty-gritty truth is too hard,
So I pick out all the good parts,
Where delusions work out for the better,
So I'll just live in a world of my makin',
Where I know you'll,

Give it up,
Give it up,
Give it to me,
Give me love,
Give me love,
Give it to me,
Cause I know you'll love me still

You know insanity is easy and my way of getting through this alive,
Helps my heart to throw a party, not die,
Where I know you'll,

Give it up,
Give it up,
Give it to me,
Give me love,
Give me love,
Give it to me,
Cause I know you'll love me still

Where I know you'll,

Give it up,
Give it up,
Give it to me,
Give me love,
Give me love,
Give it to me,
Cause I know you'll love me still
