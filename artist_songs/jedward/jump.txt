Don't try to compare us to another bad little fad
I'm the Mac and I'm bad give you something that you never had
I'll make ya Jump, Jump wiggle and shake your rump Cause I'll be kicking the flavor that makes you wanna Jump!
How high? Real high Cause I'm just so fly
A young loveable, huggable type of guy
And everything is the back with a little slack
And inside-out is wiggida wiggida wack!
Come stompin' with somethi' to keep you jumpin'
R&B rap bullcrap is what I'm dumpin'
And ain't something about Kris Kross we all that
So when they ask to the rocks they believe that

I let myself knockin' knockin'
I love it when a girl is like jockin' jockin'
The D-A-double D-Y-M-A-C yeah you know me!
Got you jumpin' an' pumpin' an' movin' all around
In the mix I make ya take a step back
They try to step to the Mac then they got jacked
To the back you'll be sportin' the gear that's coincidental
And like you know it so don't be claiming that it's mental
Two lil' kids with a flow you ain't ever heard
And none faking you can understand every word
As you listen to my cool school melody
The Daddy makes you J-U-M-P

Jump! Jump!
