Cele-celebrity, Get down with a celebrity,
Cele-celebrity, Get down with a celebrity,
Cele-celebrity, Get down with a celebrity,
She's mine this time,

With your own entourage,
I never thought that she could be mine, like every time,
With every word she spoke,
I had to confess that I could be sold on every line,

Then she said,
Tell me the place and we'll go wherever you want,
Just say my name and the VIP will be ours,
Just tell me the truth,
What you wanna do with me, me, me,

Woah,
Let's keep it on the low,
Cuz I don't think you're ready,
Let's just,
Keep it on the low,
And dance like there's nobody watching,
Keep it on the low,
I think the time has come to get down, down, down,
With a celebrity,

Cele-celebrity, Get down with a celebrity,
Cele-celebrity, Get down with a celebrity,
Cele-celebrity, Get down with a celebrity,
She's mine this time,

I can't believe my eyes,
This girl has got me hooked in this time, it's no surprise,
The paparazzi keep following,
Following, I can't conrtol what my heart desires,
Then she said,
Tell me the place and we'll go wherever you want,
Just say my name and the VIP will be ours,
Just tell me the truth,
What you wanna do with me, me, me,

Woah,
Let's keep it on the low,
Cuz I don't think you're ready,
Let's just,
Keep it on the low,
And dance like there's nobody watching,
Keep it on the low,
I think the time has come to get down, down, down,
With a celebrity,

Then they really need to go,
Cuz then they talk about it,
Like the people who they know,
Cuz they see her in the magazines but she's right infront of me,
I can't let go, won't let go, no,

Let's keep it on the low,
Cuz I don't think you're ready,
Let's just,
Keep it on the low,
And dance like there's nobody watching,
Keep it on the low,
I think the time has come to get down, down, down,
