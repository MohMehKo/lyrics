Set it off,
We 'bout to live it up,
Tear the city down,
Just cause I can.
Point and stare,
You ain't seen nothing yet,
We gonna party,
They ain't shutting us down.

Ain't nobody's baby,
Everybody's crazy,
We got the city up in flames tonight
Girls, they wanna bite me,
Their boyfriends wanna fight me,
Don't care as long as my song is on replay

Watch me fly away,
We tryna reach the top and we ain't never coming down from here,
Watch me fly away,
We trying to stop until the to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-top

Cause baby yeah, we're cool like that,
We just don't give a damn,
We gonna party out till tomorrow.
Yeah, we cool like that,
We just livin' our lives,
When the sun comes up we gonna be heroes.

Crack of dawn,
And we still rockin' on,
We 'bout to raise a toast,
For lookin' so fly.
Dressed to fun,
The night has just begun,
We burn the rules and throw the ashes away.

Ain't nobody's baby,
Everybody's crazy,
