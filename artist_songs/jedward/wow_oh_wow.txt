She's got me seeing red light,
Bang, bang, pow,
Eleven out of ten,

Straight off the Richter scale,
She drives me wild,
I try to fight it but I can't let go,
She going low,
Out of control, (wow oh wow oh wow oh wow oh wow)

She got body and it got me,
On the floor, tryna kill her looking at me,
See, I got a feeling,
She got a feeling,
Wow, oh, wow, oh wow,
She be a problem when the beat drops,
Got 'em all lined up around the whole block,
See, I got a feeling,
She got a feeling,
Wow, oh, wow, oh wow,

Wow oh wow,
She's got this energy like bang, bang, pow,
Erotic overload, it breaks me down,
My heart is racing and it can't slow down,
I try to shake it but I can't let go,
She's going low,
Out of control, (wow oh wow oh wow oh wow oh wow)

On the floor, tryna kill her looking at me,
See, I got a feeling,
