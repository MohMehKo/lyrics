As the sun,
Starts to fall,
Counting down,
We're going up tonight,
All aboard,
Find a call,
Taking disco intergalactico,

So don't look down, You just turn your speakers up
Count to take us up, take us up, take us up,

Jump on my Pop Rocket,
It's about to blow,
We're going straight to stars,
A-Away we Go!
Gonna dance all night,
With the world below!
Woah, woah, woah,

Get on my pop, pop rocket, pop, pop, pop,
Get on my pop, pop rocket, pop, pop, pop,
Get on my pop, pop rocket, pop, pop, pop,
Get on my pop, pop rocket, pop,

Round the moon,
In record time,
Cuz we're moving,
At the speed of light,
Everyone,
Jump off the floor,
Gravity won't hold us down tonight,

So don't look down,
Music never ever stops,
It's time to turn it up, turn it up, turn it up,

Jump on my Pop Rocket,
It's about to blow,
We're going straight to stars,
A-Away we Go!
Gonna dance all night,
With the world below!
Woah, woah, woah,

Get on my pop, pop rocket, pop, pop, pop,
Get on my pop, pop rocket, pop, pop, pop,
Get on my pop, pop rocket, pop, pop, pop,
Get on my pop, pop rocket, pop, pop, pop,

With you,
I'm weightless
One touch,
You make this heart of mine beat faster,
Now, let's go again,
We're spinning around,

Pop Rocket,
It's about to blow,
Going straight to stars, to the stars, to the stars,
Gonna dance all night,
With the world below!
Woah, woah, woah,

Jump on my Pop Rocket,
It's about to blow,
We're going straight to stars,
A-Away we Go!
Gonna dance all night,
With the world below!
Woah, woah, woah,

Get on my pop, pop rocket, pop, pop, pop,
Get on my pop, pop rocket, pop, pop, pop,
Get on my pop, pop rocket, pop, pop, pop,
Get on my pop, pop rocket, pop, pop, pop,

(Music never ever stops, stops, stops)
(Music never ever stops, stops, stops, stops)
(Music never ever stops, stops, stops)
(Music never ever stops, stops, stops, stops)

Pop Rocket,
It's about to blow,
Going straight to stars, to the stars, to the stars,
Gonna dance all night,
With the world below!
Woah, woah, woah
