We sit here watching passing cars,
Here in the dark,
Headlights shine like shooting stars,
How beautiful you are,

I know it may sound craZy,
But I swear they're here tonight,

I hold the world,
In my arms,
Where you begin is where I start,
The universe,
Revolves around us,
It's like nothing out there matters,

I hold the world,
I hold the world,

It dawned on me at 2AM,
While you were sleeping,
The shadows danced upon your skin,
They're pulling me in,

We gravitate to eachother,
Like planets we collide,

I hold the world,
In my arms,
Where you begin is where I start,
The universe,
Revolves around us,
It's like nothing out there matters,

I hold the world,
I hold the world,
I hold the world,
I hold the world,
I hold the world,

We're fragile but unbreakable,
I hold the world,
Soaring higher as we fall,
I hold the world,
Nothing else is visible to me,

I hold the world,

I hold the world,
Here in my arms,
Where you begin is where I start,
The universe,
Revolves around us, round us, round us,

I hold the world,
In my arms,
Where you begin is where I start,
The universe,
Revolves around us,
It's like nothing out there matters,

I hold the world,
I hold the world,
I hold the world,
I hold the world,
I hold the world,

It's only you and me,
There's nothing else, see?
Because I hold the world,

It's only you and me,
There's nothing else, see?
Because I hold the world
