Hey-hey, yea-yea-yea-yeah,
Hey-hey, yea-yea-yea-yeah,

I'm likin' this techno girl,
She's takin' me out of this world,
She's got me hooked on a look and I'm ready to blow,
We're gonna light up the night so let's go go go go,
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight,
I feel just like I'm falling in love, (I could tell her)
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight,
I feel just like I'm falling in love,
With this techno girl, girl, girl,
She's my techno girl, girl, girl,
She's my techno girl, girl, girl,
She's my techno girl, girl, girl,

Hey-hey, yea-yea-yea-yeah,
Hey-hey, yea-yea-yea-yeah,

I'm loving this techno girl,
She's got everything that I want,
She's got a style like she's straight, straight from the future,
She makes me fly to the sky,
I need her her her her,

Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight,
I feel just like I'm falling in love, (I could tell her)
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight,
I feel just like I'm falling in love,
With this techno girl, girl, girl,
She's my techno girl, girl, girl,
She's my techno girl, girl, girl,
She's my techno girl, girl, girl,

Hey-hey, yea-yea-yea-yeah,
Hey-hey, yea-yea-yea-yeah,

For one, I could hold her now I'm back for more,
Or two, I could leave alone be out the door,
Or three, leave the good time, come with me,
Or four, she could leave me torn,

I'm in love with a techno girl,
I'm in love with a techno girl,
I'm in love with a techno girl,
I don't think I can take it much more,

Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight,
I feel just like I'm falling in love, (I could tell her)
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight,
I feel just like I'm falling in love,
With this techno girl, girl, girl,
She's my techno girl, girl, girl,
She's my techno girl, girl, girl,
She's my techno girl, girl, girl,

Hey-hey, yea-yea-yea-yeah,
Hey-hey, yea-yea-yea-yeah,
Hey-hey, yea-yea-yea-yeah,
