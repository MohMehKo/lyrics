She's mine, she's mine,
She's mine, she's mine,
Oh, oh,
Hey, hey, hey, hey,

Can't keep their eyes offa her,
Wherever she goes, (oh, oh, woah)
They ain't never seen a girl so beautiful, (oh, oh, woah)

She's a show stopper-stopper,
She's a jaw dropper-dropper,
And when you sweet-talk her,
You start to st-st-stutter,
She's burning hot like a fire,
From her head to her toes,

1, 2, 3, 4,
Make it Jump, Jump, Jump!
Turn it Up, Up, Up!
Got the crowd going craZy,
There goes my baby,
So hot, hot, hot,
I'm like what, what, what,
She's my own superstar,
She's mine, shes my,
Miss America,
Oh, oh,
She's my Miss America,
Oh, oh,

This girl is more than amazing,
I can't find the words,
Sorry this girl has been taken,
Haven't you heard?

She's a show stopper-stopper,
She's a jaw dropper-dropper,
And when you sweet-talk her,
You start to st-st-stutter,
She's burning hot like a fire,
From her head to her toes,

1, 2, 3, 4,
Make it Jump, Jump, Jump!
Turn it Up, Up, Up!
Got the crowd going craZy,
There goes my baby,
So hot, hot, hot,
I'm like what, what, what,
She's my own superstar,
She's mine, shes my,
Miss America,
Oh, oh,
She's mine, shes my,
Miss America,
Oh, oh,

Ain't nobody in this city who's got that million-dollar pretty,
She's got a smile that could light up the whole wide world,

Make it Jump, Jump, Jump!
Turn it Up, Up, Up!
Got the crowd going craZy,
There goes my baby,
So hot, hot, hot,
I'm like what, what, what,
She's my own superstar,
She's mine, shes my,
Miss America,
She's mine, shes mine,
She's mine, shes mine,
She's mine, shes mine,
