Ay one by one
I'll beat you down
Oh hell no oh hell no
Bit by bit
I ain't messing around
Oh hell no oh hell no

Cause I've had it up to here
Now I'm ready to make it clear
Run start trippin I'm out for the kill
Oh hell no!

Ay one by one

Oh hell no oh hell no
Bit by bit

Oh hell no oh hell no

Run start trippin I'm out for the kill
Oh hell no!

Look there ain't no time
To be practical
I'll eat you up like a animal
Cause your jealousy
Made u dead to me
I feel no regrets
Goodbye enemy

Ay pack your bags or
Get smashed to pieces
Don't even try to be a
Ignoramus

Cause you
Were the hurdle
Slowing me down
Only a traitor talking trash
All the time

Ah get your keys
No more time wasting
I'm coming at a you fierce
Like a hurricane

Your barricades
Ain't stopping me
I think you better run and
Go flee flee flee

Cause you know I'll prevail
So you probably should bail
Before I blow you up with
Dynamite

And I might even send you back
With all your crap cause
Everybody knows im nice like that

Now what's it gonna be
You dirty piece of scum
You a better make the right choice
Or are you gonna play dumb

Cause your ignorance
Has got me bitting my tongue
I'm so sick of you and
Your snake venom

Yeah fee fi fo fum
Run run run
Here I come zi zoom zoom zoom
Imma smack u up
Then bo boom boom boom
Imma shake u up
Ur do doom doom doomed

Ay one by one
I'll beat you down
Oh hell no oh hell no
Bit by bit
I ain't messing around
Oh hell no oh hell no

Cause I've had it up to here
Now I'm ready to make it clear
Run start trippin I'm out for the kill
Oh hell no!

Ay one by one
I'll beat you down
Oh hell no oh hell no
Bit by bit
I ain't messing around
Oh hell no oh hell no

Cause I've had it up to here
Now I'm ready to make it clear
Run start trippin I'm out for the kill
Oh hell no!

Oh hell no oh hell no
Oh hell no oh hell no
