You know what?
She's not your everyday average girl,
Listen up,
Ever since I met this girl,
Don't even watch TV,
Don't go to movies, no,
I don't even turn on the radio,
She's everything I want,
A-all rolled into one,
She's like a fantasy,
But I'm in luck cuz she's real to me, me, me, oh, yeah,

She's got,
Hips like Shakira,
Lips of Angelina,
Twisted like Gaga,
Dances like Madonna,
She got that boom, boom, like Britney,
Swagger of Beyoncé,
Baby don't you know that you are,
My everyday superstar, superstar, superstar-star,
It's kinda hard to sum it up,
She's got that what, what, what,

A mystery,
Moving on the scene like a dancing queen,
She ain't that average type,
She's bigger than her height,
But don't you even try,
Givin' her the eye cuz she's all mine, mine, mine, oh yeah,

She's got,
Hips like Shakira,
Lips of Angelina,
Twisted like Gaga,
Dances like Madonna,
She got that boom, boom, like Britney,
Swagger of Beyoncé,
Baby don't you know that you are,
My everyday superstar, superstar, superstar-star,

She got that chemistry, chemistry,
Mixin' it up,
She keeps on sendin' me, sendin' me,
Over the top,
She got that chemistry, chemistry,
Mixin' it up,
She keeps on sendin' me, sendin' me,
Over the top,

She's got,
Hips like Shakira,
Lips of Angelina,
Twisted like Gaga,
Dances like Madonna,
She got that boom, boom, like Britney,
Swagger of Beyoncé,
Baby don't you know that you are,
My everyday superstar, superstar, superstar-star,

Like Shakira,
