We see the day,
Tryin' to fight it,
It's all in vain,
Cause we know the night wins,
But we don't care,
We're lighting up like a flare

It's so unreal,
The light that you're shining,
You make me feel,
Like the darkness won't matter,
Cause you and I,
Don't care where the day has gone,
We don't need the break of dawn,

We don't need the break of dawn

And I will always know where you are,
Cause I can see you glow in the dark,
We got the stars, and moon, and us,
We're always gonna be luminous,

And I will always know where you are,
Cause I can see you glow in the dark,
We got the stars, and moon, and us,
We're always gonna be luminous,
Luminous

The world is frozen,
Your body's warm,
We fall out of our beds,
City falls asleep and we're reborn,
Won't bother to seize the day,
We don't care,
No cause,

We own the night,
As soon as you kiss me,
The sun will hide,
Ain't gonna miss it,
Cause you and I,
Don't care where the day is gone,
We don't need the break of dawn

And I will always know where you are,
Cause I can see you glow in the dark,
We got the stars, and moon, and us,
We're always gonna be luminous

And I will always know where you are,
Cause I can see you glow in the dark,
We got the stars, and moon, and us,
We're always gonna be luminous,
Luminous,
Luminous
