I've been through struggles
Dodged a lot thrown at me
Some people in the world
Don't want you to succeed
I spotted your true colours
I saw through the disguise
I figured you're a user
You're only full of lies

Now it's bright
I'm standing like a lion
Not caring what you say
Crawl away now you poison spider
Don't ever stand in my way

I'm setting free my inner wolf
I will be ferocious
And I'm setting free my inner tiger
I will be ferocious
And I'm setting free my inner wolf
I will be ferocious
And I'm setting free my inner tiger
I will be ferocious

Ferocious, ferocious
I will be ferocious
Ferocious, ferocious
I will be ferocious
Ferocious, ferocious
I will be ferocious
Ferocious, ferocious
I will be ferocious

Life is never easy
Don't ever pack it in
Deal with all the highs and lows
Don't let them say you can't
You've come out of the dark
Found the courage within
Now I know for a fact
I can face anything

Now it's bright
I'm standing like a lion
Not caring what you say
Crawl away now you poison spider
Don't ever stand in my way

I'm setting free my inner wolf
I will be ferocious
And I'm setting free my inner tiger
I will be ferocious
And I'm setting free my inner wolf
I will be ferocious
And I'm setting free my inner tiger
I will be ferocious

Ferocious, ferocious
I will be ferocious
Ferocious, ferocious
I will be ferocious
Ferocious, ferocious
I will be ferocious
Ferocious, ferocious
I will be ferocious
Ferocious, ferocious
I will be ferocious
Ferocious, ferocious
I will be ferocious
Ferocious, ferocious
I will be ferocious
Ferocious, ferocious
I will be ferocious

I'm setting free my inner wolf
I will be ferocious
And I'm setting free my inner tiger
I will be ferocious
