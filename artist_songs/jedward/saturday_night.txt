I'm getting up,
She's on my mind,
Yeah, I think about the girl all the time,
She's going out,
Saturday night,
And I'm hoping that I'ma make her mine, (No she's mine)

This crazy world, crazy world,
Has to wait,
I think about you every night and day,
This crazy world, crazy world's gone on pause,
And you know you're the only cause,

Can't wait till Saturday, Saturday, Saturday night,
Can't wait till Saturday, Saturday, Saturday night,
Can't wait till Saturday, Saturday, Saturday night,
Can't wait for the weekend to begin, no,
Cuz we gon' light it up and go hard,
I'm gonna get the girl that I want,
Can't wait till Saturday, Saturday, Saturday night,
Can't wait for the weekend to begin, no,

I'm gonna give the the best I got,
Cuz she hits me like a 10 tonne rock,
I'm getting sick,
Give me a sign,
Cuz she's all that's ever on my mind, mind, mind,

This crazy world, crazy world,
Has to wait,
I think about you every night and day,
This crazy world, crazy world's gone on pause,
And you know you're the only cause,

Can't wait till Saturday, Saturday, Saturday night,
Can't wait till Saturday, Saturday, Saturday night,
Can't wait till Saturday, Saturday, Saturday night,
Can't wait for the weekend to begin, no,
Cuz we gon' light it up and go hard,
I'm gonna get the girl that I want,
Can't wait till Saturday, Saturday, Saturday night,
Can't wait for the weekend to begin, no,

Give me a shot,
Give me time,
Give me more,
Give me everything you got,
Cuz I wanna know,
Give me a shot,
Give me time,
Give me more,
Give me everything you got,
'Til the night will show,
Can't wait till Saturday, Saturday, Saturday night,
Can't wait till Saturday, Saturday, Saturday night,
Can't wait till Saturday, Saturday, Saturday night,
Can't wait for the weekend to begin, no,

Can't wait till Saturday, Saturday, Saturday night,
Can't wait till Saturday, Saturday, Saturday night,
Can't wait till Saturday, Saturday, Saturday night,
Can't wait for the weekend to begin, no,

Cuz we gon' light it up and go hard,
I'm gonna get the girl that I want,
Can't wait till Saturday, Saturday, Saturday night,
Can't wait for the weekend,
Can't wait for the weekend to begin, no
