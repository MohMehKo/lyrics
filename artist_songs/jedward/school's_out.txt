Woah-oh-oh-oh

Oh yes I,
Confess this time has been insane,
No stress I,
Yeah, I guess that I should not complain,
Now I wish that I could put my books up on the shelf,
Just wait,
Until they ring that bell

Gotta roll with the punches,
Control it like it's nothing,
Too coo-coo-cool for school, no,
We just wanna have some fun

Woah-oh-oh,
Can't wait until school is out,
Woah-oh-oh,
Think I can hear the music now,
Hey! (Hey!)
You! (You!)
Let's get this party started like,
We! (We!)
Do! (Do!)
Makin' everybody go,
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh,
Can't wait till school is out

Frustration,
Motivation,
Gotta hit and score,
Graduation,
Liberation,
Knocking at my door,
Vacations,
Get your phone,
Nobody but myself,
So watch out summer 2012

Gotta roll with the punches,
Control it like it's nothing,
Too coo-coo-cool for school, no,
We just wanna have some fun

Woah-oh-oh,
Can't wait until school is out,
Woah-oh-oh,
Think I can hear the music now,
Hey! (Hey!)
You! (You!)
Let's get this party started like,
We! (We!)
Do! (Do!)
Makin' everybody go,
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh,
Can't wait till school is out,
Can't wait till school is out,
No I can't wait till school is out,
Can't wait till school is out

Gotta roll with the punches,
Control it like it's nothing,
It's nothing,
It's nothing,
It's nothing

Woah-oh-oh,
Can't wait until school is out,
Woah-oh-oh,
Think I can hear the music now,
Hey! (Hey!)
You! (You!)
Let's get this party started like,
We! (We!)
Do! (Do!)
Makin' everybody go,
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh,
Can't wait till school is

Woah-oh-oh,
Can't wait until school is out,
Woah-oh-oh,
Think I can hear the music now,
Hey! (Hey!)
You! (You!)
Let's get this party started like,
We! (We!)
Do! (Do!)
Makin' everybody go,
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh,
Can't wait till school is out
