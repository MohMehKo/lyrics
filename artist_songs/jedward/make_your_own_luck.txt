Take control, decide where you wanna go
Cause you got a story that needs to be told 
So don’t hold back, it’s the right thing to do

Every shot brings you closer 
To hitting a home run 
So throw away all your problems 
And show them how it’s done
Cause the moments here 
And its crystal clear 
That your the chosen one
So what you waiting for 
Let the good times roll
It’s go big or go home

You gotta make your own luck 
Always roll the dice
Make your own luck 
Keep your eye on the prize
Cause you only have one life 
Better reach for the sky 
You gotta make your own luck 
Spread your wings and fly

Sprint the whole nine yards, run that extra mile
Make the most of each tick tock on your stop watch
You got a royal flush, I like your style
