Get up and dance
You got my system overloading right now
I think this audition is over right now

As I look around the club
I'm stuck at what's across from me
When I see her potential cause I'm taking what she's offering
Take one, rotate
What you wanna do?
Shake that body take over the room

Get up and dance
Wish you can see what I'm recording right now
Turn it up louder
Ain't no way I could sugar coat it right now
Get up and dance
You got my system overloading right now
I think this audition is over right now

oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Get up and dance
You got my system overloading right now
I think this audition is over right now

The way you ripping up the floor like you rehearse the moves
I think I wanna go where only you can take me to
Most focus on everybody else but you
When you walk in the room

Get up and dance
Wish you can see what I'm recording right now
Turn it up louder
Ain't no way I could sugar coat it right now
Get up and dance
You got my system overloading right now
I think this audition is over right now

oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Get up and dance
You got my system overloading right now
I think this audition is over right now

Rock your body
Rock your body
Rock-rock your body on the dance floor
Rock the camera like a superstar

Get up and dance
Wish you can see what I'm recording right now
Turn it up louder
Ain't no way I could sugar coat it right now
get up and dance
You got my system overloading right now
I think this audition is over right now

Get up and dance
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Get up and dance
You got my system overloading right now
I think this audition is over right now

Get up and dance
Wish you can see what I'm recording right now
Turn it up louder
Ain't no way I could sugar coat it right now
Get up and dance
You got my system overloading right now
