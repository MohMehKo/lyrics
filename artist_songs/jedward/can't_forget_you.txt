It's like a shot through the heart,
Like a light in the dark,
That morning when you left me in my bed

And when you walked out the door,
You said I wouldn't see you anymore,
And I thought you were joking,
Now I can't close what you've opened

Gone crazy,
It's like I've left it too late,
One wish to have one chance to say

What if I told you that I can't forget you?
Nothing I can do will ever get you out of my head,
Cause I remember everything you said.
And I'm sorry that I can't forget you,
Sometimes I wish I never met you,
Doesn't matter what I do,
I'm trying but I can't forget you

If I saw you again,
Would you wanna just be friends?
Cause I know I won't feel like this again,
And would you wanna hear me out?
What would we even talk about?
Well I'd start with, "I'm sorry, and I wish you'd never left me"

Can't stop this,
I don't think I'll be saved,
One wish to have one chance to say

What if I told you that I can't forget you?
Nothing I can do will ever get you out of my head,
Cause I remember everything you said.
And I'm sorry that I can't forget you,
Sometimes I wish I never met you,
Doesn't matter what I do,
I'm trying but I can't forget you

Gone crazy,
It's like I've left it too late,
One wish to have one chance to say

What if I told you that I can't forget you?
Nothing I can do will ever get you out of my head,
Cause I remember everything you said.
And I'm sorry that I can't forget you,
Sometimes I wish I never met you,
Doesn't matter what I do,
I'm trying but I can't forget you

What if I told you that I can't forget you?
Nothing I can do will ever get you out of my head,
Girl, I remember everything you said
