Word is out
Make some noise
Get yo' shades
The summer's here
I don't care
Where we go
Just as long
As you're somewhere near

Feels like a long time coming
But now the heat is pumping
And the party never stops

Hit me up, what ya gonna do
The summer's looking hot
With a girl like you
Grab your friends, party by the pool
Give us all ya got, jump in, woo-hoo
Here come the boys, here come the boys
Na na na na, na na na na
Hit me up, what ya gonna do
The summer's looking hot
With a girl like, girl like you.

Gotta crush
Grab some ice
Cherry coke
Trying to keep us cool
Make it pop
Turn it up
Gotta dance
Now I just need you, yeah

Get here let's make a picture
I'll post it on my twitter
And the party never stops

Hit me up, what ya gonna do
The summer's looking hot
With a girl like you
Grab your friends, party by the pool
Give us all ya got, jump in, woo-hoo
Here come the boys, here come the boys
Na na na na, na na na na
Hit me up, what ya gonna do
The summer's looking hot
With a girl like, girl like you.

If the girls say truth
The boys say dare
Cause we all wanna party
And we really don't care

Hit me up, what ya gonna do
The summer's looking hot
With a girl like you
Grab your friends, party by the pool
Give us all ya got, all ya got...

Hit me up, what ya gonna do
The summer's looking hot
With a girl like you
Grab your friends, party by the pool
Give us all ya got, jump in, woo-hoo
Here come the boys, here come the boys
Na na na na, na na na na
Hit me up, what ya gonna do
The summer's looking hot
With a girl like, girl like you.

Don't stop now
Ya got me spinning and I can't slow down
It's getting late and there's no more school
Wanna kick it with a girl like you,
Like you, like you
Here come the boys, here come the boys
Na na na na, na na na na
Hit me up, what ya gonna do
The summer's looking hot
With a girl like, girl like you.
Hit me up, what ya gonna do
The summer's looking hot
With a girl like, girl like you.
