We all want to be seen and heard
We all want to leave a mark on this world
Let the thunder and echoes come and go
Embark on a journey, let the magic unfold

Be your own canvas, paint the vision you see
Use whatever colours to show how you feel
Be known as the person who did all they could
Act like the icons in the storybooks

I salute those who gave it their all
I salute those who shot to the stars
I salute those who gave it their all
I salute those who shot to the stars

We all want to be seen and heard
We all want to leave a mark on this world
Let the thunder and echoes come and go
Embark on a journey, let the magic unfold

Before your days are numbered, laugh out loud
Do the right thing, stand tall and proud
When all is said and done, you can look back on your life
With teardrops of joy knowing you did all you should

I salute those who gave it their all
I salute those who shot to the stars
I salute those who gave it their all
I salute those who shot to the stars

We all want to be seen and heard
We all want to leave a mark on this world
Let the thunder and echoes come and go
Embark on a journey, let the magic unfold

A breath of hope it lingers in the air
It's the dawn of a new age, united we stand
I hear midnight bells ringing out a new day
We're dream chasers, out of the ashes we soar

We all want to be seen and heard
We all want to leave a mark on this world
Let the thunder and echoes come and go
Embark on a journey, let the magic unfold
