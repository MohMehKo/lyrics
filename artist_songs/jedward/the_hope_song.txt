Yes you can count on me to always hold your hand
I'll brush off the dust, make you shine again
Oh, we're on a journey to the unknown
Have a little hope, have a little hope

Come on dare to imagine all that you could be
And discover a world of possibility
Oh, with spirits like ours we'll rewrite the rules
We've got a trail of sparks, believe in miracles

Come on now!
Have a little hope (Have a little hope)
When the world gets cold (When the world gets cold)
Don't ever lose your soul (Don't lose your soul)
Have a little hope, have a little hope

Have a little hope (Have a little hope)
When the world gets cold (When the world gets cold)
Don't ever lose your soul (Don't lose your soul)
Have a little hope, have a little hope

Have a little hope (Have a little hope)
When the world gets cold (When the world gets cold)
Don't ever lose your soul (Don't lose your soul)
Have a little hope, have a little hope

Go and find your purpose, let your mind run free
All the magic is waiting, jump the boundaries
Oh, from A to Z you're gonna see it all
You've got to live, love and dream, you're not invisible

Come on now!
Have a little hope (Have a little hope)
When the world gets cold (When the world gets cold)
Don't ever lose your soul (Don't lose your soul)
Have a little hope, have a little hope

Have a little hope (Have a little hope)
When the world gets cold (When the world gets cold)
Don't ever lose your soul (Don't lose your soul)
Have a little hope, have a little hope

Have a little hope (Have a little hope)
When the world gets cold (When the world gets cold)
Don't ever lose your soul (Don't lose your soul)
Have a little hope, have a little hope

And like a dandelion, you can blow in the wind
Build enough momentum to the promised land
Come on, hit the road, accelerate with speed
You were built for this, claim your destiny

Have a little hope (Have a little hope)
When the world gets cold (When the world gets cold)
Don't ever lose your soul (Don't lose your soul)
Have a little hope, have a little hope

Have a little hope (Have a little hope)
When the world gets cold (When the world gets cold)
Don't ever lose your soul (Don't lose your soul)
Have a little hope, have a little hope

Have a little hope (Have a little hope)
When the world gets cold (When the world gets cold)
Don't ever lose your soul (Don't lose your soul)
Have a little hope, have a little hope

Come on now!
