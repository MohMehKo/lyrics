Only a flame could light me up,
She ignited a spark then my heart sets off,
She took me higher than I've been before, 
The girls a free spirit.

We came from different worlds but we found each other,
Somehow stars brought us closer together,
Her character exploded like fireworks,
That girls a free spirit.

Nothing can get her down,
No barriers can stop her now,
She's got the power in her heart,
The girls a free spirit.

There's something about those eyes,
The girls a free spirit,
I see the hope in her heart, 
The girls a free spirit,
Always stands for what she believes,
The girls a free spirit,
Everything I wish for and more,
The girls a free spirit.

Like a butterfly she represents freedom,
Oh making my soul now I feel reborn,
I see her mix it up when she walks in the room,
The girls a free spirit.

When it comes to love she takes that chance, 
You will never see her giving up,
She lives in the moment doesn't need to impress,
That girls a free spirit.

She's all the things love should be,
Not a day goes by that I don't think of her,
She's living outside the box,
The girls a free spirit.

There's something about those eyes,
The girls a free spirit,

The girls a free spirit,
Always stands for what she believes,
The girls a free spirit,
Everything I wish for and more,
The girls a free spirit.
