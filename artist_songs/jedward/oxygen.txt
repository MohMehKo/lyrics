Through your skin I see gold radiating
The most perfect thing, you make me feel the same
Now let me celebrate all your existence
'Cause you heal my scars, you gave me a reason

'Cause tonight my world came crashing down
There was no helpline to be found
Only you were there with open arms
Now I'll sing it to world, you're my oxygen
Oxygen... oxygen...

'Cause tonight my world came crashing down
There was no helpline to be found
Only you were there with open arms
Now I'll sing it to world, you're my oxygen
Oxygen... oxygen...

Now your healing powers helped defuse the bomb
I'm forever grateful, you helped me win the war
I feel my heart beat stronger than it did before
And I don't got a death wish, I want to live for sure

'Cause tonight my world came crashing down
There was no helpline to be found
Only you were there with open arms
Now I'll sing it to world, you're my oxygen
Oxygen... oxygen...

'Cause tonight my world came crashing down
There was no helpline to be found
Only you were there with open arms
Now I'll sing it to world, you're my oxygen
