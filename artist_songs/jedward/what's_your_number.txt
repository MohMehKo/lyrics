We only got tonight so we might as well live it
Time is moving fast so we better roll with it
And who knows where we'll wake up when the party ends
Cause tomorrow we'll be doing it all over again

We got our speakers fuzzing loud cause they're on full blast
Look- looking at ya pretty girl as I drive on past
I bet your mama told you stay away from boys like me
But what she doesn't know is things about to get messy

Tear it up now
Let's get crazy
Bring the roof down
Tonight we can be superstars

Hey girl
What's your name, what's your number
Do you have a boyfriend, you look like you need one
Hey girl
It's OK, it's OK
Just make him your ex and I can be your next one
Ooo woo what's your number girl
Ooo woo

Give me your digits pretty please can you tag me in a picture
And make your status read, yeah I wanna get with ya
I couldn't give a shhh about ya history
Cause all I care about right now is you and me

Tear it up now
Let's get crazy
Bring the roof down
Tonight we can be superstars

Hey girl
What's your name, what's your number
Do you have a boyfriend, you look like you need one
Hey girl
It's OK, it's OK
Just make him your ex and I can be your next one
Ooo woo what's your number girl
Ooo woo

I'm getting tired just imagining
Take my phone, tap your number in
Don't leave me hanging without anything
Yeah yeah yeah

Hey girl
What's your name, what's your number
Do you have a boyfriend, you look like you need one
Hey girl
It's OK, it's OK
Just make him your ex and I can be your next one
