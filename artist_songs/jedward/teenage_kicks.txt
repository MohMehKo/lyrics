Are teenage dreams so hard to beat
Everytime she walks down the street
Another girl in the neighbourhood
Wish she was mine, she looks so good

I wanna hold you wanna hold you tight
Get teenage kicks right through the night

come on

I’m gonna call her on the telephone
Have her over ’cause i’m all alone
I need excitement oh i need it bad
And she’s the best, i’ve ever had

I wanna hold you wanna hold you tight
Get teenage kicks right through the night
come on

I wanna hold you wanna hold you tight
Get teenage kicks right through the night

Are teenage dreams so hard to beat

Get teenage kicks right through the night
come on

I wanna hold you wanna hold you tight
Get teenage kicks right through the night
come on
