[James:]
Can we locate where we went wrong?
It's driving me crazy
It's tiring daily

[Reece:]
Though she tries her best to stay strong,
Feeling so guilty
Just want to be guilt free

[Tom:]
But,
If you save me now
You can brave the doubt
You can pull me out
'Cus darling I have been

[All:]
Crying on my bedroom floor
Wishing I was still in your arms
'Cus there I always seemed so sure
That you love me, that you love me so
Hey hey hey hey hey
That you love me so
Oh oh oh oh oh

[Jake:]
I've lost all belief in this love I've been seeking
And babe metaphorically speaking I'm bleeding
I've always said what's on my mind
I ain't just loosing it all the time

[Jake / Reece:]
I need my head screwed on I need my heart to beat
If I'm to have a chance of you being here with me

[Jake:]
Never thought I'd leave my guard so down
Never thought I'd leave it open
Never thought I'd let you in and allow my naive heart to be broken

[Jake / Reece:]
Cus to fall in love is to fall so hard
When you hit the ground you forget who you are

[Jake / All / Tom:]
I'm feeling so sore (so sore)
I've never hurt more (hurt more)
Then you walked out the door
And ever since then I've been crying on my bedroom floor

[All:]
Crying on my bedroom floor
Wishing I was still in your arms
There I always seemed so sure
That you love me, that you love me so
Hey hey hey hey hey
That you love me so
Oh oh oh oh oh

[James:]
I tried my best to understand
What makes a man
Is it the path where he began
Or the one where he stands now, now

[Tom:]
'Cause I've been crying on my bedroom floor
Wishing I was still in your arms
'Cause there I always seemed so sure

[James:]
That you love me, that you love me so

[All:]
Crying on my bedroom floor
Wishing I was still in your arms (yeah)
There I always seemed so sure
That you love me, that you love me so
Hey hey hey hey hey
That you love me so
Oh oh oh oh oh
That you love me so
Hey hey hey hey hey
That you love me so
Oh oh oh oh oh
