hey yea
will I close my eyes
will I hold my breath
will I wanna cry
will our souls connect?
I've been thinking about it when I go to bed at night I wonder wonder

will you hold my hand
will you speak of love
will the stars be shining in the sky above
will it be your love I've been dreaming of
for so long holding on

Our first kiss wont be the last
Our loves too deep to end that fast and good things come to those who have to wait
I belive it's only time that keeps us from the thing divine, and when it's here
you know I'm gonna say
lay it on my lips

will it taste like candy
will it be that sweet
will our hearts be racing to a heavenly beat
will the moment sweep me off my feet, and draw me under - under!

will I tremble - tremble?
will I beg for more?
will it be like anything I never felt before?
Will we be down for a little more one thing I - I know for sure

Our first kiss wont be the last
Our loves too deep to end that fast and good things come to those who have to wait
I belive it's only time that keeps us from the thing divine, and when it's here
you know I'm gonna say
lay it on my lips

Our first kiss wont be the last
Our loves too deep to end that fast and good things come to those who have to wait
I belive it's only time that keeps us from the thing divine, and when it's here
you know I'm gonna say

gonna say now
I can picture it all, inside my head
just how it's going to feel
but a girl can only dream so much
now she wants to make it real - make it real!
