I hear the train all night
Sound of it's wind blowing through our subtle lives
And I have a job to do walking these cars
Walking all this sleep to get to you
But I don't feel you stir beside me
And you're not in my morning hours

Some ties are made to break
Some stalks grow high and green to rot away
And feel the weight

And these lines tell a truth
These city veins answer all we do
So could you keep me in the pulses
Could you keep me in the sound

I got wise and I got old
Not once, not once did I fold
So don't you now

Maybe you bet on me
While we were still young enough to know
What to believe

For every year you took
For every soft breath or loving look
Believe me

And don't keep me like you have me
And don't kiss me like you don't

I got wise and I got old
Not once, not once did I fall
So don't you now

Some land holds a home
Some of my years only hold me to roam
But I tell myself it's true
You see a home you see a man
You see it too

And I say "Don't you know you have her
Go on kiss her now you boy."

I got wise and I got old
Not once, not once did I fall
So don't you now

I got wise and I got old
Not once, not once did I fall
So don't you now
