If I came to you in thunder
Not one shiver in my heart
Black as crow against the white lies of the morning
Trying to tell themselves apart
All apart, all apart

And if it's everything you're waiting on
I know that's easy to do
If your light is shining in another's arms
I can't say it isn't true
It isn't true, it isn't true

But just to see the sky split its arms open wide
It was enough

If I came to you in sunlight
Not one reason in my heart
Like the colors sleeping underneath your garden
Trying to grow themselves apart
All apart, all apart

And for every year just wondering
If I could ever fall enough
If I had grabbed your hand in thunder
While everything was struck
While I was struck, I was struck
While I was struck, I was struck

But just to see the milk of stars right through your eyes
It was enough
