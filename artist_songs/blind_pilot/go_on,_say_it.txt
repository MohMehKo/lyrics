Picking up sound on the interstate
I am my breath
letting in waves.

there will be time when the sleep I'm in
covers me cold
covers me thin

I know I'll wake up old,
forgetting which box this is in.
How I will keep you,
uh huh...uh huh
uh huh...uh huh
just how I left you.

Our daughter once told me I know a lot
now I'm strutting off with more than I've got
A hitchhiker told me I don't talk a lot
Made me feel fine,
made me quiet.

If you had said it right
instead of painting words white...
How I would keep you 
uh huh...uh huh
uh huh...uh huh
just how I left you.
uh huh...uh huh
Come on say it right.
uh huh...uh huh
Come on say it right.  Come on say it right.
Come on say it right.  Come on say it right.
Come on say it right.  Come on say it right.
Come on say it right.
