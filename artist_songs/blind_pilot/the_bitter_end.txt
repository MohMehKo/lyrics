if ever you should die I know I'll shave my head
its not a morbid thought, I mean it out of love

come back daddy
come back to the bitter end
come back daddy
hounds-tooth coats and vitamins.

if ever the sea claims the cities on the coast
before the last bridge blows I know I will propose

come back baby
armed with paddles in your hands
come back baby
come back to the bitter end

the soil on the spade will be my love and hurt
the cellphone satellites will hurl to the earth
to the earth

but in the moon 
there is half of our shadow on
from in the womb 
there are strange sounds on the water front
and it takes a monk 
to lose it all

come back baby
come back to the bitter end
come back everything that caught up in the plans

come back baby
come back to the bitter end
come back everything that put salt in the sand
