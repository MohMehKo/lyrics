It was a wild idea to start
We were lost in an hour, every thinking part
In the middle of nowhere
Oh man hey look where we are

I know your teeth are shut and proud
But there are rhythms in the city make your head feel loud
Uh-huh so get it out, get it out

You are a long ways up river from home
Right here this water is mean but its the same as your own
You better swim for your life
It's both at the same time

It was a wild idea to start
A drip on the head got it wet in the heart
And it looked just like a river but was a freeway in the dark
Oh in the dark
Oh you're always so damn ready oh
Oh were you always so damn ready oh
I never want to call it off
I never want to call it off oh
Never been that ready
I never want to call it off
I never want to call it off oh
I've never been this ready
In my life
