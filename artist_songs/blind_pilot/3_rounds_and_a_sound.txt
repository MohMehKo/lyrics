They're playing our song
They're playing our song
Can you see the lights?
Can you hear the hum, 
of our song?

I hope they get it right
I hope we dance tonight
Before we, get it wrong

And the seasons
Will change us new
But you're the best I've known
and you know me
I could not be stuck on you
If it weren't true

I was swimming
My eyes were dark
'til you woke me
And told me that opening
is just the start
It was

Now I see you, 'til kingdom come
You're the one I want
to see me for all 
the stupid shit I've done

Soil and six feet under,
Kept just like we were
Before you knew you'd know me
and you know me

Blooming up from the ground
3 rounds and a sound
Like whispering "you know me.
You know me."

So this was our song
This was our song.
I still see the lights
I can see them

And the crisscross
Of what is true, won't get to us
'Cause you know me-
I could not give up on you...

And the fog of 
what is right
Won't cover us 
'cause you know me-
I could not give up a fight...

Soil and six feet under
(Crisscross of what is true, won't get to us)
Kept just like we were
(Cause you know me. I could not give up on you)
Before you knew you'd know me
(But you feel the truth)
And you know me

Blooming up from the ground
(And the fog of what is right won't cover us)
3 rounds and a sound
(Cause you know me, I could not give up a fight)
Like whispering "you know me
(But you feel right)
You know me."
