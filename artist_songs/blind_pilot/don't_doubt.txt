Now you don't have a word to call this kind
Of the year made you new and beg it to turn you right
Two dead birds underneath the headlights
Every sound they ever made to call out they are alive
Every piece of me that breaks tryin' to keep from the sight
Of doubt

Don't you doubt
Everybody's seen some winter
Don't you take the dark way out
Don't you doubt
Even your breath is breathin' for another one
Don't you just take the dark way out

Thin wind ringin' in the silver tines
Yeah it took you by the throat but it wasn't the killin' kind
Now you don't tell it like you used to
Every day left in the dark is gonna come back to you
Every hope left in your heart is waitin' on what you'll do
With doubt

Don't you doubt
Everybody's seen some winter
Don't you take the dark way out
Don't you doubt
Even your blood is beatin' for another one
Don't you just take the dark way out

Don't you doubt
Doubt
The reasons are dead and they're growin' in the ground so why does it give why'd it take
Why to've been kissed
Why be mean why be anything
Just be the man, be the child, be the cold midnight soaked in the bones of this town
In the breath in the pink
In the honey taken from that green thing given sweet
In the cold in the pour
In the want in the wantin' the sound even your own body knows
All there is
See the gem
Your hands are lined with all that they ever have
