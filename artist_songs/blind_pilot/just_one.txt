Let all things be as they should.
Let my heart just drift like wood.
And will I break and will I bow,
if I cannot let it go?

Feel that sun just hold you right, 
leave you burning down the night.
Feel that wind lap up your soul
if you cannot let it go.
If I cannot let it go.

Born in with a reason,
blown out like a ghost.
We came with our best lines,
told them like jokes.
If I could have known then
we were dying to get gone...
I can't believe we get just one.

And when your thirst can come to me
I am a river for the sea.
When you can hold me in your sway,
I'll give myself away.
Will I give myself away?

Born in with a reason,
blown out like a ghost.
We came with our best lines,
told them like jokes.
If I could have known then
we were dying to get gone...

I can't believe we get just one.
I can't believe we get just one.
I can't believe we get just one.
I can't believe we get just one.

Let all things be as they will. 
Let my heart beat itself still.
