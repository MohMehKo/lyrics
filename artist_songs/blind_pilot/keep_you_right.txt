These stars wash over me, so far away that I can barely breathe, from where I lay
Never have I been so far from home o'er the years I was cut from sand and rain

I'm calling through ebb and flow; I'm calling whichever way it goes

Desert rock and rosemary carry dry and bloodless on the breeze, make me new
Blow into my face again, blow between the bones that shake and knock me through and through

I've been away so long and lost you my love the song and sight
You give me anything you want to I'm bound to keep you right
Ooohhh to keep you right

My heart longs for too much, mine eyes have hardly seen enough to know it's need
Never does it stop or slow I press my ear against the ground to know the song it sings

I'm calling, fear running through; I'm calling what more can I do
Tell me what more can I do

I've been away so long and lost you my love, the song inside
You give me anything you want to now I'm bound to keep you right
You give me anything you want to now I'm bound to keep you right
Oh to keep you right
