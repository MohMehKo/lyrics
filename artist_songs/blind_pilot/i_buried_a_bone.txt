I buried a bone 
and darling you don't know him
darling you don't know him
darling you don't know

and just where you are
might be the right place
it might be that sweet space
but you don't know

now look me in the head
I've got nothing on my mind
I've been waiting for you 
all this time

and I'd seen a path turn to an old road
but the secret's too slow
and we're too fast

look me in the mouth
I've got nothing in my smile
I've been waiting for you
you're just my style

look me in the gut
I've got fear for my own name
I'd dig it up for you 
if you'd do the same

I buried a bone 
and darling you don't know him
darling you don't know him
darling you don't know
