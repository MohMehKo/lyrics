Seeing is believing
How many moons has that darkness hid?
All my good friends
All my dead ends
Some to think and some to forgive

Oh my father,
I've got your fever
I'm holding my breath in
Your wishing well
This is just time's thirst
This is just everything hurts
You feel your own breath
The rest is hard to tell

It's gonna lift your eyes up
All you haven't seen just yet
All you're holding to be
It's gonna lift, you rise up
No, it's not a lot to hold
But this life is gonna make you believe
Oh I know it will

Seeing is believing
How many moons has our own darkness hid?
Hear the train brakes
Hear all your old voices shake
As you are saying it right now, just like it is

It's gonna lift your eyes up
Al you haven't seen just yet
All you're holding to be
It's gonna lift, you rise up
No, it's not a lot to hold
But this life is gonna make you believe
Oh, this life is gonna make you believe
Oh, this life is gonna make you believe
Oh, I know it will, I know it will, I know it will
