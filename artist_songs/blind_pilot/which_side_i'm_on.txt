Even the robin that cuts the dawn
Even his sound knows which side he's on
Nothing that stays where it has been
in the black
And the light is a candle on my screen
Flickers the real love the same old dream
Holding me in this middle moon
Looking back

I won't let it drink me down
Like a secret
I won't give in any more
Than I've given
No matter how or hard enough
I'm still gonna drink from that broken cup
Ya it knows which side I'm on

I have done wrong I've done wrong I've done wrong
and that weight will follow me
But that weight is the world's
The world's not mine
It is the place where I am
And I have lost I have lost I've lost
and that won't let go of me
But that story's not me
It's just who I can't change
And not who I can

I don't see the desert for its sand
I don't see the water for dry land
All that I love has turned to fuel for the fire
It's gonna burn me with its touch
It's gonna fill my loving cup
It knows which side I'm on

I have done wrong I've done wrong I've done wrong
and that weight will follow me
But that weight is the world's
The world's not mine
It is the place where I am
And I have lost, I have lost, I've lost
and that won't let go of me
But that story's not me
It's who I can't change
And not who I can

That story's not me
It's who I can't change
and not who I can
No that story's not me
it's just who I can't change
and not who I am

Oh! Oh it keeps me from
Oh! Oh it keeps me from
Oh! Oh it keeps me from
