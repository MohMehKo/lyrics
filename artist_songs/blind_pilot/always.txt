Holy road we are on tonight
Catch as catch can till we get it right
Always... in this dark light
Always.

Tell me more than what you can guess
Feel like thunder then quick to forget
Always looking for what is not yet
Always.

Oooohh... 

Lock the keys in my house tonight
Hit the steps for the morning light
Always looking for a new light
Always.
