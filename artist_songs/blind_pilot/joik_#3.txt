Blessed with your line, you are blessed at the hook
That is pulling at all yet revealed
You don't aim to shoot, you don't aim to win
You just know the way there by feel

For all you could have been
And who you are still
For all you could have been
And who you are

One hand on your faith, one hand on a color
That pulls the whole world to your heart
And I'm wanting to hold all that I still know in you
While this is still who we are

To know just where you are
And where you're not this far
To know just where you are
And where you're not

Cut from a hope, we're cut from the same metal
That blooms its veins in the ground
I have loved you in the body, in the breath, in the eyes
In the air still speaking your sound

Don't know just where you are
And where you're not now
Don't know just where you are
And where you're not now
To know just where you are
And where you're not now
To know just where you are
And where you're not
