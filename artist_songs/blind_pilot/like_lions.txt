(One, two, three...)

There are those among us willing
To get by on anything
Hollow hope of what is coming
A lifetime dangled by a string

But this ocean dives so deeply
And this river runs so wide
I won't be counted one among them
Until my soul is satisfied

Brick and brick of buried hunger
Keeping all desire dark
And then we are like lions
We are tearing it apart

There are those among us lying
Saying nothing is for free
And then we are like lions
And we will not leave until we eat

Playing kings and playing peasants
Do we get what we are owed
An eagle comes and talks of failure
A rabbit offers up its throat

Will they buy even our breathing
A river strangled by a dam
Less than one percent are taken
So tell me who dries up this land

Is it worse to see no future
Is it worse to be afraid
And then we are like lions
Pumping fire in our veins

We are born with a perfect hunger
We are born with a perfect need
And then we are like lions
And we are bearing all our teeth

It is coming down the mountain
Fear that hoards you like a cold
It wants to settle in your footprints
Keep you still from where you're going

Aw, you think you know of losing
Aw, you doubt of innocence
That big sky still hangs above you
Every day just wants to quit

There's no light you see to guide you
And it scares you just the same
And then we are like lions
Nothing dares get in our way

See your faithless sails drifting
And your truth just cut apart
And then we are like lions
We are golden in our hearts

And then we are like lions
We are standing on two feet
Hanging on the kitchen wall
For everyone to see
Get out your banjo
So we can sing

There are winds that wrap and hold me
There are whispers in the trees
I cannot hold all that is sacred
They are holding onto me

Kiss the years that all are dying
Kiss the face that makes you stay
They are in your rhythms walking
They are showing you the way

Breath and breath above a sickness
Shouting threats upon your life
And then we are like lions
We are fool enough to fight

It will cheat you in the balance
Taking more than left to live
And then we are like lions
We are strong enough to give

And then we are like lions
We are strong enough to give
