I’ll open my eyes and a new day will come
I’ll see red colored stars in the sky and in your eyes
Fast away the ugly, just one more bill to pay
All the past will be moon dust that flies, from where we lay
I can feel it, I can feel

Red colored stars in my hands were the stones that were cast
They left us scars, reminders

There’s a wall in my way, there’s a war in my way
Tales of love that consumed me
Hide from the light
I’m a slave in my head, I’m awake in my bed
Tell the worms they can soon eat tonight, eat tonight

I can feel red colored stars in my hands were the stones that were cast
They left us scars, reminders
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?

Sleep. There’s a wall in my way. There’s a war in my way
Sleep. There’s a wall in my way. There’s a war in my head
Start our cars and be around
There’s room enough for you and me
When the sun comes up, we’ll leave them down and stare into the dream

I can feel red colored stars in my hands were the stones that were cast
They left us scars, reminders
I can feel it, I can feel it, I can feel it, I can feel it
