Did you know?
Your eyes have a glow that send mine down to the pavement
Mine down to the pavement
Since you're gone
The words have all come
And we sing like it's contagious
Sing like it's contagious

I feel like I'm living
I feel like a baby
And I feel everything for the first time in my life

If the sun was aching for soul
It would light up when you wake and find us in a daze
With the words all wrong
We still sing along

I feel like I'm living
I feel like a baby
And I feel everything for the first time in my life

I realize I'm slipping
And I realize I'm crazy
And I feel everything for the first time in my life

I hear a saint down the hall
He sings to us all
And it rings out loud

I feel like I'm living
And I feel like a baby
And I feel everything for the first time in my life

So we'll leave the ones who've hated
And we'll grieve the ones who didn't make it
And we'll breathe from what's created
All of our lives
