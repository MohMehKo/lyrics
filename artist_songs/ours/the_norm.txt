And we might just walk in circles
And your eyes try to observe me
And your hands a desert play thing
Just to try to make your words seem
Plant my roots before they're dry
Give to me in time a life

And give me a little bit of the norm
A little bit of the norm
A little bit of the norm

Now the bitch is right before you
And the smell just might absorb you
But a bitch is what you made it
Here's a chance to rearrange it
Make the face of one who cares
Enter drunk but still be there

Just give me a little bit of the norm
A little bit of the norm
A little bit of the norm
A little bit of the norm

Feel me but don't lean on me
It's soothing, it's a real wet dream
Sleazy and sometimes obscene
Learn what is meant to be

Evil face but pleasant thoughts
Scared before but now it's gone

A little bit of the norm
A little bit of the norm
A little bit of the norm
