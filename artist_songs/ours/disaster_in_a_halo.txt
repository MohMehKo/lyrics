Lately I’ve been thinking about what you said
Time is growing old and I am getting colder
Hunger’s just a pain that won’t be fed
I’ll be working for the ghost until I’m dead and done

Disaster in a halo
Nothing even matters, nothing even matters, nothing even matters
Nothing even matters, nothing even matters, nothing even matters

Somewhere there’s a girl with thoughts of him
She makes wishes in a well then fears them caving in on her, around, on her

Disaster in a halo
Nothing even matters, nothing even matters, nothing even matters
Nothing even matters, nothing even matters, nothing even matters

‘Cause in the well, plans will come and plans will go undone
I know, I know
And you can’t tell, I will come and I will go and I know, I know
But why would I?
But why would I?

Disaster in a halo
Nothing even matters, nothing even matters, nothing even matters
Nothing even matters, nothing even matters, nothing even matters
