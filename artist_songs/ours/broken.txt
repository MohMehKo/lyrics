It's not your fault
They pushed you too far
And all of your thoughts
Came apart within so
They pushed you too hard
They pushed you too far
Fate comes, and fate heals all the worst of our debts
There's a broken man inside
There's a broken man inside
He'll break [x6]
The styles are gonna change
Time will go away
The styles are gonna change, but I won't
If I could find a way
I'd suffer all of your pain
Time will go away, but I won't
