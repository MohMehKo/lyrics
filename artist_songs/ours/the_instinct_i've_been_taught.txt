And the government said it'll be fine
But the people say we've gone to far this time
They keep on showing me signs
They've taken my family now they're taking over
They've taken hearts and sold them
They'll take your child and mold him
Fill him with with rage
Rage turns to pain 
And then he starts hurting someone
Not thinking about time
Not thinking about life
And I don't know how, they take someone from us
But leave us with the pain
There's something tearing me apart
Telling me to stop this hate I've known so long
Till something makes me change my mind
I'll be at the point where there is nothing 
But to do what I feel
Right now I feel pain
So make them feel my
Make them feel my pain
I feel hatred, they see a lover
I feel hatred towards another
I feel hatred they see a lover
I feel hatred...
There's something tearing me apart
Telling me to stop this hate I've known so long
Till something makes me change my mind
I'll be at the point where there is nothing 
But to do with ideal
And right now I feel pain
So make them feel my
Make them feel my pain
My pain
Make them feel my
Make them feel my
Make them feel my pain
And the government says it'll be fine
But they say we've gone to far this time
They keep on showing me signs
They've taken my family now they're taking over
