pressure fried the coldest head
bent to the side wishing he was dead
and i would still defend
i would still defend

i give up on it all
i give up on the greed
i give up  on the ones
who give up on me

held up by the poor somewhere
there're unaware but i know we are scared
if i was to give in
the fight would soon begin

so i give up on it all
i give up on the greed
i'll give up on the ones
who'll give up on me

sometimes sunshines
sunshine
sometimes the sun shines
sunshine

did you give up on it all
did you give up on the greed
did you give up on the  ones
who gave up on me
