Flowers for a girl who was placed in the dark
Flowers from a world that had taken her heart
They looked so pretty, but the blood stained them

If flowers turn
Throw them away, throw them away
If flowers turn
Throw them away, throw them away

Pull the braids, untie the pain from your hair
Don’t let the buzzards try or they’ll take what’s been there
Signs appear, and the worst you fear

If flowers turn
Throw them away, throw them away
If flowers turn
Throw them away, throw them away

Don’t look to the dark, all the pain that you want is here
Uncover your heart so the feeling can disappear
The worst winds are calling, they need you they want you
I’m in the dark and I can’t see a thing for miles

If flowers turn
Throw them away, throw them away
If flowers turn
Throw them away, throw them away

I know I’ve seen the pain in your heart
Because I died for us
