In his heart he's thinking that he's Ours
Teach him to be Ours
In his heart he couldn't ever find
'cause he might take his life
Teach him to be Ours

[chorus]
We went blind
Waiting for a sign, just waiting for a sign
Couldn't see and dying
Waiting for a sign, just waiting for a sign

It's hard pretending that it's not
Still we're reaching
What do we want?

[chorus]
We went blind 
Waiting for a sign, just waiting for a sign
Could'nt sleep and dying
Waiting for a sign, just waiting for a sign

Mercy for the meek
Mercy for the meek
Mercy for the meek

Mercy for the meek, i won't let you go...
I won't leave you now
