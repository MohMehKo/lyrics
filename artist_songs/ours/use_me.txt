You and me
Think we are perfect
You hit me
And said that I deserved it
Feel me
Wear me
Use me
You and me
Spent our lives learning
How to be and what to be
Was it all worth it?
Feel me
Wear me
Use me
Hurt me
Can't see
I'm tired, again
You and me
Think we are perfect
You said you'd kill
You'd kill for me
And swear that I'm most worth it
Do you really wanna know?
Feel me
Wear me
Use me
Hurt me
Can't see
I'm tired, again
