I'm paralyzed from head down
Realized pushing their doubts
I'm burned by all the fire
Thats spread within my house
You put them there so you can put them out

When courage strikes we'll come out
And wait around with our heads down
Turn me to the sky, turn me upside down
A way to feel alive, a life thats mine

Cause I am like a big strong cable
I am like a girl so soft inside
Finally today I'm able
To put you in the ground
I'll meet you in the ground

The mirror fell and I
I may as well have been blind
The days passing like cars
I'll meet you in the tower
If they can dream then
Oh why can't I?

[chorus]

I've finally stablized [2]
Everyone will see [2]
