Tied down to the things that we can't let go of
Realized too many dreams we can't recover
We layed down in our sleep and began to choke
We layed down in a dream and we never woke
Life doesn't have any meaning everything's a joke
Been eating out of your hands, with never anything to show
We tried to get off clean, but we would never grow
Prison can't be worse than living with the pain of knowing

Murder, murder, murder, murder

We fight about the things we never even had control of
In and out of thoughts so many different people bought
Self serving ramblings in your favorite journal
Won't bring you peace until you learn to read yourself

Murder, murder, murder, murder, murder

Bow down to the things that you can't let go of
Eating out of dog's hands with never anything to show
Even if it hurt to love you couldn't leave it slowly
Slipping from your core as you're waiting for your dream to come

Murder, murder

Give in the things you bought with
Give in the things you bought with
Give in the things you bought with
Give in the things you bought with

Murder
Give in the things you bought with
Murder
Give in the things you bought with
Murder
Give in the things you bought with
Murder
Give in the things you bought with your life
