I was plagued by indecision
Pushed my heart into the black
I was looking for forgiveness
And tired of looking back
Always seemed to be collisions
Between my body, mind, and soul
But you changed my disposition
Pulled me out of the hole

You carried me over mountains
Carried me to the shore
Holding my hand...

Out by nowhere is a station
Where the lonely get on track
You can hear the whistle blowing
But it never echoes back
I was kissed under a dying tree
Where the souls laid underground
And the more you feel, the more you fear
what comes around

You carried me over mountains
Carried me to the shore
Holding my hand
There till the end

You carried me over mountains
Carried me to the shore
Holding my hand
There till the end

I've got myself in the middle of
A place I never dreamed of
I wonder how it began
Drifting so far from the shore
Hey! Oh Yeah!

Your lips are glowing now
The trees are falling down
Bathing in the simple light
Imagination comes to life

When we were young
We could dream that all of the
Pain would be gone
So dream and know that...

It only makes you stronger [x3]
