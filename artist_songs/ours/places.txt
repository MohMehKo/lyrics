Past love died, as she cried, I saw beauty
Girls wished for boys and scared them away
As I saw beauty

Alright, alright
My feet keep on taking me back, back, back to those places
Alright, alright
My knees keep on shaking from fright, fright, fright

Scared and cold, now you're old
Time thaws, but you'll break
There's a hole in my soul
How much more will it take?

Alright, alright
My feet keep on taking me back, back, back to those places
Alright, alright
My knees keep on shaking from fright, fright, fright

I saw, I saw
And it moved all of the gray aside
I saw, I saw
It moved all of the gray aside

Alright, alright
My feet keep on taking me back, back, back to those places
Alright, alright
My knees keep on shaking from fright, fright, fright
