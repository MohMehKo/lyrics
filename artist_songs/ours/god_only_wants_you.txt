Can you see?
God only wants you to
God only wants you to be
God only wants you
Can you feel?
God only wants you to
God only wants you to dream
God only wants you

Forever, Forever, Forever, Forever, Forever, Forever came and it seemed so hopeless

Can't you see
I only wanted you?
I only wanted you for me
I only want me
Could it be
If I was the only?
If I was the only for you
If I wasn't all in me

Forever, Forever, Forever, Forever, Forever, Forever came and it seemed so hopeless

Can you see?

God only wants you to
God only wants you to be
God only wants you
