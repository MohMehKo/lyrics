There were times I betrayed what was sacred to myself and lost.
Over lines I'm ashamed of the things that I had done and crossed.
I was so fast to run when doubt had come
So fast to run, so fast to run.

We didn't know
We didn't know
We want love
We want love
We didn't know
We didn't know

So many times when I gave I was faking and I felt so lone.

I'm a monster, I'm an adict, I'm a danger to myself, I know.

We didn't know

We want love
We want love
We didn't know
We didn't know
We want love
We want love

Can we take another round?
Can we take another round of love..
Without the guns?
Can we take another round?

We didn't know
We didn't know
We want love
We want love
We didn't know
We didn't know
We want love
We want love

I'm willing to listen
I'm willing to say
I'm willing to try or throw it all away
Do we throw it all behind?
Throw it

On a dime life can change
Everything that you once loved you've lost
I'll tell you why I'm afraid with the symptoms
I've been making up

We didn't know
We didn't know
We want love
We want love
Willing and now
Willing and now
We want love
We want love

Can we take another round?
can we take another round of love..
Without the gun?
Can we take another round?
