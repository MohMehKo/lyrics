Try tracing tear it all apart, go back dear
The water face said
"I could never be like you"
I don't want to steal
Jeopardize the things I've got for now
I don't want to feel
Demolition, a generation
So revelation so one relation
If they hear some mother scream out
Help me with my child
Help me cause he's bleeding
And his head is ripped apart
I'm not racist
I'm prejudiced, it sounds like you are too
But even they said
Well I used to be that way too, yeah
Yeah
I thought that they would feel
I thought that they would listen to me then
I thought that they would see
Slow down, relax
Take the world off your shoulders
Time slips away
Now you're another day older, another day older
Another day older
Another day older
Another day
Demolition, a generation
So revelation so one relation
And you hear some mother screaming
Help me with my child
Help me cause he's bleeding
I guess that's all they know
I guess that's all they
I guess that's all they
I guess that's all they
All they
I guess that's all they...
