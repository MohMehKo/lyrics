Pray, i don't know if it's sacred, or not
you say, that we can fall apart at anytime
breathe for the whole world...we can't fight
they starve for the love...that we supply
feed from their eyes, dream you're alive, and feel feel
the beast flies tonight, and the world he describes
suffer...suffer

Afraid, i don't know if we're heading for a fall
you jump into the front to say you're apart of it all
feed from their eyes, dream your alive, and feel feel
the beast flies tonight, and the world he describes
suffer...suffer

if we feed from their eyes, dream we're alive to feel
the beast flies tonight, the world he describes
suffer...suffer

these are the fallen souls
