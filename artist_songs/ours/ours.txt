The walls they've built, we've broken
Watch them fall before her night
Taken our whole family
Built this dumb catastrophe
Never satisfied but keeps it all inside
Eating away at her time
When all we've had was stolen
How could we have never found
They've taken morals, made them wrong
And put them where they don't belong
Never satisfied but keeps it all inside
In his heart, he's thinking that he's ours
Teach him to be ours
In his heart, well he couldn't ever find
'Cause he might take his life
Teach him to be ours
In time
In time we've seen walls getting broken
As I stand here and watch them fall 
Before her eyes
When all that we've had was
All that we've had was stolen
How could we ever find another life?
And then one day all we would find 
That mommy's has finally lost her mind
Never satisfied she keeps it all inside
In his heart he's thinking that he's ours
Teach him to be ours
In his heart well he couldn't ever find 
Cause he might take his life
Teach him to be ours
He might find out 
He might find out
He might find out
He's not ours
Well please don't let him
Please don't let him
Find out
Please don't
Well please don't
He'll take his life
Yeah he'll take his life
If he finds out
If he finds out
If he finds out
He'll take his
He'll take his life
