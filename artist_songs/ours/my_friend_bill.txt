A little man down by the parking lot he said 
"I think the world is out to get me"
Stole my money can't see my way
And left me here with nothing, nothing
Well he left me here with nothing, nothing
Some old jackets wore color all time
Walking around looking for roaches all the time
He says beware of the CIA
Framing you with something
Something
Framing you with something
Something
Father is gone
Mother is gone
They left before I told them it
It hurts in my heart
That they'll never know my pain
That they'll never feel my shame
That they'll never see me again
Now that Bill's become my friend
He's alright
I think he knows the meaning of a friend
Open your mind
And there you will find
Nothing to hide
No reason to run
Father is gone
Mother is gone
They left before I told them it
It hurts in my heart
That they'll never know my pain
That they'll never feel my shame
That they'll never see me again
