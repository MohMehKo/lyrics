The sky was screaming I lost you
I tried, but me what could I do?
Get out the bad undo your head Think about what you say

Kill the band
Kill the band

I was caught dreaming of wealth and What I was taught was creeping in again
They get ahead you get so mad
Why do you care? It's only money
Get out the bad undo your head Think about what you say

Kill the band [X4]

If then it rains, I'll cover your eyes
The past has a way of running our lives
Learning to say the words that we hide

Kill the band [X4]

Pressure's coming, I feel it coming down
Cancer's coming, I feel it coming
