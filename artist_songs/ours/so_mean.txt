He's so mean, he's like a girl
He needs it, but never learns
Run faster you might
Feel it tonight
She's amused, she rolls her eyes
He'll beat her and act like he's blind
Run faster tonight
Feel it you might
Feel it tonight
You'll find your wife
He rolls his eyes
Then he turned white
I trusted and lusted
It was my only one
And now it is gone again
Complaining, I hate him
I am the lonely one
Cause now he is gone again
Look, look at her eyes
Why can't she smile, why can't she smile?
Run faster tonight
Feel it you might
Feel it tonight
You'll find your wife
I trusted, and lusted
It was my only one
But now it is gone again
Complaining, I hate him
I am the lonely one
Cause now he is gone again
Again
Again
Again, yeah
