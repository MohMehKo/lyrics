No one wants to decide the final say?
In my face, in the thought I can't dismay
And we're taught that the ones that fall betrayed
I change but the world is still the same
On the screen, there are roles of sex and pain
And it's true we are taught that's not the way they play
In between contradictions of what we crave
"But the world still revolves" is

Call the thieves outside when friends betray
What's a friend but an ache within my pain?
What's a pain but some glass within a frame?
And the frame of my mind is not the same
On the screen, there are roles of sex and pain
And it's true we are taught that's not the way they play
In between contradictions of what we crave
"But the world still revolves" is
What I say
What I say
You're the lord
Feel desire
Feel the lord
Use desire
See your lord
Take you higher
Steal my soul
His eyes caught fire
See your lord
Feel the lord
Taste your lord
And I'll take you higher
Feel your lord
Feel your lord
On the screen, there are roles of sex and pain
