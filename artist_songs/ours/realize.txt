Anytime, anyplace, come around, go away
There's a sound then it fades, turn it down make it stay
If I could get off the phone I'd deliver the song
But too much is in my way
Like a dog to the bone, a leash to the throne, a laugh within my face
Taking too much air, taking too much air
This is how you care
When you realize you're down, when you realize you're 
Down on the floor with a radio song, you're crawling, you're crawling
Down on the floor with a radio song, Oh
We spent our days in a coma, believing it's over
Outside there's too much hate
Tried to stay on the ball believe in it all, but it bounces in our face
Now we're beginning to crawl, by leaving it all, there's nothing in our way
Breathing out again, breathing out again
When it seems like you can, then you realize you're down
You realize you're
Down on the floor with a radio song, you're crawling, you're crawling
Down on the floor with a radio song, Oh
When you realize you're down, when you realize you're down 
From taking too much air, taking oxygen
We all want love and we all fall
Down on the floor with a radio song, you're crawling, you're crawling 
Down on the floor with a radio song, Oh
