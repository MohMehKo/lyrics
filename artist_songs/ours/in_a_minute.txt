I can be just like the others
I can act just like your brother
I can dress just like your mother
I can be but I don't bother

In a minute, In a minute
I can be these things
In a minute don't you get it
Don't you get it

If I was to be as cruel as I could be
Would you like to still give all of your life to me?

In a minute, In a minute
I can be these things
In a minute don't you get it
Don't you get it

I can be just like the others
I can act just like your brother
I can dress just like your mother
I can be but I don't bother

In a minute, In a minute
I can be these things
In a minute don't you get it
Don't you get it
