Wake me up wise by morning
I want to breath the day
This is my final warning
Keep all the clouds away

We've taken, medication
So we can run away from
Another day

I feel alive, I'm falling
We dance until the morning closed our eyes
I would love to stay here and never have to go
And no one in the world would ever know

[chorus]

We will never, never know, never know
I feel the dream is real, watch it go, go
I blink and then another day is gone
I feel the dream that we've been hiding from

We've taken, medication
So we can run away from
The things that pain us, pain
