The cuts are gonna make you forget years
You married someones carrying your tears
But you sleep with the ones that keep you from all that
You're sad yourself you can't afford to feel

So live again
Live again

The carousel goes down through hell and fear
Forgive yourself and then you're gonna heal

Live again
Live again
Live again
Live again

Now you see that when we were young there was truth and all
That came with
The cuts just leave us there blessing for those
Repeating all of our past
'Till all of its gone
All if it's gone
Again

Live again
Live again
Live again

Now you see that when were young there was truth and all
That came with
The cuts just leave us there bleeding for those
Repeating all of our past
All of it's gone
All love it's gone
Again
