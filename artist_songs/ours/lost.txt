Listen to me
Why am I crying? Why am I dying?
I am not your ladder
You seem to be
Writing a song
Lighting a bomb
But nothing you say matters

All of the time I lost
All of the time I lost
All of the time I lost

It's like a wake it comes in the dark
Shows you your heart
Throws you up and down for
another day
I am the cause, I am the gauze, I am your collateral

All of the time I lost
All of the time I lost
All of the time I lost

Turn in your girls, they'll bring you pain
Either way you feel the same
It's true
Even if you do
Give them your life
They will find other ways to bleed you

All of the time I lost
All of the time I lost
All of the time I lost
Where, where is the love?
Where is the love?
Where is the love you sold to me?
It comes like a bomb
Sounds like a song
Where is the love?

All of the time I lost
All of the time I lost
All of the time I lost

It's bad if I come home
And it's good if I run from
It's bad if I stumble
And it's good if I'm afraid
So it's good if I'm afraid
Of the past, of the lies, of the ways that we tried
All the lies
