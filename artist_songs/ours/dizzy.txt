We ran
We starved the things
That feel
Outback
The drunken waters steal from me

If we beat him down, will he stay?
He's a little dizzy
I feel it starting to take me
Where did everybody go?
I need them now
To save me

We fell, when they choked the things that feed
How come... we hurt the one's we need?
Lay down, and stretch upon the sea

If we beat him down, will he stay?
He's a little dizzy
I feel it starting to take me
Where did everybody go?
I need them now
If we beat him down... will he stay?
