Lies judge when you see him
His thoughts aren't safe
Start once you to besiege him
It seems too easy

I'm an emotional - I'm alright
Don't light a fire 'cause the leaves are dry
I'm all right, no headlights
I'm an emotional wreck sometimes

Twice hardly believes it
Far far too great
Sees himself as a hero
Gods forgotten pain

I'm an emotional - I'm all right
Don't light a fire 'cause the leaves are dry
I'm alright, No headlights
I'm an emotional wreck sometimes

It's a bit of me
passing on the leaf
pressure disagrees
makes me wanna sleep tight...away the time
Thoughts that cannot be
picking off your tree
too much thoughts of me
Where is sublime
A world sublime
Sublime...

I'm an emotional - I'm alright
Don't light a fire 'cause the leaves are dry
I'm all right, No headlights
I'm an emotional wreck sometimes
