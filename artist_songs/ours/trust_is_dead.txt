During her ambition
He would hardly listen
Wouldn't even make a sound
Now he's out to listen
Cause it's open season
Better off more lost than found

Now it's pushed upon me
It might not breathe
But it might harm me, stuck inside
My brains blown out again
Trust is dead

People love confession
And they choose their fashion
Some hard to tell
Some show it well
Oh, he's so dishonest
Broke a silent promise
Didn't care who finds him out

Now it's pushed upon me
It might not breathe
But it might harm me, stuck inside
My brains blown out again
Trust is dead

Now we reek
Of emotion
When we speak
Angry thoughts hurting so deep
We forget about our sign

It's a cheap
Ceremony
And we keep
Up all morning 'til we sleep
For another night

Heard I broke your heart now
It's a brand new start now
Time to rearrange your mood
Time to loosen up now
Show you're not so tough now
Maybe then you'll be alright

Now it's pushed upon me
It might not breathe
But it might harm me, stuck inside
My brains blown out again
Trust is dead
It's dead...
Dead
