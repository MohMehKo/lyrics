They pissed around me and tried to drown me
They wake in panic to a poisoned attic
They wake in panic
The pigs around me will try to drown me

When they teach us, they lead us to doom
Oh Mother don't leave us to bloom
Holy Father those kids have been through
The deepest and meanest of truths

They preached wrong habits and brought us havoc
With their hands around me they fall on one knee to pray
We can't help finally, we can't tell any
By the time they find me I'll be frying

When they teach us, they lead us to doom
Oh Mother don't leave us to bloom
Holy Father those kids have been through
The deepest and meanest of truths

I just fear one day we'll all lose sight of the things that we have in life
That money just can't buy
And we'll try day after day we'll lose our pride, until we're left
With nothing but their Garbage, Garbage

When they teach us they lead us to doom
Oh Mother don't leave us to bloom
Holy Father those kids have been through
The deepest and the meanest
Like fire in the wind it comes around, like dirt in your soul it's gonna come around
Oh it's gonna come around, I'm gonna be there to pull you down, Oh, OH
