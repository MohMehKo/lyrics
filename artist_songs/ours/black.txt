So many lives I've confessed
So many lives made a mess
Pushed it all into something
Pushed it all

[chorus]
You turned and everything went black
You turned and everything went black

Wouldn't have tried to compete
Wouldn't have lied but to keep
Something told me you'd hurt me
Somethings hold
Back

[chorus]
You turned and everything went black
Turned and everything went black

You pushed it all so you'd never see it
You pushed it all...
Laughing and
You're pulling strings
Dancing on the souls of the weak

And you're so pretty
You are.
You're so pretty

[chorus]
You turned and everything went black
Turned and everything went black
You turned and everything went black
You turned and everything went black

[speaking]
I never sought power for power's sake
'cause power in the hands of a dangerous man
Is power in the hands of an enemy
...an enemy of yours an and enemy of mine
That manipulates kindness
For his own personal highs
And he's counting lines, counting numbers
Counting lines, counting lines, counting numbers
...so don't look at me and sneer
'cause I am nothing like you
The difference is clear
I'm your nigger you build with fear
And I hope I live to see the day
When your ideals go crashing away
To show you that your reflection is as cold
And as black
As the organs that pump blood to your veins
Because, you see...
I never wanted to own you or
Really anything
Just me

But you pushed
Pushed and pushed me
You pushed
Pushed and pushed me...

Pushed it all into something
Black
