Rolling deep when the, rivers high
I don't need no, woman's cries
Scrounging round them, old dark halls
Watch the devil when hes ready to call

We run, we run, oh down south
Never look into those eyes of Satan's wealth
We run, we run, oh down south

People playing, with your heart
Guns a firin', false start
Chest is heavy, with all your doubt
Children run and they scream they shout and

We run, we run, oh down south
Never look into those eyes of Satan's wealth
We run, we run, oh down south

Pockets empty, there's fire in the air
Your heart is lonely, but you don't care
Mindless games drive, you insane
Waiting for the milkman so you can kill you shame and

We run, we run, oh down south
Never look into those eyes of Satan's wealth
We run, we run, oh down south

My heart it weeps, anytime you speak
My heart it weeps, every time you creep
My heart it weeps, anytime you speak
My heart it weeps everytime you creep

We run, we run, oh down south
Never look into those eyes of Satan's wealth
We run, we run, oh down south
