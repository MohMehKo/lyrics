Tore up the restraining order, I don't care I'm comin' over
What your daddy said isn't goin' over to well
Don't you know not to kiss and tell?

Mama said "she's my brothers daughter" and I don't even know who's my father
I guess she's my cousin but she needs some sweet lovin' anyway!

Pulled you out by your hair, if people ask I was never there
Come on baby and take a ride with me
Come on baby let's drive to the sea

Mama said "she's my brothers daughter" and I don't even know who's my father
I guess she's my cousin but she needs some sweet lovin' anyway!

It's a hot night drivin' down highway sixty with my baby in the passenger seat
I roll down my window and I lean my head back and put my foot to the floor
We're going faster and she's saying slow down
We're going faster and she's saying slow down
We're going faster and she's saying slow down
We're going faster and she's saying slow down
And I say "no" and she's saying "slow down"
And I say "no" and she's saying "slow down"
And I say "no" and she's saying "slow down"
And I say "no" and she's screaming "slow down"
And I say "no"...

Mama said "she's my brothers daughter" and I don't even care who's my father
I guess she's my cousin but she needs some sweet lovin' anyway!
