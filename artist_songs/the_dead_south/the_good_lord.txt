Well I pray, every day
That the good Lord keep me safe
And I try to hide all this fear built in my spine
Give a man a day
So I can see your pretty face
Until I arrive in your arms

Well I don't know what you doin'
Fightin' in this silly war
You're not a yankee, love
Nor a grey-back confederate
Tryin' to keep these slaves abhorred

You were just a simple man
Tryin' to do these things the best you can
Now it's time to come on home
Got a baby in the oven
That I need to see before she gets old

Well I pray, every day
That the good Lord keep me safe
And I try to hide all this fear built in my spine
Give a man a day so I can see your pretty face
Until I arrive in your arms

Well I don't know what I'm doin'
Fightin' in this stupid war
I'm not a yankee or a grey-back anymore
I've killed so many men
Just to kill so many more
Just wanna see my baby before I die
In this shitstorm

Well I pray, every day
That the good Lord keep me safe
And I try to hide all this fear built in my spine
Give a man a day so I can see your pretty face
Until I arrive in your arms

Well I pray, every day
That the good Lord keep me safe
And I try to hide all this fear built in my spine
Give a man a day so I can see your pretty face
Until I die in your arms
Until I die in your arms
Until I die in your arms
