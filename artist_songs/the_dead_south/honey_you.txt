Honey you are a rock and I am your land and we will grow
Before the sun dries us up and turns us to sand
Do you remember when the ocean went mad and we were to blame?
We ran to another world with lives to save

They were the ones who could fly
They flew so high
Then I looked into your eyes never understanding why
You would never run with me while the world is turning upside down
And all around and we are watching those birds in the sky from the mountainside and you

Honey you are a rock and I am your land and we will grow
Before the sun dries us up and turns us to sand
Do you remember when the ocean went mad and we were to blame?
We ran to another world with lives to save
