I'll be gone, for so long
Don't you come around

Got me runnin' all around,
Where I am runnin' I won't be found
Oh no no no no no

Said you loved me once last time,
I ran so fast I blew your mind
Oh no no no no

Now its time to go find,
What I had on my mind
Oh no no no no no

Sadly it was never you,
I'd rather have sex with my shoe
Oh no no no no

I'll be gone, for so long
Don't you come around
I'll be gone, for so long
Don't you come around

Followed me right up a tree,
And all the way down to Tennessee
Oh no no no no no

It was time to give it up,
So I ran her over with my truck
I'll never be found

I'll be gone, for so long
Don't you come around
I'll be gone, for so long
Don't you come around
