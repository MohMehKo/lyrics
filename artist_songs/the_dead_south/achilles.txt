I am a man, I am the wind
I am all your deepest sins
I am the sun, I am the moon
I am all your sweetest tunes

And when the time calls upon me
I will know where to go
The pedals will fall past me
As I find my way home
As I find my way home

I am Achilles on a mountain,
Standing beside the hour glass
I am a hero, I am a thief
I am a resurrected man

And when the time calls upon me
I will know where to go
The pedals will fall past me
As I find my way home
As I find my way home

I am a rhythm, I am a beat
I am that curse walking down the street
I am a cheat, I am a liar
I am no ones desire

And when the time calls upon me
I will know where to go
The pedals will fall past me
As I find my way home
