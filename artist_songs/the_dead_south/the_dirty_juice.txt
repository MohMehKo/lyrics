I remember when you moved so slow
Going to the show
Always cooped up in your room
With a bottle of whiskey every meal of June
I don't know those eyes

Why you get so wasted all alone?
You're burning out your light
You just don't seem oh so bright
What do I have to do to keep your pride
I'll be by your side

I don't think Lee Hooker could ever sing the blues
Not the way I do
When I am staring right at you
Oh mama please just hold me one more night
Before I lose you to the juice
