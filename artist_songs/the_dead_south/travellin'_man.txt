Well this is a song about a travellin' man who knows just what he wants.
He thinks he's got it all figured out and tries not to take too much.
He's spent a lot of time tryin' this and that and he knows just what he likes
And he ain't goin' back

Well I've got spiders in my bed and I've got slugs up on the wall
There's a black bee a flyin' round outside of my back door
I'm weather worn my shirt is torn I got dirt comin' out my ears
From being gone all these years

Well one half of my head keeps singing songs of years of old
While the other sheds its skin on aggregates of minerals
I'm a cask of oak, I'm whiskey soaked, been runnin' down the line
Awe pour me another one honey I'm doin' fine

I don't know where I belong but I know just what I like
Kicking up dirt while I'm on the run, double whiskey no ice
Well I don't know where I belong but I know just what I like
A pretty lady and sing along songs, to take me through the night

I got sand in my shoes and I got dirt between my toes
There's calm before the storm I hear or so the story goes
I'm dancing in it now, got a sweaty brow, I feel it coursing through my veins
Awe look out baby I'm comin' through when it rains

I don't know where I belong but I know just what I like
Kicking up dirt while I'm on the run, double whiskey no ice
Well I don't know where I belong but I know just what I like
A pretty lady and sing along songs, to take me through the night

And I've been gone for so very long
Baby don't think twice, I know we'll be alright
I've got an absence without leave
I've got an ace tucked up my sleeve
With sticks and stones we'll take the throne
And make some history

I don't know where I belong but I know just what I like
Kicking up dirt while I'm on the run, double whiskey no ice
Well I don't know where I belong but I know just what I like
A pretty lady and sing along songs, to take me through the night
