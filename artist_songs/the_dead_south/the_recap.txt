Well we're all wasted, in a bar
Somewhere downtown
When I man walks up and pokes me with a knife
And says "man I'm gonna send you to hell"
Well I took that knife, I stared him straight in the eyes
I said "Oh boy you better fuckin' run,
I've been sittin' here just a slammin' down beers, now its time to have some fun"
Oh...

Oh well he hit me hard, yeah he hit me good
And then I fell to the ground,
But I kicked him fast I kicked him real swift and he came a tumblin' down
He took a stab at me and nearly cut me gut
But I kicked that knife to the floor
The I took his head and slammed it into the bar I don't think he'll come around no more
Oh...

Well I've been drinkin' here for so many damn years
Trying to recap my life
Everynight trouble finds my sight and I can't help but fight
With a bottle of Jack and a tin of skoal
I'll be stickin' around
'Till the day a man will put me away and I can rest my soul

Well we're all wasted, in a bar
Somewhere downtown
When I man walks up and pokes me with a knife
And says "man I'm gonna send you to hell"
Well I took that knife, I stared him straight in the eyes
I said "Oh boy this is the day"
Then I grabbed that knife, stabbed it straight through my eye and
Then I fell to my knees
Oh...

Well I've been drinkin' here for so many damn years
Trying to recap my life
Every night trouble finds my sight and I can't help but fight
With a bottle of Jack and a tin of skoal
Tonight I'm goin' home
Today's the day a man put me away and I can rest my soul
