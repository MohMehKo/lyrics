Oh, well we run to the break of day
The old man groaned as we rolled away
The women wept as we sped on by
We hung our heads low
As they raised their flags high

Then we grabbed our guns and shot away
He's killed all our brothers on a Saturday
Our blood's dishonored and our wounds were deep
Old Jesse James, well, he won't even take a peep

So then we go on down that road
Breakin' your backs and breakin' your souls
Breakin' your backs and breakin' your souls
The girls said I die before I get old

The war is over and the graves were deep
The sun was down just like my brother Rim's keep
You burned my house and you raped my wife
I fall to my knees and I pray to the Lord
That I can kill that fucker tonight!

So then we go on down that road
Breakin' your backs and breakin' your souls
Breakin' your backs and breakin' your souls
Mama said I die before I get old

(Oh, hey their dad[?])
Don't you know who I am?
No motherfucker, don't give a God damn!

So then we go on down that road
Breakin' your backs and breakin' your souls
Breakin' your backs and breakin' your souls
Mama said I die before I get old

Mama said I die before I get old
Mama said I die before I get old
Mama said I die before I get old
Mama said I die before I get old
Mama said I die before I get old
