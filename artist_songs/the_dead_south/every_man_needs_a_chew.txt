Well I sat down on the pooper
Thinkin' through and through
Sippin' on some whiskey, yeah
With a real fat chew
Well them winds they are a blowing wild
While I take this poo
And every man needs a chew

Driving down them prairie lands
Flat as can be
Why did my pappy leave me solo
Well that don't matter no more
Cause every man needs a chew

Well I sat down on the pooper
Thinkin' through and through
Sippin' on some whiskey, yeah
With a real fat chew
Well them winds they are blowing wild
While I take this poo
And every man needs a chew

Well I sat down on the pooper
Thinkin' through and through
Sippin' on some whiskey, yeah
With a real fat chew
Well them winds they are blowing wild
While I take this poo
And every man needs a chew
