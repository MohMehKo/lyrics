Hey there baby you sting like a bee
Everybody just wants to see
What it is so sweet in you
Must be your honey seeping through

You shoot like a man
And kick like a mule
You ain't no body's fool
Wearing them boots like you ranching all day
And heading out to a line dance in the hay

I like my coffee black (get that milk out of his coffee)
And I love my liquor straight (get that guy a whiskey)
With a chew in my lip (he's got tobacco in his mouth)
Now, that's the manly way
That's the manly way
Life should always be that way
