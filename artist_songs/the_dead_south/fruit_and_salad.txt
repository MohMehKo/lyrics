I'm in love with your mother,
but not the way I do love you
She doesn't cut it like you do,
Fruit and salad no meat please
Old style goin' in for your soul
But baby that ain't happenin'
Cause in a bag I'm useless
That's why you left me for him
That's why I'll sleep with your mother again
But hopefully soon my lonely heart

Will be filled with the, warmth form your eyes
And we can swap snow for leaves
So come on baby and just come around
And let me back in through your door
And if you don't want to come around
I'll take your mother to, funky town
And we will make the nasty weather

All my dreams are, waiting for you
In a time where I ain't no fool
The love is lost somewhere in the room
Your eyes are wider underneath the moon

All my dreams are, waiting for you
In a time where I ain't no fool
The love is lost somewhere in the room
Your eyes are wider underneath the moon
The moon

With the world around my fingertips
And I will rub her curvy hips
Cause I'm in love with your mother
But not the way I do love you
But I will treat her like I would treat you
