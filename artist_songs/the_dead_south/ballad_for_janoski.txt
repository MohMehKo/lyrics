Sittin' in your living room,
while the sun is shining through,
You see reflections, and the shadows they cast
When the demon grabs you boy, you better run to mass

So we sing, until the demons gone
And we will play his games until we play them all
So we dance, the night away
He will turn his head in shame
As he walks away

You fly so high, you can almost touch the sky
You breath so deep no one else can get no sleep
You float away all the problems we had today
But inside of you theirs a demon breaking through

So we sing, until the demons gone
And we will play his games until we play them all
So we dance, the night away
He will turn his head in shame
As he walks away
