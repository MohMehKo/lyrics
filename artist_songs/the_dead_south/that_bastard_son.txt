Always lookin' out for number one
We never talk about that bastard son
Heading out to the liquor store
Never been without my baby before

Waiting in line just to have a drink
Guy beside you's puking in the sink

I don't feel no more
I just want liquor and dirty whores
Cause I, don't care no more

When you walk out of that bar
You try and get in your car
With a girl hanging on your hip
You're getting ready for the big trip
Better give that girl just one more kiss
All that cocaine will leave you in a bliss

I don't feel no more
I just want liquor and dirty whores
Cause I, don't care no more
No I, don't care no more

You're heading on a one-way trip
Its blizzarding out so you take a dip
Then you look down at your phone
No message from your baby
Cause you're all alone
With all your cheats and all your lies
Your faithful father won't forgive your crimes

I don't feel no more
I just want liquor and dirty whores
Cause I, don't care no more
No I, don't care no more
