[Chorus:]
Warm days warm nights
But I feel so cold coold
Living my life on the line it's out of control (trool)
Don't you question only tax rule
Money haffi mek that's how we been grown and
By enemies we haffi defend we own
But still we nah go sell we soul

[Verse 1:]
Mi ask dem
Have you ever slept on the street
Have you ever born will without food to eat
Well have you eva
Run when gunshot a beat
Hard time when mek police a buss di shot a you will be tweet
Well have you eva stand up inna war
Neva run nor retreat and
Put it pon your enemies till dem get defeat
If you don't know you really nuffi speak
Is like you lock up
Inna di sheet inna di toilet some a eat
Mi tell dem

[Chorus:]
Warm days warm nights

Well meh mi tell you some
Straight man a no shotta just a hungry hungry brodda
And if you ramp with mi food

Cause anytime you see a hungry face you cyaan escape
And a tret we a send nah badmind we a defend
But if you have betta we need it fi survive we're comin in

[Chorus:]
