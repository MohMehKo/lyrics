I got a little money to burn
I gotta get laid 
Gotta find me a sexy girl 

So me say hey pretty baby 
Wanna ask you yuh name

I hope you feelin da same 
Got me attracted to 
The shape and ya frame 
Let me introduce you to 
My group and my flame? 
Don't get it twisted

Wanna save ya mind 
With lyrics and 
Get in ya veins

I see you walkin by 
Gul ya lookin so fine 
Try to stop you in ya tracks 
And tell you whats on my mind 
It no matta if you neglect me 
One more time 
Cuz before the night done 
Baby girl you'll be mine 
You have two mountains 
I wanna climb 
I wanna take you back home 
And test ya waistline 
A one night stand girl 
Is not a crime 
Cuz if you do it real good 
It can last a lifetime
