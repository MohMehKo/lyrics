If you feel the same way too

[Verse 2: Craigy T]
Bay gal yuh know yuh pretty like a roseland
From yuh heel to yuh pedicure toes and
Happy dat yuh chose mi out to possibly a thousand
But I have to let yuh know di lifestyle yuh chosen

Bare ten outta ten girls dem surround mi
But it nuh matta from mi waan yuh and yuh waan mi so

[Chorus: Alexx & Flexx (Craigy T)]

If you feel the same way too

[Bridge: Flexx]
I'm not lookin for a girl, to be the only one in my world
All I wanna do is have some fun and then come back to you
I'm not lookin for a girl, to be the only one in my world
All I wanna do is have some fun and then come back to you

[Chorus: Alexx & Flexx (Craigy T)]
Tell me (Tell me, tell me, tell me weh yuh waan)
If you still care, about me (So mi go so weh mi juggle so mi go so then)
Tell me (Tell mi weh yuh waan) if you still care, about me
If you feel the same way too
Tell me (Go so then) if you still care, about me (Ah ah ah)
Tell me (Ribidy bibidy bibidy bibidy bomb skang) if you still care, about me
If you feel the same way too
