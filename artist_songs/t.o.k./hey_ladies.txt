[Intro: Bay-C]
T.OK girlfriend put your hands up 
Rudeboy in a the club put your hands up 
Put 'em up, put 'em up to the sky 
Put 'em up, real high 

[Chorus: Flex]
Hey ladies, let me see your hands up in the air 
From you know you look good in what you wear 
Let me see you wave it like you just don't don't care 
Hey gangsters, let me see you buss it in the air 
Caw we no see no boy we fear, we're never scared 
Let me see you buss it like you just don't care 

[verse 1: Craigy T]
