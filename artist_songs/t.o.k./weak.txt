[Intro (Flexx)]
I know your bad for me, I cant help it, oh, yeah

[Chorus: Alexx & Flexx]
She makes me weak, she knocks me off my feet
But I don't really like it, I've tried to fight it
Weak, she knocks me off my feet
But I don't really like it, I've tried to fight it

[Verse 1: Craigy T]
Just like a tam tam drum
So yuh have mi heart a beat ra pa pom pom
Every ting yuh waan gal yuh have it Bar None
Addicted to you just like Opium
Feenin fi some like a match to a flame
Keep getting burned again and again
Just caan learn girl Im goin insane
Cause everytime mi get a likkle pressure theres pain
But still feel di same

[Chorus: Alexx & Flexx]
She makes me weak, she knocks me off my feet
But I don't really like it, I've tried to fight it
Weak, she knocks me off my feet
But I don't really like it, I've tried to fight it

[Verse 2: Alexx]

[Chorus: Alexx & Flexx]
She makes me weak, she knocks me off my feet
But I don't really like it, I've tried to fight it
Weak, she knocks me off my feet
But I don't really like it, I've tried to fight it

[Verse 3: Bay-C]
This gal mek mi weak, like, Superman to kryptonite
So, everytime yuh spend di night
We, start wid love, then end wid a fight, girl dats not right
Im sure, we, been through all this before
So, you can cull all di bull, manure
Cause like Jay-Z, next week yuh go waan an encore
Tell dem seh make up to break up its not my style
Run dung di fake club its not my style
Mi waan a wifey wid a smooth profile
Not one wid a file, from Girls Gone Wild
One wey can turn my frown inna smile
Soothin to mi just like chamomile
Caan tell when mi feel down from a mile
And have mi weak like from Fourth Of July

[Chorus: Alexx & Flexx]
She makes me weak, she knocks me off my feet
But I don't really like it, I've tried to fight it
Weak, she knocks me off my feet
But I don't really like it, I've tried to fight it

[Bridge: Flexx]
I know your bad for me, your really really bad for me
I know your bad for me, your really really bad for me, oh oh oh!!!

[Chorus: Alexx & Flexx]
She makes me weak, she knocks me off my feet
But I don't really like it, I've tried to fight it
Weak, she knocks me off my feet
But I don't really like it, I've tried to fight it
