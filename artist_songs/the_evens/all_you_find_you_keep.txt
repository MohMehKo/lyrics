You're digging in our pockets
You want our pictures on our tickets
All you find you keep
You're acting stranger than a stranger
You're printing all our fingers
All you find you keep
What more can we give you?
Inspection of all transactions
Erections for our protection
All you find you keep
What more can we give you?

You must be insane
You must be insane
You must be insane
We must be insane

The name of our mother's dentist
Our favorite digital artist
All you find you keep
The hours we will be sleeping
Desires we will be typing
All you find you keep
What more can we give you?
It's not a passive engagement
It's a permanent arrangement
All you find you keep
What more can we give you?

You must be insane
You must be insane
You must be insane
We must be insane

You can't keep out what's already in
You can't keep out what's already in
You can't keep out what's already in
You must be insane

You can't keep out what's already in
You can't keep out what's already in
You can't keep out what's already in
We must be insane

All you find
All you find
All you find
All you find
All you find
All you find you keep
All you find you keep
