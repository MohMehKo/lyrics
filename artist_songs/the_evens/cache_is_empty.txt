If you ignore your heart things will fall apart
Your cache is empty 'cause your body's that way
Held together with no more than a membrane
Guarding all your parts is harder than being without cover

Halved open like an onion observe
Totality falls into terminal pieces
Will it go back, will it grow back
Somehow you pulled the roots apart

If you ignore your heart things will fall apart
(Wait)The TV it turned on me behold
I saw a person made of plastic ingredients
Carved and sliced and diced into
A human with no being
No way a creature can continue this way
When its orbit should be should be always expanding
And not falling, no not falling, no not falling in

The price of gas
The love of law
It makes us all aware how we compare
To those who want to set the price of air

Your cache is empty 'cause your body's that way
Your cache is empty 'cause your body's that way
Your cache is empty 'cause your body's that way
Your cache is empty 'cause your body's that way
