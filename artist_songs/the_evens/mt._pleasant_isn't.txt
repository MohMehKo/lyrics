Let me revolve cuz there is of you can jam as you through
you shove the past by playing last but not the one that you knew
and anger takes place of what's destroyed
Mt.Pleasant isn't anymore
so in the end movin all that pair a rum just bud and touch and let people through
and ship the glass by playing last but not he one that you knew
and anger takes place of was removed
Mt.Pleasant isn't anymore
the police will not be excused the police will not bud in
the police will not be excused the police will not bud in
the police will not be excused the police will not bud in
All too much is lost in never enough to save
And anger takes place of what's ignored
Mt.Pleasant isn't anymore
