Upon the rocks above the falling water he comes close
to jumpin off the edgeinstead of standing watching whats belows
and when theres frost outside on every window cold winds blow
comes so close to walking out the front door without a coat
there is no round the corner anymore
there is no round the corner anymore
there is no round the corner anymore
there is no round the corner anymore
Whatcha gonna do jagged edge lays in your bath not gonna hate it?
Whatcha gonna do to someone who hold you back you not gonna have it?
whatcha gonna do if theres a siren floating round you not gonna catch it
whatcha gonna do if it gets to weary through the horn you not gonna exit?
