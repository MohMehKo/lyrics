You've lost control
The difference is on your head
Keep what you stole
'Cause now it's dead

This is the price you did not count
When you were counting me out
It's your disease crawling into my view
Take what you please and spend it too

This is the price you did not count
When you were counting me out
This is the price you did not count

You've lost control of the backline
You've lost control of the frontline
You've lost control of the bottom line
You've lost control

No money, no money, no money, no money, no money
No money, no money, no money, no money, no money
No money, no money, no money, no money, no money
No money, no money, no money, no money, no money
No

The balance now rests inside your lungs
Why did I ever allow my bones to become your rungs

This is the price you did not count
When you were counting me out
This is the price you did not count

You've lost control of the backline
You've lost control of the frontline
You've lost control of the bottom line
You've lost control

No money, no money, no money, no money, no money
No money, no money, no money, no money, no money
No money, no money, no money, no money, no money
No money, no money, no money, no money, no money
No

How can it be worth the price you pay
When worth isn't made with one faithless payment
And what's the repayment for worth that is lost when
Agreements are broken and good faith is stolen
