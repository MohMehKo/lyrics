Pushed against the wall
Ruins wastage refuse trifle debris
It is unnervingly normal
So ordinary that it looms obscene

Pushed against the wall (Pushed against the wall)
Smother repress weaken trifle daily
It is confounding but usual (confounding but usual)
To be busied by the gross of gross trappings

It's not that hard to describe
It's a worldwide idle resign
The hole inside is the only reason why
It's not that hard to describe (at all, at all, at all...)

Unfinished and unformed (Unfinished and unformed)
Disguised inside complex adult bodies
Cloaked as fully grown (Cloaked as fully grown)
Though trammeled by a childlike vacancy

Guess it's ok because you're taken away by whatever you think is true
Guess it's ok because you're taken away by whatever you think is true

It's not that hard to describe
It's not that hard to describe
It's not that hard to describe
The hole inside is the only reason why
