this street is an exit only
it's an opening
which explains why this shit washes away
then runs right back in

if you have to always be leaving
how am i gonna show you that we are free

arrange yourself
reorder again
nothing has changed
select inspect and pull it apart
all the flavors taste plain

if i can't find you through all your things
how am i gonna show you that we are free
if i can't find you through all your things
how am i gonna show you that we are free

trace translate these names
they're all the same
no one isn't only
six billion monkeys
if we cannot need where would we begin
how am i gonna show you that we are free
if we cannot need where would we begin
how am i gonna show you that we are free
if you always have to leave
if you always have to leave
if you always have to leave
