On the face of it On the face of it
there is nothing to confront
just apocracy an inconsistancy
while we pretend that we are alone with a standards bed
and no profits shared
we should count our days numbered
get busy
on the face of it on the face of it
there is nothing to conseal just conspiracy
anatrocity while we contend with kin
all alone with a hardlier and our bridges burned
we can count our days number
thats a tragedy of a stradegy
of looking out for number one
