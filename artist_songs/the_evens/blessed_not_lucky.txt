Went out last night streets were empty 
no cars no accidents
Let go the wheel close my eyes
how could I know there was nothing out there
no cars no accidents
how could you know what was on my mind if I was not thinking
if we end in collision
no cars no accidents
or if theres no end 
were blessed but not lucky now
we may burn up upon re-entry
no stars no presidence
we may float through empty skys
how could you know there was something out there
no stars no presidence
how could I know what was on your mind if you were not dreaming too
if we end in decision
no stars no presidence
or if theres no end
were blessed but not lucky now
what if there's no end?
what if there's no end?
we're blessed but not lucky now
