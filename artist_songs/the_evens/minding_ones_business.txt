One everybody clear your mind and take a breath
Two everybody wipe your eyes and take a sip
Three everybody look away but trust yourself
Four everybody know the way you know yourself
Five everybody lose the map of dicipline
Six everybody rediscover understand
Seven everybody see yourself as you come in
Eight everybody turn around and start again
On the floor is a lie 
follow it or intwine
You can't run so walk it
You can't walk so crawl it
you can't crawl your falling
you can't fall your falling
Sometime you'll find that your going forward backwards
On the wall is a sign
say the words or define
if you could read it
you could concive it
and stop repeating defeated being
is high along ride
On the mind is a mind
think of it or combine
it does affect you
it does connect you
watch it reflect you
you want to protect it
sometime you'll find that it's foudn before you seek
do you ever wonder where it is your wondering?
