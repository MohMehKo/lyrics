You better see someone about that hole in your heart
It needs repair
What suffers like some finish may well be a start
And one to share
And one to share

You fell down, you feel let down
You fell down, you feel let down

The lines will never change if you just play the part
You're always there
So if it's favors you're handing out, hand one to yourself
Recirculate the air

You fell down, you feel let down
You fell down, you feel let down
You fell down, you feel let down
You fell down, you feel let down
You feel let down

Let's have some breaking out instead of boxing in
If you find yourself locked out and you're locked within
Instead of standing at the door, why not use the key
Is there something on the other side that you don't want to see

You fell down, you feel let down
You fell down, you feel let down
You fell down, you feel let down
You fell down, you feel let down
You feel let down
