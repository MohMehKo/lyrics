My mother share emotional
This matters, make me feel bad
One more is gone, one more is gone
He knows well and what comes afterward

You were free, when you were dying
I walked along to help you go
She turn him, she turned off
Walking through the week

Look at the ants go, look at the ants go
I think those ants know

Look at the ants go, look at the ants go,
I think those ants know, be.
