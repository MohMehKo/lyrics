Paralyzed and ignored (lie down with this)
Let me to cry on my own (down next to this)
You're there at three o'clock (inside of this)
Your charge is not to be crazy

Just like i'm not crazy too (lie down with this)
I'd by all there is to do (down next to this)
Calling me calling you calling me (inside of this)
I'll be there at three

Hey pull over and over
Stay pull over and over
Space pull over and over

Space pull over and over
Space pull over and over
Space pull over and over
