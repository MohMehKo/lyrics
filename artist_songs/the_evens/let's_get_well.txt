Oh California have your boundaries
One of them is a line you did not draw
Much like the state of our existence
Is the difference between what the sheep and saw

Shaped by shapers
I should of spite them
I still end up on the cutting board
The truth is always in and around us
And the doing becomes the dying when ignored

When ignored [x5]

Sometimes it's the brain that brings the poison
Sometimes something else is behind the wheel
Whatever it is wants to keep on driving
And he let it little as you feel

But the birds don't give a damn about the markets
And the buildings they all come down in time
The truth is always everneath the garden
Imperfection perfectly out of line

Out of line [x5]

Let's get well
Let's get well
Let's get well
Let's get well
