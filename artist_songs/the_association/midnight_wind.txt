Feelin' in the back of my heart
Just a feelin' it's way around
Been running around from place to place
Tryin' to get my feet on the ground

'Bout where you're goin'
Be glad that you got the

You may chance to see your face
And it's very well known
That it's a stillborn place
And it's very clearly shown
That this is its one and only grace

So sail away
If you got the chance
Take the first high tide

'Bout where you're goin'
Be glad that you got the
Ride Ride Ride Ride Ride
Ride Ride Ride Ride Ride
