The clown is most sincere
As he turns to you and me and says
I know you love me now and here
But will you love me
when we are free
And his ghost is in the corner
Flicking ashes on the floor
Bragging to the jailer
How he does not need a door
But the show, it must go on and on
Maybe one fine morning
He will stand before a merciful dawn
The train runs by the circus
And the clown looks up from his place
And he cries beneath the surface
of the smile painted on his face
And he has no time, he has no way
to presume they're wrong they're right
But on his way from day to day
He must travel through the night
And the show, it must go on and on
Surely one fine morning
He will stand before a merciful dawn
