Here I go 'round again
Think I hear the bells resound again
Ringing as they never have before
With melodies that I cannot ignore
Modulating just a step or two
Every single time I lay my eyes on you
I'm getting high, I think
But I haven't had a thing to drink
At the insistence of the court
I hear it's getting me very dizzy
I hear conversions all so crazy 'round the room is
Spinning in a groovy 6/8 time
Like these notes you seem to be everywhere
No matter where I go I seem to see you standing there
Then things start swinging
Bells start their ringing

Life has new meaning for me

Here I go round again
Think that I am never comin' down again
From this crazy spin that I am in again
Again (again) again (again)...
