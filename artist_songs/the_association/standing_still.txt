Stay by me and tell me how my kiss can cause a change in you 
Send out your thoughts on love in tender phrases proven true 

We found what seems to be 
A love that will always be 
The kind of thing that makes the rest of life seem to be 
Standing still 

Gentle warmth flows through my soul each time my lips come close to yours 
The beauty of the moment makes the kiss worth waiting for 

We found what seems to be 
A love that will always be 
The kind of thing that makes the rest of life seem to be 
Standing still 

Words could never say as much as the silence of a lovers' kiss 
Now our lives seem to blend into a timeless eternal bliss
