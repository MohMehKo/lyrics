I hear the salesman sighing
The customers aren't buying
He said, "they all turned him down
It's too much to pay"

The gentleman is swearing
While on the curb he's staring
At the bus that passed him by
It blew his day

People reacting
All of them acting
Out emotions for a thing
That passed them by

But what of the people all standing
And not understanding
What emotion to express, to laugh or cry
Time has passed them by

The hour's come (The hour's come)
Don't go anywhere (They go nowhere)
The world shrinks down to the kitchen and den
Fleeting memories of what might have been
So little time left to prepare

I hear the kids rejoicing
As they go running voicing
Their delight in chasing the kite
That's blown away

The playwrite stands and mutters
The critics make him shudder
All alone, no one applauds
The end of his play

People reacting
And all of them acting
Out emotions for a thing
That passed them by

But what of the people all standing
And not understanding
What emotion to express, to laugh or cry
Time has passed them by
