Wind escorts the day outside 
Clouds of sheep's wool lionize the moon 
For soon the moment that we meet 
Phantom trees that whisper down the street 
Relay our message of love 

Night, what mysteries will it bring 
Who can tell when Spring becomes of age 
One page of letters bound foretells 
Of the sorrow that your kiss dispels 
And holds our message of love 

Fires at horizon's edge 
Warm the soft breath of this pledge of ours 
Bright stars that linger in their flight 
Who will know the plans we share tonight 
Reflect our message of love 

They heed the message 
They heed the message 
They heed the message
