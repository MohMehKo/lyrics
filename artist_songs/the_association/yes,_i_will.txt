What is a sound inside a rainbow
Where is a moment gone away
Will I wear my heart behind a window
Will I show the love I hold for you today

Yes, I will, and you can believe me
Yes, I will, and you know it's true
Yes, I will, and I'll never deceive thee
Will I always love you, yes, I will, yes I will

Oh, love is swift and like an arrow
Oh, then is deep and like the wind
If love is here again tomorrow
Will you ask me would I feel the same way then

Yes, I will, and you can believe me
Yes, I will, and you know it's true
Yes, I will, and I'll never deceive thee
Will I always love you, yes, I will, yes I will

Will I keep it free, yes, I will
Just as it should be, yes, I will
And taking care, that love is sharing with you

Yes, I will, and you can believe me
Yes, I will, and you know it's true
Yes, I will, and I'll never deceive thee
Will I always love you, yes, I will, yes I will

Oh Oh yes, I will
Oh Oh yes, I will
Oh Oh yes, I will
Oh Oh yes, I will
Oh Oh yes, I will
Oh Oh yes, I will
Oh Oh yes, I will
