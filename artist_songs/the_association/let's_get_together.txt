Love's is but the song we sing and fear's the way we die.
You can make the mountains ring or make the angels cry.
Know the dove is on the wing and you need not know why.

C'mon, people. Smile on your brother. Hey, let's get together and love one another right now.

Some may come and some may go and we shall surely pass.
When the one who left us here returns for us at last.
We are just a moment's sunlight, fading on the grass.

C'mon, people. Smile on your brother. Hey, let's get together and love one another right now.

If you hear the song I sing, then you must understand,
You hold the key to love and fear. It's in your tremb'ling hand.
One key unlocks them both, you know, and it's at your command.

C'mon, people. Smile on your brother. Hey, let's get together and love one another right now.

Love's is but the song we sing and fear's the way we die.
You can make the mountains ring or make the angels cry.
Know the dove is on the wing and you need not know why.

C'mon, people. Smile on your brother. Hey, let's get together and love one another right now.
