It’s a funny kind of shame that I’m feeling in this rain
I just have left some friends and I won’t see them again
And you know they’re really true, you can tell by what they do
The smile inside their eyes could never tell me lies, no lies
Oh, I love them better than the sunlight in the sky 
And it makes me cry

It’s a funny kind of song and it doesn’t take too long
’Cause everyone took time to say I love you better than my home. 
I’m a funny kind of guy, laughing’s not always my high 
I just have left some friends and I won’t see them again
Oh, I wish I could run to them and be with them again
I could get stoned with them just listening to the wind
And it makes me cry
