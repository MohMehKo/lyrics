Stepping off a stone, while I'm walking alone
Walking all alone, like always
Got me a new car, it doesn't get me too far
I'm all out of gas, like always
Got to pay the rent, but all my money's spent
All my money's spent, like always
I wonder where my pay went
Missed another payment
I'm all out of bread, like always
Girl, let the world have my money
I don't care
Girl, make my troubles seem funny and small
In no time at all
Things have got to move, I've been to long in this groove
Hung up in this groove, like always
Things are getting better, ever since I met her
Oh, oh, there she goes, like always
Like always, like always
