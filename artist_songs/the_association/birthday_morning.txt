Night has cried
Her dewdrops in the grass
The dark has passed
And now it's morning
A birthday morning

Now the dawn is waking
In her hands
Awaiting plans
Of ribs and apples
To find the love way
This happy birthday

Got the feel of sunrise
In her hair
God unwinds her halo 
To the stairway
To the moon
Just for this morning
A birthday morning

Now the dreams
Are dancing candlelight
That end the night
To bring her day dreams
And show the love way
This happy birthday

Got the feel of sunrise
In her hair
God unwinds her halo
To the stairway
To the moon
Just for this morning
A birthday morning
God bless the morning

God bless this morning
God bless this morning
