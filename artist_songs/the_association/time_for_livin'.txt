I kicked off my shoes, and felt the good earth beneath my feet
I loosened my tie, and felt what it feels like to breathe
I found the secret to life
I took some time for living
I took off my watch, and found I had all the time in the world
I opened up my arms, so I could hold life like a beautiful girl
I laid down all of my hang-ups forever
I looked around, and saw what sweet things can be found
Simply by taking some time for living
Grooving on little things life is giving

From now on I'm taking time out for life
Too busy  to stop and notice the things that are real
Embarrassed to talk about all things that I feel
It's so strange, never noticed the world all around me
Hey, look I've changed, my attitude's been rearranged

From now on I'm taking some time for living
Grooving on everything life is giving
I'm gonna be taking time for life
Lifetime for living
Grooving on everything life is giving
Lifetime for living
Grooving on everything life is giving
Lifetime for living
