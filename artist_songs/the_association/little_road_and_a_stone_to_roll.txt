Little road and a stone to roll
Little road and a stone to roll
Little road and a stone to roll
Ev'ry body needs a stone to roll

Ev'ry body needs a fire inside
Ev'ry body needs a dream to ride
Ev'ry body with a growing soul
Ev'ry body needs a stone to roll

Little road and a stone to roll
Little road and a stone to roll
Little road and a stone to roll
Ev'ry body needs a stone to roll

Ev'ry body needs some old loose shoes
And we could all use a little good news
Ev'ry body with a sheet to fold
Ev'ry body needs a stone to roll

Ev'ry body needs a Carole King tune
Ev'ry body needs a little more room
'Cause ev'ry body digs their own deep hole
Ev'ry body needs a stone to roll

Little road and a stone to roll
Little road and a stone to roll
Little road and a stone to roll
Ev'ry body needs a stone to roll
