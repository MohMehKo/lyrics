Broccoli--I really dig it steamed
Broccoli--just plain, with cheese or creamed
I like to eat it with my mouth
It tastes so good
I like to eat it with my mouth
It's my favorite food

Broccoli--it grows right from the ground
Broccoli--I even dig the sound
A favorite Atlantean dish
They thought it was the end
A favorite Atlantean dish
I'm a-turnin' you on my friend
I'm a-turnin' you on my friend

Broccoli--I really dig it, really dig it steamed, yeah
Broccoli--just plain, with cheese, plain with cheese or creamed

I like to eat it 
I like to eat it
