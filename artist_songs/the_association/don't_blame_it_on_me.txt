Go blame the rain for your cloudburst of teardrops 
Blame the wind, say how lonely and cold it can be 
You asked to be free 
Don't blame it on me 

Go blame the night for the darkness descending 
Blame the wind, say it laughs at you now that you're free 
That's how you want it to be 
Don't blame it on me 

Now your life is empty 
And only tears remain 
Your high hopes turned to heartaches 
Your freedom turned to chains 

Go blame rain and the wind and the darkness 
Blame the world for the way things have turned out to be 
Blame whatever you please 

But don't... 
Don't blame it on me 
Don't blame it on me
