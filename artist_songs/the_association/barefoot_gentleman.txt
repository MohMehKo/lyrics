An old day is coming once again
Young woman leaves the beast
Of never ending sadness
The day grows sleepy and it's        
Night

He the barefoot boy
In the earth-green waving fields
Leaves for the city, the stars    
Awake and come to the crowd for   
The Night

And the orange open glow
And sunset of goodbye is singing

Through woman there's a home
In the heart of man right now
Barefoot gentleman there's a          
Woman's hand under the moon
'Neath the moon an ever new light

He the barefoot boy
In the black blindfold of death
Led by a woman within his heart
Finds the city of dark's 
Promised land

And the orange open glow
And sunset of goodbye is singing
