Well I've got great big blisters on my bloodshot eyes 
From lookin' at that long-legged female up ahead 
Well what she does simply walkin' down the sidewalks of the city 
Makes me think about some stray cat gettin' fed 
She's got a whole lot of motion in her soul 
I know that her soul is not the place she lets it show 

She's got that body, oh yeah 
She's got that motion, oh yeah 
She's gonna get me, oh yeah 
She's gonna tear my soul apart and put big blisters on my heart 
And what a mighty crazy, cookin way to go 

And I've got great big blisters on my fingertips 
From reachin' in my pocket pickin' out them bills 
And I've got tiny white blisters on my foot 
From tryin' to ease my nervous tension taking patent pills 
Well ever since we started runnin' round from bar to bar 
I just can't eat a bite to keep my stomach settled down 

She's got that body, oh yeah 
She's got that motion, oh yeah 
She's gonna get me, oh yeah 
She's gonna tear my soul apart and put big blisters on my heart 
And what a mighty crazy, cookin way to go 

She's got a whole lot of motion in her soul 
I know that her soul is not the place she lets it show 

She's got that body, oh yeah 
She's got that motion, oh yeah 
She's gonna get me, oh yeah 
She's gonna burn me, oh yeah 
She's gonna tear my soul apart and put big blisters on my heart 
And what a mighty crazy, cookin way to go
