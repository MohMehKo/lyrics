Released after years of being kept in hiding

Enter the young, yeah 
More than you think they think 
Not only learned to think, but to care

Here they come And some with facts and some with visions 
Of a place to multiply without the use of divisions 
To win a prize that no one's ever won

Some are laughing, some are crying 
Here they come

Not only learned to think, but to care 
Not only learned to think, but to dare 
Enter the young
