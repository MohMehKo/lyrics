Seven witches standin in the road
Stirrin up the future with the legs of the toad
Oh they got the wine
And I got the time
And isn't it sublime
To lay down your load
Come on and shake it to the mountain
Bathe it in the fountain
Leave what you been countin
Life is here to mold
Seven virgins bathin in the brook
Smilin at the farmer who come for a look
Oh he got the lines
And they got the time
Eight swimmin virgins
And the river it was shook
Come on and shuffle to the mountain
Bathe it in the fountain
Leave what you been countin
Stop makin time
Well buying and a sellin
Peekin and a tellin
Yesterday we were so old
This planet been a swellin
Like a salty summer melon
Words around it might explode
So I been told
Seven witches standin in the road
Stirrin' up the future with the legs of the toad
Well they got the wine
And I got the time
And isn't it sublime
Just to lay down your load
Lay down your load
Lay down your load
