Everybody told me the way that love could be
But I never thought that love

If you leave me now my happiness would die
Memories of you would always make me cry

Everybody told me in time you'd go away
But I never listened I loved you day by day

If you leave me now my happiness would die
Memories of you would always make me cry

[Instrumental]

If you leave me now my happiness would die
Memories of you would always make me cry [repeat till fade]
