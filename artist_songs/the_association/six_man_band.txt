Well, I'm a day at a time
I'm a day at a time
Well, I'm a seeker and knower
In a six man mind

'Cause I'm a traveling man
Yes, I'm a traveling man
Well, I'm a comer and a goer
In a six man band

Well, I'm a California man
My instrument in hand, I'm electrified
On a fast flying trip
Dirty laundry in my grip mostly drip-dry

We got the seventeen jewels that dictate the rules
And the time to fly as we're passing by
We just got the time to say hello
And then a fast goodbye

I'm a traveling man
Yes, I'm a traveling man
Well, I'm a comer and a goer
In a six man band
