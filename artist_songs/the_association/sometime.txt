Sometimes talkin's not enough girl
Sometimes things just bring me down
Sometimes I just need you near me
Sometimes you're not around

Sometime things will work out always
Sometime I can't say just how
Sometime you'll not have it all girl
Sometime, sure isn't now

Is there heaven on earth
If there is, what's it worth
Are we really living, or are we a shadow of what life can be
Is the answer inside of me
(Is the answer inside of me)
(Is the answer inside)                         
Sometimes things, they seem so clear, girl
And sometimes things, they just seem strange
Sometimes I wonder what is real girl
Sometimes it's like a game

Is there heaven on earth
If there is, what's it worth
Are we really living, or are we a shadow of what life can be
Is the answer inside of me, is the answer inside of me

(Seek and you'll find)
(The answer's inside)
