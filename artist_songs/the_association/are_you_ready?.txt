You better find out who you're puttin' on
It ain't me, baby
You're gonna find me gone

Are you ready (are you ready)
Are you ready (are you ready)
Are you ready (are you ready)
Are you ready, baby, are you ready, ready for that

You call this lovin'
You wanna own my soul
You better hang on
To what you grab ahold

Are you ready (are you ready)
Are you ready (are you ready)
Are you ready (are you ready)
Are you ready, baby, are you ready, ready for that

You better change, girl, listen here, girl
Change your way for a better day, girl
It's a groove, girl, when it's right, girl
I...I'm gonna show you, yeah
When you're ready

You're gonna have love
Each and every night
You're gonna have love
That's really out of sight

Are you ready (are you ready)
Are you ready (are you ready)
Are you ready (are you ready)
Are you ready, baby, are you ready, ready for that

You better change, girl, listen here, girl
Change your way for a better day, girl
It's a groove, girl, when it's right, girl
I...I'm gonna show you, yeah
When you're ready

You're gonna have love
Each and every night
You're gonna have love
That's really out of sight

Are you ready (are you ready)
Are you ready (are you ready)
Are you ready (are you ready)
Are you ready, baby, are you ready, ready for that

Yes, are you ready, ready, ready, ready
Ready, ready, ready, ready
Ready (are you ready)
