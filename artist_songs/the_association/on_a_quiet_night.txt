On a quiet night
You can hear the rustling of the leaves
On a quiet night
Distant voices carry softly in the breeze

And I'm inside my room
Captured in a moment's thought
Strumming on a chord from my guitar
Silently, silently (silently)
So silently (so silently)

On a quiet night
Time hangs heavy in the air just like a cloud
I'm lying on my bed
Scratching my head, wondering what it's about

Are we all minstrels
Playing in a three-ring circus
Searching for a purpose that's not there
Silently, silently (silently)
So silently (so silently, so silently, so silently)

Everybody's thinking
Gotta get ahead, gotta get ahead
Everybody's drinking
Hurrying, worrying, playing the game
All acting the same
As I look out through my windowpane

On a quiet night
The wind, it can play tricks on your ear
Like some unsolved mystery
We all guess at the ending, but nobody comes near

Are we all minstrels
Playing in a three-ring circus
Searching for a purpose that's not there
Silently, silently (silently)
So silently (so silently, so silently, so silently)
