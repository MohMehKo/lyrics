I've been playing out of tune
Sittin' smug in my balloon
Strung out on my long phoney life
Cheated on your test
You thought I gave my best
But I hid it all
Afraid of what you'd find

I evangelized good will
Kept my fingers in the till
Masquerade of truth
Upon my face
But now I'm lonely, scared to death
I can hardly catch my breath
Suffocating in my own embrace

And come the fall
Oh, come the fall
When it's all said and done
When you've played your game thru
The only one you've got is you
The end of a series of one
Come the fall

So take a look inside your soul
Sort out all the things you stole
Return them to their owners if you can
Things like trust, love, and time
The other person's place in line
If you tell the truth I think they'll understand

And come the fall
Oh, come the fall
When it's all said and done
When you've played your game thru
The only one you've got is you
The end of a series of one
Come the fall
