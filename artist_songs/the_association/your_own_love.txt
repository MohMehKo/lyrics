You tell me you want me for your lover 
You say that you want me undercover 
Don't you know it's not that way 
I don't have time for the games you play 
Why can't you see 
She's true to me 
And I love her 

You've got what it takes to find your own love 
You've got what it takes, why be alone, love 
Life's too short to fool around 
The love I need I've already found 
Why can't you see 
Set yourself free 
For your own love 

Everything you need you have inside you 
All the things you see are just to guide you 
When you're down and when you're blue 
Just think of the things your love can do 
Just close your eyes 
Then realize 
Love's beside you 

And inside you 
And your known love 
Is your own love
