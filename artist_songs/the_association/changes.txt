Words don't come so easily to me
Sometimes I'm right, sometimes I'm wrong
Somehow I get along

Sometimes I'm mistaken
And believe me I am achin' from the times
I'm wrong within my song

But every time you're near
The words come out so neat and clear, and

You'll make some changes in me, let me tell you what I see
Changes in me, yeah

I know that you're not perfect
And I don't expect that kind of scene
You know just what I mean

I know sometimes you're walkin' and you're talkin'
You seem to get off the track
You most always get right back

It's only when you doubt yourself
That you get misplaced on your shelf

Just make your changes and see
You'll make some changes in me, yeah
You got the power and the reason for the rhyme
So lay it down I'll pick it up
And I'll put it in my mi-hi-hi-hind

Sometimes words don't make it so I'll play

So now I've sung my song
To you, I hope you enter but it's true
Sometimes I fall along the way
But then night always turns to day

You sing your song, I'll sing mine
And if they intertwine it's mighty good
If they don't it's understood, it's understood

You'll make some changes in me, let me tell you what I see
Changes in me, yeah
You got the power and the reason for the rhyme
So lay it down I'll pick it up
And I'll put it in my mi-hi-hi-hind  hi-hi-hind
Hi-hi-hind, hi-hi-hind
