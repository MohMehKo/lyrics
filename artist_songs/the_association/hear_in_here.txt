Sunny dancing days are stepping out of hiding
Taking me along the way I know I’m flying
Out rhythm out of time, it seems alright
How do I know what to do when there are no rules?

Hear in here cries a voice inside.
I tell you what to do and how to live your life
The changes will make you, you
and make you go where you’re going to
its all up to you

Over here over there
people running everywhere
Only trouble is they’re there they don’t know where
In out all around first you’re up then down
Whatcha’ gonna do when all you got left you

Hear in here cries a voice inside
I tell you what to do and how to live your life
The changes will make you, you
and make you go where you’re going to
its all up to you

Idle conversation making love raising love
speaks of revelation from way above
All this senseless hassles keeping us from love
Who is he who is she probably some one I could be

Hear in here cries a voice inside
I tell you what to do and how to live your life
The changes will make you, you
and make you go where you’re going to
its all up to you
