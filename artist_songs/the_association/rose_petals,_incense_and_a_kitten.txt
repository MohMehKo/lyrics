Drifting seagulls' lonely cry
Pacific air was honey
Whispered tide, warm and misty
Rolled in from flaming sky

Moonlight peeking through the cloud
Just to catch us smiling
All alone walking beaches
Holding hands, sharing dreams

I remember songs we sang
So sincere but laughing
Our hearts were dancing in the dawn
Rose petals, incense, and a kitten

[Guitar solo]

I remember songs we sang
So sincere but laughing
Our hearts were dancing in the dawn
Rose petals, incense, and a kitten

I remember a funny little kitten
Rose petals, incense and a kitten
I remember incense and a kitten
