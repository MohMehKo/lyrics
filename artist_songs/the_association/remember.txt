There'll come a day when you and I are one
A day when we no longer need the sun
Out of time and space we'll be
Aside all of eternity

You'll hear my voice with different ears
You'll live the dreams of timeless years
Your eyes will be the silver stars
That live and shine and see so far

Though thoughts and things have come between
And we exist in different scenes
I'll recognize you on the day
When all the darkness goes away
And we won't count our time by day

So sing your songs of now, my dear
And make your voice so loud and clear
And when the songs change - well, never mind (never mind)
For they were made to stay behind (stay behind)
And we were meant for nevertime
Remember
