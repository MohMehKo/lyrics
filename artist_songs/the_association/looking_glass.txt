You say that you're gonna go
I suppose you know what's best for you
So go, run with the wind
Taste the sun, feel the splendor of the world
I know you'll leave, but come home to me
At your journey's end I'll be here
I'll be near anytime you need me
Need me, I'll be here
So go, play in jeweled cities
Play with pretties, tie ribbons in your hair
And if you find the looking glass
Please stay and ask the other side
Who's that standing there, who's that standing there
What's her name
Does she still wear morning in her hair
And smile the same
The same... ahhhh-ahhhh-ah-ah-ahhhh
Who's that standing there, who's that standing there
What's her name
Does she still wear morning in her hair
And smile the same
The same... ahhhh-ahhhh-ah-ah-ahhhh
