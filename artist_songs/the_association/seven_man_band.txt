Well, I'm a day at a time
I'm a day at a time
Well, I'm a seeker and knower
In a six man mind
'Cause I'm a traveling man
Yes, I'm a traveling man
Well, I'm a comer and a goer
In a six man band
Well, I'm a California man, my instrument in hand
I'm electrified
On a fast flying trip, dirty laundry in my grip
Mostly drip-dry
We got the seventeen jewels that dictate the rules
And the time to fly, as we're passing by
We just got the time to say hello, and then a fast good-bye
I'm a traveling man
Yes, I'm a traveling man
Well, I'm a comer and a goer in a six man band
