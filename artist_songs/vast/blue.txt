Will you turn my mind away from
Everything that I have done
Hope is falling away from me
Hope is falling away from me

Let's go down with the ship
Let's slip into oblivion
Let's go down with the ship
Let's slip into, let's slip into
The blue

Will you turn my mind away from
Everything that I have done
Hope is falling away from me
Hope is falling away from me

Let's go down with the ship
Let's slip into oblivion
Let's go down with the ship
Let's slip into, let's slip into
The blue
