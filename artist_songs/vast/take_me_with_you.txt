All these favors for no one
Standing by you there 
In a palace by the sea
I'll give you everything

Drapes are moving in the breeze
Standing by you there
In a palace by the sea

I will save you
(I will save you)
If you save me
(If you save me)
Take me with you
(Take me with you)
Take me with you

Wherever you will go
I will go there with you
And I will love you

All these favors for no one
Standing by you mmm (?)
In the town that no one knows
And I live the morning by myself

I will save you
(I will save you)
If you save me
(If you save me)
Take me with you
(Take me with you)
Take me with you

Wherever you will go
I will go there with you
And I will love you
If you love me too

Take me with you
Take me with you
Take me with you
Take me with you
