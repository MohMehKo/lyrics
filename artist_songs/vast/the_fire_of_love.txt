I'll be hurt if I stay
I'll be hurt if I can leave
I will turn to stone even if I look away
I'm caught inside your trap
So deep inside your trap 
It feels good to me so deep inside your trap

Only fools say they get hurt 
only fools say they get burned
From the fire of love we all become reborn
Through the fire of love I've walked to be with you

You've known me for a while
You've lead me while asleep
And you tell me things you know I want to hear
I'm caught inside your trap
I'm deep inside your trap 
It feels good to me so deep inside your trap

Only fools say they get hurt 
only fools say they get burned
From the fire of love we all become reborn
Through the fire of love I've walked because of you

Only fools say they get hurt 
only fools say they get burned
From the fire of love we all become reborn
Through the fire of love I've walked because of you
