You dress looks good on you my love
And your house looks like it's heaven
Why are there
So many people outside of it
Everything you have will be

Oh you can't take anything with you
Except the love
The love I have for you 

Your eyes look like they're from God
And your face looks like it's from God
Why are you
Going to be outside eternity
Everything we know will be

Oh you can't take anything with you
Except the love
The love I have for you

I know you want to
