Guess I made a big mistake today
When I told you that I loved your pretty face
Everyone says I should walk away
From the lies that lie beneath that pretty face

In my dreams
I was lost
And you were nowhere to be found
You're too bad to bring back home and
I'm too good to feel this way

Guess I made a big mistake today
When I bought a dozen roses for your place
You're a zombie in a dress and I'm your clown
When I take you out you always look around

In my dreams
I cried out
You were nowhere to be found
Why am I the one who's crying
I'm too good to feel this way
Yeah

In my dreams
I was lost
And you were nowhere to be found
You're too bad to bring back home and
I'm too good to feel this way

You were nowhere to be found

Why am I the one who's crying
I'm too good to feel this way
