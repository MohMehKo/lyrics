Wine spills in my blood
And your blood spills in my soul
You have no control
You have no control

Dead angels speak to me sometimes
Giving me advice that I should hear
You have what I'm looking for 
Because you're close, because you're near

Wine spills in my blood tonight
Blood spills in my mouth
You are what I'm looking for
Oh you are just pretend

Dead angels speak to me sometimes
Giving me advice that I should hear
You have what I'm looking for 
Because you're close, because you're near

You are what I'm looking for
Oh you are what I'm looking for
You are what I'm looking for
Oh you

Dead angels speak to me sometimes
Giving me advice that I should hear
You are what I'm looking for 
Oh you, oh you

Oh you are what I'm looking for
Oh you, oh you
