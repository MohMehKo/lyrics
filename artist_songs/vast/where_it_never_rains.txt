When I touch your skin
A window arrives
And I go outside

I see rolling hills
Love has arrived
I should go outside

We're going where it never rains
Into another place
All the love I found in you
I'm taking with me too

This is the world they left to us

We're going where it never rains
Into another place
All the love I found in you
I'm taking with me too

This is the world they left to us
This is the world they left to us

We're going where it never rains
Into another place
All the love I found in you
I'm taking with me too

This is the world they left to us
The only world they left to us

The only world they left to us
