Do you feel like I do
Tired of everything
Can you feel what I can
Almost everything

I want to leave today
The sky is big and my life is small
I want to leave with you
So we can build a perfect garden

The stars are far away
I can see them with my eyes
I watch them burn away
Like the moments of my life

I want to leave today
The sky is big and my life is small
I want to leave with you 
So we can build a desert garden

The stars are far away
I can see them with my eyes
I watch them fade away
Like the moments of my life

Strange how the houses look
Exactly all the same
And you're just a slave like me
At least I know it's true

I want to leave today
The sky is big and my life is small
I want to leave with you
So we can build a desert garden

The stars are far away
I can see them in my eyes
We watch them fade away
Like the moments of our lives
