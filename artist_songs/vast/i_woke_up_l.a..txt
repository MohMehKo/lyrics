I woke up L.A
Then I went to sleep
I saw so many things
I know that you saw too
I walked a thousand miles
In clothes that children made
I felt so many things
I know that you felt too

Please forgive me,
You know I lost my mind
Please forgive me,
You know I lost the time
To say I love you

I woke up L.A.
Maybe it's a dream
To be with those who play
Dress up, make believe
And I flew a thousand miles
On wings that children made
With all the things you get
When you don't have anything

Please forgive me,
Cause I forgot my lines
Please forgive me,
While I still have time
To say you love me,
Yeah say you love me

I woke up L.A.
To sound the siren song
Everything is great
And everything is wrong
I flew a thousand miles
On wings my brothers made
Yeah, it's the thing you get
When you don't want anything

Please forgive me, yeah
Please forgive me, yeah
Say you love me
Say you love me
