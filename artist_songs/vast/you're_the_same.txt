She has been waiting all these years
And finally she's with me
She says her friends will not believe
She has been talking with me
She takes pictures of herself with nothing on
She wants to hurt me
I'm already too far gone
Oh my love
You seem different from other girls
But you're the same
Through the black light of my soul
Her hidden tears are glowing
She asked me how I could have known
Oh baby I'm all knowing
She reaches into me
With hands I cannot feel
She wants to leave me
How can I lose something I never had
Oh my love
Oh my darling
You're the same
Oh my love
Oh my love
You think you're different from other girls
But you're the same
