They whisper words into my ears
One speaks of truth and 
One speaks of my fears
My disabilities don't get in my way
I look to the future and live
Day to day

Three doors to go through
I only want the one
That leads to you
They say there's three doors to go through
I only want the one that leads to you
Because only one leads to you

And who's to blame
I could assume
The loneliness of my white room
I saw the circles
Inside the squares
And yet it can be so hard to be aware

Three doors to go through
I only want the one
That leads to you
They say there's three doors to go through
I only want the one that leads to you
Because only one leads to you

This your only chance at immortality
I'll give you strength
But I cannot give you the keys

This your only chance at immortality
I'll give you strength
But I cannot give you, not give you the keys

This your only chance at immortality
I'll give you strength
But I cannot give you the keys

Three doors to go through
I only want the one
That leads to you
They say there's three doors to go through
I only want the one that leads to you
Because only one leads to you
