I went in the desert
I went searching for the truth
I stumbled across you and 
I know you're not the truth

I went in the ocean
I went looking for some love
All I found is that I found
I haven't found enough

I stand alone now
I stand alone
But can you save me from myself

You are my temptation
You are my temptation 
To do what I knew is wrong

You are my temptation
You are my temptation
To do what I knew is wrong
What I knew is wrong was you
You

I stand alone now
I stand alone
Can you save me from myself
Oh please

They've been killing children
And nobody seems to care
They've been laughing at my god
My god I wouldn't dare

Oh you are my temptation
You are my temptation
You are my temptation

Oh you are my temptation
You are my temptation
You are my temptation
