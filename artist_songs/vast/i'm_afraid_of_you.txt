What are you typing
Are you still lying
Is there some truth to this
You have a degree in photography
And you take it out on me
Where are your friends
All of your girlfriends
Could they all be that bad
You ask me to hold you and then you're not there
It has something to do with your dad
I'm afraid of you
And all the things that I know love can do
Is guilt and emotion or some kind of tax
The man upstairs makes you pay
Where is the money and where is the time
That it looks like I just pissed away

I'm afraid of you
And all the things that I know love can do
Why do I put my rain into your fire
It has something to do with my mom
I'd never hurt you but I wouldn't worry if you were lost at sea
Where is my pride where is my self respect
Does it serve any purpose to you
I'd never leave I am too fucking scared of what you and your lawyers might do
I'm afraid of you
And all the things that I know love can do
I'm afraid of you
Everyone would be if they only knew
