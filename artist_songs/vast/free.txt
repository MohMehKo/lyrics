It's time to laugh, it's time to cry
It's time to be what you need to be
It won't be long 'till they are gone
And we can be what we want to be
I'm wanna run from everything
Everything that holds me down
Nothing to win, nothing to lose

You can't tell me what to do anymore
You can't tell me what to do anymore
Now I'm free, now I'm free, now I'm free

I'm gonna run, I'm gonna win
I'm gonna do what I need to do
'Cause it's time to be what I need to be
It's time to be what I need to be

You can't tell me what to do anymore
You can't tell me what to do anymore
Now I'm free, now I'm free, now I'm free
Oh yeah

I want to hold air in my hand
Own the one thing you can't buy
Nothing to win, nothing to lose
It's time to be what I need to be

I'm gonna run from everything
Everything that holds me down
Nothing to win, nothing to lose
It's time to be what I need to be

You can't tell me what to do anymore
You can't tell me what to do anymore
You can't tell me what to do anymore
Now I'm free, now I'm free, now I'm free
