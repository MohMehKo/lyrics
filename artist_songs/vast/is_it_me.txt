Smiles fill that shadow
Your eyes have nothing to say
You took me to this party
I don't think I should stay

Are you sad
Sad from all the wasted years
Are you lonely
Is it me you're looking for

It's too late to turn back now
The infection has been gone
Life here has no meaning
Life here is no fun

Are you empty
Maybe I can fill the hole
Are you lonely
Is it me you're looking for

Are you sad
Sad from all the wasted years
Are you lonely
Is it me you're looking for

Is it me you're looking for
