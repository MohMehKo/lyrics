That's my boy
American son
Hope I'm not around when he gets the idea to buy a gun

There's our boy
American son
Hope we're not to blame when he gets the idea to kill someone

Have you ever really loved someone?

The flags been broken
By an enemy
Raised on MTV, raised on you and me

Have you ever really loved someone?
Have you ever really loved someone?

Gone
Yeah it's gone
The land I have known of in my youth
Yeah it's gone and it's never coming back

Where's our savior
Not looking for a sign
Just want something to clean
The blood from my numb weary mind

Have you ever really loved someone?
Have you ever really loved someone?
