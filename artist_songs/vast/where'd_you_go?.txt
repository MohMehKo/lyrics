Where'd you go to that night
Where'd you go last night 
Is it somewhere I've never been before
Where'd you go to that night
Where'd you go last night 
Is it somewhere I've never been before

Where'd you go 
Where'd you go 
Where'd you go  
Where'd you go
and are you ever coming back to us
Will I ever see you smile at me again
Will I ever see you cry

Where'd you go to that night
Where'd you go my child
Is it somewhere I've never been before
Where'd you go to that night
Where'd you go my child
Is it somewhere I've never been before

Where'd you go 
Where'd you go 
Where'd you go  
Where'd you go  
and are you ever coming back to us
Will I ever see you smile at me again
Will I ever see you cry
Will I ever see you smile at me again
Will I ever see you cry
