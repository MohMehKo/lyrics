The rocket ship took me so far away
From the fields where I had lost my way
A million people with a million souls
On a rocket ship that lost control

All I found was you
All I found was you

The rocket ship took me so far away
From the fields where I had lost my way
A million people with a million souls
On a rocket ship that lost control

All I found was you
All I found was you

All I found was you
All I found was you

All I found was you
