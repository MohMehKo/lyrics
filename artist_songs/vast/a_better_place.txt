Days, how many days
Do I have until
I am set free to a better place
A place of love
A place of no tomorrows

Release me from this need I have of me

Hours, how many hours
Do I have until
I am set free to a better place
A place of love
A place of no misery

Release me from this need I have of me

When will you believe me
When I say these things to you
No one likes a liar baby
No one at all

When will you receive me
When I say these things to you
No one likes a liar baby
No one at all

I guess I have something to look forward to
I guess I have something to look forward to
I guess I have something to look forward to

When will you believe me
When I say these things to you
No one likes a liar baby
No one at all

No one likes a liar baby
No one at all
