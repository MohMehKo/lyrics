My name spells joy
I can't remember darkness
Except a dream
You saved my life

Do you wonder what you saw
Floating softly at the Niles edge

Wandering eyes
Commitments never can last
It feels so cold
To know our name
I've never known you
And I never will
What difference
Does indifference takes

Do you regret what you saw
Floating softly at the Niles edge
Alone
Alone

Do you regret
Regret what you did
Running softly
Softly from the Niles edge
Alone
Alone
