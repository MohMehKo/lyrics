Wanna stay here forever
Feeling the warmth from your skin
How was I to know life would
Make a joke out of all our love

Everything passing by is not coming back

How could I be so careless
It's not like we live forever
How was I to know life would
Make a joke out of all our love

Everything passing by is not coming back
Everything passing by is not coming back

Let me stay here forever
Feeling the love of your soul
I'd give up all my days
To have just one more day with you

Everything passing by is not coming back
Everything passing by is not coming back
Ever
