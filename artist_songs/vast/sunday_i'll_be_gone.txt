Hair of gold and eyes like stormy seas
You say you love me, want to marry me
And as I'm looking for the wedding ring
You say I don't have to spend anything

Stay with me, we'll be closer than the stars
Sunday I'll be gone
You can wear any colors that you want
Sunday I'll be gone

Your dad gave up on you so long ago
Your mother is someone you do not know
You have no money and you still get by
Everything I say makes you cry

Stay with me, we'll be closer than the stars
Sunday I'll be gone
You can wear any colors that you want
Sunday I'll be gone

What am I supposed to do
Sit around and wait for you
You ask for nothing and you want
Everything, oh

You want to take another photograph
Say it makes you think of me
If it only took a photograph
I think you'd still be here with me

Stay with me, we'll be closer than the stars
Sunday I'll be gone
And you can wear any colors that you want
Sunday I'll be gone

Yeah, Sunday I'll be gone
