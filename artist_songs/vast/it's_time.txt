I made you come to me
I'm still waiting for love to arrive
The flowers are gone they've been for a while 
I'm still waiting for them to arrive
I know you wanted this, I wanted it too
We've tried everything and it still isn't working

It's time... It's time
It's time to say a strong goodbye

I made you come to me
I'm still waiting for love to arrive
The flowers are gone they've been for a while 
I'm still waiting for them to arrive
I know you wanted this, I wanted it too
We've tried everything and it still isn't working

It's time... It's time
It's time to say our last goodbye
