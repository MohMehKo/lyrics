Take me to the places
You keep secret
Into a land of fur and diamonds
In my mind

'Cause there's a girl I'd like to love
And there's some things I'd like to say
To who is gonna hear

The gates of rock 'n' roll
Will never close on me
The gates of rock 'n' roll
Will never close on me

Take me to your mansions
Way beyond the gates
I will do anything to get there
You know I will

'Cause there's a man I'd like to be
And there's some things I'd like to say
To who is gonna care

'Cause there's a girl I'd like to love
And there's some things I'd like to say
To who is gonna hear

The gates of rock 'n' roll
Will never close on me
The gates of rock 'n' roll
Will never close on me

The gates of rock 'n' roll
Will never close on me
The gates of rock 'n' roll
Will never close on me
