I hear they're building casinos
A few miles from my old house
I think I'll take all my money
See if I can figure it out

So I sold my guitar
It's no use to me
If I can't be a star
Well I will be the next best thing

I thought by now that I would be a king and you'd be my queen
I thought by now the world would have stopped just to notice me

Maybe I'll join the navy
Get sent to attack 
Why would I fight for a country
That doesn't even have my back

So I sold my car
It's no use to me
Wherever you go there you are
And you aren't with me

I thought by now that I would be a king and you'd be my queen
I thought by now the world would have stopped just to notice me

I thought by now that I would be a king and you'd be my queen
I thought by now the world would have stopped just to notice me
