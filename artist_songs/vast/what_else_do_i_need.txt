I don't mind that I have 
Come back here again
In a place so far away
From normal life

They're racing to a prison
They will never leave
Worshipping a system
I just don't believe

I could stay right here
An never ever leave
What else do I need

I know that you don't like me
That's all right today
I love you but you bore me
Don't fuck up my day

'Cause I could stay right here
And never ever leave
What else do I need

I could stay right here
And never ever leave
What else do I need

People worry that 
I don't do anything
I think they really wonder
Why I'm not like them

Racing to a prison
They will never leave
Worshipping a system
I just don't believe

'Cause I could stay right here
And never ever leave
What else do I need

I could stay right here
And never ever leave
What else do I need
What else do I need
What else do I need
Yeah what else do I need
What else do I need
