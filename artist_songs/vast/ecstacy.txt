Addicted to poison
The poison is the cure sometimes
I have a secret
A secret written in the sky
I need to go down slow
I need to get up to the stars
I have a secret

Baby baby baby, you're like ecstasy
Maybe maybe maybe that's because I am on it
Baby baby baby (baby baby baby)
I'm gonna take some innocence from you (ooh)
