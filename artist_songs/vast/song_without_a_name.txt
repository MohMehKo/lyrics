Here is a song without a name
It comes to heal your pain
It comes with nothing else but love
No girls are dancing at my feet 
No suits are here to meet
The phone is ringing but I'm gone

You take me higher than anything has before
You take me higher than anything has before

I waited hours for this
And now I watch it fade
This moment that we share
Will always slip away
I need to run away
From you, from me

You take me higher than anything has before
You take me higher than anything has before

There's no walls between us now
Except that ones we bring
To hide the grace that we
Do not want to see
And I waited hours for this
Now we watch it fade
This moment that we share
Will always, always slip away

You take me higher than anything has before
You take me higher than anything has before
