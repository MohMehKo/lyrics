Love's a thrill
Love's a switch
Love is a shot
And I don't know what love is but I know what it's not
Suddenly you're outside of my dreams
You should have known I'd leave
Love is cold
Love is blind
Love is a sea
And I don't know what you need but I know it's not me
Suddenly you're outside of my dreams
You should have known I'd leave

Love's a thrill
Love's a switch
Love is a shot
And I don't know what you want but I know what you've got
Suddenly you're outside of my dreams
You should have known I'd leave
You're outside of my dreams
You should have known I'd leave
