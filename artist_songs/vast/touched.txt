Touched
You say that I am too
So much of what you say is true

I'll never find someone quite like you again
I'll never find someone quite like you, like you

The razors and the dying roses
Plead I don't leave you alone
The demi-gods and hungry ghosts
God, god knows I'm not at home

I'll never find someone quite like you again
I'll never find someone quite like you again

I, I looked into your eyes and saw 
A world that does not exist
I looked into your eyes
And saw a world I wish I was in

I'll never find someone quite as touched as you
I'll never love someone quite the way that I loved you
