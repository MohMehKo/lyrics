There's a place not that far from here
Where people go when their dreams have died
As I walk from its faceless streets
I must be the last one alive
Where are you, you're not with me
Numb my mind with a fantasy
Watching people live and die on screen

Where are you, you're not with me
Where are you, I'm free

You left me high and dry it changed me
You lied to me now I am angry
And if the sun comes in your room
And awakes you from your vanity
You won't find me 'cause I'll be
On top a mountain pissing on your grave
Na, na, na
Na, na, na
Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na
Na, na, na
Na, na, na, na

There's a place from where I just arrived
And I escaped the last one alive

Yeah, where are you 
You're not with me
Yeah, where are you
I'm free

You left me high and dry it changed me
You lied to me now I am angry
And if the sun comes in your room
And awakes you from your vanity
You won't find me 'cause I'll be
On top a mountain pissing on your grave

Na, na, na
Na, na, na
Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na
Na, na, na
Na, na, na, na
