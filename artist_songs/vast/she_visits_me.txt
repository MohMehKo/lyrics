She visits me
When I am weak
When I have no place to run
She always knows when I have no one
And then she comes, she comes to torture me

She visits me
When I must leave
When I have no place to hide
She always knows when I have someone
And then she comes, she comes to tempt me

She visits me
She visits me
From the corners of the past
She won't let go of my spirit yet
She comes, she comes to haunt me

She visits me 
She visits me
From the corners of the past
She won't let go of my spirit yet
She comes, she comes to haunt me

She visits me
