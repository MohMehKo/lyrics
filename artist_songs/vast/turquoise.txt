Looking for a penny on an empty beach
I've been looking for a lover who has eyes to see
While I'm here I wanna walk with you, hold your hand
In the sun, in the sun, in the sun, in the sun

Turquoise is the color I need to get clean
The forest burns, and with it something inside me

Looking for a way to leave the world today
But the world is gonna leave us all anyway
While I'm here I wanna walk with you, and hold your hand
In the sun, in the sun, in the sun

Turquoise is the color I need to get clean
The forest burns, and with it something inside me

Together, together
Together, together
Together, in the sun

I need to get clean
I need, I need, I need

Turquoise is the color I need to get clean
The forest burns, and with it something inside me

I'm looking for a way to leave the world today
