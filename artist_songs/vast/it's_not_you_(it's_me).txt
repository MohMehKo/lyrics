Lesson learned and it's calling my name
All the places are beautiful
Lesson learned and it's calling my name

I know that sorry isn't good enough
But it's not fair to me
Oh my lover you were good enough
It's not you it's me

There's a girl and she's calling my name
All the faces are beautiful
There's a girl and she's calling my name

I know that sorry isn't good enough
But it's not fair to me
Oh my lover you were good enough
It's not you it's me

La la la la la la la oh oh oh oh
Oh my lover you were good enough
It's not you it's me
