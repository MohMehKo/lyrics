Where is your god is he here right now
Is it you and me in this emptiness
If i was a saint would you be here now
With your jacket on the floor and your jewelry in the sink

Curl up your body it's fine
I've got something to pass the time
Drink and be merry tomorrow we die
Tonight I'm yours and your kind of mine

If you have regrets don't have them now
Its just you and me in this forgotten town
Your daddy always said nice girls don?t mess around
Did your daddy ever say you were nice

Curl up your body It's fine
I've got something to pass the time

Drink and be merry tommorow we die
Tonight im yours and your kind of mine

If your going to leave than leave right now
Before i start to sing my hotel song
Check out time is noon wyoue can stay till one
No I don't say that to just anyone

Curl up your body It's fine
I've got something to pass the time
Drink and be merry tommorow we die
Tonight im yours and your kind of mine
Tonight im yours and your kind of mine
