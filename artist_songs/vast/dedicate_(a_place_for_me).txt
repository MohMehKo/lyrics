People say that I loved you too much
Because I think about you now
And it's been two years
Images of you with him
Play again and again inside my head
I hope you fall
I hope you fail

If you ever loved me
If you ever knew me
You should know that I am gone
Have you ever needed
Have you ever needed
Dedicate a place for me

Thoughts of you 
Flow into me like poison
No one can see
And no one can feel

I'm too small
I'm too big
Too blind to see you're shining
Way over head
I hope you fall

If you ever loved me
If you ever knew me
You should know that I am gone
Have you ever needed
Have you ever needed
Dedicate a place for me

I'm gone and I'm forgotten
Maybe it's like I never existed at all

If you ever loved me
If you ever knew me
You should know that I am gone
Have you ever needed
Have you ever needed
Dedicate a place for me

You should know that I am gone
Have you ever needed
