Closed eyes in the dark
Whispering when no one's around
The night sky looks like blue
My touch does not affect you

I wait for the night to follow me
Like sugarplums, like sugar drums
I wait for the night to conquer me again
I can't say yes, I can't say no to you

We bring our stories with us
We light a candle for beauty's sake
Are you feeling the bliss
I am darling, I am

I wait for the night to follow me
With sugarplums, with sugar drums
I wait for the night to conquer me again
I can't say yes, I can't say no to you

I wait for the night to conquer me again
I can't say yes, I can't say no to you
