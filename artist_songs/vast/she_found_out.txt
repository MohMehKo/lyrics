Wait, wait with me
I am useless when I'm alone
Stay, stay with me
At least until she gets home

There's nothing I can do to make it right
She found out about the darkness last night
There's nothing I can say to make her stay
She found out about the darkness today

Wait, wait with me
I am useless when I think
Stay, stay with me
I am useless when I drink

There's nothing I can do to make it right
She found out about the madness last night
There's nothing I can say to make her stay
She found out about the darkness today

Fall on me, like a dying angel
Whispered truths, better unsaid
'Cause I can hear what her friends are saying
She's better off alone

There's nothing I can do to make it right
She found out about the madness last night
There's nothing I can say to make her stay
She found out about the darkness today
