Hey girl I've been lonely 
I've been lonely for so long
Hey girl don't be scared 
don't be scared of this

It's only fate, it's only fate 
that brought me close to you
And no one can understand
no one could know how much I love you

Hey girl I've been searching
I've been searching for so long
Hey now don't be scared 
don't be scared of this

It's only fate, it's only fate 
that brought me close to you
And no one can understand
no one could know how much I love you

It's only fate, it's only fate 
that brought me close to you now
And no one can understand
no one could know how much I love you
