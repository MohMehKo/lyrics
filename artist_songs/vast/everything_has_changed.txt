I've never had to think about the future
I've never had to think about the past
Since the night we met
Everything has changed
Everything has changed

I've been living without love inside my heart
I've been traveling without a destination
Since we have been talking
Everything has changed
Everything has changed

I've always thought that I would die alone
I've never really loved someone before
Since the night we met
Everything has changed
Everything has changed
Everything has changed
