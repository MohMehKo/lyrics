I stood on mountaintops
That overlooked the world
I can't find anything
Except a void inside
I went to places where
I could forget your name
I can't find anything
Except a void inside

I don't have anything
Because I don't have you
I don't have anything

What can I buy to make
The sky turn blue again
Where can I go to feel
Like I'm alive again
Show me the places
Where I can forget your name
I can't find anything
Except a void inside

I don't have anything
Because I don't have you
I don't have anything

I've been stripped of everything
Except some flesh that bleeds 
And I've been robbed of everything
Except a soul, except a soul
That needs:you, sweet you

I don't have anything
Because I don't have you
I don't have anything
