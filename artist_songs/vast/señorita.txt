Working in fields with the sweat on my brow gets so lonely
Until I think about my Señorita back at home
This week I'll have enough cash to buy clothes for my children
Working all day in the fields to bring it all back home
(I am a prisoner)

I live to see the day
He comes upon a horse
I live to see the day he comes for me
I live to see the day

They drive and they sneer in their Mercedes Benz it's a hundred
Like I'm some pet who is there just to bring them their roses
(I am a prisoner)
I spent a year living in an old van with no engine
I do it all for my Señorita down in Mexico
(I am a prisoner)

I live to see the day
She comes upon a horse
I live to see the day she comes for me
(I am a prisoner)

I live to see the day
She comes upon a horse
I live to see the day she comes for me

I love you more than life
(I am a prisoner)

I'm losing my mind
I am losing the sense of my manhood
I cannot find the shade to cool my anger down
My first son Jesus was born under a bridge around Broadway
He's living with a Señorita down in Mexico
(I am a prisoner)

I live to see the day
She comes upon a horse
I live to see the day she comes for me
(I am a prisoner)

I live to see the day
She comes upon a horse
I live to see the day she comes for me

She comes for me
She comes for me
She comes for me
She comes for me

I, I love you more than life
I love you more than life
