It's after two 
And I am all alone 
she appears 
She says she'll get me home 
We end up lost 
Inside a suburban maze 
And then she says her house is on the way

I should leave 
It's time to go back home now 
I should leave 
You're too young for me 

She has a man 
She says he's just a boy 
And she won't bite 
Unless it brings me joy 
I don't know where all the time has gone 
I don't know where all the years have gone 

I should leave 
Put your clothes back on now 
I should leave 
You're too young for me 

I should leave 
It's time to go back home now 
I should leave 
You're too young for me

You're too young for me
You're too young
