She'll ask you questions and she'll put you in her dreams
Every person has a different fantasy
Some go for glory others only want some cash
But most of them just need some love they've never had

No one wants to hear you sing tonight
No one want to drink your wine
They only came to dance and feel the golden light
They only love you when you die

In an empty room she whispers in my ear
No one wants to see a man down on his knees
You're too tired to fight and you're too scared to win
Let your feelings go and let the games begin

No one wants to hear you sing tonight
No one want to hear you whine
They only came to dance and have a real good time
They only love you when you die

No one wants to hear you sing tonight
No one want to drink your wine
They only came to hear that simple melody
They sound you make before you die

They only love you when you die
