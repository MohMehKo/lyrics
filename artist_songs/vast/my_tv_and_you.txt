My TV and you
It's the only place to be 
Nothing else to do
Nothing else to see
A room without a view
Has so much for me and you
I was born to stare
At stars on ceiling walls

It's all I need
It's all I ever needed
Until the world is gone

Take me how I am
'cause you know I'll never change
I was born to stare
At who stares back at me

If I make it up
To that big show in the sky
All I really want
Is my TV and you

It's all I need
It's all I ever needed
Until the world is gone
Da, da, da:

It's all I need
It's all I ever needed
My love for life is gone

It's all I need
It's all I ever needed
My love for life is gone
