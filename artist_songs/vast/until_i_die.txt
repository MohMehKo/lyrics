I'll be your shelter
I'll be your rain
When you are crazy I'll be sane
When you are dangerous
I'll let you go
You know I should
I wanna stay with you all of my life
I wanna be with you until I die
Until I die
When you are naked
I'll bring you some clothes 
When you are needed
I won't leave you alone
When you are dangerous
I'll let you go
You know I could
But I wanna stay with you all of my life
I wanna be with you until I die
Until I die
