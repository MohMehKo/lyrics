Where do I put the shame
It feels like a broken toy
I can't play with anymore

Where do I put the hate
To a pixilated screen
I can't watch anymore

All I know is that I'm here 
Drifting somewhere in the vast
Somewhere in eternity
And I never want to leave

Where do I put the books
There's so many I could read
But they all are filled with lies

Where do I put all the lies
There's so many I could say
But it seems they're in the books

I have faith that you're out there 
Living high up in the vast
Somewhere in eternity
And you're never gonna leave

Have I been telling lies to myself
Hold me now you know
I am so afraid to be at all

Have I been telling lies to myself
Hold me now you know
I am so afraid to love at all

I looked up and I saw the moon
Is it the same one that betrayed you
I looked up and I saw my place
I looked in and I felt no hate

Where do I put the love
Where do I put the love
Yeah, where do I put the love
