Jesus Christ
Are you the son of God
I want to know
You ask that I believe

Not one day goes by
That I don't compromise your love
For the cold love of the world
It's killing me through

My own evil pride
Not one day goes by 
That I don't know that I'm dying

Jesus Christ
Are you the savior of the world
I want to see
But I still believe

Not one day goes by
That I don't realize 
I know that no one will ever know
Where the flowers go

When they are gone
Not one day goes by that I don't
Know that I'm dying

I want to say 
You all are too
I want to say
My love
I want to say
I want to say
You all are too
