Where have you gone
My love, my friend
Somewhere without the rain
I feel afraid now, I feel alone
Will we meet again

Can you recall what we once knew
Somewhere without the pain
I feel afraid now, but not alone
We will meet again

I can't hear your voice
But you know I feel your soul

I can't hear your voice
But you know I feel your soul

Where have you gone
My love, my friend
Somewhere without any pain
I'm not afraid now, I'm not alone
We will meet again
