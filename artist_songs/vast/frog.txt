Hopping through the rainforest
Escaping the fire like all the rest
Trying to keep my species alive
Looking for lilies and tasty flies

My legs are pumping as fast they need to
My legs are drying as quick as glue
I look at the sun for one of my kind
I am a frog and I have a mind

You sold me out, you sold me out
Yeah I was a frog and now I am a song

Less and less of us everyday
The humans have screwed us the human way
Trees are falling without a sound
Into a river where they drown

You sold me out, you sold me out
Yeah I was a frog and now I am a song

And I'm running just to be
Yeah I'm hoping you'll kiss me  
Yeah I'm running just to be 
Just to be alive

Less and less of us everyday
The humans have screwed us the human way
Trees are falling without a sound
Into a river where they drown

And you sold me out, you sold me out
Yeah I was a frog and now I am a song
