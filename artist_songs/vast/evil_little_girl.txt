Why do you stand in the rain and wait for me
With dark clothes, dark thoughts on your mind
You evil little:girl

Evil
Evil little girl
You were born to make me cry

Who am I to be here right now
Who am I to be here

Take my heart and throw it in a fire
Your mother must have run a school

You were trained to make me cry

Who am I to be here right now
Who am I to be here

Evil little girl
You were born to make me cry

Evil little girl
You were born to sing along

Evil little girl
You were born to make me cry
