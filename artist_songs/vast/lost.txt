There's no angels here
Just a sun to light the way
To places where my friends
Turn to strangers

Ooh my lover on a long, long empty road
Ooh sweet lover I got lost

There's no angels here
Just a light to lead the way
There's no innocence
Only strangers

Ooh my lover on a long, long empty road
Ooh sweet lover I got lost

I need to get back home

Ooh my lover on a long, long empty road
Ooh sweet lover I got lost

I need to get back home
