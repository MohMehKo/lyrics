I went walking late last night to clear my head
As the moon began to touch my skin

I began to dream of you
And I began to think of you my love
Here's to all the people I have lost
Here's to all the people I have loved

I began to dream of you
And I began to miss you my love
Here's to all the people I have lost
Here's to all the people I have loved

I sometimes wonder how much you have missed
I can say I can say it's not that much
Here's to all the people I have lost
Here's to all the people I have loved

I sometimes wonder where you all have gone
Here's to all the people I have lost
