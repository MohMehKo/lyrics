Boy I love you all through the night
I love you all through the night
Boy I love you all through the night
I love you all through the night

Boy I love you all through the night
Through the night, through the night

You got me working my body
You got me feeling so naughty
Loving everything about it, woah oh oh
You got me working my body
You got me feeling so naughty
Loving everything about it, woah oh oh

You pick up me way up high
So give me all your love tonight
I fell for a boy just before midnight

I love you all through the night

Loving everything about it, woah oh oh
You got me working my body
You got me feeling so naughty
Loving everything about it, woah oh oh

Baby you stole my heart
You pick up me way up high
So give me all your love tonight
I fell for a boy just before midnight
