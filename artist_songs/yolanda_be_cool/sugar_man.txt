Sugar man, won't you hurry
'cos I'm tired of these scenes
For a blue coin won't you bring back
All those colors to my dreams

Sugar man, won't you hurry
'cos I'm tired of these scenes
For a blue coin won't you bring back
All those colors to my dreams

Sugar man

Sugar man

Sugar man

Sugar man

Silver magic ships you carry
Jumpers, coke, sweet Mary Jane

Sugar man, won't you hurry
'cos I'm tired of these scenes
For a blue coin won't you bring back
All those colors to my dreams

Sugar man you're the answer
That makes my questions disappear
Sugar man 'cos I'm weary
Of those double games I hear

Sugar man... sugar man... sugar man

Bring back....

All those colors to my dreams

Sugar man

Sugar man

Sugar man

Sugar man

Sugar man
