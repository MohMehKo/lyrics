The doors are closed and walls are white
Someone calls but I don't want to talk tonight
Stay away you all want to stay away
I'm going to be all right, all right
Within the arms of slumber, going to leave it all behind, mmm yeah
Comatose gone under, like all the other times

With pride and disdain I'm going to ignore this pain
When someone falls you're supposed to get up again
I try to oblige but I, I can't tonight
I'm going to be all right, all right
Within the arms of slumber, going to leave it all behind, mmm
Comatose gone under, like all the other times, yeah

Comfort of my dreams I resign myself to you
Dream as I might, oh I'm sleeping when I'm blue
Such a pleasure when I feel myself go under
Stay away, stay away while I'm in the arms of slumber
And I'm leaving it all behind
Mmm, going to leave it all behind

The magic of sweet morpheus, you're doing it once again
You saved me from my sadness, you saved me from my pain

Protect me from depression, protect me one more night
And I'll be all right, all right

Within the arms of slumber leaving it all behind, mm
Comatose gone under, like all the other times, yeah

Comfort of my dreams I resign myself to you
Dream as I might, oh I'm sleeping when I'm blue
Such a pleasure when I feel myself go under
Stay away, stay away while I'm in the arms of slumber

Comfort of my dreams I resign myself to you
Dream as I might, well I'm sleeping when I'm blue
Such a pleasure when I feel myself go under
So stay away, stay away while I'm in the arms of slumber
And I'm leaving it all behind, mmmhm

Stay away you all want to stay away
Stay away you all want to stay away
Stay away you all want to stay away
Stay away you all want to stay away
