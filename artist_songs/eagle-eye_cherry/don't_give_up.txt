All our dreams are gone
With a loss of faith
We're still hanging on
For another day
It's so hard to see
That it's going to get better
And when will that be
It's hard to say

We must believe
That if we give we will receive
Yes we must believe
That it's going to get better

Don't give up
Never give up
We won't stop
Giving all we got

Don't Give up
Never give up
We won't stop
Giving all we got

Now we're breaking away
From what holds us down
This could be the day
That brings out the light
Now we're marching on
With the will of never giving up
This time we'll have won
Without a fight

We must believe
That if we give we will receive
Yes we must believe
That it's going to get better

Don't give up
Never give up
We won't stop
Giving all we got

Don't give up
Never give up
We won't stop
Giving all we got

Don't give up
Never give up
We won't stop
Giving all we got

We must believe
That if we give we will receive
Yes we must believe
That it's going to get better

Don't give up
Never give up
We won't stop
Giving all we got
