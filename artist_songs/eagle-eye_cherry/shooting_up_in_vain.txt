Waking up as the sun goes down
Body all in pain
Straight out the door to the worst part of town
Shooting up in vain

Slips all his money to the man
Here we go again....here we go again
Got bags of mercy in the palm of his hand
Shooting up in vain

[CHORUS:]
So he heads for the closest rooftop
And now he's free with the skyline begind
But it won't be long until his high will drop
Then you know what he'll try to find
Such a shame

Now he's back on that hunt for more
Body all in pain
Wanting to get back to where he was before
Shooting up in vain
So now he goes and sells his wedding ring
Here we go again......here we go again
But now he's sold exactly everything
Shooting up in vain

[CHORUS]

Such a shame

Down to the bed as the sun goes up
Body all in pain
Now he swears he's going to stop
Shooting up in vain
He's Dr. Jekyll and he's Mr. Hyde
He's got to listen to that voice deep inside
Got a one-way ticket on a derailed train
Got a one-way ticket on a derailed train
Shooting up in vain
Such a shame
Such a shame

Got a one-way ticket on a derailed train

Got to stop shooting up in vain.............[REPEAT]
