I met the Devil in disguise
With his rainbow wings and a pack of lies
I had my suspicions but they were ignored

[CHORUS:]
Far away the angel cries
How far away the angel sings
Don't sell your soul for a pack of lies
Don't sell your soul

I watched him preach from the book of greed
With promises of glory and how we'll succeed
I had my suspicions but they were ignored

[CHORUS (2x)]
