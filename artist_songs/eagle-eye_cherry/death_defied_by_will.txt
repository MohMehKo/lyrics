He only thought he was going for the thrill of a ride
Wasn't in the plan to be gone for long
But he keeps looking back over his shoulder, yeah
He knows that something might go wrong

The ride it ain't smooth that is for sure
Strange mood what is the cure
He's got that feeling of impending doom
Like being trapped in a casket inside a tomb, oh

Death defied by will
Like a drug that doesn't kill
Boy you gotta learn what's true
Death defied by will
Like a drug that doesn't kill
Oh, the joke is on you

You ought to know better
You ought to know better

Now, he is determined to outsmart this snake
With conviction he will stand his ground
Feeling invincible like death itself
But his immortality won't be found

What should he say at his own wake
That he refuses to fulfil his fate
He doesn't know that this is his last drive
On the road we call alive

Death defied by will
Like a drug that doesn't kill
Boy you gotta learn what's true
Death defied by will
Like a drug that doesn't kill

Now the joke is on you

Now the time has come
You can't play around, and you ought to know
You ought to know better
You ought to know better

Death defied by will
Like a drug that doesn't kill
Boy you gotta learn what's true
Death defied by will
Like a drug that doesn't kill
Now the joke is on you

You ought to know better
You ought to know better

Ala-la-la-la-laa

Death defied by will
Like a drug that doesn't kill
Boy you gotta learn what's true
Death defied by will
Like a drug that doesn't kill
Now the joke is on, the joke is on you

(You ought to know better)
Oh, joke is on you
(You ought to know better)
Oh, the joke is on you
(You ought to know better)
Ought to know better, yeah
(You ought to know better, better, joke is on you)
You ought to know better
