mmmmhmmm
mmmmmmmm
can we go.... back
mmmhmmm
yeah

another night i cry once again
without you in my life my world would come to an end
and i know.. that what we shared was deep in our hearts
from the start
i saw your face and i fell in love

i can't even explain
all the pain i been through
girl, i know i was wrong
and nothing matters but you
i need you in my life
in my heart here to stay
for always...
for always~

[Chorus:]
can we go back to the way it was
i will do nothing just to have you right here next to me
can we go back the way it was
i will do anything just to have you back here babe

baby baby

if you could find it in your heart to forgive me at all
girl i would promise you all my love
oh all my love
is for you
give me one more chance to prove my love to you

i'll give my all to you this time around
i'll be shure that we will be together
forever we will stand
take me by the hand
can we go back to the way it was...

[Chorus (x2)]


mmm hmmm
ohhh ohh yeah babe
ohh ayy ayy yeah
mmm hmm mmm

can we go back
go back
can we go back
go back
can we go back
go back
can we go back
