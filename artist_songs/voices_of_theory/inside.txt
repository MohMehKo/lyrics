(Turn the lights low)

I've been peepin you lately
you got that style thats drivin me crazy
I ain't gonna lie and try to fake it
it's just a boomin party baby
And all I wanna do is be inside

[Chorus:]
Let me I slide inside
I'll make sure it's right
There's no need to feel shy
Come on let's make this feel right
Let me I slide inside
I'll make sure it's right
There's no need to feel shy
Come on let's make this feel right

I don't wanna lose another moment
let's jump in my jeep
And be on our way
To a better place
this ain't gonna be a normal day, babe
Just wait till you see what's instore
There's no doubt I'll be yours

[Chorus]

So Lay down
Don't be afraid of me baby
I'll give you all the lovin you need
So Lay down
Don't be afraid of me baby
I'll give you all the lovin you need

[Chorus]
