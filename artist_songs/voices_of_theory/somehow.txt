Every night i pray that maybe one day we would last a while... 
We could fly somehow.
Baby, if you wanted too, we could be brand new, 
if you knew somehow it was all worth while.

Now it's about that time we should sit and reminisce.
We done passed the test of time.
There's so much meaning in our kiss.
Just take a look back in the past.
Think of all that we've been through... 
and i just thought that i should let you know;
I wanna start our love brand new... ooh

True love is rare...
So we should be together...
But we let our love go wrong.

Every night i pray that maybe one day (i pray) we would last a while...
We could flow somehow (flow somehow). 
Baby, if you wanted too (want too), we could be brand new (oh we could be brand new), 
if you knew somehow (oh) it was all worth while (it's was all worth while).

See you never realize...
How the love that we both shared could somehow drift away in time.
I think of how it use to be (oh yeah)  
We can feel that love once again. 
You would put your trust in me.

Where did our love go wrong? (Where did our love go wrong?)
We should be together (baby...)
Our love use to be so strong (our love use to be so strong)
Why? (tell me why)(here we go, here we go)

I put a hundred and fifty percent in... to catch ya.
I tried to get at ya from the beginning
Let's me and you think about all that we've been through.
And if you want to, we could be brand new.
Keep it real girl, keep it true. No exceptions.
You could be my angel and i'll be your protection.
If time found it was... Tell me why, tell me how...
