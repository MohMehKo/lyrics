Tonight, I'm the last man standing
Threw a wish down the well, but I fell in after
Tryna drown another sorrow
Hold it down till tomorrow
It's a dangerous game, but I keep on gambling
Go to hell or help me get there faster
No one here to come and save me
Got that fear, but who can blame me?

Start running
Running
Here's the rapture
Coming
They gonna catch ya
We give it all or nothing
We gotta stand for something
So fuck it, fuck it
It's a disaster
They never gonna give us what we're after
We give it all or nothing
We gotta stand for something
We gotta stand for something
We gotta stand for something

This time, yeah, it's really happening
We gonna hurt worse than we first imagined
When they tear the city right out
But it's worth the final showdown
Maybe underground, but we keep on rising
Ashes to ashes, only hope surviving
It's my last drink, make it a strong one
'Cause they be messing with the wrong one

Start running
Running
Here's the rapture
Coming
They gonna catch ya
We give it all or nothing
We gotta stand for something
Fuck it, fuck it
It's a disaster
They never gonna give us what we're after
We give it all or nothing
'Cause we gotta stand for something
We gotta stand for something
We gotta stand for something

Cause it's the rapture
Cause it's the rapture
We gotta stand for something
