You know the way my blood runs
Cause darlin' you're the only one
Can you and I go somewhere?
Go somewhere we can be alone
Lying like John and Yoko
Or fake our deaths and leave
Am I tripping, are you with me?
Cause darlin' you're the only one

The world is going mad
You and I can hide away
I can't stand the TV screen
Turn it off, pull the plug
They can try, they won't find us

Slow down your heartbeat
Close your eyes and don't speak
And lay with my body
Play dead, play dead with me
No need to escape
We can find our own way
You got me hiding in cupboards
Play dead, play dead with me

We'll stock up some ration
So we don't have to leave this room
I'm dead, don't care what happens
As long as I'm in here wth you

Cause the world is going mad
You and I should hide away
I can't stand the TV screen
Turn it off, pull the plug
They can try, they won't find us

Slow down your heartbeat
Close your eyes and don't speak
And lay with my body
Play dead, play dead with me
No need to escape
We can find our own way
You got me hiding in cupboards
Play dead, play dead with me

You know that I was quiet
We'll walk outside into the show
We'll run a light in thousands
Cause everybody else is growing old

So slow down your heartbeat
Close your eyes and don't speak
Lay here with my body
Play dead
Slow down your heartbeat
Close your eyes and don't speak
And lay with my body
Play dead, play dead with me
No need to escape
We can find our own way
You got me hiding in cupboards
Play dead, play dead with me
Play dead with me
Play dead, play dead with me
