I'm strumming on the corner
About to catch last the train home
I'll have to jump the barriers
So can you spare a penny for my thoughts
I've been praised upon the pavements
Passers by don't pay much.
Chased away by neighbours,
Seen things you couldn't make up
If these streets could talk
They'd tell a story or two
I'll paint a picture for you

I can tell you what it feels like
To lose your home on a cold night
Can you see the blood in my red eyes
Have another toke, we'll forget life

So come and fly away with me
To a place where we could be anyone we wanna be
We can bottle up our fear
Brew a taste so sweet
Knock us off our feet
And we'll
Burn our troubles
Inhale them all
Paint the future on a fractured wall
So come and fly away with me
To a place where we could anyone we wanna be

Still in the station when I wake up
I missed the last train home
Jump back over the barriers
No one's got a penny for my flaws
I'm asleep upon the pavement
Passersby don't say much, tutted at by strangers
Dreamt things you'd never dream of
If these streets could talk they'd tell a story or two
I'll paint a picture for you

I can tell you what it feels like
To lose something you love on a cold night
As the cars roll by under the street lights
There's only one way I can forget life

So come and fly away with me
To a place where we could be anyone we wanna be
We can bottle up ourfear
Brew a taste so sweet
Knock us off our feet
And we'll,
Burn our troubles
Inhale them all
Paint the future on a fractured wall
So come and fly away with me
To a place where we could anyone we wanna be

We could be anyone we wanna be
We could be anyone we wanna be

These streets I'm walking
They've started talking to me
Can't you see?
There's only one way outta here
We have to face the things we fear
And we could be anyone we wanna be
Yeah we could be anyone we wanna be

So come and fly away with me
To a place where we could be anyone we wanna be
We can bottle up our fear
Brew a taste so sweet
Knock us off our feet
And we'll,
Burn our troubles
Inhale them all
Paint the future on a fractured wall
So come and fly away with me
To a place where we could be anyone we wanna be

We could be anyone we wanna be
We could be anyone we wanna be
