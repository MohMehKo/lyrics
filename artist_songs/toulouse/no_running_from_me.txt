Well I'm alive
Your blood is pumping through these veins
I'll catch you by surprise
I'm coming back to take the rein

Now you're free and well
Just giving a while
Time will tell
You're under my spell, oh

There ain't no running from me, no, no, no
There ain't no running from me, yeah
Oh no

I'm not a saint
Nor am I one for smooth edges
When I'm around
Calamity comes out to play

How did you heard the news
That I get to chose
How it plays out
No matter how you scream and shout

There ain't no running from me, no, no, no, no
There ain't no running from me, yeah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
There ain't no running from me
Oh no

You're sure you don't want the back, mmh
You're sure you don't want the back
Here I say

There ain't no running from me, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
There ain't no running from me, no, no, no, no, no, no
There ain't no running away to hide, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
No no, oh no
