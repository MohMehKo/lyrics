I weep for the world, for the world
Where we sleep, the tears fall
As a crystal of a different salt
But we gotta get up for the lonely
We gotta smile, yeah, for the kids
Like everything's okay

It is well, it is well
With my soul, with my soul
It is well with my soul
It is well, it is well
With my soul, with my soul
It is well with my soul

I sing with trembling voice, a lonely soul
For freedom, but how much longer I have
Before we see our victory's run
But we gotta wash our hands before dinner
And pray our soul's to keep
'Til everything's okay
I sing, but [?]

It is well, it is well
With my soul, with my soul
It is well with my soul
It is well, it is well
With my soul, with my soul
It is well with my soul
