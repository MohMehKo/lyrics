I'ma need you to speak louder
Then you're probably used to
So I know you care
You gonna have to move closer
Then is usually comfortable
So I know you near

Your silence screams louder than murder in my ears
And it's all my fault
Don't make me have to start another fire in here
So I can feel some warmth, oh

You have to know I need you here
Say something quick
So I know that you care for me
You have to know I need you here
Say something quick
So I know that you care for me
Like I care for you

I'ma need you to forgive me
If I seem too vulnerable
I need to know you care
I'd rather you rain up my parade
Then shine somewhere else
So I know you're near

Your silence screams louder than murder in my ears
And it's all my fault, all my fault
Don't make me have to start another fire in here
So I can feel so warm, oh

You have to know I need you here
Say something quick
So I know that you care for me
You have to know I need you here
Say something quick
So I know that you care for me
Like I care for you

Ooh oh
Oh oh, say something quick
You, you, you, you, you, you
Oh yeah
Oh oh

You have to know I need you here
Say something quick
So I know that you care for me
You have to know I need you
Say something quick
So I know that you care for me
Like I care for you
