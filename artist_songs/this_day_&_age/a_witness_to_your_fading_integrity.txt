I've seen so many people change
And now I know
Nothing and no one stays the same
And out of this
What have you gained
Other than searching for
Things that even you aren't sure of
Fading from the ones you've grown to love
I hope you're happy
Cause I don't understand

I'd give up anything
For just one day with you
Cause this was you
This was true
Cause this was you
This was true
I'll never compromise what I, what I believe
That's the difference between you and me

I've seen so many people change
And now I know
Nothing and no one stays the same
And out of this
What have you gained
Other than searching for
Things that even you aren't sure of
Fading from the ones you've grown to love
I hope that you're happy
Cause I don't understand

I'd give up anything
For just one day with you
Cause this was you
This was true
Cause this was you
And this was true
