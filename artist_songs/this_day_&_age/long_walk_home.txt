finding myself in a place i've never been where i don't know myself or anyone else i can dream about the past or i can
just let it go i lost track of time five days ago what is it about you that makes me want to stay is it all the love or is
it just the pain

[chorus]
don't leave me now we've come to far just to set our eyes on a new star i'll ride on clouds til you come down just
promise me you'll always leave the ground

in the drivers seat is my self-esteem where i know that the heart should be i'm cleaning off these shelves to show you
how i've changed and if all goes well tonight we'll call for rain i'm moving pass the past at the slowest of speeds hoping
that our loves exceeds our insecurities

[chorus]

finding myself finding myself finding myself finding myself finding myself find yourself

i'm running in circles it's you i'm thinking of and if you don't want to talk then this isn't love a new destination i'll
say my goodbyes with my back turned to you at least i know we tried

[chorus x2]
