goodbye's not the word that he wants to hear your life spent put on hold for almost two years you've tried and you've
tried and you gave it your all its sad to say cuz dreams are too small

[chorus]
and we.. used to be.. afraid
but we found our way
and we.. used to be.. afraid
but we found our way

hello to a broken world that has gone on without you in twenty years you haven't found any evidence of truth i don't
blame you for questioning why people fall in love its all the things you were taught to run from

[chorus x2]
