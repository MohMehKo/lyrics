to say that apologies only come when mistakes are made is to know for the next 3 months without hesitation she patiently
waits to watch the season slowly pass without a breath or a smile is to love those same eyes focused on you for all this
while 

[chorus]
start over on monday and everything will turn out just the way she planned

to say clouds and skyscrapers they remind me of her is to see that something out of reach could bring 2 people back
together to take the time to step back and look into his past is to search within himself to see why nothing could ever
last

[chorus]

and everything will turn out just the way she planned

i'm falling from the place where i stood won't someone take my hand cuz i don't understand
[chorus x2]
