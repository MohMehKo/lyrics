Do I have the right to be upset with you?
There are no standards that you need to meet up to.
This disappointment makes its way to me
I'll just accept it as if it was meant to be

I don't want to play this game
Your feelings have changed, mine stayed the same
I'm telling myself what i wanna hear
The truth is my greatest fear

In my mind you become more than a friend
If that's not the case just let me pretend
Being honest is such a simple task

Tell me how you feel
That's all I ask

I don't want to play this game
Your feelings have changed, mine stayed the same
I'm telling myself what I wanna hear
The truth is my greatest fear

I don't want to play your game
Your feelings changed, mine stayed the same
I'm telling myself what I wanna hear
The truth is my greatest fear

You called me today
What did you want me to say
After all I told myself
There's nothing you can say to help
