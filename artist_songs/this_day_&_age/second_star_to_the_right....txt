I'll take the window seat; it's just that I'm intrigued by this view from thousands of feet, and a love that carries us regardless of defeat. As we
ascend, I can't help but feel a little more at peace... I have found that I need to slow down and catch my breath, because I'm a work in progress...
Closer to the stars is where we ought to be, and I'll never arrive if you're not there with me... Don't give up on me, your love is like the sea (it's
surrounding me)... If I close one eye, take in the truth, block out the lies; will this loneliness finally die? When I fail again, please give me one last
try. Your grace is as endless as the sky... I won't look back.
