Aren't we so good at holding on to the past?
If we weren't speeding, I'm sure we wouldn't have crashed.
Under the influence of our shallow lust;
I know we should be careful but that won't happen to us.

Love is a second, third, fourth and fifth shot.
God knows I need it; God knows you haven't forgot.
It's easier to look down than to look straight in the eye.
I'll only say this once because I know it's going to make you cry.

Oh and you are too much like a drug to me.
No longer what I want, just what I think I need.
Why would I leave when I could waste away with you?
Less concerned with what I'll find than what I could lose.

But you say "Can't you give us one more try?
We're in a knot that I can't let you untie"

It's easier to look down than to look you straight in the eye.
I'll only say this once because I know it's going to make you cry.
There is a reason I feel lost when I'm not with you.
It's not because of love; it's just that you are what I've gotten used to.

If we don't leave now, we never will  (say goodbye).
Turn your back one last time on me.
