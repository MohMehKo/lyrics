How I love your brown eyes!
Love the way you make me feel inside!
Got me on this amazing high!

Oh, were you sent from up above?
The one,
I sit here, mixed up or next to I'm thinking of,
I'm scared, 'cuz this is love.
This is love.

This girl she exists,
cuz I think I found her.
This girl I can't resist.
And I can't live without her.
Without her.

How I love your blond hair!
Love the way you tell me you care!
Don't believe you, still meet you there.
I'll meet you there, yeah!

I'll hate it when I'm not with you,
gotta know what I'm singing is true!
Please don't leave!
What will I do?

This girl she exists,
'cuz I think I found her.
This girl can't resist,
and I can't live without her.
Without her.
