She has a fear of heights, the way you feel when you're leaving on your first flight. She's like a sinking stone, fading from the surface, but we are
never alone. She's on a tightrope, losing balance, yet something's pulling her towards hope. I want to run to her, but I've already played that card, so I
will fight the urge. Eyes closed, fingers crossed; praying that she's lost... You'll never know what's around the bend. "Avoid the unknown" is ringing in
your head... She has a fear of love, accepting everything but what she really dreamed of. She keeps her heart locked; no she won't ever answer even though
she hears a knock. But love is at the door, and after all isn't that what we are here for? I want to rescue her, but I've already tried, for there is only
one cure. (She has a fear of heights, the way you feel when you're leaving on your first flight)... While you rest inside your regret, the sun rises and
sets again... You're in your way, that's why you'll always be the same.
