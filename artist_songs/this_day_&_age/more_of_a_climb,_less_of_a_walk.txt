Casually I walk under the sunless sky, yet so naively. She was the first one to catch my eye, and I was hers. All at once I fell for you, you fell for
me, we fell too soon... More of a climb and less of a walk, and we are fading. Once jealousy begins I swear it will not stop; am I still yours? This will
be the death of us, if I can't learn to trust... This isn't over it never was; are you the type to settle or move one just because it's easier for you? Or
are you feeling like you need to get away from looks you never got and words I did not say? I'd say them all today, if I could... The more words I speak
the less they mean, so I'll keep quiet. Love was a promise that we could not keep, but I still care. All I know is I was wrong; now I'm here, you're
gone... We held fast, and we held strong, but that only lasts for so long... Just an echo of who I used to be. Just an echo of when you knew me. Change is
now my closest friend; selfishness at its end.
