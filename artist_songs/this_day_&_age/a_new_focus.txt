pacing back and forth in a space with barely enough room to think i'm trying to get past myself i don't know who i am

[chorus]
in this room without a view (don't turn on me now don't turn on me) all i can see is you. open your window for me this is
my only hope that i may walk through the darkness and find my way home

looking towards the sky and i know before i pushed your love away but i can see your outstreched arms i just found who i
am

[chorus]

open your window for me this is my only hope that i may walk through the darkness and find my way home (and we'll scream)
