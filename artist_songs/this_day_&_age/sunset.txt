It feels so good to be on the inside,
Looking down on those that don't belong.
I'm looking forward to someday when I can sing
all my favorite songs.

The purpose of today is to prepare for tomorrow.

The steep slope gives no hope to those standing just outside the door.
They desire to be a part of this,
We turn aways, they ask for more. 

I can't believe they can show their faces
after leaving with such disgrace.
I know exactly where I need to be.
And I smile, 'cuz that's where I am,
you and me.

The purpose of today is to prepare for tomorrow.

The steep slope gives no hope to those standing just outside the door.
They desire to be a part of this,
We turn aways, they ask for more.
