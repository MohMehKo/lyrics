the south seems right, cuz the nights are cold here
just like her heart as she says goodnight dear
your fate is his with where he wants to live
so say goodbye to mom and dad tonight

[chorus]
you'll run, you'll hide, you'll say goodbye to everything but you won't cry to prove that this is right for you her bags
are full her dreams are too
you're real but fake you cannot wait the time is now cuz this is fate for him to choose your path is wrong the end is
near the summers gone

you're the star and its the scene where you let down everyone who cares shes not prepare to leave this life at home cuz
why would she want something of her own

[chorus x2]
