I heard you say "Hey, that's the wrong way," but I didn't care. You can go your own way; I'll find my way there. Never been so tired, never been so lost.
With everything I've gained, it wasn't worth the cost... I strive to be in control; the hardest thing for me is to let go... Yes it's true that I'm the
one who needs you. My pride tells lies, saying "You will pull through." Sometimes I'm up, but I'm mostly down, just like a leaf in the wind. I know the
place where I need to end, but where do I begin?... What is that I see? Am I exiting this dark place? Is it light I see? I've reached the end of this
cave... Only you can save me.
