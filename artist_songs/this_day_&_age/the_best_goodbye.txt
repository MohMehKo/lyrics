Just one more drink,
I'll deal with this tomorrow.
Just thinking about this
only hurts.

I'll raise my glass
to whatever he said.
'Cuz any reason is good enough for one more.

I was wrong
about the things I said to you.
I was wrong,
ignoring what you said I should do.
But now I can see the other side.
Being open with
the things I used to hide.

And me, I know
what we're going through
no one else understands.
I never used to feel like this.
Things never used to look like this.
There's more than one
person I miss.
I think I could use one more.

With every passing minute
is another chance to start all over again.
I'm starting
to realize
that who I am
is the product
of who surrounds me.

I was wrong
about the things I said to you.
I was wrong,
ignoring what you said I should do.
But now I can see the other side.
Being open with
the things I used to hide.

I was wrong
about the things I said to you.
I was wrong,
ignoring what you said I should do.
This is the best goodbye.
