We spent our time, staring at clocks and crossing lines. I always though you were on my side. All you could see were the unattractive parts of me. You
wanted out, wanted to be free. And then came the distance; it's as if two years were like an instant. Suddenly I wasn't worth the wait... I don't think I
can take much more of this, but I can't let it end. Because who would I be without the one who taught me how to pretend?... Which way to go? We lost our
map sometime ago; you walk above, and I'll walk below. I've done my share, and we both know that I've done my best in killing you with kindness... Aren't
we walking contradictions? Having love, but calling it fiction... I need to be on my own (at least for now). You need to be on your own. But all these
thoughts I keep inside; because don't we love wasting our time.
