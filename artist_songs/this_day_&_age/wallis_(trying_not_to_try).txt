A one way ticket is on his mind
In hopes he'll find
What he's looking for

I lost the words
He's screaming to no one
The one who's been there through all of this
But now he's gone
Where do I go from here
Where do I go
And how will I learn to overcome this fear
Of not knowing who to turn to
Or how to persist through

He steps into a world he's never seen
Where broken hearts are given brand new starts

I lost the words
He's screaming to no one
The one who's been there through all of this
But now he's gone
Where do I go from here
Where do I go
And how will I learn to overcome this fear
Of not knowing who to turn to
Or how to persist through

As he sat there
With the smoke in the air
I felt a peace that no one else could see
