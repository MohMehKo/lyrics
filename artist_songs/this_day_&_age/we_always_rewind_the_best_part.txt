if you go i'll wait for you, if you go i'll wait for you

[chorus]
you wouldn't drive without a key you can't live if you don't bleed you try to run but theres no peace without me you
wouldn't drive without a key and i miss you since you left me you try to run without me

if you go i'll wait for you, if you go i'll wait for you i know that you will wish i was there some day, some day, some
way wishing i knew your every care some day, some day, some way

[chorus]

paint the wall your favorite shade of blue i hope all your dreams come true and i will be renew and i won't waste your
time anymore finally put a lock on our closed door and you will not break through and we'll try to put smiles on our face
and see who is the quickest to replace our lost and broken love
