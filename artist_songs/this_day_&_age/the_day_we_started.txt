This is love my dear
But some things aren't so clear
Like when you close your eyes
Do you dream of better, of better times
We're touching the pen to the paper and drawing new lines

[Chorus]
(I know that)
I found truth in you
I knew the day we started love dies too
Missing you since the day we parted

Nothing stays the same
With every lost you'll find again
I'm searching for a new hope
Love comes quick but it fades slow
We're writing the words to the song we started years ago

[Chorus]

Leaves die with seasons?
Love fades away without reason
Leaves die with seasons?
Love fades away without reason

[Chorus x2]
