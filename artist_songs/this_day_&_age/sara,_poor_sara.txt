Sara, lay your head down, it's been a long day you need some rest. This life that you've been leading won't allow for anything but your second best...
It's effortless, or is it meaningless?... Sara, close your eyes now, and dream about those things you'll never have. Don't open them too quickly; you
might realize life's not all that bad... Wake up; I can see you're sleeping still, if you don't leave now you never will. Two roads; this is up to you...
Sara, have another drink, you don't love yourself, you might as well let someone else. And as long as you wear long sleeves, they will never know what you
really need is help... Only one door leads you out.
