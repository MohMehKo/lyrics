you were wrong about yesterday you never think before you speak last year thinking you could be made for me she said some
races can't be won and so we fade with the setting of the sun

[chorus]
and airplanes they always leave the ground with confidence and safely coming down unlike us we crashed and can't be found
in the movies on the big screen i'll make you mine if this was highschool or just homecoming we'll dance all night

don't let that smile fade i wouldn't want to see you hurt like i am keep the promises we made i know that this will come
and go but she runs further, further than she knows

[chorus]

could i have shown more teeth when i smilestood up straight when you called my name kissed you with my eyes closed i'm
lost i'll find my way

in the movies on the big screen i'll make you mine
if this was highschool or just homecoming we'll dance all night in the movies on the big screen
this isn't highschool or homecoming lets say goodnight
