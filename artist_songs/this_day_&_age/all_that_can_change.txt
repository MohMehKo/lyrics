It simply makes no sense to me
This lie you've come to believe
Why have you changed
This year has brought a change in you
That is sadly shining through
Why have you changed

What makes us turn to this
Is it something I have missed
I just can't lose another friend
Can we put this to an end

You've only got yourself to blame
For these reasons you're not same
Why have you changed
Something you're going through now
Can I help you somehow
Why have you changed

What makes us turn to this
Is it something I have missed
I just can't lose another friend
Can we put this to an end

Now you're on your own
Home alone
I'll leave you alone
Now you're on your own
Home alone
I'll leave you alone

What makes us turn to this
Is it something I have missed
Oh, I just can't lose another friend
Please don't put me through this again, again
