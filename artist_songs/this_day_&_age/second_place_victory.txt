It's breathtaking to think of you
And to learn that sometimes the only way out is through
It's mindnumbing to think of yesterday,
I'd run to you now if I could but things have changed

[Chorus:]
(I heard you say) it's enlightening
To think of the breeze
To believe in things that we can't see

(so here we go) let's show them how to live
Accept the pain
Always forgive
Watch the sun go down
Learn the sound of following all that is complete

It's breathtaking to think of you
And to learn without faith the sky isn't as blue.
It's mindnumbing to think of yesterday
We'll look toward the stars and dream that we're airplanes

[Chorus x2]

Let's show them how to live
Accept the pain.
Always forgive
Watch the sun go down
Learn the sound of following.
All that's complete.
