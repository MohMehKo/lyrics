i still don't want to play your game you said the thrill has been lost and can't be regain you said you rather watch the
rain than think of me cuz it makes you feel so free

[chorus]
we'll walk past the memories i will wave as you turn away if i was talking to you and not writing this maybe i can show
you something you haven't seen my lips would fight my mind i say things at the right time

i'll still wait for you if thats what it took we could run into the future without a second look you said you rather
change the wind than think of me cuz you need room to breathe

[chorus]

[x2]
if i was talking to you and not writing this maybe i can show you something you haven't seen my lips would fight my mind
i say things at the right time
