give me your hand i'll show you where we stand
cuz you're always asking when we'll reach the promise land and listen girl i don't make promises to anyone just always
know your wish is my command

[chorus]
so cut the rope lets give them another chance
they're not the first ones to fake romance
can't you see apologies bleed from their eyes
but trust is all we need

lets go inside i found the perfect place to hide
someday will never come if we simply say our goodbyes listen boy i can't live like this another day no ones real, no one
feels, no one stays

[chorus]

and all we need is time tonight we'll touch the sky

[chorus]
