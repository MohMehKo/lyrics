lets make this a night to remember lets forget all the times we spent together lets run with our eyes closed cuz i
suppose some dreams are meant to be broken lets run away cuz i don't know how to say this anyway

[chorus]
cuz we don't believe in anything we believe in yesterday she remembers all the pain and heartache cuz we don't believe in
anything we believe in yesterday she remembers all the pain and heartache

lets make this a night to remember lets close down all the roads we drove on together lets hop on the next train because
we can't regain whats been lost in these lives in this small town lock the door cuz i don't need to be in this place
anymore

[chorus x4]
