She had dumps like a truck truck truck
Thighs like a what what what
All night long (all night long)
Let me see that thong
I like it when the beat goes da nam da nam
Baby make your booty go da nam da nam (baby)
Girl I know you wanna show
That thong th... thong thong thong

[2x]
Shake shake shake
Shake shake shake
Shake your booty
Shake your booty

Shawty had them apple-bottom jeans
Boots with the fur (with the fur)
The whole club was looking at her
She hit the floor (she hit the floor)
Next thing you know
Shawty got low low low low
Low low low low

TJ, can you handle this?
David, can you handle this?
Clay, can you handle this?
I don't think they can handle this
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this
Cause my body's too bootylicious for ya babe
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
(For this jelly)
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
(My bootay)
I don't think you're ready for this
Cause my body's too bootylicious for ya babe

I like big butts and I can not lie (no lie)
You other brothers can't deny (I won't)
When a girl walks in with an itty-bitty waist
And a round thing in your face
You get sprung
Wanna pull out tough...
Not what matters you know what does?
Courtship and chivalry
I'll take you to a nice hot meal
And I'll tip the waiter...

I went sky-diving
I went rocky mountain climbing
I went two point seven seconds on a bull named Fu Man Chu (yeehaw)
And I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And...

I dug my key into the side (to the side) of his pretty little souped up 4 wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all 4 tyres
Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats

Making my way downtown
Walking fast
Faces pass and I'm homebound

We are never ever ever
Getting back together
We are never ever ever
Getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (talk to me)
But we are never ever ever ever
Getting back together

What's love got to do, got to do with it
What's love, but a second hand emotion
What's love got to do, got to do with it
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken

This is how we do it
I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because
(This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does
(This is how we do it)
To all my neighbours, you've got much flavour
(This is how we do it)

Girls should know you better watch out
Some guys, some guys are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing-

That girl is poison
Never trust a big butt and smile
That girl is poison

Here we go yo
Here we go yo
So what so what so, what's the scenario
Here we go yo
Here we go yo
So what so what so, what's the scenario
Here we go

Insane in the membrane
Insane in the brain
Insane in the membrane
Insane in the brain

I got all I need when I got you and I
Cause I look around me and see a sweet life
I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight
You're getting me, getting me through the night
