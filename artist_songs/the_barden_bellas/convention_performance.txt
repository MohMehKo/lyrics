You got me so wild
How can I ever deny
You got me so high
So high I cannot feel the fire
And you keep telling me
Telling me that you'll be sweet
And you'll never want to leave my side
As long as I don't break these
Promises, and they still feel all so wasted on myself

I’m your dream girl
This is real love
But you know what they say about me
That girl is a problem
Girl is a problem
Girl is a problem problem
(And they still feel all so wasted on myself)

Sweat
Dripping down your chest
Thinking ‘bout your tattooed knuckles
On my thigh boy boy boy
Cold
Shower you got no
Power to control
How I make you my toy toy toy
My hips rocking
As we keep lip locking
Got the neighbors screaming
Even louder louder
Lick me down like you were
Rolling rizla
I’m smoking
Come and put me out
(So wasted on myself)

I’m your dream girl
This is real love
But you know what they say about me
That girl is a problem
Girl is a problem
Girl is a problem problem
Oh baby
You so bad boy
Drive me mad boy
But you don’t care when they say about me
That girl is a problem
Girl is a problem
Girl is a problem problem
(And they still feel all so wasted on myself)
