He was a famous trumpet man from out Chicago way.
He had a boogie style that no one else could play.
He was the top man at his craft,
But then his number came up and he was gone with the draft.
He's in the army now. He's blowin' reveille.
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B.

Oh, you can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
She said, love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take

Now break!

Hey sister, go sister, soul sister, flow sister

Giuchie, Giuchie, ya ya dada (Hey hey hey)
Giuchie, Giuchie, ya ya here
Mocha Chocalata ya ya
Creole lady Marmalade

And now it's time for a breakdown

Never gonna get it...
Ohhhh...
Never gonna get it..
