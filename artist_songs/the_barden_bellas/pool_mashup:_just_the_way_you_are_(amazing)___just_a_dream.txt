Oh, her eyes, her eyes make the stars look like they're not shining. 
Her hair, her hair falls perfectly without her tryin. 
She's so beautiful. And I tell her everyday. 

Uh, Uh, I was thinkin' bout her, thinkin' bout me, thinkin' bout us, who we gonna be 
(I know, I know, when I compliment her she won't believe me.) 
Opened my eyes, and it was only just a dream. 
(It's so, it's so, sad to think that she can't see what I see.) 
(But every time she asks me "do I look okay, you know I'll say)
It was only just a dream. 

When I see your face, 
(So I traveled back down that road will she come back, no one knows.) 
There's not a thing that I would change. Cause you're amazing, just the way you are. 
(I realized, it was only just a dream. it was only just a dream)
