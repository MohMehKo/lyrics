They say you're a freak when we're having fun
Say you must be high when we're spreading love
But we're just living life and we never stop
We got the world
We got the wo-wo-wo-wo-wo...

It's going down, I'm yelling timber
You better move, you better dance
Let's make a night you won't remember
I'll be the one you won't forget
(Wooooah)

The bigger they are, the harder they fall
These big-iddy boys are dig-gidy dogs
I have 'em like Miley Cyrus, clothes off
Twerking in their bras and thongs, timber!
Face down, booty up, timber!
That's the way we like to–what?–timber!
I'm slicker than an oil spill
She say she won't, but I bet she will

They say you're a freak
We got the world
(I got-got-got-got)
Yeah we never stop
We got the world
(I got-got-got-got)
You're a freak
(Timber)
(I got-got-got-got)
Yeah we never stop
World
From sea to shining sea

I came in like a wrecking ball (wrecking ball)
I never hit so hard in love (hard in love)
All I wanted was to break your walls (break your walls)
All you ever did was wreck me (wreck me)
(End of the night, it's going down)

I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
(End of the night, it's going down)
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
(I'm yelling Timber)
All you ever did was wreck me
(End of the night, it's going down)
(They say you're a freak)
Yeah, you wreck me
