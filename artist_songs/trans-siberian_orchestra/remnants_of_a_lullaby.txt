[Mrs. Cozier]

There was a time
Now far away
That now belongs
To yesterday

But late at night
If you believe
There are still parts
You can retrieve

Beyond our memories
Past where the eyes can see

Well disguised
Waiting there
Dream devised

Safe from time's
Endless reach
Everything
A child can teach

What to keep
What to save
When to dare
An ocean's wave

There among life's memories
Remnants of a lullaby and thee

There was a time
Now long before
We found a way
To close each door

But in our minds
Through labyrinths deep
Late in our lives
Those doors we seek

And in our fantasies
We try to, find the keys

Reach the stairs
Follow them
Each to where

Scattered there
On the ground
Everything
Lost is found

Wished on coins
Childhood wings
Carousels
Still turning

Waiting there patiently
Remnants of a lullaby
And thee
