[THERESA] 

TIME 
ONLY TIME 
COULD NEVER TAKE ME AWAY FROM YOU 

AND WHY 
SHOULD IT TRY 
TIME NEVER CARES JUST WHAT WE DO 

IT JUST SITS ON A STAR 
AND GAZES DOWN 
DROPPING ITS MOMENTS ALL AROUND 
AND IF I COULD WISH UPON THAT STAR 
I WOULD FIND WHAT YOU DREAM 
AND THEN ASK GOD TO GRANT IT 

I WANTED 
TO SAY THIS 
LONG BEFORE THIS DARK WOULD FALL 
AT NIGHT I 
WOULD PRAY THIS 
THEN WONDER IF GOD HEARD AT ALL 
FOR THE CHANCES I'VE HAD ARE NOW LONG GONE 
AND THAT STAR IS NO LONGER WISHED UPON 
FOR ON THIS NIGHT IT SEEMS TOO FAR AWAY 

TRY 
I HAVE TRIED 
TO PRETEND THAT I DON'T CARE 
BUT THEN 
SLEEP ARRIVES 
AND IN EVERY DREAM I FIND YOU THERE 

BUT I DON'T WANT THE PAST TO BE MY LIFE 
AND I DON'T WANT TO LIVE INSIDE THE NIGHT 
BUT I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOUR SHADOW FADE 
SO I SLEEP AND I DREAM 
THOUGH I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT 

I WANTED 
TO SAY THIS 
LONG BEFORE THIS DARK WOULD FALL 
AT NIGHT I 
WOULD PRAY THIS 
THEN WONDER IF GOD HEARD AT ALL 
FOR THE CHANCES I'VE HAD ARE NOW LONG GONE 
AND THAT STAR IS NO LONGER WISHED UPON 
FOR ON THIS NIGHT IT SEEMS TOO FAR AWAY 

YOU CAN LIVE YOUR LIFE IN A THOUSAND WAYS 
BUT IT ALL COMES DOWN TO THAT SINGLE DAY 
WHEN YOU REALIZE WHAT YOU REGRET 
WHAT YOU CAN'T RECLAIM BUT YOU CAN'T FORGET 
IF I COULD JUST FALL BACK INTO MY LIFE 
AND FIND YOU THERE INSIDE THIS NIGHT 
AND LET ETERNITY JUST DRIFT AWAY 

[Beethoven realizes that Theresa never would have cared about his deafness and is crushed as he realizes what might have been. To ease the pain of his regret, Fate then shows him glimpses of the future and the countless musicians who will be inspired by, and build upon the legacy of his music. She then allows him a final vision; a vision in which he improvises with musicians from the past by whom he was inspired , as well as musicians from the future, who will be inspired by him.]
