[MEPHISTOPHELES] 

ALL OF YOUR LIFE NOW 
YOU HAVE DENIED 
THERE'D BE A TIME 
WHEN YOU'D EVER DIE 
STILL IT'S BEEN RUMORED THIS THING MUST BE 

WHY IS IT THEN THAT YOU ACT SURPRISED 
WHEN I APPEAR NOW TO BE YOUR GUIDE 
WHY DO YOU HESITATE TO FOLLOW ME 

SEE IT RISING 
STARE AND WONDER 
HEAR IT BECKON 
YOU TO DANCE 

FEEL IT HOLD YOU 
TAKE YOU UNDER 
I'M YOUR GOD OF SECOND CHANCE 

AND NOW YOU CLAIM YOU ARE NOT PREPARED 
SO MUCH TO DO YOU CAN NOT BE SPARED 
STILL YOUR ENTREATIES DEATH WILL NOT HEAR 

THE GRAVEYARD IS FILLED WITH IMPORTANT MEN 
WHO COULD NOT BE SPARED BUT WERE IN THE END 
AND SO I WHISPER NOW IN YOUR EAR 

SEE IT RISING 
STARE AND WONDER 
HEAR IT BECKON 
YOU TO DANCE 

FEEL IT HOLD YOU 
TAKE YOU UNDER 
I'M YOUR GOD OF SECOND CHANCE 

DOMINE 
DOMINE

DOMINE 
O DOMINE 
O DOMINE 
O DOMINE

[The Devil then makes the composer an offer. If Beethoven will give him all his music, allowing Mephistopheles to wipe it from the memory of man, he will return his soul to him. Beethoven is overwhelmed by the situation. Fearing an eternity of damnation and torment he is desperate to reclaim his soul, but the thought of losing his music, his life's work, causes him to hesitate.] 

[Mephistopheles, sensing his confusion, offers to leave for one hour before returning for Beethoven's answer. As the devil is turning to go, Beethoven notices that the hands of the clock are now turning faster than is normal. When he points this out to Mephistopheles, the devil replies that the maestro should consider it a final favor because where Beethoven is going, they never turn at all.] 

[As the spirits cautiously re-emerge from the corners of the room, Beethoven agonizes over his decision.]
