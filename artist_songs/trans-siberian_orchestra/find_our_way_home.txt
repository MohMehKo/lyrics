He believed in the things 
That he always thought he knew 
And had done all the things 
That he always wanted to do 
Collecting 
Each thing reflecting his worth 
But now he pondered 
How he had wandered this earth 

For we all seem to give our lives away 
Searching for things that we think we must own 
Until on this evening 
When the year is leaving 
We all try to find our way home 

He had time or at least then he 
Always thought he did 
And mistakes, well, he thought that time 

Always would forgive 
Each transgression 
For his intention 
Forgetting 
Years he squandered 
On things he now was regretting 

For we all seem to give our lives away 
Searching for things that we think we must own 
Until on this evening 
When the year is leaving 
We all try to find our way home 

For we all seem to give our lives away 
Searching for things that we think we must own 
But on this evening 
When the year is leaving 
I think I would be alright 
If on this Christmas night 
I could just find my way home 

THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT THIS NIGHT 
THAT THE LORD HAS ARRANGED 
THAT REACHES DEEP INTO OUR SOULS 
AND CAUSES US TO WANT TO CHANGE 

AND ANGELS KNOW THINGS ABOUT US 
THAT NO ELSE CAN KNOW 
AND THIS ANGEL'S HEART IT FORMED A PLAN 
AND THEN CAUSED THE NIGHT TO SNOW
