IN AN OLD CITY BAR 
THAT IS NEVER TOO FAR 
FROM THE PLACES THAT GATHER 
THE DREAMS THAT HAVE BEEN 

IN THE SAFETY OF NIGHT 
WITH IT'S OLD NEON LIGHT 
IT BECKONS TO STRANGERS 
AND THEY ALWAYS COME IN 

AND THE SNOW IT WAS FALLING 
THE NEON WAS CALLING 
THE MUSIC WAS LOW 
AND THE NIGHT CHRISTMAS EVE 

AND HERE WAS THE DANGER 
THAT EVEN WITH STRANGERS 
INSIDE OF THIS NIGHT 
IT WAS EASIER TO BELIEVE 

FOR IT WAS INTO THIS BAR 
THAT I HAPPENED TO WANDER 
TO STARE INTO A GLASS 
AND MY UNIVERSE PONDER 

SO I WALKED UP TO THE COUNTER 
SHOOK THE SNOW OFF MY COAT 
THEN I ORDERED A WHISKEY 
THAT I USED LIKE A MOAT 

BUT AN OLD MAN SOON JOINED ME 
AND ASKED IF I KNEW THE TIME 
ONE WORD LED TO ANOTHER 
AND SOMEHOW I DIDN'T MIND 

THEN HE OFFERED A DRINK 
FROM A BOTTLE 'NEATH HIS COAT 
AND HE SMILED A LITTLE SMILE 
AS IT TRICKLED DOWN MY THROAT 

AND I FELT MYSELF RELAXING 
HERE AMONG THE GHOSTS THAT FAILED 
THEN THE OLD MAN TOPPED MY GLASS OFF 
AND BEGAN THIS LITTLE TALE 

IN THE MOMENTS OF OUR LIVES 
BOTH THE JOYOUS AND THE TRAGIC 
IF THE TRUTH IS TO BE TOLD 
WE ARE ALL PURSUING MAGIC 

AND THE MAGIC THAT WE SEEK 
AS WE'RE SURE YOU HAVE DISCOVERED 
CAN BE FOUND IN CERTAIN PLACES 
FAR MORE EASILY THAN OTHERS 

IN THE SAND BENEATH THE SPHINX 
IN THE DREAMS OF CANDLELIGHT 
BUT THE SUREST PLACE OF ALL 
IS IN THE FORGIVING WORLD OF NIGHT 

AND OF ALL THE NIGHTS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR 
THAT COME AND GENTLY LEAVE 
NONE HOLD THE DREAM OF MAGIC 
LIKE THE EVENING, CHRISTMAS EVE 

AND SO IT'S ON THIS NIGHT 
WITH IT'S PROMISE DEEP WITHIN 
AS THE SNOW NOW STARTS TO FALL 
OUR STORY DOES BEGIN 

An angel came down 
One night to the earth 
A mission from God 
To find out the worth 

Of everything that 
His children had done 
Since that winter night 
The birth of His son 

And then a sound filled the night 
In the cold winter air 
And in the midst of his flight 
It was holding him there 
And as he looked toward the earth 
For the source of this sound 
On that cold winter night 
It was pulling him down 

To bring something back 
This angel was told 
That no one could touch 
But angels could hold 

So on that night 
When the sky had cleared 
Among all the stars 
An angel appeared 

And then a sound filled the night 
In the cold winter air 
And in the midst of his flight 
It was holding him there 
And as he looked towards the earth 
For the source of this sound 
On that cold winter night 
It was pulling him down 

And then a sound filled the night 
In the cold winter air 
And in the midst of his flight 
It was holding him there 
And as he looked towards the earth 
For the source of this sound 
On that cold winter night 
It was pulling him down
