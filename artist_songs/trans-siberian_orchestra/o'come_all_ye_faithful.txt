[NARRATION]

Looking at his son across the room 
He feared to cross that divide 
But how long could he stay in this dark 
That allows us all to hide 

Is there a wrong so great in life 
That it undoes every good we've ever done 
Is there an act so good it would undo all our wrongs 
Every single one? 

And in putting his whole 
Life into this gesture 
Would failing make it 
Any lesser? 

Then through the window he thought he saw 
In the falling snow so near 
The outline of his son's mother's face 
But then it disappeared 

It was only there for a second 
And a second's not long, but yet 
It was enough to cause that man 
To take that very first step 

And that step was followed by another 
In that room still lit so dim 
And before he realized how far he had gone 
His son was directly in front of him 

Then the father noticed on the windowsill 
An old photo that he long ago had seen 
It was a picture of him and his wife 
When they were both about nineteen 

It was leaning against a folder 
That said "property of the deceased" 
And underneath was his wife's name 
And the date it had been released 

It was obviously her personal possessions 
That had been given to his son 
Because since he had left them all behind 
The child was the only one 

His son must have always kept it with him 
For the folder was weathered and torn 
And he must have gazed at that picture countless times 
For it was also all tattered and worn 

Then his son noticed him standing there 
And from his task looked up 
And then looked at the picture beside him 
And that one look, was enough 

He recognized it was his father 
That was now standing there 
And gave him a smile of pure love and forgiveness 
And of the past, he did not care 

He did not care where he had been 
The whys, the wheres, the hows 
He only cared that his father was there 
Standing by him now 

Then the father turned and walked across the room 
Which by now had lost its distance 
And went to the nearest incubator 
And picked up a trembling infant 

And with the child within his arms 
He returned to his son 
And all the pain within his soul 
At that moment was undone 

And he sat in the rocking chair beside him 
With the life he had retrieved 
And side-by-side together 
They rocked all through that christmas eve
