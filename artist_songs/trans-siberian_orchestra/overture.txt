[On a late night in the spring of 1827 the city of Vienna is experiencing the largest lightning storm in its long history. Within a large disheveled room, Ludwig Von Beethoven is slumped over his piano and on the piano sits the just completed manuscript for his Tenth Symphony. It is his final, and he is certain, his greatest work.] 

SINCE THE TIME WHEN RA AND ISIS 
RAISED THE SPHINX OUT OF THE SAND 
AND APOLLO DREAMED ATHENA 
AND MEN BEGAN TO UNDERSTAND 

THAT WHEN DARKNESS FOLDS ON DARKNESS 
IN THE RESTLESS TIDES OF NIGHT 
AND LIGHTNING RAISES SHADOWS 
AND FOR MOMENTS GIVES THEM LIFE 

IT'S BEEN SAID BY THOSE WHO PONDER 
THAT IT SURELY IS A SIGN 
THAT A LIFE TOUCHED BY THE STARS 
IS NOW RUNNING OUT OF TIME 

AND THAT SOMEWHERE IN THAT DARKNESS 
IN THE HEART OF THAT GREAT STORM 
THE WORLD RETURNS A SOUL 
THAT THE GODS CAUSED TO BE BORN 

AND THIS WAS SUCH A STORM 
THE KIND ONE RARELY SEES IN LIFE 
FOR IN A ROOM NOW FILLED WITH SHADOWS 
THE GREAT BEETHOVEN WAS SPENDING 
HIS LAST NIGHT 

[From the shadows a beautiful spirit, Fate, and her deformed dwarf son, Twist, emerge to inform Beethoven of what he has already deeply suspected, that this is to be his last night on earth. They are accompanied by numerous spirits and ghosts from his past.]
