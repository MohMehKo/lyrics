SOMEWHERE IN THE UNIVERSE 
BETWEEN THIS NIGHT AND GOD 
AN ANGEL SAT UPON A STAR 
WHILE THINKING VERY HARD 

TO RETURN ONCE MORE TO THE EARTH 
HE HAD BEEN ASSIGNED 
AND A SINGLE GIFT FOR ALL OF MAN 
HE WAS TO LEAVE BEHIND 

BUT THIS GIFT THAT HE WAS TO LEAVE 
COULD NOT BE TAKEN FROM THE HEAVENLY COURT 
AND HOW COULD HE LEAVE SOMETHING BEHIND 
IF NOTHING COULD BE BROUGHT 

NOW THIS WAS QUITE A PUZZLE 
AND HE KNEW NOT HOW TO START 
WHEN HE SUDDENLY FELT A PRAYER FROM A CHILD 
REACH DEEP INTO HIS HEART 

AND THOUGHT HIS TIME WAS LIMITED 
TO THIS ONE NIGHT OF THE YEAR 
HE COULD NOT IGNORE THIS CHILD'S REQUEST 
SO HE DECIDED HE WOULD START HERE 

FOR THOUGH THIS NIGHT WAS CHRISTMAS EVE 
AND DREAMS WERE ALL ABOUT 
SOMEWHERE DOWN BELOW ON EARTH 
HE HAD FELT THIS CHILD BEGIN TO DOUBT 

A CHILD WHO SHOULD HAVE BEEN ASLEEP 
INSTEAD WAS CLIMBING ATTIC STAIRS 
WITH HER SOLITARY CANDLE 
AND A SINGLE CHRISTMAS PRAYER 

NOW, WHEN ANGELS THEY ARE CALLED 
THEY RARELY JUST APPEAR 
BUT MORE OFTEN THAN NOT 
THEY GENTLY WHISPER IN ONE'S EAR 

AND WHEN THEY WHISPER TO A CHILD 
ON NIGHTS WHEN SNOW STILL GLISTENS 
THE CHANCES ARE MUCH STRONGER STILL 
THAT, THAT CHILD, WILL LISTEN 

SO IN THIS ROOM WHERE SHADOWS LIVE 
AND GHOSTS THAT FAILED LEARN TIME FORGIVES 
WELCOME FRIENDS, PLEASE STAY AWHILE 
OUR STORY STARTS WITH ONE SMALL CHILD 
WHO SPENDS THIS NIGHT IN AN ATTIC DARK 
WHERE DREAMS ARE STORED LIKE SLEEPING HEARTS 

NOW, IF YOU WONDER WHY THIS CHILD IS HERE 
WITH ALL ASLEEP AND CHRISTMAS NEAR 
SHE'S COME UP HERE TO LOOK FOR TRUTH 
IN THIS PLACE CLOSEST TO THE ROOF 

FOR SHE HAD HEARD FROM FRIENDS WHO FEEL 
THAT NOTHING ON THIS NIGHT IS REAL 
THAT NO ADULTS TRULY BELIEVE 
IN ALL THESE THINGS OF CHRISTMAS EVE 

THIS NIGHT THAT SEEMS TO CAST A SPELL 
IN THE SAME WORLD, JUST TINSELED WELL 
AND AS SHE LAY IN BED THAT NIGHT 
SHE WONDERED IF THEY MIGHT BE RIGHT 

AND SHE WONDERED THEN WHO SHE MIGHT ASK 
ABOUT THIS QUESTION THAT HAD BEEN CAST 
FOR ADULTS, SHE HAD BEEN TOLD, YOU SEE 
ARE PART OF THIS CONSPIRACY 

BUT IN HER MIND BECOMING CLEAR 
THE SHADOW OF A CHILD'S IDEA 

THERE WAS ONE WHOSE PRESENCE ALONE 
WOULD RECONFIRM WHAT SHE HAD KNOWN 

BUT THIS MAN, HE WAS SO RARELY SEEN 
FOR HE ONLY ARRIVED WHEN CHILDREN DREAMED 
BUT IF WHAT SHE HAD BELIEVED WAS RIGHT 
HE SHOULD APPEAR THIS VERY NIGHT 
SO ON THIS NIGHT WITH SO MUCH AT STAKE 
SHE'S DETERMINED THAT SHE WOULD STAY AWAKE 

BUT THEN A PROBLEM CAME TO MIND 
IT SEEMS THAT FATE HAD NOT BEEN KIND 
FOR THEIR CHIMNEY HAD BEEN CLOSED THAT YEAR 
SOME BRICKS MIGHT FALL, HER FATHER FEARED 

SO SHE HAD DEVISED ANOTHER PLAN 
TO HEAR WHEN ON THE ROOF HE LANDS 
SO WITH THE GHOSTS LEFT HERE BY FATE 
UPON THIS NIGHT SHE SITS AND WAITS 

NOW AS I'M SURE YOU ALL MUST KNOW 
WHEN ONE IS WAITING, TIME MOVES SLOW 
AND AS SHE WONDERED WHAT TO DO 
(HER OPTIONS SEEMING FAR TOO FEW) 

THE ANGEL CAUSED THAT CHILD TO LOOK 
BEHIND A YELLOWED PILE OF BOOKS 
AMONG THESE MEMORIES DISGUISED AS JUNK 
SHE NOTICED THERE A WELL WORN TRUNK 

IT WAS FILLED WITH TOYS AND ONE OLD WREATH 
AND SEVERAL LETTERS UNDERNEATH 
SOME ORNAMENTS, A HAND RUNG PHONE 
AND RECORDS WITH A GRAMOPHONE 

A MIX OF LONG FORGOTTEN WORDS 
WITH MELODIES NO LONGER HEARD 
ALL THREADS OF LONG FORGOTTEN LIVES 
BUT HERE SOMEHOW THEY HAD SURVIVED 

THESE LETTERS THAT HAD CAUGHT HER EYE 
NOW IN HER HANDS THEY SEEMED ALIVE 
AND AS EACH LETTER SHE UNSEALED 
A SMALL PIECE OF THE PAST WAS REVEALED 

FOR CHRISTMAS WEAVES A LIFE LONG SPELL 
AND MOST OF ALL REMEMBERS WELL 
AND AS THE CHILD EXPLORED THE PAST 
ONCE AGAIN THAT SPELL WAS CAST 

AND AS THE CHILD BEGAN TO READ 
UPON THIS NIGHT OF CHRISTMAS EVE 
THE ANGEL'S PLAN, AS YOU CAN TELL 
IT WAS ALREADY WORKING WELL 
SO AS THE GHOSTS GENTLY ARISE 
IN OUT FIRST SONG WE'LL SUMMARIZE 

In this room where shadows live 
And ghosts that failed learn time forgives 
Welcome, friends, please stay awhile 
Our story starts with one small child 

Who spends this night in attics dark 
Where dreams are stored like sleeping hearts 
And so it's here that they must wait 
Till someone wishes them awake 

For somewhere on this night of nights 
She's looking to believe 
Here among the ghosts on Christmas Eve 

And there near an old looking glass 
There was a trunk from Christmas past 
That she had somehow missed before 
But now decides she will explore 

'Twas filled with toys and one old wreath 
And several letters underneath 
So as the evening hours leave 
The child sat down and started to read 

For somewhere on this night of nights 
She's looking to believe 
Here among the ghosts on Christmas Eve 

On Christmas Eve 
On Christmas Eve
