[GHOSTS & SPIRITS] 

FAITH AND BELIEF 
AND RETREAT 
WHEN YOU'RE STANDING ALL ALONE 
WITH YOUR DREAMS IN THE DARK 

NEVER KNOWING WHAT IS REAL 
IN THE SHADOWS YOU MEET 
NEVER KNOWING WHAT IS TRUE 
IN THE ANSWERS YOU SEEK 
NEVER KNOWING IF 

FATE SHE HEARS ME 
FATE STAND NEAR ME 
FATE STATE CLEARLY 
WHETHER THERE WILL BE ANOTHER CARD 

RETRIEVE US 
TIME DECEIVES US 
FAITH SHE HEARS US 
BUT SHE DOESN'T LISTEN VERY HARD 

AS SHE DRIFTS THROUGH OUR LIVES 
TOSSING COINS INTO THE AIR 
WATCH THEM TWIST 
WATCH THEM FALL 
TURNING HOPE INTO DESPAIR 

WATCH THEM TWIST 
WATCH THEM FALL 
THEN SHE SUDDENLY REVIVES 
EVERY DREAM THAT WE'VE HAD 
AND WE FIND OURSELVES 
ALIVE 

BELIEVE ME 
FATE STANDS NEAR ME 
FATE STATE CLEARLY 
WHETHER THERE WILL BE ANOTHER CARD 

RECEIVE US 
TIME DECEIVES US 
THE ONLY MOMENT IN OUR LIVES 
THAT EVER REALLY MATTERED FATE 
IS NOW
