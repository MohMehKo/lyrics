All these days that lay before me
All these days that lay behind
Does time just go on forever
Whose decision
Whose design

Death life
Wrong right
Pray will you tell me
Who decides

Dark night
Days light
Pray will you tell me
Who divides

Every year contains its seasons
Summer, winter, spring and fall
Some pass faster than the others
Some forgotten some recalled

Long short
Owned bought
Gathering trinkets
From times tides

Rich thoughts
Lost sought
Still the clock turns
And can't be bribed

I know
I see
I hear
Do you understand

The cost
In years
In tears
The weight of the damned

That build
To lakes
Then wake
And flood cross the land

We watch
The waves
Carve out
Their pre-ordained plans

Each life
Each grave
And then
Fill each one with sand

Listen what I say
Time does not betray
Every moment cast
Guaranteed to pass

Every moment close
Soon to turn to ghost
Some to disappear
Others shadows clear

Shadows without light
Soon become just night
Leaving in our mind
What is left behind

Do you hear what I say
Every life's numbered days
Joined with hourglass sand
Feel it run through your hands

Still then no one knows now
The true why when and how
And when time's out of sand
Will they know who I...
Am
