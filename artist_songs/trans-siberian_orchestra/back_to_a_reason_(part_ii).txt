[NARRATION]

Now that young girl, outside the store 
Was trying to capture snow's magic 
But each flake melted at her touch 
Which her young mind found quite tragic 

And while chasing an elusive snowflake 
That was determined to reach the ground 
She bumped into the businessman passing by 
And nearly knocked him down 

And thinking she was in trouble 
The child quickly apologized 
But the man was not accepting it 
She could see it in his eyes 

She explained she had been looking in the toy shop 
That tomorrow would be christmas day 
But the man muttered words she could not understand 
So she searched for something else she could say 

"do you have any children?" the child asked the man 
"no," was his instant reply 
And though he said it in his firmest voice 
In his heart he knew he had lied 

The girl was getting on his nerves 
Which were already shot 
Something about her bothered him 
But he could not say quite what 

Then he noticed the time was approaching midnight 
What was she doing on the street? 
When he asked the girl this question 
The child seemed to retreat 

She said she was staying with her parents 
At the hotel, right next door 
They were there for just this one night 
In room twelve twenty-four 

Then he said, "you best get back there 
As quick as you can fly!" 
And he watched as she ran all the way 
Until she was safely back inside 

Then he took several steps 
In the direction towards his home 
But then he hesitated 
And took out his mobile phone 

And called up the institution 
Where he had left his son 
To find out if he was still there and alive 
Wondering if the past could be undone 

The operator who answered, searched the computer 
To see if the child had survived 
And she was sincerely happy to tell him 
"your son is no longer here, but he is still alive!" 

Then the lady who was very kind 
Said, "if you have a short while 
I can give you all the information 
That is here inside his file 

I see that at the age of twelve 
He had finally learned to walk 
And could understand most things people said 
But has never learned to talk 

He's living uptown in the bronx 
At a boarding house hotel" 
And then the lady gave him the phone number 
And hotel's address as well 

And for the first time in many years 
The man thought about his life 
And all the things he had left behind 
And, of course, he thought about his wife 

And he wondered if she had lived 
The things they might have done 
But really most of all right now 
He thought about his son 

[BACK TO A REASON (PART II)]

Time 
Standing all alone 
I bled for you 
I wanted to 
Each drop my own 

Slowly they depart 
But fall in vain 
Like desert rain 
And still they fall on and on and on 

Got to get back to a reason 
Got to get back to a reason i once knew 
And this late in the seasons 
One by one distractions fade from view 

So 
Drifting through the dark 
The sympathy 
Of night's mercy 
Inside my heart 
Is your life the same? 
Do ghosts cry tears? 
Do they feel years? 
As time just goes on and on and on 

Got to get back to a reason 
Got to get back to a reason i once knew 
And this late in the seasons 
One by one distractions fade from view 

I'm looking for you 
I'm looking for i don't know what 
I can't see there anymore 
And all my time's been taken 

Is this what it seems? 
The lure of a dream 
And i'm afraid to walk back through that door 
To find that i've awakened 

The night seems to care 
The dreams in the air 
The snow's coming down 
It beckons me dare 

It whispers, it hopes 
It holds and confides 
And offers a bridge 
Across these divides 

The parts of my life 
I've tried to forget 
It's gathered each piece 
And carefully kept 

Somewhere in the dark 
Beyond all the cold 
There is a child 
That's part of my soul 

Got to get back to a reason 
Got to get back to a reason i once knew 
And this late in the seasons 
One by one distractions fade from view 
The only reason i have left is 
You
