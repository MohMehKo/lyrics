[NARRATION]

Like the sphinx knows silence 
And the pyramids know time 
Like sisyphus knew regret 
As he thought about his crime 

As julius knew betrayal 
As judas knew the kiss 
And david with his nervous hand 
Knew when not to miss 

And helen in her blindness 
Knew better how to touch 
And lincoln in his wisdom 
Knew the angels in each of us 

Like the delphi knew tomorrow 
Like crocodiles know the nile 
Like michelangelo knew stone 
A mother knows her baby's smile 

Then she placed her hands upon his lips 
In something akin to a kiss 
And in her arms he stayed asleep 
As the night grew dark and the child dreamt deep 

[DIFFERENT WINGS]

Dream, child 
As childhood wants to do 

Dream all this night will allow 
Dream, child 
Dream with an angel's view 
Out there safe in your clouds 

Wait for me now 
I will be there for you 
No matter what 
Tomorrow may bring 
This i will vow 
I will be there 
For this child with different 

Dream, child 
Stars have been rumored to 
See dreams within newborn eyes 
And in their arms i believe they do 
Keep safe until you arise 

Wait for me now 
I will be there for you 
No matter what 
Tomorrow may bring 
This i will vow 
I will be there 
For this child with different wings 

[NARRATION]

And so it's here our story ends 
Exactly where it did start 
In that labyrinth of mystery 
We call the human heart 

For they say that without it 
No one can truly live 
And it also has been rumored 
That without it, we cannot forgive 

Merry Christmas!
