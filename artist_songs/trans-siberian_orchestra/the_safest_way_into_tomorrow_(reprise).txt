[Lieutenant William Cozier]

Sleep
Don't turn away
You are the safest way into tomorrow
Dreams
If you will stay
Or at least the best parts lets us borrow
Days are counted 'til they're gone
Nights are meant to carry on
Morpheus is at your side
Offering the wings to fly
And be there
Free from earth to sail across this night
Where
Stars are all eternal and the mind dares
The evening sighs
So close your eyes
And spend this night with me
