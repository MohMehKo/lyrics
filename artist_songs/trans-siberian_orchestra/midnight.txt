[TWIST] 

AND IN THE DARK HE SITS ALONE 
TO WATCH HIS FINAL HOURS BLEEDING 
WHILE UNCONCERNED UPON THE WALL 
THE CLOCK IT TICKS AWAY THE TIME 

NO NEED FOR WORDS FOR IN THE DARK 
ALL WORDS HAVE LONG SINCE LOST THEIR MEANING 
STILL WHEN THEY WHISPER IN HIS EAR 
HE TRIES TO READ BETWEEN THE LINES 

WHAT I SEE IN THE NIGHT 
WHAT I FEEL IN YOUR HEART 
ALL YOUR DREAMS ALL YOUR LIES 
CAN YOU TELL THEM APART 

SEE THE HANDS ON THE CLOCK 
ARE YOU WATCHING THEM TURN 
FOR YOUR CANDLE IS QUITE LOW 
WE'VE BEEN WATCHING IT BURN 

DO YOU LIE HERE AWAKE 
AS THE SHADOWS LOOK ON 
SHOULD THEY CRY FOR YOUR SAKE 
SHOULD YOU SLEEP IN THEIR ARMS 

FOR THE SHADOWS SEE ALL 
AND THEY RARELY FORGET 
EVERY DREAM THAT YOU'VE HAD 
EVERY ACT YOU REGRET
