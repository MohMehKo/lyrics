[NARRATION]

And so it was in front of this hotel 
Our angel did finally arrive 
And standing at one corner was a young man 
Who caught the angel's eye 

He had a small group of children 
Gathered round him there 
Who all were quietly listening 
Which for children is quite rare 

He was telling them christmas tales 
And each one brought more children near 
Where they nestled round him on those steps 
So each word they could clearly hear 

He then told them a christmas story 
About how all men are brothers 
And when that story had ended 
The children clamored for another 

"where does christmas go 
When its day is through? 
Where does christmas go," they asked, 
"and what does christmas do?" 

Now children have such simple requests 
Their wishes are so small 
That the young man saw no reason why 
He could not grant them all 

They liked his stories so much 
They begged him not to let it end 
So he told them about the wizards of winter 
Whose winter ball they must attend 

How these wizards decorated their whole world 
With icicles, frost and snow 
And how with the dreams of this night beneath it 
It all would magically start to glow 

And the snow seemed to obey the young man's every gesture 
In the cold december's air 
And as for the wizards' imperial ball 
Well, they were already there
