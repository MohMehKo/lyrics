Hey child
Out on your own
You never looked back
Never called home
You never turned 'round
Tell me the games that you played

Night time
Wander the street
You never give ground
Never retreat
You're always oz bound
Have all the dreams been betrayed

Stay
Here where the dreams tend to stray
Here you're safe

When the night
Fades away
When the night
Fades away

Hey there
Oz refugee
You took the wrong road
Hatters and tea
Are all that you found
Out on the great white way

Times change
You never did
Life came
You overbid
Join us
Vessels of courvoisier

Stay
Here where the dreams tend to stray
Here you're safe

When the night
Fades away
When the night
Fades away
