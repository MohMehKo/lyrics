Christmas time 
On a cold December morning 
All is calm 
And the world is still asleep 
Christmas lights 
That have been caught without warning 
Gently glitter on 
Stars to wish upon 
All the world is at peace 

Christmas time and the year will soon be leaving 
Cloaked in time till it's just a memory 
Christmas stays if we don't forget its meaning 
Days go quickly by 
Years they multiply 
And we go searching for thee 

And the dream is still alive 
From that first December morning 
And it always will survive 
As long as we can see 
That the dreams we find in life 
Are the dreams we tend to seek 
And Christmas has its promises to keep 

Christmas time 
And the moments just beginning 
From last night 
When we'd wished upon a star 

If our kindness 
This day is just pretending 
If we pretend long enough 
Never giving up 
It just might be who we are 

AND SO IT'S GOOD THAT WE REMEMBER 
JUST AS SOON AS WE'VE DISCOVERED 
THAT THE THINGS WE DO IN LIFE 
WILL ALWAYS END UP TOUCHING OTHERS 

SO FROM A FADING NEON STAR 
SOMEWHERE SHINING IN THE NIGHT 
WE FIND A FATHER FAR AWAY 
NOW REFLECTING IN ITS LIGHT
