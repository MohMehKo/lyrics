[BEETHOVEN] 

IN THIS WORLD OF CIRCUMSTANCE 
CHILDREN NEVER FEAR FOREVER 
AND THIS MOMENT THAT ENCHANTS 
SOMEDAY WE MAY BOTH REMEMBER 

THEN 
MAYBE THEN 
IF WE ARE STILL ALIVE 
THEN 
MAYBE THEN 
THIS MOMENT WILL SURVIVE 

THERE IS TIME IN EVERY WORD 
THERE ARE WORDS IN EVERY REASON 
AND THESE NOTES THAT ARE UNHEARD 
ONE DAY THEY MAY FIND THEIR SEASON 

THEN 
MAYBE THEN 
IF WE ARE STILL ALIVE 
THEN 
MAYBE THEN 
THIS MOMENT WILL SURVIVE 

THEN 
MAYBE THEN 
IF WE ARE STILL ALIVE 
THEN 
MAYBE THEN 
THIS MOMENT WILL SURVIVE 

[Beethoven turns to Fate and tells her, "I did not need this childhood. I did not need my mother to die when I was five. I did not need an alcoholic father or this sadistic teacher. I did not need such pain as a child. This! Remove all of this from my life."] 

[Fate tells him that it will all be as he wishes but before she grants his request he should be aware that when she removes the pains of his childhood he will also lose the inspiration that led to the Sixth Symphony. When faced with this choice, Beethoven realizes that he is not willing to lose the Sixth Symphony and withdraws his request.] 

[Fate then says, "Surely there were happy times, magical moments?"] 

[Beethoven replies, "There were some."] 

["Like the first time you arrived in Vienna?"] 

["Like the first time I arrived in Vienna."] 

[Within seconds they are there witnessing a rhapsodizing Beethoven as a young man seeing Vienna for the first time.]
