[Tran-Do]

The silence (in Khmer)

Don't go

Does it have to be this way?

Can't we have just one more chance?

Those who know
They will not say

Must this be the final...

Dance in our lives?
As time just moves on
Yesterday's years
Are too quickly gone

All visions fade
As worlds fall apart
Decisions are made
But there in this dark now
There in this dark now

Somewhere on this night
A life is out there
And can someone tell me how

Here on this night
So far away
Bits of starlight
Fall where they may

I never wanted to go
I never wanted to stay
I never wanted to be afraid
But still
Childhood sees what childhood will
But nothing ever stays the same

I fear the night
I fear the dark
I need this light
That distant spark

I know that...

Somewhere

Someone's looking to deceive and

Somewhere

Young men die and children bleed and

Somewhere

Some have too much while others need and

Somewhere

Someone's looking to believe and...

Somewhere
Somewhere
Somewhere
Somewhere

And the night and the dark
And the hopes and the dreams
As we all play our parts
While ignoring the screams

So we lie to ourselves
And we just carry on
Never stop, never turn
Don't admit what is...

Gone in to this twisted story
All these things so clear before me
Every path we've ever taken
Can't admit we were mistaken

In this night
Of my devising
Never live
And never dying

Each escape
I've never taken
Never dream
And never waken...

Somewhere

Someone's looking to deceive and

Somewhere

Young men die and children bleed and

Somewhere

Some have too much while others need and

Somewhere

Someone's looking to believe and...

[Tran-Do sees himself as a snake oil salesman selling the same lies that he was sold in a carnival barker's voice.]

Come one come all
Welcome to the world's greatest entertainment since the fall of rome
Life, death
Victims, voyeurs
The best of society
The lowest of plebeians
And to keep it all in extremely interesting, today's patrons
Could very easily be tomorrow's entertainment
All compliments of the ultimate showman fate
All that's missing is the coliseum

[Tran-Do turns away from the apparition of himself as a snake oil salesman, and once more looks into the abyss.]

Did you ever walk up
To the edge of a cliff
Stare into the abyss
As your mind wonders if

You should take one more step
Further into that night
Well your mind says you won't
But your heart says you might

Would you fall through the dark
Feel the wind in your hair
Would you embrace the ground
And end your life right there

Or would god reach his hand
And that moment you fly
Or if he chanced to blink
And then, that moment you die
You die
You die
You die...

Stare into the dark
As the abyss keeps calling
Try to take a step
But then the mind keeps stalling

Can a single question
Just go on forever
As a single thought goes on
It's now or never

Stare into the dark
As the abyss keeps calling
Try to take a step
But then the mind keeps stalling

Can a single question
Just go on forever
As a single thought goes on
It's now or never

Never really took much
Never really had to
Only had a small crush
Problem was that it grew

Never really took much
Never really had to
Only had a small crush
Problem was that it grew

Be who you are
What you were
What they see

From eternity's view
Tell me
Which one is me
Can you...

Be who you are
What you were
What they see

From eternity's view
Tell me
Which one is me

On this night
Keep me close
On this night
Breathe my air

On this night
Hold me tight
Feel my heart
Beating there

On this night
Keep me close
On this night
Breathe my air

On this night
Hold me tight
Feel my heart
Beating there

On this night
Keep me close
On this night
Breathe my air

On this night
Hold me tight
Feel my heart
Beating there...

Did you ever walk up
To the edge of a cliff
Stare into the abyss
As your mind wonders if

You should take one more step
Further into that night
Well your mind says you won't
But then this all is your life

Your life
Your life
This all is your life
Your life
Your life

This all is your life
Your life
Your life

This all is your life
Your life
Your life
This all is your...

Is your life
Is your life
Is your life
Is your... life
