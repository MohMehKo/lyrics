[BEETHOVEN] 

AND HERE IN THE NIGHT 
AS I FEEL THE INFERNO 
I STARE IN THE DARK 
THINKING WHAT IS ETERNAL 

THE MAN OR THE MOMENT 
THE ACT OR THE REASON 
THESE THOUGHTS FILL MY HEAD 
AS I CONTEMPLATE TREASON 

OF DREAMS I HAVE HAD 
AND DREAMS I HAVE PONDERED 
WHEN LATE IN THE NIGHT 
MY MIND IT WOULD WANDER 

TO THINGS I HAVE DONE 
AND THEN QUICKLY REGRETTED 
WHILE DENYING VICES 
MY LIFE HAD SELECTED 

AND I THINK WHAT I'VE DONE 
OR HAVE YET TO BEGIN 
AND THE MAN I'VE BECOME 
AND THE MAN THAT I'VE BEEN 

NOW CAUGHT IN A WALTZ 
WITH THE ETERNAL DANCER 
I'M COURTED BY DEATH 
BUT DEATH ISN'T THE ANSWER 
I SAY 

ALL I WAS 
MEANT TO BE 
COULD I 
SUDDENLY 
JUST DECIDE 
NOT A THOUGHT 
WOULD SURVIVE 
COULD IT BE 
MY LIFE'S WORTH 
ENDED THERE 
WITH MY BIRTH 

IF I COULD SEE SOMEONE 
WHO'S BEEN THERE BEFORE ME 
AND TRADED HIS SOUL 
FOR A MOMENT OF GLORY 

HIS PENANCE OR MERCY 
BY SPIRITS DEBATED 
WHILE JUDGED ON A SCALE 
THAT'S BEEN HEAVILY WEIGHTED 

AND WHAT HAVE I DONE 
COULD THERE BE SUCH A SIN 
IN THIS MAN I'VE BECOME 
IN THIS MAN THAT I'VE BEEN 

NOW CALLING TO GOD 
FROM THE PIT'S VERY BOTTOM 
I PRAY HE FORGIVES 
EVERY SIN I'VE FORGOTTEN 
THIS DAY 

AND WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT 
THAT MY FATE IT WOULD CONJURE 
THIS TWIST IN THE ROAD 
ON WHICH I HAVE WANDERED 

EACH VISION AND DREAM NOW 
COMPLETELY DISMEMBERED 
TO GIVE ONE'S WHOLE LIFE 
AND FIND NOTHING'S 
REMEMBERED 

AND WHAT GOOD IS A LIFE 
THAT LEAVES NOTHING BEHIND 
NOT A THOUGHT OR A DREAM 
THAT MIGHT ECHO IN TIME 

THE YEARS AND THE HOURS 
THE SECONDS AND MINUTES 
AND EVERYTHING THAT 
MY LIFE HAS PLACED IN IT 
BETRAYED 
BETRAYED 
BETRAYED 

THE THINGS I HAVE DONE 
THE PLACES I'VE BEEN 
THE COST OF MY DREAMS 
THE WEIGHT OF MY SINS 

AND EVERYTHING THAT 
I'VE GATHERED IN LIFE 
COULD IT BE LOST 
COULD IT BE LOST IN THIS 
COULD IT BE LOST IN THIS 
NIGHT 

[Crushed by the dilemma he finds himself in and unable to reach a decision, Beethoven tries to recall the particular actions in his life that have led to his damnation. In anger, he confronts Fate for having dealt him such a cruel hand in life. Taken a back by his accusations, she offers to review his life with him and to change anything that he wishes to change.] 

[Delighted with this unexpected proposition, Beethoven accepts. When she asks where he would like to start, Beethoven says the first thing he would change is his childhood. Fate takes him back through time where he finds himself as a young child sitting at a piano. He has just been cruelly slapped by a tutor for having failed to receive an appointment to the emperor's court. His tutor is trying to create a new child wonder, similar to Mozart, but unlike Mozart, Beethoven is an awkward and gangly youth. Now, sitting alone at the piano, he is trying to console himself by playing a melody that he finds soothing. Beethoven recognizes the melody as the future Sixth Symphony and sitting down next to the child completes the tune. The child smiles at this kindly adult and after they talk for awhile, asks if they might meet again and finish the song. Beethoven reassures the child that one day that just might possibly happen.]
