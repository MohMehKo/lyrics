[BEETHOVEN] 

SOMETIMES 
SLOWLY 
TIME BRINGS REVELATION 

WAITING 
SOFTLY 
FOR SOMEONE TO BELIEVE 

THAT THE GHOSTS WE'VE HIDDEN OR LEFT TO DIE 
HAVE NOW ARISEN AND WILL ARRIVE 
TO SAY WHAT HAS HAPPENED 
SAY WHAT HAS HAPPENED 
SAY WHAT HAS HAPPENED 
TO ME 

AND WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT 
THAT YOU'D BE THE ONE 
THAT I WOULD HAVE FOUND HERE WAITING 

LOST IN THIS NIGHT 
UNTIL YOU ARRIVED 
AND ALWAYS TOO BLIND TO SEE 

AND WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT 
THAT AFTER THIS TIME 
THAT I'D BE THE ONE YOU'RE SAVING 

NOW UNDISGUISED 
THE GHOSTS THAT SURVIVE 
NOW SAY WHAT WAS MEANT TO BE 

I NEVER WANTED TO GIVE MY LIFE AWAY 
WHO EVER THOUGHT IT WOULD MATTER ANY WAY 

WANDERING INSIDE THIS NIGHT 
FINDING PIECES OF A LIFE 
NEVER SURE I'D EVER KNOW WHAT IT MEANS 

IT'S THE STRANGERS IN YOUR LIFE 
THAT YOU'D NEVER THOUGHT YOU'D MEET 
IT'S THE HAND THAT PICKED YOU UP 
WHEN YOU'RE LAYING IN THE STREET 

IT'S THE HAND THAT CUT YOU DOWN 
IT'S THE DREAM THAT SOMEONE SHARED 
WHEN YOU THOUGHT THAT ALL WAS LOST 
IT'S THE FRIEND THAT WASN'T THERE 

YOU CAN RUN FROM ALL THE MEMORY 
BUT NEVER GET THAT FAR 
FOR IN THE END THEY'LL FIND YOU 
FOR THIS IS WHO YOU ARE 

CHANGE ONE NOTE 
CHANGE ONE LINE 
NOTHING'S GOING TO BE THE SAME 
CHANGE ONE LOSS 
CHANGE ONE CUT 
EVERYTHING IS RE-ARRANGED 

EVERY ACT 
CRUEL OR KIND 
LOST INSIDE OUR MEMORY 
IF YOU LOOK 
THERE IN TIME 

YOU'LL FIND IT IN 
FIND IT IN 
FIND IT IN 
YOU'LL FIND IT IN ME
