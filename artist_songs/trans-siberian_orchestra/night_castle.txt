[Lieutenant]

I have been this way before
Check each window
Every door
For a passage through
This night
This night

But each hallway
Ends the same
Every door's been
Checked in vain
For a way to reach that light
That light

As I move in deeper
Towards this castle's keeper
Every stair seems steeper
Am I risking my own life
My life

Then a falcon in the air
Looking down
Returns my stare
While she's circling around
Around

Then she dives straight towards a
Wall
Then she isn't there at all
And is gone without a sound
No sound

I have no choice but to follow
What was solid now is hollow
Stairways hidden behind curtains
Realizing nothing is certain

Suddenly up stairs I'm climbing
Then through hallways twisted,
Winding
This falcon on her endeavor
Do these stairs just go forever
On

And in that room
An old man sitting there
He's writing notes
And drops them in the air

Somewhere outside
Upon an ocean breeze
Which takes them out
Past where the eye can see
