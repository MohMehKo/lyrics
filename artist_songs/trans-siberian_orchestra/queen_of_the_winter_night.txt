[NARRATION]

And so back at the hotel 
Our angel again arrived 
But this time he went up the front steps 
Which, of course, led him inside 
(it's one of those things that architects 
Conveniently decide) 

Now hotels are quite like people 
No two exactly the same 
And this one had such a magical past 
The angel found himself quite entertained 

The foyer still had an elegance 
That the years could not disguise 
And the shadows of christmas eves long disappeared 
This night, still gently glided by 

For in this hotel, here side by side 
The past and the present dwelled 
And the ghosts who lived here not only lived 
They honestly, lived well 

The lobby had a steinway piano 
That was steeped in memories 
And some said duke ellington's fingers 
Still lingered on those keys 

There was a grand palace ballroom 
Where princesses had once waltzed 
Whose beauty and sense of style 
The newspapers would constantly exhault 

The ghosts of rockefellers and vanderbilts 
Still met at their christmas eve charity balls 
Raising money not for themselves 
But raising it for all 
(and the sound of their children laughing 
Still echoed in these halls) 

Now these spirits of course, could not be seen 
By any human eyes 
But each one smiled at the angel 
When they saw him walking by 

And these ghosts reminded the angel 
How every human waiting to be born, 
And every life that had already left 
When it was tired out and worn 

Were connected by those alive right now 
Which gave the living quite a trust, 
To pass on what was best and good 
Inside of each of us 

Now within each guest room he heard many hearts 
And behind each heart there was a life 
And the angel carefully read them all 
With the next hour of that night 

When he reached the grand palace ballroom 
It was behind closed mahogany doors 
And when the angel was passing by it 
He could hear music begin once more 

It seemed that since this room was built 
Musicians did permanently reside 
And then the angel did what we all would do 
He went to look inside 

And there he found such a majestic orchestra 
To please all, it would be enough 
But then someone plugged a guitar in 
And the volume, it crept up 

So with a song inspired by mozart's 
Famous "queen of the night" 
The orchestra added the word, "winter" 
And some notes, some fog, some lights
