In the night 
Was the dark 
In the dark 
Was the dream 
In the dream 
Was the Child 
And myself 
There unseen 

In the book was the word 
In the word there was truth 
In the truth there was age 
In the age there was youth 

And I said to the Child 
Do your hands they still bleed 
After all of this time 
Do you think there's still need 
But the Child only smiled 

And said not a word 
And the snow it came down 
As if it hadn't heard 

And all that night the snow came down 
To heal the scars our lives had found 
And the dreams that lay broken 

And there upon a bridge of dreams 
Across the night we walked unseen 
With no words ever spoken 

And then on through that night 
We did walk for a while 
And our steps turned to blocks 
And the blocks turned to miles 

Then we followed a path 
For as far as we could 
Till we found ourselves there 
In an evergreen woods 

There were thousands of candles 
Upon every tree 
It was beautiful 
But there was one mystery 
For with all of those candles 
You must understand 
That the only one lit 
Was now in that Child's hand 

And there upon that Christmas scene 
The candle wax of melted dreams 
And the years they had taken 

And as the snow did gently fall 
He one by one relit them all 
Till each dream was awakened 

And there to that light 
That young Child showed to me 
All the things that he dreamt 
All the things that might be 
How for everything given 
That something was gained 
Strike one match in the dark 
And all the world's not the same 

And then I asked that Child 
Why this night has a star 
And he said, "So we'd know 
That we could see that far" 
And these candles are wed 
To that distant star's light 
And it all came to be 
Upon that long winter's night 
That long winter's night 
That long winter's night 
That long winter's night 

And when I awoke, well the Child he was gone 
But somewhere in my mind 
I believe he lives on 
And somewhere in my life 
Between here and the end 
On a long winter's night 
I will dream him again 

THEN SHE NOTICED ON SOME CHRISTMAS CARDS 
A REDDISH PURPLE STAIN 
WHERE SOMEONE HAD SPILLED SOME CHRISTMAS WINE 
AND THERE IT HAD REMAINED 

UNTIL THE HEAT FROM A RADIATOR 
WHISTLING IN THE AIR 
HAD CAUSED IT TO EVAPORATE 
INTO AN ANGEL'S SHARE
