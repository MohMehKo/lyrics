In the middle of a forest 
There's a clearing by a stream 
Where a mother holds her newborn 
And the child begins to dream 

And he dreams of hopes unspoken 
When the tears of man will cease 
And his mother holds him closer 
For he is the Prince of peace 

Let the bells ring out these tidings 
Let it echo across the land 
That a king is born in Bethlehem 
And his kingdom is at hand 

Let the world rejoice together 
As it looks upon the stars 
Knowing every man's our brother 
And that every child is ours 

Hark, the herald angels sing 
Glory to the newborn king 
Peace on earth and mercy mild 
God and sinners reconciled 
Glory all ye nations rise 
Join the triumph of the skies 

With the heavenly host proclaim 
Christ is born in Bethlehem 
Hark, the herald angels sing 
Glory to the newborn king 

In the middle of a forest 
There's a clearing by a stream 
Where a mother holds her newborn 
And the child begins to dream 

AS HE FLEW O'ER SARAJEVO 
THERE WERE SCARS UPON THE LAND 
THERE WERE SCARS UPON THE PEOPLE 
IT WAS HARD TO UNDERSTAND 

AND THE DEEPEST SCARS OF ALL 
WHICH TO HUMANS ARE UNSEEN 
BUT THE ANGEL COULD SEE CLEARLY 
WERE THE SCARS UPON THE DREAMS 

LIKE BELFAST AND BURUNDI 
RWANDA, PALESTINE 
THE ONLY DECORATIONS HERE 
HAD BEEN AWARDED FOR THEIR CRIMES 

AND IN THE GARDENS WHERE THE CHILDREN PLAYED 
NOW SOLDIERS ONLY TROD 
AND STRANGER STILL, HE HEARD SOME SAY 
THAT THEY WERE KILLING FOR THEIR GOD 

NOW THE ANGEL HEARD GOD SPEAK MANY TIMES 
AND HE HAD ALWAYS PAID ATTENTION 
BUT THIS KILLING OF ONES NEIGHBOR 
WAS SOMETHING THE LORD HAD NEVER MENTIONED 

BUT AS HE NEARED THE EARTH 
OF A RECENT BATTLEGROUND 
FROM AMONG THE RUINS 
HE ONCE MORE HEARD THE SOUND 

IT WAS A SINGLE CELLO PLAYING 
A FORGOTTEN CHRISTMAS SONG 
AND EVEN ON THAT BATTLEFIELD 
THE SONG SOMEHOW BELONGED 

AND AS HE FLEW AWAY 
THE ANGEL DID TAKE NOTE 
THAT WHERE HE FOUND MUSIC PLAYED 
ONE ALWAYS COULD FIND HOPE
