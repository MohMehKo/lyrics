Remember last Christmas Eve 
When we sat next to our first tree 
Ornaments reflected light 
Of a candle in the night 

And I gave you a music box 
Back then that seemed like so much 
We watched it go round and round 
As the melodies unwound 

But all these things are now long gone 
And not to be wished upon again 

But the musical box continues to turn 
The candle in the window continues to burn 
But I know they're just memories 
Like Christmas past and you and me 

Remember that old fireplace 
That held the room in warm embrace 
And as we watched for Christmas ghosts 
The fire held the shadows close 

But now upon that Christmas scene 
The candle wax of melted dreams 
And ornaments of shattered glass 
Now belonging to the past 

But all these things are now long gone 
And not to be wished upon again 

But the musical box continues to turn 
The candle in the window continues to burn 
But I know they're just memories 
Like Christmas past and you and me 

BEHIND THAT SINGLE LETTER 
WAS A WEATHERED PHOTOGRAPH 
OF THAT MAN IN THE ARTICLE 
BUT FROM SOMEWHERE IN HIS PAST 

AND STANDING THERE BESIDE HIM 
IN A SETTING SUMMER SUN 
WAS THE LADY WHO USED TO OWN THIS HOUSE 
ONLY HERE SHE WAS QUITE YOUNG 

SHE HAD MOVED TO A SMALLER PLACE 
THAT WAS ONLY RIGHT NEXT DOOR 
AND THEN THE CHILD NOTICED SOMETHING ELSE 
THAT SHE HAD MISSED BEFORE 

THIS LETTER HAD NO STAMP IT SEEMED 
AND WAS SURELY NEVER SENT 
AND AS SHE SAT UPON THE FLOOR 
THAT CHILD SHE WONDERED WHAT IT MEANT 

THEN THE ANGEL WHISPERED TO HER 
A MOST IMPORTANT FACT 
THAT FOR COMPASSION TO BE REAL 
IT REQUIRES ONE TO ACT 

THEN ONCE AGAIN THAT CHILD CAME UP 
WITH A CHILD'S IDEA 
BUT SHE KNEW SHE MUST ACT FAST 
FOR TIME, IT WAS GROWING DEAR 

SO TAKING THAT ARTICLE BACK DOWNSTAIRS 
SHE FOUND THE KITCHEN PHONE 
AND CALLED UP INFORMATION 
TO FIND THE NUMBER OF HIS HOME 

AND WHEN HE PICKED UP THE RECEIVER 
SHE QUICKLY TOLD HIM QUITE ENOUGH 
TO KNOW WHO WAS WAITING ON THIS NIGHT FOR HIM 
AND THEN THE CHILD, SHE JUST HUNG UP 

THEN TO MAKE SURE THAT NO ONE WAS AWAKE 
SHE TOOK A QUICK LOOK DOWN THE HALL 
THEN SHE FOUND HER NEIGHBOR'S NUMBER 
AND REPEATED THAT SAME CALL
