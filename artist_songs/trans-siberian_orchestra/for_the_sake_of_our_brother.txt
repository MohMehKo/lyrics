[NARRATION]

And though his time was growing strained 
He could not walk away from this soul in pain 
For in the dark he had now seen 
The bleeding of this wound extreme 

So along the snow covered sidewalk 
The angel did carefully step 
Following the trail of blood drops 
Combined with tears that had never been wept 

And then he saw the businessman 
Who had been grumbling about this night 
And he wondered how that man had carried this wound 
So long throughout his life 

He watched the man walk past the church 
Where a song seemed to reach out for him 
But the man just walked right past it 
And would not let it in 

[FOR THE SAKE OF OUR BROTHER]

In a stable 
In a manger 
In the cold winter's air 
In the arms of his mother 
A child's lying there 

In a city 
In a village 
Though the years have gone by 
The child still remains 
With the dream still close by 

And each year on this night that child reawakens 
And each year on this night that hope rebegins 
That the dream he has offered might one day be taken 

For the sake of our brother 
For the child who's forgotten 
For the dream that is still lying there 

O' come all ye faithful 
Joyful and triumphant 
O' come ye, o' come ye 
To bethlehem 
Come and adore him 
Born the king of angels 

O' come let us adore him 
O' come let us adore him 
O' come let us adore him 
Christ the lord 

In a stable 
In a manger 
In the cold winter's air 
In the arms of his mother a child's lying there
