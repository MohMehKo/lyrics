[Lieutenant]

What child
This night
Whose dreams
Take flight?

What child
Somewhere
Sleeps
Unaware?

What life
That yet
Has no
Regrets?

What child
Who knows
What dreams
I've closed?

Time floats on
As I write these letters
That you'll never see

Still each one's gone
Placed in a bottle
So tides they might follow
And somehow find their way to thee

What child
This night
Whose wings
Take flight?

On evening
Winds
What dreams
Begins?

Each day
Begets
Its own
Regrets

Do I
Dare wait
Or joust
With fate?

Time floats on
As I write these letters
That you'll never see

Still each one's gone
Placed in a bottle
So the tides they might follow
And somehow find their way to thee
