I wasn't sure what you were thinking
I saw a distance in your eyes
The passion we once had is fading
Into the whirlwind of our lives

But you sit right there
Like you don't care
If we try real hard
We'll get somewhere 'cause

It's all about the lovin'
It's not about the pain
Tell me what your heart says
Forget about the blame

It's all about the lovin'
It's not about the pain
Tell me what your heart says
Forget about the blame

Forget about the blame

If love is strong then we will make it
The burned out flame we can relight
There's nothing i can do
I'm now a part of you and
I can't take living separate lives

But you sit right there
Like you don't care
And you tell me that your life's not fair
But we all have our own cross to bear

It's all about the lovin'
It's not about the pain
Tell me what your heart says
Forget about the blame

It's all about the lovin'
It's not about the pain
Tell me what your heart says
Forget about the blame

It's all for the love
It's all for the love
It's all for the love
It's not about the pain

Our two hearts beat the same

Forget the blame
It's all for love
It's not for pain
Forget the blame

It's all about the lovin'
It's not about the pain
Just tell me what your heart says
Forget about the blame

It's all about the lovin'
It's not about the pain
Tell me what your heart says
Forget about the blame

It's all about the lovin'
It's not about the pain
Tell me what your heart says
Forget about the blame

Forget about the blame
Forget about the blame
Forget about the blame
