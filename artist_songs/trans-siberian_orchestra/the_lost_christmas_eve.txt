[NARRATION]

Another year has come and past 
Like moments through an hourglass 
And at the end of this year's trail 
An offering, a final tale 

Of love, long lost 
And then refound 
And the child by which 
Those dreams were bound 

Of a dusty hotel 
That was long past old 
And the shadows and the memories 
Its hallways still hold 

For things that are old 
Have the best tales to tell 
And usually, 
They tell them well 

And so it's here, my dear children 
That our story truly starts 
When the lord sent once more to the earth 
An angel, with a childlike heart 

And on this night his mission was 
To find somewhere on this earth 
That human that best reflected his son 
And carried on his work 

And since this mission from his lord 
Had to be completed on this one night 
The angel quickly unfolded his wings 
And towards the earth took flight 

And this night, in case you have not guessed 
Was once more christmas eve 
When snow and light and angels' flights 
All together weave 

But of the angel's instructions 
There was one thing more 
That would make this journey to the earth 
Harder than all the ones before 

For the lord had also told the angel 
That he could only use his wings twice this christmas eve 
Once when he descended to the earth 
And once more when he would leave 
(not unlike ourselves some think, 
Or at least so i believe) 

Now this put quite a complication 
In what the angel planned 
For now he had to choose most carefully 
Exactly where he would land 

He needed to find a single place 
That would represent all mankind 
But humans were such a varied lot 
Such a place would surely be hard to find 

A single place where there would be 
Humans of every race and creed 
The rich and poor, the thrilled and bored 
The failures with those who succeed 

But after a few moments 
Carefully placed in thought 
The answer appeared in the angel's mind 
The city called new york 

And as he neared that city 
Where all those souls did dwell 
He felt himself being drawn towards 
An old, rundown hotel 

For in a city that usually had 
Guards at nearly every single door 
This one just had a sign that said "vacancies, 
There is always room for one more" 

Now why the angel decided to stop there 
He could not quite say the reason 
But he thought the sign upon that hotel 
Somehow fit the sentiment of this season 

Now even after all these years 
The building was still a work of art 
And though some facade had crumbled here and there 
Most still had their parts 

The walls were made of granite 
Not aluminum or steel 
And every pillar and ballistrade 
Still had its artist's feel 

Every gutter had a gargoyle 
Every gargoyle had its wings 
For angels can appreciate 
Other flying things 

So he landed on a cathedral roof 
Across the street from that hotel 
And looked down upon the world below 
Where all those souls did dwell 

And sitting on that rooftop 
With his friend the winter wind 
He gazed carefully at that scene below 
As he slowly took it in 

[THE LOST CHRISTMAS EVE]

On a street in the night 
In the cold winter's light 
A child stands alone and she's waiting 

And the light that's out there 
It just hangs in the air 
As if it was just hesitating 

And the snow it comes down 
And it muffles the sound 
Of dreams on their way to tomorrow 

And when they appear 
This night will hold them near 
For where they will lead 
She will follow 

For here in this city of lights 
This evening awakens 
The dreams that it might 
The winter it conjures 
The spells it will weave 
The snow gently covers the ground 
Christmas eve 

In this scene 
On this night 
There's an ancient hotel 
Where shadows they do tend to wander 

And the ghosts that live here 
Hold each moment so dear 
For time's not a thing one should squander 

And they recount their sand 
As it runs through their hand 
And examine each moment for meaning 

It can be wished upon 
Till the moment it's gone 
Like day disappears into evening 

For here in this city of lights 
This evening awakens 
The dreams that it might 
The winter it conjures 
The moment is seized 
The snow gently covers the ground 
Christmas eve 

Merry christmas 
Merry christmas 
Merry christmas 
Merry christmas 

Christmas 
Christmas 
Christmas 
Christmas 

Through this night 
The dream still wanders 
As it was meant to be 
And every year this night grows fonder 

Of children and circumstance 
Caught in this childhood dance 
As the world turns around 
Keeping dreams on the ground 

Windows of frosted ice 
Prisming candlelight 
And somehow we 
Start to believe 

In the night and the dream 
As it cuts through the noise 
With the whisper of snow 
As it starts to deploy 

In the depths of a night 
That's about to begin 
With the feeling of snow 
As it melts on your skin 

And it covers the land 
With a dream so intense 
That it returns us all 
To a child's innocence 

And then what you'd thought lost 
And could never retrieve 
Is suddenly there to be found 
On christmas eve 
On christmas eve 
On christmas...
