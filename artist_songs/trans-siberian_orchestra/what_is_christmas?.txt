[NARRATION]

By this time a harder rocking stage 
Would be impossible to find 
And though no one was now drinking 
The owner did not seem to mind 

And the angel marveled how one man 
Could turn around a life 
And then that life turn around another's 
And how it rippled through this night 

But there was someone in that room 
Whose heart had not been changed 
A heart that had grown so hard 
You'd have thought it could never be arranged 

It was the businessman from downtown 
Who had stopped there to rest his feet 
And he clung to his drink 
(where he watched his thoughts sink) 
While any strangers, he refused to greet 

You could see upon his face 
How happiness had been so long deferred 
It was practically as if unhappiness 
Had somehow become preferred 

Now the angel had not seen the businessman 
Though they had in that room been near 
Nor did the angel see him as he left the bar 
When he could no longer stand this christmas cheer 

And as the businessman exited the door 
He heard someone complaining on the tv 
It was the "grinch" ranting against christmas 
And the man found that he agreed 

[WHAT IS CHRISTMAS?]

What is christmas? 
Tinseled fairytales 
Day old stockings lined up in a row 

What is christmas 
Could someone tell me that? 
What is christmas? 
Surely, i don't know 

And everywhere these lights 
Who needs to color night? 
Could this whole thing be planned? 
I do not understand 

This christmas 
Trees with colored lights 
Underneath they still are only trees 
Do you think that one day perhaps they might 
Find that christmas 
Is kind of a disease? 

Every year it's waiting for me 
Waiting for me 
Every year it constantly defies 
Placing strangers 
There before me 
There before me 
Spreading hope and cheer 
Mixed in with happiness 
Fraternal bliss and other christmas lies! 

And there's one more thing that i have discovered 
And i would now like you to know 
The reason for christmas i now realize 
Is an excuse to tolerate snow 
Snow! 
I don't even like the sound of it 
Anyway, where was i 
Oh, yes! 

What is christmas? 
Candles everywhere 
A fire hazard any other day 
Children light them 
No one seems to care 
All for christmas 

Every year it returns here 
And every year it's waiting for me 
Why can't christmas disappear 
And just pretend it never saw me 
Every year i get my hopes up 
That it will somehow just leave 
But every year i wake to find 
That once again it now is christmas eve
