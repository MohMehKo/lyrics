Child of the night
Dreams dare alight
Anywhere your heart does wander
Know that they will walk with thee

Each grain of sand
Falls as was planned
And within each precious moment
Are the things still yet to be

Night in its vespers
Dreams are its gestures
Stars fear no distance
Fear no distance

For they will guard you
Throughout your life

For they will guard you beyond this night

There
As their own
As their own
And forever more
Forevermore

Their
Child of the night
Dreams dare alight
Never fear and never falter
For the stars can always see

Dreams that are sent
With the intent
To carefully be brought to life
For such is childhood's alchemy

Precious as stardust
Such is a child's trust
And in its seasons
In its seasons

For they will guard you
Throughout your life
For they will guard you
Beyond this night

There
As their own
As their own
And forever more
Forevermore

Their child of the night
Dreams dare alight
Anywhere your heart does wander
Know that they will walk with thee
