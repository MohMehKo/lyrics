[THE MUSES] 

FEEL THE DARKNESS SMILING 
EVERY NOTE IS DYING 
SILENCE IS REFINING 
EVERY THOUGHT IN HIS HEART 

STILL THE FATES ARE WEAVING 
EVERY NOTE THAT'S BLEEDING 
AS HE SITS THERE SEETHING 
ALL ALONE IN THE DARK 
ALONE IN THE DARK 
ALONE IN THE ... 

BUT IN THE NIGHT 
THE DARKNESS BREATHES 
IF HE WILLS IT TO BE 

BEFORE HIS EYES 
THE MUSIC DIES 
BUT HE WILL ALWAYS HEAR ME 

HE SITS ALONE 
THE CARDS ARE SHOWN 
AS HE EMBRACES THE DARK 

THE ONLY SOUND 
THAT HE WILL HEAR 
IS THERE IN HIS HEART 

SOMEONE IS WHISPERING SOFTLY TO ME 
SHADOWS OF THINGS THAT NO ONE CAN SEE 
THEY ARE THERE FOR YOU IF YOU WANT THEM TO BE 
YOU WANT THEM TO BE 
YOU WANT THEM TO.... 

BUT IN THE NIGHT 
THE DARKNESS BREATHES 
IF HE WILLS IT TO BE 

BEFORE HIS EYES 
THE MUSIC DIES 
BUT HE WILL ALWAYS HEAR ME 

HE SITS ALONE 
THE CARDS ARE SHOWN 
AS HE EMBRACES THE DARK 

THE ONLY SOUND 
THAT HE WILL HEAR 
IS THERE IN HIS HEART
