[Mrs. Cozier]

You were the dream that survived
Lost in the darkness of eternity
You were the hope kept alive
Embraced by tomorrows that we all could never quite see

You had a beauty denied
You were the moment

But here in this night
Where your dream carries on
Never quite there but it's never quite gone
You are the star that is wished upon
Forever

You were the one that believed
Long past when belief was a memory
The child time would never concede
Faith and tomorrow and all of the things that might be

You had a beauty denied
A glittering moment
But here in this night
Where your dream carries on
Never quite there but it's never quite gone
You are the star that is wished upon
Forever

[Then in a sudden, unexpected, visceral voice, she raged against all those citizens of apathy and willful ignorance who lived behind the sacrifices of others.]

We thought evil dead
Killed by our own sword
But evil is patient
'Til the future grows bored

Do you believe in night
Does it hold you close
When you're at your last card
Pray hard, Father, Son & Holy Ghost
Still the night rolls on
Brings you to your knees
When you look back that far
Each scar, suddenly just starts to bleed

The night it keeps burning
While twisting and turning
Its way to tomorrow
Its joys and its sorrows

Our secrets beneath her
We drive each stake deeper
Then offer to barter
But each deal is harder

The cloaks we keep changing
While gliding through weddings
Of nights to their morning
Of dreams to their dawning

While reaching for moments
The world has forbidden
The kindness inside them
So carefully hidden

The pages keep turning
But no-one is learning
They feed them to pyres
To stoke up their fires

Of ignorance, apathy
Forbidding charity
The flames they grow higher
Could such be desired

And christ and Confucius
Are all their words useless
We quote them in fractions
But not in our actions

Aurelius, and Hugo
Auden and Gibran
The words they have written
Seem so quickly gone

For somewhere there's dirt
That was once reddish mud
From soaking up liquid
That was a man's blood

But both earth and god
They have deemed to forgive
So each year in the spring
New flowers do live

And of all the authors
Your favorite was Wilde
With each timeless story
All penned with such style

Of fairytale kingdoms
Where ogres save children
And no gardens have walls
So all children might use them

And since that's the ending
You valued the most
You cling to that card

Father, Son & Holy Ghost

Father, Son & Holy Ghost

Father, Son & Holy Ghost

Father, Son & Holy Ghost

Father, Son & Holy...

But here in this night
Where your dream carries on
Never quite there but it's never quite gone
You are the star that is wished upon

Forever
