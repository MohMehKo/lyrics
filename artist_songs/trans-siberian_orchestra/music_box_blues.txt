Remember last Christmas Eve 
When we sat next to our first tree 
Ornaments reflected light 
Of a candle in the night 

And I gave you a music box 
Back then that seemed like so much 
We watched it go round and round 
As the melodies unwound 

But all these things are now long gone 
And not to be wished upon again 

But the music box continues to turn 
The candle in the window continues to burn 
But I know they're just memories 
Like Christmas past and you and me 

Remember that old fireplace 
That held the room in warm embrace 
And as we watched for Christmas ghosts 
The fire held the shadows close 

But now upon that Christmas scene 
The candle wax of melted dreams 
And ornaments of shattered glass 
Now belonging to the past 

But all these things are now long gone 
And not to be wished upon again 

But the music box continues to turn 
The candle in the window continues to burn 
But I know they're just memories 
Like Christmas past and you and me 

I miss you baby 
Oh yes, I do 
And it's been far too long 
Since I last laid eyes on you 

[1.] 
I got the lights upon the Christmas tree 
I got the candle lit for you to see 
And beside this window I will wait 
For inside this night it's not too late 

[add the solo stanza after the second time] 

[2.] 
I got the lights 
Up on the tree 
They're shining bright 
If you'd just believe 
Just believe with me 

The candles burning 
You know I'm gonna wait 
The clock keeps turning 
But I know it's not 
I know it's not too late... 

I got the lights upon the Christmas tree 
I got the candle lit for you to see 
And beside this window I will wait 
For inside this night 
I know it's not too late
