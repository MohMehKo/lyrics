Angels we have heard on high 
Sweetly singing o'er the plains, 
And the mountains in reply 
Echoing their joyous strains. 

Ooh, ooh, ooh... 
Gloria, in excelsis Deo! 

THE NEXT LETTER THAT SHE FOUND 
WAS BY A RIBBON GENTLY BOUND 
TO THE KEY FOR A SMALL MUSIC BOX 
AND SHE PLACED THAT KEY INTO ITS LOCK 

AND THE MELODY THAT IT HAD LEARNED 
ONCE AGAIN BEGAN TO TURN 
AND AS THAT TUNE IT FILLED THE AIR 
SHE OPENED THE LETTER THAT WAS THERE 

AND THAT LETTER CONTAINED A NEWS CLIPPING 
ABOUT A MAN WITH MANY THINGS 
IN HIS WORLD, A GREAT SUCCESS 
AND WHERE HE LIVED, THE BEST ADDRESS 
HIS HAPPY LIFE THE WORLD DID KNOW 
BECAUSE THE PAPERS TOLD US SO 

BUT THE ANGEL HE COULD CLEARLY SEE 
THAT ALL WAS NOT AS IT APPEARED TO BE 
FOR ON THIS NIGHT AS SNOW CLOUDS GATHERED 
THAT MAN WONDERED IF THAT ALL REALLY MATTERED 
AND ON THIS NIGHT INSIDE HIS HOME 
HE REALIZED THAT HE WAS ALONE 
AND HE ASKED HIMSELF WHAT HIS LIFE HAD MEANT 
HOW ALL THESE YEARS THEY HAD BEEN SPENT 
AND HOW HE COULD FEEL HIS LIFE SUCH A WASTE 
WHEN HE HAD EVERY DREAM THAT HE HAD CHASED 

BUT THEN THE ANGEL WHISPERED IN HIS EAR 
AND IN HIS MIND THE MAN HEARD CLEAR 
TELL ME ONE WISH THAT YOU HAVE GRANTED 
TELL ME ONE LIFE YOU'VE ENCHANTED 
TELL ME ONE OF THESE THINGS THAT YOU HAVE DONE 
BUT THE MAN COULD NOT RECALL A SINGLE ONE 

HE WAS CLOSE TO NO ONE, THIS THING HE DID KNOW 
WELL THERE WAS ONE PERSON, BUT THAT WAS LONG AGO 
AND THOUGHT THAT SOMEONE 
HAD BEEN FAR MORE THAN A FRIEND 
IT WAS FAR TOO LATE TO EVER GO BACK TO HER AGAIN
