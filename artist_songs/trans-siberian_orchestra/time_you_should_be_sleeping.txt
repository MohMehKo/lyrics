Time you should be sleeping
Everyone around you
Is already dreaming
And closely by

Stars are looking downward
Glad that they have found you
Watching and protecting
So you should try

To close your eyes until tomorrow
Childhood dreams are always new
And when you are there I'll follow
And believe that my whole life is

I can see you breathing
Know that I am near you
Feel the evening whisper
In gentle sighs

To close your eyes until tomorrow
Childhood dreams are always new
And when you are there I'll follow
And believe that my whole life is
You
