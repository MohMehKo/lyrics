Joy to the world 
The Lord has come 
Let earth 
Receive her king 

Now it was long ago 
When it all began 
Back in Bethlehem 
In the promised land 

When a single star 
Appeared in the sky 
And three kings saw 
And they each asked why 
Asked why... 

And they checked the books 
Full of prophecy 
And the one king said 
Why it's plain to me 

You see it means 
That a king is born 
Who will save mankind 
On this blessed morn 
Blessed morn... 

So they packed some gold 
Myrrh and frankincense 
On some old camel 
With some fancy tents 

Closed down the house 
Set the servants free 
And three kings rode 
Into history 
History... 

It was long ago 
In a foreign land 
When the Lord looked down 
Said to make a stand 
So He sent His son 
And said, 'through him you'll know me!' 
You'll know me 

Then the angels came 
And when they start to sing 
All at once the past 

It doesn't mean a thing 
And the star comes out 
And the wise men say, Hey show me! 
Oh, show me 

And they followed it 
Over hills and sand 
Til' they found the child 
Like it all was planned 
And as they knelt before 
The newborn king 

The angel's were singing 
In their angel style 
How all of our hopes 
Had come down to this child 

THEN HE REACHED FOR THE SONG 
AND HE HELD IT IN HIS HAND 
(IT WAS SOMETHING THAT HE DID 
BECAUSE ANGELS CAN) 

AND HE WONDERED TO HIMSELF 
"IT THIS THE ANSWER THAT I SOUGHT" 
BUT SOMETHING WAS STILL MISSING 
OR AT LEAST SO HE STILL THOUGHT 

AND SO HE JOURNEYED ON 
THROUGH THE MIDNIGHT WINTER AIR 
WHEN ALL AT ONCE OUR ANGEL 
FELT THE TOUCH OF A MAN'S PRAYER 

AND LOOKING ONCE MORE TO THE EARTH 
TO DETERMINE WHENCE IT CAME 
HE FELT A MILLION SOULS BELOW 
BUT ONE WAS NOT THE SAME 

FOR THERE HE SAW A MAN ALONE 
THOUGH HE WAS WALKING IN A CROWD 
AND THOUGH THIS MAN HAD RARELY PRAYED 
TONIGHT HIS HEAD WAS BOWED 

FOR EVEN IN A CROWD, YOU SEE 
A HEART CAN FEEL ALONE 
WHEN THE NIGHT IS CHRISTMAS EVE 
A CHILD IS NOT AT HOME 

SO FROM A FATHER TO THE LORD 
A PRAYER DID SWIFTLY RACE 
BUT THE ANGEL SAW IT FIRST 
AND HE LISTENED TO ITS CASE
