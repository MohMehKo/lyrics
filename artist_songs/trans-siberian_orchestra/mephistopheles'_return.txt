[BEETHOVEN] 

IN EVERY LIFE 
IT HAS BEEN SAID 
THERE COMES A TIME TO JOIN THE DEAD 
ADMIT THERE IS NO SECOND CHANCE 
AND JOIN DEATH IN A FINAL DANCE 

ACROSS THE FLOOR ETERNITY 
UNTIL THE FINAL MOMENTS BLED 
AND IN THE DARK TO TAKE HIS HAND 
ACCEPT THAT IT IS TIME TO WED 

I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M THINKING 
BECAUSE ALL THAT I SEE 
IS HIS FACE GRINNING 
MEPHISTOPHELES 

I NEED TO FIND AN ANSWER 
FOR THIS ONE CAN NOT BE 
WITHIN THE WORDS OF MEPHISTOPHEL... 

[TOWARDS TWIST] 

TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK 
TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW 
DID YOU REALLY THINK 
THAT THERE WOULD BE AN EVER AFTER 

DO YOU THINK I'M SCARED 
TELL ME DOES IT SHOW 
WHEN INSIDE THIS DEAFNESS 
I CAN ALWAYS HEAR HIS WHISPERING 

[TOWARDS GHOSTS] 

THERE COMES A TIME YOU DECIDE 
WHAT FROM YOUR LIFE WILL BE REAL 
WHAT SCARS YOU WILL KEEP ALIVE 
WHAT YOU ARE WILLING TO HEAL 

BUT CAN I GAMBLE THIS NIGHT 
WITH EVERYTHING THAT I AM 
AND CAN I ERASE MY LIFE 
OR DO I STAY HERE AND BE DAMNED 

[TOWARDS TWIST] 

TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK 
TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW 
DID YOU REALLY THINK 
THAT THERE WOULD BE AN EVER AFTER 

DO YOU THINK I'M SCARED 
TELL ME DOES IT SHOW 
WHEN INSIDE THIS DEAFNESS 
I CAN ALWAYS HEAR HIS LAUGHTER 

I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M THINKING 
BECAUSE ALL THAT I SEE 
IS HIS FACE GRINNING 
MEPHISTOPHELES 

I NEED TO FIND AN ANSWER 
FOR THIS ONE CAN NOT BE 
WITHIN THE WORDS OF MEPHISTOPHELES 

[I] 

DON'T NEED THIS PATH BEFORE ME 
DON'T NEED FORGOTTEN GLORY 
DON'T NEED THESE THREATS OF VIOLENCE 
DON'T NEED ETERNAL SILENCE 

DON'T NEED THESE MIDNIGHT VISIONS 
DON'T NEED TO MAKE DECISIONS 
DON'T NEED TO BE UNCERTAIN 
DON'T NEED THIS FINAL CURTAIN 

[II] 

SOMEWHERE OUT THERE 
HE STILL GAZES 
AS I WANDER THROUGH HIS MAZES 

DEATH AND LIFE HERE 
TRUTH OR LIES 
EVERY THOUGHT IS WELL DISGUISED 

[III] 

NOW 
IT IS TOO LATE 
THIS PATH TO TAKE 
DON'T WANT TO LOSE MY LIFE THIS WAY 

MEDUSA DREAMS 
THE DEAD STILL SCREAM 
DON'T WANT TO SEE MY LIFE BETRAYED 

[IV] 

ALL THESE THINGS ARE NOW BEFORE ME 
ENDLESS DEATH OR TIMELESS GLORY 
ON THIS NIGHT OF GHOSTS RETURNING 
TO THE LIGHT OF BRIDGES BURNING 

NOW IT IS TOO LATE 
THIS PATH TO TAKE 
DON'T WANT TO SEE MY LIFE BE...(TRAYED) 

[TOWARDS TWIST] 

TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK 
TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW 
DID YOU REALLY THINK 
THAT THERE WOULD BE AN EVER AFTER 

DO YOU THINK I'M SCARED 
TELL ME DOES IT SHOW 
WHEN INSIDE THIS DEAFNESS 
I CAN ALWAYS HEAR HIS LAUGHTER 

I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M THINKING 
BECAUSE ALL THAT I SEE 
IS HIS FACE GRINNING 
MEPHISTOPHELES 

I NEED TO FIND AN ANSWER 
FOR THIS ONE CANNOT BE 
WITHIN THE WORDS OF MEPHISTOPHELES 

THE COST OF PATIENCE 
WHEN THERE'S NO TIME BEFORE ME 
OF HESITATION 
ALL FOR THIS TWISTED GLORY 

AND MY SALVATION 
THE COST OF HOW IT'S GOTTEN 
THE COST OF WHAT'S GAINED 
ALL FORGOTTEN 
ALL FORGOTTEN 

[When Mephistopheles returns to find his offer refused, he quickly replaces it with another. If Beethoven will only give him the un-released Tenth Symphony (which no one else has heard, so he reasons it will never be missed) he will return the maestro's soul. Beethoven agonizes once more. The ghost of Mozart appears and tells him that it is the greatest musical piece ever created; it is the voice of God, and he cannot allow it to be destroyed. As the apparition of Mozart fades, he once again decides that he is unable to destroy this music.] 

[In a final desperate attempt to obtain the Tenth Symphony, Mephistopheles points out through a window to a child sleeping in the gutter. He tells the old man that he owns this child's life and in great detail lists all the horrors and suffering that she will experience in her short existence.]
