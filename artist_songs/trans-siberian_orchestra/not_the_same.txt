I heard a note
In the dark
Where it slipped into my mind
And somehow still remains

Time comes and goes
Ebbs and flows
And somehow that single note
Still rings on and sustains

For I need someone
Not just anyone
For when all is said and done
Anyone
Anyone
Else
Is not the same

There was a soul in the dark
And it flies across the night
Towards a far distant flame

Cross forest and streets, every beat
Keeps it moving towards a goal
It may never obtain

For it needs someone
Not just anyone
For when all is said and done
Anyone
Anyone
Else
Is not the same

You were the hope that I kept
Secretly inside and by
My whole life it was framed

Some never saw or suspected
That it was there and I
All alone knew your name

For we need someone
Not just anyone
For when all is said and done
Anyone
Anyone
Else
Is not the same
