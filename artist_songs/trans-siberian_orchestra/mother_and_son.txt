[Mother]
Remember what Confucius taught,
Always be kind.
[Son]
Yes, Mother.
[Mother]
Always help the weak and the old.
[Son]
Yes, Mother.  I understand.
[Mother]
And always help those less fortunate than yourself
[Son]
Yes, mother.  Always.

[A jet passes by in the distance and the apparition of his mother fades away.
The child turns towards Tran-Do in a non-judgmental but puzzled voice.]

[Son]
How did I become you?
