[Erasmus]

Late in summer
Staring out the window
Only seven
Tell me what could she know
The world would never understand
But they don't see what she still can
What does she see
What does she know
And must she ever just let go
As childhood dreams
Childhood dreams

What is childhood
Something we remember
Rarely
Barely
Sometimes in Decembers
But then it's known to catch our
Eye
And dare us all to
Once more try
And with a childhood faith believe
And that magic to retrieve
As childhood dreams

Childhood dreams
Childhood

Dreams

Softly
Fading
Tell me where the years go
I am aging
But she does not think so
Her world of possibilities
As far as childhood
Eyes can see
And must one day
She just decide
To step off of this
Childhood ride
As childhood dreams
Childhood dreams

Only seven as she
Sits and wonders
Late at night as
The world it slumbers
But suddenly inside the dark
She sees the magic
Of the sparks
And so she knows
She must go down
To see this world
That she has found
As childhood dreams
