Christmas time in the middle of a city 
Seeking its salvation 
With every string of lights 
That suddenly appears 

Children stare with new found wonder 
No one dares to break the trance 
Every wish is carefully numbered 
And God has granted all a second chance 
This day 

And all at once 
The dream's begun 
And as we mark the old year's passing 
Strangers greet 
On every street 
And suddenly there's goodwill everywhere 
There's Christmas in the air 

On this night 
To this light 
We see it all again 
On this night 
To this light 
We see it all again 

On this night 
To this light 
We see it all again 
On this night 
To this light 
We see it all again 
All again 

On this winter night 
We still wait for you 

And now the time has come 
When all the world is one 
And as we mark the old year's passing 
Strangers greet 
On every street 
And suddenly there's goodwill everywhere 
There's Christmas in the air 

There comes a time when we're on our own 
Some times in life such a thing must be 
But such a thing should not be known 
This night 
This night 
This night 

And now the time has come 
And now the time has come 
And now the time has come 
And now the time has come 
And now the time has come 

And all the world is one 
And as we mark the old year's passing 
Strangers greet 
On every street 
And suddenly there's goodwill everywhere 
There's Christmas in the air 

THE FINAL LETTER THAT SHE READ 
WAS FROM A YOUNGER MAN 
IT CAME WITH A JOURNAL 
THAT WAS ALL WRITTEN BY HAND 

HE HAD DONE SOMETHING SO WRONG IN LIFE 
THAT HE NO LONGER WISHED TO LIVE 
BUT ON THIS NIGHT HE HAD A DREAM 
AND FOUND THAT GOD FORGIVES 

IF WE TRULY REGRET HOW OTHERS WE HAVE HUNT 
HE WILL UNDERSTAND 
SO HE TOOK THE MESSAGE FROM THIS NIGHT 
AND BECAME A DIFFERENT MAN
