There was a cold winter night 
Where the dark went on forever 
And the world seemed like a 
Dream gone astray 

And somehow there on this night 
As the world huddled together 
There a child slept at the end of 
The day 

And he dreamed of another world 
In another time 
And another place 

Where no man 
Has to wear a sign 
Saying where he's from 
Saying what's his race 

And he wants us to believe 
This world that he sees 

What is the dream of this night 
Why does it echo forever 
Here in the cold at the end of 
This year 

And with all our different lives 
Why do we dream it together 
When at the first sign of snow it 
Appears 

When he dreamed of another world 
In another time 
And another place 

Where no man 
Has to wear a sign 
Saying where he's from 
Saying what's ris race 

And he wants us to believe 
This world that he sees 

When he dreamed of another world 
In another time 
And another place 

Where no man 
Has to wear a sign 
Saying where he's from 
Saying what's ris race 

And he wants us to believe 
This world that he sees 

When he dreamed of another world 
In another time 
And another place 

Where no man 
Has to wear a sign 
Saying where he's from 
Saying what's ris race 

And he wants us to believe 
This world that he sees 

THEN THE CHILD HEAR A CLOCK TOLLING 
FROM A DISTANT CITY TOWER 
AND SHE GAZED UP AT THE STARLIGHT 
ON THIS CHRISTMAS MIDNIGHT HOUR 

AND SHE WONDERED IF THESE STARS 
WERE ALL BUT BITS OF DREAMS 
FROM SOMEWHERE IN THE DISTAND PAST 
THAT SOMEHOW, COULD STILL BE SEEN 

AND SHE WONDERED IF HER CANDLE 
UPON THIS MAGIC NIGHT 
COULD BE SEEN BY SOMEONE FARAWAY 
AS THEIR OWN STARLIGHT
