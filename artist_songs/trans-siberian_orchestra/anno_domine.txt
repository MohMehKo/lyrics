[NARRATION]

Christmas is how
In every nation
That hope is passed
Through generations

From old to young
And sometimes i'm told
It's actually passed
From young to old

Yes, our angel had been quite impressed
With this youth that he had found
But then across the street he heard
An old familiar sound

It was a multitude of voices
From the old cathedral's choir
Singing out about this night
And the hopes that it inspires

[ANNO DOMINE]

On this night of hope and salvation
One child lies embraced in a dream
Where each man regardless of station
On this night can now be redeemed

Where every man regardless of his nation
Ancestral relations
On this night the past can fly away

And that dream we've dreamed most
That every child is held close
On this night that dream won't be betrayed

All as one
Raise your voices!
Raise your voices!
All as one
On this christmas day!

All rejoice
Raise your voices!
Raise your voices!
All rejoice
Anno domine!

On this night when no child's forgotten
No dream sleeps where he cannot see
No man here is misbegotten
And this night's dreams are still yet to be

Realizing that the past can be forgiven
The future be rewritten
On this night where every child is safe

And that dream we've dreamed most
That every child is held close
On this night that dream won't be betrayed

All as one
Raise your voices!
Raise your voices!
All as one
On this christmas day!

All rejoice
Raise your voices!
Raise your voices!
All rejoice
Anno domine!
