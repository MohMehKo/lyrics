An angel returned 
That night through the sky 
But time it was short 
He had to decide 

And so as he flew 
Back over the land 
A gift for his Lord 
Was there in his hand 

It was the glow of a light 
It was the heart of a song 
It was the tear of a child 
Where they never belonged 
It was the wish of a soul 
On an old neon light 
And the Lord smiled at him 
On that cold winter night 

Hear as they ring through the night 
Kyrie among nations 
Kyrie among nations 
Kyrie among nations 
Here the bells ring through the night 

Kyrie among nations 
Kyrie among nations 
Kyrie among nations 
Hear as they ring through the night 

Kyrie among nations 
Kyrie among nations 
Kyrie among nations 
Hear as they ring through the night 

Listen to the bells as they ring 
Listen to the message they bring 
Listen to the sound 
As they sing as one voice in the night 

Hoping that we'll all understand 
Every dream we have's in our hands 
And for every bell 
May they ring all through the night 

Kyrie among nations 
Kyrie among nations 
Kyrie among nations 
Hear as they ring through the night 

Kyrie among nations 
Kyrie among nations 
Kyrie among nations 
Here as they ring through the night 

Listen to the bells as they ring 
Listen to the message they bring 
Listen to the sound as they sing 
As one voice in the night 

Hoping that we'll all understand 
Every dream we have's in our hands 
And for every bell 
May they ring all through your life 

AND SO WITH HIS STORY OVER 
AND OUR BOTTLE NEARLY THROUGH 
I ASKED, DID THIS REALLY HAPPEN? 
HE SWORE EVERY WORD WAS TRUE 

THEN HE SAID I SEE YOU'RE PUZZLED 
FOR YOUR MIND TELLS YOU TO DOUBT ME 
THAT MY STORY CAN'T BE TRUE 
BUT YOUR HEART TELLS YOU, IT MIGHT BE 

HE THEN ASKED, DID IT ENTERTAIN ME 
AND I ADMITTED IT HAD CHARM 
THEN HE SAID PERHAPS YOU HEAVE LEARNED SOMETHING 
OR AT WORST I'VE DONE NO HARM 

THEN HE ROSE UP FROM HIS CHAIR 
AND HE SAID IT'S TIME THAT HE SHOULD LEAVE 
BYT MAY GOD KEEP AND PROTECT YOU 
THIS AND EVERY CHRISTMAS EVE 

THEN HE LEFT THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR 
AND I RAN OUT TO ASK HIM BACK 
BUT HE WAS ALREADY GONE 
AND STRANGER STILL HE LEFT NO TRACKS 

SO I WALKED BACK TO MY HOME 
RECALLING ALL I'VE HEARD AND SEEN 
AND FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE MY CHILDHOOD 
THAT NIGHT I DREAMED A CHRISTMAS DREAM 

MERRY CHRISTMAS!
