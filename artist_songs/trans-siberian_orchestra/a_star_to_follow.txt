There up in the sky a star to follow 
There up in the sky a star to follow 
There up in the sky a star to follow

All 
Await the coming of the Lord 
Await the coming of the Lord 

Await the coming of the... 

Christmas 
Lead and we'll follow 
Hope and tomorrow 
Magic and dreams 

You are all this and more now 
Childhood recalls how 
You are 
Visions and... 

Christmas 
We are your children 
You take us back when 
Ever we call 
Each year we are here waiting 
Anticipating 
As the snow starts to fall 

[1.] 
To fall... 
To fall... 
To fall... 
To fall... 

[2.] 
Merry Christmas 
Merry, Merry Christmas 
Merry Christmas 
Merry, Merry Christmas 
Merry Christmas 
Merry, Merry Christmas 
Merry Christmas 
Merry, Merry Christmas 

[simultaneously - add a new stanza each second time] 

[3.] 
Ornaments and evergreens 
With packages as yet unseen 
All wrapped in paper 
Colored bright 
Reflecting candles in the night 
With carolers and mistletoe 
And stockings all hung in a row 
Or fireplaces glowing red 
With children safely sent to bed 

[4.] 
Ring the bells, Ring the bells 
Let the churches ring the bells! 

[5.] 
Joy to the world, the Lord has come 
Let his light shine on everyone 

[All together] 
Everyone 
Everyone 
Everyone... 

Christmas lead and we'll follow... 

FROM LONDON, ROME AND PARIS 
TO BERLIN AND TOKYO 
WINTER NEVER REALLY STARTS 
UNTIL IT'S GIVEN ITS FIRST SNOW
