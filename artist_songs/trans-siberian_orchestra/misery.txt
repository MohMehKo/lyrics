[MEPHISTOPHELES] 

THERE IS A CHILD AND SHE SLEEPS IN THE GUTTER 
DON'T CLOSE YOUR EYES AND SHE'S EASY TO SEE 
SHE IS NOT YOUR CHILD 
SHE'S ALWAYS ANOTHER'S 
AND THOSE YOU ABANDON 
THEY ARE LEFT TO ME 

AND KNOW I WILL IMPALE HER LIKE A KNIFE 
LEAVE HER TWISTING DAY AFTER DAY AFTER DAY OF A VERY SHORT LIFE WITH ME 

LISTEN NOW CLOSELY AND HEAR HOW I'VE PLANNED IT 
PLEASE LET ME TELL YOU JUST HOW IT WILL BE 

SHE'LL FEEL THE PAIN BUT SHE WON'T UNDERSTAND IT 
SHE'LL THINK IT'S HER FATE 
BUT WE'LL KNOW IT'S ME 

AND KNOW I WILL IMPALE HER LIKE A KNIFE 
LEAVE HER TWISTING DAY AFTER DAY AFTER DAY OF A VERY SHORT LIFE 
WITH ME 

SO LET ME KNOW 
HAVE I BEEN CLEAR 
THAT I WILL MAGNIFY EACH CUT AND EVERY BRUISE AND EVERY SINGLE CHILDHOOD TEAR 

I'LL PICK HER SCABS 
CRIPPLE A HAND 
PUSH A FINGER IN EACH WOUND I MAKE 
NOW TELL ME THEN 
DO YOU UNDERSTAND 
YOU UNDERSTAND? 
YOU UNDERSTAND 
YOU UNDERSTAND? 
YOU UNDERSTAND 

AND KNOW I WILL IMPALE HER LIKE A KNIFE 
LEAVE HER TWISTING DAY AFTER DAY AFTER DAY OF A VERY SHORT LIFE 
WITH ME 

[If Beethoven will release to him this final musical creation, then Mephistopheles will give up all claims on the child, irrevocably removing himself and all his evil underlings from the child's life for all eternity.] 

[Beethoven immediately turns away, determined to give a firm and final no. But before the word can leave his lips he finds himself looking back out the window. He tries to convince himself that the child means nothing to him, especially when compared to the Tenth Symphony. But with every word disclaiming her, she digs deeper and deeper into his soul.]
