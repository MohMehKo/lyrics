There is an ornament 
Lost inside the night 
There on a Christmas tree 
With a thousand lights 

No one can see her 
She's standing all alone 

Somewhere she glistens where no one can see 

I don't believe I can say what had happened 
All of those words that we put into play 
No longer matter, I should have known that then 
I just know you're far away 

On this Christmas day 
On this Christmas day 
On this Christmas... 

Somewhere the wind 
Carves moments in the snow 

And if he sees her 
He never lets it show 
He just drifts behind her 
Erasing every step 

Tinsel and garland are whispered through trees 

I don't believe I can say what had happened 
All of those words that we put into play 
No longer matter, I should have known that then 
I just know you're far away 

On this Christmas day 
On this Christmas day 
On this Christmas... 

Come, Christmas 
Stay, Christmas 
Watch over her this day 
Keep her 
Protect her 
From harm now in every way 

Shelter her 
Gently 
There in your arms she'll be 
Until the day 
When you 
Bring her back home to me 

There is an ornament lost inside the night 

AFTER HE HAD HEARD THE PRAYER 
THE ANGEL GENTLY SET IT FREE 
AND FOLLOWED IT TO THE FATHER'S CHILD 
IN A FAR AWAY CITY 

AND THERE THE GIRL IN DESPERATION 
WAS SEARCHING THROUGH THE SKY 
FOR A STAR THAT SHE COULD WISH UPON 
BUT STARS WERE IN SHORT SUPPLY 

AND THE ONLY LIGHT THAT SHE COULD SEE 
THERE SHINING ALL ALONE 
WAS A NEON SIGN ON AN OLD BAR 
AND SO ON THIS, SHE WISHED SHE WAS HOME
