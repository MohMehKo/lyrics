[YOUNG BEETHOVEN] 

SINCE I WAS A CHILD 
I'VE SEEN HER IN A DREAM 
A CAPTURED FAIRY TALE 
THAT ECHOES CROSS MY LIFE 

AND THOUGH I'VE COURTED HER 
SHE'S ALWAYS STAYED UNSEEN 
NOW ALL AT ONCE SHE 
GLITTERS IN THE NIGHT 

BUT THAT WAS YESTERDAY 
AND THAT ALL WAS BEFORE 
WHEN SHE WAS FAR AWAY 
A SILHOUETTE OF DREAMS 

BUT OTHERS WHISPERED 
THAT SHE WAS SO MUCH MORE 
AND SUDDENLY I NOW 
KNOW WHAT THEY MEAN 

DREAMS CHANGE 
YEARS STRAIN 
LOST ILLUSIONS 
LAST STANDS 
GOD'S HAND 
ABSOLUTION 
FOUND 

FAIRY TALE SINS 
VISIONS BY GRIMM 
ALL FORGIVEN 
LIVES SPENT IN VAIN 
NEVER RECLAIMED 
TAKE THEIR FINAL BOWS 

PICTURES AND WORDS 
VISIONS ABSURD 
MADDENED POETS 
ALL WITHIN SIGHT 
FAILURES IN LIFE 
WHO'LL NEVER KNOW IT 
LAZARUS CRIES 
THERE IN HIS EYES 
HOPE HAS RISEN 
DEPTH AND FACADE 
ALL BEFORE ME NOW 

[Together Fate and Beethoven watch the composer as a young man meeting his greatest idol, Mozart.]
