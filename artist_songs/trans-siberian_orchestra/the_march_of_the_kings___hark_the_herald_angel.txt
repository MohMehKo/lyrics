[Instrumental] 

MIXED AMONG THE LETTERS 
WAS A YOUNG BOY'S SCHOOL REPORT 
ABOUT THE THREE WISE MEN 
AND HOT THEY WERE NEARLY CAUGHT 

NOW MANY BOOKS HAVE BEEN WRITTEN 
ABOUT WHAT HAD HAPPENED ON THAT NIGHT 
BUT THIS REPORT WAS BASED UPON 
SOME ADDITIONAL INSIGHT 

IT SEEMS HIS UNCLE HAD COME BY 
EACH CHRISTMAS WITHOUT FAIL 
AND CLAIMED TO KNOW WHAT REALLY HAPPENED 
IN THAT CLASSIC CHRISTMAS TALE
