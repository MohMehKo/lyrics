[Greek Chorus]

Here
Believe
A night
Enchanted
Seen

Here
The hopes of Gods are planted
Dream
Remember
Remember
All we do not see

Surrendered
Surrendered
All we wished to be

Lost and forgotten
Our Akhenaten
Body and spirit
No-one can hear it
Lost
In
Eternity

Forever
Hear us
Forever
Hear us
Forever
Hear us
Forever
Where our hopes have never ceased 
To be

Death will embrace us
Hold and encase us
Time may deface us
Will God retrace us

Time speaks through seasons
God speaks through reason
Kindness compassion
Not random fashions

Hear
Yet to be
Hear
Yet to be
Hear
Yet to

[Cassandra]

Child of the night
Dreams dare alight
Anywhere your heart does wander
Know that they will walk with thee
Each grain of sand
Falls as was planned
And within each precious moment
Are the things still yet to be

Night in its vespers
Dreams are its gestures
Stars fear no distance
Fear no distance

For they will always guard you
Throughout eternity
