He won the war, in a foreign land
That was no hero, that was my old man
And he came back home, where he met his wife
And he raised his kids, while he made a life
Now he never preached, though he always knew
And we watched him close, just to pick up clues
And sometimes late, in the dead of night
I can see him there, in the pale moon light
I am trying
And I don't know how
And I don't know when
But I'll have to tell him someday

And as for this woman, my father wed
We knew we were loved, with the words unsaid
And when we were young she taught us all to read
And then one by one, she would watch us leave

Never saw her cry, for she hid her tears
As one by one, we would disappear
But of course we'd write, and of course we'd call
Just to hear her voice, whenever we would fall

I am trying
And I don't know how
And I don't know when
But I'll have to tell her someday

So I wrote these words, and I hope they last
For the years have come, and the years have past
Think of all they gave, think of all the debt
But can't find a way, to repay them yet

For the days still come, and the debt still mount
And do words unsaid, ever really count
But sometimes still, in the dead of night
I can see them there, in the pale moon light

I am trying
And I don't know how
And I don't know when
But I'll have to tell them someday
