Cold cash
Quick dash
Don't have nothing else I can say

Cops come
Can't run
Lawyers just gotta delay

What crime?
Sunshine
Can't be anything that i did

I was used
So confused
Debts would mount
Couldn't count
But I never did nothing I hid

Gotta just lay low
Time is on my side
Let the clocks roll on
Say I can't decide
Let the clocks roll on
I have no regrets

Let the clocks roll on
Let the clocks roll on
Let the clocks roll on
Cause I'm not dead yet

Wild child
Nice style
Fashion is what ever you wear

No sin
Begins
Understanding who really cares

It's free
With a small fee
When words don't mean what they say

Call them out
Let 'em doubt
Let 'em sweat
With regret
That their game, you'll no longer play

Gotta just lay low
Time is on my side
Let the clocks roll on
Say I can't decide
Let the clocks roll on
I have no regrets

Let the clocks roll on
Let the clocks roll on
Let the clocks roll on
Cause I'm not dead yet
