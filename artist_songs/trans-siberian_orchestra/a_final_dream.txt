[FATE] 

LAY YOUR HEAD DOWN 
AND SLEEP ON MY SHOULDER 
LAY YOUR HEAD DOWN 
AND START A NEW DREAM 
AND FOR TONIGHT 
THE MOMENT IS OVER 
DRIFT IN A LULLABY 
HERE WHERE THE STARS RESIDE 
AND ANGELS ARE ALWAYS SEEN 

AND LAY YOUR HEAD DOWN 
THE STARS THEY HAVE WHISPERED 
HEAR WHAT THEY SAY 
AND KNOW THAT IT MEANS 
THE MOON IS YOUR GUIDE 
THE STARS THEY HAVE KISSED HER 
AS SHE GOES GENTLY BY 
LIGHT AS A BABY'S SIGH 
SAFE ON A FAIRY TALE STREAM 

AND START A NEW DREAM 

[With the departure of his soul the storm begins to break and a stillness settles over the room as one by one the ghosts and shadows fade away. All seems at peace until the sudden re-appearance of Twist returning through a window. He gazes about the room, a look of mischievous delight spreading across his face. Scampering over to the piano, he takes the manuscript for the Tenth Symphony and then climbing up a bookcase, carefully slips it behind a wall. Here it will remain hidden, the world blissfully unaware of its existence until that one day in the future when it will be discovered and the music will once more live again.]
