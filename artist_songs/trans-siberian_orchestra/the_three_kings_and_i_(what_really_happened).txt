O Holy night 
The stars are brightly shining 
It is the night of our dear savior's birth 

Now you all heard the story about Bethlehem 
How the child was born and the three wise men 
Heard the preacher tell it like the preacher does 
But let me tell you, children, 
That's not how it was 

Now you might ask me what I'm talking about 
But I know the part that they all left out 
Yes, I do 

Now do you hear what I said 
That Herod wanted those wise men dead 
But on that blessed evening 
My great great great great great great granddad 
He saved those kings 

Now granddad made his living 
Playing jazz you see 
But jazz wasn't big around one A.D. 
So he got himself a job in the palace band 
Where he heard about three kings 
In the desert sand 

Let me tell you children that at any time 
Three kings in the desert that's a real rare find 
Yes, it is 

But Herod heard of it too 
And when he heard his curiosity grew 
So he asked those kings to drop by 
And my great great great great great great 
Granddad 
He wondered why 

So the Magi told old Herod 
That they had come here 
To find a newborn king of kings 
Who'd heal our sins 
Then old Herod told his guards 
To follow those Magi 
And that the only king around here 
Was gonna' be him 

Then he told his soldiers as I recall 
When they found that child, to kill them all 
But granddad overheard what Herod said 
And he had to act fast or else they'd all be dead 
Yes, they would 

So granddad got to those kings 
Filled them in on the plan, told them everything 
When they heard what he had in store 
They grabbed the gold 
The frankincense 
The myrrh, the jewels 
The desert tents 
And when they found 
His plan was sound 
They followed granddad out the back door 
Yes, they did 
They followed him down 

And what a night 
It must have been 
But when God is on your side 
You kinda' know that in the end 
You're gonna win 

They traveled fast 
They traveled far 
And in the end they found 
That they were standing with the Child 
Beneath the star 

Hallelujah, Hallelujah 
Hallelujah, Hallelujah 
Hallelujah, Hallelujah 

Hallelujah, Hallelujah 
Hallelujah, Hallelujah 
Hallelujah, Hallelujah 

And so you see we've reached the end 
Of our story 
When granddad and the kings 
Reached that stable on the hill 
And while I said that 
Three kings in the desert is a rare sight 
Angels singing in the desert that's far rarer still 

Now I ain't sayin' that the bible was wrong 
But ya' see the whole tale 
Would have taken too long 
'Cause way back then in the promised land 
Every copy they sold, 
It had to be written by hand 

And granddad lived a long life 
Stayed friends with those kings 
And found a good wife 
And eventually I came along 
But that my children 
That my children 
That's another song 

THE NEXT LETTER INCLUDED A RECEIPT 
FOR ONE TOY STUFFED BEAR 
DONATING IT TO A SMALL THRIFT SHOP 
BUT SOMEHOW IT WAS LEFT THERE 

FOR ATTICS HAVE THEIR SECRETS 
AND TOYS WILL HAVE THEIRS, TOO 
LIKE WHO ONCE HELD OR LOVED THEM 
WHEN THEY LAST WERE NEW 

WHETHER THEY WERE MADE OF METAL 
OR THEY WERE COTTON STUFFED 
OF HOW THEY HAD BEEN LEFT HERE 
WHEN THEY WERE NOT ENOUGH 

AND SO IT'S HERE THAT THEY MUST WAIT 
BETWEEN REALITY AND DREAM 
HOPING ALL WILL BE REMEMBERED 
AND THAT ALL CAN BE REDEEMED 

THEN IN THE SOUND OF THE WIND 
WHISTLING THROUGH A DOOR 
SHE THOUGHT SHE HEARD THE SOUND OF CHILDREN 
THAT HAD HELD THIS TOY BEFORE 

AND SHE THEN THOUGHT TO HERSELF 
AS SHE NOW HELD IT IN HER HAND 
THAT NO ONE COULD SAVE ALL THE WORLD 
BUT WE SHOULD SAVE WHO WE CAN 

SO SHE PLACED IT NEAR HER CANDLE 
FOR SHE HAD DECIDED IN HER MIND 
THAT WHEN SHE LEFT THIS ATTIC 
HE WOULD NOT BE LEFT BEHIND
