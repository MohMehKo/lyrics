Deep inside this Christmas Eve 
Watching as the hours leave 
Gently drifting in the air 
Shadows of an angel's share 

Christmas lights 
On Christmas nights 
With peace for every nation 
Stable scenes 
And evergreens 
With snow still glistening 

Angels grace 
This humble place 
With hopes of our salvation 
Christmas cards 
And snow filled yards 
And children wondering 

Rejoice 
All awaken 
Rejoice 
Quickly hasten 
Rejoice 
For the newborn king 

Rejoice 
For the vision 
Rejoice 
He has given 
Hear the choirs as they sing 

Scrooge returns 
To once more learn 
That Christmas ghosts conspire 

To redeem 
His soul it seems 
But still he hesitates 

To believe 
He's not deceived 
Until this night inspires 
Him to find 
That at this time 
It never is too late 

Rejoice 
All awaken 
Rejoice 
Quickly hasten 
Rejoice 
For the newborn king 

Rejoice 
For the vision 
Rejoice 
He has given 
Hear the choirs as they sing 
And sing 
And sing 
And sing and sing and sing 

Winter dreams 
Her endless scenes 
In endless combinations 
To embrace 
This world of faith 
This world that we now see 

Every year 
It returns here 
With all its variations 
And as the day 

It fades away 
And we once more find that... 

Once again the promise kept 
One by one the angels slept 
So we leave this night in peace 
And the world in gentle sleep 

WHEN SHE FINISHED THAT LAST LETTER 
FROM THAT LITTLE STACK 
SHE PUT EACH ONE IT ITS ENVELOPE 
AND CAREFULLY PUT THEM BACK 

THEN SHE SAT AND THOUGHT QUITE CAREFULLY 
ABOUT ALL SHE HAD LEARNED 
REALIZING THAT HER BELIEF IN THIS NIGHT 
HAD COMPLETELY RETURNED 

FOR IF ALL THESE GROWNUPS SHE HAD READ 
HAD IN THIS NIGHT BELIEVED 
IF COULD NOT BE POSSIBLE 
THAT THEY ALL HAD BEEN DECEIVED 

AND SHE MARVELED HOT THOUGH EVERY LETTER 
WAS SIGNED WITH A DIFFERENT NAME 
THAT IN THE END IT SEEMED THAT ALL 
THEIR WISHES WERE THE SAME 

THAT THE LIGHT THAT REACHED OUR LIVES 
FROM THAT DISTANT CHRISTMAS STAR 
WOULD MAKE US, IF NOT PERFECT 
THEN PERHAPS BETTER THAN WHO WE ARE 

AND SUDDENLY SHE NOTICED 
THAT THERE WAS A PRESENT THERE 
HE MUST HAVE COME AND LEFT IT 
WHEN SHE HAD GONE DOWN THE STAIRS 

THEN SHE REALIZED AS FOR THAT CHIMNEY 
SHE NEEDN'T HAVE WORRIED AFTER ALL 
FOR CHRISTMAS SHE HAD FOUNG THIS NIGHT 
COULD NOT BE STOPPED BY WALLS 

COULD NOT BE STOPPED BY DISTANCE 
COULD NOT BE STOPPED BY TIME 
AND IF ONE LIVED A THOUSAND YEARS 
IT WOULD STILL BE THERE TO FIND 

NOW SOME WILL SAY THAT ALL THESE GIFTS 
WERE LEFT BY HER FATHER OR HER MOTHER 
BUT I FOR ONE, WILL ALWAYS SUSPECT 
IT COULD HAVE BEEN ANOTHER 

AND BEFORE SHE WENT BACK DOWN THE STAIRS 
WITH HER FADING CANDLELIGHT 
SHE FOUND SOME PAPER AND WROTE DOWN 
ALL THAT HAD OCCURED THAT NIGHT 

AND SOMETIME ON SOME DISTANT NIGHT 
WE REALLY CAN'T SAY WHEN 
SOMEONE WILL READ THAT LETTER 
AND THIS NIGHT WILL LIVE AGAIN 

AND SO OUR STORY'S OVER 
AND THE CHILD RETURNED TO BED 
TO DREAM ABOUT THIS MAGIC NIGHT 
AND WHERE IT ALL HAD LED 

AND THE ANGEL WHO HAD HEARD HER THOUGHTS 
ABOUT WHAT SHE LEARNED 
NOW REALIZED THAT HIS WAS DONE 
AND IT WAS TIME HE SHOULD RETURN 

AND TAKING BACK ALL HE HAD THOUGHT 
HE RETURNED JUST IN TIME 
TO APPEAR BEFORE HIS LORD 
AND TELL HIM WHAT HE HAD LEFT BEHIND 
THERE WERE TWO SOULS REUNITED 
ON A SNOW BLESSED CHRISTMAS EVE 
AND SLEEPING SAFELY IN HER BED 
WAS THE CHILD WHO STILL BELIEVED 

AND ONCE AGAIN THE LORD SMILED DOWN 
FROM HIS HEAVENLY THRONE 
AND TOOK THE ANGEL INTO HIS HEART 
AND WHISPERED, WELCOME HOME 

AND MAY YOU ALSO HEAR THOSE WORDS 
ALL THROUGH YOUR LIFE 
BUT MAY YOU HEAR THEM MOST OF ALL 
ON EVERY CHRISTMAS NIGHT 

MERRY CHRISTMAS! 

[Post Script]

AND THE MOST MAGICAL THING 
ABOUT THIS NIGHT WE WILL NOW REITERATE 
THAT NO MATTER WHERE YOU ARE IN LIFE 
IT NEVER IS TOO LATE
