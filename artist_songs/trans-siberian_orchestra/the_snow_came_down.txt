A railway station 
On a long forgotten line 
No destination 
But it always leaves on time 

He buys his ticket 
As the train prepares to leave 
Don't want to miss it 
On this night Christmas Eve 

He stared into the night no expectations 
He watched the world go by without a sound 
He saw the city lights arrive and fade away 
While all that night 
All that night 
The snow came down 

No conversation 
As the snow fell from the sky 
His consolation 
That the world is well disguised 

He stared into the night no expectations 
He watched the world go by without a sound 
He saw the city lights arrive and fade away 
While all that night 
All that night 
The snow came down 

He stared into the night, no expectations 
But in his heart he wanted to believe 
That somehow someone would be waiting there 
Upon this Christmas Eve 

And when his train it pulled into that station 
He saw there was a single pair of tracks 
Within the snow and leading to that 
Station door 
And he followed those steps back 

And on this night of our salvation 
Where dreams that have been lost 
Can there be found 
They walked away together 
On that Christmas Eve 
While all that night 
All that night 
The snow came down 

IN THIS LAST SEASON OF THE YEAR 
THIS SEASON THAT WE TRUST 
IT'S NOT ONLY IMPORTANT TO KNOW FOR WHOM WE WAIT 
BUT TO KNOW WHO WAITS FOR US 

AND AS THEY WALKED HOME TOGETHER 
TO THE LIGHT OF CHRISTMAS TREES 
THEY COULD NOT HELP BUT WONDER 
ABOUT HOW THIS NIGHT CAME TO BE 

WHILE BACK INSIDE THE ATTIC 
THE GIRL SAW THEM WALKING THROUGH THE SNOW 
AND SHE SMILED WITH A CHILD'S DELIGHT 
THINKING HOW THEY WOULD NEVER KNOW 

AND SUDDENLY SHE REALIZED 
BENEATH THIS NIGHT OF STARS 
SOMETIMES CHRISTMAS USES ITS OWN HANDS 
AND SOMETIMES IT USES OURS
