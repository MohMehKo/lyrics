Last night dreamt I was falling
A new born through the years
Long before I knew sorrow
Long before I knew fear

I tried not to awaken
Clung to this childhood's sleep
Afraid all might be taken
But sleep like childhoods cease

Childhoods cease

A street of all illusions
That were so real to me
But are they true illusions
If they are all you see

The stars keep all our secrets
Safe in the night they dwell
And after time eternal
They all still listen well

Where our hopes had somehow grown
Something I had never known
Somehow they had crossed the dark unnoticed

Far enough to wish upon
Then return and carry on
Stars will whisper to the night
Behold this

Life is real
But so our ghost
Side by side
Along times coast
And to others
We walk on unnoticed

Eternity
Itself has shores
We will meet
Again once more
Of all there is
To learn in life

Please know this
I will be there
Childhoods sleep
Childhood sleeps

I will be
