[THERESA] 

LOST IN YOUR DARK 
I SEE YOU THERE 
WHAT DO YOU SEE BEYOND YOUR STARE 
AND YOU BELIEVE THAT NO ONE ELSE CAN KNOW 

WHAT IS THIS THING YOU KEEP INSIDE 
OUT OF THE LIGHT AND WRAPPED IN PRIDE 
ALWAYS AFRAID THAT ONE DAY IT WILL SHOW 

I'LL KEEP YOUR SECRETS 
I'LL HOLD YOUR GROUND 
AND WHEN THE DARKNESS STARTS TO FALL 
I'LL BE AROUND THERE WAITING 
WHEN DREAMS ARE FADING 
AND FRIENDS ARE DISTANT AND FEW 

KNOW AT THAT MOMENT I'LL BE THERE WITH YOU 
WHAT ARE THESE VOICES THAT YOU HEAR 
ARE THEY TOO FAR OR FAR TOO NEAR 
WHAT ARE THESE THINGS THAT ECHO FROM THE PAST 

WHO ARE THESE GHOSTS YOU SEE AT NIGHT 
THERE IN THE SHADOWS OF YOUR LIFE 
THEY ONLY LIVE BY THE LIGHT YOU CAST 

I'LL KEEP YOUR SECRETS 
I'LL HOLD YOUR GROUND 
AND WHEN THE DARKNESS STARTS TO FALL 
I'LL BE AROUND THERE WAITING 
WHEN DREAMS ARE FADING 
AND FRIENDS ARE DISTANT AND FEW 

KNOW AT THAT MOMENT I'LL BE THERE WITH YOU 

I'LL BE AROUND 
WHEN THERE'S NO REASON LEFT TO CARRY ON 
AND EVERY DREAM YOU'VE EVER HAD IS GONE 
AND THE DARK IS DEEP AND BLACK WITHOUT A SOUND 
AND EVERY STAR HAS BEEN DRAGGED TO THE GROUND 
KNOW AT THAT MOMENT I WILL BE AROUND 
KNOW AT THAT MOMENT I WILL BE AROUND 

[Beethoven says to Fate that it is now clear to him that it was his deafness that was the cause of all his unhappiness. "Remove this infirmity and my whole life will turn out right. If I had not gone deaf I would still have been able to perform live and Theresa and I would have had a life together."] 

[Fate assures him that it can be done but once again feels she must warn him of the consequences. She points out that before his deafness his career was more concentrated on live performance than on composing. The Muses of music had always been speaking to him but it was only after he became deaf that he could clearly hear their voices. "Your live performances were brilliant but they lasted but a moment, while your compositions will echo forever."] 

[She then shows Beethoven himself slipping deeper and deeper into his pit of total silence, but all the while the Muses continue to whisper in his ear.]
