[Erasmus]

Sleep
Don't turn away
You are the safest way into
Tomorrow

Dreams
If you will stay
Or at least the best parts let us
Borrow

Days are counted 'til they're gone
Nights are meant to carry on
Morpheus is at your side
Offering the wings to fly
And be there

Free from Earth to sail across this
Night
Where
Stars are all eternal and the mind
Dares
The evening signs
So close your eyes
And tell me what you see

Sleep
Don't turn away
You are the safest way into
Tomorrow

Dreams if you will stay
And carefully erase the sorrows

Letting sleep embrace its task
Placing sadness in the past
Morpheus is at your side
Offering the wings to fly
And be there

Free from Earth to sail across this
Night
Where
Stars are all eternal and the mind
Dares
So close your eyes
And tell me what you see

Be there
Be there
Be there
Be there now

The evening sighs
So close your eyes
And tell me what you see
