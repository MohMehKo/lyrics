[NARRATION]

Now all that had occurred here this night 
The angel had clearly seen 
Not unlike an old fashioned movie 
Upon a silvered screen 
That borders on the edge of a 
Forgotten childhood dream 

And from all that he had witnessed 
He thought his answer he had found 
And once more unfolded his wings 
And left earth's solid ground 

With every sweep of those wings 
Across time and space he soared 
Until he found himself standing 
Back in heaven, before his lord 

And he told his lord the name of the father's son 
But then he hesitated 
Like a child in school unsure of his answer 
But the lord, he patiently waited 

Then the angel added the names 
Of the parishioners at the church 
The musicians, the storyteller 
The operator and the hospital nurse 

Eventually there was hardly a person 
That the angel had missed 
And then at the very end he placed 
The father's name, also on that list 

That anyone could reflect his lord's son 
Was now the angel's view 
All it took was to follow the simple word's of his son 
"to do unto others, as you would have others do unto you" 

Then the lord smiled at his angel 
And said, "you have done more than your task 
It's a gift that eyes rarely have 
That can see further than they are asked." 

And so this night is ending 
So close to where it did start 
As the angel slept deep that night 
Within his lord's own heart 

For hope never dies 
At worst it only sleeps 
And all we surrender 
Christmas safely keeps 

Through the cold winter nights 
Of the longest decembers 
Till here by starlight 
We begin to remember 

That in the very end 
The message christmas is sending 
Is that it is never too late 
To change any life's ending 

[The end]

[After the end or (the next day)]

So christmas eve had come and past 
But not so christmas day 
And thus it is, we add a final act 
Onto our yearly play 

A taxicab pulled up to the grand hotel, 
That morning somewhere around eight 
And the father with his son got out 
And asked the driver, to please wait 

Then the father asked the clerk if he could speak 
To the couple in room twelve twenty-four 
Adding he did not know the couple's name 
But had met their child the night before 

The clerk answered most politely 
That he would like to fulfill his wish 
But the room number twelve twenty-four 
In this hotel, did not exist 

The father then described the little girl 
Her age and dress as well 
But the clerk said there had been no children there at all that week 
Was he sure he had the right hotel? 

So the father started wondering 
If in the cold winter's air 
He had somehow imagined the entire event 
But then he realized, he didn't care 

The only thing that mattered 
When all was said and done 
Was that he was reunited 
With his one and only son 

And when they got back into their cab 
He heard a ripping sound 
As the contents of his wife's folder 
Spilled out onto the ground 

As he rushed to pick it all up 
He grabbed the picture first 
Of him and his wife at the age nineteen 
Long before she had given birth 

And on the back he saw a poem he had written to her 
Years before they had wed 
When they were young, their lives just begun 
And here is what it said, 

"if a single tear fell from your eyes into the ocean 
And then washed up on some far and distant shore 
I would still recognize that teardrop 
For in the end that tear would still be yours" 

And then he saw another picture 
That he had never seen before 
Of a little girl in a russian styled coat 
Standing with her parents, in front of their store 

The little girl he saw there 
He now knew was a childhood picture of his wife 
But it was also a picture of the little girl 
He had just met on the previous night 

And he realized that those who love 
Death cannot divide 
It only provides an extra soul 
To watch over us from the other side 

And together they returned 
Back to the father's home 
And shared the best christmas 
That either of them had ever known 

And somewhere across eternity 
Which in distance cannot be measured 
The mother looked down upon them both 
And their happiness she treasured 

And later on late that night 
When her son was drifting off to sleep 
A tear once more rolled from her eyes 
And trailed across her cheek 

But this one was a tear of joy 
That she could not keep inside 
And this time she followed it through eternity 
Across the great divide 

Till it landed by another joyful tear 
That her husband had just wept 
And there unseen she joined him 
In the silent vigil that he kept 

For we are all born mortal 
Like stars and candlelight 
And all that really matters 
Is what we do before we fall asleep each night 

[CHRISTMAS CANON ROCK]

This night 
We pray 
Our lives will show 

This dream he had 
Each child 
Still knows 

We are waiting 
We have not forgotten 

On this night 
On this night 
On this night 
On this very christmas night
