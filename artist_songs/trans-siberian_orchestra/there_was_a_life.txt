[Tran-Do]

There was a life
Was there before
But somehow here upon this night
It now means more

And all those words
She tried to say
I've now forgotten
Or they've somehow slipped away

And in this darkness
Is there salvation
Is there forgiveness
For hesitation

Can someone tell me
Can someone say when
The writer of this story
Will just tell us how it all will end

And somewhere on this night
There's a wave on the ocean
That crashes on shores
Where no one can see

The tides and the currents
Decide every motion
From where they are now
To where they will be

It cradles them all
For they all are its children
If one drop disappears
It is instantly missed

And after each wave
Has joined up with the shoreline
It returns to the sea
For that is its one wish

There was a light
Was there before
But in the darkness of this night
It now means more

To be so close
To be so near
To see the water there within
A young child's tear

And in our blindness
Do we move onward
And cling to the lies
That we have harbored

We could not admit
We were mistaken
But if we don't do it now
Dear God could you please come
Down here
And tell me when

And somewhere on this night
There's a wave on the ocean
That crashes on shores
Where no one can see

The tides and the currents
Decide every motion
From where they are now
To where they will be

It cradles them all
For they all are its children
If one drop disappears
It is instantly missed

And after each wave
Has joined up with the shoreline
It returns to the sea
For that is its one wish

In the dead of the night
Tell me what do you see
Will you close your eyes child
And just listen to me

And remember this now
Hear these words that I say
As your story appears
At the end of the day

For my meeting with death
Though it has been delayed
I have run my hands over
The end of his blade

Though the cut wasn't fatal
Even though it was deep
Well that wound's never healed
And the blood it still seeps

Are you scared of your life
Are you scared of your death
Though that day will arrive
Well it hasn't come yet

For the days turn to months
And the months turn to years
As I see them all now
Through a prism of tears
But don't fear tomorrow
And don't fear the night
It's where God repairs sorrows
That enter your life

The remains of your life
The remains of the day
Well protect every hour
Don't give them away

For each evening we sleep
And each morning we arise
But you're not the same man
That's the way it's devised

For there're parts of yourself
The soul decides to keep
And there're parts of yourself
That the soul does release

With some changes so small
That they cannot be seen
But death is like sleep
With a longer dream

Are you scared of your life
Are you scared of your death
Though that day will arrive
Well it hasn't come yet
As for all those mistakes
That you've made in your life
Must they stay as they are
Or can we make them right

On this night take my hand
Keep me near keep me close
And if I should die first
Could I not be your ghost

But if later in life
We should happen to meet
Would you keep me so near
You could hear my heartbeat

There are reasons to live
There are reasons to die
But the end's not the end
While you're still alive

Alive

Alive

While you're still a...

There was a life
Was there before
