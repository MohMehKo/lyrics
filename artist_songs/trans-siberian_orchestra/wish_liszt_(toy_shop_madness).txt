[NARRATION]

Now the old man was nearing a toy shop 
Where he could hear a music box kind of sound 
From a miniature carousel with its miniature horses 
All circling faithfully around 

And a little girl wearing a russian styled coat 
Was carefully looking inside 
At the horses and knights and the trains with their lights 
While she was imagining they all were alive 

For at this time a child will dare 
To see what is perhaps not there 
Or at least not there to adult eyes 
Who have forgotten how to fantasize 

[WISH LISZT (TOY SHOP MADNESS)]
