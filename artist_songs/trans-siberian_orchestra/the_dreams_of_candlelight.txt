[THERESA] 

COULD THIS NIGHT IT LAST FOREVER 
EVERY MOMENT HELD TOGETHER 
AS IF IN A PERFECT TRANCE 
AND SUCH A THING COULD BE 

NO ONE ELSE WOULD UNDERSTAND IT 
WE WOULD KNOW THE GODS HAD PLANNED IT 
AND FOR SUCH A NIGHT AS THIS 
THAT THEY GAVE MEMORY 

AND WE WOULD LIVE INSIDE THIS NIGHT 
WITHIN THE DREAMS OF CANDLELIGHT 
IF YOU WOULD BRING THIS WISH TO LIFE 
AND SPEND THIS NIGHT WITH ME 

COULD THIS MOMENT LAST FOREVER 
AND THIS DREAM OUR ONE ENDEAVOR 
IF THE STARS WOULD JUST ENCHANT 
AND TIME WOULD THEN AGREE 

EVERY MOMENT OF TOMORROW 
FROM THIS EVENING WE WOULD BORROW 
IF THIS WISH THE STARS WOULD GRANT 
AND GENTLY OVERSEE 

AND WE WOULD LIVE INSIDE THIS NIGHT 
WITHIN THE DREAMS OF CANDLELIGHT 
IF YOU WOULD BRING THIS WISH TO LIFE 
AND SPEND THIS NIGHT WITH ME 

[Beethoven tells Fate that this was the happiest moment of his life. When she asks why did it have to end he replies, "Because it had to."] 

[Fate again inquires, "Why?"] 

["No woman wants to spend her life with a deaf musician, let alone a lady of such high station and beauty."] 

[Fate takes them to Beethoven's parlor in 1801. There they see the composer slumped over the piano. He is going deaf and he realizes that it is irreversible. As far as he is concerned, his life is over.]
