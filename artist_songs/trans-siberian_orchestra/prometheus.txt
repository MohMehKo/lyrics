There comes a time to decide
There comes a time to choose sides
For in a world in the dark
A single thought is a spark

That ignites
And it burns
As it spread across the night
It detects
And protects
As its light it calls forth

Einstein and Edison
Tesla and Eddington
Prometheus was the one
That first showed us

How far minds could see
Changing destinies
Nothing has to be
If we wish it

There comes a time to decide
Do we unite or divide
And if the world's blind to sparks
To be the voice in the
Dark
