If he went there and saw his son 
What words could he possibly say 
Would his own child recognize him 
And if he did, would he turn away?

Perhaps to only watch it die 
And standing there in this man's place 
I wonder, would you or i?

Any hope can be smothered 
So before it was dead, to the first prayer he had said 
The angel quickly added another
