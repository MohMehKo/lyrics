[Drug Dealer]

Lines
Of a tale
Cut in the face of a crowd
Sentenced no bail

There
In the night
Deep in the back
Through the black
Beckons a life

Time
Moving in a straight line
But then at a whim
A change in the wind
A story begins in its mind

For deep in her eyes
Beneath the lies
Of the dark
Leaving marks

Sparks

She
Has been steeled
Standing there looking so tight
Taut and high-heeled

One
Of a kind
The kind of a girl
That only a dream
Could design

Time
Seen through glasses of wine
Never reveals
The why or the when
How this story will end
As you find

That deep in her eyes
Beneath the lies
Of the dark
Leaving marks

Sparks

Come on
Conjure up a reason for living
Take me round
And around
And around
And around
And again

Come on
Do it in the name of living
For if not tonight
Tell me when

For if not tonight
Tell me when
Ahhhhh

Hearts
Can confuse
That messed up bundle of nerves
That tends to bruise

Still
Lay it bare
It's better to bleed than to need
And never have dared

Chance
A move based on a glance
A move based on no more than feel
In this unreal circumstance

For deep in her eyes
Beneath the lies of the dark
Leaving marks
Sparks
