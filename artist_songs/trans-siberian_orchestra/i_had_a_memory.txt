Time, could you please help me
I had a memory
I somehow lost in the past

Christmas but glittering
And I've been wondering
Do you hear the echoes it cast

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah, ujah, ujah, Lord

Time it would not divide
What the heart keeps inside
Words that don't try to deceive

And on this Christmas night
Better by candelight
To trust like a young child believes

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah, ujah, ujah, Lord

Time it would not divide
What the heart keeps inside
Words that don't try to deceive

Believe
Believe
Believe
Oh Lord

Time could you please help me
I had a memory
I somehow lost in the past
