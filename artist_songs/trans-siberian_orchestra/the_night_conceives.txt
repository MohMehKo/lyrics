The sun goes down
The light it leaves
The mind can't imagine
What the night conceives

The siren wails
She flirts, she calls
Promise nothing
But she offers all

She's the chambered round
In the magazine
She's the first one out
But the exit's clean

When she first walks by
You feel drained and bled
With those arctic eyes
As she looked at me and said

She said

Oh yeah

When she appears
Always center stage
But when the spotlight comes
You know she'll disengage

With a feline smile
And a wink that's sin
Can't say where she goes
Only where she's been

She's the chambered round
In the magazine
She's the first one out
But the exits clean

She's got arctic eyes
She's electra glide
The night bets on her
And you just let it ride

The wheel keeps turnin'
My mind keeps learnin'
The night still burnin'

Let it ride

The dawn is close
The dark retreats
The world's still here
The heart still beats

Time goes on
The earth still turns
And with the night
She will return

She's the chambered round
In the magazine
She's the first one out
But the exit's clean

When she first walks by
You feel drained and bled
With those arctic eyes
As she looked at me and said

The dice keep earning
They keep returning
