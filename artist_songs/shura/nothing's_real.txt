Never thought I'd be stuck in this bed
With a cheap clock ticking above my head
One for me, one for you, one for them
Oh, what you lookin' at?
Somebody get me out of this dress
Time to take a walk in
And I need medicine

I see my heart beat inside
A television screen
My heart is not connected, no
They're telling me that I'm fine
They're telling me that there's nothing wrong, anymore
Nothing's real

I've gotten nerves around my chest
Telling me turn back and go around left
One o'clock, two o'clock, three
How is it time runs away from me?
Call up my relatives, tell them I'm done
I'm gonna take a walk in
I need medicine

I see my heart beat inside
A television screen
My heart is not connected, no
They're telling me that I'm fine
They're telling me that there's nothing wrong, anymore
Nothing's real

Nothing's real
Nothing's real
Nothing's real

I see my heart beat inside
A television screen
My heart is not connected, no
They're telling me that I'm fine
They're telling me that there's nothing wrong, anymore
Nothing's real

Nothing's real
Nothing's real
Nothing's real
Anymore
And nothing's real
