You have grown young in your old age
And we have become friends I think
And we fought a war for so long
No one has won, no one has won

So scared I'll lose you to the dark
So scared I'll lose me to the dark
I don't want to lose you to the dark
I don't want to lose me to the dark

So take hold of my hand like you never did
Take me back home like you never did
Teach me right from wrong like you never did
And we will be friends like we never were
