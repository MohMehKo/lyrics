Your language got me tongue tied
Do you mind if we speak mine?
Is there some place we can go hide?
We wanna but we're too shy

(Don't wanna be)
Don't wanna be alone tonight
And you're always on my mind
(Don't wanna be)
I see the answer in your eyes
But you need a reason why
(Don't wanna be)
I'd rather lose it all for you
Than regret things I didn't do
Don't wanna be alone
Cause you're what I want

Just say that you want me
Just say that you want me
Don't walk away wondering what could have been
(What could have been)
When I know you want me
(I can be what you want)

I love that we're different
You got something that I'm missing
You keep playing so cool
Wish I could be like you

(Don't wanna be)
Don't wanna be alone tonight
And you're always on my mind
(Don't wanna be)
I see the answer in your eyes
But you need a reason why
(Don't wanna be)
I'd rather lose it all for you
Than regret things I didn't do
Don't wanna be alone
Cause you're what I want

Just say that you want me
Just say that you want me
Don't walk away wondering what could have been
(What could have been)
When I know you want me
(I can be what you want)

Just say if you want me
Just say if you want me
Just say if you want me
Just say if you want me
Just say that you want me
Just say that you want me

Just say that you want me
Just say that you want me
Don't walk away wondering what could have been
(What could have been)
When I know you want me
(I can be what you want)
Just say that you want me
Just say that you want me
Don't walk away wondering what could have been
(What could have been)
When I know you want me
(I can be what you want)
