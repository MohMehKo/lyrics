"Um... I was almost thinking, like, we should find maybe a tuba sample... And then we could, like..."
"We could try"
"Uhh... You could have the opening..."
"Yeah"
"And it's almost like a drop"

One girl on the last train
Small change in the universe, says she
Speaks to herself out loud
Nobody ever looks at her

Nobody ever looks at her
Nobody ever looks at her
Nobody ever looks at her
Nobody ever looks at her

And she says
"Kill them all of course"
"Kill them all of course"

And oh...
And oh...
And oh...
(I wonder what you're thinking now)
And oh...
(Would it have made a difference?)

Nobody ever looks at her
Nobody ever looks at her
Nobody ever looks at her
Nobody ever looks at her

And she says
"Kill them all of course"
"Kill them all of course"
"Kill them all of course"
"Kill them all of course"
"Kill them all of course"
"Kill them all of course"

"Yeah, if you could try bend it..."
"Yeah"
'Kill them all of course'
"Should we sample that? That'd be fucking sick! Wait... 100% that's what we're sampling?"
"Yeah..."
