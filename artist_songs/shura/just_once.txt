I’ve lost count of how many times we’ve disagreed
But it’s the third time we’ve fought together this week
Maybe it’s nothing, maybe I just need time on my own
Just once, I’m gonna go and get drunk

[Chorus:]
If you get my name wrong I won’t get pissed off cause
I wish I was somebody else
You know nothing about me, I know nothing about you
But maybe the question mark helps
Have you ever been lost?
We could get lost
I wanna get lost

I’m not sure if I’m just thinking ‘bout it too much
Or if I’m just looking for an excuse for us to break up
Maybe I want to , maybe I need to
Find a way to tell you that I want to let you go
Just once, I’m gonna go and get drunk

[Chorus]

Have you ever been lost?
We could get lost
I wanna get lost
(I wanna get lost with you)
