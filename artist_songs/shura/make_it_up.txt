One girl on the last train
Small change in the universe, and she
Speaks to herself out loud
Nobody ever looks up at her

And she says
"I wonder what you're thinking now
Is there something that I could've said?
Would it have made a difference?"

Do you ever make it up?
Do you ever make it up?
Do wake up in the night and change your mind?
Do you ever make it up?

One line across town
Her friends are calling cause they haven't seen her
But she won't pick up the phone right now
And they keep asking why she's been so quiet

And, oh, do you wonder what she's thinking now?
Is there something that we could've said?
Would it have made a difference?

Do you ever make it up?
Do you ever make it up?
Do wake up in the night and change your mind?
Do you ever make it up?

Do you ever make it up?
Do you ever make it up?
Do wake up in the night and change your mind?
Do you ever make it up?

Do you ever make it...
(Make it...)

Still got time to change your mind
(Do you ever make it...)
Still got time to change your mind
(Do you ever make it...)
Still got time to change your mind
(Do you ever make it, make it up)

Do you ever make it up?
Do you ever make it up?
Do wake up in the night and change your mind?
Do you ever make it up?

Do you ever make it up?
Do you ever make it up?
Do wake up in the night and change your mind?
Do you ever make it up?

Do you ever make it...
Still got time to change your mind
Do you ever make it...

Do you ever make it...
Still got time to change your mind
Make it...
