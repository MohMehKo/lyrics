Asked me to meet you at six o'clock
You sounded weird so I went straight from work
But you said, you said that you didn't want me
I never thought that we'd break up
Thought we'd get married and have kids 'n' stuff
But you said, you said that you didn't want mine
It hurt back then but now I'm fine

Wish I knew right from the start
That we would never ever work things out
Maybe I knew right from the start
And that's exactly how I broke us down
How can I not be, everything that you need?
How can I not be, everything that you need?

I think I know just what went wrong
I hadnâ€™t figured out where I belong
When you said, you said that you didn't want me
It hurt back then but now I'm free

Wish I knew right from the start
That we would never ever work things out
Maybe I knew right from the start
And that's exactly how I broke us down
How can I not be, everything that you need?
How can I not be, everything that you need?

Wish I knew right from the start
That we would never ever work things out
Maybe I knew right from the start
And that's exactly how I broke us down
How can I not be, everything that you need?
How can I not be, everything that you need?

How can I not be?
How can I not be?
How can I not be?
How can I not be?
How can I not be?
Be, be, be, be, be, be
Be, be, be, be, be, be
Be, be, be, be, be, be
Be, be, be, be, be, be
How can I not be?...
