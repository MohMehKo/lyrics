Puttin' on my coat
Wanna break out from these walls 
Catch a bus and take a walk downtown 
Maybe run into a friend 
I just know I got to get out 

But everywhere I go 
I see lovers hand in hand 
Reminds me of the way it used to be (reminds me of the way it used to be boy) 
Baby it felt so right 
When you were walkin' with me 
(don't you see) 

[Chorus]
I'm cryin' how could you leave me all alone 
I'm cryin' just can't make it on my own 
I dream of you the whole day through 
But when the night time falls 
I'm all alone 
Cryin' all alone

When I close my eyes 
I can feel your lips on mine 
Nobody ever touched me like you did (nobody ever touched me like you did boy) 
There ain't a thing I wouldn't give 
Baby for just one more kiss 
(Don't you see) 

[Chorus]

My friends say I'll love again 
I wanna believe but why pretend 
Tell me why, why pretend baby 
I'm always gonna feel the same 
No one will ever take your place 
No nothing can compare 
With the love that we shared, baby (don't you see) 

[Chorus]
