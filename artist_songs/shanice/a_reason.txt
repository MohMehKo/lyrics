I gave my all to you 
And you made it easy to fall in love 
I fell in love with someone 
You pretended to be 
Was too blind when I was with him 
Now I see, so 

[Hook]
Don't you come back running? 
Now my heart is aching 
I can not find a reason 
To love you now 
And don't you come back crying 
Now that love is dying 
I can not find a reason 
To love you now, how can I love you now? 

I thought my life was over 
And I thought I'd never get over it 
All the tears I cried 
Were filled with so much pain 
Tomorrow promises the pain 
Will fade away, so 

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Now it was just a game to you 
What you put me through 
Will come right back to you someday 
Don't think I'm wishing bad on you 
Now that I know 
You were only here to play 
Don't you ever think you have a chance again? 
Cause I deserve so much more, so don't 

[Hook]

[Vamp]
Don't you come 
Back running 
My heart is aching
