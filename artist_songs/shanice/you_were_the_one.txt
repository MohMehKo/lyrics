I know things don't last forever 
But I thought that you were true 
I guess I've been mistaken 
Cause our love is done and through 

It hurts me 
Cause I know I was true to you 
And I'm sorry for whatever I've done to you 

[Chorus]
Oo-oo-oo baby 
You were the one for me 
Baby can't you see 
You shouldn't have set me free 
And oh why did you let me go 
I thought our love could grow 
You know I loved you so 
You were the one 

I don't know why you left me 
All I know is that you're gone 
I wish I could change your feelings 
But I guess my life goes on 

It hurts me 
Cause I thought you'd always be there 
But what I see 
You really didn't care 
Love is so unfair 
Cause I thought 

[Chorus]

I know it's hard for you to see 
How much you meant to me 
And if it's really meant to be 
Then you'll come back 

If loving you is still a possibility 
When you return I'll be there for you 
Cause in my heart I'll always love you 

[Chorus]

I'm gonna miss you baby 
I know you're gonna miss me too 
'Cause you know 
You were the one 
And you will always be the one for me
