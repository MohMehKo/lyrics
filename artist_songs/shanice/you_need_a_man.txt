He's sitting right across from me
Your lookin' over casually
So I'm pretendin' not to see
You tryina get his attention
So I decided to keep my cool
Don't wanna cause a scene
But your out here on a mission 
To be in my position

Girl I know you need a man 
But I could never understand
Why would you play yourself
Making it easier for any man
To wanna take you home
Make him wanna do me wrong
But he's not leavin me
You need to forget it go and 
Find yourself a man

Tell me you why'd you wanna be
The one he'd have to creep to see 
You know that he's here with me
So tell me what's your intention
I've never been the jealous type
And I won't be the fool tonight
I don't wanna have to act un-ladylike
(oh oh oh ohhhhhh)

Girl I know you need a man 
But I could never understand
Why would you play yourself
Making it easier for any man
To wanna take you home
Make him wanna do me wrong
But he's not leavin me
You need to forget it go and 
Find yourself a man
