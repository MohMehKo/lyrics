Standing in the crowded room
All on my own
I just wanna walk away
I cried so many tears at night
I got to stay
Trying to find my way
You can't have sunshine without the rain
So you just have to deal with the pain
It's just another lonely day

(Another lonely day)
In California
(In California)
It's just another lonely day
(Another lonely day)
In California

What am I doing to myself?
Got to get out of my head
Don't like the way I am acting, get rid of my distractions
Pushing through, is what I got to do
Can't let the darkness keep me in
But for now it's just another lone lone lonely day

(Another lonely day)
In California
(Another lonely day)
In California

I got to start loving me cause now I'm free
I truly see who I can be
Oh it's okay to have a lonely day
I'll be okay, I'll be okay

No more tears
(No more tears, the pain is gone)
Pain is gone
(I'm not afraid to walk alone)
Not afraid
(No more tears, the pain is gone)
Pain is gone
(I'm not afraid to walk alone)

(Another lonely day)
A lonely day
(In California)
California
(Another lonely day)
A lonely, a lonely day
(In California)
In California
Just another lonely, lonely day
(Another lonely day)
(In California)
California, California
(Another lonely day)
Just a lonely day
(In California)
California
Lonely day
Just another lonely day
