I used to imagine that you stayed 
And that I was able to touch your face 
I can remember how I cried 
Wishing you were with me 
I used to wonder about your day 
And if I was present in some way 
I needed to feel like I was loved 
I needed you desperately 

But I'm thankful, I'm grateful 
And you will always be to me 

Forever like a rose 
One so beautiful 
A symbol of love that I can hold 
Your petals shower me 
And I can feel your presence all around me 
Forever like a rose 
You're so incredible 
I can feel it still so powerful 
I finally believe 
That I can have your presence all around me 

I never was able to understand 
Why both of you chose to be just friends 
Thought we were a stronger family 
I guess I was wrong 
I was left with just holidays 
Maybe a Saturday or a Sunday 
Never had much time to spend together 
And I felt so alone 

But I'm thankful and grateful 
And you will always be to me... Forever 

Forever like a rose 
One so beautiful 
A symbol of love that I can hold 
Your petals shower me 
And I can feel your presence all around me 
Forever like a rose 
You're so incredible 
I can feel it still so powerful 
I finally believe 
That I can have your presence all around me 

I'm glad you have you life 
With your two new children and your wife 
It lifts my soul to see...You happy 
You will always be...Forever like a rose 

Forever like a rose 
One so beautiful 
A symbol of love that I can hold 
Your petals shower me 
And I can feel your presence all around me 
Forever like a rose 
You're so incredible 
I can feel it still so powerful 
I finally believe 
That I can have your presence all around me 

Forever like a rose 
One so beautiful 
A symbol of love that I can hold 
Your petals shower me 
And I can feel your presence all around me... I Love You...
Forever like a rose 
You're so incredible 
I can feel it still so powerful 
I finally believe 
That I can have your presence all around me
