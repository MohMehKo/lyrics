I heard you say goodbye 
Said that it would be our last night 
It took me by surprise 
Say that it isn't so 

Oh baby 
I don't wanna see you go away 
Oh baby 
I'd be there till my dyin' day 
Oh baby 
I can't live if I'm not lovin' you 
Don't make me baby 

[Chorus]
I hate to be lonely 
We could be out takin' a drive 
I hate to be lonely 
We should be walking side by side 
I hate to be lonely 
Lonely for you 
Lonely for you 

You said you wanted me 
To be your girl that's all you'd need 
And I gave my heart so free 
Trying to win your love but 

[Bridge]
Baby 
I gave my heart and soul to you 
Oh baby 
You never had a love so true 

Can't you see the tears I cry over you 
Don't leave me baby 

[Chorus]

Lonely for you baby 
I know we can last 
Just give it a try 
Trust me 

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

[Ad libs]
