[verse 1:]
What we do I our bed is a secret between you and me 
No one else has to know that information cant be free 
So when you open up your mouth it leads to curiosity 
Don't let your right hand know what your left is doing 

[chorus:]
Don't tell no body what you do with yo man 
Just keep it to yo self girl 
Cuz as soon as you turn your head she'll try to take yo man girl 
She'll be undressin him with her eyes 
Believe it when I tell you girl 
Keep it to yoself girl keep it to yo self girl 

[verse 2:]
I've learned that intimacy was made to be a beautiful thing 
For two people in love it wasn't made for three 
So when you wanna conversate about how good it was that night 
Don't tell it to yo girls ladies tell it to yo man 

[chorus:]
Don't tell no body what you do with yo man 
Just keep it to yo self girl 
Cuz as soon as you turn your head she'll try to take yo man girl 
She'll be undressin him with her eyes 
Believe it when I tell you girl 
Keep it to yoself girl keep it to yo self girl 

[chorus:]
Don't tell no body what you do with yo man 
Just keep it to yo self girl 
Cuz as soon as you turn your head she'll try to take yo man girl 
She'll be undressin him with her eyes 
Believe it when I tell you girl 
Keep it to yoself girl keep it to yo self girl 

[bridge:]
Don't tell lucy then tell suzie jus keep it to yo self 
(don't tell nobody) 
Privacy is the key don't tell nobody else 
Aint nobody business what you do just keep it to yoself 
I know that your in love don't tell it tonobody but him 

[chorus:]
Don't tell no body what you do with yo man 
Just keep it to yo self girl 
Cuz as soon as you turn your head she'll try to take yo man girl 
She'll be undressin him with her eyes 
Believe it when I tell you girl 
Keep it to yoself girl keep it to yo self girl
