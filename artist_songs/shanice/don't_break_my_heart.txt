Baby I know
You're ready for love
You gotta be patient with me
For me
Cos u're not burst
I want it to be 
Jus like a dream baby

So you know why I've been taking my time 
Do you think about the rest of my life
And yes I wanna spend it with you
Hope that u're feeling baby
The same way too

So don't break my heart
If you do I'll cry forever 
Cos there's no way I could ever get over you
Not in my life
My lifetime

Baby there's no
No greater feeling
Greater than being with you
Me and you

Baby I burst 
Forever sink
A drop of your love
Your love

Now hope that I'm not wasting my time
I've got better things to do in my life
So I hope that love to grow old with me
Cos there's the only the only way
We can be

So don't break my heart
If you do I'll cry forever
Cos there's no way I could ever get over you
Not in my life
My lifetime

Don't break my heart
If you do I'll cry forever
Cos there's no way I could ever get over you 
Not in my life 
In my lifetime

Promise me you'll watch over me
Oh jus promise me you're right here and right now
You know my little heart breaks so easily
So baby don't leave me don't leave me
Don't leave me now

Don't break my heart
If you do I'll cry forever
Cos there's no way I could ever get over you 
Not in my life
In my lifetime

Don't break my heart
If you do I'll cry forever
Cos there's no way I could ever get over you
Not in my lifetime
My lifetime
