Boy you're telling me you wanna leave 
It's alright with me 
Cause it's something going on that you don't know 
I got someone else waiting for me 
And this is gonna be easy 
I knew that one day it was gonna end 

I always needed a way out 
Boy now I know what you're about 
I've wasted so many year of my life 
You can have everything else, I'm out 

[Hook]
You can have the house 
Here's the keys, you can have the car 
I don't need you anymore 
Take the diamonds and the furs 
Not another word 
I ain't coming back no more 

Leaving behind all bad memories 
So here take all your things 
I don't need that negativity with me 
You must have been reading my mind cause I 
Finally opened up my eyes 
You're doing me a favor, walking out my life, my life 

I always needed a way out 
Boy now I know what you're about 
I've wasted so many years of my life 
I'm not your fool anymore, I'm out, yeah, yeah 

[Hook]

[Bridge]
You can have the house 
You can bounce, you can bounce 
You can bounce, you can bounce 
You can bounce, you can bounce 
You can bounce, you can bounce 
You can have the house 
You can bounce, you can bounce 
I don't need you anymore 

[Hook]
