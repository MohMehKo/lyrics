[Rap]
I don't need a lover boy 
Baby I need a man 
I told you that 
Time and time again 

So past 
Don't even make me laugh [giggle]
You don't stop 
I'm gonna kick your [beep]

See I'm not dependent 
On 1 lil-2 
Nor-3 lil indian dreams 

You gonna make me scream 

[Chorus]
Stop cheatin' on me 
Stop cheatin' on me 
Stop cheatin' on me 
Stop cheatin' on me 
Cheatin' on me 

I thought you were better 
But, boy I was wrong...oh so wrong 
You thought you were so clever 
Until you got caught 

[Bridge 1]
Boy ain't it a shame 
How you've been untrue 
Baby, I'm not your fool 
I know all about those games 
I said it's nothin' new 
I'm not gonna be used 

[Chorus]

Hey, my mama told me 
'Bout boys like you...the things you do 
You like running so care-free 
Doin' what you choose 

[Bridge 2]
Don't you know I've tried 
To believe in you 
But you were up to no good 
I'm not gonna fuss and fight 
What's the use? 
I either get it right or get it cut loose 

[Chorus]

Don't come to my house, baby 
If you're gonna be a dawg 
Just cheatin' on me 
Don't come to my house baby 
If you're gonna be a dawg 
Just cheatin' on me 

I don't know who he thinks he is...dawg 

[Rap]
You're playing the roll 
Lover boy like ya, high post 
With girls in the street 
Seems when you try most 
To be all that you can be 
But see 
I ain't the one to be played 
Shanice 

Is pickin' the pace up 
Shoe strings laced up 
You know what I'm sayin' 
Stop wine'in keep ya, face up 

Baby 
Gotta believe it's driving me crazy 

[Bridge 2]

[Chorus]

Hey my daddy told me about the things 
You do 
If you wanna be with me, here's what you gotta do 
Get your act together...don't play me for no fool 
Either get it right or get your butt cut loose 

[Chorus]
Stop
