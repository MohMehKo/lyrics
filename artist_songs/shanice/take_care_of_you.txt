Ummm oohhh ahh ohhh,

[Verse 1]
Been workin all day long,
Tryin 2 get your hustle on
Society has put the pressure on you,
To make it hard to for you to do what you do.
Gotta let you know that your not alone

[Hook]

(I wrote this song) to show you my apperciation for you
So let me know if your cool wit that (baby) ooooohhh

[Chorus]
Lay bac a while,take off your shoes,
Relax yourself I'm gonna take care of you,
I'm gonna show you thangs you neva seen before,
Make you feel like a man when you walk through that door,
I'm gonna cook your dinner,
Wash your clothes an change your linen,

I'm gonna light the candles,
Run your bath I'm here 2 take care of you

[Verse 2]

2 do the things that couples do,
Turn down the lights I know you don't have a clue
(Victoria's gotta a Secret for ya)
Gonna let you know neva gonna let you go

[Hook]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Boy you just don't know an its hard to explain

Boy I cant control it,(its hard for me 2 hold it,
When you look into my eyes an I began 2 fantasies)
[repeat]
(Thats why I'm gonna take good care of you)

[Chorus Repeat 2x]
