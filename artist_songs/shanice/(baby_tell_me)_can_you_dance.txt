I see you in the corner starin' in space
Actin' like you're groovin' with the look upon your face
I see you smilin' at me, you want to know my name
But if you wanna play, boy, you got to play my game

What I really want to know
Is can you dance

You're talkin' to your friends about how good I look
Try to find a number always in the book
Before you come up to me to tell me how you feel
I'm wiser than my years, so let me tell you what's the deal

What I really want to know
Is can you dance

Can you dance
Can you dance
Can you dance
Baby, tell me can you dance

I just wanna party, that's what I'm here to do
I didn't come through to pick up by the likes of you
I'll give you a chance and one is all you get
If you think I'm sassy now, boy, you ain't seen nothin' yet

What I really want to know
Is can you dance

(What I really want to know) What I really want to know
Is can you dance, uh

Can you dance
Can you dance
Can you dance
Baby, tell me can you dance

Can you dance
Can you dance
Can you dance
Baby, tell me can you dance

I see you groovin' hearty
Looks like you're havin' fun
But if you came to party
Start dancin' on the one
Get up

If your dance is nothin'
You don't need to be here
It ain't about the posin'
But the sexy atmosphere
Get with it

You've got to start a fire
If you want to put one out
It's the groove that takes you higher
That's what dance is all about
Now I'm a busy person
No time for playin' games
But if I know you're serious
I'll tell you what's my name
Shanice

Can you dance
Can you dance
Can you dance
Whoa, can you dance
Tell me, tell me, tell me can you dance

Can you dance
(Tell me can you)
Can you dance
(Dance)
