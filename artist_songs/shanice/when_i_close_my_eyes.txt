Yeah yeah yeah...

[Verse 1:]
Darlin, here we are again,
Right about now,
There is no need too tell you what I'm feelin'.
I'm so grateful,
To have a man like you,
Who knows what to do,
Makes me feel like a woman should...
Ooohh yeah...

[Chorus:]
When I close my eyes,
I break down and cry,
It's somethin 'bout the way you love me...
The thought of your kiss,
My heart can't resist,
It's all about the way you love me...

[Verse 2:]
Never thought that I would find...
So much peace of mind,
And every moment that I share with you...
Sometimes I don't know why...
We fell so deep in love...
But then it all comes back to me because...

[Chorus]

[Stick:]
When I'm with you,
I feel so good
No one loves me like you...

When I close my eyes

[Chorus x3]
