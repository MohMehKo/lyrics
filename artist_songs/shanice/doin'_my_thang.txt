Don't be mad at me 
I ain't trying to have your man 
He be watching me 
You're just jealous cause 
You can't make him turn away 
But I can't help it 
I'm just doing my thang, doing my thang 

Your man, tell you he's so in love 
Swear you're the only one 
Just can't get enough of your loving 
Hmm, but he be paging me 
But you too blind to see 
And now you roll your eyes at me cause I stay on his mind 

[Hook]

Your man, he living in a fantasy 
Thinking he can get with me 
And you just can't believe I don't want him, no, no 
But I could not pursue 
Something that belongs to you 
So if you wanna play the fool 
Girl that's cool I don't mind 

[Hook]

[Bridge]
He said, with you is where he wants to stay 
But to me, he says the very same thing 
Don't be mad, I don't want him anyway 
I'm doing my thang, just doing my thang 

[Hook]
