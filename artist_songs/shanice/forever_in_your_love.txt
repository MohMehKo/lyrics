Yeah baby 

I wanna tell, I wanna tell you, baby 
What's goin' on, yeah 

So you call me up and say 
"Girl what's goin' on?" 
Someone told you I had done you wrong 
People always talkin' (yeah) sayin' crazy things 
It's just jealousy 

Well if you wanna know the truth boy 
I'm tellin' you, hey 
He was just a friend of mine 
If we start to question each other, it'll tear us apart 
Baby let's not start 

[Bridge]
Don't you doubt my love 
Don't you doubt my love 
I'm never gonna give you up 
Who can you believe 
Your friends or me 
I'm not gonna leave 
Oh baby I will always be 

[Chorus]
Forever in your love 
Forever in your love 
Forever in your love 
Forever in your love 

Stood right by your side, babe 
Held you through the night 
I never let you down 
When you need someone to believe in 
Put your trust in me 
Ain't that what love's about? 

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

[Rap]
When I'm home 
Sitting alone 
thinking about you 
yeah 
and what we do 
Together 
Makes me want more 
Cause I'm sure 
That I'm forever in your love 
What you do for me 
You know 
A kiss from head to toe 
Makes me wanna scream 
To the heavens up above 
Knowing that I'm forever in your love 
Baby 
Yeah, word to your mother 

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
