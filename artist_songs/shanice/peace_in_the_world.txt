[Intro (spoken)]
From the north to the south 
From the east to the west 
We're praying 
All over this beautiful planet 
For peace in the world 
Peace 

Check this out 

Lookin' in my heart 
I got to find a way 
I wanna do my part 
I wanna make that change 

There's fighting in the streets 
What's it all about 
Can we stop the hate 
Can we work it out 

[Bridge]
(say cuz') you and I can make the difference 
The love that we're feelin' 
I truly believe in 
(say cuz') you and I can make a change 
Love will show us how 
Love will be our guide 

[Chorus]
Peace in the world is what we care for 
Hand and hand we'll make a change 
Peace in the world is what we care for 
Heart to heart we'll find a way 
Yeah, we're gonna make that change, listen 

Kids are starving now 
All across the world 
Let's lend a helping hand 
Save all the boys and girls 

People are selling drugs 
Gangs are everywhere 
Let's come together now 
Show them that we care 

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

[Rap]
Peace in the world 
So kids'll know 
Not to ever make war 
Love'll show 
That it can over power hate 
As evil disintegrates 
'Cause we got to have faith 

If you do right 
There'll be no wrong 
That's why 
Shanice is singin' the song 
About love and joy 
Every man, woman, boy and girl 
To have peace in the world 

[Chorus]
