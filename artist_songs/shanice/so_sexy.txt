[Hook]
Come on and wine and dine me 
bring me flowers and candy 
kiss me tell me you love me 
don't you know you make me feel so sexy 
come on and wine and dine me 
whisper tell me you need me 
pinch me I must be dreaming 
don't you know you make me feel so sexy 

I'm about romance when it comes to my man 
this is how we get down 
hugging and kissing and candlelight all around 
take me to a place 
it's like a natural high 
and you wanna know why 
he's love it feels me up I just can't get enough 

[Hook 2]

Baby rub my back you know I like it like that 
as a matter of fact 
there is nothing that I would not do for you. 
I'm your girl for life 
not just for one night 
baby I hope it's not I 
cause everyday this kind of love just don't come to you 

[Hook 2]

[Breakdown:]
You make me feel so sexy 
you know that's what you do 
and if you act right boy I'll make you feel it too.
