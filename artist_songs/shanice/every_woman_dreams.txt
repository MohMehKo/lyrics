[Chorus]
You don't have to worry bout a damn thang ladies 
You deserve a man that'll bend over backwards 
And buy you all those things, 
That every woman dreams 
Like Gucci bags, Cartier, escalade and diamond rings 

[Verse 1]
Ladies, I got a little story to tell ya 
Bout the things that I've gone through 
I said ladies (ladiiiieees) 
I've been through some mess in my life 
And I wanna break it down for ya 
I had a man, who would take my mercedes 
To go visit other ladies. but yall don't here me now 
And then I had a man 
Who bought me a diamond ring and took it back 
But yall didn't know all that 

And now I have a man 
Who loves me no matter what his love is unconditional 
Ladies you deserve the best (you deserve the best) 
So don't you settle for less, no no 

[Chorus 2x]
You don't have to worry bout a damn thang ladies 
You deserve a man that'll bend over backwards 
And buy you all those things, 
That every woman dreams 
Like Gucci bags, Cartier, escalade and diamond rings 

[Verse 2]
Ain't nothin wrong with having the finer things in life 
Now I got a man who asked me to be his wife 
And when I had his babies 
I gained a little weight 
But my man told me that I still look like a figure 8, yea yeah 
Love comes from within, (oh yeah) 
Remember that my friend (oh yeah) 
I would never tell you wrong, 
If your man acts up he gone 
You deserve the best (you deserve the best) 
And don't you settle for less, you don't have to worry no no 

[Chorus 2x]
You don't have to worry bout a damn thang ladies 
You deserve a man that'll bend over backwards 
And buy you all those things, 
That every woman dreams 
Like gucci bags, cardier, escalade and diamond rings 

[Speech:]
(hoo) girls..let me talk to you for a minute (you don't have to worry no) 
(hoo) the guys that I was with in the past had me feeling like (ahhh hoo) I was less than a woman 
I thought I didn't deserve the best (hoo) 
But the man that I got now.. he makes me feel like a nubian queen (hoo) 
You don't have to settle for less oh no (ahhh hoo) (hoo) 

[Chorus 2X]
You don't have to worry bout a damn thang ladies 
You deserve a man that'll bend over backwards 
And buy you all those things, 
That every woman dreams 
Like gucci bags, cardier, escalade and diamond rings
