If I had wings I'd fly away. 
I'd let the stars just guide the way, right to you. 
Don't care if this journey takes all night. 
Oh how my heart yearns to be with you.
I thought I would share with you my dreams. 
I'm still missing you. But instead of just writing you,
I'll spread my wings and,

Fly like an angel to you. 
I'll spread my wings like an eagle, 
and fly straight to you. 
I'm 'gon fly like an angel to you. 
I won't be writing you no letters, 
love's 'gon bring our souls together.

And if by chance that we should meet,
on an open glide. We'll run away with each other. 
No looking back we're headed to our destiny. 
Someday I hope it will come true.  
I thought I would share with you my dreams.
I'm still missing you. 
But instead of just writing you, 
I'll spread my wings and,

Fly like an angel to you. 
I'll spread my wings like an eagle, 
and fly straight to you. 
I'm 'gon fly like an angel to you. 
Won't be writing you no letters, 
love's 'gon bring our souls together.

And we'll fly. Through the sky. 
To the sun. To the heavens above. 
And we'll touch. Through our love. 
We'll be closer to heaven. 
I'll open my wings and,

Fly like an angel to you.
I'll spread my wings like an eagle, 
and fly straight to you. 
I'm 'gon fly like an angel to you. 
Won't be writing you no letters.
love's 'gon bring our souls together.

Fly like an angel to you. 
I'll spread my wings like an eagle, 
and fly straight to you. 
I'm 'gon fly like an angel to you. 
Won't be writing you no letters, 
love's 'gon bring our souls together.

Fly like an angel to you. 
I'll spread my wings like an eagle, 
and fly straight to you. 
I'm 'gon fly like an angel to you. 
Won't be writing you no letters, 
love's 'gon bring our souls together.
