I've been in need of some affection 
How did I end up in your direction? 
You're still friends with my ex-boyfriend 
I don't know if I was wrong to pretend 
That I never thought of you and me as getting it on 
Just so happens that I'm still all alone 
Know that I've turned you down before 
But I wont turn you down no more, baby 

[Hook]
If you check me out 
You can let me know 
I'm not gonna fight it if my heart says so 
If you wanna put it down 
Baby you should know 
I'm not gonna fight it no more 

If you wanna check me out 
You can let me know 
I'm not gonna fight it if my hearst says so 
If you wanna put it down 
Baby you should now 
I'm not gonna fight it no more 

I've been thinking 'bout your attention 
Ever since the day you began to mention 
That you wanted me oh so very long 
Never really knew you were feeling that strong 
It could be confusion with you and your boy 
Far as I'm concerned I ain't there no more 
My love it's been enough time 
When I can't get you off my mind 

[Hook]

[Bridge]
I never thought it would ever be real 
Can't stop thinking bout the way I feel boy 
Never thought of it as right before 
But I can't let him keep me unhappy no more 

Didn't think it would happen to me 
Making a decision over history 
Is it wrong to be into you? 
What am I supposed to do 
And he's not thinking 'bout me baby 

[Hook]
