Never thought I would be
Be the one scattered here, all alone

Got my shoes, got my bag
Got my make-up
Got my rag
All my head, my head is a mess

I'd rather be ugly
Than standing here
Long leaving
Plus waiting for you
And your promises that you never couldn't keep it

Let me compose myself
I got carried away
You're not the blame

It's me, it's me, it's me
Baby, it's me
It's me, it's me
I open my heart
I open my heart to you

Gotta blame me
Gotta blame me
Let me compose myself
Got to compose myself

Nobody's to blame
Nobody's to blame
Gotta blame me, me
It's me, it's me
And nobody put a gun to my head
And told me to fall in love with you

Me, it's me
Nobody put a gun to my head
And told me to fall in love with you
It's me, it's me
Nobody put a gun to my head
And told me to fall in love with you

Gotta blame me
Gotta blame me
Nobody told me
Love, don't love nobody
