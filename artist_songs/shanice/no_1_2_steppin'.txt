All the boys 
Want to know my name 
When I don't tell them 
They get upset 
Breakin' hearts 
Ain't my claim to fame 
And if I had a dime for all they tried 
I'd be a millionaire yet 
When I'm out 
Hangin' with my friends 
People say we think we're cute 
When we're together 
Yeah, we play to win 
And if you're gonna stare 
What do we care 
So what's it mean to you 

[Chorus]
No half steppin' 
Ya gotta do it right 
In the middle of the day-o 
Or in the middle of the night 

No half steppin' 
Show just what you got 
And don't give up for nothin' 
If you think you're hot 

I'm not about 
Playing games 
I got too much that 
I wanna do 
Don't have the time 
To sit down and explain 
And if you're gonna try and figure out 
Here's what I say to you 

[Repeat Chorus]

When I sing 
I do my best 
To let you know 
What I feel 
When on the stage 
I'm put to the test 
Ya better believe 
After you leave 
You're gonna know the deal 

[Repeat Chorus]
