[Verse 1:]
All my life I remember I was told
That I need a man to make me whole
I believed that I couldn't be a woman alone
So I searched everyday for someone who
Could give me happiness and truth
Didn't realize that I was living confused

[Bridge:]
It's OK
That empty space
Has been erased
(Now I can truly smile)
No more lies
They're gone goodbye
I'm satisfied
(Now I can stand on my own)

[Chorus x2:]
I'll never let another tell me that I can't be
Happy by myself with only me me me
Can't help that I'm excited
There's no way that I can hide it
I am free so free so free

[Verse 2:]
Don't get me wrong I ain't hating on a man
There's one part of my life I here must stand
I truly believe he is part of G-d's plan
But I've learned that to love somebody else
You gotta first love and know yourself
I'm no longer living under a spell

[Bridge:]
It's OK
That empty space
Has been erased
(Now I can truly smile)
No more lies (No more lies)
They're gone goodbye
I'm satisfied
(Now I can stand on my own)

[Chorus x2:]
I'll never let another tell me that I can't be
Happy by myself with only me me me
Can't help that I'm excited
There's no way that I can hide it
I am free so free so free

[Verse 3:]
I finally have control of my life
I've broken free I'm doing whats right
I had to learn it the hard way
It made me who I am a stronger woman today

(I'll never let another tell me no no)

[Chorus: to fade]
I'll never let another tell me that I can't be
Happy by myself with only me me me
Can't help that I'm excited
There's no way that I can hide it
I am free so free so free
