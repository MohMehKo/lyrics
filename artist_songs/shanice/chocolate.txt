[Verse 1:]
I Remember When I Was A Little Girl 
A Hershey's Kiss Was My Favorite Thing In The World 
When I Was Lost I Always Turned To Something Sweet 
A Candy Bar Would Always Satisfy Me Instantly (Uh Huh) And 

[Chorus:]
Your My Chocolate, Your My Chocolate 
Caramel, Creamy Filled, 100% Filled Chocolate Your My Chocolate, 
Cocoa Butter Honey Lover Your Like No Other 
Your My Chocolate, Your My Chocolate Like Hot Fudge Your Too Much 
I Cant Get Enough Of Your Chocolate, 
Your Chocolate You Are My Favorite Candy 

[Verse 2:]
Everyday You Would Always Surprise Me With Something New 
Candle Light And A Dozen Roses Just To Name A Few (Few, Few, Few) 
You Always Seem To Know The Things That I'm Feeling 
You Always Give To Me The Things That I'm Needing 
I Cant Ever Let You Go Your The Sweetest Candy That I've Ever Known 

[Chorus:]
Your My Chocolate,Your My Chocolate 
Caramel, Creamy Filled, 100% Filled Chocolate Your My Chocolate, 
Cocoa Butter Honey Lover Your Like No Other 
Your My Chocolate, Your My Chocolate, Like Hot Fudge Your Too Much 
I Cant Get Enough Of Your Chocolate, 
Your Chocolate You Are My Favorite Candy 

[Bridge:]
You Are My Chocolate Ohoh My Chocalte 
Yes You Are My Chocolate, Caramel Filled My Chocolate, 
Yes You Are My Chocolate, Cocoa Butter Honey Lover, Like No Other 
Yes You Are My Chocolate, Like Hot Fudge Your Too Much 
I Cant Get Enough Of Your Chocolate 

[Chorus:]
Your My Chocolate, Your My Chocolate 
Caramel, Cream Filled, 100% Filled Chocolate Your My Chocolate, 
Cocoa Butter Honey Lover Your Like No Other 
Your My Chocolate, Your My Chocolate, Like Hot Fudge Your Too Much 
I Cant Get Enough Of Your Chocolate, Your Chocolate
