Lovin' you 
Is easy 'cause you're beautiful 
And lovin' you 
Is all I wanna do 
Lovin' you 
Is more than just a dream come true 
And everything that I do 
Is out of lovin' you 

La la la la 
La la la la 
La la la lala la la la la la 
Do do do do 
Ooh aah 

No one else can make me feel 
The colors that you bring 
Stay with me 
While we grow old 
And we will live 
Each day in springtime 

Lovin' you 
I see your soul 
Come shining through 
And everything that we o-o-o 
I'm more in love with you 

La la la la 
La la la la 
La la la lala la la la la la 
Do do do do 
Ooh aah 

No one else can make me feel 
The colors that you bring 
Stay with me 
While we grow old 
And we will live 
Each day in springtime 

Lovin' you 
Is easy 'cause you're beautiful 
Everyday of my life 
It's filled with lovin' you 

Lovin' you 
I see your soul 
Come shining through 
And everything that we o-o-o 
I'm more in love with you 

La la la la 
La la la la 
La la la lala la la la la la 
Do do do do 
Ooh aah
