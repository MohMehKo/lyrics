[Verse 1:] 
Seems like everybody's got a price, 
I wonder how they sleep at night.. 
When the sale comes first, 
And the truth comes second, 
Just stop, for a minute and 
Smile! 
Why is everybody so serious?! 
Acting so damn mysterious, 
You got your shades on your eyes. 
And your heels so high 
That you can't even have a good time. 

[Pre-Chorus:] 
Everybody look to their left, (yeah!) 
Everybody look to their right! (ha!) 
Can you feel that? (yeah!) 
We'll pay them with love tonight... 

[Chorus:] 
It's not about the money, money, money, 
We don't need your money, money, money. 
We just wanna make the world dance, 
Forget about the price tag. 
Ain't about the (ha!) cha-ching cha-ching. 
Ain't about the (yeah!) ba-bling ba-bling, 
Wanna make the world dance, 
Forget about the price tag. 

[Verse 2:] 
(Listen, okay.) 
We need to take it back in time, 
When music made us all UNITE! 
And it wasn't low blows, and video hoes, 
Am I the only one gettin'... tired? 
Why is everybody so obsessed? 
Money can't buy us happiness. 
Can we all slow down and enjoy right now? 
Guaranteed we'll be feelin' 
All right. 

[Pre-Chorus:] 
Everybody look to their left, (yeah!) 
Everybody look to their right! (ha!) 
Can you feel that, (yeah!) 
We'll pay them with love tonight... 

[Chorus:] 
It's not about the money, money, money, 
We don't need your money, money, money. 
We just wanna make the world dance, 
Forget about the price tag. 
Ain't about the (ha!) cha-ching cha-ching. 
Ain't about the (yeah!) ba-bling ba-bling, 
Wanna make the world dance, 
Forget about the price tag.
