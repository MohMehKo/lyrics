I'm still alive but I'm barely breathing
Just prayin' to a god that I so believe in
‘Cause I got time while he’s got freedom
‘Cause when a heart breaks no it don't break even

His best days will be some of my worst
He finally found someone that’s gonna put him first
While I'm wide awake he’s no trouble sleeping
‘Cause when a heart breaks no it don't breakeven... even... no

What am I supposed to do when the best part of me was always you
And what am I supposed to say when I'm all choked up and you're ok
I'm falling to pieces, yeah
I'm falling to pieces, no

They say bad things happen for a reason
But no wise words gonna stop the bleeding
‘Cause he’s moved on while I'm still grieving
‘Cause when a heart breaks, no it don't breakeven, even, no

What am I supposed to do when the best part of me was always you
What am I supposed to say when I'm all choked up and you're ok
I'm falling to pieces, yeah
I'm falling to pieces, no
I'm falling to pieces
I’m falling to pieces

Oh he’s got his heart and my heart and none of the pain
You took your suitcase, I took the blame.
Now I'm tryna make sense of what little remains, oh
‘Cause you left me with no love and no love to my name.

I'm still alive but I'm barely breathing
Just prayin' to a god that I do believe in
‘Cause I got time while he’s got freedom
‘Cause when a heart breaks no it don't breakeven, even, no

What am I supposed to do when the best part of me was always you
And what am I supposed to say when I'm all choked up and you're ok
I'm falling to pieces, yeah
I'm falling to pieces, no
I'm falling to pieces
I’m falling to pieces
I’m falling to pieces
