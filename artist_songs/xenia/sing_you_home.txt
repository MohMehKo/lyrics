You got a feeling
It’s gonna turn you around
You can’t believe it
But you can’t run from the sound

Of the melodies growing inside of you
The harmonies chasing you down
So just surrender
‘Cause it’s a part of you now

See it written on the walls all around you
Something hidden every song is a stepping stone
Kinda like the way it feels when you let the stars sing you home
Home, sing you home
Stop shhh, listen ’cause the stars are trying to sing you home

You wanna fake it
But you can’t do it alone
So if you face it
Can you take me along

‘Cause the melody growing inside of you
Wants a harmony all of its own
You think I’m faking
I’m tryin’ to throw you a bone

See it written on the walls all around you
Something hidden every song is a stepping stone
Kinda like the way it feels when you let the stars sing you home
Home, sing you home
Stop shhh, listen ’cause the stars are trying to sing...

It’s falling to pieces
The bridge is a lie
You’re looking for reasons
Open your eyes

See it written on the walls all around you
Something hidden every song is a stepping stone
Kinda like the way it feels when you let the stars sing you home
See it written on the walls all around you
Something hidden every song is a stepping stone
Kinda like the way it feels when you let the stars sing you home
Home, sing you home
Stop shhh, listen ’cause the stars are trying to sing you home
