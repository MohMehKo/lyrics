I see what you are trying to do
Trying to win my heart and guide my fool
But I do know better than to let myself fall for you
Take a quick step back, 1, 2
Let’s think about the next thing we should do
One unsteady movement could end up saying the I do’s

[Chorus:]
Cause I’m not a fool 
I know you want me to 
Say what you mean
There’s a pretty please 
Not a fool
Don’t try to change my mind
I’ve got walls that you can’t climb
I’m too good for you 
You’re a fool

Boy you should think back
You are slick but I know too well it’s a trick 
Try to swing some other lonely girl to be your fit 
Because every time you smile I see your plan
You want to take my hand and be my man
The whole time you’re talking 
You should start walking out of here

[Chorus]

I’m not a fool falling for you
Because I’m only human too
So cut it out and tell me what you’re about
Or just let me out

[Chorus x2]
