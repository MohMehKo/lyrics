Close your eyes, I want to ride the skies in my sweet dream
Close your eyes, I want to ride the skies in my sweet dream

Yo, think I remember when this place was all wooded 
Tried to paint a picture in my brain, but I couldn't 
They played the footage of the crime scene
You'd probably see my house in the background if it was widescreen
Society cesspool, township's chess move was a sting
All cases x'd soon, couldn't charge us with a thing
Open field signed and sealed to be paid for strip malls
The same place where kickball was played
The forest where I had my first kiss now is gone
Parents yellin' "I object!" in the town hall
Told Julie she's going to church from now on
Preacher raped her, her innocence now lost
And I'm 'bout to catch a gun charge
My parents got saved off village, written on signs in the front yard
Momma, your son's smart, he just fell
I'm sorry for contributing in fuckin' up the field, that's for real

Close your eyes, I want to ride the skies in my sweet dream

But if we leave, I don't know where we'd go

Close your eyes, I want to ride the skies in my sweet dream

And will the city keep chasin' us, chasin' us?

Close your eyes, I want to ride the skies in my sweet dream

But if we leave, I don't know where we'd go

Close your eyes, I want to ride the skies in my sweet dream

As I walk amongst the debris, tryna rise from the hopelessness
The field where we used to play's the parking lot where homeless men sleep
When the crime increased, it had a lot to do with us
As we turn the corner, the corner has prostitutes and drugs
We always have bugs in the kitchen, but never on the phone
Mom's had two jobs, every day was home alone
Four friends died of an overdose
Fell off the motorboat, comatose, throat or rope
Jesus Christ, God help us!
Mr. President, rescue!
Or don't...Whatever, fuck it
I didn't elect you
Meth labs, test tubes, kids passin' in science with flyin' colors
I'm just worried about my little brother, he's nine
Rewind to when I was his age
I wasn't worried about survivin' the day, but turned to crime anyway
Never givin' you your property back, moved our property back
Property tax went through the roof

Close your eyes, I want to ride the skies in my sweet dream

But if we leave, I don't know where we'd go

Close your eyes, I want to ride the skies in my sweet dream

And will the city keep chasin' us, chasin' us?

Close your eyes, I want to ride the skies in my sweet dream

But if we leave, I don't know where we'd go

Close your eyes, I want to ride the skies in my sweet dream

And the kids are all pilled up
The preacher said the way we live our life's gonna kill us
Tell him to eat a dick
They ask me if I feel guilty, now I'll plead the fifth
Like always, they kick my door in and drag me through the hallway
Momma said they ruined this town, Daddy, where are you?
Police hollerin' "Rome if fallin'!", and I can't argue
City's got a way of expanding and crawlin' out
Since me and God had a fallin' out, robbery and drugs is what I'm all about
Just another crack in the pavement
Judge used a fuckin' Bible just to smack me in the face with
It didn't taint, I'm livin' in the basement of someone else's pad
We only got the words 'fuck off' wrote on the welcome mat
I helped burn this village, murder and pillage
Burners and killin's, with no concern with the civilians
We turned this quiet town to a metropolis of drugs and slaughter
Momma, kiss your son and hug your daughter

Close your eyes, I want to ride the skies in my sweet dream

But if we leave, I don't know where we'd go

Close your eyes, I want to ride the skies in my sweet dream

And will the city keep chasin' us, chasin' us?

Close your eyes, I want to ride the skies in my sweet dream

But if we leave, I don't know where we'd go

Close your eyes, I want to ride the skies in my sweet dream

Momma says that we ruined this town...
