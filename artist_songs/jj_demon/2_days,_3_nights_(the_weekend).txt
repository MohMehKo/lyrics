(Hahahahaha, ha ha! Hahahahaha, ha ha ha!)
It's Friday night, what are we doin'?
It's Friday night, where are we goin'?
What's goin' on? I had the talkin' on
I heard about a party, I'm sure it's cool if we show up
Got a bottle, I don't know if that'll be enough
Jealous fellas tell us how they wanna beat us up
Girls eat us up, but only one got my attention
So I pull her over and mention:
Listen close, girl, can you keep a secret?
I just wanna bring you home for the weekend
Listen close, girl, can you keep a secret?
I just wanna bring you home for the weekend
The weekend (yeah!), the weekend (yeah!)
The weekend (yeah!), the weekend (yeah!)
The weekend (yeah!), the weekend (yeah!)
The weekend, the weekend
Come on, girl, it's after two, and I am only after you
Friday night, Friday night, I'll keep you to Sunday afternoon
Strawberry kiwi, passion fruit, do you wanna get in my tub?
Do you wanna get in my bath? Rub-a-dub-dub?
Rub-a-dub-BT-dub, I got the leafy bud
We could get freaky, we could get freakin' WEIRD
We could get trippy, we could get dippy
We could get tipsy, Britney Spears
In the bedroom for 15 years
Put on the TV, cut out the clothes
Can I have you in the first 48 and drop you back off
Before anyone knows?
Listen close, girl, can you keep a secret?
I just wanna bring you home for the weekend
Listen close, girl, can you keep a secret?
I just wanna bring you home for the weekend
The weekend (yeah!), the weekend (yeah!)
The weekend (yeah!), the weekend (yeah!)
The weekend (yeah!), the weekend (yeah!)
The weekend, the weekend
On the weekend, are you weak in the knees?
Just spend the weekend, and then we can be free
And then we can be free...
Listen close, girl, can you keep a secret?
I just wanna bring you home for the weekend
Listen close, girl, can you keep a secret?
I just wanna bring you home for the weekend
The weekend (yeah!), the weekend (yeah!)
The weekend (yeah!), the weekend (yeah!)
The weekend (yeah!), the weekend (yeah!)
The weekend, the weekend
On the weekend, are you weak in the knees?
