Graveyard, behind the church
On a tree the crow is perched
Lounging on it's lowest branch
No great secret, no romance
I should leave this stupid town
Fearing that I'd see you around
And I would not know what to say
How you threw my trust away
In the dirt... lies the body
In the basket... fruit is rotting
From the grass cadaver rise
If this is life I'd rather die
Misery, emptiness
Straw and bottle kept me sick
What's left of me
A floating ghost
Not strong enough to safe us both

Friends
Take me by the hand
I will walk you through the darkness
I will make you understand
We were friends
Running endless through the night
Until you told me that I changed
Well I guess that you were right

Living in squalor was a hideous sight
Just chasing a dollar in the city at night
You wanted to wallow in the pity that's life to a liar
Swallowed in the ittiest bite
Following what the idiots like
And like an idiot, painted it the prettiest white
Insidious, was the grip that it held
Fell down from Heaven, slipped into hell
I would never blame you for the curse
That I was given by my father
But to think that in your presence it wouldn't be exercised, why bother
And with the lump in your throat gone
Lies gave you something to choke on
The girl was not the issue
I won't miss her, I might miss you

Friends
Take me by the hand
I will walk you through the darkness
I will make you understand
We were friends
Running endless through the night
Until you told me that I changed
Well I guess that you were right
We were friends
Did we think that we were pure
We were friends since I remember
But we can't be anymore
We were friends
But we can't be anymore
We were friends
But we can't be anymore

Graveyard, behind the church
Carry us to the comfortable caress of the dirt
Despair everlasting under the gray skies
We leave friendship here so that it may die
Rain falls slow to the earth, and woe is me
Perhaps from it's burial place will grow a tree
Climbed by you and I, but 10 years younger
Waiting for the undertaker to take us under
What made us wonder
What made us crumble like bricks
Maybe we were afraid of thunder
Cross silhouette in the dusk of November
The boys make a pact to be friends forever
This is like never, "Leaving us so soon?"
We feel the kinship die, leaving it's own wound
We thought that we could survive anything
But what does forever mean when you're 17

Friends
Take me by the hand
I will walk you through the darkness
I will make you understand
We were friends
Running endless through the night
Until you told me that I changed
Well I guess that you were right
We were friends
Did we think that we were pure
We were friends since I remember
But we can't be anymore
We were friends
But we can't be anymore
We were friends
But we can't be anymore
