Run little girl,
I know where you are.
Didn't think I'll see you under the bed
but there you are.
Backseat of your car, a gentleman with a blade
kiss as sweet as cinna-mints
and she screams 'Are you okay?'
Daddy got it made
with the undead butcher.
If you've ever made love by the lake
then I'll push ya.
Through the cold water sinking like a stone
I'm an ax murder app
you can sync it to your phone.
Blink and then I'm gone
rubber glove bandit.
It looks like a mess but I motherfucking planed it.
You panic
and this is not the time to get frantic.
Oh please, on your knees
I got you praying like a mantis.
Please don't insult me with this weak shit,
if God loved you,
why the fuck'd he let me creep in?
I let it seep in 
you're all alone
Yeah, chained to the radiator
You ain't goin' nowhere.

You ain't goin' nowhere.
You ain't goin' nowhere.
You ain't goin' nowhere.
You ain't goin' nowhere.

Open up, say ahh.
Pop the trunk, let's play god.
Open up, say ahh.
Pop the trunk, let's play god.
Play god
Play god
Play god
Live backwards!

Damn, you're beautiful
I dreamed you this way.
With your eyeliner
Runnin' tryin' to scream 
through the tape, baby!
I could probably just leave you this way.
I'm a star and nobody would believe you.
I walk in the cathedral
hear the low hum of my presence.
The words 'Live Backwards' will shake your very essence.
Cemetery message; read it on the plaque
while you're trying to count your blessings
I will teach you to subtract.
False hopes; throw another penny in the wishing well.
The knife will make a woman out ya, but I never kiss & tell.
I'm a first class ticket for a trip to hell,
atlas never shrugged
he was drugged.
He tripped and fell.
I'm not even Christian when it helps.
If you wanna hear that fake shit; listen to yourself!
I embody this terrifying crash behind a road flare.
You're pinned underneath.

You ain't goin' nowhere.
You ain't goin' nowhere.
You ain't goin' nowhere.
You ain't goin' nowhere.

Open up, say ahh.
Pop the trunk, let's play god.
Open up, say ahh.
Pop the trunk, let's play god.
Play god
Play god
Play god
Live backwards!
