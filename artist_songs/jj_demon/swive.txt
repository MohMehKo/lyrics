This is the moment that we thought would never come
Is it fleeting? I'm bleeding from my heart, forever young
Our first meeting, but we talked for years over the phone
You'd text me dirty pictures when I was feelin' alone

Scandalous. Both of us involved on and off
But the stamina we had woulda never let it damage what we had
I'm an animal now, I see you there
Standin' in my hotel room with your camera

I'm headed to Angelo, laid over in Dallas
You asked me to come stay over your palace
I'm headed down the rabbit hole with Alice
I was drinkin' heavy, then
Tried to stop, the hospitals in Texas don't know anything

This is the moment that we thought would never come
I was tourin’, I was soarin’ back and forth
Your life was borin', no offense
But I'm sure it was less stressful and more stable
You knew me before I had been exiled by my label

Even back when I was in jail, you were always sendin' me mail
Never thought we'd meet, is this a dream? What is happenin' now?
Textin' me when I hit Texas, somehow you fell out
Which might sound crazy otherwise
But it was you, I think I was proud, now

This is the moment that we thought would never come
And now we're lost in time, you brought me a bottle of wine
I was already drunk
Drunk as an empty cup, Bible pages ripped to shreds
All over the floor, what the fuck was I so angry for?

This is the moment, only feel it, make it real
Your walls are breathing heavy and you're shakin'
And I am nervous, too, but I can fake it
You tell me I am much taller in person
I tell you I'm much smaller when I'm naked

And you laugh, I see the ice is breakin'
It sculpted into a swan, I know your heart's been broken before
Tonight, I’m hopin’ it’s not
Please, open a slot, reserve for the boy that returned to you
While you were walkin’ alone in the dark to your home
In the [?] before you had drove in a car
You were just seventeen

I was in Philly, a million miles away
Livin’ my life in a violent haze of trial and error
[?] biodegrade

This is the moment, I know it, the one that we thought wouldn’t come
But it came, it’s a shame that I had to be drownin’ in sauce
But I felt I must entertain

But I can remember surrendurin’ vividly, still
And temperature risin’ inside of that room in the Spring
We bloomed, the memory’s givin’ me chills

And now that the moment’s arrived, the moment we waited for then
Is now momentarily here, and we’re just afraid it’ll end

When you’re alone and feel scared, know a part of me is still there
I’m leavin’ soon, my bags are packed
I promise you that I’ll be back

When you’re alone and feel scared, know a part of me is still there
I’m leavin’ soon, my bags are packed
I promise you I’m already back
