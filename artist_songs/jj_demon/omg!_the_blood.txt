Things can never go back to the way that they were
Never go back to the way that they
Things can never go back to the way that they were
They were, they were, they were

Was hurting me your intent? 
Open heart surgery scalpel without the sense, 
To not sell what we had between us to pay the rent, 
When our living condition was a lie, 
You were visiting me in prison for crimes 
I committed when I was high, envision the inside, 
Crawling with bloody animals, saw them become my family, 
Calling out to you panickin', and it can get worse, 
The vanishing act, abandonment hit me head first. 
Sweet heart, you brought fleas in your home, 
I'm bleeding now, I don't see how that's easy to condone. 
What the fuck did you think was gonna happen when I got out? 
I would have made you my only, but not now.

Things can never go back to the way that they were
Never go back to the way that they
Things can never go back to the way that they were
They were, they were, they were

Oh my God, the blood (oh my God!)
Oh my God, the blood (oh my God!)
Oh my God, the blood (oh my God!)
The blood, the blood, the blood, the blood

Was hurting me your intent? 
Maybe you found god and you're giving me up for lent, when 
I was a little cold I would sleep next to the vent, 
I guess that's what you did when 
I was away but don't expect me to look at you the same... 
You put me through the pain 
Of walking out of a coffin and into the crematorium, 
Funeral tune accordion, now you want the delorean, 
Now you're falling apart with remorse, 
Nailing my tell-tale heart to the floor... 
With a bastard fuck partially born pathetic etiquette, 
I let it get out of hand, my life had to get edited,
You're deader than the day that I left, 
You were supposed to wait forever and a day 
But you crept into a frozen lake.

Things can never go back to the way that they were
Never go back to the way that they
Things can never go back to the way that they were
They were, they were, they were

Oh my God, the blood (oh my God!)
Oh my God, the blood (oh my God!)
Oh my God, the blood (oh my God!)
The blood, the blood, the blood, the blood

Was hurting me your intent? 
If I had never left would your soul have remained content? 
I'm nauseated by it 
I turn away from the stench of promises 
Decomposing in the walls of a house 
That was once home to us all... 
I carved you into a swan from a block of ice, 
With out profiting properly (shoulda prophesied) 
Complete and total betrayal, the only thing 
I asked you not to do when I told you 
I was going to jail
Now it's all crumbling what a humbling little experience 
This has come to be (are you serious?), 
Mumbling, fumbling your excuses, who is the last laugh, 
I'm chuckling while your buckling under stress, 
Fuck it then, I'm a mess (yes!), my final dying wound, 
Wait, you were never mine to lose, 
I'm confused, I forgot, I woulda never let you be my woman, 
Whatever though, you say you didn't know but you shoulda!

Things can never go back to the way that they were
Never go back to the way that they
Things can never go back to the way that they were
They were, they were, they were

Oh my God, the blood (oh my God)
Oh my God, the blood (oh my God)
Oh my God, the blood (oh my God)
The blood, the blood, the blood, the blood

Oh my God, the blood (oh my God!)
Oh my God, the blood (oh my God!)
Oh my God, the blood (oh my God!)
The blood, the blood, the blood, the blood
