Come on pick up, come on pick up
Come on pick up, come on pick up
Come on pick up, come on pick up
Come on pick up, come on pick up

Answer your god damn phone
When I'm calling you
What kinda precious little time am I violating
Answer your god damn phone
When I'm calling you
I know that you can hear it v-v-vibrating

V-v-vibrating, v-v-vibrating
V-v-vibrating, v-v-vibrating
V-v-vibrating, v-v-vibrating
V-v-vibrating, v-v-vibrating

Madness is all that is around
The ashes of us fallen to the ground, smashed in the dust
Wait, what's that sound
You looked at it but put it right back down
WTF I'm buzzing in your purse
Trying to send a text but it doesn't even work
What I ain't up to nuttin'
So why when I call do I get the fuck you button

Answer your god damn phone
When I'm calling you
What kinda precious little time am I violating
Answer your god damn phone
When I'm calling you
I know that you can hear it v-v-vibrating

V-v-vibrating, v-v-vibrating
V-v-vibrating, v-v-vibrating
V-v-vibrating, v-v-vibrating
V-v-vibrating, v-v-vibrating

Madness, questions in the brain
I feel like I'm playing an estimating game
Either you get mad or you're gonna cry
Either way when you come through the door your gonna lie
I can't picture the morning with out you
But my mom, she warned me about you
I don't know what I'm wishing for
What about my number makes you hit ignore

Come on pick up, vibrating
Come on pick up, vibrating
Come on pick up, vibrating
Come on pick up, vibrating
V-vibrating

Madness its everything I know
Are you there
Pick up
Where the hell did you go
I'd rather you just tell me to piss off
'Stead of checkin' and seeing 70 missed calls
And 22 new messages that might seem a little psychotic
And yes it is
Why do you wanna keep me on silent
I'll show you when I call back from private

V-v-vibrating, v-v-vibrating
V-v-vibrating, v-v-vibrating
V-v-vibrating, v-v-vibrating
V-v-vibrating, v-v-vibrating
