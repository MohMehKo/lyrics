As a people we were always hurting.
Always on. 
The hallways dark. The hallways long.
We just wanna get it in all day long,
We just wanna get it in all day long.
I can hear his voice still coming through the radio waves,
Please somebody take my radio away.
Wait, no, he's tryna tell me something, he's tryna tell me something 
He's tryna tell me something, he's tryna tell me something.
I can hear his message coming through in everything the radio plays,
Please don't try to take my radio away.
Wait, no, he's tryna tell me something, he's tryna tell me something 
He's tryna tell me something, he's tryna tell me something
[?]
Sick and evil man got his finger pointed at a burning world.
Trying to make us kiss the ring upon it.
I ain't no sucker for no God or no Jesus.
I lost my best friend, I fell to pieces.
We were felons, [?] we were celebrated for no reason.
Had a problem, at the bottom with the rocks.
Man, I swear to fucking satan I had wished that it was me inside that box.
Or at least let me jump up in and I won't let no one forget him.
I got the soul of the dead flowing in me and his blood still pulsing through my veins.
Sharing needles turned us into scary people now they're turning purple.
And I wonder if God even knew our names?
I shot the fucking monkey off my back, let the dragon get away.
Ghost dragging chains through the cemetery gates.
[?]
I can hear his voice still coming through the radio waves,
Please somebody take my radio away.
Wait, no, he's tryna tell me something, he's tryna tell me something 
He's tryna tell me something, he's tryna tell me something.
I can hear his message coming through in everything the radio plays,
Please don't try to take my radio away.
Wait, no, he's tryna tell me something, he's tryna tell me something 
He's tryna tell me something, he's tryna tell me something
The room stirs, the candle flickers,
A few words, a gentle whisper.
He's in here somewhere with us! He's in here somewhere with us!
The room stirs, the candle flickers,
A few words, a gentle whisper.
He's in here somewhere with us! He's in here somewhere with us!
God complex, [?] stranger at the door.
I guess we're not allowed inside the manger anymore.
The angel with her eyes sewn [?]
The best nightmare I ever had.
As a lad, I was a outcast, our past curfew.
Chasing rabbits in the graveyard days.
Automatically clicking we're like a family, great American tragedy.
We were the cult classics of our days.
Sleep take me away, I can see him, he visits me in my dreams.
Ghost moaning and no one can hear me scream.
Black shades at his funeral,
looking all around like where the fuck were these people a week ago?
I still don't know how to live without you in this world it's so cold,
No one understands me, I just wanna go home.
Whisper something to me, tell me that I'm not alone, please God let me go home!
I can hear his voice still coming through the radio waves,
Please somebody take my radio away.
Wait, no, he's tryna tell me something, he's tryna tell me something 
He's tryna tell me something, he's tryna tell me something.
I can hear his message coming through in everything the radio plays,
Please don't try to take my radio away.
Wait, no, he's tryna tell me something, he's tryna tell me something 
He's tryna tell me something, he's tryna tell me something
The room stirs, the candle flickers,
Those few words, a gentle whisper.
He's in here somewhere with us! He's in here somewhere with us!
The room stirs, the candle flickers,
Those few words, a gentle whisper.
He's in here somewhere with us! He's in here somewhere with us!
When I was young it was easy to love him like a brother,  
Now that he's gone I find it difficult to talk to his mother.
I mean what do you say to a woman that just lost her only son to the game?
Ahhhhh.
