Hm...Metronome…

Are we recording?...Alright

Money stolen, money spent
Make some money, make some cents
Bail the party, jump the fence
We can’t afford another offense
No offence, none taken
iPod, no radio station
Find God on the CD from Jason
Put Dom onto a new playlist
In a studio, wasted all day
In a school, tag coat in the hallway
We all raise hell on the reg.,
Seen the inside of a cell
Why do we lie to ourselves?
Why do we try to be anything else?
I’m anything but
Package of pills and a Hennessy cup
Realizing that we f’ed everything up

What are we doing in ruining everything that we have built?
No miracle, yeah, I went back on the heroin when I heard Jamie got killed
Family first, wondering, “can it be worse?”
Then losing a brother, I look in the eyes of his mother
and wonder if she could just keep it together
Does it even get better?
I bet if we listen a little, we’d grow up a little more sane
But we had a problem, being [?] in the bottom
Our life has been riddled with pain
Our fathers are dead, our fathers adrenaline dead, our fathers are locked in a jail
Our fathers were never around, we build a defense
We say that we’re better without

We were the runaway kids
Forties up under the bridge
Wondering which summer we’re gonna get rich
Or wind up inside a Montgomery Ditch

Born in the late 80’s (hey)
From babies making babies (ho)
Think I wanna maybe (stay)
Think I wanna maybe (go)

We were the runaway kids
Forties up under the bridge
Wondering which summer we’re gonna get rich
Or wind up inside a Montgomery Ditch

Born in the late 80’s (hey)
From babies making babies (ho)
Think I wanna maybe (stay)
Think I wanna maybe (go)

Chuck the deuce to the wind
For the cause, for the win
Ready to start, when will it end?
Forever before, and never again

Chuck the deuce to the wind
For the cause, for the win
Ready to start, when will it end?
Forever before, and never again

We knew we couldn’t be tamed, we knew we shouldn’t be blamed
Misunderstood, we’re yellin’ “what’s good?” with our foot to the flame
Feelin’ no shame, we’re fixin’ it now
We were just wasted, we were just wasting time in a basement
Breakin’ it down
Livin’ and lovin’ and fuckin’ around

Fightin’ and fuckin’ and drinkin’ and druggin’
And waitin’ for greatness to happen without even chasing it down
It’s amazing we found any peace
Somebody cue up a [?]
Yeah, but we had the best times of our lives, doe
Everybody wanted to climb inside our sideshow

We were the runaway kids
Forties up under the bridge
Wondering which summer we’re gonna get rich
Or wind up inside a Montgomery Ditch

Born in the late 80’s (hey)
From babies makin’ babies (ho)
Think I wanna maybe (stay)
Think I wanna maybe (go)

We were the runaway kids
Forties up under the bridge
Wondering which summer we’re gonna get rich

Born in the late 80’s (hey)

We were the runaway kids

Wondering which summer we’re gonna get rich
Got the Montgomery itch, yeah

Come up and get in the ditch
General abyss
Sorry Suburbia, courteously it’s the people you promised a shot
I’m not even sure we deserve it

Gladiators in the stadium for always
We hit the vein and paint our names up in the hallways
I don’t wanna be someone that I don’t wanna be
I don’t wanna see someone I love go underneath

And Tommy OD’ed, Jamie got murdered
Fav got a bad back, so did Amanda Sterner
Kyle wrecked his Harley
His brother, Matt, drowned in a car-ee
This is where they stop being a party

We were the runaway kids
Forties up under the bridge
Wondering which summer we’re gonna get rich
Or wind up inside a Montgomery Ditch

Born in the late 80’s (hey)
From babies making babies (ho)
Think I wanna maybe (stay)
Think I wanna maybe (go)

(Think I wanna, think…)
(Think I wanna, think…)

(Think I wanna maybe go)
