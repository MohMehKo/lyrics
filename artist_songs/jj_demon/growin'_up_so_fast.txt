Back in the billy (word)
This is the Philly burbs
Real recognize real
You ain't looking familiar
Let's break the seal of
Rappers talk hazardly
Real talk, soon as I get bananas
They peel off
Mango pineapple juice on freeze 
Cuz I'm a smoothie
The rest of you MCs are just fruity
Truly I'm a Schooly D movie that's come to life
Your yielding at the yellow
But HELLO I run the light!
Midsummer Night
And I'm Dreaming of leaving town
Cuz shit is just too hype
For the Demon to be around
It wasn't in my sight
But believe it, I see it now
You speak about my life
Or my freedom you might need to pipe down
I'm falling back in the back of the Caddy
With a chick that never knew her father
She's calling me "Daddy"
And we sink low
Will the drama turn us into zombies?
I don't think so
Yeah but I been wrong in the past LET'S GO!

My how the time flies
When you're spending it being sad
(when you're being sad)
We're growing up so fast [3x]
(and the faster we grow)
We walk the fine line 
Between what we want and what we can have
(and what can we have?)
We're growing up so fast [3x]
(just take it...slow)

Ay yo I'm self made
Shoulda made myself a little better
If I can go back
I woulda made myself a little cheddar
The industry is funny
They wanna act like you're buddy
But only bout 20% of the shit they say is money
I'm still running the "scene-hop" scene
And it's obscene
Verbal gymnastics
I'm jumping off of the top beam
I drop dreams
In the dirt and then I water them
To see if they grow
Instead of just wondering what coulda been
Shoulda been an aviator
The way that I'm fly
I'm Howard Hughs
Crashing into your house like
"How are you?"
Powerful
Words to live by
Give my
Best to the buhls that's beefin
I'm eating rib eye
Who's got
Time to squabble?
I'm trynna live my
Motherfuckin lizife
"HI!
I'm some over-opinionated dick
I'll be your hater this evening
Our specials include..."
FUCK YOU, Hater, I'm Leaving
"HUH?"
Fuck you, hater I'm leaving... PEACES!

My how the time flies
When you're spending it being sad
(when you're being sad)
We're growing up so fast [3x]
(and the faster we grow)
We walk the fine line 
Between what we want and what we can have
(and what can we have?)
We're growing up so fast [3x]
(just take it...slow)

There's so much hating going on
It's got me debating going on 
But I'm just an artist
Tryin his hardest
To make it
I wrote a song...
It's either about falling apart
Or holding on
Come on

My how the time flies
When you're spending it being sad
(when you're being sad)
We're growing up so fast [3x]
(and the faster we grow)
We walk the fine line 
Between what we want and what we can have
(and what can we have?)
We're growing up so fast [3x]
(just take it...slow)
