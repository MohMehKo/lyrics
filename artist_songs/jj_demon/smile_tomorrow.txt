I promise I’ll smile tomorrow
If somebody’s got a smile I can borrow
I promise I can make you laugh
In the future when I’m finished with the past

And these are supposed to be the best years of my life, my life
And these are supposed to be the best years of my life, my life

Worrying about your next meal
I’m telling you, that is the problem with running away
I’m sure you can see the appeal
Especially if you can feel you have something to say

The stomach will rumble for real, and humble you
I hope you make friends on the road
There’s many a bend in the road
I been to the end of the road

I’m back with a vengeance
And did I mention, we live in The Age of the Bombs That Fall From the Sky?
It’s all been a lie, win, lose, or draw
Let’s call it a tie, we’re all gonna die

I dropped out of college
The knowledge I got in the world would lay it to shame
I do all my girlfriend’s homework
And right now, she gets straight A’s

I smoke, I drink, I float, I sink
And I’m alone
I’m broke, I blink
And everything that I been working for is gone

In all the bus stations and the airports
Staring at the numbers in my phone
So many different floors, couches, mattresses
Man, I’m wonderin’, where is home?

I just want somethin’ of my own
I just want somethin’ of my own

I promise I’ll smile tomorrow
If somebody’s got a smile I can borrow
I promise I can make you laugh
In the future when I’m finished with the past

And these are supposed to be the best years of my life, my life
And these are supposed to be the best years of my life, my life

Yo, wrong side of 25
Waking up out of my slumber
Finally tryin’ to see that sunny side
Still in the shade, though, money-wise

Tell me, why’s everything gotta be so grown up?
And everyone’s walkin’ around as if somethin’ is missin’
Insistin’ they don’t know what

Liberal minded, meaning I care
I’m agnostic, meaning I’m scared
Ex dope-fiend, meaning I’m honest
I got love for you, meaning I’m there

And I’m keeping my promise
I’ma be laughing until the Grim Reaper’s upon us
Positive energy, reading no comments
Head in the clouds as I reach for the comets

I smoke, I drink, I float, I sink
And I’m alone
I’m broke, I blink
And everything that I been working for is gone

In all the bus stations and the airports
Staring at the numbers in my phone
So many different floors, couches, mattresses
Man, I’m wonderin’, where is home?

I just want something of my own
I just want something of my own
(I just want something of my own)

Just want something of my own, but I’m outta control
It’s kinda hard to grab hold of somethin’ that isn’t whole

Yo, I’m missin’ the feelin’ of feelin’ ambitious
Sit and I wallow and bitch about shit that I’m missin’
And wishin’ I’m rich, and like money will go
And just help my condition

Or solve all my problems
Well, I should probably go and fix it
I’m the man now, and I’mma stand out
I give a fuck if anybody listens

Yo, used to keep it all bottled up
Now I let all the bottles pop
Drink to that, yeah, bottoms up
Celebration, yeah, mazel-tov 

Did it to myself
I created monsters
The skeletons in my closet
Are starting to gain consciousness

Yeah, after all, after all
Back’s up against the wall
I need Adderall to be creative at all
And I’m watchin’ it all as it catapults

This rap shit’s really just a cattle call
Dealin’ with the bullshit, like a matador
Bein’ walked on, a doormat and all
Domino effect, I’m the last to fall

Someone pass the ball, because I’m next involved
With this hip hop shit, I invested all
Don’t expect decline, don’t press rewind
Only go fast forward, I’m next evolved

Trying to make both my parents proud
Know my granddad’s starin’ down
Never gonna stop, it’s apparent now
I ain’t leavin’ this bitch ‘til I’m carried out

I smoke, I drink, I float, I sink
And I’m alone
I’m broke, I blink
And everything that I been working for is gone

In all the bus stations and the airports
Staring at the numbers in my phone
So many different floors, couches, mattresses
Man, I’m wonderin', where is home?

I just want somethin’ of my own
