Whaddupskee? I’m on that illadel shit.
Every time I’m on the scene I make a mess. 
So what I’m gonna do this time? I’ll let you take a guess.
The way they crowd around how can you say I ain't the best?
I feel like I’m suffocating hold on let me take a breath.
The motto is “Get Weird”. Sometimes I just wanna grab a bottle and disappear.
Surviving at the bottom’s a problem, listen here.
I’m living in the city where kiddies are pistoliers. 
It’s nonsense up in the conscience.
You’re 16? Hardly a Charlie Bronson. 
When I was 16 I would just party constantly.
Where does it lead? Now I am a convict. Broken promises, I vomit in the car. 
Do you even really know what those Klonopins are for? 
Liquor in the bottle and the chronic in the jar. 
Are you honest when you say that you’re just being who you are?  

So what your life is all about? (in limbo) 
Still tryna figure it out? (in limbo) 
Well do we dance or do we die? (in limbo) 
or just watch the time fly? (out the window!) 
Oh! Oh! (in limbo) Oh! Oh! (in limbo)
Oh! Oh! (in limbo) Oh! Oh! (out the window)

Shakin' and shakin' and everybody tremble. [x4]

Every time I’m on the scene I make it crack. 
Spent all of my money I just hope I make it back. 
Dirty on the beat it’s like I need to take a bath but I'm fresher than your dresser.
LOL you make me laugh. (haha) 
Well oh well, you sell a little bit a weed. 
Fronting, acting like you’re from the middle of the street. 
You should probably go lay in the middle of the street,
when you’re really from the burbs that shit will get you deceased. 
Please. Pick a side and stick with it.
Look me in the eyes, stop being ridiculous.
Drugs in your ride and you’re being conspicuous.
You can’t even imagine the time they’ll hit you with. 
So do you and be yourself. 
When you’re looking in the mirror do you really see yourself? 
Are you man enough to ask when you’re really needing help? 
Cuz you’ll understand fast when they throw you in a cell (what the hell?)  

So what your life is all about? (in limbo) 
Still tryna figure it out? (in limbo) 
Well do we dance or do we die? (in limbo) 
or just watch the time fly? (out the window!) 
Oh! Oh! (in limbo) Oh! Oh! (in limbo)
Oh! Oh! (in limbo) Oh! Oh! (out the window)

Shakin' and shakin' and everybody tremble. [x4]
Oh! Oh! Everybody tremble! [x5]

Every time I’m on the scene I make it pop. 
I’m like Orville Redenbacher in the microwave.
You should put the mic away (stop!) As a kid I used to isolate.
Like a broken clock I tried to get right twice a day. 
By the way, I got more flavor than a Skittles bag. 
Hair cut illy and my skinnies just a little sagged.
Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin' all cool and everything you heard about me, it’s all true!
Now I don’t wanna live my life up in the limbo. 
But I like to party when I see my old friends though. 
Pardon me, sorry, um… uno momento. Super old school like 2 button Nintendo.
1 to the 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. I need a crowbar to get em off my dick. 
7, 8, 9, to the 10, 11, 12 it’s limbo, somewhere between heaven and hell. Swell.

So what your life is all about? (in limbo) 
Still tryna figure it out? (in limbo) 
Well do we dance or do we die? (in limbo) 
or just watch the time fly? (out the window!) 
Oh! Oh! (in limbo) Oh! Oh! (in limbo)
Oh! Oh! (in limbo) Oh! Oh! (out the window)
