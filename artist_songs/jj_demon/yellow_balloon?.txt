We lost a friend today.
We'll just pretend to pray.
And we won't cry about it,
we didn't like him anyway.

We'll tuck the pain inside, better just to wait and hide.
Say goodbye forever through the shadows cast on lazy eyes.

The more I think about it,
we were just kids,
listening to death music,
looking for excuses to live.
With all our vampire make up on,
we were just kids;
but just you wait until you see what we did.

And we can climb up on the roof top when it gets dark,
and shout the names of all our lovers to the beat of our hearts.
And we can smash out all the windows under the moon,
but will it save us from the weight of growing up too soon?

Where is your yellow balloon?
(don't let go, let go.) [x5]

Don't let go,
We're not growing old
No means no.
We can paint our eyes all shades of black,
We can get black eyes and baseball bats.
We can get baptized in the blood of the cool'n,
We'll still be chastised in front of the school.
Braclet wraps hide the razor wrists,
Storms that chaptise relationships.

The more I think about it,
we were just kids,
but just you wait until you see what we did.

And we can climb up on the roof top when it gets dark,
and shout the names of all our lovers to the beat of our hearts.
And we can smash out all the windows under the moon,
but will it save us from the weight of growing up too soon?

Where is your yellow balloon?
(don't let go, let go.) [x5]

Youth (youth)
Floating (floating)
Up into the air,
Like balloons (balloons)
Growing (growing),
Just enough to care.
But the truth isn't there, isn't fair.
Some sort of voice that isn't there.
Running from the choices you made and the voice that you played with poison,
Join the parade.

The more I think about it,
we were just kids,
but just you wait until you see what we did.

And we can climb up on the roof top when it gets dark,
and shout the names of all our lovers to the beat of our hearts.
And we can smash out all the windows under the moon,
but will it save us from the weight of growing up too soon?

Where is your yellow balloon?
(don't let go, let go.) [x5]
