I'm watchin' as the world ends, the city burns and [?]
I see it from my window, as the zombies make their way in my home
And watchin' as the world ends, the city burns and [?]
I see it from my window, as the zombies make their way in my home
The claps, the cinematography elapses
Wait another minute, then follow me through the city's last colony
Runnin' low on its rations, from the other side of the door
You hear 'em scratchin'
Grab your weapon, we're walkin' into the wasteland
We can shake hands with the night, where the undead breakdance in the alley
The cardboard's rotted, a prisoner of your own car doors when you lock 'em
Aim for the head, rappers ain't talkin' about their jeans when they're dead
Just brains, and the taste of your flesh, pushin' an envelope filled with anthrax
Even with a fire, you'll never know where my camp's at
Mad Max, I'm taking you to the thunder dome just beyond 
The waves at the mercy of the undertow
For those of you that thought the apocalypse would be wonderful
Plannin' in on your Facebook, you're the first ones to go
Down in the fall out shutter it's getting hectic
It's looking like maybe the baby is today's breakfast
Everybody's tryin' to be eclectic, everybody's remindin' me of dyslexics
Readin' the shit backwards, a black bird perched on a church steeple
We all hurt people that knows people hurt
People that knows people hurt
People that knows people hurt
It all falls apart, it's just the way that evil works
So when it starts rumblin' and comes crumblin' down
Maybe we're better off under the ground, now that is limbo
We all wanna just party and pretend, though
I'm watchin' it all out of my window
The city's gonna fall, oh
I see the walls, and they're crumblin' down
[?] the blood, and this is apocalypse now
