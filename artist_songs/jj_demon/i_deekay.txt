(Whatup-ski? IDK..Yizzo...) [x2]
(You...You...Whatup-ski?...Yizzo)
Will you come and see me? Are you gonna show?
Will you come and see me? I really wanna know
Will you come and see me, are you comin' to my show?
Will you come and see me, are you comin' to my show?
Will you come and see me? Will it be on the low?
Standin' in the back, oh God, I guess I'll never know
I know that you're mad at me, but you should let it go
I know that you're mad at me, but you should let it go
Will you come and see me? W-w-Will you come and see me?
Will you come and see me? Will you? Will you come and see me?
Will you come and see me? Will you come and see me?
Will you come and see me? Will you come and see me?
(Ideekay!)
Before, I know you'd be there in the rain or in the snow
To see me on the microphone, I'd rip it like a pro
But to be honest, now it's like I really never know
Sometimes I see you roarin', and sometimes you never show
Remember in the beginning, you always had to come
In the front my story got him sucking on your thumb
You could barely speak, it's like the cat had got your tongue
Now I'm asking you questions, and you are playing dumb
Remember when I told you that your kicks are really rad?
You snuck me in your window tryna hide me from your dad
You had told me that I was the best you ever had
Now what the fuck did I do to make you so very mad?
(Um...) IDK, IDK, IDK, IDK, IDK, IDK, IDK, IDK
IDFK, IDFK, IDFK, IDFK, IDFK, IDFK, IDFK, IDFK (um...)
IDK, IDK, IDK, IDK, IDK, IDK, IDK, IDK
IDFK, IDFK, IDFK, IDFK, IDFK, IDFK, IDFK, IDFK (um...)
Will you come and see me? Are you gonna show?
Will you come and see me? I really wanna know
Will you come and see me, are you comin' to my show?
Will you come and see me, are you comin' to my show?
Will you come and see me? Will it be on the low?
Standin' in the back, oh God, I guess I'll never know
I know that you're mad at me, but you should let it go
I know that you're mad at me, but you should let it go
Will you come and see me? W-w-Will you come and see me?
Will you come and see me? Will you? Will you come and see me?
Will you come and see me? Will you come and see me?
Will you come and see me? Will you come and see me?

I thought I saw you standin' behind the guy with the tennis hat
It turned out to be Candice from Atlanta, I made it back
Having panic attacks, stand in the back row
I'm in a band, so I'm a man that attracts ho's
I apologize in advance and after the fact 
If you follow my eyes, and I glance to an ass
Passing by, and at chance tryna size up the size of her pants
I gotta lie to you, but I don't gotta lie to my fans
Any man in my position would've switched to a different girl every night
But you're the only girl that I like
So if you catch my eye wandering, just remember 
That it'll wander back, if you don't come and see me, at least ponder that
(Um...) IDK, IDK, IDK, IDK, IDK, IDK, IDK, IDK
IDFK, IDFK, IDFK, IDFK, IDFK, IDFK, IDFK, IDFK (um...)
IDK, IDK, IDK, IDK, IDK, IDK, IDK, IDK
IDFK, IDFK, IDFK, IDFK, IDFK, IDFK, IDFK, IDFK (um...)
Will you come and see me? Are you gonna show?
Will you come and see me? I really wanna know
Will you come and see me, are you comin' to my show?
Will you come and see me, are you comin' to my show?
Will you come and see me? Will it be on the low?
Standin' in the back, oh God, I guess I'll never know
I know that you're mad at me, but you should let it go
I know that you're mad at me, but you should let it go
Will you come and see me? W-w-Will you come and see me?
Will you come and see me? Will you? Will you come and see me?
Will you come and see me? Will you come and see me?
Will you come and see me? Will you come and see me?
