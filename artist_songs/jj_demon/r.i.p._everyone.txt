[Chorus:]
We're saying RIP to everyone we know
Our glass is now half empty
But the tears will overflow
And still we're screaming RIP to everyone we love
Is everyone below us mad at everyone above?

This is the valley where animals live
Stress is like wind to a man on a bridge
Stand on the edge with the city below
Below the city it's 60 below

Is he alone? Is he a shadow?
And will he be home in his moment of battle?
He's roaming, a vandal
No roman candles lit on the night that he died

Might it be I
Should've been there in his place
Scared as I stare in the face of his mother
In case I discover the fear in the fate
My brother, I sent another prayer into space
Rest in peace to Prince and Thief, too
Can we speak to ghosts?

[Chorus]

Cold is the hand on the angel of death
Drawing you to its embrace
From a caress
Proceeding to strangle your neck

Falling into and from grace
This is your fate
Stare in the eyes of your sin
Every morning before you begin

Who are your family?
Who are your friends?
Lost in the comfort of needles and pins
Tommy was itchin'

The fix in the kitchen
He made his decision
He wanted to scratch
Chasing the dragon

But facing the dragon
Is not really something
He wanted to catch
But he finally did

I wonder
Did he try to repent?
As life slipped from his eyes
Scratching

[Chorus]

We still love you
We will miss you
We still love you
Is it blissful?

We still love you
We will miss you
We still love you
Is it bliss?

Eric, My cousin
I call to your spirit!
Answer!
I know you can hear it!

I conjure your soul with these lyrics!
Manifest some kind of appearance!
Scare us
I don't even care

It's better then just wondering
Where it was that you were carried
I helped carry you physically to be buried
But the rest, every individual varies

[Chorus]
