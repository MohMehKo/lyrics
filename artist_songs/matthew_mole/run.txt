I'm gonna find that this way 
I'm never gonna break my, 
I'm never gonna break my bones
and if you find that this way
you're never gonna be a-,
never gonna be alone, alone, alone, alone

You're gonna run away from the storm
you'll be ashamed forever and ever
you gotta come and lay it all down
because you can face whatever the weather

And you will see these arms are open
and you are gonna feel this love that's spoken to me,
that's spoken to me

I'm gonna find that this way 
I'm never gonna break my, 
I'm never gonna break my bones
and if you find that this way
you're never gonna be a-,
never gonna be alone

You think you've done a little too much
you need to see the potential in this heart.
They'll never be a problem so tough
you can always run back to the start

Where you will see these arms are open
and you are gonna feel this love that's spoken to me
And you will see these arms are open
and you are gonna feel this love that's spoken to me,

I'm gonna find that this way 
I'm never gonna break my, 
never gonna break my bones
and if you find that this way
you're never gonna be a-,
never gonna be alone

You'll be mine,
never think twice,
you'll never be alone

So be mine,
never think twice,
you'll never be alone,
alone, alone, alone, alone, alone, alone, alone

I'm gonna find that this way 
I'm never gonna break my, 
never gonna break my bones
and if you find that this way
you're never gonna be a-,
never gonna be alone

And if you find that this way 
you're never gonna be a-,
never gonna be alone,
gonna be alone
