The clothes that you wear
The colour of hair
The music that you share
I Guess that I like you

And the way that you pronounce an “S” is, 
like the feeling I have next you is, Beautiful  
You are beautiful
I’d  like to spend the night with you 
We’d crunch your cereal and choose 
to bench press through the early hours

You are the puddle of mud in the pig sty of my life
And I hope that you know what I’m trying to say to you
I Guess that I love you

I have told you these things so that you would not abandon your faith 
Your faith

Let’s write a song together
about this other world that you speak of
‘cause I’d like to go there with you
I’d like to spend the day with you
we’d harmonise with indie tunes
and cut the collars from our shirts

You are the puddle of mud in the pig sty of my life
And I hope that you know what I’m trying to say to you
I Guess that I love you

And I am coming home
and I’d fly across the world 
and I am coming home
and I’d fly across the world

And I have told you these things so that you would not abandon your faith
