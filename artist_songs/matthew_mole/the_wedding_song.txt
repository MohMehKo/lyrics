Here we are we've found the day
Like we always prayed
What I see the future bring
To you and me one day

Hold onto this day
Keep inside your heart such faith
We'll walk along the path God made

And our Father's spoken
This life we've chosen
Will help us follow your plan
And I can't profess that I understand it
But I see me holding your hand

Heaven made your hand
To compliment my hand
Like Heaven made my heart
To compliment your heart
Heaven gave you love
To compliment my love
So one day we will love
The way that God intended for us

Make these hearts intwine with yours
Jesus lead the way
What we've seen, all that we've learnt
Built up to this day

And our Father's spoken
This life we've chosen
Will help us follow your plan
And I can't profess that I understand it
But I see me holding your hand

Here we are we've found the day
Like we always prayed
