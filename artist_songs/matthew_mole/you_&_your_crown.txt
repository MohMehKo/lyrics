The sun down goes down 
And the moon cries out
Its love for you

The world confides in the love that hides 
Between the two
And I know

I'm not afraid to call this home
And I know that you aren't too

And you
Fall down
In the light
In the blinding light
And you
Your crown
Win the fight
Win the fight

Save these hearts
From the fire
They're leading themselves into
A world apart
There's a new restart if you simply choose

And I know I'm going to a better place
And I hope that you are too 

And you
Fall down
In the light
In the blinding light
And you
Your crown
Win the fight
Win the fight

Don't be heeding
These lies proceeding
Through ever direction you're leading
Its you who knows the truth an the meaning of life
So we're protected leaning on [x2]

And you
Fall down
In the light
In the blinding light
And you
Your crown
Win the fight
Win the fight

And you
Your crown
Win the fight
Win the fight
