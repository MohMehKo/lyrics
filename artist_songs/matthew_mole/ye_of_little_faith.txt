I guess we'll row and row all day
In the storm-infested bay
If we'll be afraid to leap in faith

He's walking on the lake
And he'll come to us and say,
"Be not afraid.
Be not afraid."

Because you take my hand and say,
"Oh, you of little faith,
I'm not afraid."
We're not afraid

Because you take my hand and say,
"Be not afraid."
I'm not afraid
