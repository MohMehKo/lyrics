And go see the world
Speak of your understanding
Make one thing known
That we are held in merciful hands
And you are the way home

And pull me apart
You'll be the realization
That we are of your heart
And we could see the darkest ending
But you see the real start

And we all fall down
We all fall down
We all fall down
We all fall down
We all fall down
We all fall down

And go to the start
And keep in your mind you've built a
Home in your heart
And with this home will you be given
A freedom of your past

And we all fall down
We all fall down
We all fall down
We all fall down
We all fall down
We all fall down

And we all fall down
We all fall down
We all fall down
We all fall down
We all fall down
We all fall down
