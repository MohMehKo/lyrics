In the heart
Of the free and untorn
There's a love
Enthroned

And we'll see
That you're calling us home
And we're not alone
And we'll see
Your love, and your grace, unfold

I'll be waiting, concentrating
On what I love
It will not fall

It's a heart love affair with the world
I will not conform

Because I saw
That you're calling us home
And we're not alone
And we'll see
Your love, and your grace, unfold

Its a war walking out your door
And its our whole life [x2]
Its a war that we're fighting for
And its our whole life [x2]
