Fall with your back into the wind
And just believing in the strength to 
Keep you off the ground
Makes us friends

Because I - I believe in such a faith
Strong enough that it will break these
Wordly intentions and make a change

You and I
We're different kinds
All the while
It's simple, child

(Aahh - oohh
Aahh - oohh)

And we - we believe that love is blind
And if you'd open up your eyes you'll
See the truth and find that you're set free

Because I - I believe in such a faith
You believe the sun will rise like
I believe that love has bought my life

You and I
We're different kinds
All the while
It's simple, child
Find your heart and place your stars
You and I
It's simple, child

You and I
We're different kinds
All the while
It's simple child
