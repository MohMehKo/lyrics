Take yours and I'll take mine
On the right hand side
And I'll rest and you'll find that you take rest in wine
So take these words and make them right
So one day you and I will write our names in the sky
We'll confide

And I'll find mine on the right of Your side
And I'll find mine on the right of Your side
If I throw away my fear and pride to set things right
Then I'll find mine on the right of Your side

Brothers and sisters
Fill these cups with life
Please forgive them
'cos they know not their lies
So take these words and make them right
So one day you and I will write our names in the sky
We'll confide

And I'll find mine on the right of Your side
And I'll find mine on the right of Your side
If I throw away my fear and pride to set things right
Then I'll find mine on the right of Your side

And I'll find mine on the right of Your side
And I'll find mine on the right of Your side
If I throw away my fear and pride to set things right
Then I'll find mine on the right of Your side
