I can see the sea view,
We were lost in our shoes,
Walls breaking down before you,
Fear of the sight reminds you
Now that I know that I never seem to show fear that I'll slow down.

And if I am your child,
Then why should the slightest of fear overcome my line of sight?
I'll be more inclined to you.

Brave me then I'll begin to stand up above in your shoes,
Doors open up before you,
Fearless enough to thank you,
Now that I know that I never seem to slow down.

And if I am your child,
Then why should the slightest of fear overcome my line of sight?
I'll be more inclined to you.

And if I am your child,
Then why should the slightest of fear overcome my line of sight?
I'll be more inclined to you.
