Yeah, party

Dance, how low can you go?
Death row, what a brother knows
Once again, back is the incredible
The rhyme animal, the incredible D

Public Enemy number one
Five-O said, "Freeze", and I got numb
Can I tell 'em that I really never had a gun?
But it's the wax that the Terminator X spun

Now they got me in a cell 'cause my records they sell
'Cause a brother like me said
Well, Farrakhan's a prophet and I think you ought to listen to
What he can say to you, what you ought to do

Follow for now, power of the people, say
Make a miracle, D pump the lyrical
Black is back, all in we're gonna win
Check it out, yeah y'all, here we go again

Turn it up, bring the noise

Never badder than bad 'cause the brother is madder than mad
At the fact thats corrupt as a senator
Soul on roll but you treat it like soap on a rope
'Cause the beats in the lines are so dope

Listen for lessons I'm saying inside
Music that the critics are blasting me
For they'll never care for the brothers and sisters
Now across the country has us up for the war

We got to demonstrate, come on now
They're gonna have to wait till we get it right
Radio stations I question their blackness
They call themselves black but we'll see if they'll play this

Turn it up, bring the noise
