Lights blur in the sky
The sun starting to die
As we're coming to life
A rapture for the fade
No fear, we are brave
This night's gonna save us

When the wind's in your hair, I just stare
For a second I don't care, I just stare
As the sun lit sand slips through my hands, I think
Let this last forever, let this last forever
Oh, oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Let this last forever, let this last forever

Fall back to the ground
Spellbound by the sound
Surrender me now
No need to be scared
True love's gonna get us there
And start the world around us

As the sun lit sand slips through my hands, I think
Let this last forever, let this last forever
Oh, oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Let this last forever, let this last forever

As the sun lit sand slips through my hands, I think
Let this last forever, let this last forever
When the wind's in your hair, I just stare
