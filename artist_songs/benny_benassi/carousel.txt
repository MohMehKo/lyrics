I'm walking down the street counting the cracks
The lines beneath my feet
Help me distract my heart from being weak
From going back
Until I feel empty, again

I can't leave, I can't let you go
Pray for me, I'm coming, coming home
I can't leave I can't leave you, no
One more time here I go

Round round round like a caro-caro-carousel
I don't know why I need you
Round round round like a caro-caro-carousel
I don't know why I need your love
I don't know why I need your love
I don't know why I need your

I knew you'd pull me in
You're like a magnet
Polar opposites, but so attracted
Don't know when to quit
And post reaction, like a bad habit

I can't leave I can't let you go
Pray for me I'm coming, coming home
I can't leave I can't leave you, no
One more time here I go

Round round round like a caro-caro-carousel
I don't know why I need you
Round round roundÂ like a caro-caro-carousel
I don't know why I need your love
I don't know why I need your love
I don't know why I need you
