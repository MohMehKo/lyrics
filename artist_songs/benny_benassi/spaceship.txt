Trip on spaceship

Sitting on top of the world
Watching the stars
Go by

I got my head in a dream
Got my head in a …..
I can fly
I can fly
I can fly

So get high, get high
Get high, get high
So get high, get high
Get high, get high

Sitting on top of the world
Watching the stars
Go by

I got my head in a dream
Got my head in the......
I can fly, I can fly, I can fly

So get high, get high
Get high, get high
So get high, get high
Get high, get high

Yeah

You’d better move, check out the baseline groove
Take control of your body soul
Let the rhythm just take control
Watch the beat drop... Explode
Take the logic overload
Take the music around a globe
Take control of your body soul, soul, soul
Let’s go

Trip on spaceship, take off
Trip on spaceship, get on
Trip on spaceship, take off
Trip on spaceship, get on

Sitting on top of the world
Watching the stars
Go by

I got my head in a dream
Got my head in the...
I can fly, I can fly, I can fly

So get high, get high
Get high, get high
So get high, get high
Get high, get high

Sitting on top of the world
Watching the stars
Go by

I got my head in a dream
Got my head in the...
I can fly, I can fly, I can fly

So get high, come on, get high, come on
Get high, get high
So get high, get high
Get high, get high

Trip on spaceship, take off
Trip on spaceship, get on
Trip on spaceship, take off
Trip on spaceship, get on
