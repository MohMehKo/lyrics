Now tell me that you need me
That you want me
That I’d love for you to know
Today we fall in love again

Electric dreams are empty
People plenty,and their voices ever born
Today we fall in love again

Now tell me that you need me
That you want me
That you’d love for me to know
Today we fall in love again, again, again, again

Please don’t leave me
Stay with our true love

Now tell me that you need me
That you want me
That you’d love for me to know
Today we fall in love again

Bright lights elevation
Constellations raining down from far above
Today we fall in love again

Tell me that you need me
That you want me
That you’d love for me to know
Today we fall in love again, again, again, again
