I'm glidin' in the beautiful sky, it's such a clear day, oh
Go ridin' in your sweet lullabies, come fly away, ay oh
I'm glidin' in the beautiful sky, it's such a clear day, oh
Go ridin' in your sweet lullabies, come fly away

Feels like you're beatin'
Beatin' the drumbeats into my heart
Feels like there's nothin'
Nothin' around to make me stop

You are a motion that makes me high
You are a dream that burns inside
A magic potion, that's my soul
Come fly with me

Feels like you're beatin'
Beatin' the drum beats into my heart
Feels like there's nothin'
Nothin' around to make me stop

You are a motion that makes me high
You are a dream that burns inside
A magic potion, that's my soul
Come fly with me

I'm glidin' in the beautiful sky, it's such a clear day, oh
Go ridin' in your sweet lullabies, come fly away, ay oh
I'm glidin' in the beautiful sky, it's such a clear day, oh
Go ridin' in your sweet lullabies, come fly away

I'm glidin' in the beautiful sky, it's such a clear day, oh
Go ridin' in your sweet lullabies, come fly away

I'm glidin' in the beautiful sky, it's such a clear day, oh
Go ridin' in your sweet lullabies, come fly away, ay oh
I'm glidin' in the beautiful sky, it's such a clear day, oh
Go ridin' in your sweet lullabies, come fly away
