Even if the ocean disappeared
Even if the clouds would shed no tears
I'd have everything I need right here
As long as you're next to me

And even if the stars forgot to shine
Even if the moon escaped the sky
And even if I search until I'm blind
I'll find a way to you
And even if the world forgot to turn
Even if the sun refused to burn
And even if it takes me 'round the earth
I'll find a way to you

And even if the stars forgot to shine
Even if the moon escaped the sky
And even if I search until I'm blind
I'll find a way to you

Even if the season turn to black
Even if the ground begins to crack
Nothing in this world could hold me back
Until you're right next to me
Even if the ocean disappeared
Even if the clouds would shed no tears
I'd have everything I need right here
As long as you're next to me

And even if the stars forgot to shine
Even if the moon escaped the sky
And even if I search until I'm blind
I'll find a way to you
And even if the world forgot to turn
Even if the sun refused to burn
And even if it takes me 'round the earth
I'll find a way to you
I'll find a way to you
I'll find a way to you
I'll find a way to you
I'll find a way to you

And even if the stars forgot to shine
Even if the moon escaped the sky
And even if I search until I'm blind
I'll find a way to you
