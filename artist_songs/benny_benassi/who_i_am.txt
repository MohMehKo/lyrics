[Verse 1: Christian Burns]
Saving a life, it makes a difference
The price of hope is worth the cost
Taking a chance, I'm willing to risk it all
Cause the soul is everlasting
While the mortals left behind
No one ever really dies

[Chorus: Christian Burns]
Strip my layers off
My memory unfolds
Back where it began
This is who I am
This is who I am
This is who I am
This is who I am

[Verse 2: Christian Burns]
A flicker of light off in the distance
Guide me home when I'm lost
I'm in your hands, we'll find our way through the fog
All the gold that we've been chasing
How it weighs us down inside
And it goes so we can't climb

[Chorus: Christian Burns]
Strip my layers off
My memory unfolds
Back where it began
This is who I am
This is who I am
This is who I am
This is who I am
This is who I am
