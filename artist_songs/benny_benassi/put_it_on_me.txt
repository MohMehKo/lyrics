I don't see them haters
But they wanna be me
I don't see them haters
But they wanna be me
I see they girl and she leaving with me
I see they girl and she leaving with me

Sexy girl, go ahead and put it on me
Put it on me, put-put-put it on me
Sexy girl, go ahead and put it on me
Put it on me, put-put-put it on me
Sexy girl, go ahead and put it on me
Put it on me, put-put-put it on me
Sexy girl, go ahead and put it on me
Put it on me, put-put-put it on me

Sexy sexy, put it on me
Sexy sexy, put it on me
Sexy sexy, put it on me
Sexy sexy, put it on me
Sexy sexy, put it on me
Sexy sexy, put it on me
Sexy sexy, let's go

Kicking the place having pictures
You're just traces
Who walk around [?] smoke that blaze
Wound up in your own base for that safe
Not my life no more that's for sure
I traded the streets for the globe
Y'all can keep all the weed, all the blaze, the blow
Wished for a mill got mills too long
Platinum gold so
Baby I don't wanna see how low you can go
I am from the south so it's only right
That she go down south for sure, go, dale

Sexy sexy, put it on me
Sexy sexy, put it on me
Sexy sexy, put it on me
Sexy sexy, let's do this

Sexy girl, go ahead and put it on me
Put it on me, put-put-put it on me
Sexy girl, go ahead and put it on me
Put it on me, put-put-put it on me
Sexy girl, go ahead and put it on me
Put it on me, put-put-put it on me
Sexy girl, go ahead and put it on me
Put it on me, put-put-put it on me

Sexy sexy, put it on me
Sexy sexy, put it on me
Sexy sexy, put it on me
Sexy sexy, put it on me
Sexy sexy, put it on me
Sexy sexy, put it on me
Sexy sexy, put it on me
Sexy sexy, let's go

Sexy sexy [repeat]

Let's do this

Sexy girl, go ahead and put it on me
Put it on me, put-put-put it on me
Sexy girl, go ahead and put it on me
Put it on me, put-put-put it on me
Sexy girl, go ahead and put it on me
Put it on me, put-put-put it on me
Sexy girl, go ahead and put it on me
Put it on me, put-put-put it on me
