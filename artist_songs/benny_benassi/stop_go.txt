Stop go back forward
Come further take it slow

Stop go back forward
Come further take it slow

Maybe if you make it in time
You must just be mine

Make a move and trow me a line
Come and make me shine, fine
Fine, fine

Stop go forward back go - forward
Come further take it slow
Move your ass as you know stop go
Take it

Maybe if you make it in time
You must just be mine

Make a move and trow me a line
Come and make me shine, fine
Fine, fine

La La La La La La La La
