I've been trying to breakout of the breakdown
Hoping to find a miracle in the meltdown
All the loving chaos that I'm surround
I dance dance to take me off the ground ground.

I've been closing my eyes so I can see you
trying to make every other lover be you
Hoping that my fantasies will come true
I dance dance and pray that some of them do.

[Chorus]
Hey-yeah, lift my emotion
Tonight, my heart is open
Let go, there's no confusion
Control is an illusion.

Control is an illusion.

Woo-ooo-oo-oo.

Control is an illusion.

I can't own ya love,
I can't own your love,
I gotta let it go in the night sky
When I look above
When I look above
I see it shining; I'll feel so aliiiiive.
Ready to let love back into my soul.
In the beauty, in the music, it's time to lose control of control.

[Chorus 2x]

Control, control.
Control, control.
