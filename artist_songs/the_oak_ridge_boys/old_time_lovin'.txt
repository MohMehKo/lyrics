Give me that old time lovin’
Like we was in love again-in
Yes that old time lovin’
Make it never ending
Give me that old time, good time lovin’ we once knew
I want that old time love again with you.

Love was sweet, love was ripe
We’d rush home every night
Life was like a flower in full bloom
Little house, no one cared
There were good times to be shared
Even though the place just had three rooms
And there was hardly a whole night that we slept through
How I want that old time love again with you.

Give me that old time lovin’
Like we was in love again-in
Yes that old time lovin’
Make it never ending
Give me that old time, good time lovin’ we once knew
I want that old time love again with you.

Times were hard but we had fun
When the old car wouldn’t run
We thought of better things to do
Love was sweet, love was ripe
Let’s bring it back tonight
Let’s make that old time lovin’ seem brand new
It’s the only kind of lovin’ that will do
How I want that old time love again with you.

Give me that old time lovin’
Like we was in love again-in
Yes that old time lovin’
Make it never ending
Give me that old time, good time lovin’ we once knew
I want that old time love again with you.

Give me that old time lovin’
Like we was in love again-in
Yes that old time lovin’
Make it never ending
Give me that old time, good time lovin’ we once knew
I want that old time love again with you.

Give me that old time lovin’
Like we was in love again-in
Yes that old time lovin’
Make it never ending
Give me that old time, good time lovin’ we once knew
I want that old time love again with you.
