There is a time I have looked in the water
And had no reflection to show
And there is a time I have stood at the crossroads
Not knowing which way to go

There is a time someone laid close beside me
And I don't remember her name
The'll say that I'm just a smile and a moment
But that was before you came

You're the one in a million
You're the one, you're the one
You're the one in a million I see
You're the one in a million
You're the one, you're the one
You're the one in a million for me

Now all of the others were places to go to
When I had no where to sleep
Well, I never made any promises to them
None they'd expect me to keep

You're the one in a million
You're the one, you're the one
You're the one in a million I see
You're the one in a million
You're the one, you're the one
You're the one in a million for me

Well, You're the one in a million
You're the one, you're the one
You're the one in a million I see
You're the one in a million
You're the one, you're the one
You're the one in a million for me

You're the one in a million
You're the one, you're the one
You're the one in a million I see
You're the one in a million
You're the one, you're the one
You're the one in a million for me
