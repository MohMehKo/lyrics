I know how hard she’ll take it 
When she finds out I can’t stay
So I don’t want to have to tell her 
If there’s any other way.
Is there any new way out 
Hearts are never broken.
Is there any new way out?  
And no-one’s ever hurt in anger.
New way out, and harsh words are never spoken.
Is there any new way out?  

Now it only stands to reason 
With all the plans that miss
That someone might have stumbled 
On a better way than this.
Is there any new way out 
Where tears are never needed?
Is there any new way out 
Where no-one ever needs surrender
New way out, neither side’s mistreated.
Is there any new way out?  

Is there any new way out 
Where hearts are never broken?
Is there any new way out 
And no-one’s ever hurt in anger?
New way out, and harsh words are never spoken.
Is there any new way out?
