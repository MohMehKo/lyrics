When you came to me with your bad dreams and your fears
It was easy to see you'd been crying
Seems like everywhere you turn catastrophe it reigns
But who really profits from the dying

I could hold you in my arms, I could hold you forever
I could hold you in my arms, I could hold you forever

When you kissed my lips with my mouth so full of questions
My worried mind that you quiet
Place your hands on my face, close my eyes and say
That love is a poor man's food, don't prophesize

I could hold you in my arms, I could hold you forever
I could hold you in my arms, I could hold you forever

So now we see how it is, this fist begets the spear
Weapons of war, symptoms of madness
Don't let your eyes refuse to see, don't let your ears refuse to hear
Or you ain't never going to shake this sense of sadness

I could hold you in my arms, I could hold you forever
I could hold you in my arms, ooh, I could hold on forever
