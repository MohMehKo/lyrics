I spent last night in the arms 
Of a girl in Louisiana 
And though I'm out on the highway
My thoughts are still with her 
A strange combination of a woman and a child
A strange situation stoppin' every twenty miles
Callin' Baton Rouge 

A replay of last night's events
Roll through my mind 
Except a scene or two 
Erased by sweet red wine 
And I see a truck stop sign ahead
So I change lanes 
I need a couple cups of coffee
And a couple dollars change 
Callin' Baton Rouge 

Operator get me on through
I gotta send my love down to Baton Rouge
Hurry up won't you put her on the line 
I want talk to that girl one more time.

Hello Samantha dear, I hope you're feelin' fine 
It won't be long until I'm with you all the time
Until then I'll spend my money up right down to my last dime.
Callin' Baton Rouge.
