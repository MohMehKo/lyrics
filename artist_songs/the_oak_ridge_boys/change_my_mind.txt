I don’t want to lose you 
But even a fool could see
Everyday your love is slipping 
A little bit further away from me.
So I’ll be the one to say goodbye 
Cause your heart’s already gone
Pack my bags and take the midnight train
Unless you say I’m wrong.

[CHORUS:]
Change my mind
Say you couldn’t live without me
Say you’re crazy about me
With a look, with a touch.
Change my mind
I’m looking in your eyes
For the love we left behind
It’s not too late to change my mind.

Something’s come between us
It’s not another lover
One night we just stopped
Trying to please each other.
So if it’s really over
Why can’t I walk away?
Tell me I’m making a big mistake
Beg me to stay.

[CHORUS:]
Give me half a reason
To give it one more try.
We could leave this leaving behind
Change my mind
Say you couldn’t live without me
Say you’re crazy about me
With a look (with a look), with a touch (with a touch)
Change my mind
I’m looking in your eyes
For the love we left behind
(It’s not too late) It’s not too late to change my mind.
O yer, o yer
