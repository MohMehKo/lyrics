Thought I had my life together, 
Things were going so fine
We encountered stormy weather
But we always found the sunshine.
I thought I’d covered everything
Everything that life could bring and more.
But I forgot to close one door.

When Karen comes around
I don’t know what to do.
I doubt everything I’ve found
My heart divides in two.
When Karen goes away
For me it’s never through.
My world turns upside down
When Karen comes around.

Did I plan too far ahead?
I don’t know, it’s hard to tell.
I made my choice, I made my bed
But lately I don’t sleep so well.
I really thought we had it all
Stone by stone I’d built a wall around you,
Oh but then out of the blue.

Karen comes around
And I don’t know what to do.
I doubt everything I’ve found
My heart divides in two.
When Karen goes away
For me it’s never through.
My wall comes tumbling down
When Karen comes around.

Karen comes around
And I don’t know what to do
I doubt everything I’ve found
My heart divides in two.
When Karen goes away
For me it’s never through.
My wall comes tumbling down
When Karen comes around.
