Ever one to run away, ever one to leave
Never one to hang around, never one to grieve.
If love turned into labour I would just resign
Working through the hard times never crossed my mind.

I’m guilty of entering and breaking hearts so dear
I’m guilty of unlawful flight and failing to appear
I’ve committed all the crimes of love, every felony
Now I have but one defence, to plead insanity.

O where can I surrender, I’m tired of being free
I want love to come and make a prisoner out of me
I’m a big offender, o love come capture me
Lock me in your velvet cell and throw away the key.

Events have come full circle now, I spend my nights alone
Where love was once so full and free, love has up and gone
If God should just see fit to send sweet love my way again
I’d die before I’d run away and be like I have been.

Oh where can I surrender, I’m tired of being free
I want love to come and make a prisoner out of me
I’m a big offender, o love come capture me
Lock me in your velvet cell and throw away the key.
Lock me in your velvet cell and throw away the key.
