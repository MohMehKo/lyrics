I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the walls closing in on me 
I never dreamed it would be like this.
When it’s all said and done
When you know that the only one
You have ever loved is gone
That’s how it really is.

[CHORUS:]
I felt the power of love
I thought that that’s all there was
There was nothing as strong as the ties that bind
Woh but I know I was wrong
Baby since you’re gone
I know that nothing 
Nothing can touch you
Like the power of goodbye.

You used to make me feel like a man
You had me believing I was more than I am
There was power in those times we spent together
Wish I had known then what I know now
Wish I had seen it coming somehow
I would have risked my heart for the stormy weather.

[CHORUS:]

[CHORUS:]

I felt the power of love
I thought that that’s all there was
There was nothing as strong as the ties that bind
Woh but I know I was wrong [fading]
