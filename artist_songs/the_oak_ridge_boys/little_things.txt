It's the way you kiss me when we're walkin' down the street 
It's the words you whisper when we're driftin' off to sleep 
A certain way you touch me, the way you say "hello" 
Baby it's the little things that make me love you so.

The way you pour your coffee in the early morning light 
The way you call my name out in the middle of the night 
How you sit for hours singing with the radio 
Baby it's the little things that make me love you so.

It's not the memories or all that we've been through, 
It's not the distant dreams that keep me coming back to you
It's not the promises that keep me warm at night 
It's just the every day, it's just the safe and sound, 
It's just our home sweet home.

And when we're old and grey now and the kids have gone away 
We're alone together I may turn to you and say 
There's something I forgot to tell you and by now I think you'll know 
Baby it's the little things that make me love you so. 
Woah woah, baby it's the little things that make me love you so.

Baby it's the little things that make me love you so, woh, woh
Baby it's the little things that make me love you so, woh, woh, woh
Baby it's the little things that make me love you so, woh, woh, woh,
Baby it's the little things that make me love you so, woh, woh, who.

Walkin' in the park, kissin' in the dark 
The little things that baby makes me feel alright now. 
Baby it's the little things that make me love you
Baby it's the little things that make me love you 
Baby it's the little things that make me love you so.
