As I look around on another day
Sometimes I get so mad seeing the same old game
So many people caught in hopeless situations
I can’t make much sense there’s too much information.
Someone’s always trying to run someone else’s life
Woh, someone’s only trying to make it through the night.

Putting one foot before the other
One step, then another
No map, no sign, taking one heartbeat at a time
It’s a long road in a short life
One foot’s on the other side
We look for love before we die
Taking one heartbeat at a time.

One thing I know, the only thing I’m sure of
There wouldn’t be much point without your love.
On this ship of fools, don’t know where we’re going
Most of what we’re told is not worth the knowing.
Someone’s always trying to sell a new version of the truth
After all the words have gone, all I still believe is you.

In putting one foot before the other
One step, then another
No map, no sign, taking one heartbeat at a time
It’s a long road in a short life
One foot’s on the other side
We look for love before we die
Taking one heartbeat at a time.

We’re putting one foot before the other
One step, then another
No map, no sign, taking one heartbeat at a time.
It’s a long road in a short life
One foot’s on the other side.
We look for love before we die
Taking one heartbeat at a time.
Woh wo woh  no map, no sign, taking one heartbeat at a time
One heartbeat at a time 
We look for love before we die [fading]
