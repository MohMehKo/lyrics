Too many heartaches caused by too many promises made by
Too many lovers in the heat of the night.
Too many teardrops fall on too many pillows shed by
Too many lovers in the heat of the night.

The words I love you are no mystery to me
You’re not the first to dry your eyes.
There ain’t a heart that hasn’t hurt like yours and mine
Torn apart by promises and lies.

Yes love is easy but love is rarely true
It ain’t a lie that true love’s hard to find
So make me an offer, don’t feed me silly lies
No need for hesitation, no need for alibis.

Because too many heartaches caused by too many promises made by
Too many lovers in the heat of the night
Too many teardrops fall on too many pillows shed by
Too many lovers in the heat of the night.

Sometimes I find myself just lying there in bed
Wondering how it’s gonna be this time.
Now if I had a dollar for every time I’d been misled
I’d surely be the richest man alive.
So if you’re looking for a restless heart like mine.
If promises of love are fair, let’s stop wasting time.

Too many heartaches caused by too many promises made by
Too many lovers in the heat of the night.
Too many teardrops fall on too many pillows shed by
Too many lovers in the heat of the night.

Too many heartaches caused by too many promises made by
Too many lovers in the heat of the night.
Too many teardrops fall on too many pillows shed by
Too many lovers in the heat of the night.

Too many heartaches caused by too many promises made by
Too many lovers in the heat of the night.
Too many teardrops fall on too many pillows shed by
Too many lovers in the heat of the night.

Too many heartaches caused by too many promises made by
Too many lovers in the heat of the night.
Too many teardrops fall on too many pillows shed by
Too many lovers in the heat of the night.
