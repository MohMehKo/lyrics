Silver and gold or precious stones don’t mean a thing.
Ah they’ll buy you a thrill 
Or a mansion on a hill
But life won’t change.
It’s a hard one to call
But I measure it all
By the things I can’t afford to lose.

When it comes to your love
That’s something worth holding on to.
If you’re saying goodbye tell me what I can believe in,
Oh what a cost to be lost in a world you’re leaving.

When I search my soul and let everything go
But the things that are tried and true.
When it comes to your love
That’s something worth holding on to.

Tell me the truth
Does it matter to you
What happens to me now?
Don’t tell me you care
Then leave me here feeling so left out.
Cause you know I’ll hold on 
Even after you’ve gone
I wont give up on you

When it comes to your love
That’s something worth holding on to.
If you’re saying goodbye tell me what I can believe in.
Oh what a cost to be lost in a world you’re leaving.

Life’s a hard one to call 
But I measure it all 
By the things I can’t afford to lose. 

When it comes to your love
That’s something worth holding on to.
When it comes to your love
That’s something worth holding on to.
