Don’t give up, don’t give up
Don’t give up, don’t give up.
You’ve gotta know that time is on your side.
Don’t give up, don’t give up
Don’t give up, no, no.
When things get thin 
You’ve got to give in
Just don’t give up.

Now in this world of give and take
One observation you can make
It’s a long hot road until the day you die
But you’ve got plenty on your side
You just take it all in stride
Don’t let the set backs hang you out to dry.

So you just listen here to me
One little problem don’t make three
Your obstacles don’t need a helping hand
If you just take one at a time
You’ll make it easier to climb
And scale that wall into the Promised Land.

Don’t give up, don’t give up
Don’t give up, don’t give up.
You’ve gotta know that time is on your side.
Don’t give up, don’t give up
Don’t give up, no, no.
When things get thin 
You’ve got to give in
Just don’t give up.

Now you may say that I’m a fool
But I say patience is a tool
You’ve got to smell the smoke without fire
Good civil answers are the game
You’ve got no-one but you to blame.
Remember this when you’re down to the wire.

Don’t give up, don’t give up
Don’t give up, don’t give up.
You’ve gotta know that time is on your side.
Don’t give up, don’t give up
Don’t give up, no, no.
When things get thin 
You’ve got to give in
Just don’t give up.

When you see that heavy cloud in front of you
Back off until you see it where the mountain meets the sky.
Recharge yourself until you know just what you’ve got to do
Then settle down with peddle down and fly.

Don’t give up, don’t give up
Don’t give up, don’t give up.
You’ve gotta know that time is on your side.
Don’t give up, don’t give up
Don’t give up, no, no.
When things get thin 
You’ve got to give in
Just don’t give up.

Don’t give up, don’t give up
Don’t give up, don’t give up.
You’ve gotta know that time is on your side.
Don’t give up, don’t give up
Don’t give up, no, no.
When things get thin 
You’ve got to give in
Just don’t give up.

Don’t give up, don’t give up
Don’t give up, don’t give up.
You’ve gotta know that time is on your side.
Don’t give up, don’t give up
Don’t give up, no, no.
Don’t give up, don’t give up, don’t give up, 
Don’t give up, don’t give up, don’t give up.
