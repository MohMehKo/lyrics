When I get tired and a little lonely, 
The worlds turned it’s cold back on me 
When I’m about to swear I ain’t got a friend left to my name 
Instead of sinking a little lower I start making tracks on over 
To a place where the sun shines day and night 
And where I know I’ll hear you say 

[CHORUS:]
Come on in, baby take you coat off, 
Come on in, baby take a load off 
Come on in, baby shake the blues off 
I’m gonna love that frown away 
Come on in, baby put a smile on, 
Come on in, baby tell me what’s wrong 
Come on in, the blues will be long gone 
I’m gonna love your hurt away 

When I feel a lonesome night coming on, 
Every thing I did all day went wrong 
There’s a black cloud following me around and I just can’t get away 
Instead of sinking a little lower I start making tracks on over 
To a place where the sun shines day and night 
And where I know I’ll hear you say 

[CHORUS:]

[CHORUS:]

Come on in, baby take you coat off, 
Come on in, baby take a load off 
Come on in, baby shake the blues off 
I’m gonna love that frown away 
Come on in, baby put a smile on, 
Come on in, baby tell me what’s wrong 
Come on in, the blues will be long gone 
I’m gonna love your hurt away. 

Come on in.
