It'll lead you on, it'll run you off
Hurt twice as long when you're double-crossed
It's hard to trust, this crazy love.
It's a breaking heart at the bitter end
Bouncing back just to fall again
It's winning big or losing touch.

Wo-oh, this crazy love
Wo-oh, this crazy love.

It gives and it takes when it's strong
Nothing takes its place when it's gone
First it's good news and then its good-bye
But the good is worth the tears that you cry.

It'll fly you high; it'll shoot you down
Toss you heart in the lost and found
It pays rough, this crazy love.
It's a game of hearts, the jokerâ€™s wild
A come on look or a tender smile
Can raise your hand or call your bluff.

Wo-oh, this crazy love
Wo-oh, this crazy love.

It'll lead you on, it'll run you off
Hurt twice as long when you're double-crossed
It's hard to trust, this crazy love.
It's a breaking heart at the bitter end
Bouncing back just to fall again
It's winning big or losing touch.

Wo-oh, this crazy love.
Wo-oh, this crazy love.
Wo-oh, this crazy love.
Wo-oh, this crazy love.
Wo-oh, this crazy love.
Wo-oh, this crazy love.
