I'm a little bit wild, a little bit crazy, when it comes to you.
I'm a little bit wild, a little bit crazy, over you.
I don't know why I love you baby, like I do.

When it comes to you I just ain't myself
What I might do next is hard to tell.
Ain't no stopping me, when it comes to you.

Don't care how long it might take me
I ain't giving up. [Steve]
I feel so strong about you baby
Gonna win your love [Joe]

When it comes you I just ain't myself
What I might do next is hard to tell.
Ain't no stopping me when it comes to you.

When it comes you I just ain't myself
What I might do next is hard to tell.
Ain't no stopping me when it comes to you.

I'm a little bit wild, a little bit crazy,
When it comes to you [Duanne]
I'm a little bit wild, a little bit crazy,
When it comes to you. [Steve]
I'm a little bit wild, a little bit crazy,
When it comes to you, yer, yer [Joe]
I'm a little bit wild, a little bit crazy,
When it comes to you. [Richard]
I'm a little bit wild, a little bit crazy,
When it comes to you.
I'm a little bit wild, a little bit crazy,
When it comes to you.
