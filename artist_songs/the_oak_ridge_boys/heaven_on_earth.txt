Traffic’s bumper to bumper, cars and trucks wall to wall
Figured I could either go crazy or give her a call
So I give her a call
Nothing like the sound of her voice, oools me off, calms me down
Makes me wanna climb on the hood of my Chevy and shout
I do believe friends, I do believe I’ve found

[CHORUS:]
Heaven on earth, heaven on earth
A home grown helping of heaven on earth
She looks that look, smiles that smile
I love the way she loves me while
She’s holdin’ my hand, kissin’ my kiss
I guess the only question is
What did I ever do, look at me
What did I ever do to deserve
Heaven on earth?

Don’t know how many million people or how many million souls
Are out there searchin’ for their very own true blue love
To have and to hold.
In the meanwhile here I stand, livin’ large, top of the world.
Got me a woman, when she walks my way I say
Here comes my girl, man, I say her comes my girl.

[CHORUS:]
She’s holdin’ my hand, kissin’ my kiss.
I guess the only question is
What did I ever do, look at me
What did I ever do to deserve
Heaven on earth.

[CHORUS:]
Woo Heaven on earth, heaven on earth
A home grown helping of heaven on earth.
My girl, that’s her, heaven on earth.
Heaven on earth, heaven on earth
A home grown helping of heaven on earth
She looks that look, smiles that smile
Here she comes.
Woo Heaven on earth, heaven on earth
A home grown helping of heaven on earth.
