Please don’t cry, oh my, you’re so blue
But I’m here to help you, beautiful you.
You need someone to give you a love that’s true
Well I’m here to help you, beautiful you.

Beautiful you, you’ll need a man someday,
Beautiful you, you know I’m here to stay
Days go by, oh my, what will you do?
Take me to help you, beautiful you. 

Beautiful you, I’ll never let you go, 
Beautiful you, our love will always grow
Please don’t cry, oh my, what will you do
Take me to help you, beautiful you.
