The call that I made tonight
Was such a long time due
Baby how long since I heard from you?
I don't really know
What's happening here to me
All that I know is that I long to be

Back in your arms again
I need your love all I can get
Whatever it takes
You know I'll be there
Back in your arms
Back in your arms

The last time I spoke to you
You told me that we were through
That you had found that special someone new
Now that I really know
This feeling of being free
I know that you know where I long to be

Back in your arms again
I need your love all I can get
Whatever it takes
You know I'll be there
Back in your arms

[Repeat Chorus 2x]
