The mystery of you and me 
Is coloured blue on blue
We once said more than we could give
We couldn’t see it through.

You won’t believe these words from me
But still they’re mine to say
I will always love you 
In my own crazy way.

I’ve tried to keep my sanity
By being someone else
Someone that you
Could hold on to
I only fooled myself.

I knew the part
But in my heart
The role I couldn’t play
But I will always love you
In my own crazy way.

I know I didn’t do the little things
That could make a woman’s heart sing
Forgive me.
Darling if I brought you any pain
I’m trying to explain
In my heart I was always true.

But memories of you and me
Are written on the wing
And sometimes girl
I’d give the world
To do it all again.

And if you need 
To call on me
Woh, I won’t be far away
I will always love you 
In my own crazy way.
