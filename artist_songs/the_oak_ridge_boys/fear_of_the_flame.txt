There’s a time that I recall 
When I tried to give it all
And got burned by the flame 
That I thought would keep me warm
So I promised myself then 
That I’d never care again
And I would not forget that roses have thorns.

[CHORUS:]
Don’t go near the fire it will hurt you, it will burn you
Love and desire only lead to pain.
The heart that gives in becomes ashes in the wind
O but you came along and cured my fear of the flame.

I learned from your love 
Just how wrong I was
When you came along 
And carried all my fears away
So gentle and tender, 
Cinder by cinder
I hardly remember the fool who used to say.

[CHORUS:]

With your love I know
Through your eyes I see
It’s a lonely, lonely heart 
Who’d believe.

[CHORUS:]

[CHORUS:]

[CHORUS fading]
