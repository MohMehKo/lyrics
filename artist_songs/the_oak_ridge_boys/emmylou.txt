Oh ho, Emmylou. Emmylou, 
What in the world can I do?
Spend my life just trying to get close to you
Heaven is a girl named Emmylou.

Trailed you out to Houston 
To a hotel downtown, 
Followed you down the corridor 
But you never turned around.
But one of your big old bodyguards
Suggested that I leave
He didn't seem to appreciate 
the patch upon my sleeve.
That read 
Oh. ho, Emmylou. Emmylou, 
Just a fan who’s in love with you.
Spend most of my time trying to talk to you
Heaven is a girl named Emmylou.

I heard you went to LA
So I hitched myself a ride
California dreaming of me 
Right there by your side.
Out at the Palomino Club
I watched you all night long
Until you looked right at me
In the words of your last song.
I asked you for your guitar pick 
That’s all that I could say
Then the limo did appear
And took the queen away.

Oh ho, Emmylou. Emmylou, 
What in the world can I do?
Spend my life just trying to get close to you
Heaven is a girl named Emmylou.
Well I love Olivia’s eyes
And Ronstadt‘s really nice
But heaven is a girl named Emmylou.
