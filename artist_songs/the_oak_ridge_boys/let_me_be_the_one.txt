Many's the time I have looked in the water
And had no reflection to show.
Oh, and many's the time
I have stood at the crossroad
Not knowing which way to go.

Many's the time someone lay close beside me
And I don't remember her name.
They'll say that I'm just a smile at a moment
But that was before you came.

You're the one in a million
You're the one, you're the one
You're the one in a million I see
You're the one in a million
You're the one, you're the one
You're the one in a million for me.

Now all of the others were places to go to
when I had nowhere to sleep.
Well I never made any promises to them
None they'd expect me to keep.

You're the one in a million
You're the one, you're the one
You're the one in a million I see
You're the one in a million
You're the one, you're the one
You're the one in a million for me.

Well you're the one in a million
You're the one, you're the one
You're the one in a million I see
You're the one in a million
You're the one, you're the one
You're the one in a million for me.

Well you're the one in a million
You're the one, you're the one
You're the one in a million I see
You're the one in a million
You're the one, you're the one
You're the one in a million for me.
