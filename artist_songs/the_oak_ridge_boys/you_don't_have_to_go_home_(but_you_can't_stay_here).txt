[Verse 1:]
Lord knows I'm guilty
Of livin' my life
Like there's always tomorrow
For making things right

But our days are numbered
like the hairs on our head
No man knows the hour
he'll shake hands with death.

[Chorus:]
You don't have to go home
And live up in Glory
But you can't stay forever down here.
For all in this world that's uncertain,
one thing is clear.
You don't have to go home but you can't stay here.

[Verse 2:]
There's a master Time Keeper
Who died on the cross;
and it breaks His heart knowing
Hell's gain is his loss.

But if your name is written
in the Lamb's book of life,
You'll know where you're going
if He calls you tonight.

[Chorus]
