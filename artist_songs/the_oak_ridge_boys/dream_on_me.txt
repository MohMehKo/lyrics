I don’t know how such big ideas
Can fit in your pretty head
Sometimes I can’t believe my ears
When I hear what you just said.
Somebody else might think you’re crazy
But I know that they’re wrong.
Dream on, dream on.

You gotta wild imagination
A little left of reality
A water colour vision
That you’ gotta believe to see
I’d never want to change you baby
The only thing I want is when you
Dream on, dream on me.

My chest you rest your head on
These hands you can rely on
When you need to find someone to lean on
To dream on, you can
Dream on me.

I’ll walk in the shadows 
That don’t bother me
I don’t mind riding shotgun
Baby here’s the keys
Just hit the gas and take me
Where only you heart can go
Is when you dream on, dream on me.

My chest you rest your head on
These hands you can rely on
When you need to find someone to lean on
To dream on, you can
Dream on me.

My chest you rest your head on
These hands you can rely on
When you need to find someone to lean on
To dream on, you can
Dream on me.
