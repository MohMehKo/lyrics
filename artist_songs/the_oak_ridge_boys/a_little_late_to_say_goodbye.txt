If your mind is set on leaving
I wish it could have happened years ago
Is there no better ending 
Than breaking all the hearts that love you so.
Think of what your doing
Is your freedom worth the price we’ll have to pay.
After all the trying times you survived
Don’t you think it’s a little late to say goodbye?

Don’t you think it’s a little late to say goodbye
Start over in the middle of our lives
We’ll be turning years of love into a lie
Don’t you think it’s a little late to say goodbye

You say you’re feeling trapped
Held back by a golden wedding band
Gotta make your move now
Cause time is slipping through your hands.
What happened to forever
Did it only last until you changed your mind?
We’ve been in love too long to let it die
Don’t you think it’s a little late to say goodbye? 

Don’t you think it’s a little late to say goodbye?
Start over in the middle of our lives
We’ll be turning years of love into a lie
Don’t you think it’s a little late to say goodbye?
