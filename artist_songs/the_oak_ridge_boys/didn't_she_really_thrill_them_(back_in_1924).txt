She sits there on her front porch every day at 4 o’clock
Waving at the traffic that runs up and down the block
Her face and hands are wrinkled and her grey hair almost shines
Over 50 years have come and gone since she was in her prime.

A high school girl in blue jeans stops each Thursday afternoon
They talk about life and love and phases of the moon
She lets the girl try on her gown she’s kept for all these years
She talks about when she was young, her old eyes filled with tears.

Didn’t she really thrill them back in 1924
Young men fell in love with her
When she came through the door
Every dance was taken
Still they’d ask for just one more
Oh she stole their hearts away in 1924

She holds a photo album as she rocks there in her chair
Here’s the men she almost married – they all look so debonair
She remembers all the faces and the night each one proposed
It makes her feel so young again as her old eyes slowly close.

The papers never said much when the old maid passed away
For the man who drove the moving-van it was just another day
The florist never understood when the young girl left the store
Just why she sent a wreath that said from the class of ’24.

Didn’t she really thrill them back in 1924
Young men fell in love with her
When she came through the door
Every dance was taken
Still they’d ask for just one more
Oh she stole their hearts away in 1924.

Didn’t she really thrill them back in 1924
Young men fell in love with her
When she came through the door
Every dance was taken
Still they’d ask for just one more
Oh she stole their hearts away in 1924.
