All the boys called her Easy
Took her to drive-in movies
And bragged about the good times they had
The girls talked about her
And had parties without her
And wondered why a girl would let herself go so bad.

They called her Easy, Easy
And laughed about how easy she was
They called her Easy, Easy
They said she was easy to love.

They didn't care if she was lonely
They didn't care if she was only reaching out
The only way she could
They didn't try to understand her
And this small town talk branded her
With names that said she wasn't any good.

They called her Easy, Easy
And laughed about how easy she was
They called her Easy, Easy
They said she was easy to love.

Easy's child came early
It seemed in such a hurry
For one who'd go through life without a name.
Easy's eyes were brighter
Than the moonlight on the water
When they handed her the child no one would claim.

My friends thought I was crazy
To love Easy and her baby
They said I was a fool, but I just smiled
'Cause love is what you make it
Any way you finally take it
It's the only thing that makes life worthwhile.

Now she's Easy, she’s Easy
And life is not as lonely as it was
Because she's Easy, she's Easy
She's so easy to love.
Now she's Easy, she’s Easy
And life is not as lonely as it was.
