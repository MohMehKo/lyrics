The good Lord made man, then he rested for a little while
Said look what I've done, ain't he pretty, then he cracked a smile
I'll watch him grow, I'll hear him talk, learn to love and fight
But when he's had his fill of these I'll walk him through the night

To someplace green (someplace green)
Someplace nice (someplace nice)
Someplace that I (ooh-ooh) call paradise
Growin' greener in the rain
Waitin' there for man to claim

The good Lord looked down on the earth one afternoon and frowned
Said man ain't learned an awful lot since I carved him out of ground
He's built a lot of steeples of clay and rocks and sand
But he hasn't learned to get along with his fellow man

And someplace green (someplace green)
Someplace nice (someplace nice)
Someplace that I (ooh-ooh) call paradise
Is growin' greener in the rain
Waitin' there for man to claim

The good Lord's been around a while, he'll turn a tee at least
And I guess he'll be around a while, when time and tide have ceased
Lookin' down from somewhere, tryin' hard to find
If man has earned his paradise the other side of time

And someplace green (someplace green)
Someplace nice (someplace nice)
Someplace that he calls paradise
Is growin' greener in the rain
Waitin' there for man to claim
Yes growin' green, green, green in the rai-ai-ain
Waitin' there for man to claim
