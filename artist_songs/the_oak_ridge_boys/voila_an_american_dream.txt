Well they moved away from the farms they did not own
To live happily ever after on a G.I. loan.
The future was looking bright back in ‘52
‘Neath the shadow of atomic bombs and the baby boom.

You could take a walk downtown without being afraid
And hey, who’s the better centre fielder, Manual or Mace?
There was chicken in every pot even when times were lean
We thought everybody had a shot at the American dream.

Every mother was supposed to look like Donna Reed
Father knew what was best for you and me
Our lives were etched on 8mm frames
As we grew up in houses that all looked the same.

But there was trouble on the other side of town
It was a time when people began to stand their ground.
Arm in arm they stood as they cried “let freedom reign”
Everybody wanted the share the American dream.

Dream on children, dream on,
Don’t let anybody tell you the dream is gone.
As long as there’s a God above 
Keep on praying we never wake up,
Keep on dreaming the American dream.

There’s medals on the wall I got back in ‘69
And the quarter acre piece of heaven I call mine
As I turn off the cable and put my babies to bed
I kiss them goodnight and whisper under my breath.

Dream on children, dream on
Don’t let anybody tell you the dream is gone.
As long as there’s a God above 
Keep on praying we never wake up
Keep on dreaming the American dream.
Ooo, keep on dreaming the American dream.
