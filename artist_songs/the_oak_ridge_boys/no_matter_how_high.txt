When I was a young boy I would dream about life
And wonder just how sweet it would be
But baby I got lucky when I met you that night
Now you'll always have this promise from me.

No matter how high I get,
I'll always look up to you,
You’ll always be number one,
I'll settle for number two.
You've always been there for me
Baby, I must confess
I'll always look up to you
No matter how high I get.

Up here on the mountain it gets crazy sometimes,
So crazy I don't know what to do.
When I've had it up to here with all of their lies
I can count on you to tell me the truth.

No matter how high I get,
I'll always look up to you,
You’ll always be number one,
I'll settle for number two.
You've always been there for me
Baby, I must confess
I'll always look up to you
No matter how high I get.

You are the one that turned me around,
You help me keep my feet on the ground.

No matter how high I get,
I'll always look up to you,
You’ll always be number one,
I'll settle for number two
You've always been there for me
Baby, I must confess
I'll always look up to you
No matter how high. 

No matter how high I get,
I'll always look up to you,
You’ll always be number one,
I'll settle for number two
You've always been there for me
Baby, I must confess
I'll always look up to you
No matter how high. 

No matter how high I get,
I'll always look up to you,
You’ll always be number one,
I'll settle for number two.
You've always been there for me
Baby, I must confess
I'll always look up to you
No matter how high I get.
