Woke up this morning and I knew I’d be late
Somehow it came as no surprise.
I saw the way she was looking at me
I saw no mercy in her eyes.
She gives me love without mercy
Her arms don’t wanna let go
Love without mercy
Am I complaining? Mercy no.

I have no trouble sleeping at night
When I’ve got a problem on my mind
She gives me something precious and sweet
It solves that problem every time.
She gives me love without mercy
Her arms don’t wanna let go
Love without mercy
Am I complaining? Mercy no.

When I feel like this world wants no part of me
She knows I need love and not sympathy
Love without mercy
Her heart don’t wanna let go
Love without mercy
Am I complaining? Mercy, mercy, mercy, mercy, 
Love without mercy 
Her arms don’t wanna let go
Love without mercy.
Am I complaining? Mercy no.
I say, am I complaining? Mercy no.
