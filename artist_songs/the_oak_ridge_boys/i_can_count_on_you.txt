You can say the word and warm the day
You can make the world spin the other way.
Some things we don’t have to see to believe
Faith is the part of love that runs so deep.

I can count on you, I can trust you to be
Everything you are and that’s everything I’ll ever need.
I can close my eyes and let your heart lead the way.
I can count on you, I can count on you.

I know those loving eyes have seen me make mistakes
But in your heart you always look the other way.
So much tenderness, it’s hard to understand
But I know my feelings are safe in your hands.

I can count on you, I can trust you to be
Every thing you are and that’s everything I’ll ever need.
I can close my eyes and let your heart lead the way.
I can count on you, I can count on you.
I can count on you, I can count on you.
I can count on you.
