One day I decided I would go
And wet my line down at the fishing hole
Found you sitting there in a calico dress
On the banks, bare feeting hanging over the edge.

It was July hot, about a hundred and ten
That river looked inviting so we jumped right in
We’d only been friends up until that summer
But that all changed the moment we went under.

Something in the water that we did not see
Reached up and grabbed a hold of you and me
Jumped in to cool off but we came out hotter
Lord have mercy must be something in the water.

We started smiling then we started laughing
We swam around, kicking and a splashing
Not sure exactly just what it was, but we
Dove in the river and fell in love.

Look at the surface, you don’t see nothing
But underneath, Lord, it’s really something
One little kiss was all it took
Came here to fish and we sure got hooked.

Something in the water that we did not see
Reached up and grabbed a hold of you and me
Jumped in to cool off but we came out hotter
Lord have mercy must be something in the water.

I believe that I could make a million bucks
If I could only find a way to bottle it up.

Something in the water that we did not see
Reached up and grabbed a hold of you and me
Jumped in to cool off but we came out hotter
Lord have mercy must be something in the water.
Lord have mercy must be something in the water.
