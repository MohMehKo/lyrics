Many’s the time that I’ve stood amazed
At the warmth in your eyes and the smile on your face
And many’s the night I thank my lucky stars
That I’m where I am and you’re who you are.
I know when we touch in the dark
There can only be one love, one you
It’s as simple as that, one love, one you.
I know I owe all this happiness to 
One love, one you.

This world hears too many promises made
That are too hard to keep and too easy to break
So my one, only one, that I’m making is this.
I’ll be with you wherever that is.
I know as long as I live
There can only be one love, one you.
It’s as simple as that, one love, one you.
I know I owe all this happiness to
one love, one you.

Now the world only needs one sun in the sky
Only one moon to light up the night.
As for me, all that I need is one love, one you, 
It’s as simple as that, one love, one you.
I know I owe all this happiness to
One love, one you.
One love, one you.
One love, one you.
Oh yeah,
One love, one you.
