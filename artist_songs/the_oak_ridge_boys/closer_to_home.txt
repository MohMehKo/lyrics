He simply ate and drank my mornin' paper
Each day while it's dark
Then hustles off to greet folks
At the Highway 9 Walmart

His daughter flew back in last year
With their two boys, twelve and ten
Then she skipped town and left him
And his wife to care for them

It used to be Superman
Johnny Benson and George Jones
But lately I've been findin'
All my heroes closer to home

Every time I see a squad car
A-passin' by our house
I think our brave hearts behind badges
Ready when a call goes out

Seems since 9/11
It's been on my mind
How they wake up every mornin'
And put their lives on the line

It used to be Superman
Johnny Benson and George Jones
But lately I've been findin'
All my heroes closer to home

Got a life, found the lovin'
Got some children of my own
And some nights I tuck them in and stand there
In the dark alone

And I think back all my childhood
And the sweet times that I had
Now I see the sacrifice it took
From my Mom and Dad

It used to be Superman
Johnny Benson and George Jones
But lately I've been findin'
All my heroes closer to home
But lately I've been findin'
All my heroes closer to home
