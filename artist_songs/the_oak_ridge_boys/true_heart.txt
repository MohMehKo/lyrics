Some people spend night and day
Making money they can hide away.
They never know what they're working for,
All they think about is making more.

And every time the world spins round
There's a few more hearts that can't be found
Cause they never had nothing to hold on to
The way that I'm holding you.

[CHORUS:]
All I ever need is your true heart
Next to me when it's cold and dark.
All I need to keep from falling apart
Is the beat of your true heart.

Some people spend day and night
Trying to love everybody in sight
They never know what love is for
All they think about is keeping the score.

And every time the world spins round
There's a few more hearts that can't be found
Cause they never had nothing to hold on to
The way that I'm holding you.

[CHORUS]
Your true heart.

No they never had nothing to hold on to
The way that I'm holding you.

[CHORUS]

[CHORUS]
