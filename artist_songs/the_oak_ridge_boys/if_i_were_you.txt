You’ve got it made; you’ve got real love.
Something you don’t find every day.
But you come and go, as free as the wind blows.
I wouldn’t settle down too soon.
If I were you.

If I were you, I’d be satisfied (I’d be satisfied)
Until the grass is greener on the other side.
If I were you, I’d stay by her side
I’d be running wild, I would never leave her
That’s what I would do, if I were you.

You’ve got it made; you’ve got no one
You don’t have no strings to tie you down.
Wow, but someone to trust, someone to lean on
That’s something I would hold on to
If I were you.

If I were you, I’d be satisfied (I’d be satisfied)
I’m sure the grass is greener on the other side.
If I were you, I’d stay by her side
I’d be running wild, I would never leave her
That’s what I would do, if I were you.

O ho, If I were you, 
I’d know what I would do.
If I were in your shoes.

O ho, If I were you, 
O, I’d be running wild.
But every night I’d be satisfied,
I wouldn’t change one single thing,
If I were you.
