O when you feel that you ain’t got a friend
Come by here, come by here.
I’ll open up my heart and I’ll let you in
Come by here, come by here.

[CHORUS:]
Woh come by here, come by here.
Come by here yer, come by here.
Wo woh come by here.

When you’re lown gets too much to bear
Come by here, come by here.
In me, you’ve got someone who cares.
Come by here, come by here.

[CHORUS]

I’ll make you wake right
I’ll make your first light
I will be with whether you’re wrong or right
I will, oh I will, oh yes I will, oh yes I will.
Come by here.

[CHORUS]

If your world seems dark and dreary
Come by here, come by here.
I can brighten it up now, if you’ll just let me.
Come by here, come by here.

[CHORUS]

I will make you wake up a little bit brighter
And I will your load just a little bit lighter.
I’ll be your friend, wow, your closest kin
And I will be with you till the bitter end.
Why don’t you come by here, come by here.
Come by here yer, come by here.
Wo woh come by here, Wo woh come by here.

[CHORUS]
