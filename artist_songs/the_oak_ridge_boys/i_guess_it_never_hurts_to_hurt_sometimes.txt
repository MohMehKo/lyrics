Sometimes I feel the wave
Of a past break in my mind
And I know it's gone for good
And it makes me want to cry.
Is this all we get to keep
As the years go rolling by?
Just a memory
For all the days gone by.

Oh you're always in my heart
And you're often on my mind.
I will never let it die
Just as long as I'm alive.
Sometimes it makes me sad
That we never said goodbye.
Well I guess it never hurts
To hurt sometimes.

You try and hold on to the moment
But time won't let you stay
But for every step you take
You lose something on the way.
You can't look forward to tomorrow
And still hold on to yesterday.
Oh I hope that you can hear me
When I'm saying.

Oh you're always in my heart
And you're often on my mind.
I will never let it die
Just as long as I'm alive.
Sometimes it makes me sad
That we never said goodbye.
Well I guess it never hurts
To hurt sometimes.

Oh you're always in my heart (always in my heart)
And you're often on my mind (often on my mind).
I will never let it die
Just as long as I'm alive.
Sometimes it makes me sad
That we never said goodbye.
Well I guess it never hurts
To hurt sometimes.
No I guess it never hurts
To hurt sometimes.
