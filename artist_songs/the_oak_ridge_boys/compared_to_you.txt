Compared to my father I’m a college boy
Who never learned to saw a straight line.
Compared to my mother I’m a sinner
Who never saw the light.
But I read my bible every day,
I worked my hands in wood,
I ain’t always done my best but I’ve done the best I could.

[CHORUS:]
Compared to you I am Appalachian south
When I hear those sweet words like peaches in your mouth
I know that your roots run underneath this clay
To the place that makes a dreamer never wanna run away.
Where love is rare,
Love that’s true.
I ain’t never met a woman in my life
That compared to you.

Compared to my brother I’m a seeker
Who just wanted way too much.
Compared to my sister I’m a loner
Who is livin’ out of touch
And I’ve got nowhere else to be.
Would you like to take a walk
Or just sit here and let me hear you talk?

Compared to you I am Appalachian south
When I hear those sweet words like peaches in your mouth
You talk with a drawl and I talk with a twang
But underneath it all we both mean the same thing.
Love is rare,
Love that’s true.
I ain’t never met a woman in my life
That compared to you.

Well now that you know all of that
Do you think that we could maybe close this gap?
