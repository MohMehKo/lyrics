When I get off of this mountain, you know where I want to go? 
Straight down the Mississippi river, to the Gulf of Mexico 
To Lake Charles, Louisiana, little Bessie, girl that I once knew 
She told me just to come on by, if there's anything she could do 

Up on Cripple Creek she sends me 
If I spring a leak she mends me 
I don't have to speak, she defends me 
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one 

Good luck had just stung me, to the race track I did go 
She bet on one horse to win and I bet on another to show 
The odds were in my favor, I had 'em five to one 
When that nag to win came around the track, sure enough she had won 

Up on Cripple Creek she sends me 
If I spring a leak she mends me 
I don't have to speak, she defends me 
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one 

I took up all of my winnings, and I gave my little Bessie half 
And she tore it up and threw it in my face, just for a laugh 
Now there's one thing in the whole wide world, I sure would like to see 
That's when that little love of mine, dips her doughnut in my tea 

Up on Cripple Creek she sends me 
If I spring a leak she mends me 
I don't have to speak, she defends me 
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one 

Now me and my mate were back at the shack, we had Spike Jones on the box 
She said, "I can't take the way he sings, but I love to hear him talk" 
Now that just gave my heart a throb, to the bottom of my feet 
And I swore and I took another pull, my Bessie can't be beat 

Now there's a flood out in California and up north it's freezing cold 
And this living on the road is getting pretty old 
So I guess I'll call up my big mama, tell her I'll be rolling in 
But you know, deep down, I'm kind of tempted 
To go and see my Bessie again. 

Up on Cripple Creek she sends me 
If I spring a leak she mends me 
I don't have to speak, she defends me 
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one
