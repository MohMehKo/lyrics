Last night I woke from a dream
Or maybe I was just imagining
I found myself whispering
Come to me, wow, come to me.
I guess I just fell apart
When I couldn’t feel you there in the dark
I wanted you then.

Until you’re back in my arms again.
Until you’re back in my arms again.

Oh darling if you were here
One by one I’d dry each tear
Oh all that you would hear
Until you walk through that door
And love is here like it was before
These missing you nights won’t end.

Until you’re back in my arms again.

Please say we made a mistake
And we are sharing the same heartbreak
Darling then I can hardly wait
Until you walk through that door
And love is here like it was before
These missing you nights won’t win.

Until you’re back in my arms again.
Baby, come back baby.
Until you’re back in my arms again.
Baby, come back baby.
Until you’re back in my arms again.
Baby, come back baby.
Until you’re back in my arms again.
Baby, come back baby.
Until you’re back in my arms again [fading]
