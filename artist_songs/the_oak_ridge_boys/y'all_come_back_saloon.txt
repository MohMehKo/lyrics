She played tambourine with a silver jingle
and she must have known the word to at least a million tunes,
but the one most requested by the man she knew as cowboy
was the late night benediction at the y'all come back saloon.

In a voice soft and trembling,
she'd sing her song to cowboy as a smokey halo circled round her raven hair.
And all the fallen angels and pinball playing rounders
stopped the games that they'd been playing for the losers evening prayer.

Faded love and faded memories how they linger in her mind.
miles and years played the cowboy like and old melody out of tune and out of time.

Every night in the shadows thinking back on Amarillo,
he'd dream of better days and ask for faded love,
lifting high his glass in honor of the lady and her song,
he paid his check then lonely walked the broken cowboy home.

Faded love and faded memories how they linger in her mind.
miles and years played the cowboy like and old melody out of tune and out of time.
Faded love and faded memories how they linger in her mind.
miles and years played the cowboy like and old melody out of tune and out of time.
