Some people say, that this old time religion
is just a thing of the past,
But in this modern age that we're livin',

It's the only thing that will last.

Now you may think I'm a little old fashioned,
Well friend, that's alright with me,
'Cause I'm so glad that I am a Christian,

And from sin I have been set free.

I know, I know, there's no doubt about it
He's real in my heart, and I'm gonna shout it,
I know, I know, my sins are forgiven

And I'm on my way to a place thats called heaven.

Not long ago, at an old fashioned meeting,
I knelt on my knees there in prayer.
He lifted my burdens and shackles fell from me,

And his presence was so real everywhere.

Now that the load I carry is lighter,
and He's changed the grey skies to blue,
My steps are now higher for I have this assurance,

that His sweet love will carry me through.

Come go with me to that land over yonder,
He's prepared for the pure and the true,
It's a place where sickness and death can not enter,

I'm going, brother, how about you?

Maybe today, maybe tomorrow,
He'll return in robes of pure white,
I'm packing up now, getting my things together,
