A '57 Chevy, red and white
American beauty
Levi blue jeans twistin' all night
American beauty

California girls, Rocky Mountain High
A Texas star in a cowboy's eyes
Shinin' like a diamond from sea to sea
American beauty, American beauty

A Zebco fishing pole fishin' downstream
American beauty
Strummin' on a '48 D-18
American beauty

Hot dogs, baseball, popcorn, football
A cheer for victory
NA SCAR race car number three
American beauty, American beauty

From north to south
From coast to coast
You can see it everywhere you go

Miles of wheat fields rolling to the skies
American beauty
Great white spaceship, enterprise
American beauty

Stampede of buffalo, sitting bull Geronimo
An eagle on wing
From Alabama with a banjo on my knee
American beauty, American beauty

She stands in the harbor in the city of dreams
American beauty
Prettiest face I've ever seen
American beauty

And she holds a torch and she won't let go
I love her with all my heart and soul
I'd give my life to keep her free
American beauty, American beauty
American beauty, American beauty
