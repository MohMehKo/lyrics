Hold me closely, hold me softly
Don’t let me fall on my own,
Love me gently, don’t love me at all
I’ll get back on my feet right after I fall.

There is a path in this place called my life
Don’t know if I can travel alone
Need someone to take me by my hand
Lead me safely to the promised land.

So hold me closely, hold me softly
Don’t let me fall on my own,
Love me gently, don’t love me at all
I’ll get back on my feet right after I fall. 

Now in life’s shadows we appear afraid
But there will be light shine down on us someday
Gracefully we’re sighing, we’ve nothing to hide
We’ll meet again in the by and by.
