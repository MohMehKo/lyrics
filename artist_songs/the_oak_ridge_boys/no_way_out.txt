Yes I really saw her, 
What was I supposed to do?
Yes, she was my lover 
Long before I knew you.

Love is a place you’ve been, 
Ten million miles around.
When you fall a long way in, 
Darling there’s no way out.

Yes she’s still as pretty, 
Yes her eyes are that blue.
Yes there’s still a trace there 
Of the feeling we knew.

Love is a place you’ve been, 
Ten million miles around.
When you fall a long way in, 
Darling there’s no way out.

Oh but how could you ever think 
She could be anything more than old memories?
What about all our dreams
How can I make you be sure, sure about me,
Sure about these moments together
These nights that we’ve cried,
These roads to forever, these feelings inside?

When love is a place you’ve been, 
Ten million miles around.
When you fall a long way in, 
Darling there’s no way out.
When you fall a long way in, 
Darling there’s no way out.
