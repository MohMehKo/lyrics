I was just sixteen
And all caught up
In the magic of her blue eyes
She was the girl of my dreams
And I wanted so bad
To ask her if she would be mine.
Well life can be cruel
She left me feeling like a fool
Picking up all of the pieces.

[CHORUS:]
You don’t forget a feeling like that,
It lives in your heart and lasts forever.
It makes you who you are
One moment in time is all that it takes
To suddenly change the world around you.
No you just can’t forget
A feeling like that.

Once burned, twice shy
Afraid that love had passed by
What were the chances we’d meet
Out of the blue
With one look I knew
She was the angel to make me complete
And with one perfect smile
And a more perfect kiss
She took me all the way to heaven.

[CHORUS:]

There are some things you just can’t explain
Like a rainbow just after the rain
Like the tears that I cried when you smiled
And told me you were having our child.

You don’t forget a feeling like that,
It lives in your heart and lasts forever.
It makes you who you are
One moment in time is all that it takes
To suddenly change the world around you.
No you just can’t forget, 
No you just can’t forget a feeling like that.
