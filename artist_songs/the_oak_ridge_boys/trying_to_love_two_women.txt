Trying to love two women is like a ball and chain
Trying to love two women is like a ball and chain
Sometimes the pleasure ain't worth the strain
It's a long old grind, and it tires your mind.

Trying to hold two women is tearing me apart
Trying to hold two women is tearing me apart
One's got my money, the other's got my heart
It's a long old grind, and it tires your mind.

When you try to please two women, you can't please yourself
When you try to please two women, you can't please yourself
At best it's only half good; a man can't stock two shelves
It's a long old grind, and it tires your mind.

Trying to love two women is like a ball and chain
Trying to love two women is like a ball and chain
Sometimes the pleasure ain't worth the strain
It's a long old grind, and it tires your mind.

Sometimes the pleasure ain't worth the strain
It's a long old grind, and it tires your mind,
It's a long old grind, and it tires your mind.
