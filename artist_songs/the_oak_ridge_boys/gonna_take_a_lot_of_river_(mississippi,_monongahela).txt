I ain't gonna ride no rail or hitchhike down no highway
I ain't going nowhere feeling the way I do.
Because my baby's long gone and nothings going my way
I'm gonna let this muddy water just wash away my blues.

It’s gonna take a lot of river,
To keep this broken heart afloat,
Gonna take a lot of river
Running all the live long day,
Gonna take the Mississippi, the Monongahela and the Ohio,
Gonna take a lot of river
To wash these blues away.

Well, I wish I was tug boat pushing and pulling them barges along
Moving on the water with a heart made of iron and steel
There wouldn't be no women who could ever take my loving and do me wrong
I could work all day with nothing in the world to feel.

It’s gonna take a lot of river,
To keep this broken heart afloat,
Gonna take a lot of river
Running all the live long day,
Gonna take the Mississippi, the Monongahela and the Ohio,
Gonna take a lot of river
To wash these blues away.

Is she in New Orleans
Is she a cajun queen
I wonder what she's doing now
But if I know her she's got rings and furs, 
Struggling along somehow
Struggling along somehow.

It’s gonna take a lot of river,
To keep this broken heart afloat,
Gonna take a lot of river
Running all the live long day,
Gonna take the Mississippi, the Monongahela and the Ohio,
Gonna take a lot of river
To wash these blues away. 

It’s gonna take a lot of river,
To keep this broken heart afloat,
Gonna take a lot of river
Running all the live long day,
Gonna take the Mississippi, the Monongahela and the Ohio,
Gonna take a lot of river
To wash these blues away.
It’s gonna take a lot of river
To wash these blues away.
