Things are obsolete before you get them home
They’re out of style the day you put ‘em on.
A bigger this, a faster that
If that’s really where it’s at
It makes me wanna make my world

[CHORUS:]
Smaller like the town where I was raised
Slower, an easy gentle pace
Fewer, things to take up space
There’s higher, there’s wider, there’s taller, but for me
Better isn’t bigger, it’s smaller.

In this frantic and expanding universe
You gotta get ahead, you gotta finish first
It’s gone too far, I’m spread too thin
I’ve got to find myself again
I’d like to see my circle grow.

[CHORUS:]

When I follow my own heart 
It’s like the sound of a different drum
But if I listen I start to see my cares become

[CHORUS:]
