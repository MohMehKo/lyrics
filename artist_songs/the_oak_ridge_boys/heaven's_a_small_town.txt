They say heaven waits for the righteous
A road to redemption – that’s what life is
Somewhere down the blue highway I found paradise.
Heaven’s a small town; heaven’s a small town.

Streets ain’t lined with gold, just the white lines.
No pearly gates, just a stop sign.
I found my angel here in a pair of tight blue jeans.
Heaven’s a small town; heaven’s a small town.

It’s a Sunday morning every day
I pray my soul is here to stay
It’s a small town
Heaven’s a small town; heaven’s a small town. 

Where every good old boy is a good son 
And every good old girl, she’s a fine one.
Everybody knows your name, everybody waves.
Heaven’s a small town; heaven’s a small town. 

It’s a Sunday morning every day
I pray my soul is here to stay 
It’s a small town.
Heaven’s a small town.

Even poor old sinners like me 
Find a second chance.
Heaven’s a small town, 
Heaven’s a small town
Heaven’s a small town, 
Heaven’s a small town. 

Heaven’s a small town, 
Heaven’s a small town
Heaven’s a small town.
