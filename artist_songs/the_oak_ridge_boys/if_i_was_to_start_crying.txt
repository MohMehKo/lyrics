I sent you candy and a dozen roses
I put my heart into a card three pages long
And now here I sit waiting getting over that Moses
For the answer I’ve been fearing all along.

Now I knew there were wicked women in the city
Who scattered shattered dreams like fools gold on the ground
I just didn’t know that they would be so heartbreak pretty
Or that one single icy laugh could cut me down.

Because I’ve always tried to keep my pride
There’s one last desperation measure I haven’t tried.
If I was to start crying, show my innermost feelings
If I was to break down on my bended knees and just plead my case.

Would it thaw your frozen heart a little?
Would you show some compassion?
Would you only feel pity and then compelled to turn me away.
Would you only feel pity and turn me away.

My walls catch all my anger
Your satin perfumed pillows catch my tears
Oh how I wish tonight that I could be that stranger
Whose hearing all your same old lies through brand new ears.

Because I’ve always tried to keep my pride
There’s one last desperation measure I haven’t tried.
If I was to start crying, show my innermost feelings
If I was to break down on my bended knees and just plead my case.

Would it thaw your frozen heart a little?
Would you show some compassion?
Would you only feel pity and then compelled to turn me away.
Would you only feel pity and turn me away.
Would you only feel pity and send me on my way.
