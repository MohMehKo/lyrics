5 o’clock this morning
The night is giving in.
I come home without warning
And quietly let myself in.
And as I watch you sleeping
I see the trace of a smile.
I know that I’m in your dreams somewhere
And that you still care.

[CHORUS:]
And in a tender moment like this
When all I can hear is you breathing.
In a tender moment like this
You know you’ve got me believing
That loving you is all there is.
In a tender moment like this.

Seven days that I’ve been away
Are seven too many for me,
But you know that I’ve got to play
It’s me they’re paying to see.
And as I watch you sleeping
You slowly open your eyes.
That crowd fades to a distant roar
And I’m home once more.

[CHORUS:]

All of my life I’ve been burning
With a fire that’s swept me alone
But how I would trade every song, every place
For this one moment alone.

[CHORUS:]

That loving you is all there is.
In a tender moment like this.
