When I was young I was sure I never could grow old
I was gonna Climb Mountains, sail the seas, go searchin for gold
But those years come creeping in and the journey gets so long
I don’t spring back like I used too - but I’m still holding on

Holding on to what I believe in – be it right or wrong
Holding on to my dreams and my crazy schemes yes I’m still holding on

Thought I’d found true love  - I was sure it never could end
I was blinded by the light in her eyes, couldn’t see round the bend
Then one night she said good bye – I turned around she was gone
Shook my head –  shed my tears – but I’m still holding on

Holding on to believing that love is a good thing – even though she’s gone
Holding on to my dreams and my crazy schemes yes I’m still holding on

Oh at night when the cold wind blows - and my collar is pulled up high
I’m all alone in a god forsaken place - wondering why
A man only does what he must do and the journey must go on
Brush myself off - laugh at the wind cause I’m still holding on

Holding on to what I believe in – even though it’s wrong
Holding on to my dreams and my crazy schemes yes I’m still holding on

Holding on to what I believe in – be it right or wrong
Holding on to my dreams and my crazy schemes yes I’m still holding on
