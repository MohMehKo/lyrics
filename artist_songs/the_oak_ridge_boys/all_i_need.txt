In the magic of this rainy afternoon
Far away from the battle for survival.
In the shelter of your love 
My heart can see the simple truth
It comes to me that all I need is you.

But these quiet moments wash away too soon
When the world outside becomes a raging river
And I’m swept away and looking for a rock to hold on to
It comes to me that all I need is you.

I don’t need a popcall, all I need is you
Somebody else’s hand to hold, 
all I need is you.
Even in the darkest night 
your love comes shining through
It comes to me that all I need is you.
All I ever need is you, all I need is you.

Some people judge their worth by what they do
They only count the power and the glory.
If life becomes a bottom line of what you win and lose
It comes to me that all I need is you.
All I ever need is you, all I need is you.
