These two souls were up in heaven sitting and talking
When he got word it was his time to go
‘Cause a couple down in Memphis wants a baby
And heaven chose him oh so long ago.

So he turned to her and he said, “I’m gonna miss you”
She said, “Don’t you worry, I’ll be down there soon.
There’s a family in Tupelo praying for a daughter
And I’ll be their answer in a year or two.”

And he said, “How will I stand earth until you get there?
I won’t know a soul, it’ll be so strange.
Wherever I go, whatever I do, I’ll be looking hard for you.
How will I stand earth until you get there?”

He was in his senior year down in Oxford
When a pretty junior girl walked into class
She said, “My name’s Angel, you look so familiar”
He said, “maybe we met somewhere in the past.”

When she said “I’m from Tupelo” something happened
Next thing you know he’d asked her to be his wife
He said “I’ve got a job waiting on me out in Dallas
When you graduate we’ll start a brand new life.

But how will I stand Dallas till you get there?
I won’t know a soul, it’ll be so strange.
I’ll be strong, I’ll be true, I’ll be waiting there for you
How will I stand Dallas till you get there?”

Sixty years and eight grandchildren later
He says “It looks like my time is getting close
You know I’m not afraid to meet our Maker
But I’ve loved you so long, I just don’t know.

How will I stand heaven until you get there?
Without you by my side, it’ll be so strange.
I’ll hang around those pearly gates waiting for your pretty face.
How will I stand heaven until you get there?”
