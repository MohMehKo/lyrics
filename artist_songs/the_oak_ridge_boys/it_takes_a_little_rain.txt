(To Make Love Grow)

Sometimes we're friends 
Sometimes we're strangers 
And though there are tears 
There's always love 
It hurts when you cry 
From words thrown in anger 
Warm feelings run deep 
But that's not enough.

It takes a little rain 
To make love grow 
It's the heartache and the pain 
That makes the real heart show 
Where the sun always shines 
There's a desert below 
It takes a little rain 
To make love grow.

Hearts disagree then they grow closer 
Honesty wins when it's someone you trust 
Forever takes time 
True love is never over 
It's filled with new starts 
Just look at us.

[Chorus]
