Tonight love without warning
Stole right into this room
And amazed me like morning
Cause the night is far from over
But the light is shining through.

And there's a rainbow at midnight
And the faint glow won't loose
There's a rainbow at midnight
Shining all the way from here to you.

You can live life without dreaming
Or your dreams never come true
But to save me that worry
With a dream to keep believing
When the rest have fallen through

And there's a rainbow at midnight
And the faint glow won't loose
There's a rainbow at midnight
Shining all the way from here to you.

Heaven is saying 
This time love won't leave you
Never be afraid or blue.

There's a rainbow at midnight
There's a faint glow won't loose
There's a rainbow at midnight
Shining all the way from here to you.

There's a rainbow at midnight
There's a faint glow won't loose
There's a rainbow at midnight
Shining all the way from here to you.
