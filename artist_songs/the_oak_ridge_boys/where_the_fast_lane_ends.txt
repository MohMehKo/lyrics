There's a peaceful place 
That I swear I've seen
In a photograph 
In all my dreams.
Just waiting there 
Just around the bend
Can't wait to get to 
Where the fast lane ends.

Where the fast lane ends
Where the fast lane ends
I'm getting off there
Where the fast lane ends.

It's just a little way
I've got to go till then.
I can't wait to get to
Where the fast lane ends.

Working overtime
Trying to kill myself
On the outside blind 
Chasing fame and wealth.
I want to spend some time 
With my laid back friends.
I'm gonna do that 
Where the fast lane ends.

Where the fast lane ends
Where the fast lane ends
I'm pulling off there
Where the fast lane ends.

It's just a little way
I've got to go till then.
I can't wait to get to
Where the fast lane ends.

Do, do, do, do, do 
Do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do 
Do, do, do, do, do
Do do do-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo.

Where the fast lane ends, 
Where the fast lane ends
Where the fast lane ends,
Where the fast lane ends
I'm going back to
Where the fast lane ends.

I'm gonna spend some time, 
Gonna spend some time
With my long lost friends
with my long lost friends
I'm gonna do that 
Where the fast lane ends.

Do, do, do, do, do 
Do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do 
Do, do, do, do, do
Do do do-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo.
