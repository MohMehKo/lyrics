Here in the day, here in the light 
All I can see is you last night 
Lit by the moon still by my side 
Loving arms open wide. 
And the love that comes over me
Is enough to make me stay. 

Is it life lived separately? 
Is life all it ought to be? 
Oh, if it were up to me 
I'd make my life with you. 

Some people say it's a dangerous game
I'll take my chances just the same 
If love is a game and you are the prize 
You standing here is no surprise. 
And the love that comes over me 
Is enough to make me stay. 

Is it life lived separately? 
Is life all it ought to be? 
Oh, if it were up to me 
I'd make my life with you.
