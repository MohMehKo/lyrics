The kids are growing up, going off to school.
Once again it’s just me and you.
Like that first year we shared alone
Once again we’re on our own.

There is one big difference between now and then.
We’ve got time in.
Still in love and we’re still friends.
There’s still time for us to dream again
We’ve got time in.

There’s just the two of us 
In this big old house
On the other side of a life we dreamed about.
We’ve got memories to last us for years
Still we wonder where to go from here.

But our future is brighter
Than it’s ever been
Cause we’ve got time in.
Still in love and we’re still friends.

There’s still time for us to dream again
We’ve got time in.
We’d be fools if we ever let it end
With all this time in.
