I go out walking after midnight
In the moonlight, just like we used to do
I’m always walking after midnight
Searching for you.

I walk for miles along the highway
That is my way of being close to you
I go out walking after midnight
Searching for you.

I’ve got to see a weeping willow
Crying on his pillow.
Maybe he’s crying for me.
And as the sky turns gloomy
Night winds whisper to me.
I’m lonesome as I can be.

I go out walking after midnight
In the starlight.
Just hoping you may be
Out there walking after midnight 
Searching for me.

I’ve got to see a weeping willow
Crying on his pillow.
Maybe he’s crying for me.
And as the sky turns gloomy
Night winds whisper to me.
I’m lonesome as I can be.

I go out walking after midnight
In the starlight
Just hoping you may be
Out there walking after midnight 
Searching for me.

I go out walking after midnight
In the starlight
Just hoping you may be
Out there walking after midnight 
Searching for me.
