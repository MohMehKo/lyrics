Hey there mister in a Cadillac
Get off a my tail, get off a my back
Pull on round cause I ain’t gonna drive
Any faster than 55.
I’ve got a sign in the window buddy, can’t you read
Precious cargo sitting next to me.

[CHORUS:]
Ooooooo baby on board.
Everybody knows I take it kind a slow
With my baby on board.
I want the world to see
Who’s riding next to me.
Rocking in my old Ford
With my baby on board.

It’s hard enough to keep it on the road
She looks so good I’m about to lose control
God only knows the way she makes me feel
It’s all I can do to keep my hands on the wheel.
With my baby won’t you take a ride
I’ll make sure to keep her satisfied.

[CHORUS:]

Riding high, rolling down the street
I’ve got an angel here in my front seat.

I’ve got a sign in the window buddy, can’t you read
Precious cargo sitting next to me.

[CHORUS:]

I want the world to see
Whose riding next to me.
R  r  r  rocking in my old Ford
With my baby on board.
I got my baby on board
I’ve got my baby, got my baby on board
I got my baby on board
I’ve got my baby, got my baby on board [to fade out]
