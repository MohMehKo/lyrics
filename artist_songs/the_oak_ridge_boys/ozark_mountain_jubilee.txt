I hear a rooster crowin' 
It's a frosty mornin' 
I can almost see the sign 
Goin' so fast I can't stop 
I'm just a stones-throw from Little Rock 
Headin' for that Missouri line

Don't need a map to get there 
You can get there from anywhere 
When you're goin' in your head 
I can see the arms outreachin' 
Just like the day I was leavin' 
It's been oh so many years.

Let me get on the Frisco Silver Dollar Line 
Take my time 
And see all I can see 
Fiddler rosin up your bow 
We'll have our own 
Ozark Mountain Jubilee

If I can't be a favorite son 
I'll be the prodigal one 
'Cause I've been gone too long 
Oh how the years have flown by 
Oh how I've realized 
How much of me is gone.

[Chorus]
