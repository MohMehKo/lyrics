When my soul was disturbed with sorrow
When My heart was burdened with sin
Jesus opened His arms of mercy
And tenderly took me in 

[Chorus]
There is peace in the time of trouble
There is peace in the midst of the storm
There is peace though the world be raging
In the shelter of His arms 

There are storms that we all encounter
Do not fear they will do you no harm
In the Lord you will find protection
In the shelter of His arms 

Tho' the world all around be raging
And it's filled with many alarms.
Trust in Jesus and He will keep you.
In the shelter of His arms 

[Chorus x2]

Tag In the shelter of His arms
