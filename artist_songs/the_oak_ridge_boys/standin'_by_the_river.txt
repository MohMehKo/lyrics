Now when me and Ginny were sweet sixteen
We’d go down to the river at night.
Take a brand new penny make a wish and then
Throw it into the river wide.
She would never tell me what she wished
I never told her mine, standin’ by the river.
We were standin’ by the river
Holding to each other
Dreamin’ bout the other side.

Well now we got married and we moved away
Had to leave the easy world behind
But we took whatever God carried our way
Made the best out of the hardest times
I would hold her in my arms at night
Dreamin’ of the times standin’ by the river.
We were standin’ by the river
Holding to each other
Dreamin’ bout the other side.

We were just like that old river
Saw a lot of things come and go
But the love we had for one another
Kept on flowing.

Now I’ve still got my Ginny, it’s been twelve years
And we’re back upon the riverbank
Gonna throw me a penny in the river again
Gonna say a little word of thanks.
God I hope her every wish came true
I know I got mine, standin’ by the river
We were standin’ by the river
Holding to each other
Dreamin’ bout the other side.
We were standin’ by the river
Holding to each other
Dreamin’ bout the other side.
Yer – 
Standin’ by the river, Standin’ by the river, 
Standin’ by the river.
