When you’re tempted just to let it slip away
Hold on, hold on.
When bitter words just get in the way
Hold on, be strong.

When you think you can’t hang in there anymore,
And you know that any second you’ll be storming out the door,
When you’ve vented all your anger
And there’s nothing left to say,
Don’t you know a little love can go a long, long way?

Pride will only lead to loneliness
Hold on, hold on.
You’d better learn how to forgive and to forget
Before she’s gone.

When you think you can’t hang in there anymore,
And you know that any second you’ll be storming out the door,
When you’ve vented all your anger
And there’s nothing left to say,
Don’t you know a little love can go a long, long way?

There’s bound to be some heartaches
Love is never an easy road
Just give it all you’ve got
With all your heart and soul.
Don’t let misunderstandings stand in your way
There’s a river deep, there’s a river deep
A little love is all you need.

And when you think you can’t hang in there anymore
And you know that any second you’ll be storming out the door
When you’ve vented all your anger
And there’s nothing left to say
Don’t you know a little love can go a long, long way.
Once you’ve vented all your anger
And there’s nothing left to say
Don’t you know a little love can go a long, long way.

Don’t you know a little love can go a long, long way.
