They all said our love was too long a shot
If we had listened to them we wouldn’t have what we’ve got.
I know we’ve struggled all the way
But we survived to say
Our love is here to stay

[CHORUS:]
Through the storms, through the nights
You and I held each other tight
Knowing the dawn was never far away.
Oh through it all we have found
Our love is standing on solid ground
It’s alive and well today
Our love is here to stay.

Baby looking back on where we’ve been
If I had the chance I’d do it all again
Bring on tomorrow come what may
There’s nothing we can’t face
Our love is here to stay.

[CHORUS]

Oh yer, oh through it all we have found
Our love is standing on solid ground
It’s alive and well today
Our love is here to stay.

Through the nights. through the night
You and I held each other tight
Knowing the dawn was never far away.
Oh through it all we have found
Our love is standing on solid ground
It’s alive and well today
Our love is here to stay.
