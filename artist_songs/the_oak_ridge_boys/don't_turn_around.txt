Don’t turn around, you could be tempted
You could change your mind again and stay.
Don’t turn around, go through the door and walk away.

A word of advice – don’t offer love to turn your world around.
More often than not it just helps to dull the pain
A toss of the dice, two losing lovers face up on the ground.
Time to move on and hanging on only brings those tears again.

Don’t turn around, you could be tempted
You could change your mind again and stay
Don’t turn around,
Go through the door and walk away.

Don’t say you’ll never be pulled in again
Sooner or later the damage will mend
And you’ll be willing and able
And dying to fall in love.

And when you fall just think of me and when I let you go.
Someday I know every word I say tonight, will haunt me so
Don’t turn around, you could be tempted
You could change your mind again and stay
Don’t turn around,
Go through the door and walk away.

Don’t turn around, you could be tempted
You could change your mind again and stay
Don’t turn around,
Go through the door and walk away.
Don’t turn around,
Go through the door and walk away.
