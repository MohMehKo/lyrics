Some friends you’d cry for 
You, I would die for. 
and I love you too much 
to beg you to stay.
You have your own plans 
But it makes my heart sad 
Watching my best friend walking away.

Love’s never easy 
And who knows what’s fair.
I guess I’m still feeling 
What’s no longer there. 
When hearts go to pieces 
Love crumbles and falls, 
Like stones made of memories 
From bridges and walls.

Hope tomorrow brings good news 
’Cause I’m sure gonna miss you. 
If I look away now, please understand 
’Cause my eyes refuse to see 
Something I can’t believe. 
The very best part of me, come to an end.

But love’s never easy 
And who knows what’s fair.
I guess I’m still feeling 
What’s no longer there. 
When hearts go to pieces 
Love crumbles and falls 
Like stones made of memories 
From bridges and walls.

Yer, like stones made of memories 
From bridges and walls.
