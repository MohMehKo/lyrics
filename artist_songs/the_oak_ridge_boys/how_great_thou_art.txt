Oh Lord, my God when I in awesome wonder
Consider all the work thy hands have made
I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder
Thy power throughout the universe displayed.

When Christ shall come with shout of adulation
To take me home what joy shall fill my heart
Then I bow down in humble adoration
And there proclaim My God how great Thou art.

Then sings my soul my Saviour, God to Thee
How great thou art, how great thou art
Then sings my soul my Saviour, God, to Thee
How great Thou art, how great Thou art.
