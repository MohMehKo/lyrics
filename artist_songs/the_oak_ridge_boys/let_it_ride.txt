You cant sit around waiting
For your path to glory
You gotta get movin to
Tell your story
The bigger they come
The harder they fall
From the littlest acorns
To the trees so tall
But where your comin from
And where your goin'
Until you get there 
There ain't no way of knowing

All the love in the world
Wont find you if you don't let it
Let it ride, Let it ride, Let it ride
All the mistakes are breaks
But only if you did it
Let it ride, Let it ride, Let it ride

Every day's a brand new day
Fell the sun upon your face

All the love in the world
Wont find you if you don't let it
Let it ride, Let it ride, Let it ride
All the mistakes are breaks
But only if you did it
Let it ride, Let it ride, Let it ride

All the love in the world
Wont find you if you don't let it
Let it ride, Let it ride, Let it ride
All the mistakes are breaks
But only if you did it
Let it ride, Let it ride, Let it ride
Let it ride, Let it ride, Let it ride
Let it ride
