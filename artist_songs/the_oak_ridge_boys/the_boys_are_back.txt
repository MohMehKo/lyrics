The Boys are back, busting on the scene
We ain't got nothing now that wasn't first in our dreams
It may have been a while since you heard us sing
We got Jesus in the front seat steering this thing
We're straight on track, no matter how it stacks
’Cause the Boys are back, the boys are back.

Well, the world is changing fast and it ain't so cool
Got the politicians lobbying taking God out of school
But how do you change the game if you don't make the rules
Well, I feel just like a prisoner on this ship of fools
We're gonna ride it down, there will be no white flags
’Cause the boys are back, the boys are back.

This train is coming and it's headed your way
We're thick as thieves and we got so much to say
The devil may come and try to get us to stray
But we all know where we stand at the end of days
Like four strong winds blowing through a ramshackle shack
The boys are back, the boys are back.

Well, gather round children I got a story to tell, 
About ol' Wally Fowler and that dream that never fell,
About those who came before us, gonna guide us to the water
Where we all can take the hand of our almighty Father
But until we hit the black, we been planning this attack
And the boys are back, the boys are back.

The boys are back, yeah the boys are back
Yeah the boys are back, yeah the boys are back [repeat x9]
Like four strong winds executing this attack
Yeah the boys are back, yeah the boys are back [repeat x9]
