Hoping baby that you’ve got a notion 
To give me some of that sweet love potion.
Come on honey, it’s so easy.
You’ve got what it takes to please me
Long tanned legs, big brown eyes
You’re a first class ticket to paradise.
Paradise, mmm

I’m gonna put my arms around you
And I’ll tell you what I’m gonna do
I’ll love you, squeeze you, try to please you
Hear my heart beating for you.
It’s going bom, bom, bom,  bom bom, bom, heartbeat,
bom bom, bom, bom, bom, bom heartbeat
bom bom, bom, bom, bom, bom heartbeat
bom bom, bom, bom, bom, bom heartbeat,
Heartbeat, heartbeat, heartbeat.

Working hard down at the factory
Watch the clock, he said until three
Later on, me and you baby.
Are going to make some sweet love, maybe
Hair combed back socks pulled up.
I’ve spent three hours shining my pick-up truck
Ah my pick-up truck, mmm.

I’m gonna put my arms around you
And I’ll tell you what I’m gonna do
I’ll love you, squeeze you, try to please you
Hear my heart beating for you.
It’s going bom, bom, bom,  bom bom, bom, bom, heartbeat,
bom bom, bom, bom, bom, bom heartbeat
bom bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, heartbeat
Ah hear my heartbeat, it’s a beating for you, 
Ah hear my heartbeat, it’s a beating for you oo oo,
Hear my heartbeat, you know it’s beating for you  
Ah hear my heartbeat, it’s a beating for you oo oo,
Ah hear my heartbeat, you know it’s a beating for you
Ah hear my heartbeat, it’s a beating for you. [to fade out]
