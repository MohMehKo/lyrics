[CHORUS:]
You can huff, you can puff
And you can trash my name all around
But you ain’t gonna blow my house down
You ain’t gonna blow my house down.
You can howl, you can prowl
And you can romp and stomp on the ground
But you ain’t gonna blow my house down
You ain’t gonna blow my house down.

Open up the good book
Take yourself a good look
Ever since the start of time
Devil, you’ve been lyin’ and killin’ and robbin’ us blind
Spittin’ out a big talk
Struttin’ with the big walk
Yeah you want to clean my clock
But devil you can’t because I’m standing on the solid rock.

[CHORUS]

Yeah you want to break me
So that you can make me
Knuckle underneath your bluff
Aiming at my throat
Charging like a big bad wolf
Yeah you got a big bite
But you lost the big fight
Jesus won the victory
So devil back off ‘cause the winner is living in me.

[CHORUS]
