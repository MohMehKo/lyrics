So you thought without her it would be easy to live
She wanted more than you were willing to give.
Ah, but give and take and blame are all a part of the plan
That burns for the one that you want to be with.

You know a fire is hard to get started
And even harder to make a good one last.
You’d better believe it’s so
You’re gonna wind up out in the cold
When it all goes up in smoke and ashes.

You better pour a little more coal on the fire
Send the voice she knows and loves a whistling down the wire
If it’s love and it’s true
Then it ain’t nothing more than a point of view
Pour a little more coal on the fire 
Oh you’ve gotta pour a little more coal on the fire.

You know she wants you but only if you’re willing to bend
You’re far enough away to see how much she meant
Oh it’s a crying shame that fire’s part of the game
It’s a card you’re holding, playing to win.
There ain’t nothing as lonely as a loser
Who refuses to fold a losing hand
You’d better believe it’s true
It’s happening to you
You’re gonna become a forgotten man.

You better pour a little more coal on the fire
Send the voice she knows and loves a whistling down the wire
If it’s love and it’s true
Then it ain’t nothing more than a point of view
Pour a little more coal on the fire.
I said if it’s love and it’s real
Then cuddle up and tell her just how you feel.
Pour a little more coal on the fire.
You gotta pour a little more coal on the fire, 
On the fire, a little more coal on the fire 
You gotta pour a little more coal on the fire 
You gotta pour a little more coal on the fire 
You gotta pour a little more coal on the fire 
You gotta pour.
