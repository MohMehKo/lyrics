You say you never fell before
But this time you must have slipped, now you know how it feels.
You say you've always watched your step
But this time you must have tripped and went head over heels.
Now you say it, your so good and you want me to fall too
What a crazy thing to ask someone you love to do.
No I'd rather not fall.

Fall leads a river wrong 
And it pulls apart a mountain and throws him over the edge.
At first it feels real good
But he's half way down when he sees there's real trouble ahead.
Above the ragged rocks below, he wonders was it worth the thrill.
Cause if the fall don't do him in then the sudden stop surely will.
No I'd rather not fall.

Just let me slip into this slow and easy
I've got my sight set on the long, long haul.
I believe we're headed for the same place baby
Let's change this pace to a slow crawl
I'll walk in standing tall, but I'd rather not fall.

Fall takes a shooting star 
And it burns into a streak of disappearing light
And when the darkness falls
It turns away the sun and leaves us here in the night.
Steals the green from the trees 
And paints them red and gold
Leaves them standing there in the winter air
With their branches bare and cold
No I'd rather not fall.

Just let me slip into this slow and easy
I've got my sight set on the long, long haul.
I believe we're headed for the same place baby
Let's change this pace to a slow crawl
I'll walk in standing tall, but I'd rather not fall.
No I'd rather not fall. 
No I'd rather not fall.
