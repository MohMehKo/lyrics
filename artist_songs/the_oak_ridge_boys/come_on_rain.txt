Last night they fired the cannon on the courthouse lawn.
The whole town gathered at the square and we stayed there till dawn
Telling tales and singing songs and trying to work it out.
Rain prayers all saying Lord please help us through this drought.

[CHORUS:]
Sun beats down from a White House sky
Still no rain, come on rain
Hens laying eggs with fire inside
Still no rain, come on rain
Dust devil carried our fields away
Still no rain, come on rain
Cow gone dry and the mule gone lame
And there’s still no rain, 
Still no rain, still no rain, still no rain. 

You can walk across the river on the bone dry mud
What little waters left there might as well be our blood
After 80 years the Carter family just ran out of luck
We watch the dust cloud rising as they drive off in their truck.

Sun beats down from a White House sky
Still no rain, come on rain
Hens laying eggs with fire inside
Still no rain, come on rain
Dust has carried our fields away
Still no rain, come on rain
Cows gone dry and the mule gone lame
And there’s still no rain, 
No not a cloud in sight, ain’t that a shame
There’s thunder in the night but still no rain.

[CHORUS:]

Still no rain, come on rain.
Still no rain, come on rain.
Still no rain, come on rain.
