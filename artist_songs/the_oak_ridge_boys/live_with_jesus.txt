Seen a lot of trouble at my door
Never known a day when I ain't been poor
But I'm gonna live with Jesus in the end

Hard time is all I see
I've lost the ones that were dear to me
But I'm gonna live with Jesus in the end

I'm gonna live, I'm gonna live
I'm gonna live with Jesus in the end
I'm gonna live, I'm gonna live
I'm gonna live with Jesus in the end

When these poor bones are tired and old
I meet my savior, redeem my soul
'Cause I'm gonna live with Jesus in the end

I'm gonna live, I'm gonna live
I'm gonna live with Jesus in the end
I'm gonna live, I'm gonna live
I'm gonna live with Jesus in the end
