Full moons and empty promises
We were only high school kids
We got so close that we closed our eyes
To the facts of life.
We were married in the spring
Not long before the baby came
Your mama said she couldn't bare the shame
Your dad refused to give the bride away.

Beyond those years
Who'd have thought we'd still be standing here?
And that love would find it’s way
Through all those tears
Beyond those years.

Eighteen standing in the shoes of a man
The weight of the world in my unskilled hands
One by one as the dreams fell through
I took my failures out on you.
But you held on when it made no sense
And cleaned the face of the innocent
You were so strong to be so young
And now look just how far we've come.

Beyond those years
Who'd have thought we'd still be standing here?
And that love would find it’s way
Through all those tears
Beyond those years.

So many times we wanted to act our age
Call it off and go our separate ways
Against the odds we grew up too fast
And on our own, yer we made it last
Oo we made it last. 

Beyond those years
Who'd have thought we'd still be standing here?
And that love would find it’s way
Through all those tears
Beyond those years.

Beyond those years
Who'd have thought we'd still be standing here?
And that love would find it’s way
Through all those tears
Beyond those years.

Beyond those years
Who'd have thought we'd still be standing here?
And that love would find it’s way
Through all those tears
Beyond those years. [fading]
