A oump yer, a oump yer yer, a oump yer, aaaah
A oump yer, a oump yer yer, a oump yer, aaaah

[CHORUS:]
Yer, you got me itching babe
I’m scratching like a hound
Wagging your tail honey, all over town.
You tell me, roll over Rover
But I can’t go for that
Don’t you treat me like a dog, baby
Love this cat.

A oump yer, a oump yer yer, a oump yer, aaaah
Well each time I try to catch you babe
You turn on me.
You’ve got me howling at the moon
And barking up the wrong tree.
Why don’t you be my little kitten?
Curl up on my lap.
Don’t you treat me like a dog, baby
Love this cat.

Don’t you treat me like a dog 
Waiting for his bone.
Don’t you put me on a lead
Then lead me on
You got me sitting all day, 
I can’t get enough.
Well I’m a fool tomcat
This ain’t no puppy love.

Everybody knows that you’re a pedigree
They a come running when you whistle, baby
But not me.
No I won’t be your little munter
I wont run with that cat
Don’t you treat me like a dog, baby
Love this cat.

[CHORUS:]

Don’t you treat me like a dog, baby
Love this cat.
