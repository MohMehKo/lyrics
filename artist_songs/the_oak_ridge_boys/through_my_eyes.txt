I heard you talkin' on the telephone
complainin' to your friends
how things in life are lookin' older
and how you wish you were young again
from fingernails not long enough 
to favorite dresses to small in size.
But oh, if only darlin' you could see you through my eyes.

[Chorus]
Through my eyes, you'd see why I'm lovin' you the way that I do.
Through my eyes, you'd realize they don't come any better than you.
Theyre'd be no talk of changin', rearraingin'
you'd be more than satisfied.
If only you could see you through my eyes.

I've seen standin' at the mirror
then turn yourself around.
lookin' past the beauty
finding ways to put yourself down.
Those special things I love about you
you forever criticize.
But oh if only darlin' you could see you through my eyes.

[Chorus]

Through my eyes.
if only you could see you..
through my eyes.
