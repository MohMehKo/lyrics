I look high, I look low
Always searching for love
Well I try in my soul
But I just couldn’t give up.
Then one night it’ll be   
I stepped into paradise
We just smiled so sweet
You put love into my life

[CHORUS:]
Now I’m so happy, feel like singing
Children laughing, bells are ringing
Feels like heaven, I’m in clover
Sweet as honey, candy over
Now you gave me the sunshine
Made it brighter each day.
So I’ll tell everybody that’ll listen to me
Your love made me this way.

Well each day when I rise
I start out thinking of you.
There’s no grey in my sky
It stays eternally blue.
When the star it don’t glow
I’m not alone in the dark
Then the sun will glow
That you put into my heart

[CHORUS]

Now you gave me the sunshine, made it brighter each day.
So I’ll tell everybody that’ll listen to me

[CHORUS]
Your love made me this way.
