I was there in the very next room
She thought I was down the hall
She was talking on the phone like women do
She didn’t know I could hear at all.

I heard her say to her very best friend
He doesn’t love me like I did back then
She said lately I’ve been so alone
So tomorrow morning I’ll be gone.

[CHORUS:]
Lucky moon stay out tonight, sunlight stay away
I’ve got one more chance to make things right
We’ve gotta make her want to stay
It’s up to me and you, lucky moon.

Make reservations at her favourite restaurant
Candle light and expensive wine
Try to let her know that she’s the one that I want
Gotta show her while I’ve still got time.

I can’t believe how stupid I’ve been
God knows I love her like I did back then
Better take to heart her warning
Somehow change her mind by morning.

[CHORUS:]

The first star I see tonight
I wish I may, I pray she might
Find a little magic in the moonlight.

Lucky moon stay out tonight, sunlight stay away
I’ve got one more chance to make things right
We’ve gotta make her want to stay

[CHORUS:]

Lucky moon.
Lucky moon.
