Alright, mm, mm

Always been the things you wanted
Even though I try to tell you
You never seem to see my point of view
Now it’s time to say goodbye
See the things that I’ve been missing
I hope I find what I’ve been searching for.

[CHORUS:]
Looking for love, looking for love,
Looking for love, looking for love,
Looking for love, looking for love,
Looking for love, looking for love.

Friday night and I’m off and running
Had enough of this so called loving
Heartache’s all you ever get from me
Heading down this two lane highway
I don’t know if you’ll ever find me
Time to look for love, where can it be? yer

[CHORUS]

Play it boys. woo

Now it’s time to say goodbye
See the things that I’ve been missing
I hope I find what I’ve been searching for.

[CHORUS]
Looking for love, looking for love.
Well I’m looking for love, looking for love.
Looking for love, looking for love. woo

Well I’m a looking for love, looking for love.
Just looking for love, looking for love.
Looking for love, looking for love,
Looking for love, looking for love,
Yes I’m a looking for love, o yer, looking for love,
Looking for love, o yer, looking for love,
Looking for love, looking for love, [fading]
