Hmmm

[CHORUS:]
Gimme some of your love and I’ll give you some of mine
Gimme some of your love and I’ll give you some of mine
Gimme some of your love and I’ll give you some of mine
Gimme some of your love and I’ll give you some of mine

Well I brought a new car girl but didn’t I give you a ride
Well I had a little money, I did 9 – 5.
But when I asked you for your heart girl you started to laugh
I went and found somebody and now you want me back.
But you got to.

[CHORUS:]

When I asked you for a kiss girl you turned away
You kept putting me off babe – just one more day.
So I left you with ma and pa but you keep calling me
But if you want what I’ve got baby 
You’ve got to give me what I need.
Come on now. 

[CHORUS:]
Gimme some of your love and I’ll give you some of mine
Gimme some of your love and I’ll give you some of mine.

You got to 

[CHORUS:]
Gimme some of your love and I’ll give you some of mine.
