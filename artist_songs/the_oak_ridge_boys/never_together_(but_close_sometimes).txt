There’s a song in your eye 
As blue as the sky.
Just looking at you keeps me singing it.
There’s music and wine
That sparkle and shine.
One for your money and two to quit.

Every day it’s getting less hard to be
Never together but close sometimes.
Windows and rain, bluebirds and planes,
They’re never together but they’re close sometimes.

A girl in New York once captured my heart
But the winter was cold and I had to split.
Sweet Tennessee spoke softly to me.
I’m home when I’m home and I’m loving it.

Every day it’s getting less hard to be
Never together but close sometimes.
Windows and rain, bluebirds and planes,
Are never together but they’re close sometimes.

Life in these bars 
With the make believe stars,
People and loneliness passing time.
A world full of fools
Sitting glued to their stools
Drowning in sadness and Rose wine.

And every day it’s getting less hard to be
Never together but close sometimes.
Windows and rain, bluebirds and planes,
Are never together but they’re close sometimes.

And every day it’s getting less hard to be
Never together but close sometimes.
Windows and rain, bluebirds and planes,
Are never together but they’re close sometimes.
Are never together but they’re close sometimes.
