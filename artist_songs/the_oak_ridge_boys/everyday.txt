You know a smile never goes out of style 
So brighten up the one that you wear. 
Let it shine and you just might find 
You’ll lighten up the load that you bear.

You know with all the trouble and sorrow in the world 

It seems like the least we can do, 
Just take that smile into the street 
And share it with everybody you meet.

Everyday (everyday) I want to shake somebody’s hand 
Everyday (everyday) I want make somebody know 
(That thinks they can) that they can (yes they can) 
Everyday (everyday) I want to try (I want to try) 
To show my brothers and my sisters 
That I want to help them along the way everyday, everyday. 

You know a kind work never goes unheard 
But too often goes unsaid. 
And on the tongue of the old and the young 
It’s swallowed up with pride instead.

You know with all the trouble and sorrow in the world 
It seems like the least we can do 
Just take a kind word into the street 
And share it with everybody you meet.

Everyday (everyday) I want to shake somebody’s hand, yer 
Everyday (everyday) I want make somebody know 
(That thinks they can) that they can (yes they can) 
Everyday (everyday) I want to try (I want to try) 
To show my brothers and my sisters 
That I want to help them along the way everyday, everyday.

If they’re lost I want to show them the sunshine 
If they look tossed I want to throw them a lifeline. 
I want the reach out my hand, (reach out) yer (a hand to hold) 
Oh yeah, and let ’em know (let ’em know) 
There’s a light (that there’s light) down at the end of the road.

If they’re lost I want to (show them the sunshine) 
If they’re tossed I want to (throw them a lifeline).

Well everyday (everyday) I want to shake somebody’s hand, mmm 
Everyday (everyday) I want make somebody know 
(That thinks they can) that they can (yes they can) 
Everyday (everyday) I want to try (I want to try) 
To show my brothers and my sisters 
That I want to help them along the way everyday, everyday.

Everyday, everyday (everyday) I want to shake somebody’s hand, yer 
Everyday (everyday) I want make somebody know 
(That thinks they can) that they can (yes they can) 
And everyday (everyday) [fading]
