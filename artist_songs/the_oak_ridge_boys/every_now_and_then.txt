When we needed help the most we found each other
And without you I don't know where I'd have been
We have soothed each other's quiet desperations
and loved each other every now and then

We have made each other laugh like happy children
You have sometimes felt my teardrops on your hand
And when we can't control our lonely feelings
We love each other now and then

We're a little less than lovers but a little more than friends
Clinging to each other until the darkness ends
We have held each other time and time again
And loved each other every now and then

Some day I'll find the one who's meant for me
And I that some day you'll find love again
But we'll always have the very special memories
Of the love we gave each other now and then

We're a little less than lovers but a little more than friends
Clinging to each other until the darkness ends
We have held each other time and time again
And loved each other every now and then

We have held each other time and time again
And loved each other every now and then
