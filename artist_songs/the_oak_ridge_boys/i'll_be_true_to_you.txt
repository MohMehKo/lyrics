They met upon a blue moon,
And they parted on a cloudy day
They were so in love and out of school,
But he was goin' so far, far away.

She said: "I'll be true to you,
"Even though you don't want me to.
"And I'll be blue for you,
"Even though you've asked me not to." 

Well the year's drifted by them, as we all know they can.
He found other women, but she refused other men.
But as fate would have it, they met again,
She was on a down-hill slide, he was just slidin' in. 

As he looked into her eyes that night, he never realized.
The only real love in his life was passin' by.
When he turned and left her there, his words: "Goodbye".
He heard her calling out to him, and as he walked, she cried: 

"I've been true to you.
"Seems like speakin' to me is the least that you could do.
"And I've been blue for you,
"Even though you've asked me not to." 

She'd been drinkin way too hard one night,
She'd been drinkin way too long.
Alone and pale in a cheap hotel, she died there in the dawn.
Kneelin' by the grave, oh so late and oh so wrong,
He longed to hold her close again, cryin' on and on. 

He cried: "I'll be true to you.
"After all that I have put you through.
"And I'll be blue for you,
"Though you never even asked me to."
