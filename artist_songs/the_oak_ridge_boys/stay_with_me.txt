I, I want you to know
That I love you
A million times more
Than anyone that I’ve known before.
Cause you, you fill up my heart
You touch me and kindle a flame 
That’s as bright as the stars
But I burn out if you ever go.

So stay with me, stay with me, stay
Tonight and the rest of my days.
I need you more than it shows
All of your body and soul.
You are the light of my life
You are the one thing that’s right
So let’s take it all of the way
Stay with me, stay with me, stay.

Tonight the light in your hair
Is soft as the wind
There’s a magical moon in the air
But it disappears the minute you’re gone.

So stay with me, stay with me, stay
Tonight and the rest of my days
I need you more than it shows
All of your body and soul
You are the light of my life
You are the one thing that’s right
So let’s take it all of the way
Stay with me, stay with me, stay.

So stay with me, stay with me, stay
Tonight and the rest of my days
I need you more than it shows
All of your body and soul
You are the light of my life
You are the one thing that’s right
So let’s take it all of the way
Stay with me, stay with me, stay with me, stay with me, stay.
