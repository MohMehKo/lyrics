Here we are after all we’ve been
Acting like total strangers again,
Making small talk to avoid anything too familiar.
No more words, their not enough
On their self, that can say as much as my heart
When it knows what it wants and it wants you.

I never should have taken you for granted
I won’t make that same mistake again
Cause I’m ready now to give everything.

[CHORUS:]
Darling I, I’ll do whatever it takes
Break any walls in the way
That stands between you and me
I’ll lay my heart on the line
I’ll take the gamble this time
I’ll do whatever it takes.

To get you back.

Let’s cut through all of this red tape
Cast the doubts on your gorgeous face
To your eyes where I see there’s a willing surrender.
Wow, wow, yer, 
You can’t hide the love you’re already feeling
You’re gonna have to let me in
There’s no way I’m gonna lose you again.

[CHORUS]
I’ll do whatever it takes, 
I’ll do whatever it takes, yer, wow,
I’ll do whatever it takes, I’ll do whatever it takes.

Wow, wow, yer, I never should have taken you for granted
I won’t make that same mistake again
Cause I’m ready now to give everything. 

[CHORUS]

I’ll do whatever it takes, I’ll do whatever it takes, [fading]
