They were solid as a rock and stubborn as a stone
Honest to the core and ornery to the bone
And the Good Book says
Their lot in life was not a bed of roses
For Jonah, Job and Moses.

Now Jonah knew the darkness in the belly of a whale
And Job saw tribulation and Moses went through hell
There were tears and fears and heartaches
In big and bigger doses
For Jonah, Job and Moses.

And me, I'm just a struggling soul
Ten thousand years removed
I've been lost out in the desert
I've been swallowed and consumed
And I pray to God for patience
Make me more like those three
Help me survive my troubles
Let me join that band of brothers 
Let it be Jonah, Job, Moses and me.

I've battled with some demons and I've lost the ones I've loved
I shook my fist at Jesus and I could not rise above
It was in the anger of those hours
I came to feel the closest
To Jonah, Job and Moses

'Cause me, I'm just a struggling soul
Ten thousand years removed
I've been lost out in the desert
I've been swallowed and consumed
And I pray to God for patience
Make me more like those three
Help me survive my troubles
Let me join that band of brothers
Let it be Jonah, Job, Moses and me.

Lord, let it be Jonah, Job, Moses and me.
They were solid as a rock
And stubborn as a stone.
