You live your life
You live like an island
Satisfied
You live for the moment
Here you come
You make it look easy
I bet you smile in your sleep
Are you smiling at me
You live your life
You live like an island
Surrounded by
Water and silence
Mmm there you go
You make it look easy
I bet you laugh at yourself
Are you laughing at me

'Cause sometimes anything goes
When you're looking at me
And sometimes everything goes
When you're looking at me

So come on, come on
Everything goes
(When you're looking at me)
Come on, come on
Everything goes
(Sometimes when
You're smiling at me)
Come on, come on
Everything goes

Come on

You live your life
You live like an island
What is it like
I wish I could hold it
Mmm there you go
Making it look easy
I bet you like how it feels
But do you feel me

So come on, come on
Anything goes
Come on, come on
Everything goes
Come on, come on
Everything goes

'Cause sometimes
Anything goes 
When you're looking at me
And sometimes
Everything goes
