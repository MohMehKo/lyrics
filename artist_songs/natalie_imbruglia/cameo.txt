Move
A little closer and Ill prove
That I have something that you crave
But you know all about it

Try
Give me a minute of your time
And l can figure out a way
To make it worth your while

Cos I am drawn to you and
Everybody stares when you walk in the room
But you keep disappearing

Have I told you you're my cameo?
Wont you love it baby
Here we go
Cameo

Leave
Or you will find yourself in need
Of something more than you can take
And it'll drive you wild

I was a slave
To every signal that you gave
You had me ready for the chase
And there was no denying

Cos I am drawn to you and
Everybody stares when you walk in the room
But you keep disappearing

Have I told you you're my cameo?
Wont you love it baby
Here we go
Cameo
