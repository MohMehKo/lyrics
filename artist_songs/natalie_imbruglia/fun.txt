So long
I've been waiting
To sing this song
Not sure
If it's worth it anymore
Working anymore

People always
Ask about you
People always
Want to talk about you
Sometimes when I
Sleep I think about you
With your new someone

Didn't we have fun
I know it hurts like hell
When you can't be with someone

Try
Never stop to wonder why
Ohh how
I just hope you happy now
Hope you happy now

People always
Ask about you
People always
Want to talk about you
Sometimes when I
Sleep I think about you
With your new someone

Didn't we have fun
I know it hurts like hell
When you can't be with someone

Didn't we have fun
Though it hurts like hell
Yeah, I dont want to forget

Didn't we have fun
I know it hurts like hell
When you cant be with someone

Didn't we have fun
Though it hurts like hell
Yeah, I dont want to forget
I dont want to forget
