Sweet confetti out looking for a saviour
finding it hard to break the chain
nothing ventured nothing gained 
ice cream beauty acting on her best behavior
finding it hard to bite her tongue
feeling so old as the night is young 
six foot leaning on a lizard chest
two red dragons ironed on his vest
all that money you deserve the best
I'm impressed, I'm impressed, I'm impressed

what you've got isn't all that you've been given
changing your body like you change your jeans
nothing is ever as seems
something tells me it's a marriage made in heaven
stealing your look from a magazine
playing the part from a movie scene
six foot leaning on a lizard chest
two red dragons ironed on his vest
that money you deserve the best
I'm impressed, I'm impressed, I'm impressed 

everyday is like your birthday
but the candle's burning, don't you see. don't you see
