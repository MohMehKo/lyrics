Is this part, is this part,
Of the process, of the process?
Can I find another way 'round,
Other way round, round the pain?
Cuz you've left me here in the middle of it
Said I'll work it out, I promise
I don't know how we got here in the first place.

I climbed the walls,
You hit the bars.
I am from Venus,
You are from Mars.
You got your brand new friends.
And I got a broken heart.
Doesnt matter who we are

Everyone has their scars.
Everyone has their scars.

There's a place, there's a place,
That I'm heading, that I'm heading.
Need to know, are you coming,
Are you coming, telling me?
Cuz you're heading in the wrong direction
Just as I need your protection.
Maybe I should let you find your own way.

I climbed the walls,
You hit the bars.
I am from Venus,
You are from Mars.
You got your brand new friends
And I got a broken heart.
Doesn't matter who we are 

Everyone has their scars.
Everyone has their scars.

What could be so bad?
It’s taken you so far
Until you don’t know who you are…

I climbed the walls,
You hit the bars.
I am from Venus,
You are from Mars
You got your brand new friends
And I got a broken heart.
Doesn’t matter who we are.

Everyone has their scars
