Gotta get back
gotta figure out a way
I'm losing - my senses to you
Where'd it go, the bluebird I should follow
back home? But where is home?
guess it won't amount to much
won't be long before I crush
I'll stand in line
don't believe a thing they say, today
seems we all get lost amongst the pigeons and the crumbs

all alone
but I'm in a crowded room
I'm sinking in quicksand tonight
you pick me up and I shine across the sky till morning, then
you color me in
guess it  didn't amount to much
seems to me I've lost my touch
I'm back in line
don't believe a thing they say today
turn around and walk away
everything will go your way, I pray
seems we all get lost amongst the pigeons and the crumbs
