Lonely, lost every part of me
maybe, outstayed my company
walking in to sad scenes
hold me tight and say goodbye
I've seen, behind tomorrow's sky
you be, my missing alibi
bone me over backwards
turn around and change my mind

Cause I've been thinking
about our world tonight
slowly sinking into my appetite
tomorrow morning
are you a friend of mine

I swear, you've left me open
nowhere, to hide this moment
overcrowded daydreams
we're lost or so it seems

Cause I've been thinking
about our world tonight
slowly sinking into my appetite
tomorrow morning
are you a friend of mine

Cause I've been thinking
about our world tonight
slowly sinking into my appetite
tomorrow morning
are you a friend of mine
