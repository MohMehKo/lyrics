I ask you to hold me, but you don't wanna hold me,
it doesn't work that way
I want you to love me, but you don't wanna love me,
I'm losing patience now
oh leave me alone (oh leave me alone)
stop asking for more
I'm goin' home on my own
oh leave me alone (oh leave me alone)
I'm walking out of the door
I'll make it on my own

leave me alone
leave me alone
leave me alone
just leave me alone

you like me to stroke you
careful I don't choke you, did you read my mind
you say don't be blue
that is the best you can do
I've lost my patience now
[chorus]
