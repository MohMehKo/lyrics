Like a song
Like new boots that I have on
A blue sky
Like a stranger that's walking by
Catching your eye

Could you set me free
Make a move on me
Cos someone's getting to ya
Is it someone getting to ya

I'm wild about it
I'm wild about it
(She's wild about it)

I'm wild about it
I'm wild about it
(She's wild about it)
Oh-ah

Like a bomb
Like fireworks to carry on
I wanna play
I wanna let the circus to take me away
So what do you say

Could you set me free
Make a move on me
Cos someone's getting to ya
Is it someone getting to ya

I'm wild about it
I'm wild about it
(She's wild about it)

I'm wild about it
I'm wild about it
(She's wild about it)

Come on and just show me
Take it away
Take me away
