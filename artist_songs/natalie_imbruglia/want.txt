All that you want
I hope you get all that you want
I hope you get all that you want

So I suppose you got what you want
Take a good look at what you give up
Because I'm telling you
A heart can't be unbroken oh, oh, oh, oh

And can you remember how I kiss you
Recall the sweet taste in you mouth
Cause baby the memory is all you get now
And I'm moving, movin, moving on

All that you want
I hope you get all that you want
I hope you get all that you want
Cause I do
I hope you get all that you want
I hope you get all that you want
Cause I do

Does every morning make you happy
And tell me do you laugh yourself to sleep
I hope you find it easy to forget me oh, oh, oh, oh

I hope you don't feel anything when you see me
I wonder if you're out there having fun
I hope you get all that you really wanted
Cos I'm moving, movin, moving on

Don't you see the light has changed
And nothing looks the same
Just shadows on the ground
And if you listen carefully you'll hear

All that you want
I hope you get all that you want
I hope you get all that you want
Cause I do
I hope you get all that you want
I hope you get all that you want
Cause I do
