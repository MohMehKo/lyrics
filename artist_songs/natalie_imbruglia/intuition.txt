Everybody's been in my face
tellin' me I gotta make a change
all I ever hear day and night is "you better hurry up and get
a life"
I need some direction - 'cause the clock is ticking away
then a friend of a friend of mine
says I've really been on his mind
find wants to go out and check out what the feelin's about
says we have a deep connection - well it sure is news to me
and all can I say is
intuition tells me how to live my day
intuition tells me when to walk away
could have turned left
could haven turned right
but I ended up here
bang in the middle of real life

then another one always says - she'd do anything to get ahead
she doesn't care if she has to scratch and claw to get in the
door
she wants her 15 minutes of fame and 20 would be nice
but I guess it's her life
'cause intuition tells me that I'm doin' fine
intuition tells me when to draw the line
could have turned left
could have turned right
but I ended up here
bang in the middle of real life

should have turned left but I turned right
and I ended up here and I feel alright
you make it hard for me
can't find the real you
you really think that I can't see
what it is that you're going to do
