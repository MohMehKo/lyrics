Had a dream
had a drowning dream l was in a river of pain
only difference this time
I wasn't calling out your name yeah
has it ended before it's begun
you hold on
and I try to run but
anybody heading in my direction
away from the city
anybody wanna
change the way they feel step inside
doesn't really matter where you wanna take me
away from the city 
I wanna start again
I wanna start again
I wanna take it back
I wanna start again

funny how those friends forget you when you tire of their
games
you miss a show or a party that blows
and they' ve forgotten your name, yeah
and you wonder what you've become
they pull you back when you try to run
well anybody heading in my direction
away from the city
anybody wanna change the way they feel step inside
doesn't really matter where you wanna take me
away from the city
I wanna start again
I wanna start again
I wanna take it back
I wanna start again

I left the me I used to be
I wanna see this through
I left the me I used to be
if only you'd see it too
well I wonder what you've become
you pull me back when I try to run
