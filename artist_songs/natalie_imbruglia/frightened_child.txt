I hear your silent scream
deep in your private dream
Two ways to go from here
one way will bring you near
fragile wish

Full moon no rain no shame
that distance still remains.
More shades of grey to come
we've been through more than one.
Close your eyes...

Like a frightened child
fragile in spirit
Like a wind blowing wild
no name you can give it
Like an infantile seeing the light for the very first

No tricks no sleight of hand
find somewhere safe to land
Before your walls were shakin'
but now the whole thing's breakin'
And it makes you feel...

Like a frightened child
fragile in spirit
Like a wind blowing wild
no name you can give it.
Like an infantile seeing the light for the very first

Yes you're right
What is right?
Yes it's night
I can tell.

Yes it's yours.
Yes I know.
You're a beautiful stranger to yourself
