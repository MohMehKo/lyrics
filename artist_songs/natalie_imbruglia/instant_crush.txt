I didn't want to be the one to forget
I thought of everything I'd never regret
A little time with you is all that I get
That's all I need because it's all we can take

You use me once if I'd look in on his dog
You made an offer for it, then you ran off
I got this picture of us kids in my head
And all I hear is the last thing that you said

I listened to your problems
Now listen to mine
I didn't want to anymore, oh oh oh

And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
'Cause I know it unlocks like a door
And we will never be alone again
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
Some more again

It didn't matter what they wanted to see
He thought he saw someone that looked just like me
The summer memory that just never dies
We worked too long and hard to give it no time

One thousand lonely stars hiding in the cold
Take it, I don't wanna sing anymore

I listened to your problems
Now listen to mine
I didn't want to anymore, oh oh oh

And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away
And now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend

I don't understand, don't get upset
I'm not with you
We're swimming around, it's all I do, 
when I'm with you

And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away
And now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
'Cause I know it unlocks like a door

And we will never be alone again
we will never be alone again
we will never be alone again
