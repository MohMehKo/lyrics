Twenty cities have past me by
Keep finding treasures I don't want to find
But I've stolen and I've crossed the line and I want you, I want you
Twenty seconds and you could be gone
You shine brighter than the morning sun
You think its over but its just begun, and I want you, I want you

This sky is grey,its full of gold
Can feel your heart and feel your soul
I'll drink it up and take it slow I don't need anything else

Tell me where I'm heading,
Tell me that I can be there soon
Somewhere I forgotten, I'll die a little more for you
When everything is broken
There's a piece I never use
I keep finding reasons to die a little more for you

Twenty questions ringing in my head
The moment sober but its never dead
What did I say and what is all this man, cause I want you, I want you
The fire light as it hits your eye
The heads all turn as you walk on by
Baby we belong in another time, but I still want you, I want you

This sky is grey,its full of gold
Can feel your heart and feel your soul
I'll drink it up and take it slow I don't need anything else

Tell me where I'm heading,
Tell me that I can be there soon
Somewhere I forgotten, I'll die a little more for you
When everything is broken
There's a piece i never use
I keep finding reasons to die a little more for you

Die a little more for you

How many things can you wish for
Cause wishing is all I do
When it comes to you
How many lies can you live through
How many times can you keep moving, keep moving on

Tell me where I'm heading,
Tell me that I can be there soon
Somewhere I forgotten, I'll die a little more for you
When everything is broken
There's a piece I never use
I keep finding reasons to die a little more for you,
to die a little more for you, to die a little more for you.
