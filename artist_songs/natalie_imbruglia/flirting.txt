I walked in your life today
Never thought I'd feel this way
What did you do
Was it by mistake?

Then you told me not to cry
You couldn't look me in the eye
Just worry about me when you're ok

So tell me, lovely
And reaching for me
For a moment we could drift away

And tell me, after
When flirting with the disaster
Fine, love, everything's ok

I was taken by surprise
It took a hold, it took me high
And I'm not ready to come down yet

The silence keeps on holding me back
You keeping filling in the gap
So many roads
But you've got the map

So tell me, lovely
You're reaching for me
For a moment we could drift away

And tell me, after
When flirting with the disaster
Fine love, everything's ok

Not far to go
We're half away around
Just hold my hand
And listen to the sound

Nanananana, Nanananana

Worry about it
But it's ok

Tell me, lovely
And reaching for me
For a moment we could drift away

And tell me, after
When flirting with the disaster
Fine love, everything's ok

And tell me, lovely
That you could love me
And finely, we could drift away

And tell me, this is the answer
Flirting with the disaster
For you, babe, I'd do it all again

Again, again, again, again

Again... Again... Again... Again
