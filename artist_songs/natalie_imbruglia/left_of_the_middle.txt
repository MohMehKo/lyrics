End of the third round
as I put the phone down
chasing the same lines
over the old ground
I'm pushing zero
where s my hero
he's out there somewhere
left of the middle
and your world falls down
and you're there calling out
but it's something I can't say
though it seems the only way
but it's a game that I can't play - not today

I got my ticket
find I got a straight road
but I'm passing the same signs
over and over
and my world falls down
and I'm there calling out 
but it's something I cant say
though it's the only way 
but it's a game that I can't play - not today

I need to tell you
trying to get through
it's not always easy
left of the middle
