When the rose.
slaps your face
says your pain is a state of grace (I think that's right)
mirror cracks
image bleeds
he'll touch your desires
but not your needs

I stand at an open window
I see everything there is to see
I've been watching you
isn't it true the fool keeps taking you down down
taking you
I've been watching you 
isn't it true the world keeps taking you down down
taking you 

party ends
on the floor 
hear a voice 
behind the door
in the dark
you play his games
forget yourself
forget your name

I stand at an open window
I see everything there is to see
I've been watching you
isn't it true the fool keeps taking you down down
taking you
I've been watching you 
isn't it true the world keeps taking you down down
taking you 

so there you are all dressed in black
walk away and don't look back
but if you must then cast a stone
the light is on but there's nothing and no one home (I think)

cos i've been watching you
isn't it true the fool keeps taking you down down
taIking you
I've been watching you 
isn't it true the world keeps taking you down down
taking you 

I said I i've been watching you 
Isn't it true the fool keeps taking you down down
taking you
I've been watching you
isn't true the world keeps taking you down down
taking you down.
