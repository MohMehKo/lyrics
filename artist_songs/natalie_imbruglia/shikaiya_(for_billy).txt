Five years old
A life that made me shy 
I'm telling you 
Shikaiya made me feel like I could fly
There she was so crazy 
but she was on fire 
the smile behind the door of every answer to my questions 
you made it seem like everything was possible 
and that's where you stood out from everybody else 
Shikaiya 
That's what your about and you should never lose yourself 
Shikaiya 
down the phone years and miles apart 
we try to find the magic we used to bounce from heart to heart 
but you don't seem to believe in anything today 
I wonder if your dreams got smashed 
upon the rocks of that old bay 
you made me feel like everything was beautiful 
and that's where you stood out from everybody else 
Shikaiya 
and that's what your about and you should never lose yourself 
Shikaiya 
Shikaiya nothing 
mmm Shikaiya 
Shikaiya 
Shikaiya 
that's what your about and you should never lose yourself 
Shikaiya
