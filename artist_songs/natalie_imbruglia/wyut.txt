Back track, listen, stop, that before everything is lost
again, you lie away
Stand back, give it slack, you don't know where my head is at,
your in, too deep, don't try

Ooh Ooh, Ooh Ooh, I don't want, I don't want what you're up to
Ooh Ooh, Ooh Ooh, I don't need, I don't need what you're up to
Better sit down better turn around go,
better go now here's a boat now row
I don't want, I don't want what you're up to no

You grab, never give back and think I don't see through that,
I do, I'm on to you
Too far, pushing your luck,
get off it's the end of the line, for you, and now, you're mine

Ooh Ooh, Ooh Ooh, I don't want, I don't want what you're up to
Ooh Ooh, Ooh Ooh, I don't need, I don't need what you're up to
Better sit down better turn around go,
better go now here's a boat now row
I don't want, I don't want what you're up to no

I don't want, I don't want what you're up to
I don't want, I don't want what you're up to
I don't want, I don't want what you're up to
I don't want, I don't want what you're up to
I don't want, I don't want what you're up to
I don't want, I don't want what you're up to

Stand back, give it slack,
you don't know where my head is at, I do, I'm on to you

Ooh Ooh, Ooh Ooh, I don't want, I don't want what you're up to
Ooh Ooh, Ooh Ooh, I don't need, I don't need what you're up to
Better sit down better turn around go,
better go now here's a boat now row
I don't want, I don't want what you're up to,
I don't want, I don't want what what you're up to no.
