I won't say anything
I'm hiding in the pink
if I move would I break the spell
or am I boring you

I can't feel anything
I think whatever you say
you took me riding on the big wheel
so I guess I'm happy now

And I'll stay with you
and I'll lay with you
and I'll always be there
nothing will go wrong
till something better comes along

So now you swallowed me
come and finish off the rest of me
a good house a cactus life
spent perfect days and sleepless nights whatever

And I'll stay with you
and I'll lay with you
and I'll always be there
nothing will go wrong
till something better comes along

And I 've lost my fingerprints
and I 've lost my sixth sense
but you just don't feel a thing
when the needles going in

And I'll stay with you
and I'll lay with you
and I'll always be there
oh go nowhere
and I'll stay with you
till something better comes along....

So now you swallowed me
come and finish off the rest of me
