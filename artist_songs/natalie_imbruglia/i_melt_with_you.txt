Moving forward using all my breath
Making love to you was never second best
I saw the world rushing all around your face
Never really knowing it was always mesh and lace

I'll stop the world and melt with you
You've seen the difference 
and it's getting better all the time
There's nothing you and I won't do
I'll stop the world and melt with you

Dream of better lives
The kind which never hate
Wrapped in a state of imaginary grace
I made a pilgrimage to save this human race
Never comprehending the race had long gone by

I'll stop the world and melt with you
You've seen the difference 
and it's getting better all the time
There's nothing you and I won't do
I'll stop the world and melt with you

The future is open wide

I'll stop the world and melt with you
I've seen some changes 
but it's getting better all the time
There's nothing you and I won't do
The future is open wide
Hmm Hmm Hmm Hmm Hmm Hmm
I'll stop the world and melt with you
