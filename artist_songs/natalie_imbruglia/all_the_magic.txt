Promises have meaning once again
And broken dreams are drifting to an end
I feel it like my life has just begun
I'm waking for the first time
Waking' for the first time
Waking for the very first time to the sun

I'm getting a feeling that I wanna explore
My heart to the ceiling and my feet off the floor
You let in all the magic
And it's even better than before
You open your heart and then you open the door
I'm getting all the magic

Desert land is drinking from the sky
Ever since I heard the words that made me cry
There's love in shadows waiting to be seen
I'm waking for the first time
Waking for the first time
Waking for the very first time to a dream

I'm getting a feeling that I wanna explore
My heart to the ceiling and my feet off the floor
You let in all the magic
And it's even better than before
You open your heart and then you open the door
I'm getting all the magic

All I can take, all I can take
I won't break
All I can take, all I can take

I'm getting a feeling that I wanna explore
My heart to the ceiling and my feet off the floor
You let in all the magic
And it's even better than before
You open your heart and then you open the door
I'm getting all the magic

I'm getting all the magic
I'm getting all the magic
Could you imagine
All the magic
I'm getting all the magic
