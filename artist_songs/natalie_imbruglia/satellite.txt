Do you lie awake
In the morning
Trying to find
A reason to call me
'Cause honey
All that I've been doing
Is thinking about your smile
But none of this is necessary
With me baby
You see baby
'Cause I like to
Keep it all simple
'Cause you are my
Satellite
So I'm trying to
Keep you in sight
But with all this space
Can we keep it alive
Keep it alive
So I'm asking you baby
Are you coming down tonight

There's something
In the air tonight
That feels right
But you're keeping me
Guessing and I'm
Finding it hard to
Catch your eye
So move a little closer
It's all right
I know
What you're thinking
You've been circling me
For a while
