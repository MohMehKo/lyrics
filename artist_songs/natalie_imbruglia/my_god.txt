I'm feeling kinda strange
I'm feeling kinda jammed up and outta the way
I know it's all derranged
And nothing's gonna give til I'm outta this place
Looking at the horizon
I wanted to rewind everything is blinding
I'm gonna take your time
I wonder if you float while the sea is rising

I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know the way you make me feel
Here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go again

My god your face is so beautiful
My god I see you so clearly
If I could stay with you
Oh my god I'd give my soul there's nothing else
My god don't you leave me here

You're looking for a flower
You're looking for a flower but you find a tree
I'm looking for a river
And suddenly an ocean is washing over me

I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know the way you make me feel
Here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go again

My god your face is so beautiful
My god I see you so clearly
If I could stay with you
Oh my god I'd give my soul there's nothing else
My god don't you leave me here

I wanted to know you
Wanted to see you
Wanted to feel you
Shoulda believed you
Wanted to hold you
Wanted to show you
Wanted to be you, be you

My god your face is so beautiful
My god I see you so clearly
If I could stay with you
Oh my god I'd give my soul there's nothing else
My god don't you leave me here
