Seventeen years in a dead end job
telling his dreams to a deaf eared god
Hangin' on tight by a single thread
prayin' for a change.
Everything you could have sacrificed
your flesh and blood had it's own sweet price
baby's all grown up and moved away
where's that leave you now?

It was your own decision
you made my life your mission.
Somebody tell me
it doesn't make no sense at all
Somebody tell me
Why we're living in a world of contradiction.
Somebody tell me
it doesn't make no sense at all
Somebody tell me
why we're living in a world of contradiction.

Why is it so hard to be understood?
Doing so much for the common good
sorry if I didn't see the truth
the sadness in your eyes
I wanted to stand on my own two feet
looking at life as a one way street.
Thinking that I had it all worked out
where's that leave me now?
We lost communication
too many expectations

Somebody tell me
it doesn't make no sense at all
Somebody tell me
Why we're living in a world of contradiction.
Somebody tell me
it doesn't make no sense at all
Somebody tell me
Why we're living in a world of contradiction.

Everything I have inside
I kept it wrapped up tight
All I know is ..
All I want to know is...
Somebody tell me.
Somebody tell me
it doesn't make no sense at all
Somebody tell me
Why we're living in a world of contradiction
In a world of contradiction.
