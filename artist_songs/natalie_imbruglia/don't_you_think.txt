Some people
don't worry
about nothing
don't know what's going on
I'm not one
who cant say they're sorry
I just care what's going on
there's more important things
than making sure your watch looks just right
and second hand opinions
don't make you look any smarter
don't you think
don't you think
don't you think that maybe it's time, yes it's time
time you started thinking
time you started thinking
and don 't just sweeten up the taste

brother shoots brother
but meanwhile you're fixing up your face
you're not affected by the truth
unless it's on your doorstep
deodorize your paradise
no point in getting crazy 
don't you think
don't you think
don't you think that maybe it's time, yes it's time
time you started thinking 'bout things in the back of your
head

someone said before you turn a blind eye
hear a bell ring sex sells everything
but I don't buy it so don't try it
sleeping in the small world head in the sand
better wash your hands, make a new plan
there's more important things
than making sure your shoes walk just right
ignore reality there s nothing you can td about it... 
the clothes you wear don t make the man
it's just another party
[chorus]
