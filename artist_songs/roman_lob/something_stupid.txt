Let's play to lose, but bet on each other
Let's keep breaking the rules and always be lovers, oh oh oh
Tell me I look good and tell tell me that you hate it
And when we're making love tell me that you fake it

Walk through flames
Jump out of planes
Let's do something stupid
Let's play dead never be scared
Let's do something stupid

yeah yeah yeah let's do something
yeah yeah yeah let's do something stupid

Let's argue all night - all over nothing
Head first into a fight, we better get running
Let's steal a car, drive it out into the ocean
Let's commit a crime, give ourselves up - yeah

Walk through flames
Jump out of planes
Let's do something stupid
Rob a bank be mad romantic
Let's do something stupid
Let's play dead never be scared
Let's do something stupid

yeah yeah yeah let's do something
yeah yeah yeah let's do something stupid

Stare at the sun, 'till we're crazy
Do what we want, don't be lazy
Step up the gear, don't have no fear

Walk through flames
Jump out of planes
Let's do something stupid
Rob a bank be mad romantic
Let's do something stupid
Let's play dead never be scared
Let's do something stupid
Hate them all or fall in love
Let's do something stupid

yeah yeah yeah let's do something
yeah yeah yeah let's do something stupid
