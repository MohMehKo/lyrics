Thousand miles away
I can't believe
And I'm alone
For many years

Not a bit from you
And no more breath
My heart beats
Into your chest

Please tell me why
You're going away
And I think about you
Day by day

Please tell me why
You leave me here
And I think about you
Day by day

I'll rebound again
Come back to me
And tell me
What I have done wrong

Not a bit from you
And no more breath
My heart beats
Into your chest

Please tell me why
You're going away
And I think about you
Day by day

Please tell me why
You leave me here
And I think about you
Day by day

And I think about you
Day by day [2x]

Not a bit from you
And no more breath
My heart beats
Into your chest

Please tell me why
You're going away
And I think about you
Day by day

Please tell me why
You leave me here
And I think about you
Day by day

Day by day [2x]
