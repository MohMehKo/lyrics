Guess we knew this was coming on
‘Cause you’re already gone in my head
You can tell me that I’m wrong
That you’re staying with me instead

When winter has come along and summer’s dead and gone
Is there anything left here to say?
I can put my arms around the emptiness I found
Find a way to make you stay

But I’m standing still, I’m standing still
As you leave me now
I’m standing still, I’m standing still
As you’re walking out
I’m just standing still

Never thought I’d be so strong
But pieces of me break so easy
What I thought would be the end
Is just the feeling that you freed me

Girl this ain’t giving up, it’s knowing where to stop
Knowing everything is over
I know my love is blind, I see for the first time
This ain’t gonna bring us closer

'Cause I’m standing still, I’m standing still
As you leave me now, yeah
I’m standing still, I’m standing still
As you’re walking out

I’m standing still...
I’m just standing still as you leave me now
I’m just standing still

When winter's come along and summer's dead and gone
Is there anything left here to say?
I can put my arms around the emptiness I found
Find a way to make you stay

I’m standing still, I’m standing still
As you leave me now, yeah
I’m standing still, I’m standing still
As you’re walking out
I’m just standing still

I'm just standing still
Yeah, I'm just standing still
Just standing still
