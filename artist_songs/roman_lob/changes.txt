Go take it out on me
What you're about to see
It's just a pale shadow
Of what I'm about to be

Maybe I'll fly high
Make this town my home
And of course I'll die
I stand my ground alone

I know - I'm taking my chances
Making it right tonight
I know - I feel the changes in my life

I know - I'm making a difference
Here is a vital sign
I know - These are the changes in my life

I know - I'm taking my chances
Making it right tonight
I know - I feel the changes in my life

To all my friends along the way
What is there left to say
When every story is just like a copy
Of each and everyday

People they say all
People they do all crazy kind of things
Whatever the news is we all know the truth is
Bigger than we think - let me tell you now

I know - I'm taking my chances
Making it right tonight
I know - I feel the changes in my life

I know - I'm making a difference
Here is a vital sign
I know - These are the changes in my life

I know - I'm taking my chances
Making it right tonight
I know - I feel the changes in my life

I know - I'm making a difference
Here is a vital sign
I know - These are the changes in my life

Feeling slightly different
Every time I'm breathing out
Holding on to all those changes
I gotta make them mine
Cause I'm breathing all the time

I know - I'm making a difference
Here is a vital sign
I know - These are the changes in my life

I know - I'm taking my chances
Making it right tonight
I know - I feel the changes in my life

I know - I'm making a difference
Here is a vital sign
I know - These are the changes in my life

I know - I'm making a difference
Here is a vital sign
I know - These are the changes in my life
