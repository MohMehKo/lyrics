You never can be sure of what will happen
First time that I saw you I knew it all
You turned my life around within a second
It's all different from now on

So you'll never know what love is
Till you finally lose control
Clearly home is where the heart is
But baby that's the hardest part of all

Never gonna love again I know
Like I did for the first time
Maybe I got lost again, or so
In these ever changing times
Maybe I'll get hurt again, who knows
But surely I will try
You can stay with me
Or say goodbye

Maybe you'll be there to share my pleasure
But will you stay with me to share the pain
We all know that nothing lasts forever
But in the end we'll do it all again

So you'll never know what love is
Till you finally lose control (got to lose it all)
Clearly home is where the heart is
Baby that's the hardest part of all

Never gonna love again I know
Like I did for the first time
Maybe I got lost again, or so
In these ever changing times
Maybe I'll get hurt again, who knows
But surely I will try
You can stay with me
Or say goodbye

Never gonna love again
Maybe I got lost again, I know
Maybe I'll get hurt again
It's crazy life I'm in
And that is why they all just say that

That you never know what love is
Till you finally lose control
Clearly home is where the heart is
Baby that's the hardest part of all

Never gonna love again I know
Like I did for the first time
Maybe I got lost again, or so
In these ever changing times
Maybe I'll get hurt again, who knows
But surely I will try
You can stay with me
Or say goodbye
