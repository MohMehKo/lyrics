Everything that you just said was true
I'm standing here I can't believe my eyes
As they just try to focus you
Give me just a second

This is my reality
Everything is new
You kicked the doors wide open
And you pushed me through

Dream on my love
Through the clouds and stormy weather
We're counting stars
I love you more than ever

Traffic lights turn blue and that means - glide
Tell my friends that I'm alright now
100 Million ways to spend your time
You kicked the doors wide open
And I say

Dream on my love
Through the clouds and stormy weather
We're counting stars
I love you more than ever

This is my reality
Everything, everything is new
You kicked the doors wide open
And pushed me through

You know exactly what to - do

Dream on my love
Trough the clouds an stormy weather
We're counting stars
I love you more than ever

Dream on my love

We're counting stars
