You like it smooth, so I'll give it to you
Just how you like it, baby
Yeah, that's what we'll do
You ask me once, you won't have to beg
I hear you loud and clear
It will happen like that, like that, like that, like that

I change your life to gold
And once you're mine
You'll know what you've been missing
I want all of this time

I'm gonna make you smile
Like you've never ever smiled before
Make you feel wonderful, wonderful forever more
I'm gonna hold you tight
And I'll never ever let you go
'Cuz you're so wonderful - you got it all

You wanna take it slow, so that's what we'll do
Cuz I don't mind doing anything that pleases you, that pleases you
I'll take my time, you better believe
Now that I found you baby
I'll never leave, I'll never leave, no

Things won't be bad - no, no
And you'll be - oh so
Glad that you chose me

I'm gonna make you smile
Like you've never ever smiled before
Make you feel wonderful, wonderful forever more
I'm gonna hold you tight
And I'll never ever let you go
'Cuz you're so wonderful - you got it all

I promised I won't let you down, baby
You know I'll always be around, baby
So come and take my hands
Just give me the chance and I show you baby
That I'm the one 'cause I will
I'm gonna make you

I'm gonna make you smile
Like you've never ever smiled before
Make you feel wonderful, wonderful forever more
I'm gonna hold you tight
And I'll never ever let you go
'Cuz you're so wonderful - you got it all
