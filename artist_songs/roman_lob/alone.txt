We travelled to a star
Lights on, we made our own way
Our satellite got lost in the dark
Does everyone get hurt along the way?

Out here I can't cut though the air
Must fear, I can't get back

Alone, alone
Can't help in everything you dream
But I guess we'll never know
I know that the future is just an empty space

And I don't know where to go, let go
You watch as your world falls apart
And you're standing there alone, alone, alone

Was it all so clear?
Eyes closed, our feet were on the ground
Why when you were here
We never took time to break for sunset?

Back then we had so much to
Defend, and now I fight

Alone, alone
Can't help in everything you dream
But I guess we'll never know
I know that the future is just an empty space

And I don't know where to go, let go
You watch as your world falls apart
And you're standing there alone, alone, alone

Escaping, we're chasing
Never comes back, never comes back
Our future is facing me

We travelled to a star
Light years from the promise that we made
And I can't get back

Alone, alone
Can't help in everything you dream
But I guess we'll never know
I know that the future is just an empty space

And I don't know where to go, let go
You watch as your world falls apart
And you're standing there alone, alone, alone
Through the unknown
