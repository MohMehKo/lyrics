I hear rehab's nice
Their sheets are as whote as your white lies
If they can fix my power all over again
They can fix your fiend for greed my friend
My friend

I can feel
I can feel a revolution
I can see
I can see some revolution

I hear exile's infe
We'll walk you out in a hero's line
It's better than the prison that your soul belongs
Sleeping next to children you left alone
Then maybe we can have our world
Maybe we can have our world

I can feel
I can feel a revolution
I can see
I can see some revolution

I can feel
I can feel
I can feel
I can finally feel a revolution
I can see
I can see a revolution

I can feel a revolution
I can see some revolution
I can feel
I can see

I can feel
I can feel a revolution
I can see
I can see some revolution
