Drinking wine out of paper cups
At least three times I fell in love
They said jump inot the river
While you watch the stars above

And the moon it shone so bright
I wasn't sure if it was night time
Or day time
Or both at the same time

Where were you when I
Had the time of my life
I don't know why
You'd rather cry instead of flying

Where were you when I
Had the best day of my life
I don't know why
You'd rather cry instead of flying

The world it moves under my feet
And I don't care where it takes me
Yeah, your eyes blink to the beat
Limitless and free

And the moon it shone so bright
I wasn't sure if it was night timt
Or day time
Or both at the same time

Where were you when I
Had the time of my life
I don't know why
You'd rather cry instead of flying

Where were you when I
Had the best day of my life
I don't know why
You'd rather cry instead of flying

Drinking wine out of paper cups
At least three times I fell in love
They said jump into the river while you watch the stars

And I watched the stars
All the stars...

Where were you when I
Had the time of my life
I don't know why
You'd rather cry instead of flying

Where were you when I
Had the best day of my life
I don't know why
You'd rather cry instead of flying
