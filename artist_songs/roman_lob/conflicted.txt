I've been seeing a shrank
Try to get why I feel this blame
but it don't get it
Even on a minute

But I think he's never been in love
Try to ask my friends
What they think I should do
But it doesn't matter what they say

So this time I turn to you
Tell me what to do

Cause I'm so conflicted
So conflicted
I'm loosing my mind
And I'm so addicted
And so sick of you
At the same time

Tell me what's on your mind
All pretend that I'm blind
I can see that you're hurting too

That you single all lights
When the more that you lied
Is it because you decided
It's the best to leave it alone

Baby isn't it time
That we let her go down
And along this feelings through
Baby now I turn to you
Let's figure out what to do

Cause I'm so conflicted
So conflicted
I'm loosing my mind
And I'm so addicted
And so sick of you
At the same time

Oh, I'm so conflicted
So conflicted
Going out of my mind
Cause I feel disconnected
And in Love with you
At the same time

People say when your heart is over
There's a way to be free
So turn around
I need to tell you something
And something you should tell me

Baby I'm so conflicted
So conflicted
I'm loosing my mind
Cause I'm so addicted
And so sick of you
At the same time

Yes, I'm so conflicted
So conflicted
Going out of my mind
Can I be disconnected
And in love with you
At the same time
