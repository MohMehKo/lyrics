When you came into my room last night
And took off all your clothes
Did you think I would resist
Letting you inside
Did you think I would resist you
My favourite samurai

You swam across the bedroom
Drunk on my champagne
You got into the air
Across the river Wye
And pushed aside your headstone
My favourite samurai

Then you showed me something
I didn't know
How to let go
I was falling
Through the Tivoli sky
Expecting to fly
Expecting to fly

When I stood beside your tomb last night
Recalling how you rose
Did you think I would persist
Refusing to die
See how I've persisted
Favourite samurai
Favourite samurai
My favourite samurai
