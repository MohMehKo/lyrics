Hey baby
I wanna know
How much
Did you get for your soul?
You had the gospel
When you were shackled to a tree
Now you've got your freedom
You sing for the money
Soul
Soul
Soul
Soul
How much did ya
How much did ya
How much did ya get?

Hey babe
Tell me please
How much
Did you get for that sleaze?
You finally made it
Right up to the top
Millions of kids are looking at you
You say let them drink soda pop
Soul
Soul
Soul
Soul
How much did ya
How much did ya
How much did ya get?

Who's got soul?
Who's got soul?
From the african nation
To the pepsi generation
Who's got soul?
Who's got soul?

It dwell from tree to sea
Every living entity
Share the super soul
We got super soul
Who's got soul?
Who could think that you're for real -
A puppet in a cabaret
To increase your wealth
Baby realise yourself

Hey baby
I wanna know
From the 'a-go-go' to the disco
Where did you really go?
You finally made it
You're gonna make it rich
As long as some poor bastard in africa
Is lying in a ditch
Soul
Soul
Soul
Soul
How much did ya
How much did ya
How much did ya get?
