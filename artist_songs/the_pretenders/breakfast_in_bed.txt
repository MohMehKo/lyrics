You've been cryin', your face is a mess
Come here, baby, you can dry
The tears on my dress
Oh, I know that look so well

Don't be shy
You've been here before
Pull your shoes off, lie down
And I will lock the door

And no one has to know
You've come here again
Darling, it will be
Like it's always been before
Come over here

Breakfast in bed and a kiss or three
You don't have to say you love me
Breakfast in bed, nothing need be said
Ain't no need

What's your hurry?
Please don't eat and run
You can let her wait
My darling, it's been so long

Since I've had you here
You can come again
Darling, it will be
Like it's always been before

Breakfast in bed and a kiss or three
You don't have to say you love me
Breakfast in bed, nothing need be said
Ain't no need

Breakfast in bed and a kiss or three
You don't have to say you love me
Breakfast in bed and a kiss or three
Honey, you don't have to say you love me

Breakfast in bed and a kiss or three
Oh darling, come on over here, darling and gimme a
Breakfast in bed, kiss or three
You don't have to say you love me
Breakfast in bed, kiss or three
