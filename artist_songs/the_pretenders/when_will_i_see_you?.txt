When the days
are getting longer
and the people
come out on the streets at night
I'll be among
the starry eyes
I'll be among
the wishful sighs
I'll be among
the fools, forever fantasizing

When will I see you?
summertime would be perfect
When will I see you?
could be a long summertime
When will I see you?
endless nights of love could be ours
When will I see you?

When the nights
are getting warmer
and the dawn comes in on the wings of a song
I'll be among
the hopeful few
I'll be among
the morning dew
I'll be among 
everything new

When will I see you?
summertime would be perfect
When will I see you?
there'll be no-one around
When will I see you?
endless nights of love could be ours
When will I see you?

Demand the impossible!
everyone will be free
We'll walk down the Avenue
Openly - openly

When the days
are getting longer
and the people
come out on the streets at night
I'll be the one
who knows your name
I'll be the one
who plays the game
I'll be the one
again and again and again
again and again and again, asking

When will I see you?
summertime would be just perfect
When will I see you?
could be a long summertime
When will I see you?
endless nights of love could be ours
When will I see you?

Demand the impossible!
Everyone will be free
