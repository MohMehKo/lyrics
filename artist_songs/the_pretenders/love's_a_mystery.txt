Lovers of today unlike lovers of the past
They used to find a way to get a love affair to last
I saw him leaving, that's is all I had to see
If seeing is believing then

Love's a mystery, it's a mystery
It'll rise without a warning leaving evidence and clues
Making headlines in the morning then it's history
Love's a mystery but I'll do it again, I'll do it again

Lovers of today are becoming too adversed
Get the feeling you are on stage badly unrehearsed
Had the moves done so perfectly
I guess all that proves is

Love's a mystery, it's a mystery
It'll rise without a warning making leaving evidence and clues
Making headlines in the morning then it's history
Love's a mystery but I'll do it again, I'll do it again

The multiple offender should learn from his mistakes
I am ready to surrender if that's what it takes
We did our time still in custody
If loving is a crime

Love's a mystery but I'll do it again, I'll do it again
It'll rise without a warning leaving evidence and clues
It headlines in the morning then it's history
Love's a mystery, love's a mystery
