Along by the canal
You can see the remnants of last night's reverie
As left by the local tenants
But these aren't the gifts they give free in shopping malls
This is real life that's sprayed across the tunnel walls

You know who your friends are
You know who your friends are
They're the ones who want to see you go far
You know who your friends are

The last time you tried to leave here for a working holiday
You said your mother needed you two thousand miles away
But no sooner on the tarmac you were met to be told
We've been waiting for you
You just can't leave the fold

You know who your friends are
You know who your friends are
They're the ones who want to see you go far
You know who your friends are

They'll never let you go
They'll never let you know who your friends are
Know who your friends are

They say that loyalty is just for those who've earned it
Is that why they stole the sofa from your parking space and burned it
You were hoping you could leave here with some teeth still in your head
But your friends on curtain row would rather see you dead

You know who your friends are
You know who your friends are
They're the ones who want to see you go far
You know who your friends are
