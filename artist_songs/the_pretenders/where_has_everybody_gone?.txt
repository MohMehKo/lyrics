Where has everybody gone?
I've got this feelin,
Goin to end up here on my own.
Where's my support now?
Where's the ranks of the strong?
In this faceless crowd, where can I belong?

Everybody's gone insane to catch a plane to have their Heavens closer,
They want the Kingdom but they don't want the King - they want his throne.
And there's no time - there's no time at all!

Where has everybody gone?
With great pleasure,
I sing your national song.
Because you're beautiful,
And you'll soon be long gone.
And the ashes of your memoirs will be strewn across the lawn.

Pack your face, save your cases of your place in the Everafter.
These hallowed Halls are lined with walls that are cracked by the Myria's laughter.
And there's no time - there's no time at all!

Where has everybody gone?
There's no time,
There's no time at all...
