I like the way you cross the street 'cause your precious
Moving through the cleveland heat how precious
Taking rides and all the kicks was so precious
But you know I was shittin' bricks 'cause I'm precious

Made me wanna, made me wanna, you made me make it
Oh, you're so mean

East 55th and euclid avenue was real precious
Hotel sterling coming into view how precious
It's a pity that you bruised my hip 'cause I'm precious
You shouldn't let your manners slip you're too precious

Made me wanna, made me wanna, you made me make it
Oh, you're so mean

We went around and round and round and round and round the
Shoreway
We was a duet duet duet duet do it on the pavement
Oh maybe maybe I'm gonna have a baby
We was a duet oh we do it all night

I was feeling kind of ethereal 'cause I'm precious
I had my eye on your imperial you're so precious
Now howard the duck and mr stress both stayed
Trapped in a world that they never made
But not me baby I'm too precious I had to fuck off

Made me wanna, made me wanna, you made me make it
Oh, you're so mean
