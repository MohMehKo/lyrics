You believed in me
When you had nothing to gain
You stood by me
You walked out in the falling rain
To find me
Waiting in the shadows behind me

Baby please
Please
Won't you do it one more time
Do it one more time
Do it one more time
Please
Won't you do it one more time

You stayed when no one else would
When i was delayed you understood
I've done some low down things
Alright but you said i was good
I couldn't forgive myself
But you could

Won't you please
Please
Won't you do it one more time
Do it one more time
Do it one more time
Please
Won't you do it one more time

I know i've made you promises
Then i forget
I've let you down darling
I'm forever in your debt
In my darkest hour i've
Turned you out
But when the mood has passed
You came back in spite of me
Saying "this love, this love was meant to last"

Oh baby
Won't you please
Won't you do it one more time
Do it one more time with feeling
Oh baby
Please
Won't you do it one more time
One more time
Please
Won't you do it one more time

With feeling
