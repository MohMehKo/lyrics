How do I miss you?
How do I miss you?
when you're gone
when you're gone

You silly Welsh git
you were sold down the river
like a slave changing hands
from master to master
The leaves will turn brown
and fall to the ground
and another summer is gone
- Gone is the summer with you

How do I miss you?
How do I miss you?
when you're gone
when you're gone

It got so when I looked at you
I did it for a laugh
Now your laughter fills the room
when I'm trying to take a bath
When the chorus of the dawn
fills the valley with song
Baby what could be wrong?
- My heart is breaking in two
Oh

How do I miss you?

That's the way
the mighty they fall 
Break their legs
and they don't stand so tall

Bundled up and trussed up were the goods to be delivered
I stood in the doorway
and cried and I shivered
I be walking down the street
to the carnival beat
but I'm dragging my feet
- Because I'm hopelessly blue
Oh

How do I miss you?
How do I miss you?
when you're gone
when you're gone
when you're gone
when you're gone
