When you pack your clothes tonight, don't pack up all the blame
You're not the first to walk away and leave someone in pain
I know how much it's hurting you, hurting me this way
Believe me, I've been in your shoes and I know you can't stay

I've been on both sides of goodbye
And I know there ain't no easy side
I've loved and I've been loved but not at the same time
I've been on both sides of goodbye

Don't feel so bad for doing what you have to do
You can't make your heart love me if it doesn't want to
When love doesn't go both ways and someone's got to go
So close that door and don't look back, believe me I know

I've been on both sides of goodbye
And I know there ain't no easy side
I've loved and I've been loved but not at the same time
I've been on both sides of goodbye
