If there was a man I could dream of
I'd dream about a dream come true
If there was a man I could ever love
I'd wait a million years for someone just like you

All my life I have been waiting
Never taking any chances, always hesitating
Where's the prayer, where's the glory
Where's the one I'm holding out for
When's he walking through the door
The one that you walked through
If he isn't you

If there was a man I could dream of
I'd dream about a dream come true
If there was a man I could ever love
I'd wait a million years for someone just like you

Happy endings never find me
I put all my fantasies and hopes of love behind me
Saw my moments overdoomed but
If there was a man out there for me
I wish it would be
Someone who could love me too
If someone was you
