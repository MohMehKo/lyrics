Thank you boy
For the beautiful flower
Thank you boy for the stars in your eyes
Thank you boy for giving me your finest hour
What a surprise
You didn't have to

Thank you boy for the time that we wasted
Thank you boy for the things that you said
Thank you boy for evry strange thought I tasted
Your off your head
You didn't have to

And hearing my story from your
Occupied territory

Thank you boy for the sign of your voices
Like a hammer or drill
Thank you boy for giving me no choices
You know I will
You didn't have to
