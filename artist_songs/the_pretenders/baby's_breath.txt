There was a time you thought I was in love with you.
Well think again, you can't read my thoughts.
You're so pretty I'd like to break your smile in two.
You're so correct I'd like to disconnect the dots.

You're such a child, but you're not innocent
Another kid for rent.

[Chorus:]
Why did you send me roses? Save them for someone's death.
The love you have to offer is only baby's breath.

There was a time I thought you were magnificent
But you've got nothing to have or to hold.
You're so pensive but your thoughts are insignificant.
Wrap 'em up, another 20 billion sold.

You think you're wild and know what danger means
In your designer jeans.

Why did you send me roses? Save them for someone's death.
The love you have to offer is only baby's breath.

I'd like to have you alone tonight and rearrange your mind.
I'd like to have you, but I know I'd be wasting my time.

[Chorus 2x]
