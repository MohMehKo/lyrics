I don't understand how the sun keeps shining,
And I don't understand why the seasons change,
And I don't have a clue,
What makes the rivers flow,
Loving You is All I know,

I cant tell you why stars come out in the evening,
And I cant tell you where they go when there gone,
And I don't have a clue,
What makes a flower grow,
Loving You is All I know,

[Chorus:]
I don't know how the world keeps on spinning round,
I don't know why the sky dont come falling down,
I just know that I would die without your touch,
I don't know why the tide, 
needs to reach the shore,
I just know that I'll need you for, forever more,
Knowing that I guess I know enough,

I cant really say if there is a heaven,
but I feel like it's here when I feel you near me baby,
if angels are real,
They must know how I feel,
Cuz' Loving You Is All I Know

[Chorus]

I don't understand how the sun keeps on shining,
And I don't understand why the seasons change,
And I don't have a clue,
What makes the rivers flow,
Loving You is All I know,
Loving You is All I know.
