Biker, they tell me
You're a dangerous lover
Well, that might be true

Oh, but I'd never ride with another
Maybe they've never had their arms around
Anything so wild and free

You bring the biker out in me

I can't understand it
Why people give you grief?
You play the one armed bandit
Like and outlaw with a belief

To them it's the norm
For a man to conform
To a godless society

You bring the biker out in me
You bring the biker out in me

Because they've no interest
In the struggle to obtain
The status and bogus desires
That drive most people insane

You who have nothing have
Something that only the 1per cent
Could ever see

You bring the biker out in me
You bring the biker out in me
