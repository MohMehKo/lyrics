Marie has set up home
with a woman half my age
a half-wit in a leotard
stands on my stage

The standards have fallen
my value has dropped
but don't shed a tear
some walk like they own the place
whilst others creep in fear

Try if you can
to walk like a man
but if you don't come near
you've got to fly like an eagle
prowl like a lion in Africa
leap like a salmon home from the sea
to keep up with me
you've got to walk like a panther tonight

The old home town just looks the same
like a derelict man who has died out of shame
like a jumble sale left out in the rain
it's not good
it's not right

The standards have fallen
my value has dropped
but don't shed a tear
some walk like they own the place
whilst others creep in fear

Try if you can
to walk like a man
but if you don't come near
you've got to fly like an eagle
prowl like a lion in Africa
leap like a salmon home from the sea
to keep up with me
you've got to walk like a panther tonight

Where did you leave your self respect
you like look like a reptile
your house is a wreck
your existence an insult
and stains that are suspect
cover your clothes

The standards have fallen
my value has dropped
but don't shed a tear
some walk like they own the place
whilst others creep in fear

Try if you can
to walk like a man
but if you don't come near
you've got to fly like an eagle
prowl like a lion in Africa
leap like a salmon home from the sea
to keep up with me
you've got to walk like a panther tonight
walk like a panther tonight
to keep up with me you've got to walk like a panther...
