There was a red brick road where I grew up on
And a pretty stone wall round a fragrant lawn
Fish in the pond that sparkled in the dawn
But it ain't no more, it's all gone, gone, gone

Ram it, cram it, grand slam it, break up the concrete
Prod it, sod it, metal rod it, break up the concrete
Thwak it, crack it, line back it, break up the concrete
Shake it, bake it, earthquake it, break up the concrete
Break up the concrete, break up the concrete

And the depot over there, right next to the tracks
That the slaves put down while breaking their backs
But those Texas zoo, no one would ever get into a carriage
Or anything that might lead to an interracial marriage

Ram it, cram it, grand slam it, break up the concrete
Prod it, sod it, metal rod it, break up the concrete
Thwak it, crack it, line back it, break up the concrete
Shake it, bake it, earthquake it, break up the concrete
Break up the concrete, break up the concrete

Now don't tell me it's progress 'cause that's just a lie
And don't even try to come with an excuse, why?
We were so busy worrying about them dropping the bomb
We didn't notice where our enemy was really coming from
Hey boys, c'mon let's do it

Ram it, cram it, grand slam it, break up the concrete
Prod it, sod it, metal rod it, break up the concrete
Shake it, bake it, earthquake it, break up the concrete
Ram it, slam it, just cram it, break up the concrete

One more time
Break up the concrete, break up the concrete
Now he who laid it come back here and raid it
Break up the concrete, break up the concrete
Break up the concrete, break up the concrete
Break up the concrete
