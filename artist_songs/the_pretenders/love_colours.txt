The sun goes down
The sky turns black
I can hardly wait for you
I can't believe the madness
In everything you do
I used to dream in black and white
Now I see the world in a different light

Your love colours, colours everything
Your love colours, colours everything
Your love colours, colours everything
Your love colours, colours everything
Oh oh
Now come in to me
Fill me and fill me
Show me your colours baby
Your love colours

I slept in fear
And woke in pain
Till you came in close to me
I was cold
Like frozen rain
Your kiss melted me
You speak your mind just like a child
Won't be defined by when you smile

Your love colours, colours everything
Your love colours, colours everything
Your love colours, colours everything
Your love colours, colours everything
Oh oh
Now come in to me
Fill me and fill me
Show me your colours baby
Your love colours

Your love colours everything
Your love colours everything
Your love colours everything
Your love colours everything
