Your private life drama baby leave me out [3x]

J'ai les glands with your theatrics
Your acting's a drag
It's ok on tv 'cause you can turn it off
But don't try me
Yes your marriage is a tragedy
But it's not my concern
I'm very superficial I hate anything official

[Chorus:]
Your private life drama baby leave me out [3x]
[Backup Chorus:]
You've been lying to someone and now me
Stop [3x]

Your sentimental gestures only bore me to death
You've made a desperate appeal now save your breath
Attachment to obligation through guilt and regret
Shit that's so wet
And your sex life complications are not my fascinations

[Chorus]

You asked me for advice I said use the door
But you're still clinging to somebody you deplore
And now you wanna use me for emotional blackmail
I just feel pity when you lie, contempt when you cry

[Chorus]
