Legalise me 
Oh, I want the legal right to be me 
Only me 
Legalise me 
Bail me, jail me 
But they're never gonna nail me 
Pharmaceutically 

I was sleeping like a baby in bed 
When I woke up to a voice in my head 
There's no room here, try down the road is what I said
I'm just a farmer and I grow marijuana 

Oh, baby doll 
Could you tell that I liked that
Oh, baby doll 
We're gonna rattle your combinations 
Up and down 

Legalise me 
Oh, I gotta, gotta, gotta feel free 
Really free 
Legalise me 
Wake me, shake me 
If they're gonna come and take me
Make it legally, yeah

I've been campaigning for the rights of the meek 
Well, I've been holed up in a tree most of the week 
Hey, sir, your crush boxes are starting to leak 
They're saying never 
But we'll wait here forever 
And ever and ever and ever and ever and ever

Oh, baby doll 
Could you tell that I liked that
Oh, baby doll 
We're gonna rattle your combinations 
Up and down 

And if I wanna shake my hair in the sun 
Don't try to flail me for offending anyone 
I don't take prozac and I'll never own a gun 
I'm just a farmer
But, I swear I'd never harm her 

Oh, baby doll 
Yeah
We're gonna rattle your combinations, baby
