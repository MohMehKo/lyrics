You came to me when I was alone
Tried to drag me in to your danger zone
You told me things, got right inside
And showed me things I'd never tried
You got a hold, you wouldn't let go
You lied and lied and lied, it was a great big show

Everything about us looks wrong
But I swear it feels right

People talk, I hear them do it
They think they know and I never knew it
You're a gigolo, I've heard it said
But I've got a sweet name for you instead
They imagine what must thrill
Well, they'll never know for sure, but I will

Everything about us looks wrong
But I swear it feels right
Everything about us looks wrong
But I swear it feels right

Whispering is rude in public places
It's so obvious, it's written on their faces
They think you're taking me for a great big ride
And you know what's more, They're probably right
I'm hopping on with you tonight

You take me up and let me down
Don't like my friends to come around
If you're not center of the stage
You sulk and rant and go into a rage
Oh but I can leave at any time
But I'd miss the oh so absurd and the so sublime

Everything about us looks wrong
But I swear it feels right
Everything about us looks wrong
But I swear it feels right
Everything about us looks wrong
But I swear it feels right
