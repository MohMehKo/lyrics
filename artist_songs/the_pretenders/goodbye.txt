I remember holding on to you
All them long and lonely nights I put you through
Some where in there I'm sure I made you cry
But I can't remember if we said good bye

But I recall all of them nights down in Mexico
One place I might never go in my life again
Was I just off somewhere just to high
But I can't remember if we said good bye

I only miss you every now and then
Like the soft breeze blowin up from the Caribbean
Each November I break down and cry
But I can't remember if we said good bye

But I recall all of them nights down in Mexico
One place I might never go in my life again
Was I just off somewhere just to high
But I can't remember if we said good bye

Good bye
