I been crying like a woman
Because I'm mad, mad, mad like a man
If you'd been in the s.s. in '43
You'd've been kicked out for cruelty

I hurt you
'Cause you hurt me
So I hurt you
'Cause you hurt me

I been wondering about your dependency
Your idea of defiance is a modern day mystery
Arms and chest are cold
When your back is on fire
And the only time you come clean
Is when you're talking to your buyer

I hurt you
'Cause you hurt me
So I hurt you
'Cause you hurt me

Forget our philosophies
That we admired when we were young
And our popular points of view
They can't mean much or nothing
Or something or anything
'Cause we can't say I love you

I hurt you
'Cause you hurt me
So I hurt you
'Cause you hurt me

Happy birthday, darling and thank you for the schooling
Your correction mistress warned me and she wasn't fooling
Never trust a user with your television overnight
When the show he wants to video is dallas on a tuesday night
Don't try to paint your masterpiece under artificial light
