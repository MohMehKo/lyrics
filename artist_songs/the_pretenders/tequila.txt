I drank tequila 'cause I can't have your lips tonight
I don't want to feel ya I don't want to feel sad tonight
You make me suffer and you just don't know
Estoy barrochos down in new mexico

I want to remember but I try to forget
That scene in the car park that I still regret
Just like before, times I've even lost track
I ran away crawling 'cause I fall everytime I look back

Miles, baby, hundreds of highways and truck stops I've used
Cars, baby, hundreds of cars have passed and refused
I stood on the shoulder with tears in my eyes

I drank tequila and watched the game in the bar
I don' t care who loses, I don't know who the teams are
We had our time, but the bell's finally tolled
My ohio winter was finally too cold
