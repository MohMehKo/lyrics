fools must die
so it shall be
take your place in history
show your face
don't be shy
the world rejoices
when fools die

they die, they must die
they die, they must die
everybody gather round
watch them falling to
the ground

fools must die
so it shall pass
bow your head
raise your glass
don't ask when
don't ask why
ask for mercy
cause fools die

they die, they must die
they die, they must die
everybody gather round
watch them stumble to
the ground

fools must die
one by one
indulge yourself
as i have done
as you are now
so once was i
prepare for death
cause fools must die

they die they must die
they die they must die
everybody gather round
watch them falling to the ground.
