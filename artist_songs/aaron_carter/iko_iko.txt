My grandma and your grandma
Were sittin' by the fire.
My grandma told your grandma
"I'm gonna set your flag on fire" 

[Chorus:]
Hey now! Hey now!
Iko, Iko, unday
Jockamo feeno ai nan?
Jockamo fee nan? 

Look at my king all dressed in red Iko, Iko, unday.
I betcha five dollars he'll kill you dead
Jockamo fee nan?
[Chours]

My flag boy and your flag boy
Were sittin' by the fire.
My flag boy told your flag boy
"I'm gonna set your flag on fire"

[Chorus]

See that guy all dressed in green ?
Iko Iko unday 
He's not a man He's a lovin' machine.
Jockamo fee nan?

[Chorus x 2]

[Fade to end]
