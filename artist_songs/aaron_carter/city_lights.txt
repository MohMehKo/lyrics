I turn off the radio
All the windows down
Still seems like your right here beside me
Down every back street
There’s a memory
Can’t believe the way, I still see your face in everything

It won’t stop, no matter where I’m runnin’
You don’t stop, your love just keeps on hauntin’ me
I can’t stop, forgetting that it’s over
But still I’m never alone

Under the city lights, there’s nowhere to get away
It’s like nothing is safe for me
You keep on chasin’ me
Under the city lights, the memories come alive
Burning me deep, inside tonight 
The city lights (city lights)

Look for the sunrise, live for the daylight
That’s the only time I find that you’re not right on my mind
Don’t let the sun go down cause that’s when it happens
It’s getting closer, I feel it comin’ tonight

It won’t stop, no matter where I’m runnin’
You don’t stop, your love just keeps on hauntin’ me
I can’t stop, forgettin’ that it’s over
But still I’m never alone

Under the city lights, there’s nowhere to get away
It’s like nothing is safe for me
You keep on chasin’ me 
Under the city lights, the memories come alive
Burning me deep, inside tonight 
The city lights (Ohhh, city lights)

The night time
Every night was our time
Only live a lifetime, every night
The night time
Every night was our time
Only live a lifetime, lovin’ the night

Under the city lights, there’s nowhere to get away
It’s like nothing is safe for me
You keep on chasin’ me 
Under the city lights, the memories come alive
Burning me deep, inside tonight 
(Let me go, set me free) 
The city lights
(Ohhh, city lights)
(let me go, set me free)

The city lights
The night time
Every night was our time
Only live a lifetime, every night
The night time
Every night was our time
Only live a lifetime, lovin’ the night
