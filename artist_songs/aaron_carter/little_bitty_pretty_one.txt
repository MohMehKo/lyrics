Oh, little bitty pretty one,
C'mon, talk to me
Let me grab you, loving one,
Come sit down on my knee

(It's time to roll, it's time to flow)

I could tell you a story,
It happened long time ago,
Little bitty pretty one,
I been watching you grow

(Tell you a story, it goes a little somethin' like this)

Little bitty pretty one,
C'mon, talk to me
Girl, you are a lovely one,
Sit down on my knee

(C'mon everybody, let's put our hands together and sing along)

C'mon
C'mon
I said c'mon
I said c'mon

I'll tell you a story,
It happened long time ago,
Little bitty pretty one,
I been watching you grow

I'll tell you a story,
It happened long time ago,
Little bitty pretty one,
I been watching you grow

(Tell you a story, it goes a little somethin' like this)
