[Aaron:] Well, I guess the best way for me to begin is
The Other day I was hanging with some friends
Going around the room talking about our favorite noise
I said I had a brother in the Backstreet Boys
So everyone screamed

[Group of Kids:] Hey is this some kinda trick

[Dopey Guy:] Yea, which one is he?

[Aaron:] The Blonde One, Nick
Then the cutest girl said:

[Girl:] I have to see their show
But I have no ticket, Aaron
How can I go

[Aaron:] Your wish is my command
See it's no problem, hon
In fact I'll get some tickets here for everyone
All I gotta is pick up the celly
And its a done deal
Let me call Nick and tell him

[Other Guy:] By the way Aaron, if you could, while you're at it
Can you hook up some seats
For my friends and my parents?

[Aaron:] So I said to myself, well heck, why not?
There's nothing that can beat the connection I got

[Chorus (girls):] Aaron, Oh Aaron
What are you going to do?
You make empty promises oh so big
([Aaron:] man)
How gonna make them come true?
([Aaron:] I don't know)
Aaron, Oh Aaron,
What are we going to do with you?
Always a makin' a bigger mistake
Always a-makin' a fool
([Aaron:] Yo, I gotta make a phone call)

[Ring]

[Nick:] Hello?

[Aaron:] Hey Nick
I need a favor from you, dude
I promised people tickets
So you gotta come through

[Nick:] Sure, bro...how many do you need?

[Aaron:] 1...2...uh, 3003

[Nick:] WHAT?!
I can get you maybe a dozen
You can't promise seats to everyone and their cousin
What did you do? 
How'd you get in this mess?

[Aaron:] I was talkin to this girl...

[Nick:] Hold your breath
I know the rest
Guess you better get yourself a whole lotta money

[Aaron:] For 3000 tickets?
Nick, that's isn't funny.
How'm I supposed to pull that off in so little time?

[Nick:] You got me, Aaron
That's your problem...not mine

[Chorus (girls):] Aaron, Oh Aaron
([Aaron:] What do I do?)
What are you going to do?
You make empty promises oh so big
([Aaron:] What?)
How gonna make them come true?
Aaron, Oh Aaron, 
([Aaron (annoyed):] What?)
What are we going to do with you?
([Aaron:] I don't know)
Always a makin' a bigger mistake 
([Aaron:] So, it was just one mistake)
Always a-makin' a fool
([Aaron:] Whatever)

[Aaron:] How in the world can he do that to me?
I thought we were blood.
I thought we were family.
We're gettin' to the show
We'll get good seats
Everyone on the bus, you're all coming with me
I'm tellin' you guys when we get to the gate
He can never say "no" when he looks at my face
Hook me up! Nick, Man, I swear I'll pay you back

[Nick:] Well come to think about, we need an opening act.

[Aaron:] What do you want me to do: tell jokes; dance; act?

[Nick:] Nah, I want you on stage, I want you to rap. 
'Cause if you don't you're gonna have some disappointed friends
And by the way you're on at eight, that's when the show begins

[Chorus (girls):] Aaron. Oh, Aaron, what are you going to do?
([Aaron:] Man)
You make big promises oh so big
How you gonna make it come true?
([Aaron:] One promise man)
Aaron. Oh, Aaron,
What are we going to do with you?
([Aaron:] I'm desperate)
Always a-makin' a bigger mistake
([Aaron:] I'm desperate, Man [squeak])
Always a-makin' a fool

[Repeat until fade]
