I'm dancing every day,
Never reach solemnity,
I don't complain about the life I live
And I appreciate the loving that you're showing me
I'mma leave - what you can is what you get

Every time they want to bring the heat,
I flash a smile at the paparazzi
All my life I always dreamt of this
So, you know, I'm embracing it

Everybody wants a piece of me,
To get a glimpse of the life I lead,
If they wanna see if I'm down,
There's enough of me, to go around.

Might see me as a superstar,
I don't even drive a fancy car,
Keeping both feet on the ground,
There's enough of me, to go around.

I never hesitate,
If you want my autograph
I go and sign my name across your heart
So call me royalty, the only thing I do is lie
Blank description, oh I'll play the part

Every time they want to bring the heat,
I flash a smile at the paparazzi
All my life I always dreamt of this
So, you know, I'm embracing it

Everybody wants a piece of me,
To get a glimpse of the life I lead,
If they wanna see if I'm down,
There's enough of me, to go around.

Might see me as a superstar,
I don't even drive a fancy car,
Keeping both feet on the ground,
There's enough of me, to go around.

I got more than enough to give
What's the use in holding back?
I've only got one life to live
I'm gonna make the best of all I have
Share myself in every way that I can

Everybody wants a piece of me,
To get a glimpse of the life I lead,
If they wanna see if I'm down,
There's enough of me, to go around.

Might see me as a superstar,
I don't even drive a fancy car,
Keeping both feet on the ground,
There's enough of me, to go around.

Everybody wants a piece of me,
To get a glimpse of the life I lead,
If they wanna see if I'm down,
There's enough of me, to go around.

Might see me as a superstar,
I don't even drive a fancy car,
Keeping both feet on the ground,
There's enough of me, to go around.
There's enough of me, to go around.
There's enough of me, to go around.
