Give me half the chance
I’ll make you understand
That what I got to give
Is so much more than this 
Than you'll ever know

I don’t say what’s on my mind
But you’ll find this out in time
Don’t always open up
I’m not quick to trust
And let someone inside

I’ve got a lot to learn
Never felt this way before
But I gotta say what’s right for me

You should know that I can 
Be more than you will ever need
I’ll show you something new to see, yeah
I’ll be the one you can believe
I’ll be one better, Yeah
I’ll be one better

You’ve seen some falling stars
You felt a broken heart
Time is all it takes 
Learn from my mistakes
Know exactly what you are
But I can’t hang on the side
I’ve had enough of all these fights
Gotta give to you
Gotta get this through

Till you realize
I’ve got a lot to learn
Never felt this way before
But I gotta say what’s right for me

You should know that I can
Be more than you will ever need
I’ll show you something new to see (yeah)
I’ll be the one you can believe
I’ll be one better, Yeah

I wont back down (No never, No never)
You don’t have to be alone 
Girl, Alone (Oooh, Ooh) No (Oh)

You should know that I can
Be more than you will ever need
I’ll show you something new to see
I'll be the one you can believe
I’ll be one better (Oh)
(I’ll be)
I’ll be one better (Oh)
(I’ll will)
I’ll be one better (Oh)
