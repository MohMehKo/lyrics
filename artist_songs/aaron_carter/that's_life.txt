I come from a bottom of hate but I made it
I’ve been dead broke and I’ve been famous, yeah
I’m not afraid to get dirty
I’ve seen concrete grown roses

But you know it’s not an easy life
Yeah we all get a second try
And it don’t matter what you have
Or the cars you drive
It’s gonna be a crazy ride

You know the storm can last long
But after every cloud there’s a rainbow
Just leave your troubles in the past
Get you back on track you know

Let’s be blind to all the colours
‘cause we’re all sisters and brothers
We are, we’re all superstars
Together

Oh oh
Through all the hate and love we bounce back again
Oh oh
It’s alright
Yeah that’s life

Yeah my 99 problems ain’t gon’ stop me
I got air to breathe and my heartbeat and you can
Try to hold me down
I know exactly who I’m gonna be

[?] where life can [?]
But that don’t mean that no one loves ya
You know you gotta keep your head up
Yeah you gotta keep your head up

You know the storm can last long
But after every cloud there’s a rainbow
Just leave your troubles in the past
Get you back on track you know

Let’s be blind to all the colours
‘cause we’re all sisters and brothers
We are, we’re all superstars
Together

Oh oh
Through all the hate and love we bounce back again
Oh oh
It’s alright
Yeah that’s life

Let’s be blind to all the colours
‘cause we’re all sisters and brothers
We are, we’re all superstars
Together

Oh oh
Through all the hate and love we bounce back again
Oh oh
It’s alright
Yeah that’s life
