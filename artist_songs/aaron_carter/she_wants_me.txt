[NICK:]
Attention Ladies and Gentlemen... 
School's in! 

[AARON:]
Man, shut up 

[NICK:]
Time to teach you a little somethin' bro 

[AARON:]
Haha! Ya right! 

[NICK:]
What? What's this you say? 

[AARON:]
Just back off dawg. She wants me 

[NICK:]
Are You talkin' junk? 

[AARON:]
Haha! Dude you can't have her...C'mon 

[NICK:]
Check it out 
Saw you when you were trying to kick it to her 
Got a little kiss and you were 
Tellin everybody that she was into you 
Don't tell me you think you got her 
It's all become a little hotter 
She's been going with me, I guess you never knew 
Don't get hung up about it 
It's not you that she needs...
No... 

[Chorus:]
I'm the one, she told me so 
I don't want to be the one to tell you 
It's not you she wants to see, it's me 
So give it up, turn her loose 
You knew you were never meant to be 
You're too blind to see 
You gotta let it be, she wants me, me 
She wants me, me 

[AARON:]
Alright, I'm gonna break it down 
She's got you kind of mixed up and twisted 
You had a good shot and missed it 
Sorry bro, I guess you're getting too confused 
She told me I'm the one she runs to 
Whenever she wants some fun, dude.
You better get your facts straight 
I'm telling you the truth 
You're too hung up about it 
And you don't really know what she needs
Oh!

[Chorus:]

[NICK:]
Hahaha. Yeah right 

[AARON:]
Yo, she wants me... 

[NICK:]
Heh, Whatever, yo 
She wants me... 

[AARON:]
No way 
I'm gonna tell ya somethin, yo 
She wants me.... 

[Chorus:]

I'm the one she told me so 
I don't want to be the one to tell you 
It's not you she wants to see, it's me 
So give it up, turn her loose 
You knew you were never meant to be 
You're too blind to see 
You gotta let it be, she wants me, me 
She wants me , me
Give it up, she wants me, me 
Ooh yeah, she wants me, me 
She wants me ....
