[Touche]
Oh if someone writes a song with a simple Rhyme 
[`N Sync]
Just a song where is feeling show 
[The Moffats]
And if someone feels the same about the simple song 
[Gil]
oh sometimes you can hear them sing 
[Sqeezer]
music gives you Happiness and Sadness
[Nick-BSB]
But it also, also heals your soul 

[Chorus]
Let the music heal your soul
let the music take control
let the music give you the power to
move any mountain 

[Touche]
If someone plays piano with some simple chords 
[Aaron]
So melodic and endearing, too 
[Brian-BSB]
Oh if someone plays guitar with the old piano 
[The Boyz]
And maybe you can hear them sing 
[Nick-BSB]
Music gives you Happiness and Sadness 
[`N Sync]
But it also 
[Blumchen] it also heals your soul 

[Chorus]

[Brian-BSB]
Let the music heal your soul
let the music take control
let the music heal your soul 

[Chorus x 4]
