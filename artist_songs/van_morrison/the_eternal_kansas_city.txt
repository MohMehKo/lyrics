Excuse me do you know the way to Kansas City?
Excuse me do you know the way to Kansas City?
Excuse me do you know the way to Kansas City?
Excuse me do you know the way to Kansas City?

Train down to St. Louis in Missouri
Pass over to the city you know that one
Where the farmer's daughter digs the farmer's son
Dig your Charlie Parker
Basie and Young
Witherspoon and Jay McShann
They will come

Excuse me do you know the way to Kansas City?
Excuse me do you know the way to Kansas City?
Excuse me do you know the way to Kansas City?
Excuse me do you know the way to Kansas City?

Lady Liberty in waiting
You know she lights the way
Her name is Billie, she's a Holiday
And the city is eternal, can't you see?
It's inside of you and it's inside of me

Lady Liberty in waiting
You know she lights the way
Her name is Billie, she's a Holiday
And the city is eternal, can't you see?
It's inside of you and it's inside of me

You know the way to Kansas City
[repeat]
