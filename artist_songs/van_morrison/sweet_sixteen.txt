Well, well, I loved you
Like I never loved before
First time I saw you
Standing home at your front door
Do you remember
You created quite a scene
When you were walking
Down by the village green

[Chorus:]
When you were only
When you were only
When you were only
When you were only
Sweet sixteen
Baby, how I loved you
Sweet sixteen
How I really loved you
Sweet sixteen
Baby, how I loved you
Sweet sixteen
How I really loved you
Sweet sixteen

Standing on the corner
And you came walking by
And when I saw you
I said "My, my, my, my"
Do you remember
How I took you by the hand?
Do you remember
In the sunny summerland?

[Chorus]

And your eyes shine like diamonds
And they sparkle in the night
And the kind of love that you give me
Seems to light up all my life

And then, and then, and then I told you
That we'd never ever part
And then, and then, and then I'd hold you
A little closer to my heart
Do you remember
All the stars were shining bright?
Do you remember
It was on a magic night?

[Chorus and fade]
