When I hear that robin sing
Well I know it's coming on spring
Ooo-we and we're starting a new life

I've been shovelling the snow away
Working hard for my pay
All I gotta say is we're starting a new life

We're gonna move
Way on down the line
Girl, we been standing in one place for too long a time
When I hear that robin song
Well, I know it won't be long
Frank, I know we belong
And we're starting a new life

We gonna move, move way on down the line
Girl, we been standing in one place for too long a time
When I hear that robin song
Well, I know it won't be long
Frank, I know we belong
And we're starting a new life
