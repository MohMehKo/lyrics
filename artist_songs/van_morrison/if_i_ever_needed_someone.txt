Lord, if I ever needed someone
I need You
Lord, if I ever needed someone
I need You

To see me through the daytime
And through the long, lonely night
Lead me through the darkness
And on into the light

To stand with me when I'm in trouble
And help me through my strife
When times get so uncertain, I turn to
Turn to You, in my life

Lord, if I ever needed someone
I need You
Lord, if I ever needed someone
I need You

Someone to hold onto
(Someone to hold onto)
Keep me from all fear
(Keep me from all fear)
Someone to be my guiding light
(Someone to be my guiding light)
And hold me ever dear

Keep me from my selfishness
Keep me from my sorrow
Lead me on to givingness
I can see a new tomorrow
(I can see a new tomorrow)

Lord, if I ever needed someone
I need You
Lord, if I ever needed someone
I need You

Someone to walk with
(Someone to walk with)
Someone to hold by the hand
(Someone to hold my hand)
Someone to talk with
(Someone to talk with)
Someone to understand
(Someone to understand)

Yeah (whoa)
Yeah (yeah)

To call on when I need You
(When I need You)
And I need You very much
(And I need You very much)
Open up my arms to You
(Open up my arms to You)
And feel your tender touch
(And feel your tender touch)

Feel it and to keep it
Right here in my soul
(Right here in my soul)
Care for it and keep it with me
Never to grow old
(Never, never, never grow old)

Lord, if I ever needed someone
I need You
Lord, if I ever needed someone
I need You

Lord, if I ever needed someone
(I need you in the midnight hour, need you in a new day, need you in the morning)
I need You
Lord, if I ever needed someone
(Lord, I... Lord, I... Lord, I need you)
I need You

Lord, if I ever needed someone
I need You (You, You)
