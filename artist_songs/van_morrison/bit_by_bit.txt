Hey, Where Are You

And the raincoat shone into the sun
as we walked down the street as one
into the [all pleasant ?] bloom
of a Saturday afternoon.
And we strolled the walls and kicked our heels
upon the grass on which we fell and sang a song
we loved to sing so well,
and the raindrops came on down on Sally's head
as she cuddled up inside a coat of red and said,
"Hey, where are you?
Where you goin' to? yeah, yeah
Oh, why can't I come too?
'stead of leavin' me here
oh so lonely, lonely, lonely, wait on me.
Wait on me.
Wait on me."

And into the trees and forest we did roam,
the way we danced into the sparkling foam shining our light into the days of blooming wonder,
and the gray man at the bus station raised his head into the sky and said, "Have you got your ticket?" I said, "I got it, how?
But I got it." "Pass on through the swingin' barrier now."
And the raindrops came on down on Sally's head
and she cuddled up inside a coat of red and said,
"Hey, where are you?
Where you goin' to?
Why can't I come too?
instead of leavin' me here
oh so lonely,
oh so lonely, lonely,
lonely, just wait on me.
Wait on me, babe.
I can't keep up, I can't keep up, I can't keep up.
Hey fellas,
a-wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute,
I can't keep up.
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
you gotta stop,
wait on me.
Wait on me.
I can't keep up, I can't keep up, I can't keep up, you gotta
wait on me, wait on me, wait on me, wait on me, wait on me, yeah, yeah.
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
hey, hey, hey, yeah,
hold on,
you gotta stop.
I can't keep up, can't keep up, I can't keep up, you gotta,
hey, yeah,
hold on, hold on,
wait on me.
Wait on me.
Wait on me, wait on me, wait on me, wait on me, wait on me, wait on me, wait on me, wait on me, yeah, yeah, alright.
Baby, baby.

Don't go,
please don't go.
Please don't go.
