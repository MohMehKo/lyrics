Oh won't you stay
Stay a while with your own ones
Don't ever stray
Stray so far from your own ones
'Cause the world is so cold
Don't care nothing for your soul
You share with your own ones

Don't rush away
Rush away from your own ones
One more day
One more day with your own ones
'Cause the world is so cold
Don't care nothing for your soul
You share with your own ones

There's a stranger
And he's standing by your door
Might be your best friend, might be your brother
You may never know

I'm going back
Going back to my own ones
Back to talk
Talk a while with my own ones
'Cause the world is so cold
Don't care nothing for your soul
You share with your own ones

There's a stranger
And he's standing by your door
Might be your best friend, might be your brother
You may never know

I'm going back
Going back to my own ones
Back to talk
Talk a while with my own ones
Oh the world is so cold
Don't care nothing for your soul
You share with your own one
