You, you've loved and lost someone else
I can tell by the way that you carry yourself
Baby, if you'll let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you

I've loved, I've loved and lost
Just the same as you
So I know exactly what
You've been going through

If you'll let me
Here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you

You may never, never, never have to worry no more
You may never have to cry
I'll be standing beside you
Dryin' your weeping eyes

So darlin', won't you say, won't you say
Won't you say, won't you say, won't you say, baby
That you'll be true?
You know, I've no doubt in my mind
Just exactly what I'm gonna do

And if you'll let me
Here's what I'll do, here's what I'll do
I'll have to take care of you

You may never, never, never have to worry no more
Say, say, baby, may have to cry sometimes
I'll be standing beside you
Dryin' your weeping eyes

So won't you tell me, tell me, right now
Say that you'll be true
There's no doubt in my mind
Just exactly what I'm gonna do

And if you let me baby, if you let me
My, my, my, I'll take care of you
Just what I'll have to do

I'm driftin', I'm driftin'
Like a ship I'm on the sea
Driftin', I'm driftin'
Like a ship I'm on the sea

Driftin', I'm driftin'
Just like a ship, a ship, I'm on the sea
