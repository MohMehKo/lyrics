Don't talk to me 'bout life problems or
How you wish that things could be
'Cause I don't have no trouble livin'
It's jus' dyin that bothers me

Don't offer me no sad stories or
Tell me that you're all at sea
'Cause I don't have no trouble livin'
It's jus' dyin that bothers me

You doin' great
You gettin' straight
You get your call
That's all

So don't tell me your misgivings
Or not to be or not to be
'Cause I don't have no trouble livin'
It's jus' dyin that bothers me

You doin' fine
You sippin' wine
You feel a pain
Last train

So don't tell me your misgivings
Or blame it on the referree
'Cause I don't have no trouble livin'
It's jus' dyin that bothers me
