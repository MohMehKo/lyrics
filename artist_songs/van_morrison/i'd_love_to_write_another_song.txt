I'd love to write another song
But nothing seems to come
I'd love to write another song
To carry me along
Make some money, pay the bills
Keep me busy too
I'd love to write another love song

I'd love to write another song
I'm searching everywhere
Though I look for inspiration sometimes
It's just not there
I have to work, I have to play
I have to get in step
If I could write another love song
I know it sure would help

I'd love to write another song
Baby especially for you
I'd love to write another song
And feel things bright and new
In poetry I'd carve it well
I'd even make it rhyme
I'd love to write another song
Just to get some peace of mind

I'd love to write another song
To get some peace of mind

I'd love to write another song
Baby for some peace of mind.
