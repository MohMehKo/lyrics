Got to get myself together, gotta get my head some peace

Gotta get my head together, gotta get my head some peace

Playing in the background in the restaurant, some kind of phony pseudo jazz
I don't care I'm trying to get away from people, that are trying to drive me mad

After everything I've worked for, not goin' to throw everything away
After everything I worked so hard for, I'm not goin' to give it all away
I just need to take a raincheck, I can't live to fight another day

Goin' down to Monte Carlo, 25k from nice
Goin' down, goin' down to Monte Carlo, still about 25k from nice
Got to get my head showered, got to find some release
