You see me on the street, well you guess I'm doing fine
Oh but it's hassle, hassle baby, almost all the time
I've got to get away, get away by myself
Oh the way it's going now, can't you see I need some help?
`Cause I'm just a man, doing the best I can
Don't you understand, I just want some peace of mind

You see me on the stage, on stage doing my job
I learn to do it well, keep on singing, singing the song
But it gets so lonely sometime, lonely out there
When you're on the road again, but you're going nowhere
Because I'm just a man, just a man
I ain't got no masterplan, got no masterplan
Don't you understand, I'm just tryna, tryna find some peace of mind

I have to stand in line, baby when I'm in a queue
I got to do the [?] things in life, just the same as you
Got my doubts about it, oh but I try
To make it work, make it work, make it work with tears in my eyes
Because I'm just a man, just a man
Tryna do the best I can, do the best I can
I want you to understand, understand
You got to get me some peace of mind

Oh I'm just a man, baby, I ain't got no masterplan
I wanna you to try to understand, you got to give me some peace of mind
Got to give, got to give, got to give some, got to give some peace of mind
Got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to give some peace of mind
Got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to get, got to, got to get, got to, got to get, got to, got to get some peace of mind
Got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to get some, get some peace of mind
