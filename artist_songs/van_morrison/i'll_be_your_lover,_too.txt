I'll be your man
I'll understand
Do my best to take good care a you
Yes I will

You'll be my queen
I'll be your king
And I'll be your lover, too
Yes, I will

Derry down green
Color of my dream
A dream that's daily coming true

I'll tell ya
When day is through
I will come to you
And tell you of your many charms

And you'll look at me
With eyes that see
And melt into each other's arms

And so I come
To be the one
Who's always standing next to you

Umm, reach out for me
So I can be alright
The one who's always reaching out for you
Yes I will, yes I will

You'll be my queen
I'll be your king
And I'll be your lover, too.
