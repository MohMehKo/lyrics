Well, I wake up
and I'm slowly
a-comin' down.
I'm just tryin'
to get my feet back
on the ground.
I got more
of an idea
just exactly
what I'm worth.
Baby, baby, I wake up
and I'm comin'
down to earth.
Yeah, baby, baby, I wake up
and I'm comin'
down to earth.
Was I
ever wrong
about so much?
That's all you get,
get completely
out of touch.
And it's a very, very, very, very painful thing
when you witness your
death and your birth.
Baby, baby, baby, I wake up,
I wake up
and I'm comin'
down to earth.
Yeah,
baby, baby, baby, I wake up
and I'm comin'
down to earth,
yeah.

Back here,
back here
on the planet,
a-been a long, long, long fall,
but that's
always just a problem
when you think you know it all.
And it's a very, very, very, very, very painful thing
when you witness your own
death and your birth.
Baby, baby, I wake up, I wake up
and I'm comin'
down to earth.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I wake up
and I'm comin'
down to earth.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah, I wake up
and I'm comin',
babe, I wake up, I wake up.
Ow!, woke up this mornin',
I walked out, walked out the door,
got in my car and I drove
down the road,
down the road.
I woke up,
I woke up,
and I woke up,
yeah, yeah, yeah I,
babe, I wake up,
I wake up,
I wake up.
