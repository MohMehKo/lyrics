Open your arms in the early mornin'
When the light comes shinin' through
Can't you hear my heart beat just for you?
It's beating so wild, honey
And the light comes shinin' through

Singin' my song
And the band is playin'
And the music is tried, tried and true
Can't you hear my heart beat just for you?
It's beating so wild, so wild, honey
And the light comes shinin' through

I'll be waiting for you
I'll be waiting there for thee
Way up on the mountain side
Where the hillside rolls down to the sea
Tell me what's real?
(Won't you tell me?)
What you feel inside?
(What do you really feel?)
Any time of day or night will do
(Any time of day or night, you can call me any time)
Can't you hear my heart beat just for you?
(Can't you hear my heart beat?)
It's beating so wild, honey
(So, so wild, so wild)
And your light comes shining through
(Shine on, shine on, shine through, shine on)

I'll be waiting for you
(Yes I'll be waiting for you)
I'll be waiting there for thee
(I'll be waiting there, for as long as I see it takes, yes I'm waiting)
Way up on the mountain side
(Way up on the mountain side)
Where the hillside rolls down to the sea
(Where the hillside rolls, rolls down to the sea)
Tell me what's real?
(Tell me)
What I feel inside?
(Any time)
Any time of day or night will do
(Any time of day or night, baby)
Can't you hear my heart beat just for you?
(Just for you)
Yeah so wild, honey
(So wild, so wild)
And the light... [repeat]
(And the light...)
Comes shining through
