I'm real real gone
I got hit by a bow and arrow
Got me down to the very marrow
You're a friend of mine
And I'm real real gone

I'm real real gone
I can't stand up by myself
Don't you know I need your help, baby
And I'm real real gone

Some people say
You can make it on your own
You can make it if you try
I know better man
You can't stand up alone
Oh baby, baby that is why

I'm real real gone
I can't stand up all by myself
Don't you know I need your help
You're a friend of mine
And I'm real real gone

And Sam Cooke is on the radio
And all the nighttime is filled with space
And your little fingertips touch my face
You're a friend of mine
And I'm real real real real real gone

I'm real gone
I got hit by a bow and arrow
(I got hit by a bow and arrow)
Got me down to the very marrow
You're a friend of mine
And I'm real real gone
Real gone, real gone
I'm real real gone

And I'm real real gone
