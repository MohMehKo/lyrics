There I go, there I go
There I go, there I go, there I go
Pretty baby, you are the soul
That snaps my control

Such a funny thing
But every time I'm near you
I never can behave
You give me a smile
And then I'm wrapped up in your magic

The music all around me
Crazy music, music that keeps calling me
So very close to you
And it turns me your slave

Come and do with me
Anything you want to
Anything baby
Just let me get next to you

Am I insane?
Or do I really see heaven in your eyes?
Bright as stars that shine up above me
In the clear blue skies

How I worry about you
Just can't live my life without you
Baby, come here, don't have no fear

Why not sit there?
Wonder why I'm really feeling in the mood for love
Darling, why stop to talk about this weather, my dear?
Each little dream might fade away

There I go talking out of my head again
Oh, baby won't you come
And put our two hearts together
Oh, that would make me strong and brave

Oh, when we are one
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
If there's a cloud up above us
Come on and let in rain

I'm sure our love together
Can endure a hurricane
Oh my baby, let me love you
And get me release from this awful misery I feel

What is all this talk about loving me, my sweet
I am not afraid, not anymore, not like before
Can't you understand me?

Now baby, please pull yourself together
Do it soon, my soul's on fire
Come on and take me
I'll be what you make me, my darling, my sweet

My baby, you make me feel so good
Let me take you by the hand
Come, let us visit up there
In that new promised land

Maybe there we can find
A new way to find some love and peace of mind

You can blow now if you want to, we're through
