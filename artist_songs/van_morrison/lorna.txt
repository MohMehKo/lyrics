See you smile
angel child,
that's all I ever wanted to do.
See your laugh
in a photograph,
that's all I ever wanted to do.
See your swishin' walk,
and talk your baby talk,
that's all I ever wanted to do.
Lorna,
Lorna,
that's all I ever wanted to do.
Carry you,
carry you down by the banks of the river,
all along down,
all along down the grasses' [throne ?].
Carry you, carry you,
by the banks of the river,
that's all,
that's all I wanted to do.
I'll carry all your books to school,
and maybe be your fool,
that's all I wanted to do.
Ah, just to hold your hand
all along the golden sand,
that's all I wanted to do.
Lorna,
Lorna,
that's all I ever wanted to do.
