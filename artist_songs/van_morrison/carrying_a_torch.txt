I'm carryin' a torch for you
I'm carryin' a torch
You don't know just how much it costs
For to keep carryin' a torch

Flame of love it burns so bright
That is my desire
Keep on liftin' me, liftin' me up
Higher and higher

You're the keeper of the flame
And it burn so bright
Baby why don't we re-connect
Move into the light

I've been going to and fro on this
And I'm still carryin' a torch
You must know how much it's worth
When I'm carryin' a torch (alright)

Baby you're the keeper of the flame
And you burn so bright (you know, I'm burn so bright)
Why, why, why, why don't we re-connect
Move on further, into the light (sing it)

I've been calling you on the phone
`Cause I'm carryin' a torch
I can do it all on my own
`Cause I'm carryin' a torch

I'm carryin' a torch for you
I'm carryin' a torch (I'm carryin', I'm carryin', I'm carryin')
You don't know how much it's worth
To keep, keep carryin' a torch

I'm carryin' a torch for you, baby
I'm carryin' a torch
You know, really know how much it costs
For to keep carryin' a torch

Carryin', carryin', carryin'... a torch
