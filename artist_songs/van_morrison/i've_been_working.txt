I've been workin'
I've been workin' so hard

I've been workin'
I've been workin' so hard

I come home
I'll make-a love to you
I'll make-a love to you

I've been grindin'
I've been grindin' so long

I've been grindin'
I've been grindin' so long

Been up the thruway, down the thruway
Up the thruway, down the thruway
Up, down, back and up again

And I said
Woman, woman, woman, woman
Woman, woman, woman, woman
Make me feel so good

Woman, woman, woman, woman
Woman, woman, woman, woman
Make me feel alright

You're alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright

You're alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright

Mmm-mm-mm-mmm

[Instrumental & sax solo]

And I said
Woman, woman, woman, woman
Woman, woman, woman, woman
Make me feel so good

Woman, woman, woman, woman
Woman, woman, woman, woman
Make me feel alright

You're alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright

You're alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright

Make me feel so good

Set my soul on fire

Set my soul on fire

Ooo-wee

[Fades]
Mmm-hmm-mm.
