Baby, look down, look down that lonesome road
And before you travel, travel on
Look up, look up and see your maker
Before Gabriel blows his horn

Life gets weary when you're carrying such a heavy load
Traveling down that lonesome road
Baby, look down, look down, oh, that lonesome road
Before you travel on, travel on

Life gets weary when you're carrying such a load
Traveling down that lonesome road
True love, true love what have I done?
For you to treat me, you to treat me so

Way you make me walk and you make me talk
Like I never, never, never, never done before

True love, true love what have I done?
For you to treat me, you to treat me so
You make me walk and you make me talk
Like I never, never, never, never done before

Never done before
Like I never, never done before
Like I never done before
