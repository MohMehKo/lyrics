Call of the wildest, it's got the best of you
Fire in my heart, fire in my belly too
Got a heart and a mind and a fire inside
And I'm crazy about you
You, you on your high flying cloud
You, you when you're laughing out loud
You, you with your hidden surprise
You

Stoke up my engine, bring me my driving wheel
Once we get started, don't know just how I feel
Cause I'm crazy about you
Cause I'm crazy about you
Cause I'm crazy about you
You, you on your high flying cloud
You, you when you're laughing out loud
You, you with the stars in your eyes
You

Gotta get through January
Gotta get through February
Gotta get through January
Gotta get through February
Gotta get through January
Gotta get through February
Gotta get through January

Waking my heart, fire in my belly too
I come apart baby, I don't know just what to do
Cause I'm crazy about you
Cause I'm crazy about you
Cause I'm crazy about you
You, you on your high flying cloud
You, you when you're laughing out loud
You, you with the stars in your eyes
You, talkin' 'bout you 

Gotta get through January
I gotta get through February
I gotta get through January
I gotta get through February
I gotta get through January
I gotta get through February

Waking my heart, fire in my belly too
I come apart baby, I don't know just what to do
Cause I'm crazy about you
Cause I'm crazy about you
Cause I'm crazy about you
You, you on your high flying cloud
You, you when you're laughing out loud
You, you with the stars in your eyes
Talkin' 'bout you 
Talkin' 'bout you [repeat]
