And as we walked
Through the streets of Arklow
And the color of the day wore on
And our heads were filled with poetry
And the morning
A-comin' on to dawn

And as we walked
Through the streets of Arklow
And our perfusion
In a green green land
And the gypsy's rode
With their hearts on fire
Say "We love to wander,"
"Lord we love to roam..."

And as we walked
Through the streets of Arklow
In a drenching beauty
Rolling back 'til the day
I saw your eyes
Shining, sparkling clear
And our soul was clean
And the grass did grow

And as we walked
Through the streets of Arklow
In that old, old green land
Where the gypsy's rode
Bound to the sea
With their hearts on fire
And our souls were clean
And the grass did grow
And our souls were clean
And the grass did grow
And our souls were clean
And the grass did grow
