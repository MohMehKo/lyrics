My pagan heart
My pagan soul
Got to move on to the crossroads
Got to go to the Arcadian groves
Got to move to the crossroads
Down by the crossroads, crossroads

My pagan heart
My pagan soul
Got to go to the holy wood
When the sun is good, to the holy wood
You take it in, it's under your skin
It tastes like wine
In the evening time

Down by the crossroads
Down by the crossroads
My pagan heart
My pagan soul
Down, down, down, by
The Arcadian groves
Down down down down
By Arcadian groves

By the roads
By the roads
My pagan heart
My pagan soul
My pagan soul
I got to go down by the crossroads
The moon is rising
In the evening time
By the crossroads
Crossroads
My pagan heart
My pagan soul

Down down down down
Down by the Arcadian grove
Down down down down
Down by the Arcadian grove
Got to go down by the crossroads
Crossroads
My pagan heart
My pagan soul
My pagan heart
My pagan soul
Got to go down by the crossroads
Crossroads
Pagan heart
My pagan soul
Got to go down
To the crossroads

I look at the sun
I take it in
It's under my skin
Pagan heart
Pagan soul
Down by the crossroads
Down by the crossroads
Down by the crossroads
Pagan heart
Pagan soul
I've got to know
I got to know
Pagan heart
Pagan soul
By the crossroads

Put a spell on you
Down by the crossroads
Put a spell on you
Down by the crossroads
My pagan heart
My pagan soul
Pagan heart
Pagan soul
Put a spell on you
Down by the crossroads
When the moon was new
When the moon was new
Put a spell on you
Down by the crossroads
