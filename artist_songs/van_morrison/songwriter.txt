I'm a songwriter and I know just where I stand
I'm a songwriter, pen and paper in my hand
Get the words on the page
Please don't call me a sage,
I'm a songwriter

I'm a songwriter and I do it for a living
I'm a songwriter and I write about men and women
I can write about love and the stars up above
I'm a songwriter

I'm a songwriter and I'm hot on your trail
I'm a songwriter and my cheque's in the mail
I can move with the scene, I can make up a dream
I'm a songwriter

Na na na nana, na na na nana

I'm a songwriter I can do it for certain
I'm a songwriter even do it when I'm hurtin'
And if it comes to the bit, have to write another hit
I'm a songwriter

I'm a songwriter I can put it in words
I'm a songwriter and it's not for the birds
I can spin you a yarn, it's as long as my arm
I'm a songwriter

Na na na nana, na na na nana
I'm a songwriter
Na na na nana, na na na nana
I'm a songwriter
