Always screaming cause I'm suffering so
Life's done never such a terrible blow
The bag I'm in is just a sack o'woe
Misery company and I'm feeling low
Trouble follows me wherever I go
The bag I'm in is just a sack o'woe

Trouble one thing I understand
Seems to be a part of me
Misery and me go hand in hand
Never ever let me be
Sure as I'm born one thing I know
The bag I'm in is just a sack o'woe

[Repeat first and second verse]
