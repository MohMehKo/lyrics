Well I'm higher than the world
And I'm livin' in my dreams
Make it better than it seems
Today

And I'm higher than a clouds
And I'm wrapped up in the sound
Make it better all around
Today

Higher than the world
Yeah higher than this world
I wanna give a life a whirl
Today

Higher in my mind
I'm gonna leave my blues behind
Let's hold on, let's hold on to what I find
Today

Higher than the world
Yeah my head is in a swirl
Gotta give a life a whirl
Today

Higher in my mind
Gonna leave my blues behind
Let's hold on, let's hold on to what I find
Today

Cause I'm higher than the world
And I'm wrapped up in my dreams
Make it better than it seems
Today
