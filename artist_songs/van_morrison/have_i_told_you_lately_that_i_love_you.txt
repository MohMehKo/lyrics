[Van sings:]
Have I told you lately that I love you
Have I told you there's no one above you, above you
Fill my heart with gladness
Take away my sadness
Ease my troubles, that's what you do

You-you-you-you-you-you-you-you

[Sinead sings:]
Oh, the morning sun and all it's glory
Greets the day with hope and comfort, too
And you fill my life with laughter
You can make it better

[Both:]
Ease my troubles that's what you do

[Sings together: (Van 1st line)]
There's a love divine
There's a love that's divine

It's yours and mine
And it's yours and it's mine

Shines like the sun
It shines like the sun

[Van:]
Babadabadop, babadabadop, babadabadop, babadabadop
babadabadop, babadabadop, babadabadop

[Both:]
At the end of the day
We shall give thanks and pray
To the One (ah) and say

[Sings together: (Sinead 1st line)]
Have I told you lately that I love you
you lately that I love you

Have I told you there's no one above you
there's no one above you

[Both:]
Fill my heart with gladness
Take away my sadness

Ease my troubles that's what you do
Ease my troubles that's what you do

There's a love that's divine
(There's a love that's divine)

And it's yours and it's mine
It's yours and it's mine

Shines like the sun
Shines like the sun

[Van:]
Blah-blah
Blah-blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah-blah

[Sinead:]
At the end of the day

[Both:]
We shall give thanks and pray
To the one and say
Have I told you lately that I love you
Have I told you there's no one above you
Fill my heart with gladness
Take away all my sadness
Ease my troubles that's what you do
Fill my heart with gladness
Take away all my sadness

[Sinead:]
Ease my troubles thats (woops!)
[Van:]
That's what
[Sinead:]
You do
[Van:]
You-you-you-you-you-you-you-you
