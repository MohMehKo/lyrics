in-a my arms
and just listen to the night.
You must know that you have
certain charms,
and I feel,
and I feel the time is right.
Spare me a little,
spare me a little,
spare me a little of your love.
Spare me a little,
spare me a little,
spare me a little of your love.
And I know that I
feel much more
in-a
every single way,
[ended / and it's ?] not the same
as before, it gets
stronger [stronger],
stronger every day.
Spare me a little,
spare me a little,
spare me a little of your love.
Spare me a little,
spare me a little,
spare me a little of your love.

Now I know how the
sun must feel
every time it shines,
and I know that
this is real and I
want you to be mine.
So, spare me a little,
spare me a little,
spare me a little of your love.
Spare me a little,
spare me a little,
spare me a little of your love.
Come on, spare me a little,
spare me a little,
spare me a little of your love.
One more time,
spare me a little,
spare me a little,
spare me a little of your love.
