Well, I had a woman
Livin' way back o' town
Well, she treated me right
Never let me down
But I wasn't satisfied
I had to run around

Now she's gone and left me
I'm worried as can be
Oh, I've searched this world over
Wonderin' where could she be?
I would ask that she forgive me
Maybe she'll come back to me

Now, I'm lonesome and blue
Whoa, but I've learned a thing or two
Ooh, fellas here's a tip
I'm going to pass on down to you
Never mistreat your woman
'Cause it's gonna bounce right back on you.

[Instrumental and horn solo to end]
