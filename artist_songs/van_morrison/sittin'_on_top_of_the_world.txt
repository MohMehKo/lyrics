You come here runnin'
Holdin' out your hand
I'm gonna get me a woman, baby
And you can have that man
Lord, I'm gone, gone, gone
I don't worry
Lord, I am sitting on top of the world
Yes, I am

How you think about it, Van?

I worked all summer, and all the fall
I even spent Christmas, in my overalls
But now, childs gone (yeah, she is)
An' I don't worry (boy, don't worry)
'Cause I'm sittin' on top of the world

(Lord, I reckon)

[Instrumental]

That Mississippi River
Is so deep an' wide
My baby's standin', Lord
On the other side
Oh, but now she's gone, gone, gone
An I don't worry
'Cause I am sittin' on top of this world

Can you blow me some of that horn, cat now?

[Instrumental & sax solo]

One summer's day (ooh-huh)
She went away (she went)
She went and left me
For good, to stay
And now she's gone
An' I don't worry
'Cause I'm sittin' on top of the world, yeah

A-you come here runnin'
Holdin' out your hand
I'm gonna get me a woman
An' you can have your man
Well, now she's gone, gone, gone
An' I don't worry
'Cause I'm sittin' on top of the world.

Get it.
