Well, my room has got two windows
But the sun don't ever shine through
And I've been so sad and lonely
Since I broke off, baby, with you

I live on a lonely avenue
Since you said that we were through
I feel so sad and lonely
And it's all because of you

I could cry or I could die
I live on a lonely avenue
Yes I do, lonely avenue

Well, my pillow is made of lead
And my cover is made of stone
And I toss and turn every night
I'm not used to being alone

I live on a lonely avenue
Since you said that we were through
And I feel so sad and lonely
And it's all because of you, baby

I could cry, yeah, I could die
I live on a lonely avenue
Don't you know children it's a lonely avenue
Play your guitar

Oh children, this is a lonely avenue

Well, my pillow is made of lead
And my cover is made of stone
But I toss and turn every night
I'm not used to being alone

I live on a lonely avenue
Since you said that we were through
And I feel so sad and lonely
And it's all because of you

I could cry or I could die
Oh, I live on a lonely avenue
Lord, ain't this a lonely avenue
Well, well, it's a lonely avenue, tell him now
I live on a lonely avenue
