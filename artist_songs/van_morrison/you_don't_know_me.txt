You give your hand to me and then you say hello
And I can hardly speak - my heart is beating so
And anyone can tell you think you know me well
You don't know me.

Now you don't know one who longs for you each night
And longs to kiss your lips and longs to hold you tight
You know I am just a friend
That's all I've ever been.
You don't know me.

[Refrain:]
I never knew the art of making love
'Til my heart yearned with love you
Afraid and shy, I let my chance go by
The chance you might have loved me too
You give your hand to me and then you say good-bye.
I watch you walk away beside some lucky guy.
To never, never know the one who loves you so.
'Cause you don't know me.

[Refrain]
