Wanna tell about my baby
Lord, you know she comes around
About five feet four
From her head to the ground

Well, she comes around here
Just about midnight, hu!
Make me feel so good
Make me feel all right.

And her name is G. (G) L. (L) O. (O) R, (R) I. (I). yi-yi-yi-yi
G.L.O.R.I.A. (Gloria)
G.L.O.R.I.A. (Gloria)
I'm wanna shout it ev'ry night (Gloria)
I'm wanna shout it ev'ry day (Gloria)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, all right

[Instrumental]

She comes around here, hu!
Til about midnight
Makin' me feel so good, hu!
Make me feel all right, hu!

Walkin' down my street, hu!
Comes in my room, hu!
Knocks upon my door
Then she comes in my room
