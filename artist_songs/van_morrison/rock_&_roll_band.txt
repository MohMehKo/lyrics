We just sat there
[Rock & Roll Band]

We just sat there
never ever thinkin'
we'd get much older.
Layin' out on the beach
with our heads on each other's shoulder,
and we flagged the highway drivers down,
and get a ride to nowhere.
That means sit somewhere out of town,
we never ever had a care.
Wasn't that a time,
yeah, so wasn't that a soul time.
Wasn't that a time,
wasn't that a soul time.

And we stayed out all night long,
and never ever wanted to go home then.
Crossed the fields and streams,
in meadows we did roam then.
And we did not wanna question,
and never asked for why,
and we look back in sad remembrance
and we softly sigh.
And wasn't that a time,
yes, wasn't that a soul time.
Wasn't that a time,
yeah, wasn't that a soul time.
And we danced, we danced, we danced
to a Rock & Roll band.
And we danced, we danced, we danced, we danced
to a Rock & Roll band
with the three guitars
and the drums
and the saxophone.

And we just sat there on the beach
never ever thinkin' we'd get much older.
So far out of reach
with our heads on each other's shoulder.
Flagged the highway drivers down,
and we get a lift to nowhere,
somewhere out of town.
We never ever had a care.
Wasn't that a time,
yeah, wasn't that a soul time.
Wasn't that a time,
wasn't that a soul time,
when we danced, we danced, we danced
to a Rock and Roll band,
and we danced, we danced, we danced
to a Rock and Roll band
with the three guitars
and the drums
and the saxophone.
