I just can't seem to take any more of this
Too many problems and not enough bliss
Got to give these hangers on a miss
I need some help I just don't get

No one seems to understand what's up
What's up, what's up
So called friends come and go
Things just don't add up
Trying to make my way
Through all this illusion and myth
I don't even have no safety net

Nero fiddled while Rome burnt
Napoleon met his Waterloo
Samson went spare when Delilah cut his hair
But little David slew Goliath too

I'm just trying to get some results
Listen I'm not trying to start my own cult
Please tell me something I don't know
I just wanna get on with the show

Nero fiddled while Rome burnt
Napoleon met his Waterloo
Samson went spare when Delilah cut his hair
But little David slew Goliath too

You'd think some program might do the trick
Let me tell you, this wall of fog is just too thick
I thought of everything but the whip
But baby, no one on my ship is up to it

I'm just trying, just trying to get some results
I'm not trying to start some kind of cult
Just tell me something that I don't know
Listen, I just wanna get on with my show

Just tell me something that I don't know
I just wanna get on with the show
Just tell me something that I don't know
I just wanna get on with the show
