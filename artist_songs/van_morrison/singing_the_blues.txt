Well, I never felt more like singin' the blues
'Cause I never thought that I'd ever lose your lovin'
You got me singin' the blues

Well, I never felt more like cryin' all night
'Cause ev'rythings wrong an' nothin' ain't right without you
You got me singin' the blues

The moon and stars no longer shine
A dream is gone I thought was mine
Nothin' left for me to do
But cry-i-i-i over you

Well, I never felt more like runnin' away
But why should I go?
'Cause I couldn't stay without you
You got me singin' the blues

[Instrumental]

The moon and stars no longer shine
The dream is gone I thought was mine
There's nothin' left for me to do
But cry-i-i-i- over you

I never felt more like runnin' away
But why should I go?
'Cause I couldn't stay without you
You got me singin' the blues

You got me singin' the blues

You got me singin' the blues
