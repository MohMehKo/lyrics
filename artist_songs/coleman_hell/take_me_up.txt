Friend I've got to thank you for
Taking me up
You're healing me with helium
And I know I said this long ago
But I'm taking you up
On that offer to fly your air balloon

Way up high
Where no one can look down on you (down on you)
Way up high
Where no one can look down on you (down on you)

Oh, take me up (take me up)
Take me up (take me up)
Take me up (take me up)
Yeah
Oh, come and take me up
But don't wake me up
I fell asleep on a cloud bed
Met an angel with some cardboard wings
When she starts to sing
How sweet the sound is
Up, up, up, and away then
Le-le-le-levitate yeah
Oh come take me up
Go raise me up
And let's leave the ground again, again, oh

Friend I've got to thank you for
Taking me up
Stuck your arms in elevator doors
And I know sometimes it hurts the most
But I'm taking you up
Cause what hurt the most is what made us soar

Way up high
Where no one can look down on you (down on you)
Way up high
Where no one can look down on you (down on you)

Oh, take me up (take me up)
Take me up (take me up)
Take me up (take me up)
Yeah
Oh, come and take me up
But don't wake me up
I fell asleep on a cloud bed
Met an angel with some cardboard wings
When she starts to sing
How sweet the sound is
Up, up, up, and away then
Le-le-le-levitate yeah
Oh come take me up
Go raise me up
And let's leave the ground again, again, oh

When the morning comes
Who's gon' take me, who's gon' take me up
When the morning comes
Who's gon' take me, who's gon' take me
When the morning comes
Who's gon' take me, who's gon' take me up
When the morning comes
Who's gon' take me, who's gon' take me
When the morning comes
Who's gon' take me, who's gon' take me up
When the morning comes
Who's gon' take me, who's gon' take me

Who's gon' take me, who's gon' take me up
When the morning comes
Who's gon' take me, who's gon' take...
