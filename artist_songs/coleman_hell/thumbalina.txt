I want to take you with me everywhere I go
Yeah
In the pocket of my jeans
Oh I'll keep you warm
Yeah

You suck my heart through a crazy straw
Then your freckles turned into lady bugs
In the sky they flew and they spelled out love
By the time I knew that you were the one

When you scream but you're voice ain't loud
And you wanna break down cause you feel so small
No you got one believer
Cause you're my Thumbalina
When you scream but you're voice ain't loud
And you wanna break down cause you feel so small
No you got one believer
Cause you're my Thumbalina

You can fit inside my palm
You can fit inside my palm
You can hide inside my palm
They got a shrinking machine
They make you feel small
Yeah
But when you're with me
You can be six feet tall

You suck my heart through a crazy straw
Then your freckles turned into lady bugs
In the sky they flew and they spelled out love
By the time I knew that you were the one

When you scream but you're voice ain't loud
And you wanna break down cause you feel so small
No you got one believer
Cause you're my Thumbalina
When you scream but you're voice ain't loud
And you wanna break down cause you feel so small
No you got one believer
Cause you're my Thumbalina
