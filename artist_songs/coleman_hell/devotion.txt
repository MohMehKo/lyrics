If I gave you my devotion
Like I should have when you were mine
Would you take it? Would you hold it?
Or would you say I didn't make it on time?

If I gave you you my devotion
Would you lay here with me tonight?
I could show you all the reasons
Why you should be waking up by my side
Why you should be waking up by my side

My devotion
My devotion

Well, you knew my reputation
But you loved me anyway
Now you have your reservations
But I want you, but I want you to stay

If you need time, I'll be patient
I can give you your space
When you're ready, I'll be waiting
'Til you're calling, 'til you're calling my name
'Til you're calling, 'til you're calling my name

My devotion
My devotion

All my life, all my loving
All my life, I devote it to you
Say, all my life, say, all my loving
Say, all my life, I devote it to you
Say, all my life, say, all my loving
Say, all my life, I devote it to you

If I gave you my devotion
Like I should have when you were mine
Would you take it? Would you hold it?
Or would you say I didn't make it on time?

My devotion
My devotion

We danced in the forest like flickering candles
And ran our fingers across the trees
The fire crackled like a record in the 70s
And when the smoke clears, you'll be someone else
The person you leave behind will be sleeping like a baby
With daisies curling up your arms and roses in your eyes
Run wild, you little flower child
