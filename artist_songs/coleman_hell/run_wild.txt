Smile for the sun, it makes your body glow
Makes your garden grow, don't you know
Breathe for the wind, it makes the water flow
Makes me want to know what's out there

A child of a king, pure as my father's soul, 
I will follow you
A prodigal son with nothing to offer you
It's not probable

One day, we can get away
Leave it all behind
Oh, we gonna run wild
One day, we can get away
Leave it all behind
Oh, we gonna run wild
Run wild, run wild, run wild

We swam in the night after the lilies closed
It was spiritual
A fountain of youth, we spiked it with whiskey, though
I won't live too long, this I know
Possessed by the light
I am a warrior singing highway songs
Thousands of miles
Everyone sang along like some angels on pain pills

One day, we can get away
Leave it all behind
Oh, we gonna run wild
One day, we can get away
Leave it all behind
Oh, we gonna run wild
Run wild, run wild, run wild

The valley of dreams is but a foreign land to the modern man
We ran through the trees
Chanting a mating call to the pagan gods out there
We used to sleep inside our mother's arms
Now it's under stars
The footprints we leave will be studied by scientists years from now

One day, we can get away
Leave it all behind
Oh, we gonna run wild
One day, we can get away
Leave it all behind
Oh, we gonna run
