Wolves outside, and they wear sheeps' clothing
Wool blocks eyes and I'm scared she knows it
I climbed up all of these mountain tops
So I could bark at the moonlight
Instead, you're the one who's mouthing off
I'm just a mutt at your bedside

Who'd have thought she's a howling moon?
Who'd have thought she's a howling moon?
Who'd have thought she's a howling moon?
Now I've seen everything

Wolves outside and they all do witchcraft
Dance all night in the love-drunk pitch black
It's not something I quite understand
How you could love a dog like me
Now you're the one with the upper hand
Sky filled with thunder and lightning

Who'd have thought she's a howling moon?
Who'd have thought she's a howling moon?
Who'd have thought she's a howling moon?
Now I've seen everything

I've strayed, I've strayed
I've run from everything
I've prayed, I've prayed
You'll be what catches me
I've strayed, I've strayed
I've run from everything
I've prayed, I've prayed
You'll be what catches me

Who'd have thought she's a howling moon?
Who'd have thought she's a howling moon?
Who'd have thought she's a howling moon?
Now I've seen everything

If you're still listening, I'm already gone
I wish you could've watched me when I was alone
Why I acted the way I felt
Now, I'm in Summerland
With daisies curling up my arms and roses in my eyes
