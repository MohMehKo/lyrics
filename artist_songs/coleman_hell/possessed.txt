There's something different in your eyes
The way you're moving, it's possessing me
Oh, I can't control it, oh, I can't control it
The way you're moving, it's possessing me
I was possessed
I was possessed

These hands have a mind of their own
My body is possessed by your love
And when we are finally alone
Nobody else will know but us

And we touched
I must confess, it was too much
I was possessed (I was possessed)
And we touched
I must confess (I was possessed)
It was too much, I was possessed

There's something different in your eyes
The way you're moving, it's possessing me
Oh, I can't control it, oh, I can't control it
The way you're moving, it's possessing me
I was possessed
I was possessed

These hands need a heart they can hold
Somebody to possess with love
This night's spinning out of control
Nobody else will know but us

And we touched
I must confess, it was too much
I was possessed (I was possessed)
And we touched
I must confess (I was possessed)
It was too much, I was possessed

There's something different in your eyes
The way you're moving, it's possessing me
Oh, I can't control it, oh, I can't control it
The way you're moving, it's possessing me
I was possessed
I was possessed

Oh, I can't control it
Oh, I can't control it
Oh, I can't control it
The way you're moving
Oh, I can't control it
Oh, I can't control it
Oh, I can't control it
Oh, yeah, oh god

There's something different in your eyes
The way you're moving, it's possessing me
Oh, I can't control it, oh, I can't control it
The way you're moving, it's possessing me
I was possessed
I was possessed
