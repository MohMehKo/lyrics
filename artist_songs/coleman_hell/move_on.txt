It's been brought to my attention
That you're no longer interested
In the time that I've invested
Or the things that I say
And I don't know your intentions
But lately, I feel the tension
And I thought that I would mention
That I will be okay

Just let me down, I'll be okay
Just let me down, I'll be okay
Just let me down, I'll be okay
Just let me down, I'll be okay

And at times, it will be rough
But don't worry, I'm alright
I know it can be tough
But I'll make it through the night
Don't call me on the phone
It only makes it hurt
I know it wasn't, yeah, from the start
Move on, move on, move on, my love
Move on, move on, move on, my love
Yeah, yeah, move on, my love
Yeah, yeah, move on, my love

Here it goes, it's my confession
That you were my main obsession
But we're left with no direction
Still, I want you to stay
Guess I couldn't face rejection
Or even my own reflection
Now I've got to face the question
Were we happy this way?

Just let me down, I'll be okay
Just let me down, I'll be okay
Just let me down, I'll be okay
Just let me down, I'll be okay

And at times, it will be rough
But don't worry, I'm alright
I know it can be tough
But I'll make it through the night
Don't call me on the phone
It only makes it hurt
I know it wasn't, yeah, from the start
Move on, move on, move on, my love
Move on, move on, move on, my love
Yeah, yeah, move on, my love
Yeah, yeah, move on, my love

Get a move on, get a move on
Get-get-get-get-get a move on
Get-get-get-get-get a move on
Get a move on, get a move on
Get-get-get-get-get a move on
Get-get-get-get-get a move on
