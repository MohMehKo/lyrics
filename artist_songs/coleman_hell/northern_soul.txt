I left when I was younger, went out on my own
Found a concrete jungle where weeds push through the stone
But I can still remember my bare feet in the soil
It flickers like an ember inside my northern soul

Hey now, hey hey yeah
Hey now, hey hey yeah
Hey now, hey hey yeah
In my northern soul
Hey now, hey hey yeah
Hey now, hey hey yeah
Hey now, hey hey yeah
In my northern soul
Hey now, hey hey yeah
Hey now, hey hey yeah
Hey now, hey hey yeah
In my northern soul
Hey now, hey hey yeah
Hey now, hey hey yeah
Hey now, hey hey yeah

Precious pow wow dancer, questions never posed
To ancestors with answers, I whispered to their ghosts
Before, I was embarrassed to call this place my home
Now it's what I cherish inside my northern soul

Hey now, hey hey yeah
Hey now, hey hey yeah
Hey now, hey hey yeah
In my northern soul
Hey now, hey hey yeah
Hey now, hey hey yeah
Hey now, hey hey yeah
In my northern soul
Hey now, hey hey yeah
Hey now, hey hey yeah
Hey now, hey hey yeah
In my northern soul
Hey now, hey hey yeah
Hey now, hey hey yeah
Hey now, hey hey yeah

Oh, it’s in my, oh, it’s in my, oh, it’s in my soul
Oh, it’s in my, oh, it’s in my, oh, it’s in my soul
Oh, it’s in my, oh, it’s in my, oh, it’s in my soul
Oh, it’s in my, oh, it’s in my, oh, it’s in my soul
Oh, it’s in my, oh, it’s in my, oh, it’s in my soul
Oh, it’s in my, oh, it’s in my, oh, it’s in my soul
In the light of the moon, we are reborn
No longer haunted by the spirits of our past
We leave behind our biggest mistakes
To find ourselves in the witching hour
