Meet me in the witching hour
Make my sins all come undone
Lift my spirit with your power
Dance until the rising sun

Kiss me, we're falling from the cliff's peak
We're slipping into harm's reach
We're marching to the heartbeat of a thousand dreams

In the witching hour, the witching hour
So tell me, are you with me now?
You with me now?
You found me in the witching hour, the witching hour
So tell me, are you with me now?
You with me now?

Meet me in the witching hour
Make my sins all come undone
Lift my spirit with your power
Dance until the rising sun

Godspeed, you're running, trying to break free
I'm begging you to take me
We're marching to the heartbeat of a thousand loves

In the witching hour, the witching hour
So tell me, are you with me now?
You with me now?
You found me in the witching hour, the witching hour
So tell me, are you with me now?
You with me now?

Meet me, meet me
Why don't you meet me?
Oh, why wonâ€™t you meet me?
