I don't want to die today
But if I do, send me up to Summerland
I don't got no time to waste
Heaven is a place called Summerland

I might come back as a wombat
In my other life, I was a butterfly
Can you hear the spirits calling?
Oh-we-oh-we-oh-ay, oh-we-oh-we-oh

In Summerland
In Summerland, in Summerland
In Summerland, in Summerland
In Summerland, in Summerland
In Summerland, in Summerland

I don't want to die today
I don't want to leave and never come back
I just gotta find my way
Looking for a place called Summerland

Triple goddess in the forest
Can you carry my soul up to paradise?
Shh, I think I hear their voices
Oh-we-oh-we-oh-ay, oh-we-oh-we-oh

In Summerland
In Summerland, in Summerland
In Summerland, in Summerland
In Summerland, in Summerland
In Summerland, in Summerland
In Summerland, in Summerland

The sinners and the saints
They all go to Summerland
A heaven full of second chances
A place where everyone can start again
