Mom and dad got high in the 70s and
They found some pot to plant a little seed in
Made a flower child, picking petals
Sining, "Love me, love me not"
You little flowerchild
You little flowerchild
You little flowerchild

The sunlight was just right, you had a crown of daisies
The song was so long that it made the crowd go crazy
The band was singing, la la la la la
For the flower children dancing in the sky

Mom and dad got high in the 70s and
They found some pot to plant a little seed in
Made a flower child, picking petals
Sining, "Love me, love me not"
You little flowerchild
You little flowerchild
You little flowerchild

The moonlight was too bright, it glistened on the lake and
That was the first time I ever saw you naked
You had me singing, la la la la la
Just two flower children dancing in the night

Mom and dad got high in the 70s and
They found some pot to plant a little seed in
Made a flower child, picking petals
Sining, "Love me, love me not"
You little flowerchild
You little flowerchild
You little flowerchild
You little flowerchild
You little flowerchild
Oh, little flowerchild
You little flowerchild
Oh, little flowerchild
You little flowerchild
You little flowerchild
You little flowerchild

You little flowerchild
You little flowerchild
You little flowerchild
You little flowerchild
