You gave me the light, but I couldn't go
The tears that I cried that I wouldn't show
I still love you, I still love you
But everybody gets cold feet, cold feet

And I need you to call me, and I need you for my relief
And I need you to call me, and I need you

Start running, hit the ground running with my
Start running, hit the ground running with my
Start running, hit the ground running with my
With my cold feet, with my cold feet
Start running, hit the ground running with my
Start running, hit the ground running with my
Start running, hit the ground running with my
With my cold feet, with my cold feet

Don't be nervous, don't be nervous
I'm just anxious on the surface
I still love you, I still love you
But everybody gets cold feet, cold feet

And I need you to call me, and I need you for my relief
And I need you to call me, and I need you

Start running, hit the ground running with my
Start running, hit the ground running with my
Start running, hit the ground running with my
With my cold feet, with my cold feet
Start running, hit the ground running with my
Start running, hit the ground running with my
Start running, hit the ground running with my
With my cold feet, with my cold feet

Everybody gets cold feet, cold feet
