I wish you had a hidden camera
So you could see I'm not okay
Cause when there are no hidden cameras
People act a certain way
I could use a hidden camera
I need a reason to behave
Won't you be my hidden camera
You can watch me everyday

I wish that you would wear a wire
So I could listen to you breathe
I wish you had a hidden camera, oh yeah
But I'm afraid of what you'll see
Cause if you had a hidden camera
You could go through all the tapes
All the evil that it's captured
The innocence that it's erased

And if you were a secret agent
Double o, double o
I would be your human shield
Now you know, my covers blown
