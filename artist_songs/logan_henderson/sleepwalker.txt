There was a moment we said our goodbyes
I sat and wiped the tears from your eyes, yeah
We said we needed space to turn and walk away
But you know how to make me call, back
So my darling dreamer, I'll see you tonight

I'm running through the nightmares you put in my head
Every time that I wake up, I'm in your bed

Lock these chains, throw away the key
Tried to stay away, but you grab a hold of me
She said "Keep walking, sleepwalker, keep walking"
You, you pull me under, drowning in the deep
Gotta stay awake, I don't wanna go to sleep
But she said "Keep walking, sleepwalker, keep walking, sleepwalker"

Holding my secrets, my lips are sealed
All of your demons, it turns out they're real
The shadows on the wall, watch me as I crawl
But you know how to make me come, back
I'm just a monster that you'll never fear

Lock these chains, throw away the key
Tried to stay away, but you grab a hold of me
She said "Keep walking, sleepwalker, keep walking"
You, you pull me under, drowning in the deep
Gotta stay awake, I don't wanna go to sleep
But she said "Keep walking, sleepwalker, keep walking, sleepwalker"

Why won't you ever let me leave?
Just fucking let me out
Every time that I'm out of reach, she says, "turn around"

Lock these chains, throw away the key
Tried to stay away, but you grab a hold of me
She said "Keep walking, sleepwalker, keep walking"
You, you pull me under, drowning in the deep
Gotta stay awake, I don't wanna go to sleep
But she said "Keep walking, sleepwalker, keep walking, sleepwalker"
