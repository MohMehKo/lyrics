I wish I could put you into words, so it would all make sense. 
I'd write you a thousand times, your faces in pages. 

Run your answers the best way you can, 
It's that you never thought that you'd be coming in last. 
(This is the wrong time, the wrong place) 

I was waiting for pages to read from
(You're always the same way 
The fresh starts with stained hands wear you out)

The weekend towns, the picture frames,
It's my favorite shirt, I'm so glad you came.
And I think you're wrong, it's not just vacation,
It's more than boys and girls and late nights.
(The lines fading. Why can't you see?
If you're everything, there's nothing left of me) 

Run your answers the best way you can,
It's that you never thought that you'd be coming in last. 
(This is the wrong time, the wrong place) 

You said that you could and that's all that you wanted 
To bring to the show and the leave without reasons
(I was waiting for pages to read from)
Who cares if it's right, it's been more than engaging 
These long walks and talks but these faces you're making now
(But you never decided to show your face)

Don't bother now you just said enough
Don't bother now you just said enough
Don't bother now you just said enough
Don't bother now you just said enough

Don't bother now you just said enough
Don't bother now you just said enough
Don't bother now you just said enough
Don't bother now 

You said that you could and that's all that you wanted
To bring to the show and then leave without reasons
Who cares if it's right, it's been more than engaging
These long walks and talks but these faces you're making 

You said that you could and that's all that you wanted
To bring to the show and then leave without reasons
Who cares if it's right, it's been more than engaging
These long walks and talks but these faces you're making now
These faces you're making now
