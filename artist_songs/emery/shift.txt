You said wait for me by the phone booth
Where we used to meet before school
You had something that you wanted to say 
About moving planets and coming round again
How did we waste such time and energy

This will ruin everything

Just like my dream
I caught your hand
waiting on arms of the part I can't stand 
But I still wave to you
Aw but I still wave to you

I can't find my heart 
(saved for you)
I can't find my heart
(saved for you)
I can't find my heart
(saved for you)
I can't find my heart

The same steps 
I waited to hear the right words
The words that I'd say to
But it was something you wanted to say 
about moving planets and coming round again
How can we waste such time and energy

This will ruin everything
This will ruin everything...

This will ruin everything...

Saved for you.
