Falling away from you [x2]
Always seems so tragic in my mind.
I hear that you're doing well now.
Things I wish I could have heard from you.
And it's been so long since the first time we tried,
Oh but anyway.
And all my friends say hello.

The phone rings, as soft sheets and daylight surround me.
She's gone, they tell me.
Are you listening?
For the life of me I can't see through this haze of sleepless dreaming.
Light breaks, the morning shades wake but rise no more.
I could have called her the night before empty broken promises lost.
I never said goodbye.
I never had the time.
I never said goodbye.

For the life of me I can't see through this haze of sleepless dreaming.
Dreaming. Dreaming. Dreaming.
Light breaks, the morning shades wake but rise no more.
I should have called her the night before you were broken.
Now everything's lost.
Everything seems lost.
All I see in my dreams.

Falling away from you. [x3]
Oh.
