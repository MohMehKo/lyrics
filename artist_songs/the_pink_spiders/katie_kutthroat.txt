Hey Katie Kutthroat were in the same boat 
Swinging for the fence but were swinging from a short rope 
I know theres no hope 
Were only scapegoats 
Living in a world full of hypocrites and turncoats 
But if you believe the mirror holds the most beautiful picture 
Well make ashes of our mistakes and well throw caution to the wind 
Dear Katie Kutthroat here is your price quote 
Appraisal of a feeling Ive included in a love note 
I sketched it in smoke left in your throat 
So you could never question the intentions of what I wrote 
And if you thought this was over let the distance bring us closer 
Lets take matches to the middle of beginning 
Middle 
End
