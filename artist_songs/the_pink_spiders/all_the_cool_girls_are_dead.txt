I saw you standing in the front row shaking wide eyed catastrophe 
Said you were looking for a boyfriend baby youre wasting your time with me 
Cause I dont want to be the one that settles for the barrel of the gun 
And were burnt out cause all the cool girls are dead 
I heard you finally hit the concrete 
Even streets have an aftertaste 
You tried to get me in the backseat then passed out after second base
