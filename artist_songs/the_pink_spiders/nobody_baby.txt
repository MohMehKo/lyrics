All you gotta do is make a little trouble
Give me one mistake and break it out on the double

Cause everybody's had a real good time
Everybody's walking crooked but they feel alright
Cause everybody here is nobody

And now you're nobody babyAll you gotta do is make a little trouble
Give me one mistake and break it out on the double
Baby stay awake and take another shot

Cause everybody here is nobody, baby
