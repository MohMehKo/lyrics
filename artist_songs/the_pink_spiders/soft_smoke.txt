Caught the green line down at Bleeker and Broad
And now it's dropping down the thirty below
I can't feel my toes but babby I'm on fire

We'll sleep in subways we'll spend time in cafes
These pretty girls and these Manhattan apartments
These New York police are all fuckin' liars

Staten Island princess so pretty in pearls
Drop it down make it an uptown affair
You got the money and I got the drugs
You're pretty pretty for a white white girl

Take me to the Mercury Lounge
Let's see what trouble we can get in tonight
Cause everywhere I go its like the end of the world

But with your back to the wall you're gonna be the lonely one
If you dance all night you're gonna be loved [x2]

Don't know where to start, you're breaking my heart
How's anybody supposed to love you, baby 'til you do?

But with your back to the wall you're gonna be the lonely one
If you dance all night you're gonna be loved [x4]

If you dance all night, you're gonna be loved
