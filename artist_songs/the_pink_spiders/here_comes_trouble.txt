Everybody says, "Uh oh, let's go,
Here comes trouble,
There's sirens in the streets,"

And I say,
"That's not trouble, that's so normal,"
I'm just trying hard to make you hear me
And you're trying so hard to make me quiet down

But I gotta be honest, I'm just
Mixing signals, changing frequencies
It's a desperate communication
I'm just trying hard to make you hear me
And you're trying so hard to calm me down

But I don't wanna be your next best option
I don't wanna be your next best thing
No, I don't wanna be, I don't wanna, I don't wanna
See the bright side or the silver lining
I just wanna keep my heart beat beating,
Stumbling but on my own two feet
No, I don't wanna think
I just wanna drink
To surviving while the sun's still shining now

Everybody says, "Uh oh, let's go,
Hurry on the double,
Seems trouble does come in threes,"

But these threes don't blur the lines,
They breathe them right in
I'm just trying hard to make you hear me
And you're trying so hard to make me quiet down

But I don't wanna be your next best option
I don't wanna be your next best thing
No, I don't wanna be, I don't wanna, I don't wanna
See the bright side or the silver lining
I just wanna keep my heart beat beating,
Stumbling but on my own two feet
No, I don't wanna think
I just wanna drink
To surviving while the sun's still shining now

I'm so enamored when I'm hammered and you're there
It's a disaster when I'm plastered in my chair
Why try so hard, my dear?
Hey, wake up, I'm talking here
Hey, your fighting silence feels like violence in the air

Oh-oh-oh

But I don't wanna be your next best option
I don't wanna be your next best thing
No, I don't wanna be, I don't wanna, I don't wanna
See the bright side or the silver lining
I just wanna keep my heart beat beating,
Stumbling but on my own two feet
No, I don't wanna think
I just wanna drink
To surviving while the sun's still shining now
