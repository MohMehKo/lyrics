I dont hang out in makeshift graveyards 
Ill serve my time in them soon enough and I cant deny the foolish compromise by satellites 
Stop! My routine runs cold machine guns it feels like poison to virgin tongues so try stop and die fiber
Optics tie us alive 
So adios sayonara prizefighter! You're no champion youre a casualty 
Turn yourself in youre trained chagrin its a sad charade 
In your disappointment I caught you smiling 
Bright shades of white nothing else reminds you of life nothing else inspires you to try 
It was candles on the dresser 
It was what you loved the most 
It was flashes in your mirror and you thought you saw a ghost 
And I hope this feels better and I hope that you stay true 
Seldom kissing 
Only wishing 
This is what I thought Id have to do
