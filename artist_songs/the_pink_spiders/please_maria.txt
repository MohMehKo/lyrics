We're melting in between
The building and the bus
It's you and me, but honestly,
It's still not us,
'Cause you've got plans, I understand
And I'll be on tour when you get back
And while we're so unlikely, love,
It's only you I'm thinking of

But it's so hard
When you won't let me tell you
What you want to hear
Let down your guard,
If only just a little,
'Cause you know I already have

And please, leave, Maria
'Cause every lie you step inside
Just drives me to the edge
And please, leave, Maria
'Cause falling out of love is worse
Than falling from the ledge

Together sleeping on the ceiling secretly,
Somehow the air we're in has stolen the gravity
And I don't care if people stare
Or say I've changed, 'cause that's not fair
It's just that I'm not quite so cold,
I'm happy not to sleep alone

But it's so hard
When you won't let me tell you
What you want to hear
Let down your guard,
If only just a little,
'Cause you know I already have

And please, leave, Maria
'Cause every lie you step inside
Just drives me to the edge
And please, leave, Maria
'Cause falling out of love is worse
Than falling from the ledge

And is it love?
'Cause I never thought about it any other way
And if it's love, I think that you'll know,
And even if you think you can't,
Please just try to understand

And please, leave, Maria
'Cause every lie you step inside
Just drives me to the edge
And please, leave, Maria
'Cause falling out of love is worse
Than falling from the ledge
