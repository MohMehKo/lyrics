The polyester vest she wears at the arcade
On a break from tearing tickets
Every minute spent on this old pinball machine

Saving up her money to pay her tuition
"Got a little left over" she thinks
So she puts it in the machine
Cause she's got a high score to beat

Hey Jane I got a little money
Wanna spend it on a night away?
We'll drive until tomorrow, Drive a mile for all our sorrows

Hey Jane I know your hungry honey
But I promise you that things will change
Just don't let your life's income determine your life's outcome

She had a good job that she traded for cocaine
Everyday became the same
And yesterdays were celebrated but forgotten so fast

Cause everyone around her surrounds her in excess
She's trying harder to convince herself
That all her better days are not in the past
And that this paycheck's gonna last
