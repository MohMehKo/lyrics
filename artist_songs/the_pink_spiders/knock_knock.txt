Knock knock knock
Before you enter cause the chances are I'm with another
On the floor all tangled up trying to forget when we were sober
So knock knock knock
Before you enter cause the chances are I'll be with whoever had a car to drive me home
And alcohol to last until the morning
For every argument I did not start for every chance you get to break my heart
I face another skirt chase I think I'm taking someone home
For every smile I see you shoot his way for every indiscretion I will make you pay
It's just another skirt chase I don't wanna be alone
And I think I've got the right idea and I think I'm taking someone home
So knock knock knock before you enter
knock knock knock baby I've told you once before
Knock knock knock before you enter baby I'm not asleep behind that door
