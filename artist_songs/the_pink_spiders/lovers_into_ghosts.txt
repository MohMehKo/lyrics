Watch our hero as he grows impatient 
Hes irritated so he keeps her waiting 
Building up suspense is good for leverage 
And she approaches 
Chewing words that he said 
A question mark thats penciled over her head 
She is treating bullet wounds with bandages 
And she says I dont really wanna wait forever wake up its now or never my lifes not on hold for you 
Oh god thats when it hurts the most 
When your reckless indiscretion is turning lovers into ghosts 
Then its real 
God thats when it counts the most 
Falling as she says that I am living for nothing 
Dying for proof 
Hes so surprised to find he cant stop it 
The more he thinks about it the more he says fuck it 
This is the last time that Im yours and youre mine he says with great relief 
But its not over 
This is no denouement 
Another calendar replaced 
As every hotel taunts the fact that she is over him 
And he says every conversation I remember ended with ill see you in November two months isnt all that long 
Shes a bomb and youve lit the fuse
