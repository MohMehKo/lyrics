Hey, gimme, gimme chemicals
Gimme the fix, gimme back control
A white-hot white revival,
We're gonna be saved tonight

A twist and hit with some friends of mine
We hang like sneakers from the power line
Now that I'm 26, in no state of mind
To feel relieved, or to be satisfied, singin',
"All this pressure and all this pain,"
And all these sins swim through my veins
If I could do it again, I'd probably do it the same,
But I'd try to cut back on the cigarettes

Hey, gimme, gimme chemicals
Gimme the fix, gimme back control
A white-hot white revival,
We're gonna be saved tonight

Hey, gimme, gimme chemicals
Gimme the fix, gimme back control
A white-hot white revival,
We're gonna be saved tonight

She blew my nose and then she curled my toes
Then she made me breakfast, laid out my clothes
Went back to sleep and never called her back
The only plans I make are to the block and back

But I can't get it out of my head
No, I can't get it out of my head -
There's a rhythm to the words that she said
And it keeps me screaming...

Hey, gimme, gimme chemicals
Gimme the fix, gimme back control
A white-hot white revival,
We're gonna be saved tonight

Hey, gimme, gimme chemicals
Gimme the fix, gimme back control
A white-hot white revival,
We're gonna be saved tonight

You know the pharmacy sparked the revival
And now they're giving it all away
You know the pharmacy sparked the revival
Yeah!

Hey, gimme, gimme chemicals
Gimme the fix, gimme back control
A white-hot white revival
We're gonna be saved tonight

Hey, gimme, gimme chemicals
Gimme the fix, gimme back control
A white-hot white revival
We're gonna be saved tonight

You know the pharmacy sparked the revival
And now they're giving it all away
You know the pharmacy sparked the revival
