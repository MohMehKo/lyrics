Mrs. Ruston, I survived the rest of your life
Unaware, oblivious, you couldn't be down,
And now you're given out the combination code
And they know

Mrs. Ruston, time retired all the lights
The electric air expired with the night,
But you're eyes are deep and cut through me
Here in the afterglow -
What a show

And she keeps sketching her dreams
From the back of her mind into the souls of machines
An audience breathes the troubles she's trying to forget
And these scenes, obviously
Though I don't know what they said
Somehow I know what they mean
But how can I trust the bridge if I didn't build it?

Mrs. Ruston, he was waiting there all along
What a fool, but how could anyone think it wrong
To wait, or hesitate from pushing you away,
If you'd stay?

And she keeps sketching her dreams
From the back of her mind into the souls of machines
An audience breathes the troubles she's trying to forget
And these scenes, obviously
Though I don't know what they said
Somehow I know what they mean
But how can I trust the bridge if I didn't build it?

The constellations falling slowly from the sky
With blurry edges through the tears that fill your eyes
You'd like to catch them, but you're too afraid to try,
'Cause it might be worth the effort
But it's just not worth the time

Mrs. Ruston, life resides inside of the grey
And every step reminds me what you said
About losing touch with those you love
And giving yourself away
Every day

And she keeps sketching her dreams
From the back of her mind into the souls of machines
An audience breathes the troubles she's trying to forget
And these scenes, obviously
Though I don't know what they said
Somehow I know what they mean
But how can I trust the bridge if I didn't build it?

When she keeps quiet and clean,
Despite the impact, in fact it's all that she needs
As an ambulance screams a choir to silence the regrets,
This one dream, evidently,
Was like a flashback trip that was stealing the scene
But how can I trust the bridge if I didn't build it?
