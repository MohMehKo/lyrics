She whispers like a megaphone 
Its less than subtle and not quite love 

Cause I can never be alone 
I asked for space and then she grabbed my shirt and held me from the window 
Hey hows this for space? 
So cut the signal if it still feeds back 
Its not an order its a heart attack 
As memories of your playground love are catching up to you but these battles need not swords 
This open journals empty rhetoric so par for the course 
A target audience to snuggle with no guilt or remorse 
You point and click and keep your distance 
Its the digital age up close in person 
Is old fashioned zero one is the rage 
The wireless age has got its people on leashes
