Doo wah doo wah things are getting petty
She said, "no more sex unless we're going steady"
I said, "alright goodnight. wake me when you change your mind"
Cause I don't wanna see your bedroom sugar
I'm not looking for love
And she says I don't wanna be the girl in your backseat tonight
What are you doing in that short skirt sugar?
You can't be lookin' for love
There's no time for fool around when I'm in another town tomorrow
