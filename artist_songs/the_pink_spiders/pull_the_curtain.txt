And even when I think I've said it all 
I find a tragedy to break my fall 
Cause everything I love is pain in motion 

Its moving like a ticker tape parade 
Continuing mistakes I'm glad I made 
Cause everything that hurts converts to lyric 

So please pull the curtain 
It's not a show 
I'm feeling redundant and I think you should know 
It's over, It's over 
Without inspiration I've got nowhere to go 
Stay closer, stay closer 
And if the walls stop shaking say it like you mean it 

Presented as the ministry of truth 
A gospel of confusion sold in youth 
You don't even make sense and we know that you fake it 

So please pull the curtain 
It's not a show 
I'm feeling redundant and I think you should know 
It's over, It's over. 
Without inspiration I've got nowhere to go 
Stay closer, Stay closer 
And if the walls stop shaking say it like you mean it 

I put my heart on the line 
But its not mandatory 
You know why we fell apart 
They don't know half the story 
I tried to work it all out but I was only dreaming 
We took the show on the road I dragged you kicking screaming 

I put my heart on the line 
But its not mandatory 
You know why we fell apart 
They don't know half the story 
I just wanted to something better 

So please pull the curtain 
It's not a show 
I'm feeling redundant and I think you should know 
It's over, It's over 
Without inspiration I've got nowhere to go 
Stay closer, Stay closer 
And if the walls stop shaking say it like you mean it
