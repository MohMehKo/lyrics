As I wake up alone, after years of playing musical homes,
I am not really sure, 'cause it's all such a blur,
But I think I'll be home in the fall
And as my friends live and breathe,
It seems they're doing just fine without me
'Cause I walk like a ghost without what meant the most to me 
Back before I had it all

And it's minutes to hours and hours to days,
It's cradles then taxes then caskets then graves
But you've got your own world to burn -
Don't wait for me, don't wait for me

And I was feeling alright
It was just me and Jack Daniel's tonight,
And I appreciated his company the same
It reminded me of Tennessee

And it's minutes to hours and hours to days,
It's cradles then taxes then caskets then graves
On these city streets we can't stop for a while,
We just live out our lives every mile after mile
But you've got your own world to burn -
Don't wait for me, don't wait for me
Don't wait for me

I'd fly to your arms if only I can move
And I'd find a way through the turbulent sky
'Cause I know and you know there's nothing to prove
This distance ain't only in miles

And it's minutes to hours and hours to days
It's cradles then taxes then caskets then graves
On these city streets we can't stop for a while
We just live out our life every mile after mile
But you've got your own world to burn -
Don't wait for me, don't wait for me
Don't wait for me, don't wait for me

So I guess this is the dream,
But no one said it'd be such a machine.
