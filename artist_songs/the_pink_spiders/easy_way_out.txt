I'm just another substance abuser, but baby I'm the future
And I know there's no easy way out
I've got nothing but problems and habits
Shifting through the static
But baby there's no easy way out

So are you cunning now?

Hey its obscene and its green and automatic
I know how to make it seem like its your fault
I believe it when you say you need it for the sway
When I'm screaming through the troubles
That the drugs don't solve

Broads in the bar in the car sipping vodka tonics
Another couple drinks and then they look just fine
It's easy, as they say, but believe me see I hate it
When the hardest part is acting like I just don't try
