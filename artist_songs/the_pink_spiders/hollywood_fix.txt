Back in Hollywood today Technicolor turned to gray
Altered senses were the primary impulse
Drinking whiskey everyday smoking second thoughts away
A skipping record was a secondary pulse

And I'm tired but not sleeping
Cause there's so much noise and binge drinking
But they all came back like we know they would
Gotta get your fix down in Hollywood

Near the dancing silhouettes Aaron stole the cigarettes
Everybody knew it but no one had the proof
And as the sun was coming up in a sea of empty cups
White suburban kids were all raising the roof

And I'm tired but not sleeping
As we chain smoke cigarettes without thinking
But they all came back like we know they would
Gotta get your fix down in Hollywood

Gotta love it, its so, so dangerous
Gotta love it, its so, so scandalous
Gotta love it, its so, so infectious
Gotta love it, its so, so dangerous
Gotta love it, its so, so serious
Gotta love it, you sense the sarcasm
