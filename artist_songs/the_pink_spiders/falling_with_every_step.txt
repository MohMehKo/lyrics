Oh, fashionistas, scene police and souvenirs -
Keepsakes from days I wish that I wasn't here
Snowflake, it's so hard -
You're a whole lot, you're a sham

But I think I want it, I think I need it -
Like I need a heart attack
Now I'm falling, falling, falling with every step
And I'm crawling, crawling past the company that I've kept

Oh, calm charisma, there's no story in your tears,
So let's just do nothing but hang like chandeliers
You're such a big shot
You're a astronaut, you're a flirt

But I think I want it, I think I need it -
Like I need a heart attack
Now I'm falling, falling, falling with every step
And I'm crawling, crawling past the company that I've kept
Every day is a runaround, all I want is a taste but now
I'm falling, falling, falling with every step

Falling, falling,
In the fault line I'm falling
Like an engine that's stalling,
And nobody, nobody's getting out alive
(Where I go, you go, and what I know, you know
There's no escape I swear, there are no secrets)

Falling, falling,
In the fault line I'm falling
Like an engine that's stalling,
And nobody, nobody's getting out alive
(Where I go, you go, and what I know, you know
There's no escape I swear, there are no secrets)

Falling, falling,
In the fault line I'm falling
Like an engine that's stalling,
And nobody, nobody's getting out alive
(Where I go, you go, and what I know, you know
There's no escape I swear, there are no secrets)

My heart was with her, but my body's on strike,
Fighting the poison that I've chosen tonight
She looked concerned, said, "Are you feeling alright?"
I didn't answer
(Stop me if you've heard this one)

Another bastard with a shit-eating grin,
So disingenuous, just phoning it in
Slowly fading, easy faking chagrin
She said, "I'm sorry,"
(At least that's what I think she said)

The faced manipulations of nefarious creeps,
The kind that reminisce about the heart of the streets, 
The kind that talked a lot of shit, but couldn't handle the heat,
The kind you saw it in their eyes it was the
Widening retinas acting as antennas
Nothing was sacred and nothing was safe at all

Wa-oh, wa-oh, we're falling so loud
Wa-oh, wa-oh, we're falling so loud
Wa-oh, wa-oh, we're falling so loud
Wa-oh, wa-oh, we're falling so loud

Now I'm falling, falling, falling with every step
And I'm crawling, crawling past the company that I've kept
Every day is a runaround, all I want is a taste but now
I'm falling, falling, falling with every step

Falling, falling,
In the fault line I'm falling
