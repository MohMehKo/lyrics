Woo-ho, we're a stunning contradiction,
A pieced-together picture
Of a satellite trying to fly
Woo-ho, this is feeling like stick-up
And I'm about to plan my getaway
Woo-ho, I guess it's better late than never
It's scary, but whatever -
At least it didn't lead me to lie
Woo-ho, even I'm prepared to settle
But I'm not about to give my heart away
To subjects without predicates

You chain me to the telephone
To keep me close when you're alone
I'm hanging up, you're begging me to stay
The busy signals compromise
Your innocence and alibis
So I'm about to let you walk away

Woo-ho, this is easier than lying
I'm not afraid of dying
But that doesn't mean I'm ready to go
Woo-ho, all the animals are trying
But I just wanna survive anyway
Woo-ho, we're a dangerous progression,
A volatile succession,
A saturation ready to blow
Woo-ho, it's a chemical reaction,
The acids and the bases break away
To subjects without predicates

You chain me to the telephone
To keep me close when you're alone
I'm hanging up, you're begging me to stay
The busy signals compromise
Your innocence and alibis
So I'm about to let you walk away

We're trapped,
Tangled in the slack -
A finger on the trigger
And a saddle on our backs
So get back,
The subtlety's a trap
We'll never take it easy
And we'll never take it back
'Cause we're trapped
Tangled in the slack
We'll never take it easy
And we'll never take it back

You chain me to the telephone
To keep me close when you're alone
I'm hanging up, you're begging me to stay
The busy signals compromise
Excuses, threats, and alibis,
So I'm about to let you walk away

You chain me to the telephone
To keep me close when you're alone
I'm hanging up, you're begging me to stay
The busy signals compromise
Your innocence and alibis
So I'm about to let you walk away
'Cause I can only let you walk away
