And now were hiding in towers 
Cracking security codes 
Jilted hearts to build jilted lovers 
And we are skyscrapers and its considered entrapment and its the deadliest sing 
Nobody knows our sorrow 
No ones aware of the shit were in 
Get down, somebodys coming and were dead if were found so dont make a sound 
This desperation is romance 
Our sense or urgencys love 
Shifting these sheets til our skins connected and waking up all alone 
I only love you in distance I only need you alone 
Under these circumstances every heartbeats criminal 
Brace yourself here comes the impact 
Its only worth it if it comes hard 
Darling trust yourself stick to your guns no one said a revolution was easy
