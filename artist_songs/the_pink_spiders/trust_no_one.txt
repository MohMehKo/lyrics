(Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah)

There's a foul-mouthed girl with no name
'Cause diet cokeheads, they're all the same
Behind the mirror, it's all fair game,
With all these demons in your head,
And all these strangers in your bed

And the word on the street is that
You sleep with everyone you meet,
But no one'll ever love you if you love no one
All aboard, all about
Getting down and putting out,
But no one'll ever trust you if you trust no one

(Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah)

Let 'em all come down when they crash
You're unemployed but you always got cash
It's every night for the jet-set trash,
With all these demons in your head,
And all these strangers in your bed

And the word on the street is that
You sleep with everyone you meet,
But no one'll ever love you if you love no one
All aboard, all about
Getting down and putting out,
But no one'll ever trust you if you trust no one

(Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah)

Tongue-tie me to the train tracks, train tracks baby,
I just wanna get back, get back steady
Tongue-tie me to the train tracks,
Every-nighter ridin' the rail

(Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, sham on!)

Tongue-tie me to the train tracks, train tracks baby,
I just wanna get back, get back steady
Tongue-tie me to the train tracks,
Every-nighter ridin' the rail

(Sh-sh-sh-shake!)

And the word on the street is that
You sleep with everyone you meet,
But no one'll ever love you if you love no one
All aboard, all about
Getting down and putting out,
But no one'll ever trust you if you trust no one

And the word on the street is that
You sleep with everyone you meet,
But no one'll ever love you if you love no one
All aboard, all about
Getting down and putting out,
But no one'll ever trust you if you trust no one

Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
