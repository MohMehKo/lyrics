She's out of luck, out of hope and out of cigarettes
Misunderstood with naked pictures on the Internet
Her social deviance is teasing me and I know what I want
And I'm really gonna really let her know that I like her
But I just don't care enough to fool around with love

Yeah my baby's pretty as a car crash
Sexy as a stinger of a hornet in your arm
Just another modern swinger
Screaming "catch me if you can"
With a cigarette in hand and it's love
It's heavy and it hurts and it's love

Strung out on blow
She doesn't know why she's not feeling good
Dropped out of school
Now she's moving out to Hollywood
Her reckless decadence is taking things a little too far

Yeah my baby's pretty as a car crash
Subtle as a splinter
Yeah my baby's smooth like sandpaper
Warm just like the winter
Screaming "catch me if you can"
With a cigarette in hand and it's love
It's heavy and it hurts and it's love

Staring at my shoes thinking of something to say
But nothing's better than what silence is saying
Every time I turn around
she's always looking away
It's just the nature of the game that we're playing

And I think I'm tapping out
I think I'm gonna skip the title bout

Yeah my baby's pretty as a car crash
Sexy as a stinger of a hornet in your arm
Just another modern swinger
Screaming "catch me if you can"
With a cigarette in hand and it's love
It's heavy and it hurts and it's love
