Oh brother, now we're going undercover
Cause she's more than just a lover to me
Can't you see that there's a reason
For this heresy and treason
It's the season for instability

Good lovin' two and one more in the oven
This is way above a discovery
Supersede your jurisdiction
Let's pretend that this is fiction
Make a story out of all that we see

So can we agree enough is enough?
Madeline sees the magazines for the trees
So she tells me that
Everything needs some time in the sun
Everyone breathes their oxygen quietly
Carefully carrying along

Hey neighbor, can I ask you for a favor?
See I'm sketching up the neighborhood's dreams
Cause I need to hit the walls
Of coffee bars and shopping malls
And show the world a side that they've never seen

So what do you think about teaming up?
Gravity sleeps when we see
That all we are is not all we will be

Cause everything needs some time in the sun
Everyone breathes their oxygen quietly
Carefully carrying along

Lookout

So can we agree enough is enough?
Madeline sees the magazines for the trees
So she tells me that
Everything needs some time in the sun
Everyone breathes their oxygen quietly
Carefully carrying along

So can we agree enough is enough?
Can we agree enough is enough?
Can we agree enough is enough?
Can we agree enough is enough?
