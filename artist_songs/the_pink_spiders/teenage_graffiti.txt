Teenage graffiti shut your mouth shut off the TV
Ain't got no money, honey I don't mind
Teenage graffiti slam the door when you're defeated
We're all a victim if you give us time 
We're all a victim of the times
So put your money where your mouth is honey
My generation's got it bad
When everybody's talking circles 
Better get up, get out, put out we've got a world to burn
Teenage graffiti empty bottles lie beneath me
Drank away my money drank away my time
Teenage graffiti shut your mouth shut off the TV
Ain't got no money honey I don't mind
Where we're going we won't spend a dime

And I don't wanna see your bedroom sugar 
I'm not lookin' for love
But when you call me a pretender
You know you shatter my heart
