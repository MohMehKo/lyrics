Oh my god,
Tied up to entertain the firing squad
I gotta hand it to you
I-I-I don't know why you're so trigger-happy,
I-I-I suppose you're gonna tell me
Tick, tick, tick,
My heart's the bomb that's going 2-4-6
This isn't easy, singin'
"I-I-I don't know why you do it to me,
I-I-I don't know why you bait me"

Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh
We go back and forth together,
'Cause she knows, she knows, she knows, she knows
She's no good for me
So we go, we go, we go, we go
Runnin' round and round in circles
In this goddamn stranglehold

Dead cassettes unwound,
I need another cigarette
Jet setter alligator,
I-I-I don't know, know no chaos theory - 
I-I-I can't even spell my name in cursive
She's so cool
She's such a temperamental animal
She's locked and loaded, singin'
"I-I-I don't know why you do it to me,
I-I-I won't go, go, go, go"

Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh
We go back and forth together,
'Cause she knows, she knows, she knows, she knows
She's no good for me
So we go, we go, we go, we go
Runnin' round and round in circles
In this goddamn strangleho-o-old
In this goddamn strangleho-o-old

You're coming on so strong,
Seems it won't be long before we're
Twisted into a knot on
The floor of this elevator

You're coming on so strong,
It seems it won't be long before we're
Twisted into a knot on
The floor of this elevator

Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh
We go back and forth together,
'Cause she knows, she knows, she knows, she knows
She's no good for me
So we go, we go, we go, we go
Runnin' round and round in circles
In this goddamn strangleho-o-old
In this goddamn strangleho-o-old

Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh
We go round, round, round in a strangleho-old
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh
We go round, round, round in a strangleho-old
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh
We go round, round, round in a strangleho-old
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh
We go round, round, round in a strangleho-old
