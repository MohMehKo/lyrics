Was it easy all along?
As the days went on and on,
Going through the motions,
Holding on to better years
But now all you'll hear from me
Is a familiar melody,
From the wires to the speakers
To your tired ears

So truth or dare, let me hear it
Say you'll stay like you mean it
Or don't let go 'til it feels like
Nothing's changed and nothing's wrong

With the things you tried to take
That I need to stay awake,
That I need to trade
The action for the old routine

So truth or dare, let me hear it
Say you'll stay like you mean it
Or don't let go 'til it feels like
Nothing's changed and nothing's wrong

'Cause day by day she's a little
Closer still to the middle,
So kiss and kill me a little
More and more until you're gone

'Cause every single minute
I'm drowning out there
And every single argument's endless
And I know ever indiscretion
Is breaking your heart
And every bad decision
Every bad decision is defenseless 

So truth or dare, let me hear it
Say you'll stay like you mean it
Or don't let go 'til it feels like
Nothing's changed and nothing's wrong

'Cause day by day she's a little
Closer still to the middle,
So kiss and kill me a little
More and more until you're gone
