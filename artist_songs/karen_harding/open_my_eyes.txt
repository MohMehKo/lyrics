Sometimes I sit and wonder how they do it
Say want they want to who they like
But I'm just too shy, too shy, too shy
I'm too shy, too shy, too shy

Head in the clouds, I wish I knew how to get there
So much to do with my life
But I don't know why, know why, know why
I'm so shy, so shy, so shy

Should've known hearts don't beat the same
When I'm lost, only me to blame
I wanna know how they can know my name

I'm tryna find a way to guide my life
I need a little help to get this right
Baby, can you open my, open my eyes?
Baby, won't you open my, open my eyes?
I'm tryna find a way to guide my life
I need a little help to get this right
Baby, can you open my, open my eyes?
Baby, won't you open my, open my eyes?

I've spent too long dreaming when I'd get there
And not enough time on the reason
I'm still here now, here now, here now
There's no doubt, I'm out of here now

It'd be much easier to stick with the dreaming
But I'm so desperate to make this feeling true
Come true, come true
Please come true, come true, come true

I'm tryna find a way to guide my life
I need a little help to get this right
Baby, can you open my, open my eyes?
Baby, won't you open my, open my eyes?
I'm tryna find a way to guide my life
I need a little help to get this right
Baby, can you open my, open my eyes?
Baby, won't you open my, open my eyes?

Open my eyes
Won't you open my eyes?
Baby, won't you open my, open my eyes?

I'm tryna find a way to guide my life
I need a little help to get this right
Baby, can you open my, open my eyes?
Baby, won't you open my, open my eyes?
I'm tryna find a way to guide my life
I need a little help to get this right
Baby, can you open my, open my eyes?
Baby, won't you open my, open my eyes?

Open my eyes
