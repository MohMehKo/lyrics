What is wrong with us?
All we do is fight
Get out of my view
I'm not feeling right

I'm not feeling good
I don't think I should
Something's standing in your view
I'm standing next to you

You and me, heavenly
Forever, what does it mean?
You and me, heavenly
Forever, what does it mean?

What is good for you
Doesn't mean too much
What you think is true
I can't feel or touch

I can't feel or touch
I don't feel that much
What is wrong with you?
You're standing in my view

You and me, heavenly
Forever, what does it mean?
You and me, heavenly
Forever, what does it mean?

What is wrong with you?
All you do is fight
Get out of my view
I'm not feeling right

I'm not feeling good
I don't think I should
Something's standing in your view
I'm standing next to you

You and me, heavenly
Forever, what does it mean?
You and me, heavenly
Forever, what does it mean?

You and me, you and me
You and me, you and me
