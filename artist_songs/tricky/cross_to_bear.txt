Jesus said to Mary, you really can come
I'm tired, love, and I'm feeling real numb
Gotta see if my father's come
I'm under pressure while I'm under the sun

Father priest expects me to lead
Leaves is easy, wants me to bleed
I'm scared, Magdalene, I fear I'm lost
I won't lie, don't wanna die on no cross

Track and these trees will answer my feet
Wanna stay and lay with you where you sleep

It's not my cross to bear
No, I don't care
It's not my cross to bear
No, I don't care

It's not my cross to bear
No, I don't care
It's not my cross to bear
No, I don't care

When I'm dead
They say I rise again
If I come
Will you still be here then

If I run
Will you run with me too
We're hiding inside
And find a space for two

Eat with friends before we leave
Magdalene said, be careful, friends deceive
Free my chains

It's not my cross to bear
No, I don't care
It's not my cross to bear
No, I don't care

It's not my cross to bear
No, I don't care
It's not my cross to bear
No, I don't care

Premature
Don't wanna die on no cross
When I'm dead, he was my body and fame
Premature
Don't wanna die on no cross
When I'm dead, he was my body and fame

This is not my cross to bear
No, I don't care
