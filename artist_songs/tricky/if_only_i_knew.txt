We were in love for just a second
You leave me with all those questions
That lead me to no direction

Was it just me?
You're all that I'd ever wished
You decide what it is
And let my heart sink
You decide what it is
Left me no choice to speak

I didn't know that kiss meant good-bye
It's funny how things played out in your mind
I didn't know that kiss meant good-bye
It's funny how things played out in your mind

How does it feel like to be so heartless?
Why are you breaking me for no reason?
Don't you know there are things I never learned
Teach me how to read your sign language

Only if I knew...
Why would I want it from you?
What kind of man loved me to no end?

I didn't know that kiss meant good-bye
It's funny how things played out in your mind
I didn't know that kiss meant good-bye
It's funny how things played out in your mind

Only if I knew
What I wanted from you
I can't go back there
I've done it again

I didn't know that kiss meant good-bye
It's funny how things played out in your mind
I didn't know that kiss meant good-bye
It's funny how things played out in your mind

I didn't know that kiss meant good-bye
Oh if I knew...
