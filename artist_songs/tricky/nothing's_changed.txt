Follow and there it goes,
Cherish I think she knows
'Cause if I change my strike
And I'm fly.

And nothing's changed
Feel the same
Is just sure the pace,
Still have the same.

Nothing's changed,
Feel the same.
Nothing's changed,
I still feel the same.

Follow and there it goes.
Cherish I think she knows
Says if I change my straight
And I'm fly.

Change my stright
Don't think I've tried?
I was born to give
Streets calling.

Nothing's changed
Feel the same.
Nothing's changed,
I still feel the same.

Nothing's changed.
I still feel the same.
Nothing's changed.
I still heard the same.

Nothing's changed,
Feel the same.
Nothing's changed,
I still feel the same.
