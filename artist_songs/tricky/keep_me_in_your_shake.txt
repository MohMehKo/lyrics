Already walking
This sunny morning
Can't stop the talking
The dogs barking
Can't wait for Sunday
It's heartbreak Monday
Let's keep it to this fun day
Then keep me in your sorry
Now keep me in your

Shake, shake, shake, shake
Till you get enough
Shake, shake
Is it getting rough
Shake, shake, shake

Oooh, the kind of things you do
To control my mind
Oh the kind of things you do
To keep me under your bondage
You got my soul under your feet
You got my spirit

Now keep me in your

Shake, shake, shake, shake
Till you get enough
Shake, shake
Is it getting rough
Shake, shake, shake

Oooh

I tapped her on the shoulder
I asked her: can I hold you
Can I be your molder 
You keep me in your folder 
Now keep me in your
Now keep me in your
Shake
Now keep me in your

Shake, shake, shake, shake
Till you get enough
Shake, shake
Is it getting rough
Shake, shake, shake

Shake, shake, shake, shake
Get enough
Shake
Shake
