Into the morning
Got me through the night
I've seen the light, yeah
I've seen the light

I live of what I need
I've got greed
I've been a sinner for as long as I know

So help me understand
The little that I know

Shadow dancing with my spirit
Got to face your demon on your own
Take my body and put it through the dust
I've been buried in the crust

Together now

So help me understand
The little that I know

Together now, together now
It's us now, it's us now
And there's them and there's them
And should we start again?

Together now
Together now
Together now
Together now

We beat the descendants of Christ

I'm confused

Will you help me, I'm confused
Will you help me, I'm confused
Will you help me, I'm confused

What you gonna do?
With the little that I know
With the little that I got

We're together now, we're together now
It's us now, it's us now
And there's them and there's them
And should we start again?
