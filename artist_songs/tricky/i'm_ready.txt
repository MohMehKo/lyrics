[Tricky:]
Ok, I'm ready
Ok, I'm ready

[Tricky & Francesca:]
Ok, I'm ready, concentrate my mind state heavy
I do a tour and invade like I'm at war no prisoners
What they seeking asylum for
I been insane and I've been contained
Manufactured and you sound the same
Your voice is not choice and your beats are lame
Round and round we all must go until we die
Round and round we all must go until we die

There's no freedom and we have none
For the reasons you can choose one
Through the seasons yeah we still try
Don't be worried you can feel fine
Don't you hurry they conceal time
They're too greedy you won't get none
They can steal it take your left lung
There's no freedom and you get none
Round and round we all must go until we die
Round and round we all must go until we die
Round and round we all must go until we die
Round and round we all must go until we die
