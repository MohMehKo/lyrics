Someone talk to me now
Energy won't move me
Oceans, oceans won't soothe me
Cry me a bayou
Slime, sleaze, pass through

Love it when I'm leaving
You love it when I'm leaving

Someone talk to me now
Energy won't move me
[?]

Love it when I'm leaving
You love it when I'm leaving

Angels with dirty faces
Disappear with out traces
Them bones

Angels with dirty faces
Disappear with out traces

Love it when I'm leaving
You, you love it when I'm leaving

Someone talk to you now

I love it when you're leaving
I love it when you're leaving

Cry me a bayou

Someone talk to you now
Energy won't move me
Oceans, oceans won't soothe me

Love it when I'm leaving
You love it when I'm leaving

Cry me a bayou
Slime, sleaze, pass through

Angels with dirty faces
Disappear with out traces

Cry me a bayou
And I'm leaving
