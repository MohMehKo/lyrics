Just around the corner
Right around the bend
I try to move forwards
But backwards is my friend

Like magnets I attract to you
Transparent, you, I can see straight through
Find our weather pattern
Your rings and I'm Saturn

Forces we can fight are
Courses run right into each
Other sources tell us we mix
Oh so very well

Hypothetically I
Soon know future for you or me
I love supersonic
Our love's alcoholic

Forces we can fight are
Courses run right into each
Other sources tell us we mix
Oh so very well

Forces we can fight are
Courses run right into each
Other sources tell us we mix
Oh so very well

Forces we can fight are
Courses run right into each
Other sources tell us we mix
