My funny Valentine

Knew a girl used to make me wait for hours
On the train in the rain with some flowers
Street girl used to live in the towers
Real sweet and then sour
Hard life just like Cinderella
Single mum had a kid with a fella
She was real, real like concrete
By herself walk like she own street
The other fella he was kinda like trash
The son's father but never did give her cash
I said there's things you really shouldn't have to do
Come with me and I'll look after you

My funny Valentine

My Valentine, take me away
Council flats make me blind
I try but these towers so grey
Nowhere for my children to play
My baby needs fun
My skin needs the sun
My Valentine
