If I come to your life, if I come to my life
The life was strange, we remain the same
Set the pain, share the strain
252 stuck in the game

Girls that I smack, it's for my babe
Stuck in my life, stuck in my wife
Stuck in the scratch, she says, she's dead
Waiting for God is very hard

I wait for God and it's very hard
I am the lamb, I don't understand
I drink your blood and I'm still thirsty
I wait for God and it's very hard

I'm stuck in the church, stuck in the verse
Stuck in the words, stuck in my nerves
Stuck in the wrong, stuck all along
Stuck in the bars, stuck in the cars

Stuck in the time, stuck in this line
I'm doing fine, I'm doing mine
I'm reading signs, we're killing time
I'm stuck in the time, stuck in this line

I wait for God and it's very hard
I am the lamb, I don't understand
I drink your blood and I'm still thirsty
I wait for God and it's very hard

I wait for God, I wait for Christ
I wait for wife, I wait for life
Tomorrow come, we feel the sun
Tomorrow come, we feel as one
The holy God, the holy son
Holy God and the holy one

We're on our own now, we're fully grown
I'm all alone when I roam

I wait for God and it's very hard
I am the lamb, I don't understand
I drink your blood and I'm still thirsty
I wait for God and it's very hard

I am the lamb, I don't understand
I drink your blood and I'm still thirsty

I wait for God and it's very hard
