"Let me tell you about my mother..." 

[Martina:]
For one, (more poor boy), there's someone
For he for she
For one (more poor boy), there's someone
For him, for me

[Tricky & Martina:]
Your eyes resemble mine, you see as no others can
Here inherit my kingdom, speak of our people's plan
I'll be here for my baby, for my baby I'll be near
So many things I need to tell you, things you need to hear

[Tricky:]
It was a day like no other
Clocks (hanging off)
It was said they dropped the bomb
And I walked out the door
Feeling lonely, (I see rain/as a ray)
Thinking of what was once
So I go in search of people
(Song of) the inhabitants
The air is filled with chemicals
So this is the aftermath
Walking over rubble
Which was once (cause's calf)
Down to the center
Which used to be central

[Martina:]
So this is the aftermath

For one, (more poor boy), there's someone
For he for she
For one (more poor boy), there's someone
For him, for me

[Tricky & Martina:]
Your eyes resemble mine, you see as no others can
Here inherit my kingdom, speak of our people's plan
I'll be here for my baby, for my baby I'll be near
So many things I need to tell you, things you need to hear

[Martina:]
For one, (more poor boy), there's someone
For he for she
For one (more poor boy), there's someone
For him, for me

How can I
How can I
How can I be sure
In a world that's constantly changing
How can I be sure

Just when I thought I was winning
Just when I thought I could not be stopped
Just when I thought I was winning
Just when I thought I could not be stopped
how can I be sure
