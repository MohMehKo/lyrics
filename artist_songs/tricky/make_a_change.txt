Make a change for Maisie
She don't understand the days, yeah
With our different deeds
No more baa baa black sheep

'Cos Maisie's not the slave
Breakaway the chains
You know nothing else remains
No more last names

'Cos Maisie's not the slave
Breakaway the chains
You know nothing else remains
No more last names

If you live a lie
Stay before the hatred
If you live a lie
Stay before the hatred
If I make a change for you
Whose gonna make a change for me?

If I'm not with you Maisie
With no more real reason
Wanna know my real tune
Wanna know my real tune

It's your turn to fuck with things that they say
It's your turn to fuck things they say
(Yeah)

Gonna make it last forever
