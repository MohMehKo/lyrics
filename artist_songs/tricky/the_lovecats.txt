We move like cagey tigers
Like cagey tigers
We couldn't get closer
The way we talk, the way we walk
The way we stalk, the way we kiss

We slip through the streets while everyone sleeps
Getting bigger and brighter and wider and lighter
Bigger and brighter
Wider and lighter

Into the sea, you and me
All these years and no one heard
I'll show you in spring, it's a treacherous thing
We missed you hissed the love cats
We missed you hissed the love cats

We're so wonderfully wonderfully
Wonderfully wonderfully pretty
You know that I'd do anything for you
We should have each other for tea, huh?
We should have each other with cream
Then curl up by the fire and sleep for a while
It's the grooviest thing, it's the perfect dream

Into the sea, you and me
All these years and no one heard
I'll show you in spring, it's a treacherous thing
We missed you hissed the love cats
We missed you hissed the love cats

Like cagey tigers
We couldn't get closer
The way we talk, the way we walk
The way we stalk, the way we kiss

We slip through the streets while everyone sleeps
Getting bigger and brighter and wider and lighter
Bigger and brighter
Wider and lighter

Into the sea, you and me
All these years and no one heard
I'll show you in spring, it's a treacherous thing
We missed you hissed the love cats
We missed you hissed the love cats
We missed you hissed the love cats
We missed you hissed the love cats
We missed you hissed the love cats
We missed you hissed the love cats
We missed you hissed the love cats
