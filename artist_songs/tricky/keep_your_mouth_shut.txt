And if the honey's think I'm stuck up
I tell 'em, "Shut the fuck up"
And if the honey's think I'm stuck up
I tell 'em, "Shut the fuck up"

All that she meant was good
All that she meant was good
Give her some time
Give her some room
All that she meant was good

Better keep your mouth shut, babe
Next to your chest
Better keep your mouth closed baby
And keep it close to your chest
Better keep your mouth closed baby
Keep it close to your chest

All that she meant was good
(Not goin' down that road)
All that she meant was good
Give her some time
Give her some space
All that she meant was good

How she reacted was right
Mother I'm hungry, mother I'm hungry
Father will you feed me? Father will you feed me?
Mother I'm hungry, father will you feed me?
Mother I'm hungry, father will you feed me?
Mother I'm hungry, father will you feed me?

How you reacted was right
Not goin' down that road
How you reacted was right
Not goin' down that road

Mother I'm hungry, father will you feed me?
Best to keep your mouth shut, baby
And keep it close to your chest
