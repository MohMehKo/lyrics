(There's) too many people, too many dying 
Too many lying, too many crying 

(There's) too many voices, so little choices 
At night I lie awake, feels like﻿ heartache 

Feels like heartache, how long will the night take 
How long will the night take, it feels like heartache 

The night has come, they say I rise crime rate 
[?] can't wait  

I﻿ rise my fist the thunder break through 
Make a wish who will you run to 

(There's) too many prisons taking away from family 
Too many reasons to lose your sanity 

I lie awake and let the visions take me 
Think of life and how it tried to break me 

Had no choice, had to settle 
Hear a voice now they burn from metal 

There's too many shouts and they call it treason
Can't relate and hate without reason﻿

(There's) too many guns, pray for God to come quick
He doesn't come, my God is real sick
