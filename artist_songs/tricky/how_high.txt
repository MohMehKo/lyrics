If I say, "Jump, jump"
You say, "How high?"
Standing like a mannequin
Mannequins don't fly
Don't swim, don't grin
Take it like a real man
Take it, fake it
Then she ran

I try to show you
But I can't grow you
I try to know you
But I can't hurt you

Watch
See me how I fly fast
See me how I fly past
No time for rest, separate from the rest
Seperate from the rest now

Watch
See me how I fly fast
See me how I fly past

Please you'll move quick
You're making me real sick
No go, no chance
I don't slow, don't dance

I try to show you
But I don't know you
I try to know you
But I can't grow you

Watch
See me how I fly fast
See me how I fly past
No time for rest, separate from the rest
Seperate from the rest now

Watch
See me how I fly fast
See me how I fly past
No time for rest

If I say, "Jump, jump"
You say, "How high?"
Standing like a mannequin
Mannequins don't fly
Don't swim, don't grin
Take it like a real man
Take it, fake it
Then she ran

If I say, "Jump, jump"
You say, "How high?"
Standing like a mannequin
Mannequins don't fly
Don't swim, don't grin
Take it like a real man
Take it, fake it
Then she ran

I try to show you
But I don't know you
I try to know you
But I can't grow you

Then she ran
