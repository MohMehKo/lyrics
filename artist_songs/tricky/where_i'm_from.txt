Damn bam, read the lines
Bleed succeed, we design
I couldn't care less It's a killing time
We're killing mine you're feeling fine

Running every time and every sign
Every line and every crime
No snack, it brings you curse
No sweat, you like your worse

Strange fruit like silver
Changing bombs into ear gums
Running every time and every sign
Every line and every crime

Where I'm from
There's something wrong
Something wrong
I don't belong

Where I'm from
There's something wrong
Something wrong
I don't belong

Please be still
Not for real
Please be still
Not for real

Where I'm from
There's something wrong
Something wrong
I don't belong

Please be still
Not for real
Not for real
Not for real

So you really want it, yes, we got it
If you listen in then, yes, you got
We want a company we're in
Let's do talk shit

I don't really want to have no problems here
I don't really want to have no problems here
All I really want to do is make this clear
We do bleed you
So deceive your mind and nose
When I don't see in

Wosen grosen to a dream
It bozen dozen to something
Hold it tight when cuts run deep
No one sees what you're hiding

Where I'm from
There's something wrong
Something wrong
I don't belong

Where I'm from
There's something wrong
Something wrong
I don't belong

Please be still
Not for real
Please be still
Not for real

Where I'm from
There's something wrong
Something wrong
I don't belong

Please be still
Not for real
Not for real
Not for real

Such you gonna get
And you see ya
Something you don't wanna
You don't wanna see ya

La solita vita non modifica il mondo
Solo e' se una donna puo' fermare l'onda
Rosso fuoco viva nel mio petto
Solo una parola c'e' rispetto
Scelgo, lo voglio non aspetto

Che l'onore del l'onore del tuo scettro
Blitz a diaz, polizia
Blocco nero e' la tua spia
Non mi fermero' mai ai tuoi richiami
Corro piu' veloce della tua ferrari

Where I'm from
There's something wrong
