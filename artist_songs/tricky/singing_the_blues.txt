I’ve been workin' so hard
Just came home from my job
I look down in my wallet
Goddamn it I been bought

Where can my money be now?
Five of the week’s long work
What can I do now?
I got so many bills to pay

You got me singin' the blues
And I’m payin' all my dues
You got me singin' the blues
And I’m payin' all my dues, yeah

I got to tell you that
The blues reached out of my pocket
People, oh what a shame
The bills are gonna rob me tomorrow
That’s why I need my ten dollars today

You got me singin' the blues
And I’m payin' all my dues
You got me singin' the blues
And I’m payin' all my dues

The blues reached out of my pocket
People, oh what a shame
The bills are gonna rob me tomorrow
That’s why I need my ten dollars today

You got me singin' the blues
And I’m payin' all my dues, yeah
You got me singin' the blues
And I’m payin' all my dues, yeah

The blues has got me singing
I said the blues has got me singing
Said the blues has got me singing
Said the blues has got me singing

Baby, baby, I gotta singin'
Singin' in the mornin'
Singin' in the new day
Gotta singin', yes gotta, ohh

The blues reached out of my pocket
People, what a shame
The bills are gonna rob me tomorrow
And that’s why I need my ten dollars today

You got me singin' the blues
And I’m payin' all my dues
You got me singin' oh the blues
