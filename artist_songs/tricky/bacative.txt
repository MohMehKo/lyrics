We gangsta na full like the Bull Gravana
In a leather trenchcoat mek no better Milano.
Black never felt disguise me mask cleaner?
She dark cloud night. Me a Tricky and Keener.
Decipher why my gem’s so with girth you can’t see no.
Help me bust the door with the guys, and team up.
It’s a Scarface and the girl from Reno.
Take off my mask and a guy can sneak up.
Leave off if I left off while lean up.
Left while under water while tomorrow to clean up. 
Clean up. Speak up before it gets serious.

There's no exit 
I can't stand still 
Keep on running
