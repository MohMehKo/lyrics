So you like to demise with your pen
Was the same, I was the same that when?
Then and now, I wanna change
But don't know how
Do's and don'ts, don'ts I don't like

She's not Tina and I'm not like Ike
But what is Ike like
Is Ike what you write
I don't know, I don't know
I don't know, I don't know

We'll disarm you, ask Julian Palmer
Only jokin', too much smokin'
But it's okay, it's okay
We've been through too much yesterday

Tell you what we're gonna do
They'll protect me from me, I'll protect from you
By any means, by any means
By any means, by any means
Please, won't you try?
Stop me talkin' like a tough guy

Subject matter's love
Subject matter's love
What would I need another enemy?
I know I love you

I can feel you in my energy
I'm too scared to be a gun totting gangster wanna be
I've got too much love

Meet you on Mondalay
(Too much inside of me)
Or next week
If I'm Tina, I guess I'm weak
Big take makin' my head ache
Big take makin' my head ache

It's not your fault
You don't understand
Take our hand
We give, so don't be negative

You don't feel the, 'cause you feel yourself
Stuck up in your own head
Leave that till I'm dead
What do I think?
I think instinct
