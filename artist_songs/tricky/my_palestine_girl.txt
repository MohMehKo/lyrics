[Tricky:]
And she's got a wiggle when she walk
A giggle when she talk
She’s close to God
I dribble like a dog
She’s my Palestine girl
My Palestine baby
She drive me crazy
The sun make me lazy

I take a trip to Gaza
It’s love I’m really after
She tells me happy, be
We walk happily
I haven’t seen her lately
I worry about her safety
I take a trip to Gaza
It’s really love I’m after

If she’s trapped in Babylon
Tell her that I won’t be long
If she’s trapped in Babylon
Tell her that I won’t be long
If she’s trapped in Babylon
Tell her that I won’t be long
If she’s trapped in Babylon
Tell her that I won’t be long

[Blue Daisy:]
Imprisoned in Babylon
This city is sin
A state of mind with thoughts of horror is so fucking frightening
These demons are out to run their course
A living corpse dead to any feeling
Not meant to cross with blood-hungry whores
Unloading semen, unrested feeling
No rest for the wicked there ‘til they’ve paid secretin’
But to them she’s creepin’
Through the night of sleepin’

[Tricky:]
I take a trip to Gaza
It’s really love I’m after
I take a trip to Gaza
It’s really love I’m after

If she’s trapped in Babylon
Tell her that I won’t be long
If she’s trapped in Babylon
Tell her that I won’t be long
If she’s trapped in Babylon
Tell her that I won’t be long
If she’s trapped in Babylon
Tell her that I won’t be long
