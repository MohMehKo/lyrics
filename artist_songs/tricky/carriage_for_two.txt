Water, now I've got me a daughter
Carriage for two
I call my baby Boo

Hey T, I've got a little black girl
And this little black girl's beautiful
Carriage for two
Now come on, yeah

Carriage for two
I call my baby Boo
Hey T, I've got a little black girl
And this little black girl's beautiful
I try to do what's dutiful

Water, water, now I've got me a little daughter
Carriage for two
I call my, I call my baby Boo
Hey T, I've got a little black girl
And this little black girl's beautiful

I try to do, I try to do
I try to do what's dutiful
I'll teach her to lead
And no, never must she let go

Your father's rich
I teach her to lead
But never must she let go
Your father's rich
Your father's from the get-go

Them that's got shall get
And them that's not shall lose
It's all the Bible says
It's easy when you lose

Mama may have and Papa may have
But God bless the child
But God bless the child
That's got his own

Them that's got shall get
Them that's not shall lose
It's all the Bible says
It's easy when you lose

Mama may have and Papa may have
But God bless the child
That's got his own
But God bless the child
That's got his own

Beautiful, just beautiful
Is beautiful, is beautiful, is beautiful
And water, it's beautiful that daughter

And God bless the child
That's got his own
God bless the child
That's got his own
Got his own, got his own

Your father's rich
Your father's from the get-go
Your father's rich
Your father's from the get-go

And so many times never was this easy
I wish you're strong, baby, don't you cry
So tiny
