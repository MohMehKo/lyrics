Starts off in my hips, move to my lips
For all those who want to analyze me
For all those who want to analyze me
Start it off in the hips, move to my lips
For all those who want to analyze me

My mother committed suicide, when I was four or five
I love Mike O, was killed by a psycho
I love Mike O, was killed by a psycho
But I'm not sad or sorry, 'cause we be tomorrow
But I'm not sad or sorry, 'cause we be tomorrow

Will it be on hot land, on hot sand
Or maybe a concrete corner, December?
Red zones in my head phones
The Devil's tools, inside us fools
The Devil's tools, inside us fools

Love shall, leave me alone
Love shall, leave me alone
Love shall, leave me alone
Love shall

Will it be on hot sand, on hot land
Or maybe a concrete corner, December?
Red zones in my head phones
The Devil's tools, inside us fools
The Devil's tools

Love shall, leave me alone
Love shall

Will it be on hot land, on hot sand?
Will it be? Will it be?
Will it be on hot land, on hot sand
Or maybe a concrete corner, December?

Red zones in my head phones
Red zones in my head phones
And red zones in my head phones
Red zones
Mmm mmm
