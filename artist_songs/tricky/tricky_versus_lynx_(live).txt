Force like that fill up in your jaw like the lights
Warlords with the full force
Drugs, a bitch and then it's a war
Run for the rich and give to the poor
We're all telling kids to get the most oil
Bring the cops in the mix 
We livin' no more
Won't make your car start
A dark heart
Kill and get your ass caught
You're dead now
It's not a problem
The kids who will not steal
the drugs they don't have
Still just kill
In the ghetto this shit is unreal
Nigga's escorts freak the downhills
Shots be ringing like Chinese bells
In fly females, out flip the Catskills
Madness ain't quittin' until
Your night to see jail
And get the raw meal
Mad Dog fought infinity
Ain't trying to be no public enemy
Outlaw like my nigga Red Dog
Step up, bitch and get rough
Nigga with .44's won't lie
A .45 or higher sport nice
Cruise to try to have a kill for your eyes
Lose your life
It feels so nice
Jet for the poor lights, no dice
One thing I don't like is a low light
Trying to get me for selling Snow White
Flying taxi my girl's were so right
When to say what
You trust, you know
No bad boy cops with facts you know
Then some of them flip, they flop the show
Them punk ass bitches got to go
Murder on the mainland
Where the gang's slaying the game plan
Ain't trying to be name brand
Out to the girls and boys and
This went down like Durban Poison

Murder on the mainland
Where the gang's slaying the game plan
Ain't tryin to be name brand
Out to the girls and boys and
This went down like Durban Poison

Just like two my crew is blessed
Doing things with my niggas that I knew was right
If you decide to detest
Like you do when trying
As far as picking up your chest
That be suicide, nigga
See that trigger
All you do is hang
It's a front, take a punt
And it's smooth to guide
Curse the 'ho 'til she takes you in her arms again
Play the role if you ain't a dog
But when you kids get alot of cash off the ash
Shortin' cats in the block of flats
Cops that harrass better watch their backs
Falls well strapped and then broke them flat
Hold gas to the mattress
Drop a match
'Cause that's where your at niggas are off with that
Try and flop me and I'll flop you back
Shout out "kill" and the dogs attack
Want a mil, what's with that
We're all 'bout still and shot the crack
Love the bitches with alot of back
Plus the titties, what you got to ask?
Mad Dog straight ghetto now
Live in this slum but I'm gettin' out
My soldiers wanna knock you out
Don't f**k around just shut your mouth
Murder on the mainland
Where the gang's slaying the game plan
Ain't trying to be name brand
Out to the girls and boys and
This went down like Durban Poison
Murder on the mainland
