I got a letter from the government
The other day
Opened it and read it
It said they were suckers
They wanted me for their army or whatever
Picture me givin' a damn, I said never
Here is a land that never gave a damn
About a brother like myself
Because I never did
I wasn't wit' it, but just that very minute...
It occurred to me
The suckers had authority
Cold sweatin' as I dwell in my cell
How long has it been?
They got me sittin' in the state pen
I gotta get out, but that thought was thought before
I contemplated a plan on the cell floor
I'm not a fugitive on the run
But a brother like me begun, to be another one
Public enemy servin' time, they drew the line y'all
They criticize me for some crime

I got a letter, I got a letter, I got a letter
Picture me given' a damn, I said never
Mmm... mmm... mmm
It occurred to me
The suckers had authority
Cold sweatin' as I dwell in my cell

Nevertheless they could not understand
That I'm a black man, and I could never be a veteran
On the strength of situations, I'm real
I got a raw deal, so I'm lookin' for the steel
Looking for the steel
