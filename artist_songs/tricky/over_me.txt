Boy take man f-clue
Ya fool boy think say more a comearound
Yo, let's take the downtown

Me have me gone in a me yard
A me guard so if a boy want
Me seen of a the scene
And come back without a clue
Take me feel afraid
Me pop off and ease off
To me want the marathon crew

Me have me gone in a me yard
A me guard so if a boy want
Me seen of a the scene
And come back without a clue
Take me feel afraid
Me pop off and ease off
To me want the marathon crew

When love is lost
All I hear are gunshots over me
When love is drawn
Soaks and floats all over me
Over me
Over me

When you think a one or two, do and ya
They ready to kill them couldn't cross the border
Shot a lick them right middle left to center
Like sunshine they shot them over and over
The make sure them dead their body in a corner
Blood run down like some stagnant water

When lonely
It gives and gives all over me
When love's strong
It goes on and on all over me
Over me
Over me

Will ever since then they get me blood warm
I never come so I'd wish I wasn't born
Another punk guy's ringing the alarm
Now what's left is cpr but he's already gone

When love is lost
All I hear are gunshots over me
When love is drawn
Soaks and floats all over me
Over me
Over me

When lonely
It gives and gives all over me
When love's strong
It goes on and on all over me
Over me
Over me
