I believe in eye deceivin'
Bob 'n weavin', I can breathe in
Make a wish in flower fishing
Moving vibration, mild relation
I'm jamaican on your radio station
Got a curse in, could be worse in
You first in a hearse in
Good as dead as nothing left in
Nothing left in, some might heading
I need a head rest in, feed from a warm breast
A man making hits with my child-bearing hips
Underground like, who's it sound like
You all sound the same but you don't know my name

I believe in people lying
I believe in people dying
I believe in people trying
I believe in people crying
I believe in people balking
I believe in people talking
I believe in people breathing
I believe in people being

We all sound the same, you don't know my name
Rearrange and things don't change
Things remain, feel the strain
Stress, catch my breath
Get some rest, [?] (There'll be a new tale of he and I)
And from the mess, couldn't care less (In fact any time, every day)
Sugar cane is like a smack to my vein (Write fictional stories)
Shook fame, but I don't complain (If you want to, on the street)

I believe in different reasons
I believe in breath through seasons
I believe when snow flakes fall
I believe in buildings tall
I believe in people bombing
I believe in people warring
I believe diseases coming
I believe, that's why I'm running

Keep living
Keep living

You've gotta ask before he attacks (There'll be a new tale of he and I)
You've got the flats, dub my sacks (In fact any time, every day)
You've got the city, move out the country (Writing fictional stories)
I'm scrunching friends that are punchy (If you want to, on the street)

I believe in people falling
I believe in people warring
I believe diseases coming
I believe, that's why I'm running
I believe in people balking
I believe in people talking
I believe in people breathing
I believe in people being

Keep living
Keep living
Keep living
Keep living
Keep living
Keep living
