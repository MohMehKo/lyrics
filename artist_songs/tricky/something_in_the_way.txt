[Francesca:]
Come with me
How have you been
How's your girl
Why haven't you seen me
Music swings
And I get weak
Fixed to fall

Seems there's something in the way
Until I'm overground
Got nothing left to say
Then I'm homeward bound

So leave me where I lay
Your role is over now
So leave me where I lay
Your role is over now

Hm, hm, hm, hm
Your role is over now
Hm, hm, hm ,hm
Your role is over now

See the games you play
You go around and round
Wash away the grey
Can you hear the sound

So leave me where I lay
your role is over now
So leave me where I lay
your role is over now

Hm, hm, hm, hm
Your role is over now
