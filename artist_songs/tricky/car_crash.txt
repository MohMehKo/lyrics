You leave me hungry
Wanting more
Am I thirsty
I wasn't sure

See me driving
Through the rain
Why am I driving?
I can't explain

In my car to where you are
I won't make it
I can't make it
In my car to where you are
I can't make it
I won't

I am sliding
I lose my breaks
The lights are blinding
The earth quakes

Now I'm lying
Will I die?
Will they find me?
Will they try?

In my car to where you are
I won't make it
I can't make it
In my car to where you are
I can't make it
I won't make it

Doesn't matter 'bout the time we make
Doesn't matter, it doesn't shatter
If time we take
You know they're lost

While I'm dragging the cross
(If you sing along)
Wonder where you cross
(If you sing along)
If I scream
While they're washing their sins
(And we sing along)
She sings, I do evil things
I need, I strive
(And we sing along)
I bleed alive
(And we sing along)
(And we sing along)
(And we sing along)
(And we sing along)

In my car to where you are
I won't make it
I can't make it
In my car to where you are
I can't make it
I won't make

In my car to where you are
I won't make it
In
