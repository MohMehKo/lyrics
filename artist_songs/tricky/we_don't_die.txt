[Francesca & Tricky:]
We don't, we don't
We don't die
We don't, we don't
We don't die

Far we go, away somewhere
Where we go, away don't know
Times not mine, we meet sometime
You rest in peace, your soul release

We don't, we don't
We don't die
We don't, we don't
We don't die

You won't dance alone, alone with me
Rest your head, enough's been read
Fly you fly, you're home, you're home
You swim in moon, you left too soon

We don't, we don't
We don't die
We don't, we don't
We don't die...
