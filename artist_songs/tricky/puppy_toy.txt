Again, we go 'round and round
I'll get the drinks
I guess, it's always my round

Can you get me that drink?
Friends, girls, they come and go
You think you're nice
But trends remain in constant flow, see, she

Got any cash
She likes that money boy
And she, she's needs a puppy toy

You stare, you stare and look confused
Your fruit is slightly bruised
You wear but don't like men, no
Won't love, won't care again

You stare and look confused
Your fruit is slightly bruised
You wear but don't like men, no
Won't love, won't care again

Girl, you got a vicious tongue
You're talking to me
Yeah, I wish, wish you'd cough up a lung
Girl, you seem insecure

Well, you're an idiot
Look at me , you think you're pure
Girl, get your head right
There's nothing wrong with me in it?
You, yeah, you should get it right

You stare, you stare and look confused
Your fruit is slightly bruised
You wear but don't like men, no
Won't love, won't care again

You stare and look confused
Your fruit is slightly bruised
You wear but don't like men, no
Won't love, won't care again

Again, we go round and round
I'll get the drinks
It's always my round

You stare, you stare and look confused
Your fruit is slightly bruised
You wear but don't like men, no
Won't love, won't care again

You stare and look confused
Your fruit is slightly bruised
You wear but don't like men, no
Won't love, won't care again

Oh, no, no, no, no, no
Won't love, won't care again
Won't love, won't care
Won't love, won't care

Won't love, won't care again
Won't love, won't care again
Won't love, won't care again

Now, piss off
