Don't wanna stay
Don't wanna stay

I don't really care or share with you
I would rather walk alone
I'm forgetting where I was
I don't really think it's fair of you
I would rather stay at home
I'm forgetting just because

Don't wanna stay or
Lay with you
Don't want another day
Day with you
Don't wanna stay

No, don't try to manipulate
I would rather take control
I'm knowing where I was
Don't you ever try to feel my hate
I would rather feel nothing
I know we're losing love

Don't wanna stay or
Lay with you
Don't want another day
Day with you
Don't wanna stay or
Lay with you
Don't want another day
Another day with you
Don't wanna stay

I don't really care or share with you
I would rather walk alone
I'm forgetting where I was
I don't really think it's fair of you
I would rather stay at home
I'm forgetting just because

Don't wanna stay

Don't wanna stay with you
Don't wanna stay with you
Don't want another day

Don't wanna stay or
Lay with you
Don't want another day
Day with you
Don't wanna stay or
Lay with you
Don't want another day
Day with you

Don't wanna stay or
Lay with you
Don't want another day
Day with you
Don't wanna stay or
Lay with you
Don't want another day
Day with you

Don't wanna stay or
Lay with you
Don't want another day
Day with you
Don't wanna stay or
Lay with you
Don't want another day
Day with you

Don't wanna stay
Another day with you

I'd rather walk alone
I walk alone, walk alone
I walk alone
I'd rather walk alone
I walk alone
