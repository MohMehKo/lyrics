You excite
You excite me
You excite
You excite me

You excite me, maybe you might be
Am I the first one not likely
You will, you won't just like me
I'm so phoney, I'm lonely

I take too much, I taste your touch
I'm automatic there's no clutch

C'mon baby, baby c'mon
C'mon baby, baby c'mon
C'mon baby, baby c'mon
C'mon baby, baby c'mon

I think you do but you don't care
I think you will but you won't share
I'm shaking, baby, I'm shaking
Is this for love that we're making

I won't rehearse, you're in my verse
You're in my song 'cause you're so strong

C'mon baby, baby c'mon
C'mon baby, baby c'mon
C'mon baby, baby c'mon
C'mon baby, baby c'mon

C'mon baby, baby c'mon
C'mon baby, baby c'mon
C'mon baby, baby c'mon
C'mon baby, baby c'mon

Hey love, how've you been love
It's a long time since I've seen love
Are you caring for him, love
He's good for you, love
How've you been, love
How've you been, love

I remember when we met, love
We sat in the dark, love
We sat just apart, love
But not for long, love
We grew real strong, love
Real strong, love
You caring for him, love
He's good for you, love

C'mon baby, baby c'mon
C'mon baby, baby c'mon
C'mon baby, baby c'mon
C'mon baby, baby c'mon

C'mon baby, baby c'mon
C'mon baby, baby c'mon
C'mon baby, baby c'mon
C'mon baby, baby c'mon

Baby c'mon
Baby c'mon
Baby c'mon
Baby c'mon
