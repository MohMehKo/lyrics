I don't want to be told what to do
So fuck I hate, it's opinions and fuckin' views
I don't fuck with you, I'ma do what I do
I do shit and if they spit, I cannot do
And I'm gettin' 'em mad to get wilder now
Heads will crack when the guitar smash
Fence on my back when the crowd react
They get high off their fixes and loving that
I'm loving cash, rugged trash, rock and roll all over the gap
Dr. Martens and a bomber jacket on my back
They're barely in one part, you know where I'm at
'Cause me - I get down like that
Choke the feelings, I'm a heartattack
I'm back - you wanna be part of that
I'm nothin' but a motherfuckin' maniac

[Tricky:]
Why don't you
Why don't you
Why don't you go and get fucked
Why don't you
Why don't you
Why don't you go and get fucked

[Bella Gotti:]
I don't want to be shown how to live
You are gonna find me with a tribalist
I say shit I like, I'm an arsonist
If you ain't feelin' it, then give my ass a kiss
And I'll make you sick, I go nuts for shit
Fuckin' up the bass and drum in this
I'm a leader, bitch, so let me lead a bitch
Here's to the poor comin' for the rich
'Cause I'm loving cash, I'm a gutter lass
Party animal until I'm dead tonight
Me - I give you cardiac
Give me what I want, don't play, I'm tainted now
'Cause me - I'm a prompt inmate
Smash this place like a broken plate
I'm sick - you wanna be part of this
I'm an English black girl herbalist

[Tricky:]
Why don't you
Why don't you
Why don't you go and get fucked
Why don't you
Why don't you
Why don't you go and get fucked

Why don't you go and get fucked
Actin' like you can get touched
You disagree - you don't see much
You're like a chick, when she's like three months
You want a free lunch - pussy boy, go crunch
Lies twists and bends, it usually ends
So why don't you go and get fucked
Why don't you go and get fucked

Go and get fucked
Go and get fucked
Go and get fucked
Go and get fucked

[Bella Gotti:]
I don't want to be told what to say
There's enough I'm gonna say whatever's on my brain
I don't play any games, better stay in your lane
When I bust away, don't remember my name
And I'm gettin' to Rome 'cause they love my snow
Give me an English motherfucker and I’ll take ‘em all
I’m a crazy child with no score too small
We around in the hood, the police will speed dial
I’m lovin’ this, I take a piss
I can piano with two fingers, bitch
And two big guns, so the menace is rich
Aim, fire, will not miss
‘Cause you - you wanna live like this
You wanna break all the rules and start some shit
I’m sick - you wanna be just like me
You wanna break all the laws
I’m not meant to breed

[Tricky:]
Why don't you
Why don't you
Why don't you go and get fucked
Why don't you
Why don't you
Why don't you go and get fucked
