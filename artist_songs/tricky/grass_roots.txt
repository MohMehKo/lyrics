[Tricky:]
Here we go again so tricky going flow again
Those chicken cluckers is fakin' pumpin' others
Others breed to sons and deform carnage
Disorder and you know we be bionic,
Skeezers make me paranoid smokin' hydroponic,
Shutting down one half of my brain, paralyzes one side of my body,
Now in need of a walk-in chain of McDonald's,
For those chicken cluckers whose fakin' pumpin' others,
Here we go again you know we know the flow again
Here we go again you know we know the flow again
Here we go again you know we know the flow again

[Roberto Malary Jr.:]
It's the one-two-three on your mark get set go
I'm gonna show you how to flow 
So take notes from a pro
Original is what best describes me I'm rough like
Football or hockey so don't try to stop me
'Cause when I'm on the roll I'm rollin' up with the crew
Rollin' up, filling blunts and gettin' drunk off the brews,
Showin' mad skills like the Shaolin temple, 
Not Kung-Fu but kickin' styles from my mental,

My brain is overflowin' with words and phrases,
And titles and concepts on how to catch wreck, ha! 
I take my rhymes and my beats,make sure they fit perfect,
Like a glove so it can sound lovely but ah yeah I gotcha open, 
I know I gotcha open like the weed that your smokin'
Once you start chokin'-you're provokin',
Me to blow your rhymes out the frame so when a sucka's walkin' funny, ha!, 
You know that I'm to blame because a slap is whatcha get,
I suppose more than a broken nose you catch about five toes.
