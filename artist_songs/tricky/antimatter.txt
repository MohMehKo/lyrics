I'm antimatter, I don't matter
Cancer phones, break my bones
I'm illusion, sonic solution
Magic mind, sonic pollution

I just detox
I just see lots
I see nothing
Show me something

We go round and round
We make it safe and sound
I try to break it down
Alright

We go round and round
We make it safe and sound
I try to break it down
Alright

I have visions, homo sapiens
Fast I've grown, I think alone
I'm confusion, evolution
I'm in man club institution

I move forward
I make awkward
I just jump, jump
I just thump, thump

We go round and round
We make it safe and sound
I try to break it down
Alright

We go round and round
We make it safe and sound
I try to break it down
Alright

I evolve
Then dissolve
Maintain my laws
'Til April falls

My sea runs red
My trees are dead
My breath runs short
Please report

Is there someone out there?
Is there someone out there?
Do you receive me?
Do you receive me?

We go round and round
We make it safe and sound
I try to break it down
Alright

We go round and round
We make it safe and sound
I try to break it down
Alright

We go round and round
We make it safe and sound
I try to break it down
Alright

We go round and round
We make it safe and sound
I try to break it down
Alright
