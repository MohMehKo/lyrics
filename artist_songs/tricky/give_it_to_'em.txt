Bad man give it to them anywhere
From a badness them go program, them better prepare
I'm the Hawk with the eagle we no have no fear
Them no have, so read ma lips or pull up a chair

Stress for free
They wanna stretch to see
They wanna see the dark
They wanna leave a mark
Don't wanna hear them scream
I wanna lie in my wet dream
Don't wanna go too far
Don't wanna drive my car
Don't wanna die too soon
So I like people to provide with room
Don't wanna move too quick
You won't suck my
Don't wanna see strip bars
Don't wanna live in cars
You love to live in large
Live in credit cards
I'd like to talk and walk
I'd like to move, walk
