[Stephanie Cooke:]
You go live with yourself
I'll go live with myself
And it is me who has to live
With my self

Do you get an erection
When you look at your own reflection?
Try to analyze what you don't understand
I play the devil and I play Christ
Cross dress and run with the rest
To the believers
They have no belief
They have no belief
I am the king's mighty
Oh, oh yeah, oh yeah

God forgive me,
God defend me yeah,

But instead of this oh,
He just bends me.

On the rhythm with your mind
My mind is out of shape and my body's out of style
Throw me in the Nile
Like the kid in "Microphone"
You know, the one who can't leave his style alone

You go live with yourself
I'll go live with myself
But it is me who has to live
With myself.

You go live with yourself
I'll go live with myself
But it is me who has to live
With myself.
