I realize
There's no compromise
Through lying eyes
My love for

Just wasn't there
Even though I care
Did I hurt you bad
Did I make you sad

I know I paid
That's why I'm alone today
Just me, myself
No mental health

My mistake
Overtakes
Your love's overgrown
My love

My love, my love
My love for you
My love, my love
My love for you

Now I wonder why
Until we die
And then
Upon your praise

Hope Jesus come
To kill the one
I feel again
I love you then

Oceans of time
I've crossed to find
I found you
I will find you

But it's not my time
My time to take
For Mina's sake
My lover's soul

My love, my love
My love for you
My love, my love
My love for you

'Til it burns my soul
Burns my soul
Burns a hole

My love, my love
My love for you
My love, my love
My love for you
