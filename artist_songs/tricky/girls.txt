Girls, boys
Girls, boys

Girls, wish you never had boys
They grow up to be bad boys
Cry, I've never had boys
Never seen your dad, boy

I've never seen my dad, boy
Without the Roy
And when my career stops kicking
I'm gonna stick him

Rock-a-dub, now let me show you where it's at, boy
Just a puppet and you grew into a fat boy
Make a dog and you chase another cat, boy
Blow it up and let me show you where it's at, boy

Girls, wish you never had boys
They grow up to be bad boys
Cry, never had boys
Never seen your dad, boy

I've never seen my dad, boy
Without the Roy
When my career stops kicking
I'm gonna stick him

Staring through the sun, tell your devil beware
I am not the son of your family affair (Jamaica's skirts and blouses)
Baby breaks away and I've got my face in my hand
Genetics from my gun, trust me I don't care (I don't need no man)

Little boys

Rappa rousers, bappa bousers
Shake it for me, baby, let me step into your trousers
I allow this
Come on, baby, let me take to the houses
I allow this
This is now and you better bow this
This is now and you better bow this
This is now and you better bow this

Staring through the sun, tell your devil beware (Jamaica's skirts and blouses)
I am not the son of your family affair (He didn't rob his houses)
Baby breaks away and I've got my face in my hand (Fuck the biological)
Genetics from my gun, trust me, I don't care (I don't need no man)

I'm not a firestarter
'Cause I'm a little smarter
I'm not a firestarter
'Cause I'm a little smarter
Smarter than the average bear
I don't care family's there
Say I don't care
Family's there

Rock-a-dub, now let me show you where it's at, boy
Just a puppet and you grew into a fat boy
Make a dog and you chase another cat, boy
Blow it up and let me show you where it's at, boy

Staring through the sun tell your devil beware (Jamaica's skirts and blouses)
I am not the son of your family affair (He didn't rob his houses)
Baby breaks away and I've got my face in my hand (Fuck the biological)
Genetics from my gun, trust me I don't care (I don't need no man)

I don't care
Jamaica's skirts and blouses
I don't care
He didn't rob his houses
I don't care
I'm not a firestarter
I don't care
'Cause I'm a little smarter

Staring through the sun tell your devil beware
I am not the son of your family affair (He didn't rob his houses)
