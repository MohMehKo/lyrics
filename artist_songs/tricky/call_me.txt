I'm calling you
I'm calling you now
And I won't wait
And I won't change now
Or rearrange
It might get strange now
It might get strange now
Just fallin' free
Just fall in me
And I'm your coffin
And I'm your coffin
For endless sleep now
For endless sleep now
Little sunbeam
I hear you scream
I feel your heat now
I feel your heat now
Here's to one we sleep now
I hear trees scream
Ain't the people mean?
What do they mean?
It's time to sleep now
It's time to go now

I wait for you, I wait for you
I wait for you, I wait for you
I wait for you

Little sunbeam
I can hear you scream
I can feel your heat now
I can feel your heat now
Here's to one we sleep now
I hear trees scream
Ain't the people mean?
What do they mean?
It's time to sleep now
It's time to go now

I wait for you, I wait for you
I wait for you, I hate for you
I wait for you, I hate for you
I wait for you, I hate for you
I wait for you, I hate for you
I wait for you, I hate for you
I wait for you, I hate for you
Hate for you, I wait for you
I wait for you, I wait for you
I hate for you, I hate for you
Hate for you
I hate for you

I can feel your heat now
It's time to go now
