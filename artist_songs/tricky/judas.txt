Is simplicity best
Or simply the easiest?
The narrowest path
Is always the holiest
So walk on bare feet for me
Suffer some misery
If you want my love
If you want my love

Man will survive
The harshest conditions
And stay alive
Through difficult conditions
So make up your mind for me
Walk the line for me
If you want my love
If you want my love

Idle talk and
Idle promises
Cheating Judases
And doubting Thomases
Don't just stand there and shout it
Do something about it

You can fulfill
Your wildest ambitions
And I'm sure you will
Lose your inhibitions
So open yourselves for me
Risk your health for me
If you want my love
If you want my love
If you want my love
If you want my love
