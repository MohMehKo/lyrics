I feel you changin' me, changin' me
I can see them changin' me
I can see them changin' me
Ah, changin' me

Wanna take my clothes off
Tear my mouth and nose off
Take out my eyes
Take out my eyes

Wanna take my clothes off
Tear my mouth and nose off
Tear out my eyes
Tear out my eyes

I wanna walk on warm leaves
Hot sand, cold breeze
Hot sun, I want my mum, look mum
I'm on top of the world
World wide plaza

I got asthma
I wanna demonstrate hate
I wanna rattle
I wanna blow my head off in Seattle
No way, no way check it
No way

I can see a change in me, ah, change in me
And I, change in me
I, I, I, I deserve to die because of lies
It's crazy lies
Ahm, we have to die because of lies

Wanna take my clothes off
Tear my mouth and nose off
Take out my eyes
Take out my eyes
