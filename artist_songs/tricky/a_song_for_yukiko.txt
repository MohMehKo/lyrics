So if you would put a dress on
Unless you put the stress on
Tuck your hair behind your ears
Your tears, your silly fears

I'd be your teddy bear
You'd choose the clothes I wear
For you I'd suffer much pain
Sharp glass, migraine

For you I'd put a stress on
For you I'd put a dress on
For you I'd lose my focus
I'd swim in swarms of locusts

For you I'd swim with ease
Save the planet, leave the trees
For you I'd put a dress on
A dress to impress on
