Search, search, survive
Say you're lucky alive
You could be Aaliyah
The grass is usually greener
The life is usually meaner
I'm like Ike
I die for
I'd rather be released
Than controlled by the beast
It's not my fault
You're not a writer
Emotional exciter
You're not a writer
Emotional exciter
You're nobody
I do this for a hobby
The editor of Face
We'll edit this place
Exit without a trace
After we edit your face
You know I come in peace
Until the tension is released
You know I come in peace
Until the tension is released

Search, search, survive (cerchi e sopravvivi)
Say you're lucky alive (fortunato e vivo)
You could be Aaliyah (o forse Aaliyah)
The grass is usually greener (l'erba e' gia' piu' verde)
The life is usually meaner (ma la vita e' piu' meschina)
I'm like Ike (io sono come Ike)
I die for (e muoio per)
I'd rather be released (preferisco liberato)
Than controlled by the beast (che da una bestia dominato)
It's not my fault (non e' colpa mia)
You're not a writer (tu non sei uno scrittore no)
Emotional exciter (commovente ed eccitante)
You're nobody (tu sei nessuno)
I do this for a hobby (lo faccio per gioco)
The editor of Face (il direttore di Face)
We'll edit this place (sta bene in questo posto)
Exit without a trace (esce senza traccia)
After we edit your face (curiamo la sua faccia)
You know I come in peace (lo sai vengo in pace)
Until the tension is released (la tensione sale)
You know I come in peace (lo sai vengo in pace)
Until the tension is released (la tensione sale)
