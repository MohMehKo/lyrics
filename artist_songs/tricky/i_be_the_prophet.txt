I can't relax, I need to meditate
Yeah, I'll make 'em wait
I can't relax, I need to meditate
Yeah, I'll make 'em wait

Time moves in numbers
I count the summers
Direct the drummers

I can't relax, I need to meditate
Yeah, I'll make 'em wait

Time moves in numbers
I count the summers
Direct the drummers

Tell me you don't feel nothing
Would you like to ride on my train
Or would you like to drink from my vein?
My vibe's just a fuckin' feeling
I see the ceiling
And adjust to such a feeling
I be the prophet
Slay me, then we'll cross it

I'm ready on the other side
I'm ready on the other side
I'm ready on the other side
I'm ready on the other side

I can't relax
I need to meditate
I'll make them wait

Time moves in numbers
I count the summers
Direct the drummers

Would you like to ride on my train
Or would you like to drink from my vein?
My vibe's just a feeling
I see the ceiling
And adjust to such a feeling
I be the prophet
Slay me, then we'll cross it

I'm ready on the other side
I'm ready on the other side
I'm ready on the other side

I can't relax, I need to meditate
Yeah, I'll make 'em wait

Time moves in numbers
I count the summers
Direct the drummers

Tell me you don't feel nothing
Would you like to ride on my train
Or would you like to drink from my vein?
My vibe's just a feeling
I see the ceiling
And adjust to such a feeling
I be the prophet
Slay me, then we'll cross it

I'm ready on the other side
I'm ready on the other side
I'm ready on the other side
