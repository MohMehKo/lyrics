[Tricky:]
Come on, Lonnie
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

I'm Lonnie Listen
Not what I was christened
For sure, man
Check me on my tour, man
For sure, man
I'm Lonnie Friend Me
Why don't you befriend me on Facebook

I'm lonely lately
She tries to make me
Keep steel, man
Be real, man
A real plan
Got real fam
Like true crime

[Francesca & Tricky:]
Exercise everyday and I'm still not fit
My kids are hungry and I ain't got shit
What I'm gonna do
What I'm gonna do
What I'm gonna do
What would you do

Exercise everyday and I'm still not fit
My kids are hungry and I ain't got shit
What I'm gonna do
What I'm gonna do
What I'm gonna do
What would you do

[Mykki Blanco:]
I hit the block Sherlock, they ain't got a clue
Damn Trick, they callin' me a little You
Now I ain't give a fuck yet what them labels do
Nigga take them fables to the stables 'cause they're racin' you
Know they're takin' you for everything you got
Every single verse, a slot machine stops
They got your DNA and they the dollars
Livin' on the leash that's a contract to collar, holler

[Francesca & Tricky:]
Exercise everyday and I'm still not fit
My kids are hungry and I ain't got shit
What I'm gonna do
What I'm gonna do
What I'm gonna do
What would you do

Exercise everyday and I'm still not fit
My kids are hungry and I ain't got shit
What I'm gonna do
What I'm gonna do
What I'm gonna do
What would you do

[Tricky:]
I'm Ronnie Reckless
I take away your necklace
For real, man
Keep steel, man
For real, man, you're too fucking chingy
Give me money - send me

I'm like religion
Wait for my decision
Are they real, man
No, they're just pop stars driving in their cop cars
For real, man
For real, man

[Francesca & Tricky:]
Exercise everyday and I'm still not fit
My kids are hungry and I ain't got shit
What I'm gonna do
What I'm gonna do
What I'm gonna do
What would you do

Exercise everyday and I'm still not fit
My kids are hungry and I ain't got shit
What I'm gonna do
What I'm gonna do
What I'm gonna do
What would you do
