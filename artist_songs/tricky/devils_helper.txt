[Tricky and Laveda Davis:]
So what you gonna do?
It's me that's haunting you
It's me you'll have to face
On judgment day
Are you gonna give release
I'll never let you rest in peace
Lookin forward to the end
It's better we die friends
Have to cleanse my soul
Straight away your god
I can't wait until you die
I can't wait to meet you there
Organize the pain
Come ride on as the train
Organize the colors
The sweetest,there's the others
On judgment day
Can't wait to meet you there
You lie and so do I
You lie and so do I

On judgment day

So what you gonna do?
It's me that's haunting you
It's me you'll have to face
On judgment day
Are you gonna give release
I'll never let you rest in peace
Lookin' forward to the end
It's better we die friends
Have to cleanse my soul
Straight away your god
I can't wait until you die
I can't wait to meet you there
Organize the hate
Let's ride on as the train
Organize the colors
The sweetest,there's the others
Judgment day, this judgment day
You lie and so do I
You lie and so do I
