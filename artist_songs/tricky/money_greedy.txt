Trample on my
Trample on my soul
(Kill me with a quickness)
Trample on my soul
(Kill me with a quickness)
Trample on my soul

Money greedy, money greedy
I trust you over all
The way you brake my heart
The way you trample on my soul

Kill me with a quickness
Kill me with a quickness

Money greedy
I trust you over all
Money greedy
I trust you over all
You trample on my soul
You trample on my soul
You trample on my soul

Tricola ola
Donde este bien je t'aime
I be dead when I'm strong
Tricola ola
Donde este bien je t'aime je tombe
I be dead when I'm strong

In love I fall
It's a crime how I crawl
Oh my lover
Don't you know that it's alright
You can love
You can love me the same time
I grin and bear it
I grin and bear it
You can't compare it

Marathons of comparisons
The T R I C K Y
You can't get close
Brag when I boast
What have I got to boast about

Ghetto traps didn't trap me, I got out
Security social
Standing in government lines
Standing in government lines
I'm standing in government lines
I take what's mines
I take what's mines
We know

Money greedy
I love you over all
Money greedy
You trample on my soul
You trample on my soul
You trample on my soul

Kill me with a quickness
(Money greedy)
I guess it's strictly business
You kill me with a quickness
I guess it's strictly business

Remember we used to sit in the Brits
Never won any awards
That's not what we used to look towards
Money greedy
Tricola ola
Donde este bien je t'aime je tombe
Comparison
(Trample on my soul)
Marathon
Comparison
Can't get close
Brag when I boast

What have I got to boast about
Ghetto traps didn't trap me I got out
Standing in government lines
Standing in government lines
I take what's mines
Money greedy
I trust you over all
Money greedy
Didn't trap me I got out
Ghetto traps didn't trap me I got out
Standing in government lines
I take what's mines

Darola bola
Tricola ola
I love you over all
You trample on my soul

I trust you over all
I trust you over all
Never come back
From the powers of desire
Yeah we know how you do
I can see through you
I can't meet the expectations
Of these radio stations
'Cause I move in with different vibrations
With different vibrations
Different vibrations, different vibrations
You kill me

False autograph
First my body
Now my corpse
