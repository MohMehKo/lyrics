Hey love how you been love
Long time since I've seen love
Hey love how you been love
Long time since I've seen love
Hey love how you been love
Long time since I've seen love

Remember when, when we met love
Sat in in the park love
Sat just just apart love
But not not for long love
Sat apart not for long love
We grew real strong love
Sat in the park just long love
Just long love

Leave me alone you'll be alright
Oh be a man don't take it light
Leave me alone you'll be alright
Oh be a man don't take it light

Leave me alone you'll be alright
Oh be a man don't take it light
Leave me alone you'll be alright
Oh be a man don't take it light
