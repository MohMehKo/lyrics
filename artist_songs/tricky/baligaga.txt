Dem bwoy, dey a TV gangsta
Coulda neva wanna see my anger
Can you relate, it's too late

If a bwoy think this a na go round ting
Control him, that a just mounting
So far bad man sling with a right and squeeze
Any time, any night, when we live and drunk
Inna fire we no jump outta fry pan
Pon our honor, so no war we nah shy from
This eagle inna sky, it a flies 'pon
Give me a reason or ya ready to go fight 'pon
Dough it make me blaze dem thoughts
Shaking when ya hear dis mouth
Mi gangsta wheneva we blazin South
Rude bwoy only faking thoughts

So you a gangsta, you nah real or like
Equatorian gangsta, you neva see a Crenshaw
So you take life, we take no response
Dem rule dem guerilla save inna Bronx
So you run streets from some love to six
Jamaican gangsta woulda row fi see dis
So you love war and ya love preaching
Dem an Indian cubs, dem nah know 'bout my menace
