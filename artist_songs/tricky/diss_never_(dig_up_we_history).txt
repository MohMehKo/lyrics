[Hawkman] 
A yes a little boy come try and diss way  
I must say one little different and case  
And with so little force right now try and come diss way  
A marathon a go put it to waste  
Them want no more  
They shoulda dig up we history  
Cause war them live them shoulda know it no safe  
Examine da body in da unsolved mystery 
It just a phone call close the case

But when them missing  
Them can hold bad man responsible  
But a true that a bad man job is invincible  
But a when them missing them can hold marathon responsible  
But a true that a bad man job is invincible  

But after me da pan me corner chill  
Here so little boy a injured and killed  
They must want issued and feel well  
Well so little boy don't even have no will  
Unfortunately we take care of them bill  
Then never have a find them information skill  
Now no batty boy find that ill  

But when them missing  
Them can hold bad man responsible  
But a true that a bad man job is invincible  
But a when them missing them can hold marathon responsible  
But a true that a bad man job is invincible
