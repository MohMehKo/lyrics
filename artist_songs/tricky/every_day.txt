I am nothing, I move through walls
I'll make thunder when the night calls

I'm full moon and earth rotates
I am Adam and Eve she waits

I'll forsake, I'm the bird that flies
On low tides and sunrise

I am playing in a friendly sky
I fly on wings and the promise it brings

I am hope on a loose end rope
I'm alive, found dead, I'm your last breath

I'm season, I'm reason, I'm why you should end
You hate me you love me, I'm your best friend

I'm earthquake (and TV), the fish that swims free
Straight to your plate, you can eat me

I'm every day, I'm every day, I'm every day
I'm every day, I'm every day, I'm every day
I'm every day, I'm every day, I'm every day
I'm every day, I'm every day, I'm every day
