Can't seem to find my steps at all
I'm walking
Can't find the words I need to say
Talking
I run around inside my head
Alright
I run around to sound and step
Alright

Can't seem to find my steps at all
I'm walking
Can't find the words I need to say
Talking
I run around inside my head
Alright
I run around to sound and step
Alright

So I'm running in this space
Lose my sights and leave my taste
Evil come and evil go
Evil come and evil go

So I'm running in this space
Lose my sights and leave my taste
Evil come and evil go
Evil come and evil go

Can't seem to find my way home
I'm calling
No voice, it's just a dialing tone
I'm falling
I'm walking around just like they think
Alright
They say the worst TV is dead
Alright

Can't seem to find my way home
I'm calling
No voice, it's just a dialing tone
I'm falling
I'm walking around just like they think
Alright
They say the worst TV is dead

So I'm running in this space
Lose my sights and leave my taste
Evil come and evil go
Evil come and evil go

So I'm running in this space
Lose my sights and leave my taste
Evil come and evil go
Evil come and evil go

I'm lost and found
I walked on time
I'm lost in sound
I walked in time
I'm lost and found
I walked on time
I'm lost in sound
