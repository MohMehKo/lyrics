In the beamer or a fly mercedes
Gettin' lit up, high on the great weed
I like the girls, I like the ladies
I light my world to drive her crazy

Gettin' lit up, high on the great weed
I like the girls, I like the ladies
I light my world to drive her crazy

In the beamer or a fly mercedes (I like the girls)
Gettin' lit up, high on the great weed (I like the girls)
I like the girls, I like the ladies (I like the girls)
I light my world to drive her crazy (with the real long hair)

Met two girls in a restaurant
Didn't know the hookers was lesbians
'til I got home and started sexin' 'em
The shit they were doing was excellent
Yeah, yeah, the show was perfect
The one with her tits in the other girl's bit
Slim girl was holdin' her hips
Strokin' her tongue all over her clit
This girl was gettin pornographic
Should've had a vid recordin that shit
One girl's tits now taking a big mount
Going down south licking the bitch out
'round 'em and stylin' my dick was shinin'
Next minute the babe is grindin'
Went outside and left 'em windin'
When I came back they was 69in'
All of 'em was crying- she'd screamed
'lick the whipped cream from off of her tits'
See me laying for the queen all this fisting
Reminds me of a dream I had at fifteen
Last time I seen 'em was at the club
It was me two girls and the scrappy love
Back then wanted to be nice enough
But now there's enough for the both of us

Fit like hand in glove and I'm up

Take a shot like the last of the stand drop
Boom boom boom
Check, then feel again
That's the time to pull out the handcuffs
Dials a one on a one minute call
Be gone if I never done the cheap rough
She calls and asks when we can fuck
And who else wants the jungle lay
So she dials a one on a one minute call
Be gone if I never done the cheap rough
Unless she wants a jungle lay
So she calls everyone wonderin' when we can fuck
What does she come to the bar wearin'
'cause when the girls put on the starin'
I love watchin' all this dancin'
By the girls who are as about as luscious acting
Rude girl and her martial firing
'ooh well, get the spot!' they whinin'
Street dog, they caught me rhymin'
Turned around and got fucking blinded
My favorite beds get no shy women
When or wherever to be drivin'
My take come to the face
When I see that beat goes the drum
And the bass is blastin'
Freak if I bone
It's like I lost control
I'm all alone think I'm toppin'
Get high when I drive a car
And try to drink and drive
When I'm private parking
