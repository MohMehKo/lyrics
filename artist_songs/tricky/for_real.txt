You watch too many films
Too many films for real
And something else you take too seriously
Your record deal

A record deal pays bills
Feeds a family
Your profile is too big
How ya gonna be a crime family

Too many films
For real
You watch too many films
For real

Don't get me wrong, I know you got guns
And you're not scared to use them
But is there money bein' made 'round these guns
Or lifes to be losin'

You watch too many films
Films, for real
You watch too many films
Films, for real

Some of those people have to live that life, for real
I don't have to, I got a record deal
For real, you heard
I chill and smoke herb

And how about these sexy singers, sex gods
Talking about hitting girls in a turn
You're fantastic
You're super sperm

Yeah, I'm a player hater
I hate when players can't take their turn
And when a record company drops me
That's when I learn

It's not real, it's just passing time
It's not real, all I do is rhyme
It's not real, it's just passing time
All I do, all I do is rhyme

You heard, you heard
"You go Romeo", girls say
You look tall in the video
And the coloured girl sing

Get money
Get money
Get money
Get money

And no one sings the blues
Everyone sings the greens
Someone said keep your eye on the prize
How you lose the dream

Who am I to say, I know you need cash
In this hundred yard dash
I moved a while ago
And passed through New York

I'll be back in a minute
It's my turn to talk
For real, you heard
For real, you heard

I can grab a mic and wrack it
Make it go posethic
I train my mic
Restrain my mic

You watch too many movies
For real
You watch too many films
For real
You watch too many films
Too many films for real
You watch too many films
For real
