Sanctuary, mandatory
Global crisis, crisis global
Jump the bottle, float far away
Float far away, float far away

Go to cinema, feel like a criminal
[?]
Sanctuary, mandatory
Global crisis, crisis global

Jump the bottle
Floats far away
Floats far away
Floats far away
Jump the bottle
Floats far away
Floats far away
Floats far away

In the cinema, life is minimal
She don't love me like that
She don't love me like that
I try to chose, my shadow moves

But don't last in my hovercraft
Life is minimal
Life is minimal

Jump the bottle
Floats far away
Floats far away
Floats far away
Jump the bottle
Floats far away
Floats far away
Floats far away

We're gonna last
We're gonna last
We're gonna last
We float far away
We float far away
We're gonna last
We float far away
Far way, far away
Float far away
Crisis global, global crisis
Float
We're gonna last, we're gonna last
We're gonna last, we're gonna last
We float far away
We float
We float far away
Float far away
Far away
We float far away
We're gonna last, we're gonna last
We float
We float
We float
Far away
Float
I float
