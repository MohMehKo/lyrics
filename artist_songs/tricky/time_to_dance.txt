You go through into
Jump into the lake
Swim until you wake
Under the ocean
It moves slow motion
Stop the sounds
Kill the noise
Can you feel
Girls and boys

Time to dance [x3]
Time to dance [x3]

When we go free into
Drive in a car
Forget who you are

Only emotion
Only emotion
Clap your hands
Bring your toys
Can you feel
Girls and boys

Time to dance [x3]
Time to dance [x3]

Time to dance [x3]
Time to dance [x3]
