Why the fuck do they keep making those guns?
Chew compassion save some sons
Why'd you keep buying their guns

Foolish, life's too short for stray bullets
Why'd you keep buying their guns foolish
Corporate companies love when they kill themselves
It boost up the record sales

Why'd you keep making your guns?
Chew compassion save some sons
Why'd you keep buying your guns?

Foolish, life's too short for stray bullets
Record companies love when they kill themselves
It boost up the record sales

Now which one of you's gonna be the next niggy
You don't have to worry 'bout them, 2pak holding hands with biggy
I watch where I venture, see, 'cause I don't like this century
I watch where I venture, see, 'cause I don't like this century

Now which one of you's gonna be the next niggy
You don't have to worry 'bout them, 2pak holding hands with biggy
I watch where I venture, see, 'cause I don't like this century
I watch where I venture, see, 'cause I don't like this century

Back up chicks all you got is hips, chicks with hips
I see your hollow way, my baby mamma kick it like Billie holiday
I watch where I venture see 'cause I don't like this century
I watch where I venture see 'cause I don't like this century
