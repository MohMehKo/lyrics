I've been wanting you
For so long, it's a shame
Oh, baby
Every time I hear your name
Oh, the pain
Boy, how it hurts me inside

'Cause every time we meet
We play hide and seek
I'm wondering what I should do
Should I, dear, come up to you
And say, How do you do?
Would you turn me away

You're as much to blame
'Cause I know you feel the same
I can see it in your eyes
But I've got no time to live this love
No, I've got no time to play your silly games
Silly games

Yet, in my mind I say
If he makes his move today
I'll just pretend to be shocked
Oh, baby
It's a tragedy
That you hurt me
We don't even try

You're as much to blame
'Cause I know you feel the same
I can see it in your eyes
But I've got no time to live this love
No, I've got no time to play your silly games
Silly games

Silly games
Silly games (No, don't wanna play)
Silly games (Your silly)

No, I've got no time to play your silly games

No
