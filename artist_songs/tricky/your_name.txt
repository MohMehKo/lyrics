If you like-a-me and I like-a-you
And we like-a-just the same
I'd like-a-say this very day
I'd like-a-change your name

'Cause I love-a-you and love-a-you true
and If you-a love-a-me
One live as two, two live as one
Under the mango tree

If you like-a-me like I like-a-you
And we like-a-both the same
I'd like-a-say this very day
I'd like-a-change your name

'Cause I love-a-you and love-a-you true
And If you-a love-a-me
One live as two, two live as one
Under the mango tree

I'd like-a-say this very day
I'd like-a-change your name

'Cause I love-a-you and love-a-you true
And if you-a love-a-me
One live as two, two live as one
Under the mango tree

'Cause I love-a-you and love-a-you true
And if you-a love-a-me
One live as two, two live as one
Under the mango tree

Under the mango tree
