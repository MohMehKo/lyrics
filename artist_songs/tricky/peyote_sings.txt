Peyote sings

Excuse me, what you looking at?
Aren't you that?
Yes, I am, why?
I've seen you on television
Yeah, I do that stuff, it helps me sell my vision
So you're a prostitute?
I guess so, would you rather I shoot?
What you looking at?
Aren't you that?
Yes, I am, why?
I've seen you on television

Peyote sings

Are you rich, are you wealth?
Why you do this?
I can't do nothing else
To be truthful to you, I don't like your voice
That's ok, neither do I
The only difference between me and you is that I get by
Excuse me, what you looking at?

Peyote sings

Do you think you're a good father to your daughter?
Yeah, and when I'm not I burn in fire and drown in water
Excuse me, what you looking at?
What you looking at?

Peyote sings

When's your new album?
I heard the last one's falling
I don't know, I don't listen to the charts
I listen to the calling
Excuse me, what you looking at?
Excuse me, what you looking at?
What's it feel like being famous?
Feels like a muppet in a puppet show
So why'd you do it?
It's like I said, this is all I know
'Scuse me, what you looking at?

Peyote sings

Excuse me, can I ask you a question?
Why'd you ask so many questions?
I don't know, I guess I need a life
Yeah, Mister Chen says I need a wife
I need a crutch, no not to touch
To lean on
Excuse me, why'd you ask so many questions?
Can I ask you a question?
Why'd you ask so many questions?
I don't know, I guess I need a life
Yeah, Mister Chen says I need a wife
I need a crutch, no not to touch
To lean on
To be strong
Excuse me, what you looking at?
Excuse me, what you looking at?

Peyote sings

Aren't you that?
Yes, I am, why?
I've seen you on television
Yeah, I do that stuff, helps me sell my vision
Do you prostitute?
I guess so, would you rather I shoot?
Can I ask you a question?
Why'd you ask so many questions?
I don't know, I guess I need a life
Yeah, Mister Chen says I need a wife
A crutch, not to lean on
A crutch, not touch, to lean on
What you looking at?
Excuse me, what you looking at?

Peyote sings

What does fame feel like?
It feels like a muppet in a puppet show
So why'd you do it?
Like I said, it's all I know
