Different people
Different ways
Slip through time
Nothing stays
Everybody
I've ever known
Feel their sadness
Now I've grown
Look my best
In new clothes
From my head
To my toes

How would they know
How would they know
Press stop, then go
Just let them know

If I lose my sight
If I lose my fight
You just don't know
If I lose my fame
If I cloak my face
You just don't know
Will I stub my toe
Will I watch them go
You just don't know
Just don't know
Just don't know

How would they know
How would they know
Press stop, then go
Just let them know
