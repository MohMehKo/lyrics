It’s my world
It’s my world

Running, breathing, deceiving
Take and make what you breath in
Know me, show me, hardly
No you can’t A and R me

I pretend I don’t exist, I close my eyes and wish
Taste like liquorice and sound so devilish
Slide across the floor, move a little more
Take a sip and pour, I’ve heard it all before

It’s my world, gonna take it now
Make it now, make it shout
All this green gonna make me mean
Make me dream, make me skim

It’s my world, gonna take it now
Make it now, make it shout
All this green gonna make me mean
Make me dream, make me skim

They say where have you been
What you're leaving in
Clean craw far I could even more
(I'm feeling)
I should have to seesaw
(Kill)

(I offer a 3, 4)
I crawl across the floor
(So you live more)
In the day mix
(So you live more)
They play cheap tricks

I pretend I don’t exist
I close my eyes and wish
My thoughts are devilish
My thoughts are just a wish

It’s my world, gonna take it now
Make it now, make it shout
All this green gonna make me mean
Make me dream make me skim

It’s my world, gonna take it now
Make it now, make it shout
All this green gonna make me mean
Make me dream make me skim

It’s funny how you feel
The eyes in your head
The brain and spine
Releases fluid when you’re dead

Then you start to shed
Turning to something else instead
Something else was said
Someone else’s sunset was red

It’s my world, gonna take it now
Make it now, make it shout
All this green gonna make me mean
Make me dream make me skim

It’s my world, gonna take it now
Make it now, make it shout
All this green gonna make me mean
Make me dream, make me skim

It’s my world
It’s my world
