Without a trace
I move to place
We go thirds on it
I grab my gun
Goes down the sun
Tie up the guard with it
We use that rope
Tie up that dope
Make sure it's tight baby
Tell that girl
Don't you speak
And we'll be gone baby
No need to speak
I'll go weak
If I get 12 on it

I shoulda listened
Oh no, time slow
shoulda listened

Shoulda listened
Oh no, time slow
Shoulda listened

Can't go by train
Or run to Spain
It's like a game
They're on it
We'll beat this game
But just in case
We'll be gone baby
I hear some shots
It must be cops
Let's go baby
A Car crash
I start to blast
They got 5 on me
Shots hit my chest
I'm wearing vest
Shoulda run from it

I shoulda listened
Oh no, time slow
I shoulda listened

I shoulda listened
Oh no, time slow
I shoulda listened

I shoulda listened
Oh no, time slow
I shoulda listened

I shoulda listened
Oh no, time slow
I shoulda listened

Oh no, I shoulda listened
Time slow
Oh no
