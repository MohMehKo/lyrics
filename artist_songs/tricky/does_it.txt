Does it make you feel good?
Make you feel hood?
Can I flow through your veins?
Can you make me feel strange?
Can you fall from the sky?
Will you leave me and die?
Will you come back again?
Will you meet me at time?

Where all the protesters
Show what's inside
This will be a swift decline
I wouldn't be caught in lies
I wouldn't be caught in lies

Will you fight for a cause?
Will you break all the laws?
Will you come back again?
Remember by when
Are you living free?


Does it make you feel good?
Make you feel good

Where all the protesters
Show what's inside
This will be a swift decline
I wouldn't be caught in lies
I wouldn't be caught in lies

Does it make you feel good?
Does it make you feel good?

Where all the protesters
Show what's inside
This will be a swift decline
I wouldn't be caught in lies
I wouldn't be caught in lies
