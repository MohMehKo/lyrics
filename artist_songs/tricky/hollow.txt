Doesn't matter about the time we take
Doesn't matter about the lies we make
Go slow

I think of how you're making me mad
I think of all the love we had
Feel so

Always question never quenching your thirst
Let me die when I lie to you first
I follow

When I'm with you it's from within
I know you can see through my skin
I'm hollow

I need you to feed me once more
I need you like I needed before
I'll grow

I'm floating I'm flying I'm dying
I'm floating I'm flying I'm dying

I said, “You needed like you needed before”
Said, “I didn't know what feeling was for”
Said, “You need me that you meet at five”
You don't show I don't I'm alive
My pulse slow my pulse slow

I'm floating I'm flying I'm dying
I'm floating I'm flying I'm dying

I'm floating I'm flying I'm dying
I'm floating I'm flying I'm dying

I'm floating I'm flying I'm dying
I'm floating I'm flying I'm dying

I'm floating I'm flying I'm dying
I'm floating I'm flying I'm dying
