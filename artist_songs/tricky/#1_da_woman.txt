She's malicous
As some delicious
Supersticious super susupicous
Wonder woman [x4]
You just rewind
And you just be fine
You just be fine
And you just be mine
You just rewind
You just be fine
You just be mine
And you just be mine

[John Frusciante:]
[Chorus:]
You show me everything
You feel me everywhere
You pretend that you care
Do you care?

I fit to fall through time
I knew you weren't mine
I shine light through the sky
One thing I try and try
Capture my world
I'll lose love when I force the flew
Being will never be
Honey remmember me

[Tricky:]
So tuck you hair behind you ears,
Your tears and your silly fears
I'll be your teddy bear
You choose the clothes I wear
For you I'll suffer much pain,
Sharp glass my brain,
For you I lose, lose my focus
For you I swim, swim in locusts

[Chorus]

Everytime I am you
I feel forever changed,
Posing along the beat,
Keeping the chemistry
I way myself right down
Always I never found
I'm raging off so tight,
Feeling low feeling high

[Chorus]

[Tricky:]
Here I remain
She don't know my name
Would she love me
If I had real fame
I feel bad pain
Here come that rain
I don't complain
She's too complex
Tell me your name
Is that your real sex
