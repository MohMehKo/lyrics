I confide to anything
So I have to hide from everything
Everybody wants a piece of me
Rinse the origin and cease to be
Sit back and let it happen
Let us take your time away
I don't understand you
I don't want your time of day
If you're gonna walk, might as well walk your way
Always walk the whole ways
Forget the punk, I pack the funk
I'm gonna take a piece of you
Making money for good health
But first I learn to see myself
But first I learn to see myself
You promised me poems
You promised me poems
You promised me poems

I rue the day that I ever met you
And deeply regret you getting close to me
I cannot wait to deeply neglect you
Deeply forget you, Jesus, believe me
You promised me poems
You might have been my reason for livin'
I gave up ungivin', gave up everything
We were a right pair of believers
A couple of dreamers
So how come you hate me?
You promised me poems
You promised me poems
You promised me poems
Promised me poems

Dreamed of ringing voices
They contemplated choices
Taste like a rare kiss
To heighten my awareness
With all fairness
Greatness, with gratitude
And simply rhymes with attitude
Now do promotion and TV
And ya still can't see we
Down the hill cascade
And keep away the masquerade
Dreamed of ringing voices
You promised me poems
You promised me poems
You promised me poems
You promised me poems
