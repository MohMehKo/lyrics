Dear God, I hope you got the message and
Hope you, you can make it better down here
I don't mean a big reduction in the price of beer
But all the people that you made in your image
See them starving on their feet
'Cause they don't get enough to eat from God

I can't believe in you
I don't believe in you

Dear God, sorry to disturb you but
I feel that I should be heard loud and clear
We all need a big reduction in amount of tears
And all the people that you made in your image
See they're fighting in the street
'Cause they can't make opinions meet 'bout God

I can't believe in you
I don't believe in

Did you make disease (I can't believe)
And the diamond blue
(I don't believe)
Did you make mankind
After we made you (I can't believe)
And the devil too
(I don't believe)
(I can't believe)

Dear God, I don't know if you noticed, but
Your name is along with crooks in this book
And these crazy humans wrote it, you should take a look
And all the people that you made in your image
Still believe in that junk it is
Well, I know there's only you, dear God

I can't believe in
I don't believe in

I won't believe in heaven and hell
No saints, no sinners, no devil as well
No pearly gates, no thorny crown
You're always letting us humans down
The wars you bring, the babes you drown
The lost at sea and never found
And it's the same the whole world 'round
The hurt I see helps you compound
The Father, Son and Holy Ghost
Is just all along its holy us
And if you're up there you'd perceive
That my heart is here upon my sleeves
If there's no such thing as don't believe in
It's you
