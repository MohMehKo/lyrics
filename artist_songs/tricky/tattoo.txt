Colour me
Colour me

When you're sitting all alone
In the middle of the floor
There's something uncontrollable
You sit there watching the door

Colour me
Colour me

Already feel ill
Tattoo you're bad side
Slap your thigh
Slap your calf
Sing your mantra
Leave your walk

Colour me
Colour me

Something fits along my spine
Just givin' lovin' from behind
Fortify my arms
Fortify my arms

Colour me
Colour me
