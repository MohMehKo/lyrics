[Drummer:] One, two, three, four

[Tricky and Cia Berg:]
I wanna give birth to your baby, baby
Scream all night long
Exercise our breathing so they hear it in Vietcong
Untangle my umbilical
There's no need to be political
Let's not get too serious
Just try to stay predictable
Cos I....

[All:]
I can't help that I think you're really kickin'
I can't help that I think you're really kickin'
I can't help that I think you're really kickin'
I can't help..
I think you're really...
I think you're really... 
Kickin'

[Tricky and Cia Berg:]
I met you on a Tuesday
Or maybe was it Wednesday

You befriended me, defended me
Shortly after you offended me
I asked you "What's your name?"
I looked at you the same
If there a possibility
That you could take on my fertility

[All:]
I can't help that I think you're really kickin'
I can't help that I think you're really kickin'
I can't help that I think you're really kickin'
I can't help..
I think you're really...
I think you're really...
Kickin'

[Tricky:]
Can't you feel that my climax isn't topical
My physical biological isn't logical
It's astronomical

[All:] I can't help that I think you're really kickin'
