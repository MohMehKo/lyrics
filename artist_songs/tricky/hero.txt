Where she goes
Nobody knows
She likes to shop
And buy clothes
Too many shoes
Too many rolls
Summer dress with nice pink toes
I should've known
She said she pro
She wants a hero
Like a Euro
By the hour playing power maybe zero

[Hook - Tricky + Ann Dao:]
I'll be your hero
I'lI be your superman
I'll be your hero
I'lI be your superman
I'll be your hero
I'lI be your superman
I'll be your hero
I'lI be your superman

What she wants nobody knows
How she feels in those real tight clothes
But she's a loner
[?] berry coma
She's kinda sour likes to power like [?]
She asked my name and what's my game
I said a hustle, she like Russell
By the hour playing power using muscle

[Hook - Tricky + Ann Dao:]
I'll be your hero
I'lI be your superman
I'll be your hero
I'lI be your superman
I'll be your hero
I'lI be your superman
I'll be your hero
I'lI be your superman

I'll be your superman
I'll be your superman

[Hook - Tricky + Ann Dao:]
I'll be your hero
I'lI be your superman
I'll be your hero
I'lI be your superman
I'll be your hero
I'lI be your superman
I'll be your hero
I'lI be your superman
