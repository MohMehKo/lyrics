They want to see me cry
I would rather fly
I'm swimming in my grease
Angel, touch my face

She leads me by my hand
To castles in the sand
Suffocating from concrete
She I like to meet

I have to leave to look
I had to take a took
I have to feel alone
I have to change my tone

I begin to wash my sins
I'm tryin', my life begins

I sit up, I stand down
I sit up, I spin around
I sit up, I stand down
I sit up, I spin around

I sit up, I stand down
I sit up, I spin around
I sit up, I stand down
I sit up, I spin around

I should lose my friends
And I forget these bells
I'll spend time with me
And take the time to see

I learn about myself
Crowded since my twelve
This mother said I'm special
On my starship vessel

She left me now, she's gone
She gives to give a song

She gives to give
She gives to give a song
