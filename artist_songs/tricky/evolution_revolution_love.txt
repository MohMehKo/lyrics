Now that you got it right
Bring love and it'll make it alright
Bring love and we'll take it tonight
Now that you got it right

Who wants the sinner
Coming round for dinner
Who needs effects
Who needs to pay for sex
When they drop the bomb
Who will stay calm
Blood would spill
Who would you kill

Now that I understand this right
Let me take it to the mic
This revolution
Has just begun

Now that I understand this right
Let me take it to the mic
This revolution
Has just begun

Walking down the street with my little rude gun
Top of my gun pocket for fun
Block on my tongue
Top of my earth
Tip of my birth
Top of my earth
Tip of my breast
Top of my chest
Tip of my guess
I've got the singles
I got the jingles
Bet you eat pringles with chris kringles
Walking on the road with my little rude gun

Now that I understand this right
Let me take it to the mic
This revolution
Has just begun

Now that I understand this right
Let me take it to the mic
This revolution
Has just begun

Stepping on the street with my little rude girl
Tip of my toes, top of my world
Top of my world, top of my earth
Top of my rock, tip of my block

Now that you got it right
Bring love and I'll make it alright
Bring love and we'll take it tonight
Now that you got it right

Now that I understand this right
Let me take it to the mic
This revolution
Has just begun

She was born in the ghetto
Outside the Bronx
In a project blocks
Where time stands still
It don't tick it don't tock
Top of my sun
Keep all my love
Top of my chest
Tip of my breast
Top of my earth
Walking on the road
With my soul in my hand
Tip on my toes
Top of my span

Now that I understand this right
Let me take it to the mic
This revolution
Has just begun

Now that I understand this right
Let me take it to the mic
This revolution
Has just begun
Just begun
Just begun
Just begun, yeah, yeah

Now that I understand this right
Let me take it to the mic
This revolution
Has just begun

Now that I understand this right
Let me take it to the mic
This revolution
Has just begun
Just begun
