Dance with dark hearts
And big stars
Nicotine love
I'll kick you to the tar
I'm river running far
I drive you to the stars
And we fall from above
You feel when I sing
'Cause I bring love
'Cause I bring love
Nicotine love

And when you speak out they shoot you down
Where are all the good men they're not around

You can walk hard
And talk fast
Take it too far
I'm clicking to the bar
You can jump in your car
You won't get very far
They don't need to be near
They can see where you are
I bring love

And when you speak out they shoot you down
Where are all the good men they're not around
