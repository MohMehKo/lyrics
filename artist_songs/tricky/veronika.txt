If I had been on your mind on that day
Holding on to your thoughts, to your mind that way
You could've never jumped down in those arms
You could've never left my heart cold

If I had been on your mind on that day
Holding on to your thoughts, to your mind that way
You could've never jumped down in those arms
You could've never left my heart cold

Dead guilty, not here, there's no mercy for you, I stint
Burning your image, your lies and your hints, you're dead
I'm building a prayer for the memories I can't stand

Your life doesn't bother me now
I'm discharged, I kill yourself just to feel good
And make my life better without your trace
You're dead, buried under this ground

If I had been on your mind on that day
Holding on to your thoughts, to your mind that way
You could've never jumped down in those arms
You could've never left my heart cold

If I had been on your mind on that day
Holding on to your thoughts, to your mind that way
You could've never jumped down in those arms
You could've never left my heart cold

Damned, but I feel the shame of the cheap life, for this I'm blessed
You kept on poisoning all of my days and for this
Brutally choking, so I bought a smile from death
The others said [?] of your demise

Was my life and I love all my survivor skills
I loved you, too but you tried to kill me as well
Too bad, you didn't give me respect

If I had been on your mind on that day
Holding on to your thoughts, to your mind that way
You could've never jumped down in those arms
You could've never left my heart cold

If I had been on your mind on that day
Holding on to your thoughts, to your mind that way
You could've never jumped down in those arms
You could've never left my heart cold
