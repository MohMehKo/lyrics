We're the only ones here, so speak your mind
I feed your appetite, now you feed mine
I sing for you, so you can find your way home

There's nothing to fear but fear itself
If you know how to look inside yourself
I sing for you

Forget all you learned from yesterday
If you learn how to change, you'll change today
I sing for you, so you can find your way home
I pray for you

And I breathe aside my impurities
But I can't take your insecurities
If you trust, then trust me now
Can you trust?

Round and round together
Round and round forever
Pray for me
Pray for me, so I can find my way home
Leave me now, so I can be alone
Can you be alone?

We're the only ones here, so speak your mind

Forget all you learned from yesterday
If you learn how to change, you'll change today
