Follow and there it goes, 
Cherish I think she knows
'Cause if I change my strike
and I'm fly.

And nothing's changed
Feel the same
Is just sure the pace, 
Still have the same.

Nothing's changed, 
Feel the same.
Nothing's changed, 
I still feel the same.

Follow and there it goes.
Cherish I think she knows
Says if I change my straight
and I'm fly.

Change my stright
Don't think I've tried?
I was born to give
Streets calling...
