I used to wait for her outside the school gates
She's fifteen and pregnant, I guess, it's too late
I guess, I'm too young but I do what I can
She gave birth at fifteen, said the baby's not mine

So I get ahead in life, get ahead in crime
It runs in the family, we've all done some time
It's Strangeways, Horfield, do you find some [?]

Where goes time
When you were mine?
Where goes time
When you were mine?

I'm a stranger as well, I'm dying myself
I guess, I'm too young, but I do what I can

I used to wait for her outside the school gates
She's fifteen and pregnant, I guess, it's too late
I guess, I'm too young but I'll do what I can

Where goes time
When you were mine?
Where goes time
When you were mine?

Where goes time
When you were mine?
Where goes time
When you were mine?
