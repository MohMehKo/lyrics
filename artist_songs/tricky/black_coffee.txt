One, one, two
One, one, two

Move over, move over
Yeah, you heard what I said, move over

I feel so lonely
Haven't slept a wink
I walk the floor and watch the door
And in between I drink
Black coffee

Love's a
Hand-me-down brew
I never know why Sunday
In this weekday brew

I'm talking to the shadows
1 o'clock till 4
And Lord, how slow the moments go
All I do is pour
Black coffee

Since the blues caught my eye
I'm hanging out on Monday
But Sunday dreams too dry
They say a man
Is born to go alone
And a woman is born
To weep and fret
To stay at home

And drown her past regrets
In coffee and cigarettes
And moody all the morning
Moody all night
And in between I drink
Black coffee

Black coffee
