Long time!

Take your spell away, like you did it before, 
Cuz I don't need it anymore.
For a summertime, we were living a lie,
But who knew love was gonna die.

No more foolin', cuz you're drivin' me insane
You better stop moving' or you're gonna feel the pain.

It's been a long time, it was a long time ago.
It's been a long time, it was a long time ago.

We tried everything, yeah, we tried it all,
Still our love would take a fall.
Another sleepless night, another endless day
And the memories just fade away.

No more foolin', cuz you're drivin' me insane
You better stop moving' or you're gonna feel the pain.

It's been a long time, it was a long time ago.
It's been a long time, it was a long time ago.
