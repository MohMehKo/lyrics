Hot city, I'm gunnin,
a case of dynamite
cold fever, I'm runnin'
won't be no sacrifice
blue steel, I'm packin'
on the prowl tonight
2 wheeler escapin'
no lookin'back, that's right

I'm losin' my mind, can't lose my soul
the power of danger gets me out of control, control

Hey, hey, hey, never say no
Heed' the call of the wild dogs
Hey, hey, hey, never say no
Heed' the call of the wild - wild dogs

Explodin', reloadin',
slippin out of sight
Sneak attack with the pack
a hit and run tonight
shots ringin', wound stingin'
no time for fear nor fright
dead ender, can't surrender
future's not lookin' bright

I'm losin' my mind, can't lose my soul
the power of danger gets me out of control, control

Hey, hey, hey, never say no
Heed' the call of the wild dogs
Hey, hey, hey, never say no
Heed' the call of the wild - wild dogs

Hey, hey, hey, never say no
Heed' the call of the wild dogs
Hey, hey, hey, never say no
Heed' the call of the wild - wild dogs
