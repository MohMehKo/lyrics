Hangin'out on the street
with a face full of tears
and I couldn't understand why

He puts me down in a hole
I didn't know where to go
and that's tearin' at my soul

Endless pains goin' far too long
Broken souls could never be so strong

I'm an innocent child
hear me calling
I'm an innocent child
hear me calling

The "nice" guy was calling
he told us not to fear
and don't go crying to others

He was bad to the bone
with a heart made of stone
naked bodies all alone
