Take what you want, if all's what you need
Well, that was a thing of the past.
Yours for the night & all the next day
But you know all good things never last.

All the evils you once saw as joy
Have finally caught up to you.
Others misfortunes are lessons we've learned
It's hight time we know what to do...

It's gettin' dangerous
The world's going under as we fall
It's gettin' dangerous
It's time to decide when our fate calls

Why does the rain cry on our souls
While bloodshed takes over the streets?
Why does the night decide not to end
When tomorrow is now what we need?

Do you remember a simpler time
When dreamers could follow their dreams?
It's so plain to see that we've drifted so far
It's not how it once used to be...

It's gettin' dangerous
The world's going under as we fall
It's gettin' dangerous
It's time to decide when our fate calls

It's getting' dangerous
The further we go now the deeper we burn
It's gettin' dangerous
If you don't give a damn the world ceases to return.

It's gettin' dangerous
The world's going under as we fall
It's gettin' dangerous
It's time to decide when our fate calls

It's getting' dangerous
The further we go now the deeper we burn
It's gettin' dangerous
If you don't give a damn the world ceases to return.
