A thousand miles away and a thousand years ago, 
There was a place still to remember. 
They lived in fear, saw shadows on the wall, 
"kill the king", they screamed with anger 

We lived in danger, all of you and I, 
Don't talk to strangers 
In the dead of night. 
We lived in danger, all of you and I, 
Don't talk to strangers 
In the dead of night. 

We saw the face of the queen that shined 
So bright 
Her poisoned glory makes you deaf and blind. 
Some could escape from the reign of rolling, heads, 
Some would imagine, that they'll be better off dead. 

We lived in danger, all of you and I, 
Don't talk to strangers 
In the dead of night. 
We lived in danger, all of you and I, 
Don't talk to strangers 
In the dead of night. 

We lived in danger, all of you and I, 
Don't talk to strangers 
In the dead of night. 
We lived in danger, all of you and I, 
Don't talk to strangers 
In the dead of night.
