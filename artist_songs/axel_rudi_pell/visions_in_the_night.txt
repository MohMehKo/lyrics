Are you laughing, are u crying
Do you know who you are?
If you're living well then are you dyin'
Your soul is sadly left and scarred.

Slowly turning, you try to leave
Before the dawn, you gotta see...

...See the visions in the night
Future's brighter there for you
See the visions in the night
If you're looking for the truth.

Are you wanderin', are u searching
For the meaning of your life?
Are you waiting, now are you fighting, everyday?
Time just seems to past you by.

Empty lies and agony
Before tomorrow you gotta see...
...Within the visions of the night.
