From down below you can see the mountain
Raging high through the cloud - burst to the sky
Wind blows cold through your mind and your soul,
Can't break free from the fear that's surrounding me.

Wanna love you baby, all night long.
Wanna hold you baby, so strong

Lose control, lose your soul,
And try to touch the rainbow
Lose your soul and get out of your mind
Lose control, lose your soul
And try to touch the rainbow
Lose your soul, and touch the rainbow

Time goes by as we passed the raindrops,
Fire and snow, such a long long way to go
Movin' on in a world of shame,
Don't know why but the sandman said goodbye 

Wanna love you baby, all night long.
Wanna hold you baby, so strong

Lose control, lose your soul,
And try to touch the rainbow
Lose your soul and get out of your mind
Lose control, lose your soul
And try to touch the rainbow
Lose your soul, and touch the rainbow
