I saw the shadow rising
From a hill up down below
There was no place
For hiding
Still I didn't know
Where to go

I'd better be aware of
The place of no return
All I could hear was some-
One saying "burn"

Eternal prisoner
Forever lost in space
Eternal prisoner
Forever locked in a cage

In the light of day
You can hear
The wizard pray
And in the dark of night
There was a rainbow
Shining bright

Eternal prisoner
Forever lost in space
Eternal prisoner
Forever locked in a cage

They never saw
The light of day
All they could do
Was wish and pray
They were tortured
To the bones
With swords and
Glowing stones

Eternal prisoner
Forever lost in space
Eternal prisoner
Forever locked in a cage
