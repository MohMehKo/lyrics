Round and round wheels are turnin!
All your life, you been fighting for the day.
To take the spotlight and steal the thunder,
And no one's gonna take this time away.

It's all part of the passion,
Goin' all the way.

Wheels rolling on,
And they keep on turnin',
Wheels rolling on,
It's an everlasting road
That's here to stay

It's your time, it's your destination,
Though u know that your back's against the wall.
But the lights are calling', the night is screamin',
And now it's all for one and one for all.

This night will last forever,
Don't let it get away.

Wheels rolling on,
And they keep on turnin',
Wheels rolling on,
And the night is burnin',
Wheels rolling on,
And your heart is yearnin',
It's an everlasting road
That's here to stay
