Gonna take you down,
Down to the floor,
Gonna make you wanna
Scream for more.
Take a look,
A look in my direction.
Touch your body as you're
Feelin' my erection!

As I burn in your desire,
I can feel
U takin' me higher.
Up and down,
Fill you up with my love,
(Hey, hey, do you wanna ride the bullet!)
In and out til you can't
Get enough.

I'll be the best,
The best you ever had,
Do it so good,
I swear I'll drive you mad.
Lick your body like a cat
With a bowl of cream
And when you're comin' up, ooh
It's so obscene.
Yeah, you pump me to the wire,
Like a burnin' wheel of fire.
Grind you down til you're
Beggin' for reason
(Hey, hey, do you wanna ride the bullet!)
Taste my skin,
It's that time of the season.
