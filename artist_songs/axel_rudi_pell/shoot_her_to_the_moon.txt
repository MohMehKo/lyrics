She was born down
In uptown, baby
And everything she wants,
She's got with
Big daddy's money,
Kept up with
The lastest fashions,
But when it came to love,
She didn't know jack about
It, funny.

Cuz she's tellin' me maybe
We could just be friends,
I've got another plan if my
Love she's gonna end

Shoot, shoot, shoot,
Shoot her to the moon,
Shoot, shoot, shoot,
Nothing more to lose,
Shoot, shoot, shoot,
Shoot her to the moon.
Shoot, shoot, shoot, whatcha
Gonna do.

Caviar with a silver spoon,
Designer everything
And more as long
As she can buy it.
That's not the way
To treat a true emotion,
Can't put a price on love, but
I know if she could,
She would try it.

Now she's tellin' me maybe we
Could just be friends.
I've got another plan if my
Love she's gonna end.
