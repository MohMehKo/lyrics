Ride through the night
Escape from the chains
With a loaded gun in hand
From outlaw hero
Rebel rider

Shoots for the thrills
Kills for the game
But no one understands
The lesson is zero
To outsiders

Nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide
There's no looking back
The hammer is coming down in your direction
Your love's is on the line once again

(Streets of fire)
You're under the gun
(Streets of fire)
Out on the run
(Streets of fire)
You're out for blood tonight
On streets of fire

On streets of fire

Stranger in town
A victim in sight
Out on the streets again
So hide all the children
Armed and ready

Hearts beating fast
Wind blowing cold
Finger holds the trigger's end
Yours for the killing
Nice and steady

Nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide
There's no looking back
The hammer is coming down in your direction
Your love's is on the line once again

(Streets of fire)
You're under the gun
(Streets of fire)
Out on the run
(Streets of fire)
You're out for blood tonight

(Streets of fire)
You're under the gun
(Streets of fire)
Out on the run
(Streets of fire)
You're out for blood tonight
On streets of fire
Let's go

(Streets of fire)
You're under the gun
(Streets of fire)
Out on the run
(Streets of fire)
You're out for blood tonight

(Streets of fire)
You're under the gun
(Streets of fire)
Out on the run
(Streets of fire)
You're out for blood tonight
On streets of fire

Streets of fire
