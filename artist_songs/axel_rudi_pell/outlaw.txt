Oh so long, hide your faces from the sun,
From the distance I hear you callin',
'cause you're on the run.
You're one out of millions and
There's no place that you call home,
(It's) an endless turnin' circle,
Nobody cared where you're comin' from.

Where are you runnin' to, escape from yesterday
Is this the price you have to pay.
Can't see the sun around, you're hidin' in the cave
And if you don't care more, it will take you to the grave

You're an outlaw
Undercover in the night
You're an outlaw
There's no heart to jump inside
You're an outlaw
Broken hero in the night
You're an outlaw
Running wild

Hear me screaming, it's agony and fear,
Shadows in the darkness, there's no "life" to appear
I can't go on without love, I'm lost behind the wall
I'm the guy who rides the devil, for whom the bells toll..
