Rainy days, cold nights to remember 
Who will I find to stay forever 
A life without you, no dreams will come true, 
Won't be fooled just like a pretender

A whisper in the garden of eden, 
Like a sound of love an' peace on earth. 

Silent angel
I wanna hold you
Silent angel 
In my fantasy 
Silent angel 
Let me love you
Silent angel
Please stay with me 

All alone, with a heart of stone
Candlelight never burns so bright
How can it be, that between you and me 
Is no way out, out of misery 

A whisper in the garden of eden, 
Like a sound of love an' peace on earth. 

Silent angel
I wanna hold you
Silent angel 
In my fantasy 
Silent angel 
Let me love you
Silent angel
Please stay with me
