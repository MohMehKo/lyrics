Just a dream or a trick of illusion
Hiding back from a nightmare. 
Endless circles so how could I know
Is it true or... Should I care?

Fantasy is the name of the game
Brings your passion and pain
Moving pictures runnin' fast and slow
Gonna drive your insane

What about tomorrow
When the dreams become reality
The nights full of sorrow
A game between you and me

Fool Fool
Don't wait for an answer
Fool Fool
The devil is a dancer

Fool Fool
Don't wait for an answer
Fool Fool
The devil is a dancer

Going round through the tunnel of hate
Endless fear and disaster
Scary dreams from the other side
From the soul of the master

What about tomorrow
When the dreams become reality
The nights full of sorrow
A game between you and me

Fool Fool
Don't wait for an answer
Fool Fool
The devil is a dancer

Fool Fool
Don't wait for an answer
Fool Fool
The devil is a dancer
