Silence of the night and a moon that shines
So bright, scary moments are fading away

All life, no real future was in sight
But I'm on my way

Burning fever runnin' through my veins
Like screaming horses who will have no chance
In the aquarius dance

Breaking of the day and a sun that leads the way
A new horizon's here to stay
All together we can see the other side
Well I'm on my way 

Burning fever runnin' through my veins
Like screaming horses who will have no chance
In the aquarius dance
