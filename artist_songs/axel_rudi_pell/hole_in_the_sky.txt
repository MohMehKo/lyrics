Deep in the night, the silent screaming is
Callin out to you
Disaster is heading your way, you just don't know.
How could we see the crimson spiral would
Penetrate the blue
The heavens above present an afterglow.

Now how could we all take
Take for granted the great beyond?

How will we survive, oh, how will we carry on?
Hole in the sky, don't trust your shadow
Hole in the sky, it's only fantasy
Hole in the sky, there's nowhere left to go
Hole in the sky, no chance for you and me.

Factory waste dissolves in the air
Blue skies are turnin' black,
The burn in your eyes are reflections of what
Is to come.

Some just don't know, but most just don't care
Until it is all just to late
The ozone is crying for mercy from everyone.

Now how could we all take
Take for granted the great beyond?

How will we survive, oh, how will we carry on?
Hole in the sky, don't trust your shadow
Hole in the sky, it's only fantasy
Hole in the sky, there's nowhere left to go
Hole in the sky, no chance for you and me.
