I saw you looking
You stole my eye
C’mon on over
Unravel you’re my sweet surprise

I’m going on 16
I’m going on 16
Come on

C'mon on over
Ignore the morning train
Your pretty lip stain
Reveals the band I split up
This city’s a liar
And I swear I’m 16 again

Coulda had a better teacher
To keep me in line
Coulda had a better teacher
To [?] me in line

My heart stopped beating
But I stole a choir
We’re at the punch line
And more lit up than ever
This city’s on fire
And I swear I’m 16 again

Coulda had a better teacher
To keep me in line
Coulda had a better teacher
To [?] me in line

I saw you looking
You stole my eyes
I see you walk in and get
Get my big surprise

I’m going on 16
I’m going on 16
C'mon

I saw you looking
You stole my eyes
I see you walk in and get
Get my big surprise

I’m going on 16
I’m going on 16
C’mon

Coulda had a better teacher
To keep me in line
Coulda had a better teacher
To [?] me in line

I’m going on 16
I’m going on 16
C’mon
