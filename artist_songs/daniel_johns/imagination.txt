I'll be thinking of
Never gave my way to no destination running away
But I know from the future baby
See nothing inspires like a new creation
I just keep on pushing forward
Until I fall off the edge
Until I fall off the edge
Within with a sentence, yeah
Overly attentive

Yeah, yeah, yeah
I will just keep, keep on open
I will just keep on pushing forward, yeah
I will just keep on pushing forward, yeah
Before I'll break the edge
Into the hands of imagination

Inspire them ventors
Keep making move all this convocation, honey
So send me a sign
'Cause I got plans for a new illumination
So I've got this craving baby
I've got a fire in my stomach
Something is changing,
And I'll burn the house down that you chose
We're buried in

Yeah, yeah, yeah
I will just keep, keep on open
I will just keep on pushing forward, yeah
I will just keep on pushing forward, yeah
Before I'll break the edge
Into the hands of imagination

Yeah, yeah, yeah
I will just keep, keep on open
I will just keep on pushing forward, yeah
I will just keep on pushing forward, yeah
Before I'll break the edge
Into the hands of imagination
