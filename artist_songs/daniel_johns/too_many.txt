Too many reasons baby
Too many lessons not learnt
I can't speak whenever I'm spoken too
(Just a little bit of love, just a little bit)

Too many feelings baby
You are my treason my main season
Don't wanna leave
Because I'm broken too
(Just a little bit of trust, just a little)

I wanna talk a song for you
While your lips are stuck to mine
I don't wanna speak but I could tell you the truth
(Just a little bit of love, just a little)
(Just a little bit of love)

I didn't wanna hurt ya maybe we can start again
I just wanna feel ya in and out until it makes some sense
Coz we got the real thing too much and all that ends well is well
Lets get in love
I didn't wanna hurt ya maybe we can start again
I just wanna feel ya in and out until it makes some sense
Coz we got the real thing too much and all that ends well is well
Lets get in love

Let's take an elevator
Sky high and nothing less
My machine
You're my only tune
(just a little bit of trust, just a little)

I wanna talk a song for you
While your lips are stuck to mine
I don't wanna speak but I could tell you the truth
(Just a little bit of love, just a little)
(Just a little bit of love)

I didn't wanna hurt ya maybe we can start again
I just wanna feel ya in and out until it makes some sense
Coz we got the real thing too much and all that ends well is well
Lets get in love
I didn't wanna hurt ya maybe we can start again
I just wanna feel ya in and out until it makes some sense
Coz we got the real thing too much and all that ends well is well
Let's get in love

I don't want to know why we are crying all the time
But we keep trying all the time
Let's make it work

I didn't wanna hurt ya maybe we can start again
I just wanna feel ya in and out until it makes sense
and all that ends well is well
Coz we got the real thing too much 
I didn't wanna hurt ya maybe we can start again
I just wanna feel ya in and out until it makes sense
...think too much and all that ends well is well
Let's get in love
