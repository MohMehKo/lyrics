I don't care if it's too late for this
I'm used to that
I don't need an angel
I don't care ten years early
I'm tentative then gone
I am a shadow
I drink too much
I need to find signs, time, let's get around
I find it hard to breathe the truth
All things I think I breathe, you seep into my lungs
But I don't want a broken heart
I admit I'm living just inside my home
But I don't wanna live here no more

Now I dance to my own beat
I could only try
'Cause I fall at my own feet
I'm tripping every time
I could run down the high street
But that would be a lie
Now I preach to the lonely
Woohooo

I don't care, we fish for answers
Not too late for this
'Cause we were never strangers
I felt everything was effortless unnatural
I'm more than just a creature

Now I dance to my own beat
I could only try
'Cause I fall at my own feet
I'm tripping every time
I could run down the high street
But that would be a lie
Now I preach to the lonely
Woohooo

Now I dance to my own beat
I could only try
'Cause I fall at my own feet
I'm tripping every time
I could run down the high street
But that would be a lie
Now I preach to the lonely
Woohooo
