I can't remember, it was stranger than we thought, you dangerous boy
Now we don't wanna feel cause we don't wanna hurt anymore
Yeah, we walked, tried to talk in the soundbites, under soft light
And we don't wanna feel cause we don't wanna cry anymore

We are here in the water
Dissolve me, love, dissolve me
We are here with open arms
Dissolve me, love, while it's easy

Now I've been thinking in a different state of mind
I understand why a million songs 'bout a million hearts played on
Cause we fought and we loved and we lived under starlight
Now I don't wanna feel cause I don't wanna cry anymore

Oh, now wait, baby, we were loaded
Oh, now wait, baby, we were giants

We are here in the water
Dissolve me, love, dissolve me
We are here with open arms
Dissolve me, love, while it's easy

We are here in the water
Dissolve me, love, dissolve me
We are here with open arms
Dissolve me, love, while it's easy

Oh, now wait, baby, we were loaded
Oh, now wait, baby, we were giants

We are here in the water
Dissolve me, love, dissolve me
We are here with open arms
Dissolve me, love, while it's easy

We are here in the water
Dissolve me, love, dissolve me
We are here with open arms
Dissolve me, love, while it's easy

Dissolve me, love, while it's easy
Dissolve me, love, while it's easy
