You are the perfect colour in my mind
You are the perfect lover in my life
In another world
It would make less sense
And in another time
You are 
The only thing that I really believe in

[Chorus:]
Everywhere you go I'm by your side
Anywhere you go you'll be with me
And everything we know we'll never have
And everything will shine so brightly
Even when the flood comes down we will never be strangers
Even if the sun goes down nothings gonna change us..
Everywhere you go I'm by your side

You know I keep my cards close to my chest
Whatever you want
I overreach, you're unimpressed
On another clock
We could be in time
On someone else's watch
But you are 
My only thing and I am never leaving

[Chorus]
