Late night drive, singing songs we don't even like
Generous hearts, make us fall for the lie
If we ever had faith, what would become of it?
If it could tell us apart, what would they do with us?

All my life
Just sticking it in
And now I'm ready to begin, ready to begin
All this time, so colour me in
Cause now, I'm ready to begin, ready to begin

Pack my bags, waiting for you at the gate
Cross our hearts, we'll never see these streets again
We've been looking for life
Where the heartbeats gone
Now the thrill of the night keeps us moving on

All my life
Just sticking it in
And now I'm ready to begin, ready to begin
All this time, so colour me in
Cause now, I'm ready to begin, ready to begin

All my life
Oh
All my life
Oh

Don't stop cause we're never gonna get enough of
Your love and I never wanna stop
...
