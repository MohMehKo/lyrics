Ooh I’m ready ooh I’m ready ooh
Ooh I’m ready ooh I’m ready ooh

At the end of the day its alright
Gonna pull it together
Change my old ways take a piece of the future
Waited so long for the end of the day
Ooh

I’ve been thinking of a time when we didn’t have each other
Try to understand I could never want another let’s talk
I don’t wanna lie
I’ve been dreaming of a future maybe we could be together
I’m never gonna lose you baby we can live forever lets talk

We got this aerial love
We got this aerial love 
We got this aerial love
We got this aerial love

At the end of the day, we’ll take flight
See you later, gonna love you and leave, you gotta believe 
It’s a true kind of love
At the end of the day

I’ve been thinking of a time when we didn’t have each other
Try to understand I could never want another let’s talk
I don’t wanna lie
I’ve been dreaming of a future maybe we could be together
I’m never gonna lose you baby we can live forever lets talk

We got this aerial love
We got this aerial love
We got this aerial love
We got this aerial love

We got this aerial love
We got this aerial love
We got this aerial love
We got this aerial love

I’ve been thinking of a time when we didn’t have each other
Try to understand I could never want another let’s talk

We got this aerial love
We got this aerial love
We got this aerial love
We got this aerial love
