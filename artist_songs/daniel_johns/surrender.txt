Days like this will come to make us run
All the things I have to thank you for
Caught up in our minds, so can you come
Follow just we'll find, a place for me

You

[Chorus:]
All, all that I be
All, all the [?]
All, all that death is
Surrender, surrender

Men like this will fall to save our souls
You can have it all, but no control
Put up in a town you gotta pull on something
All its been about, this is a gift from me, to

You

[Chorus]

You
Baby

Don't hold back, don't worry about it
Don't call me back, just let the pain go

You
Baby

Don't hold back, don't worry about it
Don't call me back, just let the pain go

You
Baby

Don't hold back, don't worry about it
Don't call me back, just let the pain go

[Chorus x2]
