I wanna write you a letter
Cos you've been reading me all wrong
Sartin' to feel a little better
But it's taken way too long
Time keeps making lies of all we know

I don't wanna have to wait
For the words to get off of my tongue
I just want to remember
And everybody knows
Everybody knows
Everybody knows
Knows, knows, knows, knows

Tryin' to breathe underwater
We take the long way around
Runnin' from border to border
Tyrin' to understand what we have found
We've been runnin' in circles
Can we move on

I don't wanna have to wait
For the words to to get off of my tongue
I just want to remember 
And everybody knows
Everybody knows
Everybody knows
Knows, knows, knows, knows

We find ourselves at home 
When I finally get to know you
And everybody knows
Everybody knows
Everybody knows
Everybody knows

We float from coast to coast
Following the tide
Got a green light in the water

In the warm hands of the moon
We'll find ourselves a home
When I finally get to know you.
