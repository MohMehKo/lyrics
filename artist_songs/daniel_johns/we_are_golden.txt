Maybe you can understand
We don't need to get away
Coz I had the Lion's heart
Before you threw the keeper in

I would trade indifference
For a little tenderness
But I could change my mind

We could paint it black and white
Challenge what the devil thinks
Losing my religion's hard
For it was never anything
Where the hell did you come from
Heaven's where the heart lives
But you're original

I don't wanna lift 
I just wanna exist
But I just keep on falling
Into your hands
We are golden

I don't wanna lift 
I just wanna exist
But I just keep on falling
Into your hands
We are golden

Yesterday I saw the change,
Fever comin' over me
I can't spend another day
I'm out of money anyway
Even if the curtains close
Doors will open everyday
Coz we're original

I've been dreaming we could settle down
I crumble 'til my words sound right
Honest, honest, honest, honest, honest
I believe the things we talk about
Unravel til we've got it all
Honest, honest, honest, honest, honest
I've been dreaming we could settle down 
I crumble 'til my words sound right
Honest, honest

I don't wanna lift
I just wanna exist
But I just keep on falling
Into your hands
We are golden
