ooooo..

I really wanna tell you something,
I really wanna sing you something magical
It's so hard to make a sacrifice,
On my knees.. sentimental

I just wanted to mention baby,
I didn't wanna see you running,
with that broken heart
I just want to make it right for you baby..

Just wanna call love for me, oh oh
Just wanna go,
Just wanna call love for me, oh oh
Just wanna go,
Just wanna call love for me, oh oh
Just wanna go,
Just wanna call love for me, oh oh

We've been sleep walking
I've been sleep talking
I really believe it's true
And I'm willing to believe in something
Just wanna comfort you

We've been sleep walking
I've been sleep talking
I really believe it's true
And I'm willing to believe in something
Just wanna comfort you

We've been sleep walking
I've been sleep talking
I really believe it's true
And I'm willing to believe in something
Just wanna comfort you
