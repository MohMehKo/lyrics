Don't know where I'm going
But I know what to do
I don't know where I've been 
But probably where we're going to do
I don't know why I seem to find the truth
In lions and vines and distant lies
We've been runnin' for such a long time
Now I'm willin' to stop and accept it all
I've been alone too long in the past
So you could care a lot

We are born from a seed and we come into life
We make what we make of this thing called the night
And we lie to each other until we become fools
And I don't care what the deal is, I'll break the rules (sorry)

Don't know where I'm going
But I know what to do
I don't know where we've been 
But probably where we're going to do
I don't know why we seem to find the truth
In lions and the fines and the distant lies
We've been runnin' for such a long time
Now I'm willin' to stop and accept it all
I've been alone too long in the past
So you could care a lot

Good luck we've found
The light beams 'til we all fall down
Good luck I'm gone
The night chokes 'til we come to town
Good luck we've found
The light beams 'til we all fall down
Good luck I'm gone
The night chokes 'til we come to town

(Good luck)
