Safe, I'll soar in time
Shape my words to lie
Why would I change for?
Why would the chains fall?
What was I supposed to do?
Stop it, I don't miss you
But I don't want to get into
Everything we've been through

Faded, so faithless, I'm through
Tainted, I'm wasted on you
(ooo, ooo, ooo)
(ooo, ooo, ooo)

All I have is too much
and I would trade my hands to touch
nothing's ever enough
Now, I don't want to get into
everything we've been through
If I could never reach you

Faded, so faithless, I'm through
Tainted, I'm wasted on you
I could never reach you
(ooo, ooo, ooo)
(ooo, ooo, ooo)

I'm losing my faith in ya
I don't wanna know
(ooo, ooo, ooo)

I'm calling
I don't wanna feel you
Cause I just wanna be safe here

Faded, so faithless, I'm through
Tainted, I'm wasted on you
I could never reach you

Faded, so faithless, I'm through
Tainted, I'm wasted on you
I could never reach you
