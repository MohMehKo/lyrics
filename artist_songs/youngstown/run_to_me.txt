[Verse 1:]
Run to me when you need someone to talk to
Run to me when you're alone and you need a friend
Run to me when you're without and you need some love girl
And when you're lonely inside and you forget how to smile
Run to me and I'll keep you safe from harm

[Chorus:]
Don't be scared
Don't ever be shy
You know you can run to me when you need to cry
Never hesitate
Never be afraid
You know you can run to me and I'll keep you safe
I just wanna be the one
You can turn to

[Verse 2:]
Run to me when you need someone to count on
Come to me when you got something on your mind
Run to me when everything starts to fall apart
And when it's bringing you down
And no one else can be found
I'll be waiting for you with open arms

[Chorus:]
Don't be scared
Don't ever be shy
You know you can run to me when you need to cry
Never hesitate
Never be afraid
You know you can run to me and I'll keep you safe
I just wanna be the one
You can turn to

[Bridge:]
One thing you need to know
One thing I promise you
I'll be there for you for always
One thing you need to know
You need to know is true
I do it out of the love for you

[Chorus:]
Don't be scared
Don't ever be shy
You know you can run to me when you need to cry
Never hesitate
Never be afraid
You know you can run to me and I'll keep you safe

Don't be scared
Don't ever be shy
I just wanna be the one you can turn to
Run to me
Run to me
