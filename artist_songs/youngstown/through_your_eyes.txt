I know a place where we can run away and be free
just the two of us together holding hands whenever we please

Never thought that love could be so kind until you came along and changed my mind

If words alone could explain the way I feel for you
Then I would write a song, tell the world how much I do
Those time you held me close and made me realize
that I'm living my life through your eyes

They day that we could be lovers if we fail
when do the stories stop and the privacy begins 

Never thought that love could be so kind
until you came along and changed my mind 

If words alone could explain the way I feel for you
then I would write a song, tell the world how much I do
those time you held me close and made me realize
that I'm living my life through your eyes
