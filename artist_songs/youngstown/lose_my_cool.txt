Met her on a Saturday,
5'5" curly hair with an angel's face
Took me a second to even walk her way
Every time I get around her don't know what to say
Walked over to her, finally built up the nerve,
Takin' my time situating my words
She turned around, looked me dead in the eyes,
Smiled at me and my only reply,
I tell you all I could say 

Excuse me, I've been watching you, girl
I've been watching you Your so fine I don't know what to do
Tell me, what's your name? Girl I wanna be with you
Please tell me you want me too, 'cause you make me loose my cool

Every time I see her I can't ever think
I swear my mind goes blank at just the smell of her hair
Doesn't matter where she is or what she does,
Irrelevant because you know I gotta be there
On the phone at night and conversations great I wear
I just can't wait for morning to come
So I can see you again, I want to be your man
Please let me be your only one

Excuse me, I've been watching you, girl
I've been watching you Your so fine I don't know what to do
Tell me, what's your name? Girl I wanna be with you
Please tell me you want me too, 'cause you make me loose my cool

Please forgive me if it seems like I'm pressuring you
All I want from you, all I'm wantin' is to be the one you run to
'Cause you make me lose my cool

Excuse me, I've been watching you, girl I've been watching you
Your so fine I don't know what to do
Tell me, what's your name? Girl I wanna be with you
Please tell me you want me too, 'cause you make me loose my cool
