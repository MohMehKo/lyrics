Three A.M. in the morning
And your day seems so long
You lay awake in your bed and sigh
Wishing a father could fill your home
And as the tears roll down your face
Soak your pillow you stop and say
Oh mama don't you worry
Things are going to be ok
Though we never had much and we always fussed
Constantly knew that you were there
To bring us back together and to show
How much you cared, you were always there

You were there for me mama can't you see
I will always be your little baby
You took up for me gave me things I need
Singing la la la la
Good times went so fast though they didn't last
I will always be filled with your memory,
Oh mama
I'll always be your Jamie Lee

When you cry, I cry too
When you hurt, I hurt with you
So, dry up those tears, I'll always be here
To comfort and care for you
Though we never see each other much
In my heart is where you'll stay, so mama
Don't you worry, things aren't always gonna
Be this way 

You were there for me mama can't you see
I will always be your little baby
You took up for me gave me things I need
Singing la la la la
Good times went so fast though they didn't last
I will always be filled with your memory,
Oh mama
I'll always be your Jamie Lee

Even though we're far apart, you still warm
A place in my heart, all alone, don't know
What to do, just don't say goodbye, just say I miss you
