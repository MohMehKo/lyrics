[Verse 1:]
Breathtaking your making me so happy 
When you kiss my lips tell me that you love only me (no one else) 
Over and over baby you're all I dream (you're all I dream) 
Let me show you what I mean 
[Chorus:]
Baby, your love lifts me off the ground 
So kiss me one more time and watch me 
Float away 
Float away 
Cuz your loving makes me high I float away 

[Verse 2:]
My love, when I think of you my head gets light (float away) 
And girl when you smile at me my heart takes flight (float away) 
Across the stars we meet there's no place I'd rather be 
Than right here with you right next to me 

[Chorus:]
Baby, your love lifts me off the ground 
So kiss me one more time and watch me 
Float away 
Float away 
Cuz your loving makes me high I float away Bridge:
No star is quite as bright 
As the twinkle in your eye 
Come fly with me tonight 
We'll meet up in the sky 
Baby love has wings, baby love has wings 
For you and me, for you and me away 

[Chorus:]
Baby, your love lifts me off the ground (off the ground) 
So kiss me one more time and watch me (watch me float away) 
Float away Float away 
Cuz your loving makes me high I float away 
Baby, your love lifts me off the ground (off the ground) 
So kiss me one more time and watch me (watch me) 
Float away 
Float away (float away) 
Cuz you loving makes me high I float away
