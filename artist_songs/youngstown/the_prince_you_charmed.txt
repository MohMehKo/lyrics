I've heard time and time again, how things fall apart,
How nothing lasts forever, well they're wrong
'Cause through the thick and thin and the nights that seemed so long,
You were there without a worry you stood strong 

You've got the key to my heart, right here in my arms,
I'll keep you safe and warm
And you'll never have to worry, never want for nothin'
'cause I'm. I'm the prince you charmed 

It seems so long ago, that my world was upside down
When my life was filled with tears and the skies were gray
But then you cam around
I never felt love so profound
I never knew that happiness could feel this way

You've got the key to my heart, right here in my arms,
I'll keep you safe and warm
And you'll never have to worry, never want for nothin'
'cause I'm. I'm the prince you charmed

I'll shout it out to the heavens,
thank God for your love and all the things you do 

You've got the key to my heart, right here in my arms,
I'll keep you safe and warm
And you'll never have to worry, never want for nothin'
'cause I'm. I'm the prince you charmed
