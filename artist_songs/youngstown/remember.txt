She sits in the dark, no more words to say,
Waiting for me to wipe her tears away
But I'm too stubborn to see
That the problem was me
Can't admit that I'm wrong
Now it seems to me that she's no longer here
And the love is gone

It's over now I heard her say
But I know I can't let my angel slip away
Gonna swallow my pride and hold it inside
'Cause I can't stand to see my baby cry

Take me back to the place where we first
Met, making love under the sunset, remember
Do you remember?
Take me back to the place where we first met
Vowed that our love we
Won't forget, do you remember, remember?

I'm so sorry that things got out of hand
Sometimes I act like a child instead of a man
Remember that gleam in your eye, then I kissed
Your lips on that special night seemed like the
World had stopped for a moment in time

It's over now I heard her say
But I know I can't let my angel slip away
Gonna swallow my pride and hold it inside
'Cause I can't stand to see my baby cry

Take me back to the place where we first
Met, making love under the sunset, remember
Do you remember?
Take me back to the place where we first met
Vowed that our love we
Won't forget, do you remember, remember?

Close your eyes and hold me 'cause I need you
Please forgive me girl

Take me back to the place where we first
Met, making love under the sunset, remember
Do you remember?
Take me back to the place where we first met
Vowed that our love we
Won't forget, do you remember, remember?
