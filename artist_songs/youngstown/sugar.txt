[Verse 1:]
I never knew
What that honey could do
She was a mystery.
Somebody fooled around
And landed in love,
And that somebody was me

[B- Verse:]
And she gave me chocolate covered kisses
With her candy coated lips and
I feel the rush everytime we touch.
I'm trippin when I'm near her cause
There ain't nobody sweeter.

[Chorus:]
She's my sugar (she's my sugar)
And she's alright.
Everything about my baby's so tight.
She gives me Sugar (sugar, sugar, sugar)
She gives it all night.
Never knew that it could feel so good, feel so good.
She's my sugar.

[Verse 2:]
No need to tell her,
She knows what I like.
My baby's got that cinnamon touch.
Sugar and spice, body so nice
You never give me too much.

[B- Verse:]
All her chocolate covered kisses
And her candy coated lips and
I feel the rush everytime we touch
I'm bettin all my money, that she'll always be my honey

[Chorus:]
She's my sugar (she's my sugar)
And she's alright
Everything about my baby's so tight.
She gives me sugar, she gives it all night
Never knew that it could feel so good,feel so good.
She's my sugar.

[Bridge:]
And when I turn out the lights (my sugar)
I'll taste her honey tonight (she's my sugar)
Sweeter than any fruit on the vine
Keeps gettin' better, keeps gettin' better all night

She's my sugar (she's my sugar)
And she's alright
Everything about my baby's so tight.
She gives me sugar, she gives it all night
Never knew that it could feel so good,feel so good.
She's my sugar.
