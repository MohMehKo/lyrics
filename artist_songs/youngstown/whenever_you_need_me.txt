It seems to be more precious
Than life itself
It picks you up in spirit
When you're going through hell
The softness of your whisper
As I take you by the hand
Lets me know you really do believe
That I will always be your man

So whenever you need me
All you do is just call me
And I'll be around
When you're down
So whenever you need me
All you do is just call me
And I'll be around
When you're down

Many nights I've cried
While you lay next to me
Too big of a man to show you
All my foolish insecurities
And you taught me how to love
And to raise a family
That's why you'll always be my baby

So whenever you need me
All you do is just call me
And I'll be around
When you're down
So whenever you need me
All you do is just call me
And I'll be around
When you're down

Oh, when the rain falls from the sky
And there's no one there to dry your eye
Just say the words and I will be right there
When it's wrong but it feels so right
Just say my name and I'll be right by your side
To comfort you and hold you tight 

So whenever you need me
All you do is just call me
And I'll be around
When you're down
So whenever you need me
All you do is just call me
And I'll be around
When you're down
