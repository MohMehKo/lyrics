Friday, my day, waitin' for the weekend
'Cause I wanna play
I been stressin', but there ain't no question
I'm gonna have me some fun
Call the fellas and let'em know,
We gotta find a place to go
I just wanna groove my blues away

If you need me, I'll be on the dance floor
Getting my groove on, please don't get in my way
I've been waiting for this day for so long
Getting my groove on, now is my time to play 

C'mon everybody to the dance floor
Don't say no more, here we go
So don't worry 'bout a thing

Now it's time to just unwind, chill at ease, relax your mind,
And soon you'll feel the vibe that I feel
Feel the music down your spine, you know why I'm groovin' right?
I really wanna dance with you all right 

If you need me, I'll be on the dance floor
Getting my groove on, please don't get in my way
I've been waiting for this day for so long
Getting my groove on, now is my time to play

C'mon everybody to the dance floor
Don't say no more, here we go
So don't worry 'bout a thing
