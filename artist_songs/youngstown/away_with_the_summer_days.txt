[Verse 1:]
I met her on a sunny Sunday afternoon 
She hit me with a smile warmer than the days of June 
By then I knew she had to be in some way a part of me 
She was as beautiful as a flower in bloom, flower in bloom 
[Chorus:]
The heat of the sunshine could not compare
To the heat of the passion in times we shared 
And then out of the blue the cold winds came 
She went away and I'll never be the same 
She went away with the summer days 
She went away with the summer days 

[Verse 2:]
We were inseperable we would spend 
Everyday together night after the day would then 
The time would come for the sun to leave (sun to leave) 
That's the way things had to be (had to be) 
And when the sun was gone I looked around and so was she 

[Chorus:]
The heat of the sunshine could not compare 
To the heat of the passion in times we shared 
And then out of the blue the cold winds came 
She went away and I'll never be the same
She went away with the summer days 
She went away with the summer days 

Summer days, oh, summer days 
She went away with the summer days 

[Bridge:]
Though the summertime is through (the summertime is through) 
I can't stop thinking of you (thinking of you) 
I can't seem to get you off my mind 
All I know is I can't wait until next summertime 

[Chorus:]
The heat of the sunshine could not compare (noooo)
To the heat of the passion in times we shared 
And then out of the blue the cold winds came 
She went away and I'll never be the same 
She went away with the summer days 
She went away with the summer days 
The heat of the sunshine could not compare 
To the heat of the passion in times we shared 
And then out of the blue the cold winds came 
She went away and I'll never be the same 
She went away with the summer days 
She went away with the summer days
