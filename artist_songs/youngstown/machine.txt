I'm not a machine... [echoes]
[Verse 1:]
Tell me can I live my life 
Doing what I feel is right 
I don't need you to hold my hand 
The last time I checked I was a grown man 
I got my own opinion and I know what's best for me
I do what I want when I want and that's how it's gotta be 

[Chorus:]
I'm not a machine no you can't control me 
Don't just think you can turn me on and off as you please 
I'm not a machine you're making me overheat 
Love me for who I am not who you want me to be 
I'm not a machine 

[Verse 2:]
Tell me can I do my thing 
Without you calling my name 
Asking me where I'm going, where I've been 
When I'm leaving, why I came 
Can't chose my own clothes go where I wanna go 
I'm not a toy for you to command I'm not under your control 
Girl why can't we just live equally oh girl it would be so nice 
Instead of you giving an attitude and trying to run my life 

[Chorus:]
I'm not a machine no you can't control me 
Don't just think you can turn me on and off as you please 
I'm not a machine you're making me overheat 
Love me for who I am not who you want me to be 
I'm not a machine 

Oh...yeah... 
I'm not a machine, oh.... 
Yeah 

[Chorus:]
I'm not a machine no you can't control me 
Don't just think you can turn me on and off as you please
I'm not a machine you're making me overheat (whoa) 
Love me for who I am not who you want me to be (want me to be) 
I'm not a machine 
I'm not a machine no you can't control me 
Don't just think you can turn me on and off as you please 
I'm not a machine you're making me overheat 
Love me for who I am not who you want me to be 
I'm not a machine 

I'm not a machine [echos to end]
