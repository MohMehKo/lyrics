[Verse 1:]
What do you dream about
Look at the stars honey
All you gotta do is pick one out
It's there for you
I'll be the one who makes your every dream come true

[Chorus:]
Close your eyes and baby
Make a wish
'cause baby, I'll give you anything and everything
The sky's the limit and my heart is in it
I'll give you anything and everything
Anything and everything

[Verse 2:]
Where do you want to go
Look at the world baby
All you gotta do is just say so
I'll take you there
Girl you know that love can send you anywhere

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
I could spoil you
Make it easy
Make you happy if you let me
Won't you let me

I'll be the one who makes your every dream come true

[Repeat Chorus to end]
