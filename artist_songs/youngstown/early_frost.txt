Summer came and went so fast, at my summer home
I found a summer love and I hoped it would last
But then the rain came down that fall 
And I'm all out of reasons that you don't call

And sometimes on my windowpane I write your name
Like we did in those grains of sand
Because in my mind nothing has changed

And my heart keeps telling me I ought to lose my pride and just call you
So I will, yes I will, when I get around to it
My head keeps battling with reasons to keep my spirit believing that you still,
I pray you still remember me 

So many things run through my mind
Why did you lose your thrill?
Did I hold you tight?
A love for all seasons I believe I got it right
Yeah that's what I'd hear when I'd kiss you goodnight

But that's gone, there's just pain in my chest
A love song's replaced your sweet caress
And I can't see how that will do

And my heart keeps telling me I ought to lose my pride and just call you
So I will, yes I will, when I get around to it
My head keeps battling with reasons to keep my spirit believing that you still,
I pray you still remember me

Although I feel that time's passing me by
I long for the day that you'll be back in my life
So I close my eyes and pray that we will be together
Together someday
