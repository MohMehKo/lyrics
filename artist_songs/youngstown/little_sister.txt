[Verse 1:]
Hey, little sister 
Did that boy make you cry, did he steal your heart away with a look in his eye 
Are you feeling like your world is over now 
Hey, little sister 
Everything will be alright, what you feel is gonna change all your tears will dry 
Time has a way of healing hearts that break somehow
Don't give up on love cause this one's let you down
[Chorus:]
Tonight you've lost lost the only one you want 
Seems all you've got all you've got left is yesterday 
But time won't stop (uh-uh) 
And when all your crying stops tomorrow comes 

[Verse 2:]
Hey, little sister you've gotta trust me (Just a part of love) 
Soon you'll open up your eyes and the sun is gonna shine a light you never seen 
There's so much more to love than what you're feeling now 
Someday you'll find someone who'll never let you down 

[Chorus:]
Tonight you've lost lost the only one you want
Seems all you've got all you've got left is yesterday (all you've got is yesterday) 
But time won't stop (it don't stop) 
And when all your crying stops tomorrow comes (tomorrow comes) 

[Bridge:]
It's alright, hey little sister 
And you gotta wake up and face up that breaking up's just a part of loving 
So his kiss hit you hard it broke your heart but it don't mean nothing 
You gotta wake up and face up that breaking up's just a part of loving 
The hurt you feel, yes it's real, but it's gonna heal as a new day's coming 

[Chorus:]
Tonight you've lost lost the only one you want (one you want) 
Seems all you've got all you've got left is yesterday (yesterday) 
But time won't stop (time won't stop) (it won't stop, it won't stop) 
And when all your crying stops tomorrow comes (and when all your crying stops)
Come on little sister 
Tonight you've lost lost the only one you want (one you want) 
Seems all you've got all you've got left is yesterday 
But time won't stop 
And when all your crying stops tomorrow comes
