[Verse 1:]
I lie awake at night staring at the ceiling
Because it hurts too much for me to dream about you
Seems it's always something that you're keeping from me
What am I supposed to do
And I wanna know

[Chorus:]
I wanna know do you know I'm alive
Do you notice me
I'm the one who stands by your side, when you're in need
I wanna know do you know I'm alive
Do you think of me
Do you know that I'm alive

[Verse 2:]
You say I'm crazy for saying you've changed
But nothing that moves you even moves me the same
I'd rather be alone than let you live a lie
I want the old you back in my life

[Chorus:]
I wanna know do you know I'm alive
Do you notice me
I'm the one who stands by your side, when you're in need
I wanna know do you know I'm alive
Do you think of me
Do you know that I'm alive
