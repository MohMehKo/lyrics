Come on 
Youngstown 
Get down, Get down 
[Chorus:]
There's no reason why the two of us should be alone 
Baby come and lemme show you what you came here for 
Babygirl I'm tired of waiting for your favorite song 
You've been staring at me since I walked through the door 
Meet me on the dance floor

[Verse 1:]
I'm in the club feelin' alright cuz tonight I'm with my crew
Just chillin hittin' it with Youngstown you know how we get down
Then I saw you 
Instantly felt your eyes around me, all around me 
I feel your vibe 
And then you're acting as if you're scared standing over there 
Baby don't be shy 

[Chorus:]
There's no reason why the two of us should be alone
This feeling's so strong so baby bring it on 
Baby come and lemme show you what you came here for
Cause it's you I adore so meet me on the dance floor 
Babygirl I'm tired of waiting for your favorite song 
Just come follow my lead so we can get it on 
You've been staring at me since I walked through the door 
And baby I can't take it no more 
Meet me on the dance floor 

[Verse 2:]
I feel the heat as you approach me looking lovely, you're so lovely 
Heart's beating fast as you come closer thinkin' that I want ya
My mind's racing 
Thinking about the things that we could do 
Just me and you it would be so right 
So let your friends chill at the table 
Cuz baby you're mine tonight, yeah 

[Chorus:]
There's no reason why the two of us should be alone 
This feeling's so strong so baby bring it on 
Baby come and lemme show you what you came here for 
Cause it's you I adore so meet me on the dance floor 
Babygirl I'm tired of waiting for your favorite song 
Just come follow my lead so we can get it on 
You've been staring at me since I walked through the door 
And baby I can't take it no more 
Meet me on the dance floor 

[Bridge:]
Meet me on the dance floor 
I'll make your body want more 
I just wanna feel the heat make ya move your feet 
Make ya dance til your back is sore 
Meet me on the dance floor 
I'll make your body want more 
If you ain't come to dance all night then you ain't right 
Take your body out the door 

[Chorus:]
There's no reason why the two of us should be alone 
This feeling's so strong so baby bring it on 
Baby come and lemme show you what you came here for 
Cause it's you I adore so meet me on the dance floor 
Babygirl I'm tired of waiting for your favorite song 
Just come follow my lead so we can get it on 
You've been staring at me since I walked through the door 
And baby I can't take it no more 
Meet me on the dance floor 
There's no reason why the two of us should be alone 
This feeling's so strong so baby bring it on 
Baby come and lemme show you what you came here for
Cause it's you I adore so meet me on the dance floor 
Babygirl I'm tired of waiting for your favorite song 
Just come follow my lead so we can get it on 
You've been staring at me since I walked through the door
And baby I can't take it no more 
Meet me on the dance floor
