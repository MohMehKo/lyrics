[Verse 1:]
Sometimes I don't know
Where do I go?
Who do I turn to? (Oh baby)
When you found something new, somebody who
Makes me feel so full when I'm empty

Now tell me this time
Don't you know I'm losing my mind
Is the feeling mutual, 'cause I
Baby I just gotta know, gotta know
Now tell me

[Chorus:]
Could you love got my heart invested
Would you love if I give you my best
And could you love baby, here's the question
Could you love me (could you love me)
Could you love
I leave myself wide open
Would you love and inside I'm hopin'
Could you love
These words I've spoken
Could you love me?

[Verse 2]
I can't ascertain cause now it's too late
Look what you've done to me
I've fallen

Now tell me this time
Don't you know I'm losing my mind
Is the feeling mutual, cause I
Baby I just gotta know, gotta know
Tell me

[Chorus:]
Could you love got my heart invested
Would you love if I give you my best
And could you love baby, here's the question
Could you love me (could you love me)
Could you love
I leave myself wide open
Would you love and inside I'm hopin'
Could you love
These words I've spoken
Could you love me?

[Bridge:]
Do you understand?
I've given all I can
What more can I do? (ooh baby)
You gotta let me know
You gotta let your feelings show
Could you love, baby would you love me if (baby, I love you)

[Chorus:]
Could you love got my heart invested
Would you love if I give you my best
And could you love baby, here's the question
Could you love me (could you love me)
Could you love
I leave myself wide open
Would you love and inside I'm hopin'
Could you love
These words I've spoken
Could you love me?

Could you love got my heart invested
Would you love if I give you my best
And could you love baby, here's the question
Could you love me (could you love me)
Could you love
I leave myself wide open
Would you love and inside I'm hopin'
Could you love
These words I've spoken
Could you love me?
