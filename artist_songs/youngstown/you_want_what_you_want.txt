[Verse 1:]
Too much of any thing can
Bring you down
Rather live in excess than to die and drown
You better have a damn good soul for going in the ground
As long as you can swim, as long as you can be

[Chorus:]
You want what you want when you want it
You'll do anything just to have it
When you finally see that you got it
You don't want it anymore
You take candy from a baby
And you call yourself a lady?
And when your desires faded
Do you want me anymore?

[Verse 2:]
If I would let you live in me
How deep inside would you have to be
Before you realized you couldn't breathe
I wouldn't want to see what I be when you leave

[Chorus:]
You want what you want when you want it
You'll do anything just to have it
When you finally see that you got it
You don't want it anymore
You take candy from a baby
And you call yourself a lady?
And when your deseires faded
Do you want me anymore?

You want what you want when you want it
You'll do anything just to have it
When you finally see that you got it
You don't want it anymore
You take candy from a baby
And you call yourself a lady?
And when your deseires faded
Do you want me anymore?

You want what you want when you want it
You'll do anything just to have it
When you finally see that you got it
You don't want it anymore
You take candy from a baby
And you call yourself a lady?
And when your deseires faded
Do you want me anymore?

You want what you want
