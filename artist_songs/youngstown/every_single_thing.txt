[Verse 1:]
I can't understand how I took it for granted 
Your love when I had it meant the world to me 
But I never told you guess I thought it would show through 
Should have known you'd grow teary from me 
So before you leave give me a chance 
I'll get down on my knees to win you back 
[Chorus:]
Like a river flowing into the sea 
You touch me so deep 
Like the sun up in the sweet summer sky 
It's your love that shines in my life 
So if you don't know what you mean to me 
Can't you see you've got me down on my knees 
You're my heaven and earth and every single thing in between
Oh, yeah 

[Verse 2:]
Took me a while but I'm done with denial 
I swear now it's final you're the one for me 
I just want to hold you be the one you feel close to 
Nothing I won't do to give you all that you need (all that you need) 
Cause if you should go slip through my hands 
Then don't you know you take all I have 

[Chorus:]
Like a river flowing into the sea 
You touch me so deep 
Like the sun up in the sweet summer sky 
It's your love that shines in my life 
So if you don't know what you mean to me 
Can't you see you've got me down on my knees 
You're my heaven and earth and every single thing in between 

[Bridge:]
You gotta listen to me (you're my heaven) 
I'm begging you please (you're my heaven) 
Baby can't you see you mean everything 
Cause if you should go slip through my hands 
Oh, then don't you know you take all I have, all I have 
Oh, yeah 

[Chorus:]
Like a river flowing into the sea 
You touch me so deep 
Like the sun up in the sweet summer sky 
It's your love that shines in my life 
So if you don't know what you mean to me (if you don't know what you mean) 
Can't you see you've got me down on my knees (down on my knees) 
You're my heaven and earth and every single thing in between 
You're my heaven, heaven 
You're my heaven, heaven 
You're my heaven and every single thing in between
