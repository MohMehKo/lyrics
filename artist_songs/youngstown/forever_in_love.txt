Lately my head has been spinning girl
Can't bear the thought of you not in my world
I may have had my problems in the past
But this time I swear that well make it last

Cause girl I know what you want, I know what you need
And I swear with my hand on my heart
Baby just look in my eyes and there you will see
How much I want to make it right

Can we give it one more try before we walk away?
You and me one on one, together for love
Can we give it one more try before we walk away?
Girl, to me we should forever be in love

Baby come with me and take my hand
Let's take an hour to reminisce and plan our future by the stars above
There'll be plenty of affection and a whole lot of love 

Cause girl you are my queen you're my everything
And I swear you're the air that I breathe
Baby, how could I go on?
No doubt you're the reason my love is so strong

Can we give it one more try before we walk away?
You and me one on one, together for love
Can we give it one more try before we walk away?
Girl, to me we should forever be in love

Girl, when I look in your smile it touches
so deep in my heart what a joy I've found
Please don't walk away, baby just stay right here with me
