Unconditional love, that is what you've given to me
And I thank God, that you will always be right here with me
Even though we're apart, you know that you will always
Have a place in my heart,
And if you call out my name
I'll be right there, so you don't have to cry alone

Like an angel I'll fly to you
With my arms open wide
So you don't have to cry no more
And with my wings open wide
I'll do what it takes
So you don't have to cry no more

Now don't be ashamed of saying
Of saying just how you feel
Take fear from inside
Open up your heart and say what's on your mind
'Cause you've shown me love with meaning, never were deceiving, for you
I'm dedicated that's why I'm celebrating our love, and if you call out my name
I'll be right there, so you don't have to cry alone

Like an angel I'll fly to you
With my arms open wide
So you don't have to cry no more
And with my wings open wide
I'll do what it takes
So you don't have to cry no more

Like an angel I'll fly, with my wings open wide
When you need me, so you just have to open your

Heart, so just open your heart and you'll know from
The start that you don't have to cry no more 

Like an angel I'll fly to you
With my arms open wide
So you don't have to cry no more
And with my wings open wide
I'll do what it takes
So you don't have to cry no more
