Grow old with me
The best is yet to be
When our time has come
We will be as one

God bless our love
God bless our love

Grow old along with me
Two branches of one tree
Bless the setting sun
When the day is done

God bless our love
God bless our love

Spending our lives together
Live and die together
World without end
World without end

Grow old along with me
Whatever fate will be
We will see it through
For our love is true

God bless our love
God bless our love

God bless our love
God bless our love
