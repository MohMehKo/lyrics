Donnie, hey yo, come out with the fun, challenge on that
... 50 with me too all black, looking like barac o'donnie
But these women grind on me like my name's Serany, it's Serany
... over my eyes, like I'm in disguise, you be looking like I'm moving the piles
Yeah,.. ten in the game I still remain the realest
All shooters with me, me and my gorillas what
I'm sick of that jungle brother
Hammers stay on me, word to the mother,.. jump that
Grab another oh Jack... sound when it touch
Ac on high, flying on a hutch,
Automatic... with the clutch
Flat screen monitor, everything is touch
... to park leader, lunch with the milk
... smooth as silk
Now I'm all grown, swag off sick
Shades on bit I can see these women on my dick
... break it down right there
They used to sleep on me now I'm the worst nightmare
Donnie... chilling in all my splendor
Money only thing on the agenda like Chris...
You don't stop, Donnie G, and I'm letting my... caught
I rock rock on and this real talk,.. block and we represent New York
I rock rock on and this real talk,.. block and we represent New York
