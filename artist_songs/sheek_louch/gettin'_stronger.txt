Sheek Louch cummin through wavin the 4, 4
Night boots, black hudie, tell me who want war
Coke on the glass table, some rock vodka
Dutchie roled soaked n quevlow gold
Ma swag is up, ma bars in tight
The house, the bitches, the jewlery
Th cars is right
The hammer light, titanium
I'll put 3 in ya cranium
Like pop, pop, pop
Can not stop

Now bring it back

It yust to be 500 k in the closet
Now it's a couple M's every time I deposit
Tell the young boys it ain't really nothin, it's lojik
Stack watever you get, don't spend you got it
On top of that stay consistant with your product
Don't matter if it's just weed, or if it's norkotic
Due time yull be pullin of the lot in something exzotic

In yo pocket like kiss and jiggas
Big money, big car
And big cagars

Comas, frunaral,
Wheelchairs parapaligicks
Reel life so you gotta beleave it
If you did have a goal
Then you gotta acheive it
Cause your body stays hear
But your soul gotta leave it
Square feet, hot wheels
200 bricks 1 shot deels
Cause every body down will pop pills
It's hard to top that
Point blank the goddest got crack
We U P S body parts back

I don't get the newest benz
I get the newest house, newest buissness
I lerned that from my jewish friend
I brake bread with the a-rabs
But I'm african
So I got doe chillen in the gray calv
I could hit u with a hook
Or a straight jab
Or I could cock it back
N shoot you in ya face hag
And you no I'm from Y O nigga
I got every kind of charger
Even the Y O nigga
