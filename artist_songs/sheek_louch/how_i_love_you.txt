[Sheek talking]
Yo I mean you been there for me.
You know what Im sayin?
And I wont you know, I wont do you wrong ever again.
Know what I mean?
You've been there, and Imma be there for you from now on.
You know what I mean?
I aint gonna neglect you I aint gonna do none of that shit.
You got my full undivided attention and i aint afraid to say it,
I love you, I love you, I love you, fuck it I love you

(How I love you) I aint afraid to say it, Im a thug 
(How I love you) more than that, Im a man.
You know wut i mean (How I love you) Im in love.
You my bitch lets go

I used to dream about you watchin every move you made
I was young tho, I think 3rd or 2nd grade
Id go home write a poem put it rite to a beat
What i would do, what i would say if we would one day meet
I started gettin older still lovin ur style
How u dressed, how u drove the whole 80s wild
I was proud when you first got on MTV
You was in the video chillin with Run DMC
Thats my girl, knowin a nigga feinin to hit it
Knowin one day in the future id be rite up in it
I started doin talent shows I had it off the hook
You was there but u was to big, u wouldnt even look
I aint mad, u didnt notice till i got in a group
but even then it wasnt nothin unless i got in the coop
Got me goin crazy everyday youd switch up on me
Puttin that rite in my face knowin me so horney

[Chorus]
(How I love you) You all i got, you all i want, you all i need
(How I love you) From day 1 to my death bed u all i breathe
(How I love you) im disciplined im dedicated and determined too
(How I love you) You got ur ups and downs but i dont really mind i still ride wit u

Ok Listen the group doin good
Still in the hood
I got a nickname Sheek
Now u startin to speak
Said u wana fuck wit all 3 if thats ok
I was like cool, once i hit it it was that anyway
A couple years gone past still havin a ball
how many times got them picures hangin all on my wall
When i first hit it I was like sheek da man
I stopped givin u the attention i origanally planned
Then u stopped fuckin wit me 
and left me alone
People only seein u wit Jada and P
U even went around town started doggin me bad
It was my fault you no, i couldnt even get mad
I had to rap a pen and pad and get rite back
Write sum more poems to ur ass and get back on track
I aint got no problem tellin you i love you to death
And that im whipped and my shitll be blown if you skip

[chorus]

I had to hit the streets they said youd be out there a lot
And i could find you around any nigga out thats hot
Every club, every whip, everys gamblers spot
You no youd rather be with me, you like to bug out
love to bring the thug out
plus i be keepin it tite
we even go to work together let u play all nite
Laugh loud while i sit and i write
We done seen the world together but not on cable
All your friends lovin me u even got me a label
You got the magazines lovin our realations
People like to hear us talk, DJs record our conversations
You good around other people, especially kids
You make them happy, even brothers doin their bids
And i aint jealous at all go out and spread you wings
U can hang wit pac just pick up the phone when it rings
I aint gonna lie to yall Im WHIPPED

[Chorus]
