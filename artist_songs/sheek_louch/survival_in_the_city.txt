[Sheek Louch:]
Yeah, no Yankee hat, no New York tat
No New York not on my back
Bitch I'm bigger than that
Who am I, to walk around like the kinga
Until I don't sell much
Jimmy I Leo gimme the finga
It's survival motherfucker
It get dark and cold
You'd be scared to put that hoodie on and walk that road
I drop a lot of jewels
Because that's not my style
I just rip a niggas mouth
Make it hard to smile
But if I did, id told young to stay on his toes
Don't sign nothing read that shit and watch
Don't shoot unless you built for the years you bout to get
Motherfuckers will disappear
Matter fact they won't disappear
They gonna stand right there
Like there hand wasn't out from the jump
That kind of shit make me grab the bitch
But I stop and chill
Cause no body gonna be there when it's real

[Chorus:]
It survival in the city
With my back against the wall
See the streets don't have much pity
No one is there to catch you when you fall

[Jadakiss:]
Uh yeah uh yeah uh uh
Some is about money
Some is about riff'n
Depend'n on how you live
See if u can survive different
For the most part all you should do is try to make it
Reality hurt nigga so they try to escape it
Me I just take it and mold it until I shape it
Because before long the wrong things become sacred
Not one to be the one that they clown on
Have your back against the wall
With the chich chich drawn
All because the sucka nigga had a fake frown on
Think about it on every visit u come down on
And it's all from the thirst and
Then it gets worse
Thens there
Life can teach you much more than any person
On that note if you alive get busy
Or you ain't gonna be able to survive in the city
What?
(but there's no where else inside)

[Chorus]
