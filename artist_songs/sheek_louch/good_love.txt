[Intro]
Hey, I'm lookin for {"Good love, yeahhhhhh"}
Met a lot of women out there on tour
Ran through 'em all but I'm just not sure
{"Good love, I like that baby"} Aiyyo
Yeah, we gon' fight but I think that's just {"Good love, yeahhhhhh"}
(That's the sound right here baby... it feels so good)
First class flights, almost home
But I {"Just can't keep still!"} Let's go

[Sheek Louch]
Fresh off the plane, into the Bent'
Note a lil' more than what you pay for your rent
I'm tired of the road, no shows booked
Need somethin home cooked {"I like that baby"}
Straight in the door, straight to the floor
I'm already high but light up one more
Just got home I'm tryin to chill but I {"Just can't keep still!"}
Gotta hit the block, get a lil 'gnac
Fuck with the hood, see if niggaz is good
Jake is on me askin me why my music all loud
I just tell him {"I like that baby"}
Throw a lil' dice, headcrack twice
Light somethin up I'm startin to feel nice
They loopin around, let me go and peel
Cause I {"Just can't keep still!"}

[Chorus]
Hey, I'm lookin for {"Good love, yeahhhhhh"}
Met a lot of women out there on tour
Ran through 'em all but I'm just not sure
{"Good love, I like that baby"}
Yeah, we gon' fight but I think that's just
{"Good love, yeahhhhhh"}
First class flights, almost home
But I {"Just can't keep still!"} Let's go

(Sheek Louch!)

[Sheek Louch]
Hat low enough, short sleeves no cuffs
Aston-Martin sittin outside tough
Shorty shotgun, black Hillary Duff
Sheek do it (B.I.G.) like I was down with Puff
Now I'm in the club, no V.I.P.
I'm down low where every last hoodlum be
I feel baby boy tryin to ice grill me
But I {"Just can't keep still!"}
Walk up to him, you know nice and polite
Let him now it's real, lift the shirt up light
I'ma let it off cause I ain't tryin to fight
But, you dead right {"I like that baby"}
Anyway, I'm tryin to see who else here
I see shorty starin at me way over there
I'm sorry baby girl but I gotta disappear
Cause I {"Just can't keep still!"} Ha ha ha!

[Chorus]

[Sheek Louch]
Betty Wright knockin, got 'em all rockin
'Bout to do the electric slide on the block and
Yeah this poppin, got 'em goin crazy
From 8 to 80 {"I like that baby"}
It feels so good, you can't sit down
You gotta get up and move your fat ass around
You don't care who watchin, you keepin it real
Cause you {"Just can't keep still!"} Let's go

[Chorus]

[Outro]
"Good love, yeahhhhhh"
"Good love, I like that baby"
"Good love, yeahhhhhh"
"Just can't keep still!"
