Now you know
I'm not scared
Cause I don't need you, need you, need you, need you there

Monday to Monday, straight through to Sunday, I'm gonna go to London
Monday to Monday, straight through to Sunday, I'm gonna go to London
Monday to Monday, straight through to Sunday, I'm gonna go to London

The fear escaped my bones
When I told you I wasn't coming home
You thought I should let you know like an adult
And the airplanes said they wanna get high
And they wave me up in the sky
And woah please tell me who am I to deny them

Explosions and there is no controlling the emotions, woah

Monday to Monday, straight through to Sunday, I'm gonna go to London
Monday to Monday, straight through to Sunday, I'm gonna go to London
Monday to Monday, straight through to Sunday, I'm gonna go to London

I've got a brand new style
This world hasn't seen in a while
Yeah we all have our time, now it's mine
Go round this world like plane
Til they knows me by my first name
I've got my own life and maybe it's calling

Explosions, know you're gonna feel it in my motions

Monday to Monday, straight through to Sunday, I'm gonna go to London
Monday to Monday, straight through to Sunday, I'm gonna go to London
Monday to Monday, straight through to Sunday, I'm gonna go to London

And when you start to miss my voice turn on the radio
And all you'll hear is noise, we are gonna change
The world, I got no choice and baby I'm trying
And I will wait another day just to hear you have
To say I'm not going, finally living like I should
It feels so good to be the queen of diamonds

Monday to Monday, straight through to Sunday, I'm gonna go to London
Monday to Monday, straight through to Sunday, I'm gonna go to London
Monday to Monday, straight through to Sunday, I'm gonna go to London
Monday to Monday, straight through to Sunday, I'm gonna go to London
Monday to Monday, straight through to Sunday, I'm gonna go to London
Monday to Monday, straight through to Sunday, I'm gonna go to London
