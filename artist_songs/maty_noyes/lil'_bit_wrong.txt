A little bit wrong than you like it
A little too broke to buy it
A little too great to hide it
I'm a little bit wrong
(I'm a little bit wrong)

But I've been gone back from the dead
And you do really understand
Never in love, love despairs
Say you're with me, say you're with me
But I'm not hurt by what she said
May I live life from their hands
Heart to heart, color me red
Color me red, color me red

All across the world
All the boys and girls
If you feel the noise
Sing it, sing it along

A little bit wrong than you like it
A little too broke to buy it
A little too great to hide it
I'm a little bit wrong
A little too bent to fix it
A little jam on that biscuit
Lipstick's like love, I'll kiss it
I'm a little bit wrong
(I'm a little bit wrong)

Oh, my body has feng shui
I'm not just a pretty face
Every piece in perfect place
Pick your places, work your faces
Can't disguise a masterpiece
People like what people see
Here I am just being me
They can taste it, just can't make it

All across the world
All the boys and girls
If you feel the noise
Sing it, sing it along

A little bit wrong than you like it
A little too broke to buy it
A little too great to hide it
I'm little bit wrong
A little too bent to fix it
A little jam on that biscuit
Lipstick's like love, I'll kiss it
I'm a little bit wrong

These things are not meant for you
These things are not meant for you
These things are not meant for you
Not-meant-not-meant-not-not-meant for you
These things are not meant for you
These things are not meant for you
These things are not meant for you
They're not-meant-not-not-meant for you

A little bit wrong than you like it
A little too broke to buy it
A little too great to hide it
I'm a little bit wrong
A little too bent to fix it
A little jam on that biscuit
Lipstick's like love, I'll kiss it
I'm a little bit wrong
(I'm a little bit wrong)
