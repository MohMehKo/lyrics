We're wide awake in the dead of the night
Either making some love or getting into a fight
But it's fine, it's alright
I always make it out alive, yeah, yeah
Don't let me go; they're trying to take me away
Even if they did, you'd better find a way to escape
Cause you're mine, yeah, you're mine
And there's only so much time we got together, ooh
And there's only so much time we got together, ooh

And don't try to control my feelings
You can't just change my life
I've got his heart in my pocket and he's got mine

I don't care what they say; you balance anyway
If what they say is the truth, then you're my best mistake
What do they really know about us?
Can't tell me who to love
Can't, can't, c-c-can't, can't tell me who to love
Can't, can't, c-c-can't, can't tell me who to love

[Verse 2]
Everyone's got an opinion; they've got something to say
So we're packing up the car and heading out to LA
Right away, right away
Cause all they want to do is hate, hate, hate

Oh, guess what? He makes me happy
That's all you need to know
So what? I love him crazy
Just... Just let it go

I don't care what they say; you balance anyway
If what they say is the truth, then you're my best mistake
They're trying to live my life
We're gonna make it out alive
It's you and me at the end of every single day
Sorry, not sorry, it's always gonna be this way
What do they really know about us?
Can't tell me who to love
Can't, can't, c-c-can't, can't tell me who to love
Can't, can't, c-c-can't, can't tell me who to love

They don't know, they don't know, they don't know, they don't know
They don't know what we have
They don't know, they don't know, they don't know, they don't know
They don't know what we have
They don't know, they don't know, they don't know, oh
They don't know what we have

I don't care what they say; you balance anyway
If what they say is the truth, then you're my best mistake
They're trying to live my life
We're gonna make it out alive
It's you and me at the end of every single day
Sorry, not sorry, it's always gonna be this way
What do they really know about us?
Can't tell me who to love
Can't, can't, c-c-can't, can't tell me who to love
Can't, can't, c-c-can't, can't tell me who to love
