One, I got you in my sight
Aimin' for Mr. Right
You're my target now
So don't you dare put up a fight
This is a love game
You're drivin' me insane
I just wanna go bang bang, bang bang

One,
I'll pull your trigger
Two,
Down goes the zipper
Ooh, I'm top shelf liquor 
Goes down smooth
But hits you quicker

One,
I'll pull your trigger
Two,
Down goes the zipper
Ooh, I'm top shelf liquor

But hits you quicker

Get up after that
Bang, bang
Where you at now?
Get up after that
Love you with a bang-bang

Bang, bang
Get up after that
Bang, bang

Boy, what you lookin' at through,
those crosshairs point to you
Love you with a gun
Go bang-bang
That's just what I'll do

I'll pull your trigger

Down goes the zipper
Ooh, I'm top shelf liquor 
Goes down smooth
But hits you quicker
