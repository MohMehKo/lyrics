No not everyone is like me
Thank God, thank God
And if they were we'd all be fighting
Na na, na na
And all the fighting it turns to kissing
Kissing to reminiscing, always missing
Looking back on the good times
Only thing that we're missing
Is that we never listen to each other
While we're tryna live that good life

Takes one to love one
Takes one to love one

Oh, where you gonna wake up [?]
I will make you go
Oh, where you gonna wake up [?]
We don't go there

Why are you tryna look so perfect?
Miss Double D's
I feel the best when I'll just leave it
Oh dear, that's just me
Now all the babies with daddy issues
Getting with momma issues, blowing tissues
Cause they can never last long
Who really makes decisions?
To get left lonely wishing, doing dishes?
Can't we just all get a long life?

Takes one to love one
Takes one to love one

Oh, where you gonna wake up [?]
I will make you go
Oh, where you gonna wake up [?]
We don't go there
Oh, where you gonna wake up [?]
I will make you go
Oh, where you gonna wake up [?]
We don't...

Takes one to love one
Takes one
Takes one to love one
Takes one
Takes one to love one
Takes one
Takes one to love one

Oh, where you gonna wake up [?]
I will make you go
Oh, where you gonna wake up [?]
We don't go there
Oh, where you gonna wake up [?]
I will make you go
Oh, where you gonna wake up [?]
We don't go there
Oh, where you gonna wake up [?]
I will make you go
Oh, where you gonna wake up [?]
We don't...
