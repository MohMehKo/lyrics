[Maty Noyes:]
And I wanna say what's on my mind
And you didn't like what I'm saying
I say it a million times, yeah
I like being with you
I'm tired of hiding in your room
We've been holding back for way too long
Wish the beats are done
[?] hence the music's on
But I'm swimming in your pool
I'm tired of watching from your room

You always wanna meet me there
I swear I'll drag you down the stairs
Well if you want me, take me where
Everyone sees but we don't care

I'm rollin' with you
Wherever I go, whatever I do
That's what I choose
Just me and you
And I know it doesn't matter where we go
As long as we're together
We'll be loving when they say that nothing lasts forever
You know we can lose
They'll say what they want but I'm rollin' with you

[Lostboycrow (Maty Noyes):]
[?] in the place, [?] in the time
And if we can hang on a place [?]
Cause I just wanna be with you
[?] skies, shooting stars upon the roof
Oh girl I know (I know) that you're just my type (yes)
And I swear we can get through this
And you get me through the night
Oh you, you're just swimming in my pool
And I need a better few

[Maty Noyes:]
You feel like sunlight on my skin
I'll take my time and breathe you in
With you the summer never ends
They tell a story, we just begin

I'm rollin' with you
Wherever I go, whatever I do
That's what I choose
Just me and you
And I know it doesn't matter where we go
As long as we're together
We'll be loving when they say that nothing lasts forever
You know we can lose
They'll say what they want but I'm rollin' with you

You, I'm rollin' with, rollin' with you, rollin' with you
You, I'm rollin' with, rollin' with you, rollin' with you

You feel like sunlight on my skin
I'll take my time and breathe you in
With you the summer never ends
They tell a story, we just begin

I'm rollin' with you
Wherever I go, whatever I do
That's what I choose
Just me and you
And I know it doesn't matter where we go
As long as we're together
We'll be loving when they say that nothing lasts forever
You know we can lose
They'll say what they want but I'm rollin' with you
You, I'm rollin' with, rollin' with you, rollin' with you
You, I'm rollin' with, rollin' with you, rollin' with you
They'll say what they want but I'm rollin' with you
