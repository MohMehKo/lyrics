You walk in my life
With an angel’s smile
How could I have known
The hunger locked inside
We can start a fire
But we can control the flame
Now I just can’t wait
To feel that heat again
And in the middle of the night you cry…

Too much ain’t enough love to satisfy me
I got a burnin’ heart
Too much ain’t enough love, to satisfy me

Just seems like yesterday
I was runnin’ alone
I turned my back on love
But baby I was wrong
Do I miss your touch
Do I tell myself a lie
Can’t get enough
When i’m lyin’ by your side
And in the middle of the night I cry

Too much ain’t enough love to satisfy me
Where there’s smoke there’s fire
Too much ain’t enough love, to satisfy me

Shadows movin’ on the wall
Slowly we begin to fall
Lyin’ in a pool of sweat
Another night I can’t forget

Too much ain’t enough love to satisfy me
