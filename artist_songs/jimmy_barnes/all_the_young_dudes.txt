Billy rapped all night ‘bout his suicide
How he’d kick it in the head when he was 25
Hey child you don’t wanna be alive when you’re 25

Lucy’s stealing clothes from unlocked cars
She’s got zits on her face from licking on stars
Funcky little boat race
The television man is crazy
Saying we’re juvenile delinquent
Man I need a tv when i’ve got t. rex
I’m a dude now

All the young dudes
Carry the news
Carry the news
All the young dudes
Carry the news
Carry the news

Looking so sweet though he dresses like a queen
She can kick like a mule
It’s a real mean team
We can love
Oh we can love
And my brother’s back at home
With his beatles and his stones
We never got of on that revolution stuff
Was such a drag, such a drag
Well I drunk a lot of wine
And I’m feeling fine
Gonna reck this town tonight
Is this concrete all around
Or is it in my head
I’m a dude

All the young dudes
Carry the news
Carry the news
All the young dudes
Carry the news
Carry the news
All the young dudes
Carry the news
Carry the news
All the young dudes
Carry the news
Carry the news
All the young dudes
Carry the news
Carry the news
All the young dudes
Carry the news
Carry the news
