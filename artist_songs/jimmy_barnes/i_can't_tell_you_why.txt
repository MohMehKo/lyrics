People fall apart, I can't tell you why
People make mistakes
Comes as no suprise
People break your heart
Can't look you in the eye
People need forgiveness, I'll tell you why

I'll tell you why and I've been there
Don't make light if you don't care
Because you just might fall
And need some understanding

The world can be so cold
I can't tell you why
It's hard to see it straight
With teardrops in your eyes
Get pushed until you break
No one by your side
The world can bring you down
I'll tell you why

I'll tell you why and I've been there
Don't make light if you don't care
Because you just might fall
And need some understanding

You got to share around some loving
With each other
There comes a time when we all need it
In our lives

People stand and cry
I can't tell you why
Watch the world roll by
Their oceans have run dry
And people hide there faces
You can't catch their eyes
People need forgiveness, I'll tell you why

I'll tell you why and I've been there
Don't make light if you don't care
Because you just might fall
And need some understanding
