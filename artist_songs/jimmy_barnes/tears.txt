Forever seems a long time
To live without you here
Like walking in the dark I’m blind and need you near
And hope I make this clear

Beneath my pride
The pain is real
And deep inside
I hide my fears
Please forgive me all I have is tears

So many things to tell you
Too much for me to say
And words can’t show the feelings
I have for you each day
But I know my love will find a way

Beneath my pride
The pain is real
And deep inside
I hide my fears
Please forgive me all I have is tears

I look all around my world for answers
But baby I’m lost without your love

Please forgive me all I have is tears

Beneath my pride
The pain is real
And deep inside
I hide my fears
Please forgive me all I have is tears
