If there's a way to get close to you, I haven't found it
I can move up or back away
The distance stays the same
You caught my imagination, you caught me unaware
No matter how hard I try
I can't even catch your shadow

If there's a way to get next to you, you won't reveal it
Except a glimpse of something beautiful
That keeps me in the game
You caught my complete attention
And now you won't let me go
No matter how hard I try
I can't even catch your shadow

In shadowland, our silhouettes dance across the wall
I'm powerless
While you direct where our shadows fall
You caught me undefended, captured me with a smile
But no matter how hard I try
I can't even catch your shadow
