Been through troubled waters
What I have seen
Took it to the borders
Rock’n’rolls been good to me
Though the times of hurt and dispair
Heaven knows that baby
I could not leave you far behind
Know I took my time
But what will they say
When daddy's gone
Daddy’s gone away

I’ve got my sons and daughters
My cavalry
And like a wounded soldier
They rescue me
I put us through some pain and regret
For you I’d put that bottle,
Time I put that bottle to bed

I could not leave you far behind
Know I took my time
But what will they say
When daddy's gone
Daddy’s gone away

I was blinded
And running though the fire
Never leave you
But who am I to decide

When daddy’s gone
When daddy’s gone

Baby I could not leave you far behind
Know i
Baby I could not leave you far behind
Know i
Baby I could not leave you far behind
Know I took my time
But what will they say
Daddy's gone
When daddy’s gone

I’ve been through troubled waters
What I have seen
