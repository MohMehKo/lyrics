Do you find yourself getting misty, listening to the radio
And every station brings you down, even the talkback show
Do you need to pick up the phone and call strangers on the air
And pouring out your trouble to any one who'll listen
You just don't care

When two hearts collide
Everything else just gets pushed aside
And you can't see how you'll ever survive
That's just what happens girl when two heart collide

Well that guy who cry's in his drink
You know just where he's coming from
And you sympathies with the truth and the lies he keeps telling anyone
Does it feel like the world stopped turning
And you gotta hold on real tight
And if it weren't for the weight of the bottle in your hand
You'd drift right out of sight

When two hearts collide
Everything else just gets pushed aside
And you can't see how you'll ever survive
That's just what happens girl when two heart collide

And do you feel like you're out in the dessert?
And the sun's burning down so bright
And no matter which way that you're headed
It just keeps shining in your eyes
And the wind blows away your tracks
You can't tell where you've been
And the voice that you hear in the distance
Is just her laughing at the pain that you're in

When two hearts collide
Everything else just gets pushed aside
And you can't see how you'll ever survive
That's just what happens girl when two heart collide

When two hearts collide
You lose that fine line between wrong and right
And you can't see how you'll ever survive
That's just what happens girl when two heart collide
When two heart collide
