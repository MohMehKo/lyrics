Well I'm a week away from paradise
And now I'm gonna have some fun
To forget about work
I'm gonna
Have to drink ten gallons of rum
I'm gonna dance all night
And sleep all day
I'll probably spend about
Three weeks pay
I've got a week away from paradise
And now I want to have some fun

Well I'm a week away from paradise
And now I want to jump and shout
I'm gonna head straight down to every club up town
And probably get chucked out
And I hope the lord lets me sin
As long as I can do it tomorrow again
I've got a week away from paradise
And now I want to jump and shout

Well I'm a week away, I'm a week away
I'm a week away
I'm just a week away from paradise
A week away
A week away
I'm just a week away from paradise

When they cut you down and make you cry at night
I'll still be the one to wipe
Those tears straight from your eyes

Well I'm a week away from paradise
And now I want to jump and shout
I'm gonna head straight down to every club up town
And probably get chucked out
And I hope the lord lets me sin
As long as I can do it tomorrow again 
I've got a week away from paradise
And now I want to jump and shout

When they cut you down and make you cry at night
I'll still be the one 
To wipe those tears straight from your eyes

I don't wanna talk I don't wanna fight
Just wanna get up and drink all night
I'm a week away and now I wanna have some fun

Well I'm a week away, I'm a week away
I'm just a week away from paradise
A week away
A week away
I'm just a week away from paradise
A week away
A week away
I'm just a week away from paradise
A week away
A week away
I'm just a week away from paradise
