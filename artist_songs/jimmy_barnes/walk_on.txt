Broken heart, line the great white way
And I'm joining there ranks tonight
Old timers talk to invisable friend
And your nowhere in sight
And I'm lost in this feelin’ again
Well I'll be strong some time soon
But baby till then, oh

Pass me by, when your on the street
Don’t look back walk on
And make sure our eyes don’t meet
I don’t know when I'll let you go
Don’t look back walk on
And in time I'll let you know

Sittin’ all alone in a picture show
Well it looks just like us on the screen
It’s your face in the crowed
Everywhere that I go, oh there’s no escaping this dream
And then I'm lost in this feelin’ again
I’ll be strong someday soon but baby till then

Pass me by, when your on the street
Don’t look back walk on
And make sure our eyes don’t meet
I don’t know when I let you go
Don’t look back walk on
And in time I'll let you know

Even the rain looks like tears in your eyes
Somehow the pain never dies

Pass me by, when your on the street
Don’t look back walk on
And make sure our eyes don’t meet
I don’t know when I let you go
Don’t look back walk on
And in time I'll let you know
Pass me by, when your on the street
Don’t look back walk on
And make sure our eyes don’t meet
I don’t know when I let you go
Don’t look back walk on
And in time I'll let you know
