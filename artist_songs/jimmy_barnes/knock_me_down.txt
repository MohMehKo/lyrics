I’ve stood alone against a lot of men
I didn’t care if there was one or ten
They never knocked me down
Makes no difference if you carry a gun
Don’t expect me just to turn and run
Won’t let you knock me down
You can try to shoot me in the back
Or can you just hold out for a heart attack
But you won’t knock me down
My daddy taught me what was wrong and right
If I believe, I’ll always stand and fight
Won’t let you knock me down
And if you wanna put me to the test

I’m gonna turn my cheek, you better do your best
Won’t let you knock me down
I ain’t the greatest fighting man alive
But you can never take away my pride
Won’t let you knock me down
I learned a lot of things when I was just at school
I was never gonna be nobody’s fool
They thought that maybe time could open up my eyes
And I’ve learnt to bend
But boy were they surprised

You can beat me ‘til I’m black and blue
I’m gonna keep on coming, I might just bleed on you
But you won’t knock me down
This is a simple choice of life and death
One wrong move and you’ve got nothing left
No you won’t knock me down
If you think that all I say ain’t true
You better keep on running cause I’m after you
You’ll never knock me down
