There's no looking for me girl
If I don't want me to be found
‘Cause I've been hiding for a lifetime girl
But that's all changed since you've been around

Out in the blue is where I've been
I kept my feelings deep within 
My heart was covered up by scars
From out in the blue you've brought me back
You have everything I lack
Now I like the way things are

I change the habits of a lifetime girl
Just lose the old and start anew
And find direction      straight down girl
Stop the lies and face the truth 

Out in the blue is where I've been
I kept my feelings deep within 
My heart was covered up by scars
From out in the blue you've brought me back
You have everything I lack
Now I like the way things are

I'm looking forward to what's coming now
I'm ready for life's ups and downs
And facing up to what life has in store
And it's easier with you around 

Out in the blue is where I've been
I kept my feelings deep within 
My heart was covered up by scars
From out in the blue you've brought me back
You have everything I lack
Now I like the way things are

The way things are…
