Wait for me i’m coming back
And I know it won’t take long
Wait for me, I'll come to you
It’s the only place that I belong

Wait for me, I'll be right there
In the gentle breeze blowing through your hair
Yes I know we can be free, so won’t you wait for me

Wait for me and I'll comfort you
When the light of day fades into dark
Wait for me and I'll heal the scars
That time etched on your loving heart

Wait for me and you’ll hear me speak
And feel my hand brush across your cheek
‘cause our love has to be, won’t you wait for me

‘cause you and I gotta be together
We’ve got a love, gonna last forever
Time can’t make us part
If you wait for me

I know it must be rough
Sometimes you must feel like just giving up
But baby you must be true
‘cause nothing’s gonna stop me
Making my way back to you

Wait for me, ‘cause there’s only you
You give me the strength I need to make it through
Yes our love was meant to be, won’t you wait for me

When the world starts to get crazy
Please girl don’t give up now
You and I got to be together
Time can’t make us part
Got to wait for me
Got to wait for me
Got to wait for me
