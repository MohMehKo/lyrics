Well you were thinking things were pretty fine
But now he’s saying that you’re not his kind
You gave so much and never asked for more
You can’t believe he’s walking out that door

You got lost in the heat of the fight
And the sparks turn to fire
Is that smoke in your eye’s, or the tears that you hide?
He can leave when he wants
‘Cause you still got your pride

Let him burn baby burn, he’s out of control
Broke your heart, but he lost his soul
Burn baby burn, until nothing remains
When the hurting stops, you start all over again

You look for reasons, try to understand
This wasn’t written in your masterplan
Without a warning, not a single trace
He left his home for just a pretty face
Feel your temperature rise
When you think you believed all his lies
But it all becomes clear when he starts to come near
You can see in his face, that he’s made a mistake

Let him burn baby burn, he’s out of control
Broke your heart, but he lost his soul
Burn baby burn, until nothing remains
When the hurting stops, you start all over again

How long does it take?
You can’t last much longer
How long may be a blessing
‘Cause in the end you’re gonna turn out stronger

You’re feeling so low it’s beginning to show in your eyes
When the push turned to shove he forgot about love
It was all for the best gotta find someone else

Let him burn baby burn, he’s out of control
Broke your heart, but he lost his soul
Burn baby burn, until nothing remains
When the hurting stops, you start all over again

Burn baby, burn
No sympathy, he made his choice, said it was to be
Burn baby, burn, let him feel the heat
He’s gonna drown in his own misery
Burn baby burn
