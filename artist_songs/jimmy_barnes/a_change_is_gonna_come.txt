I was born by a river
In a little town
And just like that river I've been Running
Ever since
It's been a long, long time coming
But I know
A change is gonna come
Yes it is

It's been too hard livin'
But i'm afraid to die
I don't know what's up there
Beyond the sky
It's been a long, long time coming
But I know
A change is gonna come
Yes it is

Here I go to my brother
I say brother help me please
But if lifes up like a flame
Like a warm fire near you

There's been times when I'm bad
I could laugh too long
But now I know I may die
I just carry on
It's been a long, long time coming
But I know
A change is gonna come
Yes it will
It's been a long, long time coming
But I know
A change is gonna come
Yes it will
