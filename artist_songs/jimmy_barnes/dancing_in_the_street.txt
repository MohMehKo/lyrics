Calling out around the world
Are you ready for a brand new beat
Summer’s here and the time is right
For dancing in the street
They’re dancing in Chicago
Way down in New Orleans
Up in new york city

All we need is music, sweet music
There’ll be music everywhere
They’ll be records playing and people swaying
Dancing in the street,

It doesn’t matter what you wear,
Just as long as you are there
So come on every guy, grab a girl, everywhere, around the world
They’ll be dancing, dancing in the street,

It is an invitation across the nation, a chance for folks to meet
They’ll be records playing and people swaying
Dancing in the street

Philadelphia, PA
Baltimore in DC now
Don’t forget the motor city

All we need is music, sweet music
There’ll be music everywhere
They’ll be records playing and people swaying
Dancing in the street

It doesn’t matter what you wear,
Just as long as you are there
Come on every guy, grab a girl, everywhere, around the world
They’ll be dancing, dancing in the street,

It is an invitation across the nation, a chance for folks to meet
There’ll be laughing and swing and people swaying
Dancing in the street

All way down in L.A, everyday
Dancing in the street
It’s gonna take all night to make it right
Dancing in the street
