It took me a while
Yes I walked for miles
Somehow I've gone right off the road
So I paid the price
I don’t know whats right
But every step I took was wrong
Just when I thought my savior’s come
I tried to walk when I should run

Now I know that I'm, I'm stumbling ready to fall
Makin’ a mess of it all
And I can’t put it right if I try

I’m playing the game
Always end up the same
You end up alone when
Luck runs out
Maybe I'm lost will I be found
I’m counting the cost
You’re not around

Now I know that I'm stumbling ready to fall
Makin’ a mess of it all
And I can’t put it right if I try
I know that I'm, I'm stumbling ready to fall
Makin’ a mess of it all
And I can’t put it right if I try
Stumbling ready to fall

How can I tell you
That you always take the path you
Think is right
How can you walk through on your own
And face another right

You get what you give
Your life’s like a river
You start at the top
And it just goes down

I know that I'm stumbling ready to fall
Makin’ a mess of it all
And I can’t put it right if I try
Stumbling ready to fall
I’m stumbling ready to fall
Makin’ a mess of it all
Can’t put it right if I try
