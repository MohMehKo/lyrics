Siting here in this coffee shop 
Not knowing what to do
Not knowing wether to start or stop
This fight ain't between just me and you
All the boys they've been talking
They've been saying your doing me wrong
Yes they have

And all the boys, the boys cry out for war

The man siting there in Washington
He don't know right from wrong
He don't know wether to stand and fight
Or turn around and run
All his boys they've been talking
They've been saying your doing him wrong
Yes they have

And the boys, the boys cry out for war
Yes they do

And the boys, the boys cry out for war
Yes they do
And the boys, the boys cry out for war
