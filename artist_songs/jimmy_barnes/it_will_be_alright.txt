Well a passing glance across the room
It brought me to your side
And the words you spoke like melodies
Made my spirit high
If forever seems too long for you
I’ll gladly set you free
But if I always dream of you
It’ll be alright with me

Well I always felt alone in life
Until you came alone
And you took away my darkest fears
And made me feel so strong
Well I know that nothing stays the same
I’ll have to let you be
But if I always dream of you
It’ll be alright with me

You and I are the same
We need to be loved sometime
But we’re scared of the pain
We find if we waste our time
Sometimes you have to choose to walk the line
Even if you’re walking blind
That’s the game that we play

And if forever seems too long for you
I’ll gladly set you free
But if I always dream of you
It’ll be alright with me
But if I always dream of you
It’ll be alright with me
It’ll be alright with me
It’ll be alright with me
