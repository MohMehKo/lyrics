Well I’ve finally done it baby, I’ve got you figured out
I said a pocket full of money, is all you ever cared about
Tell me now darlin’
When you’re gonna find time to make love to me
When there’s a million others standing in line

You’re not the loving kind, I know it’s so plain to see
You’re not the loving kind, so why you been loving
Why you been loving on me?

You’ve got a sugar daddy on every corner in town
Soon as one man leaves
Another man starts hangin’ around
Make it simple for you darlin’, make it easy as can be
I don’t think everlasting love was meant to be

You’re not the loving kind, it’s written all over your face
You’re not the loving kind,
You told me any man you had would be replaced
