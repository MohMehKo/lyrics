All you fellows, gather round me
And let me give some good advice.
What I'm gonna, gonna ask you now
You better think about it twice.
While you're out there cheatin' on your woman
There is something you never even dreamed of

Who's making love to your old lady
While you were out making love?
Who's making love to your old lady
While you were out making love?

I've seen so, so many fellows
Fall in that same old trap
Thinkin' that a woman is made to
To be beat on and treated so bad.
Let me tell you somethin'
I'm sure that you never even dreamed of

Who's making love to your old lady
While you were out making love?
Who's making love to your old lady
While you were out making love?

The reason why I ask this question,
I used to be the same old way.
When I decided to straighten up
I found it was a bit too late.
Oh yeah, that's when it all happened,
Something I never ever dreamed of.

Somebody was a-lovin' my old lady
While I was out makin' love.
Somebody was a-lovin' my old lady
While I was out makin' love.

Who's making love to your old lady
While you were out making love?
Who's making love to your old lady
While you were out making love?

Who's making love to your old lady
While you were out making love?
Who's making love to your old lady
While you were out making love?
