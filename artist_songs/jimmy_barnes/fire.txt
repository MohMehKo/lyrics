It's a little strange you know
You might think it's kinda weird
But she is my one true love
I hold her oh so near

She's not like some other girls
Picks you up just to put you down
When she gets a hold of you
She'll burn that man to the ground

Fire
I'm caught up and I can't let go
Fire
I'm caught up and I can't let go

Oh there I go again
I just can't stand to be away too long
Without my woman near
I know that my life
Will soon be gone

I've just got to see her again
Got to see her across the floor
Cause without my one true love
I know that my life will be no more

Fire
I'm caught up and I can't let go
Fire
I'm caught up and I can't let go
Fire
I'm caught up and I can't let go
Fire
I'm caught up and I can't let go
Fire
I'm caught up and I can't let go
Fire
I'm caught up and I can't let go
