Everybody shake
Everybody move
Everybody shake

Mary Mary you're on my mind
Folks are gone and the place will be mine
Mary Mary wanna be with you
And this is what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna put a call to you
'Cos I feel good tonight
And everything's gonna be right right right

I'm gonna have a good time tonight
Rock and roll music gonna play all night
Come on baby it won't take long
Only take a minute just to sing my song

Boney Maroney's gonna be with Jim
I said long tall Sally gonna be with Slim
Short fat Fanny's gonna be there too
And this is what I'm gonna do
I've got to put a call to you
'Cos I feel good tonight
And everything's gonna be right right right

I'm gonna have a good time tonight
Rock and roll music gonna
Play all night
Come on baby it won't take long
Only take a minute just to sing my song

Boney Maroney's gonna be with Jim
I said long tall Sally gonna be with Slim
Short fat Fanny's gonna be there too
And this is what I'm gonna do
I've got to put a call to you
'Cos I feel good tonight
And everything's gonna be right right right

I'm gonna have a good time tonight
Rock and roll music gonna
Play all night
Come on baby it won't take long
Only take a minute just to sing my song
