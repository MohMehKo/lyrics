You and I
Don’t mean nothin’ when we’re left out on our own
But put us together now
And between us we make something that’s whole
I’ve been alone and frightened for so long

Maybe we don’t have much time
But it’s precious and no one can make us part
One look at your smiling face
Starts a fire that’s burning in my heart

How did I live without you for so long
You are my inspiration, you make me strong

‘Cause a little bit of lovin’ is better than no love at all
Make each moment last forever
I’ll always be right there when you call
A little bit of lovin’ is better than no love at all
When I hold you close in my arms
Nothing else matters at all

A little bit of lovin’ is better than no love at all
When I hold you close in my arms
Nothing else matters at all

They say that if something’s gonna happen
There’s just no point in fighting
I just can’t go on living without you
‘Cause you are my life
