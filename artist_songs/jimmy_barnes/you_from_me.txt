I can tell where the sky meets the sea
I can separate the wood from trees
But baby I just can't tell you from me
Differentiate the shades of grey
I know exactly where the night meets day
But baby I just can't tell you from me

You've got instincts I can tell
You're not running from yourself
You've known just what you wanted from the start
You took refuge in my pride
And found yourself another place to hide
In the shadow of my wounded heart

I know that man cannot an island be
I know that distance masks a tyranny
But baby I just can't tell you from me
Yeah that's right...
I know wrong from right

And maybe we can end this mystery
And drew a line that we both can see
I'll let you have your space and I'll have mine
The truth is that it wouldn't be that bad
Appreciate all that we both have
And bring us even closer girl in time

I see the cards before they're dealt
I see a soul and know the pain it has felt
But baby, I just can't tell you from me
I know the difference between wrong and right
I know the moment when to turn and fight
But baby, I just can't tell you from me
Yeah baby, I just can't tell you from me
Oh baby, I just can't tell you from me
