My gal is red hot - your gal aint doodley squat!
Yeah! My gal is red hot - your gal aint doodley squat
Well she aint got money, but man she's really got a lot.

Well I gotta gal, six feet four, sleeps in the kitchen
With her face at the door but,
My gal is red hot - your gal aint doodley squat! (repeat)
Well she aint got money, but man she's really got a lot.

Well she walks all night, talks all day
She's the kinda woman gotta have her way, but
My gal is red hot - your gal aint doodley squat! (repeat)
Well she aint got money, but man she's really got a lot.
Oh rock it...

Well she's the kinda woman who's a lounge-around
Spendin' my business all over town, but
My gal is red hot - your gal aint doodley squat! (repeat)
Well she aint got money, but man she's really got a lot.

Well she's a one mans woman which is what I like
But I wish she was a woman change her mind every night, but
My gal is red hot - your gal aint doodley squat! (repeat)
Well she aint got money, but man she's really got a lot.
