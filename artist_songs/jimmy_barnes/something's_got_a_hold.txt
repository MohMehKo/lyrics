When you’re lost and wandering blindly
Through the desert on the mountain
And your spirits desert you
We will find them and climb that mountain

Here I am, I won’t desert you
Take my hand and I won’t let you go

Something’s got a hold on me tonight
I can’t let this feeling go, it would not be right
Something’s got a hold on me and it won’t let me go

If you’re searching with no one to turn to
Losing the road to come home
Set your sights beyond the horizon
What’s before you nobody knows
Make a stand, I will go where you lead me
It’s our chance to find out where we belong

Something’s got a hold on me tonight
I can’t let this feeling go, it would not be right
Something’s got a hold on me and it won’t let me go
I surrendered without any fight

Well the world ain’t a garden of Eden
And the answers never seem very clear
And together we become so much stronger
We can face it and have nothing to fear

Something’s got a hold on me tonight
I can’t let this feeling go, it would not be right
Something’s got a hold on me and it won’t let me go
I surrendered without any fight
Something’s got a hold on me tonight
I can’t let this feeling go, it would not be right
Something’s got a hold on me and it won’t let me go
I surrendered without any fight
Something’s got a hold on me tonight
Something’s got a hold on me tonight
