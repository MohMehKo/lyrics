You and I must make a pact
We must bring salvation back
Were there is love I’ll be there

I reach out my hand too you
I’ll have faith in all you do
Just call my name and I’ll be there

I’ll be there to comfort you
Build my dreams around you
I’m so glad that I found you
I’ll be there with a love that’s strong
I’ll be your strength
I’ll keep holding on

I’ll be there
I’ll be there
When ever you need me
I’ll be there

Let me fill your heart with joy and laughter
Togetherness is all I’m after
When ever you need me
I’ll be there

I’ll be there to protect you
With an unselfish love that respects you
Just call my name and I’ll be there

I’ll be there to comfort you
Build my world dreams around you
I’m so glad that I found you
I’ll be there with a love that’s strong
I’ll be your strength
I’ll keep holding on

If you should ever find someone new
I know she better be good to you
‘cause if she doesn’t I’ll be there

I’ll be there
I’ll be there
When ever you need me
I’ll be there

Don’t you know baby
I’ll be there
I’ll be there
Just call my name
I’ll be there

Just look over your shoulder
I’ll be there
I’ll be there
When ever you need me
I’ll be there
