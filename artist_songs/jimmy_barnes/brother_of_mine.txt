He said that he’s tired of talkin’ about it
‘Cause nobody ever heard a word he’d say
None of us took him serious, gave him the time of day
Invisible, ‘till he ran away
Blood is thicker than water, our father always said
But that don’t mean a damn thing
When I look at your empty bed
So run back, run back to me
Run back, run back to me, brother of mine

I was the one who got the attention
Always the favourite son of the family
Made you feel left out, made you feel like a stranger
It took some growing up for me to see
That blood is thicker than water
We should stick together right or wrong
I bet you think these empty words are not worth
The paper they’re written on
So run back, run back to me
Run back, run back to me, brother of mine

I’ve been looking for you everywhere
Your leaving showed me just how much I care
I can’t blame you for running away
But just come back some day

Blood is thicker than water, our father always said
But that don’t mean a damn thing
When I look at your empty bed
So run back, run back to me
Come back to family
Run back, run back to me, cause I love you
Brother of mine
