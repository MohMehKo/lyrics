You say I've got a lot of problems
And I know it's true
I only own what's on my back
And that ain't too new
Why don't I find a proper job
And get my self some dough
Don't like my car
Or my manners
Or me I know

You push me around a lot
You treat me bad a lot
You know it hurts so much
But I don't mind
'cause I'm thickskinned

Friends say you always put me down
And baby I don't mind
'cause when the night time comes it's me
You wrap your arms around

You push me around a lot
You treat me bad a lot
You know it hurts so much
But I don't mind
'cause I'm thickskinned

You push me around a lot
You treat me bad a lot
You know it hurts so much
But I don't mind
'cause I'm thickskinned

And you treat me bad a lot 
And you push me around a lot
You know it hurts so much
But I don't mind
'cause I'm thickskinned.
