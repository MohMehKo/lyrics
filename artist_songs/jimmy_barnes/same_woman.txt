She keeps in her car about a thousand hair clips
All of them bent to the roof
As she runs out the room leave her cloths on the floor
Trying hard not to look too loof
She adds her lipstick and pouts
If times running out
And a mirror with not enough light
It don’t seem like she sees
The same woman as me tonight

With a sigh and a frown as she turns her top down
And her high heels are touching the ground
And she feels so alone as she sits by the phone
Where there’s so many people around
She has the eyes of an angel
She looks so amazin’
With a figure that lights up the night
It don’t seem like she sees
The same woman as me tonight

‘Cause I want to tell her not to worry
Sometimes love takes time
And I’m gonna try my best to she her
That she’ll always have mine
And I’ve been waitin’ for a life time
And the girl I see tonight
Will do just fine

When the suns coming up and she leaves in a rush
With the sun glasses hiding her eyes
And she walks out the door
But she’s looking for more
And she get in her car and she drives
And she feels so alone as she drive to her home
And she climbs in her bed and she cries
It don’t seem like she sees
The same woman as me tonight
She don’t see
It don’t seem like she sees
The same woman as me tonight
She don’t see
It don’t seem like she sees
The same woman as me tonight
She don’t see
Same woman
