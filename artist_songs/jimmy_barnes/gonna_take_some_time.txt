I can’t make you trust in me
The way that I want you to
I can’t change the way that I've been
Even if I wanted to
And the life that I was given
It’s taken me down many roads
And I've seen some things that you’ve never seen
And you’ll never know
There may be thing that you will never understand

And I know it’s gonna take some time
But you know that I'll be standing by
And I know you want to run away
Is it’s easier that way
I said I know it’s gonna take some time
But you know I put it on the line
And I'm never gonna run away
Even if it’s easier that way

If I can make you trust in me
The way that I need you to
Then I could give you everything
Given up the way you should do

‘Cause there’s things about you too
That I've never dealt with before

But those things are you
And I'd never ask you to change a thing
You know I love you baby just the way you are

And I know it’s gonna take some time
But you know that I'll be standing by
And I know you want to run away
Is it’s easier that way
I said I know it’s gonna take some time
But you know I put it on the line
And I'm never gonna run away
Even if it’s easier that way

If only you could see that I've opened my heart
For the first time baby
If only you could understand
I tried to make you see that it’s only you
And it’s work for me baby
I know that you can understand
