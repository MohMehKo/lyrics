Oh girl, look at the time it takes
To see the whole thing fall
And girl, look at the love we waste
Have nothing left at all
In time if I'm alone I'll learn to live a life
That don’t begin with you

But if you change your mind
Change your point of view
Will you have a change of heart
And let me stay with you
And if you change inside
What you know is true
Will you have a change of heart
And let me stay with you

Oh girl you said you’ve seen it all
As plain as it was day
And now all I have’s a memory
Of life a better way

I’ve reached a crossroad girl can I go on
Or will I lose my way

But if you change your mind
Change your point of view
Will you have a change of heart
And let me stay with you
And if you change inside
What you know is true
Will you have a change of heart
And let me stay with you

You’re finding your way at last
I’m falling apart

I’ve reached a crossroad girl can I go on
Or will I lose my way

But if you change your mind
Change your point of view
Will you have a change of heart
And let me stay with you
And if you change inside
What you know is true
Will you have a change of heart
And let me stay with you

And if you change your mind
Change your point of view
Will you have a change of heart
And let me stay with you
And if you change inside
What you know is true
Will you have a change of heart
And let me stay with you

If you change your mind
Change your point of view
Will you have a change of heart
And let me stay with you
And if you change inside
What you know is true
Will you have a change of heart
And let me stay with you
