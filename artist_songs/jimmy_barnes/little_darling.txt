Well I was feeling kinda insecure
In a way I never felt before
I went through my life without no guarantees
Did whatever I wanted
Whenever I pleased

Well before I knew it
We were out of the door
When all that I wanted was a little bit more
You pulled the strings and girl I followed you home
I just couldn't wait until I got you alone

I wasn't looking for a love that's true
Buts there's no way that ill get over you
I'm not the kind to sweep you off your feet
But hurry girl because I'm loosing sleep

Now little darling you're the only one
My heart is racing like I'm on the run
Now Little darling wont you say you're gonna stay with me

Ohhh Yeah

Well I get to your house
Like the rest of the band
But somehow these things don't always turn out as planned
You called me a cab and yeah I walked out that door
I felt like my heart was gonna fall through the floor

I only wanted to hold you tight 
But you made it clear this just wasn't the night
I didn't mean to get in so deep 
But hurry darling coz I'm loosing sleep

Now Little darling you're the only one
My heart is racing like I'm on the run
Hey little darling wont you say your gonna stay with me

Ohh, little darling
Take me back ohhh
Ohhh little darling
Gonna have myself alot of fun

I wanna tell your mumma
Wanna tell your daddy too
Just you for me girl
Ohhhhh just me for you

Well little darling your the only one
My heart is racing like I'm on the run
Oh little darling wont you say you're gonna stay with me

I'm gonna give you everything you need
Just say the words and ill be on my knees
Oh little darling wont you say you're gonna marry me.
