Chain of fools

For five long years
Thought I was your man
Now I found out
I’m just a link in your chain

You got me where you want me
I ain’t nothing but your fool
You treated me bad

Every chain has got a weak link
Well I might be weak
But I’m going to take all I can take
Listen now

Your poppa said go on home
Your doctor said take it easy
Oh but your loving is much too strong
I’m added to your

I woke up this morning
The chain is gonna break
But up until then
I’m gonna take all I can take
