Put yourself out on the middle of the floor
And blow a little kiss to the women next door
Step on the gas put your hand in the air
And make a v sign like you just don’t care

Think about nothing now you’re nice and high
Advorcating love but you don’t know why
Now your getin’ vibrations up and down in your feet
That’s the brow beatin' heavy leather resurrection beat

Put your hand in your hip
Then you let your back bone slip
Step on the gas put your hand in the air
Make a v sign like you just don’t care
Now you feel free gonna lose control
All gods children got some soul
You don’t have to fuss don’t have to move a muscle
Do the brow beatin' heavy leather resurrection shuffle

This gonna last us for years doin’ alright

Ya think about nothing now you’re nice and high
You're advocating love but you don’t know why
You get vibrations all down in your feet
That's the brow beatin' heavy leather resurrection beat

Put your hand in your hip
Then you let your back bone slip
Step on the gas put your hand in the air
Make a v sign like you just don’t care
Now you feel free gonna lose control
All gods children got some soul
You don’t have to fuss don’t have to move a muscle
Do the brow beatin' heavy leather resurrection shuffle

This gonna last us for years doin’ alright

Put your hand in your hip
Then you let your back bone slip
Step on the gas put your hand in the air
Make a v sign like you just don’t care
Now you feel free gonna lose control
All gods children got some soul
You don’t have to fuss don’t have to move a muscle
Do the brow beatin' heavy leather resurrection shuffle

Doin’ all right now
This gonna last us for years doin’ alright
Doin’ alright
Don’t get uptight
Put your hand on your hip
Let your back bone slip
Say move it
Move it
Say grove it
Grove it
I say move it
Move it
Move, move, move, move
Move, move, move, move
I say move it
I say move it
I say move it
I say move it
Doin’ alright now
