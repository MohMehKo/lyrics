I pulled into Nazareth, I was feelin’ ‘bout half past dead
Just needed to find a place where I could lay my head
‘hey mister can you tell me
Where a man might find a bed?’
He just grinned and shook my hand
And ‘no’ was all he said
Take a load of Annie
Take a load for free
Take a load of Annie
And put the load right on me

I picked up my bags and went lookin’ for a place to hide
When I saw ol’ Carmel and the devil walkin’ side by side
I said ‘hey Carmel c’mon let’s go downtown’
She said ‘I gotta go, but my friend here can stay around’
Take a load of Annie
Take a load for free
Take a load of Annie
And put the load right on me

Go down miss Moses, there ain’t nothin’ you can say
It’s just ol’ Luke
Luke is waitin’ on a judgement day
Hey Luke my friend what about young Anna-Lee?
He said ‘do me a favour boy
Won’t you stay and keep Anna-Lee company?’
Take a load of Annie
Take a load for free
Take a load of Annie
And put the load right on me

Crazy Chester followed me, and he caught me in the fall
He said ‘i’ll see you right, if you take on jack my dog’
I said ‘no, wait a minute Chester, no I’m a peaceful man’
He said ‘that’s okay, just feed him when you can’
Take a load of Annie
Take a load for free
Take a load of Annie
And put the load right on me

I’ll catch a cannonball now to take me down the line
My bag is sinking low - I don’t believe it’s time
To get back to miss Annie, you know she’s the only one
Who sent me here will her regards to everyone
Take a load of Annie
Take a load for free
Take a load of Annie
And put the load right on me
