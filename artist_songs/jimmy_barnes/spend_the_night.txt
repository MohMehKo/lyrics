Hold it to your heart now baby, share it with no other
Twist and turn unwind it baby, but do not blow your cover
Tell it to nobody girl cause it’s our little secret now

I wanna hold you till you cry until the day is though
Girl I wanna spend the night with you
I wanna hold you till you cry until the day is though
Girl I wanna spend the night with you

Tell it to nobody girl cause it’s our little secret
Write it in your locket girl and throw away the key
Hold it to the light now baby, see that it is perfect now

I wanna hold you till you cry until the day is though
Girl I wanna spend the night with you
I wanna hold you till you cry until the day is though
Girl I wanna spend the night with you
I wanna hold you till you cry until the day is though
Girl I wanna spend the night with you
I wanna hold you till you cry until the day is though
Girl I wanna spend the night with you

Hold it to the light now baby see that it is perfect now
Tell it to nobody girl and make sure you won’t back down

I wanna hold you till you cry until the day is though
Girl I wanna spend the night with you
I wanna hold you till you cry until the day is though
Girl I wanna spend the night with you
I wanna hold you till you cry until the day is though
Girl I wanna spend the night with you
I wanna hold you till you cry until the day is though
Girl I wanna spend the night with you

Spend the night with you
