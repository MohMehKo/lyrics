When you work in the city
But your heart is somewhere else
You've got to hide your feelings 
Gotta keep them to your self
Nowhere to go when you just brake down and cry
Everything reminds you just how far away you are

I swear I would die
Without your kiss
Keep me warm inside
Without your love
I would not be around
It's your love 
Keeps my both feet on the ground

Well I hit this town
Found a place to put my bags
There's a red light flashing
Like a beacon gonna drive me mad
And a man outside is flagging down passing cars
And it all just help remind me just how far away you are

Without your love 
I swear I would die
Without your kiss
Keep me warm inside
Without your love
I would not be around
It's your love 
Keeps my both feet on the ground

I can't live without your love baby

Without your love 
I swear I would die
Without your kiss
Keep me warm inside
And without your love
I would not be around
It's your love 
Keeps my both feet on the ground

Without your love 
I wont be around
Baby I swear I wont be around
