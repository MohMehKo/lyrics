Hey, you stole my heart and now it’s gone
And I’ll never win it back again
Just when I thought I had it all
Ain’t it funny how some things end
I’ve been so wrong, I cursed my pride
I guess I’ll think of you until I die
When I think of times together I can face any kind of weather
That’s enough girl to last a lifetime
Always want to be right by your side

I gave my love but now it’s gone
Now there’s nothing left but to pretend
You know I’ve known it all along
That our love would someday end
It’s been so long, since I cried

Still I’ll think of you until I die
There’s not a moment in the day
That my broken heart don’t feel this way
I just can’t give up the fight, my love, it don’t feel right

When I think of times together
I can face any kind of weather
You and I had real big plans now
Made me feel like a lovin’ man
Should had thought it would last forever
All we’ve got is what we remember
That’s enough girl to last a lifetime
Always want to be right by your side
