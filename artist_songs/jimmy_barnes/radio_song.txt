Strange that I can’t get you of my mind
And I can see it’s going to take some time
To take away the thought of you
That makes me crazy, that makes me blue
It’s plain to see you’re just another kind

And I see red, well you’re in my head
Like a radio song
You shot me dead, you’re in my head
Like a radio song

Looking for you walking in the rain
And I can see it going to hail again
Dreaming about you in the day
And night time dreaming you will stay
A shot of whiskey takes the pain away

And I see red, well you’re in my head
Like a radio song
You shot me dead, you’re in my head
Like a radio song

She goes on and on and on and on
And on and on and on and on
Just like a radio song

She goes on and on and on and on
And on and on and on and on
Just like a radio song

And I see red, well you’re in my head
Like a radio song
Well you shot me dead, you’re in my head
Like a radio song
Just like a radio song

Shot me dead you’re in my head just like a radio song
