Yeah baby I've been drinking
And I should come by I know
But I've found myself in trouble
And I had nowhere else to go
I got some whiskey from a barman
I got some cocaine from a friend
I just had to keep on moving
Until I was back in your arms again

Oh guilty, oh I'm guilty,
Honey I'm guilty, I'm guilty
But I'll be guilty all the rest of my life

Oh how come I never do
What I'm supposed to do
How come nothing I try to do
Ever seems to turn out right
But, you know
How it is with me baby
Oh, you know sometimes I just can’t stand myself
It takes a whole lot of medicine
For me to pretend I'm somebody else
Baby, oh oh
(I’m guilty) yeah yeah
