I got something baby on my mind
It's tearing me up inside
And I gotta let it lose tonight baby now
I know you can feel what I'm going though
Everybody telling me what to do
Well I need somebody to talk to
Well I'm different I can feel the changes
But I can't turn back the pages
And our hearts are all we have to saver
Come on save me tonight

We're gonna ride the night away
Yeah baby gonna ride the night away
Well there ain't no time left to borrow
I guess I'll have to think about it tomorrow
We're gonna ride, ride the night away

I got a gun pointed at my head
I put it there by my self
I can't ask ya but I need some help baby now
And I've got a fire burning in my soul
I'm dangerous and out of control
And tonight I've got to let it go
Yes I do 

I can't look back baby I've tried
It's too late for me to compromise
Well I need somebody by my side
Come on save me tonight

We're gonna ride the night away
Yeah baby gonna ride the night away
Well there ain't no time left to borrow
I guess I'll have to think about it tomorrow
We're gonna ride, ride the night away

I can't look back baby I've tried
It's too late for me to compromise
Well I need somebody by my side
Come on save me tonight

We're gonna ride the night away
Yeah baby gonna ride the night away
Well there ain't no time left to borrow
I guess I'll have to think about it tomorrow
We're gonna ride, ride the night away
We're gonna ride, ride the night away
We're gonna ride, ride the night away
Ride the night away
