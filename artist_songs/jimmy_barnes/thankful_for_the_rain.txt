From when you came to stay until you went away
From me
By all that’s up above you swore you’d keep your love
For me
And though I really do believe
Nothing’s forever and I know one day I’ll see

I’m thankful for the rain that washed away my pain
It came down just in time to save this heart of mine
I’m thankful for the rain

Now that dark has passed I see the light at last
It’s true
Sometimes I close my eyes, I drift into paradise
Baby with you
Though life is bitter-sweet I hunger just for you

I’m thankful for the rain that washed away my pain
It came down just in time to save this heart of mine
I’m thankful for the tide that swept away my pride
I never would have known a love that never died
I’m thankful for the rain
I’m thankful for the rain
I’m thankful for the rain

From when you came to stay until you went away
By all that’s up above you swore you’d keep your love

I’m thankful for the rain
