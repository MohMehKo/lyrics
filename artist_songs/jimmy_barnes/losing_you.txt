It's a long night
And daylight ain't coming fast
And it's cold outside
It seems the rain is gonna last

And I'm lying here awake
All the silence I can take
And I feel I'm gonna break
And get up and run

I can feel you move
Each breathe it seems so slow
Thinking of your touch
But I have to let it go

And each word that ain't been said
It feels like thunder in my head
And I'm shaking in this bed
And it ain't from the cold

I feel it slipping, girl I'm losing you
You're drifting further with each thing that you do
I feel it slipping, girl I know that I'm losing you
Yeah I'm losing you

And each word that ain't been said
Just feels like thunder in my head
And I'm shaking in this bed
And it ain't from the cold, yeah

I feel it slipping, girl I'm losing you
You're drifting further with each thing that you do
I feel it slipping, girl I know that I'm losing you

I feel it slipping, girl I'm losing you
You're drifting further with each thing that you do
I feel it slipping, girl I know that I'm losing you
Yeah I'm losing you

I know that I'm losing you
Yeah I know that I'm losing you
I know that I'm losing you
I know that I'm losing you
