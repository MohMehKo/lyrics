You may find it in the bible, can’t wear it on your hand
It never drags you under if it don’t go quite as planned

In the eyes of babies or a hotel girl at night
You catch a glimpse at something
That your heart, don’t see as right

You twist and turn the dagger
And then you poison your own soul

This is just a love song and I’m dying without your love

You may learn of love in collage
Like a blind man drowned in light
As you lay back in your china bed
With shattered love in sight

And everything reminds you
Just how you’ve gone and lost control

This is just a love song and I’m dying without your love
This is just a love song and I’m dying without your love

You can’t call out god have mercy cos god can’t kill the pain
Burning deep inside of you because there’s no-one
Else to blame

This is just a love song for you since you’ve been gone
I wanna tell ya
This is just a love song and I’m dying without your love
This is just a love song for you since you’ve been gone
I wanna tell ya
This is just a love song and I’m dying without your love
I’m dying without your love
I’m dying without your love
I’m dying without your love
