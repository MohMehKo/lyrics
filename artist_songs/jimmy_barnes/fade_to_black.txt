I'll be with you tonight
Far away from the noise of the crowd
I'm gonna cash in my dreams
I got no use for them now
Come on turn on the light
There is too much to lose
So give me something to believe in
When day fades to black
I won't look back, of that I'm certain
When day fades to black
I won't look back at all

I wanna get of this one way street
Don't want to be among the faceless
Here I am one of the living dead
Murdered by the streets that surround me

Can't knock me down in this fight
I don't know how to lose
These city walls that try to confine me
Won't bring me down on my knees
This ain't no time to be lonely
Cause there ain't nothing that's left
Here to hold me
I can't be bought with a handful of dreams
And the promises I can't believe in

I wanna get of this one way street
Don't want to be among the faceless
Here I am one of the living dead
Murdered by the streets that surround me
