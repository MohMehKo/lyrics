I’ve been down too many reasons why
Out of two a trip to out of town
I’ve walked on water
Untill my well ran dry
I’ve been down too many reasons why

When the shallow life gets faded
All that’s left is jaded
Well I don’t care if I’ve got you as a friend
Well it seems like there’s no tomorrow
The dreams I had were borrowed
It don’t mater none if I got you as a friend

Light did fade and I was left in black
Waitin’ for the daybreak it nearly broke my back
There came a time I spent up
Shotin’ though the crowds
Light did fade and I was left in black

When the shallow life gets faded
All that’s left is jaded
Well I don’t care if I’ve got you as a friend
Well it seems like there’s no tomorrow
The dreams I had were borrowed
It don’t mater none if I got you as

You to me the most presious thing
God has left me
Heaven knows were I’d be right now
Without the love you sent me

The shallow life gets faded
All that’s left is jaded
Well I don’t care if I’ve got you as a friend
Well it seems like there’s no tomorrow
The dreams I had were borrowed
It don’t mater none if I got you as a friend

I don’t care if the day fades to black
With a little help I would find my way back
It don’t matter no if the shine gets faded
