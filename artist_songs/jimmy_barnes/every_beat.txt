Oh darling
I just got to let you know
I just can’t stand it
When I have to let you go

If you only knew
How I hunger for you
With every beat of my heart

You call me on the phone
Just to test my love
But girl when I’m all alone
You’re the only one I’m thinking of

If you only know
How I’m wishing for you
With every beat of my heart

Love knows, love grows
And love will show no fear
So baby don’t you cry or wonder why
Let me wipe away your tears

I know it’s true
I want no one but you
It’s always been right
From the start

If you only know
I was wishing for you
With every beat of my heart
With every beat of my heart
I wanna love ya with every beat of my heart
