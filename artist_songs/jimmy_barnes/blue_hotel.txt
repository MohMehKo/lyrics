Some paradise that draws me on
As far as I can go
Some act of god gone crazy now
For all the love in the world

Like a traveler I've come
I am just a child waitin' on the bus
Find the two of us inside the blue hotel
Where I paid my respects
And I never went to sleep all night

A lost wilderness that haunts me
Where I can't find my breath
Some sacrifice is needed before I can go on
Down the corridors I walk
I'm searching for the right number on the door
It's just another night inside the blue hotel
Where I paid my respects
And we both stayed out of sight
And I never went to sleep all night

Some paradise that holds me
I sealed it with a kiss
Some sacrifice is needed before I can go on
Before I can go on

And I paid my respects
We both stayed out of sight
I left a note by the bed
These are the words that I write
Some sacrifice is needed
