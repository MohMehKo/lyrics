Young restless in the heart land
Undecided trying hard to understand
Bold rebels faded glory mighty dollar
It could make 'em mad
And all the home town rallied
On everything worth trying
And when we fell the lightning 
And still the thunder
Never give in

The sainest eyes keep from burning
And on the fire take on the heat
We multiply sweet home and hearted
Change with the times 
American heartbeat 
American heartbeat

Modern music making headline
It set the fashion
For everyone to see
In and out of troubled waters
Smooth talkers (try to sisle man a key)[?]
And all the home town rallys
On every beat werth trying
And when we fell the lightning 
And still the thunder
Never give in

The sainest eyes keep from burning
And on the fire take on the heat
We multiply sweet home and hearted
Change with the times 
American heartbeat 
American heartbeat
Yes it is 
American heartbeat

And every generation
They feel the new sensation 
All day long
Were they find that hunger
Keep on chasing thunder
Never give in

The sainest eyes keep from burning
And on the fire take on the heat
We wont be long sweet home and hearted
Change with the times

American heartbeat 
American heartbeat
It's an american heartbeat
Yes it is
It's an american heartbeat
American heartbeat
