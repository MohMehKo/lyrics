I am a lineman for the county
And I drive the main road
Searchin’ in the sun for another overload
I hear you singing in the wire
I can hear you though the wire
And the wichita lineman
Is still on the line

I know I need a small vacation
But it don’t look like a prey
And if it snows that streach down south
Won’t ever stand the strain
And I need you more than want you
And I want you for all time
And the wichita lineman
Is still on the line

And I need you more than want you
And I want you for all time
And the wichita lineman
Is still on the line

Still on the line
He’s got that woman on his mind
Still on the line
