Baby you say you gotta say goodbye
You tell me that you gotta go
But you don't wanna tell me why
And I wouldn't try to make you stay
Even though it hurts inside
I think you're better off this way
Just before your touch has turned to ice
Baby give me one more taste of paradise

Let's make it last all night
This could be the last time I make love to you
Let's make it last all night
Baby give me something to hold on to
Even if we can't make it right
Baby make it last all night

Baby before you throw it all away
Before goodbye is carved in stone
And then there's nothing left to say
Before you close the door on your desire
Baby give me one more chance to feel your fire

Let's make it last all night
This could be the last time I make love to you
Let's make it last all night
Baby give me something to hold on to
Even if we can't make it right
Baby make it last all night
Before your touch is turned to ice
Give me one more taste of paradise
