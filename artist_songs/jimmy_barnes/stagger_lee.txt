The night was clear and the moon was yellow
And the leaves came tumbling down

I was standing on the corner when I heard my bulldog bark
He was barkin' at the two men who was gamblin' in the dark
It was stagger lee and billy, they were two men gambling
Stagger lee threw a seven, billy swore that he threw an eight

Stagger lee told billy, I can’t let you go with that
You have won all my money and my brand new stetson hat
Stagger lee went home and he got his forty-four
Said I’m goin' to the barroom got to pay the debt I owe

Stagger lee went to the barroom and he stood across the barroom door
He said nobody move and he pulled that forty-four
Stagger lee heard billy say please don’t take my life
I’ve got three hungry children and a very happy wife
Stagger lee shot billy, well he shot that boy so bad
That the bullet went though billy and it broke the bartender’s glass
That’s got to teach you a lesson some how
