Well I'm walking down the road
I got no place left to go
Everything I used to have
Now I've got nothing left to show

Well I'm not looking for your sympathy
But I could use a little dough

Well I'm walking by the red light
Gonna find me all that I'm owed
And I know where I'm gonna be then
When the red light's gonna shine on me

And the pilgrims look for hope
Among the booze and the girls and dope
In this city institution
Find your life or lose your soul

Well I'm walking by the red light
Gonna find me all that I'm owed
And I know where I'm gonna be then
When the red light's gonna shine on me

Well the wind is blowing harder
And I just don't feel the cold

And all the girls with their lipstick smiles
They keep on walking by
They're blowing kisses in the cold night air
You'll see heaven in there eyes

Well I'm walking by the red light
Gonna find me all that I'm owed
And I know where I'm gonna be then
When the red light's

Well I'm walking by the red light
Gonna find me all that I'm owed
And I know where I'm gonna be then
When the red light's gonna shine on me

It's gonna shine on me
I said that red light's gonna shine
It's gonna shine on me
Gonna shine on me...
