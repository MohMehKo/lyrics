Ain't it strange how opposites attract
Can't explain but it's a proven fact
All I know, can't turn my back on you
Here we are, we're drawn into a flame

No one's fault, no one we can blame
Can't deny you feel the same way too
And I tell you'll be always close at hand
When you feel you'll finally understand

You and I were meant to be as one
Hey girl, we got a love
That I swear will stand the test of time
Can't be here with me,

I swear I would rather be blind
I was lost and had nowhere to turn
You came and I began to learn how it feels
You touched down deep in my soul

When you find you need someone to hold you tight
And everything around you don't feel right
Call on me and I'll be there by your side
Hey girl, we got a love that I swear
Will stand the test of time
Can't be here with me, I swear I'll go out of my mind

Oh believe me now, you are the light
That will lead me through the darkest night
If I can't see you with me
I swear I would rather be blind

And I tell you that I will always be closer, hey
When you feel you finally understand
You and I are meant to be as one
Hey girl, you are the light
That will lead me through the darkest night

If I can't see you with me
I swear I would rather be blind
Oh believe me now we got a love
That I swear will stand the test of time
I swear I would rather be blind

Baby, we got a love
That I swear will stand the test of time
Believe me girl, you are the light
That will lead me through the darkest night
I would rather be blind
