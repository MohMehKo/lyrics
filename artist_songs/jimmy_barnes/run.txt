I live my life
Just the way that I wanted to
I do what I like
I only move how I want to move

Well excuse me please for saying
You know I don’t want to complain but
It seems to me that you need
A little time on your own, so

Run run away you run
Don’t look back don’t come back no more
Ain’t gonna be the one to live like that
So don’t call me back no more

I opened my eyes
I didn’t know I was hurtin’ you
I swallow my pried
‘cause when you’re gone I’ll be missing you

You took your time to see
All that you had in me
I don’t really need to stay
I ain’t gonna live this way, so

Run run away you run
Don’t look back don’t come back no more
I ain’t gonna be the one to live like that
So don’t hold me back no more

Time on my own
It showed me just what I need
All that I have I would give
To get back to you

I don’t know what to believe
But I would love it to be true

If you come back to me
I’d show you all I feel

Run run I’m gonna run
To your arms
I’m coming back oh oh
I ain’t gonna be the one to hold you back
And live like that no more

I can live like that
I said run run I’m gonna run
