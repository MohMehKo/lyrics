Seems I’ve been my whole life what I'm suppose to be
Now I've had enough and I'm gonna be free
Every day in every way I'm losing sight
Of all my dreams and lord knows that just ain’t right

Sometimes you’re just so persuasive girl
Hang on every word you say

You better get used to the truth
Honey there just ain’t no time no more
You better get used to the truth
I’m walking right out of that door

I can smell salvation when it gets close to me
As I'm reaching out I feel it just slipping away

Just give me some indication girl
That there’s nothing left to say

You better get used to the truth
Honey there just ain’t no time no more
You better get used to the truth
I’m walking right out of that door

You better get used to the truth
Honey there just ain’t no time no more
You better get used to the truth
I’m walking right out of that door

How can you please yourself and no one else can even
Try to find a way into the place you hide away from me

Sometimes you’re just so persuasive girl
Hang on every word you say
As I'm reaching out and you’re slipping away

You better get used to the truth
Honey there just ain’t no time no more
You better get used to the truth
I’m walking right out of that door

You better get used to the truth
Honey there just ain’t no time no more
You better get used to the truth
I’m walking right out of that door

You got to get used to the truth
Honey there just ain’t no time no more
You better get used to the truth
I’m walking right out of that door

You got to get used to the truth
You got to get used to the truth
You got to get used to the truth
I’m walking right out of that door
You got to get used to the truth
Honey there just ain’t no time no more
You got to get used to the truth
I’m walking right out of that door
