Seven days
Seven more days and she’ll be comin’
And I’ll be waiting at the station
For her to arive
Seven more days and all I got to do is survive

I’ve been good
I’ve been good while I’ve been waiting
Maybe guilty of hesitating
But I just keep holding on
Seven more days and all that’ll be gone

Kissing in the valley
Thieving in the ally
Fighting every inch of the way
Trying to pretend that there’s someone
That I remember in a night
That’s always brighter than the day
Seven days

But I just keep holding on
Seven days
