Lets make believe it’s you and me forever
Out on a road that brings us close together
But all along there’s something there deceiving
It takes us to the edge and it leaves us

The blind can’t lead the blind
And hearts are drowned in lost emotion
And time ain’t on our side
The simple truth I know can be so hard to find

Say to you that you’re wrong but you know that you’re right
Oh you’re counting the cost and you’re paying the price
It takes you oh so long but you’ve run out of time

The blind can’t lead the blind
And hearts are drowned in lost emotion
And time ain’t on our side
The simple truth I know can be so hard to find

The blind can’t lead the blind
And hearts are drowned in lost emotion
And time ain’t on our side
The simple truth I know can be so hard to find
