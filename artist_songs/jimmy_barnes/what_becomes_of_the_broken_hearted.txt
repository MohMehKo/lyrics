As I walk this land with brocken dreams
I have visions of many things
Love’s happiness is just an illusion
Filled with sadness and confusion

What becomes of the broken hearted
Who had love that’s now departed
I know I’ve got to find
Some kind of peace of mind
Help me please

The fruits of love grow all around
But for me they come a tumblin’ down
Every day heartaches grow a little stronger
I can’t stand the pain much longer
I walk in the shadows
Searching for light
Cold and alone
No comfort in sight
Hoping and praying for someone to care
Always moving and goin’ nowhere

What becomes of the broken hearted
Who had love that’s now departed
I know I’ve got to find
Some kind of peace of mind
Help me please

I’m searching though, I don’t succed
Someone else, there’s a growing need
All that’s left there’s no place for beginning
All that’s left is an unhappy ending

Now what becomes of the broken hearted
Who had love that’s now departed
I know I’ve got to find
Some kind of peace of mind

I’ll be searching everywhere
Just to find someone to care
I’ll be looking everyday
I know I’m gonna find a way
I’ve got to find a peace of mind baby

What becomes of the broken hearted
I know I’ve got to find
Some kind of peace of mind
Just to find someone to care
