Just in time my love
Made a wish tonight
This old daddy’s gonna
Keep you away from nasty satan

Kisses on the lips
And leave a swig for me
I’m so glad you could
Come on over and

Sit on my knee
And fall in love with me
It’s aright
I can sit here all night

I’m the araldite
On your broken dreams
I’m your green percent
In your nicotine
I’m your friend for life
And i cross my heart
And it's fair to say we
Make a good start

Sit on my knee
And fall in love with me
And hey it’s aright
I can sit here all night

Come on now
Sit on my knee
Come on over
Oh won’t you sit on my knee
Come on over

Sit on my knee
And fall in love with me
Hey it’s aright I can see ya all night

Sit on my knee
All night
Sit on my knee
All night
