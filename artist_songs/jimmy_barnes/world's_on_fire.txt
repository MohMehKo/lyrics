Out on the weekend
I'm as mad as hell
It's confusion in the citadel
No loser's gonna keep me down
I've been kicked and I've been
Shoved about

You think I'm crazy
But I know why
I ain't no thief
And I don't tell lies
That's how they play it
Down on easy street
You can't win the game
If you don't cheat

Here in my pocket
There's a 38 special
Don't want to blow it
But you never can tell
The only language
That the world understands
Is a man on the edge
With a gun in his hand

I feel like I'm walking on the edge of
A knife
They say I'm crazy
But I'll tell you why
My world's on fire
My world's on fire
My world's on fire
My world's on fire

Doctors and lawyers
And rich man's sons
Think that they must be
The chosen ones
They use you
Abuse you and rob you blind
They sit counting your money
While they fuck
With your mind
Nobody listens and nobody cares
There's no prize for winners
And nobody cares
It's a total eclipse
On this side of the law
All that I know
I can't take any more

Feel like I'm walking on the edge of
A knife
They say I'm crazy
But I'll tell you why
My world's on fire
My world's on fire
My world's on fire
My world's on fire

I feel like I'm walking on the edge of
A knife
They say I'm crazy
But I'll tell you why
My world's on fire
My world's on fire
My world's on fire
My world's on fire
