Like a bird on a wire
Like a drunk in a midnight choir
I have tried in my way to be free

Like a fish on a hook
Like a line in some old fashion book
I have saved all my ribbons for thee

And if I, if I have been unkind
I just hope you will let it go by
And if I, if I have been untrue
I just hope you know it was never to you

Like a baby still born
Like a beast with it’s horns
I have torn everyone that reached out to me
But I swear by this song and by all I have done wrong
I’ll make it all up to thee

Saw a young man leaning on his wooden crutch
He called out to me don’t ask for so much
And a young woman leaning in her darkened door
She cried out to me why not ask for more

Like a bird on a wire
Like a drunk in a midnight choir
I have tried in my way to be free
