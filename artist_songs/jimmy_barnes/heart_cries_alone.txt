Oh I thought I heard your heart cry
Heard the tears deep inside
Where sadness was hiding before you realised
You can hide it with half a smile
But your eyes give you away
Shall I hold you for a while, I cannot stay

A heart cries alone when all is said and all is done
A heart turns to stone when all is shed and all is gone

I thought I heard your heart sigh on the day that he went away
You knew it was forever – sadness came to stay
So be silent and be still, if it’s only for today
Let me hold you for a while, on your way

A heart cries alone when all is said and all is done
A heart turns to stone when all is shed and all is gone

Courage my friend, got to bend with the wind
And all will be well, be well in the end

So be silent and be still, if it’s only for today
Let me hold you for a while, on your way

A heart cries alone when all is said and all is done
A heart turns to stone when all is shed and all is gone
I want to tell you baby
A heart cries alone when all is said and all is done
A heart turns to stone when all is shed and all is gone
