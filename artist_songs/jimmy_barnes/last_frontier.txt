Pushin’ ever westward, across the great divide
Beyond the darling river
Towards the outback sky

The lawless and the brave, searchin’ for a dream
When all they found was sand and stone
Where rivers once had been

They tried to follow nomads, like ghosts in desert dreams
And suffered in a sunburnt land…
Down in the last frontier

They sent them from the motherland
Into there greatest fear
To live and die for freedom’s cry
Down in the last frontier

A drover rides in search of work, across the sweeping plains
A farmer kneels in a hungry church
As his children prey for rain

Back in a land across the sea
They found another war
They asked the anzacs to believe
What there fightin’ for

They sent them to another land
Into there greatest fear
To fight and die for freedom’s cry
And for the last frontier

People in the lucky land, who searched for paradise
Are reachin’ out for somethin’ more
And don’t believe there lies

The promises of hope and work, still ringing in there ears
The hungry and homeless cry
Down in the last frontier
