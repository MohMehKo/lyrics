You and me are from different tribes
Never learned to talk so we learned to fight
Communication like water spilled
What we can’t take in, was lost or killed
We learned to live where we bore each child
Every step we took lost another mile
Came the day we were face to face
Didn’t understand so our instincts raced
If we don’t get together at all we lose it
Get to the table and talk, we’ll choose it
Forget what’s been said before confusing

Out of the heart of it all our future’s born
If we don’t look inside our souls, we could be gone
Forty thousand years underneath your belt
Now you have to pray where the white man knelt
You’ve been ridiculed because of what you felt
Tried to crucify you, but you fought like hell
The dreams that lead your every move
Full of stories you could never prove
If god is part of the written word
There are stories that your god ain’t heard
If we don’t get together at all we lose it
Get to the table and talk, we’ll choose it
Forget what’s been said before confusing
Out of the heart of it all our future’s born
If we don’t look inside our souls, we could be gone
Gone

If we don’t get together at all we lose it
Get to the table and talk, confuse it
Out of the heart of it all our future’s born
If we don’t look inside our souls, we could be gone
Out of the heart of it all our future’s born
If we don’t look inside our souls, we could be gone
Could be gone, gone, we could be gone
