Your blood runs hot as fire here, feel it bubbling in your brain
Your heart is pumping like the engine of a locomotive train
The hunger that you’re feeling girl, it can’t be satisfied
And no amount of concentration is going to get you
Off my mind

Because girl you do it to me
There ain’t no stopping once you’ve tried it
Just lose your head, can’t keep control

Searching for an answer to the longing in your life
You don’t even understand what’s happening inside
I’m making contact trust is the one thing you can’t see
You want to give it all away so you can finally breathe

So girl you do it to me
There ain’t no stopping once you’ve tried it
Just lose your head, can’t keep control
There ain’t no use girl, you can’t hide it
You lose your love and lose your soul

Baby look around and see, and then you listen to your heart
Don’t let it tear our love apart
All that I have, if it’s right or if it’s wrong
For me girl, this is over

All that you’re feeling girl it can’t be satisfied
And no amount of concentration is going to get you
Off my mind

So girl you do it to me
There ain’t no stopping once you’ve tried it
Just lose your head, can’t keep control
There ain’t no use girl, you can’t hide it
You lose your love and lose your soul
You do it to me
There ain’t no stopping once you’ve tried it
Just lose your head, can’t keep control
There ain’t no use girl, you can’t hide it
You lose your love and lose your soul
You do it to me
I said you do it to me
Said you do it to me
I said you do it to me
