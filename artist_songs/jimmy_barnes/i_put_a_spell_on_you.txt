I put a spell on you
Because you’re mine

Stop the things that you doing.
I ain’t lyin’, I, I ain’t lyin’.
You know I can’t stand it
When you walk around.
You know I can’t stand it
When you put me down.

I put a spell on you.
Because you’re mine,

I love you. I love you. I love you!
Anyhow
I don’t care if you don’t want me
I love you, all the time
I put a spell on you.
Because you’re mine
