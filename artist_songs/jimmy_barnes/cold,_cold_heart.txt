I tried so hard my dear to show
That you’re my every dream
But you’re afraid each thing I do
Is just some evil scream
A memory’s proud your lonesome past
Keeps us so far apart
Why can’t I free your doubtful mind
And milk your cold, cold heart

I never loved in all my time
Made your heart sad and blue
And so my heart it’s paying now
For things I didn’t do
In anger unkind words were said
To make the tear drops start
Why can’t I free your doubtful mind
And milk your cold, cold heart

You’ll never know how much it hurts
To see you sit and cry
You know you need and want my love
Yet you’re afraid to try
Why do you run and hide from life
To try it just ain’t smart
Why can’t I free your doubtful mind
And milk your cold, cold heart

If you only knew baby how I felt about you
You have broken my heart over and over again
I don’t know how I can live without you
My memory has a way of catching up with time
Looking back over the years
I wonder how I ever feel in love with you
Look at what you’ve done to me

Now there was a time when I believed
That you belonged to me
(it’s all yours jim)
Now I know this heart is shackled
To a memory
The more I learn to care for you
The more we drift apart
Why can’t I free your doubtful mind
And milk your cold, cold heart
