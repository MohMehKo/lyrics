Your faith is tested each and every day
What is now is gonna fade away
All the ones that you trusted
All in their turn, add fuel to the fire
In which you burn

Don’t take too much imagination to see
Things ain’t right
When you think that your through
That’s when they got you in their sights

Going down alone just a matter of time
All you can get is what I’m leaving behind
You live a lie but I can’t seem to live that way
Now the bird has flown
Going down alone

There’s a light that’s shining beyond the grey
But you wake up in a pool of sweat to face another day
In need of some consideration that don’t come your way
Enjoy the crime, do the time
That’s the price you gotta pay

Going down alone just a matter of time
All you can get is what I’m leaving behind
You live a lie but I can’t seem to live that way
Now the bird has flown
Going down alone

Well times like these you’d think that
Everybody’s gotta find someone
But I can’t find myself I hope and I pray
Somebody’s gonna shine a light for me

You live a lie but I can’t seem to live that way

Going down alone just a matter of time
All you can get is what I’m leaving behind
You live a lie but I can’t seem to live that way
Now the bird has flown
Going down alone
