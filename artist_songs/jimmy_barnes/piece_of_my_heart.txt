I wantcha ta come on, come on, come on, come on
Didn't I make you feel
You were the only one
Didn't I tell nearly everything that a woman posably can
Each time I tell myself that I
I think I’ve had enough
I ganna show you baby that a man he can be tough

I want you to come on, come on, come on, come on
And take it
Take another little piece of my heart now baby
Brake it
Brake another little piece of my heart now darlin'
Come on
Take another little piece of my heart now baby
You know you've got it, makes you feel good

You're out on the street, looking good
And you know deep down in your heart
That it ain’t right
Hear me baby when I cry for you at night

Each time I tell myself that I
I can stand the pain
But when you hold me in your arms
I say it once again
I want you to come on, come on, come on, come on
And take it
Take another little piece of my heart now baby
Brake it
Brake another little piece of my heart well darlin'
Come on
Take another little piece of my heart now baby
You know you've got it, it makes you feel good

Want ya to come on, come on, come on, come on
And take it
Take another little piece of my heart now baby
Brake it
Brake another little piece of my heart well darlin'
Come on
Take another little piece of my heart now baby
You know you've got it
Take it
Take another little piece of my heart now baby
Brake it
Brake another little piece of my heart well darlin'
Come on
Take another little piece of my heart now baby
You know you've got it, if it makes you feel good
