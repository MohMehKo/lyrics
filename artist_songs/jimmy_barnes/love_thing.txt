Went to the doctor to see what he would say
Told him I couldn’t sleep my heart was racking with pain
Broke out in a cold sweat lying in my bed
My mouth was dry
My fever high had a spinnin’ in my head

Can’t find a single thing to take away the pain
Everything I tried to do, I tried and tried again
But all it seems to do is take away my pride
I looked for you, but whats the use
Your loving ain’t prescribed

It’s a love thing, that’s what I got
It’s a love thing, no there ain’t no shots
It’s a love thing, never been no cure
The only thing to cure my ills, is make sweet love to you

Three weeks later, I don’t feel I’ve improved
No matter what I do, I can’t get close to you
Can’t find no treatment, no major surgery
To take away the empty space and put you next to me

It’s a love thing, lyin’ on my own
It’s a love thing, waiting by the phone
It’s a love thing, I don’t need no nurse
Gonna help this man
Hold his hand only makes it worse

That thing that makes him heal
But no matter how I try I feel
That you just want to play this game with me

Now you and I have finally put things right
But I still need to dream, morning, noon and night
I feel much better than I ever did before
No matter how I try
I seem to find I just can’t get off the floor

It’s a love thing, that’s what I got
It’s a love thing, no there ain’t no shots
It’s a love thing, never been no cure
The only thing to cure my ills, is make sweet love to you
It’s a love thing, lyin’ on my own
It’s a love thing, waiting by the phone
It’s a love thing, I don’t need no nurse
Gonna help this man
Hold his hand only makes it worse
It’s a love thing, that’s what I got
It’s a love thing, no there ain’t no shots
It’s a love thing, never been no cure
