I will not lay down with just a whimper
I will not be strong because it’s simpler

And time will tell, that in life’s empty well
Love can stop the thirst, if you can find some

I will not be told because I’m not waiting
No sacrifice can take away the hating

And time will tell, that in life’s empty well
Love can stop the thirst, if you can find some

Only time will tell

And time will tell, that in life’s empty well
Love can stop the thirst, if you can find some

Time will tell, time will tell, time is going to tell
Time will tell, time will tell, time is going to tell
Time will tell, time will tell, time is going to tell
Time will tell, time will tell, time is going to tell

Am I too late now, I guess only time will tell
Am I too late now, I guess only time will tell
