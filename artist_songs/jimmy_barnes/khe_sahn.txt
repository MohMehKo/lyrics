I left my heart to the sappers round khe sahn
And I sold my soul with my cigarettes to the black market man
I've had the vietnam cold turkey
from the ocean to the silver city
And it's only other vets can understand
About the long forgotten dock side guarantee
How there were no v-day heros in 1973
And how we sailed into sydney harbour I saw an old friend but I couldn't kiss her
We were lined and I was home to the lucky land
We were like so many more from that time on
Their lives were all so empty 'till they found their chosen one
And their legs were often open but their minds were always closed
And their hearts were held in fast surburban chains.
The legal pads were yellow hours long pay packet lean
And the telex-writers clattered where the gun ships once had been
And carparks made me jumpy, but I never stopped the dream for the growing need of speed and novacaine.
So I worked across the country from end to end
Trying to find a place to settle down where my mixed up life could end
Held a job on an oil rig, flying choppers when I could
But the night life nearly drove me round the bend.
And I travelled round the world from year to year
Each one found me aimless one more year the worst for ware
And I've been back to south east asia
You know the answer sure ain't there
But I'm drifting north to check things out again

Well the last plane out of sydney's almost gone
In 7 flying hours we'll be landing in Hong Kong
And there ain't nothing like the kisses from a jaded chinese princess
I'm gonna hit some Hong Kong matress all night long

Well the last plane out of sydney's almost gone
Well the last plane out of sydney's almost gone
And it's really got me worried
I'm going nowhere and I'm in a hurry
You know the last plane out of sydney's almost gone

Well the last plane out of sydney's almost gone oh yeah
Well the last plane out of sydney's almost gone woahhhhhhh
And it's really got me worried
I'm going nowhere and I'm in a hurry
You know the last plane out of sydney's almost gone.
