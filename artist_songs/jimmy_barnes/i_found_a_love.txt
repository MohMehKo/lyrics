I found a love, I found a love
I found a love that I need,
I found a kiss I just wanna tell you girl I can’t resist
I found a love that I need,
And sometimes I call her now
I said

The way the woman walk, you know she looks so fine
The way the woman talk, she’s my hearts desire
But if she leave me, I say I would die
Sometimes I’ll call her in the midnight hour
Don’t leave me baby
