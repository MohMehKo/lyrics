I looked for love and I was tired of searching
Thought I’d had enough
I had a dream but it was slowly fading
Seen but never touched

It must be wrong I need some affection
Can’t live my life alone

Give me love and devotion
And let the loving start

I washed my hands of loves situations
I kept it to myself
Was holding back but I wasn’t saving
My love for no one else

Just take my time and show my intentions
And wait for love to grow

Give me love and devotion
That’s what I need straight from the heart
You gotta show some emotion
And let the loving start

Every day I look around my world
Every day I fall apart
But I know that you’re there somewhere
For my heart

It must be wrong I need some affection
Can’t live my life alone

Give me love and devotion
That’s what I need straight from the heart
You gotta show some emotion
And let the loving start
