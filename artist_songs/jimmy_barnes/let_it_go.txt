Still thinking beautiful thoughts about you
Sometimes I wonder if you still think about me too
I hear that you have been seeing someone else
I get unreasonable when I’m talkin’ to myself
Let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go

I’m not feeling comfortable, I’m still feeling sad
‘Cause I know that I’m responsible
For the troubles that we had
Let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go

When I look into my heart, lord I know
Give it up and walk away, let it go
Tryin’ to live without you is a new experience
But this new way I feel about you
Oh baby, it’s starting to make sense
Let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go
