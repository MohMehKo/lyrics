When I am down your lovin’ lifts me up
Makes me feel I need no more
And when I’m up you take me higher still
Than I’ve ever been before
You fill me with your heart and soul
Empty the one they be
And when I’m blinded by the light
It’s you that let’s me see

Well when I look into my soul
I feel so afraid because I know that I’m
Not worthy
You deserve an angel by your side
And I don’t know why
I don’t see how you could settle for me

But take me up there to be by your side
Help me serve you as I should

You shown me love now in a whole new light
Like I never know you could
You fill me with your heart and soul
Empty the one they be
And when I’m blinded by the light
It’s you that let’s me see

Well when I look into my soul
I feel so afraid because I know that I’m
Not worthy
You deserve an angel by your side
And I don’t know why
I don’t see how you could settle for me

But take me up there to be by your side
Help me serve you as I should
You shown me love now in a whole new light
Like I never know you could
I thank god
I thank god
Thank god
You settle for me
