Well it’s late at night something just ain’t right
I can tell by the look in your eye
You don’t say two words
You got a stare that burns
It’s gonna be a long long night
Giving me no quarter
When you know you oughta
It’s a sin they way you push me around
Yeah you put me down all over town
Did my best I never passed your test

Take your shot give all you’ve got
Have your fun and I'll just turn and run

Baby take a hard line
For the last time
Baby take a hard line
I’ll be better off in the long run

I can take the pressure
If that’s what gives you pleasure
And I don’t mind if you wanna fight
You’ll get no resistance
‘cause two wrongs never make a right
I think we lost control
It’s gonna take it’s toll
I don’t wanna be your wipping boy
This is our last chance
It’s time to make a stand
Come girl can’t we say we’re sorry

Take your shot give all you’ve got
Have your fun and I'll just turn and run

Baby take a hard line
For the last time
Baby take a hard line
I’ll be better off in the long run

Come on darling
Tell me what are you waiting for
You’re the only one
Who can pick me off of the floor
