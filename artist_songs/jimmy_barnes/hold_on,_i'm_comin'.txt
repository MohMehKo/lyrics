Now don't you ever feel sad
Lean on me
When times are bad
When the day comes and you're down
In a river of trouble darling
And you want me around
Hold on
I'm coming
Hold on
I'm coming
I'm on my way, your lover
When it gets cold I'll be your cover
Don't have a worry
Cause I'm here
No need to suffer darling
Hold on
I'm coming
Hold on
I'm coming
Hold on
I'm coming
Hold on
I'm coming
Reach out for me for satisfaction, yeah
Call my name and you'll start a chain reaction
Eh eh ohh
Now don't you ever feel sad
Lean on me
When times get bad
When the day comes and you're down
In a river of trouble darling
And you want me around
Hold on
I'm coming
Hold on
I'm coming
Hold on
I'm coming
Hold on
I'm coming
Baby hold on . . .
