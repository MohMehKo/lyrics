I've been trying to make amends
I've been trying to choose a better path
I know I can't change what's been done
But I'll face up to it
I don't wanna run

It's hard to look at my mistakes
And I know I've made a lot of them
Burned some bridges in the past
But I'm gonna try and make sure they're the last

Can you find forgiveness?
Can you forget the past?

I've been looking straight ahead
I'm trying to see what can be positive
'cause what's behind me can't be changed
And it won't get any better holding blame

Can you find forgiveness?
Can you forget the past?

I'm leaving it all
When I travel to the other side
And I wanna have you
Forever in my heart
You're my life

Can you find forgiveness?
Can you forget the past?
Can you find forgiveness?
Can you forget the past?
Can you find forgiveness?
Can you forget the past?
