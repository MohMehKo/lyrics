Been a while since I saw your face
Since you left without a trace
And left me with a pain in my heart
I don’t know the reason why
I’m standing here alone still crying
Wondering if you’ve made a new start

Baby I can’t sleep at night, another evening slips on by
I toss and turn just thinking of you
I can’t go out find someone new
There’s not a girl in the world will do
For you my heart will always be true

Should have known you felt alone when you’re
On your own, but you never told me
Why did you hide when you used to cry and you
Had to lie, while you stand alone and cry
All I own is a memory of a love gone cold

At the start I just kept denying
In the dark all alone I’m crying
Hopping that you’re changing your mind
Can’t you feel all the love that I’m sending
Am I wrong still to be pretending
Have we really ran out of time

Should have known you felt alone when you’re
On your own, but you never told me
Why did you hide when you used to cry when I lied
You’d just stand alone and cry
All I own is a memory of a love gone cold
All I own is a memory of a love gone cold

I can’t take it girl, there’s no tomorrow
Well I can’t make it through one more day alone
All I own is a memory of a love gone cold
All I own is a memory of a love gone cold
All I own is a memory of a love gone cold
All I own is a memory of a love gone cold
All I own is a memory of a love gone cold
All I own is a memory of a love gone cold
