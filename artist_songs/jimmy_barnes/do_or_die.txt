Am I too young, am I too old
I really don’t know when I’m told
No one here can tell me what to do
If I’d have listened once or twice
And maybe taken their advise
Everything would happen very soon

But let me tell you one and all
I’m the kind that just can’t wait in line
Never one to question why
Walk straight in, I always do or die

Well you can knock me down
But don’t count me out
When it all comes down to the final round
You’re gonna see the best come out of me
And I know in faith, we all must trust
But I’ve seen you faith turn to lust
And every now and then, I clearly see

Let me tell you one and all
I’m the kind that just can’t start a fight
But if trouble’s what your looking for
Walk straight in, I always do or die
Left alone I know I’ll get by
Still I stand, and I know I still do or die

Let me tell you one and all
I’m the kind that just can’t wait in line
Never one to question why
Walk straight in
I always walk straight in
Do or die
Do or die
