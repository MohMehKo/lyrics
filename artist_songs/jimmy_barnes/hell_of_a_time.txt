Don’t ask me ‘bout the things I’ve done
Can’t tell you who lost or won
All I know is
I had a hell of a time

Don’t ask me ‘bout where I’ve been
I can’t explain the things I’ve seen
But I can tell you
I’ve had a hell of a time

I bought a ticket and I took the ride
Now I can’t get of
Heaven knows I’ve tried and tried
You see it written on my face
A touch of grief, a brush with grace
You can see it in my eyes
I had a hell of a time
A hell of a time

Got what I asked for, can’t complain
It’s true, you cannot know real pleasure
Without pain
Don’t try to change my destiny
Or tell me what is best for me
It should come as no surprise
I’ve had a hell of a time
A hell of a time
I had a hell of a time
A hell of a time
I had a hell of a time
A hell of a time
I had a hell of a time
A hell of a time
