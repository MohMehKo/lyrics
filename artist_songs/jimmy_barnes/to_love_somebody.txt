There’s a light
A certain kind of light
That never shone on me
I want my life to be spent with you
Spent with you
There’s a way everybody says
To do each and everything
Oh, what goods everything
If I ain’t got you babe, I ain’t got you babe

You don’t know what it’s like baby
You don’t know what it’s like
To love somebody
To love somebody
The way I love you

In my brain
I know I’ll see your face again
Because in my frame of mind
You ain’t got to be so blind
And I’m crying I’m dying
‘Cause I’m a man look at all I am
I live and breath for you
But what good does that do
If I ain’t got you baby, I ain’t got you baby

You don’t know what it’s like baby
You don’t know what it’s like
To love somebody
To love somebody
The way I love you

You don’t know what it’s like baby
You don’t know what it’s like
To love somebody
To love somebody
The way I love you

You don’t know what it’s like baby
You don’t know what it’s like

To love somebody
To love somebody
The way I love you
Love somebody
