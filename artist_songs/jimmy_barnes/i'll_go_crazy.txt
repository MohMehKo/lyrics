If you leave me, I'll go crazy,
If you leave me, I'll go crazy,
'cause I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you too much

If you push me, I'll go crazy,
If you push me, I'll go crazy,
'Cause I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you too much

You got to live for yourself
Yourself and nobody else
You got to live for yourself
Yourself and nobody else

If you quit me, I'll go crazy,
If you quit me, I'll go crazy,
'Cause I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you too much

You got to live for yourself
Yourself and nobody else
You got to live for yourself
Yourself and nobody else

You got to live for yourself
Yourself and nobody else
You got to live for yourself
Yourself and nobody else

If you leave me, I'll go crazy,
If you leave me, I'll go crazy,
'Cause I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you too much

If you leave me, I'll go crazy,
If you leave me I'll go crazy
'Cause I love you, I love you
Oh I love you too much
