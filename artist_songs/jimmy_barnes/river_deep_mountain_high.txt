When you was a little girl
Did you had a rag doll
Only one you ever owned
Well I love you just the way you loved that rag doll
But only now my love has grown (yeah man)

And it gets stronger, as the river flows
And it gets deeper, heaven knows
And it gets wider baby, as the river flows

And do I love you my oh my
Yeh river deep mountain high  Yeah, yeah, yeah
If I lost you would I cry
Oh how I love you baby, baby, baby, baby

When you were a young girl
Did you have a puppy
That always followed you around
Well I'm gonna be as faithful as that puppy
My love will never let you down

And it grows stronger, like a river flows
And it gets deeper baby, and heaven knows
And it gets wider baby, as the river flows

And do I love you my oh my
Yeh river deep, mountain high, Yeah yeah yeah
If I lost you would I cry
Oh how I love you baby, baby, baby, baby

Mmmmmmmmm
I love you baby like a flower loves the spring
And I love you baby just like Robin loves to sing
And I love you baby like a school boy loves his sight
And I love you baby, river deep mountain high

Woah, Oohhhh, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oooohhhhhh

Do I love you my oh my
I said River deep, mountain high
If I lost you would I cry, yeah
Oh how I love you baby, baby, baby, baby
