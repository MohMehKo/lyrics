Many rivers to cross
But I can't seem to find my way
Wandering, I'm lost
As I travel along the white cliffs of Dover

Many rivers to cross
And it's only my will that keeps me alive
I've been licked, washed up for years
And I merely survive because of my pride

And this loneliness won't leave me alone
It's such a drag to be on your own
My woman left, and she didn't say why
Well, I guess, I've got to try

(I've got) many rivers to cross (rivers to cross)
But just where to begin, I'm playing for time
(I've got) there'll be times when I find myself (rivers to cross)
Thinking of committing some dreadful crime

(I've got) many rivers to cross (rivers to cross)
But I can't seem to find my way home
(I've got) wandering, I am lost (rivers to cross)
As I travel along the white cliffs of Dover

(I've got) many rivers to cross (rivers to cross)
And it's only my will that keeps me alive
I've been licked, washed up for my years (rivers to cross)
And I merely survive because of my pride

And this loneliness won't leave me alone
It's such a drag to be on your own
My woman left, and she didn't say why
Well, I guess, I've got to try

(I've got) many rivers to cross (rivers to cross)
But I can't seem to find my way home
(I've got) wandering, I'm lost (rivers to cross)
As I travel along the white cliffs of Dover

Cause I've got many, many rivers to cross
(I've got) wandering, I'm lost (rivers to cross)
(I've got) many, many rivers to cross

(I've got many rivers to cross)
(I've got many rivers to cross)
Many, many, many, many (rivers to cross)
