Your love, is liftin' me higher
Than I've ever been lifted before
So keep it up, quench my desire
And I'll be at your side forevermore

You know your love
Keeps on liftin'
Liftin' me higher and higher
You know your love, keeps on
Liftin’ me higher and higher

Now once, I was downhearted
Disappointment was my closest friend
Then you came and he soon departed
And you know he never ever showed his face again

You know your love
Keeps on liftin'
Liftin' me higher and higher
You know your love, keeps on
Liftin’ me higher and higher

Well I'm so glad that I found you
Yes that one, in a million girl
Now with my lovin', lovin’ arms around you
I can stand up and face the world

You know your love
Keeps on liftin'
Liftin' me higher and higher
You know your love, keeps on
Liftin’ me higher and higher

You know your love
Keeps on liftin' me
Liftin' me higher and higher
Know your love, keeps on
Liftin’ me higher and higher
