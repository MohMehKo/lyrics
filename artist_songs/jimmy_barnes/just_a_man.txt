Sometimes I feel just like jesus christ
I’m nailed to the wall I must pay the price
No revelations and so set of rules
Stand where I fall, next to kings next to fools

When I look at myself I don’t like what I see
What a real fine example for life I must be

I’m just a man who has problems I must solve on my own
The deeper I reach I find the more they unroll

I’m just a man like the next guy, all I have I have shown
I know I can make it through this whole life alone

I hide from the lights as I look to the ground
I almost believe there’s no one around

It’s funny how you look at things
When you don’t like what you see
Sure enough the world will turn
Sometimes without me

I’m just a man who has problems I must solve on my own
The deeper I reach I find the more they unroll

I’m just a man like the next guy, all I have I have shown
I know I can make it through this whole life alone

But if I had a chance to do it all again
You know I would, if I only could

Yeah but the best things in life are yet to come
Won’t you bring them on now
I won’t be alone, not for too long

I’m just a man who has problems I must solve on my own
The deeper I reach I find the more they unroll

I’m just a man like the next guy, all I have I have shown
I know I can make it through this whole life alone
