Lock the door
Shut the window tight
I close the curtains
Just got to block out the light
I feel the sun
Shining in my eyes
I'm just trying to cover up a little bit of daylight

Hide my face
I don't want to be seen
Is there somebody out there
Am I awake or asleep
I feel the sun shining in my eyes
I'm just tying to cover up a little bit of daylight

I suppose I should get out of bed 
Not sleep all day
I should get up 
Get out of the house
But not till the end of day

Little bit of daylight
Little bit of daylight
Little bit of daylight
Little bit of daylight

Well I'm just trying to cover up a little bit of daylight
Yes I am
Well I'm just trying to cover up a little bit of daylight
Yes I am.

I've got to cover up
Hide a little daylight
Stay out all night and all
