Now you finished schooling
Think you know it all
I’ve got something to teach you
You never learned before

Lesson number one, gonna have some fun
Lesson number two, I’m in love with you
Lesson number three, gonna set you free
Lesson number four, that’s when I give you more
This is a lesson in love
This is a lesson in love
And given half the chance, I’ll teach you ‘bout romance
This is a lesson, a lesson in love

Well I been doin’ my homework
And stayin’ up all night
And your not though with your studies baby
Untill we get it right

Lesson number one, I’m a loaded gun
Lesson number two, when I aim for you
This is a lesson in love, this is a lesson in love
When passion starts to burn
Then you begin to learn
About the lessons, the lessons in love
This is a lesson in love
This is a lesson in love
This is a lesson in love
This is a lesson in love
This is a lesson in love
This is a lesson in love
And if your’re learnin’ fast
I’ll keep you after class
For another lesson in love
