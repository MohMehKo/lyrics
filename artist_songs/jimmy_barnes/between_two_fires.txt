You ain’t no down home loving kind
But you can turn those heads
When you walk in a crowded room
All the men wanna have ya
But the girls want you dead
They say you had every man in town
And you turned your sights on me
You tear my defenses down
You can make me smile or give me misery

Caught between two fires
And I know you can see what you put me though
Caught between two fires
And I know I'm gonna burn
I’m on fire over you

Your blood runs burning hot
But you got a heart that’s cold
You’re taking everything I got
And you won’t be satisfied
Till you’ve got my soul

Caught between two fires
Losing control since I first met you
Caught between two fires
I’m gonna burn in hell
‘Cause I'm on fire over you

Girl I can’t walk away
‘Cause I can’t live without you anyway
And I gotta see this though
Nothing can stop me girl I'd die for you

Caught between two fires
And I know you can see what you put me though
Caught between two fires
And I know I'm gonna burn
I’m on fire over you

Caught between two fires
Losing control since I first met you
Caught between two fires
I’m gonna burn in hell
‘Cause I'm on fire over you
