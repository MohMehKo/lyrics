I got taken all the way down
She was high class from a low town
She wore makeup under a frown
And that cinnamon way she said

I’ve had enough of you telling me you’ve had enough
The only time that we touch is when push turns to shove
The only thing I feel is a sickened sensation
I’m watching you drown in your own medication

Say it ain't so
If ya feel that you leaven me I think I’ll go
It smells like gold
And there’s a real reason leavin’ me alone
Say it ain’t so

Took me in the dark and let me lose, sad
Whispered in my ear baby don’t you do it
Everybody knows your way
I guess I’ll go and smile another day

Say it ain't so
If ya feel that you leaven me I think I’ll go
It smells like gold
And there’s a real reason leavin’ me alone
Say it ain’t so

For something so good to stop and end up turning so bad
And I awaken in my bad wondering what we once had
Instead of swimming in love I know I am sinking
Instead of hopin’ and preyin’ I’m crying and drinkin’

Say it ain't so
If ya feel that you leaven me I think I’ll go
It smells like gold
And there’s a real reason leavin’ me alone
Say it ain’t so

I had enough of you telling me
Every time that we touched

Say it ain't so
If ya feel that you leaven me I think I’ll go
It smells like gold
And there’s a real reason leavin’ me alone
Say it ain’t so
