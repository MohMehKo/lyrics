The best things in life are free
But you can give it to the birds and bees
I want money, that’s what I want
That’s what I want,
Oh yeah that’s what I want

Your love gives me such a thrill
But your lovin’ don’t pay my bills
I need money, that’s what I want
That’s what I want,
Oh yeah that’s what I want

And money don’t get everything that’s true
But what it don’t get I can’t use
I need money, that’s what I want
That’s what I want,
Oh yeah that’s what I want

I need money now
I need money
I want it babe
All that money
That’s what I want
Money that’s what I want
Money
Money
Money
I want money now
That’s what I want, oh yeah that’s what I want
