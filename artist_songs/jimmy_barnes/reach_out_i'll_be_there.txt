Now if you feel that you can’t go on
Because all your love is gone
And your love is filled with confusion
And your happiness is just an illusion
And your world around is tumblin’ down
Darling, reach out
Reach out, for me
Reach out

I’ll be there for a love that will shelter you
I’ll be there with the love that will see you though

If you are lost and about to give up
And your hope just ain’t good enough
And the world around has all gone cold
And you’re drifting out on your own
And you need a hand to hold
Darling, reach out
Come on reach out for me now
Reach out
Just look over your shoulder baby com’n

I’ll be there with a love to shelter you
I’ll be there with the love that will shelter you

I can tell the way you hang your head
You’re alone, and now you’re afraid
And the world around is tumbling down
But there’s no peace of mind to be found
You’re lost and now you’re alone
Darling, reach out
Come on reach out for me now
Reach out
Just look over your shoulder

I’ll be there for a love that will shelter you
I’ll be there with the love that will see you though
I’ll be there with a love to shelter you
I’ll be there with the love that will shelter you
