Hard as a rock you have made your heart
And your so sure that it’s me to blame
How can you lose when you hold all the card
But who can win at a losin’ game
You told me that I had to live without you
Hey loneliness is no stranger to my life
And I’ll know you’ll get by

I’ve been waitin’ for the heartache to come
I’ve been waitin’ for the tears to start to fall
I’ve been waitin’ for the heartache to come
But it don’t come at all
No it don’t come at all

I’m wide awake and I feel no pain
Lyin’ alone in this bed of thorns
Headlights scream on these walls like flames
Is this the calm just before the storm
I thought that I could never live without you
Funny how things change when life says jump
You’r not the only one

I’ve been waitin’ for the heartache to come
I’ve been waitin’ for the tears to start to fall
I’ve been waitin’ for the heartache to come
But it don’t come at all
It don’t come at all

I thought I was headed for a broken heart
But a heart can fall so far and not apart
I’m lyin’ in the dark

I’ve been waitin’ for the heartache to come
I’ve been waitin’ for the tears to start to fall
I’ve been waitin’ for the heartache to come
But it don’t come at all
I’m not reaching out for you in the night
But something deep inside me says it’s alright
I’ve been waitin’ for the heartache to come
But it don’t come at all
It don’t come at all
No it don’t come at all
No it don’t come at all
No it don’t come at all
