I heard a rumour yesterday
I don’t believe a word they say
All that I can do is pray
You’re not wanting it this way

I try my best to stay alive
I’m alone most of the time
Got to try and make you stay
Because I wanted it this way

I put my heart into your hand
But you don’t seem to understand
You can still push me away
Because you wanted it this way

I heard a rumour yesterday
I don’t believe a word they say
All that I can do is pray
You’re not wanting it this way
