Well you don’t know what’s going on
You’ve been away for far too long
You can’t come back and think you are still mine
You’re out of touch
My baby my poor discarded baby

Said baby, baby, baby you’re out of time
Well baby, baby, baby you’re out of time
I said baby, baby, baby you’re out of time
Ya all left out
I think you’re out of there without a doubt
Baby, baby, baby, you’re out of time

You thought you were the special girl
Given up your social whirl
But you can’t come back
Thinking you are the first in line
You're obsolete my baby
My poor old fashioned baby
I said baby, baby, baby you’re out of time

Well baby, baby, baby you’re out of time
I said baby, baby, baby you’re out of time
Ya all left out here without a doubt
Baby, baby, baby you’re out of time

You're obsolete my baby
My poor old fashioned baby

I said baby, baby, baby
You’re out of time
Well baby, baby, baby
You’re out of time
I said baby, baby, baby
You’re out of time
I think you’re out of here without a doubt
Baby, baby, baby, you’re out of time

Baby, baby, baby
You’re out of time
I said baby, baby, baby
You’re out of time
I think you’re out of here without a doubt
Baby, baby, baby, you’re out of time
