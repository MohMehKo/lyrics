I know fences stand for fools who wander about the other side
Holding back the tears with heartache standing next in line
Loneliness is cold because you think that it will never end
Wind cuts to your bone because you’d rather break than bend

But by the grace of god I found you, and it all comes clear
I thank god that you’re here in my life

I know that time can’t tear away all the memory of happiness
Somehow swept away, all unrequited left unblessed

But by the grace of god I found you, somehow here with me
Now I know I see the light
But by the grace of god I found you, and it all comes clear
I thank god that you’re here in my life

I was on the road for so long
No matter how far down I go

But by the grace of god I found you, somehow here with me
Now I know I see the light
But by the grace of god I found you, and it all comes clear
I thank god that you’re here in my life

But by the grace of god I found you
Now I know I see the light
I want to thank you baby
