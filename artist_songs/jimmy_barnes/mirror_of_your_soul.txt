Alone again, me and you
Another day, another broken promise too
If I could believe a word you’d say
Id try my best to never let it slip away

When you look at your reflection
Is the face that you see your own

Well you can try to hide, you can try to lie
But your eyes are the mirror of your soul
You can walk away, try to make me pay
But your eyes are the mirror of your soul

There’s no one else to hear you lie
You never could hold back the truth when it’s you and I

I can live all by myself if you say that it must be so
I can cry alone at night
Yeah when I’m on my own

Well you can try to hide, you can try to lie
But your eyes are the mirror of your soul
You can walk away, try to make me pay
But your eyes are the mirror of your soul

Well here we are we play the game
I give you take it always seems to end the same
There’s nothing left you win I’m beat
My life is crushed and shattered underneath your feet

Well you can try to hide,
You can try to lie
But your eyes are the mirror of your soul
You can walk away, try to make me pay
But your eyes are the mirror of your soul
