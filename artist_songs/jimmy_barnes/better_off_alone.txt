I can't tell you when to breathe girl
You got to do it on your own
You can't tell me what I need girl
'Cause I need to be alone

Yeah you can sit and cry
And I'll just wonder why
I let this love of ours start to lose control
So while I walk away, I've just got one thing to say
Girl you'd be better off alone

It all started out so nice girl
You had your place and I had mine
But it twisted and entwined girl
You waved you hand, I jumped in time

But now I've had enough,
Just leave before it gets too tough
We're better to have loved then travelled on alone
So while I walk away, I've just got one thing to say
Girl you'd be better off alone

Yeah I know that you're feeling sad girl
But your feelings are your own
Maybe I'm just going mad girl
But I might drink until you've gone

Hell what's the use of pain?
There's nothing left that we can gain
Let's just sever ties, no excuses or long goodbyes
So until we meet again
Don't find yourself another friend
Girl you'd be better off alone
