Oh, well I’ve got one more remaining hour
With you in this dusty room
And you know that just like some plastic flowers
You just never see them bloom
Oh I burned the candle for you so many times
You know they never burn too slow
And I’ve still got a long way to go

I came across a wise man
Seemed that he might understand
Promised that he would lighten up my load
(yes he did now) I put my money in his hand
Thought he was a ticket man
Sent me off down the road
Well I put my trust in oh so many a man
Never tell who’s friend or foe
And I’ve still got a long way to go

Time can be so hard
Ain’t no shuffling of the cards that you dealt
This I know, now I know
I walked though fields of snow
Feeling warm from the after-glow
I thought I’d never feel the cold
And you know that I saw a star up in the sky
Felt that it could be mine
Instead it was the king of rock’n’roll
Yeah and things aren’t always quite as they seem, no
I’d paid nothing to see the show
And I’ve still got a long way to go
Still got a long way
Still got a long way
Listen now, I’ve still got a long way
Still got a long way
Still got a long way
Still got a long way
I’ve still got a long way
Still got a long way
Still got a long way
Still got a long way
I’ve still got a long way to go
