You see her on the tv after ten
She’s the one who’s dressed in the leopard skin
She’ll whisper to you as you turn her on
As she pulls her leathers to her chin
She says I’m holding on, i’m holding on

You put her number by the telephone
And you call her up when you’re all alone
She’ll tell you tales, they’re going to make you sweat
All you have to do is make her moan
She says I’m holding on, I’m holding on

(temptation)
I want to be your inspiration, I want you to be mine
(temptation)
I want to be your inspiration, I want you to be mine

She’ll share the ecstacy on that line
Shut your eyes and fantasize
Does she remind you of somebody else
All you have to do is close your eyes

I want to be your temptation
I want to be your inspiration, I want you to be mine
I want to be your temptation
I want to be your inspiration, I want you to be mine
I want to be your temptation
I want to be your temptation
I want to be your temptation
So tell me what you wanna
I want to be your temptation
