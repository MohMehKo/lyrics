Is it so hard to understand?
Looking at this broken man
How'd I ever come to be
The person staring back at me

Water wash all over me
Squeeze me 'till I cannot breathe
Blind me so I cannot see
Water wash all over me

I made my bed here on the floor
'cause she don't live here anymore
And only hope can dry my eyes
And only love can take away the pain I feel inside

Water wash all over me
Squeeze me 'till I cannot breathe
Blind me so I cannot see
Water wash all over me

Water wash all over me
Take away the pain I feel
I'm not the man I used to be
Water wash all over me

Tears of hope run like the tied,
Every time I close my eyes
And I dream of better times,
When you were mine

The morning sun just leaves me cold
The bitter taste of daylight only reeks of truth untold

Water wash all over me
Squeeze me 'till I cannot breathe
Blind me so I cannot see
Water wash all over me

Water wash all over me
Take away the pain I feel
I'm not the man I used to be
Water wash all over me

Wash all over me
