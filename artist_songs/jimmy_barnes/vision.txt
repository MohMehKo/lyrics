No time to delay
Now I know that
You'll be back this way

Heart beating stronger now
Can't wait much longer now
They'll never change
The way I feel for you

You look like an angel
Vision coming down
From the sky

I feel the the wind rising now
Heart sympathising now
They'll never change
The way I feel for you

I run and hide
And I go
With nowhere in sight
If you'd only come back to me
You'll never be alone
Yoy knowe our love
Is like a vision
Vision coming down
Coming down from the sky
Know you'll never change
The way I feel for you

Don't change
Don't change

My vision of you
