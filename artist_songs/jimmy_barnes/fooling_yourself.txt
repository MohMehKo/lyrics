When you were in your mother’s arms
Got all you wanted with your charm
And as you grew all that you’d need
Fell like a miracle at your feet

Breaking up all that held you down
Under your smile there was a frown

I don’t think you had it planned
I don’t think you understand

When you first felt that you’d been wrong
You kept it hidden all along
Yeah you just smiled and stood your ground
Knowing your secret would be found

Hiding your feelings from yourself
Hurting was kept for someone else
I don’t think you had it planned
I don’t think you understand

I’ve seen you go from right to wrong
Watching you find where you belong
There’s a time just a
Moment of truth will you fall

Breaking up all that held you down
Under your smile there was a frown
Hiding your feelings from yourself
Hurting was kept for someone else

I don’t think you had it planned
I don’t think you understand
