Well you make me wanna shout
Kick my heals up and shout
Through my hands up and shout
Through my head back and shout
Come on now shout
Don’t forget to say you will
Don’t forget to say yeah, yeah, yeah
Say you will say it right now baby
Say you will come on come on
Say you will come on and say you will
Say you will you got it now

Say that you love me
Say that you need me
Say that you want me
Say you want to please me
Say come on now
Say come on now
Say come on now
Say I still remember
You used to be 9 years old
I was a fool for you baby
From the bottom of my soul
And now that you’ve grown up
You’re nothin’ more
Now you want to leave me
You want to let me go

And I want you to know
Said I want you to know right now
You’ve been good to me baby
Better than I’ve been to myself
And of you and me baby
I’m leadin’ above everybody else
I said I want you to know
I want you to know right now

You know you make me wanna shout
Put my hands up and shout
Through my head back and shout
Kick my heals up and shout
Come on now shout
Take it easy take it easy
Take it easy make it easy

A little bit softer now [x8]
A little bit loader now [x8]

I’m feeling all
I’m feeling alright
I’m feeling alright
