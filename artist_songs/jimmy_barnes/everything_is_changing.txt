She tells me I'd better stop talking now baby
Glasses hiding the tears in her eyes
A rush from the poison
That runs though her veins
And still I'm drawn to that girl like a flame

I can feel everything is changing
I'm not alone

The touch from her hair
As it falls on my face
For a moment...
All of my pain disappears
With each second that passes
I'm pulled back again
And the hurting comes
When she's no longer near
Can't see clear

I can feel everything is changing
I'm not alone
Lips that taste of nobody blaming
I need to know

Won't you come back?
And help me though the night
Won't you come back?
And help me find the light

I can feel everything is changing
I'm not alone
Lips that taste of nobody blaming
I need to know

She tells me I'd better stop talking now baby
Glasses hiding the tears in her eyes
