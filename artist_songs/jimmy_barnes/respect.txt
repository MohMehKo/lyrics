What you want
Honey you got
What you need
You know you got it
All that I'm asking for
Is a little respect
When I come home
Listen, I do you no wrong
Honey while I'm gone
Do me no wrong
Honey, while I'm gone
All that I'm asking for
Is some respect
When I come home
Hey little girl
You're so sweeter than honey
And I'm about to give you
All my money
But all I want you to do for me
Is give me respect
When I get home, hey hey hey
Hey little girl
You're so sweeter than honey
And I'm about to give you
All my money
But all I want you to do for me
Is give me respect
When I get home, hey hey hey
Respect what I need
Respect what I need
Respect what I need
Respect what I need
