Before I lose my way i’m going home
The longer I stay with you
The more I feel alone
Before I leave I think that there is
Something you should know
You can’t make love without a soul

No love, no soul
If you wanna make love, love, love
You gotta have soul
Make love and you might make a friend for life
But you can have a million bucks
And still not get it right
If life’s an education
Then I think you should be told
You can’t make love without a soul

You can’t make love if you don’t believe in it
Can’t make love if you keep leavin’ it
Up to someone else
To take control for you
Love, love, love!
You gotta have soul!

Love will make you beautiful
Love will make you whole
Use this information and then
Watch your life unfold
You can’t make love
You can’t make love
You can’t make love without a soul
