Take a run and jump, straight up front
Maybe I'm just a bit too blunt
Broke my back, it all turned black
I wasn’t ready for your love attack
Tried to please, baby on your knees
Your love is good. make a blind man see
Came and went, all been spent
Girl your lovin’ must be devil sent

Didn’t want to get in too deep
And now my hands are tied
Never meet a girl who looked so good
With such an appetite

Girl your one of a kind
Won’t waist any time
I’ve got to get my hands on you
‘Cause I can tell you’re something special
Girl your one of a kind
Won’t waist any time
I’ve got to get my hands on you
‘Cause I can tell you’re something special

Tight skirts, like a flirt
She don’t stop till it starts to hurt
She’s sweet, what a treat
Got to get her into my back seat
Too bad I've been had

If I'd have missed out I'd have be real sad
In need of help can’t you tell
You know your lovin’ is an endless well

Like to give you more now baby
But my hands are tied
No excuse ‘cause it ain’t no use
I got no alibis

Girl your one of a kind
Won’t waist any time
I’ve got to get my hands on you
‘Cause I can tell you’re something special
Girl your one of a kind
Won’t waist any time
I’ve got to get my hands on you
‘Cause I can tell you’re something special

Don’t waste any time, ‘cause I'm losing my mind
Say you’ll be mine, it’s a matter of time
‘Cause I can tell you’re something special
