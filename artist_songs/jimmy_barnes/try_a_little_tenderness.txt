She may be weary women do get weary
Wearing that same old shabby dress
But when she's weary try a little tenderness
She may be waiting just anticipating
Things that she may never posses
While she's without them try a little tenderness

Now it's not just sentimental she has her grief and her care

The words they're soft and gentle makes it easier to bear
You won't regret it women don't forget it
Love is their whole happiness
And it's all so easy try a little tenderness
Yes it's all so easy try a little tenderness
