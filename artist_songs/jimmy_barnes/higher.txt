All the hours on a modern day
My feet have taken flight
The dreams you had of another way
Have faded out of sight
Running naked from a woman sir
Trying to hide from life
But it’s alright ok

I see the veins of a shaken hand
That’s holding up that bag
It casts a shadow of a broken man
From the way that life is sad
There’s nothing that can ease the pain
Dedication to the flag
And it’s alright it’s ok

Take me higher now
‘Cause I know there’s a better way
To make it though this life
Take me higher now
Give me something to ease the pain
I want to make it right this time

He’s the one with the simple life
Never try's to take a stand
He’s outstanding with an open heart
Never fights for what he can

In a world of give and take
He’s given more than many man
But it’s alright ok

Take me higher now
‘Cause I know there’s a better way
To make it though this life
Take me higher now
Give me something to ease the pain
I want to make it right this time

And see how far above amongst the clouds
And dreams of seeing your shinning light
In front of me

Take me higher now
‘Cause I know there’s a better way
To make it though this life
Take me higher now
Give me something to ease the pain
I want to make it right this time
Take me higher now
‘cause I know there’s a better way
To make it though this life
Take me higher now
Give me something to ease the pain
I want to make it right this time
Take me higher now
‘Cause I know there’s a better way
To make it though this life
Take me higher now
Give me something…
