I don't understand, what you really see
When any other man, could give you more than me
But all that I own, I would gladly give up
As long as I can trust, in the tremble of your touch

I know love is enough I know love is enough
To keep me warm at night
I know love is enough
Turn the dark into light

I know love is enough
You're the one I need
I know love is enough
Every single day, that I spend alone

I felt my life was a river, that was dry as a bone
All I knew was down, till you pulled me up
Brought us face to face, to melt in your embrace
I know love is enough I know love is enough

To keep me warm at night
I know love is enough
Turn the dark into light
I know love is enough
You're the one I need

I know love is enough If I was lost at sea,
You would guide me through the night
Through your eyes I'd see, all the shadows turn to light
Tell me that you feel like you never felt before

Tell me this is real,
I know I couldn't love you anymore
If this is a dream I don't wanna wake up
It'd be too much to take, I'd have nothing left to give
When I felt the break, I wouldn't wanna live

Cause you're the one who starts, the pounding of my heart
I know love is enough I know love is enough

To keep me warm at night
I know love is enough
Turn the dark into light
I know love is enough
You're the one I need
I know love is enough
