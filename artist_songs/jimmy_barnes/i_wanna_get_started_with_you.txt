Well its late, I want more
Like nothing else I've felt before
Try to fight it I can't hide it
When its you that I want
Play the game always the same
Love or leave it alone
I don't like wasting time
That I could be spending with you
If you could read my mind
Every night they'll be a whole lot of shaking

Once you get me started
There's no holding back
Nothing to lose
I can't wait forever
So let's stop fooling around
I wanna get started with you

I can't help letting it out
Like a slow moving train at the top of the hill
Sooner or later you're gonna find out
I'll come thundering down
Take you in my arms
All that you'd dream I'd do
Waited way too long so come on
It's my heart you'd be breaking

Once you got me started
There's no holding back
Nothing to lose
All that really matters
Just don't make me wait
Cause I wanna get started with you

What began as a fascination?
Has got the best of me
This ain't the time for hesitations
I'll give you good loving and baby you'll see

Once you get me started
There's no holding back
Nothing to lose
I can't wait forever
So let's stop fooling around
I wanna get started with you

Girl you got me started
There's no holding back
Nothing to lose
All that really matters
Just don't make me wait
Cause I wanna get started with you
