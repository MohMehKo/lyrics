Kids out driving Saturday afternoon, just pass me by
I’m just savoring familiar sights
We shared some history, this town and I
And I can’t stop that long forgotten feeling of her
It’s time to book a room and stay the night

Number one is to find some friends to say
You're doing well
After all this time you boys look just the same
Number two is the happy hour
At one of two hotels
Settle into play do you remember so and so
Number three is never say her name

Oh those flame trees will blind a weary driver
And there’s nothing else could set fire to this town
There’s no change, there’s no pace
Everything within it’s place
Just makes it harder to believe
That she won’t be around

Who needs that sentimental bullshit anyway
Take more than just a memory to make me cry
And I'm happy just to sit here
‘round a table with old friends
And see which one of us can tell the biggest lies
And there’s a girl she’s falling in love
Near where the pianola stands
With her young local factory out-of-worker
They’re just holing hands
And I'm wondering if he’ll go or if he’ll stay
Do you remember
Nothings stopped us on the field
In our day

Oh those flame trees will blind a weary driver
And there’s nothing else could set fire to this town
There's no change, there’s no pace
Everything within it’s place
Just makes it harder to believe
That she won’t be around

Oh those flame trees will blind a weary driver
And there’s nothing else could set fire to this town
There's no change, there’s no pace
Everything within it’s place
Just makes it harder to believe
That she won’t be around
