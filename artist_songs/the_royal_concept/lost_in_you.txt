I saw you there by the road
Just for a while, yet I'm sure
I need my ups and downs
I just wanna get lost with you

You want a perfect life home
I learned to get there, I hope 
I need my ups and downs
I just wanna get lost with you

Have you, found you in my arms
I just imagined that I have you in my arms

Round and round I go
Never been this low
Just one more kick tonight
I need it, get out

You mind if I look around?
Just like you do all the time
It's just for fun, of course
I just wanna get lost with you

Have you felt you in my arms
I just imagined that I held you in my arms

Round and round I go
Never been this low
Just one more kick tonight
I need it, get out

Up and down the walls
All-time high for sure
I've never felt this good
I'm lost without you

Round and round we go
All-time high for sure
Never felt this good
I'm lost without you
