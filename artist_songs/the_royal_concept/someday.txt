I got a feeling that you already know
We didn’t even get to know this at all
I'll stay a while just so I'm sure where to go
I got to clean up, it won’t take too long

I never said that this was written in stone 
You act this safe although I’m far from you hun
Of all the girls I had the pleasure to know
You are the loudest I'll give you that love

Someday
Can't you see it’s too late?
Always and forever
Doesn’t make much sense girl
Can't stay in your head love
Carrying on  this way

I got a feeling that you’re alone in your bed
I’ll tuck you in and make this haunt us again
What is this thing without a partner in crime
I don't wanna see you without anyone

I can never stay I just want you to know, know
I can never go without having a go, go

Someday
Can't you see it’s too late?
Always and forever
Doesn’t make much sense girl
Can't stay in your head love
Carrying on  this way

Wound up in bed, will you take it again
Now I don’t know what to say
I’ll just do it again
I’m getting to know this
Getting to know this well

Take it or leave it, take me today
Now I don’t know who to be
Come and spoil me again
I’m dying for some fun
I’m dying for some fun

Take it to leave it, take me today
Now I don’t know what to say
Come and fool me again
I don’t even know
You don’t even know this yet

Wound up in bed, can you take this again
I don’t know how to stay, I got carried away
How I hate to be the one

So come on honey
