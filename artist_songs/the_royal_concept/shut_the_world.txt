Start of show tonight they're lighting up the sky
No I didn't plan on seeing you walk by
Oh god I wish you'd stay
We're gonna live and die young
We're gonna live and die young
I'd rather be a ticking bomb than a fading light
I keep staring at that empty seat again
And I know this night I'll probably just end up high out of my mind
We're gonna live and die young
We're gonna live and die young
I'd rather be a ticking bomb than a fading light
I see the riot grow see the riot grow
I see the skyline glow see the skyline glow
And now I've lost the words but the masses know
They all sing for you
It's always been about you
Now I'm swaying in my bunk bed coast to coast
Guess I'll see you once or twice this year at most
and pretend we're not occupied
We're gonna live and die young
We're gonna live and die young
I'd rather be a ticking bomb than a fading light
I see the riot grow see the riot grow
I see the skyline glow see the skyline glow
And now I've lost the words but the masses know
They all sing for you
It's always been about you
And them show tonight
I miss the Stockholm sky
And I didn't plan on seeing you walk by
I see the riot grow see the riot grow
I see the skyline glow see the skyline glow
And now I've lost the words but the masses know
They all sing for you
It's always been about you
It's always been about you
We're gonna live and die young
We're gonna live and die young
