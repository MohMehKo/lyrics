It was a saturday night
We were young
We were young
We were young
We ran away in the dark
We had fun
We had fun
We had fun
Oh all the things that these girls put us through
Put us through
Put us through
Put us through
Now it's a saturday night
Where are you?
Where are you?
Where are you?

Go, go, this a shootout
Girls, girls, girls they all use guns
Go, go, run while you can
Oh my, oh my
Go, go, this is a set up

It's a saturday night full of fun
Now we're done
Now we're done
Now we're done
Oh all the things that you do, now we're through
That's just cruel
That's just cruel
That's just cruel
Oh all the things that these girls put us through
Put us through
Put us through
Put us through
And now it's a saturday night
Where are you?
Where are you?
Where are you?

Go, go, this a shootout
Girls, girls, girls they all use guns
Go, go, run while you can
Oh my, oh my
Go, go, this is a set up
Girls, girls, girls tear your heart out
Go, go, run while you can
Oh my, oh my

Go, go, this a shootout
Girls, girls, girls they all use guns
Go, go, run while you can
Oh my, oh my
Go, go, this is a set up
Girls, girls all have a clean shot
Go, go, run while you can
Oh my, oh my

Go, go, this a shootout
Girls, girls, girls they all use guns
Go, go, run while you can
Oh my, oh my
Go, go, this is a set up
Girls, girls, girls tear your heart out
Go, go, run while you can
Oh my, oh my
