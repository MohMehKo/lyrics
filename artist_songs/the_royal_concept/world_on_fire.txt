I see the world has gone mad
I see them talk the talk walk walk the walk but nothing stands out
I see the world has gone mad
I think ill do you like I used to do do it all night

I see the world has gone mad
I say we do it like we used to do fuck the [?]
Where is my band, where are my friends
They turn to DJs and just hit it hit it big time instead

Tell yourself this night won't end
Promise land let us escape

I set the world on fire, won't let you go
Now all the pieces come together and I let it all go
I set the world on fire, won't let you go
I come and pick you up and clean you like the worm from above
I set the world on fire, the world on fire

I see the world has gone mad
I say we do it like we used to do do it all night
Where's every [?] what's their next move?
I say just fuck them let them know that they ain't doing no good

Get the job, get the job, get the job done.
Do it like we used to do it do it all night
Get the job, get the job, get the job done.
They do it like they used to do they do it all wrong

I set the world on fire, won't let you go
Now all the pieces come together and I let it all go
I set the world on fire, won't let you go
I come and pick you up and clean you like the worm from above
I set the world on fire, the world on fire, the world on fire
Now all the pieces come together and I let it all go

Tell yourself this night won't end
Reach out and take my hand
I told you twice this has to end
Reach out and take my hand
Tell yourself this night won't end
There is no time to lose

Promised land let us escape
Promised land let us escape

I set the world on fire, won't let you go
Now all the pieces come together and I let it all go
I set the world on fire, won't let you go
I come and pick you up and clean you like the worm from above
I set the world on fire, the world on fire, the world on fire
Now all the pieces come together and I let it all go
