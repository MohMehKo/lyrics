It’s like you’re bursting through the sky
It’s like you finally caught their eye
It’s like you find another wife
It’s like the story of your life 

It’s like the view is so much better
It’s like 27 forever
It’s like the view is so much better
It’s like 27 forever

It’s like they all look at your face
It’s like they all look through your case
It’s like you serve until the light 
It’s just as lonely in the night 

It’s like the view is so much better
It’s like 27 forever
It’s like the view is so much better
It’s like 27 forever

It’s like you die when you’re too young
It’s like you just know when it’s fun
It’s like you leave ’em wondering why
It’s like you’re watching all the while
It’s like you see your life like mine 

It’s like the view is so much better
It’s like 27 forever
It’s like the view is so much better
It’s like 27 forever

It’s like you can’t get over her
(It’s like the view is so much better)
It’s like you left me when it hurts
(It’s like 27 forever)
It’s like a million different views
It’s like 27 forever

Oh, it’s like the view is so much better
It’s like 27 forever
