I get all terrified whenever our worlds collide
You never been around so how come you're all dressed up now
And you look good you really do but now it's not the time
To mess up about you I know I would but my hands are tied

And in the end you're on your own
I couldn't stand it all alone
Just how independent have you grown
And all those tears will be long gone

but in the end you're on your own 
I just can't wait for this no more
I couldn't stand there all alone

I know you wouldn't have the guts to say my name out loud
Ten-thousand people wouldn't care to say it right out loud
and you get terrified and think about the big black sky
but all those stars they all make sense comparing to you and me

And in the end you're on your own
I couldn't stand there all alone
Just how independent have you grown
And all those tears will be long gone

But in the end you're on your own 
I just can't wait for this no more
I couldn't stand there all alone
