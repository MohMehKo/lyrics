Oh, no, I don't wanna say no
But I can't waste it all in the night
Oh boy, she's as tough as they come
I never meant to stay the whole night
But she'll get knocked up,
Lucky shot,
Someday
And I get locked up,
What a luck,
Someday

And you say:
Hey boy you're gonna need someone
You're gonna need someone
You're gonna need someone
Someday
Yeah you say:
Hey boy I really need someone
I really need someone
I really need someone 
Today

And we're on top of the world

Oh no, that's as far as I go
No, I don't feel like holding hands, no, no, no
And we know this ain't working no more
I never meant to change anyhow
But she'll get knocked up,
Lucky shot,
Someday
And I get locked up,
What a luck,
Someday

And you say:
Hey boy you're gonna need someone
You're gonna need someone 
You're gonna need someone 
Someday
And you say:
Hey boy I really need someone 
I really need someone
I really need someone 
Today

Hey boy you're gonna need someone
You're gonna need someone
You're gonna need someone
Someday
Yeah you say:
Hey boy I really need someone
I really need someone
I really need someone
Today

I don't wanna be without her,
I don't wanna be beside her
Could it be she's just as tired?

We're so tense
I can't deny it
And she's making plans to hide it
Could it be that I'm just hiding?

I don't wanna be inside her,
I just wanna stay beside her
We're so tense, it's hard to see straight
We're so lost, I can't deny it
And we're making plans to hide it
And I don't wanna be the ass that took off

All good folks come and go
