Look at her go breaking my heart
I'm stuck with Albert, Fab and Bev
I'm stroking out
I want it all
I'll play my part
I'll find another but it's her I'll dream about
I need it now
I wanna fall
I wanna scream and shout and raise another war
Pick up the phone
Rip me apart
I'm like a fire burning out

Caught up in the glow at a cabin down below
and I'm falling and I'm falling and I'm falling
like a rolling stone
Just take me home
Close enough to touch but I want it all too much
and I'm falling and I'm falling and I'm falling
like I'm all alone
Just take me home

Right back in love
we're on repeat
I feel the beating of the beating of the beat
Look at us go
We're speeding up
I'm throwing pennies down a wishing well tonight
I want it all, I need it now
We're stuck at yelling at each other day and night
Keep walking down
this dead end street
What you doing, doing to me

Then I catch her eye and she's waving me goodbye
and I'm falling and I'm falling and I'm falling
like a rolling stone
Just take me home
Caught up in your lies sell me any lullabies
and I'm falling and I'm falling and I'm falling
like I'm all alone
Just take me home

As long as we're together
this fight will last forever
I'm running and I'm running and I'm running
and its all for you
It's all for you
I could never leave her
I will always be there
I'm falling and I'm falling and I'm falling
like a rolling stone
Just take me home

Caught up in the glow at a cabin down below
and I'm falling and I'm falling and I'm falling
like a rolling stone
Just take me home
Close enough to touch but I want it all too much
and I'm falling and I'm falling and I'm falling
like I'm all alone
Just take me home
