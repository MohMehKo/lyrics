Don't go
Why would you go?
We've been
At this
As long as I known you
This might be
All the love I need now

Givin' me the
Sweet talk
Weren't you the one
To just 
Get out
Good luck finding guys
That can keep up
Everytime you freak out

I can't say the drama's gone
It just begun
There's certain things you
Don't tell girls
I said too much

But please don't tell me
I'm the one
There're all the one
I feel left out
I'm hanging up
I'm losing you
Got things to do
That don't include you fool

No no
Nowhere to go
She's so 
Lonely
Naked & dumb
On her strip pole
Saving for the ticket

Now I'm in the
Background
Naked & dumb
I'm just
Stupid
To think she's done
She's just started
Reaches for a big kiss
Now

I can't say the drama's gone
It just begun
There's certain things you
Don't tell girls
I said too much

But please don't tell me
Your the one
There all the one
I'm stroking out
Your losing me
The maddest girl I knew

No no
I want to you to know
That you
Far Far
Far from the one
You deluded
High up in your sky
Take me down

How come all these
Cycles
Naked & Dumb
She's too 
stupid
To think that I'll come
And we're flying
High up in her sky
I know that's where I've always been

Closer
Closer to you
But there's so much
I'd rather do
You're deluded
High up in your sky

Take me down
Now
She's at my
Doorstep
Naked & Dumb
She's too 
stupid
To think that I'll come
And we're flying
High up in her sky
I know that's where they'll find me again

I can't say the drama's gone
It just begun
There's certain things you
Don't tell girls
I said too much
