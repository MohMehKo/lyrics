I hate to admit it
I'm running all the reasons through my head
Six AM and we come to an end
We've been here thousand times or more
I know you've picked me up before from the gutter

Shallow hearts and small talk filled my days
Wake up wasted in some random place
Another heartlet played again
Tomorrow you'll be on your way just stay

Tonight we're singing every goddamn song
And it feels like all our trouble's gone
You and me just one last night
Something wrong has never felt so right
Singing every goddamn line

You're gone now I get it
And Jesus girl just take us to the start
I'm dumb enough to watch us fall apart
I'm twisted in your web again
I never wanted this to end, we're one

Tonight we're singing every goddamn song
And it feels like all our trouble's gone
You and me just one last night
Something wrong has never felt so right
Singing every goddamn line
Tonight

Tonight we're singing every goddamn song
And it feels like all our trouble's gone
You and me just one last night
Something wrong has never felt so right
Singing every goddamn line
Tonight

I hate to admit it
It's you and me just one last night
Something wrong has never felt so right
