Started with a song you faked on guitar in a movie
You were a slang folk goddess of the stars singing into me
Like a margarita mellow kiss
Does it feel like that, does it feel like this?
If you feel the same and you wanna talk
I'll take your cat for a walk

'Cuz you spin my world like a hurricane
Tell me where to go, be my weather vane
Twistin' up my brain, am I crazy or sane?
Give me love, give me pain, spin my world like a hurricane

Tear you apart, now we draw some flowers
Every blooms gotta have it's fall
I try to win your favorite showers
You say I can't lose them all baby doll

'Cuz you spin my world like a hurricane
Tell me where to go, be my weather vane
Twistin' up my brain, am I crazy or sane?
Give me love, give me pain, spin my world like a hurricane

('Cuz you spin my world)
I just don't know
(Tell me where to go)
I just don't know
(You're twistin' up my brain, am I crazy or sane?)
Spin my world like a hurricane

'Cuz you spin my world like a hurricane
Tell me where to go, be my weather vane
Twistin' up my brain, am I crazy or sane?
Give me love, give me pain, spin my world like...

'Cuz you spin my world like a hurricane
Tell me where to go, be my weather vane
Twistin' up my brain, am I crazy or sane?
Give me love, give me pain, spin my world like a hurricane

Give me love, give me pain, spin my world like a hurricane
