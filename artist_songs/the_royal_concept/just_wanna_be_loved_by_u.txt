There's a shadow hanging over me
Like a dream that never was to be
It's the only thing that I still see
'Cause I'm trapped inside a memory

There's a shadow hanging over my head
The smell of your perfume in my bed
I regret all the stupid things that I said
And sometimes I wish that I was dead

The color of your heart is so cold

And I just wanna be loved by you
And I just wanna be loved by you
You know I'd rather be alone and lonely
Than with someone else
'Cause I just wanna be loved by you

In the bedroom of a cheap motel
I turn our heaven into hell
There's somethings that you should never tell
'Cause now I hear them ringing on the bell

The color of your heart is so cold

And I just wanna be loved by you
And I just wanna be loved by you
You know I'd rather be alone and lonely
Than with someone else
'Cause I just wanna be loved by you

The color of your heart is so cold

And I just wanna be loved by you
And I just wanna be loved by you
You know I'd rather be alone and lonely
Than with someone else
'Cause you know I'd rather be alone and lonely
Than with someone else
'Cause you know I'd rather be alone and lonely
Than with someone else
'Cause I just wanna be loved by you
