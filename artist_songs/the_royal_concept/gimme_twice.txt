I got it all worked out let settle now
But then you poke around for a better plan
It's not an easy street give it, give it all tonight

I'm such a mess right now, such a mess right now
You better show me how I'm not the simple kind
It's not an easy street give it give it all alright

You go OH s-s-say it come and say it out loud
So they all can hear
I'm the one, I'm the one I
I'm the one, I'm the one for you

Sh-sh-shake it while your at it now, like you mean it now
Gimme once gimme twice alright

I said to live this life, said to live this life
It takes a hell lot time making peace at night
It's not an easy street I shouldn't even bother now

I want less in life simply stroke some town
You'd rather sip through all your fansy wine
And come alive once more
Oh but this time I decide

You go oh s-s-say it come and say it out loud
So they all can hear
I'm the one, I'm the one
I'm the one, I'm the one for you

Sh-sh-shake it while your at it now, like you mean it now
Gimme once gimme twice tonight

I just wanna lay down come on lay down
I'll just go down baby stay high
I just wanna go down so won't you lay down now
It's time to go but I love you so GET OUT!

OH s-s-say it come and say it out loud
So they all can hear
I'm the one, I'm the one
I'm the one, I'm the one for you

S-s-say it come and say it out loud
So they all can hear
I'm the one, I'm the one, I'm the one, I'm the one for you

Sh-sh-shake it while your at it now, like you mean it now
Gimme once gimme twice tonight
