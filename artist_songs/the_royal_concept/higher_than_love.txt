Oh my baby and I, we got diamond halos up in the sky,
We got, right kind, too blind,
And set this house on fire,
(Oh my baby and I, we got diamond halos up in the sky,
We got, big smiles, love flowing
On fire and we're glowing)

Call us liars, our filthy desires,
Gonna keep us higher than love,
And they can call us wrong,
But that's where we belong,
Gonna keep us higher than love

I know you wanna,
I know you wanna,
I know you wanna go higher,
I know you wanna,
I know you wanna,
I know you wanna go higher,
I know you wanna,
I know you wanna,
I know you wanna go higher,
Just get it on, yeah we belong,
(Higher)

(AaaahAahAah, AahAah)
(Higher)

Oh my baby and me, we're like third rate lovers of the first degree,
We're like, big wheels, tough shooters,
Free love without computers,
(Oh my baby and me, we're like third rate lovers of the first degree,
We got, right kind, too blind,
Shake them hips like tambourines)

Call us liars, our filthy desires,
Gonna keep us higher than love,
Then they can call us wrong,
But that's where we belong,
Gonna keep us higher than love

I know you wanna,
I know you wanna,
I know you wanna go higher,
I know you wanna,
I know you wanna,
I know you wanna go higher,
I know you wanna,
I know you wanna,
I know you wanna go higher,
Just get it on, yeah we belong,
(Higher)

We got, right kind, too blind

I know you wanna,

I know you wanna go higher,

I know you wanna go higher,

(Don't you wanna go higher?)
I know you wanna go higher,
Just get it on, yeah we belong,
