I dress like shit, call it fashion,
But your fashion's the shit
I never thought twice in life,
But it's time I realize.

Lovin' you ain't easy,
But I'm not gonna leave you no, no, no
I said yeah, yeah, yeah.

Just gotta groove on

I gotta just get gone,
But you really turn me on,
I gotta just get gone,
But you really turn me on

Lovin' you ain't easy,
But I'm not gonna leave you, no, no, no
I said yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

'Cause I love the way you wear on me
And your fashion is so wild and free
Honey, lovin' you ain't easy,
But I'm not gonna leave you, no, no
So, baby, put your dope-ass crazy fashion on me

I love the way you wear on me
And your passion's gonna cut me deep
Honey, lovin' you ain't easy,
But I'm not gonna leave you no, no

I kiss your lips 'cause it's fashion,
You're so passionate
