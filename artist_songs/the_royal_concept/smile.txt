Young folks, listen up
This is where we are caught up
In southern California with
Nowhere to start, and you left some

Now what's here for me?
Yeah, I've had enough of him
Still asking for your number
While we're reading your blog

You know, my blues can't wake her
My heart, it can not break and now
I carry sorrow
Cause, Hell, I can not shake her, no

My world keeps turnin'
My heart, it keeps on burnin'
And I know where to find her
Just wanna see her smile again

I've got to dress sharp, you know I will
Give you what it takes cause I'm not
Gonna be outdone
By those beautiful fakes

In your halo, there's gotta be gold
I've got you waitin' on
I'll step on a grenade so you
Can see I'm the bomb

You know, my blues can't wake her
My heart, it can not break and now
I carry sorrow
Cause, Hell, I can not shake her, no

My world keeps turnin'
My heart, it keeps on burnin'
And I know where to find her
Just wanna see her smile again

The night keeps fallin'
Her voice, it keeps on callin'
We all carry sorrow
And hold on to tomorrow

Cause the world keeps turnin'
And I will keep on learnin'
And I know where to find her
Just wanna see her smile again

My blues can't wake her
My heart, it can not break and now
I carry sorrow
Cause, Hell, I can not shake her, no

My world keeps turnin'
My heart, it keeps on burnin'
And I know where to find her
Just wanna see her smile again

Just wanna see her smile again
Just wanna see her smile again
