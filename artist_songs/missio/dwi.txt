This party is not my body
When I am drunk and out of mind
This bottle thinks that it owes me
But it can't own me if I am dead

I got that D-D-DWI
I got the fuck my life, DWI
I got that D-D-DWI
I got the fuck my life, DWI
I got that

This party is not my body
When all these creatures eat my skin
They're searching for the demise, oh
For this is my soul that I left

I got that D-D-DWI
I got the fuck my life, DWI
I got that D-D-DWI
I got the fuck my life, DWI
I got that

I got that D-D-DWI
I got the fuck my life, DWI
I got that D-D-DWI
I got the fuck my life, DWI
I got that

I got that
I got that
I got that
