I know you, inside and out
Yes I know you, we met in my dreams
You can't fool me, your heart is too kind
Think you're a monster, you must know now

My heart is black as can be
Your heart is pray to the mission
My body hangs from the rope
Your body leans gently into me

You're not a monster, I'm not a monster
But we have monsters inside of us
You're not a monster, I'm not a monster
But we have monsters inside of us

I am tired of endless decay
You're tired of being alone
One day I'll kiss you good night
One day you will sing me to death

You're not a monster, I'm not a monster
But we have monsters inside of us
You're not a monster, I'm not a monster
But we have monsters inside of us
You're not a monster, I'm not a monster
But we have monsters inside of us
You're not a monster, I'm not a monster
But we have monsters inside of us

You're not a monster, I'm not a monster
But we have monsters inside of us
You're not a monster, I'm not a monster
But we have monsters inside
