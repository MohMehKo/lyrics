Home is where they say the heart is
Mine's buried in the yard
Hell's a place they say is for sinners
I'll be the man in charge

But, how, can I exist within the midst of this?
But, how, can I admit that I would quit on you?

I wrote God a simple letter
Still haven't heard from him
I must have really messed up this time
Shit must have hit the fan

But, how, can I exist within the midst of this?
But, how, can I admit that I would quit on you?

(But how) Can I exist within the midst of this?
(But how) Can I admit that I would quit on you?
(But)
(But how) Can I admit that I would quit on you?
