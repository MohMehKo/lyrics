You don't know what's in my head
You think you do but you really don't
You don't know what's in my head
I'd like to beat ya up, I guess I won't

You don't know what's in my head
This conversation makes me want to choke
You don't know what's in my head
I'd kill ya but I'm afraid of the row

What are you gonna say to me
What are you gonna say to me
What are you gonna do with me
What are you gonna do with, do with, do with

Hold on wait a minute I don't give a (I don't give a)
I don't give a, I don't give a, I don't give a

You don't know what's in my head
I think it's time to put you under oath
You don't know what's in my head
I don't care about what you promote

You don't know what's in my head
This monotone feeling's not the note
You don't know what's in my head
I'd still like to hit ya in the throat

What are you gonna say to me
What are you gonna say to me
What are you gonna do with me
What are you gonna do with, do with, do with

Hold on wait a minute I don't give a (I don't give a)
I don't give a, I don't give a, I don't give a

[Zeale:]
I don't give a
I don't, I don't give a fuck
I don't give a
I don't, I don't give a fuck

You don't really wanna see how it's gonna be
When Zeale put a thought up in his head
Ain't no going back and you knowin' that
So you open that door instead

You be like OH OH OH
Anytime I jump and I'm killing that track
And like OH OH OH
Silly rocks don't leave your woman like that

I don't give a
I don't, I don't give a fuck
I don't give a
I don't, I don't give a fuck

So your boss got mad 'cause you called in sick
Or there's not enough likes on your brand new pic
Or the Starbucks just fucked up your shit
Shut up and read my lips
I don't give a fuck

Hold on wait a minute I don't give a (I don't give a)
I don't give a, I don't give a, I don't give a
