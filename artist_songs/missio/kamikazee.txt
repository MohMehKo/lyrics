Dear God, dear God

(I am a) kamikazee, I am so freaky
Freakier than a bayonet set on fire
That's desire

(I am a) kamikazee, I am so easy
Easier than a bomber in the third world war
That's for sure

I shouldn't want it, but I want it
And it's killing my blank soul

[x2]
I want money and power
And champagne and fame
I want money and power
My black heart's to blame

Money, power, champagne, fame
Money, power, champagne

(I am a) kamikazee, I am so guilty
Guiltier than a liquored-up mistress who
Runs to you

(I am a) kamikazee, I am so lonely
Lonelier than a patriarch labeled liar
Cast aside

I shouldn't want it, but I want it
And it's killing my blank soul

[x2]
I want money and power
And champagne and fame
I want money and power
My black heart's to blame

Money (money), power (power)
Money (money), power (power)
Money (money), power (power)
Money (money), power (power)

Dear God, dear God

[x2]
I want money and power
And champagne and fame
I want money and power
My black heart's to blame

Money (money), power (power)
Money (money), power (power)
Money (money), power (power)
Money (money), power (power)

Money, power, champagne, fame
