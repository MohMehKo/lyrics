Once upon a time in a land far away
There lived a little boy and he drank all day
Friends called him stupid and his brothers called him gay
Emptied all the bottles 'til the pain went away

Whiskey was his friend
He didn't have another
Vicodin his vice
His real and only lover
Yup
Smoked a pack or two
It never was a problem
Popped a pill or two
They really made him blossom
Yup

Take a sip, take a sip, take a sip
And I trip, and I trip, and I trip
And I'm like
When you bitch, when you bitch, when you bitch
Counterfeit hypocrite holy shit
