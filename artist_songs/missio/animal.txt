I'm an animal, you're an animal
I'm an animal, you're an animal
I'm an animal, you're an animal

You know you know me
I like to be intoxicated
You know you know me
And feel unappreciated
You know you know me
I like to be adulterated
You know you know me

They say boy you know it's time to go
You gotta give it up
They say they say they say give it up
They say boy you know it's time to go
You gotta give it up
They say they say they say give it up

I'm an animal, you're an animal
I'm an animal, you're an animal
I'm an animal, you're an animal

You know you know me
I like to get obliterated
You know you know me
To be a bit debilitated
You know you know me
I like it when I'm agitated
You know you know me

They say boy you know it's time to go
You gotta give it up
They say they say they say give it up
They say boy you know it's time to go
You gotta give it up
They say they say they say give it up

I'm an animal, you're an animal
I'm an animal, you're an animal
I'm an animal, you're an animal

Don't know what you want from me
You don't even know my name
Tell me what you want from me
You don't even know my know my
Know know, know-know-know-know

I'm an animal, you're an animal
I'm an animal, you're an animal
I'm an animal, you're an animal
