I trace gold and silver
Led by my heartbeat
Who do I think I am
Power is my mistress
Idols of fortunes
Who do I think I am
Who do I think I am

Oh God of Abram
Oh God of Isaac
Pull out your sword
And lead me on
My vine has withered
My roots have shattered
Pull out your sword
And lead me on

I dance with the devil
I kind of like it
Who do I think I am
Tells me that I'm handsome
That I deserve it
Who do I think I am
Who do I think I am

Oh god of Abram
Oh god of Isaac
Pull out your sword
And lead me on
My vine has withered
My roots have shattered
Pull out your sword
And lead me on
