Depressed again
Morning comes too fast and I'm tired of the routine
Depressed again
Let me sit alone in the tone that you crave
Angry again
No, I don't wanna have a conversation with you
Angry again
Let me sit alone with the ker-ker-ker-kerosene

I don't even care about you
I don't know why
I don't even care about you
I don't know why
I don't even care about you

Depressed again
Evening comes too fast, still tired of the routine
Depressed again
I can do without your forced curiosities
Angry again
Know I don't wanna have a conversation with you
Angry again
Let me sit alone with the ker-ker-ker-kerosene

I don't even care about you
I don't know why
I don't even care about you
I don't know why
I don't even care about you
I don't know why
I don't even care about you
I don't know why
I don't even care about you

You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
Depressed again
Angry again
Let me sit alone with the ker-ker-ker-kerosene

I don't even care about you
I don't know why
I don't even care about you
I don't know why
I don't even care about you
I don't know why
I don't even care about you
I don't know why
I don't even care about you
