I wish I could party like I used to when I was young
Now I like to party by myself, I swear it's just as fun

It's kinda funny
Living a cocaine lifestyle is overrated
This isn't Mexico, it's reality
All of you party people don't get your feelings hurt
I'm incapable of being how you want me
I do what I want
I do what I want

I wish I could function in the big city of LA
I can't even function here alone on a perfect day

It's kinda funny
Living a cocaine lifestyle is overrated
This isn't Mexico, it's reality
All of you party people don't get your feelings hurt
I'm incapable of being how you want me
I do what I want
I do what I want
I do what I want
I do what I want

I do what I want, do what I want
I do what I want, do what I want
I do what I want, do what I want
I do what I want, do what I want
