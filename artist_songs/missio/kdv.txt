Killing Darth Vader with my motherfucking kick drum
Killing Darth Vader with my motherfucking kick drum
Killing Darth Vader with my motherfucking kick drum

I'm brilliant
At least that's what they say
But they don't know I'm not
Who the hell's to know

And I'm charming
At least that's what they think
But they don't know I'm not
I'm really kind of mean

Thank God for the music
Thank God for melodies
Thank God for the haters
Those bitches inspire me

These songs keep me living
These songs keep me sane
And that is why I'll keep

Killing Darth Vader with my motherfucking kick drum
Killing Darth Vader with my motherfucking kick drum
Killing Darth Vader with my motherfucking kick drum
Killing Darth Vader with my motherfucking kick drum

I'm happy
At least that's what they see
But they don't know I'm not
I'd like to rest in peace

Thank God for the music
Thank God for melodies
Thank God for the haters
Those bitches inspire me

These songs keep me living
These songs keep me sane
And that is why I'll keep
