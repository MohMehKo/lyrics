Rock-a-bye, baby
In the treetop
When the wind blows
The cradle will rock
When the bough breaks
The cradle will fall
And down will come baby
Cradle and all

Baby is drowsing
Cosy and fair
Mother sits near
In her rocking chair
Forward and back
The cradle she swings
And though baby sleeps
He hears what she sings

Rock a bye baby
Do not you fear
Nevermind baby
Mommy is here 
From the high rooftops
Down to the sea
No one's as dear
As baby to me
Wee little fingers
Eyes are shut tight
Now sound asleep
Until morning light
