[Hook - Crowder:]
There's another world that I can see
Where angels and demons are constantly fighting over me
There's another world inside of me
Where flesh battles spirit, I know, I can feel it
Both comfort me

[Verse 1 - Tedashii:]
Tears fall to the floor like TKO
Heartbreak ‘cause of pain never seen before
Blood spills, I get chills, it’s not even cold
From paradise to the leauges below
They after me, they chasin'
Friday the 13 like Jason
In the dash, my heart’s been racin'
Back and forth, man, I been pacin'
I know there’s gotta be satan'
I know there’s gotta be satan'
Or maybe it’s me I’m facing
God please send me an angel
Or at least the police to arrest the thief
Tryna steal what’s mine just to mess with me
Feels like I’m in a trial, are you testin’ me?
Angels and demons, they stressin' me
Yeah, people swear that they blessin' me
Turns out to be the people that’s vexin' me
Till I rest in peace, I thought you were a friend
But the sin is i begin
To pretend that life’s all about me
And these so called friends that take advantage of ya
Hate who you are, but swear they love ya
It’s rare to get this, but the two are open

Holy Spirit Come, come, come
Holy spirit Come, come, come

[Verse 2 - Tedashii:]
This ain’t nothin' I ever did
Not really how I ever live
I ain’t tryna say I never slip
But I guarantee this, that the devil real
Never claiming that I’m blameless
That’s a fact well known, like famous
I’m adjusting where my aim is
But off in the dark, I’m shameless
Tryna drown my sorrow, and make it till tomorrow
It ain’t a promise, man, it’s just something I borrowed
Truth hurts most, so we hold a lot close
Side by side with another empty hope
Then the devil keeps on comin'
I’m tired from the runnin'
It started out small, now this thang is enormous high
And it keeps on callin'
Hard to take a stand when you keep on fallin'
But it feel so good, seem so right
If the dark this good I dont ever want the light
Forever want the night, cause the feels like its fire
Right behind closed doors, no relief in sight
God do for me what I cannot do
What I really don’t want, what I need make true
God do for me what I cannot do
What I really don’t want, what I need make true

There’s another world that I can see
Where angels and demons are constantly fighting over me
There’s another world inside of me
Where flesh battles spirit I know I can feel it
Both comfort me
Holy spirit, come, come, come
Holy spirit, come, come, come
