[Verse 1: Tedashii]
Do you remember when you first got saved?
And felt the feeling of the quenching of the thirst God gave
Do you remember when your members all were rendered back to sender
And the feeling of His sealing satisfied like a Snicker
There's relief from the grief of the thief through belief
So excited about His peace you recited it to your peeps
So delighted to hit the streets plus excited to win His sheep
However we passively sever the action we zealously seek (why?)
Fear begins to increase because you notice your peeps
Would rather celebrate the world than ever embrace His peace
They seem to find it in sweets, toting holsters of heat,
Finding comfort like the Isley Brothers in between the sheets
To them the gospel message is foolish and unfulfilling
So you base the Great Commission on whether or not they feeling you
The gospel's offensive except to repentive,
So man up for the manna from Heaven and represent Him

[Hook:]
We press our claim we make it plain
Hey it's on now
Phanatik's insane with this thang
Hey it's on now
Elected and chosen to rep
Mane it's on now
It's on now, it's on now
[Repeat]

[Verse 2: Phanatik]
I can remember when heaven made the connection
And stepped into my section and blessed me with the blessing
Of a calling and election, He made the call and collection
I was all in awe of Him plus I was all in for reppin,
But I can remember when my feet started slipping
And I almost lost my grip cause I was grappling with dipping
Into the forbidden to fulfill desires that were hidden
Not facing temptation with the blatant statement it is written,
Now, isn't it blasphemous to live life like
We have to get this lavish lifestyle while acting like
Creaturely happiness is just as important
As watching our Maker sporting a smile while He staring at us
While we're spinning on our access
This isn't Hell but I'm sure this isn't heaven,
It's sort of short of a little bit of both
Cause both of them are present in the sense that both are possible,
Watch it the only obstacle stopping you
From going to one or the other is the God you know

[Hook:]
We press our claim we make it plain
Hey it's on now
Phanatik's insane with this thang
Hey it's on now
Elected and chosen to rep
Mane it's on now
It's on now, it's on now
[Repeat]

[Verse 3:]
[Tedashii:]
See acts of sin taxes men, finds a corner and backs you in,
And embarrassment harass men til you silent like passive men
Don't let fear grip you, know the Spirit is with you
And be encouraged cause there are saints that have seen
What you've been through
[Phanatik:]
We got Phanatik and T-dot on the beat,
Ride with our feet shod with the gospel of peace,
We won't keep quiet
If the Lord keeps us from cherishing sin or fearing men
To the point that we're embarrassed of Him
[Tedashii:]
So what's the deezy? We either scared or snared b
And one of them has got us caught up and we scared to share
But they won't beat us into silence and no keeping us quiet,
See we love Him too much just to be kept muzzled and bridled
[Phanatik:]
My tounge, (yours too) is powerful like shotgun power
When it gets left out it gets set on blaze
That's how come, I will bridle it and won't leave it idle
And let it off unless it's setting off praise

[Hook:]
We press our claim we make it plain
Hey it's on now
Phanatik's insane with this thang
Hey it's on now
Elected and chosen to rep
Mane it's on now
It's on now, it's on now
[Repeat]
