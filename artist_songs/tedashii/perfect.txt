[Hook 1: Kam Parker]
You don't know what I been through
Don't judge me cuz' you got a past too
I know you don't know
But He knows, He knows, He knows

[Verse 1: Tedashii]
Yeah, they ruin the view, you watching this
Say, I'm doing a fool and it's obvious
Say, I'm losing it too like poverty
They ruin my mood with this gossipin'
Hating this, in the heat of the moment where Satan is
Accusing me of nothing that’s a vacant switch
Making this, hard for a person in this place to live
My God, I’m working like i ain’t got nothin'
Can a load you ain’t drop something
And you can’t high so stop frontin'
My God, that's a lie that we tell ourselves
Then I guess that its hard for you to ask for help
But in that moment that's when you fail
One slip and they judging
When they standing like they ain’t done nothin'
I make no excuse but I refuse to lose
Some dudes without a clue what I’ve been through
From where I’m coming, no lie I should’ve been done
I’m working at it I ain’t perfect at it and I say this every time

[Hook 2: Kam Parker]
You don't know what I been through
Don't judge me cuz' you got a past too
I know you don't know
But He knows, He knows, He knows
I ain't perfect, but I'm working
I ain't perfect, but I'm working
I ain't perfect
I know you don't know
But He knows, He knows, He knows

[Verse 2: Tedashii]
I’m suppose to be dead and gone in a catacomb like Rome 
Out of range trying to use my phone, Hello.
No tone, left alone like I lost my arm?
But I’m up by the air like the top of your home,
With a birds eye view,
Watching these people saying words not true.
Accusing me, they abusing me, yeah truthfully
I don’t have the time to be worried about you man.
Nah, hold on. People playing games with no ball.
No rules in this so they losing it
And they don’t know the score at all.
Consider my life they don’t,
Believe me I’m only human, they won’t.
But no matter their lies
I won’t compromise,
Everyday for your boy it’s on.
Man I promise, I’m honest.
I shoot ‘em straight but they really don’t want it.
Ya they taunt me then flaunt it,
I’ve been dealing with this for the longest.
Ya I doubt I’m the strongest,
but in Him when I am weak I’m stronger.
I’m working at it, I ain't perfect at it,
And I say this every time.

[Hook 3: Kam Parker]
You don’t know what I been through
Don’t judge me cuz' you got a past too
I know you don’t know
But He knows, He knows, He knows
I ain’t perfect, but I’m working
I ain’t perfect, but I’m working
I ain’t perfect
I know you don’t know
But He knows, He knows, He knows

[Bridge: Kam Parker]
My 'ssues, ain't your 'ssues 
So don’t try to judge me,
Just deal with your issues.
Take a look in the mirror,
What you judgin’ for?
Take a look in the mirror,
Cause you never know,
How you affect the next person with your comments.

[Hook 4: Kam Parker]
You don’t know what I been through
Don’t judge me cuz' you got a past too
I know you don’t know
But He knows, He knows, He knows
I ain’t perfect, but I’m working
I ain’t perfect, but I’m working
I ain’t perfect
I know you don’t know
But He knows, He knows, He knows
