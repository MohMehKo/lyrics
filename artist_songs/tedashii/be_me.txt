[Elhae:]
All I've ever wanted, was to be me
All I've ever wanted, was to be me
All I've ever wanted, was to be me
Keep it 100, please believe me
All I've ever wanted
All I've ever wanted
All I've ever wanted was to (be)
All I've ever wanted
All I've ever wanted
All I've ever wanted was to be me
All I've ever wanted

[Tedashii:]
Keep it 100 every time I'm on it
People be saying the way that you do it just ain't the same
Different than all of the rest
But I took a new path like I'm switching lanes
My people right here been looking for a change
Oh Lord
We losing our lives, and these brothers doing time
Oh Lord
I called up the clique and they told me this it, let's switch it up
Change is so hard for these folk
And they making it harder I'm tensing up
I'm feeling like this
When they tell me man 'What you gon' do?'
I tell 'em like this I'ma do it how He did, take two
Standing on top of the table
I might just be doing the Haka
We being us, and they making a fuss
But just know you can't stop us

[Elhae:]
All I've ever wanted, was to be me
All I've ever wanted, was to be me
All I've ever wanted, was to be me
Keep it 100, please believe me
All I've ever wanted
All I've ever wanted
All I've ever wanted was to (be)
All I've ever wanted
All I've ever wanted

[Tedashii:]
I'm being me and I'm feeling charged up
Feeling so free like back in my condo
Get it today like I'm getting paid
You might not see we ain't ballers tomorrow
I get it today for people who're caged
And feel like they caught up
Hol' up, Hol' up, I'ma come down with it
Sick with it, doc might need a shot
Take two of these and he'll call me tomorrow
Say nothing's easy, you've gotta work harder
I'm feeling milli like I won the lotto
I'm being me and that's the new motto
I'm being me and I'm the new model
To those taking shots and they saying we've changed
He renewed my view and I'm taking new aims
I'm here to win, again again until the end
No I don't play games
No matter what happens I'm still unashamed

[Elhae:]
All I've ever wanted, was to be me
All I've ever wanted, was to be me
All I've ever wanted, was to be me
Keep it 100, please believe me
All I've ever wanted
All I've ever wanted
All I've ever wanted was to (be)
All I've ever wanted
All I've ever wanted
All I've ever wanted was to be me
