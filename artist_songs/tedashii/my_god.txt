I'm good, no halo
Just wooden things to hang on
No angel for my angle [?]
I'm gonna fight it 'til I win, no K.O
Invincible and I'm turnt up
Any obstacle, I'm running through it
0n 10, he stepped in
He saved my life (hallelujah)
Ain't tryna to brag, ain't tryna to boast
Well yes I am
I Am showed up and saved my soul
High art, classic genius
That's smart, workmanship
It's not hard
The summit is over, ya hear?
My God
I'm good baby
Oh yeah, I'm good baby
I'm super straight, no debate
I wish you would baby
Peep my stride, I abide since He made me come alive
Is that where He would reside?
True, he ain't never tellin' no lie

[Hook:]
Gunshot a everyday thing
Bodybag a everyday thing
[?] peace we a bring
We donâ€™t want to walk away
But who would show us, jaja
[?] take the ladder
Who would show us, jaja
Me no have no problem for fear me brothers
God know

I'm clean, no detox
I see white like my Reeboks
I put on from my own
No one we copy, no xerox
I'm good, cause I've been who I'm made to be
From alpha to omega, you still trying to get from A to B
But seeing stars small, dying low like that post game
'Til the light hit this world, watch us like a dope man
That shark, and it'll cut you like a razor mane
Besides your sound wave
No you'll never catch me wavering
No, I got it
Oh, I'm so 'bout it
My wrist keep business, raise the bill up
[?] got it
I'm living royalty, the son of a king
For me it's jaja
[?] tell you one more ting, aah

[Hook]
