Yeah man, a brought up in the south, ya know
You just sit on the porch and watch the world go by
And we seen cats riding by lookin' clean man
Sittin' on chrome ridin' dig boxes and bubbles and donks
You know what I'm sayin'
But somthin' starts to go wrong in your heart man
When you start lookin' for the ride.
You start worshipin' the ride almost you know what I'm talkin about.
You know we call that idolatry baby, you feel me.
