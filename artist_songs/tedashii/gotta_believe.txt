[Verse 1:]
Folks having hard times, living in the world so cold
Life dealt them cards now, people trying hard not to fold
Pressures their heart now, feels like they 'bout to explode
While feeling down they asking, "Is this the life that I chose?"
It seems so unfair, man we just trying to survive
But it's like no one cares, we living life just to die
And when I come share that Jesus cares about your life
Their heart is hard, they disbelieve
And they filled with too much pride to cry out
LORD, I surrender my all, or cry
LORD, will you answer my call
Cause this life is not easy, God why I gotta be me
It's hard for me to trust cause when I do somebody leaves me
See, life without Christ is not life, it's daydreaming
Day in and day out
I see people sitting, thinking, drinking tall
Day in and day out
I see people sitting, thinking, drinking tall ounces
Trying to figure out, why is this the way the ball bounces

[Hook:]
Everywhere I go it's still the same song
Everybody getting by, trying to hold on
To a life that He gives
Doubting who is
Don't doubt, don't doubt
You gotta believe
[Repeat]

[Verse 2:]
LORD peep the hood child, Rocking Ones with an ice grill
Folks say he should smile, his mug's mean cause life is
He wants that good life, a Cadillac truck with nice rims
And the culture says to get it, live like the thugs live
A hustler's ambition, since the day he was born
I wished it was different, is this place really the norm
So when I go witness, God's forgiveness seems foreign
And his heart is dark, he disagrees and he's filled with too much scorn to cry
LORD, will you take me as I am or cry
LORD, can you make me a new man
Cause this life is so greasy, God why I gotta be me
Why can't I be that dude I saw rapping on the TV
Questions by some who blind to the grace that freed me
Day in and day out
I see people sitting, thinking, drinking tall
Day in and day out
I see people sitting, thinking, drinking tall ounces
Trying to figure out, why is this the way the ball bounces

[Hook:]
Everywhere I go it's still the same song
Everybody getting by, trying to hold on
To a life that He gives
Doubting who is
Don't doubt, don't doubt
You gotta believe
[Repeat]

[Verse 3:]
This world is gone pass away, so LORD my prayer is they get it
You could probably come back today and a lot of these folks just might miss it
Caught up in their worldly ways, not knowing they could change in an instance
It just takes faith to get in this, but it's been replaced by religion
So cats remain blind, thinking that their works just might save
Some just stay high, thinking there's no way You would take 'em
Saying it's a hard life, complaining when I go witness and I ask them,
What if God did this so He could get your attention, so you'd cry
LORD I confess and believe
Or cry, LORD I see it's you that I need
Cause change is so hard and life is mean in these streets
And it seems there is no God, but see since Adam and Eve
Mankind is so lost, confused on the path they should walk
And so... day in and day out
I see people sitting, thinking, drinking tall
Day in and day out
I see people sitting, thinking, drinking tall ounces
Trying to figure out, why is this the way the ball bounces

[Hook:]
Everywhere I go it's still the same song
Everybody getting by, trying to hold on
To a life that He gives
Doubting who is
Don't doubt, don't doubt
You gotta believe
