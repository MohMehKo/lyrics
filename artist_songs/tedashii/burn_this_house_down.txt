[Verse 1:]
In my room feeling trapped;
A prison without bars.
Stay dreaming of escape in my get-a-way car,
Or a ship from outer space-maybe Venus, maybe Mars,
I just want another place: this one seems too hard.
Maybe another state; this one seems to large,
For me to navigate. Man, my compass seems wrong.
So lighter, fire, matches, if I had this,
I would burn this whole thing down right now.
I don't need it no more.
Man, that part of me is gone.
Every picture, every letter, every part of this home-
You can keep it.
I don't need it.
I'm moving- it's not a secret.
I got a new home and I'm going there to seek it.

[Chorus:]
There's a burnin' in my soul,
Man, there's no where to go
So with fire in my eyes,
I'll light up the sky.
Let it burn! (Let it burn!)
I'll burn this whole house down
Let it burn! (Let it burn!)
I'll burn this house to the ground
Cause' there's too many memories,
Too much pain
Too much for me to bear,
I'm going insane!
Let it burn! (Burn!)
I'll burn this house to the ground
Let it burn! (Burn!)
I'll burn this house to the ground

[Verse 2:]
I can't wait till' I'm out
Of this house that I'm in
Cause' every single day,
I feel trapped inside my skin.
Every scratch, every crack,
Every spot on the exterior,
Flaws that make you pause,
I feel so inferior!
I was 7 when I felt it,
I couldn't perceive it.
Age 11, thought it again and that's when I believed it
Advances made at me and I wouldn't receive it,
I tried to move on but I'm stuck like "Sealed-In"
And I felt so alone that it's like this thing trapped me.
I played make-believe to a race that had happened,
Every falling star, I'm wishing for a change.
I need another place to live-free from these chains!

[Chorus:]
There's a burnin' in my soul,
Man, there's no where to go
So with fire in my eyes,
I'll light up the sky.
Let it burn! (Let it burn!)
I'll burn this whole house down
Let it burn! (Let it burn!)
I'll burn this house to the ground
Cause' there's too many memories,
Too much pain
Too much for me to bear,
I'm going insane!
Let it burn! (Burn!)
I'll burn this house to the ground
Let it burn! (Burn!)
I'll burn this house to the ground

[Verse 3:]
If you push me one more time, then I swear that it's on!
They always picking on me and won't leave me alone.
Racial slurs, hateful words, while people stand there and laugh at ya'.
"Go back to where? But, I'm not even from Africa! "
Heart not right with these after school fights,
Man, I just wanna Live.
This doesn't seem right
When they seem so wrong.
Pain lasts this long,
But this pain was the push to make me want a new home.
I didn't see it but it saw me,
Didn't seek it but it sought me,
Didn't buy it but it bought me,
Hope you catch it-It caught me.
Even victims aren't innocent and need answers for sinfulness.
I understand the simpleness, but most still miss it.

[Chorus:]
There's a burnin' in my soul,
Man, there's no where to go
So with fire in my eyes,
I'll light up the sky.
Let it burn! (Let it burn!)
I'll burn this whole house down
Let it burn! (Let it burn!)
I'll burn this house to the ground
Cause' there's too many memories,
Too much pain
Too much for me to bear,
I'm going insane!
Let it burn! (Burn!)
I'll burn this house to the ground
Let it burn! (Burn!)
I'll burn this house to the ground

[Bridge:]
Let it burn!
Let it burn!
I'm not goin' miss it when it's gone
Let it burn!
And if you thinking that I'm staying,
Then you got to be playing,
I can't wait to leave,
Let it burn!
Let it burn!
Let it burn!
I'm not goin' miss it when it's gone
Let it burn!
And if you thinking that I'm staying,
Then you got to be playing,
I can't wait to leave,
Let it burn!
