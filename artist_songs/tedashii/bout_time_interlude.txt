[Man/Pastor:]
"So, tell me what happened between you all"

[Woman:]
"Well, we dated for 7 months, and um, we did everything together.
He would call me every day, we served in the ministry,
We'd pray and we'd read our Bibles together.
We would go out on dates, we would share our deepest secrets.
We were so, so close - he was my best friend."

[Man:]
"And so now, with the way that things turned out, I mean, how does that make you feel? "

[Woman:]
"Well, first I felt used, and sad. I felt deceived and lied to.
In my head I pictured him as being my husband one day,
And now that picture is just shattered. I just feel so alone."
