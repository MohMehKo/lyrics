[Intro: Benjah]
I don't wanna be alone [x6]

[Verse 1: Tedashii]
Uh, tears hit her cheeks, like Tyson's glove,
Pain hits his heart, as she fights for love,
She says don't go, but the call came,
It's time to deploy, and they called his name,
Close to zero five-hundred, her mind starts wonderin'
Butterflies, tummy starts rumblin',
Queezy, uneasy, tryin' to hold it all together,
She doesn't want their last moments here to be unpleasant,
The car ride is quiet, outside it's hard to fight it,
Inside it's like she's dyin', that's when she started cryin',
He tries to comfort her, "Baby, it's alright" - "Liar! "
That's what she screams louder from the thoughts of fight,
They pray, it's okay, "I'll promise that I'll be safe" uh,
That's what he tells her as he looks her in her face
And as he walks away, lookin' in her eye
Last kiss as they say...

[Chorus: Benjah]
I pray this is not our last goodbye... goodbye
I pray this is not our last goodbye... goodbye

[Verse 2: Tedashii]
Uh, graduation; her nine weeks are done
Hoorah, hooplah, now it's time to move on
Leavin' out of basic, she just got her assignment
She's headed off to war and it's hard for her to face it
Or face her, the daughter that she's leavin'
It's hard to come to terms with the truth, no one believes it
And even when it's starin' in ya face, you don't receive it
She hears mommy, and it's just like her heart stopped beatin' (beatin'... beatin'...)
... Inhales heavy breathin'

Worried when she leaves she may not be back to see them,
Her baby girl, and the family that she loves
Tryin' to hold back the tears right now is tough
She fights to stay strong, gotta hold on
She says a prayer, just tryin' to find a calm
Thoughts of eternity, then back to reality
In fear she tells her family...

[Chorus: Benjah]
I pray this is not our last goodbye... goodbye
I pray this is not our last goodbye... goodbye

I don't wanna be alone, I don't want
I don't wanna be alone, no
[x8]
(I can't live without you)
