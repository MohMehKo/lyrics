[Verse 1:]
9 years old gettin dropped off at sunday school
Class clownin with my boyz I jus wana be kool
See, I grew up thinkin that church was for the preacher
Until I met brothers who wanted to reach us and teach us
How to study our bibles to see what it means
And show Christianity isn't just about what it brings
But sadly there was some who lived opposite of scripture
Christians to the public who muddy up the picture
Cause for too long cats like Kelz and Mase been the spokesmen
All the while the public see us a joke man
So this song is for the true shepherds
Who prove selfless, whose aim is to aid the true helpless
How many brothers like Spergan and Piper,
Tom Nelson, John Edwards, brothers who make disciples
Those because of Ezekiel 34 shepherd the flocks as a true pastor of the Lord

[Chorus:]
Let's here it one for the pastors and preachers,
Those who was burnin to teach us just so they can reach us
And two for big momma Madea, granny Mae, all those who would pray us through the faith
And three for the crowd of many witnesses
Who stood for the faith and paved the way so we could witness this
Kingdom people this songs for you, kingdom people this songs for you, so let's go

[Verse 2:]
I was a hard-head growin up in Buzzeroot Texas
Where the girls would stand stacked and the men would plexes,
But nobody seems to care so my cousins was reckless
But for moms and madea that was more than what's expected
From their perspective, life wasn't over
They all had a sense of hope that was based on Jehovah
And more over, they knew the life to come,
They had a love for the people based on Christ the son
And as I write this song, I can remember many times I left home
Momma cryin just wishin I had tried
Well I tried it momma, and I kept it too, I praise God for Madea that was prayin me through
Thank you Miss Luke, Momma Grant, and Aunt Jessey Mae,
Momma, all those who was prayin through the faith
This is for you, and no one in the world can compare to ya
To me Madea is more than a Tyler Perry character

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
There are those that have gone on, and gone home,
To worship at the throne but their lives live on
It's the presidence of faith that gives the evidence of faith
Exhorting residence of grace that lay aside every weight that hinders our race
True examples from the Father
That even if we're martyred, our faith shall never falter
I pray that we trust in the Father like Jacob and Joseph
True faith hall of famers like David and Moses
And I praise God for our present day models
From the Columbine daughters to my spiritual fathers
I thank you God for the highly Kenan Lecraen show
Godly men as an example of which to go
And to the sisters I see ya'll holdin it down, standin firm for the faith like lightpoles in the ground
This song is dedicated to all ya'll whos true
Kingdom people let's go this songs for you
