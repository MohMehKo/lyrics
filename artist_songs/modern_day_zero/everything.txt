Do you recall when we first met
You thought we were worlds apart
Now it's easy to see just how our lives should be
Every time I feel the beating of your heart
Who am I without you?
What am I if we're through?

You're my eyes when I can't see
You're my lungs when I can't breathe
You're the only thing I need
You are my everything, everything
You're my legs when I am weak
You're my voice when I can't speak
You're the only thing I need
You are my everything, everything

Even now I still can't believe
You thought we'd be better as friends
And it's hard to imagine where our lives would be
It's so easy to see how much I depend on you
Who am I without you?
What am I if we're through?

You're my eyes when I can't see
You're my lungs when I can't breathe
You're the only thing I need
You are my everything, everything
You're my legs when I am weak
You're my voice when I can't speak
You're the only thing I need
You are my everything, everything

I'll keep holding on just as long as you let me (as long as you let me)
I'll keep holding on, I'll keep holding on
Just as long as you believe in me

You're my eyes when I can't see
You're my lungs when I can't breathe
You're the only thing I need
You are my everything, everything
You're my legs when I am weak
You're my voice when I can't speak
You're the only thing I need
You are my everything

You're my eyes when I can't see
You're my lungs when I can't breathe
You're the only thing I need
You are my everything, everything
You're my legs when I am weak
You're my voice when I can't speak
You're the only thing I need
You are my everything, everything

You are my everything, everything
You're everything to me
