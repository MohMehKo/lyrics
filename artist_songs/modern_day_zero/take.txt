(Go ahead and take all that you want from me!)

Now that I am addicted to your innocence
It doesn't make sense; that we would throw this all away
For once I'll agree to change my ways
A lapse of common sense has left us past tense
A sudden loss of breathe can we just get this over now
Why don't you

Go ahead and take all that you want from me
I won't use it anymore
Go ahead and take all that you want from me
I won't be here when you want more

Now you've turned the page and your back on me
That's a book I'd rather read alone
Why don't you

Go ahead and take all that you want from me
I won't use it anymore
Go ahead and take all that you want from me
I won't be here when you want more

Don't abuse me; don't use me; you'll lose me
And fall away
It's too late; and too far away; it's too much
To stay this way

Go ahead and take all that you want from me
I won't use it anymore
Go ahead and take all that you want from me
I won't be here when you want more
I won't be here when you want more

You keep on taking away
