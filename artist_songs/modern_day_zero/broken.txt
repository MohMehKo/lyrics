It's hard to change
What's in front of me
It's hard to find
Anything real
Did it ever even cross your mind
This time
It's out of my hands

[Chorus]
I never wanted to be
So lonely
So hopeless
Break down
Over now
Hit the ground
Left out 
And I'm broken 

I lose myself in your sympathy
I cannot fake this
While you're still standing
Still you never even stop to think
Just why
It's over my head 

[Chorus] 

Don't turn your back on me
Just turn around 
You turned your back on me 
Nowhere to run 
Did it ever even cross your mind 

[Chorus]
