Did you ever believe in me
In you I never had a doubt
Although you were a part of me
I just had to spit you out
You never listen, you never hear a word I say
You burn me inside, so I put you in your place

Just like that, I turn my back and I
Spit you out, spit you out
Just like that, I turn my back and I
Spit you out, spit you out

I cannot believe it's taken so long
To obtain the sight I need
The taste of your lips I RECALL
Now burning black inside of me, inside me

Just like that, I turn my back and I
Spit you out, spit you out
Just like that, I turn my back and I
Spit you out, spit you out

Spit you out, spit you out
You're nothing to me
You're nothing to me
You make me act so obscene
You're nothing to me, stop fucking with me
You never listen, you never hear a word I say

Just like that, I turn my back and I
Spit you out, spit you out
Just like that, I turn my back and I
Spit you out, spit you out
Spit you out, spit you out
