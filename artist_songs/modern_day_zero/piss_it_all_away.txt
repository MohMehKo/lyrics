Now that you have become all that you despise
Covered by this guilt
Smothered by these lies

Now where is the trust that you seek
You've aloud yourslef to become so weak
And now you've faltered with your every move

Have you got nothing left to prove

[CHORUS]
You take for granted all that you've been handed
You piss it all away
You piss it all away

You take for granted all that you've been handed
You piss it all away
You piss it all away

So compulsive in all your ways
You don't ever think twice of those you betray
A little rit of size you choose to ignore
Becoming bored of disgrace then you were before

I see the shame thats in your eyes
Now who will you turn to when no one heres your cry

[CHORUS]

Just tell me how do you survive
When every new mistake could be the biggest of your life

Well I just can't understand why you take for granted all that you've been handed

[CHORUS x2]
