A faded picture
Empty cigarette case
It's on the night stand
That reveals my place
Empty bottle
Relays my thoughts
It's for the cheap seats 
And your life's the cost 
Does it really get hard from here 
Does emotion ever come from your fears 

[Chorus]
On a clear day 
Get up and look around 
On a clear day 
You know where I'll be found 
On a clear day 
Six feet under ground 
'Cause the rain won't fall 
When I decide to die 

When I watch you while you're sleeping 
You turn away 
Somehow you feel my stare 
Do you want me to continue my life 
Without the comfort 
Of those days gone by 
Do you really feel how you say 
Do those gray clouds ever go away 

[Chorus]

Do you really feel how you say
Do those gray clouds ever go away

[Chorus]

I don't ever want to die on a clear day
