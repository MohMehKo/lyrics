Looking at your face it's turning to something
I'm thinking of a place 
I want you to take me
I'm on the inside and you can't hide
I want you to feel this
Brush the hair back from your eyes and lay with me a while

[CHORUS]
I want to come
I want to come
As soon as you let me

I want to come
I want to come
As soon as you let me

Don't make me wait another second baby
Cause I want to come
I want to come
As soon as you let me

Whisper in your ear
I'm thinking of one thing
The pressing skin on skin
And I'm sinking in slowly

All I have to say is 
I love it when you thinking of me
All I have to say is
I love it when you scream my name

[CHORUS]

I want to come
I want to come

I want to come
I want to come

I want to come
I want to come

I want to come
I want to come
As soon as you let me

[CHORUS]

I love it when you're screaming my name
I love it when you're thinking of me

I love it when you're screaming my name
