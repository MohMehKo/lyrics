Simply stated 
Could we be around 
On our way out 
Now we're on our way to behold 
The space that we were before 
Can we reach out to you 
On our way out 

[Chorus]
But somebody's trying 
To lead you somewhere out there 
Beyond all the silence 
I believe you're somewhere out there 
Well I just wonder where you are 

After life is said and done 
We must find our way to move on 
And we hope that there's a light 
On our way out 

[Chorus] 

Everything I believe is gone 
I hate to think that I've been wrong 
Can this light pull me along 

[Chorus]
