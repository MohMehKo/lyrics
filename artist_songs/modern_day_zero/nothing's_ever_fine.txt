Something about the way 
You don't seem to smile anymore 
Something about your face 
Telling me you wanted more 

[Chorus]
Nothing's ever fine 
Something's always troubling your mind 
Nothing's ever fine 
What'll it take to make things right 

Stuck inside this place 
It just doesn't feel like home 
Can't forget the day 
That you chose to be alone 

[Chorus]

Something about the way 
You don't seem to smile anymore
