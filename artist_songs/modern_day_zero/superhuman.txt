A bullet to your head is what you need
You're always kicking us around
Don't call us friends when you're the enemy
Can't wait to see you hit the ground
You brought this on, brought this on yourself
You've had this COMING ALL ALONG

Did you think we'd just lay down and die
While you tried to bleed us dry
Did you think I'd up and disappear?
I'm feeling superhuman
Did you think I'd just turn and walk away?
Like theres nothing left to say
For you I got a surprise mother fucker!!
Here's mud in your eye

I like to drown myself in alcohol
It always brings me what I need
Don't try to stop me when I'm twelve feet tall
Move aside, shut your mouth, it's who I want to be
It makes me feel so invincible
It makes me feel SO ALIVE

Did you think we'd just lay down and die
While you tried to bleed us dry
Did you think I'd up and disappear?
I'm feeling superhuman
Did you think I'd just turn and walk away?
Like theres nothing left to say
For you I got a surprise mother fucker!!
Here's mud in your eye

DON'T TEMPT ME!

Did you think we'd just lay down and die
While you tried to bleed us dry
Did you think I'd up and disappear?
I'm feeling superhuman
Did you think I'd just turn and walk away?
Like theres nothing left to say
For you I got a surprise mother fucker!!
Here's mud in your eye

I'm feeling superhuman
Here's mud in your eye, mother fucker
I'm feeling superhuman
Here's mud in your eye
I'm feelin...I'm feeling superhuman
