I never really meant to be
So cold
When it came right down to being
Alone
I never thought that you would be
So low
You could scrape the dirt right from my feet
I know
That the situation can't go on too long
And I can't hold on

You smother me
And I'm left crawling
All defenses
Seem to fail me
You smother me
To keep me crawling
Away

I never thought that you would be
So cold
When it came right down to being alone
I know
That the situation can't go on too long
And I can't hold on

[Chorus] 

What would you do what would you do if I smothered you 

[Chorus]
