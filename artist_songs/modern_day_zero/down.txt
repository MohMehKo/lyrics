Between you and I 
You seem to have control 
Never giving in 
For love even though 
You can't stand or breathe without me here 
How long do you think you can keep from going 

[Chorus]
Down 
I think you want me 
To fall down 
Down 
I know you want me 
To fall 

Between you and I 
You have the upper hand 
Foreseeing this change 
Only 'cause you can 
And you've been waiting here for so so long 
How long do you think you can keep from going 

[Chorus] 

And I'm watching you fall down 
And I'm watching you fall down 
And I'm watching you fall down
And I'm watching you fall

[Chorus] 

And I'm watching you fall down 
Watching you fall down 
Watching you fall down 
I think you want me 
I know you want me
