It could be so simple, if I just walked the line
I've never been ashamed of what I've done before
Could it be my time?
If you don't care, I don't care
I'm gonna get it somewhere
You're never really there (you're never really there) you're never really there

Try and show me what I mean to you
I'm dying to know this
Try and show me what I mean to you
I'm dying to know this; what do I have to do

Would it even make a difference?
If I was even here at all
I'm tired of your attitude; it's gone too far
Same old shit a different day
I tried to do it your way
I don't know what to say (I don't know what to say) I don't know what to say

Try and show me what I mean to you
I'm dying to know this
Try and show me what I mean to you
I'm dying to know this; what do I have to do
