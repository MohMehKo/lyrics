Going back to yesterday 
When everything it just seemed fine 
Feeling doubt in what you say 
And I should have seen the signs 
But all those words got in the way 
And truth was left behind
Everything is wrong now 
Trust in you is gone now 
I've let this go for far too long 

[Chorus]
I cannot take it when you 
Lie to me 
I'll only let you push me 
So far 
I cannot take it when you 
Lie to me 
It cuts me inside 

You wonder where I am 
And the tides have seemed to change 
Black and white has turned to gray 
And we're caught between the lines 
I'm thinking fate got in the way 
And I'm leaving you behind 
Trusting you is wrong now 
Everything is gone now 
I've let this go for far too long 

[Chorus]

When you lie 
It cuts me inside 
Cuts me inside 
When you lie 

[Chorus]
