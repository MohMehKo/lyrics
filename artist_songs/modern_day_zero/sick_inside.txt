I can see
The sickness deep inside
It is the end of me,
It's rising to the surface
I feel the walls are closing in on me
I've lost control now 
And I can't break free

[Chorus:]
Sick inside,
Sick inside
Somebody tell me what the fuck is wrong with me
Why do I always feel so
(Sick inside,
Sick inside)
Sick inside,
Sick inside
My head is wrong and I know that I'm not right
Why do I always feel so
(Sick inside
Sick inside)

Why does it always feel so right
When I let the worst of me come out
And sink down so low
Alone and lost at night and i can't sleep
All these fears
They're making me

[Chorus]

So low
Someone show me
What I need to do
To feel like you

[Chorus]

Sick of myself
