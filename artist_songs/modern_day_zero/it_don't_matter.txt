It's all been sold 
It's all been told 
But do look close 
See things unfold 

[Pre-Chorus]
It don't matter 
It don't matter 
I hate everything 
It don't matter 
It don't matter 

Shape to the mold 
Do what you're told 
But do look close 
See things unfold 

[Pre-Chorus]

I can't save this 

[Chorus]
Facing life seems too far gone 
And my hands are shaking 
I'm pushing bullets through a gun 
It don't matter 
It don't matter 

Watching and waiting 
For consent to bleed 
Twelve nightmares away from my sanity 
This echoing silence ringing my head 
Turns me to violence when I choose peace instead 

[Chorus]

It don't matter [x2]

[Chorus]
