Why I do the things I do
It isn't all because of you
And how you make me feel sometimes
Forget all that I said to you
Forget all that you put me through
When why is all I need to know this time
But now I'm crawling
There's no chance I'm crawling back

[Chorus]
You walked out
Your words have no meaning to me
I don't care what you're thinking now
You dropped out
Where is all your faith in leaving
You let me sink and watch me drown

And now I'm waiting patiently
Just wondering what I should believe
I question all I know
And I can't take this anymore
I misunderstood you twice before
I'm losing all my self control
Now I'm crawling
There's no chance I'm crawling back

[Chorus]

I don't know
I don't know 
I dont' know 
I don't know why
I never knew and I despise
All you put me through because

[Chorus]

You let me sink and watch me drown
You let me sink and watch me
You let me sink and watch me 
You let me sink and watch me drown
