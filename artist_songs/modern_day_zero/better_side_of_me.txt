The sooner that I realize
These scars were never there
I could place the blame on you
And now that I'm alone
The silence makes me feel
You could have your way with me
And you know 
You cried that I wasn't there 
So tell me what you want me 
Even though I know I need to 
Get away 
I wanna make you see 

[Chorus]
The better side of me
You turn away and never listen 
Do you see 
The better side of me 
When all these words go right through you 

How could I have known 
By looking in your eyes 
That there was something there for me 
You would love to hide 
Now everything is gone 
So tell me what went wrong 
I guess that we will never know 

[Chorus] 

Do you see the better side of me 

[Chorus] 

Now I can place the blame on you
