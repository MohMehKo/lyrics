We've been so close for so long, It all just seems routine
And although we've never faltered, maybe it's time we come clean
Still these costly mistakes that never seem to penetrate
All your false hopes always come too late
Break me now, take me now
Break me now, take me now

Give me a reason to love you
And tell me why I should care
Give me a reason to want you in my life
All I feel is hate in the air, hate in the air

We were once in a place where we were comfortable
But it never seemed to be the right time
Always making our thoughts so cynical
Never really living our lives
Break me now, take me now

Give me a reason to love you
And tell me why I should care
Give me a reason to want you in my life
All I feel is hate in the air, hate in the air

Call me out, we can figure this out
We don't have to be unlucky with love
Call me out, we can figure this out
We don't have to be unlucky with love
Call me out, we can figure this out
We don't have to be unlucky with love

Give me a reason to love you (to love you)
And tell me why I should care
Give me a reason to want you in my life
All I feel is hate in the air
All I feel is hate in the air
All I feel is hate in the air
Give me a reason
All I feel is hate in the air
Give me a reason
