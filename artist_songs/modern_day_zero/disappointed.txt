I've tried to wipe the tears away from your eyes
But you couldn't see the light, you just played it blind
You mask it with laughter, but disaster came after
I let you have your way, I just want you to know

You left me so disappointed, you pushed me so far away
You left me so disappointed, so sad to see you throw your life away

For all the times, I wasted wishing more for your life
You never took the time to want it for yourself
So you fall into your past, and your light is burning fast
And all I can do is shake my head in my hands

You left me so disappointed, you pushed me so far away
You left me so disappointed, so sad to see you throw it away

[Instruments Playing]

You left me so disappointed, you pushed me so far away
You left me so disappointed, so sad to see you throw your life away

Throw it away
