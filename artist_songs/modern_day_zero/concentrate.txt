Everyday she turns and fades
Every time that I can't see
She could show me the way
This is why I can't breathe

[Chorus]
I just want to sit here
And look at the stars
How I wish I was where you are
Now I fail at everything
'Cause I can't concentrate

When it all turns to gray
Believe me now
'Cause I can't leave
I can't find the words to say
this is why I don't want to breathe

[Chorus]

And now I know this was right
And maybe now I could find
The error in my ways
Maybe now it's not too late
To concentrate

Every time she turns and fades
Everyday I can't see
I just want to sit here look at the stars
How I wonder where you are

[Chorus]
I just want to look at the stars
Look at the stars
