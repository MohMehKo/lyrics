The moon,
On a blackened sky,
Here I wait,
By the light tower,
A pair of lights,
Comes closer down the road on a thunderful night,
He drives me here,
Tonight,
I'll die in black and white,
Just like a Hitchcock star,
Thrown in his arms tonight,
I'll die in Hitchcock pride,
The wind,
Plays with my hair,
As it touches my cheek,
To catch a red tear,
His chin feels rough,
As he whispers in my ear, "Tonight you will die,
As a Hitchcock starlet,"
Tonight,
I'll die in black and white,
Just like a Hitchcock star,
Thrown in his arms tonight,
I'll die in Hitchcock pride,
Tonight,
I'll die in black and white,
Just like a Hitchcock star,
(Hitchcock star)
Thrown in his arms tonight,
I'll die in Hitchcock pride,
I'll die in black and white,
Die in Hitchcock,
Die in Hitchcock,
Style.
