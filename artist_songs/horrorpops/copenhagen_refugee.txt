Do you remember when,
You and I ,
Were still best friends,
Walkin' down all the small streets of Copenhagen,
Our heels were high,
Our laughs real loud,
You and I were two of a kind,
Oh Baby lou you have no clue how much I miss you,

I haven't changed,
I'm still the same,
I'm just a Copenhagen refugee,
You found love,
But I found hope,
As a Copenhagen refugee,
Hey [x13]

We're both doin good as we knew we would,
But for me in LA,
I can be accused of leaving you,
But not that I changed,
Don't you remember when you wanted to do the same,
Oh, Baby Lou what did I do to you,
I'm completely confused,
'Cause,

I haven't changed,
I'm still the same,
I'm just a Copenhagen refugee,
You found love but I found hope,
as a Copenhagen refugee,
Hey [x13]

The west bridge of Copenhagen,
The place were we,
Spent all of our time,
Under the green trees,
Of Copenhagen,
Now I only dream of you,
And the streets of Copenhagen,
Streets of Copenhagen,

I haven't changed,
I'm still the same,
I'm just a Copenhagen refugee,
You found love but I found hope,
As a Copenhagen refugee,
Hey [x13]
Oh,
Copenhagen,
Copenhagen,
Copenhagen,
Dreamer.
