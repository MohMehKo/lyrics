They're not pom-pom dancing giggling girls
They're hard-core fun bunny maniacs
No man can deny them and all men satisfy them

There's no wrong loving-
Just make sure you keep them hungry
If you wanna find them go check the nudie bars

They're all heart breakers
That loves to be house wreckers
Don't give a damn about your rebel yell
Ps-ps-psycho bitches out of hell

They like to cruise around in their vintage cars
And sometimes they even own their own garage
They can't cook, they don't clean
They'll never be good housewives
And they will always mess your live's up
They go further than flirting they're down right and dirty

They don't mind if it hurts, no secrets up their skirts
8 ball bra's and long red claws
Red lips and fine curved hips
Regular man eaters and they're al wife beaters
They hold nothing against a little titty twist yeah!
