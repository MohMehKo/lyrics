I won't stay here no more 
Gone where you can't follow 
I know what i saw 
Im choosing the door 

I'm briefing you shortly 
You're gonna lose 
No matter how you try 
Your just gonna abuse 
Your last breath 
I've been watching you mind 
You've only been working 
On another me 
A smiling female machine 
So you can love me more 

You can kneel and cry 
And tell me why 
But it's not gonna change 
{i can} feel these tears so clear 
When i close my eyes 
Burned in my conscience 
Is the two of you 
Close enough- but not too close 
I saw you both 
And my heart burned
