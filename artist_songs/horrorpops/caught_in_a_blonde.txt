I've got nothing to say 
I'm out of feeling 
You're out of the game 
Go have a whole lot of nothing 
With her. 
My head is spinning 
My tears are drained 

But you've been tamed 
You turned your whole life 
Into something she can hold 
Just when i thought 
Nothing was wrong 
You let me down again 
Just when i thought 
We had it down 
Just when i thought 
You would stay 
You changed your mind 
You chose wrong 

I wish there was 
Something to take 
That would give things meaning 
Give you mind to think 
All her spites made me realize 
You must be numb and a bit dumb 
Dissing me, playing her game 
You've turned your whole life in to 
Something she can control 

Spending time 
On the likes of her 
It's not worth it 
Feeling that you got nothing to give 
Just proves it 
You had more before 
You got caught in a blonde
