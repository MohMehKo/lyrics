Musical correctness 
It's just a guide on how to perform 
Everything less 
Stuffed up opinions, 
Dooms all thinking 
Trying to put everything in a box 
Freaks in uniform, 
Creating norms 
Ot's misguided unity! 

In it for the thrill 
It's got it's own will 
You can go "Na-Na-Na-Na" yourself 
Can't keep it clean, 
It's a live pinball machine 
You can go "Na-Na-Na-Na" yourself 

A dangerous decease 
But I don't wanna be cured 
I don't want to just be pure 
It's low self esteem 
Creates inbreeds 
A zombified closed community 
A brainwashed breed of hypocrisy 
It's misguided loyalty! 

You got it, don't need no uniform 
To know where i belong 
Freak out!
