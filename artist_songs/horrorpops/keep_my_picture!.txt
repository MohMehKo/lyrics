I'm, leaving a note, for you
Surprise, I'm leaving you behind
I made up my mind
It's funny how, funny how, funny how it feels so good
Writing something like this

Hereâ€¦ You can keep my picture
Hang it on the wall
I don't live here no more
That's all you gonna get from me
You could have stopped being a cheater, stopped being a deceiver
It's over... yeah

I had so much to show, so much to give
But you never had the time... time
Or the will to see, I was right there

So You... You can keep my picture
Hang it on the wall
I don't live here no more
That's all you gonna get from me
You could have stopped being a cheater, stopped being a deceiver
We're over

You... You can keep my picture
Hang it on the wall
I don't live here no more
That's all you gonna get from me
You could have stopped being a cheater, stopped being a deceiver
It's over...

Yeah You... You can keep my picture
Keep my picture
Keep my picture

Yeah You... You can keep my picture
Keep my picture
Keep my picture
