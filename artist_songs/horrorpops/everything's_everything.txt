Hey babe,
How you doin' tonight?
Are you feelin' alright?
Am I out of your mind?
But I,
I'm not ready to fold,
I wanna grow old,
With your hands on my heart,
So,
Given in to the scold,
It's not the way I wanna go,
Everything's everything,

Your wide-eyed smile and the tears it evoked,
Your racist words that no one provoked,
I don't want to let you go,

Hey babe,
What's on your mind,
Please tell me you got that IM,
About robbin' me blind,
Of all the time that we spent,
And the only one that's my true friend,
Everything's everything,

Throughout all the pain that's been spoken,
And all the promises that have been broken,
I don't want to let you go,
Erase all these clouds of damnation,
In your eyes I wanna see salvation,
I don't want to let you go,

Your wide-eyed smile and the tears it evoked,
The racist words that no one provoked,
I don't want to let you go,
I don't wanna let go,
I don't wanna let go,
(Never let you go,)
Erase all these clouds of damnation,
(Never let you go,)
In your eyes I wanna see salvation,
(Never let you go,)
I don't want to let you go.
