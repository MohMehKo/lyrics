It's getting close to me 
A touch of something obscene 
I can feel it reaching for me 
Can't get away-get away-get away 

Bring it on! 
Can't move, I can not feel 
Bring it on 
Can't move, I can not see 
Bring it on 
I can't move I have no will 
Bring it on 
Can't move, can't move-can't move 

It's here surrounding me 
Something is putting 
It's weight on me 
It's calling for me 
Can't turn around- 
Turn around- turn around
