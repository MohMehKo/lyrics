So there it lies, the whole mistake.
It eats away on us, it feeds on my mistakes.

Your satisfied smile, tells me it's not all right.
Like a father you watch me confess to all my lies.

[Chorus:]
I did it again, I made a mistake.
You're right now. Aren't you satisfied?
So I did it again, I made a mistake.
You're right now. Are you satisfied?
Are you satisfied my dear?
Are you satisfied?
Hey

So maybe you were right
Maybe I'm not worth the fight
You being right is not, oh it's not nice.

[Chorus x2]

Are you satisfied?

I wish we had the nerve
To be as we were
I wish I could find the root to all good
