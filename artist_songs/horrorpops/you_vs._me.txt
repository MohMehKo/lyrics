Staring in your eyes 
I found a match not to fold 
Riding the first round out, 
I'm feeding on your blows 
A stab in my back 
Got me bleeding on your honesty 
A sneak-punch to my heart 
Leaves us enemies 

Now it's you vs. me 
And me vs. you, come hit me 
You vs. me and me 
Vs. you, come feed me 
Me vs. you and you vs. me 
I ain't leaving 
You vs. me, there's no way 
You beat me baby 
Mainlining hate 
And judging your mistakes 
Leaning on your fears and 
Whispering in your ears- i got you 
You vs. me and me vs. you 

Cornered by my hopes 
You invade my dignity 
A calculated attack 
On my naive personality 
An assault on my place doesn't 
Make you be like me 
A kick to my groin 
Leaves us enemies
