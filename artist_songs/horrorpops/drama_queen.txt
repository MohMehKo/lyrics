You crash my home and you whine
You come inside and you cry
Saying it's not the same as when we began
Because she's all changed, it's not the same
And it's never your fault-no no

Every month the same routine
She's the only one but she's oh so mean
You're just like a teen

You fall in love too hard too much
You fall out of love too hard too soon

Well you sit here in my couch and whine
Maybe you had your hopes too high
Well there's always complaints
And ball and chains
There's always a loss or too much fuss
Come on... Get your heart out of your crotch

Every month the same routine
Hopeless love and endless dreams
You're a dramaqueen
