Going for a ride
My best friend and I
I wink and give her a smile
Hey

Pointed shades
The wind on my face
I light a cigarette

Engine is roaring and
Roads are steaming
Hearts are glowing
Freedom is forever
Angels cannot fall
And Devils won't be caught

We're just gonna drive
Scarves flying high
No direction
Just like Thelma and Louise
Fears left behind
Two girls on a ride
No cage
Just like Thelma and Louise

Music's plying loud
We're singing along
My best friend and I

Nothing is denied and
the sky is our guide and
we cannot be confined, no

Engine is roaring and
Roads are steaming
Hearts are glowing
Freedom is forever
Angels cannot fall
And Devils won't be caught

We're just gonna drive
Scarves flying high
No direction
Just like Thelma and Louise
Fears left behind
Two girls on a ride
No cage
Just like Thelma and Louise

The roads are so wide
They pass our side
No truce
Just like Thelma and Louise
We're just gonna drive
Scarves flying high
No direction
Seems like we'll never die
Fears left behind
Girls on a ride
No truce
Just like Thelma and Louise
Thelma and Louise
Thelma and Louise
Just like Thelma and Louise
