The circle now has come to it's end
You've found somebody new to change
You try to rearrange-put the girl in a pretty cage
It just shows how brave you are

I gave you all and then some more
But that was not enough
I gave and lost and lost and gave
No matter how great the cost

Lets see how much this new girl can take
Lets see how long she can be a fake
You know you'll never be satisfied
You're the one that lies
It just shows how great you are
