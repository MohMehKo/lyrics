Here we stand,
No cash on hand,
And now, man,
have one demand.
But we've been made vagrants,
Abbreviated.
Give us a reason

We’ve been persecuted,
Prosecuted,
Abominated,
Aggravated.
Everything they possibly can do to us, has been done.
Now it's on.
The line has been drawn,
Bring it on.

Here we go,
Here we go,
We’re not alone
Do you want to follow, follow, follow, follow?
We’re on the run
On the land,
That was something out of hand.
We're eye to eye, boot to boot
Step aside
We're tired of being wronged.

Here’s your surprise,
You can’t demise
Your lies.
It’s not a fight,
But a way of life.
And we will arise
With no compromise.

We’ll have them persecuted,
Prosecuted,
Abominated,
Aggravated.
Everything they possibly can do to us, has been done.
Now it’s on.
The line has been drawn,
Bring it on.

Here we go,
Here we go,
We’re not alone,
Do you want to follow, follow, follow, follow?
We’re on the run,
On the land,
That was something out of hand.
We’re eye to eye, boot to boot
Step aside
We’re tired of being wronged.
Here we go,
