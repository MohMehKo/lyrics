Hit 'n' Run 
Hit and run by love 
But broken less than i ask for 
Just another crease 
Another bump to pass by, 
A bruise to heal 

I've gotten the wouldn't you rather be friends 
I guess that could make sense 
If we hadn't kisses 
If you hadn't made me feel like I 
Could never be missed 

Let on by love and crushed by love 
Well, it's nothing to cry for 
I'm not the first to be lied to 
A tainted heart, rancid lust 
Never should, never said 
Never felt sorry 

Everlasting love 
Turned out to be nothing 
Ha- its rather bleak-yeah 
But i've been sucker punched 
One hell of a lot 

Let on by love and crushed by love 
Well, it's nothing to cry for 
No, i'm not the first to be lied to 
A tainted heart, rancid lust 
Never should, never said 
Never felt 
Sorry for falling in love 
A one night off and I wanted more 
But I never felt, never said 
Never been sorry
