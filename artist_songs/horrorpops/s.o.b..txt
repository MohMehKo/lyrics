I wanna do wrong 
I want you gone 
My eyes are burning red from all 
The tears that i have cried 
Now im watching you with her 
And hatred does occur 
Mean, mean man 
Selfish son of a bitch 
I hope i don't miss 
I'm watching you with her 
But im watching you burn 

Eye for an eye 
You sealed my heart with a kiss 
Now i'm taking with it needs 
Lie upon lie 
Nothing left but your cries 
Im taking back what is mine... 

Smiles across my face 
Im standing over you and i laugh 
Straight in your face 
Im taking you home 
The girl has found her stone 

Cold, cold man 
Selfish son of a bitch 
Im glad i didn't miss 
I'm taking you home 
Now we are all alone 

Eye for an eye 
You sealed my heart with a kiss 
Now i'm taking with it needs 
Lie upon lie 
Nothing left but your cries 
Im taking back what is mine... 

You came to my home 
With so many needs 
You craved all i had nd i gave in to 
Your every little desire 
You slept in my arms 
And you sucked from lips 
And when everything 
Was taken.... 

I never cared for guns 
But that night i opened 
The bar keepers box 
And i shot you both down 
A bloody mess of fire 
Was all my heart desired 

Eye for an eye 
You sucked my heart dry 
Now i'm taking what is mine 
Lie upon lie 
No more hurting crimes 
What's left 
Is for you to cry, oh cry 
You sealed my heart with a kiss 
Now i'm taking what it needs 

Eye for an eye 
No longer will i cry 
I'm taking back what is mine.
