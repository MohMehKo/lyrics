Lost in your arms 
There goes my freedom 
Never thought that i, could ache so 
Much for someone 
Avoiding your eyes, feeling im left 
With no disguise 
Please rewind 
Cause i fear that i am falling 

And i don't wanna fall in love 
No i don't wanna trust 
Anyone that makes me 
Wake up smiling 
And makes me blind 

Caught in a trap 
Fell into a trap 

I don't wanna be 
Miss X someone 
Or MRS all-gone wrong 
I don't want you to see 
Exactly what you are doing to me 
But i feel your touch, and im craving 
Your every move 
You're making me feel, like a prom 
Queen with no routine 

And i don't wanna fall in love 
No i don't wanna trust 
Anyone that makes me 
Wake up smiling 
And makes me blind 

Caught in a trap 
Fell into a trap 
Trapped 

Chest infection, a total mind abortion 
I don't wanna fall in love 
A bad injection 
A crazed hallucination 
No, i don't wanna fall in love
