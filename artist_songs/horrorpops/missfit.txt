I don't always tread, dont always tread careful
Yeah
Most of the time im quite anoying
I don't watch my mouth
Don't find an out in a fight!
I can scream and shout and be a loud mouth!

And I, I'm from the wrong side of the town
Now proud
On top of that I'm female!
Nothing, nothing I say is adiquit
According to you I'm a MissFit!
What made you my judge and juror?!

So I don't give into the common trends
Is that something I have to defend?
Who made you my judge and juror?

So I carry my fists, I carry my fists high
'Cause most of the time I know I have to fight
For what I believe in, what I believe is right
Even stupid things like keeping my hair dyed

And I... I'm from the wrong side of the town
Now proud..
On top of that I'm female!
Nothing, nothing I say is adiquit
According to you I'm a MissFit!
What made you my judge and juror?!

So I don't give into the common trends
Is that something I have to defend?
Who made you my judge and juror?

My fist in the middle of your face
My fist in the middle of your....

Nothing, Nothing I say is adiquit
According to you I'm a MissFit
What made you my judge and juror?
Do I dont give in to the common trends
Why is that something I have to defend?
I still stand tall!
