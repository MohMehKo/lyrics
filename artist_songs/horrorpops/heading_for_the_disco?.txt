One, two, three and four
She fluffs her hair, she hits the floor
Spandex pants, wide pink belt
She's got the 80s metal down
I don't get why anyone would wanna repeat this more than once
She goes aye, aye, aye, aye!

And I, I'm stupidfied
She's heading for the disco
I think I'll keep my distance
On the run,
Suburbian fun [x2]

Five, six, seven, eight
She wishes Bret Michaels was her date
Trying so hard to be old school
But goddamned Poison was never cool
I don't get why anyone would wanna dress up as an
80s whore
(She goes Na-na-na-na-na-nah!)

And now, I'm stupified
She's heading for the disco
I think I'll keep my distance
And on the run
Suburbian fun...[x2]

(Whoo!)

She's heading for the disco
I think I'll keep my distance
On the run
Suburbian fun

Disco, disco, disco, disco, disco, disco, disco, disco, disco, disco, diso
She's heading for the disco...
