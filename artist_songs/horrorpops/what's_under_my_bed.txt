It's every night, the same routine
Feels like something is creeping up on me

What's that lurking behind that door
Aarrrghh!

Monsters chasing after me
I get no sleep
I'm running but no matter what
It gets me no where
Something is under my bed
Snapping at my leg

I'm frozen

I'm not freaked out, it creeps and crawls
I can not, I can not sleep with out a light
