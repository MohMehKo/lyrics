They're always there to buy me a drink
They're always there to drive me home
But their hand always kind of slips
From my shoulders down to my tits!

Ghouls, they keep me company
It's like I'm the wife of Halloween
Hey! It's a horror movie theme
Hell I know...

They always wants to see monster movies
So they can hold me when they think I get scared
They are surprised when I'm not turned on
By their fantasies about how it's done
