I want out, this has gone too far
This thing is no good it has no use
I don't wanna be loved by you this way
I jus twant to be me, with everyhing it means
Good and bad!

Too much emotional abuse is a game
We're both gonna lose

I don't like to be told how to dress by you
I don't want to be told how to behave
I don't feel free to be me with you
I don't want to be treated cold
And often left alone
I deserve better than that
