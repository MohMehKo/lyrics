Opening the door, Misfits playing on the stereo
I'm finally home
A tattoo doll awaiting my call

12 needle injection,
Stroked on skin with affection
The buzz of her diced tattoo machine
Makes me wanna cry for more

In for another kick, my skin gets its fix
My body takes a new form, I'm getting reborn
Yeah, I need my ink injection
Baby lou tattoo!

Full thrust on the machine, pins on to my skin
I'm getting my soul reapplied
While my skin is getting dyed
