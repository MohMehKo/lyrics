Tingling mind and too big a smile 
At least i got the room 
Spinning with me 
Trying hard to walk 
A straight line 
I think i lost my femininity 
Another shot 
Hey 
Tipsiness in affect 

On my hands and my knees 
Lost all my dignity 
Just made a pathetic prayer 
Need someone to hold my hair 
A fearsome substance abuse 
But there's so much to choose 
Can't even crawl straight home 
Can't get the keys in the door 

Prickly heart and watery eyes 
I'm ripe to be emotionalized 
Coated tongue and hairy teeth 
I guess im not so ladylike 
A social lubricant... 
Yeah? 
I'm beyond thinking acts
