Can't you feel it 
Something is 
Going on here tonight 
Anticipation 
The boys are gathering up tonight 

It's been so long, it's been to long 
But maybe nothing has changed 
Recognize every single face 
Miss to run with them 
Miss to ride with them 

Rid of all the fear 
That they were gone 
I'm back to where i know i belong 
One with all of them 
I feel I belong 

Can't you read it 
Something is there 
Between the lines 
A special feeling 
One of the pack 
Friends beyond years 

It's been so long 
It's been too long 
But nothing has changed 
Recognize every single face 
Years of conformity, years of absence
