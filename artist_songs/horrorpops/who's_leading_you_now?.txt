Doing everything blind 
Always need a guide 
Someone to make your excuse 
Needing someone 
To hold your hand 
It's always easier when you don't 
Need to take the blame 
Admitting to something you did, 
Just ain't in your capacity 
Nothing is easy 
But you're telling lies 
To place to blame 
On someone else 

Naive, blind, dumb and totally gone 
I'm lost for words, describing how 
You're wrong 

Who's leading you now.... 

Sucking everyone dry 
You don't how to stop 
Leaving me tired and confused 
Emotional vampire, attacking all 
And leaving emptiness behind 
Do you feel wrongly accused 
Reading this, 
You know it must be you 
Demanding, commanding 
Is all you do 
What makes you above the rest? 

Who's leaving you now 

Naive, blind and dumb and totally gone 
I'm lost for word describing 
Just how gone you are 
And i'm tired of explaining just how 
Wrong you are 
Naive, blind, wrong and totally gone
