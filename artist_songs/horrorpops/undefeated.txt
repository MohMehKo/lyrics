When i'm down, you get me up 
I always have you to count on 
When i'm alone, you call 
With a voice 
That makes me smile 
Taking away, the pain 
You remove my infection 
My band, my friends 
My life, my pride 
What keeps me undefeated 

Words that go unspoken 
You know what's in my heart 

Never gonna go back where 
I had no place to roam 
If i start going down again 
You got my back 
And you'll never let me go 

If i go blind from crying 
Cause of all the pain 
That i've received 
You're there to remind me 
That i don't cry alone 
If i start to fumble 
You're there 
To prevent my stumble 
My pain, my grief 
My loss, i'm not so tuff 
You're there to keep the line 
To keep my heart beating 
My brand, my friends 
My life, my pride
