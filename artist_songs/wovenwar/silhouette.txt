You've got a way of finding peace in being incomplete
A silhouette you exhibit, so you'll never have to claim defeat
Cause somehow, someway, someone found a reason to betray

Maybe I can be your shelter, maybe I can be safety
But this silhouette you exhibit will never let you be complete
Cause somehow, someway, someone chose to throw this love...

Away from this
You can find me waiting, when you're ready 
Away from this
Lay your torment down, cause I am with you now

Somehow, someway, we'll find a way to love again
Lay your torment down
It's ok, I'm with you now, I'm with you now
I'm with you now

Away from this
You can find me waiting, when you're ready
Away from this
Lay your torment down, cause I am with you now
