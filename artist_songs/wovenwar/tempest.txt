I'm watching them all fly by
Reaching the greatest heights in my dreams find
I'm needing first a leap to climb

I await the day the stars won't seem so far away and greet a sun the darkened clouds have kept at bay
But until then, until then

My wings they unfold in a storming gale
The tempest calls for my flight to fail
When gravity beckons with its hold
In spite of all the horizon sends wind to take me home

I'll build my throne from broken bones
Defeats I've known and deeds I left untold
My story is the storm

I await the day the stars won't seem so far away and greet a sun the darkened clouds have kept at bay
But until then, until then

My wings they unfold in a storming gale
The tempest calls for my flight to fail
When gravity beckons with its hold
In spite of all the horizon sends wind to take me home

I've seen them shine, seen the rise and fall
Yet kept my course and fared through it all, yet through it all, it all

I've seen them shine, seen them rise and fall
Yet kept my course and fared through it all
[2x]

My wings they unfold in a storming gale
The tempest calls for my flight to fail
When gravity beckons with its hold
In spite of all the horizon sends winds to take me home, the horizon sends winds to take me home
