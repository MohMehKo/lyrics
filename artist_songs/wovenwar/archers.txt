We spent a decade building a band of brothers to the bone, and it showed
From the reef's kiss calling to the resistance rise we wrote
We walked through fire blind
The march echoes for all time

But now the seasons changing
The turning tide
I've raised my sail to coming storm or calm alike

We honed a humble phalanx to raze the arrogance in foes, and it showed
We found a fraud in a Bishop, and built a nation of flawed sons
We walked through fire blind
The march echoes for all time

But now the seasons changing
The turning tide
I've raised my sail to coming storm or calm alike
And though my vessels lone-manned with brazen broken hull
The waves will never take an armored archer core, an armored archer core

A means to believe
A reverie I couldn't reach
Never made a difference to me

Go on, our brother
You've only just begun
Live long with honor
From our fire you are born

But now the seasons changing
The turning tide
I've raised my sail to coming storm or calm alike
And though my vessels lone-manned with brazen broken hull
The waves will never take an armored archer core

But now the seasons changing
The turning tide [2x]
I've raised my sail to coming storm or calm alike, storm or calm alike, storm or calm alike
