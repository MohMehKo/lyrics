A simple thing
A silver gilded link we long to make
To forge our chains and hope they hold the weight
Of a sworn vow to never let down
To never separate

Or so we say

No heart in our words
No faith to be nurtured

To never separate

No heart in our words
No faith to be nurtured
Makes fools of us all
Defaces our nature
Creating a cancer consuming what was loved alive, loved alive, loved alive

Surrendered in ruined ends

Or so we say

No heart in our words
No faith to be nurtured
Makes fools of us all
Defaces our...

No heart in our words
No faith to be nurtured
Makes fools of us all
Defaces our nature
Creating a cancer consuming what was loved alive, loved alive, loved alive, loved alive, loved alive
