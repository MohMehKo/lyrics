Explosions shake the city
I thought it was part of the show
A craven is screaming prayers
In a tongue that I don't know

Paris lights are winking out
I can hear the city scream
While the faithful are rejoicing
In the sound of tragedy

Find me one reason worth this hate
One reason worth this endless violence
Find me one reason worth this hate
Cause I have 130 reasons to change

This stage should be a temple
Where anyone can sing
Yet we are one divided
Waging war over beliefs

Paris lights are winking out
I can feel the city scream
While the faithful are rejoicing
In the sound of tragedy

Find me one reason worth this hate
One reason worth this endless violence
Find me one reason worth this hate
Cause I have 130 reasons to change
130 reasons to change

Parents' cries are ringing out
While their sons and daughters bleed
And the faithful are rejoicing
In the sound of tragedy
