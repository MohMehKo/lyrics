All your merits worth showing are in the weight of a palm
From the hand you've been holding and what's left to pass on

Just as you are there's little offered at all
So fasten tight to your gripping

Pinned to a sleeve
Posing for all to see
With no mark to call your own
Nothing is yours, yours to leave
Beyond who you please

What copels you is gleaming from the glare of a crown
When you cling to lights beaming
It always keeps what you have to shine down

Just as you are there's little offered at all
So fasten tight to your gripping

Pinned to a sleeve
Posing for all to see
With no mark to call your own
Nothing is yours, yours to leave
Beyond who you please

The faithless will always forget, a heartbeat for wants in their head
Forlorn wit needs never met
The blame's on us who'd woven the thread

Pinned to a sleeve
Posing for all to see
With no mark to call your own
Nothing is yours, yours to leave
But if you pin to belief
Own an identity and a mark to call your own
Something that's yours could be seized
Beyond who you please
