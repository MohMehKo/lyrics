Our time is borrowed and forced
We atrophy in your ascension for more
The writing on the wall is fading
Cascading down and blacking out our light
We atrophy in your ascension for more
The words are weighed to chapters closing
The pages kept the ones who've lost their stride

I see you've written out the lines upon the course you'd have us ride
But what if we refuse to sign?

I won't follow you down
You fan the flames to torch the future
While I watch you burn it to the ground
You fan the flames to torch the future
I think I found the answer to the question
Maybe moving on is our salvation
It's pulling teeth to start again

Lines still remain suspend your sentence
An open-ended story you would bind
This ink we bleed is drawn from knowing
You'd lose the plot in trying to survive
It's pulling teeth to start again and again
But what if we refuse to?

And I won't follow you down
You fan the flames to torch the future
While I watch you burn it to the ground
You fan the flames to torch the future
I think I found the answer to the question
Maybe moving on is our salvation

Is this a self-fulfilling prophecy?
Is this your self-fulfilling prophecy?

And I won't follow you down
You fan the flames to torch the future
While I watch you burn it to the ground
You fan the flames to torch the future
I think I found the answer to the question
Maybe moving on is our salvation
It's pulling teeth to start again
