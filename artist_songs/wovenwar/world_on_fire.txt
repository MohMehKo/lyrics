The world has lost its mind
There are liars leading legions of the blind
And no one seems to see the cliff in sight
Are we too far gone to save our lives?

Our house of sand is sinking
How are we surprised?
Senselessness is now a virtue to live by

Fools we are
Drawing from a well run dry
Fools we are
Defending truths we know are lies

Is there more than just performance in their show?
Either back the hand you hold or learn to fold
Are we too far gone to change our minds?

Our house on sand is sinking
How are we surprised?
Senselessness is now a virtue to live by

Fools we are
Drawing from a well run dry
Fools we are
Defending truths we know are lies

Self destruction in the name of progress
Oh, I see the end, I see it
Where do we go from here?
Because faith is running thin

Just look around, the world is on fire
On fire
Just look around, the world is on fire

Fools we are
Drawing from a well run dry
Fools we are
Defending truths we know are lies
Fools we are
Drawing from a well run dry
Fools we are
Defending truths we know are lies

Just look around, the world is on fire
On fire
