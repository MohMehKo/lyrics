Some men are born to reap the harvest
Some men are born to sow the seed
The lines between them are all drawn in
The lie between them is belief

If only we had eyes to see
The lines blurring

Fall in line if you're willing
Defend these shores to the bitter end
Everyone's got a reason
To name the victims and the villains
But who drew lines into the sand?

Does anyone know why we're fighting?
Does anyone know the other side?
The lines between us are all drawn by
The lies that we choose to believe

If only we had eyes to see
The lines blurring

Fall in line if you're willing
Defend these shores to the bitter end
Everyone's got a reason
To name the victims and the villains
But who drew lines into the sand?

Does anyone know the other side?

To build a wall
Between us all
It's our downfall
It's our downfall

Fall in line if you're willing
Defend these shores to the bitter end
Everyone's got a reason
To name the victims and the villains

Fall in line if you're willing
Defend these shores to the bitter end
Everyone's got a reason
To name the victims and the villains
But who drew lines into the sand?
But who drew lines into the sand?
