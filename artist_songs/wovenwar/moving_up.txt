Words that carry me through the length of silences between every day and night
They echo and they slight
Just melodies for any and everyone

So who hears your secret song that warrants its saving?

Your version of our time
The way I kept you down
And how moving on is moving up
So burdened and resigned
Your light was fading out
Easier in than out of...

Here we go again
The call rings out and finds me answering
An air I loathe to hear with meanings left unclear
Just melodies for any and everyone

So who hears your secret song that warrants its saving?

Your version of our time
The way I kept you down
And how moving on is moving up
So burdened and resigned
Your light was fading out
Easier in than out of, easier in than out of...

So reckless with my weakness
Now guarded with your secrets

So reckless with my weakness, I'm not falling again
Now guarded with your secrets, I'm not falling again

Your version of our time
The way I kept you down
And how moving on is moving up
So burdened and resigned
Your light was fading out
Easier in than out of...

Your version of our time
The way I kept you down
And how moving on is moving up
So burdened and resigned
Your light was fading out
Easier in than out of, easier in than out of...

So who hears your secret song that warrant its saving?
