There's a height I couldn't reach
Though I bought the wings to carry me
There's a feeling never found
Though I bought the words to bring it out
But then maybe I was better naive
Maybe I was better when I couldn't see
I felt the water over me
A cold and lonely welcoming
Not a sign they said I'd find, nor the warmth of the sire's hand in mine
But then maybe I was better naive
Maybe I was better when I couldn't see

I have seen a friend-turned-martyr bleed
And for what?
For what a stranger taught to us?
With no authority to speak?

It's always the loudest who voice only their ignorance [2x]
With no authority to speak?

The rock should be an anchor for the weak
Not this
This unfulfilling
This subtle guilting
A prophet of sympathy...

With no authority to speak

It's always the loudest who voice only their ignorance [2x]
With no authority to speak?
And no sense in reasoning

Maybe I was better naive
Maybe I was better when I couldn't see
