I watch the wonder creeping over all the walls we've made
A tragic sly cascade
And I watch it flood away the light from any candle's flame
With wick entwined of late

Can't keep a fire in rain

And the worst of it all is that you know me
And you know that I will fall for it every time
When we collide it's death to rights

Sooner or later we will find new winds to carry home 
the hearts we've turned to stone
And I pray they're strong enough to weather gems from cindered coal
That you have left to smoke

Burned out before the stoke

And the worst of it all is that you know me
And you know that I will fall for it every time
When we collide it's death to rights

How many will we leave wondering? [x2]

It's starts we never finish
And ends we never start
How many lives will break upon our callous hearts?
Will break upon our callous hearts

And the worst of it all is that you know me
And you know that I will fall for it every time
When we collide
Fall for it every time
When we collide it's death to rights
