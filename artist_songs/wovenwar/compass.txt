My sails are torn and I'm lost at sea
The stars refuse to guide me
The ocean's churning and I'm burning to see
What horrors await me
Horrors await me

Hold my breath
Waiting, watching for a break in the storm
For a course worth a chance
But all I am is whipping in the wind
For too long I've let it take me where it will

I see the waves building out of my view
I see the depths past the blackness
There's no surprises left to throw at me
What's another storm to sail?
Another storm to sail

Hold my breath
Waiting, watching for a break in the storm
For a course worth a chance
But all I am is whipping in the wind
For too long I've let it take me where it will

What's the difference?
When the sea has taken all from me
What's the difference?
I'm indifferent

Hold my breath
Waiting, watching for a break in the storm
For a course worth a chance
But all I am is whipping in the wind
For too long I've let it take me where it will
