Wish I could be the pen that writes the end you'll know
Or be the ink that will dry over the lines you stole
Wish I could sew the rope they'll wrap around your throat
Or be the push that will pull you off your throne

Wish I didn't care
Wish I knew if there's a place I can go inside me
To drown the vengeance I'm owed
Or will it burn?
Or will I burn away?

Wish I could be the knife that cuts the ties you hold
Wish I could be the flame consuming all you love
Wish I could tie the weight before the plank is strolled
And I could watch as you sink in sight of shore

(Wish I knew) if there's a place I can go inside me
To drown the vengeance I'm owed
Or will it burn?
Or will I burn away?

Wish I didn't care
Wish I knew if... when the smoke has cleared
Wish I didn't care
Wish I knew if...

...If there's a place I can go inside me
To drown the vengeance I'm owed
Or will it burn?
Or will I burn away?
