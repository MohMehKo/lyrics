Life and death are shaking hands with no regard for my futile plans
And I've licked the wounds and tasted red and nothing mends me now that honor's dead

Life and death in every breath, I hope I choose the words that sell us best
And I've made my bed in the viper's den
Nothing can save me now that honor's dead

I can't rely on this anymore
I can't rely on this anymore

I watched them weave the noose around me
I watched them raise the gallows high
Never saw the fools that hung before me
Never saw a warning sign

Life and death are shaking hands with no regard for my futile plans
And I've licked the wounds and tasted red and nothing mends me now that honor's dead

I can't rely on this anymore
I can't rely on this anymore

I watched them weave the noose around me
I watched them raise the gallows high
Never saw the fools that hung before me
Never saw a warning sign

I watched them weave the noose around me
I watched them raise the gallows high
Never saw the fools that hung before me
Never saw a warning sign

My face is turning blue
From up here it's the best view
My neck is breaking from my own weight
And I'm supposed to say thank you

I can't rely on this anymore
I can't rely on this anymore

I watched them weave the noose around me
I watched them raise the gallows high
Never saw the fools that hung before me
Never saw a warning sign

I've licked the wounds and tasted red and nothing mends me now that honor's dead
