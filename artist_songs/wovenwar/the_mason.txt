No thought is given to the consequences
Just the need to see what might become
It's like we need to sabotage all of the love in our lives
To prove control is so far from undone

And I, I have caved in, again
But I, I'm building from the wreckage

We bend, we break, we're forced to heal
The toll it takes in time revealed

A truth is shown to usher in deliverance
For the weight of the past I can't tow
But like the river where the soul is shaped and withers my home
To a place I barely know

We bend, we break, we're forced to heal
The toll it takes in time revealed
The trial awakes and then creates or tears us down
We bend, we break, we learn to heal
Failings I claim for mason hands to shape
So strike away the grip of past mistakes

And I, I have caved in, again
But I, I have caved in again but

We bend, we break, we're forced to heal
The toll it takes in time revealed
The trial awakes and then creates or tears us down
We bend, we break, we learn to heal
Failings I claim for mason hands to shape
So strike away the grip of past mistakes [2x]
