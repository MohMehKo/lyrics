All the headlines read of tragedies
Force fed to fuel the hate
All the headlines read of tragedies
Stones thrown to separate

So wake up
Wake up
A stone thrown, aimed to separate
So wake up

All talk is cheap
When from the screen
But we believe it all
All talk is cheap
When from the screen
But we believe it all

If the mainstream's reach is what you preach
Whose pockets are you filling?
If the mainstream's reach is what you teach
Whose pockets are you filling?

So wake up
Wake up
A stone thrown, aimed to separate

All talk is cheap
When from the screen
But we believe it all
All talk is cheap
When from the screen
But we believe it all

Further and further they divide us and conquer
Wake up and stand up, we're in this together

All talk is cheap
When from the screen
But we believe it all
All talk is cheap
When from the screen
But we believe it all
But we believe it all
