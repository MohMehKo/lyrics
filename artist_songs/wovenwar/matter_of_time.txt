Pull back the curtain
The one behind it has a different face
The inner workings, the gears are turning at a different pace

Time will change us all

The more that you question
The more the answers aren't what you want to hear

We fight to conceal the truth, but it's all a matter of time, of time
The years wasted, persuaded to smile when it feels so wrong inside, inside

Honesty or deception?
You can only hide it for so long
But we choose to be silent; stick to the story

We fight to conceal the truth, but it's all a matter of time, of time
The years wasted, persuaded to smile when it feels so wrong inside, inside

How can we let ourselves continue this routine?
The artificial beat of a heart that's long since ceased
[2x]

We fight to conceal the truth, but it's all a matter of time, of time
The years wasted, persuaded to smile when it feels so wrong inside, inside, inside

We fight to conceal the truth, but it's all a matter of time
