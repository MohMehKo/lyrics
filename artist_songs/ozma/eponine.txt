Whoa my Eponine, can't you hear the words I sing? 
Can't you hear the words I sing? 

Whoa my Eponine, can't you hear the words I sing? 
Can't you hear the words I sing? 

A crush can never be resolved 
Seems like every resolution ends in tragedy 
Singin' oh, my Eponine 

We swore we'd die 
To end this bolshevik 
And now it's time 
Time to put an end to all your woe 

My Eponine, can't you hear the words I sing?
Can't you hear the words I sing? 

You can't just let this world revolve (oh no)
Seems like every revolution ends in casualty 
Singin' oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, my Eponine 

Before you go 
Just these last words for you 
I love you so 
And love can bring an end to all your woe 

My Eponine, can't you hear the words I sing?
Can't you hear the words I sing?
Whoa my Eponine, can't you hear the words I sing? 
Can't you hear the words I sing?
Whoa my Eponine, you can't just let this world revolve
Can't just let this world revolve
Whoa my Eponine, can't you hear the words? 
Can't you hear these words?

Whoa my Eponine, can't you hear the words I sing? 
Can't you hear the words I sing?
Whoa my Eponine, can't you hear the words? 
Can't you hear these words?

Whoa oh
Whoa oh
