Say hello to your last chance 
Same as your first chance 
A kinder reminder from ozma 

Say hello to the new sound 
Same as the old sound 
So spin it, get in it, and stay 

I knew that the night had an end soon in sight until you called my name 

Say hello when you've spied her 
Sitting on the dryer 
It's spinning, 9th inning, so play 

Say hello like a spider 
Weave a web right beside her 
Spin it, get in it, and pray 

I knew that the night had an end soon in sight until you called my name 
I knew all along i was right but i'm wrong somehow you knew my name 

After the last dance, you lose your last chance 
After the last dance, you lose your last chance 

You lose your last chance 
You lose your last chance 

You've lost your last chance
