When i feel the morning grass i let down my guard 
Because love comes from the dirt in my own backyard 
Everytime i think i've finished being young 
I catch myself having fun 
But the moment passes as the sun moves on 
So i turn myself back to you 

On a diamond in the rough i spent my better years 
I still see her in the crowd with diamonds in her ears 
And it's depressing that i can't forget the tune the organist played 
La da da da da da da, la da da da da da da... 
Everytime i think i've finished being young 
I catch myself having fun 
But the moment passes as the son moves on 
So i turn myself back to you 

Is our season over? 
No four leaf clover 
I feel it's getting colder now that it's late fall 
Can you still remember april to november? 
You and i were members of the best team in baseball 

So we play our games 
I've got a girlfriend 
You've found a new guy but it's not the same 

And so i drive straight up i-5 
To let you know i'm still alive
