Check her out, she's got looks i've only seen in storybooks 
I had one once, read it through, now it's long overdue 

I asked her out, she gave me looks i've only seen on mean old crooks 
I had my chance and now i'm through it's been so long, i'm overdue 

What's so wrong with me and you? 
It's been so long, i'm overdue 
I'm overdue 
Return me back to you

You know the story, you know the story 

Astronaut, cosmonaut, send us up, best you've got 
Once i'm out way too far, i'll beam you shots from the stars 
As long as you promise to return me back to you 

You know the story, you know the story
