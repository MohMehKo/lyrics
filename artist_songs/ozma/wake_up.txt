Take my hand and follow me to bed
Say you didn't really mean it when you told me to go drop dead
Smile that smile that only you can smile
Say you'll love me in the morning after we've slept in a while
Take my hand and follow me instead
Say you'll love me in the morning after we've cleared out our heads

Nightmares, they've been plaguing me
I'm trapped in a fearful mind
Oh... but only til the morningtime

Wake up and love me, baby
So what if we fought last night
We'll start today off right
Let's put it all behind us
Do something to help remind us of how we fell in love

Smile that smile we're only here a while
Say you're never gonna ditch me when true love goes out of style

Nightmares, they've been chasing me
I'm lost in a labyrinth mind
Oh... but only 'til the morningtime

Wake up and love me, baby
So what if we fought last night
We'll start today off right
Let's put it all behind us
Do something to help remind us of how we fell in love

We fell in love
