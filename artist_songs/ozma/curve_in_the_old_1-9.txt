Down at the curve in the old 1-9
There's been a crash that's obstructing the line
And i'm gonna sing you a song that no sane man should be singing
But my ears won't stop ringing
Extraordinary love will save us from the skies above
Only on a day like this
Seal it with a hopeful kiss

Destined to take you down a righteous course
But they won't let you know that they're taking it by force
And down in the depths of my heart there is regret and remorse
But let's not beat a dead horse
'cause the past cannot be changed
History never rearranged

Only with a hopeful kiss
Will we see our way through this

When you wake up, take a look around

Only with a hopeful kiss
Will we see our way through this

When you wake up, take a look around
Watch the pillars crumble slowly to the ground
Watch them as they crumble slowly to the ground
