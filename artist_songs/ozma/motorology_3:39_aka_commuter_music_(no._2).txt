Lie detector's on the blink, so comfort me with doublethink
And let's put wallpaper up between our ears
Over the years
As my attention span disappears
Blink and it's gone
A moment has never seemed so long
I'm still dreaming of clock towers and synchronicity
You call it coincidence - I call it common sense
The truth will set you free if you've been slave to a lie

I'm waiting for a chance to make it known
I'm gonna be the one who keeps you from being alone
I call, I call, I call, I call
No one ever

Used to be political, but now our state is critical
So let's put wallpaper up between our ears
Once it was clear
Maybe I lost it over the years
Maybe it's here
Buried beneath the dirt of fear
Maybe it's still here

I'm still dreaming of clock towers and synchronicity
You call it coincidence - I call it common sense
The truth will set you free if you've been slave to a lie

Oh, I'm still dreaming in sound waves that oscillate and amplify
The feeling of nothingness, oh what a subtle bliss
The truth will set you free if you've been slave to a lie

I'm waiting for a chance to make it known
I'm gonna be the one who keeps you from being alone
I've seen it all before, but I still can't tell
So you better ask somebody who knows

I'm waiting for a chance to make it known
I'm gonna be the one who keeps you from being alone
I've seen it all before, but I still can't tell
So you better ask somebody who knows

You better ask somebody who knows

You better ask somebody who knows
