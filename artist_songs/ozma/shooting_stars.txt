I finally feel at ease, i'm on an eastern breeze 
It blows me into shore 
Come back to kiss my dear, come back to face my fears 
It can't be worse than war 
Unless you say that you gave your heart away (gave your heart away) 
Unless you say that i shouldn't have returned (shouldn't have returned) 
And in that case... i'll go 

Every night i see a shooting star and wonder if it's landing where you are 
If you can see it then you can't be far 
And if that's the way you do it, that's the way you find your love 

Now the air is cold and thin, i'm on my second wind 
It blows me to your door 
Lean into the bell and press 
You're in a brand new dress i've never seen before 
But then you say that you gave your heart away (i gave my heart away) 
And then you say that i shouldn't have returned (you shouldn't have returned) 
So i turn my face... and go 

Every time i take a look around, i find myself looking out 
To a place that looks a lot more round 
I find myself feeling down 

Every night i see a shooting star and wonder if it's landing where you are 
If you can see it then you can't be far 
And if that's the way you do it, that's the way you find your love
