Wesley willis starts to break down, feels the beat and hits the dance floor 
I will listen to the radio, still i can't hear you on the telephone 

It's a shakedown so count from one to three and shake your booty 'til the early dawn 
You gotta be laid back, rock to obscurity 
Then you will really find there's nothing wrong with me 

Three months have passed and no reception has left me searching for another one 
It's too bad that i was believing that you could ever be more than deceiving 

And when i listen to the radio now i'm not thinking things about you 
And all the things you say that drive me crazy 
Could not compare to the things you never say 

Now is the end i will call her a friend 
I won't regret what i said (what i said) 

When i become a man then i will surely see 
That you were just a girl and you were wrong for me 

If you would ever call i know that i'd be home 
Because i'm waiting and i'm all alone
