So it ends 
Round and round the propeller spins 
Seat backs up no tray tables down 
No turning back to this country town 

I already knew blue eyed girl 
Would be halfway around the world 

Air is thin 
Round and round the propellor spins 
Round and round like a carousel 
Round and round feeling not as well 

I already knew blue eyed girl 
Would be halfway around the world 

I can feel it in these undertones 
A fair, light one to have alone 
I can see it in the lights below 
Pilots, mechanics take me home
