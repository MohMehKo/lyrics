It's happening all over again
Someone broke the locks and let the dogs out of the pen
Sound the alarms and let the fun begin
You thought my bark was worse than my bite
But this time i won't be beat before the start of the fight
Leash is too tight
Gonna bite it off

All bad dogs go to doggy hell
All bad cats go to kitty hell

A thousand dogs are loose in the night
You say they're for protection but you use them to fight
Won't see the light until we turn it off

All bad dogs go to doggy hell
All bad cats go to kitty hell
Goodbye my friends, i wish you well
All bad dogs go to doggy hell
