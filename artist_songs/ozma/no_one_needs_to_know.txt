No one needs to know, one needs to know
If a lover's being faithful, one needs to know
If a lover's being true, one needs to know
If a lover's being faithful
And I'm being faithful to you

I don't know what you're thinking we should do
I don't know if the words you say are true
But let me tell you this for sure
The things we're doing just ain't pure
And no one needs to know but me and you

No one needs to know
No one needs to know
No one needs to know, one needs to know 

If a lover's being faithful, one needs to know
If a lover's being true, one needs to know
If a lover's being faithful
And I'm being faithful to you

You don't know all the things she put me through
You don't know if the words I say are true
But let me tell you this tonight
The things we're doing just ain't right
And no one needs to know but me and you

No one needs to know
No one needs to know
No one needs to know, one needs to know 

If a lover's being faithful, one needs to know
If a lover's being true, one needs to know
If a lover's being faithful
And I'm being faithful to you

No one needs to know
No one needs to know
No one needs to know
No one needs to know, one needs to know
No one needs to know, one needs to know

If a lover's being faithful, one needs to know
If a lover's being true, one needs to know
If a lover's being faithful
And I'm being faithful to you
