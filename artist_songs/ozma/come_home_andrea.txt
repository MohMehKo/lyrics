The world we live in is so interesting
A girl make a one man cry make another man sing
Come home andrea, come home andrea
Come home andrea (to me)
There's no denying that our wait is long
It helps if i bide my time with a sad, sad song
Come home andrea, come home andrea
Come home andrea (to me)

'cause nothing ever comes between my darling and her man
There ain't a single thing that can
Tonight i'll be a whore for you and you can dance for me
No money exchanged if we ask the same fee
Come home andrea (to me)

In the morning when you wake
I'm still stuck in a dream
In a different place and time where the sentence always fits the crime
Sweet justice screams

Once this country seemed so far and wide
But you can return to me in a single stride
Come home andrea, come home andrea
Come home andrea (to me)
