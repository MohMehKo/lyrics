I've been looking for a way to find a way to find you 
Turning over every unturned stone 
I thought every one was flipped but i guess eagle rock got skipped 
Cause that's where you've been all alone alone 

Whoa 

I've been trying to find a way to finally up and find you 
Climbing every boulder in my way 
To throw me off your trail you moved to boulder, colorado 
A hop, a skip, and one long jump away 

Whoa 

I finally found a way to find a way to finally find you 
Down where colorado street hits hill 
Find a rock and fling it far above the rocky mountains 
And pray to god it hits your window sill 

I will never skip a rock (i will never skip a rock) 
I will never skip a rock again
