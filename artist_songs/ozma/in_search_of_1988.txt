Every time i start to remember 
I remember i don't want to remember 
Warp me back at 88 if only for one day 

Turn on mario and luigi 
Sit me down put my hands on the ouija 
And when it spells out roisin's name i'll swear it wasn't me 

1988 take me back to 1987 
I'm in search of days 
When times were good and earth a place in heaven 

Now that i jump as high as luigi 
Let's sit down put our hands on the ouija 
When it spells out your sweet name you'll know that it was me 

1988 take me back to 1987 
I'm in search of days 
When times were good and earth a place in heaven 

I want to make a motion to stop the commotion 
I second the motion to stop the commotion 
I got another notion for backwards motion 
I too have a notion back-back-back backwards motion
