I'm telling you a story now of something that's wrong 
This has been developing since nineteen eighty-one 

Maybe she's alone 
What can i do? 
There's nothing 
There's nothing i can do 

If i'm a proper jewish boy 
Will her family love me? 
Can't stand to see her on the stage 
And know she's not thinking of me 

Maybe she'll be hearing this, but probably she won't (probably she won't) 
Possibly she has desires, but probably she don't (probably she don't) 

Maybe she's alone 
What can i do? 
There's nothing 
There's nothing i can do
