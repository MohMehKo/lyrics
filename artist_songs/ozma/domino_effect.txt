Chances last a finite time in the warm july nighttime
Every care that keeps you from your feet is a care that carries your defeat
You better let her rip tonight with a pocket full of kryptonite
Every care that keeps you in your seat is a care that carries your defeat
Sing that song you sang long ago
A heartbeat so sure and slow
Hold me and don't let go
The fourteenth domino

Twenty thousand points of light, sun by day disco ball by night
Every care that keeps you from the beat is a care that carries your defeat

Sing that song that i used to know
The fourteenth black domino
Hold me like long ago
A heartbeat sure and slow

Chances last a finite time in the warm july nighttime
Every care that keeps you from your feet is a care that carries your defeat

Chances last a finite time and you're running out of time
