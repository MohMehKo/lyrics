Your name was given to you
Out of two hearts something new
It seemed too small when you finally grew
But it was yours; what could you do?
You felt that life was a chore 
Keeping your boat close to shore
So you set sail seeking fortune and fame and changed your name
But still it remains
Tied like an anchor onto your heart 
Asking you, "why did we ever part?"
