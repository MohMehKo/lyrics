Of all the shootingstars i knew
I never felt at ease with anyone but you
Don't ever wonder where i go
Remember that the grass still grows beneath the snow
When everything around turns blue
Just fall asleep and wake when it's all through

There's battlescars on all my guitars but i still come out here and play

And now i've lost your touch again
I know i'm only one in 20,000 men
I promise not to let you go
Just close your eyes and sleep right through the falling snow

When i finally wash ashore
I'm coming back to kiss the girl i kissed before
Of all the shootingstars i knew
I never fell for anyone but you

There's battlescars on all my guitars but i still come out here and play
There's battlescars on my face and my arms but you still kiss me everyday
There's battlescars on all my guitars but i still come out everyday
There's battlescars on my face and my arms but you still kiss me anyway
