Black for the hearts below
White heat to melt the snow
Bury the domino
A symbol of your past obsession
It's only a worthless invention

You and me, unsure
Breaking down the barriers of love and war
We're breaking the barriers

Criss cross the signal flow
Life where no life should go
Know what no one should know
When memory in fact is fiction
You're choosing the world that you live in

You and me, unsure
Breaking down the barriers of love and war
We're breaking the barriers

You and me, unsure
Lost between the memories of life before
We built up the barriers

You and me, unsure
We're breaking the barriers
