Hold on before you break me
Give me one more chance

Maybe I don't deserve it
But give me one more chance
To prove my to love you

You can exist in a world without being a part of the world
And somehow that's comforting when you're not where you want to be

But time it is a living thing
I wonder what today will bring
I wonder what the stars will have in store for us

If you hold on before you wake me
Let me dream a dream
As unlikely as it seems
You can exist in a world without being a part of the world
And somehow that's comforting when you're not where you want to be

But faith, it is a knowing thing
Relinquish all control of things
And submit yourself to loving in the highest light
