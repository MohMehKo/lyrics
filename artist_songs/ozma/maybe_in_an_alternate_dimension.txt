Deep in the hills 
There is a hideaway 
That i built with zack, the lego maniac 
I'm never ever gonna turn back 

Maybe in legoland you're mine 
Stop pause record fast-forward rewind 
To the beginning frame 
When i heard your name 

We've tunneled through 
To the outside world 
The front guard is link, the zelda warrior 
I'm never ever gonna turn home
