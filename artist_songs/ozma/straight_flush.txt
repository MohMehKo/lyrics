No rush, straight flush
Leave it up to me, babe
You just wait and see, babe
All of the hard work paying off

No rush, straight flush
If I was the king, babe
I'd buy you anything, babe
Bet you won't regret giving me a run
If you want the odds I'll give you ten to one

Well, what's it gonna be, babe?
Play the hand you see, babe
Bet you won't regret giving me a run
I'm sitting on an ace, and it ain't no bluff

If you want the odds, I'll give you ten to one

No rush, straight flush
