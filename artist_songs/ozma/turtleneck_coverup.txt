A turtleneck will cover that up
So sweat it out and keep your mouth shut
FBI (cover it up), CIA (cover it up)
JPL (cover it up), CNN (cover it up)
Turtleneck (cover it up)
Hope that they're not wondering why i'm never laundering
My turtleneck cover me don't let anybody see
Everything i've come to be since she had her way with me
Turtleneck cover me don't let any body see
From the shadows in the streets hidden eyes are watching me

Even the wolf wears a disguise
So pull the wool down over your eyes
KGB (cover it up), LBC (rap the f#&k up)
MTV (cover it up), FCC (cover it up)
Turtleneck (cover it up)

Hope that mom's not wondering why i'm never laundering
My turtleneck cover me don't let anybody see
Everything i've come to be since she had her way with me
Turtleneck cover me don't let any body see
From the shadows in the streets hidden eyes are watching me

Video cameras in the trees

Video cameras in the trees
Catch her when she comes and leaves
Sometimes i wish i could rewind
I only wish i could rewind
