Fight the darkness
We gotta fight the darkness

To prevent a fire
Burn your dreams with insight

Tear off your cloak
And throw it in the street
Someone could use it anyway
And you'll never feel the cold
'Cause you'll never be alone

Fight the darkness
We gotta fight the darkness

You present desire
Silver strings on gold lyre
Tear off our clothes
And throw them on the floor
Now we don't need them anymore
And we'll never feel the cold
'Cause we'll never be alone

Fight the darkness
We gotta fight the darkness
