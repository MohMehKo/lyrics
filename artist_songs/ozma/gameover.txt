You're hot, stop and drop and roll
I'll jump in the swimming hole so i can hear your cheers
I've seen all the episodes
I know all the secret codes so where i go i don't need roads

I'm flying over, over, i'll fly right over you

2P, you take my control
Teach me how to rock and roll or i'll fall down and die

I bet you don't know how to find our extra lives time ninety-nine
I know you tried but still we died

Our game is over, over, this game is overrated, baby
This game is overrated
Now i'm frustrated
Is there no peace of your heart for a brother?

Reset, can't reset the years
So sad, princess isn't here
She's hiding out with all my fears

Our game is over, over, this game is overrated, baby
This game is overrated
Over, over, this game is over
