Deep inside my eye, there is part of you 
You still look the same, though you're upside down 
So much time has passed since i saw you last 

An apple pie, the number pi, i studied you in math class 
I did all my work but never got your digits 

Take a number like 5, times 10, times 10 again 
500 miles of apple orchards to defend 

Deep inside my core, there is part of you 
You still look the same, though you're grown up now 
Why are you still in my eye? will your memory ever die? 

An apple tree, a family tree, we'll plant ours together 
The roots will hold forever and forever 

What can i say? i won't delay, i'm leaving today 
500 miles of apple orchards in my way 

A mackintosh, a macintosh, you messaged me all winter 
I wrote replies but still felt like a loser 

Pack an apple to eat, go hit the street, get on your feet 
500 miles of apple orchards 'til we meet 

I'm taking a stand , with apple in hand i pull up my sleeve 
It's time that i make like an apple tree and leave
