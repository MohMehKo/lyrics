I'd give my heart if you'd give your attention 
But when i look there's just an open trench (and baby) 

I can't stand to see you, girl 
Showing off your silver party dress 
No, you can't come over now 
The house ain't neat, my room's a mess 

I'd give my heart to just be in contention 
But i sold it off at the baseball card convention 

I can't stand to see you, girl 
Rubbing motor oil on all your joints 
No, i ain't no straight A wiz 
But i could learn, that's not the point (i'll plot my points) 

I'd give my heart if i had one for giving 
I'd give my heart your lips could keep me living 
I'd give my heart and always be forgiving 
I'd give my heart if i had one for giving
