I met you on my lunch break
You were hanging with some other dude
And when you reached for the cupcake
I knew you were my type of girl

One day I know you'll need to follow me (one day we'll go)
I've got the key to room 117
Oh, I'll be there

Lies, some teacher told you you draw like you're blind
Your classmates don't respect you
You're not into design
But just know this cobra's got your back

Remember Pasadena
The way you looked at me and smiled

Somehow I knew that you would follow me (somehow I knew)
Over the bridge to haunt the castle green
Oh, I'll be there

Lies, some teacher told you you draw like you're blind
Your classmates don't respect you
You're not into design
But just know this cobra's got your back

Asi es la vida
I need to let you know
That I can never let you go

Someone you can't see, believes
