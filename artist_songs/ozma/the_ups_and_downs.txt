I've been cheating on you ever since we broke up 
I've been dreaming about you ever since i woke up 
And now my hearing's disappearing ever since you spoke up 

I'll devise a plot to break your heart 
Think up a plan that i'll never carry out 
What's wrong with you? 
Tell me now, what should i do? 

Don't let me down 
I couldn't take much more of your love 
Don't call me up 
I'm so sick and tired of being down 

So i asked you to the show but i knew you wouldn't show up 
You came to my birthday party just to tell me i should grow up 
And then i see another girl and i think i'm gonna throw up 

So i'll devise a plan to nuke your man 
Dirty tricks to come back and take command 
I'll win your hand 
We'll hijack a plane and we're never going to land 

Don't let me down 
I couldn't take much more of your love 
Don't call me up 
I'm so sick and tired of being down
