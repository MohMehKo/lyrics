I'm bored, you're boarding the 504 out of town 
It's late, so look straight, don't pull your eyes off the ground 
You sit and wait across the gate, the minutes stretch themselves so long 
You'll never be my destiny, because my destination's wrong 

Right coast, left coast 
Drifting round and round 
I'm lost, always, and i know i can't be found 

Who made these customs i can't seem to get past? 
It's no use, since you've been born into a higher class 
When i want you, and only you, somehow your baggage comes along 
And it never stops, no, it never stops, until i'm back where i belong 

Right coast, wrong coast 
Drifting round and round 
I'm lost, always, and i know i can't be found 

You can't see me across this great divide 
I'm lost, always, if i'm not right by your side 

Back where i belong 
Back where i belong
