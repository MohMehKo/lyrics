When i woke up this morning i knew what i had to find 
Somewhere there exists a melody that'll make you change your mind 
So i got down to business, did the best that i could do 
Still nothing from these lonely foreign lips could be good enough for you 

If you want to run, put the pedal to the metal 
Show me how it's done, whistling like a kettle 
I know you think you've won, but we've still got a score to settle 
So i step on the pedal that means metal 

If we had just one minute alone, i know what i would say 
This world and i are nothing now, but you make me want to stay 
If you'd drop by to see me again, i'd open up the door 
And get down to all that matters now, which is getting down once more
