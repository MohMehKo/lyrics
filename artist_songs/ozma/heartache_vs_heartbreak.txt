Heartache will get you down
But your body heals once your love has been found
Heartbreak is something else
When you just can't cure the pain that you've found

And we almost believed it was love
Yeah, we nearly perceived it as love
You know I would have sworn it was love

But my mind and body fail me now
And my shining armor's rusted now
It could have been love
It should have been love

You are catastrophe
And I rode your wave, it was carrying me
I am an island now, and it's nevermore
You're gonna be drifting up on to my shore

And we almost believed it was love 
Yeah we nearly perceived it as love
You know I would have sworn it was love

But my mind and body fail me now
And my shining armor's rusted now
It could have been love
It should have been love

And we almost believed it was love 
Yeah we nearly perceived it as love
You know I would have sworn it was love

But my mind and body fail me now
(Oh they fail me now)
And my shining armor's rusted now
(Oh it's rusted now)
It could have been love
It should have been love
