So long ago, I dreamt about a city built on rock and roll, when it fell
So long ago, I knew that it would happen but I couldn't get back to explain
So the future remained the same

Now like the leaves you're gone
It's a fresh cut lawn that I left you on
In the pouring rain, I breathe your name and suddenly I feel happy again

So long ago, I saw you for a moment
But your figure got lost in the crowd
Now I'm looking all over town

Now like the leaves you're gone
It's a fresh cut lawn that I'm lying on
When I start to yawn, I breathe your name and suddenly I feel happy again

I see myself in all of you and all yourselves in me
Shadows underneath my tree

There, hidden in the patterns that present themselves to me
Shadows underneath my tree
I see myself in all of you and all yourselves in me
Shadows underneath my tree
