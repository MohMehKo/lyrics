[Intro]
Uh, yeah!
Tell 'em how to sell it
this propaganda

[Verse 1]
Don't tell me how to keep my composure
It ain't over 'till I get me some closure
Wanted dead or alive here's my profile
Hostile is the frame for my state of grace
Severly a mental disorder
where reality is highly distorted
Psychosis weaken the mind
inclined in small doses
as we approach this
a relentless quest for revengence
while those who expose and pretend this
life, is just a big ball of cherries
a bunch of fairies
screamin' to be scary

[Chorus 1]
It's propaganda
Sell it to the innocent
oh yeah they're buyin' it
just show up to rebel again

[Verse 2]
I'm a maniac
hard one to handle
You'd better come packin more than a scandal
fucked over from the times I've been greatful
fucked over in the times i've been hateful
main attraction fuck you and your prissy [pussy??] mouth
come again flip, now we got some action
on and on is the name that they gave me
and your misery came here to save me

[Chorus 2]
It's propaganda
Sell it to the innocent
oh yeah they're buyin' it
just show up to rebel again

It's propaganda
Sell it to the innocent
fuck yeah they're buyin' it
just show up to rebel again

[Bridge]
Mommy!
Fuck It!
