Heartbreak is a headache,
Like a toothache or an earthquake.
Spontaneous combustion
Leaves a taste that so disgustin'
And it wont go away too fast
I'm a window made of broken glass
I've never needed anything,
Anything but you
And that's whats wrong 
That's what i get 
For feeling this
Anyway...
Just let me know
All I'll miss 
When I'm gone

[Chorus:]
Just throw it all away... you let me down
Like everybody says... you let me down
Write me off like yesterday... you let me down
Oh, I guess that you not good enough to be with me

Rumors are tumors 
Of the sink and mainly useless
When you come to me with these things
It's the shit that I can't deal with 
Still I gave you all of me,
Faithfulness and honesty 
Prayed for God to bring you near,
Along with all these tears.
And that's what wrong 
That's what I get 
For feeling this 
Anyway... just let me know
All I miss
When I'm gone

[Chorus]

I'd like to thank you
For lettin' me know I can feel this way
Feel this way
For lettin' me know I can feel

[Chorus x2]
