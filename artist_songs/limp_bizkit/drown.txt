It's getting closer to the end, every part of me
And then disaster takes it's toll, and now I'm left with only me
Maybe sorrow plays a role, when you feel unkind
Your abuse is medicine, and I'm forever lost in time

Save me
Save me
Before I drown
Save me
Save me
Before I drown

It's getting closer to the end, I look back and smile
We conquered every single bump in my road, made it all worth while
Just remember how I cared, when it came crashing down
I'd like to toast to all those angels that were always hangin' 'round

Save me
Save me
Before I drown
Save me
Save me
Before I drown, oh

Maybe life ain't what it seems, 'cause it's all a dream
Forgive me
Sometimes I feel like a fool, 'cause I'm so uncool
Forgive me...
