The end is near, the summer days
All the great things go away
Feel the cold comin' 'round the bend
Everything's gonna change again

Down another day, down another day

Oh, the winter i adore
Summer's gone forever more
Some days you come back to me
Seasons change to set me free

Down another day, down another day

Don't have to bore you with details (i'll never let you down)
And every morning, the sun rise (will never let you down)
Oh I could hold you tomorrow (i'll never let you down)
When she's golden, the ocean (we'll never let you down)

The end is near, my winter fling
Change is melting everything
Now it's time, to sink below
Season come, season go

Down another day, down another day

Don't have to bore you with details (i'll never let you down)
And every morning, the sun rise (will never let you down)
If i could hold you to my road (i'll never let you down)
When she's golden, the ocean (we'll never let you down)

I keep saying goodbye, saying goodbye
Keep saying goodbye
And she's all that's coming back, she keeps coming back
She keeps coming back
I keep saying goodbye, saying goodbye
Keep saying goodbye
She's always coming back, she keeps coming back
You keep coming back

Don't have to bore you with details (i'll never let you down)
And every morning, the sun rise (will never let you down)
If i could hold you tomorrow (i'll never let you down)
When she's golden, the ocean (we'll never let you down)

Down another day, down another day
(we'll never let you down)
Down another day, down another day
