Build a bridge to your mind
Takes me there everytime
Lay it all on the line
There's a way
Build a bridge, make a path
Overlook the aftermath
Make my tears be your bath
There's a way
Only'd if you take a ride
Go with me to the other side

Even though it's gonna crumble down
I'll keep building till you come around
Even though it's gonna fall apart
Break my heart
I'll keep building till I die

Build a bridge of memories
Stretch it out over seas
To the end of the world
There's a way
Build a bridge made of pains 
Send my longing down the drain
Have no reasons to complain
There's a way
Only'd if you take a ride
Go with me to the other side

Even though it's gonna crumble down
I'll keep building till you come around
Even though it's gonna fall apart
Break my heart
I'll keep building till I die

Wait...wait for me...
Wait...please wait for me...
Wait...wait for me...
Wait...please wait for me...

Even though it's gonna crumble down
I'll keep building till you come around
Even though it's gonna fall apart
Break my heart
I'll keep building till I die
