Hold up it's the motherfuckin' concrete
Suicidal nightshift loaded with a vice grip
Poppin' all you copies
Who keep waterin' down shit
Thinking you can rap with that artificial outfit
Your baggy pants and bottle of crack hits
Fuck all of that shit
Fuck all of you posers
Let go of the mic kid
Step into a world that you've never seen
When i'm fiening for a microphone
I'm a microphone fiend

Bring on the motherfuckin' cutthroat,
Territorial piss off
Spit the deadly and ready for lift-off
Who's getting their shit tossed?
Is it the one kid running his mouth
That he's sucking his thumb with?
You're damn straight
I'll put it right in 'em
No anti-venom for the buck-buck
See a world that you've never seen
When i'm fiening for a microphone,
I'm a microphone fiend

[Chorus:]
Give me a motherfuckin' mic y'all
Give me a mic y'all
Give me a mic so i can rock it right y'all
I'm out of sight y'all
I'm out of sight y'all
I'm out of sight when i'm blowin' up the mic y'all
You know it
You know it

Hold up, check out the motherfuckin' tv
Same song, same bands everyday, fuck that
I'll blow those motherfuckers away, you wantin'
To hear some heavy ass metal that can
Penetrate deep into your ear drums?
Turn it up, motherfucker
Turn it up, motherfucker
Turn it up and step into a world that you've never seen
When i'm fiening for a microphone, i'm a microphone
Fiend

[Chorus]

It's a crazy crazy world playing crazy
Crazy shit on this crazy radio, I'm really sick of it. 
I'm a crazy crazy man with a crazy crazy plan
To destroy every crazy-ass wannabe b-b-b-bands, ha-ha

[Chorus]
