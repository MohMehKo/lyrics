[Scott Weiland]
You keep your distance,
I can't deny you.
I got the feeling, can't satisfy you.
I got your picture on the wall.
I got the picture long gone.
You keep your wishes, (Keep your wishes)
I'll keep my feelings.
There goes another one that kept me breathing.
[Duet] I'm waiting for you,
I know you're leaving
[Duet] I'll still adore you,
You never need me.

[Chorus]
[Duet]
Hold on.
I've found another way to let you go, away.
Hold on.
You find another way to bleed my soul, away.

[Fred Durst]
The things you told me,
To hear you speak.
I'm burning slowly,
I'm growing weak.
You bring me closer to yesterday,
Yesterday's a million miles away.
Why can't you hear me? (Why can't you hear me)
Why can't I sleep? (Why can't I sleep)
And I don't understand what keeps me breathing.
I'm waiting for you. (I'm waiting for you)
I know you're leaving,
I'll still adore you,
You'll never need me.

[Chorus]
[Duet]
Hold on.
I've found another way to let you go, away.
Hold on.
You find another way to bleed my soul, away.

[Chorus]
[Duet]
Hold on.
I've found another way to let you go, away.
Hold on.
You find another way to bleed my soul, away.
Hold on.
I've found another way to let you go, away.
Hold on.
You find another way to bleed my soul, away.
Hold on.
Hold on.
Hold on.
Hold on.
