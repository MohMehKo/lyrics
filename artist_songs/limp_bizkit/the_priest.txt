[Intro]
It could be the absense talking
I dont think so
I dont either
Ive gotta find a new place
A new place to feed
Gotta be

[Pre-Chorus]
Stop everything, something is not feeling right
The planets are not all aligned
I know when I felt this before
My evil is thirsty for more
I need a new allie to feed

What can I do?
I've got an idea

[Chorus]
I think I'll just become a priest
Decieving them with my belief
I'll preach about what life is worth
And cover my sins with the church
My demons can run around free
No one will suspect a thing
I'll show them its okay to lust
A priest is a church you can trust
I found a new allie to feed

[Hard Chorus]
Baptized by the unexpected
Terrorized by the imperfections

[Pre-Chorus]
Somethings not right
The planets are not all aligned
I know when I felt this before
My evil is thirsty for more
I need a new allie to feed

What can I do?
I've got an idea

[Chorus]
I think I'll just become a priest
Decieving them with my belief
I'll preach about what life is worth
And cover my sins with the church
My demons can run around free
No one will suspect a thing
I'll show them its okay to lust
A priest is a church you can trust
I found a new allie to feed

[Hard Chorus]
Baptized by the unexpected
Terrorized by the imperfections
Baptized by the unexpected
Terrorized by the imperfections

[Bridge]
Oh my god
Im watching TV
I cant
Oh whats this world coming to
I see a priest molesting children
I see terrorists blowing up buildins
I see someone in rage
Killing Dimebag on stage
What the fuck is this?
What the fuck is this?
I got a kid
Should I send him to Sunday School?
I got a kid
Should I send him to Sunday School?
So you can fuck him
Oh no you aint gonna fuck him
How bout this?
I dont fucking know who I can trust
In this world and I'm gonna blow
One more time
I'm not that scared

[Pre-Chorus]
Something is not feeling right
The planets are not all aligned
I know when I felt this before
My evil is thirsty for more
I need a new allie to feed

[Hard Chorus]
Baptized by the unexpected
Terrorized by the imperfections
Baptized by the unexpected
Terrorized by the imperfections
