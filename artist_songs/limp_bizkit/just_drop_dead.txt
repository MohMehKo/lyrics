Ok, where the hell you been? 
Said that you'd been hanging with your cute girlfriend 
Then I get a call, kinda woke me up 
Said that they saw you chillin' with this young little fuck, 

I was kinda dazed and maybe confused, 
Never woulda expected this terrible news, 
Not only were you kissing this fool you been dissing 
You were playing me out 
Now you better listen 

What the fuck is going on? 
Who the fuck do you think you are? (Bitch!)
Cause for alarm 
Put up with your shit, begging me to stay
Even though you run your fucking mouth everyday! 
I ain't some punk ass dealing with your drunk ass 
Sure your mighty fine 
But you crossed the fucking line 
Now there's no returnin' 
This lesson that your learnin' 
Pulling down your panties 
And leave your ass burnin' 

[Chorus:]
Cause I deserve more, 
I deserve more 
You act like a whore 
So just drop dead 
Just drop dead 

Rewind 
Back to the start (Go)
When we got together I gave you my heart 
You made a few mistakes 
But that's how it goes 
And every time I broke up you gave my ass a rose (aww)
Saying that your sorry 
And I'm the only one 
Believed you like a chump 
While you were having fun 
I was feelin' lonely 
While you were with your hommie 
Ain't that a bitch? 
Now your boy can blow me 

What the fuck is going on? 
Who the fuck do you think you are? (Bitch!)
Cause for alarm 
Gonna put your shit begging me to stay 
Even though you run your fucking mouth every day! 
I ain't some punk ass dealing with your drunk ass 
Sure your mighty fine 
But you crossed the fucking line 
Now there's no returnin' 
This lesson that your learnin' 
Pulling down your panties 
and leave your ass burnin' 

[Chorus x2]

Theres love 
Theres lust 
Then blood 
Then guts 
Your touch 
My crutch 
I trust you way too much 

Theres love 
Theres lust 
Then blood 
Then guts 
Your touch 
My crutch 
I trust you way too much!! 

You gotta lotta fuckin' nerve! 
Ya think this is a fuckin' tennis match? (Bitch!)
Time for me to serve
John Mackinroe 
Ready for me ho? 
Its 15-love 
Where the fuck they gonna go? (Huh?)

Where the fuck you gonna go? (Huh?)
Where the fuck you gonna go? (Huh?)

What the fuck is going on? 
Who the fuck do you think you are? (Bitch!)
Cause for alarm 
Gonna put your shit begging me to stay 
Even though you run your fucking mouth every day! 
I ain't some punk ass dealing with your drunk ass 
Sure your mighty fine 
But you crossed the fucking line 
Now there's no returnin' 
This lesson that your learnin' 
Pulling down your panties 
And leave your ass burnin' 

[Chorus x2]
