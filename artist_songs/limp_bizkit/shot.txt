SHOT,
SHOT.
your the cure,
your my animosity,
your the cure,
your my date with jealousy,
I could be wrong,
I could be rite,
I play along,
avoid a fight.

SHOT,
SHOT.
Your the sun,
Your the light that burns my eyes,
Your the sun,
Your the darkness I despise,
I could be wrong,
I could be rite,
I play along,
Avoid a fight.
You've fucked me up in the head,
But its alright
Now your hero is dead
And I'm alright

SHOT,
SHOT.
Your the angel in everybody's dreams,
Your the angel that doesn't (wanna weeze??)
I could be wrong,
I could be rite,
I play along,
Avoid a fight.
You've fucked me up in the head,
But its alright,
Now your hero is dead,
And I'm alright.
Give it up
Run away
Make it last
Make it stay
Never hide
Never know
You don't want me to go
Everyday
I don't know
I don't care
Take it slow
From the mist
From a lie
You don't want me to go

I could be wrong,
I could be rite,
I play along,
Avoid a fight.

You've fucked me up in the head,
But it's alright,
Now your hero is dead,
And I'm alright. [x2]
