Run, is that all you can do?
It's all you've been doing since you been 2
You just run, you run away from change,
Leaving me bleeding but you can't see.
You're so dumb, with your big dumb face
And your big dumb ego
What a disgrace, let it go
What a disgrace, let it go

Wait, I ain't waiting for shit,
Coz when you're waiting on something, all you can get is a fix
Yeah you were just my fix,
Punchin' your card in for all you can get.
You're so dumb, with your big dumb face
And your big dumb ego
What a disgrace, let it go
What a disgrace, let it go

What hurts so much,
Is I believed you to be a true friend all along
But you never cared
You never cared

That I had your back,
Through all the confusion, through all the abuse
And I cared, no matter what you said,
But now you betrayed me, embarrassed and plagued me
So dumb, with your big dumb face
And your big dumb ego
What a disgrace, let it go
What a disgrace, let it go

What hurts so much,
Is I believed you to be a true friend all along
But you never cared
What hurts so much,
Is I believed you to be a true friend all along
But you never cared,
You never cared.

I always used to say,
Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer,
I always used to say,
Dig a hole for the next man and you'll fall in,

I always used to say,
Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer,
I always used to say,
Dig a hole for the next man and you'll fall in,

I know, you know, that you're ready to fall in
I know, you know, that you're ready to fall in
I know, you know, that you're ready to fall in
I know, you know, that you're ready to fall in

Too late now, afraid now
Of all the things I could say now,
It's too late to, complain you
Don't deserve a word... now!

Too late now, afraid now
Of all the things I could say now,
It's too late to, complain you
Don't deserve a word

What hurts so much,
Is I believed you to be a true friend all along
But you never cared
What hurts so much,
Is I believed you to be a true friend all along
But you never cared.
