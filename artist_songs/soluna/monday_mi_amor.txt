On Monday morning I feel blue
And, boy, it's all because of you
On Tuesday heartache is my friend
I feel like we have reached the end
On Wednesday I pick up the phone
I'm tired of being all alone
We've been apart too many days
So, boy, you better change your ways

Boy, you're in my dreams
But what can I do
Will you love me true
Hold on to my heart
'Cause I'm falling for you
Stop playing games
I know you can't hide
What you feel inside
Borrando cada dolor
On Monday mi amor

On Thursday I give you a chance
To show me some of your romance
When Friday comes you hold me tight
And whisper sweet things through the night
On Saturday I realize
Your ways have got me hypnotized
On Sunday I make love to you
You are my every dream come true

Boy, you're in my dreams
But what can I do
Will you love me true
Hold on to my heart
'Cause I'm falling for you
Stop playing games
I know you can't hide
What you feel inside
Borrando cada dolor
On Monday mi amor

There was a darkness in my heart
And then I found you
Don't ever want to be apart
And live without your love

Boy, you're in my dreams
But what can I do
Will you love me true
Hold on to my heart
'Cause I'm falling for you
Stop playing games
I know you can't hide
What you feel inside
Borrando cada dolor
On Monday mi amor
