(nothing looks good on me but you) 
(nothing looks good on me but you) 

Tried to go on without you 
That doesn't seem to work 
I tried to forget all about you 
That only hurts me worse 

Well, I try on smile but it doesn't feel right 
Everyone knows that I'm fakin' 
But I say goodbye with the tears in my eyes 
Baby, my poor heart is breakin', breakin' 

[CHORUS]
Can't help what I'm feelin' when 
I look in the mirror; it 
Couldn't be any clearer 
Cuz nothing looks good on me but you 
I just have to say that 
Baby, you're the greatest and 
I don't think I can shake it 
Cuz nothing looks good on me but you 

And you know it 
Baby, why don't you turn back 
I miss the way that you hold me 
Like in that picture of you makin' me laugh 

Well, I tried to go out with some other guys 
But that only put me back where I started 
Cuz deep down below I'm just dying inside 
Knowin' full well where my heart is, heart 

[CHORUS]

(nothing looks so good on me but you, baby...)

No baby, nothing fits 
I can't make any sense of this 
Just thinking about your lips on mine 
I need you to know 
I made the biggest mistake of my life 
I need your love so 
Can we talk about it tonight 
Baby, let's talk about it 

[CHORUS 2X]

(nothing looks so good on me but you, baby) 
(you're the best thing I ever had) 
(nothing looks so good, no no) 
(nothing looks so good on me but you) 
(nothing, nothing looks good on me but you)
