Can't you see 
You mean everything to me 
You're in my heart 
You've touched my soul 
You're all I'll ever need 
And it hurts so bad 
Not to have you by my side 
Nothing's right; I cry all night 
Just waiting for your call 

[CHORUS]
I'll be waiting for you till the sun don't shine 
I will wish on a star to make you mine 
I'll be dreaming all night that you're by my side 
I'll be waiting for you 
Said I'll be waiting for you till the end of time 
Can't you see that I need you in my life 
You're all that I want; I can't deny 
I'll be waiting for you 

(I'll be waiting for you...) 

Love is hard 
When the days can seem so far 
We were both inseparable 
And now we're torn apart 
I refuse to try again 
To love to someone new 
Cuz what we shared was heavenly 
Like a rose that's in full bloom 

[CHORUS]

(I'll be waiting for you...) 

You make me so happy 
I never thought I'd lose you 
You're love was and still is 
The only thing I run to 

[CHORUS]

Every minute of every hour 
You know I'll be waiting for you
