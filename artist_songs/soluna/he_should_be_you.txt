He doesn't taste like you
He doesn't touch like you
No, I know he can't replace
What never, never went away
There is no substitute
For what I shared with you
No, I know it's not the same
When he, when he calls my name
Does he know that when he's looking in my eyes
I'm thinking in the back of my mind

He should be you
How can it be
That the man I wanna love
Is not the man who's loving me
It should be you, it should be me
Don't want to hurt him but it's true
He should be, he should be you

Thought I was over you
Thought I had spent enough
Time alone living, living on my own
I guess I fooled myself
By thinking I could tell
A broken heart when it should start
Do you know how hard I've tried to let him in
Kept thinking that in time there'd be a spark

He should be you
How can it be
That the man I wanna love
Is not the man who's loving me
It should be you, it should be me
Don't want to hurt him but it's true
He should be, he should be you

How do I let him know
How do I let him go
What'll I say to him to explain
It's not that I don't care
It's just that it's not fair
When I look at him I feel this way

He should be you
How can it be
That the man I wanna love
Is not the man who's loving me
It should be you, it should be me
Don't want to hurt him but it's true
He should be, he should be you

He should be you
How can it be
That the man I wanna love
Is not the man who's loving me
It should be you, it should be me
Don't want to hurt him but it's true
He should be, he should be you

(He should...) He should...
He should be you oh baby
(How can it be) How can it be
(He's not loving me) He's not loving me
(It should) It should
(It should be you) It should be you
Don't want to hurt him, its true
He should be you

He should be you
How can it be
That the man I wanna love
Is not the man who's loving me
It should be you, it should be me
Don't want to hurt him but it's true
He should be, he should be you
