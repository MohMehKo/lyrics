Like a dream, a childhood fantasy 
You came to me, wiped me off my feet 
Like paradise lookin' in your eyes 
You take my breath away 
Baby, I'm here to say 

You make me feel special 
You're all that I need and more 
Fairytales do come true 
Cuz they did when I met you 

[CHORUS]
The only time I ever fell 
I fell for you 
Now I'm so in love 
So deep in love with you

When I'm with you, I get lost in time
When we're hand in hand
Our dreams intertwined
On and on like drifting off to sea
Never ending, you're all I need

You make me feel special
You're all that I need and more
Fairytales do come true
Cuz they did when I met you

[CHORUS 2X]

You make me feel special
You're all that I need and more
Fairytales do come true
Cuz they did when I met you

[CHORUS 2X]

(You make me feel special)
The only time I ever fell
(you're so incredible)
I fell for you
Now I'm so in love...
