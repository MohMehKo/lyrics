You've been the first in my life
Who has ever made me feel this way
And I will not deny
I'm gonna need you right here
By my side

Baby, I can't wait
(come and hold my hand and let me lead the way)
Let me take your breath away
(by holdin' and kissin' and lovin' and touchin' you)
Never will be too late
(see myself through your eyes)
Baby, I can't wait
(until the day I hear you say)

[Chorus]
You are mine
There's no other one for me
Keep in mind
You make my life complete
And tonight
We'll make love endlessly
Cause you're mine
You're the one that I'll keep
For all time

Now that you're here, boy
I'm never gonna let you go
Can I touch you there, oh
Do you mind if we kiss real slow
You're my everything
You're my hopes and dreams
Baby, you know it ain't no lie
I'm gonna be with you till the day I die

Baby, I can't wait
(come and hold my hand and let me lead the way)
Let me take your breath away
(holdin' and kissin' and lovin' and touchin' you)
Never will be too late
(see myself through your eyes)
Baby, I can't wait
(no no, 'til the day I hear you say)

[Chorus]

You're the one that lights my fire
You're the one that keeps me strong
You're the one that I depend on
When my world is goin' wrong
You're the one that I hold closer
You're the man I'm dreaming of
And I really really love you
I just want you to know that

[Chorus 2X]

I can't wait till the day
I hear you say
You're the one that I need
You're the one that I'll keep
For all time
