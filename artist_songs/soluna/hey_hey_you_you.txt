I don't wanna be the one you touch 
I don't wanna be the one you love 
Never gonna be the one you need 
These are things that I can't be 
Not denying that I sense 
Something more than just friends 
I've already got a man 

So when I'm standing next to you 
Gotta respect that he's not you 
And understand that I can't do 
What you're askin' me to 

[CHORUS]
Hey hey you you 
I figure it's true true; yeah yeah 
You know what you do to me; it's crazy 
I'm someone else's baby 
Hey hey you you 
You're makin' me hot hot; stop stop 
Before we go farther than I want to 
Hey you; don't make me choose 

(you're gonna lose...) 

Maybe in a different place or time 
I woulda made you mine 
But the reality is this 
I love the man I'm with 
Yes, I know there's energy 
Felt between you and me 
But if you're gonna make me choose
Between him and you

There's no contest
Between his love and your bed
You see, I thought it over but 
There really is no choice 

[CHORUS]

(you're gonna lose...)

Hey you (hey hey hey hey)
I feel you; you know it's true
You're makin' me so crazy (so crazy, I can't...)
I'm someone else's baby (someone else's baby)
Hey you...yes, you 

[CHORUS 2X]

(you're gonna lose...)
