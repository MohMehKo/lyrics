Here... We are...
Going back to the start
When I thought we've come so far
And I.. I try...
Tried to make you understand
I've done everything I can

Every night I'm losing sleep
Tell me if I'm in too deep
I'm going... crazy
I don't know what I should do
To fight the risk of losing you
Baby.. Ay yi!

Don't Want to live my life 
Without you
Can't go another night 
Without you
Don't Want to live my life 
Without your Love
Without your love
Without your love

There you go
Hiding everything you feel
Too blind to see what's real
You.. Forgot...
Everything I was to you
The sun, the stars, the moon

I don't know what i've done wrong
Tell me whats been going on
Inside you... lately
I just wanna do you right
I cant go another night
Baby... Ay yi!

Don't Want to Live my Life without you
Can't go another night without you
Don't Want to live my life without your Love
Without your love

Don't Want to Live my Life (dont want to live my life) without you
Can't go another night (cant go another night) without you
Don't Want to live my life (whoa ooohhh..) without your Love
(without your love)
Without your love

Dont want to live my life... without you
Dont want to live my life... without you
No, No, No
Without you

Here... We are...
Going back to the start
When I thought we've come so far

Don't want to live my life without you
Can't go another night without you
Don't want to live my life without your Love
(without your love) Without your love

Don't want to live my life without you
Can't go another night without you
Don't want to live my life without your Love
(oohhh...) Without your love

Don't Want to Live
Don't want to Live
Don't want to Live
Don't want to Live
Don't want to Live
Don't want to Live
Without You... Without your love...
Don't want to Live
Don't want to Live
Don't want to Live
Don't want to Live
Don't want to Live
Don't want to Live
Without You... Without your love...
