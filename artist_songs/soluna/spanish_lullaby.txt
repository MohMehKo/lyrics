(oh, te amor, te amor, te quiero) 

I have always dreamed to find someone like you 
No more lonely nights I'll never make it through 
Won't you say you will fulfill this empty part 
Cuz I've been searching for what's missing in my heart 

My Spanish lullaby 
For you are my Spanish lullaby 
You are the star that lights my night 
And with you I'll make my dreams come true 
Underneath the starlit moon 
You're my Spanish lullaby 

[CHORUS]
Come with me to a place 
Come feel my warm embrace 
There's is so much I have to give 
(You don't know, you don't know) 
Come feel my passion rise 
There's so much I have inside 
So much more life you have to live 

And I never will abandon what we share 
For I cherish every moment that you're near 
I will never let you shed a tear for me 
Cuz every ounce of love I give to you 

You're Spanish lullaby 
And I'll be you're Spanish lullaby 
I'll be the star that lights your night 
And I'll make all your dreams come true, yeah 
Underneath the starlit moon 
(Spanish Lullaby) 

[CHORUS]

You're my beautiful melody 
No querido estas sentir 
Quien es mi amor 
I can feel your love calling for me 
De amor, de quiero 
You're my Spanish lullaby 

Come...passion rise 
Have inside... 
You're my Spanish lullaby 

[CHORUS 2X]
