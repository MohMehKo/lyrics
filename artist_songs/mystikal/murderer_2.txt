Motherfuckin' Murderer [x4]

into the tick-tock of the wee hour
shit started to get sour
she was killed by that fuckin' coward
how could nothin' take so much and
no more was uppin' no more huggin'
but his conciense know the truth so he fucked up and
her memories was all that was left so to that I'm clutchin'
she was taken out of your reach now you can't touch her
unfortunatly also taken from us so we gotta sufer
?dabalin'? down to that last supper
gotta hustle
feelin' my album shake the devil up
reconstruct this motherfucka
I never slowed down just throw it down like I know how
thought I do it like she would have wanted me to do it
I still can't believe I lost her in the worst way
she died wearin' my very first T-shirt on my birthday
now what the fuck I'm supposed to celebrate
would have celebrated if I caufgt his ass
but I got in my ?bed? and its too late
everybody gotta roll they must play
no hollerin' when to pray 
but this mutherfucka gotta pay
there will be no reasonable excuse for what you've done
even ignored him when he started stealin' from me
cause them was crumbs
a raindrop to a river
huh, a sinner to a christian
a holler to a whisper
she was the sole reason that I got along wich ya
but I'm a never heal from the scars of what you did to my sister
MURDERER!
