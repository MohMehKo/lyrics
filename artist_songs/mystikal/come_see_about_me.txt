[Da Brat]
If I do somethin’ you don’t like

worst way to kill em’ is to hit the top of the charts 
first week out R&B billboards
leave yo fake ass manger home 
and if you need a nigga to come see about me

I keep my enemies at fault 
Don’t need em’ friendly 
I make at least 25 just to breathe on the beat 
Tell me … how many niggas wanna FUCK this bitch named Brat

[Mystikal]
This one is for your Majesty, his Lordship, your Excellency 
Bitch barely can see me 
Definitely know they can’t stand next to me 
Dick get hard like rot wielder’s  (you can handle it)
You know that funky break down get y’all shit adrenaline standin’
Gon’ kill em’ in New Orleans like killa’s from Georgia 
As cold as artic recorded in Georgia
90 proof thru the roof 
Y’all niggas pink lemonade 
I hit the booth yo hold group bes’ ventilated 
Such a bunch of cowards 
Ain’t worth the dirt that come off my ass and 
Go down the drain when I take my shower
My Expedition be a Eddie Bauer 
Sometimes I gotta comb these fuckin’ rappers hair 
fix they collar
Wanna be like me? 
Want to take yo picture? Write that down
Be a man and tell them bitches what you calls em’
I’ma south cowboy 
Howdy!!
Call them people tell em’ see about me 

[Chorus]

Come see about me 
You got a problem?

[Mystikal]
Come from out that Cajun 
I stay ragin’
Keep it blazin’ 
bitch I’m crazy 
half-man 
half- amazin’
half way off the charts 
and bitch I’m half-way in yo ass 
I’m only….half way with this track and got half y’all mad 
Damn !
Soon as I come in this bitch you know I’m comin’to spit you somethin’ 
The microphone is considered a bad rappin’ muthafucker
I’ll bust yo ass up 
Like a muthafuckin’ bug stuck on the windshield wiper washer
I gets a temper tantrum, for Mr.Shit-Talker
The funk havin’ champion knock your shoes off 
I’ll cut cha’ like I’m new barber
with no guard on 
bitch I’m stupid like I lost a few marbles 
still ballin’ 
still tossin’ em’ 
still holdin’ Mc’s hands takin’ they ass across the street walkin’ em’
so let me know when you’re ready to bust and go head on the pavement 
bring yo ass you don’t need no fuckin’ invitation

[Chorus]
You’ll like me? 
Come see about me 
You got a problem?
Come see about me
Then hurry up 
Come see about me
Come see about me
You’ll like me? 
Come see about me 
You got a problem?
Come see about me
Then hurry up 
Come see about me
Wsup whodi!
Come see about me
Come see about me 
Come see about me
