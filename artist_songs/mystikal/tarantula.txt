[Mystikal]
Oh bitch I'm country as cowboy boots
High debut beating boy band groups
Nigga let me know what the fuck y'all want do
Either keep up or you can't, can't
Met 'em through a bar-b-q, cracker through yo' thang, thang
I ain't come here for no dumb shit
You think you one of the hardest nigga, lyrics of the drum kick
When it's finished over and done with
I'ma smoke a blunt and knock the pussy off of some bitch
I ain't no speedy when you say I beat it too much
I ain't gone eat it, you ready go drown me and I pound it enough
See me losin' fuck the big butt women
Woman walkin' funny pussy up in her stomach
Sittin' in the front cause T.V.'s runnin'
Peanut-butter leather seat, with Big Truck on it
I must've kidnapped the nigga man-huntin'
Cause I heard 'em hollain' hold on baby I'm comin'

[Chorus: Butch Cassidy]
Far away the stars, never thought we would get this far
But bitch I told, do what you're spoused to
Come give me brains, stop lookin' strange fix your jeans
It's just like I told you, walk like I'm spoused to

[Mystikal]
Man I'm the only mother-fuckin' black prince of the south
So ba-ba-balubop, bitch watch out
I make yo' momma sake a tell feather
Don't tell yo' daddy that I'm here, cause you know I make him feel great
Gone get yo' sex, you just turn me on
While he down there quotin bed, I know you not gone sing that song
I hit the chart enough to move off, my homie cool off, before you knows ??
I give it to him and this bitch can't handle
Or ugly jealous mother-fucker this shit jammin'
Ridiculous amounts of raw uncut talent
On top of 8th street kicks Indiana
No callin' me big bucks no wammies
This year I'm screamin' Jive Records Big Truck God Damn it
Heads up high enough so you can move
Rank CEO slash Rapper, slash fool

[Chorus]

[Mystikal]
I'm fixin' to blow up like the jar of Dizzy Gilespie
Ever the vesent ?? come get me
Grammy nominated, especially
The Soul Train award winner, call me black Elvis Presly
You probably ?? but you see me on
Either 106 & Park, Queen Latifah, Chris Rock, or Jenny Jones
Knock down buildin's, chop down trees
I kick so fuckin' hard they say, "You's Japanese!"
I'm up in the minute because of what I invent
Look at your over there with your seatbelt, like I'm ??
A.k.a the tarantula, hot rhymes comin' from a cannista'
They keepin' my fan for somethin' to brag on
These people in here ain't leavin' 'til I finish my fuckin' last song
Bitch walk like a balberin, tall dark and cut
Now keep your fuckin' hos down

[Chorus 2x w/Mystikal saying "Tarantula"]

[Butch Cassidy]
South and the West come together
However, we plan on doing this shit quite clever
My nigga Mystikal, it's ya boy Butch Cass'
And we put a foot off in they ass
