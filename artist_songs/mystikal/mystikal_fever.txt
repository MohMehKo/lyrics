It’s…the nigga that get hard than starch in yo fuckin creases  
rip it to pieces

Big tittie Tina boppas out chea catchin’ Mystikal Fever 
Ol’ you’ll be sayin’ you ain’t takin’ no shit this time 
Nigga me neither!

but when I get through wit cha’ all I be hearin’ is awwah!!

and they gon’ have to take yo ass home and leave you in a hot tub and soak
bar banga’ and if you don’t want swang

Time to flow wit a natural-born go getter

[Verse 3]
I’ll go pound for pound wit the knuckle cuffin’ muthafucka
Rush em’ and touch em’ 
Then stand ova’ his ass and screamin’ “I told you not to start nuthin”
I’ma damage ya 
You ain’t got the stamina 
Half the talent to match , to dance wit the Tarantula 
When I’ma chargin’ at cha 
niggas be tryin’ to copy cat  
wanna jump on the mic and do what I do but can’t keep up 
ain’t no thankin’ 
that shit gon’ change 
cause when I drop off mystikal sound a likes 
gon’ have to get the fuck off
crackin’ they glasses 
smashin’ they records 
smash and catchin’ they ass all day and tackle they ass 
tell em all settle shop down close fo’ sho 
put it down like 1990 M.C. Hammer 
I hope….
