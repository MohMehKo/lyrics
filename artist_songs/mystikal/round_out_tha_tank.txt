me that's who,
me me that's who,
me me that's who,
I'm the round out the tank,
I'm the round out the tank,
I'm the round out the tank,
I'm the loud blacca blacca, wacca wacca coming from behind you
Me that's who

[Chorus X 2]

I'm the "wee" before the "boom"
I'm the fire in the hole coming from the tube
I'm the claymore mine sittin in the dirt
I'm the probe of support,
I'm "doom doom doom" three round burst
sleeping bag in the friezing weather
I'm the fragmentation vessel for shrapnel and flying metal
I'm the auto on the fire select
I'm the thousand shells bouncing off the brass deflector
squeeze the trigger send the mass when it's time to take aim,
I'm the "waahhhaa" fool when they ricochet down range,
creeping and seeking and keep in my target
I'm the biological threat you don't wanna go to war wit
listen hear I make your fucking bread where you live at
I'm almost there click away from yo Bivouac
flash yo brains, highly illuminated
this is operation fuck all my destination

[Chorus X 2]

Ha, I'm all you rank and ribbons strips and brass and decorations
I'm that fucking hole in the earth after detonation
C 130 episode coming from the sky
recognize round two rolling just like hypmatize
I think in aromas so save ya breath
if I don't get you with the rifle I'm a catch you with my bayonet
I roll with M1's, tote em how I would
I'm a 45 day 45 night field prep
I'm yo' smart book in the live exercise begins
and when it get dark I'm noisy like discipline
twelve bravo run you out the foxhole
make it to the bunker it ain't no survival
I'm that war vet that's combat ready
whether arctic or jungle or the middle of the desert
they try to make it when they know they can't
how the fuck yo gonna run from the round out the tank

[Chorus X 4]
