I pray to God, that he makes me feel alright
Hope he gets me through this one more night
I pray to God, he's like one too many drinks
And my intuition starts to sink

[Refrain:]
It's like ba-da-da-da-da-da
Your shadows, they follow
And they're haunting me
Ba-da-da-da-da-da
Where'd you go?
This hollow soul is so lonely

[Pre-Chorus:]
I'm on my knees, begging pretty please
I'm so love drunk stupid off these memories
Mother Mary please, have mercy over me
The Sun came up and I can't believe you're over me

[Chorus:]
When I'm hung over you
When I'm hung over you

I swear to God, that I won't do this again
I've already wasted all my sins
I swear to God, I'm so sick of what you do
But I'll never get enough of you

[Refrain]

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

I swear to God [x8]

[Chorus]

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

I swear to God [x8]

When I'm hungover
