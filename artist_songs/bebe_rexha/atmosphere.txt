I feel in the beginning when we're living
We were tripping, we were so high
When you tell me that you love me were you bluffin'?
Was it nothing? now you're so dry
You can tell me that you're sorry
But I know that you don't mean it, baby, don't lie
Don't lie, baby, don't lie

And I can't blame myself for getting lost inside the promise of you
And I can't blame you leaving
'Cause what's meant to be will always be true

There isn't enough love in the atmosphere
To keep you here, ah
There isn't enough love in the atmosphere
Don't leave me here all alone
I ride for my baby
I died for my baby
I'd die for my baby. No lie
There isn't enough love in the atmosphere
In the atmosphere

Remember we were running up and down and getting messy in the hallways
Told me that forever was the time we'd be together, baby, always
Now you're saying that you're sorry but I know that you don't mean it 'cause you won't stay
No you won't stay, you won't stay

And I can't blame myself for getting lost inside the promise of you
And I can't blame you leaving
'Cause what's meant to be will always be true

There isn't enough love in the atmosphere
To keep you here, ah
There isn't enough love in the atmosphere
Don't leave me here all alone
I ride for my baby
I died for my baby
I'd die for my baby. No lie
There isn't enough love in the atmosphere
In the atmosphere

If there's winners and losers
Then I'll be the loser
I'm still here
I'll choose ya

I don't want another
If we can't have each other
'Cause, baby, I love ya

Maybe in a different world
Baby, I could be your girl
Maybe then I'd be with you

If there's winners and losers
Then I'll be the loser
I'm still here
I'll choose you

There isn't enough love in the atmosphere
To keep you here, ah
There isn't enough love in the atmosphere
Don't leave me here all alone
I ride for my baby
I died for my baby
I'd die for my baby. No lie
There isn't enough love in the atmosphere
In the atmosphere
