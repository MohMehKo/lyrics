When your heart is borrowed
Where the grass is green, but underneath you're cold and hollow
Yeah, the words are sweet but no see they're hard to swallow
So sick of your crooked smile and your counterfeit soul
Your counterfeit soul

And you got teeth like a wolf
But you cry like a sheep, yeah

Don't be mad, mad, you did it
Caught you red hands in it
You're so bad, yeah, I get it
You made your bed, now rest in it
Run and cry wolf!
Wolf!

When your heart has turned to stone
When the things you weren't meant to see are all that you know
Too late to sell back the lies and the dreams that you were sold
So sick of your crooked smile and your counterfeit soul
Your counterfeit soul

And you got teeth like a wolf
But you cry like a sheep, yeah

Don't be mad, mad, you did it
Caught you red hands in it
You're so bad, yeah, I get it
You made your bed, now rest in it
Run and cry wolf!
Wolf!

Heyyyyyyyyyyyy, oooooooooooh [x4]

And you got teeth like a wolf
But you cry
You cry

Don't be mad, mad, you did it
Caught you red hands in it
You're so bad, yeah, I get it
You made your bed, now rest in it
Run and cry wolf!
Wolf!

Cry wolf!
Wolf!

Mad, mad, you did it
Caught you red hands in it
You're so bad, yeah, I get it
Made your bed, now rest in it
