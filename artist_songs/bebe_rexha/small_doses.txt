You say "let me try you on"
So I let you try me on
That's the moment that we fell in deep
Oh baby, I said "just a little bit"
Then I got a taste of it
Now you got me falling at your feet

And now we're cryin' and lovin'
And now we're fightin' and touchin'
Feels like I'm making love to the enemy

I can only take you in small doses, small doses
Loving you, it's explosive, you know this
I can only take you in small doses, small doses
Loving you, it's explosive, you know this
I can only take you in small doses

I didn't mean to fall in love
Took one hit and I was gone
Gotta get my fix so I can sleep
Oh, baby, you're the one they warned about
Now I just can't do without
Baby, it's my appetite you feed

And now we're cryin' and lovin'
And now we're fightin' and touchin'
Feels like I'm making love to the enemy

I can only take you in small doses, small doses
Loving you, it's explosive, you know this
I can only take you in small doses, small doses
Loving you, it's explosive, you know this
I can only take you in small doses
Small doses, small doses
I can only take you in small doses
Small doses, small doses

And now we're cryin' and lovin'
And now we're fightin' and touchin'
Feels like I'm making love to the enemy

I can only take you in small doses, small doses
Loving you, it's explosive, you know this
I can only take you in small doses, small doses
Loving you, it's explosive, you know this
I can only take you in small doses
Small doses, small doses
I can only take you in small doses
Small doses, small doses
I can only take you in small doses
