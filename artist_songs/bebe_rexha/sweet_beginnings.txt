It's like bed bugs in a 5 star hotel
First date, pretty face but he's dumb as hell
He's dumb as hell
It's like choking on a LifeSaver
Like a firehouse burning to the ground
Burning to the ground

[Pre-Chorus:]
And I keep running, running circles, circles tryna understand
Why the dreams I die for are now killin' me
And I keep running, running circles, circles tryna figure out
Why this life is not what I thought it'd be

[Chorus:]
I wanna go back to the sweet beginnings
When I was young and full of innocence
I wanna go back to complete surrender of you
The sweet beginnings

It's like you're allergic to your medication
Meant to make you better, but it makes you worse
It makes you worse
It's like dying in your own living room
Like a U-Haul following behind a hearse
We all turn to dirt

[Pre-Chorus:]
And I keep running, running circles, tryna understand
Why this life is not what I thought it'd be

[Chorus]

The sweet beginnings
The sweet beginnings
Surrender of you
Surrender of you

[Chorus x2]

The sweet beginnings [x3]
