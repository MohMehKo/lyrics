I don't wanna grow up, no
I don't wanna grow up
I'm still naive
Young, wild and free
I don't wanna hear it, no
I don't wanna feel it
Don't lecture me
Just let me be

[Chorus:]
If love is a lie
It's the most beautiful lie that you've ever been told
Cause nothin', nothin' makes me feel like you do
Even though I see through you
If love is a lie
Then please don't ever tell me the truth
Cause nothin', nothin' makes me feel like you do
Even though I see through you

I don't wanna live it, no
I don't wanna live it
Reality
Just not for me
Like cheap tequila
Makes you sick but it tastes so good
Feels good on your lips, take a sip
Just one more hit
I love it when you do it, when you do it like this
When you do it, when you do it like this

[Chorus x2]
