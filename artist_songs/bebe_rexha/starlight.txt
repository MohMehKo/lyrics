All we need is love
More than ever, more than ever, darling
Just the two of us
'Cause when we're together, I start to believe in forever
All we need is love
More than ever, more than ever, darling
Just the two of us
'Cause when we're together, it's like we're the greatest treasure

Starlight, look at us shine
Could you be mine, could you be mine?
White lights, watching the skies
Could you be mine, could you be mine?
Don't go wasting your time
Don't go losing your mind
Starlight, look at us shine
Could you be mine, could you be mine?

Could you be mine?
Could you be mine?

Must we play pretend?
You're giving me something from pockets full of nothing
Give my heart a break, I'm only human
Don't wanna be left in ruins
My heart, I can't pretend
You're giving me something from pockets full of nothing
We're burning oh-so bright
When you're here with me, we fill the sun with envy

Starlight, look at us shine
Could you be mine, could you be mine?
White lights, watching the skies
Could you be mine, could you be mine?
Don't go wasting your time
Don't go losing your mind
Starlight, look at us shine
Could you be mine, could you be mine?

Could you be mine?
Could you be mine?
Could you be mine?

Don't hold, don't hold, don't hold it inside
You know, you know that you should be mine
Don't go, don't go living a lie
You know, you know that you should be mine

Starlight, look at us shine
Could you be mine, could you be mine?
White lights, watching the skies
Could you be mine, could you be mine?
Don't go wasting your time
Don't go losing your mind
Starlights, look at us shine
Could you be mine, could you be mine?

Could you be mine?
Could you be mine?
Could you be mine?

Don't hold, don't hold, don't hold it inside
You know, you know that you should be mine
Don't go, don't go living a lie
You know, you know that you should be mine

Starlights, look at us shine
Could you be mine, could you be mine?
