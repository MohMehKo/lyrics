You're sayin' that your tired of all your empty habits
You want something that's deeper 'cause you're over the generics
You're fuckin' with them basics when you really want the baddest
So come on, baby, get it, 'cause to miss it, it would be tragic

You say you want a bad bitch, baby, now you have it
Now you got a bad bitch, show me you can handle this
Say you want a bad bitch, baby, now you have it
Now you got the baddest, show me you can handle this

Bad bitch, bad bitch
Bad bitch, bad bitch

Bad bitch, bad bitch
Bad bitch, bad bitch
Show me you can handle this
(Ohhh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Ohhh, yeah, yeah, yeah)

You know I can handle it
You know I can handle it
When you throw that thing back
Get me like collateral
You be goin' all night
When you on that adderall
We be goin' all night
When you on that adderall
Bad bitch, bad bitch
You ain't never average
Kissin' double C's on your back with the basic
Bad bitch, bad bitch
You ain't never average
Center on the jeans with the center on back too

I pay my own bills and I pay my own rent
'Cause I'm indepe-, independent
I buy my own rings and I do my own things
'Cause I'm indepe-, independent
I know it really hurts, I know it ain't fair
You're not allowed to touch, but you can stare
Know it really hurts, know it ain't fair
So keep sayin' your prayers

You want a bad bitch, baby, now you have it
Now you got a bad bitch, show me you can handle this
Say you want a bad bitch, baby, now you have it

Bad bitch, bad bitch
Show me you can handle this
