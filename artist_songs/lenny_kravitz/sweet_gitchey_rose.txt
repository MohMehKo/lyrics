Ebony hair 
Emerald eyes 
All I could do was stare 

Fixed in a trance 
Her serpent smile 
Invited me to dance 

She took my hand and led me to her lair 
The smell of gumbo filled the humid air 
Right then and there 
I had my share 

Sweet Gitchey Rose 
Sweet Gitchey Rose 
Sweet Gitchey Rose 
Sweet Gitchey Rose 

I had a plan 
To steal her heart and be her only man 
I'd buy her things 
Find us a home where she could rest her wings 

But all an eagle wants to do is fly 
She doesn't stop or ask the question why 
One day she leaves 
With no goodbye 

Sweet Gitchey Rose 
Sweet Gitchey Rose 
Sweet Gitchey Rose 
Sweet Gitchey Rose 

I wonder, could she ever be my queen? 
Could loving only me be her own routine? 
You gotta let a brother dream, oh 

Sweet Gitchey Rose 
Sweet Gitchey Rose 
Sweet Gitchey Rose 
Sweet Gitchey Rose 

Ahhh-ahhhh, ahh-ahhh 
Ahhh-ahhhh, ahh-ahhh 

Sweet Gitchey Rose 
Sweet Gitchey Rose 
Sweet Gitchey Rose 
Sweet Gitchey Rose 

How could I fall for such a tease? 
Yeah 
Well, that's my own disease 
Oh yeah 

Sweet Gitchey Rose
