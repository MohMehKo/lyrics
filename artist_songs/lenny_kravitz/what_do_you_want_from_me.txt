What do you want from me?
You want my love? You want my blood?
What do you want from me?
I'm giving up
I've seen enough

Why don't you leave me alone?
Do your thing
Go find your own
You ain't ever gonna be me
Reach inside and take control
Stop that game
Start acting grown
I'm just saying
You need to set yourself free
What do you want from me?
You want my love? You want my blood?
What do you want from me?
I'm giving up
I've seen enough
What do you want from me?
You want my love? You want my blood?
What do you want from me?
You want my love
You want my love

You steal my beat so you can walk
Swallow my words that make you talk
A five cent cover is all that you gonna be
You want to have soul?
You've got to hone
Find your own flavor and find your tone
You'll feel a whole lot better once you deliver you'll see

What do you want from me?
You want my love? You want my blood?

You can't take the blood from a stone
So take your ass and shake it home
And if You want to get funky
Don't get funky with me

What do you want from me?
You want my taste?
You ought to try
What do you want from me?
You want my gig?
You must be high
What do you want from me?
You need to turn yourself around
What do you want from me?
Are you a king?
You want my crown

These sticks and stones
They break your bones
But you won't stop from breaking balls
I won't get low
Just don't go there with me
Drain my blood and drink it all
Take my love and break it off
But my soul is something you'll never take from me

What do you want from me?
You want my love?
You want my blood?
What do you want from me?
I'm giving up
I've seen enough
What do you want from me?
You want my love?
You want my blood?
What do you want from me?
I'm giving up
I've seen enough
What do you want from me?
