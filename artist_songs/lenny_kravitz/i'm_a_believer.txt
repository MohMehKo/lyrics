I got to let it, got to let it, got to let it go
I got to live by faith, relax, sit back, enjoy the show
The only element that's standing in the way is me
So now's the time to lay it at your feet
And let it be, let it be, let it be

Yeah

Hey, hey
I can feel it in my bones
I'm a believer
Hey, hey
From my head down to my toes
I'm a believer

No time to dilly-dally life is moving much too fast
Before we know it what we're doing now will be the past
And if we only knew how much time left we had left to live
We'd stop right in our tracks to turn around 
And start to give, start to give, start to give

Yeah

Hey, hey
I can feel it in my bones
I'm a believer
Hey, hey
From my head down to my toes
I'm a believer

Hey, hey
I can feel it in my bones
I'm a believer
Hey, hey
From my head down to my toes
I'm a believer

We got to live today
'Cause life is moving, baby
Let's take it to the top
No time for being lazy

This is our moment and it is right here before us
Come on and join me on a trip while we explore this

So come on baby
Baby, let's be on our way

Hey, hey
I can feel it in my bones
I'm a believer
Hey, hey
From my head right to my toes
I'm a believer

Hey, hey
I can feel it in my bones
I'm a believer
Hey, hey
From my head right to my toes
I'm a believer

Hey, hey
I can feel it in my bones
I'm a believer
Hey, hey
From my head right to my toes
I'm a believer

Hey, hey
I can feel it in my bones
I'm a believer
Hey, hey
From my head right to my toes
I'm a believer
