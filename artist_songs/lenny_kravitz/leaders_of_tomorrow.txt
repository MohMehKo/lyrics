You're teachers
You're power
You are the final hour
Your mission is heavy
It's going to break the levee

You're the leaders of tomorrow
You can change the course of history like no others
Have no fear
May God keep you strong
You're the leaders we've been waiting
For so very long
The future is waiting
For you to stop hating
Young people get ready
You have to stand so steady

You're the leaders of tomorrow
You can change the course of history like no others
Have no fear
May God keep you strong
You're the leaders we've been waiting for so
Very long
