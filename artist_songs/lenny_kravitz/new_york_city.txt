Broadway lights and taxi cabs
Everybody's moving fast
Uptown, downtown, what's your thing?
She can take what she can bring

She gave me a life
Came up through the inner city
She raised me up and taught me to fight, yeah
She opened my mind
I got to the knitty gritty
The greatest time that you'll ever find

She is my heart,
I love New York City
She's lived and died
So many times, yeah!
Life is always tough
On New York City, oh love
But she is fine, she always survives, yeah!

She's a queen that stands her ground
Nobody can take her down
Good times, bad times, she can swang
And did anyone a thang

She is a rock
As we pull but she is steady
And no one can take her freedom away, yeah
(Can't take her freedom)
I love her style
Whether she is clean or dirty
She's the greatest town that you'll ever find, yeah!

She is my heart,
I love New York City
She's lived and died
So many times, yeah!
Life is always tough
On New York City, oh love
But she is fine, she always survives, yeah!

You know she's my heart
I really love New York City
She's lived and died so many times
You know life can be real tough
On my New York City
But she's fine, she always survives
Yeah!
