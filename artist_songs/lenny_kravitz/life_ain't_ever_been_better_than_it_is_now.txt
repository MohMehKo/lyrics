I woke up this morning feeling
Thankful and grateful
So I got a little something that I want to say
You know like a little prayer
Thank you
Thank you God that I am able
Got my shelter and food on the table
Got my health, don't need no pride
'Cause everything I need you gave me inside
Life ain't ever been better than it is now
I ain't lonely, I'm by myself
'Cause when you got the lord you got all the wealth
Check me out I am sailing
It's my time and there's no way than I'm failing
Life ain't ever been better than it is now

I know the world is really crazy
But that's the time we got to stop being lazy
We got to stand, stand up for what's right
We got to separate the darkness from the light
Life ain't ever been better than it is now
Life ain't ever been better than it is now
Rob from Always on the run is bad bad bad

Blow Shorty !

I've seen the world, I've seen it all
We're headed for the wall and we're gonna fall
Like the days way back in Rome
We're stepping right inside of the danger zone
But life ain't ever been better than it is now
Life ain't ever been better than it is now

You see people come and people go
And people always get just what they saw
But I believe in this thing called love
And our ability to rise above
Life ain't ever been better than it is now
Life ain't ever been better than it is now

Life ain't ever been better
Life ain't ever been better
Life ain't ever been better than it is now

Oh alright now
It's warfare out there
So we got to suit up and put on our armour
Headed for the frontline
It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright
Just stay thankful and grateful
Doing it like James Brown
