Martin Luther King, he had a vision
And that's a fact
He died so we could see that was his mission
So don't look back

There is no division, don't you understand
The future looks as though it has come around
And maybe we have finally found our common ground
We're the children of one father
If you're looking back don't bother
We're black and white America
Rob from Always on the run is bad bad bad

In nineteen sixty three my father married
A black woman
And when they walked the street they were in danger
Look what you've done

But they just kept on walking forward hand in hand
The future looks as though it has come around
And maybe we have finally found our common ground
We're the children of one father
If you're looking back don't bother
We're black and white America

The future looks as though it has come around
And maybe we have finally found our common ground
We're the children of one father
If you're looking back don't bother
We're black and white America

We've waited so long
We've waited so long

There is no division, don't you understand
The future looks as though it has come around
And maybe we have finally found our common ground
We're the children of one father
If you're looking back don't bother
We're black and white America

The future looks as though it has come around
And maybe we have finally found our common ground
We're the children of one father
If you're looking back don't bother
We're black and white America

The future looks as though it has come around
And maybe we have finally found our common ground
We're the children of one father
If you're looking back don't bother
We're black and white America

Oh, yeah
Black and white America
Gonna keep moving forward, oh
Blow Harold !
