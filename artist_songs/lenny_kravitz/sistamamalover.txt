I've gone from talkin' to walkin'
You touch me deep down inside
Oh can't you see that I'm fallin'
And I can no longer hide

You are my everything
My sistamamalover
You give me everything
I have no need to borrow

And when I think of you
You take away my sorrow
I'll always love you baby
Like there's no tomorrow

When I get up in the morning (When I get up in the morning)
I feel like I'm so alive (Feel so alive)
With you it never gets boring (Hmm hmm that's right)
'Cause you always get me high (Get me high)
High

You are my everything
My sistamamalover
You give me everything
I have no need to borrow

And when I think of you
You take away my sorrow
I'll always love you baby
Like there's no tomorrow

I'll never go with another
'Cause baby you are so fly (You know you're fly)
Don't have to live undercover (That's right)
Because I don't have to lie (I don't have to lie baby)

You are my everything
My sistamamalover
You give me everything
I have no need to borrow

And when I think of you
You take away my sorrow
I'll always love you baby
Like there's no tomorrow

You are my everything (My everything!)
My sistamamalover (Sistermama...lover!)
You give me everything
I have no need to borrow

And when I think of you (And when I think of you)
You take away my sorrow

Like there's no tomorrow (Like there's no tomorrow)

You are my everything
My sistamamalover
(Sistermama...lover!)
You give me everything
I have no need to borrow (Waouh !)
And when I think of you
You take away my sorrow (You take away my sorrow)
