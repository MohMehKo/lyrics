A lie he broke in pieces
He better have a life
My heart is slowly beating
Don’t leave me here to die

Cause I need love
Yeah, I need love
You say that I’m your baby
But I feel like Frankenstein
I need love

I try so hard to please you
You’re never satisfied
Will you ever release me?
I’m tossin’ girls to swine

But I need love
Sister, I need love
You say that I’m your baby
But I feel like Frankenstein
I need love

The lie that you are living
Will never let you shine
Your words are so deceiving
But can’t they taste like wine?

Can’t help yourself from breathing
Can’ help yourself from lying
One more day of this fucking and I ‘ll lose my mind

I need love
Baby, I need love
You said I was your savior
But I feel like Frankenstein

The lie that you are living
Will never let you shine
Your words are so deceiving
But can’t they taste like wine?

I need love
Yeah, I need love
Sister, yeah, I need love
I need love
I need love
Baby, I need love
I need love
I need love
