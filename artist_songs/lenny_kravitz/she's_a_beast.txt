My heart is beatin’
And I can’t wait for tomorrow
I’m gonna see her
My beautiful wild flower

She takes away space and time
She moves and eases my mind
Together we’re one design
Yeah, she’s a beast

I must be dreamin’
Don’t have to beg, steal or borrow
And all I needed, yeah
I get every day and hour

She makes me feel so alive
She’s always full of desire
When we make love it’s on fire
Yeah, she’s a beast
Oh, she’s a beast
Yeah, she’s a beast
Yes, you are, honey
Yeah, yeah, yeah-ah
Wooh

When she is sleepin’
I stare at her face in wonder
Yeah, how God released her
Now she is mine to discover

She wears her soul in her eyes
She is so pure and so wise
I’ll always be by her side
Yeah, she’s a beast
Yes, you are, sugar
Yeah, yeah, yeah-ah
Wooh
