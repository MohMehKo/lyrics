[DJ Military Intro]

[Lenny:]
Roll sister, roll on it
Don't let the music stop
Girl go on make that Boongie drop
Roll sister, roll on it

Roll sister, roll on it
Don't let the music stop
Girl go on make that Boongie drop
Roll sister, roll on it

Red light, speaker's pumping
Flesh to flesh, grinding bumping
Hot pants, green and yellow
Brown thighs, feeling mellow
The beat of the ghetto
Cornrows, weaves and afros
The divas from Nassau
Are out to show tonight

Roll sister, roll on it
Don't let the music stop
Girl go on make that Boongie drop
Roll sister, roll on it

Roll sister, roll on it
Don't let the music stop
Girl go on make that Boongie drop
Roll sister, roll on it

[DJ Military:]
Girl make that Boongie drop
Girl make that Boongie drop
Girl make that Boongie drop
Girl make that Boongie drop

[Lenny:]
Black heat fills the dance hall
Lovers rock the back wall
Junglers, bootleg labels
High heels on the tables
Bare feet on the dirt floor
No one cares if you're poor
At three locking the door
Ain't coming home tonight

Roll sister, roll on it
Don't let the music stop
Girl go on make that Boongie drop
Roll sister, roll on it

Roll sister, roll on it
Don't let the music stop
Girl go on make that Boongie drop
Roll sister, roll on it

[DJ Military:]
Girl make that Boongie drop
Girl make that Boongie drop
Girl make that Boongie drop

[Jay-Z:]
Pop, lock and drop it
I make that pussy speak Patois
Like Petra, remember huh
Remember me from the basement parties
I remember you thai type no panty
Might we blowing on nigga type E
Brother rubbing so close stepping on my Nikes
At the red light, never give me red light
Only give me green light, you know what I mean right
After my Red Stripe, jump up on my motorbike
Show me what that motorbike
Show me you can roll it right
All of my diamonds, girl, they're Bohemians
All of my Jamaicans, shake it for me, shake it then
