When I was just a boy
Granddaddy sat me on his knee
He told me that he loved me and that we were family, 
We spoke about the world and all the possibilities
Then he held me in his arms
He said: "Be what you want to be"

He paved a way for me to follow
Uncharted terrain now had a lane
It's how I got over

When I became a man
Granddaddy said: "Come walk with me"
He said: "Being a man comes with responsibility
And always keep your word to the best of your ability"
When he looked me in my eyes
He said: "It's time to set you free"

He paved a way for me to follow
Uncharted terrain now had a lane
It's how I got over

He paved a way for me to follow
Uncharted terrain now had a lane
It's how I got over

He paved a way for me to follow
Uncharted terrain now had a name
It's how I got over
