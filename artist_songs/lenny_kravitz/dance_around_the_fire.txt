Woah
Ain't life grand
You're always dreaming about the things you don't have
And oh
You think it's a drag
You're taking life for granted you won't live it
'Till you understand
That you ain't ready to rock until you're ready to roll

Put your gun down
And dance around the fire
Under the moonlight
The flames are getting higher
Put your gun down
And dance around the fire
Under the moonlight
The flames are getting higher
I said oh
Ain't life a bitch?
The tricks are turning
I know you're trying to get rich
That it was a sham
When you trade money for love it is gonna get old

Put your gun down
And dance around the fire
Under the moonlight
The flames are getting higher

Put your gun down
And dance around the fire
Under the moonlight
The devil is a liar

I said oh
Dance around the fire
Under the moonlight
The flames are getting higher

Put your gun down
And dance around the fire
Under the moonlight
The flames are getting higher
I should be preaching to the choir
The flames are getting higher
Put your gun down
And dance around the fire
Under the moonlight
The flames are getting higher
Put your gun down
And dance around the fire
