The way she moves
Really talks to me
I'm going out of my mind
`Cause the way that she winds
Is truly divine

She takes her time
As she approaches me
Then she gives me the sign
As she moves her behind
That only God would design

Like a bullet from a gun
The DJ makes a run
When she feels a beat my baby
I can't get her off the floor
She keeps me dancin' til dawn

The lights are low
She likes to dance for me
It's making me high
'Cause the look in her eye
Is hot as July
Hey

The night is young
Gold bar's the place to be
The music is right
'Cause the dj is tight
Zappa into Barry White, yeah!

Like a bullet from a gun
The DJ makes a run
When she feels a beat my baby
I can't get her off the floor
She keeps me dancin' til dawn

Like a bullet from a gun
The DJ makes a run
When she feels a beat my baby
I can't get her off the floor
She keeps me dancin' til dawn

Like a bullet from a gun
The DJ makes a run
When she feels a beat my baby
I can't get her off the floor
She keeps me dancin' til dawn

Like a bullet from a gun
The DJ makes a run
When she feels a beat my baby
I can't get her off the floor
She keeps me dancin' til dawn

Like a bullet from a gun
The DJ makes a run
When she feels a beat my baby
I can't get her off the floor
She keeps me dancin' til dawn
She keeps me dancing

Like a bullet from a gun
The DJ makes a run
When she feels a beat my baby
I can't get her off the floor
She keeps me dancin' til dawn
