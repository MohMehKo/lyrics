I know that you are mine
Com’on
Come on get it
And I won’t waste your time
Com’on
Come on and get it
I feel like a K9
Com’on
Come on and get it
Can I eat from your vine?
Com’on
Come on and get it

I’m in love with your love
And I’m comin’ to get it
You know I can't turn it down
I've gotta jump in it
You know I can’t feel the doubt
‘Cause I’m high on my spirit
You know I’ll fight for your love
And you know that I need it
Yeah yeah
Come on get it

I’m in love with your love
And I’m comin’ to get it
You know I can't turn it down
I've gotta jump in it
You know I can’t feel the doubt
‘Cause I’m high on my spirit
You know I’ll fight for your love
And you know that I need it
Yeah yeah

Come on get it [repeats]
