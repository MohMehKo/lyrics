I did you wrong
My heart went out to play
But in the game, I lost you
What a price to pay

I'm crying
Ooh
Baby, baby
Ooh
Baby, baby

Mistakes
I know I've made a few
But I'm only human
You've made mistakes too

Yeah, I'm crying
Ooh
Baby, baby
Ooh
Baby, baby

I'm just about at
The end of my rope
But I can't stop trying
I can't give up hope

'Cause I feel one day
That I'll hold you near
Whisper "I still love you"
Until that day is here

Oh, I'm crying
Ooh
Baby, baby
Ooh
Baby, baby

Ooh
Baby, baby
Ooh
Baby, baby

Baby, baby
Ooh
Baby, baby
Ooh
My baby, baby

I wanna be by your side, yeah
I'll never leave you
Never leave you, girl

Ooh
Baby, baby
Ooh
Baby, baby, girl

Ooh
Baby, baby
Ooh
Baby, baby
