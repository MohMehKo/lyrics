Do you think we can start over?
Do we have the eyes to see?
Is there any more devotion
Left inside our will to be?
Or do you think that it's over?
Inevitable prophecy
Do you see any other way
That we can recover?
If so you can work with me

I say war no more
I'm not gonna fight this war no more
I say war uh uh
I'm not gonna fight this war no more

You and I shoulder to shoulder
That's the way we used to be
How the night keep getting colder
What's become of you and me?
Has our world come crashing towards
An enormous thunderous sea?
Or will we discover that
Out future's in each other?
And avoid this travesty

I say war no more
I'm not gonna fight this war no more
I say war uh uh
I'm not gonna fight this war no more
