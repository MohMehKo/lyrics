I pledge allegiance, baby
To the flag of love
I'm trying to do the things
To keep us moving up

Don't ever wanna mislead you
I've got to have your trust
'Cause it ain't about me, baby
It is about us

Well, I'm gonna love you
Be your solid ground
Keep you homeward bound

I never want to let you down
I never want to let you down
I never want to let you down
Why don't you give me a chance today?

Sometimes, I get to thinking
That I am not enough
My past comes back to haunt me
I know you know it's tough

But I'm trying to be a better man
I've got to hang in tough
'Cause it ain't about me, baby
It is about us

I'm gonna love you
Be the solid ground
That keeps you homeward bound

I never want to let you down
I never want to let you down
I never want to let you down
Why don't you give me a chance today?

I'm gonna love you
Be the solid ground
That keeps you homeward bound

I never want to let you down
I never want to let you down
I never want to let you down
I never want to let you down

I never want to let you down
I never want to let you down
I never want to let you down
I never want to let you down

I never want to let you down
I never want to let you down
I never want to let you down
I never want to let you down
