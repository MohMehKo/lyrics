( More of guitar, need more track 
Bass, more guitar ) 

Thinking positivity 
If you wanna be with me 
I'll take you to the promised land 
Come on baby take my hand 

Stop draggin' around, stop draggin' around 
Stop draggin' around, stop draggin' around 
Yeah yeah yeah ! ahah hou .. 

Higher and higher and higher we get 
I'll freak you like a sex-o-lette 
You say you wanna be my wife ? 
I'll take you to another life, come on 

Stop draggin' around, stop draggin' around 
Stop draggin' around, stop draggin' around 

Come on baby take my hand 
I'll take you to the promised land 
Yeah ! 

Stop draggin' around, stop draggin' around 
Stop draggin' around, stop draggin' around 
Stop draggin' around, come on baby 
Stop draggin' around, you know I love you, 
Stop draggin' around, stop draggin' around 
Stop draggin' around
