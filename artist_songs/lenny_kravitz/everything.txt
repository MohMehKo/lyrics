The origin of love, the very essence
The lifeline to my eternal destination
The sweetness in my soul
In this valley dark and cold
Well you blessed this child
I've got my own to make it

You
You give me everything
You give me everything
Everything that I could ever need
You give me everything
You give me everything
Everything that I could ever need

Sometimes I'm tired and naked
And I don't think that I got enough to take it
That's when I grab a hold
On to that rock of olde
I say you're always there to fix my situation

You
You give me everything
You give me everything
Everything that I could ever need
You give me everything
You give me everything
Everything that I could ever need

You give me everything
You give me everything
Everything that I could ever need
You give me everything
You give me everything
Everything that I could ever need
