It's been a while since you came around
I missed you so. You know you broke me down
I was ready to give it one more try
Play on

While you were gone I tried to mend my heart
But I didn't know even where to start
I rather be with you given the fact

I'll take all you offer, cause it's all the same
The stone and the flower
The pleasure and the pain
I'll climb up that mountain, because it's you again
I can't live without it
The pleasure and the pain

I love the way that you keep it real
You're not afraid to tell me the deal
You tell me when I'm wrong, when I'm tripping out
'Cause a man like me, needs a woman who
Who walk the wall and is a warrior too, but
With that comes the truth and there is no doubt

I'll take all you offer, because it's all the same
The stone and the flower
The pleasure and the pain
I'll climb up that mountain, because it's you again
I can't live without it
The pleasure and the pain

I think this time we can make it trough
I'm still the me and you're still the you
The only difference will be within our minds

I'll take all you offer, because it's all the same
The stone with the flower
The pleasure and the pain
I'll climb up all the mountains, because it's you again
I can't live without it
The pleasure and the pain

I'll take all you offer, because it's all the same
The stone and the flower
The pleasure and the pain
I'll climb up that mountain, because it's you again
I can't live without it
The pleasure and the pain

I'll take all you offer, because it's all the same
The stone with the flower
The pleasure and the pain
I'll climb up all the mountains, because it's you again
I can't live without it
The pleasure and the pain
