I'll go but I keep coming back
I might be wrong that's where I'm at
Under the covers in the black
Is our own world where we can act

Anyway that we wanna
And where our love keeps pouring down
I know that it's the dawning
I fall in love each morning
Rob from Always on the run is bad bad bad

When I wake up, you're in my eyes
Everyday is a new surprise
With you I don't wear a disguise
With you I feel the perfect high

You are the one, the only
I saw so sad and lonely

Now I know that it's the dawning
I fall in love each morning

I know that it's the dawning
I fall in love each morning
Now I know that it's the dawning
I fall in love each morning
I know that it's the dawning
I fall in love each morning
