Let's work together
We are one big family
Joined forever like the branches of a tree
In this world we are neighbors
There is no immunity
Hurt a member, you hurt the whole community

We can turn around
Peace can still be found
It starts in your mind
Have the faith of a child

We're facing problems at a catastrophic rate
Folks are desperate
So many wars are on our plate
We're using religion
And with it we're pushing hate
Wonder if there'll be time to change our fate

We can turn around
Peace can still be found
It starts in your mind
Have the faith of a child

I know we can make it
I know
I know we can make it
Why can't we work it on out

I know we can make it
I know
I know we can make it

You know
Anything the mind can conceive
We can achieve
So why don't we put our minds together
And meditate on peace
With the faith of a child

We can turn around
Peace can still be found
It starts in your mind
Have the faith of a child
Have the faith of a child
Have the faith of a child
