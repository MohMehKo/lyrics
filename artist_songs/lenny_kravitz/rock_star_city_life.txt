Yeah
Walks like a man
You think she's older
She understands
She ain't no joker
She's got the glam
A rock n' roller

She's got the plan
Moves like a soldier
Don't give a damn
She's gettin' over
She knows she can
Like Casanova

She knows that she's got the look
And she's gonna play
She knows that she's got the hook
And you're gonna pay

She got attitude
Rock star city life
She got attitude
Rock star city life

She's underage
A real Lolita
She loves the stage
La senorita
Inside a cage
You'll find a cheetah

She's all the rage
A double feature
She got that thing
Take the bible from the preacher
You'll need a sage
To find that creature

She knows that she's got the look
And she's gonna play
She knows that she's got the hook
And you're gonna pay

She got attitude
Rock star city life
She got attitude
Rock star city life

She got an attitude
Rock star city life
She got attitude
Rock star city life

She knows that she's got the look
And she's gonna play
She knows that she's got the hook
And you're gonna pay

She got attitude
Rock star city life
She got attitude
Rock star city life

She got an attitude
Rock star city life
She got an attitude
Rock star city life
