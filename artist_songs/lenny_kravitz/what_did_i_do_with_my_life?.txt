Did I work on the battlefield?
Did I do what I thought was right?
Did I do all that I could do?
Did I put up a good fight?

Did I love all that I should?
To everyone in my sight?
What did I do with my life?

Did I exercise giving
And forgiveness with all my might?
Did I honor my freedom
And did I live in the light?

Did I cherish my moments?
Did I take a good enough bite?
What did I do with my life?

You can live any way you wanna
All you have to do is dance
Achieve anything you thought of
You just have to take the chance
You can fall in love with your life
'Cause that truly is romance
What did I do with my life?

Did I learn what I came to learn?
Did I listen with my heart?
Did I do what I came to do?
And how did I play the part?
Did I see all the beauty?
Because living is an art
What did I do with my life?

You can live any way you wanna
All you have to do is dance
Achieve anything you thought of
You just have to take the chance
Learn to love your life
'Cause that truly is romance
Oh what did I do with my life?

What did I do?
Say it again
What did I do
With my life?
Oh
What did I do?

What did I do?
With my life
What did I do?
What did I do?
