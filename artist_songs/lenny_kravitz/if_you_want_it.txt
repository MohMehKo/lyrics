Don't you let it all pass you by
Looking through life's window pane
Don't you sit around wasting time
That would be a crying shame

There's a power that's deep inside
And it burns just like a flame
Just believe and you'll see that God
Will shower you like pouring rain

If you want it
You can change your world today
If you want it
Just break free and walk away

There's a reason for you to explore
Why you're here, what do you say
And the beauty is that you're the one
Who controls just how you play

There's a choice that you need to make
One is ore and one is clay
So drop your chains and take up your cross
And let Jesus make your way
Oh, oh, oh

If you want it
You can change your world today
If you want it
Just break free and walk away

If you want it, want it
You can change your evil ways
If you want it, want it
Just break free and walk away

If you want it, want it
You can change your world today
If you want it, want it
Just break free and walk away

If you want it, want it
You can change your evil ways
If you want it, want it
Just break free and walk away
