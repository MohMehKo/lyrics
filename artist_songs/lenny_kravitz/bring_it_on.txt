I'm gonna walk by faith
Gonna raise my sword
I'm gonna fight my battle
I'm gonna praise my Lord

It's getting heavy
But I'm ready
To take on this world and rock steady
So come on, bring it on

I'm gonna face my demons
Gonna tear them down
I'm gonna keep on moving
Gonna make my sound

It's getting heavy
But I'm ready
To take on this world and rock steady
So come on, bring it on

Bring it on
Oh bring it on
Bring it on
Oh bring it on

Bring it on
Oh bring it on
Bring it on
Oh bring it on...
