Oh yeah yeah!
Because

[Chorus:]
Because of the love that you've given to me.
Baby once I was blind, but now I see
I was lost, but I'm found and my spirit is free
All because of your love.

[Verse 1:]
I was a stranger in a strange and lonely world looking for a lover to be my lady and my friend. You gave me direction and you were there through thick and thin. Because of your love baby I'm back on my feet again, again. I never knew that you would be (that you would be) the one to fall in love with me (in love with me), but now I know that I am blessed. You showed me love and tenderness because of your love baby.

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 1:]
I was a warrior at war with the world around me. Then I realized that love's the reason that we live. And you were the savior that made me see that I can win when somebody loves you, you have so much more to give. I never knew that you would be (that you would be) the one to fall in love with me (in love with me), but now I know that I am blessed. You showed me love and tenderness because of your love baby.

[Chorus: repeat until fades]
