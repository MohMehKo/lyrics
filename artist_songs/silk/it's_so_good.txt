And I want you for the rest of my life...

[Verse 1:]
Remembering the first day... You brought smiles to my face (ohh...)
With Memeries I can't erase... It's just so nice to know that you were
Made for me...

[Chorus:]
It's so Good to have you around...
Someone who... will never let me down
Good to have you around
And I want you for the rest of my life

[Verse 2:]
You have never let me down... (ohh...) After four years I'm so proud
Almost gave... Love away... But I must admit out of all you are the Best...

[Chorus]

Change is overtime how one day you may not be mine...
But I'll charish every Moment you spend with me...
I need you everyday (I need you Everyday)
So don't you ever go away
Your all I need, For me...

[Chorus: to End]
