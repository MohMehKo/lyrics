When we first met I never cheated, girl, I never lied
Temptation, well I guess, was never really on my side
Now you are leaving and I wanna stop you so bad
Then I can gonna stake us
Girl we can't go on this way

You know I'd rather be with you, baby, baby
You know I'd rather have you stay
We can't make up and patch it up this time
So let me leave this on your mind

Baby, don't cry for me
Even if I beg and plead
Don't take me, and stay with me

Baby don't cry for me
Even if I promise one more time
Baby don't you believe me
'Cause I know I'll never love you again, then

Now we are said and done
And I've been feeling so alone, yeah
Oh girl, I want you back
But I know you can't come
Back home, back home

Baby I know there'll never be another
Who can love me like you do, baby
But I can't love you back
And that's why I'm telling you, baby, baby

You know I'd rather be with you
You know I'd rather have you stay
We can't make up and patch it up this time
So let me leave this on your mind

Baby, don't cry for me
Even if I beg and plead
Don't take me and stay with me

Baby, don't cry for me
I don't wanna see your tears no more, baby
Even if I promise one more time
Don't you believe me
'Cause I know I'll never love you again

I can't love, oh no baby, it's over
I don't know sometimes I want you to stay
And sometimes I want you to go, baby
So you might as well go, bye bye, baby
Ain't nothing you can say or do
To make me wanna stay with you, you baby

Baby, don't cry for me
Even if I beg and plead
Don't take me and stay with me

Baby, don't cry for me
Even if I promise one more time
Don't you believe me

Baby, don't cry for me
Even if I beg and plead
Don't take me and stay with me

Ain't nothing you can say or do
To make me want to stay with you
My darling, my darling, bye bye, bye bye
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye, baby

Ain't nothing you can do about it
So don't you cry for me
Ain't nothing you can do about it

Ain't nothing you can do about it
So don't you cry for me
Ain't nothing you can do about it
Ain't nothing you can do about it
