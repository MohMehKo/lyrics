[Verse 1:]
Could we get a room, on the Southside of the ghetto
Could we make sweet love one in the forest or the meadow
Can we get it on get it onnnn when the sun gives light
Could we just kiss each other like it was our very very very first time

[Chorus:]

[Verse 2:]
Can we hold hands? and walk across the sandy beaches
Can weeee just stop and stare...
Just looking at eachother looking at eachother speechless
Can we embrace eachother while the moon gives light
Can we make a pact to stay together forever forever togetherrr OHH

[Chorus]
