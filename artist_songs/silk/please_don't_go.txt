Baby promise that you'll never leave me
Promise that we'll always be 
Together forever
Please don't go

[CHORUS:]
Baby promise that you'll never leave me
Baby promise that we'll always be
Don't go (don't go) [repeat]

[Verse 1:]
I'm leavin you this message
I'm sorry that I couldn't be home 
One night while I was out on the road
I didn't spend the night alone no
I let my weakness get the best of me 
She was just a one night stand
I know I was wrong 
Just don't leave me alone
Without you in my life
I'm only half a man

I got yo message
And  I can't believe the things you said
Now that the shoe is on the other foot
It's messin with my head ooh

[CHORUS]

[Verse 2:]
I'm writing you this letter 
Cuz I couldn't tell you face to face
 I let temptations git the best of me
I know it was a big mistake
Now I don't ever wanna lose your love
Cuz my heart couldn't take the pain
I know I was I wrong 
Just don't leave me alone
Cuz lovin in my life 
Will never be the same

I got yo letter 
And I can't believe the things I read no
Now thats the shoe is on the other foot
It's messin with my head ooh

[CHORUS]

[CHORUS :together]
Baby promise that you'll never leave me
You gotta promise me
Baby promise that we'll always be
Together forever

Do you forgive me

You done messed up so many times
