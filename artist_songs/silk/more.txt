[Verse 1:]
Could we get a room, on the south side of the ghetto,
could we make sweet love, we're in the forest or the meadow,
can we get it on (get it on), when the sun gives light, 
can we just kiss each other, like it was our very, very very first time 

[Chorus:]
Baby please give me some more, more, more (more)
please just a little bit more, more, more (more)
more, I like the way you touch me, give me some more
more, baby Im feaning and I like, got to have some more
more, I like the way you touch me, give me some more
more, baby I'm feaning and I need somemore (more, more, more)
Baby Im feaning and I need some more (More, More, More) just a little bit more

[Verse 2:]
Can we hold hands, and walk across the sandy beaches, 
Can we,  stop and stare, 
(Just looking at each other,looking at each other) Sweetness,
Can we embrace each other, while the moon gives light,
Can we, make a pact to stay together forever forever together 

[Chorus]

Could we
Could we
could we, More
can we get a room, on the south side of the ghetto (Give me some more)
Could we, More 
Baby Im feaning and I like it, got to have some more
could we, More (More, yoodle lae Hee) give me some more
More, Baby Im feaning and I like it got to have some more
More, (more Yoodle lae Hee) Give me some more
More, Baby Im feaning and I need some more (more, more, more)
Baby Im feaning and I need some more (more, more, more)
could we,yes could we
give me some more, give me some more
