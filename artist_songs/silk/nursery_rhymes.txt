[Intro]
Oh, oh, ooohhh
La la la la la lullaby, baby
Oh oh oh
This is Silk's nursery rhyme, baby
La la la la la lullaby
Well, well, oh

This one's dedicated to my first love
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Don't you know you drive me crazy
With your sexy body lady, lady
Would you like for me to creep over to your crib
Just say when, say when
I would like to be the one who loves you down
And seranade your sexy body with this nursery rhyme

[1]
Hush little baby don't say a word
Silk is gonna buy you a mocking bird
And if that mocking bird don't sing
Silk is gonna buy you a diamond ring
And if that diamond ring don't shine
I guess I'm gonna have to give you something else of mine

Would you like that, would you like that
You can have this, if you want this
I'm gonna give you lovin'
Lovin' is what your body needs

Oh, if you let me come over, pretty thing
You can play the name game
Don't you know that [?]
That's what you'll be saying
And you know that I'll be staying
So conjunction, junction was your function
Do you want me (girl)
Do you need me (girl)
Oh, baby girl, I'm on my way
And when I get there, this is what I'm gonna say

[Repeat 1]

I love you, you love me
Can we go and play a game of hide and seek
So baby close your eyes, count to five
If you find me, you better treat
I want you, you want me 
Baby can we, you and me
Fufill our fantasy
Cuz without a doubt, you're the one
The only one to make me go
Five, four, three, two, one
Ready or not, baby here I come

Hush little baby, don't say a word
Silk is gonna buy you a mocking bird
If that mocking bird don't sing
Silk is gonna buy you a diamond ring
And if that diamond ring don't shine, it don't shine
I guess I'm gonna have to give you something else of mine
oh oh, baby
Would you like that, would you like that
You can have this if you want this
I'm gonna give you lovin'
Lovin' is what your body needs

Would you like that, would you like that
You can have this if you want this
I'm gonna give you lovin'
Lovin' is what your body needs

Would you like that, would you like that
You can have this if you want this
I'm gonna give you lovin'
Lovin' is what your body needs

Yeah
Hope you enjoyed Silk's nursery rhyme
