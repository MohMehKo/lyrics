Baby, don't stop
Baby, don't stop

Don't go tonight baby
I wanna get freaky, freaky

Let me lick you up and down
Up and down, up and down
Let me make you soakin' wet, baby

I won't be around with you litle baby
'Cause tonight baby
I wanna get freaky with you

Baby, don't stop
Baby, don't stop
Baby, don't stop
Baby, don't stop
