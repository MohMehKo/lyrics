Life ain't the same
So much pain inside
Knowing you are out of my life
Out of my life

Life ain't just the same living without you
No one else to blame now that I lost you
Nothing stays the same, everything must change
Now that I've lost you

It was my own decision to be a fool
And think that without you girl I'd still be cool
But I'm so afraid
I don't wanna live this way

Baby, if I told you how much I adore you
Would it mean things better? Would you say whatever?
But if I showed you that I'd like to give it one more try
Would I be making a fool of myself

Life ain't just the same living without you
No one else to blame now that I lost you
Nothing stays the same, everything must change
Now that I've lost you

Never did I wonder with you by my side
Now there's so much pain locked inside
Without you I'm so lonely, I wish you were here to show me
The way to a better day

Baby, if I told you how much I adore you
Would it mean things better, would you say whatever
But if I showed you that I'd like to give it one more try
Would I be making a fool of myself?

Life ain't just the same living without you
No one else to blame now that I lost you
Nothing stays the same, everything must change
Now that I've lost you

There is no way we can go back
To ever being the same, no way
There is no way we can go back
To ever being the same, no way

Life ain't just the same living without you
No one else to blame now that I lost you
Nothing stays the same, everything must change
Now that I've lost you

Life ain't just the same living without you
No one else to blame now that I lost you
Nothing stays the same, everything must change
Now that I've lost you, life ain't just the same

Now that I've lost you, life ain't just the same
