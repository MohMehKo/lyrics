Ooh, ooh, ooh
Could we get a room
On the south side of the ghetto?
Could we make sweet love
In the forest or the meadow?

Can we get it to get it on
Til the sun gives light
Could we just kiss each other like
It was our very, very, very first time

Baby, please gimme some more, oor, oor, oor
Please just a little bit more oor oor
(More)
Ooh, whoa, ooh, more, yeah

I like the way you touch me
Gimme some more
More, oor, baby, I feigning and
I like it gotta have some more

More oor, I like the way you touch me
Gimme some more
More, orr, baby, I'm feigning and
I need some more, oor, oor, oor

Baby I'm feigning and
I need some more, oor, oor
Just a little bit more

Could we hold hands
And walk across the sandy beaches?
Could we stop and stare?
Just looking at each other
Looking at each other, speechless

Could we embrace each other
By the moonlit night?
Could we make a pact
To stay together forever, forever together?

Ooh please
(Please)
Gimme some more, oor, oor
(Can you gimme some more?)
Please just a little bit more, oor, oor
Ooh, whoa, ooh, more, yeah

I like the way you touch me
Gimme some more, ooh, whoa, ooh, more
Baby, I'm feigning and
I like it gotta have some more oor
Ooh, whoa, ooh, more
(More)

Ooh, whoa, ooh, more, oor, oor, oor
Baby, I'm feigning and I need some more
Some more, some more, some more

Baby I'm feigning

And I need some more, oor, oor, oor
Just a little bit more
Could we?
