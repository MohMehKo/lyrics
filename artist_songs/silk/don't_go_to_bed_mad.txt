I was wrong I admitted
You don't have to put up with this no-no-no baby
Can we talk to make it right
Cause I don't want you crying when we lay down tonight
So let me see that smile the one I like so much
Come on baby let's we don't have rush
Baby don't be mad I'm sorry
Can't you see I apologize the blame is on me

[Chorus:]
Don't go to bed mad baby
Let the pass be the pass sugar
Don't go to bed mad baby
Let the pass be the pass sugar

Ooooo come here and give me a kiss
Ain't no reason for us to be fighting like oooo
Girl I love you and I know you love me
It's look better when you smile so won't you go that for me
So let me see that smile the one I like so much
Come on baby let's
We don't have to rush baby
Don't mad I'm sorry
Can't you see I apologize
The blame is on me.

[Chorus x2]
