La la la la la de da la la [x4]
If vine what your name should be
With your beauty you can part the red sea
You're as precious as some real red silk
And baby when our eyes touch it was heart felt
Everything I say the words I  speak girl you know it was truth (please believe it)
Girl I give my life, girl I sacrifice, everything I have is for you
(This whole world I'll give to you) 
Baby you're incredible and your body so remarkable
And your sex is so sensational 
That's what you [x4] are to me
You my nation and your summon to me
Don't need no damn jury 
Even Ray Charles could see
You best report (report to my bedroom baby)

(Report) right now, oooooooooh
It's time for some love making 
Break out those 
Sony videotapes
For some love taping 

[Chorus x2]
Lady you're incredible
And your body so remarkable
And your sex is so sensational
That's what you [x4] are to me 
Are to meeeeee [x3]
La la la la la de da la la
