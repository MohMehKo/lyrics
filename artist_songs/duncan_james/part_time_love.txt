I wanna tell you how I feel
Mmm yeah
The night is closing in
And I've gotta reveal
You are someone that
I  can't be with or be without
It's crazy
I wonder if you know
Mmm girl you amaze me
And I can't control

My desire, a fire, a feeling 
I can't hold back any longer
You gotta
Be mine tonight
Bring this thing alive
Can't sleep at night
Can't be who I
Wanna be without you next to me 'cos it's
Not enough
I Want more than just a
Part time love

I used to like playing games
Yeah
But now the morning after doesn't feel the same
Well
This should not be something
That just fades to nothing
I know
It's got to mean much more
Oh let your heart show
It's what I'm waiting for

That desire
A fire, a feeling 
I can't hold back any longer
You gotta
Be mine tonight
Bring this thing alive
Can't sleep at night
Can't be who I
Wanna be without you next to me 'cos it's
Not enough
Want more than just a
Part time love

I'm tired of staying silent
Trying to find the moment
It's time to tell you I can't hide

My desire, a fire, a feeling
I can't hold back any longer
You gotta
Be mine tonight
Bring this thing alive
Can't sleep at night
Can't be who I
Wanna be without you next to me 'cos it's
Not enough
Yeah you know that it's just
Hard enough
I need more I need more than a
Part time love

Yeah
Desire
Fire
