Cut me once again 
Feel my body shake 
This time you said it all 
trying not to break 
yeah your words let you down 
There's no need to blame 
I danced the fire bright 

[CHORUS]
You really turned my head 
With all the crazy messed up things 
you said 
And every time you speak you lie so well 
My heart lies broken at your feet 

so let me confess 
Cos i don't need to hide 
To solve this mystery 
That you build on lie 
Ooh lay my burden down 
It makes me feel so strange 
Open up my heart and try and find 
love again 

[Repeat CHORUS]
