I don't know what it is about you 
but you're always on my mind 
I don't know if you feel the same way I do 
cos we're running out of time 
I just need you to know 
there's a memory I hold 
and I wanted to share it with you .. 

[Chorus]
so won't you.... save this moment for me 
close your eyes and you'll feel 
I am right here beside you 
and im holding your hand 
so .. let this moment be yours 
even though we're apart 
understand that I still love you 
we're living sperate life 
but right now its time.... save this moment for me 

I just want you to trust me 
and I want you to care ..ohhh 
if its too late for us now 
keep this moment be shared 
I just want you to know 
if you're ever alone 
call my name and I'll always be there 

[repeat chorus]

if I could go back in time 
there will be no doubt in your mind 
of how much I love you........ 

[repeat chorus]
