Are you listening? 
I'm shooting rubber bands up at the stars 
Some days I just don't know where you are 
I'm feeling kind of lost down here 

I just had to call 
I'm not trying to tell how to do your job 
Seems like everyone forgot about love 
I'm feeling kind of lost down here 

[Chorus]
Tell me what does it mean 
Are you receiving me? 
And if there's something that I forgot 
I'll put it down in a letter to god 
To you 

Would you turn your back? 
Maybe we blew every chance we had 
Is it so hard to keep this world on track? 
When we're standing in your way 

[Repeat Chorus]

Sorry for all my mistakes 
I know it's hard to relate sometimes 
Between you and I 
Did we run out of time? 

[Chorus]
Tell me what does it mean 
Are you receiving me? 
And if there's something that I forgot 
I'll put it down in a letter to god 
And if there's something that I forgot 
I'll put it down in a letter to god 

To you
