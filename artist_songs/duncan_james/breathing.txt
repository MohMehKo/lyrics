Did i die today 
Coz i can't tell and i can't feel 
Nothing seems real 
Saw you cry today 
And deep inside subconcious mind 
There's another way 
So believe, trust in me, I'm alive 

[CHORUS]
I'm breathing and i'm learning to survive 
And i'm finding the way 
Since you brought me back to life 
Please don't walk away 
Promise me you'll stay 
Now i'm breathing 

I'm alive today oh 
And i can tell and i can feel 
Everything is real 
No more tears today 
And deep inside my concios mind 
We found a perfect way 
You can see, trust in me and we'll fly 

[Repeat CHORUS]
now i'm breathing 
i'm breathing 

so long i've played your game 
I'm sick and tired of always being led 
You really turned my head 
You really turned my head 

Strange to fall for jealousy 
Another love-struck fool 
Ooh maybe i was blind, blind 

[Repeat CHORUS]
so long i've played your game 
I'm sick and tired of always being led 
you really turned my head [4x]
