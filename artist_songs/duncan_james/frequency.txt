Looking at you, looking at me 
The signs you give out are so hard to read 
When I get close you pull away from me 
We used to talk on the phone 
Now when I call 
There's nobody home 
Drifting like a satellite 
So far away 

[Chorus]
How can I tune into your frequency 
Don't you let the signal die on me 
I'm reaching out for you to come 
back to me oh 
Come on let's talk about it 
Must be a way around it 
Don't disconnect from me 

Feeling my way in the dark 
Finding the thread that leads to your heart 
What did I do what have I done 
To hurt you 
Something in the atmosphere 
I can't get through 

[Chorus]
How can I tune into your frequency 
Don't you let the signal die on me 
I'm reaching out for you to come 
back to me oh 
Come on let's talk about it 
Must be a way around it 
Don't disconnect from me 

Yeah 
Don't disconnect from me 
Oh Yeah 
Something in the atmosphere 
I can't get through 

[Chorus]
How can I tune into your frequency 
Don't you let the signal die on me 
I'm reaching out for you to come 
back to me oh 
Come on let's talk about it 
Must be a way around it 
Don't disconnect from me 

Come on let's about it 
Must be a way around it 
Don't disconnect from me [2x]
From me
