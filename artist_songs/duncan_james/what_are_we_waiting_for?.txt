Everybody wants 
to love somebody 
its really simple but its not that easy 
everybody needs some reassuring 
but when you break it down 
they dont believe it 
everybody dreams of the perfect ending 
but its not a film and im not pretending 

sooo 
wont you tell me, 
does everybody feel the same 
like you and me, why cant you 
help me we've only got ourselves to blame 
just you and me why cant we 
fly, maybe if we jump together 
just you and me believe so 
what are we waiting for 

did i show you something 
a little bit frightning 
i didnt mean to scare you 
but i thought you should know 
that i need my distance 
but i want you closer 
am i making sense 
cos i dont think so 
and your a wild thing 
your gonna take your freedom 
and remember eve in the garden of eden 

sooo 
wont you tell me, 
does everybody feel the same 
like you and me, why cant you 
help me we've only got ourselves to blame 
just you and me why cant we 
fly, maybe if we jump together 
just you and me believe so 
what are we waiting for 

isnt there something better 
just a little more 
we can live and die this way 
dont you know 

sooo 
wont you tell me, 
does everybody feel the same 
like you and me, why cant you 
help me we've only got ourselves to blame 
just you and me why cant we 
fly, maybe if we jump together 
just you and me believe so 
what are we waiting for
