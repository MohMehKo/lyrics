Don't be scared of your shadow
You can't hide from your sorrow
You can't stay here till tomorrow

Welcome to the club of broken hearts
Where a thousand lonely souls
have passed

[chorus]
Sooner or later you're gonna wake up
And find what you're looking for
Like a diamond wahsed up on the shore
In the meantime you're feeling like you're lost without a friend
Sooner or later you're gonna love again
Sooner or later you're gonna love again

Love has left you rejected
You put u your defenses
Now, your heart's been tried and tested
Now you join the land of broken dreams 
No good wishing for what could've been

[repeat chorus]

Don't be scared of your shadow
You can't hide from your sorrow
[repeat chorus 3x]
