Whenever I see your face the world disappears, 
All in a single glance so revealing. 
You smile and I feel as though I've know you for years. 
How do I know to trust what I'm feeling? 

I believe my heart, 
What else can I do? 
When every part of every thought leads me straight to you. 
I believe my heart. 
There's no other choice, 
For now whenever my heart speaks, I can only hear your voice 

The life-time before we met has faded away. 
How did I live a moment without you? 
You donâ€™t have to speak at all, I know what you'd say. 
And I know every secret about you. 

I believe my heart. 
It believes in you. 
It's telling me that what I see is completely true. 
I believe my heart. 
How can it be wrong? 
It says that what I feel for you I will feel my whole life long. 

I believe my heart. 
It believes in you. 
It's telling me that what I see is completely true. 
And with all my soul 
I believe my heart. 
The portrait that it paints of you is a perfect work of art.
