I'm walking away 
with the sand beneath my feet 
I wanna stay 
but I'm feeling insecure 

you touch me 
you tell me, you want me 
it feels right, the first time 
my heart is breaking through 

I come alive , like awakened from within 
I come alive , with your fingers on my skin 
I'm falling, deeper 
Can't rest on my soul 
I come alive 

You are in bed 
Gotta burning into more 
This is the night 
And you gotta just let go 

you hold me 
you heal me 
you whisper 
it feels right, the first time 
my heart is breaking through 

I come alive , like awakened from within 
I come alive , with your fingers on my skin 
I'm falling, deeper 
Losing your control 
Flying higher 
Can't rest on my soul 

I come alive 

you touch me 
you tell me, you want me 
you hold me, you heal me 
you whisper 

I come alive , like awakened from within 
I come alive , with your fingers on my skin 
I'm falling, deeper 
Losing your control 
Flying higher 
Can't rest on my soul 

I come alive 
Can't rest on my soul 
I come alive 
Losing my control 
I come alive
