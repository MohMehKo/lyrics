Sitting here all alone dreaming 
Thinking of the summer days so long ago 
When the world was yours and mine 
Before it turned right on it's side 
And I remember how it felt to hold you 
And what about the plans we made 
When we were young 
Even though we're worlds apart 

[Chorus]
Do you ever feel lost? 
Like you'll never be found 
Do you ever feel broken into pieces 
on the ground? 
Do you ever feel scared? 
Like nobody cares 
Just tell me what you need and I'll be there 
Cos you know one thing in life is true 
Somebody still loves you [2x]

Standing here making tracks without you 
I wonder if our paths will ever meet again 
I still think of you that way 
You're in my hearts always 

[Chorus]
Do you ever feel lost? 
Like you'll never be found 
Do you ever feel broken into pieces 
on the ground? 
Do you ever feel scared? 
Like nobody cares 
Just tell me what you need and I'll be there 
Cos you know one thing in life is true 
Somebody still loves you [3x]
