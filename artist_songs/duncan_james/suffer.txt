Yes I know 
We're born a little bit surprised 
We went a little far this time 
Oh no 
And I said 
We've got too many thing to lose don't wanna live my life this way 

From a moment that lingered too long 
To a battle that can never be won 
So wrong yeah 

Thought it's love we both want 
It's a love we don't need 
Let's sit here in silence 
Let out heats bleed 
That it's hard to be strong 
When u're feeling so week 
Till the night's over 
Don't suffer alone 
Suffer with me 

So here we are 
Standing in an empty room 
I'm trying not to look at you 
That way 
Cos I care 
Thought it's hurting me so much inside 
I'm trying just to be your friend today 

It's a song that should have never been sung 
It's a race that should have never been run 
So wrong yeah 

If we can't share the highs 
Might as well share the pain 
I k now it's breaking every rule 
But it helps ease the strain 
I'd rather sit here in sorrow 
Again again 
In the arms of one another's suffering 

Thought it's love we both want 
It's a love we don't need 
Let's sit here in silence 
Let out heats bleed 
That it's hard to be strong 
When u're feeling so week 
Till the night's over 
Don't suffer alone 
Suffer with me
