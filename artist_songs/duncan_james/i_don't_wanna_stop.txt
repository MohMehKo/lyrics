A one way street that never ends 
No roundabouts or sudden bends 
My head arrives in a plase that's new 
But my heart is still with you,but my heart is still with you 
A crowed room or an empty space 
Thoughts of you I can't erase 
The answer id I can't go back 
Coz you don't wanna feel like that 
And I don't wanna feel like that 

but somethings are worthwhile 
fighting for 
And baby I just can't let you go 

[Chorus]
And I don't wanna stop 
And I don't wanna quit 
And I don't wanna end this thing with you 
Coz I just wanna start and never wanna stop this thing 
I got with you coz I 
I never wanna stop 
yeah I never wanna stop 

Lovers drown or drift away 
The colours fade and turn to grey 
Lets draw the line and face the fact 
That we don't wanna be like that 
Coz we don't wanna be like that 

You're one thing that's worthwhile 
fighting for 
And baby I just can't let you go 

And I just wanna breathe 
And I just wanna live without you 
next to me 
Coz I just need to know 
Come on let me know 
Is it real or is it not? 
If it's true then baby I don't wanna stop 
I don't wanna stop
