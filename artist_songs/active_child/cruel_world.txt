I dedicate my life to something richer
And all the things that come
'Cause that's no price at all
And I know you'll be there
And I want you to know I care because

Keep your head up, hold your head up even though
It's a cruel world
Count your blessing you won't need them when you're gone
It's a cruel world
You can't see it you can't see it even though
It's a cruel world

We're thrown into this life no raft no savior
Masked in self contempt and wrapped in cotton cloth
And it's just like a prayer
The way you showed me you care to be there and because

Keep your head up, hold your head up even though
It's a cruel world
Count your blessing you won't need them when you're gone
It's a cruel world
You can't see it you can't see it even though
It's a cruel world
