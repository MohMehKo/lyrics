There’s a beat, in the street and he’s calling your name
Try and run, try and hide, but there’s no one left inside
But sometimes, it’s a lonely one
But in your eyes, I feel the weight of the world
There’s a queen on a scene, and she’s calling your name
You can run, you can hide, but you probably won’t survive
So you reach and you clutch to the things you can remember
Of the scent or the touch of the one you miss so much
But sometimes, it’s a lonely one
But in your eyes, I feel the weight of the world
Feel the weight of the world
I feel the weight of the world
Sometimes, it’s a lonely one
I feel the weight of the world
