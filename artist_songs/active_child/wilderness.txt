Build your ship, let’s go out
In the wilderness we’ll run wild
It’s so cold but you know we belong here
Shout to the sky and a fire to keep us warm here
Build your ship, move down south
In the wilderness we’ll run wild
It’s so cold but you know we belong here
When we escape to that place we’ll be home, dear
It’s so cold but you know we belong here
Shout to the sky, and a fire to keep us warm here
