If you’re ever on the wrong side of this town
There’s some place that I know of that will hold you down
Travel south through the city avoiding all the passing cars
Streets are wrong, streets are trying to tear you up
If you’re even in need of a helping hand
There’s some people that I know of that will be your friend
Travel south through the city to the wrong turn signals
Streets are wrong, streets are trying to tear you up
As I go ooh, take shelter in my arms
Ooh, take shelter in my arms
If you’re afraid in the world
If you’re afraid in the world
Say a prayer tonight
Lay down and close your eyes
You’ll feel safer in my arms
You’ll feel safer
You’ll feel safer
If you’re afraid
If you’re afraid in this world
Say a prayer tonight
Lay down and close your eyes
You’ll be safer in my arms
You’ll be safer
You’ll be safer
If you’re afraid in this world
If you’re afraid in the world
Say a prayer tonight
Lay down and close your eyes
You’ll be safer in my arms
You’ll be safer
