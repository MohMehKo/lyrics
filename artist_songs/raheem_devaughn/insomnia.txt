Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up,
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up...

I'm looking at my T-shirt, it's 11 40 fizza
It's surrounded time and she calls to say his eye
I say confused she grabs the keys and now she's in the resign
8-90 desire, on the way to where I reside
And we don't say much once I bust her,
We get the friends kissing when I hug her
And now I think you're showing off falling your secrets
And now it's coming that's because her body language speaks it
Take off that white beat, take off your clothes,
Love me down in it and start at my toes
And my heart beat fast like a shot of caffeine
Keep her out a new due when we do the night thing
I give you

Insomnia, it's off with the lights, and off with the clothes
Man I keep her up like no goes,
Giving her insomnia, uh baby
Till I feel her body tremble like an earthquake
Uh, the more I give the more that she takes,
Giving her insomnia,
Like no doors, no sleep no clothes
Like no doors, no sleep no clothes
Insomnia

It's like 3: 45 still going strong,
Harder than the manners that still holding on
I chose the girl, her eyes is shut tight
And with a burst of energy she whispers love me all night
Alright, I'm on my second wind,
So once again we are in repositioning
And I'm not like those other rappers and I'm in
And from the tripping of the mocking birds we're here
We know the sunset's almost there
And we know it's shady missed me 'cause her body language tells
And I'm mister ever ready 'cause my sex drive never fails,
She comes through the door, then it's off with her clothes
Like a can of Redbull with a shot I know those
I give her

Insomnia, it's off with the lights, and off with the clothes
Then I keep her up like no clothes
I give her insomnia, no sleep, like noclothes
Till I feel her body tremble like an earthquake
Uh, the more I give the more that she takes,
Giving her insomnia,
Like no doors, no sleep no clothes
Like no doors, no sleep no clothes
Insomnia

Unplug the phone hit the lights,
Until the secret garden show you right
Turn on that harder noise, press repeat
I got an idea, let's compete
Let's see who last longer, let's see who pop first
Let's see who say who name first
No I don't like to lose, and I'm gonna play to win,
The night go on and on, it never seems to end
You can't seem to sleep, no not a wink
I'm feeling canky, get on the sink,
I sneak out on the movie, you'll be my leading lady,
Feel my own stunts, drive your body crazy
I set in - she black out, she climax
I climbed out, so time out and relocated
Living room, dining room, even on the bed yea

Insomnia, it's off with the lights, and off with the clothes
Then I keep her up like no clothes
I give her insomnia, no sleep, like noclothes
Till I feel her body tremble like an earthquake
Uh, the more I give the more that she takes,
Giving her insomnia,
Like no doors, no sleep no clothes
Like no doors, no sleep no clothes
Insomnia
