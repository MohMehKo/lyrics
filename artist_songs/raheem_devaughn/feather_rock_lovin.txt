And the reflection of the moon
(light as a feather, hard as a rock)
Bounces off your, naked anatomy
(after night fall)
Damn
(after night fall)

(Welcome to)
A moment called anticipation
That won't subside
Till' I capsize
Now get your garters down
Let your body be free
How long has it been
Its been a long time comin'
Such a long time comin' girl
Sweet heart
How long has it been
Since your lips a part to kiss
The gentle touch
The rapid pace of passion
Oh

[Hook:]
If its loving you want
I got the pleasure you need
Light as a feather, hard as a rock
Light as a feather, hard as a rock
Seduction and instant gratification
After night fall
After night fall

I'm gonna' be all over your body
Like lotion, like a shower, like bath and body works
(Feel the) Feel the thrust of this wood while you grabbin' on my torso
Bet you're sweet like a ball of cotton candy from the fair
As wet as the Atlantic in your damp underwear
Take them off
Its time to break you off and get you off
Sweetheart
How long has it been since the wetness in your kiss
Since the rapid heart beat of passion

[Hook:]
If its loving you want
I got the pleasure you need
Light as a feather, hard as a rock
Light as a feather, hard as a rock
Seduction and instant gratification
After night fall
After night fall

No
Don't deprive yourself of it
Relax, releasing lovin'
Promise, this is where you need to be honey
Baby how long has it been since the wetness in our kiss
Since the rapid heartbeat of passion

[Hook x2:]
Gonna do you [x6]
Light as a feather, hard as a rock
Light as a feather, hard as a rock
After night fall
After night fall
Light as a feather, hard as a rock
Light as a feather, hard as a rock

After night fall
After night fall
Light as a feather, hard as a rock
Light as a feather, hard as a rock...
