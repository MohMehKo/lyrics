Hey sip on some white cool us
Like a 19 again
When love was so naive
Before past relationships build the wall of bricks and
Need you bring it back and join the sleep
Think she was rocking Dookie breaks
And time wasn't of the essence
But the whole day passed away
Rest in peace Arthur David

I know you feel me, I know you hear me
So keep the baby happy that's what you need to do

That's what you wanna do, what you need
It's what you gotta do to keep that woman
Hard to keep that woman open
It's what you want, (it's what you want)
It's what you need man yeah
It's what you gotta do to keep that woman
Hard to keep that woman open

Eyes go crush on the phone call, no no
Not too good at interrupting ya
The pureness and innocence
When love was so ancient fair
Before broken hearts and type of feelings
When it was a thing to do
On a buck bitch caught you
But she was waiting with the pony tail
And bad move with earrings
Standing at the bus stop sucking on a lollipop
And a rather way type of girl

I know you feel me, I know you hear me
To keep baby happy that's what you need to do

That's what you wanna do, what you need
It's what you gotta do to keep that woman
Hard to keep that woman open
It's what you want,
It's what you need man yeah
It's what you gotta do to keep that woman
Hard to keep that woman open

That's what you wanna do, what you need
It's what you gotta do to keep that woman
Hard to keep that woman open
It's what you want
It's what you need man yeah
It's what you gotta do to keep that woman
Hard to keep that woman open

Keep your baby try this oh yeah
What you gotta do to keep that girl
Keep that woman, gotta do to keep that woman
What you want, what you want, what you want
Gotta do to keep that woman,
Gotta do to keep that woman open,
What you want, what you need
You gotta do, you wanna do
What you want, what you need
You gotta do, you wanna do
