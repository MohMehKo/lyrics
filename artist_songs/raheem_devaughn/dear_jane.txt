Dear Jane, take one
Your face turn me up
I mean maybe if you little bit more powerless
[?]
I wish how could you never chosen?
And every time you look at me
It's fine I leave me frozen
From across the room oh
Honestly for some time I've been curious about you
Curious about you like how you sleep at night
The type of food you like
And what you look like with your clothes off

Cause she's would be bossing rumor floating
I can hear now talking
How you my got my note wide open?
The phone would be buzzing and ringing
A lot of text messages and questions too
So if you were a secret I couldn't keep it
I wouldn't want to for girl
A girl like you you
I could ride for you and give you my aw
Shit, it ain't nothing I wouldn't do
This town for us
This town for us is way too small
A girl like you you
I could ride for you and give you my aw
It ain't nothing I wouldn't do, no
This town for us
This town for us
This town for us is way too small
When you're the girl I used to know
You're the girl I used to know
The girl I used to know

One kiss, ain't a choice in the matter
Put some more and we can let it share
But those feelings will always be here
[?]
I know it's a selfish thing to say
But when I'll finally have my way
I'll live with the guilt and be cool
I'll lie to myself and be cool
Selfishly [?] myself we'll work it out

Cause she's would be bossing rumor floating
I can hear now talking
How you my got my note wide open?
The phone would be buzzing and ringing
A lot of text messages and questions too
So if you were a secret I couldn't keep it
I wouldn't want to for girl
A girl like you you
I could ride for you and give you my aw
Shit, it ain't nothing I wouldn't do
This town for us
This town for us is way too small
A girl like you you
I could ride for you and give you my aw
It ain't nothing I wouldn't do, no
This town for us
This town for us
This town for us is way too small
When you're the girl I used to know
You're the girl I used to know
The girl I used to know

Me and you can never be together
But I want you forever alright
I suppose this town is way way too small for the both of us
For the both of us
So girl, me and you can never be together
But I want you forever alright
I suppose this town is way way too small for the both of us
For the both of us
So girl, me and you can never be together
But I want you forever alright
I suppose this town is way way too small for the both of us
For the both of us
Damn
