Baby just stay a while, stay a while
Baby just stay a while and lay a while
Baby just stay a while

I appreciate the things you do
Bubble baths to keep the skin smooth
Candle lights just to set the mood
Feel that hoodie, put you in the mood
We could share a zone, all over
But you don't have to walk alone
You got me busting for my favourite modes
Hey baby, let's come back soon
My heart is not truly yours
So we could act like the sea to the shore
This is more than a metaphor
And I never felt this way before!

Baby, oh, oh, just stay a while
Oh, just lay a while!
You're all that I need
You wanna just stay a while, lay a while
Just lay a while!

I, I dig your dress and your hairdo
I, I get chills when I'm next to you!
If you don't know what I wanna do
Well baby here's a clue!
I'll take your mind to another place
Have you floating like out of space
Me and you can raise a bird away
When you come it's like an earthquake
You gyrate and then I'm in shape
The freak in me, girl you elevate!
Uh ain't no sweet inside your skin tone
Uh just wait till I get home
You got work in here and music
All night I wanna do it
All day I wanna do it
Back it up, I put my back into it!

You're all that I need
I want you to stay a while
Stay... Just lay a while!
You're all that I need
I want you to stay a while, lay a while
Just lay a while!

Ain't the type of love you wait
I recognize my soul mate
Just chill with me for a few
Then connect the dots on this Deja Vu
Cause baby when it comes to you
Ain't much that comes before you
I can't ask for, and I can't give
And I promise, as long as I live
Honestly gravity ain't no I in you and me!
You and me love, we can make it
We can make it, we can make it
Towards our first nights become forever
Things just keep getting better
Your love just keeps getting better!

You're all that I need
I want you to stay a while
I want you to stay stay... Just lay a while!
You're all that I need
I want you to stay a while, lay a while
Just lay a while!

(Just lay right here baby)
I want you to stay a while
You should just like
Just lay a while

You're all that I need
I want you to stay a while, lay a while
Just lay a while!
