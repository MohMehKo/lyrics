What's your favorite song of my love
Desire, desire, desire, desire
Slip into something comfortable
See I can really slow dance
Like a margaret
I'm gonna put my arms around you girl
I'm prepared
I got something to show you
I'm prepared to rock your world girl
Prepared to make this room spin
Let's fast forward
To the point that we both ain't here
But I can't wait to kiss all of the above
Can't wait to give you all of my slow love

[Chorus:]
After we slow dance
Me and you (me and you)
Slow dance (slow dance)
I just wanna slow love, slow love
After we slow dance
I want to make you feel lady like
For the first time when we make love
When we slow love
After we slow dance

Gonna in work over time
Over time baby (baby!)
Rock you from the night shift
To the day shift girl
After we slow dance
Gonna give your crescendo
Bouncing off the window
The sound of your echo, echo, echo
Pace myself like a distant runner
Pace myself like a marathon
Pace myself like a tic tac tic
Pace myself when I give you that

Let's rewind to the point where me and you were slow dancing
I had your body and my grip
Whispering in your ear
We really should take a trip to my place

[Chorus:]
After me and you (me and you) slow dance (slow dance)
I just wanna slow love, slow love
After we slow dance
I want to make you feel lady like
For the first time when we make love
When we slow love
After we slow dance

I'm here for the way you feel in my hands, 
I don't even know your name yet. 
My name's Raheem DeVaughn. 
Oh yea, that's me. My new album, yea.

This is for the bedroom
This is for the bed, bed
This is for the bedroom
This is for the bed, bed
This is for the bedroom
This is for the bed, bed
This is for the bedroom
This is for the bed, bed

[Chorus:]
After me and you (me and you) slow dance (slow dance)
I just wanna slow love, slow love
After we slow dance
I want to make you feel lady like
For the first time when we make love
When we slow love
After we slow dance
