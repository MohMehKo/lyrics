You ain't got no business making me feel like this, oh yeah
It's the way you arch your back when you bite your lips, oh yeah
You got something, I can't comprehend
Can you handle it when I'm all the way in?

[Chorus:]
It will probably make you cry baby, baby
When I love your body like I do
When I make you say ooooh whooo ooooh whooo ooooh whooooo
Cry the tears of joy baby 
It will probably make you cry, baby
Cry out, when I put this love inside of you
I will make you say oooh whooo ooooh whooo whooo whoo hoooo
So go ahead and cry, cry!

I can't wait to dim the lights and make you scream baby
Baby, go on and lean back let me dive right in, oh yeah
Your thighs (your thighs) 'round my waist ('round my waist)
Put that (right there) on my face
Can you (can you) handle it (handle it) when I'm all the way in?

[Chorus:]
It will probably make cry baby (baby)
When I love your body like I do
Gonna make you say oooh whooo ooooh whooo whooo whoo hoooo
Tonight when I lay your body down, I promise you
It will probably make you cry, baby
Cry tears joy (when I put this love inside of you)
It will make you say oooh whooo ooooh whooo whooo whoo hoooo 

You'll be screaming (screaming)
Screaming my name girl when I go deep (when I go deep)
Shaking and trembling and wetting up the sheets
Raining like a shower from the sky above
as the tears come down baby
You're my rain forest, your my garden
Fill me up 

[Chorus:]
It will probably make you cry baby, baby
When I love your body like I do
Gonna make you say oooh whooo ooooh whooo whooo whoo hoooo 
Talkin' tears joy ooooh whooo
baby and I will probably make you
Cry baby, cry, when I put this love inside of you
So go ahead and say oooh whooo ooooh whooo whooo whoo hoooo 
Cry, cry, cry!

Poppa gonna make you cry baby
When I love your body like I do (Go ahead)
Gonna make you say oooh whooo ooooh whooo whooo
Cry, cry, cry!

I will probably make you
Cry baby, cry, when I put this love inside of you 
what you do (when I put this love inside of you)
Cry, yeah

Get your body ready, baby
Come to poppa, time to make you cry

(when I love your body like I do)

When I love your body like I do
Gonna make you say oooh whooo ooooh whooo whooo

It will probably make you cry
Go ahead and cry (cry) cry
When I put this love inside of you
Cry, Cry, Cry, Cry...
