[Intro]
I just wanna speak from the heart right now
To a friend in need
I hope you get this

[Verse 1]
Love ain't pain love ain't fear
Love ain't bruises love ain't tears
Love ain't two in the morning phone call, phone call to 911
Love ain't fear for your life day and night
Isolated from your loved ones
And I know it ain't make up to cover your scars
Compromising who you are

[Chorus]
So tell me (tell me)
What type of love is that to you (to love you)
To love you till you're black and blue (oh no woman)
That's something I would never do (no)
I'd never put my hands on you 

[Verse 2]
Love ain't ?? love ain't shame
Love ain't callin you out your name
Love ain't leavin you blue and black
Love is a man who has your back
Love won't knock you to the ground
Love ain't designed to bring you down
Love don't beat you or mistreat you 
Or only loves you when he needs to

[Chorus]
So tell me (tell me yeah yeah)
What type of love is that to you (what type of love is that)
To love you till you're black and blue (black and blue)
That's something I would never do (I would never ever ever ever)
I'd never put my hands on you 

[Verse 3]
(Love is)
Love is courage love is hope
Love is facing all your fears
Love is strength in seeking help
Love is the joy inside your tears
Love is help to lend a hand
Being loved by a real man
Love is this, from me to you 
'Cause I would never put my hands on you

[Chorus]
Tell me
What type of love is that to you (what type of love)
To love you till you're black and blue (what man would leave you black and blue)
That's something I would never do (no)
I would never put my hands on you (never put my hands on you)

[Chorus]
Tell me 
What type of love is that to you (yeah what type of love)
To love you till you're black and blue (that's something I would never do)
That's something I would never do (I would never never never never put my hands on you)
I would never put my hands on you 

[Outro:]
(Only) only love you, only kiss you only hug you, only love you [8x]
