First, unwrap my body
Like I'm your birthday gift
And like a birthday wish
Tell me what you need
And I got you girl
Let me perform for you
Did it all for you
And you're always welcome to another round
Of me and you

Let your inhibitions go, go
I'm a make you make up one, one
Let it run, I'm gonna spank your body yell
Make your body yell
You might even break your nails
Let the mattress sing speak, speak
I can hear your heart beat, beat
Gonna make this night feel like this when I stunt you in the sheets baby
Open up a while for me,

When you touch, I kiss, your skin
I swear it's no drag, I stroke
This love inside of your heart
And rejoice, let your love rejoice
Let your body rejoice, let your body rejoice

When you ready for round 2, let these lips of mine anoint you
How could I ever disappoint you, look at you, oh look at you
Leave your footprints on the wall, take that pillow off your face
I love to see the passion in your face
When I'm in your secret place,
Right before you explode

Let your inhibitions go, go
I'm a make you make up one, one
Let the smell of my sweat and cologne
Let the mattress sing speak, speak
When you hear your heart beat, beat
Gonna make this night feel like this when I stunt you in the sheets baby
Open up a while for me,

It's your touch, my kiss, your skin, my lips my sweat
Slow jam, I stroke
With this love inside of your heart
And rejoice, let your love rejoice
Let your body rejoice, let your body rejoice
Like we just reached the finish line, rejoice
Climax at the same time, rejoice
Like you just jumped the broom, rejoice
Like it's our honeymoon, rejoice
You and I should rejoice, rejoice
Like it's your birthday baby, rejoice
All your love, and my heart, rejoice, babyyyyy!

It's your touch, my kiss, your skin, my lips my sweat
Slow jam, I stroke
With this love inside of your heart
And rejoice, let your love rejoice
Let your body rejoice, let your body rejoice

It's your touch, my kiss, your skin, my lips my sweat
Slow jam, I stroke
With this love inside of your heart
And rejoice, let your love rejoice
Let your body rejoice, let your body rejoice

It's your touch, my kiss, your skin, my lips my sweat
Slow jam, I stroke
With this love inside of your heart
And rejoice, let your love rejoice
Let your body rejoice, let your body rejoice

Oh baby, rejoice all over me
I wanna rejoice
Exploded inside of you
Uh, open up wide
And rejoice for me
