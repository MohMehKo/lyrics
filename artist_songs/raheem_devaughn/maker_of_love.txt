I think I can speak for all men when I say
There's something exceptional, unique
About a woman

Your colgate smile
Those pretty brown eyes
Like heaven smooth skin
Your hair in the wind
Them legs in those heels
That switch all in you walk girl
That sexy way you talk girl
Like a DaVinci painting art girl
And I, if I can make you with a magic wand
I wouldn't make you no other kinda away

You was made by the maker of love?
You was made by the maker of love
Baby listen I said I wouldn't change a thing
I wouldn't want you, couldn't have you, no, other kind away
You was made by the maker of love?
You was made by the maker of love

Your body bath whores
Your hips in that skirt
The smell of a fragrance
Or the taste of sweet kiss
The passion, the thrill
Goose bumps and the chills
Thy wish is thy will
And I'll do anything for you
See when it comes to you

See I love how the way he made you
And I wouldn't change one thing
You was made by the maker of love?
You was made by the maker of love
See I, if I made you
I wouldn't change one thing
You was made by the maker of love
You was made by the maker of love

From head to toe
You were made for love
You were made for man, made for me
You were made to smile, for a smile
To light up the world
You were made to cherish
To have and to hold
So forever for now
See that's why I say

You was made by the maker of love?
You was made by the maker of love
If I, if I made you I wouldn't change a thing
You was made by the maker of love
You was made by the maker of love
See I, I know you were made, you were tailored made
You was made by the maker of love
You was made by the maker of love, Made by the maker, tailored made
You was made by the maker of love
You was made by the maker of love
Love, love, love
Made by the maker of love
You was made by the maker of love?
You was made by the maker of love
Love, love yeah
Maker of love
Who was made by the maker of love?
You was made by the maker of love
