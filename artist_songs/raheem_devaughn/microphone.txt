[Verse 1]
She is the passion
She is my melody
And I amplify, amplify her sexuality 
When the lights go out
My bed is the stage
Her body is the pole
And we just lose control
And let nature take its course
Just like that I'm in the palm of her hand
Like a mike in the stand
Turn us up if yall don't hear me

[Chorus:]
Like the greatest show on earth known to man
Mike check one two
Mike check one two two
Like the whole world inside the palm of her hand
Mike check one two
Mike check one two 
Like the perfect song in the key of love
Mike check one two
Mike check one two two
We gone repeat the love cause I can't get enough
When she's all on my microphone
Oooh oh oh ohhh when she's all on my microphone
Oooh oh oh ohhh when she's all on my microphone 
I'll make her ooh I'll make her oh
when she's all on my micropone
The greatest show known to man 
Is in the palm of her hand

What a work of art 
When she's all on my microphone

[Verse 2]
Verse two only gets better
Like the calm of a storm 
Before it get wetter
And when she does that sexy choreography 
It's like a pole dance trick
And she's on top of me
When the lights go out
Her body is like a speaker
Amplifies when I freak her
Loud as a siren
Falsetto dream
I make her body draw
Like an 808 form
Like a mike in the stand
In the palm of her hand

[Chorus]

[Hook]
Her lips are pricelss
Her body is priceless
Her technique is priceless
Like a sold out show
After paying all my dough
But now she's on my body like a stage
First the lights dim down
And I'm plugged in now
And the show begins
She makes the night seems so long
Like a never ending song
When she's all on my microphone
Oooh  oh oh ohh when she's all on my microphone
Oooh  oh oh ohh when she's all on my microphone
Oooh  oh oh ohh when she's all on my microphone
Oooh  oh oh ohh when she's all on my microphone
Mike check one two
Mike check one two two
