And these are the words of a man thankful for a woman
Your intellect
For your stuff is bent
Even your plus size
The brown in your pretty eyes
Your kinky hair
Are they burning red
[?]
And it ain't hard to keep the complements coming
Cause these are the words of a man thankful for a woman

With all my heart I love you baby
Beautiful woman
With all my heart I love you
Love you baby

For your motherhood
You'll do it good
For your independence
Confident
Confidence
For your leap of faith
How long before you can't go on and go away?
As a daughter, sister, mama wife and aunty, grandma, lover

With all my heart I love you
When a man loves his lady
Loves his woman
Loves his daughter
These are the ones
With all my heart I love you baby
Know that we
Know that I love you woman

And it's the kind of love that will stand the test of time
The test of time
Many people wonder where my secret lies
I'm not cute or built to suit the fashion marble size
When I start to tell them
They think I'm telling lies
I say it's in the reach of my arms
The span of my hips
The stride of my step
The curl of my lips
I'm a woman phenomenally

With all my heart I love you baby
With all my heart I want you baby
With all my heart I love you baby
With all my heart I love you baby
With all my heart I love you baby

You can walk into a room just as cool as you please
Then to a man to fall or stand or stand down on their knees
Then they swirl around me [?] honey bees
I say it's the fire in my eyes
The flash of my teeth
The sling in my waist
The joy in my feet
I'm a woman phenomenally
Men themselves have wondered what they see in me
They try so much but they can't touch my inner mystery
When I try to sow them they say they still can't see
I say in the heart of my bed
The sun of my smile
The ride of my breasts
The brace of my style
I'm a woman phenomenally
Now you understand just why my head's not bound
I don't shout or jump about
Or have to talk real loud
When you see me passing it ought to me you proud
I say in the click of my heels
The band of my hair
The palms of my hands
The need for my care
Because I'm a woman phenomenally
