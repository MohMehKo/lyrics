First see the city skyline shining from my room
It's such a sight to see, in the month of June
Beautiful, like the moon's, reflection, when, it's bouncing off your skin
And before you let me in (woo) I hear you say (Oh, It's been a long time)
I say Okay-kay-kay don't worry I got you
Then you say (I want some foreplay)
I got that, got plenty, I got you-oooh-ooh-ooh (then you say)
Play some slow jams
Like that Sade, Al Green and Marvin Gaye too 
And love you gently (to love you gently oooh)
Let me touch you gently (ooh, alright, It's gonna be alright)
Light as feather but hard as a rock
That's how I go in the bedroom
I'm gonna love you (gonna love you gently oh oh yeah yeah oh oh)
Touch your body gently
Light as a feather hard as a rock yeah (all day long)

See I know just when to finish, and I know just when to start
And I'll be loving your reaction, every time I hit that spot (gently)
But it's off like leather when the top is hard
Whisper your pleasures right on my top
We go ready and intense when I do what I do
Girl I don't know what's echoing louder, the music or you (gently)
I ain't close to being done yet (gently)
But you're getting real warm (gently)
like the calm of the thunder (gently) right after of the storm (gently)
Til you say you say, til you tell me no (I...I'm gonna push it to the limit)
Give my all (It's yours, it's yours)
See second place don't win no race I'm gonna be your number one (Let's go)
Til the sun shines (Look)
Here comes the sun, let's try to taste the moon again (forever more)
As the sound of love ricochets on the wall
Let me touch you gently (Let me love you, hey)
Light as a feather but hard a rock (that's my love in the bedroom)
Gonna love you gently (gently, my love is so)
Light as a feather but hard as a rock (ooh ooh ooh ooh)
Let me touch you gently (I'm gonna love you, gonna kiss you, gonna touch you)
Light as a feather hard but as a rock
(Hey, tell me does it feel good when I touch you)
Gonna love you gently (hey hey) Make it feel good on the inside of the inside
Light as a feather but hard as a rock 

Let me love you
Your skin should be touched gently
Your lips should be touched gently
Your body should be touched gently
Your body should be stroked gently
Your lips should be kissed gently
Your hair should be pulled gently
(Hey) I'll be a perfect gentlemen 
Love you gently [x9]
Love you-ooh-ooh-ooh
