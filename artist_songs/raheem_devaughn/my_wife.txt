As a man, there's a time when you gotta man up
And you might even know how to say it
Well, all you gotta do is play her this

Tell her, sit down for minute, let me talk to you
Better yet say, baby, stand up
And let me get on one knee and explain

I broke hearts and I've had girlfriends
Varieties and even one night stands
I've played the field even thought I had Miss Right one time
But I guess it wasn't in the most high's plan

When you spoke I recognized your voice
And felt like dejavu this time
I'm prepared for you, the scrimmage is over
I'm a keep it real and true

Don't want no girlfriend
Don't want a two week love affair that just ends
Don't need no married
Not five, not three, just one

I want you to be my wife
My wife, my wife
I want you to be my wife
My wife, my wife

I want you to be my wife
My wife, my wife
I want you to be my wife
I want you to be my wife, my wife

So just say yes and pick out your dress
My friends say I'm crazy but girl, I wouldn't load right now
Now hold out till we get to the hotel room on our honeymoon
Never thought I'd be doin' it this soon but hey

Oh, I'm not afraid of love, I'm with you because
I'm a grown man now, ooh, I've got a winner this time
I see my dreams come true, I'm prepared for you
This scrimmage is over, I'm a keep it real with you

Don't want no girlfriend
Don't want no two week love affair that just ends
Don't need no married
Not five, not three, just one

Won't you be my wife?
My wife, my wife
I want you to be my wife
My wife, my wife

I want you to be my wife
My wife, my wife
I want you to be my wife
I want you to be my wife, my wife

And after we say I do
I'm a hand dance with you
Tell the DJ to play that jam
DJ Wayne Williams, play that jam

And after we say I do
I'm a line dance with you
And tell the DJ to play that jam
Hey, Kenny dope-man, play that jam?

I want you be my wife
My wife, my wife
I want you to be my wife
My wife, my wife

I want you to be my wife
My wife, my wife
I want you to be my wife
I want you to be my wife

I want you be my wife
My wife, my wife
I want you to be my wife
My wife, my wife

...
My wife, my wife
I want you to be my wife
I want you to be my wife
Say yes
