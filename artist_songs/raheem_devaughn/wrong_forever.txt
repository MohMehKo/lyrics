Oh darling

Girl we touch so soft
Your back's so strong
I wanna love you baby all night long
Making love make you feel like forever
Forever ever forever ever ever ever
Oh baby oh

I can make a kiss feel like a second
Like a minute, like an hour, like a day baby
Make the passion feel like two days, three weeks and more baby
But tomorrow's here already and we're still rocking steady
Baby I'm a be on my job
With stamina until the counter watch is hot
Until you say oh my God oh my God
I'm gonna serve you

Girl we touch so soft
Your back's so strong
I wanna love you baby all night long
Making love make you feel like forever
Forever ever forever ever ever ever
Oh baby oh

Uh see I can get you caught up
In about a day, a week
Gimme a couple months
Happy wifed up make you breakfast in bed
All the while I'm giving you attention
Got you discern after 'bout a year 
I would settle down and have your kids
It's so simple baby
Driving me crazy
Forever want to feel like this, baby

Boy we kiss or touch
Want you so much
I just wanna love you all night long
Making love make you feel like forever
Forever ever forever ever ever ever

Girl we touch so soft
Your back's so strong
I wanna love you baby all night long
Making love make you feel like forever

Oh baby oh

I'm a do it like I ain't stopping when I rock the boat
Take you where you ought to go
Make you what you ought to know
But all you got to know
I got to give the proper stroke
Nothing like an MD nigga no doctor coat
You know the dudes that top the most be the weakest
That's why I need to speak and the sheets leave you speechless
We making every night one to remember
So every time we doing it we doing it forever
That's the clever way to put it
Ain't it ain't?
But the picture I'd rather paint it that it's raining
So you peak you can obtain it
You be tainted by your ex trying to reset sex
So great I'm 'bout to make you a key set
Let yourself in don't have to wait up on me when I... the dorm
I don't know what it is whenever I hit ignore
Shorty I'm all yours shut the door, shut the blinds
I promise we'll be cutting
I will never cut the time
It's forever

Girl we touch so soft
Your back's so strong
I wanna love you baby all night long
Making love make you feel like forever
Forever ever forever ever ever ever
Oh baby oh

Boy we kiss or touch
Want you so much
I just wanna love you all night long
Making love make you feel like forever
Forever ever forever ever ever ever

Girl we touch so soft
Your back's so strong
I wanna love you baby all night long
Making love make you feel like forever
Forever ever forever ever ever ever
