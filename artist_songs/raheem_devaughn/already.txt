When you're fresh up off the shower
Body's still wet
And gently rub cowers gown upon your skin
I knew the angle of your putting on your boy shorts
From a distance I'm intrigued to watch you bend, uh
I'm all the way turned up cause your clothes off and you're topless
I'm all the way turned up cause your lotus flower's the bomb
I'm all the way turned up cause you get my hormones racing
I'm all the way turned up cause once again it's on
We are here, we're here
And I'm pushing every position
And what is a French kissing?
And you taste so good, you should be sold in a bottle
The way you put your back into it
Every which way you let me do it
We see the stars when all goes black

Are you coming now? I ain't coming yet
Already though, already
Already though
Cause you give me
Are you coming now? I ain't coming yet
Already though, already though
Already though

Take a moment girl to breathe to find your composure
And if you must girl, pinch yourself to know that it's real (it's real)
And if you like, I'll just lay and stay here inside you
Cause you feel so good I could die right now if looks could kill
As you drift (lye, ay, ay)
I'll just slip (down down down)
My fingertips
Caress your temple
I will be
The only thing
On your subconscious
You think about
On your mental
All from 2 to 3 to 4 o'clock in the morning
You're my moon, you're my stars and the sky that's open
Soon the birds, they don't churf
And sun will be arising
You'll be broken over
And we'll be getting back to you
And I'm all turned up cause you decided you wanted to ride me this morning yea
Yea, I'm all turned up and I woke up feeling this morning, yes I did
And I'm all turned up
So turned up, you might even need some dickly, bout me some sipping every day
Yea, I'm all turned up
Like in a long glock in the air
It's check in time when I wake you up
It's coming out

Are you coming now? I ain't coming yet
Already though, already though
Already though
Cause you give me
Are you coming now? I ain't coming yet
Already though, already though
To the feeling in my torso to my pair of groans I know
Already though

Are you coming now? I ain't coming yet
Already though, already though
Are you coming now? I ain't coming yet
(I got you got you, I got you, I got you)
Already though, already though
