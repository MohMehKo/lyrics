[Spoken:]
Not in this lifetime,
Or even, even in the next
I could go a million places,
Meet a million girls
But none... none would compare to you (none)
For example...

It was pure coincidence
I met her on the block when
She was from the land of Venus

Her voice was like the perfect song
Brown eyes, hair long
Chemistry was good between us

Met another on a charter plane,
On my way back from Spain
Her name was Maria
(Maria)

But I don't really need her
(I don't need her)
'Cause the fact of the matter is

[Chorus:]
Even if I took her number to call her
(She's not you)
If we laid down there'd be no love involved
(She won't do)
Ooo she can't do me like you can 'cause, no
(She's not you)
See my mind is made up
I don't wanna wake up
I don't wake up and roll over if
(She's not you no)

Lips full hips wide
Dancer at 55
Make you wish you was her pole
Drinks done, last call (where)
Gotta go we can never be involved
Had a video shoot
Real petite, pretty cute
Met a girl by the name of Suzanne
(Suzanne)
Just like Maria
(Maria)
I don't need her
(I don't need her)
Cause the fact of the matter is

[Chorus:]
Even if I took the 7 digits tryna be slick
(She's not you)
If I cross the line laid with her one time, ooo
(She won't do)
She won't do, do do do do do like you do no no
(She's no you)
Plus my mind is made up
I don't wanna wake up
Don't wanna wake up and roll over if
(She's not you no)

You
She don't compare to you baby
Mm mmm mmm mm
She,
She don't cook like you baby
Mm mmm mmm mm
And if she did,
Probably wouldn't be good as yours

Forever and ever and ever,
Forever and ever and ever
So...

You belong to me

[Chorus:]
Even if I took her number hey hey yea
(She's not you)
And I called her 1 time trying to be slick 1 time and lay with her
(she won't do)
She won't do, do me like you do, no no
(She's not you)
Plus my mind is made up,
I don't wanna wake up
Don't wanna roll over and over if she's not you

I don't want no breakfast from her in the morning
(She's not you)
365 days of the year, all I want is you
(She won't do)
Even if I tried to be slick, cross the line, lay with her one time
(She's not you)
See my mind is made up
I don't wanna wake up
I don't wanna wake up to no one, no no
(She's not you)
She's not you
