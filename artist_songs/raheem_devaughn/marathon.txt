[Verse 1:]
As the seconds turn to minutes
As the minutes turn to hours
As the sound of love is hollared
Time just keeps elapsing
And I just keep climaxing
With sweaty palms to say the least
And you know just what to do to curl my toes
When she blows, there I go
I lose all control, and there's no need for batteries
Once you turned on your lights

I respond to her femininity...

[Verse 2:]
The sweet taste of heaven
I taste when I kiss you
Suga, you fulfill the passion
You make all my daydreams come true
I'm caught in your seduction
U make me less my more and more
When it rains, girl it pours
From the vibe to the core
Now feel your hands stretch my back
As you play in my lap
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
