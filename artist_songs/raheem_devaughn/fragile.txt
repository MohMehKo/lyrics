Sugar honey, ice tea 
It's me 
And I know what you been through 
So I won't spend you 
Until I begin to move within you 
In a windmill 
If you want me to pause or slow down 
I won't resume til 
You are prepared to come around 

I know the heart, requires tlc 
So baby put all your faith in me 
Give me that heart of yours 
I'll promise I'll be fragile, fragile 

Listen to your heart, (listen to your heart) 
And you'll hear all that is in store (all that is in store) 
I can offer you (you) an abundace of truth and loyalty 
All that is required that you put faith in me 

I know the heart, requires tlc 
So baby (ohh) put all your faith in me 
Give me that heart of yours 
I'll promise I'll be fragile, fragile 

This is my moment of truth, (this is my moment, this is my truth) 
And I vow to love with all that is required of me 
(to be) to be the best man that I can be 
All the ingredients that make up the recipe 

Once upon a time, (Once upon a time) 
I know your heart was broken (I know your heart was broken) 
Take this love of my (take this tlc) 
From me baby

Oh how I've missed you, 
Being that I only exist to assist you 
Come here and let me help untwist you 
I have a special ring for you 
But you should've known that the phone don't have a tone that fits you 
Let me show you what this do (this do) 
Miss lady, 
Put down your bags while I investigate your swag style 
You seem like you taste expensive like the last vowel 
A just because I know for sure you are agile, does not mean you are not fragile 

I know the heart (I know baby), requires tlc, (I know you need tlc) 
So baby put all your faith in me (put all your faith in me)

Give me that heart of yours (if you give me that heart of yours) 
I'll promise I'll be fragile, fragile (I'll be fragile baby)
