With affection like a dreamer 
With patience and understanding 
Like a teacher with a student, vice versa 
Promise not to hurt you, not to leave 
Not to lie, not to cheat, not to fuss 
Not to stress, like the rest in your past 

Believe me I ain't like most men 
I ain't like them others 
You then dealt with in the past 
Just have some faith 
That is all I ask, believe in me [repeat]

Why go searching, else where lurking 
When you been hurtin for the real thing 
Since I'm here before your eyes 
Lets make love to survive 

I be something like the rebirth 
Of love with a twist 
It started with a simple kiss 
What could be more precious 
Then the rebirth of love 

[Chorus (repeat)]
Believe in me 
Believe in me, just try...try 
Believe in me 

I got another way I want to tell you 

Lately I have been thinking 
About this crazy world, 
Being one step away from war 
So tonight baby, I want to make love to you 
Like this world is coming to an end 
And if we should die tonight, In the next life 
I'm gonna love you the same 
Ain't nothin gonna change
