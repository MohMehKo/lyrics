She said: Lay down and take the load off
Then gently her hands caressed my temples.
How 'bout another shot of wine and the scent of slow burning candles for the ambiance... to set the mood.

She said: The woman... the lady that I am in the street... well I left her right outside... right outside your door but if it's cool... I can stay the night.

[Chorus:]
And I'll be your heaven... your heavenly garden of loveooveoooveooooove
Looooveoooooveoooove loooove

The angelic nastiness she possessed
Made me lose my cool
Had me so so so subdued.
Love so good... eh
You can hear a pin drop
You can hear the springs pop
You can the headboard knocking
Like who's is it?
Knocking
Who's is it?
Knocking... it's knock 'it in repeatedly as she said to me...

[Chorus:]
And I'll be your heaven... your heavenly garden of loveooveoooveooooove
Looooveoooooveoooove loooove

(As we lay) So there we lay
(We lay as we lay)
Watching the moon become the sun.
(And as the moon become the sun)
Engage for the position of affection
And just like magic our pheromones are enraged once again she tellin'me all this nastiness in the morning...

[Chorus:]
And I'll be your heaven... your heavenly garden of loveooveoooveooooove
[Ad lib]
Looooveoooooveoooove loooove
See on the rainy nights she promised me that...

[Chorus:]
And I'll be your heaven...
Your heavenly garden of loveooveoooveooooove [ad lib]
Looooveoooooveoooove loooove

As we listen to the rain... pitter patter on the window pane...
I lay and I play in the garden... ahhhhh... eh
