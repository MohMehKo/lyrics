You came in and chose me
I was my own worst enemy
You could challenge all of my fears
Girl you conquered my emotions
I give my heart then be a better man than I ever was
Ain't nothing I'll do
Need strength
I'll go to where the truth is, you saved me

You saved me from myself
Convinced me all I need is you and certainly no one else
You saved me from myself
You convinced me I don't need nobody else
All I need is you
All I need is no one else

So glad you saved me from myself
Myself myself myself
You saved me from myself
Myself myself, you saved me

I used to have a heart of steel
But you, you were my kryptonite
And I'm sure that keep in me has died
In the part where I could rest won't need work
Like a guardian angel
For the lechers and what haters do
It's like a miracle what you do
Cause I believe in you

You saved me from myself
You convinced me all I need is you and no one else
You saved me from myself
You convinced me I don't need nobody else
All I need is you and no one else
So glad you saved me from myself
Myself myself myself
You saved me from myself
Myself myself
So glad you saved me from myself
Myself myself myself
You saved me from myself
Myself myself
You saved me

You you made a believer
In me, in you, in us
And even if the music should stop
Long as you don't
I am now free
Because I am you
And you are me

You saved me from myself
Saved me saved me
You saved me
You convinced me I don't need nobody else
You saved me from myself
You convinced me I don't need nobody else
All I need is you
So glad you saved me from myself
You convinced me
I convinced you
I know you saved me from myself
You convinced me I don't need nobody else
All I need is you and no one else
So I'm glad you saved me from myself
Myself myself
You saved me from myself
Myself myself
You saved me from myself
Myself myself
You saved me from myself
Myself myself
You saved me from myself
Myself myself
You saved me (saved me)
