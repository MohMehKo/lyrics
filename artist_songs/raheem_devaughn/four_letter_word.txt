I taste sweet melodies every time I kiss you
I yearn and toss and turn, every time I find myself missing you
Rain falls your sound is wet, don't feel as wet when ain't inside of you
Your skin is so a silhouette, at the stroke of my finger tips
Cause I hope your not the prototype, but the makings of the real deal
See it's been some time been some time since you came around
So I recognize just what I feel

It's that old four letter word that I feel you, when I touch you yeah
It's that old four letter word that I taste, when I kiss you yeah
It's that old four letter word that I recognize, so familiar yeah
It's that old four letter word Love love love love love love love

I feel sexy and confident, when I illuminate in your eyesight
I feel speechless and spellbound, so what's the use of even tryin' to put up the fight
I let down all my guards, you persuaded me when u did the same
I'm through it, played all my cards; I found a higher ground, a higher place
See it's been some time been some time, I know where u been, I been waitin on ya
But welcome back, I hope you're here to stay, here to stay
I always here about, sing about, even write about ya
Just know I had ya till ya slipped away

It's that old four letter word that I feel you, when I touch you yeah
It's that old four letter word that I taste, when I kiss you yeah
It's that old four letter word that I recognize, so familiar yeah
It's that old four letter word Love love love love love love love
