Lotus Flower Bomb, fire fly
When I'm low she take me high
I can teach you all the sounds of love

Oh here we are 6 degrees let's stand separation
Ambitiously wanna love you, wanna be your motivation
Fire bomb, lotus love, light the way, time for detonation
Kaboom when I blow your back out gonna black out
I'm gonna lead you to the garden of love
Tell me, is it cost a bull that we get it
We ain't even touching yet
Fucking on your naughty got your panties soaking wet

See the heart don't race but the money runnin
Another trilogy, I wanna keep you coming
I got all of that lingo, I got all of that wordplay
Feel me all in your cranium, tingling your vertebrae
Cause I see meee inside of you

The fantasy
I'm feeling when you dance with me
It's feelin like you need to be a lady, my baby
Can't you see? I'm talking bout eternity
Tell me would you care to be my lady, my baby?

Flower bomb let's not pause
You're so beautiful you deserve applause
Let's get up on the room say it ain't too soon
I just wanna shower you, help you bloom
Flower bomb, got my ego up
But I bone naked in your high heels
See you stride, you keep me amplified
I'lll keep you open wide
I'm talking so Miami wet til we hit the spot
Uh love we did it and we ain't' even touching yet
Fucking on your naughty got your panties soaking wet

See the heart don't race but the money runnin
Another trilogy, I wanna keep you coming
I got all of that lingo, I got all of that wordplay
Feel me all in your cranium, tingling your vertebrae
Cause I see meee inside of you

The fantasy
I'm feeling when you dance with me
It's feelin like you need to be a lady, my baby
Can't you see? I'm talking bout eternity
Tell me would you care to be my lady, my baby?

'Cause I don't know you and you don't know me
But I see it in your eyes, this is where you need to be
'Cause I don't know you and you don't know me
But I feel it when we dance, this is where you need to be mama
Cause I see meee inside of you (inside of you)
So this was for you
Lotus flower bomb yea
