I could do life forever, if the crime was loving you
And it wouldn't even really matter if the sky was falling too
Even lose my world and possessions, throw in the towel and I'm out the game
Baby without a question, the sentiment is still the same

[Hook:]
I love you for you (for you yea)
Cause you love me for me (you love me for me you do)
That means girl for ever (forever and ever and ever and ever and ever)
Times Infiniti (I'll love you baby)
I'm gonna keep loving on you
The way you love me for me (for ever for ever forever times)
Infiniti (times)
Infiniti
Infiniti

We could live to be old and grey girl
We can die forever young
Cause your love is one in a million, I could never love another one
I could do without the moon baby, I could do without the sun
You are proof that there's a heaven baby
My angelic heart

[Hook:]
I love you for you (I love you baby)
Cause you love me for me (You love me for me so genuinely)
That means girl for ever (forever, forever)
Times infiniti (i'm gonna keep loving on you)
I'm gonna keep loving on you (Forever, forever, forever...)
The way you love me for me (...forever, times)
Infiniti (times)
Infiniti (times, times)
Infiniti
