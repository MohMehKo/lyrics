Don't know where you've been
But I'm glad they let you in
Meet the band and all my friends
Introduce them to your friends
How did you like the show?
I spotted you in third row
I thought I'd let you know
(you're banging)
I recognize a girl with class
Bartender, fill her glass
I wanna watch her shake her
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

Forewarn you if I could
Right now you look so good
Right now I wish you would
Let me unwrap you baby
Cuz I've got a thing for chocolates
I've got a thing for sweets
I might make you melt girl
The way you dance to the beat
Forewarned

Aw, girl, I've got a sweet tooth
For chocolates, for you, for sweets
The softness of your skin
Like grandma's cookie batch
Oh, I think I've met my match
You're gorgeous (look at you)
Don't usually brag or boast
But I'm getting awfully close
To your goody goody jar
To you in my car
To us riding out from here

Now that your throat is wet
There's elbow room to start
Let's take full advantage
Hey girl, don't you panic
I've got an A in Physics

I've warned you like I should
My God, you look so good
You got a lot of soul in your hips
The way you lean back
Break me off a piece of that Kit Kat

I've got a thing for chocolates
I've got a thing for sweets
I might make you melt girl
The way you dance to the beat
Aw, girl
I've got a thing for chocolate
Sweetness

Break me off a piece of that Kit Kat baby
Ooh, ahh, ahh, my Lord
I'm getting real, real close to your goody goody jar

Sweet as you are
I've got a thing for chocolates
I've got a thing for sweets
I might make you melt girl
The way you dance to the beat

Let me in the cookie jar, baby
Let me in the cookie jar, baby
