When I first started bout jackin this beat
I imagined the eargasm I would give you and the faces you would make
Radio Raheem jackin the beats
Jackin the beats

When I ring your phone, will you tell me be on my way
So I can say, mhm,
Tell me to take time with your body
So I can say, mhm
You need some pepper and in some pleasure
Girl I got you, like a mind reader I see it
And your body so you need it
Well how bout you come over
And start this remix over
And I'll break break your body down
Till it feels like a coma
Do you feel, goose bumps and chills?
It's a gratification you feel like
Gonna feel good when I touch on it
Babe be nice if all night I was in you
Come kiss me, come with me, down the hall to my bedroom
Tonight we'll be...

Making love faces, making love faces
Shadows on the wall now the candles burning
Marathon sex every time your body's yearning
Making love faces, making love faces
My wet kises on your skin
Let's go hard don't hold it in

Girl, wrap my lips around you, my lips around you, my lips around you
Uh the chocolate milk it taste so sweet
Let my body connect the dots
Let your body show me the spots
To turn you on, to turn you out yeah
Tell me to strip and to unvalued I'll say, mhm
Lover, your body begging to, mhm
Keep it up for you, mhm
Give it up for you
It's a gratification you feel like
Gonna feel good when I touch on it
Babe be nice if all night I was in you
Come kiss me, come with me, down the hall to my bedroom
Tonight we'll be...

Making love faces, (we'll be) making love faces
Shadows on the wall now the candles burning
Marathon sex every time your body's yearning
Making love faces, (we'll be, we'll be) making love faces
My wet kisses on your skin
Let's go hard don't hold it in

When your legs start to tremble, does that means things you like it
Scream oh lord his name in vain, do you like it?
Don't know if it's lust or love what you like
But it's my pleasure smearing all of your mack make up on
We'll be making

Making love faces, making love faces
To the rhythm, soaking up the sheets and sweating up your palms
Marathon loving when your body be yearning
Making love faces, making love faces
And I'm inside till you say when
Then we gonna get it into this remix again
Love faces.
