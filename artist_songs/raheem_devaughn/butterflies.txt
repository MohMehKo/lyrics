Kiss me like when I dream of you
Notice me, act like you have a clue
Flirt with me, act like I interest you
Like my eyes do, wish I could undress you
So I try to find the words
But I only suffocate
Then my palms, they start to sweat
And my shirt is soakin' wet

You give me the butterflies
You give me the nervous side of life
Don't walk by just say "hello" baby
You are my day dreams when I'm awake

Let's sleep like I pretend we do
Convince me that day dreams do come true
Picture as where I picture you
And I just panic when you're in bird's eye view
And I try to say "hello" and the words don't come out right
Wish I could find myself but it's a losing fight

You give me the butterflies
You give me the nervous side of life
Don't walk by just say "hello" baby
You are my day dreams when I'm awake

I go dreamin' you go wakin' me
You won't catch me and I keep fallin' girl
You only notice me in a perfect world
But the world is so imperfect so...

You give me the butterflies
You give me the nervous side of life
Don't walk by just say "hello" baby
You are my day dreams when I'm awake
You are my day dreams when I'm awake
You are my day dreams when I'm awake
