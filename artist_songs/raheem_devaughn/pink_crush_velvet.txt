Baby, see first of all, wanna be known as freaks
So baby, turn the lights on, no shower peaking
Keep your high heels on and follow me
Cause I don't wanna wait another day
Be ready to scream, you'd better be
Cause girl I just want you to say

Baby you feel like pink crushed velvet
The sweetest I've ever felt before
And I knew soon as I felt it
Baby girl I knew I was gonna
Baby I can't help it
So pull your pink crushed velvet all on me

Now I will lay down, baby this ain't a scene
So why don't, I wanna take 2 rounds
Just come down
You're turning me I wanna come, get on it
Baby let's keep making noise
I'm screaming your name, I'm gone I can't control
Remember when you break me down

Baby you feel like pink crushed velvet
The sweetest I've ever felt before
And I knew soon as I felt it
Baby girl I knew I was gonna
Baby I can't help it
So pull your pink crushed velvet all on me

Right here, yeah
Put it on me
All on me
Let it rain
Now I want your pink anatomy all on me

Baby you feel like pink crushed velvet
The sweetest I've ever felt before
Oh I knew soon as I felt it
Baby girl I knew I was gonna
Baby I can't help it
So pull your pink crushed velvet all on me
