I never wanna break you down
I always wanna be around
Forever, baby don't go, forever
Forever and ever
(Baby don't go)
I never wanna leave you be
I want you for eternity, forever
Don't go
(Baby don't go)
Forever, and ever

I never said it'd be easy
(Baby don't go)
I never swore I'd be perfect
(Baby don't go)
I never say I ain't tempted
(Baby don't go)
But I never said you ain't worth it
(Baby don't go)
It's the cost of being human
(Baby don't go)
Makes it complicated
(Baby don't go)
But I knew just what I had in you 
(Baby don't go)
From the moment that we met
(Baby don't go)
I knew it was love

I never wanna break you down
(So don't go nowhere baby)
I always wanna be around
(Even when I'm complicated)
Forever, baby don't go, forever
Forever and ever
(Baby don't go)
I never wanna leave you be
I want you for eternity, forever
(Baby don't go)
Forever, and ever

I want this love forever more
Baby forever more more more
Even when it gets complicated
Baby
I want this love forever more
