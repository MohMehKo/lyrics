The way your body naked standing in your high heels
You make me, you make me feel so mannish
I start thinking, I start thinking
Dirty thoughts
Like how [?]
Like how sweet is the chocolate cake
Yeah
And when you take your jeans off just to put your heels back on

[Hook:]
When you strip yeah (strip, strip)
Strip (strip, strip, strip, strip)
All I know [?]
I want you to (I wanna persuade you to strip, Strip)
I can't wait till you (strip, strip, strip, strip)
Strip yeah
I want

When you're still fresh wet out the shower
You make me wish that I was all that water
I wanna lay out with you naked for hours (hours)
Let me help you out your bra and those panties too
Keep your high heals on for the freak in you
Now the song turn on I love it

[Hook:]
When you strip (strip, strip)

Strip, Strip
Yeah baby (strip, strip, strip, strip)
Oh baby take your clothes off
I want you to (Take your clothes off)
Strip

First you take your clothes off
Then you let your hair down
You ridin' me like a seesaw, ill become your playground
First you strip your clothes off
Then you let your hair down baby
Then you ride me like a seesaw baby ill become your play ground

[Hook:]

When you strip for me baby
