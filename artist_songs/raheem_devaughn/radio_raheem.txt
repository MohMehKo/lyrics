First I try to climb her
I wanna climb on top
Number one like a bullet
Bang bang bang bang
I'll scratch your itches like a DJ
I grab her ponytail when she throws that back
And pull it
I'll be all charged up like double D battery [?]
[?] make her yell
Make her yell
Make her scream

Saying every time she's undressed
Feel her request when she says
Don't touch them down
Don't touch them down
Don't touch them down
In the morning she'll require storm
R A H double E M
She can't
She can't live without the radio
Oh no no no
R A H double E M
No she can't live without the radio
R A H double E M
She can't live without the radio
R A H double E M
No she can't live without the radio

My number on my iPhone's her
Request line 2026098668
We call that hip-hop
When I speed it up
In the slow jam
When I slow her down
When it's bedroom time
You know we're right back at it
Wake her up in the morning like a morning [?] show
Wake her up in the morning like an alarm clock on the radio
Wake her up in the morning like she ain't got no place to be
She just wanna lay in bed with me
Get a little more Dundee
And I stretch her body out like [?]

She say don't touch them down
Don't touch them down
Don't touch them down
Don't touch them down
We are laying there undressed
And I'm feeling her request
She say don't touch them down
Don't touch them down
Don't touch them down
Don't touch them down
Make sure I do
Wanna make sure
She can't live
She can't live without the radio
The radio
R A H double E M
She can't
No she can't live without the radio
R A H double E M
She can't live without the radio

Play like the birds outdoor
I play like Di Angelo
I look around her eyes and ask her
How does it feel?
Baby I'm [?]
Such that you're here
She makes me holly
[?] holy girl
I'm bringing tea to her
Fire on desire
Smoking around the center
What is going on?
Tell me tell me tell me
Your head on my pillow
And she can't ever let me go

Cause she can't live without her radio
R A H double E M
She can't live without the radio
R A H double E M
No she can't live without the radio
R A H double E M
She can't live without the radio
