I don't know about my love
I don't know about my love anymore
All that I know is that I'm falling falling falling falling
I don't know about my love
I don't know about my love

A boy-scout from the edge
Standing on the ledge
About to jump
And I feel guilty inside
So behind the smile
Pretended front
Pretended front
When you give me all representative
Could it be I fell in love with my disguise?
And I don't know how to know who I am anymore
Who you are anymore
Who we can be anymore

I don't know about my love
I don't know about my love anymore
All I know, only the words that I'm falling, falling, falling, falling
I don't know about my love
I don't know about my love, no
I don't know about my love anymore
All that I know is that I'm falling, falling, falling, falling
I don't know about my love

The eagle versus pie
How can your best friend take one side?
When it's both ones fault?
My bad and your brain
And I hope that you'll consider that
To let this go and make you better
And hang I'm in
I rather you remember when
I I I I I love you
It's cliché
It's cliché to say
Can we go still be friends?
Counterfeit the both of us [?]
But I don't know who you're really anymore
Who you are anymore
What's it gonna be in the morn

I don't know about my love
All I know
All I know
All I know is ditto
Love anymore
Falling falling falling falling
Not in love
I don't know about my love
My love my love my love
I don't know about my love
No no no no
I don't know
I'm falling yea
I don't know about my love
My love my love my love
My love my love my love
You are my joy and my pain
I am your smile and your teardrops
I guess we're one and the same
Dropped off the cliff to a steep drop
So I kill [?] before down
We don't stop gripping
The love's gone
The love's gone
And I don't know
Who I am anymore
I don't know
I don't know about my love
All I know is
I don't know I don't know
Falling falling falling
I don't know about my love
