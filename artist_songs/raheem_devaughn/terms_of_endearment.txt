It's beautiful like when you heard your first born
Heard your first born cry
Like fireworks in the sky
On the fourth of July
A term of endearment, Cupid hearts and XOs
Memories like prom night and talking all night
Late night on the telephone and phone boning
It's fighting for something, never giving up
Cooking breakfast for your lady
Put a Starbucks in her cup
It's finding that better half
Someone to cry and laugh with
Money can't buy this feeling

[Hook:]
When you find love
And know that it's true
(Find out it's true)
Yeah it'd be nothing you can do about it
Nowhere to live without it
When you find love
You know the search is true
It's some kinda wonderful feeling
Knowing someone loves you

It's dropping to one knee and popping the question
My date on Sunday morning to the church to count blessings
It's jealousy and breaking up
Then making love and making up
It's beautiful like a rainbow in a sky
When it feels so good
It's easy to lose track of time
It's grinding with you husband
Got you back and you got nothing
It's the same one that you [?] with when you're turning into something else

[Hook:]
When you find love
And know that it's true
(Find out it's true)
Yeah it'd be nothing you can do about it
Nowhere to live without it
When you find love
You know the search is true
It's some kinda wonderful feeling
Knowing someone loves you

When someone loves you, it's wonderful
When someone loves you, it's beautiful
When someone loves you, yeah
When someone loves you
When someone loves you, it's beautiful
When someone loves you, it's wonderful
It's wonderful

[Hook:]
When you find love
And know that it's true
(Find out it's true)
Yeah it'd be nothing you can do about it
Nowhere to live without it
When you find love
You know the search is true
It's some kinda wonderful feeling
Knowing someone loves you
