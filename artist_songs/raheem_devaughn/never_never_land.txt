Love king (love king)
Love king forever

I'll never keep you waiting
I'll never betray home
I'll never be ungiving 
I'm never to far gone
Gone
Gone

I never want to quit I never want to fold
I want to be the man that you see me

I never want to be that ear that you can't run to
I want you to trust and confide in me
Come
Baby

Come now girl let's go (come now girl let's go)
Lady take my hand (lady take my hand I'll lead you)
Let me take you to (let me take you to where you'll never want for love)
Never never land (you'll never have to worry about that)

Come now girl let's go (starting right now)
Lady take my hand (lady take my hand yea)
Let me take you to (let me take you too happy)
Never never land (come on let's go baby)

Let me take you to (never never land)
Never never 
Never never land

You'll never be uninvested 
Cause you and I girl we are rich with love

I never felt like we can't make it
Cause there's no obstacles we can't rise above

I rather have a hundred reasons to stay than one to leave
I never want to give you food for thought not to believe

Cause you're my princess we go together
Like prince charming and cinderella
When I'm with you-oo girl I
See-ee your name on valentine

Come now girl let's go (come now let's go)
Lady take my hand (lady take my hand)
Let me take you to (let me take you to let me take you to happy happy happy)
Never never land (see never never never never land you ain't got to worry bout girl)

Come now girl let's go (come come come come come come come)
Lady take my hand (won't you let me take your hand baby)
Let me take you to (too-oo-ooo)
