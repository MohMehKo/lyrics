Cause she was worth it, she was worth it
She was worth it, she was worth it
She was worth it, she was worth it
She was worth it, she was worth it
She was worth it, she was worth it
She was worth it, she was worth it
She was worth it, she was worth it
I'm already on my way back

The keys in the ignition, initiates the mission
Gotta make it reality, I got tired of wishing
I fiend for your affection, there's gonna be some kissing
A powerful erection, I'm warning you, better listen
Heard about so many in the see
I'm longer fishing
Long as I can have you here with me, no more auditions
Closed doors, I'm all yours
Sweat dripping from every pore, all on force
Every inch of your body I'm a explore
Draw a map, draw the G spots and come back
See my plan is making it hard for the next cat
Frustrated from Hen, I already done that
But we both know I'm a habit you can't break
I've foreseen all the love that we can make
But for now I got a new tongue trick to F your head up
Damn I had to jam it for this traffic to let up

Already, already, already...
Already now
