I never said that every choice I made
Everyone was going to like
Never said that satisfying the masses was how I would live my life
And never once did I say all of my decisions would be right
I never said I would ignore my heart and listen with just my mind
Ooh and I know it looks like I've gone crazy
But in the way of love and what it does, I’ll be crazy for us

So call me a fool, call me insane
Tell me that loving you the way I do is ridiculous
I don’t mind, no I don’t mind
Forget the rules I’m over the game
Baby if loving the way you do is ridiculous
Then call me ridiculous, call me ridiculous

Every one knows what I’m 'sposed to do,
Every body says I’m out my mind to feel what I feel for you (feel what I feel for you)
Every body needs to mind their own…
To this love I'm not brand new
See I know when it's real love
Though they think I don’t have a clue
I do
And I know it looks like I've gone crazy
But in the way of love and what it does, I’ll be crazy for us

So call me a fool, call me insane
Tell me the loving you the way I do is ridiculous
I don’t mind, no I don’t mind
Forget the rules I’m over the game
Baby if loving the way you do it’s ridiculous
Then call me ridiculous, call me ridiculous

For seeing something inside you that no one else can see
That’s way they don’t understand me, no
So stupid, idiot, blind to it
Say what they will
Baby that’s what I will
Long as its always real
Ridiculous that’s me
Ooh

So call me a fool, call me insane
Tell me that loving you the way I do is ridiculous
I don’t mind, no I don’t mind
Forget the rules I’m over the game (I retired)
