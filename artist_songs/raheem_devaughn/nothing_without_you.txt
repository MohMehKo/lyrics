I'm nothing without you, mi amore

Like a heaven for an angel
Like a smile for happiness
Like [?] switching angles
Like Church on Sunday morning, feeling blessed
Like joy and jubilee
Like an eagle soaring high in the sky
Like a ruler of a throne
Like a key unlocks a home

What's a man without his Woman? Nothing
What's a sky without its blue? Nothing

[Hook:]
I'm nothing without you
(Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing)
I'm nothing without you
(Without you, without you)
Just nothing without you
(Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing)
Nothing without you
(Without you, without you)
Nothing

Like a mourner without the sun
Like a home without the run
Galaxies without the stars
Jupiter, Earth and Mars
Like cupid without a bow, without an arrow, without a name
Like a groom standing on an alter without a bride to take his name
Like a yacht with no water to sail
Like a wish with no wishing well
What's a ruler without its throne
Without a queen to call it home

What's a man without his Woman? Nothing
What's a sky without its blue? Nothing

[Hook:]
I'm nothing without you
(Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing)
I'm nothing without you
(Without you, without you)
Just nothing without you
(Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing)
Nothing without you
(Without you, without you)
Nothing

Baby there ain't no way that I could even do one day
Without you, I mean nothing without you
Baby there ain't no face that ever could replace your space
Without you, without you
Baby I'd be, I'd be hollow inside
I'd be a lonely knight
I'd be a lonely king of the throne
(Just nothing without you)
I'd be an empty house that's crawling home
A well dressed grown with no [?]
A beating heart with no love inside
I'd be nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
Nothing, without you
Without you
Without you, without you, without you
I'd be...
(Nothing, nothing, nothing)
