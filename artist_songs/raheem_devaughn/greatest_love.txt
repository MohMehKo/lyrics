[Intro: x2]
Like a back board I'll hit it, baby don't stop, get it, get it.
Call me Michael Phelps, wait I'll be swimming in it.
She, she wailing like a siren, louder than my radio.
Light as a feather, hard as a rock.

[Verse 1:]
Our love was made to fill your heart.
My width was made to fill that part of you.
To climb aboard and straddle me.
To taste and touch all of your anatomy.
(Call me Michael Phelps, wait I'll be swimming in it.)

[Chorus:]
Girl tonight, all of your expectations I'll supersede.
Girl tonight, I'm gonna give your body all the love therapy it needs.
Girl tomorrow, you'll reflect and recollect and I'll be on your mind.
Girl, not to be cocky, not to brag, but I'll be the best you ever had.
Welcome to love land!

I'll be your lover, I'll be your king.
I'll be your freaky freak, baby, and all your wet dreams.
Just call me your love king in the bedroom of throne.
And prepare for the greatest love, the best you've ever known.
The best, greatest, the best, the best, best.
Greatest, the best, best, the best.
Greatest, the best, best, the best.
Greatest, the best.

[Verse 2:]
My sex was made to sweat out your weave.
To make your MAC, makeup, smear and run.
You may say that I am an architect,
And call me Mister H2O the way I make it flow.
Let me hydrate you from the sex.

[Chorus reprise:]
Girl tonight, all of your expectations I'll supersede.
Girl tonight, I'm gonna give your body all the love therapy it needs.
Girl tomorrow, you'll reflect and recollect and I'll be on your mind.
And I ain't trying to boast or even brag, but I'm gone be the best you ever had.
Welcome to love land!

I'll be your lover, I'll be your king.
I'll be your freaky freak, baby, and all your wet dreams.
Just call me your love king in the bedroom of throne.
And prepare for the greatest love, the best you've ever known.

[Vamp:]
I ain't boast or bragging my touches, my lovin',
My K-I-S-S-I-N-G, my huggin', the passion, the climax, my stamina,
My foreplay, my big ole ego, my hang time, my round 2
And 3, 4, my night cap, my pillow talk and before I tuck you in.

[x2:]
Like a back board I'll hit it, baby don't stop, get it, get it.
Call me Michael Phelps, wait I'll be swimming in it.
She, she revving like a siren, louder than my radio
Light as a feather, hard as a rock.

Welcome to love land!

[x2:]
I'll be your lover, I'll be your king.
I'll be your freaky freak, baby, and all your wet dreams.
Just call me your love king in the bedroom of throne.
And prepare for the greatest love, the best you've ever known.
