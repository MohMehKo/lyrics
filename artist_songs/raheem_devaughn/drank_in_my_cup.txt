Sex so good, I homicide and suicide it
She call me, she call me
The massage was a cool, but I'd rather get you instead
Cause you're the only queen I want inside this king-size bed
Words of lust come to mind, you in front, me behind
Till you're feeling sticky, till you tell me lick me
Till I make your body know like bascan robbers, veteran scoops
I'll be licking and drinking and sipping
Till I feel your hips outrating like you in some hoola hoops
I'll be licking and drinking and sipping
You'll become my water hose, my sprinkler
Till I make you shoot, off, explode, yeah
Let's get to shaking, we gonn make the bed rock
Cause you intoxicate me, like a peach with the sirrock, no chase up
Then I sure give her that bad, go slower then faster
Then we lift off like NASA, like 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

Now that you're here, the bedroom won't wait you
I can't wait to pop my lips for you (I can't wait to put my lips on you)
I can't wait to taste ya
Like the drank that's in my cup, my cup, my cup, my cup
Let me taste you like the drank that's in my cup, my cup, my cup, my cup
Let me taste you like the drank that's in my cup

All on top like a right cherry, so refreshing like sirock and berry
Like gift unwrapped and we in the nude
And you all melting like ice cubes
And I beat it up like you spawn with it
Lift you up like a bench press
Got you coming all down like a rain fall
With the heart beating all out your chest
And I climb the walls like heemy taught you
Gasp for air like heemy taught you
Let me pull your hair like heemy taught you
Throw them legs in the air like heemy taught you
Hoop and holler like heemy taught you
Come back tomorrow like heemy taught you
Sell up girl like heemy taught you
Tremble girl like heemy taught you
Feel me bang like heemy taught you
On the mirror like heemy taught you
Love me expect like heemy taught you
Tell me babe like heemy taught you
Now let us toast girl, and let your eyes roll back
You're sexy so good, make a nigga wish you could rap

She grab my hand when I make her scream
And I'm dranking her and she can't believe
She nicknaming the hurricane, and I call her missus promethezine
One drank, 2 cups, I lick it once and I double up
And my body stunting like an elevator
So take a guess at who's coming up
The top floor to that basement, a sirock peach I'm tasting
Every drip drop, no wasting, I take it straight, it's no chasing
She loving this tornado, I'm molding like some play dough
She feel like she in heaven, only thing missing's a halo
Perking that mouth like a motherfucking dentist
Going down south and I'm giving er the business
She ain't never have a nigga like this licking in her bed and make her whole bed lean
It could be purple it could pink
Depending on how I lick that thang
So let a nigga pour you in my cup
Girl I wanna taste you like my drank

It could be purple it could pink
Depending on how I lick that thang
It could be purple it could pink
Depending on how I lick that thang
So let a nigga pour you in my cup
Girl I wanna taste you like my drank

Now that you're here,
And the bedroom won't wait you
I can't wait to pop my lips for you
I can't wait to taste ya
Like the drank that's in my cup, my cup, my cup, my cup
Let me taste you like the drank that's in my cup, my cup, my cup, my cup
Let me taste you like the drank that's in my cup, my cup, my cup, my cup
Let me taste you like the drank that's in my cup, my cup, my cup, my cup

Gonna taste you like the drank that's in my cup
Gonna taste you like the drank that's in my cup
Gonna taste you like the drank that's in my cup
Gonna taste you like the drank that's in my cup
