How about you and I make a baby?
How about you and I make a baby?
How about you and I make a baby?
How about you and I make a baby?

I'm ready babe I, it's time
Now that I know your status
You know mine
Well, I'm trying to play the CD close
But tonight, tonight I plan to fertilize
Overstay, tonight will bring your destiny
Tonight will bring forth family
Baby so

How about you and I make a baby?
I want you to love my body
How about you and I make a baby?
How about a baby?
How about you and I make a baby?
Make a baby
How about you and I make a baby?

Just think we've made
A boy with swagger like mine
And to be sure let's go all night
And if it's a girl like her mama, she gonna be so fine
And you're the best sex you've ever had
And I won't be no dead beat dad shoot
Tonight we even might make 2
Twenty-two
Tonight I thank my majesty
For blessing me with you

How about you and I make a baby?
I want you to love my body
How about you and I make a baby?
How about a baby?
How about you and I make a baby?
I said about you baby
How about you and I make a baby?
Make a baby

I wanna love your body
I wanna love your feet
I wanna feed you all night long
F in the morning
And when you have the wildest craving
I'm ready, I want you down baby

How about you and I make a baby?
How about you and I make a baby?
How about you and I make a baby?
Oh yeah, yeah
How about you and I make a baby?
Tell me baby

If it's a boy with swagger like mine
It's a girl like her mama, she gonna be so fine
Say you're ready to make a baby
How about you and I make a baby?
Say that you're ready
How about you and I make a baby?
