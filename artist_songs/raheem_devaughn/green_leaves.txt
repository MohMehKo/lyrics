[Intro: spoken]
Life
Life is about evolving and growing
Elevating
Constant growth
Like green leaves
I dedicate this to the children

[Verse 1]
Mama told me a wise man leads and never takes orders to follow
And what's done right here in the here and now, always affects tomorrow
It's like, cause and effect, simple mathematics like 1 plus 1 makes 2
See the bed that we make, that's where we got to lay, so be wise of the path we choose
And keep growing

[Chorus]
Keep growing (Keep on growing, yeah)
Keep growing (Oh, keep growing, growing)
Keep growing (Keep on growing, keep on growing)
Keep growing (Like)
Like green leaves

[Verse 2]
To have it you got to see it, to talk it you got to be it
There's no ifs, no ands or buts
If you claim it you can attain it, what was made shall be, and that's the law of the universe
(That's the universal law)
Shine a light, use insight and remember your precious gift
Take the good with the bad, the tears with the laughs and always be positive
And keep growing

[Chorus: x2 + adlib over second chorus]
Keep growing (Oh, keep growing)
Keep growing (Keep on keepin on)
Keep growing (Keep on growing)
Keep growing
Like green leaves (Keep on growing like green leaves)
