Sweaty palms, juicy lips, curbs and hips
Yeah I wanna raise your eye brows
Your body's awfully hot, with nothing on
Hey I wanna perform for you
Let's get it on, on
Imagine the sounds of sweet love
I wanna make you feel, joy,
Love, to this love game
My sweet love

My lips will tickle when
I begin to kiss those unfamiliar places
Hold me tight, breathe real slow
Catch your breath
Yeah I wanna raise your eye brows
And whisper in your ear
And I wanna play some slow songs
And I'm gonna use my stamina
And if it turns you on
You're gonna feel somebody butterflies
And if I outdo myself
The pleasure just can't imagine that
Your joy sign,
The pleasure of the noise we'll make
Sounds like love

Sweet sounds of love, love
Joy, joy, beautiful, to the old school sounds

Beautiful sounds, of love
