[phone ringing]

I was hoo-oo-oo hoping you would answer
Maybe hoo-oo-oo hoping you would call
Maybe one shot too many got me wishful thinking 
Reminiscing on the love we had

I know that its late 
And I don't wanna disrespect your situation but
Hol' up baby wait 
I gotta get this up off of my chest

There's something you should know 
Baby you're a tough act to follow
And when I'm all alone and I'm staring at the walls
In the back of my mind I hear my conscious call

I miss you hear 
And you undress
And the excitement of your heart beating out your chest
The way we lay it down
And everything that comes next
I miss your touch, I miss your kiss, I miss your sex

I miss you hear
And your nastiness
I miss the wetness of our bodies when we sweat
When you pull me in 
And everything that comes next
I miss your fill, I miss the thrill, I miss your

I miss your
I miss your

S-e-x baby I miss your sex [x4]

I miss creeping your thighs the look in your eyes
Baby when you release it
And there I go there I go unto the rim releasing all the love we had

Baby are you still on the line
Can I get it one mo' time
Can I hit it hit it one mo' time
Taste it one mo' time
Don't make me contain it 

I miss you hear 
And you undress
And the excitement of your heart beating out your chest
The way we lay it down
And everything that comes next
I miss your touch, I miss your kiss, I miss your sex

I miss you hear
And your nastiness
I miss the wetness of our bodies when we sweat
When you pull me in 
And everything that comes next
I miss your fill, I miss the thrill, I miss your

I miss your
I miss your

S-e-x baby I miss your sex [x4]

This ain't bout what I can't have
This is only bout what I want
This is only bout what I need
I need you next to me

And I know its kinda crazy how we strayed away 
Used to miss the love we had
I'm going through withdrawals
Said I miss you bad

I miss you hear 
And you undress
And the excitement of your heart beating out your chest
The way we lay it down
And everything that comes next
I miss your touch, I miss your kiss, I miss your sex

I miss you hear
And your nastiness
I miss the wetness of our bodies when we sweat
When you pull me in 
And everything that comes next
I miss your fill, I miss the thrill, I miss your

I miss your
I miss your

S-e-x baby I miss your sex [x4]
