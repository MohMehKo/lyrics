Listen, I mean every word of this baby
Wow!

Babe! Babe!
I'm sorry
Then my eyes couldn't see that your heart wasn't be all my lovin'
Uhh, baby baby baby, yeah, I disagree
When you say I didn't leave and fought you this beat, now love's late, oh yeah

[Chorus:]
Now you keep on asking me what you should do
In the meantime, (in the meantime)
In between time, (in between time)
In the meantime, (in the meantime)
In between time, (in between time), yeah

Baby, what am I supposed to do now
'Cause the truth is I can't leave just as fact as you want me to come around
If I was to leave don't let me go around.
Baby, please, please, please, don't let me understand
That everything happen for a reason
But don't change like the seasons
And take away all your love.

[Chorus: x2]
Now you keep on asking me
What should you do?
In the meantime, (in the meantime)
In between time, (in between time)
In the meantime, (in the meantime)
In between time, (in between time), yeah

Here's what I want you to do,
Wait for me!
Hoe don't keep your panties on and wait
That's what I want you to do
Wait for me! Like a ped lock, keep it tight from m, wait for me, uh yeah!

I love you, I really do
I just need you to wait
Wait one minute, one second
In the meantime, (in the meantime)

Now you keep on asking me
What should you do?
Now you keep on asking me
What should you do?
