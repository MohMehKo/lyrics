[Intro:]
Bliss, magnificent, orgasmic,
Love can be all these things!
Fear, timeless, complicated

They say that we make a good couple
But I'm too afraid to mess up what'special
We do what lovers do, we are not obligated that's what makes it cool
How we know it's true.
All the way she can tell from the surface
I won't never hurt them on purpose
Cause she don't deserve it, and I think she's perfect
But there's a chance things will change if she knows this, oh

[Hook:]
I'm kinda single, but I'm in love
It's complicated because, because
(Lately don't mind)
I'm being patient, can't say we're dating
I can't explain it, it's complicated, girl!
It's complicated, so complicated
I can't explain it, it's complicated, girl!
I'm being patient, can't say we're dating
I can't explain it, it's complicated, yeah

Our friendship's too good,
To damage it if we advanced it
I don't think we can handle it!
And that's how I feel! I could be wrong
But me speaking from experience, I know
Sometimes I get confused, trying to handle it
Going through emotion, when I'm not emotionless
I'd rather be here for her to lean on
Then to be mad at me, cause I let this go
It's complicated!

[Hook:]
I'm kinda single, but I'm in love
It's complicated because, because
I'm being patient, can't say we're dating
I can't explain it (the situation is this complicated cause)
It's complicated, so complicated (oh, like a puzzle, baby)
I can't explain it but I'm being patient
It's complicated, so complicated
I can't explain it, it's complicated, girl!
I'm being patient, can't say we're dating
I can't explain it, it's complicated, yeah!

So cold, can't change
This friendship, our bonds will remain
Call it what you want, but I know what it is
Com-Pli-Cated
My Best friend my buddy, I trust in her only
Has good intentions for me!
Call what you want, but I know what it is
Com -Pli -Cated

[Hook: x2]
I'm kinda single, but I'm in love
It's complicated because, because
I'm being patient, can't say we're dating
I can't explain it, it's complicated
It's complicated, so complicated
I can't explain it but I'm being patient
It's complicated, so complicated
I can't explain it, it's complicated, girl!
I'm being patient, can't say we're dating
I can't explain it, it's complicated, yeah!
