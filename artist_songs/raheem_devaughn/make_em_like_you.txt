No, no they don't
Make'em like you, you no mo
Don't make'em like you no mo
They don't
Make'em like you, you anymore

A work of art like Picasso's
Someone like an angel with a halo
Loyal like my alibi
If you had to testify
Love you with no make up on
In the morning time you still fly
Your body curve like an hourglass
With all the natural ingredients
Ancient as a two dollar bill, you are
You priceless like my 64 Chevy, you are
An ex girlfriend's worsts nightmare
You make me the envy of those haters when I'm witcha
Like priceless in words
Heaven on earth, top of the world
Feel me on it
See take me to your mama and your daddy
So I can say thank you
Cause I just want their blessings
And baby for what it's worth
Know that I'm always gonna treat you
Like a lady

Cause they don't make them no no
They don't make'em like you no mo
I swear they don't make'em like you anymore
No no, no they don't
They don't make'em like
Make'em like you anymore

Like a love without filters or reverse
Like a line in the Biggy Smalls verse, Unbelievable
Like your skinless soft and smooth like leather
I wanna tie the knot like laces tight together
You got kiss like a sugar rush
Sex drive like caffeine
That's poker like royal flush
That makes you my love queen
Like price isn't worth heaven on earth
Top of the world
See take me to your mama and your daddy
So I can say thank you
Cause I just want their blessings
And baby for what it's worth
Know that I'm always gonna treat you
Like a lady

Cause they don't make them no no
They don't make'em like you
No no, no they don't
They don't make'em
Make'em like you no mo
They don't make'em like you
Make'em like you no more
I swear, I swear
They don't, they don't
Make'em like, make'em like
You anymore
I wanna tell the world
I wanna testify, I swear
Yo're one of a kind baby
Yeah, yeah you anymore
