Mama, I need a ride, yeah
Somewhere like that
Would you mind?
Would you mind? Sing

I was on I-95 on my way to Mickey D's
When my back right tire went flat
That's when this sexy little thing with a pearl tongue ring
Jumped out of a black Cadillac

Now she had a hourglass figure, no sign of a man
And all she said when she offered a ride was
Hey baby listen, you can ride on one condition
Act right when you get inside

She said if you want to ride in my Cadillac
You gotta know how to act, when to jump in the back
You gotta touch me like you wanna be touched
Like it ain't too much for you

She said if you want to ride in my Cadillac
You gotta know how to act, when to jump in the back
You gotta touch me like you wanna be touched
Like it ain't too much for you, babe

Now when I jumped in that's when she begin
Rubbin' and a touchin' on me
Then she stopped the car, told me to drive
'Cause she had a little trick from me to see

So I followed her directions to turn where she said
Not worryin' 'bout where we supposed to be
And as I got closer, all I heard was the words
And the hands and she said to me, see

She said if you want to ride in my Cadillac
You gotta know how to act, when to jump in the back
You gotta touch me like you wanna be touched
Like it ain't too much for you

She said if you want to ride in my Cadillac
You gotta know how to act, when to jump in the back
You gotta touch me like you wanna be touched
Like it ain't too much for you

She said if you want to ride in my Cadillac
You gotta know how to act, when to jump in the back
You gotta touch me like you wanna be touched
Like it ain't too much for you

She said if you want to ride in my Cadillac
You gotta know how to act, when to jump in the back
You gotta touch me like you wanna be touched
Like it ain't too much for you, baby

I'm from the Webber District
Have you been there before?
Come on let's go I'll take you
And leave you sprung for more

She said if you want to ride in my Cadillac
You gotta know how to act, when to jump in the back
You gotta touch me like you wanna be touched
Like it ain't too much for you

She said if you want to ride in my Cadillac
You gotta know how to act, when to jump in the back
You gotta touch me like you wanna be touched
Like it ain't too much for you
