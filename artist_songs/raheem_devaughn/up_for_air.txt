Up for air...love king.... love king forever

A....
A... if I ask if you would sit that ass up on me 
B...could you be my wonderful, my tenderoni
C...i just wanna climb inside you and crush you
D... let the deep diver go deep, yeah
E... My eeerotic ecstasy
F... u-c-k-i-n-g 
When I lick that honeycomb, you be goin ham
Flowing like Niagara Falls when I break yo dam
Alrighty 

[Chorus 1:]
When I'm kissing and stroking
When your sesame's open
When I'm down on your love
I won't come up for air

Til you're screaming Jesus name in vain
Keep it there for me
L-O-V-I-N-G
Mercy, no oooh ohhhh
Now say that poonani belong to me
I'm gon treat you like my Q-U-double E-N
And I'm gon stay on ready til your body say when
Sex you up til you tick tick tick tick boom
Til you up up up on top
Til Victoria is showing me all of your Secrets 

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2:]
When you're hollering and screaming 
Arch your back and then I lean in
When I'm down on your love
I won't come up for air
Baby

Til we're leaning off the bed
You break your nails and hit your head on the headboard 
When I'm down yonder on your love
I won't come up for air 
Til you feel me up your dress, feel me down your spine
Til you say its TKO, til its tapout time
I wont baby, no..no...
I wont come up for air 

W is for all the work that I'm gon put in
X is for x-rated, so nasty when you take it
Y is for the way that you never tell me no
And Z is for the way you love me like an animal
Like lions and tigers and bears
We be at it like
We be mating like the birds and bees
We be at it like 
Suffocating in your love
And I don't come up for air

[Chorus 1 & 2]
