Confucius says: touch, touch yourself right now
Uh baby
Uh baby baby baby

You make me wanna leave all them rapper hits alone
How does it feel that I'm singing your favourite love song?
Uh, I wanna sweep you off our feet every time, every time
So maybe tonight you can be mine

I'm tryin to make your toes curl
It's the mental to the touch
Baby I can't get enough,
I'm tryin to make your toes curl
I cares you with my words, girl I'm back to serve you up
I'm tryin to make your toes curl,
Can I make you toes curl?
Wanna make your toes curl.

Tell all your friends that you got a man baby girl
So me and you together forever, we can change the world
Won't all be the solutions to your problems,
Call me when you need me, I'll be there for you, you gotta believe me
You got some trust lead, you're so great for me
Like I'll do it for you, do it faithfully,
When times get harder love you'll take from me
We'll fight together baby we're a team
Now take this love, put it on all.

I'm tryin to make your toes curl
It's the mental to the touch
Baby I can't get enough,
I'm tryin to make your toes curl
I cares you with my words, girl I'm back to serve you up
I'm tryin to make your toes curl,
Can I make you toes curl?
Wanna make your toes curl.

Now take that off, so I could turn you on
Come over here, listen to me

Imagine waking up to the sunrise,
Where any day everything's alright,
Yeah I can you make your toes curl, in between my sheets
In my bed bed bed bed bed all night

I'm tryin to make your toes curl
It's the mental to the touch
Baby I can't get enough,
I'm tryin to make your toes curl
I cares you with my words, girl I'm back to serve you up
I'm tryin to make your toes curl,
Can I make you toes curl?
Wanna make your toes curl.

I'm tryin to make your toes curl
It's the mental to the touch
Baby I can't get enough,
I'm tryin to make your toes curl
I cares you with my words, girl I'm back to serve you up
I'm tryin to make your toes curl,
Can I make you toes curl?
Wanna make your toes curl.
