[VERSE 1:]
Desire... where are you when I need you most?
Can't you tell the way I long for you?
I think it's unfairly wrong of you teasing me like you do baby.
Could it be you do it just for fun, when you know I am the only one?
Cause you know you are the only one I...

[CHORUS:]
Desire (oooh you make me)
Desire (in the morning I)
Desire (you baby)
Desire (make me desire you, you, you, you)

[VERSE 2:]
Desire... please tell me why must you make me beg?
Desire please stop running through my head.
Is it that you love to play cat and mouse?
Give me a clue what to do, help me out.
Perhaps I'm your subject or just your muse.
It feels so damn good to be used, when you know I am the only one.

[CHORUS:]
Desire (ooohh I desire you)
Desire (I can't help the way I desire you)
Desire (ohhhhhhhhh)
Desire (I can't sleep at night... at night)
Desire (I wanna... I wanna touch you with...)
Desire (desire you)
Desire (passionately with desire)
Desire (I wanna kiss you with every...)

Every... every part of me wants every part of you (yeah). I desire you.
I... desire you (I desire you) I... de-sire you.
I... desire you (if there ever was a time baby) I... de-sire you (desire you - I would say the time is now).
I... desire you (come to me oohhh) I... desire you (it's urgent... can't you, can't you hear it in my voice how I desire you).

["Desire" repeated with ad libs]

Don't take too long.
Don't take too long.
Please come to me.
I want you.
