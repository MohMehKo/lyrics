She was a dusking girl with a Caesar
Over by the bar sipping on a margarita
If life was a song yea she would be my feature
Hanging all night long until we break to sweet love
If anything I do got to get you 'nother one
James planning on: oh mommy you fancy ah
So bad that you could've been a sin
Now bad meaning bad
Bad meaning that the girl with me who will

Oh Shorty, I really want to know your name
And you're not drawn so you're no game
I'm for real baby
Girl you took my breath away
You made me speechless
I've seen that you do it
Doing your thing
Got a shadow on deck
Flyest thing I ever red
Smile like yes
Flipping all the other rest
But it seem like I'm rocking with the best
Got me feeling like I'm rocking with the best
With your body so tight
True day me
Face like that girl you need to be with me
Got me feeling like I'm rocking with the best
Got me feeling like I'm rocking with the best

So can I kick it?
Yes you can
Can I kick it?
Yes you can
Can we kick it?
Yes we can
Oh oh oh oh
Can I kick it?
Yes you can
Can I kick it?
Yes you can
Can we kick it?
Yes we can
Oh oh oh oh

So baby girl what it is?
I don't think you need a warrant
Come on back to the crib
Wake up to wherever want it
Got me anticipating
Every time I'll be taking
With on the low we'll be making
Yea I know they be hating
Because you look so so so good
Yea you got me on a high
Still you keeping so so so hood
That I need you in my life

Oh Shorty, I really want to know your name
And you're not drawn so you're no game
I'm for real baby
Girl you took my breath away
You make me speechless
The thing that you do it
Doing your thing
Got a shadow on deck
Flyest thing I ever red
Smile like yes
Flipping all the other rest
But it seem like I'm rocking with the best
Got me feeling like I'm rocking with the best
With your body so tight
True day me
Face like that girl you need to be with me
Feeling like I'm rocking with the best
Got me feeling like I'm rocking with the best
