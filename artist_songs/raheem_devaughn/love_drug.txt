[Intro: Talking]
I'm a lovaholic for you.
Plus the fact that my love is.
My love is dope.
You got me hooked.
I got you sprung.
Now add that up.
And you're my Love Drug.
I'm your Love Drug.
You're what I need.
And I'm your pusher man.

[Verse:]
You appear as though you're from Columbia.
You keeps it tight for me like Ziplocs.
And I get sky high when we lip lock.
And you get sky high when we lip lock.
So you search for me with a flashlight, in the daylight.
'Cause I'm your get right.
See no one serves you up girl like I can.
I'm your Mr. Midnight pusher man.

[Chorus:[
I'm your drug. (Ooh I'm your drug, yeah)
And you can't kick it. (You can't kick it)
You gotta have it, yeah.
'Cause you're so addicted. (I got you hooked, got you sprung, got you open.)

[Verse:]
See my urge gets fulfilled when you come through.
I love every little bit of ounce of you.
See you're back for more and I'm reeing up.
You're floating now; that's that good stuff.
And that's all day. (I'm stoned, she's stoned)
And all night. (We bang, we bone)
Now hurry back soon when I'm in demand.
'Cause I'm your pusher man.
