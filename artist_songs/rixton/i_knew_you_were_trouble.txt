Trouble, trouble, trouble

Once upon a time
A few late nights ago
You were in my sights
I got you alone
I found you, yeah, oh I found you

You thought I didn't care
You said I'd never change
Made so many plans I had to rearrange
Around you, oh around and around and around you, oh

Now I'm long gone
It was hard to see
Now I realize you've fallin' for me

But you knew I was trouble when I walked in
So shame on you
For makin' up these rumors that I never did
And tryin' to put me down
Oh, you knew I was trouble when I walked in
So shame on you
For fakin' all these tears that you never shed
It's time to get up off the cold hard ground

Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble, oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble (yeah)

Won't apologize
I've never seen you cry
And even if you did no, I'm not the reason why
Drowning, oh you're drowning (drowning) drowning (drowning)
I had to walk away
I guess that's how it goes
Watch the curtain fall 'cause you're puttin' on a show
Without me, without me, without me oh

Now I'm long gone
It was hard to see
Now I realize
The joke is on me

But you knew I was trouble when I walked in
So shame on you
For makin' up these rumors that I never did
And tryin' to put me down
Oh, you knew I was trouble when I walked in
So shame on you
For fakin' all those tears that you never shed
It's time to get up off the cold hard ground

Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble, oh (baby), oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

Trouble, troublemaker
Yeah that's your middle name
Playin' the victim I suspect that you created the game
There was only one direction
And you've gone the wrong way
You can say what you want but don't you dare say I've changed
And worst of all
You take everything I say so personal
I never meant it that way
With your heart on your sleeve and your mind on forever
Girl, we are never, ever, ever...

You knew I was trouble when I walked in (oh)
You knew I was trouble when I walked in (ohhhhhh)
You knew I was trouble when I walked in
Shame on you
For makin' up these rumors that I never did
It's time to get up off the cold hard ground

Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble, oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
