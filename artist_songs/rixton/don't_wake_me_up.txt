Too much light in this window, don't wake me up
Only coffee no sugar, inside my cup
If I wake and you're here still, give me a kiss
I was in this dreaming, about your lips

Don't wake me up, up, up, up up, up
Don't wake me up, up, up, up up, up
Don't wake me up, up, up, up up, up
Don't wake me up
Don't wake me

Don't wake me up, yeah
Don't wake me up, yeah

So much life in the city, you won't believe, ooh
Been awake for some days now, no time to sleep
If your heart is a pillow, this love's the bed, yeah
Tell me what is the music, inside my head

Don't wake me up, up, up, up up, up
Don't wake me up, up, up, up up, up
Don't wake me up, up, up, up up, up
Don't wake me up, baby

Don't wake me up, yeah
Don't wake me up
Don't wake me up, yeah
Don't wake me up, up, up, up up, up
Don't wake me up
Don't wake me, oh!

I don't wanna fall, fall, fall, fall asleep no
I don't wanna fall unless I'm falling for you

I don't wanna fall, fall, fall, fall asleep no
I don't wanna fall unless I'm falling for you

I don't wanna fall (no, I don't wanna fall, baby), fall, fall, fall asleep no
I don't wanna fall (unless I'm falling for you) unless I'm falling for you

I don't wanna fall (I don't wanna fall, baby), fall, fall, fall asleep no
Fall asleep no, oh!

Don't wake me up
Don't wake me up, uuh! Yeah!

Too much light in this window, don't wake me
