I like girls oh they always look so good to me
I like girls even though they tease and torture me,
I like girls but I can never choose just one,
That would ruin all the fun oh waho I like girls
Bababum
Oh oh waho I like girls.

I like girls in the summer
Girls in the fall
Girls all year I wish I could have them all

Girls from other countries with crazy names,
I love it when they tell me papi, no engles
Oh wahoh waho oh
Come a little closer
Oh waho waho oh

I like girls oh they always look so good to me
I like girls even though they tease and torture me,
I like girls but I can never choose just one,
That would ruin all the fun oh waho I like girls
Bababum
Oh oh waho I like girls.

I like girls all colours
I ain't got a type
Girls who drink bud not Smirnoff ice
Girls with big booties
Girls in tight jeans
Girls who wanna lay around and watch TV

Oh waho waho oh
Come a little closer
Oh waho waho oh

I like girls oh they always look so good to me
I like girls even though they tease and torture me,
I like girls but I can never choose just one,
That would ruin all the fun oh waho I like girls
Bababum
Oh oh waho I like girls.

I like girls oh they always look so good to me
I like girls even though they tease and torture me,
I like girls but I can never choose just one,
That would ruin all the fun oh waho I like girls
Bababum
Oh oh waho I like girls.
Bababum
Oh oh waahoh I like girls.
