No, I'm not tryin' to be rude
But hey pretty girl, I'm feelin you
The way you do, the things you do
Remind me of my Lexus coup
That's why I'm all up in you grill
Tryin' get you to a hotel
You must be a football coach
The way you got me playin' the field

So baby gimme that "toot toot"
And gimme that "beep beep"
Oh yeah, we're runnin' the show
Bouncin on 24's
While they say on the radio

It's the remix to ignition
Hot and fresh out the kitchen
Mama, rollin' that body
Got every man in her wishin'
I’m sippin' on coke and rum
I'm like so what I'm drunk
It's the freakin' weekend baby
I'm about to have me some fun

Bounce, Bounce, Bounce, 
Bounce, Bounce, Bounce, Bounce
Bounce, Bounce, Bounce

Ooh! Now, it's like, murder she wrote
Once I get you out them clothes
Privacy is on the door
Still they can hear you screamin' more
Girl I'm feelin' what you feelin'
No more hopin' and wishin'
I'm 'bout to take my key and
Stick it in the ignition

So gimme that "toot toot"
And gimme that "beep beep"
Oh yeah, we're runnin' the show
Bouncin' on 24's
While they say on the radio (aah!)

It’s the remix to ignition
Hot and fresh out the kitchen
Mama rollin' that body
Got every man in her wishin'
I’m sippin' on coke and rum
I'm like so what I'm drunk
It's the freakin' weekend baby
I'm about to have me some fun

Crystal poppin' in the stretch Navigator
We got food everywhere
As if the party was catored
We got fellas to my left
Hunnies on my right
We bring 'em both together we got drinkin' all night
Then after the show it's the (after party)
And after the party it's the (hotel lobby)
And 'round about 4 you gotta (clear the lobby)
Then head take it to the room and "shh" somebody

Can I get a "toot toot"
Oh, can I get a "beep beep"
Oh yeah, we're runnin' the show
Bouncin' on 24's

It's the remix to ignition

Sippin' on coke and rum
