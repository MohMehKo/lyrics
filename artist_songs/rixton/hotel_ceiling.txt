I can see it coming round full circle my friend.
On the TV they said they had reported you dead.
It was my fault 'cause I could've sworn that you said,
It was easy to find another for your bed.

How does it feel to leave me this way,
When all that you have's been lost in a day?
Everyone knows, but not what to say.
I've been wonderin' now.

I've been staring at the hotel ceiling,
Drinking everything I've found this evening,
Trying to hold onto the sweetest feeling,
So I'll never let you go, don't you leave me lonely.
Start to see this, everyone I know cannot believe this.
Trying to hold onto the sweetest feeling,
So I'll never let you go, don't you leave me lonely now.

When my eyes open, morning pulls me into the view, no
I guess I'm only acting in the way that you do.
Just being alone, no.
Only time tells me more than I hoped, all that I know is
I'll be fine in a fortnight, lo and behold,
I knew I shouldn't have let you go.

I've been staring at the hotel ceiling,
Drinking everything I've found this evening,
Trying to hold onto the sweetest feeling,
So I'll never let you go, don't you leave me lonely.
Start to see this, everyone I know cannot believe this.
Trying to hold onto the sweetest feeling,
So I'll never let you go, don't you leave me lonely now.

I can see it coming round full circle, my friend.
On the TV they said they had reported you dead.
