Whole [x4]

When you wake up and you find that I'm not there, cry for me.

Put on your makeup
And just let down your hair,
Don't lose sleep.

I know you said we're fine, but I'm not sold.
You try to take two halfs to make them whole.

And make them whole.
And make them whole.
And make them whole
And make them whole.

And make them whole.
Make them whole
Make them whole
Oh ohh

When I wake up
And I reach across the bed,
You're not there.

Tried to save us,
But no one ever said
Love was fair.

I know you said we're fine but I'm not sold.
You try to take two halfs to make them whole.

And make them whole.
And make them whole.
And make them whole.
And make them whole.

Although you say you're fine but I'm not here to say goodbye,
I'm sick of wastin' all this time when we both know.

Yeah

Life can move so fast I know we run in different paths but can we try to take two halfs to make them whole.

And make them whole.
And make them whole.
And make them whole.
