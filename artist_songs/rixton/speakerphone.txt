Put me on speakerphone,
I know you're not alone,
Enough is enough,
I only call when I'm drunk.
Got my heart on my sleeve again,
I played your silly games,
Enough is enough,
I only call when I'm drunk.

Baby, it's me again,
Calling my only friend,
You do remember me, don't you?
You're falling in love again,
I could try to pretend that I don't think about you.
I go out every night,
I'm finding it hard to let you go.
You left me behind, we said our goodbyes,
Now I need you to pick up, pick up, baby

So put me on speakerphone,
I know you're not alone,
Enough is enough,
I only call when I'm drunk.
Got my heart on my sleeve again,
I played your silly games,
Enough is enough,
I only call when I'm drunk.

And I know better than to call back again
I lose all self-control
And I know better than to call back again
Pick up, pick up, baby
I only call when I'm drunk.

The sun brings another day,
Slurring my words away,
So many things that I never said,
It's breaking my heart when I pick up the phone again,

But I gotta explain that,
I go out every night
I'm finding it hard to let you go.
You left me behind, we said our goodbyes,

Now I need you to pick up, pick up
(Pick up, pick up)

So put me on speakerphone,
I know you're not alone,
Enough is enough,
I only call when I'm drunk.
Got my heart on my sleeve again,
I played your silly games,
Enough is enough,
I only call when I'm drunk.

And I know better than to call back again
I lose all self-control
And I know better than to call back again
Pick up, pick up, baby
I only call when I'm drunk

Pick up, pick up,
(Pick up, pick up)
Pick up, pick up, baby
(Pick up, pick up, baby)
Pick up, pick up,
(Pick up, pick up)
Pick up, pick up, baby

So put me on speakerphone,
I know you're not alone,
Enough is enough,
I only call when I'm drunk.
Got my heart on my sleeve again,
I played your silly games,
Enough is enough,
I only call when I'm drunk.

And I know better than to call back again
I lose all self-control
And I know better than to call back again
Pick up, pick up, baby
I only call when I'm drunk
