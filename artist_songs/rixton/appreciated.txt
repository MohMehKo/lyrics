Why don't you wait here while I borrow
Something you said, dear you should follow
Ohhh Ohhh
If they just stay age til' tomorrow
Then that's okay
Hate's only sorrow
Ohhh Ohhh

Cause it's you, who, takes care of everyone else
You, need to allow me to help, you
Ohh, appreciated
Cause it's you who somehow is always the first, to, take care of me at my worst
You are appreciated

It's just today, hey there's tomorrow
All things will change, hey that's the motto
Ohhh Ohhh

When you're down be down
When you're up be up
I will pull you up
Cause without a doubt
The tables turn around, you pick me off the ground

Cause it's you, who, takes care of everyone else
You, need to allow me to help
You are appreciated
Cause it's you who somehow is always the first, to, take care of me at my worst
You are appreciated

Woah, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Woah, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Woah, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Cause it's you, who, takes care of everyone else
You, need to allow me to help
You are appreciated
Cause it's you, who, takes care of everyone else
You, need to allow me to help
You are appreciated

Cause it's you, who, somehow is always the first, to, take care of me at my worst
You are appreciated
