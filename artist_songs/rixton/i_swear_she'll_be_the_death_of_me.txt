Some nights I wish I can't remember
Some nights I wish I could forget
The kind of wound that never heals
Is it better left unsaid?

And now she's calling up my phone again
She's at my door again
I tried so hard but can't pretend
I swear she'll be the death of me

And like a phoenix from the ashes
She burns as she crashes
And then returns with a passion
And God, I swear she'll be the death of me

After all that you've done
I'm just a fool still in love with you
And if you asked me to jump
I'll jump as high as you want me to

I hang on every word you say
And when you look at me that way
You know you're fine
I'm just a fool still in love with you

I remember her confession
Like it was yesterday
The way that she lied through blurry eyes
I'm hypnotized
It's hard to walk away

And now she's calling up my phone again
She's at my door again
I tried so hard but can't pretend
I swear she'll be the death of me

And like a phoenix from the ashes
She burns as she crashes
And then returns with a passion
And God, I swear she'll be the death of me

After all that you've done
I'm just a fool still in love with you
And if you asked me to jump
I'll jump as high as you want me to

I hang on every word you say
And when you look at me that way
You know you're fine
I'm just a fool still in love with you
