Oo-ooh, baby, oh!

Oh that dress so scandalous
And you know another brother couldn't handle it
See you shaking that thing like who's da ish
Look in your eye so devilish ah
Ya like to dance at all the hip-hop spots
Then you cruise through the crews like connect the dots

Thighs like what? What? What?
Baby, move your butt, butt, butt
