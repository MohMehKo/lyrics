I was aiming for the sky
But then I crashed down low, low
I made you think that things were fine
But in my head I was hurtful

I was blind, all the light
Makes me lose control
But this time, you and I
No, we won't let go

You make me fly like a superman
So take me high like I know you can
Its only you who makes me feel like that
Now I’m taking off, never look back.
Fly like a superman,
So take me high like I know you can
It’s only you who makes me feel like that,
Now I’m taking off, never look back

See, I was stepping out of line
Always waiting for the right time
To bring these shadows alive,
I gotta make these wrongs right

I was blind, all the light
Makes me lose control
But this time, you and I
No, We won’t let go

You make me fly like a superman
So take me high like I know you can
Its only you who makes me feel like that
Now I’m taking off, never look back.
Fly like a superman,
So take me high like I know you can
It’s only you who makes me feel like that,
Now I’m taking off, never look back.

Because I never felt so strong
As when I’m being close to you
Girl you’re all I want,
I’m doing it all for you

You make me fly like a superman
So take me high like I know you can
Its only you who makes me feel like that
Now I’m taking off.
Fly like a superman,
So take me high like I know you can
It’s only you who makes me feel like that,
So now I’m taking off, never look back
Taking off, never look back.
