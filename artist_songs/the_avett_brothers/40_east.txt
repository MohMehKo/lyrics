Sleep darling rest your mind
I'll drive all night to get to you
Please moan softly if you must moan at all
I'm moving through the night toward you

Sleep darling, sleep darling
I'm on my way to you
I'm on my way to you

Rest my angel, not one word,
Between you and I on the telephone line
You are weary and need your sleep
So leave the hard thinking and the driving to me

Sleep darling, sleep darling
I'm on my way to you
I'm on my way to you
Let go
