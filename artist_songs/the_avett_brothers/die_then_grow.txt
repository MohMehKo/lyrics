Can you say your name to me, put mine after yours?
Can we build a house of glass without windows or doors?
Will you learn to love yourself the way I know you should?
Will we find the courage there to call our friendship good?
Call it good, call it good

The world is closing in on me, I think it's time I go
And with your sad young eyes you've taught me things I didn't know
And my heart broke down to powder there and I wish I'd let it show
And I listened as you said to me you'd rather die than grow
Die than grow, die than grow

Anita, my Anita, I was born to follow you
Anita, my Anita, I was born to follow you
Don't let romance and beating hearts change what we came to do
Anita, my Anita, I was born to follow you

So I watched as those who ask for love, demanding some respect
Became the last in line to have what they come to expect
As what nobody taught them that they so rightly deserve
And the hums of their misfortune peaked, the hardest lesson learned
Lesson learned, lesson learned

Anita, my Anita, I was born to follow you
Anita, my Anita, I was born to follow you
Don't let romance and beating hearts change what we came to do
Anita, my Anita, I was born to follow you

To watch us fall is why they came
And fall we did, to the call of the highway
Don't go home, don't look ahead, don't look behind
Everything we were is dead

Then a well of hope and talent sprang, and I caught a glimpse of light
And I drank from there as the colors rang out loudly from your eyes

Anita, my Anita, I was born to follow you
Don't let romance or beating hearts change what we came to do

Anita, my Anita, I was born to follow you
Anita, my Anita, I was born to follow you

Die then grow
Die then grow
Die then grow
Die then grow
