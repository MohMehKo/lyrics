Well bring me something new that I haven't felt before 
Like messages of love and directions to your door 
But please talk slowly, I don't hear good anymore 
And we all fall down 
And we all fall down 

Don't die on me lady, only good things can come 
To those who practice reason and recognize good fun 
Your absence is the bullet and the past is your gun 
And we all fall down 
And we all fall down 

She still doesn't answer though she knows shes done wrong 
We buried the memories along with the songs 
When she wakes up, I hope that we are gone 
And we all fall down 
And we all fall down 

There's a visitor in black at my neighbors house 
My neighbor says tomorrow the visitor says now 
When he comes here please tell him that I'm out 
And we all fall down 
And we all fall down
