Well I've been lockin' myself up in my house for sometime now
Readin' and writin' and readin' and thinkin'
and searching for reasons and missing the seasons
The Autumn, the Spring, the Summer, the snow
The record will stop and the record will go
Latches latched the windows down,
the dog coming in and the dog going out
Up with caffeine and down with a shot
Constantly worried about what I've got
Distracting my work but I can't make a stop
and my confidence on and my confidence off
And I sink to the bottom and rise to the top
and I think to myself that I do this a lot
World outside just goes it goes it goes it goes it goes it goes...
and witness it all from the blinds of my window
THREE, FOUR

I'm a little nervous 'bout what you'll think
When you see me in my swimming trunks
And last night in New York I got raging drunk
Remember one time I got raging drunk with you

Now, I can recall a time when we made the city
Streets our playground, swimming in the fountains
Filled with cigarettes and bottles
Sped through Italian city streets of cobblestone

Because we had to
Because I loved you
Because the damned alcohol
Because what ever at all

Now I've grown too aware of my mortality
To let go and forget about dying
Long enough to drop the hammer down
And let the indolence go wild and flying through

Because we had to
