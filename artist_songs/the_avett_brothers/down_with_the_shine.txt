Down with the shine, the perfect shine
That poisons the well, and ruins my mind
I get took for a ride every time
Down with the glistening shine

It's in with the new, and out with the old
Out goes the warm, and in comes the cold
It's the most predictable story told
It's in with the young, out with the old

Down with the shine, the perfect shine
That poisons the well, and ruins my mind
I get took for a ride every time
Down with the glistening shine

A belly full of high-dollar wine
A fat hand, a fat wallet too
Things change and get strange
With this movement of time
It's happening right now to you

Down with the shine, the perfect shine
That poisons the well, and ruins my mind
I get took for a ride every time
Down with the glistening shine

It's a real bad time to bring up the truth
Though we've searched we found no
Fountain of youth
Not in Spain, no where near anywhere 
Close to here

There's nothing good because nothing lasts
And all that comes here, it comes here to pass
I would voice my pain but the change wouldn't last
All that comes, it comes here to pass

Down with the shine, the perfect shine
That poisons the well, and ruins my mind
I get took for a ride every time
Down with the glistening shine

I get took for a ride every time
Down with the glistening shine
