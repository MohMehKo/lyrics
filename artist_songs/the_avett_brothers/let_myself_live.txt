The night just got darker
the moon fell out of sight.
God's hopeful stars
were drained of all their light
A dear friend of mine
who fell on hard times
He thinks his house will clean
if he shares with me mine

I never dream of you a lonely man
I used to grab at truth with those same strong hands
Then when I got sick through the thin and then the thick
I turn my back and I let myself live

Well the nights only get longer
before your sun will shine
Leave the clock alone my brother
your enemy is time
Remember what the ramblin man said
on his way back home
Don't hang your head much longer
there's more pretty girls than one

I never dream of you a lonely man
I used to grab at truth with those same strong hands
Then when I got sick through the thin and then the thick
I turn my back and I let myself live
