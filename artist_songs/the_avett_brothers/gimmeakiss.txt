Gimme a dance, gimme a chance, gimme your hands
Give me just a little bit of your sweet romance
Give me your hands
I know what they say about me
Hell, I started most of them rumors myself you see
So give 'em to me

It wont take long for me to tell you who I am
You hear my voice right now well that's pretty much what I am

So gimme a smile, gimme a while, gimme a mile
Give me just a little bit of your sweet devine
Just give me a smile
I know what you said about me
I think maybe if I had a preachin' judge then I'd forgive you see
So give 'em to me

It wont take long for me to tell you what I am
You hear my voice right now well that's pretty much what I am

I'm bailin on my life
Cause I'm wailing on my life
So please just gimme a kiss

Well I know you're waiting for a ring
Ease up little lady, see, I'm not promising anything

So gimme a chance, gimme a dance, gimme your hands
Give me just a little bit of your sweet romance
Just give me your hands
I know what they say about me
Hell, I started most of them rumors myself you see
So give 'em to me

It wont take long for me to tell you who I am
Well you hear this voice right now well that's pretty much all I am
I'm bailin on my life
Cause I'm wailing on my life
So please just gimme a kiss
