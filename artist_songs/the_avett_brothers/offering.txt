Babe I'm lost
Cause I don't know what to say
Hmmm I love you
Want to make you my wife someday

Don't wanna steal you
Of a young woman's light
To me it's perfect
Just wanna do you right

And I've known others
And I've loved others too
But I loved them cause they were stepping stones
On a staircase to you

Sometimes I act foolish
I don't know what to do
Please babe try not to judge me
For my offering is true

And I dream of children
We can call our own
Watch 'em run around in the front yard
From the front porch of our home 

To me it's perfect
Just wanna do you right
