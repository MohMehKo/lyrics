I think I dreamed you, again last night.
I hope wherever you are, things turned out right.
But it's never the same, when you lose and you gain.

I see the truth now
I see the truth now
I just want to hold you
I should have told you
We are in love
We are in...

You tan stomach; and that mole on your lip.
We coulda had it all in one time; if I didn't slip.
Trip on my words; and land on my heart.

I see the truth now
I see the truth now
I just want to hold you
I should have told you
We are in love
We are in...
We are in...
We are in...

The road can be cold
and it's always long.
The sermon I whisper these days
are the words to a song
Are you in the old town?
Are you buckled in?

It's not the same
Our lives are not the same
I still want to hold you
I should have told you
We are in love
We are in...

Love is on it's way
The dying wish of Marvin Gaye
Michelle I know you'll understand
The answers in your hands
The answers in your hands
