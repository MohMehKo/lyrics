All it will take is 
just one moment and
you can say goodbye to 
how we had it planned

Fear like a habit, 
run like a rabbit out and away.
Through the screen door 
to the unknown.

And I want to love you and more.
I want to find you and more.
Where do you reside
When you hide? How can I find you?

'Cause I want to send you and more
I want to tempt you and more
can you tell that I am alive?
Let me prove it.

You and I, we're the same.
Live and die, we're the same.
Hear my voice, know my name,
you and I, we're the same.

Left like a pharaoh, 
sing like a sparrow anyway.
Even if there is no land or
love in sight.

We bloom like roses, 
leave like Moses out and away.
Through the bitter crowd 
to the daylight.

And I want to love you and more.
I want to find you and more.
Can you tell that I am alive?
Let me prove it to ya.

You and I, we're the same.
Live and die, we're the same.
You rejoice, I complain,
but you and I, we're the same.
Live and die, we're the same.
You and I, we're the same.
Hear my voice, know my name,
you and I, we're the same.

And I want to love you and more.
I want to find you and more.
Where do you reside
When you hide? How can I find you?

'Cause I want to send you and more
I want to tempt you and more.
Can you tell that I am alive?
Let me prove it.

You and I, we're the same.
Live and die, we're the same.
You rejoice, I complain,
but you and I, we're the same.
Live and die, we're the same.
You and I, we're the same.
Hear my voice, know my name,
you and I, you and I.
