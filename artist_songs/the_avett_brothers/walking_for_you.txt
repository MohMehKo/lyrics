Ain't got no money
But I've got time
I don't care about the sunshine
But I love to see you smile

So you say you're lonesome
Baby dry your eyes
Well there's a road to your door step
I'll be there by morning's light

But I don't have an answer
For when you ask me why
I know I love you baby like I know I never ever
Gonna let you ever say goodbye
Say goodbye, Say goodbye

I've got an old Ford pickup truck
I got a Cadillac
And I don't care how I get there
Transportation can't hold me back

But I don't have an answer
For when you ask me why
I know I love you baby like I know I never ever
Gonna let you ever say goodbye
Say goodbye, Say goodbye

Cause I've had bad lovers, yeah
That walked to my back door
I've wasted years walkin' for them gals
That's how I know you're worth walking for

So you say you're so in love
Well baby so am I
And I don't care if I'm on the road
I am always by your side

But I don't have an answer
When you ask me why
I know I love you baby like I know I never ever
Gonna let you ever say goodbye
Say goodbye, Say goodbye
