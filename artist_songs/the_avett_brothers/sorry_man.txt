Your mama doesn't like me
She thinks I'm a sorry man
When she tells her friends about me
She says I'm a sorry man
And she asks you each day
Why would you stay with a sorry man
Well I was doing my best
Just trying to impress, still a sorry man
And I've got news for your ma
I'm the best she ever saw
No one could love your daughter like I do

Your mama told you father
She said I'm a sorry man
So he told me not to ever
Come back here again
So I told your dear old daddy
That he can't keep us apart
Because it's you and not your parents
Who can break my heart
And I've got news for your ma
I'm the best she ever saw
No one could love your daughter like I do

Well I tried to tell your mama
But I didn't want to fight
Well they'll be the same tomorrow
So we're leaving here tonight
Tomorrow they'll be waking
To a sad sorry dawn
And then they'll be sorry
When they see that we're gone
Cause I've got news for your ma
I'm the best she ever saw
No one could love your daughter like I do
