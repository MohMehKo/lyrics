This and who I used to be
Don't matter much at all to me
The pit you dug to plant your feet's
A far cry from my destiny
Not even the clouds
Not even the past
Not even the hands of God
Could hold me back from you

Dark and lonely is the ride
The devil always by my side
Though no match for what lies between
A thought of you, your trust for me
Not even the sun
A bullet from a gun
No nothing that this world could bring
Or anything someone could do
Could hold me back from you

No count of gold placed in my hand
The largest find, the greatest sum
Though some would say it'd ease our pain
We know that it can't be done
Not even the sun
Not even the clouds
Not even the past
No nothing that this world could bring
Or anything someone could do
Could hold me back from you
Could hold me back from you
Could hold me back from you
