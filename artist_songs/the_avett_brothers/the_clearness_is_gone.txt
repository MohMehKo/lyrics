Well your hair fell on me like I dreamt that it would
When I dreamt your hair was long
Through the linens a moment of clearness shown through
In a minute the clearness was gone

When to know what I should for my heart to rest
Doesn't meet with the actions I make
I will seek the approval of no one but you
In love for the changes I take

The first time we fell for it
We blamed it on youth
And now we get hell for it
And blame it on truth

Of mind, oh my
Of mind, oh my
Of mind, oh my

Well your hair fell on me like I dreamt that it would
When I dreamt that your hair was long
Through the linens a moment of clearness shown through
In a minute the clearness was gone
