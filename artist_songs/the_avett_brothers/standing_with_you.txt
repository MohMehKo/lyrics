Well it's been a pretty rough
Couple of years but I think things
Will change for us
And I always will put you before me
Unless, of course, it's dangerous

Standing with you
Standing with you
I might miss the rhythm
But I'm catching the tune
And that's something for me
Yeah that's something for me

Well I told you I won't make the same mistakes again
But you know I probably will
And so many nights, go by like a flash
From a camera without any film
But we don't need to remember every single moment we've had
And I don't need understanding for every single moment I've had

As long as I'm
Standing with you
Standing with you
I might miss the rhythm
But I'm catching the tune
And that's something, for me
Yeah that's something, for me
And I'll be walking with you
And Walking with you
I might miss the meaning
But I'm catching the truth
And that's pretty good for me
Yeah that's pretty good for me

[x2:]
Well it's been a pretty rough couple of years
But I think things will change for us
