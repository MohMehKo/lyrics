Careful, not to say that I don't care
or haven't, or can't, or will not again
Winter didn't die, she was murdered
and you are the culprit, I am the same

It's only right, it's only right
For you to fall in love with me
Give me a life, give me a life
Give me tonight, it's only right

Thirty days alone with the savior
an angel, a devil, rapture and smoke
And I'm careful, just not to say that I miss you
Cause sometimes, I guess I still miss myself

It's only right, it's only right
For you to fall, in love with me
Give me a life, give me a life
Give me tonight, it's only right
