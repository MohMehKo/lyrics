I've been hanging out with the rejects in the attic
Can't get out of my head the way you left
I got a sense of belonging but what does it matter
The winter's on its way here to collect
The colors we thought were ours to protect

I was born on the outskirts of a dream
My daddy was a miner of almost anything
And I've been busting stones
Too proud to go back home
Admit that all my digging was in vain

But don't we talk different than we did?
Am I more quiet than I've been?
Don't you look brighter than the moon?
Don't I look different without you?
Don't I look different without you?

I'm taking rain like an Appaloosa hoofprint
And you know I'm drinking sunlight all day long
I'm opened up just like a dogwood flower
And winter's on its way here to collect

But don't we talk different than we did?
Am I more quiet than I've been?
And don't you look brighter than the moon?
Don't I look different without you?
Don't I look different without you?

I was taken on the outskirts of a dream
I had a been a miner of almost everything
Well I stopped busting stones
I'll have to go back home
Admit that all my digging was in vain

But don't we talk different than we did?
Am I more quiet than I've been?
And don't you look brighter than the moon?
Don't I look different without you?
Don't I look different?

Winter's on its way here to collect
Don't I look? Don't I look?
Winter's on its way here to collect
Don't I look? Don't I look?
Winter's on its way here to collect
Don't I look? Don't I look?
Winter's on its way here to collect
Don't I look? Don't I look?
Winter's on its way here without you
Winter's on its way here without you
