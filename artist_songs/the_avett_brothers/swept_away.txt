Well you send my life a whirling
Darling when you're twirling
On the floor
Who cares about tomorrow?
What more is tomorrow?
Than another day.

When you swept me away
Yeah you swept me away
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la

I see the end of the rainbow
But what more is a rainbow
Than colors out of reach
If you come down to my window
And I climb out my window
Then we'll get out of reach

Then you swept me away
Yeah you swept me away

You said with such honest feeling
But what'd you really mean
When you said that I'm your man
Well how my darling can it be
When you have never seen me
And you never will again

That you swept me away
Yeah you swept me away

Well life is ever changing
but I will always find a constant
and comfort in your love
With your heart my soul is bound
And as we dance I know
that heaven will be found

Well you send my life a whirling
Darling when you're twirling
On the floor
And who cares about tomorrow?
Girl, what more is tomorrow?
Than another day.

When you swept me away
Yeah you swept me away
Yeah you swept me away
