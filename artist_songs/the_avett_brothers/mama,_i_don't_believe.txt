I lay here pretending to sleep
Someone’s always asking for something of me
I try to hide but I’m stripped of my strength
Bound by the truth, bored by the speed
And the promise of the fortune it brings
Oh mama, I just don't believe

Like it happened in a Broadway scene
Are we still acting, is this the real you and me
The words don’t flow, but my heart it still bleeds
Bound by the love, the warmth that it brings
And its promise to fix everything
Oh mama, I just don't believe

Angel wings tied to memories
They'll never fly for you and I
Angel wings tied to melodies
They'll never sing for you and me

A young man whose soul was burning
The hands of the people guiding him on
He was moving along, mama he was cooking
But the calendar won, his earnings are gone
And this fortune that this young man saw
Oh mama, I don’t believe in it at all

Angel wings tied to memories
They'll never fly for you and I
Angel wings tied to melodies
They'll never sing for you and me
For you and me, they'll never sing

Oh mama, I just don't believe
