I was in love with your beauty from the day you walked my way.
Oh how I wish that was enough to have made me want to stay.
See I'm as true as I try to be and I must say my girl.
I tried the best to give to you all of the truest in the world.

But when I left your house that morning in that ragged thunderbird
Tried so hard to fight the voices from the devil's that I heard.
See there's a highway to the right of us I took it years ago.
And since a year ago can't drive past, without turning down that road.

And I knew it,
I never should have turned the wheel
And I knew it,
The voices calling me were real
I knew it
Listen to the song they sing
I knew I was wrong
And I knew I was wrong

So give me a try at describing just how difficult it is.
When you kinda love two girls to figure out which one you miss.
Stumble away from your stairway with your perfume on my clothes.
Well I kinda loved two girls but now I've kinda lost 'em both.

And I knew it,
I never should have turned the wheel
And I knew it,
The voices calling me were real
I knew it
Listen to the song they sing
I knew I was wrong
And I knew I was wrong

And if I could gather up the damage that I rendered in my life.
Place it on a scale and weigh against the damage done that night.
Then it'd be safe to say the weight of all I did and didn't do.
Would surely float against the lightest straw I ever did to you.
