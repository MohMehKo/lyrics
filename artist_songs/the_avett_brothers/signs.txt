It's the place and your friends that got me down
Tellin' me I should not hang around
There's a sign in the window
Tellin' me I've got to go

I see the signs everyday
In your face and in your way that you act
It's not that it hurts my pride
Now I see the other side of you
The side that won't let down
The side that won't let go

I didn't mean for me to see
Things I see in you and me
But know I know that we can't live together
The way I want to live free forever
