What was it like for you
I can tell you in truth what it was like for me
To be sixteen in July, sixteen in July
License in my hand
Freedom on my mind
I was sixteen in July, sixteen in July
With summer to my left
And no one to my right

What did you want to hear on your radio
Even if it did not come in clear
You'd still be sixteen in July, sixteen in July
With license in your hand
and freedom on your mind
If you're sixteen in July, sixteen in July
With summer to your left
And no one to your right

For me it was shortcut road
The girl was new and the car was old
Were you in love like me?
Or at least as in love as you can be?
When you're sixteen in July, sixteen in July
With license in your hand
and freedom on your mind
I was sixteen in July, sixteen in July
With summer to my left, and no one to my right
