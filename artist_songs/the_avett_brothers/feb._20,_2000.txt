The whipping of the flag above
It sung me to sleep
And I awoke to feel her hair
Dancing on my cheek

I awoke with the crazy feeling
That I was where I belong
And the sun warmed a remembered love
In my head I heard this song

Don't leave, you've finally made it home
Ain't this the girl that you wanted all along
I know it hurts to think about everything that went wrong
But I think its over now

And I cant believe how her hands
Still fit perfectly in mine
If I don't take my chances now
I'll be searching all my life

Trying to find the feelings that I knew
With this lovely country girl
If those plans are just a young man's mistake
Then why am I still so set on her

Don't leave, you've finally made it home
Ain't this the girl that you wanted all along
I know it hurts to think about everything that went wrong
But I think its over now

And more than ever, now I hear
That sweet old voice inside my ear
It says

Don't leave, you've finally made it home
Ain't this the girl that you wanted all along
I know it hurts to think about everything that went wrong
But I think its over now

Her hair is still soft and sweet
Her eyes still green, her heart still beats
For you and for the lord above
Be done with the pain
And get on with the love
