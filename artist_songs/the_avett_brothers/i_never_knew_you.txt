Well I guess it's kind of funny how
I loved you so way back when
You say I wouldn't know you now
Well I didn't even know you then

We change a lot
And no one here can stop
That train before
It gets to where it's going
At all

So I guess it's kind of funny how
I loved you so way back when
You say I wouldn't know you now
Well I didn't even know you then

I heard about the company you're keeping
And from someone who didn't have much interest
In keeping us apart

So I guess it's kind of funny how
I loved you so way back when
You say I wouldn't know you now
Well I didn't even know you then

And so I go out Friday night
And talk to anyone I can
If they can see me they can hear me
Run my mouth
I tell them all
I'd love to see you once again
Or maybe
Just run into you hanging out

You know I lie, so it comes as no surprise
When I admit that I don't really want to reunite

So I guess it's kind of funny how
I loved you so way back when
You say I wouldn't know you now
Well I didn't even know you then

No I didn't even know you then
