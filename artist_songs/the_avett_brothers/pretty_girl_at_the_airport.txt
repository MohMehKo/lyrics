Wish me luck I know you think I'll need it
For all the hardest roads we have to walk alone
And you don't have to tell me that you love me
For all the words I've never understood
I know, I know

The wind that blows from here to California
Never stops to turn and wonder why it goes
And you don't have to tell me when you're leaving
For all the plans I've never understood
I know, I know

Leave now while you can
I'm not your man
I know, I know

To have your things and wait there for a plane ride
No one there to sit and hold your hand in flight
But everyone I know out here is lonely
Even those that have someone to lie beside at night

Leave me with the dawn
It's almost gone
I know, I know
Leave now while you can
I'm not your man
I know, I know
