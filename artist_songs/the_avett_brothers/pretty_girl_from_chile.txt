I'm no more than a friend girl
I can see that you need more
My boots are on my feet now
My bag is by the door

And the love and the attention
That you need and ask me for
Are weakened by my actions 
And lies that I have told
I'm scared to think that I've abandoned you
I'd like to say that I'm a faithful man but it may not be true

And my heart is like a mason's
Hands of weathered skin
Each scar makes it harder
For me to hurt again
I'm scared to think that I've abandoned you
I'd like to say that I'm a faithful man but it may not be true

Gabriella, the things that I tell ya
Are all meant to help ya
Are they working out
Have I gone, have I gone and failed ya
Gabriella, have I let you down

Gabriella, the things that I tell ya
Are all meant to help ya
Are they working out
Have I gone, have I gone and failed ya
Gabriella, have I let you down
