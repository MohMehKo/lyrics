I know you were needing more of me than I gave
when we heard that your cousin had crashed and passed away
I hate it when I talk without thinking
I will do what you are needing me to do

I wanna be good to you
I wanna be there for you
And when I come home, will you still want me to?

When your best friend got married I was off and gone
You said it wasn't a problem, that there was nothing wrong
with putting my work, my art, and my songs
before spending time at the wedding
As I listened over the phone-line, you talked and you sounded so sad
Alone in a room full of strangers, some dude saying I treat you bad
Who is this guy and what does he know?
Apparently more than I do

I wanna be good to you
I wanna be there for you
And when I come home, will you still want me to?
And when I come home, will you still want me to?

When you were born I promised myself I'd always be there for you
To help you feel safe and never alone, no matter what life put you through
Time passed by, I lost my way, and didn't find it for years
A strong young woman now stands in her place
The child has disappeared
Now that I'm home, do you still want me here?

I wanna be good to you
I wanna be there for you
I wanna be good to you
And when I come home, will you still want me to?
And if I come home, will you still want me to?
