Souls like the wheels
Turning, taking us with wind at our heels
Burning, making us decide on what we're giving
Change this way of living

One little song
Give me strength to the leave the sad and the wrong
Bury safely in the past where I've been living
Alive but unforgiving
Let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go

One little girl
Bring me life from where I thought it was dark
Be the spark that has a chance to light the candle
Love that I can handle
Let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go
Let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go

Souls like the wings
Spreading out away from bad memories
Make us capable of taking off and landing
Alive with understanding
Let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go
Let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go
