Don't be fooled by my words
Don't be fooled by my song
If you choose to belive them
You'll plainly be wrong

I have love for my family
I have love for my friends
That's as far as it goes,
And I must let you know
My love for you was pretend.

Pretend love, pretend love,
Don't be mistaken, I've only been fakin'
Pretend love

Don't you know I've a gift
And I've wraped it in truth
Your birthday's tomorrow,
But the gift is not for you,

But if I came with a present
I would bring you a clue
Hopes you'd finally see
That your feelings for me
Will never be returned

Pretend love, pretend love
Don't be mistaken, I've only been fakin'
Pretend love

Pretend love, pretend love
Don't be mistaken, I've only been faking
Pretend love
