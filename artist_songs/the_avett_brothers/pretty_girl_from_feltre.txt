Susanna, Italiana, what do you want to do?
I thought I had figured it out nut that was before you

Walking a mile into town
Hoping to see you around
Hoping your man is nowhere to be found
And hoping we'll go to your room
And hoping we'll go to your room

Quietly act like you love me until I leave Feltre
And when you learn of my return
Watch what the townspeople say

Riding in your cargo van
Driving your mom's cargo van
If you only knew how charming it was
The lure of your folks cargo van
The lure of your folks cargo van

Go tell Max
Be clear with the facts
Leave me a letter to there
I still have the one from before
From when I turned twenty four
