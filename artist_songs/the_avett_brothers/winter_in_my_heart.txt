It must be winter in my heart
There's nothing warm in there at all
I missed the summer and the spring
The floating yellow leaves of fall

A million colors fill my eyes
The roman candles and the stars
The calendar says July 4
But it's still winter in my heart

They say flowers bloom in spring
Red and golden, blue and pink
They say seasons turn in time
Theirs are changing, why won't mine?

It must be winter in my heart
There's nothing warm in there at all
I missed the summer and the spring
The floating yellow leaves of fall

The air in there is frigid cold
I don't know what the reasons are
The calendar says August 1
But it's still winter in my heart

They say flowers bloom in spring
Red and golden, blue and pink
They say seasons turn in time
Theirs are changing, why won't mine?

It must be winter in my heart
I don't know what the reasons are
It must be winter in my heart
