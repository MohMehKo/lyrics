You are mine
The edge I need when I am out of line
The air I breathe when I believe I'm dying
I guess you are there

It is told
With age our hearts are destined to grow cold
Well I won't argue that but this I know
The snow won't fall on me

Life goes yes I guess it's true
Why close down we'll follow soon
Where we are is not so far from where we're gonna be
You and me

Our life is a heel
With danger in our hearts the roads our field
With shadows deep as dark girl grip your wheel
Push your moment through

Life goes yes I guess it's true
Why close down we'll follow soon
Where we are is not so far from where we're gonna be
You and me
You and me

You are mine
The first to kiss the last to say goodbye
The answer to the question who do I owe my everything?

Life goes yes I guess it's true
Why close down we'll follow soon
Where we are is not so far from where we're gonna be
You and me
You and me
