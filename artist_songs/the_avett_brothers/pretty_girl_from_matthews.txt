Hold on a minute it ain't time to leave
Tell me how you're feeling one more time
Four long years and I just can't believe
That I'm still yours and you're still mine

While I was gone, yes, I fell in love
Asked around and heard that you did too
Two drunken years and push came to shove
I met love, love left me blue

You're rising like a sun
That pulled the curtain on the night
Coming through the window
To brighten up my life

And I'm all right, yeah, I think I'm fine
My savior lives in telephones
And I just dream of you and step outside
Dial up and hope that you're home

You're rising like a sun
That waits up all night
Coming through the window
To brighten up my life

Hold on a minute, yeah, I do love you
Sometimes I guess that ain't enough
When you come round you put me through
And I thank you, oh, so much

Another year, maybe, three or four
Maybe five or six or even more
You'll find another man to take my place
And I'll see you on the good Lord's shores

You're rising like a sun
That pulled the curtain on the night
Coming through the window
To brighten up my life
