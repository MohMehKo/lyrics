Do you love him? Do you love him? Do you love him, my dear?
Does he hold you? Does he hug you? Does he keep you near?
And as you lie together, does he whisper in your ear?
Do you love him? Do you love him? Do you love him, my dear?

In the evening, those tired evenings, at twilights first glare
Does he lay in your lap? Do you play with his hair?
And when he falls asleep, Do you just stare?
Do you love him? Do you love him? Do you love him, my dear?

Late in the night when you fear the unknown
Does he warm up your mind? As you chill to the bone
I do love you, I do feel you, Each day and night
But I can't tell right from wrong, or fear from insight
But you always knew everything and that is what is clear
Do you love him? Do you love him? Do you love him, my dear?
