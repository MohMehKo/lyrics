Oh don't you look at me that way
I would be honest but I don't know how to say
I've been lazy with my love
Can't you give me a chance to make it up to you

I'm always chasing some far off dream
My lady I know it's not easy for you to see
But I've lied to myself
And your lovelyness no it doesn't help
No your beautiful smile don't help

My dreams are lies
That I have tried to ignore
My dreams fly me
To a place near Baltimore

And I love this moment we're in
Though we might never see this moment again
May you find all that you need
An easy way to forget about me
May you forget about me

My dreams are lies
That I have tried to ignore
My dreams fly me
To a place near Baltimore

And if I don't make it to the spring
May you catch the joy that a melody brings
From my dear brothers ragged six string
Singing the songs we're embarrassed to sing
May you never be embarrassed to sing

My dreams are lies
That I have tried to ignore
My dreams fly me
To a place near Baltimore
