There is a sea, and I am a captain
Of something unknown, waves high as mountains
There is a key, and there is a light
Here's to times that I catch it
May it last through the night

I'm as low as they come
I'm what shouldn't be done
Filthy and lost
Still up for trying
You're the one reason why
I look up and smile
Wishing for love
And I'm ready to forge ahead

There is a sea, and I am a captain
Of something unknown, waves high as mountains
There is a key, and there is a light
Here's to times that I catch it
May it last through the night

Dark thoughts are hidden
Masked in the shadows
Times they get strange
Cause a friend
Where all we'll fit in
Blind in our armor
Traveling fast
Judgement is past
Now it's time to go home

There is a sea, and I am a captain
Of something unknown, waves high as mountains
There is a key, and there is a light
Here's to times that I catch it
May it last through the night

When the engine won't turn
When the fire won't burn
Like it did when we felt it
Deep in our hearts
Untie the rudder
Guide them away
Take me I'll serve you
Take me I'll serve

There is a sea, and I am a captain
Of something unknown, waves high as mountains
There is a key, and there is a light
Here's to times that I catch it
May it last through the night
