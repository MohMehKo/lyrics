You're not a girl, you're a town
You're snow on the ground
You're my first year in school
You're the words in a song that Hoon sang to me
And all around my memories, you dance

You're not a girl, you're a car
You're a red Trans Am
You're 90 miles an hour
We never get caught cause there's no cops around
And no roads like this, downtown

Why'd we have to change
It all seems so fine
We'll go our own ways
We're both asking
Why'd we have to change
It all seems so fine
We'll go our own ways
We're both asking, why

You're not a girl, you're the night of the homecoming game
You're the voice in my head
Just begging me to stay
You're the smoke in our lights as we sped away
To catch the moonlight on the graves

You're not a girl, you're a waltz
You're a canopy bed
You're June to August
You're the back and forth sway of the hammock all day
When I asked you what did you say?

Why'd we have to change
It all seems so fine
We'll go our own ways
We're both asking
Why'd we have to change
It all seems so fine
We'll go our own ways
We're both asking, why
