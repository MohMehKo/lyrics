[Jim:] Uh, this is August the 15th 1985. Seth is just now 5 years old, Bonnie is just now 12, and Scott is 9 years old.
[mumbles]
[Jim:] Nine and a half? 
[Bonnie:] Ha!
[Scott:] Yeah, nine and a half. Nine and three quarters.
[Jim:] You’re not nine and a half.
[Scott:] I’m ‘bout eleven.
[Jim:] [laughs] no you’re not.
[Bonnie:] Nu’uh.
[Jim:] Okay, let’s talk about fun things. Seth, start out.
[Scott:] I didn’t read all my books, and now I can’t watch any TV.
[Jim:] That’s right.
[Bonnie:] That was Scott not Seth
[Seth:] Um, I didn’t play with much toys.
[Jim:] Okay.
[Seth:] And I didn’t [mumbles]
[Jim:] Okay, Scott. Scott’s talking about he was gonna read a bunch of books for this summer and he hasn’t read ‘em all so he doesn’t get to watch TV until he reads them. Uh, it’s pretty simple there.
[Jim:] Seth, what have you been doing?
[Seth:] Nothing.
[Jim:] Well, that’s good since the last time we talked you were three years old then and now you’re five and you haven’t been doing anything. Bonnie what would you like to talk about?
[Bonnie:] Um, I don’t know.
[Scott:] Carowinds.
[Jim:] No, let’s not talk about
[Bonnie:] I rode Cyclone.
[Jim:] Let’s not talk about Carowinds, let’s talk about something that is important for posterity.
[Scott:] What’s posterity?
[Jim:] That’s for years from now. Okay, Scott.
[Scott:] I’m getting ready to start a new school.
[Jim:] Yeah we start a new year of school.
[Scott:] Daddy kicks my butt every day *laughs*
[Jim:] That’s not true, he should but he doesn’t.
[Seth:] Uh, Let me talk.
[Jim:] Okay, go ahead.
[Seth:] Scott picks his butt more.
[Jim:] Scot-SETH!
[Bonnie:] No, he did that a long time ago.
[Jim:] I think, maybe we better stop this one again.
[Bonnie:] Want to?
[Jim:] Yeah,

[Jim:] Okay Seth, would you like to sing a song? What’s your favorite song?
[Seth:] If I were a kitten, I would stay outside.
[Jim:] If you were a kitten, you’d stay outside?
[Bonnie:] Where’d you get that song from?
[Seth:] I made it up
[Bonnie:] Oh! Sing it to the tape.
[Jim:] Sing it.
[Seth:] If I were a kitten, I would stay outside. I don’t know, I don’t remember the rest of it.
[Scott:] If I were a chicken, I would stay inside.
[Seth:] Scott!
[Seth:] If I were a picking, I would pick outside.
[Jim:] You start school this year, don’t you Seth?
[Seth:] No I don’t.
[laughs]
[Jim:] Oh, I thought you did.
[Seth:] I’m gonna start kindergarten.
[Jim:] That’s school isn’t it?
[Bonnie:] Yeah.
[Seth:] I hope I don’t like it.
[Bonnie:] Why? It’s fun.
[Seth:] Because I hate it.
[Bonnie:] It’s the best grade.
[Scott:] It is!
[Jim:] You’re gonna be starting and you’re gonna be riding
[Seth:] I don’t like it because they have five parties.
[Jim:] You’re gonna be riding the big bus. When Scott gets on you won’t be left behind anymore.
[Seth:] I’ll be with Scott?
[Scott:] But you don’t kiss me and hug me at school.
[Seth:] Okay, Scott.
[Bonnie:] Don’t be ridiculous.
[Jim:] He’s your little brother, let him kiss your face if he wants to.
[Bonnie:] Yeah.
[Scott:] In the bathroom.
[Jim:] That’ll pass away quick enough. 
[Jim:] Okay, Bonnie you get to go to school this year. Where are you gonna go to school?
[Bonnie:] Mt. Pleasant.
[Jim:] You’re really looking forward to that aren’t you? This has been a pretty good sized summer for you. You haven’t gone a lot of places or done a lot of things.

[Jim:] Like last year.
[Seth:] Last year?
[Jim:] But, you have gone and had someone look at your teeth. Didn’t you?

[Bonnie:] I’m gonna have to get braces in a year.
[Seth:] yeah.
[Jim:] That sounds terrible, but you’ll
[Bonnie:] They put ‘em in pretty neat. The plastic bands that you wrap, and they just peel off the plastic and they’re on.
[Jim:] Really?
[Bonnie:] So it won’t take too long.
[Jim:] That’ll be good. Okay, uh, this’ll be a change for you going to Mt. Pleasant, not A.P. Allan. What do you think is going to be different at Mt. Pleasant?
