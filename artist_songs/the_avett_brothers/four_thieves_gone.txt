Four thieves gone
One woke up
Said we can't use the songs we wrote
Swear I've heard that very line
I can't claim this music mine

Three thieves left
One got smart
I saw him leaving in his car
From the road
I heard him scream
It lacks originality

Two thieves left
They both agree
They live and die off melody
One just fell dead
On his back
When we listen to the track

One thief left
He went to jail
He left a mile on paper trail
He's in for life
He doesn't care
It's worth the songs that put him there

Four thieves gone
Four thieves gone
Four thieves gone
Four thieves gone
