Folk always told me that my heart would grow
The older the man, yeah, the stronger the stone
Am I losing my mind?
Am I growing backwards with time?

Some say with age that a purpose comes clear
I see the opposite happening here
Are we losing the fight?
Are we growing backwards with time?

I was young and love was fun
Now it's so serious
Now all the fun has equal pain
There's something wrong with this
For all I know there's more I don't
Oh the little I have learned
For every year of knowledge gained
Is a negative year I've earned

Folk always told me that my heart would grow
The older the man, yeah, the stronger the stone
Am I losing my mind?
