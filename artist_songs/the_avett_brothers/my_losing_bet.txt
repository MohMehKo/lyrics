I waited for you
A hard thing to do
Knowin' we're through
And though I don't have to choose
To welcome you back or push you away
But wait we're not there yet
And though I'm losing the bet
There's still the sunset

I felt so surprised
When she arrived
Wearing a smile
Smiles soon turn to tears
Out on her back pier
After all the love how did I end here

Oh Lord, Oh Lord...
