We spent the night at St. Josephs
Shaking and shivering in fever
Nurses and criminals before us
I will stay here with you, my love

We sat at Lake Junaluska
Cried over where we would wed
If it's this place or any other
It's not where I am it's who I'm with

News came of a child
Born unto a world
Of people demented and wild
I will be here for you, my love

What was our reason for fighting?
Selfish and centered at best
I give up on trying
To understand why we were blessed

We'll spend the night at St. Josephs.
