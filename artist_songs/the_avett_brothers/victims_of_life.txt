Victims of cycles, victims of life
Victims of wrong, victims of right
Victims of anything, and all the above
Victims of hate, victims of love
Victims of hate, victims of love

If you're rich, you're hungry for money
If you're broke, you're hungry for bread
If you're wild, you're bound to die young friend
If you live in fear you're already dead

Victims of cycles, victims of life
Victims of wrong, victims of right
Victims of winning, victims of loss
Victims of payment, victims of cost
You got the victims of violence, victims of peace
You know we're all victims, exactly like me
Victims of anything, and all the above
Victims of hate, victims of love
Victims of hate, victims of love

I sold that shovel, I got two arms
They're digging a trench, right through my heart
They can't agree, except on one thing
They gone too far right now they're too close to leave

Victims of cycles, victims of life
Victims of wrong, victims of right
Victims of anything, and all the above
Victims of hate, victims of love
Victims of hate, victims of love
Victims of anything, and all the above
Victims of hate, victims of love
Victims of hate, victims of love
