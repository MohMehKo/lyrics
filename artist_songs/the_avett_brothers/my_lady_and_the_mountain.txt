I brought you to the river
To watch the fish swim by
And lay around that grassy bank
And breathe in that blue sky

I brought you to these waters
To see what you could see
The difference in the two worlds
Can't help but frighten me

But darlin' it's been a long time
Since I've seen you smile that way at me
Darlin' just feel the warmth here
Happy's not the word
You make me free

I brought you to the mountains
To watch the clouds float by
The wind here gives me shivers
The freedom makes me cry

And being with you darlin'
Forget what we have not
Just being at the top here
To convince anyone there's a god

But darlin' it's been a long time
Since I've seen you smile that way at me
Darlin' just feel the warmth here
Happy's not the word
You make me free

(Make me free now)

I gave you my decision
Regardless wrong or right
The hills, they make me feel good
They make me feel alive

Like singing with my family
On Sunday afternoon
Like laughing in the morning
Wrapped up tight with you

But darlin' it's been a long time
Since I've seen you smile that way at me
Darlin' just feel the warmth here
Happy's not the word
You make me free
