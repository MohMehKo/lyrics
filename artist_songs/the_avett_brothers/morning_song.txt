Hurt so bad
You don't come around here anymore
Worse than that
Nothing's really helping I've been thinking 
'bout drinking again

It's alright 
If you finally stop caring 
Just don't go and tell someone that does
Cause even though I know there's hope in
Every morning song
I have to find that melody alone

Her name became
The flame unto the fire
A magpie on the wire warned of those
Dead until the high
Shamelessly alive until the low. 

It's alright 
If you finally stop caring 
Just don't go and tell someone that does
Cause even though I know there's hope in
Every morning song
I have to find that melody alone

But we can go ahead
If no one notices
What's the point of it?
I have to ask

How you learn to see
Hope inside of me
When you're sure to be
On leave at last

Hurt so bad
More than I expected that it would
Worse than that 
It seems to be lasting just a little 
Longer than it should

It's alright 
If you finally stop caring 
Just don't go and tell someone that does
Cause even though I know there's hope in
Every morning song
I have to find that melody alone
I have to find that melody alone
I have to find that melody alone
I have to find that melody alone
