As I turn my head to your side of the bed
Why are you wake, What's on your mind?
To this awful news try not to hold on
The day will come, the sun will rise, and we'll be fine

As long as I feel, as strong as I feel
I will carry you as long as I can
As hard on yourself, please pardon yourself
Do the best you can and that won't go unseen

How do I know when it's time to stop?
Runnin' from the things I do, being things I'm not
Oh I have tried, but I just changed my mind
Every night that falls, every morning light

How do I know that you will never stop?
Knowin' me, and trustin' me, and lovin' me a lot
Oh I have tried, but I just changed my mind
Every night that falls, every morning light

Well there's only so many ways
You can give your loving to me
I'd give my soul for just for one of them now
I'd give up the drinking, just tell me how

And there's only so many years
I'm going to give my love to you
And I spent the last one hidden away
Screaming my lungs out with nothing to say

As I turn my head to your side of the bed
Why are you wake, What's on your mind?
To this awful news try not to hold on
The day will come, the sun will rise, and we'll be fine
