I've got something to say
But it's all vanity, it's all vanity
I found a tune I could play
But it's all vanity, it's all vanity

Call off the guards
Call off the search
Their heads are chopped off
They're running in circles
They're running in circles

I have a plan for the day 
But it's all vanity, it's all vanity
I've got love pouring out of my veins
But it's all vanity, it's all vanity

Call off the guards
Call off the search
Their heads are chopped off
They're running in circles
They're running in circles
Running in circles
They're running in circles

I've got something to say
But it's all vanity, it's all vanity
I've got love pouring out of my veins
But it's all vanity, it's all vanity
