never thought I'd feel
Feel the way I do
When I'm in your arms
ba da ba ba
Sing your melody to me
And if you want me to leave
I'd walk away from this old farm
ba da ba ba

Baby, baby,
There ain't no cows left for milking
Baby, baby,
There ain't no chickens laying nothing
I'll walk on anything for you
I'll walk on anything for you
I'll walk off on anything for you
I'll walk off on anything for you

I was always told that
I would find somebody
I could keep a promise for
ba da ba ba
Words that don't mean a thing
To a broken-hearted man
I felt that way before
ba da ba ba

Baby, baby,
I don't remember feeling that way
Baby, baby,
And I owe it all to you
I'd take a nine to five for you
I'll take that nine to five for you
I'd take a nine to five for you
I'll work that nine to five for you

I'm convinced that nothings true
Just cause love worked out for you
Don't impress me no more
ba da ba ba
Words that don't mean a thing
To me I'm a broken-hearted man
I got dreams but nothing to hope for
ba da ba ba

Lady, lady,
Keep your distance I mean no good
Lady, lady,
I'm broken-hearted and I think the world should
All be broken-hearted too
All be broken-hearted too
All be broken-hearted too
Ya'll should be broken-hearted too
I'd like to give all my pain to you
If I could I'd give all my pain to you
