Hey man (yes)
Do you think we'll ever get back home?
Well I (guess)
We choose our battles one by one.
How I need (rest)
One more day of travel on the road.
How we've been (blessed)
Some times I don't feel that way.

Nothing's gonna change my mind,
I'm walkin' a different highway.
Nothing's gonna change my mind.
I'm travelin' a different line.
Oh, nothing's gonna change my mind.
You'll find what you need if you want it.
Nothing's gonna change my mind.
I'll find mine.

Brothers (yes)
I know I'm up and down.
Please, try to (accept)
Apologies for the sadness that I've found.
The years we've (spent)
Nothing short of grateful for our trip.
And those we've (met)
Nothing short of thankful.

Nothing's gonna change my mind,
I'm travelin' a different highway.
Nothing's gonna change my mind.
I'm walkin' a different line.
Oh, nothing's gonna change my mind.
You'll find what you need if you want it.
Nothing's gonna change my mind.
I'll find mine.

Boss man said work your way
Put it off for another day
I'm not listening tomorrow may not come
Lazy men find an easy way
Easy work for easy pay
I'm not listening there ain't no such a thing
Boss man said work your way
Put if off for another day
I'm not listening tomorrow may not come
Lazy men find an easy way
Easy work for easy pay
I'm not listening there ain't no such a thing as that

Hey man (yo)
Do you think they're listening
to a thing? (no no no)
I wonder what's on their mind.
We all should (go)
Break down the walls being built around us.
We'll make a (show)
Make it for our sons and our daughters.

Nothing's gonna change my mind,
I'm walkin' a different highway.
Nothing's gonna change my mind.
I'm travelin' a different line.
Oh, nothing's gonna change my mind.
You'll find what you need if you want it.
Nothing's gonna change my mind.
I'll find mine.
