Can you not see 
What you've done
You gave your heart away like that I didn't want to fall 
In love
With anyone but you did.

I can still hear 
The song 
The melody behind the kiss you gave me, 
You were wrong 
I was right so I walked away.

And left you there,
alone,
I got so tired of talking on the telephone.
How many times would we say the words "Goodbye"?

I made mistakes
and one
was telling you that I'd be there when telling-time had come.
I should've said I didn't care.

Oh the time I would have saved
If I had been less willing to accomodate. 
You'd been a little less likely to cry.

You go back to the high life
And I'll go back to the low.
I should've known
But now I know.

There'll be no words
from you
Describing how it felt to go through what I put you through.
It all makes perfect sense.

The way you cut
The rope
That kept you dangling from such bitter full amounts of hope.
I would have cut it too.
