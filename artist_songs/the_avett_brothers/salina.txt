Salina, I'm as nowhere as I can be
Could you add some somewhere to
Ahh Kansas, I'm kneeling, Ah Kansas, please

Cleveland I ain't never felt nothing so strong
Been believin' the words to my song
Ohio I'm leaving, Ohio I'm Gone

From town to town and State to State, 
There's people everywhere that try to capture us.
We Stole the cash and left our names 
And almost slipped in Indianapolis.
The Rain it fell, The Story went on
The Rain it fell, and we got gone.

Poughkeepsie hang up the telephone
I won't answer your phone calls no more
New York, quit calling, New York let me be

I'm changing the plans I've been setting on
I'm scared by the way that my life's getting gone
Carolina, one day I'll, Someday I'll come home.

Home, home
