I wanna get back
I wanna get square
I wanna get back on the hopes and dreams that I had
That the good lord above us can spare
Like that actor said
I don't wanna lose heart
I don't wanna get beat beat down by the big big world
I'll quit before I even start.

Lord, I just want my life to be true (I just want my life to be true)
And I just want my heart you be true (just want my heart to be true)
I just want my words to be true (I just want my words)
I want my soul to feel brand new

I wanna hold hands
Yeah, and I wanna make love
And I wanna keep running all day, and all night
Even when my mind tell my body "that's enough"
And I wanna stand up
Yeah, and I wanna stand tall
If I ever have a son, if I ever have a daughter
I don't wanna tell them that I didn't give my all

And I just wan my life to be true (I just want my life to be true)
And I just want my heart you be true (just want my heart to be true)
I just want my words to be true (I just want my words)
I want my soul to feel brand, brand new
Like a fresh coat of paint
We could make it anything but blue
Anything but blue

Now, when your dreams start saying
"I can't come true, you'd be better off without me"
Don't let them go
Don't let them go

I don't wanna go broke
Not from one bad deal
I don't wanna be up all night crying in my hands for a girl
That isn't even real

Lord, I just want my life to be true (I just want my life to be true)
And I just want my heart you be true (just want my heart to be true)
And I just want my words to be true (I just want my words to be true)
And I just want my song to be true (Just want my song to be true)
And I just want my heart you be true (just want my heart to be true)
And I just want my heart you be true (just want my heart to be true)
And I just want my words to be true (I just want my words to be true)
And I just want my heart you be true (just want my heart to be true)
And I just want my life to be true (I just want my life to be true)
And I just want my song to be true (Just want my song to be true)
And I just want my life to be true (I just want my life to be true)
I want my soul to feel brand new
I want my soul to feel brand new
