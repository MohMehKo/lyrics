I'm a hard hard worker everyday
I'm a hard hard worker and I'm workin' everyday
I'm a hard hard worker and I'm savin' all my pay
If I ever get some money for the wait
I'm going to take it all out and celebrate
I'm a hard hard worker everyday

Well I woke up early this morn
And I woke up early this morn, morn, morn
Yeah I woke up early this morn
And I got up early to sing
And I got up early to sing
I got up early to sing
I'm a hard hard worker I'm workin' everyday
I'm a hard hard worker and I'm savin' all my pay
If I ever get some money for the wait
I'm going to take it all out and celebrate
I'm a hard hard worker everyday

Well I give my thanks to the Lord
And I give my thanks to the Lord, Lord, Lord
Lord, please give me some more
And I got way down on my knees
Sayin' Lord can't you help me if you please, please, please
Can you save me from this workin' man's disease

Load in
Load out
Get down
Get out
Drive home
Too late
My mind stays crooked
And my back stays straight
I'm a hard hard worker everyday
I'm a hard hard worker and I'm savin' all my pay
If I ever get some money for the wait
I'm going to take it all out and celebrate
I'm a hard hard worker everyday
I'm a hard hard worker everyday
I'm a hard hard worker everyday
