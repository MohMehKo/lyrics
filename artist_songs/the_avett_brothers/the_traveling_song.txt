Well I guess if my daddy hadn't brought me up
Down a long dirt road in a pickup truck
I'd feel alright, 'neath the city lights
Couldn't leave the city lights it just ain't right

I was born out west of Cheyenne town
While my ma and pa was ramblin' 'round
I'm a rambler too, but I'm country bound
I'll travel till my country home is found
And I will travel
Yeah, I will travel
I will travel 'till my country home is found

Well a country song on the radio
Country star but what do you know
He's a city boy singin' country tunes
I'm a country boy with those city blues
So I will travel
Yeah I will travel
I will travel 'till my country home is found

Well Chestertown (lets go), Albany (lets go), 
Neptune (lets go), Pittsburgh (let's go), Cleveland town (let's go)...

I've got the wheels to ride and the wheels to run,
Some say I got ramblin' in my blood
No pretty girl can slow me down
I'll travel 'till my country home is found
So I will travel
I will travel
I will travel till my country home is found
Yeah, I will travel
I will travel
I will travel 'till my country home is found
