I haven't finished a thing since I started my life
I don't feel much like starting now
Walking down lonely has worked like a charm
I'm the only one I have to let down

But watching you makes me think that that is wrong

I can go on with my insecure nature
I can keep living on sympathy
I can tell all the people that all of the success is a direct reflection on me

But watching you makes me think that that is wrong

What is important
What's really important
Am I not to know by my name
Will I ever know silence without mental violence
Will the ringing at night go away

It's up to you
My father called on me

I haven't finished a thing since I started my life
I don't feel much like starting now
I haven't finished a thing since I started my life
I don't feel much like starting now
I haven't finished a thing since I started my life
I don't feel much like starting now
I haven't finished a thing since I started my life
I don't feel much like starting now
I haven't finished a thing since I started my life
I haven't finished a thing since I started my life
