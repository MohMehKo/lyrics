Two AM, the night is clear and cool
To be out at this hour, decent folk would tell me I'm a fool
But leaving Jenny's arms feels like a sin
I want to run back to her bed and hold her 'til the sun comes up again

Have I changed your life?
I love you still and I always will

Four AM, the night is over soon
Her eyes, they shine like diamonds, they glow just like the stars in her old room
And I know we make each other mad sometimes
But love is behind all of it, and we'll still be in love when pain subsides

Now I hope I've changed your life
I hope you can be forever with me

Three years and counting
The three best years of my life
But don't confuse our love with memories
You know the best is yet to come

Two AM, and I'm on my way home
I think of no one but you
I sing my song for you and you alone

And I'm glad you changed my life
Now I love you still
And I love you still
And I love you still
