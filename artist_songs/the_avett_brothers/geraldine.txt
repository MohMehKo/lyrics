I come from a place where every name
And every face seem so familiar

In came Miss Progress in her black dress
Look at the mess, she is a killer

Much like you and I
In every case that's made
There has to be a traitor
It's me this time
And I'm trading fun for right
Will I regret the notion later?

Geraldine's a name that comes to mind
When I go back to reminiscing
Abilene's a woman for my childhood
I spent the evenings kissing

I'm a fool for dreaming her alive
And loving something cold and rocky
The homophobic gentlemen built barricades
But their efforts couldn't stop me

In came Miss Progress in her black dress
Look at the mess, she is a killer
