Oh tell me please
that I don't have to read
between the lines
Hey this is me
and you don't have to keep
something heavy on your mind
Did you sleep?
Not a wink
Well neither did I

I've never been
too good at readin' in
between the lines
So babe spell it out
but you don't have to shout
when you're talking to me
Do you care?
Do you care?
Are you there?
Well neither am I

Don't lock your door
everyone is poor
between the lines
And I could never steal
the sadness you feel
when your changing you mind
Oh my dear
Can you hear?
Well neither can I

I want to live
and I want you to live
happy and free
But I don't know how
to seperate the now
from what used to be
Will you sleep?
Not a wink
Well neither will I
