Regret for every step I took
From Fisher Road to Hollywood
Feelin' bad and actin' good
Never was content

It was hostel moves and hotel rooms
Watch my friends promote their dooms
From Pontiac to Newport News
Nothin' made much sense

And I had to leave a few behind
When they replaced the apple wine
With cocaine and codeine pills
I knew I was done

And I didn't really say goodbye
They'll walk their path and I'll walk mine
I will find other ways
To tear my body down

I am staying here with you
I've done all I know to do
They say "stand up straight and take your eyes
Off the wooden floor"
No, I didn't find what I was looking for
Still I had to go
From Fisher Road to Hollywood
Still I had to go
From Fisher Road to Hollywood

They taught some bigger words to me
At the university
Only it's a curse to speak
Without some regard

For the ones I'm talking to
Do I sound like a friend to you
Do we even speak the same
Language anymore

I am staying here with you
I've done all I know to do
They say "stand up straight and take your eyes
Off the ballroom floor"
Of course I didn't find what I was looking for
Still I had to go
From Fisher Road to Hollywood
Still I had to go

Still I had to go
From Fisher Road to Hollywood
