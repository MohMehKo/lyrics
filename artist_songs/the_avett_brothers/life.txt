One comes of it, love it, love it
Let go of it, love comes from it
We're not of this world for long

Faith and promise, keep me honest
When starvation falls upon us
Daylight told me he would be

Gone with cold words spoke among hers
Wretched is the tongue of their world
We're not of that world at all
We will never be

Wouldn't it be fine to stand behind
The words we say in the best of times
Oh, and you and I know all too well
About the hell and paradise right here on earth

Keep it, use it, build it, move it
Claims can't touch how time will prove it
Watch us fly as loud as we can
Let her heartbeat change what I am now

Wouldn't it be fine to stand behind
The words we say in the best of times
Oh, and you and I know all too well
About the hell and paradise right here on earth
