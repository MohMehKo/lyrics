Woah, money won't do the trick
But it will help
Woah, to open the doors we need it to
To help someone else.

Still we won't need it
To turn things around.
I've never been alive, Woah.
I've never been alive, Woah.
I've never been alive like I am now.

Woah, you need only tell me
When you're under the gun.
Woah, if you need someone to lend a hand
Consider it done.

Still you won't need me
To turn things around.
I've never been alive, Woah.
I've never been alive, Woah.
I've never been alive like I am now.
Like I am now.
Like I am now.
Like I am now.
