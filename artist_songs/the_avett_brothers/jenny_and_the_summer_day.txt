What a darling summer time
I have a car, I have a dime
Baby, Baby
I know that won't buy anything
But I would steal you anything
Baby, Baby
The sun is hot, the wind is cool
And we are finally out of school
Baby, Baby
Well I'm in love what can I say
With Jenny and the summer day
Baby, Baby, Baby

What a darling summer time
Come on in the water's fine
Baby, Baby
I know that you're afraid to swim
So I'll stay in the shallow end
Baby, Baby
The sun is hot, the wind is cool
And we are finally out of school
Baby, Baby
Well I'm in love what can I say
The sunlight burned my fear away
Baby, Baby

Ninety and risin'
Soon we'll have to hide out in the shade
Somewhere it's rainin'
And baby I can almost hear you say
That you love me
And the summer day
That you love me

What a darling summer time
I have a home in Carolina
Baby, Baby
Not far from the city lights
But we can see the stars at night
Baby, Baby
The day was hot, tonight is cool
And we are finally out of school
Baby, Baby
Well I'm in love what can I say
With Jenny and the summer day

Ninety and risin'
Soon we'll have to hide out in the shade
Somewhere it's rainin'
And baby I can almost hear you say
That you love me
And the summer day
That you love me
