Well I dreamed of how our life could be, oh yeah
Lovin' and a kissin' 'neath an old oak tree, uh huh
Well I'd be singing you a song that was twenty lines long
And be catchin' sweet kisses you can blow way out to Wyom

I'd work my day to come home to you, oh yeah
You could do whatever you wanted to, uh huh
With you big brown eyes and your curly brown hair
I'm doin' the best I can do just to try to not stare
My God your loveliness

Got a feeling you maybe won't like the news, oh no
Ya ain't going like it when you have to choose, oh no
If you and me were born to never be apart
I can feel it in my mind, I can feel it in my soul, in my heart

Oh baby please come around
Oh baby please come around
Oh baby please come around

Was that your man, he's you fiancee, oh yeah
Another one ties the knot each and everyday, uh huh
I've got to get up the nerve to pick up the phone
It's you sweet mama, I'm a-goin' carry you back home
Way out to Old Wyom

I probably shoulda thought about lettin' you know, uh huh
If I love you like I do I should've told you so, uh huh
Well I think about you each and every day
It's just my knees gettin' weak when I try to say

Oh baby please be mine
Oh baby please be mine
Oh baby please be mine

Got a feelin' I'm barkin' up an empty tree
How could something so beautiful think about me?
I put my tail between my legs and turn my back
Try on my trusty ramblin' sack

I'm off to Old Wyom
I'm off to Old Wyom
I'm off to Old Wyom
