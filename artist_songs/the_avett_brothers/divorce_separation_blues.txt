I'm gonna keep on living
Even though I sometimes do
Fantasize about disappearing
Down in the ocean blue
Just to get some peace and quiet
From the warfare inside my heart
Well I've been under ear-splitting fire
Ever since we've been apart
Well I'm gonna wash the dishes
Pay the bills and watch the news
I've got the tough education
No celebration
Divorce separation blues

Yodel eh hee yodelo lodi lay he yodel lay he

Well I'm gonna keep on waking
And rising up before the sun
And lying in the dark wide awake
When everybody else is done
And sleeping in their beds so peaceful
Dreaming with the love they choose
I've got the tough education
No celebration
Divorce separation blues

Yodel eh hee yodelo lodi lay he yodel lay he

And I'll sign on
The line beneath my name
The road is gone
I can't go back the way we came

Well neither one of us
Really wanna hit the town
We try to keep our friends at bay
Try to keep the gossip down
Well some folks just want the dirt
And don't even care if it's true
But then again who cares who's talking
I'm worried for myself and you

And I'll sign on
The line beneath my name
The road is gone
I can't go back the way we came

They say one of every two
Bound to be set aflame
Every level of resentment
Responsibility and blame
Well now I'm bound to break a promise
One I made to God and you

I've got the tough education
No celebration
Divorce separation blues

I've got the tough education
No celebration
Bad communication
Worse interpretation
Love deprivation
Pain allocation
Soul devastation
Cold desolation
Life complication
Resuscitation
Divorce separation blues

Yodel eh hee, olay hee, olay hee, olay hee
Yodel eh hee yodelo lodi lay he yodel lay he
