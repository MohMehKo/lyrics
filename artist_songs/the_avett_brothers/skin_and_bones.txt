It's the skin and bones that keep me on the road
The shoulderblades of a beast that haunts my soul
Wandering lonely and scared
I live the tragedy I shared

It's quick to drag you in but hard to shake
A kiss that doesn't match how much it takes
Growing stronger and loud
I lived it but now I'm wanting out

I built the fence, I hung the sign
Blood red letters said 'Keep in mind 
Where I been so don't come in'
But how long can you live in shame
And drop a life long curse on your own last name
The trouble is, I'm used to it

It's the questions that keep me turning back
To see those rumors turned to fact
Wandering lonely and scared
I live the tragedy I shared

I built the fence, I hung the sign
Wine red letters said 'Keep in mind 
Where we've been so don't come in'
But how long can we live in shame
And drop a life long curse on your own last names
The trouble is, we're used to it
The trouble is, we're used to it
The trouble is, we're used to it

It's the tin and the board that keep me going home
But it's who I am that won't let me alone
Growing stronger and loud
Growing stronger and loud
Growing stronger and loud
