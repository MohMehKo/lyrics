Things didn't work out like they should,
Farther from how you thought they would
Do you still want my hand?
Do you think I'm still your man?
I'll change everything I can.
Matrimony...

Holy plans and holy gifts
Holy shit what did we get
You said you've got plans of your own
You're gonna work and I'll stay home.
Do you still want my hand?
Do you still think I'm your man?
I'll change everything I can.
Matrimony...

My dog is loud and my dog is wild
We're too young to have a child
Can you keep the dog next week?
I'll be gone the next three.
Do you still want my hand?
Do you still think I'm your man?
I'll change everything I can.
Matrimony...

I ain't through I ain't walking out
Leaving ain't what I'm about,
You may scream and I may shout.
But baby I love you.
