If I had known, your heart was down
That lonely day in Greenville town
Then I would have been more concerned
But later on I truly learned
How it can feel in every bone
To really see you're all alone

But I'll kiss your head
When death finds your bed
And you are gone

And if I had seen,the way it would be
I'd hushed your cries, when you came to me
If I could do what I did to you
The same to me that I would love for you to see
That I sleep with remorse
And regret hangs round my door...
For ever more.

If I had known the lowering tide
Was lowering with the way you felt inside
If I had known all hope was gone
A broken heart and a broken home
That pierced, my lover's past
And carved a lonely path...
For her to walk

So if ever someone one says to you,
Life isn't fair, get used to it
Then you should say 'Well it might be
If folks like you would let it be"

But I'll kiss your head
When death becomes my bed
And I am gone
