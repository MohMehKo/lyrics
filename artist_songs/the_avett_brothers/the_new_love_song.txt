Elegant and soft
Feminine as you ought
One with earth and one with God
Won't you please forgive me

As the daylight sinks
As I fail to stop and think
Once I cursed the things I've done
Won't you please forgive me
Won't you please forgive me

Young bride take my name
Burn the questions burn the shame
You don't have to live by them
Won't you please forgive them
Won't you please forgive them
Won't you please forgive them
Won't you please forgive them
Won't you please forgive them
Won't you please forgive them

Sleep well when the night time falls
Wait 'till morning when I call
Don't believe the bad you saw
Won't you please forgive them

Tenderness and grace
How you've come to change this place
However dangerous or safe
I'll find within you
I'll find within you
I'll find within you
I'll find within you
I'll find within you
I'll find within you
