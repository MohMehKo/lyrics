Somebody get my shotgun
Somebody get my blade
Sally's been layin' with another man
And he's sleeping in my place
Somebody get my shotgun
Gonna shoot him sure as rain
You can run as fast as you want to boy
I'll kill you just the same

Somebody get my pocket blade
Gonna cut him don't you know
You can try to hide all you want to boy
There ain't nowhere to go
Somebody get my shotgun
Somebody get my blade
Sally's been layin' with another man
And he's sleeping in my place

Now Sally don't go thinkin'
That you got off so clean
I'd kill you too if I had the nerve
But I just ain't that mean
So I go and get my murder tools
I throw them in the lake
Gonna steal me an automobile
And drive so far away
Now I am a fugitive
I'm always on the run
Sally told the policeman
Exactly what I'd done
I went and got my shotgun
I went and got my blade
Killed poor Sally's lover
And I put him in the grave.

Now all you ramblin' fellas
You listen close to me
That woman gonna bring you pain
Your heart is gonna bleed
But it ain't worth the trouble
The sufferin' or the grief
A bleeding heart is better than the penitentiary
I killed Sally's lover
One dark and dreary day
Sally got another
And I got sent away
Somebody get my shotgun
Somebody get my blade
Sally's been laying with another man
And I set him in his grave
