(Timbaland, David Guetta, Mister World Wide... Here we go!)

Everybody on the dance floor give it up
Baby put it down and give it up
Nigga, set the floor and take it up
Baby, put it down and give it up

Everybody on the dance floor give it up
Baby put it down and give it up
Nigga, set the floor and take it up
Baby, put it down and give it up

[Verce 1 - Pitbull:]
So listen a couple girls
Who was in and now I mess with cover girls
Of magazines, you can catch me on a cover, girl
I created my own planet to hover the earth and cover the world
I spit so sick, I'm calling the world
I see you tryna claim her now I play with her pearls
They try to come at me but all of 'em sterile
[?] but I made her my girl
Now she does what I say, does what I please
No she's not religious but she lives on her knees
Jack and Jill went up the hill
Each with a buck and a quarter
Jill came back with $2.50... What a working girl!
Now work it, girl! Like...

[Chorus - Timbaland:]
Hey girl, I like to do it, with all that booty, oh oh my God
Hey girl, I like to do it, with all that booty, oh oh my God
Oh oh my God, oh oh my God, oh oh my God, I like to do it
I love when you make a pass at me, a pass at me
I love when you make a pass at me, a pass at me

[Bridge - Timbaland:]
I love when I see your pretty ass on the floor
I like when I see you break it down like you in control

[Verse 2 - Pitbull:]
I've got a cup to my right and a cup to my left
I'm stumbling and I'm out of breath
'Cause I'm g-g-g-g-ggg-gone
'Cause I'm g-g-g-g-ggg-gone
I got a girl to my right and a girl to my left
The one in the middle and I'm feeling on her breasts
'Cause I'm g-g-g-g-ggg-gone
'Cause I'm g-g-g-g-ggg-gone

[Chorus - Timbaland]

[Bridge - Timbaland]

I love when you make a pass at me, a pass at me
I love when you make a pass at me, a pass at me
