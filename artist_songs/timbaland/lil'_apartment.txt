Let's go.

We hustle in a lil old apartment, with all the windows blacked out
I'd put it on the 'hood if you cost me
I'm a have to pull the straps out
You don't know nothin about me
You just been running your mouth
Instead of telling hoes when you see me, you gonna take me out
I'm a real nigga, come and give me hope
I'm a real nigga, come and give me hope
I'm a real nigga, come and give me hope
I'm a real nigga, come and give me hope

Hey, you old pussy-assed frontin' and snitchin'-assed nigga
Ran up on you 'bercrome and put a Barrett on your temple
Got a sawed up and opened fire with me nigga
Ready to get a crack and come and ride with me nigga
I'll put some change on your head
Get it nigga they kill you while you layin' in the bed
Hey we can bring this on the floor
Get you sleepin' then do the same thing to your whore
Got a chip on my shoulder, it's getting heavy as hell
All the nigga had to do was pay for my meal
We used to be down as hell
Snitchin'-ass nigga sent me to the county jail
You shouldna lied to me dog, I would rather kill and go down and die for my dog
And I'm a right for my niggas
They 'duce an attitude and pay atten

We hustle in a lil old apartment, with all the windows blacked out
I'd put it on the 'hood if you cost me
I'm a have to pull the straps out
You don't know nothin about me
You just been running your mouth
Instead of telling hoes when you see me, you gonna take me out
I'm a real nigga, come and give me hope
I'm a real nigga, come and give me hope
I'm a real nigga, come and give me hope
I'm a real nigga, come and give me hope

Hey scary-ass, fake-ass, sucker-ass, shithole
I got plans, you wonder, find your ass in the river
Bobba you're going fat in the middle
Especially when your ass's being hunted by a killer
Yeh homie you know what they say, I'm gonna catch your mo'fo's ass one of these days
I'm gonna let loose with one of these K's
Your momma or your bigger momma's momma ain't safe
I did some shoppin around about a couple of days
Now I'm lookin for yo regular ass, esplanade
I wish I coulda do it back in the days, but you was a bitch-ass nigga the whole-ass ways

You shouldna hated on me dog
If I call it talkin, you should be sayin it to me dog
I keep in so much debt, you look up on me on the hill is where you find me yet

We hustle in a lil old apartment, with all the windows blacked out
I'd put it on the 'hood if you cost me
I'm a have to pull the straps out
You don't know nothin about me
You just been running your mouth
Instead of telling hoes when you see me, you gonna take me out
I'm a real nigga, come and give me hope
I'm a real nigga, come and give me hope
I'm a real nigga, come and give me hope
I'm a real nigga, come and give me hope

Pussy-assed sucker-assed broad-assed nigga
Runnin' your mouth cos you're a broad-assed nigga
I look in your face and see hokay
Niggas it's hard to shake, they stay in your wake
But I move with smooth pace
Give a ruck about a case, put a black in your face
Until my mission complete I don't cease
How the fuck you gonna shit on my name in these streets,
Supplied the hustle, I'll put the muscle
Got niggas on standby and they ready to touch
They ain't fuckin with you, bitch, straight to the face
No shit's left on the scene, just no body to trace
After you checkin in, they given the win
How long you got left, it really depends
You don't know which way to go, and you're struck outta breath
That's what motherfucker's get for not checking their shit

We hustle in a lil old apartment, with all the windows blacked out
I'd put it on the 'hood if you cost me
I'm a have to pull the straps out
You don't know nothin about me
You just been running your mouth
Instead of telling hoes when you see me, you gonna take me out
I'm a real nigga, come and give me hope
I'm a real nigga, come and give me hope
I'm a real nigga, come and give me hope
I'm a real nigga, come and give me hope

Yo, it's over
