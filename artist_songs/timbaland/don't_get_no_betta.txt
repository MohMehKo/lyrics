[Verse 1 - Timbaland:]
Champagne kinda night
All the way turning, coming down
Everything coming right
Can't nothing hold us down
I got you all in
Drunk, tripping off the sound
True you came here to get down

[Pre-Chorus - Timbaland:]
I dig the vibe that you feeling
Girl and I'm feeling it
Forget tomorrow let's live in night

[Chorus - Timbaland:]
This could last forever
We can go whatever
Oh it don't get no better
It don't get no better
Oh it don't get no better
It don't get no better

[Verse 2 - Mila J:]
It don't get no better
It don't get no better
It don't get no better
Champagne kinda night
All the way I know turn it down
Everything feeling right
Me and my girls we own the town
You got me all bad
Super faded off the ground
All that I give it get down

[Pre-Chorus - Timbaland & Mila J:]
I dig the vibe that you feeling
Boy and I'm feeling it
Forget tomorrow let's live in night

[Chorus - Timbaland & Mila J:]
This could last forever
We can go whatever
Oh it don't get no better
It don't get no better
Oh it don't get no better
It don't get no better

[Outro:]
This is fab
This is fab
It don't get no better
It don't get no better
It don't get no better
It don't get no better
It don't get no better
It don't get no better
It don't get no better
It don't get no better
