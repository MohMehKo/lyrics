'Scuse me. Do you mind if I sit down?
Is it okay if I sit down here?
No? Are you alone?
(Come on, man!)

Lady! (Uh-huh)
Well, I'm back!
You gotta want me now. Outside. (Uh-huh)

I see your luck is changing. Is it not?
You got your headlights out
In the dark.

Well don't be crashin' now
Or pull a fast one now
So watch your traction now
I gotta know right now

Because I'm in love
I'm in love
With you
I'm in love, I'm in love
With you, yeah

I'm in love, I'm in love
With you
I'm in love, I'm in love
With you

Git it, git it, git it, girl! Hey!
Git it, git it, git it, girl! Hey!
Come on to me!

Lady! (Uh-huh)
Before you come back
Misbehavin'
You might want to think about that

Slippin' out your lane
Git your [?] in check
You a warning (Yeah)
I want to be dangerous

So don't be laughing now
Or pull a fast one now (Go real slow)
So watch your traction now (Off the road)
I got to know right now

Because I'm in love
I'm in love with you.
I'm in love, I'm in love
With you.
Yeah, I'm in love, I'm in love
With you.
(Hey, hey, hey)
I'm in love, I'm in love
With you.

Git it, git it, git it, girl!
Hey!
Git it, git it, git it, girl!
Hey!
(Come on, now!)

When I look in your face
It's when I lose control
What I see in your eyes
Is what is burning my soul

And I know that it's true
'Cause when you're saying my name
And no, I won't forget you girl
Because I'm saying it again

I'm in love I'm in love with you.
I'm in love I'm in love with you.
(Give it all you have) Yeah

I'm in love I'm in love with you.
You drive me crazy
I'm in love I'm in love with you.

Because I'm in love I'm in love with you.
I can't take it.
I'm in love I'm in love with you.
You know, yeah.
I'm in love I'm in love with you.
You drive me crazy
I'm in love I'm in love with you.
I'm in love
Git it, git it, git it, girl!

Ah, hey!
Git it, git it, git it, girl! Hey!
Come on now!
