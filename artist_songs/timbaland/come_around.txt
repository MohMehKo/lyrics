In a faraway land we got shit made, 
RayBan shades, warheads laid 
babes born in air-raids 
My girls roam the Everglades, 
Indian tribesman gamble spades,, 
Indian chicks, they get men laid. 
Milk and honey smoke high-grade, 
gold and diamond gems and jades, 
ride up on our tanks, invade , 
blow out things to save our name and, 
Mina, Rina, Tina, Sophina 
bein a super Indian babe 
We black market we black mane 
we hit shit out when it rains 
Would you come down and catch my train? 
Would you run down and play this game?

Baby girl, you and me need to go to your teepee. 
The moon is full, and I'm shining. 
Baby, I know you see me. 
Put a hump or two on your back just like that, oh girl you're on fire. 
I don't wanna be in love with you 
I'ma just break you off and say goodbye. 
The night is young. Don't make me wait, 
you just might miss your chance. 
I'm gon' tell you the truth 
Timbaland, I'm the motherfuckin man. 
Today's the day, girl, let me get that. 
Don't get mad. 
In fact, let me hit that. 
I've been overkilling them, I break backs. 
Come down, run down, 
girl where your place at?
