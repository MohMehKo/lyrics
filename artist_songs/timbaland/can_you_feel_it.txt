Ooh Snap, my head throbbin' 
As I ride in my 3 4 8 mobbin' 
Listen to the Buddha Brothers 
6 to 10 there ain't no other 

Playin' my favorite jams 
On 1 0 3 Jams 
I got my man Big D, Big Rodney 
In case somebody want to rob me 

We going to Military Circle 
Virginia's tight that's why they gotta keep a curfew 
It's time to get something to eat 
Oh snap, there's my man Kumbalee 

And my girl Missy 
Who she role wit? Who she be wit? 
Who she role wit? Who she be wit? 
Total, Da Brat, Lil' Kim, Lil Cease and Puffy

Jimmy D turn my scale up 
Give me that boom da boom whaer 
It's time to change my style, my rhythm 
My ism, my prism, my beat manurism 

Gee, where's my lack of fear? 
My five-thousand and one gear 
Missy baby you oughtta hear 
Like next year, your album bigger there each day 
It rolls like a queen size water bed, uh 

The people in the label's chillin' 
As Timbaland is making a big killin'

Oooh, I'm on my last verse 
As you can see I did not curse 
I'm trying to make it radio friendly, uh 
So people in America can hear me, uh 

To all beautiful boys and girls 
White, diamonds and pearls, no jerry curls, uh 
I hope you buy our tape 
Please don't hesitate, don't hesitate, what?
