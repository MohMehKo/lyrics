[Intro:]
Mike, Timbo, Let's go
Great day for a White Wedding,
It's a great day for a White Wedding,
It's a great day for a White Wedding,
It's a great day for a White Wedding,
It's a great day for a White Wedding,

[Verse 1:]
Raving! Is what we do best (but I got this)
Craving! For the bass drum beating down my chest (but I love)
The World! Timbaland is the man that caters to it (I can't forget)
All Girls! Do what you do do best (and that is)

[Hook:]
Move that body, move that, Move that body, move that,
Move that body, m-move that body, move that
Move that body, move that, Move that body, move that,
Move that body, move... (here we go!)

[Chorus:]
Pump your fist up now, make your love to the sound!
Scream 'til you break your vocal chords!
Now let me hear it,
a-wayo-wayo, a-wayo-wayo, uh-uh, a-wayo-wayo
I love when I hear it,
a-wayo-wayo, a-wayo-wayo, uh-uh

[Verse 2:]
(Heart-Beat) Raising! No sleep, no rest
Crazy! Is what we 'bout to get (I think you need to)
Take Note! Because I'm not finished yet (I'm talkin' to)
All Girls! Do what you do do best (and that is)

[Hook:]
Move that body, move that, Move that body, move that,
Move that body, m-move that body, move that
Move that body, move that, Move that body, move that,
Move that body, move... (here we go!)

[Chorus:]
Pump your fist up now, make your love to the sound!
Scream 'til you break your vocal chords!
Now let me hear it,
a-wayo-wayo, a-wayo-wayo, uh-uh, a-wayo-wayo
I love when I hear it,
a-wayo-wayo, a-wayo-wayo, uh-uh

[Outro:]
I love when I hear it,
I love when I hear it,
I love when I hear it,
I love when I hear it,
a-wayo-wayo, a-wayo-wayo, uh-uh
