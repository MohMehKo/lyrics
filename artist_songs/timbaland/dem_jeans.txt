Girl, what's your sign? I pull up right on time
She don't fuck with broke niggas. You said on the sideline
Back your ass up. Whip that booty, and we ridin'
I just want to see what's in 'em jeans like genuine
What's in 'em jeans? (What's in 'em jeans?) What's in 'em jeans? (What's in 'em jeans?)
Bay, you make that booty bend like trampoline (boing, boing)
What's in 'em jeans? (What's in 'em jeans?) What's in 'em jeans? (What's in 'em jeans?)
All my pretty girls scream "Pretty Gang" (pretty)

Broke boys always talking 'bout
How many hoes they fuck, how many bitches they got (how many)
But we really wanna know how many coins you got (how many)
If you talking 'bout your rap, how many songs you got? (hey)
This for my bitches, all my bad bitches
Only if you independent and after your riches
She a old lady got a young nigga in the corner
Young nigga hit it right and smoked that good marijuana
[?] everybody want her
I think I like her persona, Victoria's Secret aroma
Late night at the [?], I took her home and I bone her
She screwed up in the Corolla, got her drunk of Coronas
Jewelry colder than Polar, I'm high like the Solar
She took it more than Oprah, make it clap like [?]
It's the first time you seen her, and she act like she know ya
That's her motive, she burst that wallet open. So I had to ask her

Asked her what's her sign. She told me, "Gemini"
I told her, "Girl, you lying. That's the same sign as mine"
But anyway [?] back to the subject, "You fine"
[?]
And she don't like broke boys. Broke boys ain't making no noise
Walk around with a check like Floyd. She licking at me looking gorgeous
Pinky ring the size of orbit. Broke boys can't afford it
Look in my pockets on Orbit. I'm a [?] Morgan (Morgan Freeman)
Man, you can go to my mansion. It got six storeys (get lost)
Hop in the Lam' and drop the top like the Headless Horseman
Telling me stories I heard [?]
Honestly, I can care less, baby, that ain't important (no)
I like how them jeans look tight, they show your panties (I like it)
Walking in the club got these broke boys panic
When she [?] people turn to a mannequin (silent)
She done killed the whole club. Call the ambulance
