Timothy I took your place
Timothy cuz such a waste
Timothy we found your spaceship
Timothy its the farthest you've ever flown

Put your lighters up
Put your lighters up ya'll (ya'll)
Put your lighters up
This the Timothy song if ya don't bout me

Ya they call me Tim
VA's phenomenon
I kill em all winter
Until the summer come
From just another name
All the way to number one
And I'm simply the best
When its all said and done
Remember when me and Magoo was tryin to make a meal
Well we did
And years later we got it still
Gave you my bio
Under construction 1 and 2
Hundred percent genuine
That was from me to you
I'm makin moves while they ridicule
I'm like a warm summer breeze in the swimmin pool
I'm cool
I never kept it basic
I been so many places
Been gettin money since them honeys had them small faces
So many little me's
I can hear small traces
But I just ignore it
Cuz I'm too big for it
And I can hear 'em screamin (screamin)

Timothy where have you been
It's not what it seems but it is
Timothy where have you been
She cried in the kitchen to let you go
Timothy where have you been

I been in Athens, Georgia by way of Bubba Sparxx
When the nights was bright
And all the days was dark
But now they all bright
Everything is all right
If you assumin life was wonderful
Then you alright
I got a bad wife
3 beautiful kids
I make the world dance
Ya look what I done did
Here's for Jay-Z
Nelly Furtado
Catch up
Ya'll slow
Escargot
Nelly your 14 mil
Where's Fargo?
I brought a airplane
Fuck I need a car for?
Ask Justin Timberlake is Timbaland great
Ya'll gotta deal wit me
No handshake
Stand up Nigga
Rather have a stand off
Wit the law before I let 'em say I ran off
And I can hear 'em screamin

Timothy where have you been
Its not what it seems but it is
Timothy where have you been
She cried in the kitchen to let you go
Timothy where have you been

Hey some say I run away
But really I never left
They wonder where I been
But they can never guess
I been around the world
Here to the other side
And I successfully achieved what all those others tried
Carry my city on my back
Like a crucifix
For more than a decade
Cuz I can do this shit
A lot of people want my spot
But I don't hesitate
The track label by legacy
Won't appreciate
I stand strong
Everything I put my hands on
Me and Mr. I-Be
Cuz ain't no I in team
Cuz I can hear 'em sayin

Timothy where have you been
Its not what it seems but it is
Timothy where have you been
She cried in the kitchen to let you go
Timothy where have you been
Timothy where have you been
She cried in the kitchen to let you go
Where have you been
Timothy where have you been
