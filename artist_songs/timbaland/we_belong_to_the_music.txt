C'mon Y'all, C'mon Y'all, C'mon Y'all,
Put Yo' hands out
Miley, Miley, Miley...

I'm gonna put on my dancing shoes
And find a crazy outfit
'cause tonight it's all about you
I can't wait to show you all my new moves
I got a brand new 2 step
You gonna like this outfit
I got y'all right here
no need for you to go anywhere
turn it up until you can't rock anymore
Mr. DJ, look at what you made me do out on da floor
That's what we say

[Chorus:]
Hey, Hey
We belong to da music
We don't answer to you
Hey, Hey
That's right we ain't moving
we don't answer to you
It's a party we can dance if we want to
C'mon and party like it ain't no curfew
Hey, Hey
We belong to da music
We don't answer to you

I'm gonna call up my friends
Gonna have a good time
It's sure to be crazy
Tonight, it's all about us
Feeling real good can you blame me

I got a brand new hairdo
With my brand new attitude
You can tell me aint nothing to hide
I'm laughin out I'm tellin you
tellin you
turn it up until you can't rock anymore
Mr. DJ, look at what you made me do out on da floor
That's what we say

[Chorus]
Hey, Hey
We belong to da music
We don't answer to you
Hey, Hey
That's right we ain't moving
we don't answer to you
It's a party we can dance if we want to
C'mon and party like it ain't no curfew
Hey, Hey
We belong to da music
We don't answer to you

What's your sayin now

People in the party can't get enough

What's Your sayin now
People keep on dancin till the sun comes up

[Chorus]
Hey, Hey

It's a party we can dance if we want to
C'mon and party like it ain't no curfew
Hey, Hey
We belong to da music
We don't answer to you
