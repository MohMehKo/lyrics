All I wanna do is, all I wanna do is make up
All I wanna do is...make up
All I wanna do is...make up
All I wanna do is...make up
All I wanna do is...make up
All I wanna do is...make up 
Put the, put the past behind us

All I wanna do is, all I wanna do is, all I wanna do is make up
All I wanna do is...make up
All I wanna do is...make up
All I wanna do is...make up
All I wanna do is...make up
All I wanna do is...make up 
Put the, put the past behind us

[Sebastian]
Broken promises, broken wedding vows
The clock is ticking down
Hoping daddy'll crack a smile
How can I support a child
Last time I had a job, It's been a while
The question remain so freely
Why does it have to happen to me?
To wash away the pain of drinking, Im thinking..

[Chad Kroeger]
Im waiting for the day that, together we could find another way back, 
Put everything we've got in stake lets worry about today 
And put tomorrow in a bottle. (bottle)

If theres some way that
We can take back the wrong that we created we can change that,
Dont turn your head the other way 
Your born to save today. 
Put tomorrow in a bottle
Lets put tomorrow in a bottle (bottle) [x8]

[Sebastian]
Ohhh, Girl, you ain't right
I apologise
Wont be satisfied till what we had was gone away
Hey, Hey every other day we doesnt fight
And I take it two wrongs dont make a right
You had my head gone
I had you dead wrong
Thinking that same old song
Wondering why you mad at me, me
Now you gotta understand my lingo
....
Baby This is how it should be (hey!)
Are you gonna do me like that?
Your both supposed to have my back, back [x4]
And we both dont know how to act
Wasnt a lead by the door ....

[Chorus]

[Chad Kroeger]
Im waiting for the day that, together we could find another way back, 
Put everything we've got in stake lets worry about today 
And put tomorrow in a bottle. (bottle)

If theres some way that
We can take back the wrong that we created we can change that,
Dont turn your head the other way 
Your born to save today. 
Put tomorrow in a bottle
Lets put tomorrow in a bottle (bottle) [x8]

...that I never thought at all the love we had would go away
Put your back against the wall

I was your bread and butter
Like girl
Why was the relationship so down
Like we established the fact
That you were so strong to get
I wont go spreading my ex
From Tallahassee and back

Chad gonna sing the rest!!

[Chorus]
