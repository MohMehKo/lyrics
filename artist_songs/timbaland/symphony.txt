Ay, I was mean 
Before I became a feen
I took over the world
When they gave me a beat machine
And then I made my city jump, jump
Who's your favorite producer?
Come on baby, let it bump, bump
I'm like a music cyclone when I'm in the zone
A typhoon every time I can hold a song
A tycoon, I just went and brought another home
Who you stunting on? I'm never off
I set it off like you was never home
Was dedicated, bop bop
Lit up my way, bounce bounce
Anyway I want, private jet, get it out
Will bread do? You know what Tim about?
Ferrari 599, windows tinted out
I, I, I'm the man, my, my beats is crazy
You want the sound, freaky freaky you gotta pay me 
But don't get it confused
Never had no silver spoon
But you gotta long walk
Try and fit Timbaland's shoes
And next up

[D.O.E (Timbaland):]
I'm a lead that's me (ay, what's your name?)
D.O.E on the M.I.C  (and where you from?)
N.Y.C, make a billion G 

[Timbaland (D.O.E):]
Why don't you get on the mic
For the symphony (Okay, okay)

[D.O.E:]
When you see me walk through, got the whole crew
Timbaland, he produced, if you're a fruit, produce
Riding it in the old school
Living like I'm old school
She french kissed my neck 
And then I told her merci voux cou
Put it in your bag, no baby I ain't fat
When I fuck you it's a wrap
I'm a put you in the cab
Better be happy I rap
If I wasn't I'd be trapped with the mass
And I, and I'm coming for your stash
When I find out where you at
I'll be shimmying your lock
Get the fuck up out your bed
You better give me what you got
Want your money, money, money, money
Blind like there's no money, oh gotta go money
And his pocket's fully drained
And he's back to nothing change

[Timbaland:]
And I'd wish he'd come run up on me
He gone find that he'd done made the wrong move

[D.O.E:]
I ain't changed, still the same
D.O.E be the name
I'm from north side queens
Next up

[Bran'Nu (D.O.E):]
Ha, ay yo, believe that's me 
(And what's your name?) Bran'Nu A.K.A Brandy
(And where you from?) Mississippi 
But was raised in Cali

[D.O.E (Bran'Nu):]
Why don't you get on the mic
For the symphony (I got it, I got it ha)

[Bran'Nu:]
It's been a long time coming, I'm back
Like I forgot something important
Hey, have a problem with me?
I've faded to black like church slacks
Now I'm in a range, no Cadillac
So you don't want it with me
I'm on the tip of your tongue like bubble gum
I got you head strung
It's my return like the kingdom come
I'm taking off like a rocket
I got this beat in my pocket
I keep your heart dropping (Bran'Nu)
Never gonna hold me back
Timbo put me on the map
Now you wanna say I act brand new
Just like my Pradda boots
Strutting like a model do
Don't you wish you had another chance to
Get up under my skin
Fronting like you getting in it
You keep running your mouth like them frogs do
I gotta learn, you like a school dude
Cause clearly you don't have a clue
So next up

[Attitude (Bran'Nu):]
Yeah, ay yo believe that's me
(And what's your name?) Attitude on the M.I.C
(And where you from?) Alabama be the bigger G

[Bran'Nu (Attitude):]
And why don't you get on the mic
For the symphony (okay)

[Attitude:]
All this dope shit never mediocre
Plenty bread so you know I gotta keep a toaster
On my side, pride leashing, it's over
Come to fly to drive, I'm a need a chauffeur
I get a whole lot of, like a G's supposed to
They can put me in the fed for what's in my sofa
Rap, wait, smack 'em if they say a part
Diss me, I'll put the ratchet
On you and your fading heart
I know that man never thought that it could happen
Got my shit on and then I hoped in the Aspen
Every chick I cash in, bigger pain in the ass and
Better new freak, she thicker then the last one
Naw I ain't never homie, music is my passion
I ain't show compassion at all, I be fucking
Yelling I'm the shit, if you with nobody's asking
Oh I'm on fire like the shit in the ass man
That's why I stay soaked on player
Like how we are fucking up the ozone layer
I drop a hit every time I got some shit to say
And If I miss I come back like a ricochet
