[Verse 1:]
A ain't got no filling,
I'm gonna let these niggas know,
I've been killing 'em with these beats,
Now I'm spitting them killer flows,
What you know about me, dog?
Not a damn thing,
Gotta problem you can see me in the streets dog,
I'm on one-man game,
Don't take this lightly,
If a want you dead it's done,
I can make that happen because,
Nigga my bread is long,
I've done been both sides of the tracks,
you can say I trained the game,
A lot of niggas tryna get in my lane,
Everybody asking me the same old thing (what they say)

[Chorus (x8):]
Oh Timbaland,
Where he go run to?
(nowhere)

[Verse 2:]
I ain't going nowhere, dog,
I'm gonna be right here in your face,
Can't do it like me dog,
your kick drum ain't got enough bass,
Don't ever talk bad about me,
you just might make me mad,
And I just might see you somewhere,
And brake your ass in half,
It's nothing but Timbaland in the you strip,

Now I'm in a whole nother zone,
you can let me do me,
you can do you,
Oh, get popped in your door,
Hit love on the verge to the block,
So recognize the game,
Timbaland ain't gonna run mowhere, baby,
Timbaland got private planes.

[Chorus x8]

[Verse 3:]
I've been around,
Sometime long ago,
I've seen the life,
Don't act like you ain't seen it before.

I'm listening, dog,
you ain't saying shit,
you can keep on wishing,
you never make a hit,
Yeah, I got money,
Take it all from me,
I'm gonna be the same,
you can get a few whips,
you can get a few chips,
you still gonna be a lame,
We ain't the same, my nigga,
I'm on some other shit,
I'm gonna say this plain and simple,
Nigga, take this punishment,
I'm gonna take you all on a trip,
I'm gonna take you all on a ride,
And one day I'm gonna dip, but I won't be hard to find.
