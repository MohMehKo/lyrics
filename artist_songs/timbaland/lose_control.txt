You know my girl get the keys with the em's on it
She have the range night, I'm in a benz mornin
Bought plenty of ice for them shinin on your friends moments
I'll give her anything she want if it look good on her
And we be chillin like a bottle sittin on the rocks
Shoppin bags full of cartier forget-me-nots
But money can't buy you love, baby that's a fact
But you can rent some love with a couple stacks
Man I gotta lease nothin, I own one
And everytime I hit, she say it's a home run
When asked how can we be serious at so young
I just say I'm in it for the long run

We're talkin bout my baby
Cause we always breakin the mold
Talkin bout my baby
We don't need no secret code
The way you love me down
Got me goin around
I think, I think, I think I'm losin control
The way you love me down
Got me goin around
I think, I think, I think I'm losin control
The way you love me, eh eh
The way you love me, eh eh
The way you love me, eh eh
I think, I think, I think I'm losin control
