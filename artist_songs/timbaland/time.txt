[Timbaland:]
I Got A Feeling She Keeps Me In The Dark
I Gotta Get Keep My Eye On Her She Ain't no Walk In The Park
I'd Offer This But She Want That She She She Want It All
You See She Wanted To Paint The Picture And Say She My Broad
I Got A Little Tip From Word On The Block People Saying I Shouldn't Get Involved
But I Don' Judge Or Try To change It 'Cause You Are Who You Are
I'm Like The Drug She's Addicted To Me She Can't Leave Me Now
She Always Making Plans To Date... come and find me tomorrow goodbye girl

[Chorus (She Wants Revenge):]
She's too invested in the hours That Pass Her By
I'd Pay Attention If I Thought It Was Worth The Time
I tell her easy but Her Hands They Find A Way
Confusing Passion For the love he never gave
Fall Back On Reasons That We Know Won't Stand A Chance
Watching Our Shoulders Like A Memory From The Past
I tell her easy but Her Hands They Find A Way
Confusing Passion For the love he never gave

[Timbaland:]
I Couldn't Get Rid Of Shawty If Wanted
Cause She Was Down But I Was Tired Of Playing The Role Like I Ain't Know That She Get Around
Something About This Girl Fascinates Me She's The Type That Likes To Hang With The Stars
The Way She Makes Me Feel And Sedates Me Who Knew We Would Take It This Far
Everywhere That I Try To Go She got a wanted poster With My Face On It
Soon As I Walk Out The Door There It Is wanted poster with my face on it
Can't Blame My Self And It's Not My Fault 'Cause Nothing Was Promised At Least I Could Say I
Was Honest But Bye Girl

[Chorus]
