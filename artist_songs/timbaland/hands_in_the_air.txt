Dance all night
I said dance all night

Hey baby girl
Lookin' all done up
I wanna know
Where did you come from?
The heat begins to raise
Hot woman
The club's about to go into flames and
The speakers thumpin'
Let's party hard
And just move something
The vibe is right and it goes-goes-goes somethin'-somethin' like this

Such a beautiful crowd, level's on ten
People standing on chairs
With their hands up in the air
Girls gettin' real wild
Hair blowin' in the wind
Girls standing on chairs
With their hands up in the air [x9]

High heels standing on them soft couch cushions
Careful not to break your concentration
Maintain sexy as she maintains balance, balance
If you fall, baby girl it won't be cute at all, at all
Drink in your left hand, left hand
Girlfriend in your right, your right
On the couch dancin', dancin'
Holdin' on for dear life, life
Thump of the music plus flash of the lights plus
Long legs and a short skirt equal one hell of a night I'm talking 'bout

Such a beautiful crowd, level's on ten
People standing on chairs
With their hands up in the air
Girls gettin' real wild
Hair blowin' in the wind
Girls standing on chairs
With their hands up in the air [x9]

I got my eyes closed
Jumpin' up and down baby I'm on ten
I got my eyes closed
Listen' to the sounds so hypnotizing
Hey
And I bet before the night ends
Hey
I'm gon' find one that I'm liking
Take her home, get on next morning
Baby girl, gimme that one more thing before you go

I got my eyes closed [x3]

Such a beautiful crowd, level's on ten
People standing on chairs
With their hands up in the air
Girls gettin' real wild
Hair blowin' in the wind
Girls standing on chairs
With their hands up in the air [x9]
