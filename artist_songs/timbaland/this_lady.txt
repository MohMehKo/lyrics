[Verse 3:]
Now this lady, hell of fine, slipping rock-child, that's a hell of a one,
Re-Re-cuss with the vibe design, new lace-front like the Keyshia grind,
I swear, I'm an unborn baby, these bottles is fuckin' crazy,
Getting booked off of a bottle of bailey, she hit the club like fuck you pay me,
Get off her drug, broads with balls, hold up boss!?
Never seen it all, her name mentions up in the gossip blogs,
This lady, got a lady, booty baby, mercedes...

She's one of a kind, blows my mind,
What a hell of lady! What a hell of lady!
(And I say) She's one of a kind, blows my mind,
What a hell of lady! What a hell of lady!
(And I say) She's one of a kind, blows my mind,
What a hell of lady! What a hell of lady!
(And I say) She's one of a kind, blows my mind,
What a hell of lady! What a hell of lady!

[Bridge:]
