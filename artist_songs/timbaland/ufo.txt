[Hook: Timbaland & Future]
I think my girl might be cheating on the low
She say she need her space and she say she need to go
Oh man, I think my girl might be cheating on the low
I really hate to say it, but tonight I need to know
Need to know, are you fucking other niggas? UFO, UFO
Are you fucking other niggas? UFO, UFO
Are you fucking other niggas? UFO, UFO
I think my girl might be cheating...UFO, UFO

[Verse 1: Timbaland (Tink)]
She say she want somebody she can talk to
I always say I will but I never do
She say she need somebody she can count on
And when she dial my number, I don't pick it up
Alright, alright, girl
Now I gotta catch my flight
Alright, alright, girl
I can't be that somebody
Every day she say she find somebody and it ain't me
And I'm getting the feeling that she finna creep
(Boy give me a call back)
That's what the message said
That shit stuck in my head
She said I never did
(Boy give me a call back)
She could be in his arms
She 'bout to break my heart
She 'bout to break my heart

Are you fucking other niggas? UFO, UFO
Are you fucking other niggas? UFO, UFO

[Verse 2: Tink]
He could be alone with a dancer
Hear it in his tone when he answer
Four or five hoes in a week
But if I go out to cheat
Then I have no standards
But for tonight I'mma leave
Find me someone in these streets
Frequent them slowly and not feel emotion
Cause he would do the same to me no doubt
So I'mma get even, I never believed in you telling me a lie
I'mma get busy and find me a nigga to lay with tonight
Pimpin' ain't nothing but game, treat all these hoes the same
Niggas and women, we all lie about how we living
We all lie about where we staying
We all lie about who we laying, we all do
We all lie about who we cuffing
We all lie about who we fucking, we all do
Baby don't worry about me, I be on the run like B
You ain't gotta hide your face cause I'm probably in the room right next to your suite

[Verse 3: Future]
Where your heart went? you must lost it in a coffin, hey-ey-ey
I'm smoking, taking me loses, I can't cry about you, no way-ay-ay
I'm a player but it caught me off guard, I'mma say-ay-ay
Bitches donâ€™t cheat on niggas this rich, bitch you must be misfit
I'm drinking fucking up my kidney, you got me going ballistic
Don't tell me you kissing niggas with my favorite lipstick
Not my bitch
Mamacita, no love lost, used to moving them drugs only
Where young nigga sorry they come back and run up in your drug house
You lying bitch, who you lying to, tell me who you lying to
You rather tainted my impression, how I look at you, how I honor you
We spent days up, I'm just thinking, did you get laid up?
Talking and conversating, I hoping you tell me the truth
I thought I was bulletproof, until I found out a clue
You might be fucking him and him and every brother around this bitch
I never knew until I thought I knew
He can't fuck you like me any way, you must be getting back at me
Maybe my mind's playing tricks on
I'm feeling guilty cause these hoes on me
