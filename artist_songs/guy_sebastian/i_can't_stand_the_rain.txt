I can't stand the rain 
Against my window 
Bringing back sweet memories  

Hey window pane 
Do you remember 
How sweet it used to be 
When we walk together 
Everything was so grand 
Now that we've parted 
I know there's one thing 
That I just can't stand 

I can't stand the rain 
Against my window 
Bringing back sweet memories 
I can't stand the rain
Against my window
Cause he ain't here with me 

Alone with the pillow
Where his head used to lay, yeah
I know you've got some sweet memories
But like a window you ain't got nothin' to say

I can't stand the rain
Against my window
Bringing back sweet memories
I can't stand the rain
