Excuse me friend
Can you tell me when
Did I sign up for this race
There's not an end
And no one wins
Yet you fight to keep the pace
Maybe I'll find a home in the heavens
Hitch a ride on a shooting star

[Chorus]
Leave this place for outer space
We can rent a little house on Venus
And get closer to the sun

There's always light
There is no night
We can watch the earth revolve
There's only friends
And innocence, there'd no conflicts to resolve

Leave behind everything you think matters
Don't delay once you're there you will see

[Chorus]

Welcome aboard, get comfortable
Your maiden journey's just begun
Just close your eyes
Enjoy the ride
We're getting closer to the sun

[Chorus]

Excuse me friend
Can you tell me when
Did I sign up for this race
