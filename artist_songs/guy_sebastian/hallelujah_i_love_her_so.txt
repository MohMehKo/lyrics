Let me tell you 'bout a girl I know
She is my baby and she lives next door
Every morning 'fore the sun come up
She brings my coffee in my favorite cup
That's why I know, yes, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so

When I'm in trouble and I have no friends
I know she'll go with me until the end
Everybody asks me how I know
I smile at them and say she told me so
That's why I know, yes, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so

Now if I call her on the telephone
And tell her that I'm all alone
By the time I count from one to four, I hear her  on my door

In the evening when the sun goes down
When there is nobody else around
She kisses me and she holds me tight
She tells me "Baby, everything's alright"
That's why I know, yes, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so
