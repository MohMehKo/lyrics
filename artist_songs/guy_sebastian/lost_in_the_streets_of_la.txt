I was walking down sunset vine
Just lookin’ to get by
And that’s when I saw her
And she was reading a magazine
But then she looked up at me
That’s when I fell for her

She was smiling, so inviting
I was lovin’ the view
And the time it was just right and
I had to make a move
So I stood up
And I tripped up
And I knocked myself out
And when I woke up she was gone

She was one in a billion
And she was the one that got away
I wanted to make her my own
But I lost my love on the streets of LA
Of LA, my baby, of LA

While I was laying out cold on the street
I was dreamin of her and me
Like we was together
We were crazy in love
What we had was so real
We were livin’ the high life
In our house on the hill
But I knew it
That I blew it
Yeah when I came to
Cause it was then that I knew

That she was one in a billion
And she was the one that got away
I wanted to make her my own
But I lost my love on the streets of LA
Of LA, LA, LA

She was one in a billion
She was the one that got away
I wanted to make her my own
But I lost my love on the streets of LA
Of LA, of LA, yeah-yeah

She was one in a billion
And she was the one that got away
I wanted to make her my own
But I lost my love on the streets of LA
LA, LA, LA
