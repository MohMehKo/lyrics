I see a sign, neon lights throwin' fire at me
Blinding my eyes to the things surrounding me
Bruning away all the clouds that follow me
Drawn to the bass at the place where the soul is at

I try to hide the feelin' inside
It's takin over my mind
Going crazy, please
Move everybody down to the hub
Bringing the people gather the love
Come dance with me
No stoppin' baby

Oh, its got me losing control
Such a feeling baby that soul
Music is takin me over
And im all crazy lovin this high
Dont you take me off that rude
Soul music is takin me over
Ain't no stopping, baby, no stoppin baby

I get a high everytime i hear the beat
Jimmy Brown, Marvin Gaye, Hathaway
Im on my feet
Move to the floor cos the floor's the place to be
Gather round downtown
Aint no profound just let it be

Move everybody down to the hub
Bringing the people gather the love
Come dance with me
No stoppin' baby
