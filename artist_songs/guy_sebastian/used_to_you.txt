These years nothing has faded
These eyes still get fixated
These ears still get elative
Whenever you say a word

This heart still skips a beat
This chest forgets to breathe
These legs shake at the knees
Whenever I feel you need

'Cause I just can't get used to you
I just can't get used to you
Every time that we touch, it feels brand new
I just can't get used to you

It may seem like I'm fearless
But around you I still get nervous
And these limbs, they still get the quivers
Every time we kiss

'Cause I just can't get used to you
No, I just can't get used to you
Every time that we touch, it feels brand new
I just can't get used to you

Yeah believe me
'Cause I mean it sincerely
It's still like the honey moon, like the honey moon
I get proud when we're out in the crowd
'Cause I get to say that I'm with you

Oh baby

Oh Yeah

I'll never get used to you
No, I'll never get used to you
Every time we make love
It feels brand new
I'll never get used to you
