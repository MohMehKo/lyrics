If I really loved you, baby, I would let you be
I wouldn't drag you down this winding road with me
As torturous and lonely that letting go may be
If I really loved you baby I would set you free
Oh, baby...

If I really loved you, baby, I would put you first
I'd help you love yourself and not bring out your worst
I'd help you see your dreams and I would never stand between
If I really loved you, baby, I would set you free

And the answer to the question is yes, I really love you
Yes, I really love you more than you could know
But because I really love you, I'm gonna have to let you go...

If I really loved, baby, you would never cry
You'd always feel beautiful, morning, day and night
You'd feel your best is good enough even if you fail
You'd feel you're living in your own fairytale

And the answer to the question is yes, I really love you
Yes, I really love you, more than you could know
But because I really love you, I'm gonna have to let you go...

Oh baby
And the answer to the question is yes, I really love you
Yes, I really love you more than you could know
But because I really love you, I'm gonna have to let you go...

Don't wanna have to let you go
Believe me, babe, I don't wanna let you go, let you go,
'Cause I love you so, more than you could know
I love you babe
I wish I could be all you need me to be, babe...
