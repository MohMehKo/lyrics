Sir there is a girl in this town 
I thought I could live without her round
But I can't go on till I make her mine
But I may need your help before I'm out of time

See you feel the earth move whenever she smiles 
She loves like a women but laughs like a child

[Chorus]
And did I fail to mention that she is so beautiful
Hair like a waterfall sent from above
And did I bring attention to how she's so wonderful 
She could make anyone fall so in love

And I don't know her name or where she lives
Wont somebody take me to where she is
I can't take another second another minute 
If not for her face id be losing my faith

See she makes the sunshine on the cloudiest day 
You feel like your floating when she looks your way

[Chorus to fade]
