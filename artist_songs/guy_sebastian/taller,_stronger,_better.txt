I've met the darkness 
Been held by the night 
Lonely was there in my arms 
I've been with broken 
I've stared in her eyes 
Emptiness left me this scar 

But I heard your voice, Calling me out of the cold 

[CHORUS:]
And now I can live again 
I have been chosen to run with the wind 
I can go higher
I know I will soar 
I'm taller, I'm stronger, I'm better than before 

I've walked through fire
So I could become 
All that you said I could be 
And now my breath has a reason 
My sky has a sun 
Cos in you I've found all that I need 

Your touched revived me, It was your love that opened my eyes 

[CHORUS]

I broke through the rain 
Stood through the storm 
Now I know I'll remain 
I can do the impossible 
I can reach the unreachable 
It's my time 
I will rise 
And live... 

[Chorus]
