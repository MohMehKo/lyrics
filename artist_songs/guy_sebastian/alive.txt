All this time barely just getting by,
I would crawl even though I could fly,
Mister play it safe, I was too afraid to fail, just waiting to exhale,
Oh it's like I lost my way but I found it again after someone said let there be light,
And now I'm in this place with the wind on my face and I know for the first time,

I'm a la la la la la live,
I'm a la la la la la live,
I'm a la la la la la live,
I'm a la la la la la live,

I didn't know all the things I was missing,
All I had to do was stop and listen,
Beauty surrounds, but its no where to be found if you're only looking down,
Oh it's like I lost my way but I found it again after someone said let there be light,
And now I'm in this place with the wind on my face and I know for the first time,

I'm a la la la la la live,
I'm a la la la la la live,
I'm a la la la la la live,
I'm a la la la la la live,

But now I'm seeing colours, I've never seen before,
I'm living in this moment, oh forget tomorrow,
It's all about right now, standing here with you,
Lets run, lets run,

I'm a la la la la la live,
Oh I'm a la la la la la live,
I'm a la la la la la live,
I'm a la la la la la live,
I'm alive, alive, alive, alive,
I'm alive, yeah,
I'm a la la la la la live,
I'm a la la la la la live,
I'm a la la la la la live,
I'm a la la la la la live,
