[Chorus:]
Take me
Take me
Wherever just take me
I'm gonna ride, witchu be my guide
Take me
Take me
Wherever just take me
I'm gonna ride this beauitful life

I'm in tune with my guided fate
The picture's clear as smoke
But still I always go
In the light there's no hiding place
I guess I'll never know
That ol' familiar home

I hear that voice enticing me
Uncertainty inviting me
Feels so good
Said it feels so good

[Chorus]

The days of yesteryear are far behind me now
There's no more worrying 
About tomorrow somehoe
There's no other time
There's no other place
Than where I am today
I do the best that I
