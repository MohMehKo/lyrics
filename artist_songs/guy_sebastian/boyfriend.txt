She was alone and so was I
So maybe it was meant to be
She looked at me I smiled at her
And told her she could take a seat

Her name was Janice but call her Jane
She told me she was 25
She lives at home with her mum, dad and a dog
And I just feel for every line

She said I'm new in town
Can you show me around
She said I think I'm falling for you

[Chorus]
She never said she had a boyfriend
I never knew there was another man
I couldn't read between the lines
I must be blind
Not to see she had a boyfriend

About her age about her name
She even lied about the dog
I'll never get her, I shoulda known better
Cos there was something kinda odd

(When she said hey) Hey boy I'm new in town
Can you show me around
I can't believe I was falling for you, for you

[Chorus]

Maybe I'll wait around
Till you and him are through
I wish I never knew the truth

I know you're not new in town
But I'll still take you around
I'll just pretend like I never knew

[Chorus]
