If I could speak louder than words
I'd be speechless
I show you what I can do, what I can do
And if a song that I sing is a one that works
Than I sing it forever for you
Cause I'm not someone who confesses much
But make u feel what I feel
So baby hush hush
3 words
I will say them to you
With a touch of my hand
You will know that it's true
3 words
From the depth of my kiss
From my heart to your lips
You'll know you heard 3 words
And if you feel like truly a dream were real
And it takes you up away from it all
And baby sleep, talk is cheap
And that ain't what ya need
Cause there's too much of that in this world
Sometimes you just gotta show not tell
But I believe (I believe) that you know it too well
3 words
I will say them to you
With a touch of my hand
You will know that it's true
3 words
From the depth of my kiss
From my heart to your lips
You'll know you heard 3 words
I wish I were a poet I could make your world bright 
Always have the right line
Baby blow your mind
I'd make your sky shine when rain is falling down
Make some sense even when I don't have a clue
I'll tell u these
3 words
I will say them to you
With a touch of my hand
You will know that it's true
3 words
From the depth of my kiss
From my heart to your lips
You'll know u heard 3 words
