What a wonderful world 
I see trees of green, red roses too
I see them bloom from me and you
But I think to myself what a wonderful world (yeah)

I see skies of blue, clouds of white
bright blessed days, dark sacred nights
but i think to myself what a wonderful world

The colours of the rainbow so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of people passing by
I see friends shakin' hands saying "How do you do?"
They're really saying "I love you"

I hear babies crying, I watch them grow
They'll learn much more than I'll never know
But I think to myself what a wonderful world

I think to myself what a wonderful world
Hey, yeah, wonderful, wonderful world
