Peter can you gather the angels all around
I need everyone to get this down
This will not be easy
Coz what I'm askin for 
Is something we have never tried before

Lets make a girl but not just any girl
She needs to be perfect perfect

Add some beautiful throw in some divine 
she needs to define perfection
Don't forget the sugar 
Make it so she's sweet from her head to her feet 
Perfection

Go and get Picasso he can paint her eyes
Michelangelo can paint her smile
And when their finally finished I want nothing less 
Than for all of us to stand here breathless

Lets make a girl but not just any girl
She needs to be perfect perfect

[Chorus]

All the angels said can we keep her 
She's so beautiful
But god said someone down there needs her 
And he can't live without her without her

She's so beautiful flawlessly divine 
And yes she defines perfection
Please don't change a thing it's obvious to me 
That what I see is perfection

When she's 21 she'll change somebody's life
When she's 28 she'll be his wife
