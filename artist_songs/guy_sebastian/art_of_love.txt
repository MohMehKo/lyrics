Im saying sorry in advance 
Coz this won't always go to plan
Though we don't mean to take our love for granted 
It's in our nature to forget what matters

And when the goin is getting tough 
And were all about giving up
Things that we never thought we'd say gunna say em 
Games that we never thought we'd play gunna play em

It aint perfect but its worth it and its always getting better 
Its gunna take some time to get it right

[Chorus]
Coz I'm still learning the art of love 
Im still tryin to not mess up
So whenever I stumble let me know
You need to spell it out, you need to spell it out,
you need to spell it out you need to spell it out for me 
Coz I'm still tryin to learn the art of love

If I forget to get the door 
remind u that you're beautiful
I know my detail requires more attention 
If I ever hurt you its not my intention

Coz were gunna make our mistakes
Find out how much a heart can take 
But I know that you got my back 
And baby I got yours.

[Chorus]

Sometimes I'm gunna miss
Im learnin how to give
Im not giving up
Im learnin how to love
Learnin how to love

[Chorus to fade]
