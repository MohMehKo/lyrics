Like a shadow through the dark
In the loneliness of all I see
I'm walking 'round with half a heart
Since I lost the better part of me
I can't let go of the past
When every breath just pulls me back
To where we started

I wish I could be with you
And I miss so much about you
And I wish my heart was unbreakable
Oh I wish my heart was unbreakable

I'm tryin' to find out who I am
In the memory of you and me
I'm tryin' to see things as they are
Not the way I wish that they could be
But for now I'll just pretend
To hold you in my arms again
For one last moment

[Chorus]

If you were here tonight
I'd never let you go
And I would find a way to say the things I never said
And you would find it all

[Chorus]

Cos love means nothing without you
And my world still turns around you
And I wish my heart was unbreakable

[Chorus]
