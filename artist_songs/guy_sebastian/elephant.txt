There's a great big elephant up in this room
No we both refuse to face it, we know it's true, know it's true
That there's a great big elephant up in this room
And still we both can't say the words
I don't want you, I don't want you, I don't want you

Don't know if I should retreat or defend
Or if this is too broken to mend
Can't remember what we're even fighting for anymore
I know you're with me but I'm still alone
We got this house but I don't feel at home
And though your arms are around me I feel the cold, feel the cold

We use to be so hard (ba-boom, ba-boom, ba-boom)
Yeah you could hear our hearts (ba-boom, ba-boom, ba-boom)
I'm trying to find some light
But all I get is a flat line

Cause there's a great big elephant up in this room
No we both refuse to face it, we know it's true, know it's true
That there's a great big elephant up in this room
And still we both can't say the words
I don't want you, I don't want you, I don't want you

We should do injure but never to kill
A roller coaster but devour to thrill
Through it all I'm the black in a losing game but still we play
How can I move on when you're all I know
I forgot how to be on my own
But is that a reason for me to stay, I'm so afraid

We use to be so hard (ba-boom, ba-boom, ba-boom)
Yeah you could hear our hearts (ba-boom, ba-boom, ba-boom)
I'm trying to find some light
But all I get is a flat line

Cause there's a great big elephant up in this room
No we both refuse to face it, we know it's true, know it's true
That there's a great big elephant up in this room
And still we both can't say the words
I don't want you, I don't want you, I don't want you

Oh, I'm trying to save us from drowning
You thought this distance between us is going
We went from running free, running fast
To walking on broken glass, yo oh oh
Still I can't seem to let you go

There's a great big elephant up in this room
And no we both refuse to face it, we know it's true, know it's true
That there's a great big elephant up in this room
And still we both can't say the words
I don't want you, I don't want you, I don't want you
There's a grey big elephant up in this room
And still we both can't say the words
I don't want you, I don't want you, I don't want you,
I don't want you, I don't want you, I don't want you
But I do go when I don't love you
