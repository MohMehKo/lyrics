[Chorus]
I'd like to get to know you
I'd like to get to know you well
I'd like to get to know you
I'd like to get to know you well

Maybe tonight
We could paint the town
Go where you wanna go
Or if you like instead
I could brush your hair 
Or maybe paint your toes

[Chorus]

Maybe tonight, listen
You can tell me all about your every wish
Or if you like instead
You can teach me how to cook your favourite dish

Cos what we do it don't matter
Long as we're together
So baby let me do ya right

[Chorus]

Though I know I could be your everything
Don't wanna rush you with anything
I'm only wanting the best for you
Baby it's true

[Chorus]
