Joe lives with his folks at home 
Smokes little plants he grows 
Cool 4 a kids but 2day is the big 3 0 
It seems all his hopes and dreams 
Got lost in habitual fiends 
Now he is crying tears of 
What have could have been 

He is saying why oh why does my life pass by 
Could it have been that all this time saying why 
U shoulda said how 

30 candles u r blowin none of 
Which deserve a light 
The only music you'v been playin 
Is the anthem of why 
Always dreamin never doin so they 
Never did take flight 
Still the music that your playin 
Is the anthem of why oh oh ohh 

Stacey dreamt of becoming a pop queen 
Suddenlly when she turned 15 
Everything changed 
She found out she had 1 on the way 
So she, took all the posters of britney 
Mariah, Beyonce and whitney and 
With her dreams 
She threw them all away 

She was saying why oh why if not 4 that night 
Could it all this time saying why 
U shoulda said how 
All the hopin all the wishin girl 
U traded 4 a night 
So the song that u r singin 
Is the anthem of why 
Now your feelin all your dreamin 
Was just a waste of time 
So the song thats your singin 
Is the anthem of why 
Oh ohh oh 

Always saying why oh why does my life pass by 
Could it have been that all this time saying why 
U shoulda said how 

All the hopin all the prayin 
Know they should have never died 
But they faded when u traded how 
4 the anthem of why 
U gotta dream it gotta feel it if 
You ever wanna fly 
Never sing it never play it 
Its the anthem of why
