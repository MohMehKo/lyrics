So many people keep questioning
What’s wrong with the world today?
The same people that see a glass
And call it half empty

It’s so hard sometimes to see the truth
When you’re standing in the dark
Always thinking with you’re head
Instead of following your heart

So I (So I)
Live each day like it is my last
So I (So I)
Keep my feet on the narrow path
This life never gives you a second chance
I’m just trying to do the right thing
Trying to be a better man

I’ll never be perfect
But I still gotta try
A bird must always fall
Before he learns to fly
That’s why I’m trying to leave this place
Better than the day before
I won’t stop
I won’t quit
Until I reach my goal

And I know if we try
We could all see eye to eye
Only one at a time
We can change people’s lives

So I (So I)
Live each day like it is my last
So I (So I)
Keep my feet on the narrow path
This life never gives you a second chance
I’m just trying to do the right thing
Trying to be a better man

There’s gotta be a better way
If we’re gonna shed some love on the world today
We got brothers killing brothers
Nobody cares about each other
So what we’re gonna take a stand
Starting here with me

So I (So I)
Live each day like it is my last
So I (So I)
Keep my feet on the narrow path
This life never gives you a second chance
I’m just trying to do the right thing
Trying to be a better man

So I (So I)
Live each day like it is my last
So I (So I)
Keep my feet on the narrow path
This life never gives you a second chance
I’m just trying to do the right thing
Trying to be a better man
