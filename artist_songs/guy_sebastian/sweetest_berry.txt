You posses a beauty deep within
That soothes me when I'm around you
Your skin is butterscotch on porcelain
My sweet tooth is glad I found you
Now I am in search of words to sing
A melody fit for a queen
As sweet as what I'm feeling in my heart

Like sugar on the hot black berry
Different then the ordinary
You're the sweetest berry on the vine
Like cherries deep in melted chocolate
Caramel with whipped cream toppin'
You're the sweetest berry on the vine

Never had I seen a perfect face
Till my eyes fell upon you
And never had I felt true love's embrace
Until the day I held you
Now I am in search of words to sing
A melody fit for a queen
As sweet as what I'm feeling in my heart

Like sugar on the hot black berry
Different then the ordinary
You're the sweetest berry on the vine
Like cherries deep in melted chocolate
Caramel with whipped cream toppin'
You're the sweetest berry on the vine

And when I think of how
I wonder
I think of how I am when I'm with you
Cuz you're the sweetest berry on the vine

Like sugar on the hot black berry
Different then the ordinary
You're the sweetest berry on the vine
Like cherries deep in melted chocolate
Caramel with whipped cream toppin'
You're the sweetest berry on the vine
