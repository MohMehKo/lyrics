Sometimes I can't remember
If these ashes came from flames
And if we relight these embers
Will they just burn out again?
We can try, we should try

Someday I know we're gonna feel again
Just like we did when we were younger
Someday I know we're gonna beat again
Gonna beat again like a drum

Like a drum
Like a drum

Just 'cause I, I can't measure and I can't hold it in my hands
Doesn't mean, doesn't mean that I should just give up on chance
We can try, we should try

Someday I know we're gonna feel again
Just like we did when we were younger
Someday I know we're gonna beat again
Gonna beat again like a drum

Like a drum
Like a drum

We're gonna beat again
I can already hear the sound
And we're gonna beat again
Yes, so loud that it shakes the ground

Ain't gonna miss a beat
Ain't gonna miss a beat
Ain't gonna miss a beat, yeah

Someday I know we're gonna feel again
Just like we did when we were younger
Someday I know we're gonna beat again
Gonna beat again like a drum

Like a drum
Like a drum
Like a drum
Like a drum

Someday I know we're gonna feel again
Just like we did when we were younger (when we were young)
Someday I know we're gonna beat again
Gonna beat again like a drum

Like a drum
Like a drum
Like a drum
Like a drum
