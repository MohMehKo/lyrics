If you went to the bank and you balance was blank
And your car was impounded by the state
Don't you fret if you're unable to bring something to the table
You don't need nothing just bring yourself

If you're tired of work and you want to resign
Spend each workin day with me and ill provide
Oh yes I will
Coz you don't need and occupation or a college education
You don't need nothing but baby please bring yourself

Just bring all of your love coz baby that's all that's required
Coz this thing that we got I know will not expire

So just say the magic words that I am yours baby

Close the door draw the curtains 
Coz ive never been more certain
That a love like ours will stand the test of time
So I hope you've learned this lesson 
That I don't want your possessions
Without you I'm nothing so bring yourself
Just bring yourself

Baby that's all I need
Just bring yourself
Baby that's all I need 
Just bring yourself
Just bring yourself

You don't need nothing baby
Just bring yourself
I don't want nobody else
Just bring yourself
Baby just bring yourself
