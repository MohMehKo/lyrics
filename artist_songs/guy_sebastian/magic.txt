Lately ive discovered mystical powers
Strange abilities that boggle my mind
And its you, the secret lies with you
And I'm powerless without cha

Funny you should mention coz I felt the same things
Ever since the day you walked in my life
Like an illusion my worries disappear 
Right before my eyes.

[Chorus]
Coz I got a feelin that you got a feelin
Don't try explainin it 
all I can say is its magic
were makin magic
And don't you believe it

It's an awakening ,nobodies fakin it
It's a secret and nobodies takin it.
Its magic, were makin magic and you better believe it

Im a little bosser ill tell you the future
Coz I know how it pans out if you stick around
See before you were here the picture wasnt clear, but now I see forever

You must be a ventriloquist 
coz you know what I say 
before it leaves my lips, yeah
Guess what I'm thinking right now
I love you I love you I love you baby

[Chorus]

This love is death defying 
its like I can levitate into the sky
But I promise I will never do a disappearing act coz

[Chorus x2]

Abracadabra alakazam 
Baby you got me spinning [x4]
