It's your ooh
It's got me frozen like ice
Fixated on you but i
I think it's time to leave
Cos of you
I'm blinded by the nth degree
But baby potentially
You could be the end of me

She's that shady kinda lady
Trying to get with me
Girl you know that it ain't worth my time
And when she is close to me 
My head becomes jelly
Get me outta here before i loose my mind

[CHORUS:]
You got me witcha (oh oh)
The way you use that (oh oh)
How do you tame that (oh oh)
There's way too much oh oh for me to bare
You got me saying (oh oh)
Lady control that (oh oh)
You gotta tame that (oh oh)
Put your oh oh away 
Cos there's way too much to bare

Now 'bout that ooh
It's cool
You know i'm aware
But what is going on upstairs
I think predominantly air
And if i
Wanted to talk then i'd
Rather dial intro line
Cos there's not a lot between your eyes

She's that shady kinda lady
Trying to get with me
Get me outta here before i loose my mind

[CHORUS]

You got your oh
I got my fro
I think you should know
I need to go
Lady control
Give up the show
I think you should know
Put your oh oh away cos there's way too much bare
