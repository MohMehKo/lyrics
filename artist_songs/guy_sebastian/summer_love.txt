She’s like an angel sleep
I pray she dreams of me
I can lay here all day
Up asking of her warm embrace

‘Cause she’s the prettiest thing
I swear that I ever did see
Wish I have taken her hugs
Every ounce of her love
And bottled it up
‘Cause all I ever left are

Those sweet memories, those sweet memories
Of the kiss we shared under the apple tree
Love come back to me right here next to me
Summer days, summer nights
When we made summer love
One day, summer love

I thought when the season’s change
These feelings would go away
But I still see her face
More and more each day

‘Cause she’s the loveliest thing
I swear I ever did see
Wish I have taken her kisses
‘Cause oh how I miss her
I need her now
But all I ever left are

Those sweet memories, those sweet memories
Of the kiss we shared under the apple tree
Love come back to me right here next to me
Summer days, summer nights
When we made summer love
One day, summer love

I pray that she finds her way
Back in my arms again
Someday, some way
It’s good that 10 years
I remained only hers and I wait, I wait
But no matter what at least I still got

Those sweet memories, those sweet memories
Of the kiss we shared under the apple tree
Love come back to me right here next to me
Summer days, summer nights
When we made summer love
One day, summer love

Those sweet memories, those sweet memories
Love come back to me right here next to me
Those sweet memories, those sweet memories
Summer love
