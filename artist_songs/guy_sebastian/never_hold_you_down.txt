Never hold you down
Im never gunna hold you down

Ive listened to sweet love and no need for me love
But some dreams don't come true
Coz I know your kisses are on the wish list 
Of another lover who wants to 
Believe he is the only one you let drive your car 
But we all knew how this would play out, 
Long before the game started

[Chorus]
Oh I'm never never never gonna hold you down
Never never never gunna hold you down
No I'm never never gunna hold you down
Never never never

I want to make you all mine but I know its only just a matter of time 
Before you fly so ill try 
but I'll never never never hold you down

You see its better to lose love than never to have loved 
And with you they got it right
It's only a season I know ya teasin 
But it's the best time of my life

After you gone girl I wont forget it
Memories fade but I just wont let it 
I knew I could never keep you forever 
Long before the game started

[Chorus to fade]
