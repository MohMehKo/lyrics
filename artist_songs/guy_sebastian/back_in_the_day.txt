Im gonna love ya like..[times 3]
Baby like i loved you back in the day

Baby I remember when
you and i just began 
knowing we were more than friends i had 2 make you understand 
said i gotta get to know ya 
give me one chance to show ya 
just what you mean to me 
and everything that we could be

So we talked a little 
and we danced a little 
told me that i treated u like the perfect gentleman 
from the day love started 
we could not be parted 
lets get back to how our love was 

[Chorus]
Back in the day
all we had was you and me but
that was all we ever needed
i was your superman girl
you were meant for me
back in the day
the way i said i love you daily 
but girl i havent told you lately
im gonna love you baby
like i loved you back in the day

all of those things i wort
you cried everytime you read
the friday night theatre show
where i would be watching you instead
all the bad jokes id say
but you would laugh anyway
you were my closest friend
together 24/7 
forever till the very end

but i havent been there baby
or sent you flowers lately
lets get back to how our love was 

[Chorus]

when i look into your eyes baby
its then i realise ive been
acting like a fool
im still crazy for you
so tonight im gonna show ya
by the way im gonna hold ya
my love is still the same girl
im crazy for you
ooh just like

[Chorus]
