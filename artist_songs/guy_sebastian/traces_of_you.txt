Got your scent on the sheets
Though I washed em bout a dozen times
It’s still your voice on the machine
Saying “Sorry, I’m on the other line”
You had so many shoes and I used to complain
Now I’m wishing that the closet was full again
No, you’re gone, ohhh
It’s like you never went anywhere

There’s an XBox where your books used to be
There’s an empty chair where you used to be
There’s a cold, cold space where you used to sleep
And I just can’t breathe 
And I can take the pictures down
Still I’d see your face
Cause when I look around
All I see is traces of you
Traces of you

Had our own matching robes
But now the his & hers are only his
Been so long
Is it wrong?
That I just can’t get over this
And as I’m sitting here eating this takeaway
I’m wishin’ I could set the table for 2 again
But you’re gone ohhh
And it hasn’t hit me at all

There’s an XBox where your books used to be
There’s an empty chair where you used to be
There’s a cold, cold space where you used to sleep
And I just can’t breathe 
And I can take the pictures down
Still I’d see your face
Cause when I look around
All I see is traces of you
Traces of you

I could burn everything that reminds me of you
I could move ‘cross the world tryna start brand new
But the memories remain and nothing’s gonna change
No, nothing’s gonna change (gonna change)
That you’re gone
Ooh that you’re gone
Whooaaa

There’s an XBox where your books used to be
There’s an empty chair where you used to be
There’s a cold, cold space where you used to sleep
And I just can’t breathe 
And I can take the pictures down
Still I’d see your face
Cause when I look around
All I see is traces of you
Traces of you
