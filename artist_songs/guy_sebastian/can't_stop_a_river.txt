Gone are the days of my mistakes
I'd give everything if everything is what it takes
I'll bring the sun and I will chase the rain
If I needed to

But those may be the ways of mine
But I've been down that road so many times
And if you'll depend upon me
Then maybe you'll see

[Chorus]
You can't stop a river from flowing to the sea
Some things just happen like they're meant to be
And it doesn't matter where you are
Or where you go or what you do
You can't stop my heart from loving you

There is a dream I keep alive
Wonderful and heavenly and standing by your side
Bringing you all the colours love can spare
Just to be with you

There may have been times when I
Should have been there to hold you through the night
And if you'll depend on me
Then maybe you'll see

[Chorus]

I've been miles away
But I'm paying my dues
But don't worry, I won't blame you for a minute
I won't blame you this time

[Chorus]
