From the very second baby I already knew
I'll end up head over heels in love with you
Turns out I'm right

I couldn't tell if you were feeling what i felt for you
So i nonchalantly tried to play it cool
I'm tired of lying

But i get lost when I look in your Eyes
Cos my love is so hard to disguise

[Chorus]
Baby I can't help this feeling
It's a fight that I know I can't win
There's nothing i can do
So I'm giving up tonight
Cos baby you're my kryptonite

Cos i can't stop thinking of you
I'll be trying not to love you
I'm helpless, girl it's true
So I'm giving up tonight
Cos baby you're my kryptonite

You're love is like a pendulum that's swinging side to side
Got me in a spell and now I can't deny
Girl I'm hypnotised
Cos baby it's the same tomorrow, yesterday, tonight
And i swear that nothing's ever felt so right
I'm yours for life

I get lost when I look in your eyes
Cos my love is so hard to disguise

[Chorus]

I've tried so hard to let you go
But I can't escape the way I feel inside
Way beyond denial that we are meant to be in love
So girl I give up, yeah

[Chorus]
