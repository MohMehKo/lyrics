When I think of you girl I get that feeling
I need a hit of you baby
Girl my head is spinning
And you got me feedin' for your love
Girl you got me goin crazy

And you don't have to worry
Girl you know I'm down
I'm addicted to you, babe

All day I'm thinkin' of ya
All day I wonder where you go and what you do
I'm a fiend for you
All day I wonder where you are
Girl you know you got my heart
I can't stop baby I'm a fiend for you

All day [x5]

Just like the first time
I'm in the clouds and I'm trippin on you, babe
You make the sunshine baby
And you got me feedin' for your love
Girl you got me goin crazy
And you don't have to question
If I'm gonna be around
I'm addicted to you, babe

All day I'm thinkin' of ya
All day I wonder where you go and what you do
I'm a fiend for you
All day I wonder where you are
Girl you know you got my heart
I can't stop baby I'm a fiend for you

I just don't wanna let you go
Baby what's the use in fighting
I don't wanna hide it no more
Whenever you're gone
Baby nothing else will do
Cuz I only wanna be with you
All day [x5]

And you don't have to question
If I'm gonna be around
I'm addicted to you, babe

All day I'm thinkin' of ya
All day I wonder where you are and what you do
I'm a fiend for you
All day I wonder where you are
Girl you know you got my heart
I can't stop baby I'm a fiend for you
