Oh when the sun beats down
and burns the tar up on the roof.
And your shoes get so hot,
you wish your tired feet were fireproof.
Under the boardwalk, down by the sea,
on a blanket with my baby is where I'll be.

From the park you hear
happy sounds of the carousel.
You can almost taste the hot dogs
and french fries they sell.
Under the boardwalk, down by the sea,
on a blanket with my baby is where I'll be.

Under the boardwaok, Out of the sun.
Under the boardwalk, We'll be havin' some fun.
Under the boardwalk, People walkin' above.
Under the boardwalk, We'll be fallin' in love
under the boardwalk, boardwalk.

Oooh, la la la la la la.
Oooh, la la la la la la la la la.
Help me somebody, sing some la la's with me.
Under the night, under the stars, down by the raging sea.

Under the boardwalk, down by the sea,
on a blanket with my baby is where I'll be.
On a blanket with my baby is where I'll be.

Under the boardwalk, Out of the sun.
Under the boardwalk, We'll be havin' some fun.
Under the boardwalk, People walkin' above.
Under the boardwalk, We'll be falling in love.
Under the boardwalk, boardwalk. Whew!
