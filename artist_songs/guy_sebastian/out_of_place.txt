Out feels like in
Endings begin
The grass is baby blue
The sky is army green

Down feels like up
I miss you so much
When or where will you be coming back to me
And help make sense of it all

[Chorus]
Everything's out of place
Everything's out of place
My inside out's so upside down
Whenever you're not around

Fast forward rewinds
I'm walking backwards in time
Everything that's new feels like I've done before
The moon lights the day
Since the sun lost its way
You can't hear that you're the one I'm looking for
I need you to show me the way

[Chorus x2]

Round in a square circle I keep turning
But everything aligns when I'm align with you

Everything's out of place
Everything's out of place
Everything's out of place
Round and round and round I go

[Chorus x2]
