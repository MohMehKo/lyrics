How can I settle for less
Now that I've had amazin'?
Yeah, I can try and try my best
But I know what I can't replace it
They say I'm wastin' my time,
Yeah, and I can't change it
But I, I'm gonna try and try,
Don't care if they think I'm crazy

I'm only human
I'm only human

Is it madness
To give all you've got
Even though you get nothing back
Is it madness
To run for the fire
Even though you've be burned so bad
It hooks like a drug, drug,
And you just can't give it up
They say it's madness,
But I call it love,
Yeah, I call it love

I shut my eyes so tight,
But still I can see ya
So many voices inside my head,
But only yours is familiar
And I say yo name over and over and over
Like the record's broken
Hopin' one day you'll catch my words
And feel happy I've spoken

I'm only human
I'm only human

Is it madness
To give all you've got
Even though you get nothing back
Is it madness
To run for the fire
Even though you've be burned so bad
It hooks like a drug, drug,
And you just can't give it up
They say it's madness,
But I call it love,
I call it love

I call it love
I call it love
I call it love
I call it love,
Love,
Love,
Yeah

Is it madness
To give all you've got
Even though you get nothing back
Is it madness
To run for the fire
Even though you've be burned so bad?
It hooks like a drug, drug,
And you just can't give it up
They say it's madness,
But I call it love,

I guess they're both the same,
They're both the same
I guess they're both the same,
They're both the same

They say it's madness,
But I call it love,
I call it love
Oh yeah they're both the same
