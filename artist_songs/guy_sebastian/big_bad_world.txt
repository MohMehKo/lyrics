From the time your hand
Didn't fit round my finger
The first time that I saw you smile
I realized why I’m alive

And that time we
First hear you say the word, daddy
And when your front teeth disappeared
Let’s still be clear, why I’m here

When life throws you arrows and makes you feel small
My love for you, child, will conquer it all

No you don’t have to worry
Won’t let the big bad world get you
No you don’t have to worry
Won’t let the big bad world get you no way

There'll be battles
And they may be too big to handle
But while there's still strength in these bones
You’ll never fight them alone

When your little heart breaks
Know that we feel each and every ache
Before you I never did know
Just how deep my love could go

All of the milestones and things that I’ve done
They can’t compare to you my son

And so you don’t have to worry
I won’t let the big bad world get you
No you don’t have to worry
I won’t let the big bad world get you

And so you don’t have to worry
I won’t let the big bad world get you
No you don’t have to worry
I won’t let the big bad world get you

Set sail and go
Don’t be scared if the mighty wind blows
Keep your eyes on the horizon ’cause I’ll be there
Calling you, calling you home

No you don’t have to worry
I won’t let the big bad world get you
No you don’t have to worry
I won’t let the big bad world get you

No you don’t have to worry
I won’t let the big bad world get you
No you don’t have to worry
I won’t let the big bad world get you

From the time your hand
Didn't fit round my finger
