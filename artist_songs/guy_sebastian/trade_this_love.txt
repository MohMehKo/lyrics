She gives me the kinda time
The kinda room and peace of mind
To contemplate my vanity

She'd walk through a wall of fire
Knowing I'm on the other side
She's about everything I need
And I know

[Chorus]
I wouldn't trade this love for anything, for anything
I wouldn't trade this love for anything, for anything
But a little bit of her touch

Other lovers always want more
Been down that road before
But you take just a part of me

All she wants in my time
Not my money or my mind
See this loves never old
Cos she's living in my soul
And I know

[Chorus]
I wouldn't trade this love for anything, for anything
I wouldn't trade this love for anything, for anything

She knows how to start the flame
And keep it burnin' in my veins
She always understands
I can call her when I can
Make no mistake I'm always her man

[Chorus]
I wouldn't trade this love for anything, for anything
I wouldn't trade this love for anything, for anything
But another one of her homemade pies
