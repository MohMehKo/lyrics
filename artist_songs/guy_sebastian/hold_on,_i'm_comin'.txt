Don't you ever be sad,
Lean on me when times are bad.
When the day comes and you're down,
In a river of trouble and about to drown

Just hold on, I'm comin',
Hold on, I'm comin'.

I'm on my way, your lover.
If you get cold I'll be your cover.
Don't have to worry 'cause I'm here,
No need to suffer baby, I'm here.

Just hold on, I'm comin',
Hold on, I'm comin'.
Hold on, I'm comin',
Hold on, I'm comin'.
(Lookie here)
Reach out to me for satisfaction,
(Lookie here. All you got to do)
Call my name now for quick reaction.

Don't you ever be sad,
Lean on me when the times are bad.
When the day comes and you're down baby,
In a river of trouble and about to drown,

Just hold on, I'm comin',
Hold on, I'm comin'
Just hold on, don't you worry, I'm comin', (here ya come)
Hold on, I'm comin'.

Just hold on, don't you worry I'm comin',
Hold on, I'm comin'.
