I was on the mic
Doin' my thing on a Friday night
Had the floor burning up just right
Everybody was bumpin', the club was jumping
Suddenly, you walked in
That's when everybody stopped dancing
And I couldn't stop myself staring
Yeah I couldn't breathe,
No I couldn't believe my eyes

I never thought I'd fall in love in a club
But now I seen you girl I can't get enough
With you I know there's no taking it slow
So can somebody please let me know

[Chorus]
Tell me who's that girl 
Just walk walk (walk) in the club
Tell me who's that girl 
Just walk walk (walk) in the club
Tell me who's that girl 
Just walk walk (walk) in the club
Just walk walk (walk) in the club
Just walk walk (walk), walk walk (walk), yeah

Before the night is through
Imma tell ya how I feel about you
And I know I got some work to do
To make you believe that you should be leaving with me

I never thought I'd fall in love in a club
The more I get of you, I can't get enough
I won't be letting you leave here alone
So can somebody please let me know

[Chorus]
Tell me who's that girl 
Just walk walk (walk) in the club
Tell me who's that girl 
Just walk walk (walk) in the club
Tell me who's that girl 
Just walk walk (walk) in the club
Just walk walk (walk) in the club
Just walk walk (walk), walk walk (walk)

(I wanna know) Tell me who's that girl 
Just walk walk (walk) in the club
(Who's that girl) Tell me who's that girl 
Just walk walk (walk) in the club
Tell me who's that girl 
Just walk walk (walk) in the club
Just walk walk (walk) in the club
Just walk walk (walk), walk walk (walk)

[Eve]
E.V.E
I walk in the club it's over
All them other chicks might as well move over
Wanna know my name then you gotta get closer
Eyes on you too wanna get to know ya
Lemme run it down for ya, I'm not easy
Some say caramel, you can call my evie
Wanna be the man in my life that please me
Gotta warn in, Once ya know me, you need me
Give you whip lash when I glide through the room 
Five inch heals, watch how I move
Watch how I shake it to the beat, how I do
Know you wanna feel me, feel me shake it on you, yeah
The night could get crazy
But I gotta hold back, I'm a lady
Well who knows maybe I could be your baby
Be your baby, be your baby

[Guy]
Wo-oh 
Wo-oh oh
Wo-oh
Wo-oh 

[Chorus]
So, tell me who's that girl 
Just walk walk (walk) in the club
Tell me who's that girl 
Just walk walk (walk) in the club
Tell me who's that girl 
Just walk walk (walk) in the club
Just walk walk (walk) in the club
Just walk walk (walk) in the club

Tell me who's that girl 
Just walk walk (walk) in the club
Tell me who's that girl 
Just walk walk (walk) in the club
Tell me who's that girl 
Just walk walk (walk) in the club
Just walk walk (walk) in the club
Just walk walk (walk) in the club
