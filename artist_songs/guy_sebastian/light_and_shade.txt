Light and shade
Light and shade
When did I get so afraid?
And I'm tryin' to find a silver line
And all I see is grey
Light and shade

Light and shade
I'm just tryin' to find my way
Oh, Sweet Jesus
I'm so tired
I need some help today

Woke up this morning
Got a thing, girl
Cause yesterday seems kind of odd
I ask myself
Like how you wake up tired?
Your motivation expired
Find me in places where I don't fit
Nor do I wanna be eating
Used to be following
Kickin' the back of the leader
The world was turning
And I was always receiving
Life gonna retreat

Now we are the newest trends
The most wanted
But I am my kids most wanted
The devil is a sales man
I don't want it
The devil is a sales man
I don't want it

Light and shade
Light and shade
When did I get so afraid?
And I'm tryin' to find a silver line
And all I see is grey
Light and shade

Light and shade
I'm just tryin' to find my way
Oh, sweet Jesus
I'm so tired
I need some help today

Been to my jail with no bail
On the road, airplanes and hotels
And all this time for myself
You're thinkin' like
What if I was here by myself?
What it seems like social media
It makes you lose life
You are on your foot
From the sun to the moon light
And when you're fed up
You finally out your head up
Feel free

Now we are the newest trends
The most wanted
But I am my kids most wanted
The devil is a sales man
I don't want it
The devil is a sales man
I don't want it

Light and shade
Light and shade
When did I get so afraid?
And I'm tryin' to find a silver line
And all I see is grey
Light and shade

Light and shade
I'm just tryin' to find my way
Oh, sweet Jesus
I'm so tired
I need some help today

I'm fuckin' on my own
And I'm too far from home
And I'm tryin' to find the road
That I should take
And though the sun is gone
Still I'm holding on
Cause I hope it's gonna shine for me again

The devil is a sales man
I don't want it
Yeah he is a sales man
I don't want it

The devil is a sales man
I don't want it
Yeah he is a sales man
I don't want it

Light and shade
Light and shade
When did I get so afraid?
And I'm tryin' to find a silver line
And all I see is grey
Light and shade

Light and shade
I'm just tryin' to find my way
Oh, sweet Jesus
I'm so tired
I need some help today

Help me!
