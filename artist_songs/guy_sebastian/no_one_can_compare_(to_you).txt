Listen
Back when I was down and out
I thought nobody cared about me
And that's when I found you yeah
You came along and changed my life and
Cause of you I'll be alright
I'm so thankful for you
(friends came friends went, that's when it came evident)
I can put my trust in you
(people places, things change in my world one thing remains)
that noone compares u
I've had friends, lovers come and go
One thing I know
Noone can compare to you
And that is why
I'll be by your side
In this thing for life
Cause noone can compare to you
You say what you mean
Mean what you say
Always keep it real that way
Girl that's why I respect you
Ya always taking care of me
Never ask for anything and
I thank god he gave me you
(friends came friends went, that's when it came evident)
I can put my trust in you
(people places, things change in my world one thing remains)
that noone compares u
I've had friends, lovers come and go
One thing I know
Noone can compare to you
And that is why
I'll be by your side
In this thing for life
Cause noone can compare to you
Everything I've been through baby
Said I'm never alone
Cause you've always been there
Through the hardest times I've known and
I only hope to be everything you wanted me
