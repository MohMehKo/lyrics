I met a girl last night, had short blonde hair and hazel eyes
Like you, almost like you
I had a drink or two, she had a few and kind of laughed
Like you, almost like you
The one thing that stood out the most
Is almost isn't even close to you
There's nothing like you

Just so you know
Your love is engraved on my heart
It's set in stone
Nothing could break us apart
Unshakeable
Yeah, no matter where I am or where I go
We're set in stone

I'm tired of drinking reds in hotel beds
Just wishing I'm with you
I'm not lying, sometimes I do get lonely
But I'm only missing you
Temptation comes and quickly goes
When I think of going back home to you
I'm staying true

Just so you know
Your love is engraved on my heart
It's set in stone
Nothing could break us apart
Unshakeable
And no matter where I am or where I go
We're set in stone

If I had to choose between the two
You know my choice is always you
Cause if this life gets in the way
You know I'll walk right off this stage

Oh just so you know
Your love is engraved on my heart
It's set in stone
Nothing could break us apart
Unshakeable
And no matter where I am or where I go
We're set in stone
