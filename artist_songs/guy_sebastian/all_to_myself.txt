Your not like any girl I've ever seen
And it's clear that your no good for me
But hard as I try baby, I just can't stay away
So in my mind I play out this fantasy
That one day you will end up here with me
But I must be crazy coz I know you're only out to play

[Chorus]
But I want you all to myself
I want you all to myself
A little sample just won't do
I gotta have all of you

All to myself, I want you all to myself
Now that ive had my own preview
I gotta have all of you

There's a fire in your eyes that can't be tamed
And I don't know how I got caught in this game
But somehow you made me feel like 
there is no one else

I know that I should know better
This never will be forever
But baby I don't wanna share your lovin
So until the day your mine girl I aint gunna rest

[Chorus]

So tell me what I gotta say to make you stay
Coz I bet my intentions clear as day
Come on baby
You're like my last piece of candy and I don't wanna share it

Coz I want you all to myself 
I want you all to myself
A little sample just wont do 
I gotta have all of you

All to myself all to myself 
I want you all to myself
Now that ive had my own preview 
ive gotta have every little part of you

No one else will do I gotta have all your lovin baby

If you give your love to me
Baby I will never leave no no no
You can count on me I gotta have all of you

All to myself, Baby all to myself
