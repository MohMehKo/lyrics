I see you smiling every day 
Looking back at me like nothing ever changed
I swear i heard you call my name
But in reality
Its just your picture in the frame

Why am i here
Without you
When there was so much for us left to do
How could the angels have come so soon

[CHORUS:]
If i could make heaven wait
I'd find a way to ask god if he had
Made some mistake
If he'd save your wings
For another day
If only i could make heaven wait

All your clothes are hanging up
Not a thing's been touched 
I left it all the same
I wish i could press rewind
And go back in time
Just to see your face again
Cos i miss you
I need you
I'm so alone without you here with me
You are the reason that i breathe

[CHORUS]

And every night i search for your star
In the sky
(asking why oh why)
Lord knows i would trade in my life for
A chance to say goodbye

[CHORUS]
