Thought I was missin’
The good life
Going out every night
And I let go of what I had
I found treasure
But I, traded it in for a dime
And now I gotta get it back

I know I said it, I know I said it
And I’ll say it again until you get it
I’m never lettin’, I’m never letting go, no baby

I wasted time collecting stones
When all along I had a diamond in my hand
Had a diamond in my hand, oh yeah
I think I’m done collecting stones
I’m gonna go and put a diamond on your hand
Put a diamond on your hand, oh yeah

You’re probably thinkin’, that I’m high
I’ve been acting all crazy like
Just gotta get the message through, babe
See I was stupid 
But now I see it
Mistakes made I
I won’t repeat it
I’m gonna make it up to you
I know I said it, I know I said it
And I’ll say it again until you get it
I’m never lettin’, I’m never letting go, no baby

I wasted time collecting stones
When all along I had a diamond in my hand
Had a diamond in my hand, oh yeah
I think I’m done collecting stones
I’m gonna go and put a diamond on your hand
Put a diamond on your hand, oh yeah

You’re more precious than gold
You’re the wind in my sail
I’m Indiana Jones
And you’re the Holy Grail
Gonna get you home
Cause that’s where you belong
As the queen on the throne, ohhh yeah

I wasted time collecting stones
When all along I had a diamond in my hand
Had a diamond in my hand, oh yeah
I think I’m done collecting stones
I’m gonna go and put a diamond on your hand
Put a diamond on your hand, yeah

I wasted time collecting stones
When all along I had a diamond in my hand
Had a diamond in my hand, oh yeah
I think I’m done collecting stones
I’m gonna go and put a diamond on your hand
Put a diamond on your hand, oh yeah

I wasted time collecting stones
When all along I had a diamond in my hand
Had a diamond in my hand, oh yeah
I think I’m done collecting stones
I’m gonna go and put a diamond on your hand
Put a diamond on your hand, oh yeah
