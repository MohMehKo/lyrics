Some only want some shelter
Some want a mansion in the sky
Some want a thousand virgins
Some move matter with their mind

And when all the worlds collide
All they know is to divide
And it's easy if they're faceless
To hate the other side
And the others caught between
Are the only ones to bleed
And the ones they leave behind
Can only sit and cry

Dear God, dear soul
Dear Mary, Muhammad
Can we all just get along?
Can we all just get along?
Dear heart, dear life
Dear soldier, dear martyr
Where did we go wrong,
Can we all just get along?

Some set fire to crosses
Some fight to ride the bus they choose
Some don’t believe at all
But do anything to make the news

And when all the worlds collide
All they know is to divide
And it's easy if they're faceless
To hate the other side
And the others caught between
Are the only ones to bleed
And the ones they leave behind
Can only sit and cry

Dear God, dear soul
Dear Mary, Muhammad
Can we all just get along?
Can we all just get along?
Dear heart, dear life
Dear soldier, dear martyr
Where did we go wrong,
Can we all just get along?

Maybe if we’d work together
We’d already have a heaven here on earth

Dear God, dear soul
Dear Mary, Muhammad
Can we all just get along?
Can we all just get along?
Dear heart, dear life
Dear soldier, dear martyr
Where did we go wrong,
Can we all just get along?

Dear God, dear soul
Dear Mary, Muhammad
Can we all just get along?
Can we all just get along?
Dear heart, dear life
Dear soldier, dear martyr
Can we all just get along?
Can we all just get along?
