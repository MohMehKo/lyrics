I'm like ten thousand miles from you
And there's like ten thousand girls in view
They're try'na say they're with me
Get their drink on for free
Tryna get to my hotel room

Back it up, back it up, back it up
I ain't tryna do nothing, nah nah
Back it up, back it up, back it up
All I want is my woman

'Cause they don't hold a candle
To you, to you
You're my better handful
It's true, it's true
Ain't nobody taking your place
You're the only body I praise
They don't hold a candle
Yeah, they don't hold a candle
To you

She got that dress on to show her curves
And she came backstage to do some work
I knew when she said hello
She was ready to go
Ran her finger 'round my shirt

Back it up, back it up, back it up
I ain't tryna do nothing, nah nah
Back it up, back it up, back it up
All I want is my woman
My woman

'Cause they don't hold a candle
To you, to you
You're my better handful
It's true, it's true
Ain't nobody taking your place
You're the only body I praise
They don't hold a candle
Yeah, they don't hold a candle
To you

To you
Cause no one puts their hands on me
Like you
Yeah, nothing ever burns like your flame
That's why I ran and give you my name
'Cause they don't hold a candle
No one holds a candle
To you

Ain't nobody taking your place
You're the only body I praise
'Cause they don’t hold a candle
Yeah, they don’t hold a candle
To you
