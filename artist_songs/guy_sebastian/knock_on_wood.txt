I don't want to lose you, this good thing that I got cause if I do
I will surely, surely lose a lot
cause your love is better than any love I know
it's like thunder and lightning
the way you love me is frightening
you better knock (knock) on wood, baby, I better knock

I'm not superstitious about ya but I can't take no chance
I got me spinning, baby, you know I'm in a trance
cause your love is better than any love I know
it's like thunder and lightning
the way you love me is frightening
you better knock (knock) on wood, baby, I better knock

It's no secret about it, that woman is my loving cup
cause she sees to it that I get enough
just one touch from here, you know it means so much
it's like thunder and lightning
the way you love me is frightening
you better knock (knock, knock) on wood, baby, I better knock

Think I better knock, knock, knock on wood
think I better knock, knock, knock on wood
