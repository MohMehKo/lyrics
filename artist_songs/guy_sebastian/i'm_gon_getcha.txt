Baby let me take this chance to review
Everything I'm feelin' when I'm with you
I think it's 'bout time we set this thing straight
I know you feel it too, so
Baby don't ya get all coy with me
Cos I know that you like this boy you see
As much as you ignore it won't go away
Oh baby...

I don't need to read between the lines
Cos baby nothing ever felt so right
I ain't gonna leave until you're mine
(You know I'm gon getcha)

[Chorus]
Girl, don't try to hide that smile
Cos I see it in your eyes
And I can tell you're excited, cos
You know I'm gon getcha!!!
Girl, this feeling can't go unheard
Won't stop till you're in my world
And baby I just can't hide it
You know I'm gon getcha!!!

Never been the kind to tolerate playin' games
It's just when I see two people feelin' the da same
It doesn't take a scientist to explain
You gotta get up, get up, get movin'

So baby tell me what you gonna do
Cos what you feel for me I feel for you
As much as you ignore it won't go away

I ain't gotta read between the lines
Cos baby nothing ever felt so right
(You know I'm gon getcha)

[Chorus]

Baby you're so fine
And if it takes all night
To getcha by my side
Won't stop till your mine

(Girl ya know I'm gotta getcha getcha)
(Girl ya know I'm gotta getcha getcha)
(Girl I gotta getcha getcha)
Baby I won't leave here until you're my...

[Chorus]
