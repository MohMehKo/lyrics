Your a jack of all trades but a master of none
Cos you forgot to be my lover you never made me number one
A little birdy told me that you were up to no good
But to be honest im not bothered girl I just got To see you soon

You say that you got things to do
I know your busy, but I am too
It may be late, I got no shame
So is it too late to ask you baby

For a little more attention
To relieve the tension
Wont you give me some attention
To relieve the tension

Give me some attention

See im not asking for your hand
I just want to know where I stand
But you keep taking out insurance
Youre always making back up plans
But how can u break your heart babe
If its never there to damage
Tell me how can I save this love
If you give me nothing to salvage

So if you know then let me know
Come on and get me or let me go
Dont play these games coz I cant wait
So is it too late to ask you baby

[Chorus]

I dont even bother tryin to find another
Cause I cant get enough of you
The little that you give me, its enough to keep me
I cant get enough of you

So if you know then let me know
Come on and get me or let me go
Dont play these games coz I cant wait
So is it too late to ask you baby

[Chorus]
