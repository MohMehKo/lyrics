Why is it so
That when it gets dark
See so much clearer
The state of your heart
Yeah it hurts through the day
But when you're in bed
That's when you lose
The war with your head

Just when you think
That you've climbed out of hell
All you need is a trigger
Like a familiar smell
Then you're drowning in memories
You can't erase
Cause no one can take their place

One of us is stronger
One of us can stay awake
And one of us can not send a message at 3am
Saying I miss you babe
One of us needs longer,
One of us is one with crying
One of us don't feel like they die
Whenever they realise this is not a dream
I just wish that one of us was me

I don't want to hear about fish in the sea
Or that I can do better
That it's just meant to be
Cause if there is a reason that I can't find one
Then I'm tired of looking
I'm tired
I'm done

The truth is I know
Its me who's at fault
Cause I took you for granted
I never gave you my all
That I held you tighter when I had the chance
And not let you slip through my hands

Cause one of us is stronger
One of us can stay awake
And one of us can not send a message at 3am
Saying I miss you babe
And one of us needs longer,
One of us is done with crying
One of us don't feel like they die
Whenever they realise
This is not a dream
I just wish that one of us was me

They say time heals all wounds
(Time heals all wounds)
But clearly time aint met you(Time aint met you)
Cos if you can't keep on understand
That I can't live without
I can't live without you

One of us is stronger
And one of us can stay awake
And one of us an not send a message at 3am
Saying I miss you babe
One of us needs longer,
One of us is one with crying
One of us don't feel like they die
Whenever they realise this is not a dream
I just wish that one of us was me

I just wish that one of us was me
