You could have just smiled, you could have just lied
Been a good girl and read those lines
We want the truth until it hurts
I wish you just smiled, I wish you just lied

How do we come back from this?

It don't matter what you say now
Your silence said it so loud
While you took your time
I read between the lines,
It's not a misdirection, it's just a simple question
You said it all, you said it all... in the pause

Why did I ask? It should be implied...
The fact that I had to should have been a sign
Another life lesson learned
Don't ask if you can't take the worst

How do we come back from this?

It don't matter what you say now
Your silence said it so loud
While you took your time
I read between the lines,
It's not a misdirection, it's just a simple question
You said it all, you said it all... in the pause

Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, aw-oh-oh
You said it all... in the pause
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, aw-oh-oh
How do we come back from this?
How do we come back from this?
Woah-oh, woah-oh
How do we come back from this?
How do we come back from this?
Woah-oh, woah-oh
(Can we come back...)
How do we come back from this?
How do we come back from this?
Woah-oh, woah-oh

It don't matter what you say now
Your silence said it so loud
While you took your time
I read between the lines,
It's not a misdirection, it's such a simple question
You said it all, you said it all... in the pause

Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, aw-oh-oh
You said it all in the pause
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, aw-oh-oh
You said it all...
