I thought that I would follow my heart
So I wandered out from where you are
And I let her garden tempt me

But now all I wanna do is come home 
Coz where you are is where I belong
And without you I am empty

So now I gotta let cha 
go until I get cha
Im gunna beg borrow and steal 
to show you baby I am for real

[Chorus]
I've been up I've been down ive been playing around 
but baby I'm comin home
If you take me I swear ill always be there so baby I'm comin home
To where I should have been all along

See I know I don't deserve a second chance
But I wont take your love for granted again
How I long to hold an kiss you

So please tell me there's a place in your heart that wants to go back to the start
Plain and simple love I miss you

So now I gotta let cha go until I get cha
Im gunna beg borrow and steal 
to show you baby I am for real

[Chorus]

Coz I can't stay away from your love one more day so baby I'm comin home
To where I should have been all along

So now I gotta let cha go until I get cha
Im gunna beg borrow and steal to show you baby I am for real

[Chorus]
