I never thought iwould meet
a girl like Emily
with her ocean eyes and her crazy smile
suddenly she and me
were talking about all them dreams of walking down the aisle

Should have known she would go
and leave me all alone
how could i believe i was the only guy
I wish that i could have seen
what was right in front of me
it's true, love makes you blind

[Chorus:]
Emily was meant for me 
I thought we'd be in love for eternity
but the master plan
had the upper hand 
in a story of a single man
tell me how this story ends

Let me tell you about Sherilee
she brought me to my knees
cos physically she was the prototype
always looking so heavenly
but her personality was showing signs her head ain't right
she wouldn't stop calling me
checking up on me every time I leave
started stalking me
she was popping up everywhere I would be
it's a poisonous recipe
I know the only remedy is to make her just a memory

[Chorus:]
Sherilee was ment for me
I thought we'd be in love for eternity
but the master plan
had the upper hand 
in a story of a single man
tell me how this story ends

I don't want another love gone wrong
just another name within  this song
my heart is saying no more
I can't close the door
how will I ever know 
if she's the one for sure

[Chorus:]
Who will be the one for me
someone i can love for eternity
I know I don't understand
but there's a master plan
in a story of a single man 
tell me how this story ends
