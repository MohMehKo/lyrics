A million hearts are hurting cause they love you
Close your eyes and feel their arms around you now
Baby just like me I'm sure they're thinking of you
But know somehow this will all work out
I sat up on the roof
And stare at the stars now
For a reason why or something I can do
Every thing that mattered yesterday so far now
Away from you
What you're going through.. baby
But just you hold on girl (you gotta get through this)
Yes you are, and try to be strong girl (you know you can do this)
Cause baby love will conquer all
And it won't be long before you'll be dancing in the rain again
My beautiful friend
My beautiful friend..
If you ever feel there's no strength left inside you
Just know I'm by your side and holding your hand tight
Sometimes the moon is all the light you need to guide you
Through the darkest night
Let me be the light.. yeah
But just you hold on (you gotta get through this)
Yes you are, yes you are, and try to be strong (you know you can do this)
Cause baby love will conquer all
And it won't be long before you'll be dancing in the rain again

The desert soon will turn to bloom
You'll start to feel a change in you
The sky will seem a deeper blue than it ever was before
A whole new world will open up as you stand face to face with love
And though I can't imagine how you'll be more beautiful than you are now 
(You gotta get through this)
Don't you be afraid girl just hold on (you know you can do this)
The only thing I'm sure of is that love will conquer all
And it won't be long before you'll be dancing in the rain again
Won't you save me one dance with you then?
My beautiful friend
