I can be a mystery cover up my heart
Never show my emotion always keep you in the dark
I could find funny line impress you for a while
Hide the way that I'm feeling behind the smile
But I don't wanna lie be something that I'm not
And promise you the moon and stars but I swear to you my love
[Chorus]
Just as I am
I give myself to you
Just as I am
I'll never make it through
Cause you are the love I need 
The life inside of me
So here I stand
Just as I am
I can try play it shy or charm you with my words
Let you see through the sweetheart show me it would never work
I could then not pretend and tell you how I feel
Cause its a chance worth taking with a love so real
Now I don't wanna lie be something that I'm not
And promise you the moon and stars but I swear to you my love
[Repeat Chorus]
And we'll be together for always
Cause true colours never lie
You're my everything
My life is in your hands
So take me Just as I am....oh I....
I give myself to you
And Just as I am....oh I....
I'll never make it through
Cause you are the love I need 
The life inside of me
So here I stand
Just as I am.... yeah....
Give myself to my baby
Never make it through...
So here I stand Just as I am
