I nearly gave up
And hang up the gloves
‘Cause I had nothing worth fighting for

Just when I stopped looking
That’s when you came knocking
And thank God I opened that door
Yeah this time I’m holding on

‘Cause honey I know
‘Cause I feel it when we touch
And it’s only getting deeper
And it’s so clear
‘Cause I just can’t get enough
And I only had to meet you
And I knew I found a keeper

What did I do to deserve
This sweet kind of love
It’s hard to imagine life without
(Don’t leave a woman trying)

So from here right in
I’ll do anything
To make sure you never ever doubt
Then I’ll never ever let you go

‘Cause honey I know
‘Cause I feel it when we touch
And it’s only getting deeper
And it’s so clear
‘Cause I just can’t get enough
And I only had to meet you
And I knew I found a keeper

It was quick and it hit me like a tone of bricks
But I knew right away that you’re here to stay for sure
When you know you just know
And you cannot but let it show
My heart’s on my sleeve
It’s easy to see that I am yours

‘Cause honey I know
‘Cause I feel it when we touch
And it’s only getting deeper
And it’s so clear
‘Cause I just can’t get enough
And I only had to meet you
And I knew I found a keeper 

‘Cause honey I know
‘Cause I feel it when we touch
And it’s only getting deeper
And it’s so clear
‘Cause I just can’t get enough
And I only had to meet you
And I knew I found a keeper
