I, I don't know what I should do coz the longer I go the more that I know I'm chasin shadows with you

And she is as sweet as she can be 
she's a real bombshell we get along well 
but something is incomplete

Somethins not right but nothins really wrong 
in my heart I can tell that I'm stringin her along tell me what should I do baby I hope your missin me to

[Chorus]
Coz I can try I can try but I know I'll never I know I'll never fall or give her my all 
coz she'll never be you 
and I can lie I can lie and tell you that she's better 
but I'll always compare as long as I am aware 
that she'll never be you

She'll never be no she'll never be she'll never be no she'll never be she'll never be no she will never be you

I know yes I know it's far from fair how I bought her perfume the dress and the shoes the same that you used to wear
If I can't get u off my mind I gotta let the girl go 
its wrong and I know I'm only wasting her time

Somethins not right but nothins really wrong 
in my heart I can tell that I'm stringin her along tell me what should I do baby I hope your missin me to

[Chorus]

She'll never be no she'll never be she'll never be no she'll never be she'll never be no she will never be you

The harder I try the harder it seems 
and she would be perfect if she was in someone else's dreams 
so we sleep alone baby even when we sleep together

[Chorus x2]

She'll never be no she'll never be she'll never be no she'll never be she'll never be no she will never be you
