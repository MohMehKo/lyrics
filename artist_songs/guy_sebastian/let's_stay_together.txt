(Let's stay together)

I, I'm so in love with you
Whatever you want to do is alright with me
Cause you make me feel so brand-new
And I want to spend my life with you

Let me say that since, baby, since we've been together
Loving you forever is what I need
Let me be the one you come runnin' to, I'll never be untrue

Oh baby, let's, let's stay together
Loving you whether, whether
Times are good or bad, happy or sad

Baby, whether times are good or bad, happy or sad

Why, somebody, why people break up
Oh, turn around and make up, I just can't see
You'd never do that to me (would you, baby)
Being around you is all I see
Here's what I want us to do

Let's, we oughta stay together (together)
Loving you whether, whether
Times are good or bad, happy or sad
(Come on) Let's, let's stay together
Loving you whether, whether
Times are good or bad, happy or sad
