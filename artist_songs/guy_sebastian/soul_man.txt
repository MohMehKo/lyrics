Comin' to you on a dusty road
Good lovin', I got a truckload
And when ya get it, ha
You got somethin'
So don't worry, cos I'm comin'

I'm a soul man
I'm a soul man
I'm a soul man
I'm a soul man

Got what I got the hard way
And I'll make it better
Each and every day
So honey don't you fret
Cos you ain't seen nothing yet 

I'm a soul man
I'm a soul man (play it Steve)
I'm a soul man
I'm a soul man

I was brought up on a side street (listen now)
I learned how to love before I could eat
I was educated at Woodstock
When I start lovin'
Oh I can't stop

I'm a soul man
I'm a soul man
I'm a soul man
I'm a soul man

Grab the rope
And I'll pull you in
Give you hope
And be your only boyfriend, yeah
(Yeah) yeah (yeah)

(I'm talkin' about a) soul man
(I'm a) soul man
(And you) soul man
(Ah) soul man
(Oh lord) soul man
(I'm a) soul man
(And you) soul man
