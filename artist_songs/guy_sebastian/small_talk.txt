I'm so greedy when I want it
Yeah, got my hungry eyes on you
(Eyes on you, yeah)
Six inch shoes, black dress you own it
Oh that body makes me lose my mind

It will be criminal if we don't break in this moment
The bottle is empty but all of these feelings keep pouring
We treading through words but I just want to get this shit going

We both know we've done enough
Small talk
Small talk
And what good is it if it's just
Small talk?
Small talk
Whooo
We've got no time to waste
Body communicate
Cut to the chase
We know that we've done enough
Small talk

Not like I'm all done with listening
I'm not trying to be rude, don't confuse
This is precious time we're losing
No more thinking, let's just do
The most

It will be criminal if we don't break in this moment
The bottle is empty but all of these feelings keep pouring
We treading through words but I just want to get this shit going

We both know we've done enough
Small talk
Small talk
And what good is it if it's just
Small talk?
Small talk
Whooo
We've got no time to waste
Body communicate
Cut to the chase
We know that we've done enough
Small talk

Take a second darling just breathe
Right now, we're about to go deep
It's time to let our bodies speak

We both know we've done enough
Small talk
Small talk
And what good is it if it's just
Small talk?
Small talk
Whooo
We've got no time to waste
Body communicate
Cut to the chase
We know that we've done enough
Small talk
