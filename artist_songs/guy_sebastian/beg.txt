I'm calling and calling
Still you had the heart to hit ignore
Emotions see sore in
So tell me how am I supposed to give more

It's getting colder where we stand
And I'm trying to touch your hand
But you're just out of reach
And all I'm really tryin' to say
Is can you meet me halfway?
But if you're staying there instead

I'm not gonna beg
I'm not gonna make you want me
I'm not gonna fall to my knees
I shouldn't have to say please
I'm not gonna beg
'Cause this is beyond unfair
You should wanna be here
And give my life for love
But I'm not gonna beg

It's your way or the highway
There's only so much bend before I break
And it's like I paddled into a tidal wave
And now I feel like all is lost in its wake

It's getting older every day
I'm holding on but I'm afraid
It's not all in my head
There's nothing more that I can say
You gotta meet me halfway?
But if you're staying there instead

I'm not gonna beg
I'm not gonna make you want me
I'm not gonna fall to my knees
I shouldn't have to say please
I'm not gonna beg
'Cause this is beyond unfair
You should wanna be here
And give my life for love
But I'm not gonna beg

You shouldn't feel like this feel like this baby no
We should be in this together
And if it stays like this, stays like this you know
I won't be here forever no, no

I'm not gonna beg
I'm not gonna make you want me
I'm not gonna fall to my knees
I shouldn't have to say please
I'm not gonna beg
'Cause this is beyond unfair
You should wanna be here
And give my life for love
But I'm not gonna beg
I'm not gonna beg
I'm not gonna beg
