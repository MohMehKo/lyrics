How, could he ever love you, the way I could
Oh and how could he ever hold you the way, I would
If you only knew each night, what I go through

While my heart is breaking your a making
Someone else's dream come true
I gotta know how
How does it feel to be loved by you 
I gotta know how
Just how it feels to be touched by you 
I've never said before
But I can't take it anymore
I gotta know how
Just how it feels to be loved by you

Oohh I wanna live everyday with you
And I wanna die the same day as you
I try to aphratise and tell you through my eyes
That girl I lost my pride so long ago
I'll even sing a song just to let you know

I gotta know how
How does it feel to be loved by you 
Girl you know I'd never treat you wrong
I'll be there for you babe
I can spend a lifetime in your arms
I'll be there for you

If you only knew
Each night, what I go through
While my heart is breakin you're a making
Someone else's dreams come true

I gotta know how
How does it feel to be loved by you 
I gotta know how
Just how it feels to be touched by you 
I've never said before
But I can't take it anymore
I gotta know how
Just how it feels to be loved by you
