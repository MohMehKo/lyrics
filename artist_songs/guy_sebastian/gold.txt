Ladies on the street now
Looking mighty sweet now
Give a little smile and shaking their thing at me
But baby it's cool (Baby it's cool)
I'm looking at you (I'm looking at you)
Cause you are gold
Oh baby you're gold, yeah

I'm about to tell ya I got something on my mind
What we got I know I know is all so hard to find
Don't know why (I don't know why)
Must have done something right (Done something right)
Cause we got gold
Oh girl, we got gold

Cause we got gold
We got gold, gold, gold
Early in the morning (Gold)
In the midnight hour (Gold)
Oh girl you're really something (Gold)

All the fellas walk past
Checking out your assets
Look all you want she's comin' on home with me
I got pocket aces (I got pocket aces)
And I ain't gonna waste it (And I ain't gonna waste it
Cause you are gold
Oh baby you're gold

I'm about to tell ya I got something on my mind
What we got I know I know is all so hard to find
Don't know why (I don't know why)
Must have done something right (Done something right)
Cause we got gold
Oh girl, we got gold

We got gold, gold, gold
Early in the morning (Gold)
