Do you remember how we made it through the rain
Said together we'd remain, you and me, in love forever, 
Never imagined we would go our separate ways
That my life would be a maze
Hoping to find you at the end

Can we just love again?
Kiss again?
I just wanna be us again
There's no reason to pretend
It's evident that I'm lost without your love
If we just hold each other close again
We can make it to the very end
Baby I will leave you never
I just wanna spend forever with you

How can I forget
Was when you came I knew for sure
What my heart was beating for
How could I take you for granted
And now that your gone
Every day is so unclear
I think I'm running out of tears
How can I get back to life with you're here with me

Can we just love again?
Kiss again?
I just wanna be us again
There's no reason to pretend
It's evident that I'm lost without your love
If we just hold each other close again
We can make it to the very end
Baby I will leave you never
I just wanna spend forever with you

If we give up our minds
And let the feeling that I have just take over
Maybe then we'll see
How this life should be
Before my heart
Falls apart
For you

Can we just love again?
Kiss again?
I just wanna be us again
There's no reason to pretend
It's evident that I'm lost without your love
If we just hold each other close again
We can make it to the very end
Baby I will leave you never
I just wanna spend forever with you
