Ain’t gotta worry about the sun
We’ll pretend it won’t rise
Don’t bother setting the alarm
We’ll be away the whole time
Got a beauty that makes a grown man cry
It’s the only time I feel alive

And I just wanna throw these
Sheets over our head
And run around this paradise, paradise

I must’ve died and gone to heaven
It’s so incredible
So please don’t never end, don’t never end
I hope this feeling last forever
‘Cause I’m in heaven
So please don’t never end, don’t never end

You ought’ve turned off your mind
But still taking everything in
Or just listen to your body baby
And maybe there ain’t no rooms tonight
We can go wherever you feel like

‘Cause I just wanna throw these
Sheets over our head
And run around this paradise, paradise

I must’ve died and gone to heaven
It’s so incredible
So please don’t never end, don’t never end
I hope this feeling last forever
‘Cause I’m in heaven
So please don’t never end, don’t never end

Your light is shining so bright
Can’t even open my eyes
Got ours wings wrapped around each other
It’s getting so warm inside
And I just wanna fly with you
Maybe I could lie with you
Every minute of every day
I’ll wait

I must’ve died and gone to heaven
It’s so incredible
So please don’t never end, don’t never end
I hope this feeling last forever
‘Cause I’m in heaven
So please don’t never end, don’t never end 

I must’ve died and gone to heaven
It’s so incredible
So please don’t never end, don’t never end
I hope this feeling last forever
‘Cause I’m in heaven
So please don’t never end, don’t never end
