On a perfect day
I know that I can count on you
When that's not possible
Tell me can you weather thestorm
'cause I need somebody who will stand by me
Through the good times and the bad times
She would always, always be right there 
Sunny days everybody loves them, tell me baby
Can you stand the rain
Storms will come, this we know for sure (this we know for sure)
Can you stand the rain
Love unconditional
I'm not asking this of you
See we gotta make it last
I'll do whatever needs to be done
Cause I need somebody who will stand by me
Through the good times and the bad times
She will always, always be right there for me.
Sunny days everybody loves them, tell me
Can you stand the rain
Storms will come (oo yes it will)
this we know for sure (this we know for sure)
Can you stand the rain
