These little balls, they can try, they can try
But they never holding us back
And these little tubes they don't keep you alive
Only our love can do that

Let's both pretend that this bed can fly
It's our little secret, only us in the sky
If you'll get tired baby I will take the wheel
Imagine the sunrise with me
We imagine the sunrise, don't we?

These little bones, maybe fragile, they say
But you have a heart of a lion
And no matter what they get throw away
Somehow you manage all smile

Let's both pretend that this bed can fly
It's our little secret, only us in the sky
If you'll get tired baby I will take the wheel
Imagine the sunrise with me
We imagine the sunrise, don't we?

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh,
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh,

Let's both pretend that this bed can fly
It's our little secret, only us in the sky
Oh, if you'll get tired baby I will take the wheel
Imagine the sunrise with me
We imagine the sunrise, don't we?
Imagine the sunrise
