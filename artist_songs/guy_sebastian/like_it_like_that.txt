Ain't it a funny thing, How you run to me
When he sends you spinning out of control to the N-th degree
You know I make it right, I'm at your command
You can tell me anything you want,
You know I'm gonna understand

I won't let you down, break it down-d-down-d-down
Never let you down, break it down

Hey-yo, do ya like it like that
I'm the only one who can love ya like that
Now, Hey-yo, do ya like it like that
I'm the only one who can love ya like that, hey

So should I shut my mouth, And should I hide my heart
Or should I let it out into the light, That you and him should be apart
Is he hangin on, To every word you speak
Does he rub your back and play with your hair until u fall asleep
I don't think so, baby

I won't let you down, break it down-d-down-d-down
Never let you down, break it down

Hey-yo, do ya like it like that
I'm the only one who can love ya like that
Now, Hey-yo, do ya like it like that
I'm the only one who can love ya like that
Now, Hey-yo, do ya like it like that
I'm the only one who can love ya like that
Now, Hey-yo, do ya like it like that
I'm the only one who can love ya like that

He might say he's in love with you
But he'll never do the things that I can do
You can be your watch with the diamond band
Because I know your better than the back of your hand

Now, Hey-yo, do ya like it like that
I'm the only one who can love ya like that
Now, Hey-yo, do ya like it like that
I'm the only one who can love ya like that
Now, Hey-yo, do ya like it like that
I'm the only one who can love ya like that
Hey-yo, do ya like it like that
Baby I'm the only one, Oh oh oh
Hey-yo, do ya like it like that
I'm the only one who can love ya like that
Now, Hey-yo
I'm the only one who can love ya, love ya, love ya, like that
Hey-yo, do ya like it like that
I'm the only one who can love ya like that (Who can love ya like that)
Hey-yo, do ya like it like that
I'm the only one who can love ya like that (Tell me baby who can love ya like that)
Hey-yo, do ya like it like that (Nobody baby)
I'm the only one who can love ya like that
Hey-yo, do ya like it like that (Nobody baby)
No one can love ya like that
Hey-yo, do ya like it like that
I'm the only one who can love ya like that [x5]
