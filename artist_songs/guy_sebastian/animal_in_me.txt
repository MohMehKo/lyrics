[Verse 1:]
Most days I stayed backed up against the wall
Don't fight it, keep quiet, do what I'm told
Go with it, don't risk it, I might break the mold
How do I make my great escape?

[Pre-Chorus:]
I gotta break outta this cage
Will somebody sound the alarm?
Cause I'm locked and I'm loaded, I'm armed
Woah oh, woah oh

[Chorus:]
Tonight I'm gonna break free, are you with me?
We're lion's on the run, we're reckless and we're young
Gonna break free, they can't stop me
Tonight you're gonna see the animal in me, yeah
Animal in me, yeah, animal in me, yeah

[Verse 2:]
They typed, they talked, they can say what they want
Ain't changin', no shame, yeah, we do nothin' wrong
Cause I'm happy, you're happy, we are who we are
So put yo hands up high and say

[Pre-Chorus:]
I gotta break outta this cage
Will somebody sound the alarm?
Cause I'm locked and I'm loaded, I'm armed
Woah oh, woah oh

[Chorus:]
Tonight I'm gonna break free, are you with me?
We're lion's on the run, we're reckless and we're young
Gonna break free, they can't stop me
Tonight you're gonna see the animal in me, yeah
Animal in me, yeah, animal in me, yeah

[Bridge:]
And the horns say
And the horns say
And the horns say
And the horns say, yeah aye yeah

[Chorus:]
Tonight I'm gonna break free, are you with me?
We're lion's on the run, we're reckless and we're young
Gonna break free, they can't stop me
Tonight you're gonna see the animal in me, yeah
Animal in me, yeah, animal in me, yeah
