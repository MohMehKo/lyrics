I used to sit and wonder 
Why I couldn't win 
Losin' every war 
Just trying to fit in 
So afraid I 
Couldn't stand straight 
It took a little while 
But I realized 
Who I am is who I am and that’s alright 
Now I don't care what 
Anybody says

I don't do the things you do 
I dress a little different too 
Don't matter if it bothers you 
It’s cool 

Imagine if we’re all the same 
Man that would be so lame 
So throw a square in the air 
And sing with me

Yeah I dare to be different 
This is just who I am 
If you don't understand me I don't care 
Yeah I dare to be different 
This is just who I am 
Cause I dare-eh-eh to be square-eh-eh-air

Spending all your time 
Trying to take my shine 
Well let me tell you how 
I'm gonna spend mine 
I’m gonna work hard 
Till I touch the sky

Cause I don't really care ‘bout cool 
If it means I gotta act like you 
And I don't wanna change a thing
About me 

Imagine if we’re all the same 
Man that would be so lame 
So throw a square in the air 
And sing with me, yeah

Yeah I dare to be different 
This is just who I am 
If you don't understand me I don't care 
Yeah I dare to be different 
This is just who I am 
Cause I dare-eh-eh to be square-eh-eh-air

Oh, you’re gonna hear me roar
You’re gonna see me soar
No nothin’s gonna bring me down
Gonna bring me down
Gonna bring me down

Yeah I dare to be different 
This is just who I am 
If you don't understand me I don't care 
Yeah I dare to be different 
This is just who I am 
Cause I dare-eh-eh to be square-eh-eh-air

So throw a square-eh-eh in the air-eh-eh-air
So throw a square-eh-eh in the air-eh-eh-air
So throw a square-eh-eh in the air-eh-eh-air
Everybody throw a square-eh-eh in the air-eh-eh-air
