Everyday feels all the same
9 to 5 gets so mundane
But something breaks with just one glimpse of you
I would stare so long awhile
Trying to tell you with my eyes
I didn't say a thing I thought you knew

I wish I never did assume, cos...

[Chorus]
I was gonna tell you today
I even wrote the words I would say
I finally found the courage
But now it's too far
It took me all this time to reveal
What everything about you does to me
So tell me why did I keep a cover on my heart

Spend all night trying to explore just
How I'd tell you I adore ya
And how I'm moved by every word you say

But today there's an empty space
I've found you gone without a trace
I wish that I coulda told you yesterday

[Chorus]

It feels like my point of existence
Has vanished with you in the distance
Whatever it takes I'll persist
Till I see your face again

[Chorus]
