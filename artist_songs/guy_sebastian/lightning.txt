When I hear the thunder
I run to the rain
Just wishing that somehow
You'd find me again
I stand with my hands to the sky
Saying prayers in the night
Hoping they ain't right
And the lightning does strike twice

(Light me up, light light me up)

Two strangers knew the danger
Put our foot on the gas, speed racer
Couldn't phase you, you're a lied one
Said keep driving into the horizon

It's a bit crashed, but still flying
Told them they would be wrong like the Mayans
So we live like we're on an island
But we had no plans for surviving

Oh, where are you going?
(I don't know)
Tell me where did you go

When I hear the thunder
I run to the rain
Just wishing that somehow
You'd find me again
I stand with my hands to the sky
Saying prayers in the night
Hoping they ain't right
And the lightning does strike twice

Couldn't deny the attraction
All the madness, the fire, the passion
We had magic, we had fusion
But we couldn't get 'bove the illusion

We throw the desk, high rolling
Play every hit, now folding
We're on a losing run
I wanna play, but we're out of fun

Oh, where are you going?
(I don't know)
Tell me where did you go

When I hear the thunder
I run to the rain
Just wishing that somehow
You'd find me again
I stand with my hands to the sky
Saying prayers in the night
Hoping they ain't right
And the lightning does strike twice

What if I wait forever
And what if I wait too
But only to discover
That what they say is true
That we blew our only chance

When I hear the thunder
I run to the rain
Just wishing that somehow
You'd find me again
I stand with my hands to the sky
Saying prayers in the night
Hoping they ain't right
And the lightning does strike twice

(Light me up, light light me up
Light me up, light light me up
Light me up, light light me up
Light me up, light me up)

Light me again
(Light me up, light light me up)
Light me again
(Light me up, light light me up)
Light me again
(Light me up, light light me up)
And the lightning does strike twice
