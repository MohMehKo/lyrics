A Terrible Signal
Too Weak To Even Recognize
A Gentle Collapsing
The Removal Of The Insides

I'm Touched By Your Pleas
I Value These Moments
We're Order Than We Realize
...In Someone's Eyes

A Frequent Returning
And Leaving Unnoticed
A Condition Of Mercy
A Change In The Weather

A View To Remember
The Center Is Missing
They Question How The Future Lies
...In Someone's Eyes
The Gentle Collapsing
Of Every Surface
We Travel On The Quiet Road
...The Overload
