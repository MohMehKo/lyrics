Something's gotta give
Something always becomes the prey
Of who we are, and how we live each day

Something's gotta give
Something never will be the same
But we won't know if we do not change
And we don't know
What's around the bend
And it can't be planned for

I cannot see why you're dying inside of me
Why everything is colliding in front of me
Something's got to give
Something's got to give
What will it be?
What will it be?

Someone's gotta give
Someone's gotta love in a way that never ends,
That heals you every day
Cause every day I live,
Every day I'm one step away
From what I fear
And what I cannot change
I still don't know
What's around the bend
And it can't be planned for

I cannot see why you're dying inside of me
Why everything is colliding in front of me
Something's got to give
Something's got to give
What will it be?
What will it be?

Something's got to giveÂ 

What will it be?
What will it be?

I cannot see why you're dying inside of me
Why everything is colliding in front of me
Something's got to give
Something's got to give
What will it be?
What will it be?

What will it be?
What will it be?
