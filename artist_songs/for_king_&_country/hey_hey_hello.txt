Yeah, you're the guy, V-neck and tie
You play your vinyl forty-fives
You don't think I'm cool, I'm too stock for you
No pointy shoes, and no tattoos
Sittin' in your loft, you love to scoff
So glad you're not workin' a job
Yeah, you're the guy, you overtry
And I am sick of it

Hey hey hello
I'm singing a pop song, about you
Oh, oh, no
Hey hey hello
You're not gonna hear it
You're too good for radio
You're legit, full of it
So indie, rock and roll
Hey hey hello
I'm singing about you
But you won't ever know

You try to fit in with your liberal friends
But then you vote Republican
You know two words in French and think you're fluent
Bonjour, vous Ãªtes un idiot
You're not from Europe, so don't act like it
And why don't you drop the accent
You poor tortured soul
Everybody knows that you are faking it

Hey hey hello
I'm singing a pop song, about you
Oh, oh, no
Hey hey hello
You're not gonna hear it
You're too good for radio
You're legit, full of it
So indie, rock and roll
Hey hey hello
I'm singing about you
But you won't ever know

Yeah, you're that guy
But you don't have to be
So don't, so don't try so hard
Just be, just be, yeah

Hey hey hello
I'm singing a pop song, about you
Oh, oh, no
Hey hey hello
You're not gonna hear it
You're too good for radio

Hey hey hello
I'm singing a pop song, about you
Oh, oh, no
Hey hey hello
You're not gonna hear it
You're too good for radio
You're legit, full of it
So indie, rock and roll
Hey hey hello
I'm singing about you
But you won't ever know
Yeah, yeah, never know

Yeah, you'd love this song
If there was no one who'd ever heard it
