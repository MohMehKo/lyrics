[Luke Smallbone:]
I see you dressed in white
Every wrong made right
I see a rose in bloom
At the sight of you
You're irreplaceable, unmistakable, incomparable
Darling, it's beautiful
I see it all in you

[Joel Smallbone:]
No matter what you've heard, this is what your worth
More than all the money or the diamonds and pearls
This is who you are
Yes, this is who you are

[Joel & Luke:]
So when it's late, you're wide awake
To much to take
Don't you dare forget that in the pain
You can be brave, give me safe

[Luke Smallbone:]
I see you dressed in white
Every wrong made right
I see a rose in bloom
At the sight of you
Irreplaceable, unmistakable, incomparable
Darling, it's beautiful
I see it all in you

[Bianca Santos and Joel Smallbone:]
Sisters, we can start again
Give honor till the end
Love, we can start again (oh oh)
Brothers, we can start again
Give honor till the end
Yes, we can start again
We can start again
We can start again
