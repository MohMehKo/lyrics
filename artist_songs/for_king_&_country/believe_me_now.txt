Blame it on the fact that I was so naive
I put the pain inside your heart
Can't fix the past with just an apology
But it's still a real good place to start

Believe me now
Cause I gotta tell you,
I gotta show you how
I'm not the way I used to be

Love never failed you,
I was the one who missed the mark
Could you remember me for more
Than what I didn't do?
So here I am, I'm begging you for one more chance
To make this right, to fight for you

Believe me now
Cause I gotta tell you,
I gotta show you how
I'm not the way I used to be
Believe me now
I'm not gonna hurt you,
Not gonna let you down
Oh please, just don't give up on me

Time will only tell
If you can trust me with yourself now
I'll tell you once, but I'll show you a thousand times
I'm sorry that I made you cry

Believe me now
Cause I gotta tell you,
I gotta show you how
I'm not the way I used to be

Believe me now
Cause I gotta tell you,
I gotta show you how
I'm not the way I used to be
Believe me now
I'm not gonna hurt you,
Not gonna let you down
Oh please, just don't give up on me

Believe me now
Believe me now
Believe me now
Believe me now
Believe me now
Believe me now
Believe me now
Believe me now
