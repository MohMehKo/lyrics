Look how far we've come
Look where we started from
Best thing about it is you know we've only just begun
They say life's a dance
10 percent circumstance but
What great adventure ever plays out just the way you've planned it

We'll fly into the turbulence
No telling where we're gonna land
Isn't that just part of this romance?

So when I'm stuck out in the cold
Let me be warm-hearted
When it weighs too much to hold
Let me be light-hearted
When all I have is not enough
Won't be broken hearted
Cuz you taught me how to love, to live to learn
To live whole hearted
Oh wholehearted

Should we take the easy life?
Should we take the smoother ride?
No need to ask, I see the answer written in your eyes
So sail the ship onto the sand
No telling where we're gonna land
Oh that's just part of our romance

When I'm stuck out in the cold
Let me be warm-hearted
When it weighs too much to hold
Let me be light-hearted
When all I have is not enough
Won't be broken-hearted
Cuz you taught me how to love, to live to learn
To love, to live whole hearted

(yeah) (oh wholehearted)
(oh) (oh wholehearted)
(yeah) (oh wholehearted)
(oh) (oh wholehearted)
When you love somebody
(yeah) (oh wholehearted)
(oh) (oh wholehearted)

When you love somebody
Oh wholehearted
On and on and on we'll go
And to our lives through the unknown
On and on and on we'll fly
Write the legend of our lives
On and on and on we'll fly
For every day and every night
The greatest stories ever told
Were written with a heart that's
Whole

So when I'm stuck out in the cold
Let me be warm-hearted
When it weighs too much to hold
Let me be light-hearted
When I'm stuck out in the cold! (let me be warm-hearted)
When it weighs too much to hold! (let me be light-hearted)
When all I have is not enough
Won't be broken-hearted
Cuz you taught me how to love, to live, to learn
To love, to live whole hearted
Whole wholehearted
When you love somebody
[x2]
You live wholehearted

Wholehearted
Whole, wholehearted
Oh you taught me how to love, to live, to learn
To live wholehearted
