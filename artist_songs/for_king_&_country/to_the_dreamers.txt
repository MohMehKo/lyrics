Beat up but won't be broken
Lonesome but always searching
Homesick but nobody's heading home soon
Keep on, keeping on, keeping on

Long days; too many short nights
Wrong ways that almost felt right
Lovesick but no one you're holding on to
So keep on, keeping on, keeping on
And sing along, sing along, sing along... Yeah

[Chorus:]
To the dreamers
Wide-eyed believers
Hanging onto hope by a thread
To the soulful
Heart open hopeful
Keep on charging ahead
'Cause, when you feel it, once you see it, and you breathe it
It's unforgettable
When you know it, once you know it, and you hold it
It's unforgettable

God knows you question your courage
And some days I can't walk for stumbling
If we could only see what we're becoming

So keep on, keeping on, keeping on
And sing along, sing along, sing along... Yeah

[Chorus]

When you feel it, once you see it, and you breathe it,
It's unforgettable
When you know it, once you know it, and you hold it
It's unforgettable

When you feel it, once you see it, and you breathe it,
It's unforgettable
When you know it, once you know it, and you hold it
It's unforgettable

I was wondering and I was wandering
So down and out, I was lost not found
History said, oh someone said, that you could never exist
But then a whisper, start of a kiss
Came to me in all of a sudden like a dream, a fantasy
That day didn't feel quite real
You took a half dead soul and You made me believe
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe

To the dreamers
Wide-eyed believers
Hanging onto hope by a thread
To the soulful
Heart open hopeful
Keep on charging ahead

[Chorus x2]
