Lovely child, lay your head and sleep
Dream of a world full of circus rides
And golden streets
Lonely child, why are you so sad?
Why do the tears fall so easily?
You're too young to weep

So you pray
And you wait
For the better days when you'll be safe

And some day soon you'll find where you belong
Where there are no more broken lullabies

How long, child, have you been afraid?
When was the last time you laughed out loud,
The last time you played?
You build your walls with blankets from your bed
You hide underneath them, you close your eyes
And try to forget

And some day soon you'll find where you belong
And one day soon you'll leave it all behind
You'll find a place where love remains
Where there are no more broken lullabies

I know you feel like you're alone
But you're not
And I know you feel like no one knows
But you're wrong

So you pray
And you wait
But don't worry I will keep you safe

Some day soon you'll find where you belong
And one day soon you'll leave it all behind
You'll find a place where love remains
Where there are no more broken lullabies
