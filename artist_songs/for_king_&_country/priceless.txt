Mirror, mirror
Mirror on the wall
Tellin' those lies
Pointing out your flaws
That isn't who you are
That isn't who you are

It might be hard to hear
But let me tell you, dear
If you could see what I can see
I know you would believe
That isn't who you are
There's more to who you are

So when it's late
You're wide awake
Too much to take
Don't you dare forget that in the pain
You can be brave
Hear me say

I see you dressed in white
Every wrong made right
I see a rose in bloom
At the sight of you
Oh, so priceless
Irreplaceable, unmistakable, incomparable
Darling, it's beautiful
I see it all in you
Oh, so priceless

No matter what you've heard
This is what you're worth
More than all the money
Or the diamonds and pearls
Oh, this is who you are
Yeah, this is who you are

So when it's late
You're wide awake
Too much to take
Don't you dare forget
That in the pain
You can be brave
Hear me say

I see you dressed in white
Every wrong made right
I see a rose in bloom
At the sight of you
Oh, so priceless
Irreplaceable, unmistakable, incomparable
Darling, it's beautiful
I see it all in you
Oh, so priceless

Sisters, we can start again
Give honor 'til the end
Love, we can start again

Brothers, we can start again
Give honor 'til the end
Yeah, we can start again

I see you dressed in white
Every wrong made right
I see a rose in bloom
At the sight of you
Oh, so priceless
You're irreplaceable, unmistakable, incomparable
Darling, it's beautiful
I see it all in you
Oh, so priceless

I see you dressed in white
Every wrong made right
I see a rose in bloom
At the sight of you

I see you dressed in white
Every wrong made right
I see a rose in bloom
We can... at the sight of you... start again

I see you dressed in white
Every wrong made right
I see a rose in bloom
At the sight of you

I see you dressed in white
Every wrong made right
Oh, so priceless
