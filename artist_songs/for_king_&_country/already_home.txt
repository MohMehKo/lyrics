Walking through a wasteland
You better keep your head down
Oh, you never raise your eyes
Oh, you never realize

Between the moon rise and the sunset
The answer's out there somewhere
If we were only listening
If we were only listening
The skies would sing

[Chorus:]
You don't have to be broken
To see there's magic in a shooting star
When you’re lost and you’re lonesome
Let the heavens show you who you are
Look up and you'll know
That you are already home
Already home

There's something in me calling
Across the rocks without water
It's telling me to hurry back
Oh, you better hurry back

To where the moonrise meets the sunset
You'll know it when you find it
Now that you are listening
Now you're really listening
The skies will sing

[Chorus 2:]
You don't have to be broken
To see there's magic in a shooting star
When you’re lost and you’re lonesome
Let the heavens show you who you are
Look up and you'll know
That you are already home
Look up and you'll know
That you are already home
Already home

Up into the sky without a single fear
As everything that held me down disappears
Higher and higher and higher
I'm ten miles tall
I see it all

Look up and you'll know
You are already home
Look up and you'll know
You are already home
Look up and you'll know
You are already home
Won’t you look up into the sky
And see that you’re already
That you’re already home
That you’re already home
Look up into the heavens
And won’t you see that you are
And won’t you see that you are
You are already home
Already home
