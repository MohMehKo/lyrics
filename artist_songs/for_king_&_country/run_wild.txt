(Run Wild, Live Free, Love Strong)
Are the walls to lock you in or to keep others away
And if the doors were to be opened would you leave or would you stay

The comfort of your misery you cherish dearly, you cherish dearly
And you haven't started dreaming 'cause you're still fast asleep, you're fast asleep

But don't you wanna
Run wild, live free
Love strong, you and me

You're a lion full of power who forgot how to roar
You're an eagle full of beauty but you can't seem to soar

Will you return to the garden where you were first made whole
Will you turn to the one who can liberate your soul

Don't you wanna
Run wild, live free
Love strong, you and me
Run wild, live free
Love strong

To every soul locked in a cage
In the prison of your past mistakes
No, there's no time left to waste
Yeah, you can make your great escape
We're made to run wild, run wild, run wild
We're made to run wild, run wild, run wild
We're made to

[Rap:]
Run, Forest, all depends what direction
Some people run from fear, some from their own reflection
Some people run their mouth, some people run their house
Ruling with the heart of a tyrant
Some people run their block, bust shots with a 4-4-5 and
That's the environment, how we were raised
Living like lions but trapped in a cage
Back to imago dei with the blood of a king and the heart of a slave
Don't you wanna run

Run wild, live free
Love strong, you and me
Run wild, live free
Love strong

To every soul locked in a cage
In the prison of your past mistakes
No, there's no time left to waste
Yeah, you can make your great escape
We're made to run wild, run wild, run wild
We're made to run wild, run wild, run wild
We're made to

We're made to run wild, run wild, run wild
We're made to run wild, run wild, run wild

If your soul's locked in a cage
You can make the great escape
We're made to run wild, live free
Love strong, you and me
