Stand face to face with the younger me
All of the mistakes
All of the heartbreak

Love like I'm not scared
Give when it's not fair
Live life for another
Take time for a brother
Fight for the weak ones

On You

Love like I'm not scared
Give when it's not fair
Live life for another
Take time for a brother
Fight for the weak ones
Speak out for freedom

Speak out for freedom
Find faith in the battle
Stand tall but above it all
Fix my eyes on You
On You

I'll fix my eyes on you
(On you)
I'll fix my eyes on you
(On you)
