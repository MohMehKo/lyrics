Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now I'm found
Was blind but now...

I see-e-ee
I see-e-ee, oh-oh-ohh
I see-e-ee

'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first...

Belie-e-ee-ved
Belie-e-ee-ved, oh-oh-ohh
Belie-e-ee-ved

Now I see-e-ee
I see-e-ee, oh-oh-ohh
I see-e-ee

When we've been there ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we first begun
Oh when we first...

Begu-u-u-nn
Begu-u-u-nn, oh-oh-ohh
Begu-u-u-nn

Now I see-e-ee
I see-e-ee, oh-oh-ohh
I see-e-ee...
