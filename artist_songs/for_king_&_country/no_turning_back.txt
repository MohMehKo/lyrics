I used to be a beggar
Down on calloused knees
Til I got an invitation
Into the courts of the King

I’m movin’ on, I’m movin’ on
I’m movin’ on, keep moving
I’m movin’ on, I’m movin’ on
I’m movin’ on

You gave me my freedom
Now I'm free indeed

[Chorus:]
I'm marching out of the doubt into trust
Out of the me into us
No turning back, no turning back
No turning back
I’m falling head over heels into love
Leaving regret in the dust
No turning back, no turning back
No turning

No turning back, no

And If I’m caught in the crossfire
I will stand my ground
And even if I were to lose my life
Your arms are where I’ll be found

[Chorus]

No turning back, oh, oh no

I used to be a beggar
Now I’m free indeed

Out of the doubt into trust
Out of the me into us
No turning back, no turning back
No turning

[Chorus]

No turning back, oh, oh no

No turning back, no turning back
No turning back, no turning back
