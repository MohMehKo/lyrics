I see the mountains, feel the salt air
I have reasons to behold
All the wonders that never cease to be

You're as timeless as the water
You're as gentle as the fields
I caress you, oh, Cape Breton in my dreams

And you never let the hard times
Take away your soul
And you stopped the tears from falling
As you watched the young ones go

You're as peaceful as a clear day
You're as rugged as the seas
I caress you, oh, Cape Breton in my dreams

And home I'll be
Home I'll be
Banish thoughts of leaving
Home I'll be

I see the blue lakes, feel the passion
I have reasons to believe
There are places that will bring you to your knees

I hear voices they are calling

I have reason to pay heed
I caress you, oh, Cape Breton in my dreams

And you kept your arms wide open
To let your children know
Wherever there is distance
The heart is always home

You're as soulful as a choir
You're as ancient as the hills
I caress you, oh, Cape Breton in my dreams

And home I'll be
Home I'll be
Banish thoughts of leaving
Home I'll be

And home I'll be
Home I'll be
Banish thoughts of leaving
Home I'll be

Banish thoughts of leaving
Home I'll be
