All my soul is troubled
All my will is worn
Tired and discouraged
Trampled on and torn
Every breath a battle
Every step a war
My heart-broken vessel
This night an angry storm
When sadness crashes like an ocean
When fear is deeper than the sea
When I am swallowed by the darkness
Will you come and anchor me?
I cannot see through this
Can you be my eyes?
I'm completely hopeless
Can you shine a light?
I have no more strength left
Can you stand and fight?
I'm dying in this doubt
Can you be my faith tonight?
When sadness crashes like an ocean
When fear is deeper than the sea
When I am swallowed by the darkness
Will you come and anchor me?
Hold me still and hold me close
Until it all passes away
I beg you not to let go
All I really have to know
Is that you are here
And I am not alone
When sadness crashes like an ocean
When fear is deeper than the sea
When I am swallowed by the darkness
Will you come and anchor me?
(When sadness crashes like an ocean)
When fear is deeper than the sea
(Deeper than the sea)
When I am swallowed by the darkness
Will you come and anchor me?
