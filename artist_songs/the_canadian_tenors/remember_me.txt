Remember, I will still be here 
As long as you hold me 
In your memory. 

Remember, when your dreams have ended 
Time can be transcended 
Just remember me

I am the one star that keeps burning so brightly 
It is the last light to fade into the rising Sun

I'm with you whenever you tell my story 
For all of I've done 

Remember, I will still be here as long as you hold me in your memory
Remember me

I am the warm voice in the cold wind that whispers 

And if you listen you will hear me come across the sky 

As long as I still can reach out and touch you 
Then I will never die 

Remember, I'll never leave you 
If you will only remember me 

Remember, I will still be here 
As long as you hold me 
In your memory
Remember, when your dream have ended
Time can be transcended
I live forever
Remember me
