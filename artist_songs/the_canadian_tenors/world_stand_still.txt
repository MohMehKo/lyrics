Life has a temple we never have time for
Feels like we're all missing out
No time for the beauty that always surrounds me
Walking with my head hanging down

I wouldn't have believed it
Cause I never used to see it
You give this life meaning around me
When you make the world stand still
You make the world stand still
I keep spinning around until you slow me down
You make me real, when you make the world stand still

Just like the wind blows and turning in circles
When will my feet touch the ground
Lost in a race, where no one's a winner
To finally turn me around

I wouldn't have believed it
Cause I never used to see it
You give this life meaning around me
When you make the world stand still
You make the world stand still
I keep spinning around until you slow me down
You make me real, when you make the world stand still

I'm running, my eyes closed, I'm running
I try to keep up with all those around me
I find that I'm rushing, I can't see
All of the beautiful things until you make the world stand still
You make me see and feel
I keep spinning around until you slow me down
You make me real
When you make the world stand still

I'm running, my eyes closed, I'm running
I try to keep up with all those around me
I find that I'm rushing, I can't see
All of the beautiful things until you make the world stand still

With you the world stands still
