In this world, It’s hard to tell the shadows from the light
What is real can find a way to hide behind the lies
Don’t be fooled or ruled by voices all around you
'Cause your road will always be revealed

If you lead, lead with your heart, 
It’s the one thing you can trust, to always come from love
And it will shine, right through the dark
Like a northern star to show you what is true
You’ll never lose, if only you
Will lead with your heart.

You have been, the truest friend that anyone could have.	
And the love you always give I want you to get back.	
You've been knocked down, and found, that everyone is what they show you.	
What is true will always be revealed.	

If you lead, lead with your heart, 
It’s the one thing you can trust, to always come from love
And it will shine, right through the dark
Like a northern star to show you what is true
You’ll never lose, if only you
Will lead with your heart.

It takes the beautiful unknown, that somehow makes you feel	
You’re home again, finally home again
And there’s no longer any doubt what the mystery's about for you
Or What should you do?
Lead, lead with your heart
It’s the one thing you can trust
To always come from love

Lead, lead with your heart, (Lead with your heart)
It’s the one thing you can trust, to always come from love
And it will shine, right through the dark
Like a northern star to show you what is true
You will never lose, (you’ll never lose) if only you (if only you) 
Will lead with your heart.
