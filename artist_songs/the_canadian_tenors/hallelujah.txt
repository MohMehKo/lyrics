I've heard that there was a secret chord
That David played and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do ya?
It goes like this the 4th, the 5th, minor fall the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moon light overthrew ya
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne, she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Baby, I've been here before
I know this room and I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew ya
Seen your flag on the marble arch
And love is not a victory march
Its cold and it's a broken, Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Did my best, it wasn't much
Couldn't feel so I tried to touch
I told the truth I didn't come to fool ya
Even though it all went wrong
Stand before the Lord of song
With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
