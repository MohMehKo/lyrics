When I am less than I should be
And I just can't face the day
When darkness falls around me
And I just can't find my way
When my eyes don't clearly see
And I stumble through it all
You I lean upon, you keep me strong
And you raise me when I fall

You are there when I most need you
You are there so constantly
You come shining through
You always do
You are always there for me

When life brings me to my knees
When my back's against the wall
You are standing there right with me
Just to keep me standing tall
Though a burden I may be
You don't weary, you don't rest
You are reaching out to carry me,
And I know I'm heaven blessed.

You are there when I most need you
You are there so constantly
You come shining through 
You always do
You are always there for me

You are there when I most need you 
You are there so constantly 
You come shining through 
You always do 
You are always there for me

You are there when I most need you (you are there)
You are there so constantly (so constantly)
You come shining through 
You always do 
You are always there for me

For me
