Walkin' by myself to places we knew
Talkin' to myself about you
what a lonesome conversation
I keep asking things and get no answer

Sitting by myself with nothing to do
Talkin' to myself about you
And while I'm listening for
Your knock on the door
And dreaming that you'll soon walk through
I'll keep talking to myself about you

Sitting by myself with nothing to do
Talkin' to myself about you
And while I'm listening for
Your knock on the door
And dreaming that you'll soon walk through
I'll keep talking to myself, talkin' 'bout you
