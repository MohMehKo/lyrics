Sound of rain on the window pane,
Pick some mighty sweet and soft refrain,
But I never heard a sound as sweet
As the tippity-tippity-tap of happy feet!

Mockin'bird never says a word,
But his pretty music must be heard!
Well, there is music with a beat
Of the tippity-tippity-tap of happy feet!

Honey, when we're dancin',
It's so divine!
Kinda we're much closer,
Closer than a quarter to nine!

Love that band on the Dixieland,
Gotta rhythm makes you clap your hands!
But there is a rhythm, I repeat,
Like the tippity-tippity-tap of happy feet!

Hey look at me ma, I'm dancin',
It's so divine!
Kinda we're much closer,
Closer than a quarter to nine!

Love that band on the Dixieland,
Gotta rhythm makes you clap your hands!
But there is a rhythm, I repeat,
Like the tippity-tippity-tap of happy feet!

Love that band on the Dixieland,
Gotta rhythm makes you clap your hands!
But there is a rhythm, I repeat,
Like the tippity-tippity-tap of happy feet!

Let go, watch those happy feet!
Crazy 'bout those tappy feet!
Come on, join us, listen to
The rhythm, it's the rhythm, I repeat
The rhythm of happy feet!
