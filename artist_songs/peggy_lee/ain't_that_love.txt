Now, baby when you sigh
(When you sigh)
I wanna sigh with you
When you cry
(When you cry)
I wanna cry some, too

Now, ain't that love
(Ain't that love)
Oh, ain't that love that I feel
(That I feel)
In my heart for you

When your friends
(When your friends)
Turn their back on you
I'll be here
(I'll be here)
Just to see you through

Now, ain't that love
(Ain't that love)
Ain't that love
(Ain't that love)
Ain't that love, oh now
Ain't that love
That I feel in my heart for you

Now when you walk
(When you walk)
I wanna walk with you
When you talk
(When you talk)
Wanna talk some, too

Now, ain't that love
(Ain't that love)
Oh, ain't that love that I feel
(That I feel)
In my heart for you

If you ever
(If you ever)
Ever need a friend
I'll be with you
(Be with you)
Yes, until the end

Now, ain't that love
(Ain't that love)
Ain't that love
(Ain't that love)
Don't you know, baby don't you know, I
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Ain't that love, baby that I feel
In my heart for you

Baby, won't you let me hold your hand
I want to squeeze you as tight as I can
Baby, don't you need my by your side
To protect you and be your guide
Baby, I'm so in love with you
I'd do anything you tell me to

Now, ain't that love
(Ain't that love)
Ain't that love
(Ain't that love)
C'mon now, ain't that love, now
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Ain't that love, baby that I feel
In my heart for you
Oh, that I feel in my heart for you
Oh, that I feel in my heart for you
Oh, that I feel in my heart for you
Oh!
