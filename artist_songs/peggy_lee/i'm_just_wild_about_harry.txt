I'm just wild about Harry
And Harry's wild about me
The heavenly caresses of his kisses
Fills me with ecstasy
He's as sweet as chocolate candy
And just like honey from a bee
Oh I'm just wild about Harry
And he's just wild about
Cannot do without
He is from the south
Can't you hear me shout
Talking with my mouth
Could you ever doubt
He's just wild about me
