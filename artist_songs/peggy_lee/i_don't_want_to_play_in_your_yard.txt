I don't want to play in your yard
I don't like you anymore
You'll be sorry when you see me
Sliding down our cellar door

You can't holler down our rain barrel
You can't climb our apple tree
I don't wanna play in your yard
If you can't be good to me

You can't holler down our rain barrel
You can't climb our apple tree
I don't wanna play in your yard
If you can't be good to me
