It's the bluest kind of blues, my baby sings
It's the newest kind of blues, my baby sings
It's the kind that makes you sigh
It's the kind that makes you cry
Doing something to my poor heart
Like a soft lullaby

It's the bluest kind of blues, my baby sings
It's the truest kind of blues, my baby brings
Always on my mind, awake or a-sleeping
It's the bluest kind of blues, my baby sings

Always on my mind, awake or a-sleeping
It's the bluest kind of blues my baby sings
