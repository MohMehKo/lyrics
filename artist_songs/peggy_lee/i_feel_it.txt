I Feel It, you know I do, love
I have never felt such true love
Violins keep comin' through, love
Dee dee, en dee dee, en dee, en dee dee

I Feel It when you're around, love
And my heart begins to pound, love
Then I hear the trumpets sound, love
Ba bup, pada bup, pada um pada

Right from the beginning
I could hear the melody, so
Right from the beginning
Like a hit song's got to be

I Feel It, can't keep from singing
Of the joy your love is bringing
All the bells, the bell's are ringing
Bong, bong pedong, bong abong, adong dong

Ba bup, pada bup, pada um pada

Right from the beginning
We were making harmony so
Right from the beginning
Growing like a symphony

A violin's, trumpet's playing
Now, the whole darn band is saying
Love, oh, it's love, yes it's love, really love

I Feel It, you know I do, love
I Feel It, I Feel It's true love
I Feel It, you're comin' through, love
I Feel It, I Feel It, I Feel It, I Feel It
