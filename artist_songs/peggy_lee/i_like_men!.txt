Maybe he has sandy hair
Or maybe his eyes are brown or blue
Maybe he has a fault or two
But I like men

If he has a gentle way
Then maybe he'll make me feel so frail
Well, that's my favourite kind of male
I like men

I like the masculine, I like the mind
And I like any other kind that I can find
So the way that I feel, it's not hard to decide
I'll take Southern hospitality or Northern pride

Maybe he's a millionaire
Or maybe he's poor, I just don't care
Why, he can even lose his hair
'Cause I like men

So the way that I feel, it's not hard to decide
I'll take Southern hospitality or Northern pride

Maybe he's a millionaire
Or maybe he's poor, I just don't care
Why, he can even lose his hair
'Cause I like men

They can be big, they can be small
They can be short, they can be tall
But bless 'em, bless 'em all
I like men
I like men
Yes, bless 'em, bless 'em all
I like men
