Why am I
Just as happy as a child
Why am I
Like a racehorse running wild
Why am I
In a state of ecstasy
The reason is 'cause something's happened to me

I'm in love again, and the spring is comin'
I'm in love again, hear my heart strings strummin'
I'm in love again, and the hymn I'm hummin'
Is the "Huddle Up, Cuddle Up Blues"

I'm in love again, and I can't rise above it
I'm in love again, and I love, love, love it
I'm in love again, and I'm darn glad of it
Good news

Someone sad had the awful luck to meet
Someone bad, but the kind of bad that's sweet
No one knows what a glimpse of paradise
Someone who's naughty showed to someone who's nice

I'm in love again, and with glee I bubble
I'm in love again, and the fun's just double
I'm in love again, if I got in trouble
I'll be cursin' one person I know

I'm in love again, I'm a lovebird sigin'
I'm in love again, I'm the spring lamb springin'
I'm in love again, weddin' bells are ringin'
Let's go
