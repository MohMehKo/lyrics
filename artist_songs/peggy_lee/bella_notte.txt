Oh this is the night
It's a beautiful night
And we call it bella notte
Look at the skies
They have stars in their eyes
On this lovely bella notte
Side by side with your loved one
You will find the enchantment here
The night will weave its magic spell
When the one you love is near, oh
This is the night
And the heavens all rise
On this lovely bella notte

This is the night
It's a beautiful night
And we call it bella notte
Look at the skies
They have stars in their eyes
On this lovely bella notte
Side by side with your loved one
You will find the enchantment here
The night will weave its magic spell
When the one you love is near, oh
This is the night
And the heavens all rise
On this lovely bella notte
