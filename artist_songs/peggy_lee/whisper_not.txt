Sing low, sing clear
Sing low, sing clear
Sweet words in my ear
Not a whisper of despair
But love's own prayer

Sing on until
You bring back a thrill
Of a sentimental tune
That died too soon

Our harmony was lost
But you forgave, I forgot
Whisper not of quarrels past
You know we've had our last

So now we'll be
On key constantly
Love will whisper
Whisper on eternally

Our harmony was lost
But you forgave, I forgot
Whisper not of quarrels past
You know we've had our last

So now we'll be
On key constantly
Love will whisper
Whisper on eternally, eternally
