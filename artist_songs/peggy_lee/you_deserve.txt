You deserve sixteen lackeys
Waitin' on your night and day
And thirty two hands wavin' fans
Just to brush the flies away

You deserve Persian maidens
Just to stand and peel your grapes
And dressed in pearls harem girls
In half a dozen sizes and shapes

If I had the riches of Sumatra
I will give you all I own
You deserve a queen like Cleopatra
To come along and share your throne
But you can that
I will love you
Love you to the end degree
And what you deserve just can't compare
With the love gonna geetin' from me

You deserve[?] barges
Just to float you down the Nile
And when you blue you will have a few jesters
Just to make you smile

If I had the riches of Sumatra
I will give you all I own
You deserve a queen like Cleopatra
To come along and share your throne
But you can that
I will love you
Love you to the end degree
And what you deserve just can't compare
With the love gonna gettin' from me

Baby, gonna get from me
Baby, gonna get from me

You deserve sixteen lackeys
Waiting' on you night and day
And thirty two hands waving' fans
Just to brush the flies away

You deserve Persian maidens
Just to stand and peel your grapes
And dressed in pearls harem girls
In half a dozen sizes and shapes

If I had the riches of Sumatra
I would give you all I own
You deserve a queen like Cleopatra
To come along and share your throne

But you can that
I will love you
Love you to the end degree
And what you deserve just can't compare
With the love you gonna get from me

You deserve n good barges
Just to float you down the Nile
And when you blue you will have a few jesters
Just to make you smile

If I had the riches of Sumatra
I would give you all I own
You deserve a queen like Cleopatra
To come along and share your throne

But you can that
I will love you
Love you to the end degree
And what you deserve just can't compare
With the love you gonna get from me

Baby, gonna get from me
Baby, gonna get from me
