Those eyes that smile
My type, my style

Be wise, be smart
Behave, my heart
Don't upset your cart
When he's so close

Be soft, be sweet
But be discreet
Don't go off your feet
He's so close for comfort

Too close, too close for comfort
Please, not again
Too close, too close to know
Just when to say, "When"

Be firm, be fair
Be sure, beware
On your guard, take care
While there's such temptation

One thing leads to another
Too late to run for cover
He's much too close for comfort now

Be wise, be smart
Take care, beware
Be soft, be sweet
Be nice, discreet

Be calm, be cool
Don't be a fool
You'll learn in school
Oh, it's such temptation

One thing leads to another
Too late to run for cover
He's much too close for comfort now
