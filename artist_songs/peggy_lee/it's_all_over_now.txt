I used to love to hold you when the lights were down low 
But it's all over now 
You used to whisper little things to set me aglow 
But it's all over now

I listened to you tell me little white lies 
Never thought you meant to deceive 
Whoever would have doubted those innocent eyes 
And all the little kisses that you made me believe

Remember how I planned a little home by a stream 
Where we'd spend every day 
You must have thought me crazy when I painted that dream 
'Cause you threw it away

I kinda wish that things would be different 
Have a happy ending somehow 
But I guess you only took me for a ride in the dark 
And it's all over now

Remember how I planned a little home by a stream 
Where we'd spend every day 
You must have thought me crazy when I painted that dream 
'Cause you threw it away

I kinda wish that things would be different 
Have a happy ending somehow 
But I guess you only took me for a ride in the dark 
And it's all 
It's all over now
