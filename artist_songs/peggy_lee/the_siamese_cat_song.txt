We are Siamese if you please
We are Siamese if you don't please
We are former residents of Siam
There are no finer cat than I am

Do you see what I see with my eyes?
People have been baking up some pies
Peeping jumping up upon their window
Though delicious spice we could get into

Who is that who is living in that wire house
It must be a bird because it's not a mouse
If we're sneakin' up upon it carefully
There will be some bird for you and some for me

Do you seeing that thing swimming round and round?
Maybe we could reaching in and make it drown
If we're sneakin' up upon it carefully
There will be some fish for you and some for me
