Aww, she didn't bat an eye
As I packed my bags to leave
I thought she would start to cry
Or sit around my room and grieve

But y'all, the girl, she fooled me this time
She acted like I was the last thing on her mind
I would like to start all over again
Baby, can I change my mind

I just wanna change my mind
Baby, let me change my mind
As I took those steps
Toward that open door

Knowing all the time
Oh, Lord, I just didn't wanna go
But she didn't give me no sign
Nothing that would make me change my mind

I would like to start all over again
Baby, can I change my mind
Please, please, please, baby
I just wanna change my mind

Oh, I played my games
Many times before
But peoples, let me tell y'all
Oh, I never reached the door

But ooh, the winds howl tonight
I keep lookin' back but my baby's nowhere in sight
I would like to start all over again
Baby, can I change my mind

Please, please, please, baby
Baby, let me change my mind...
