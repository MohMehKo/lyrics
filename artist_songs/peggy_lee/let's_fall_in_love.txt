Let's fall in love
Why shouldn't we fall in love?
Our hearts are made of it
Let's take a chance
Why be afraid of it
Let's close our eyes and make our own paradise
Little we know of it, still we can try
To make a go of it

We might have been meant for each other
To be or not to be
Let our hearts discover

Let's fall in love
Why shouldn't we fall in love
Now is the time for it, while we are young
Let's fall in love

Let's fall in love
Why shouldn't we fall in love?
Our hearts are made of it
Let's take a chance
Why be afraid of it
Let's close our eyes and make our own paradise
Little we know of it, still we can try
To make a go of it

We know [?]
To be or not to be
Let our hearts discover

Let's fall in love
Why shouldn't we fall in love?
This is a night for it, now is the time
Let's fall in love
