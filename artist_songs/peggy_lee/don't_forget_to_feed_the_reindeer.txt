Have you been a good little angel
Santa Claus soon will be on his way
And he'll bring his eight little reindeer
Pulling the toys in his great big sleigh

So don't forget to feed the reindeer
Angels are friends of the reindeer, too
And if you are a good little angel
Santa Claus will be good to you

Hear that jingle off in the distance
What is that happy sound I hear
Could it be the spirit of Christmas
Santa Claus and his tiny reindeer

Oh, don't forget to feed the reindeer
Angels are friends of the reindeer, too
And if you are a good little angel
Santa Claus will be good to you

Here they come now, up on the rooftop
Santa Claus' sled and his reindeer too
Hear those bells now, oh, how they jingle
And he has toys in his bag for you

Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, and Vixen,
Pulling that sleigh, oh, I do believe
Cupid, Comet, Dunder, and Blixhem
Always on time for Christmas Eve

Let's not forget to feed the reindeer
Angels are friends of the reindeer, too
And if you've been a good little angel
Santa Claus will be good to you
