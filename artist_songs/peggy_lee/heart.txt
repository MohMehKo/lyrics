You gotta have heart
All you really need is heart
When the odds are saying you'll never win
That's when the grin should start

You gotta have hope
Mustn't sit around and mope
Nothing's half as bad as it may appear
Wait'll next year and hope

When your luck is battin' zero
Get your chin up off the floor
Mister, you can be a hero
You can open any door
There's nothing to it
But to do it

You've gotta have heart
Miles and miles and miles of heart
Oh, it's fine to be a genius, of course
But keep that old horse before the cart
First, you gotta have heart

We're so happy that we're hummin'
That's the hearty thing to do
'Cause we know our ship will come in
So it's ten years overdue

So what the heck's the use of cryin'
Why should we curse
Things can only get better
`Cause they can't get worse

And to add to it
We've got heart
We've got heart
We've got heart

We've got heart
All you really need is heart
When the odds are sayin' you'll never win
That's when the grin should start

We're so happy that we're laughin'
That's the hearty thing to do
So we ain't been autographin'
'Cept to sign an I.O.U.

We've got heart
Miles 'n miles n' miles of heart
Oh, it's fine to be a genius of course
But keep that old horse before the cart

Who minds those pop bottles flyin'?
The hisses and the boos
The team has been consistent
Yeah, we always lose

But we're laughin'
'Cause we've got heart
We've got heart
We've got heart
