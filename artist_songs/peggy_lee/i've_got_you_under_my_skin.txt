I've got you under my skin
I've got you deep in the heart of me
So deep in my heart
You're really a part of me

I've got you under my skin
I've tried so not to give in
I said to myself, "This affair never will go so well"
But why should I try to resist when, darling, I know so well
I've got you under my skin

I'd sacrifice anything come what may
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
And repeats in my ear

"Don't you know, little fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality"
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
'Cause I've got you under my skin

I'd sacrifice anything come what may
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of the warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats in my ear

"Don't you know, little fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality"
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
'Cause I've got you, yes, I've got you
Ooh, I've got you under my skin
