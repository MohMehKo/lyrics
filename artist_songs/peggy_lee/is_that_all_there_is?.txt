I remember when I was a little girl
Our house caught on fire
I'll never forget the look on my father's face
As he gathered me up in his arms and
Raced through the burning building out to the pavement
And I stood there shivering in my pajamas and
Watched the whole world go up in flames
And when it was all over, I said to myself
“Is that all there is to a fire”

Is that all there is
Is that all there is
If that's all there is, my friends
Then let's keep dancing
Let's break out the booze and have a ball
If that's all there is

And when I was twelve years old
My daddy took me to a circus
“The Greatest Show on Earth”
There were clowns and elephants and dancing bears
And a beautiful lady in pink tights flew high above our heads
And as I sat there watching
I had the feeling that something was missing
I don't know what
But when it was all over, I said to myself
“Is that all there is to a circus”

Is that all there is
Is that all there is
If that's all there is, my friends
Then let's keep dancing
Let's break out the booze and have a ball
If that's all there is

And then I fell in love
With the most wonderful boy in the world
We'd take long walks down by the river
Or just sit for hours gazing into each other's eyes
We were so very much in love
And then one day, he went away
And I thought I'd die, but I didn't
And when I didn't, I said to myself
“Is that all there is to love”

Is that all there is
Is that all there is
If that's all there is, my friends
Then let's keep

I know what you must be saying to yourselves
“If that's the way she feels about it
Why doesn't she just end it all”
Oh, no, not me
I'm in no hurry for that final disappointment
Cause I know just as well as I'm standing here talking to you
That when that final moment comes and I'm breathing my last breath
I'll be saying to myself

Is that all there is
Is that all there is
If that's all there is, my friends
Then let's keep dancing
Let's break out the booze and have a ball
If that's all there is
