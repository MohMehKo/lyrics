I'll dance at your wedding, I'll dance at your wedding,
I'll dance at your wedding, I'll have a wonderful time.
I'll drink to your father, I'll drink to your mother,
Then I'll have another, for Old Lang Syne.
I'll kiss all the ladies, the young and old, and then.
I'll have myself another drink, and kiss them all again.
I'll dance at your wedding, I won't miss that wedding,
I'll dance at your wedding, am I gonna shine
At your wedding and mine.

I'll dance at your wedding, I'll dance at your wedding,
I'll dance at your wedding, I'll have a wonderful time.
I'll drink to your father, I'll drink to your mother,
Then I'll have another, for Old Lang Syne.
I'll kiss all the ladies, the young and old, and then.
I'll have myself another drink, and kiss them all again.
I'll dance at your wedding, I won't miss that wedding,
I'll dance at your wedding, am I gonna shine
At your wedding and mine.
