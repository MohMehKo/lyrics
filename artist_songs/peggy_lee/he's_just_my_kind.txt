Why he left me I don't know,
I loved him more than I could show;
I've always had him on my mind,
He's just my kind!

Didn't even say goodbye,
He never liked to see me cry,
Afraid my tears might change his mind,
He's just my kind!

Mine was an ordinary man,
Not the type you'd notice passin' by.
When he came along my life began,
And I'll love him till the day I die.

Take him back? Well I should say!
I'd even meet him on the way.
Though he's not worth it I don't mind,
He's just my kind!

Take him back? Well I should say!
I'd even meet him on the way.
Though he's not worth it I don't mind,
He's just my kind, just my kind!
