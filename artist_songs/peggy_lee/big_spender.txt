The minute you walked in the joint
I could see you were a man of distinction,
A real big spender

Good lookin', so refined
Say, wouldn't you like to know
what's goin' on in my mind?

Well let me get right to the point:
I don't pop my cork for every guy I see
Hey Big Spender! Spend a little time with me.

Wouldn't you like to have fun, fun, fun?
We could have a few laughs, laughs
I could show you... good time!
Would you like to have a... good time?
