I wanna be around, to pick up the pieces
When somebody breaks your heart
Some, somebody twice as smart as I

A somebody who, will swear to be true
As you use to do with me
Who'll leave you to learn that misery loves company
Wait and see

I wanna be around to see how she does it
When she breaks your heart to bits
Let's see how the puzzle fits so fine

And that's when I'll discover that revenge is sweet
As I sit there applauding from a front row seat

When somebody breaks you heart
Like you, like you broke mine
