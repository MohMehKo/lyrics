Sleigh bells ring, are you listenin'?
In the lane, snow is glistenin'
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He's singin' a song as we go along
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

In the meadow, we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a Santa clown
We'll have lots of fun with Mister Snowman
Till the other kiddies knock him down

When it snows, ain't it thrillin'?
Though your nose gets a chillin'
We'll frolic and play the Eskimo way
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

In the meadow, we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a Santa clown
We'll have lots of fun with Mister Snowman
Until the other kiddies knock him down

Later on we'll conspire as we dream by the fire
To face unafraid the plans that we've made
Walkin' in a winter wonderland
Walkin' and we were talkin'
While we were walkin' in a winter wonderland
