When in Spain for reasons I don't explain
I remain enjoying a brew
Don't deplore my fondness for fundador
You know how a fundador can lead to a few

And baby when in Rome
I do as the Romans do
If per chance I'm saying farewell to France
And romance drops in from the blue

Cherchez l'amour
I beg of you please endure
My taking a brief detour with somebody new
It's just that when in Rome

I do as the Romans do
And though from Italy I lied to you prettily
Oh don't think of me bitterly
But know that I'm true

Except now and then in Rome,
I get that old yearn in Rome
And naturally when in Rome
I do as the Romans do

You know what I mean?
If I write happily
Best wishes from Napoli
Don't cable me snappily

To tell me we're through
'Cause I'm once again in Rome
In somebody's den in Rome
Well honey, but when in Rome

I do as the Romans do
So just disregard the signs and the omens
When in Rome I do as the Romans do...
