Talk to me baby tell me lies
Tell me lies as sweet as apple pies
And if your lips have never told a fib
You might ad lib with your eyes

Ooh, tell me I'm marvelous, exaggerate
Prevaricate if you must just

Talk to me baby soft and low
And then if you decide it's really so
Swear you'll be mine forever otherwise
Just talk to me and tell me lies

Say that we're helpless in the hands of fate
Prevaricate if you must just

Talk to me baby soft and low
And then if you decide it's really so
Then swear you'll be mine forever otherwise
Ah, just talk to me and tell me lies, lies, lies, lies

A great big beautiful wonderful
Beautiful lies, lies, lies, lies
Great big, great big beautiful lies
