He needs me
He doesn't know it
But he needs me

And so no matter
Where he goes
And though he doesn't care
He knows, I'm there

He needs me
I ought to leave him
But he needs me

I guess, it isn't very bright
Just to tag along
But right or wrong
I'm here, I'm his

And I'll be
A friend or a lover
Because my
One ambition is

To wake him
And make him discover
He needs me

I've got to follow
Where he leads me
Or else he'll never know
That I need him
Just as he needs me
