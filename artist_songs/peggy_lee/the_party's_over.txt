I'm in love with a man, but the girl that he loves isn't me.
I'll never see him again, and that's how it has to be.
The party's over, it's time to call it a day,
They've burst your pretty balloon and taken the moon away.
It's time to wind up the masquerade,
Just make you mind up, the piper must be paid.
The party's over, the candles flicker and dim,
You danced and dreamed through the night,
It seemed to be right, just being with him.
Now, you must wake up, all dreams must end,
Take off your make-up, the party's over, it's over, my friend.
