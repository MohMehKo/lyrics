You don't no how much I love you
You don't no how much I care
You don't know much I need you
Without you  life I can't bear

You don't know baby, you don't know baby,
You don't know baby, no you don't,
You don't know baby, no you don't,
No you can't know how I feel

The flame that you left is still burning
Burning down deep in my soul
I think of all your loving and kissing
It's you I wanna hold

You don't know baby, you don't know baby,
You don't know baby, no you don't,
You don't know baby, no you don't,
No you can't know how I feel

All of my friends call me crazy 
For actin' the way that I do
But I just can't help myself
'Cause I'm still in love with you

You don't know baby, you don't know baby,
You don't know baby, no you don't,
You don't know baby, no you don't,
No you can't know how I feel
You don't know baby, no you don't,
No you can't know how I feel
