My wish for you, sweet happy life
May all the days of the year that you live be laughing days
With all my heart, sweet happy life
And may the night times that follow the days be dancing nights

Stars for your smile
Moons for your hair
And someone's wonderful love
For your loving heart to share

My wish for you, sweet happy life
May all your sorrows be gone and your heart begin to sing
And if a wish can make it be
I wish you spend everyday of your happy life with me

Stars for your smile
Moons for your hair
And someone's wonderful love
For your loving heart to share

My wish for you, sweet happy life
May all your sorrows be gone and your heart begin to sing
And if a wish can make it be
I wish you spend everyday of your happy life with me
