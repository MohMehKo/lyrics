Things are swingin', birds are singin'
And just what do you think those bells are doin' but ringin'?
'Cause they have to ring to make this whole thing rhyme
And you know that things are swingin' all the time

If the news is what the blues is
Then we'd better just practice up on our ones and twoses
'Cause where love is, you can always find a rhyme
And where love is, things are swingin' all the time

It's as simple as, as a dimple
Just remember that
You can find some brand new swingin' ideas
Underneath your hat

So keep countin', keep it mountin'
Till you think it must be Ponce de Leon's fountain
Yes, the fountain of youth, for those who know the score
Means that things will keep on swingin' for evermore

Like an ocean that's in motion
Like the wind that's blowin' the boat right in to shore
It's the livin'est thing to live and breathe
And keep on laughin' up your sleeve

Things are swingin' and they'll keep swingin' some more
Yes, things are swingin' and they'll keep swingin' some more
Let's keep on swingin' and swing right out the door
