When you got someone who loves you madly,
It keeps you young
And the same sweet someone wants you badly
It keeps you young
And it makes no difference if you're 17 or if you're 71
Love has the power to keep you green, so age doesn't matter none, it's fun

When you got someone who calls you baby,
It keeps you young
And he says I'm yours, and I don't mean maybe
It keeps you young
Well I have got that someone
That's how I know so well
Love keeps you young, can't you look at me and tell?

Oh, love keeps you young, can't you look at me and tell?
