I never thought I'd see the day
Someone like you would come my way
Romance is like a song they say
I hear the music now

Music of every lasting spring
Bluebirds on every bough
I never knew my heart could sing
I hear the music now

Here am I surrounded by a million violins
Then you stand before me and the symphony begins

I see you walking at my side
Ready to make the vows
Tell them to play, 'Here Comes The Bride'.
I hear the music now

I see you walking at my side
Ready to make the vows
Tell them to play, 'Here Comes The Bride'.
I hear the music now

I hear it, I hear it, I hear the music now.
