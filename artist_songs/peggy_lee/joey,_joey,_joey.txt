Joey, Joey, Joey
Joey, Joey, Joey, Joe

You've been too long
In one place
And it's time to go
Time to go

Joey, Joey, Joey
Joey, travel on

You've been too long
In one town
And the harvest time's
Come and gone

That's what the wind
Sings to you
When the bunk you've been bunkin' in
Gets to feelin' too soft and cozy

When the grub they've been cookin' you
Gets to tastin' too good
When you've seen all you want
All the ladies in the neighborhood

I sing Joey
Joey, Joey
Joey, Joey, Joe

You've been too long
In one place
And it's time to go
Time to go

Joey, Joey, Joe
