Bewitched bewitched
You've got me in your spell
Bewitched bewitched
You know your craft so well
Before I knew what you were doing
I looked in your eyes
That brand of woo that you've been brewing
Took me by surprise
Bewitched bewitched
One thing is for sure
That stuff you pitch
Just hasn't got a cure
My heart was under lock and key
Somehow it got unhitched
I never thought my heart could be had
But now I'm caught and I'm kinda glad to be
