I know a little bit about a lot o' things,
But I don't know enough about you.
Just when I think you're mine,
You try a different line,
And baby, what can I do?

I read the latest news,
No buttons on my shoes,
But baby, I'm confused about you.
You get me in a spin,
Oh what a stew I'm in,
'Cause I don't know enough about you.

Jack of all trades, master of none,
And isn't it a shame,
I'm so sure that you'd be good for me,
If you'd only play my game!

You know I went to school,
And I'm nobody's fool,
That is to say until I met you!
I know a little bit about a lot o' things,
But I don't know enough about you.

I know a little bit about a lot o' things,
But I don't know enough about you.

I know a little bit about biology,
And a little more about psychology,
I'm a little gem in geology,
But I don't know enough about you.

I guess Id better get out the encyclopedia
And fresh up on from "shmer" to "shmoo", mmmm,
'Cause I don't know enough about you.
