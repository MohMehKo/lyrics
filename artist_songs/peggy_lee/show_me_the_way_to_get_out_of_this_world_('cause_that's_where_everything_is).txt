Show me the way to get out of this world
'Cause that's where everything is
If everything is goin', I don't wanna stay here
Who wants to stick around and watch the world disappear

Now I missed a thing for two away down the line
I'd go back and get 'em, but I haven't the time
So show me the way to get out of this world
'Cause that's where everything is

I asked a fellah where to go to eat
He said there's a great place right down the street
Just turn to your left and carry on
It's out of this world, in fact it's gone

So show me the way to get out of this world
'Cause that's where everything is

Show me the way to get out of this world
'Cause that's where everything is
If everything is goin', I don't wanna stay here
Who wants to stick around and watch the world disappear

If I go, I'd like to take a few things along
But anything's that's any good they tell me is 'Gone!'
So show me the way to get out of this world
'Cause that's where everything is

I got some money in my pocket
To buy a ticket on a rocket
So show me the way to get out of this world
'Cause that's where everything is (It's gone)
'Cause that's where everything is (It ain't here)
'Cause that's where everything is
