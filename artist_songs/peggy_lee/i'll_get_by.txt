I'll get by
As long as I have you
Though there be rain
And darkness too
I'll not complain
I will see it through

Poverty
May come to me, that's true
But what care I
Or I'll get by
As long as I have you.

Poverty
May come to me, that's true
But what care I
Or I'll get by
As long as I have you

But what care I
Say, I'll get by
As long as I have you.
