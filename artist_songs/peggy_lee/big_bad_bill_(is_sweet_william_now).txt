In the town of Louisville they got a man they call Big Bad Bill
I wants to tell ya, he sure was tough tough, and he certainly did
Strut his stuff
He had folks all scared to death, when he walked by they all held
Their breath
He was a fighting man, sure enough

Now Bill got himself a wife, and he leads a different life

Big Bad Bill is Sweet William now
Married life done changed him some how
He's the man the town used to fear
Now they all call him sweet pappa Willie dear
Stronger than Samson I declare
'Til the brown skinned woman
Bobbed his hair

Big Bad Bill don't fight any more (No, he don't)
Doing the dishes
Mopping up that floor (Yes, he is)
Well he used to go out drinking
Looking for a fight
Now he gotta see that woman
Everynight
Big Bad Bill is Sweet William now

Ah, play it boys
I likes that jazz

Big Bad Bill don't fight any more (No, he don't)
Doing the dishes
Mopping up that floor (Yes, he is)
Well he used to go out drinking
Looking for a fight
Now he gotta see that woman
Everynight
Big Bad Bill is Sweet William now (Doing the dishes)
Big Bad Bill is Sweet William now (Mop up the floor)
Big Bad Bill is Sweet William now
