Bali Ha'i may call you, any night, any day
In your heart, you'll hear it call you 
Come away, come away

Bali Ha'i will whisper on the wind of the sea
Here am I your special island
Come to me, come to me

Your own special hopes, your own special dreams
Bloom on the hillside and shine in the streams

If you try, you'll find me
Where the sky meets the sea
Here am I your special island
Come to me, come to me

Bali Ha'i, Bali Ha'i, Bali Ha'i

Someday you'll see me floating in the sunshine
My head sticking out from a low-lying cloud
You hear me call you, singing through the sunshine
Sweet and clear as can be
Come to me, here I am, come to me
Bali Ha'i, Bali Ha'i
