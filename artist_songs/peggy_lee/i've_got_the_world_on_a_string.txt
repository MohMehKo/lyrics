I've got the world on a string
Sitting on a rainbow.
Got the string around my finger.
What a world! What a life! I'm in love

I've got a song that I sing.
I can make the rain go
Anytime I move my finger.
Lucky me, can't you see I'm in love?

Life's a beautiful thing
As long as I hold the string.
I'd be a silly so-and-so
If I should ever let go.

I've got the world on a string
Sitting on a rainbow.
Got the string around my finger.
What a world! What a life! I'm in love.
