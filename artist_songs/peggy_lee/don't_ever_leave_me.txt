I was created for one man alone
It wasn't easy to find
Now that I found him, I wonder just how
I could have lived right up to now

Now that I am something completed by you
I am no one, just part of two

Don't ever leave me, now that you're here
Here is where you belong
Ev'rything seems so right when you're near
When you're away it's all wrong

I'm so dependent, when I need comfort
I always run to you
Don't ever leave me, 'cause if you do
I'll have no one to run to

Don't ever leave me alone
