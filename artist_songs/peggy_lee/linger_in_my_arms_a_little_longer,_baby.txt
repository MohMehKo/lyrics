Linger in my arms 
A little longer, baby
Hold me tight

While my love for you 
Is growing stronger, baby
It ain't right to say goodnight

Though it may be getting 
Past your dreamtime, baby
Don't think twice

Just linger in my arms 
A little longer, baby
'Cause it's so nice
It's oh so nice

Linger in my arms 
A little longer, baby
Hold me tight

While my love for you 
Is growing stronger, baby
It ain't right to say goodnight

Though it may be getting 
Past your dreamtime, baby
Don't think twice

Linger, linger, baby
'Cause it's oh so nice
'Cause it's oh so nice
