That's what the Chins do it, Japs do it
Up in Lapland little Laps do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love

In Spain, the best upper sets do it
Lithuanians and Lats do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love

Electric eels I might add do it
Though it shocks em I know
Why ask if shads do it - waiter bring me "shad roe"

Some Argentines, without means, do it
People say in Boston even beans do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love

The Dutch in old Amsterdam do it
Not to mention the Fins
Folks in Siam do it - think of Siamese twins

The birds do it, bees do it
Even educated fleas do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love
