You're nobody till somebody loves you
You're nobody till somebody cares
You may be king, you may possess
The world and it's gold

But gold won't bring you happiness
When you're growing old
The world is still the same
You'll never change it

As sure as the stars shine above
You're nobody till somebody loves you
So find yourself somebody to love
You're nobody till somebody loves you
So find yourself somebody to love
