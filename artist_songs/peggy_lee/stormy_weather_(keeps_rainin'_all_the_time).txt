Don't know why
There's no sun up in the sky
Stormy weather
Since my man and I ain't together
Keeps raining all the time

Life is bare
Gloom and misery everywhere
Stormy weather
Just can't get my poorself together
I'm weary all the time
The time, so weary all the time

Since he went away
the blues walked in and met me
If he stays away
Old rocking chair will get me
All I do is pray
That the lord above will let me
Walk in the sun once more

Can't go on
Everything I had is gone
Stormy weather
Since my man and I ain't together
Keeps raining all the time
Keeps raining all the time

I can't go on
Everything I had is gone
Stormy weather
Since my man and I ain't together
Keeps raining all the time
Keeps raining all the time

Since my man and I, we ain't together
Keeps raining all the time
