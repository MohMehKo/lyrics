I love the way you're breaking my heart
It's terribly, terribly, terribly, terribly thrilling
I love the way you're breaking my heart

Although you're gonna ruin it
It's heaven while you're doin' it
I love the way I feel when we kiss
You're terribly, terribly, terribly irresistible

Sigh to me and lie to me
You really know how it's gonna hurt tomorrow
But it feels so good now

So darling, just keep playing your part
Take your time and really finish the things that you start
'Cause I love the way you're breaking my heart
