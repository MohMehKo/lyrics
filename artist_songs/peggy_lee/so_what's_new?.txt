So, tell me babe what's new and how's the scene with you?
Gee, it's good to see you, babe
Yeah, I missed you so, how, you'll never know
Gee, it's good to see you, babe

You walked in, lights went on all over my face
You lit up the place and you've been gone just too long, now

So, tell me babe what's new? You glad to see me too
Hey, my world is spinnin', now I know I'm winnin'
You stay home now, don't ever roam now
And I'll say baby, it's so good to see you

Gee, it's good to see you, babe
Gee, it's good to see you, babe

You walked in, lights went on all over my face
You lit up the place and you've been gone just too long, now

Tell me babe what's new? You glad to see me too
Hey, my world is spinnin', now I know I'm winnin'
You stay home now, don't ever roam now
And I'll say baby, it's so good to see you
