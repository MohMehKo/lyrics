It seem like happiness is just a thing called Joe
He's got a smile that makes the lilacs want to grow
He's got a way that makes the angels heave a sigh
When they see little Joe passin' by

Sometimes the cabin's gloomy and the cupboard's bare
But when he kisses me, it's Christmas everywhere
Troubles fly away and life is easy go
Does he love me good? That's all I need to know
Seems like happiness is just a thing called Joe

Does he love me good? That's all I need to know
Seems like happiness is just a thing called Joe

Little Joe, hmm hmm, little Joe, my Joe
