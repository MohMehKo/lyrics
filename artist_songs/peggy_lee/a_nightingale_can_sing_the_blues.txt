Got my feathers burned
Got my lesson learned
Guess that I was born to lose
Take it straight from me
Love is misery, listen while I sing the blues

Ain't it a shame
He had to go and grieve me
Some other dame
Has made him up to leave me
That's how it happens
A nightingale can sing the blues

I'll put it straight
He's got his self a new bird
Gave me the gate
And now I'm just a blue bird
That's how it happens
A nightingale can sing the blues

He can take me and forsake me
Just as quick as that
When there's someone new in town
But I'm bettin', he'll be frettin'
For his old job back
When his brand new lady love has let him down

You take my word
There ain't no use a-preachin'
I got a bird who's gonna get some teachin'

Then he'll discover
A nightingale can sing the blues
That's how it happens
A nightingale can sing the blues
