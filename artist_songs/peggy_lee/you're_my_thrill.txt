You're my thrill, you do something to me
You send chills right through me when I look at you
'Cause you're my thrill, you're my thrill
How my pulse increases, I just go to pieces
When I look at you 'cause you're my thrill

Mmm, nothing seems to matter
Mmm, here's my heart on a silver platter
Where's my will? Why this strange desire?
That keeps mounting higher when I look at you

I can't keep still, you're my thrill
Where's my will? Why this strange desire?
That keeps mounting higher when I look at you
I can't keep still, you're my thrill
