Do I hear a waltz?
Very odd but I hear a waltz
There isn't a band and I don't understand it at all
I can't hear a waltz
Oh my lord, there it goes again
Why is nobody dancing in the street?
Can't they hear the beat?
Magical, mystical, miracle
Can it be, is it true?
Things are impossibly lyrical
Is it me, no it's you
I do hear a waltz
I see you and I hear a waltz
It's what I've been waiting for all my life
To hear a waltz

Do I hear a waltz?
La-da-de-da-da
Such lovely Blue Danubey music
How can you be still?
I do hear a waltz
There it goes again
There's no dancing in the street
Can't they hear the beat?
Roses are dancing with peonies
Yes it's true, don't you see
Everything's suddenly Viennese
Can't be you, must be me
Do I hear a waltz?
I want more than to hear a waltz
I want you to share it, but oh my
Do I hear a waltz?
