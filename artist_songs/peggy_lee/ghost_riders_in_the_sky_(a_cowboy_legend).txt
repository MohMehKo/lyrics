(Ghost Riders in the Sky)

An old cow polk went ridin’ out one dark and windy day
Upon a ranch he rested as he went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of red eyed cows he saw
A plowin’ through the ragged sky and up the cloudy draw

(Yippee-I-Yay Yippee-I-Yay)
Ghost herd in the Sky

Their brands were still on fire and their hoofs were made of steel
Their horns were black and shiney and their hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
For he saw the riders coming hard and he heard their mournful cry

(Yippee-I-Yay Yippee-I-Yay)
Yippee-I-Yo, Yippee-I-Yay
Ghost Riders in the Sky

As the riders loped on by him, he heard one call his name
'If you want to save your soul from hell, you’re ridin’ on that range
then cowboy, change your ways today… or with us you’ll ride on
tryin’ to catch the devil’s herd across these endless sky'

(Yippee-I-Yay Yippee-I-Yay)
