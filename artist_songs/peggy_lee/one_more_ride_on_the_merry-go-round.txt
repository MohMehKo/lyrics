Look at the world I have conquered
I've won every spin of the wheel
I get everything I go after
They ask me how does it feel

I tell them that I'd trade the moon
For a string with an orange balloon
And the days when my only dream
Was a dish of vanilla ice cream

Give me one more chance at the midway
Let me laugh and be gay as a clown
Give me back the world I remember
One more ride on the merry go round

I do my shopping in Paris
My clothes are Balmain and Dior
I have money to buy friends and lovers
Well, isn't that what it's for?

But when I go to my bedroom
And stare at my hand painted sky
I think of a world far behind me
A world that my money can't buy

Give me one more chance at the midway
Let me dance with my feet off the ground
Give me back the world I remember
One more ride on the merry go round

One more ride on the merry go round
One more ride on the merry go round
One more ride on the merry go round
