You see, see, rider, you see what you have done?
You made me love you
Made me love you, now your man done come
You made me love you, now your man have come

Ain't no more potatoes, the frost have killed the vine
Well, the blues ain't nothin' but a good woman on your mind
The blues ain't nothin' but a good woman on your mind
The blues ain't nothin' but a good woman on your mind

You see, see, rider, you see what you done?
You done made me love you
You made me love you
I've told you, baby and your mama told you, too

"You're three times seven, you know what you wanna do,
three times seven, you know what you wanna do,
you're three times seven, you know what you wanna do"

If I had-a listened to my second mind,
Lord, I wouldn't -a been sittin' here and wringin' my hands and cryin'
I wouldn't been sittin' here, wringin' my hands and cryin'
I wouldn't been sittin' here, wringin' my hands and cryin'

You see, see, rider, you see what you have done?
You done made me love you
You made me love you
