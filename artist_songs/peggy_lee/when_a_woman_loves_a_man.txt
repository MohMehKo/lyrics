Maybe he's not much
Just another man
Doing what he can
But what does she care
When a woman loves a man

She'll just string along
All through thick and thin
Till his ship comes in
It's always that way
When a woman loves a man

She'll be the first one to praise him when he's goin' strong
The last one to blame him when every thing's wrong
It's such a one-sided game that they play
Ah, but women are funny that way

Tell her, she's a fool
She'll say, "Yes, I know
But I love him so"
And that's how it goes
When a woman loves a man

Tell her, she's a fool
She'll say, "Yes, I know
But I love him so"
And that's how it goes
When a woman loves a man
