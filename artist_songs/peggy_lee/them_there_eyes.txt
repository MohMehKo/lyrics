I fell in love with you the first time I looked into
Them there eyes
You've got a certain lil' cute way of flirtin' with
Them there eyes
They make me feel so happy
They make me feel so blue
Stallin'
No stallin'
Fallin' in a great big way for you

My heart is jumpin'
You sure started somethin with
Them there eyes
You'd better watch out little brown eyes if you're wise
They sparkle
They bubble
They're gonna get you in a whole lot of trouble
You're overworkin' them
There's danger lurkin' in
Them there eyes
