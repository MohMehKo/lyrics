It used to take a farmer a day to get town
Now it takes a minute 'til his plane comes down
Because everything's movin' too fast
Everything's movin' too fast
You better save your money 
Because everything's movin' too fast

You used to eat your spinach, now you never will
Because you think it's modern to take it in a pill
Because everything's movin' too fast
Everything's movin' too fast
You better save your money
Because everything's movin' too fast

You used to talk of rockets shooting to the moon
I used to think you were crazy but I'm taking one at noon
Because everything's movin' too fast
Everything's movin' too fast
You better save your money 
Because everything's movin' too fast

I had a covered wagon, then a model t
I put them in the junkyard, they don't jump enough for me
Because everything's movin' too fast
Everything's movin' too fast
You better save your money 
Because everything's movin' too fast

Now papa used to get his kicks from music that was sweet
Now he gets his kicks from a boogie woogie beat 
Because everything's movin' too fast
Everything's movin' too fast
You better save your money 
Because everything's movin' too fast

Slow down
Slow down 
Slow down
Everything's movin' too fast
