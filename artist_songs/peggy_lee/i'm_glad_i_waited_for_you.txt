I'm glad I waited for you
But then, what else could I do
Yes, there were one or two
I used to date with
But they always knew
I used them to wait with

I'm glad I waited for you
I'm glad my heart waited too
That fav'rite dream of mine
Has just come true
I'm glad I waited for you

That fav'rite dream of mine
Has just come true
I'm glad I waited for you
I'm glad I was true
But what else could I do
I'm glad I waited for you
