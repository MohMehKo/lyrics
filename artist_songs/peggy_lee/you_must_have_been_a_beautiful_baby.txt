You must have been a beautiful baby
You must have been a wonderful child
When you were only starting to go to kindergarten
I bet you drove the little girls wild

And when it came to winning blue ribbons
You must have shown the other kids how
I can see the judges' eyes as they handed you the prize
I bet you made the cutest bow

You must've been a beautiful baby
Cause, baby, look at you now

Hey you must have been a beautiful baby
You must have been a wonderful child
When you were only starting to go to kindergarten
I bet you drove the little girls wild

And when it came to winning blue ribbons
You must have shown the other kids how
I can see the judges' eyes as they handed you the prize
I bet you made the cutest bow

You must've been a beautiful baby
Cause, baby, just look at you now
