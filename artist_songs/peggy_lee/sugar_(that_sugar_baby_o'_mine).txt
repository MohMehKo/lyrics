Sugar, I call my baby my sugar
I never maybe my sugar
That sugar baby of mine
He's special ration funny
He never asks for my money
All that I give him is honey
And that he can get anytime

I'd make a million trips to his lips
If I were a bee
Because he's sweeter than
sugar candy to me
He's confectionary

Sugar, I never cheat on my sugar
Cause I'm too sweet on my sugar
That sugar baby of mine

I'd make a million trips to his lips
If I were a bee
Because he's sweeter than
sugar candy to me
He's confectionary

Sugar, I never cheat on my sugar
Cause I'm too sweet on my sugar
That sugar baby of mine
And he's not rising
That sugar baby of mine
