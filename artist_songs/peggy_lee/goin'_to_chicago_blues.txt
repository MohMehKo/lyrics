Going to Chicago, sorry I can't take you
Going to Chicago, sorry I can't take you
There's nothing in Chicago that a man like you can do

When you see me coming, raise your window high
When you see me coming, raise your window high
When you see me going, baby, hang your head and cry

You're so mean and evil, you do things you shouldn't do
You're so mean and evil, you do things you shouldn't do
And you've got my brand of honey, guess I'll have to put up with you
I was going to Chicago but [?]
