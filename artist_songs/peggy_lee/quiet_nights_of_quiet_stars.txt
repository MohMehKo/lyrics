Quiet nights of quiet stars
Quiet cords from my guitar
Floating on the silence that surrounds us

Quiet thoughts and quiet dreams
Quiet walks by quiet streams
And the window looking
On the mountains and the sea, how lovely

This is where I want to be
Here with you so close to me
Until the final flicker of life's ember

I, who was lost and lonely
Believing life was only a bitter tragic joke
Have found with you the meaning of existence
Oh, my love

This is where I want to be
Here with you so close to me
Until the final flicker of life's ember

I, who was lost and lonely
Believing life was only a bitter tragic joke
Have found with you the meaning of existence
Oh, my love
