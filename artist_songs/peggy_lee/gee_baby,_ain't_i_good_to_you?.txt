Love makes me treat you the way that I do
Gee, baby ain't I good to you?
Nothing is too good for a girl as sweet as you
Gee, baby, now ain't I good to you?

Fur coat for Christmas, diamond ring
Big, fine, foxy Cadillac car and everything
Nothing is too good for a girl as sweet as you
Gee, baby ain't I good to you?
