Something in the way he moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way he woos me
I don't want to leave him now
You know I believe him how

Something in the way he smiles
And I don't need no other lover
Something in his style that shows me
I don't want to leave him now
You know I believe him how

You're asking me, will my love grow?
I don't know, I don't know
You stick around now it may show
I don't know, I don't know

Something in the way he moves
And all I have to do is think of him
Something in the things he shows me
I don't want to leave him now
You know I believe him how

You're asking me, will my love grow?
I don't know, I don't know
You stick around now it may show
I don't know, I don't know

Something in the way he moves
Something in the way he knows
Something in the way he smiles
Something in the way he moves

Something in the way he smiles
Something
