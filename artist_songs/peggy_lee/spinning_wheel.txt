What goes up, must come down. 
Spinnin' wheel, gotta go 'round. 
Talkin' 'bout your troubles, 
It's a cryin' sin. 
Ride a painted pony, 
Let the spinnin' wheel spin. 

Ya got no money, 
And ya, ya got no home. 
Spinnin' wheel, all alone. 
Talkin' 'bout your troubles, 
And ya, ya never learn. 
Ride a painted pony, 
Let the spinnin' wheel turn. 

Did ya find the directing sign, 
On the straight and narrow highway? 
Would you mind a reflecting sign? 
Just let it shine, within your mind, 
And show you the colors that are real. 

Someone is waitin' just for you. 
Spinnin' wheel spinnin' true. 
Drop all your troubles by the river side. 
Catch a painted pony, 
On the spinnin' wheel ride. 

Someone's waitin' just for you. 
Spinnin' wheel spinnin' true. 
Drop all your troubles by the river side, 
Ride a painted pony, 
Let the spinnin' wheel fly.
