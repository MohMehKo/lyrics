Didn't wanna have to do it
Didn't wanna have to break your heart
Didn't wanna have to do it
I kept a-hopin' from the very start
But you kept on a-tryin'
And I knew that you'd end up a-cryin'
And I knew I didn't wanna have to do it at all

Didn't wanna have to do it
Didn't wanna have to be the one to say it
Didn't wanna have to do it
I kept a-hopin' there'd be somethin' to delay it again
Yeah, but then
No, I didn't wanna have to be the one to say "The end"

Was a time that I thought our love could fly
And never never fall
Why should I suppose we were never really meant
To be close to each other at all
No, I

Didn't wanna have to do it
Didn't wanna have to be the one to say it
Didn't wanna have to do it
I kept a-hopin' there'd be somethin' to delay it again
Yeah, but then
No, I didn't wanna have to be the one to say "The end"
No no, not the end, no no no
