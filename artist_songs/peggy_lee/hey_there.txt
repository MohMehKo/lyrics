Hey there.
Hey there, you with the stars in your eyes
Love never made a fool of you
You used to be too wise
Hey there, you on that high flying cloud
Tho' she won't throw a crumb to you
You think some day she'll come to you
Better forget her
Her with her nose in the air
She has you dancing on a string
Break it and she won't care
Won't you take this advice
I hand you like a brother
Or are you not seeing things too clear
Are you too much in love to hear
Is it all going in one ear and out the other.
