I saw you with that ribbon in your hair
Think that I began to stare
Maybe I'll love you for a while

A stranger at a table in a place
And that really pretty face
I wonder what happens when you smile

I might never be your hero
Never been one to fight
That don't mean that I can't be your valentine
I won't be your savior either
Couldn't even if I tried
But I—I think I could be someone you like
Someone you like

Reading in a coffee shop we share
Hiding shy behind my hair
Watching our movie in my mind

I promise, promise not to fly away
Make a story of today
C'mon, give me a try

Now I might never stop your sorrow
Fix you up good as new
That don't mean that I can't hold your hand in mine
I might never say I'm sorry
Even if I done you wrong
But I think I could be someone you like
Someone you like

I might never be your hero
But I think I'd like to try
And the way you look at me is your reply

You got a lot to learn about me
Maybe you could start tonight
'Cause I—I think I could be someone you like
Someone you like
