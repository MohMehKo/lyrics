[Ryan McCartan & Dove Cameron:]
Iiiii-ee-ee-iiiii-ee-ee-I wanna be the blood that it's in your veins
Whyyy-ee-ee-yyyy-ee-ee-yyy-why am I led so easily astray?
It's something about the cool way you understand
Say you will be the life of me, take my hand

[Ryan McCartan & Dove Cameron:]
If I'm lost, why do I feel found?
Pull me under, let me drown
Cause who needs air?
When you're mine, you're safe and sound
Haunted and completely bound to my nightmare
You're a monster, but I wantcha'
(What does that say about me?)
You're a monster, but I wantcha'
What does that say about me?
What does that say about me?

(What does that say?)

[Dove Cameron & Ryan McCartan:]
Weeee-ee-ee-eeee-ee-ee tie together darkness and the day
Beeee-ee-ee-eeee-ee-ee here with me forever in the grave
Has something to do with the beat of your heart
It's nothing like mine, it's the missing part

[Ryan McCartan & Dove Cameron:]
If I'm lost, why do I feel found?
Pull me under, let me drown
Cause who needs air?
When you're mine, you're safe and sound
Haunted and completely bound to my nightmare
You're a monster, but I wantcha'
(What does that say about me?)
You're a monster, but I wantcha'
What does that say about me?

What does that say about me?
What does that say...?

[Ryan McCartan & Dove Cameron:]
You're a monster, but I wantcha'
(What does that say about me?)
You're a monster, but I wantcha'
(I want you, I want you, I want you)
You're a monster, but I wantcha'
(But I want you, but I want you)
(What does that say about me?)
You're a monster, but I wantcha'
What does that say about me?
What does that say?
(Ooo-oo-ooo-ooo-ooo)
What does that say?
