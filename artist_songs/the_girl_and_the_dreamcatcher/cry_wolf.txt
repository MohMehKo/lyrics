I swear I'm done
I swear I'm through
I swear this time, I'm never coming back to you

Break my heart
And I give in
Every time we're done, we're gonna do it again

Water is rising, it's filling the room
Light of my life darling, we are immune
If I am the waves, then you must be the moon
You pull so hard I am drowning

I know I should be leaving
But you make it hard to mean it
When the sun comes up, last night's deleted
When the sun comes up, I've been defeated

All we ever do is cry, cry, cry, cry wolf
All we ever do is cry, cry, cry, cry wolf

Scream it loud
Kiss me sweet
Banging on my love you never miss a beat

Drag me down
Save my life
Always say it's over but we know it's a lie

Water is rising it's filling the room
Light of my life darling we are immune
If I am the waves, then you must be the moon
You pull so hard I am drowning

I know I should be leaving
But you make it hard to mean it
When the sun comes up, last night's deleted
When the sun comes up, I've been defeated

All we ever do is cry, cry, cry, cry wolf
All we ever do is cry, cry, cry, cry wolf

I cry wolf, whoa
All we ever do is cry, cry, cry, cry wolf

I know I should be leaving
But you make it hard to mean it
When the sun comes up, last night's deleted
When the sun comes up, I've been defeated

All we ever do is cry, cry, cry, cry wolf
All we ever do is cry, cry, cry, cry wolf

All we ever do is cry, cry, cry, cry wolf
