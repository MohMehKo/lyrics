I'd sing acapella in the rain
Let the whole world think I've gone insane
Give you all my money, and my name
Nothing I wouldn't do,
Nothing I wouldn't do

When I'm crazy and I don't know why
Would you calm me down and read my mind?
Would you still send shivers up my spine?
Nothing I wouldn't do,
Nothing I wouldn't do

We could be,
We could be anything tonight, just tell me everything you like
Can't you see,
We could be something if we tried, just tell me how to make you mine

What have I gotta do to make you,
What have I gotta do to make you,
What have I gotta do to make you,
Stay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay
[2x]

I would break the laws of gravity
Kill it for you in the first degree
Shut the world out when you need to breathe
Nothing I wouldn't do,
Nothing I wouldn't do

We could be,
We could be anything tonight, just tell me everything you like
Can't you see,
We could be something if we tried, just tell me how to make you mine

What have I gotta do to make you,
What have I gotta do to make you,
What have I gotta do to make you,
Stay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay
[2x]

Stay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay
Yeah-ah-ay-ay-ay, yeah-ah-ay-ay-ay
'Cause I've never known love like this, never known love like this
Stay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay

We could be,
We could be anything tonight, just tell me everything you like
Can't you see,
We could be something if we tried, just tell me how to make you mine

What have I gotta do to make you,
What have I gotta do to make you,
What have I gotta do to make you,
Stay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay
[2x]

Yeah-ah-ay-ay-ay, yeah-ah-ay-ay-ay
