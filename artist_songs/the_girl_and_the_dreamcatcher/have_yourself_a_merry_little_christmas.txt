[Ryan:]
Have yourself a merry little Christmas, let your heart be light
[Dove:]
From now on your troubles will be out of sight
[Ryan:]
Have yourself a merry little Christmas, make the yuletide gay
[Dove:]
From now on your troubles will be miles
[Both:]
Away

Here we are as a olden days, happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more

Through the years
We all will be together
If the fates allow (If the fates allow)
Hang a shining star
Upon the highest bough
[Ryan:]
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
[Dove:] 
Have yourself
[Both:]
A merry little Christmas

Have yourself a merry little Christmas now
