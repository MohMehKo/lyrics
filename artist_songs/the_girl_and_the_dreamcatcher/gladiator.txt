If the monsters in you get too real
I would take on the night for you
If it cut's so deep, it just won't heal
I would take it and die for you

When you think the writing's on the wall
When the only way out is to fall
When it's you and me against it all

When you need me
I will keep on fighting for your love
And If you feel it
I'd go gladiator for your love
You know I mean it
I'd be glad I did it for your love
Yeah, when you need me
When you need me
I'd go gladiator, for you love, for your love
I'd be glad I did it, for your love, for your love
I'd go gladiator, for your love, for your love
For your love, your, your, your love

If you built a wall you can't see through
I'll break it down for you
When you've done that thing you can't undo
You know I'll bury it with you

When you think the writing's on the wall
And the only way out is to fall
When it's you and me against it all

When you need me
I will keeping on fighting for your love
And If you feel it
I'd go to be a gladiator for your love
You know I mean it
I'd be glad I did it for your love
Yeah, when you need me
When you need me
I'd go gladiator, for your love, for your love
I'd be glad I did it, for your love, for your love
I'm going to be a gladiator, for you love, for you love
For your love, your, your, your love

You know I'd do, anything for you love
You know I'd do, anything for you love
Anything for you love
Anything for you love

When you need me
I will keep on fighting for your love
And If you feel it
I'd go gladiator for your love
You know I mean it
I'll be glad I did for your love
Yeah, when you need me
When you need me
(You know I'd do) I'd go gladiator, for your love, for your love
(You know I'd do) I'd be glad I did it, for your love, for your love
I'd go gladiator, (anything for your love) for your love, for your love
For your love, your, your, your love

(You know I'd do) I'd go gladiator, (anything for your love) for your love, for your love
(You know I'd do) I'd be glad I did it, (anything for your love) for your love, for your love
I'd go gladiator, (anything for your love) for your love, for your love (anything for your love)
For your love, your, your, your love
You know I'd do
