Yeah I tried to do it like the cool kids do
Fake it 'til you make it, 'til your face turns blue
But I gave it up, yeah I gave it up
Figured out a little bit about myself
Nothing left of me, I find someone else
So I gave it up, yeah I gave it up

No, no, no, no, no
No, I'm not the same as anyone
No, no, no, no, no
How'd you know I could be anyone?
No, no, no, no, no
No, I'm not the same as anyone
No, no, no, no, no
How'd you know I could be anyone?

I wanna do it, wanna do it, my way, my way, oh
I wanna do it, wanna do it, my way, my way, oh

Take me where I know I won't be right or wrong
Don't need no permission to do what I want
It's not worth the cost, it's not worth the cost
I keep finding diamonds every time I fall
So why would anybody play it safe at all?
It's not what I want, it's not what I want

No, no, no, no, no
No, I'm not the same as anyone
No, no, no, no, no
How'd you know I could be anyone?

I wanna do it, wanna do it, my way, my way, oh
I wanna do it, wanna do it, my way, my way, oh

Don't, don't you wanna do it?
Don't, don't you wanna do it?
Do it, do it, do it, (oh, oh, oh, oh)
Don't, don't you wanna do it?
Don't, don't you wanna do it?
Do it, do it, do it, (oh, oh, oh, oh)

No, no, no, no, no
No, I'm not the same as anyone
No, no, no, no, no
I'm not just anyone, yeah

I wanna do it, wanna do it, my way, my way, oh
I wanna do it, wanna do it, my way, my way, oh
