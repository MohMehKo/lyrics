You can look to the mountain
You can talk to the dead
You can run to the city lights
But it's all in your head
You can look to a stranger
But all you'll find is a wall
You can wish all you want
But no one answers at all

Goodbyes
They are flies
The rise from shit
And I was skinning
A new beginning
While you were grinning
Like a slit

You can try not to cry out
As you wake in the night
You can stare at the blackness
But it's taken your sight
You imagine a face there
That you can almost touch
You can reach all you want
But it's only a crutch

Goodbyes
They are flies
That rise from shit
And I was skinning 
A new beginning
While you grinning
Like a slit

Where are you now?
Where is the crowd?
These sleeping streets
Are speaking aloud
And I couldn't recall
The feeling at all
The moment I realized I was going to fall
