Sucker myself into believing that I'm doing the right thing
I think of your face and I pretend that I'm not alone
I'm lining up all the love and the trust and the good things,
But there's a hole in my heart where I once kept a piece of home

What if one of yours turned a color
You didn't mean for it to be
And what if one of yours became another
Would you hear it say:
Let me go
This isn't what I wanted. I can't be here anymore
Let me go
This isn't what I needed. I can't exist here anymore

I've been thinking about my money and how I gave it all away
I've been thinking about the people and how I should have never let them stay
I've been thinking about how I always have to write just one more song
Well you know me, and that I'll never change
But I meant it well all along, and I was wrong

What if one of yours turned a color
You didn't mean for it to be
And what if one of yours became another
Would you hear it say:
Let me go
This isn't what I wanted. I can't be here anymore
Let me go
This isn't what I needed. I can't exist here anymore

Replace the silence with deafening sound
Send away the people, I want no one around
This is my greatest mistake
I hope you realize
Die everytime I look in your eyes

What if one of yours turned a color
You didn't mean for it to be
And what if one of yours became another
Would you hear it say:
Let me go
This isn't what I wanted. I can't be here anymore
Let me go
This isn't what I needed. I can't exist here anymore
