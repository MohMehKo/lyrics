Blood Red Head

No one knows who sent it
Or what it first was called
No one knows what made it
Or when it first was mauled

No one understands why
It burns but never dies
One thing is for sure though
That burning bastard flies

Here comes the burning
Blood red, head on fire
As laser beams shoot 
From the eyes of the choir

It doesn't need a body 
'Cause it flies through the air
It's a blood red head on fire 
And it doesn't care

If you think you're badass
And you try to stand your ground
It will look into your eyes 
And make it's awful sound

Then it will suddenly fly at you
And hit you in the head or chest
Then your body will disintegrate
Because the Blood Red Head's the best

Here comes the burning 
Blood red, head on fire
As laser beams shoot 
From the eyes of the choir

It doesn't need a body 
'Cause it flies through the air
It's a blood red head on fire 
And it doesn't care

Razor sharp fangs in a gross mouth
Yellow burning eyes, surprise
Gordy cauliflower ears
And talons growing out of its face
Eight feet off the ground
Moving fast and looking down
The people scatter as the foul death spreads

You may think Duke Lion
Could defeat this awful foe
You may be right
Because they fought about a week ago

The Blood Red Head on fire
Was immune to Duke's fireballs
So Duke gave up and went on 
A quest for the Ice Sword of Gaultry

Here comes the burning 
Blood red, head on fire
As laser beams shoot 
From the eyes of the choir

It doesn't need a body 
'Cause it flies through the air
It's a blood red head on fire 
And it doesn't care
