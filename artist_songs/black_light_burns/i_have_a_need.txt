We wake, wake on the inside
I must have a need to be terrorized
So let's walk down the same path
To the hole deep in the hollow

We stand, stand on the edge again
Too afraid to turn back or jump in
There's a storm brewing like a ceiling
But I'll never spit out the feeling

This dark fever is unstoppable
This burning chill is unstoppable
This blackest wish has taken hold
I'm sorry it cannot be controlled

You're too far, far gone to be mine
Wherever I go, you're never on time
It's too dark, too black to be a star
I'll hurt wherever you are

We slept, slpet for too long
We see, see what we did wrong
I'll never let it paralyze me again
I wanna bleed like it's over

This dark fever is unstoppable
This burning chill is unstoppable
This blackest wish has taken hold
I'm sorry it cannot be controlled
