You may find
That my appetite gets it's way
It keeps growing and growing
Before you know it
I'm a beast swallowing prey
And it is clear
It is clear
It's as clear as a fucking bell
The more I wear off on you,
The more I seem to wear your smell

C'mon

Get away and save yourself
Turn away and don't look back
Get away and save yourself
Grey skies are turning black

'cause I will always 
Hurt everyone I love
If I were you,
I'd run away 'cause it's true
That I will always
Hurt everyone I love
I'm aching for you
But you're bound to bleed if I adore you

You will see
That there's a blood clot in my heart
I'm trying to make time to push it out
But I can't quite seem to start
And it is sore
It is sore
It's so sore that it hurts to feed
You keep taking little pieces of me,
I'm going to show you how to bleed

C'mon

Get away and save yourself
Turn away and don't look back
Get away and save yourself
Grey skies are turning black

'cause I will always 
Hurt everyone I love
If I were you,
I'd run away 'cause it's true
That I will always
Hurt everyone I love
I'm aching for you
But you're bound to bleed if I adore you

I think I'll keep you
In a place where I can see you
But I know I'll break you like before
And I just can't do this anymore

'cause I will always 
Hurt everyone I love
If I were you,
I'd run away 'cause it's true
That I will always
Hurt everyone I love
I'm aching for you
But you're bound to bleed if I adore you

I'm aching for you
