If you could burn it out
Like a tick buried in your hide
If you could tear it out
Like a thorn stuck in your side
Then you can bet that I
Don't want to look at what you find
Because I'm afraid that I
Might want to keep it for myself

I thought I was above you
I hate that I love you

If you could tell a lie
Sharp enough to get through my skin
If you could sell a lie
To make me want to come back again
Then you can bet that I
Want to feel it dribble down my chin
Sometimes I think I'd give everything away
To let that animal in

I thought I was above you
I hate that I love you
