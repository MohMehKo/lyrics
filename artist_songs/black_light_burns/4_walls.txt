Go for the jugular, cut the vein
And kiss it away, kiss it away, kiss it away
Everything that brings me pain

It's not as hard to bend in the end
So let's do it again, do it again, do it again
And this feels so new to be infecting you

These 4 walls are blistering
I watch the paint peel
But I cannot wake from this dream
'cause this is not love
This is not clean
I'll keep digging down deeper in you
Until I find what makes you scream

I get a little aroused as it dies:
That look in your eyes, look in your eyes,
Look in your eyes
As I begin to get under your skin

And now I know why I do
Take it out on you, take it on you
'cause you always take it on the chin
That's what you get for letting me in

These 4 walls are blistering
I watch the paint peel
But I cannot wake from this dream
'cause this is not love
This is not clean
I'll keep digging down deeper in you
Until I find what makes you scream
