Because of you
I've searched
The back streets to the shore
The river banks
No thanks
It won't feel like before
Because of this
I fish for little bits of time
I memorized your thoughts
And turned them into mine

I thought I'd let you know
I won't be letting go
I won't be turning cheek
I won't be swallowing
I thought I'd let you know
I won't be letting go
I won't be turning cheek
I won't be suffering

Because of you
I waste
The life I thought I made
I throw away what's warm
The colour starts to fade
Because it seems
I dream
Of being somewhere else
I try to find that place
And end up by myself

I thought I'd let you know
I won't be letting go
I won't be turning cheek
I won't be swallowing
I thought I'd let you know
I won't be letting go
I won't be turning cheek
I won't be suffering
[x3]

Because of you
