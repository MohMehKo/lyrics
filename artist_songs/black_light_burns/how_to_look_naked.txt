I have seen people bleed
And I thought I'd seen it all
But my own two eyes would prove me wrong that day
There are things that I've done
Only seen by the sun
And those things will be buried in my grave
The crows and buzzards will pick your bones clean
No name of yours will be upon the wall
Hold tight on Halloween, and rape by magazines
We line up on the edge to watch you fall

No one knows, you don't take off your clothes
No one knows
No one knows, you don't take off your clothes
No one knows

You took to the land, like fishes take to sand
You clambered up your cross to raise your flag
Made tissue paper sales, used thread instead of nails
Your autograph was carved across your back
We thought that you were done, but then you grabbed your gun
You pushed and fought and ran full speed ahead
You turned for the hill, we cannot find you still
We hit the lights and hoped that you'd be dead

No one knows, you don't take off your clothes
No one knows
No one knows, you don't take off your clothes
No one knows

Won't stop now
If you know
What? Oh!

We hope we'll get to see you fall through the canopy
With a stomach full of blood you'll find the ground

No one knows, you don't take off your clothes
No one knows
No one knows, you don't take off your clothes
No one knows
