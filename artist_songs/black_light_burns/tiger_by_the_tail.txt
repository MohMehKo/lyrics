I see, look across the way there
Like flame, giving me the same stare
Eyes locked
Exhibits A and B
you draw a line
Cutting through the air and
Connect
Making us a pair then
It's my hope to get burned
Don't you see?

Big kitty cats don't lick no paws
And little kitty cats don't show no claws
Big kitty cats don't lick no paws
And little kitty cats don't show no claws.

I got a tiger by the tail
And I'm gonna give it a little kick
And then a big kiss
[x2]

It's not safe down on the ground, no
They keep circling around, yeah
You better learn to climb a tree
We're not safe
Not where we at, no
You had better get yourself a bat and
Start swinging away at anything you see

Big kitty cats don't lick no paws
And little kitty cats don't show no claws
Big kitty cats don't lick no paws
And little kitty cats don't show no claws

I got a tiger by the tail
And I'm gonna give it a little kick
And then a big kiss
[x4]
