When you die I'm gonna roll around and laugh on the floor
I'll party like we never had a party before
When you fall I'm gonna be there just to raise up a glass
All dreams fulfilled of putting boots in your ass

You know there's something inside me
Like an animal that's gotta get out
You know there's something inside me
That makes me wanna put my fist in your mouth

When I die I'm gonna come back and haunt you for fun
Slam doors, move books, make you pee while you run
When I'm done I'm gonna celebrate my ghostly success
With my invisible penis watching ladies undress

You know there's something inside me
Like an animal that's gotta get out
You know there's something inside me
But it's not me

You know there's something inside me 
Like an animal that's gotta get out
You know there's something inside me
That makes me wanna put my fist in your mouth

But it's not me
