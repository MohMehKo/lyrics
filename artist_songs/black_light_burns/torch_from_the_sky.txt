Did you hear as she called
As her voice came down the hall
How it trembled as soft as a little girl?
Towards the knock on the door
I watched you glide across the floor
As you answered a hundred voices spoke

We will crawl through the mud
They will bathe in their own blood
We will take them like a splinter from an eye
And we come in the night
We are made of blackest light
Like a torch falling fast out of the sky

There's no fat in this land
The old heart has left its hand
So let's sit and watch the distant fires glow
We will steal what we could
We are through being good
We will only be the sum of what you know

Did you hear the awful sound
As they pushed into the town?
I could tell the switch had flipped inside your head
There's no love left to give
We can't hide, we can't live
We are holding hands and walking with the dead

You can take me home
But I can't be alone
I can't be alone

Did you hear as she called

We will crawl through the mud
They will bathe in their own blood
We will take them like a splinter from an eye
And we come in the night
We are made of the blackest light
Like a torch falling fast out of the sky
like a torch falling fast out of the sky
Like a torch falling fast out of the sky
Like a torch falling fast out of the sky
