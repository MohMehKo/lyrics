Water grey
Through the windows, up the stairs

Chilling rain
Like an ocean everywhere

[Chorus:]
Don't want to reach for me do you
I mean nothing to you
The little things give you away

And now there will be no mistaking
The levis are breaking

All you've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you

And six feet under water
I
Do


Hope decays
Generations disappear

Washed away
As a nation simply stares

[Chorus:]
Don't want to reach for me do you
I mean nothing to you
The little things give you away

But there will be no mistaking
The levees are breaking

All you've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you

And six feet under water
I
Do

All you've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you

And six feet under ground now
I
Now I do

Little things give you away
Little things give you away
Little things give you away
Little things give you away
Little things give you away

(Little things give you away)

All you've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you

(Little things give you away)

All you've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you

(Little things give you away)

All you've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you

(Little things give you away)

All you've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you

(Little things give you away)

All you've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you

(Little things give you away)

All you've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you

(Little things give you away)
