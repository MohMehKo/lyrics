I got my camera, I'm gonna take your picture tonight,
And you can see what you look like
You got your camera, you're gonna take my picture tonight,
And I can see what I look like too,
With you, who knew that we'd look so good
Beaten black and blue

You got your hair tied back and your fur coat on
You call your girlfriends up and then we're gone
We gonna meet down the street and we're drinking for free,
We pinky shake as you order your martini
One last round and away we go
We run a little bit late, but make the show
And we're getting pretty friendly in the back of the car
We gotta fight that crowd to reach that bar

We're gonna rage in the city all night long
We're gonna rage in the city all night long
Your discotheque won't play my song
We're gonna rage in the city all night long

I got my camera, I'm gonna take your picture tonight,
And you can see what you look like
You got your camera, you're gonna take my picture tonight,
And I can see what I look like too,
With you, who knew that we'd look so good
Beaten black and blue

Well the band goes on, but we digress
We gotta take the back stairs for roof access
We can hear the city scream as we yell from the top
It's 12:19 and we won't stop
Late night lurks are underground
Downstairs snares and ugly sounds
I'm gonna make a proposition that I know you're about
We're going back to your place to act it out

And then we'll rage in the city all night long
We're gonna rage in the city all night long
Your discotheque won't play my song
We're gonna rage in the city all night long

The bridge, the tower, the top of the roof
We light up the night and we're taking it to
House to house, and mouth to mouth
The fire escapes we shake where the sky scrapes
The flights rise, and they collide
Tonight we will not be denied
I could see that you were trouble from the moment we met,
But sometimes I've gotta live out what I'm gonna regret

We're gonna rage in the city all night long
We're gonna rage in the city all night long
Your discotheque won't play my song
We're gonna rage in the city all night long
