I've got something to say
I've acquired a taste for watching you in pain
It's pretty hard to admit
It makes me feel like shit
But I mean it

And I know that I'm wrong
The weaker you get, the more I feel strong
So I want you to leave
Wipe you face on your sleeve
And beat it

This doesn't end with you
I walk around and I think if people only knew
That I wish they were cursed
That I wish them the worst
I really wish 'em the worst

But I'm doing my best
And I hope you forgive me now that I've confessed
Because I'm trying to resist
My heart becoming a fist
Forever

Because you can't, you can't
You can't stop a bullet
I'm giving you my trigger
But you better never pull it

You can't, you can't
You can't stop a bullet
I'm giving you my trigger
But you better never pull it

You've got something to say
You've acquired a taste for watching me in pain
It's pretty hard to admit
It makes you feel like shit
But you mean it

What the hell can we do?
I'm a different face of the man you knew
I'm a hole you'll fill
For the rest of your life

Because you can't, you can't
You can't stop a bullet
I'm giving you my trigger
But you better never pull it

You can't, you can't
You can't stop a bullet
I'm giving you my trigger
But you better never pull it

[x4]
You can't, you can't
You can't stop a bullet
I'm giving you my trigger
But you better never pull it
