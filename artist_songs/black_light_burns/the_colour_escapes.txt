Come on baby lemme give you a name
And we'll see if you can find a purpose
These faces all look the same
And I can guarantee they're worthless
Some souls are bought and sold
They fold beneath the surface
We cannot take their hands
They'll hold their gold and curse us

The colour escapes, you know
You've seen my heart and it's black as coal
It's not the one that I wanted to show

You were built like a light on the stilt
And I can see you wilt in silence
People stand around waiting for signs
They become blind to your vibrance
They don't look, put their faith in a book
The end result is violence
Mind you, that bliss it sits on shit
It sits on mindlessness

The colour escapes, you know
You've seen my heart and it's black as coal
It's not the one I wanted to show
