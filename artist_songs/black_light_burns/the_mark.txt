I have a mark on me
Like a brand on my skin that only I can see
I don't know what it means, I get caught up in dreams
I feel like running away,
So yeah, let's run away
Sometimes you kinda have to get lost
If you're ever gonna find your way back to where you came from
And if we go there, they'll just want us to bleed
Because it's never enough
It's never enough
It's never enough

So cut out the heart
And watch the world burn down
Let's tear it apart
Let's leave a mark
Let's leave a mark

I followed the footprints
Around in the snow
I ended up doing circles and came back home
Where I started to find that everyone was a sign
And all that mattered was that this fucking fire's mine
Sometimes you kinda have to die
If you're ever gonna find your way back to where your life is
If hate is a fist and love is a flame
I'm gonna smash it and burn it 'cause it's all the same

So cut out the heart
And watch the world burn down
Let's tear it apart
Let's leave a mark
Let's leave a mark

It keeps bleeding and bleeding
It's never enough,
It's a lush, it combusts and it continues to swell
And I've tried, yes I've tried to ignore this scar
But it keeps burning in me and it won't let me breathe

So cut out the heart
And watch the world burn down
Let's tear it apart
Let's leave a mark
Let's leave a mark
