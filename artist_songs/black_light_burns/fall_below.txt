You are the one that made me
Buried and betrayed me
You are the one that threw me away

You are the one that did this
Beg for your forgiveness
Get down on your fucking knees and pray

'Cause you brought this on me
Stop runnin' your mouth I know you don't agree
Just relax, get inside
You and I are gonna take a ride
Don't hate me but just for fun
I left a little note sayin' what you've done
And now I got that off your chest
So start diggin' a hole so you can get some rest

(To make sure you're happy, to make sure...)

You are the one that earned me
Lit the match and burned me
But somehow I can't give you all the blame

'Cause I am the one that met you
I wish I could forget you
But I keep crawlin' back to fan the flame

'Cause you brought this on me
Stop runnin' your mouth I know you don't agree
Just relax, get inside
You and I are gonna take a ride
Don't hate me but just for fun
I left a little note sayin' what you've done
And now I got that off your chest
So start diggin' a hole so you can get some rest

'Cause you brought this on me
Stop runnin' your mouth I know you don't agree
Just relax, get inside
You and I are gonna take a ride
Don't hate me but just for fun
I left a little note sayin' what you've done
And now I got that off your chest
So start diggin' a hole so you can get some rest

(To make sure you're happy, to make sure you're...dead)
