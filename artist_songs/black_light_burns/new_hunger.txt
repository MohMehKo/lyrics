Pulling on your lazy arms
Get up out of bed
There's vanity
In the holes from which we bled
Your armies have come and gone
Silence on the battleground
This insurgence was just enough to see them drowned

You wanna swim with us, you've gotta get to the water

Take me to your mountain
Tear down the waterfall
It's comming near
Listen you can hear it call
So put a coin inside your mouth
And wade out to your knees
You crumble down
And give yourself to the sea

You wanna swim with us, you've gotta get to the water
