Drop the ship in the water
and don't look back
Paint the stables red
and the fire black
We watch the white horse run,
White horse ride
from the cell ain't a soul that's gonna get inside
Read the face as i shoot him
right between the ears
As his holes don gloves
when he's spitting spears
There's an eye of a liar on the other side
and a hole through the chest of the one that died

I want you to
you giveth away
because I want you to
you taketh away
because I want you to
you kiss on the lips
because I want you to
i want you to

Kill a few,
kill a dozen
Kill another's kin
Well he's rappin on the pane of the window again
He's got a blade for a tongue
and snakes for eyes
and his hands on the handles of a hundred knives
And if they don't fall down
you can watch them run
with two bullets in your pocket
and a rusty gun
We're goin' three by three to the mountain top
to throw that son of a bitch
right off the highest drop

I want you to
you open your mouth
because I want you to
you dance on the heart
because I want you to
you choke on your words
because I want you to
I want you to

The devil won't take my place
I need to touch your pretty face
You don't know your name
but you're all pretty much the same
You wanna be my thrown
I can promise that you'll be let down
You're a whirling dervish
built to purchase
afraid to surface
And so this...
baby

I want you to
you pull out the plug
because I want you to
you stick in my guts
because I want you to
you pray on your knees
because I want you to
I want you to

I want you to
you giveth away
because I want you to
you taketh away
because I want you to
you kiss on the lips
because I want you to
I want you to
