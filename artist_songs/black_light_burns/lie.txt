I'm living a lie
And it's not the best thing for me
But anyone and everyone is gonna hear another story
I'm building a house
Of murderous intention
To keep it all from coming down
I've gotta focus my attention
'cause confidence is key
When violating trust
I'm making sure that I believe
I'm doing what I must
Which is attempting to kill
The little boy inside
But as hard as I try...
The child will not die

Now I'm burning alive, just like you

I'm irrelevant
And I'm living down in the shit
I follow these pigs around
But I never get used to it
'cause they keep building and building
Their feculent franchise
I wish I could see this filth
Through someone else's eyes
'cause ignorance was bliss
But now I must adjust
These animals, they operate
On jealousy and lust
I'm taking back what was lost
And I will not be denied
I'm crawling my way to the surface outside

Now I'm burning alive, just like you
