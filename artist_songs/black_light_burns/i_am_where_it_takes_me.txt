It's all I see, It's all I see.

Please take it away.
It's holding me, it's holding me.
Please take it away.
It's more than me, it's more than me.
Please take it away.
It's killing me, it's killing me.
Please take it away.

I run, it follows
I speak, it swallows
I am where it takes me.
I love, it breaks me.

It's under me, it's under me.
Please take it away.
It's watching me, it's watching me.
Please take it away.
It's touching me, it's touching me.
Please take it away.
It's just like me, it's just like me.
Please take it away.

I run, it follows
I speak, it swallows
I am where it takes me.
I love, it breaks me.
