Where are we?
Where are we?
We are searching endlessly
I got only one night left
I'm never going to bed
And where is she?
Not free
Brain chained
Lock and key
She got
A little fever
But it's killing my head

I thought I burned the world
Around me down but now
The sound is clearly calling us
Right back to watch them wind it up
I thought you burned the world
Around you down but now
The sound is clearly calling us
Right back to watch them wind it up again

We fall
We break
It seems real but it's all fake
It's on the television
It's your decision
You walk away with weights on
And you're gonna sink
You're extinct
In your hole
They say you've lost your soul
I know the grass won't grow
So slick, you slipped
But you slid too slow
You know

I thought I burned the world
Around me down but now
The sound is clearly calling us
Right back to watch them wind it up
I thought you burned the world
Around you down but no
The sound is clearly calling us
Right back to watch them wind it up again
