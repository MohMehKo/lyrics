Like a pack of wolves,
In the dead of night,
Like a howling wind,
That blows out the light.
My love is coming for you,
You're the one I crave,
I've got an empty heart,
Like an open grave.

Like the mystic tombs,
Where the shadows fall,
Like a candles flame,
Floating down the hall.
My love is coming for you,
As the black crow flies, flies, flies,
It's like an empty head,
With a thousand eyes.
