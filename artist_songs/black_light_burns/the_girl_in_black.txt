There's a flame in the desert at the foot of the hills
And there's a circle in the sand where the water spills
There's a line up the spine of the girl in black
And it rips through her dress at the small of her back
She's been waiting there to take you through that door
So you can lay her down on the cavern floor
And you'll see the same flame burning in her eyes
As you smear your stink across her inner thighs

You couldn't leave well enough alone
You hold your heart like it's made out of stone
You couldn't leave well enough alone
Alone alone alone

She slithers through the snow like a snake but she's still
And she comes floating through the window without touching the sill
She prefers to make an entrance without using the door
And she'll be standing on your bed before she crosses the floor
She's a will-o'-the-wisp as she's swinging her hips
Her breath is like a worm spinning silk from her lips
And tonight spook lights will be seen from your room
And you and her and Jack and I are swimming in gloom

You couldn't leave well enough alone
You hold your heart like it's made out of stone
You couldn't leave well enough alone
Alone alone alone
