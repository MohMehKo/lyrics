Give me just one more drug and I'll be free
give me just one more you and I'll be me
give me just one more half and I'll be whole
give me just one more chance to save my soul
let me hear it now

Give me just one black and I'll be white
give me just one more day and I'll be right
give me just one more fire and I'll go cold
let me just stay this young 'til I get old

Hang low
take it off for show
I've been sold
it's good to be gold

hang low
take it off for show
I've been sold
it's good to be gold

Give me just one more laugh so I can cry
give me just one more low and I'll be high
give me just one more cross that I can bear
give me just one more shit so I can care
give me just one more cent and I'll be rich
give me just one more scratch to cure my itch
give me just one more drink and I'll be dry
give me just one more life so I can die

Hang low
take it off for show
I've been sold
it's good to be gold

Hang low 
take it off for show
I've been sold
it's good to be gold

Hang low 
take it off for show
I've been sold
it's good to be gold

Hang low
take it off for show
I've been sold
it's good to be gold.
