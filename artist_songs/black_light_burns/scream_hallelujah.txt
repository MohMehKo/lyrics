Now things have turned for the worse
Thought I was so well rehearsed
I guess I'm probably cursed
I just don't know 
I beat my head on the wall
I'm trying not to recall
The inevitable fall
And so it goes
I'm struck so shockingly dumb
I know now I can become
The definition of numb
And you can too 
So let's all pull out our teeth
And go to sleep like good sheep 
Let's watch our TVs and weep
Oh yes

You better scream Hallelujah
Scream Hallelujah
You better scream Hallelujah
(Hallelujah)
[x2]

Now get the fuck back in line
And pay your taxes on time
And lay around like you're swine
There is no doubt
You live your life on the screen
And talk about what you've seen
A vicarious dream
You won't live out
They put the rails in your head
And as you travel you're led
You can't control what you're fed
But you won't gag
So lock yourself up indoors
Ignorant media whores
Before you're gasping in your plastic bag

You better scream Hallelujah
Scream Hallelujah
You better scream Hallelujah
(Hallelujah)
[x2]

I don't want you to go it alone
So I left a little seed and it's grown
But somehow you don't seem
Like one for watering
I'll never ask you why
But these little things, they die

You better scream Hallelujah
Scream Hallelujah
You better scream Hallelujah
(Hallelujah)
[x2]
