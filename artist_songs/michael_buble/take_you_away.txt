I see you're forcing that smile
And it's been a while
Since you've had a break
Oh, you can't get it right
As hard as you've tried
Things ain't going your way

So, baby, take my hand
'Cause I've got a plan to get us
Straight outta here
Start packing your bag,
Got a plane to catch
So, let's disappear

The world keeps spinning and we can't stop it
Let's slip out when no one's watching

So, baby, let's go
Let me take you away
Let's hit the road
I'll be your escape
Let's travel the globe
We're leaving today
We'll chart the unknown
Let me take you away!

We don't need to go far
To stare at the stars
And change our point of view
Gonna get you to dance,
Make some sweet romance
Babe, it's all about you

Kick your shoes off and laugh
It's time to relax,
The sun will warm us all
Ain't no time to rethink
Grab a lemon drink
And let the good times roll

The world keeps spinning and we can't stop it
Let's slip out when no one's watching

So, baby, let's go
Let me take you away
Let's hit the road
I'll be your escape
Let's travel the globe
We're leaving today
We'll chart the unknown
Let me take you away!

As long as it's you and me
It doesn't have to be so far away
So why don't we go on home and just put down and say, ay, ay, ay

So, baby, let's go
Let me take you away
Let's hit the road
I'll be your escape
Let's travel the globe
We're leaving today
We'll chart the unknown
Let me take you away!
