Como e' bella ce' la luna brille e' strette
Strette como e' tutta bella a passeggiare
Sotto il cielo di Roma

Down each avenue or via, street or strata
You can see 'em disappearin' two by two
On an evenin' in Roma

Do they take 'em for espresso, yeah, I guess so
On each lover's arm a girl, I wish I knew
On an evenin' in Roma

Though there's grinin' and mandolinin' in sunny Italy
The beginning has just begun when the sun goes down
So please meet me in the plaza near your casa
I am only one and that is much too few
On an evenin' in Roma

Don't know what the country's comin' to
But in Rome do as the Romans do
Will you on an evenin' in Roma?

Como e' bella ce' la luna brille e' strette
Strette como e' tutta bella a passeggiare
Sotto il cielo di Roma

Don't know what the country's comin' to
But in Rome do as the Romans do
Will you on an evenin' in Roma?
Sott'er celo de Roma
On an evenin' in Roma
