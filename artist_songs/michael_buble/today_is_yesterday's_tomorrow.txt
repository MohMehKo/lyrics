Maybe my patience and my motivation are playing on separate teams
Maybe I found someone I really, really need
Well baby you're worth it and I'm not impervious to what you do to me
You helped me find my sense of urgency

Time flies
I wish I would've met with someone psychic
Cause my, my
It took sometime for me to realize it

Cause Today Is Yesterday's Tomorrow
Why take any longer
The feeling's getting stronger
No, I can't wait. I can't wait anymore!
Cause Today Is Yesterday's Tomorrow
I ain't Nostradamus
But the future is upon us
No, I can't wait. I can't wait anymore!
Anymore, yeah

And I know that you're hoping that this is The Notebook but baby as you will see
Mr Gosling ain't got nothing on me
Like Noah and Allie, when Harry met Sally we knew that this had to be
The kind of love that lasts eternally

And I know that some will say that it could end in heartache
But, my dear
You only fear the chances that we don't take

Cause Today Is Yesterday's tomorrow
Why take any longer
The feeling's getting stronger
No, I can't wait. I can't wait anymore!
Cause Today Is Yesterday's Tomorrow
I ain't Nostradamus
But the future is upon us
No, I can't wait. I can't wait anymore!
Anymore, yeah

Don't let it pass babe
Cause the future comes fast, yeah

Cause Today Is Yesterday's Tomorrow
Why take any longer
The feeling's getting stronger
No, I can't wait. I can't wait anymore!
Anymore, yeah

Cause Today Is Yesterday's Tomorrow
I ain't Nostradamus
But the future is upon us
No, I can't wait. I can't wait anymore!
Anymore, yeah

Today is yesterday's tomorrow
Why take any longer
Why take longer, the feeling's getting stronger
Whoa yeah
