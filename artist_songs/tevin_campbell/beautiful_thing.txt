I guess I don't wear them on my sleeve 
(The feelings for you I bear) 
I don't wanna get all sensitive 
But if you don't know, I care 
Communication's a strange relation to me 
Forgive me, if you can 
But the secret 
Is that I'm overjoyed inside, you see 
And when I pray I tell the Man... 

[Chorus 1:]
It never ceases to amaze me, 
She's all I dream about 
Beautiful thing 
Conversations never phase me 
She's all I talk about 
My beautiful thing 

How could you really ever know 
If I never extend my hand? 
I don't wanna make you run away 
So I pray you'll understand 
My hesitation with love relations could be 
My only doubt and fear 
Then, baby you came 
Into my life and now you're all I dream 
And once again I'm thanking Him... 

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2:]
Everyday's a new adventure 
So happy that I got 
A beautiful thing 
From November to November 
She's all I wanna shout 
My Beautiful thing 

Darlin', so beautiful
