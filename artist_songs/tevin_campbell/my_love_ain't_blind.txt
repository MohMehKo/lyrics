[Chorus]
Did you think that you could get away
Tellin lies playing games running around on me
I can't believe
You were givin my love away
Trying to creep but baby don't sleep on me
My love ain't blind baby

Just the other night
After making love with me
You said that I fulfilled your every need
Baby you got on the phone
Thinkin I was fast asleep
Tellin someone else what you had just told me

[Chorus]
Did you think that you could get away
Tellin lies playing games running around on me
I can't believe
You were givin my love away
Trying to creep but baby don't sleep on me
My love ain't blind baby

While you were trying to creep
Whatever led you to believe
That you could ever run your game on me
Thought I was too blind to see
Somehow curiousity
Made it clear to me
And now your history

You said that you would be
My everything
How could you lie to me
There's no playing the cheat
Why can't you see
My love ain't blind baby

[Chorus]
Did you think that you could get away
Tellin lies playing games running around on me
I can't believe
You were givin my love away
Trying to creep but baby don't sleep on me
My love ain't blind baby

I thought I'd done for you
How could you be so untrue
I'm no longer down it's over now
What goes around, comes around again

I can't believe
Don't sleep on me, don't sleep on me

[Chorus x2]
Did you think that you could get away
Tellin lies playing games running around on me
I can't believe
You were givin my love away
Trying to creep but baby don't sleep on me
my love ain't blind baby
