[Chorus]
Think of it all the time
It's always on my mind
Losing all control
Of my heart and soul
Even when I close my eyes
The feeling never dies
Losing all control
Of my heart and soul

Slowly but surely,
All control is leaving me
Seems as though my mind has gone astray
Can't stop thinkin bout
How I just can't do without
I know I can not go on this way

[Chorus]
Think of it all the time
It's always on my mind
Losing all control
Of my heart and soul
Even when I close my eyes
The feeling never dies
Losing all control
Of my heart and soul

O I can't believe
All the things it does to me
Got me doing things it shouldnt be
Everybody's tellin me
About responsibility
Deep inside I feel my soul at ease

[Repeat x2]
But still
I can't stop
Thinkin bout how I
Can't help the way I feel
Can't deny it takes control of me

[Chorus until end]
Think of it all the time
It's always on my mind
Losing all control
Of my heart and soul
Even when I close my eyes
The feeling never dies
Losing all control
Of my heart and soul
