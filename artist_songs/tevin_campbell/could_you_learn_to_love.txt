[VERSE 1:]
Maybe I don't deserve your affection
But I got it bad, so bad for you
So baby I need some indication 
That when I give my heart
You'll give me your heart too 

[CHORUS:]
Could you learn to love someone 
Could you teach your heart to love
I wonder if you could do it
Cause I know that I could sure love you 
Could you learn to love someone 
Could you teach your heart to love 
Tell me that you could do it 
Cause I wanna give my love to you

[VERSE 2:]
Now what can I do to make an impression 
I'll die 1000 times for you, baby 
What more you want then dedication 
Why can't you give your love to me 
The way I give my love to you 

[BRIDGE:]
In a world where people 
Are longing for true love 

How could anyone not know what they want 
For once in your life 
Don't be afraid to love 
Don't run away from love 
Don't be afraid to love 

[CHORUS x3]
