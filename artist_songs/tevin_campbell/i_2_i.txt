[Tevin Campbell:]
Yeah, Yeah, Hey Yeah!

Got myself a notion, one I know that you'll understand
To set the world in motion, by reaching out for each others' hand
Maybe we'll discover, what we should have known all along
(Yeah)
One way or another, together's where we both belong

If we listen to each others' heart
We'll find we're never too far apart
And maybe love is the reason why
For first time ever we're seeing it eye to eye

If a wall should come between us,
Too high to climb, Too hard to break through
I know that love will lead us,
And find a way to bring me to you
So don't be in a hurry
Think before you count us out
(Ohh)
You don't have to worry, I will never let you down

[Rosie Gains:]
Nothing's gonna stop us now!

[Tevin Campbell:]
If we listen to each others' heart
We'll find we're never too far apart
And maybe love is the reason why
For first time ever we're seeing it eye to eye

Lovers always seeing it eye to eye
(Yes we are)
I knew I was seeing it
{Seeing it eye to eye}
Lovers always seeing it eye to eye
(Seeing it eye to eye, Yeah)
I knew I was seeing it
{Seeing it eye to eye}
Lovers always seeing it eye to eye
(I think we're seeing it eye to eye)
I knew I was seeing it
{Eye to eye}

If you're ever lonely, stop
You don't have to be
After all has fallen
I'll bead a way from you to me

[Rosie Gains:]
(Take a look inside and see!)

[Tevin Campbell:]
Yeah, Yeah!

If we listen to each others' heart
We'll find we're never too far apart
And maybe love is the reason why
For the first time ever we're seeing it eye to eye

{Seeing it eye to eye}
Seeing it eye to eye, baby!
