Oh yeah, oh girl, oh girl
Oh girl, oh girl, oh yeah, yeah
Listen, baby

Praying for the sunshine
Standing out in the rain
Trying to forgive myself
For causing you pain

We used to have a sweet thing
With the sweetest girl around
It's hard to keep on going on
Knowing that I let you down

Bluebirds don't sing
Skies above are gray
What can I do?
I'm so lonely without you

Bring back your smile
Make my gray skies blue
Nothing compares to you

Since I lost you, girl
You know my head's been spinning 'round
Ever since I lost you, girl
You know my heart can't be found

Living life without you, girl
Ain't no sun up in my sky, no, no, no
Ever since I lost you, girl
I've been crying, crying, crying

Winter turns to springtime
Flowers bloom after rain
What if we tried starting out
All over again

I just can't be giving up
Your love without a fight, no, no, no
Girl, you know I still believe
That we can find the light

Look to the sun
Open up your heart
Love finds a way
Gonna see a brighter day

If you believe
Won't you take my hand
And give me another chance

Since I lost you, girl
You know my head's been spinning 'round
Ever since I lost you, girl
You know my heart it can't be found

Living life without you girl
Ain't no sun up in my sky, no, no, no
Ever since I lost you, girl
I've been crying, crying, crying

I want you back
Baby, take my hand
Let's give love another chance

Since I lost you, girl
You know my head's been spinning 'round
Ever since I lost you, girl
You know my heart it can't be found

Living life without you, girl
Ain't no sun up in my sky, no, no, no
Ever since I lost you, girl
I've been crying, crying, crying

Since I lost you, girl
You know my head's been spinning 'round
Ever since I lost you, girl
You know my heart it can't be found

Living life without you, girl
Ain't no sun up in my sky, no, no, no
Ever since I lost you, girl
I've been crying, crying, crying

Ever since I lost you, girl
I've been crying, crying, crying
