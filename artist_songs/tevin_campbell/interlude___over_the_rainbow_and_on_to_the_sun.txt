Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
There's a land that I heard of once in a lullaby

Somewhere over the rainbow
Skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream 
Really do come true

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Way above the chimney top
That's where you'll find me

Somewhere over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow 
Why then, Oh why can I
