I Know Your Story He Stayed Out Late Last Nite And He Didn't Even Call. But 
Don't You Worry You Can Cry On My Shoulders I Just Wanna Hold Ya. Cause I'm The 
Oe That Cares For You And When You Lonely You Can Call On Me Girl.

[Chorus:]
Tell Me Where 
Where It Hurts You And I'll Kiss You There 
Tell Me Where 
Where It Hurts You And I'll Kiss You There

No Pain No Sorrow. I'll Be There For You When You Wake Up Tomorrow. So Don't 
Cry Don't Worry I'll Be There Quicker Than Quick And Faster Than A Hurry. Cause 
I'm The One That Cares For You Ang When You Get Lonely Baby You Can Call On Me 
Yeah 

[Chorus]

I Don't Think He's Gonna Call You Just Goes To Show You That He Don't Really 
Knoooooow Just Goes To Show That Doesn't Really Love You

Take My Hand Lead Me Lead Me 

Tell Me Where

I Want Ease The Pain
