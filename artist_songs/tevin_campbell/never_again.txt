Never again will
Never again will I fall in love
Never again will
Never again will I be the fool

You were my first true love
Since childhood I knew ya
You promised forever
And always together
No, it ain't right
No, it just ain't right

Never again will
Never again will I fall in love
Never again will
Never again will I be the fool

Never again will
Never again will I say I love you
Never again will
Never again will I fall into your arms

Trying to forget you
It's so hard for me to do
You loved me so easy
Then left me so lonely

I dream of you, I still do
Even though you were untrue
Pretending to love me
No, it ain't right
No, it just ain't right

Never again will
Never again will I fall in love
Never again will
Never again will I be the fool

Oh you told me you loved me
Just to get what you want
Then you left me in misery
Oh it just ain't right
Just ain't right

Never again will
Never again will I fall in love
Never again will
Never again will I be the fool

Never again will
Never again will I say I love you
