Can I hold you forever in my arms and not let go 
'Cause I really wanna be with you 
Say it's so till the end of time your love is all I know 
'Cause I really wanna be with you 
When I'm all alone 
I surround myself with every thought of you 
I love the things you do 

[Chorus:]
Your love gently lays me down 
Turns me all around 
Makes me love you once again 
One kiss, lips upon my face 
Nothing could erase 
Everything you are

All we have is love we share and that's enough for me 
'Cause I really wanna be with you 
In a thousand years 
if I lost your love 
I'd cry a thousand tears 
I'd cry a thousand tears 

[Chorus]

Just one look in you eyes makes me melt inside 
And I know when you're holding me close, it's for real 
You're the love that I've wanted to stand the test of time 
And I know in my heart, you will always be mine 

[Chorus]
