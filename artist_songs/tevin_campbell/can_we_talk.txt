[Verse 1:]
Last night I, I saw you standing, and I started, started pretending
That I knew you and you knew me too.And just like a woman you were
Too shy, but you weren't the only cause so was I.
And I dreamed of you ever since. Now I built up my confidence
Girl next next time you come my way I'll know just what to say

[Hook:]
Can we talk for a minute Girl I want to know your name
Can we talk for a minute Girl I want to know your name

[Verse 2:]
I started to write you letters, but I wanted to be more clever
I wanted to get down and sweet talk you.But just like a baby I could not talk
And I tried to come closer but could not walk. And I think of it every night
How I just could not get it right oh if we ever come close again,
I know what I'll say then

[Hook:]
Can we talk for a minute Girl I want to know your name
Can we talk for a minute Girl I want to know your name

[Break:]
Oh girl. One more chance with you again I will not let it go oh oh please
Give me just one more chance for love.

[Hook:]
Can we talk for a minute Girl I want to know your name
Can we talk for a minute Girl I want to know your name

Oh baby baby baby, come on talk to me baby come on and talk to me baby
[In background:] (Girl I want to know your name Can we talk for a minute)
See I wanna know I wanna know I wanna know your name. Now can we talk for a minute
Come on and talk to me baby come on baby come on baby, I said can we talk for a minute
Come on and talk to me baby. See I wanna know you better tell me your name baby.
I said talk to me for a minute come on and talk to me baby.
