[Verse 1:]
We Were Holding Hands
In The Park
We Had To Hurry Home Before It's Dark
I Can't Wait To See Your Smile Again
And I Love The Time We Spend
I Waited For The Break Of Day To Come
So I Could See Your Smile In The Sun
I Guess I Couldn't Wait To Get To School
To See Your Pretty Face
I've Got To Stay Cool
Break It Down

[Hook:]
Girl Don't Leave Me, Don't Leave Me
Oohh, The You Receive Me
Don't Take This As An Aggression
Girl I Learned My Lesson
Don't Leave Me, Ooohhh
The Natural Way You Receive Me
Don't Take This As An Aggression 
That's Why

[Chorus:]
I Just Want To Be Alone With You
And There's Nothing Else
I'd Rather Do
I Just Want The Chance I Had Again
Just Us Two, Til The End

[Verse 2:]
Now Just The Other Night
On The Phone
I Tried To Impress You With My Tone
I've Got To Be For Real
If You're My Friend
Or You'll Never Call Me Back Again

[Hook + Adlibs]
[Chorus: Fade Out]
