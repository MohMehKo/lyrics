[Chorus x2]
Baby we can work it out
Don't wanna fight
Let's make it right

Things ain't going smooth right now
But I know we can make it
We've got to get through this somehow
If we let it all fade away
We'll both be in pain
'Cause I know we still care

[Chorus x2]
Baby we can work it out
Don't wanna fight
Let's make it right

Even though we both made mistakes
Our love stayed strong
As if nothing was wrong
You're everything I've always dreamed of
I can't let you go baby you ought to know

We know we're in love
So why don't we just take the time to get it right
I'll always be here for you
I just need you by my side

[Chorus until end]
Baby we can work it out
Don't wanna fight
Let's make it right
