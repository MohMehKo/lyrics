Hello my love
I heard a kiss from you
Red magic satin playing near, too
All through the morning rain I gave
The sun doesn't shine
Rainbows and waterfalls run through my mind

In the garden, I see (ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
West purples shower bells and tea
Orange birds and river cousins (ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
Dressed in green

Pretty music I hear
So happy and loud (ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
Blue flowers echo
From a cherry cloud (ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)

Feel sunshine sparkle pink and blue
Playgrounds will laugh

If you try to ask, "is it cool?"
"Is it cool?"

If you arrive and don't see me
I'm gonna be with my baby
I am free flying in her arms
Over the sea...

Stained window yellow candy screen
See speakers of kite (ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
With velvet roses diggin' freedom flight (ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)

A present from you (ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
Strawberry letter 22
The music plays I sit in for a few (ah, ah, ah, ah...)

(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh...)

(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)

A present from you (ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
Strawberry letter 22
The music plays I sit in for a few (ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
