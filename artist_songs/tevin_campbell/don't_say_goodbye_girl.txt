[VERSE 1:]
Baby don't stand there in the doorway
With all your bags ready to go
Baby sit down let's talk it over
Oh I need to know

What do you think you're gonna find?
(A man who treats you sweeter?)
What are you looking for?
(A place where grass grows greener)
The world is cold out there
(I'm the one who really cares)

[CHORUS:]
Don't say goodbye girl
Take a look inside and read my mind girl
Everything I do, I do for you
Don't leave me crying (crying)

[VERSE 2:]
Maybe my crime is caring 'bout you
Wanting you close by my side
Maybe you need some space around you
Some room to fly

Don't ever think I'll hold you back
(My love will lift you higher)

And when you call my name
(I'll be there right beside you)
Together we'll get by
(Give this love another try)

[CHORUS x2]
