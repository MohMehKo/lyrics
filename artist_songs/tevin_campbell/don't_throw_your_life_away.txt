Hmmmm...
Don't throw your life away
Think about tomorrow
And all of the things 
A new day brings
Think about the joy you feel 
To wake up in the morning
You see it's all the same
The sun and the rain
So don't throw your life away... (don't throw your life away)

We live in world full of trouble
But that doesn't mean you can't make it on your own
Take pride in all the things 
You have achieved in life
And don't you look down on
On yourself (oh-no)

The way of the world,so cold I know
You have the right (yes you do)
To live and fight
But that doesn't mean 
When times get hard 
You should just up and walk away
Reality is here to stay yes it is
Don't throw your life away... (don't throw your life away)

We live in a world full of promise
Te sun shine upon us 
and dreams can come true for me and you

Don't give-up believing no,no,no,no
In yourself
To live is your pride yes it is and you know
Don't give-up the fight
Don't throw your life away,
Don't throw it away,no 
Don't throw your life...
A-way
