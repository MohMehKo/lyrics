You look beautiful
As usual
Kind of like the day that we met
I would have never known
When you said hello
You would cause the damage you did
And I still wear the foot prints
That you left upon my heart
From the day that you walked out of my world
And I still catch myself looking
Out the window for your car
I know you'd probably think that I'd be over it
But baby I don't think that I will ever be

Cause I never had a fear of heights
'til you let me down
So you can find me right where you left me
Cause loving you has taught me that I'm safer on the ground
Believed I could fly
But it's over now
So you can find me right where you left me
Cause loving you has taught me that I'm safer on the ground

I tell myself I'm fine
And that I'm gonna be alright
And I believe it for a minute or two
But then our song comes on
I halfway smile because I still hear you singing off tune
I guess I still wear the foot prints
That you left upon my heart
From the day that you walked out of my world
And I still catch myself looking
Out the window for your car
I know you'd probably think that I'd be over it
But baby I don't think that I will ever be

Cause I never had a fear of heights
'til you let me down
So you can find me right where you left me
Cause loving you has taught me that I'm safer on the ground
Believed I could fly
But it's over now
So you can find me right where you left me
Cause loving you has taught me that I'm safer on the ground

Safer on the ground

Cause loving you has taught me that I'm safer on the ground

But I know now, I'm safer on the ground

Ahh yeah, safer on the ground

Oh yeah, the ground

I believed I could fly 'til you let me down

I'm safer on the ground...
