[Verse 1:]
Brown Eyed Girl Come Walk With Me.
Brown Eyed Girl Come Talk With Me.
I Wanna Do All The Things In Love A Man Should Do.
All The Little Things You Want Me To.
Brown Eyed Girl
Brown Eyed Girl.

[Verse 2:]
Brown Eyed Girl Now Do You Know?
Brown Eyed Girl That I Love You So?
My Whole Life Through I've Been Waiting For A Girl Like You
Someone I Can Give Sweet Kisses To
Brown Eyed Girl
Brown Eyed Girl

[Hook:]
If You Leave Me I'll Go Crazy
Cause I Wanna Be Just Where You Are, Baby
And I Have Prayed We'll Stay Together
Till Forever
Until Forever Baby (Yeah)
