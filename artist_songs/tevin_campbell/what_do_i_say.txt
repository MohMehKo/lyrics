[Verse 1:]
Girl We've Been The Best Of Friends
I Never Want That Feeling To End
But You've Got To Know What's Been On My Mind Cause Iâve Been Holding Back Baby 
For The Longest Time
Every Night I Lie Alone In My Bed
Pictures Of Loving You Running Round My Head
Now Baby It's Time To Let You Know
That I Want You 
That I Need You 
And I Never Wanna Let You Go

[Chorus:]
What Do I Say
What Do I Do
Tell Me Baby Just To Get Next To You
What Do I Say
What Do I Do
Tell Me Baby Just To Get Next To You
What Do I Say

[Verse 2:]
Maybe You'll Turn And Walk Away
That's A Chance That I've Got To Take
Said Iâve Got To Know Do You Want Me To
Cause I Won't Ever Be Free Baby Till I Know The Truth
We Always Talk About The Good Times That We Had

But Girl Tonight Let's Talk About What Lies Ahead
Cause Baby When I Look Into Your Eyes
I Wanna Touch You
I Wanna Hug 
I Wanna Love You For The Rest Of My Life Baby

What Do I Say
What Do I Do
Tell Me Baby Just To Get Next To You
I Wanna Know What Do I Say
What Do I Do Girl
Tell Me Baby Just To Get Next To You
What Do I Say

[Hook:]
Every Night I Lie Alone In My Bed
Pictures Of Me Lovin You Running Round And Round And Round My Head
And Baby When I Look Into Your Eyes
I Wanna Touch You
I Wanna Hug You
I Wanna Love You For The Rest Of My Life 

What Do I Say
What Do I Do Baby
Tell Me Baby Tell Me Baby Just To Get Next To You Yeah
What Do I Say
What Do I Do
Tell Me Baby Just To Get Next To You
Oooh Baby What Do I Say

What Do I Say
