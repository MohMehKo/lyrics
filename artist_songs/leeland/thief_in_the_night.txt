Great is Your love and Your faithfulness
It's Your faithfulness that carries me
Many times I've run away
Forsook Your love and all Your grace
Still You call out my name
Yeah, You still care that I be saved

So I'll sing the glories of Your name
Your awesomeness I will proclaim
Until You come, until You come and... 

Take Your bride away 
Like a thief in the night
Like a thief in the night 
You'll take us away
There is no one that can fill this void 
Like You fill this void in my heart
My life is just a human one 
But You pick me up and call me son
Speak, Lord, I am listening 
Yes, Your child will serve faithfully

Like a thief in the night
