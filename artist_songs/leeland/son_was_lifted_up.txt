In my sorrows the depths of my despair
Under burdens that only You could bear
When I had all but given up, I saw Love

In the shadows blinded and afraid
With the debt that only You could pay
In the darkness broken and undone
I saw Love

When the Son was lifted up I felt new breath inside my lungs
When the Son was lifted up I saw my shame where He was hung
When the Son was lifted up I heard His voice crying “It’s Done!”
I saw Love    

Stripped and beaten, nailed upon a tree
In my place, He drank the cup for me
Flowing down, the water and the blood
I saw Love

When the Son was lifted up I felt new breath inside my lungs
When the Son was lifted up I saw my shame where He was hung
When the Son was lifted up I heard His voice crying “It’s Done!”
I saw Love      

When the Son was lifted up I saw the stone was rolled away
And the chains that held my heart He left inside that empty grave
When the Son was lifted up I looked upon my Savior’s face
I saw Love, I saw Love    

King of Love
You have won my heart
King of Love
You have won my heart
King of Love
You have won my heart
King of Love
You have won my heart

When the Son was lifted up I saw the stone was rolled away
And the chains that held my heart He left inside that empty grave
When the Son was lifted up I looked upon my Savior’s face
I saw Love, I saw Love...
