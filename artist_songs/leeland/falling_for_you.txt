A childlike love I had 
When we first began
We ran and I fell behind 
I've been stuck here all this time
You waited like a lover 
Who couldn't let go of his bride
I turned my back away from You 
Didn't shed a tear or cry

But I'm falling for You now 
I'm coming back to the place where we parted
It's for real this time
So I'll be here waiting where we started

My feet were bruised
I tried but I couldn't fill Your shoes
I went my way 
I bought the lie that I was all grown up 
Didn't need You in my life
The winter left me cold and frozen 
Looking for the truth 
But searching for the sun 
I found the place where I met You

It feels so good 
To be in Your arms
You never left me 
I just chose to stay behind
I want to thank You for Your love 
That gives me freedom
To run back, to come back
