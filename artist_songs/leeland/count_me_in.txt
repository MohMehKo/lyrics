You gave all You had
I didn't choose You 
You chose me first
Even when I turned my back
You still gave Your love
It's the only thing I want to have

No greater gift than a man to lay down his life
How could I miss this?
I'm not about to pass it up

Count me in 
I'm amazed this love is for me, Lord
Count me in 
I'm amazed this love is for me, Lord

I'm looking at these plans You have
For me they're plans of hope and peace
Much bigger than the ones I have
I tried to follow mine 
I was going nowhere fast
Your love makes me like David with a stone and sling
Nothing else could bring my life so much meaning

I can't believe it
I can't believe it
I can't believe it

Count me In 
Come on, You can count me in, yeah
You can count me in
You can count me in

Come on 
Come on 
Come on
