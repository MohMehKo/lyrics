First comes salvation 
Then comes obsession
Fire starts with a flicker 
And it consumes me 
Suddenly I feel I can follow You blindly 
Because You've covered my eyes with love
You've given me more than enough 
You've given me more than enough

Hide away in Your arms of grace
Living life the way 
That You want me to
Don't go away 
Please be here to stay
Forever and always 
It's just me and You 
Me and You, my Lord

Mighty King, everlasting God 
Never-ending flood, The Solid Rock
My love, my life, my all 
Your heart becomes my heartbeat and
You've given me more than enough 
You've given me more than enough

You've given me more than enough 
Answer to the questions in the world
You are more than enough 
You're the answer 
You're the answer

And You've given me more than enough
Hide away in Your arms of grace
Living life the way 
That You want me to
And don't You go away 
Please be here to stay
Forever and always 
It's just me and You 
Me and You, my Lord
