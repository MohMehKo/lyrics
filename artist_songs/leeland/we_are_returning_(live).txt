We are returning to Jesus
You are the way and the truth
Leaving behind every idol
We are returning to you

We are returning to fullness
You are our breath and our life
Trusting in all of your goodness
Forever we're hidden in Christ

For our hearts are yours
We are filled with fire
We are not ashamed
You are our desire
With our eyes on you
We are running to
Everything you are

We are returning to Jesus
You are our breath and our life
Trusting in all of your goodness
Forever weâ€™re hidden in Christ

We are returning to freedom
Living in your victory
Held in the power of your hands
Yours for eternity
