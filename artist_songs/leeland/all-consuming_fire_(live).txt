Help my restless heart
That's prone to roam and
Wander in the dark
Let your kindness draw me near
Keep me here

Teach me how to trust
Laid out on the altar of your love
Let your mercy draw me near
Keep me here

For I know I was created
To be loved and overtaken

All consuming fire
Oh God you are an all consuming fire
Set me ablaze
In your presence I'm changed

Keep me in the flame
That purifies 'til only you remain
Set me ablaze
In your presence I'm changed

You make all things new
With every breath I breathe inside of you
A song of joy begins to rise
I come alive

For I know I was created
To be loved and overtaken

All consuming fire
Oh God you are an all consuming fire
Set me ablaze
In your presence I'm changed

Keep me in the flame
That purifies 'til only you remain
Set me ablaze
In your presence I'm changed

For I know I was created
To be loved and overtaken
For I know I was created
To be loved and overtaken
For I know I was created
To be loved and overtaken

All consuming fire
Oh God you are an all consuming fire
Set me ablaze
In your presence I'm changed

Keep me in the flame
That purifies 'til only you remain
Set me ablaze
In your presence I'm changed
