Here underneath
You're covering
Inside your wings
I, I am renewed
By grace and truth
I'll follow you,
My Lord for
I have, I have, I have fallen in love

You are all I'm living and breathing for
Every day, every night I have fallen in love
I'm giving You my hopes and dreams, everything, 
all my time for You are mine
I have fallen in love

You are, You are, You are
You're the King of my heart, my heart
I have fallen in love

Come, have Your way
Love invade,
every single space,
In my heart for
I have, I have, I have fallen in love

You are all I'm living and breathing for
Every day, every night I have fallen in love
I'm giving you my hopes and dreams, everything
All my time for you are mine
I have fallen in love

You are, You are, You are
You're the King of my heart, my heart
I have fallen in love

All my future, my hope
All my heart and my heart and my soul
All that I need to know
Is nothing less that you love me

All my future, my hope
All my heart and my heart and my soul
All that I need to know
Is nothing less that you love me
nothing less that you love me

I have, I have, I have fallen in love
I have, I have, I have fallen in love

You are all I'm living and breathing for
Every day, every night I have fallen in love
I'm giving you my hopes and dreams, everything
All my time for You are mine
I have fallen in love

You are, You are, You are
You're the King of my heart, my heart
I have fallen in love

You're the King of my heart, my heart, my heart
