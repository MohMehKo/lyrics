You are my shelter from the hurricane
You are my rock, you are my shade
Never changing, always the same
God, refresh me

When my burdens are breaking down
And the enemies cries shake the ground
I hear your voice pierce the sound
Saying I am with you

So I lift my hands to you
I lift my heart to you
Refresh me, God, refresh me

I raise my weakness high
In it you're glorified
Refresh me, God, refresh me

Let the river flow down from your throne
Let it wash me now and make me whole
Lord, fill my heart, flood my soul
Refresh me, God, refresh me

I loose my hands take control
God let your purposes unfold
There's a greater story to be told
Refresh me, God, refresh me
