Strengthen the feeble
The weak and fallen.
Say to the fearful ones
"You're not forgotten"
Sing to the weary
Speak for the silent with no voice
The lord is coming now to save
The lord is coming now to save

You are God with us
You are Emmanuel
Never leave and never forsaken
You are Emmanuel

Shout for his glory
Tell of his wonders
Dance to the rhythms of his grace
Ours sins forgiven
Now death is broken by the cross
Our lord is risen from the grave
Our lord is risen from the grave

You are God with us
You are Emmanuel
Never leave and never forsaken
You are Emmanuel

We live for you
We hold to your promise
We wait for you
We hold to your promise
We wait for you
We hold to your promise
We wait for you
We hold to your promise

Never leave and never forsaken
You are Emmanuel

You are God with us
You are Emmanuel
Never leave and never forsaken
You are Emmanuel
