May our praise be all that You can hear
From our lives to Your ears, Father

Wondrous King, You are clothed in mystery
Your hands set people free, Father
All pain is over as Your love draws us closer
Your grace goes on forever
So we sing
So we sing

Every heart should feel
The depth of Your mercy
How beautiful is Your healing, Father
And teach us, Lord, to attract You even more
We just want to be where You are 
Be where you are

This is our love song to You
Father, our love song to You

We never deserved this never-ending peace
You're a God who protects the weak
So we sing 
So we sing
