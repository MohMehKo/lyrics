We are saved in a world that's lost
All our hope rests in Your Cross
God of strength, our weakness shows
We need You 
We need You, Lord

Father, enter this temple
Come touch Your people
We need to be where You are
And children living as their Father
Washed in pure water
We need to be like You are

We are searching for Your presence
We are knocking on Your door
Let Your wings cover us with promise
For communion
For communion

To be like You are
To be where You are
Father, come touch Your people

To be where You are 
To be like You are
