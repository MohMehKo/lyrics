I can't get enough
No I can't get enough
Of Your amazing love
I can't get enough

I can't walk away
No I can't walk away
From where I've seen Your face
And I can't walk away

And I just wanna be where You are
I just wanna be near Your heart
There is nothing like Your love
There is nothing like Your love

Jesus I love You...

With all the angels singing
Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy
Jesus I love You
Jesus I love You
...
