Ya, I dream about tomorrow
A thousand times a day
Though I beg and borrow
Just to get my way, and I have
I've been waiting for so long

Oh, you little Missy

How the way you shake your thing
You got me spun around inside
I want you to wear my ring, my ring
I want you to wear my ring

But I don't wanna see you cry
Like you did that night

Don't know how it happened
How they got their hooks in you
Didn't know the darkness would keep
The light from coming through, but it has
Now I'm a broken man, yeah

Hospitals and diagrams
It's a godless world you know
My little flowers wilted

But she still bloom like a rose, my dear
You're my Irish rose

So take your medicine, sweet rose
And you'll never be alone
I'll be waiting on the rock of ages
Calling your name, rose
My rose, my dear

Lovers they have come before
And they will come again
No one's ever loved before
The way that I've loved them
Ever, ever, forever, you're my Irish rose
You're my Irish rose

Yeah, our bodies they were shaking

Like our souls were set aflame
The tears could not come fast enough
I'll never be the same, but sometimes
You just gotta let it out

So take your medicine, sweet rose
And you'll never be alone
I'll be waiting on the rock of ages
Calling your name, rose

My rose, my dear
My rose, rose, rose, rose
Rose, rose, rose, rose, yeah
Rose, my rose
