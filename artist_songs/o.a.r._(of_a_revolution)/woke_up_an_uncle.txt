Well I woke up an uncle, but I went to bed a fool
Oh my Ruby red you lay down next to me and I fell for you
Oh you came into my day on a morning just so bliss
Oh my Ruby red, you knocked me down
But I look up yours and your little baby kiss

But I spent my days just looking for happiness
Oh I waited so long my ruby red to come in this world
And I thought that the telephone was never gonna ring
Oh they brought you to my life, oh my little Ruby red my bed

Oh it seems life is such a blessing
Well I was without it for so long
Oh my brother, you promised me everything
When you told me that Ruby red was coming along
So I waited, oh I waited, for nine months at a time
And that day the telephone rang I nearly lost my mind
Oh my spring breeze, oh she told me that Ruby was on the way
And I must say when I woke up today, heard you're in my world
I love my Ruby red

And I woke up an uncle, I went a fool
