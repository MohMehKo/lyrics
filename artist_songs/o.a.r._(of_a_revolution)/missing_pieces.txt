i woke up with a headache from the night before
cause sometimes i drink
i spent the night with my head in a toliet bowl
it's where i like to think
i say cause i don't want no one to take a piece of my heart
i hate to lose all those itty-bitty pieces from my heart
la-la-la-ah-eh-oh

you ever spent all night thinking about your life
well i suggest you try
well it's something that you're gonna want to do with a knife
cause i tend to cry

say cause i don't want no one to take a piece of my heart
i hate to lose all those itty-bitty pieces from my heart
la-la-la-ah-eh-oh

you ever spent all day thinking about the night
it's something that you do
when you're thinking way too much, you're out of sight
what you gonna do

i say cause i don't want no one to take a piece of my heart
i hate to lose all those itty-bitty pieces from my heart
la-la-la-ah-eh-oh
yeah yeah you
