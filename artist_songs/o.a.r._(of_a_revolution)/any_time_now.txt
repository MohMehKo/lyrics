Any time now I'm gonna wake up and see the day.
Any time now I'm gonna wake up and find my way.
And by that time now, you're gonna never ever never ever hear me say, 
"That was the longest damn day."

Do you ever truly feel that it's a waste of time to live a day?
I mean, deep inside have you convinced yourself there's much more to get out of the way?
But, for me it's that last baby moment before I wake.
It bless my soul, caress my heart, leave me wishing for a brighter day.

Any time now I'm gonna wake up and see the day.
Any time now I'm gonna wake up and find my way.
And by that time now, you're gonna never ever never ever hear me say, "That was the longest
damn day."

Do you ever truly dream and stay inside them before you wake?
I mean, deep inside can you relax the mind and grab the minute like the last one to save?
Well, for me it's that last baby moment before I rise.
It fills me with wonder, it bless my soul, catch the dream before I open my eyes.

Any time now I'm gonna wake up and see the day.
Any time now I'm gonna wake up and find my way.
And by that time now, you're gonna never ever never ever hear me say, 
"That was the longest damn day."

One, two, three more days will never be enough for me.
One, two, three more lifetimes will bless my sould for my eyes can see
That I can wake up if I want to.
But I'll just stay inside of my mind.
One, two, three more days will never be enough for me.
One, two, three more lifetimes will bless my mind for my soul is free.

Any time now I'm gonna wake up and see the day.
Any time now I'm gonna wake up and find my way.
