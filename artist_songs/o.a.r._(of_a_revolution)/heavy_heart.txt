Hello, hello, hello
It’s been a long damn time since I told you so
Like every minute that we had is gone
Everything you knew about me is already wrong

I don’t plan on leaving so quickly
I still got songs to sing

Whoa, got a heavy heart, been mistreated
I’ll be playing for the rest of my days
Don’t you act like you ain’t looking back

‘Cause if you don’t know what street got you home
And it ain’t clear what beat brought you here
You’re never meant to do it at all
No, you’re never meant to do it at all

I know it’s alright, I think it’s alright
As a matter of a fact, never felt so good
I can’t ignore all the days from before
I tried to once – brought me to tears

I don’t plan on leaving you that quickly
No, I’m nowhere near the door

Whoa, got a heavy heart, been mistreated
I’ll be paying for the rest of my days
And this heart don’t need more bleeding
If you knew it you’d be out of my way

The best part of being misguided
Is on the wrong side of the tracks
Don’t you act like you ain’t looking back

Well, if you don’t know what street got you here
And it ain’t quite clear what beat brought you here
You’re never meant to do it at all
I guess the journey was the point of it all

Everything has tasted better since I met you
But now it’s time to run

Whoa, got a heavy heart, been mistreated
I’ll be paying for the rest of my days
And this heart don’t need more bleeding
If you knew it you’d get out of my way

Yeah, got a heavy heart, been misguided
I think I walked through the wrong damn door
Don’t you act like you’re ain’t coming back

If you don’t know which street got you home
And it ain’t quite clear what beat brought you here
You were never meant to do it at all
No, you’re never meant to do it at all

Whoa, oh, whoa, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, oh no
No, no, no, no, no

This pain is driving me
Out of my way, oh yeah
This pain, this pain is driving me, yeah
This pain is driving me, oh, yeah, yeah
