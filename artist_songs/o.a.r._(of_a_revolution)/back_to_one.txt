I see you there,
but you don't look right
You got a ten mile stare,
in your eyes tonight
Time ain't fair,
like it used to be

We're all dressed up,
nowhere to go
We lost our way,
about halfway home
And we hurt the ones
who get too close

Don't look back,
you'll never find your way
There's a million different people
who break the same way
When everything has come undone,
we got to bring it back to one
Back to one
We're all caught up
in what used to be
A grounded love,
and some memories
Why do I hurt the ones
who get close to me?
Darling, are you listening?

Don't look back,
you'll never find your way
There's a million different people
who break the same way
Forget about the things we've done,
and bring it back to one
More night,
another's on the way
We're all a little different,
but break the same way
When everything becomes undone,
bring it back to one
Bring it back to one more night
Bring it back to one
Let's bring it back to one
Bring it back to one
It's just beyond my reach
So bring me back to one

I know forever always asks so much,
don't you let it scare you
Don't you lose your touch
And when your still waters start to run,
bring it back to one

One more night,
another's on the way
We're all a little different,
but break the same way
When everything becomes un-
everything becomes un-
Don't look back
We'll never find the way
A million different people will break
the same way
When everything becomes undone,
bring it back to one
