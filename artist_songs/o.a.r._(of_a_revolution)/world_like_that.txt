I judge a day by how far the shades can come down
How much more of the light she wants to see
When the morning shows its head
I’d understand if I was high
But maybe I’ve been low these days
So we talked in the dark until there’s nothing on her mind

We say “It’s so strange”
These days are so strange
(So strange…)

You’re awake to the window
Draw your heart on frozen glass
Here I am in our bed
Looking after recent past
And I don’t know if it works
All I hear is a whisper talking at work
Surrender to me here and now
I want to spend

These days… so strange
These days…

We shout for seasons follow the lines
Don’t ask for the reasons we just waste the time
I don’t wanna live in a world like that
I don’t wanna live in a world like that
Where the beat and the rhythm of somebody’s drum
Is making you ask them permission to run
I don’t wanna live in a world like that
I don’t wanna live in a world like that

It’s okay - I’m alright
Just wanna be in my life
Would you come to bring back those [?]
I’m laying down my heart

So we beat to our own drummer in the sun
We ask for nobody’s permission to run
I just wanna live in a world like that
And I’m gonna live in a world like that

When you beat to your own drummer in the sun
You break from the darkness
Tell everyone

I don’t wanna live in a world like that
I don’t wanna live in a world like that (no, no…)
I don’t wanna live in a world like that
