There's an emptiness between us
Been filling up for days
It's heavy on my mind
Fighting all the time
We'll never find our way
You swore you would remember
What a shame you had to lie
Now this battle that you're in
Is underneath your skin
And the fight is in your eyes

But one day you'll fall down
And there won't be anyone
To pick you up again
One day you'll fall down 
And there won't be anyone

You know this ain't pretend now
I'd fix it if I could
So pack up all your things
Drop off all your rings
Things have changed for good
And you swore you would protect me
And you swore you would not lie
Now the battle that we're in
Is in between locked doors
And the fight is in our eyes

But one day you'll fall down
And there won't be anyone
To pick you up again
One day you'll fall down 
And there won't be anyone

All these lonely days
Lead to lonely nights
And alone at night I sleep
Trapped inside what became my life
And it's all because of me

And one day you'll fall down
And there won't be anyone
To pick you up again
One day you'll fall down 
And there won't be anyone anywhere
Now one day you'll fall down
And there won't be anyone
To pick you up again
One day you'll fall down 
And there won't be anyone
And one day you'll fall down
And there won't be anyone
To pick you up again
One day you'll fall down 
And there won't be anyone
To pick you up again
To pick you up again
