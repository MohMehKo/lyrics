Easy operator on the side of the road
A million dollar man in a lower class home
Chopping trees for needs of a spiritual kind
Forever getting lower while he tried to be high
He was an early morning, evil eyeing fool from afar
He's barely getting over forget getting by
But now it's all the same for Billy Kinkaid
If he had to do it over, he would do it the same

Living in the end
He was living in the end

Polly and her beauty wasn't pretty at all
She concentrated fully on the shine of the stars
She's pinching pennies just to pinch em
She'd never let go and they always
Dominated everything that she owned
She was a queen which means there wasn't nothing to wear
And Daddy gave her everything
She ever gon' need
But now it's all the same for Polly the Vain
If she had to do it over, she would do it the same

She was living in the end
Yeah living in the end

Are you alright, Darlin', alright now?
You'll never be, never be the same
Are you alright Darlin', alright now?
Don't you ever wanna, ever wanna see some change?

Didn't see it coming as the tale of his life
And Easy Operator laid to rest in the night
He had to take the hit
It's always the same
And that's the way she's seen killing Billy Kinkaid
That's the way she's seen killing Billy Kinkaid

Are you alright, Darlin', alright now?
You'll never be, never be the same
Are you alright Darlin', alright now?
Don't you ever wanna, ever wanna see some change?
Are you alright, Darlin', alright now?
You'll never be, never be the same
Are you alright Darlin', alright now?
Don't you ever wanna, ever wanna see some change?

They were living in the end
That's just living in the end
