Yeah, they're saying she's a real conversation piece
Oh, Madonna never had a life of ease
Deserving every minute that she get at peace
I wanna be yours, do you wanna be mine?

Yeah, you're that rare combination
Beauty with the strengths of a nation
I believe, do you believe?
That we could get together underneath the weather let's ride

I only wanna love you, take you to the mountain
Live a life higher than the world below
I only wanna love you, take you to the water
Tell you how I'm never gonna let you go
I only wanna love you, I only wanna love you
I only wanna love you, I only wanna love you

It's like that falling to the spring
Let the phone ring
Two in the mornin' get money on the door
Everything can change, I don't know what for

It's lovely in the city you knew
Identity got lost in the zoo
Up to Queens, heard about the dreams
Lay there for a minute like a couple of fiends

I only wanna love you, take you to the mountain
Live a life higher than the world below
I only wanna love you, take you to the water
Tell you how I'm never gonna let you go
I only wanna love you, I only wanna love you
I only wanna love you, I only wanna love you
I only wanna love you

Easy easy come, easy easy go
You're the only one I'll ever live for
Easy easy come, yeah easy go
Now, she's the only one I'll ever love

The sun ran away, the morning came to play
It's the only one I'll ever live for
Mountains get me high, but the river make me low
It's the only one I'll ever know

Easy easy come, easy easy go
She's the only one I'll ever live for
Easy easy come, yeah easy go
Yeah, she's the only one I'll ever love
I only wanna love you

I only wanna love you, take you to the mountain
Live a life higher than the world below
I only wanna love you, take you to the water
Show you how I'm gonna make the river go
I only wanna love you, I only wanna love you
I only wanna love you, I only wanna love you
I only wanna love you
I only wanna love you
