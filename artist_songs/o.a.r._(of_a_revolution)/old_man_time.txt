I have been falling again for so long, for so long.
I've been off that track.  There's a mystery in that and it's strong.
But once more I'm asking for your time.
A few between the two then I'm gone.
I don't think I'll be coming back.
I'm not coming back.
It seems to me, You & me, aren't where we're supposed to be.
We're lost somewhere on the seventh sea.
I found Time, at least I thought I did.
You slipped away, yeah you slipped my grip.
So this day that I stood my ground, wait for 
Old Man Time.

Once again a day's flown by.
On a journey roads got hot.
So hot, I'm walking around unclothed.
Heated to the bone I'm bare-boned.
Bare-boned I'm thrown, dethroned again.
I missed the man by a minute again.
But next time gonna have my shot.
Gonna see me with Time.

It seems to me, you & me, aren't where we're supposed to be.
We're lost somewhere on an endless sea.
I found Time, at least I thought I did.
You slipped away, yeah you slipped my grip.
So this day that I stood my ground
You saw me lost but forget it I'm found.
Right here at the Black Rock lay your cards down.
Mr. Old Man Time.

Oh, I tracked you down old man.
When I walk at night I see you and I follow you old man.
But the Black Rock is never too far away.
I'm dying just to hear what you say.
So next time I'll be comin' round,
Gonna see me with Time.

It seems to me, you and me, where we're supposed to be.
We're lost somewhere on an endless sea.
I found Time, at least I thought I did.
You slipped away, yeah you slipped my grip.
So this day that I stood my ground
You think you lost me, but forget it I'm found.
So right here at the Black Rock lay your cards down Old Man Time.

You're not too far for me.
I've waited my life for just a minute to see.
