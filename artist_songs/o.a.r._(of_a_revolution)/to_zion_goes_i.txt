light of the candle, bright one's soul shined
woke up new morning feeling better than ever, fine
chest no hurt no more, something feel better
what's all the hate for, now something feel better
to zion goes i, to zion goes i, to zion goes i, to zion goes i

walk through the valley and i'll follow the stars 
i feel it so close now, it can't be that far
time some grow lonely, but time isn't done
it's time to go home now, you're not on the run

to zion goes i, to zion goes i, to zion goes i, to zion goes i
to zion goes i, to zion goes i, to zion goes i, to zion goes i

one step forward and i crossed the line again
one step forward and i crossed the line again
standing on the edge of a civilization
mo one's around
standing on the edge of a civilization
and no one's around and i ain't heard a sound, yeah

the path is snowed over, the path lies ahead
soon we'll be down there, and nothing is said
there's no need to fear love, don't let love hide
conquer the mountains way down by the riverside

to zion goes i, to zion goes i, to zion goes i, to zion goes i
to zion goes i, to zion goes i, to zion goes i, to zion goes i
