i don't know nothing, i don't know a thing
but if i just keep on listening, together we'll sing
i've been walking for about a thousand years
and my feet are tired of crying all those painful tears
and my sight is going blind and my soul is way down low
but i haven't seen a thing, so that's all i can know

i said cause i don't know nothing, i don't know a thing
but if i just keep on listening, together we'll sing

i've been drinking to drown away my tears
and i'm sick of all the violence and i'm sick of all the fears
but i'm moving down the road, true i'm moving kind of slow
but i haven't heard a thing, so that's all i can know

said cause i don't know nothing, ya'll don't know a thing
but if we just keep on listening, together we'll sing

i don't think that it's going that good today
i can't take my eyes off of the rain
and everybody's running away
well i don't think that it's going that good today
can't take my eyes off of the rain
and everybody's running away
i ran away to the top of the world today

i've been crying and losing lots of sleep
cause the roads are getting longer
winter snows come kinda deep
but i still will move along
and i still can feel the sun
and i see or hear a thing
and i'll break into a run

said cause i don't know nothing, ya'll don't know a thing
but if we just keep on listening, together we'll sing

i don't think that it's going that good today
i can't take my eyes off of the rain
and everybody's going insane
well i don't think that it's going that good today
i can't take my eyes off of the rain
everybody's running away
i ran away to the top of the world today
i ran away to the top of the world today
ran away top of the world today
