Going on forever was never the plan
I'm just passing minutes that I got in my hands
Counting down the seconds till my heart it can rest
Then something started burning in the back of my chest

All I ever asked for was a shot at this life
And when you gave it to me
Must have started a fire, burning for you

Fire, come on in and light up my heart
Come on, let it burn through my soul
Fire, come on turn the heat up
Pick your feet up and let it burn

I know you got my back, hope I don't let you down
But something 'bout these alleyways that turns me around
Could have been the night in a fight with the dark
Maybe I'm a broken heart in battery park

And all I ever asked for was a good place to start
When you showed it to me
Must have lit up a spark, burning for you

Fire, come on in and light up my heart
Come on in and burn through my soul
Fire, come on turn the heat up
Pick your feet up, singing oh, oh, oh
Fire is burning inside every one of us
Every one of us all

I wish I knew that it was all so real
But it was just too soon

Oh, I know something's gotta give
I feel it inside burning me out, the fire is real
Oh, you know something's gotta give
So bring down your walls, down with 'em all, let 'em fall

And after they all started to fall, the fire was real
And after we all came to a crawl, the fire was real
Looking away won't change the day, fire is real
Inside us all, thousand feet tall, fire is, yeah, fire

Fire, come on in and light up my heart
Come on in and burn through my soul
Fire, come on turn the heat up
Pick your feet up, singing oh, oh, oh

Fire is burning inside every one of us all, oh, oh
Fire is burning inside every one of us
Every one of us all
