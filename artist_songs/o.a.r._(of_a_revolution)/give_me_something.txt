Woke up early to that phone call
It's like I knew it was coming
But you're never quite ready at all

Deep breath, I hold it in
Slow down but tell me quick
I could tell you're almost gone

It's gonna happen, arms are wide open
It's gonna happen tonight

So give me something, give me some
Give me something to remember
When I'm calling out your name

Give me something, give me some
Give me something to remember you
Before you fade away
I'll be calling out your name, hey
I'll be calling out your name, hey

Tell me all about your life
Spin the tales into the night
Nothing's better left to wonder, yeah

I can take it if you can
Wanna know how you became this man
Breaking down as your breath is running out

It's gonna happen, arms are wide open
It's got to happen tonight

So give me something, give me some
Give me something to remember
When I'm calling out your name

Give me something, give me some
Give me something to remember you
Before you fade away
I'll be calling out your name, hey
Same as I said it before, hey, hey

Sit down, tell me 'bout your past
Close your eyes, take me back
All I want to do is know you

So give me something, give me some
Give me something to remember
When I'm calling out your name

So give me something, give me some
Give me something to remember you
Before you fade away
I'll be calling out your name, hey
I'll be calling out your name, hey

Calling out your name, hey
I'll be living out your name

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah

Give me something more if you could
Would you tell me more?
Tell me stories
Just tell me more, more, more
Would you tell me more?

If I swore, would you tell me more?
Would you tell me more about you?
If I came to you, would you tell me more about you?
Tell me more
