I'm not quite sure how I got here.
A minute passed and I'm on my feet.
I never knew life could taste so good.
I need a little minute, just a moment to breathe.
No matter where I go, no matter who I see
Well I'm remind of my earlier days.
No matter where I roll, no matter what I know
Well I'm reminded of my earlier ways.
But now I keep asking myself.

Wouldn't it be the best damn day if we all took time to breathe?
Just one stolen paragraph in the book's written history.
Don't you sometimes wonder why people are afraid to smile?
Don't look down we're gonna come around and it always come to back, crack time eventually.
Just ascend with me.

I'm not quite sure when I woke up.
The night flew by as I lay asleep.
Who ever knew that life could feel so good?
I need another minute.
Just a moment to breathe.
No matter where I go, no matter who I see
Well I'm reminded of my ealier days.
No matter what I know, no matter where I roll
Well I'm reminded of my earlier ways.
But now I keep asking myself.
Wouldn't it be the best damn day if we all took time to breathe?
Just one stolen paragraph in the book's written history.
Don't you sometimes wonder why people are afraid to smile?
Don't look down we're gonna come around and it always come to back, crack of time eventually.

Wouldn't it be the best damn day?
Wouldn't it be a wonderful day?
Wouldn't it be a glorious day?
If we all took time to smile, made just a minute for you and me.
Wouldn't it be the best damn day? [repeat 4x]
