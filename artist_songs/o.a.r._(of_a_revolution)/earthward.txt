love was never enough throughout time, yet some give it up
well, you kept me standing alone
if only i could have one dance i would move on my own
in tattered daydreams that slip through the night
i'm prince, king, warrior, and i'm doing things right
but every daydream leaves me awake all the night
if i was a bird, spread my wings, and take off and fly
yeah yeah yeah yeah
i had the swirl and ache from sprays of honeysuckle
that when they're gathered break will dew on the knuckle
i had small sweets but those seemed small when i was young
the petal of the rose was strung
yeah, na-na na-na

so in this dream i walk with my head held high
cause here i'll live forever and never die
i see my soul straight ahead with his eyes locked on mine
if i should wake right now, i'd rather be blind
and in these dreams with love, together we'd stand
i'm slipping, falling to earthward and i can't reach your hand
yeah yeah yeah yeah

i had the swirl and ache from sprays of honeysuckle
that when they're gathered break will dew on the knuckle
i had small sweets but those seemed small when i was young
the petal of the rose was strung
yeah, na-na na-na

my eyes open wide and i've lost myself
i'm laying here in my bed, there's nobody else
surrounded by questions, hate, and blood soaked war
i clasp my hands together and pray, ask what it's all for

it's easy for me to slip away and live on the air
if we'd all just let love live we could all meet there
but time has its way of saying it's time to move on
so off to my kingdom i go where i feel at home
yeah yeah yeah yeah

i had the swirl and ache from sprays of honeysuckle
that when they're gathered break will dew on the knuckle
i had small sweets but those seemed small when i was young
the petal of the rose was strung
yeah yeah yeah
