It's okay if you lock yourself up at the end of the day
And it's alright if you're gonna let us fade to nothing
You worked harder for nothing at all
Are you alright?
She asked me deep after dinner last night

Hold on and you've got to remember
Hold on and you've got to be strong
Hold on and you've got to remember
You've got to come back and you've got to be strong

Do you even hear me?
How far have you strayed from home?
Do you feel me or is it all gone?
Pick your pleasure; be sure that it's what you want
Are you alright?
She asked me deep after dinner last night

Hold on and you've got to remember
Hold on and you've got to be strong
Hold on and you've got to remember
You've got to come back and you've got to be strong
Hold on I know you remember
Right now, here you belong
Hold on man, you've got to be strong

Darling it won't be long
Sit with me, Darling it won't take long
But just believe in me
I'd never do you wrong
I was a million miles away just to live in my head
But I'm never going back to that place again
Now I'm all here with you

Hold on and you've got to remember
Hold on and you've got to be strong
Hold on and you've got to remember
You've got to come back and you've got to be strong
Hold on I know you remember
Hold on, with me you belong
Hold on man, its here you belong
With me you belong
With me you belong
