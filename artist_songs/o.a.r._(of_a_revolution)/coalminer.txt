Daddy was a coalminer.
He worked the pits all day.
In Rock Springs, Wyoming.
It was meant to be a stop for a day, became his home nothing more I can say.

Daddy was a part time farmer.
He worked the field for pay.
But he'd rather have new shoes for them horses.
But late one day, them horse run away.
Shouldn't have put the shoes on that way.

Too bad for daddy.
Such a shame he took it all.
So me and mom took the high road.
But it's not like we had a choice at all.

Daddy was a guitar player.
He'd play that joint all night.
Out back in the shack the six-string was his demon.
Maybe one day I could run away, join my dad in a band to play.

Now it's just me and mom here.
Oh, we sit alone all night.
But if you listen close you can hear my daddy playing.
It was meant to be a stop for a day, left us here, now he's on his way.

Too bad for daddy.
Such a shame he took it all.
So me and mom, we took the high road.
But it's not like we have a choice at all.
