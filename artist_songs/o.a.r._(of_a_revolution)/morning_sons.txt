I’m not the man, who left you waving
I’m not the one, who needs your saving
But if you try, maybe I could try too

It’s almost like, digging deeper
These same old hands, felt your fever
I’ve been to hell, I ain’t going back again
Until we break on fall??
Woah, woah

I’m not the man, saw you leaving
But here I stand, I’m still breathing
Now if you try, baby I will try too

Don’t say goodbye, I’ll see you later
A few more days, it’s almost over
You’ve been through hell, but I’ll be back for you

When the rain stopped pouring, wind started crawling
A lion in the streets
Break of the morning sons brought a warning
A lion in the streets
And the world was soaked in silence
There’s iron in my feet
Break of the morning sons brought the warning
A lion in, a lion in the streets
Woah, woah
Woah, woah

Then the rain stopped falling, wind began crawling
A lions in the streets
The break of the morning sons brought a warning
A lion in the streets
And the world got soaked in silence
There’s violence and deceit
Break of the morning sons brought a warning
A lion in, a lion in the streets
Woah, woah (yeah)
Woah, woah (yeah)

And then the rain stopped falling, wind began crawling
A lion in the streets
Break of the morning sons brought a warning
A lions in the street
And the world was soaked in silence
There’s iron in our feet
Break of the morning sons brought a warning
A lion in, a lion in the street
Woah, woah
Woah, woah
Yeah, yeah

And the world got soaked in silence
There’s iron in our feet
Break of the morning sons brought the warning
A lion in, a lion in the streets
