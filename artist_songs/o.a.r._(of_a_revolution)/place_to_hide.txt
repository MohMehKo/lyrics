I thought the rains would never come here
To our valley in the sun
Looking back on days of ease, oh, we would run
So young

And I didn’t see this coming
’Til it was right around the bend again

You and me could just be crazy
Time ain’t on our side and I need you badly
Of all the others, you had to have me
Now we’re running for our lives and I need you badly

She don’t like this feeling, it never let’s her go
She wants to be summer, too cold under the snow
He’s convinced there’s no reason to making her sick
He says treat me like a devil, heal that little girl

Who treats me like angel fell upon the world
But she don’t like the seasons, they out of her control
Oh no where can we go

You and me could just be crazy
Time ain’t on our side and I need you badly
Of all the others, you had to have me
Now we’re running for our lives and I need you badly

Yeah, I need you badly

To hell with tomorrow, it’s out of my hands
I’ll hold you up now when you too damn tired to stand
I don’t wanna be like you, you don’t wanna be like me
We just wanna run together through darkness we can breathe

You and me could just be crazy
Time ain’t on our side and I need you badly
Of all the others, you had to have me
Now we’re running for our lives, I need you she said

The rain is picking on me
The thing is, it always seemed to be
I went around the world but it’s you I need
Now we’re running for our lives and I need you badly

You and me could just be crazy
Time ain’t on our side and I need you badly
Of all the others, you had to have me
Running for our lives, but I need you she said

The rain is picking on me
The thing is, it always seemed to be
I went around the world but it’s you I need
One by one, yeah, this ain’t over till we done

Well I got an angel on my shoulder
The devil made me colder
The iron made me bolder
And all I want is life now

All I felt was pain here
All I got is love now
All you need is me
And all I need is you
