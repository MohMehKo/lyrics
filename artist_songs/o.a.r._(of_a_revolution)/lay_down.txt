There was time now it's far away
I didn't know you, but I knew your name
We would talk, I got nothing to say
But hear me now
You're like an angel that is just for me
Bless your heart, let your mind go free
And it's too loud on the Earth today
So let's go home and lay down

Lay down and rest here in my arms
Lay down the universe is ours

Catch a teardrop, bleed the heart
Masquerade in a world apart
From a mass that got more to lose I'm making a run
So blessed angel that is just for me
Catch the dream, there's a lot to see
But it's too loud on the Earth today
So let's go home and lay it down

Lay down and rest here in my arms
Lay down the universe is ours

I never seen a body move the way you do
Rocking steady and you know it too
You had to come down from Heaven above and tease the world
So listen good, cause I'm telling it straight
I don't got no more time to waste
I got a trip planned past the Sun
Taking you home

To lay down and rest here in my arms
Lay down the universe is ours

I bought a planet for you
I planned it for you, my dear
There's no one above you
I purchased a room with a view
And we can fly away to outer space
We'll be alone just us two
And you know it's all for you
All for you
All for you
