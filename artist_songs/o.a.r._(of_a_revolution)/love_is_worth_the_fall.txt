I can almost believe that you’re real
And its love in my heart I can feel
But there’s something between us 
I can’t seem to get through it all

[Chorus]
If I could only read your mind
I would know how to save you this time 
With love, love is worth the fall
If I could only save the day 
Here in your world I could stay
For love, love is worth the fall

Show me the way let me see
Into your soul let me breath
I will wait through the ages 
And watch you sleep straight through the night

[Chorus]
If I could only read your mind
I would know how to save you this time 
With love, love is worth the fall
If I could only save the day 
Here in your world I could stay
For love, love is worth the fall

Sleep, darling sleep 
Dream, darling dream
Hope in those dreams I’m here

[Chorus]
Yeah only read your mind
I would know how to save you this time 
With love, love is worth the fall
Yeah if I could only save the day 
Here in your world I would stay
For love, love is worth the fall

Love, love is worth the fall
I see you right there and you’re smiling
Only in your bed 
That’s my love
Its better learnt lesson when nothing is said

I lay down beside you here 
I do it for love, love is worth the fall
Love, love is worth the fall
(Its better learnt lesson when nothing is said)
Love, love is worth the fall
Love, love is worth it all
