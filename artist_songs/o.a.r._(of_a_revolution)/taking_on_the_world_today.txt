Am I coming on way too strong
If I scared you off, never meant nobody
Who had me from the first hello
Then oh, you really got me going
I’m working on a brighter day
I hope I don’t scare you away
Let me give you some free advice
Never listen to a word I say

Because I’m taking on the world today
You’re by my side it helps to be crazy
Taking on the world today
Hey hey
Hey hey

I might have showed up a little too late
But my car broke down on the interstate
That’s cool I got some time on my plate
Feeling kind of good I hope you relate
Feels good cause I can see
The world's gonna twist another way for me
On its axis, I can’t ask this of you
If I could would you come too?

We're taking on the world today
You're by my side it helps to be crazy
Taking on the world today
Don’t you ever get tired of being so lazy
Taking on the world today
Slow down the pace, life is amazing
Taking on the world today
Hey hey

All we do is run around in circles
We just wait for everything to fall in place
We wait, all we love are things that we can figure
Out and I’m about to make a change
Everything around you is gonna change

I might have showed up a little too late
I think it’s cool when you wait for me baby
Leave it to fate like I always do
Take my hand, let’s get crazy

Taking on the world today
You're by my side it helps to be crazy
Taking on the world today
Don’t you ever get tired of being so lazy
Taking on the world today
Slow down the pace, life is amazing
We're taking on the world today

Taking on the world today
Sometimes I just wanna get a little crazy
Taking on the world today
Don’t you ever get tired of being so lazy
Taking on the world today
Slow down the pace, life is amazing
We're taking on the world today
