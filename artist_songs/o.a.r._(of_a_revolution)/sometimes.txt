Sometimes the world will show us
Sometimes the world will show us
Sometimes the world will show us
We're getting closer

Late in the day there's a minute of faith
Held deep in the tiring sky
I wonder if there's a man up there
Laying down, just closing his eyes
And if there was a second or two
That brought about a calm in the day
It should be a recognizable moment
That people could appreciate

Sometimes the world will show us
Sometimes the world will show us
Sometimes the world will show us
We're getting closer

Some gypsy girl
Grabbed a chair for me
I believe it's time we talked
So rest your bones and all
Open wide and stop your walking feet
Listen close to the talking street
There's a falling out beneath
And it goes

Sometimes the world will show us
Sometimes the world will show us
Sometimes the world will show us
We're getting closer
Getting closer
Getting closer
Can you feel that sunshine?
Getting closer
Getting closer
Getting closer
Can you feel that sunshine?

Sometimes the world will show us
Sometimes the world will show us
Sometimes the world will show us
We're getting closer
Can you feel that sunshine?

Sometimes the world will show us
Sometimes the world will show us
Sometimes the world will show us
We're getting closer
Can you feel that sunshine?
Feel that sunshine
Gonna feel the sunshine
Falling down on me

It's lovely, it's lovely, it's lovely

Sometimes the world will show us
Sometimes the world will show us
Sometimes the world will show us
We're getting closer
Can you feel that?
Can you feel that?
Can you feel that?
Can you feel that?
