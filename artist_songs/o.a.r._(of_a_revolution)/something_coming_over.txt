Who's that with his arms around you?
Making eyes at you that way?
Looks in love, man it looks familiar
Damn, it's me
Never thought I'd see that day
It's like I came to from sleeping
No more bed rails
I'm pulled to daylight by your voice
Not that I had any choice

Now there's something coming over me
I know it's you
And there's someone that I used to be
But he is through
And I know that it's forever
And it's hard to do
There's something coming over me
I know it's you

And now we're talking 'bout the future
And a future wide open
If we love, it'll be the best place
I've ever been
And it was you to the rescue
Did I mention that I've never felt like this before?
I'm powerless to fight it anymore

Now there's something coming over me
I know it's you
And there's someone that I used to be
But he is through
And I know that it's forever
And it's hard to do
There's something coming over me
I know it's you

Used to watch this game from the sidelines
Now it's time to get on in and play
You've been waiting there for me for my whole life
I saw you, I saw you
And I know that it's forever
And it's hard to do
There's something coming over me
I know it's you

Now there's something coming over me
I know it's you
And there's someone that I used to be
But he is through
And I know that it's forever
And it's hard to do
There's something coming over me
I know it's you
