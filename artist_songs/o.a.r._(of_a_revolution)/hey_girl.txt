I took this girl out last night and we left around 12,
We walked along lonely streets and got to know ourselves,
I like to read - she likes to write, 
She likes to sleep - and I like to stay up all night,
My friends say I'm crazy and I agree,
But that's okay cause that the way she likes to be

Hey girl come with me and let yourself go
Hey girl come with me and let yourself go

Well we went out late that night and we danced through the night
I was holding on to her and she be gripping it tight, she was
But she didn't care, I didn't mind
I was unaware that she liked to act so kind,
My friends say I'm crazy and I agree,
But thats okay cause thats the way I like to be

I say 
Hey girl, come with me and let yourself go,
Hey girl come with me and let yourself go, go, go-oh, 
Just let yourself go

Later on that night I took her home,
I asked if she felt alright being alone
So I went inside, she didn't mind,
Took two to decide that I wasn't going home tonight
I see we're both crazy, that's alright with me,
The night was kind of hazy that's the way it's gonna be

I say now 
Hey girl, come with me and let yourself go,
Hey girl come with me and let yourself go, go, go-oh, 
Just let yourself go, go, go-oh, 
Just let yourself go, go, go-oh...
Let yourself go
