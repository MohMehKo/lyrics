Moving, spinning,
Caffeine infuse me,
And the clock strikes to 5
Close, the doors
Flip on that switch and turn on the sky
And I watch those stars grin

Empty words are like empty embraces
And those hollow days, they slowly erase us
And the words that matter are spilled in the static
And the ones that don’t are just lost in the smoke
And I watch those starts grin

Everyone’s running, shouting at city lights, keep on shining
Everyone’s running, shouting at city lights

Let me go, so I can ride
Train into the city, in the middle of the night
Let me go, so I can see
All these friends, never thought I’d get to meet
And watch those stars grin

Everyone’s running, shouting at city lights, keep on shining
Everyone’s running, shouting at city lights, keep on shining
Everyone’s running, shouting at city lights, keep on shining

I never saw the point of drawing lines in the sand, hey, lines in the sand
Saw the point of drawing lines in the sand, hey, lines in the sand, come on

I never saw the point of drawing lines up and down
I’d rather live my life with my feet on the ground
But sooner or later I gotta understand quick
Life’s not about whatcha think of it
Its whatcha you do
So when I don’t ask why, I just live my days and pass right by
And when I’m feeling good man I look to the sky
Turn that switch on and watch the light ride

I mean I never saw the point of living life side to side
You can’t really live in a lateral glide
But, I don’t want to live my life on the side
I live it in the middle where I’m winning all the time
But me, I mean the sky’s for free
I stare up at it when I can you see
And when I don’t know, man you can’t ask why
There we go turning on the light switch sky
Yeah, lines in the sand
Yeah, lines in the sand
Yeah, lines in the sand
