set out on the voyage of the conquering fools
looking for the gold and the modern day jewels
it come to pass what was stuck in my head
if i didn't quit on looking then i'm probably dead
i hit the road and i rolled up north
looking for the origin, the place of my birth
i didn't notice when i ran a red sign
hoping that everything would really be fine
uh huh huh

people come and people go
but they never know what is going on
so they gotta try to be what they wanna be
what the hell is happening to me

i hit the road and i rolled up north
looking for the origin, the place of my birth
i didn't notice when i ran a red sign
hoping that everything would really be fine
i set out about an hour ago
looking for some gold, said hey oh
then i went down looking for the big
the big brass show
so i went and then he started to go
walking down the same old, same old road
thinking to myself, this is quite a struggle
what can i gotta do tomorrow
gonna find that gold
and conquer me some fools
hey hey, hey oh

conquering fools
conquering fools
conquer some fools
hey we're conquering fools
