Caught a train in a dash
Running hard from my past
Set to ride this here rail till the end
Along the way met a queen
Now, I'm her king
And we reign our kingdom from a mountaintop
Where, baby, we can be alone

Almond eyes, royal skin
This one could do me in
And I'll live this here life 'til the end
We will win, we will win, we're gonna win this here race
Baby, we can be alone
My baby, we can be alone

Some day I'll give it all back
The time you gave
Now, baby, we can be alone
