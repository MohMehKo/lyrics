Here we go on the life
As the rain on the side
Of the house falling down to the dirt
Far away in the field
Here I am just believe
That this sky gonna open up today

After all we never fall
We just vanish out into the world
But still we all hear this call
Of love, life, and you
But you can't take it with you
You can't take it with you

Time ago somewhere in
Between books that I had read
And ones I heard about just standing in the street
I used to say that you're high
Only when things go right
But sometimes you're fathering me
And all the while I can dream
About a world in the breeze
Like my love for the spring and for you
And on the first day of June
You arrived too soon
Right on time I knew it was you

And after all we never fall
We just vanish out into the world
But still we all hear this call
Of love, life, and you

But what do you got if you ain't got someone
Holding you down at the other end
You gonna find out soon when you're on your own
But what do we got if we ain't got someone
Sharing the light of another day
And you gonna find out soon you can't take it with you
Can't take it with you
No, no

And after all we never fall
We just vanish out into the world
But still we all hear the call
Of love, life, and you

But what do you got if you ain't got someone
Holding your smile at the other end
You gonna find out soon when you're on your own
But what do we got if we ain't got someone
Sharing the light of another day
You know you can't take it with you
Oh what do you got, what do you got
No, no, no, you can't take it with you
You're all that I got, you're all that I got
Oh! Can't take it with you
