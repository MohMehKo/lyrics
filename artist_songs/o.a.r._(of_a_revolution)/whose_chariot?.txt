A patterned sunrise swept along away the sunrise.
And over these underpasses a towering mountain does rise.
But don't cross the river, not over there.
There will be a mystery revealed and I bet you dare.
And if I am to seek this place y'all can see
Whose Chariot to follow so I can be free?

At night the stars cry.
I gaze upon a lake of backyard.
And under these overpasses a towering mountain does lie.
But don't cross the river, not over there.
There will be a mystery revealed that we're meant to share.
So if I am to seek this place y'all can see
Whose Chariot to follow so I can be free?

Oh no, here we are again.
Oh no, here we are again.

My mamma told me,
"Don't go cross that river."
"Because you might not make it back.
The beast gonna eat your heart."
She said, "Don't go out there.
And stay upon your track."
"This money has torn my family apart and I cannot buy it back."
So of course I built my boat, and I was half upon my way. 
And when I got to the other side the water came rushing down.
Washed me away.

Whose Chariot...
Freedom...

Whose Chariot?
Take me home.
Take me home.

Oh no, said I'm out that door again.
I left my house, my money, and my dearest friend.
I'm not going back, Jack, across the river.
Got a little bit of business that I'm doing today.
You didn't fell me, you can't really see no good.
I made my life out of a stack of wood.
I've been moving cross the river today.
But whose chariot take me home?

Whose Chariot?
Take me home.
Hallelujah.
I'm coming home.
Who Chariot gotta will you take me?
Who Chariot will you will you take me?
Who Chariot will you will you take me?
Who Chariot would you pick me up and take me?
Who Chariot gotta will you take me?
Who Chariot just pick me up and take me.
Who Chariot come and get me.
Whose Chariot take me home?
Take me home.
