I woke today, felt another way,
everything was gonna be fine.
My head rose up then my legs came too,
quarter past nine was the time.
I used to lose floating memories, found myself
wishing I'd remember old times.
But I woke today,
felt another way,
felt free in the sky to fly.
I stepped out the door, didn't know what for,
I saw my lady walking along.
I could have cried out what I wanted to say,
but I am sick of all this terrible charm.
I used to be into apologies, a regular to shame I 
was shy.
But I woke today, 
felt another way,
felt free in the sky to fly.

Well I'm through the gate, got to my house about
a quarter to eight.
And I made a drink, got about an hour to relax and
just think.
I'm just bored, nothing's ever gonna be the same
anymore.
And with my drink in hand I got up to stand and I 
was off to a regular day.

The morning dragged on, I was walking along,
missing pieces fell to the ground.
Apparently, I could not see,
but I saw everything going down.
So I packed my bags and I was on my way,
I feel a little different in a different way.
But like I said when I got out of bed, I was off to a 
regular day.

I could not hide, I wore my pride,
it felt good to be on the run.
The air quality was something new to me and I got
along fine with the sun.
And when I rest my heard and I lay down to bed,
I put the pieces down with the blame.
And if all goes well, at the morning bell,
I'll wake feeling free just the same.
