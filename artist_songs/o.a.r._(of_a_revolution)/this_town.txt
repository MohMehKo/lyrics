In the morning wake me up
And tell me everything
So I can understand your world
You can understand my dream
I could be anywhere
And you could be there with me
I just wanna be a ghost
And see everything
I don't want it to be the way they want it

This town, this night, this crowd
Come on put em up
Let me hear it loud
This town, this city, this crowd
Stand up on your feet
Put your worry down
Any every one of you all around
Come on y'all let's take this town

Its better that we keep this close
Keep you close to me
Walking under every sky
Over every scene
You could be my modern girl
And I could be the one you've found
If we're taking on the world today
I know we gotta leave this town
I don't want it to be the way they want it

This town, this light, this crowd
Come on put em up
Let me hear it loud
This town, this city, this crowd
Stand up on your feet
Put your worry down
Any every one of you all around
Come on y'all let's take this town

On our own, let's get away
Nothing more left here to see
Come on Love, make it perfect
More and more I will believe
Like a child I must believe
Come on y'all make it perfect
This town, this light, this crowd
Come on put em up
Let me hear it loud
This town, this city, this crowd
Stand up on your feet
Put your worry down
Any every one of you all around
Come on y'all let's take this town
