I never meant to hurt you but knew I someday would
It's like I built a cabin with matches between the wood
I'll be damned if I am happy and you will pay the price
Strong becomes the lion when he believes his own advice
I've got this one beat

I know its empty in the open
Days apart from you
Ashes trace the skyline
And this burnout cabin too
I'll be damned if you forget me in this fire
I'll save your place
And keep it cool while I think of you
In the smoke I see your face
I've got this one beat; I've got this one beat
Rain come fall on me
Baby from the fallout hear me call out 
I've got this one beat
Baby from the fallout hear me call out 
I've got this one beat
In the fallout [X5]

Is this how it's gonna be?
Bending daylight here with me
I know the aftermath is harder that it seems
Is this how it's got to be?
In the fallout, the fallout, the fallout
I'm alone in the fallout

They say the sky is falling
Are the angels coming too?
I'm gonna catch them when they come
Catch them as they fall

Climb on top the tower, get me closer to the sky
I'll bring the memories back
And save them all for you
The fallout [X4]

You can hear me call out from that fallout
You can hear me call
Save me, save me from the enemy
Come save me, save me from these broken things
Fallout
