Don't fear the morning
It's okay, it's okay
Hurt weighs heavy
It's okay, it's okay
When your body's cold and shaking
I'll steer you Darlin', steer you
When your body's old and aging
I'll heal you Darlin', heal you

Your soul lights the day
I'm on my way, I'm on my way
When you're so filled with pain
I'm on my way, I'm on my way
And Baby, Baby it's just me

Look out the window
Past the Pines
Through the rain
Oh skies will open, let sun shine 
On your face
When your mind is old and fading
I'll heal you Darlin', heal you

Your soul lights the day
I'm on my way, I'm on my way
When you're so filled with pain
I'm on my way, I'm on my way
And Baby, Baby it's just me

In a matter of, in a matter of days, we'll find love
In a matter of, in a matter of days, we'll find love
And Baby, Baby that's just love
And Baby, Baby it's just me

Your soul lights the day
I'm on my way, I'm on my way
When you're so filled with pain
I'm on my way, I'm on my way
And its gonna get easier on you
And its gonna get easier on you
And its gonna get easier on you
Now it's got to get easier on your soul
Soul, soul, soul
Your soul lights the way, lights the way
I'm on my way
And Baby, Baby it's just me
