My heart beating for you
Hands are waiting on you
Eyes just looking at you
On the street we know

Broken windows are we
Both so different honey
Damn these days are never
Like the dreams we know

Listen close and turn around
I know your heart can hear me now

Follow me, I'll follow you
When there's waves on the river and a fire in the sky
Carry me, I'll carry you
When you're lost in the tunnel and you can't see the light
If you follow me, I'll follow you
If you follow me, I'll follow you

We could rule together
Walk this line forever
Damn there's always weather
Blinds the way we know

Listen close and turn around
I know your heart can hear me now

Follow me, I'll follow you
When there's waves on the river and a fire in the sky
Carry me, I'll carry you
When you're lost in the tunnel and you can't see the light
If you follow me, I'll follow you
If you follow me, I'll follow you

(I'll be waiting)
(I'll be waiting)
I got your back so call on me now

(I'll be waiting)
(I'll be waiting)
I got your back so call on me now

Call on me now
(I'll be waiting)

Follow me, I'll follow you
We could run through the city we could fly through the sky
Follow me, I'll follow you
When there's waves on the river and a fire in the sky
Carry me, I'll carry you
When you're lost in the tunnel and you can't see the light

(I'll be waiting)
(I'll be waiting)
(I'll be waiting)

If you follow me, I'll follow you
If you follow me, I'll follow you

I'll be waiting
I'll be waiting
I'll be waiting
I'll be waiting yeah
