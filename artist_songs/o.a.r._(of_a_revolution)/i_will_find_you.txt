In the cut of the night
Driving heavy on River Road
Ain't looking to fight
I just wanna' move things along
I don't want anyone's life
Just getting to know my own
Drive, drive, drive

Oh, midnight came
You're at the window, I'm in a frame
And the truth is all that remains
I will find you
I will find you
I will find you
I will find you

Foot on the floor
Heading straight for the county line
The city is no good
In the shadow you leave behind
Mama said follow the stars
But I ran out of country road
Drive, drive, yeah, I drive

But the truth will split you in two
Got to find you
I will find you
I will find you
I will find you
I will find you
I will find you
I have got to
I will find you

Nothing will break us apart
Neither the miles or the scars
Oh I know
In my head
In my soul
There’s only two
There’s me and you
I will find you
I will find you
I’ve got to
I will find you

Often summer rains just can't wait to fall
From underneath a tired atmosphere
Me, I'm in a plane watching empty cars
Fall into the ocean, disappear
But I can’t tell if this is real
Are those mountains made of steel
Am I on my way to everything that I want, or am I here
Inside the town where I was raised
We turned and walked away
Better to be lost than without you

We were all we’re meant to be
Shoreline at our feet
Waiting on a wave to run into
And out beyond the reef
The current pulled us deep
But I fought for you

The sun that turned to night
You disappeared and I’m
Left waiting on a clue
The air I’m cutting through
I can find you
I will find you
I have got to
I will find you
Find you

I got this woman, yeah she needs me bad
But she don't know
I crossed the world but it crossed me back
On I roll to a time
Wondered like a fool
Then one night
I fell in love with you

I got this woman, yeah she's so damn bad
But she don't know
I’d do anything to get her back
On I roll to a time
Wondered like a fool
Then one night
The sounds you heard were true

Oh, they are true
I found you
I found you, you, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Hey, just keep believin'
Hey, just keep believin'
Hey, just keep believin'
I’ll find you

Hey, just keep believin'
