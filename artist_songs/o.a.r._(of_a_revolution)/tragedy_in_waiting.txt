It's a tragedy in waiting
when something's on my mind
And it's hard enough for me to carry on

It's a tragedy in waiting when something's on my mind
And it's hard enough for me to carry on
Call it pleasure if you lie
But believe me when I say a busy mind will learn to change it all

It's not like I am asking for the world to fall apart
I know that it's eventually to come

Sometimes we might fall
Stand up taller
Someday we may graduate into a perfect state of mind

Have you ever left your suitcase open long after you land?
And you're scared to fold away all of your clothes
Destiny may wait, but the present day's at hand
They forgot to tell me how to end this show

Could it be that I'm the one who tied my hands behind my back?
I know that it is possible for now

Sometime we might fall
Stand up taller
Someday we may graduate into a perfect state of mind

I've got a mind to wonder which tragedy is following me
I've got a mind to wonder which tragedy is following me
I've got a mind that wonders off in search of something
And I'm gonna get there

Sometimes we might fall
Stand up taller
Someday we may fall away
Sometime we might crawl
Stand up taller
Someday we may graduate into a perfect state of mind
