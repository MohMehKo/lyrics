There's a road outside Columbus, Ohio.
Feels like I drove along for years.
this Midwest way of ease it surrounds us.
I can't deny the rhythm here.
And as I pull away from Riverside beside me,
That High Street never looked so good.
I miss my lady even though she often writes me.
She tells me takes of my neighborhood.

Surprise, Surprise, I traveled here.
Four hundred miles from where I'm known.
My friends are here.
A couple years I've spent, I found I have a second home.

As I'm blazing down my trail to education,
There's no bliss in ignorance for me.
I stop and stare, a breath of air might slow me down some.
But that's just fine with me.

Surprise, Surprise, I traveled here.
Four hundred miles from where I'm known.

I never traveled far.
Two hundred miles to go.
That boulevard will take me home.

Surprise, Surprise, I traveled here.
Four hundred miles from where I'm known.
