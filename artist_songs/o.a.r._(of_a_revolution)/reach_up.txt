Way back when we used to plan and pretend
Feel like we were dreaming every day back then
And running down light on beautiful days
Till the fireflies start movin' through space

I could see in all of us could be some magic
On the street lights we imagined
That all our world is all I want
Let it go and get it, bring it home

So everyone reach up, put your hands together
Don't give up, climb forever
All you've got, just remember
You make me feel like I'm a contender
Two hands up through the ceiling
The beat of my heart is all that I'm feeling
Giving all that I've got, first to the last one
And then I reach up cause I'm a champion

Hands are waving, stadium shaking
I've already made up my mind
Time is awaiting, I'm reaching for greatness
I'm running till I break through the line

So everyone reach up, put your hands together
Don't give up, climb forever
All you've got, just remember
You make me feel like I'm a contender
Two hands up through the ceiling
The beat of my heart is all that I'm feeling
Giving all that I've got, first to the last one
And then I reach up cause I'm a champion

Reach up, reach up, reach up
Two hands up (put your hands together), two hands up, two hands up 
Cause I'm a champion
Reach up (put your hands together) 
I got my two hands up
Reach up, I got my two hands up
You make me feel like, make me feel like I could reach up

So everyone reach up, put your hands together
Don't give up, climb forever
All you've got, just remember
You make me feel like I'm a contender
Two hands up through the ceiling
The beat of my heart is all that I'm feeling
Giving all that I've got, first to the last one
And then I reach up cause I'm a champion

Reach up (put your hands together)
I got my two hands up
Reach up, I got my two hands up
You make me feel like, make me feel like I could reach up
Reach up
I got my two hands up
Reach up, I got my two hands up
You make me feel like, make me feel like I could reach up
