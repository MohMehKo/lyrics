Crowded mind on the street tonight
head full of aches, but I'm doing all right
You're upstairs lying in our bed
Wondering if you will make it

Just a block between the door and me
Walking in to set your mind at ease
But you're upstairs lying in my bed
Wondering if I will make it home

There's a crimson rose lying in my hand
It's better off there than to understand
That no one sees when it's against the wall

I just want to sing a song to you
Lay you down like I used to do
But you're upstairs lying in my bed
Wondering if I will make it home

I'm just naked
Please don't fail me
Without your love
Without your love
I'm just naked
Please don't fail me
Without your love
I'm not going to make it home

I'm a domino falling into you
When did I tip over
Stumble up the stairs in twos
I'm going to make it

The hallways smell like a child to me
Painting you a picture
And you're inside and lying in my bed
Wondering if I will make it home

I'm just naked
Please don't fail me
Without your love
Without your love
I'm just naked
Please don't fail me
Without your love
I'm not going to make you

Tell me you're lonely
I'm waiting outside.
I never meant to put you there
But I promise that I'll try

You tell me you're lonely
I'm waiting outside
I never meant to put you there
I never meant to put you there

I'm just naked
Please don't fail me
Without your love
Without your love
I've been a soldier boy
I've been a minister
Without your love
Without your love

I've been a man at war
I've been a clone of it
Without your love
I'm not going to make it home
