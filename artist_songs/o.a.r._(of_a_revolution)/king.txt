Hey, King
Here come the wanderer
coming back into town for the money
Oh, King
He's just a warrior
So you better lay low, be ready
Hey, King
Here come the wanderer
coming back into town, it ain't pretty
Oh, down with the emperor
I hear em' yelling
Go on make the money drop

He got a feeling
but he can't decide
where to get started
the king better hide

You see, it took minutes to change
and just like that brought me back into frame
you couldn't ever want to forget it
I got a ten track mind, willing to bet it
You know
You won't believe it
Coming down the mountain
I'm running like the devil cause he's hot on my heels
I refuse to burn through these shoes
So much running got me burned out for years

He got a feeling
but he can't decide
where to get started
the king better hide

Hey, King
I'm just a wanderer
coming back into to town, it ain't pretty
Oh, King
I'm just a wanderer
So you better lay low get ready
Hey, King
I'm no murderer
And if I was you'd be gone in a minute
Oh, King
We're all wanderers
So you better get ready make the money drop

"You know when you change yourself the world around you changes instantly.
And as the world changes, to whatever you imagine, you become more powerful."

You don't believe me, but soon you will
One last thing to put in my will
These years are coming
but they're going too quick
So I don't have time to deal with this
I'm a wanderer came back for more
Non violent but I'll do it before
I'll help you open up
Oh, oh what the people don't know
Never really did till you're told so
So, I got a feeling and it won't stop
Open up the doors let me break down your shop
I know you here me coming
That it wasn't gonna be the prettiest
thing that you ever did see
The king going down
