It was a hot, hot day
The middle of May
Saw this lady just walking my way
She was the cutest thing I'd ever seen
She got some black, black hair
A little black dress with the shoe to pair
The little honey bunny she come up to me
And we walked and we talked
We don't have no time to stop that day
That day was a wonderful day
That day was the best damn day

Well, I've lost my mind
I have lost my mind a thousand times
And you would to
Friday was the day that I met you
o if you knew the lady that I knew
A mastermind of a terrible kind
But a beauty just the same
And we walk and we talk
We don't have no time to stop the day
That day was a wonderful day
That day was the best damn day

Monday woke up straight late for work
Sunday all night thinking about the girl
Saturday was high and I felt it too
I didn't know it could take so long
I didn't know that this could be
I didn't know it could take so long
I didn't know that this could be
For me

That day, that day, that day was
such a wonderful day wonderful day
such a wonderful day wonderful day
