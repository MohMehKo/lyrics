Have you ever heard the story of the Windy City Man?
Well, he's a product of the house of cards that fell from an iron hand
Picture him cool strolling, on a mission to the East
He listened to the howling winds
They called him
They called him

Like just a few before him he found his piece of mind
Trapped between what could have been and who he's soon to find
There's a calling, a calling coming down the empty road
There must be calmer days for the Windy City Man

He moved like rolling foothills tap dancing spurs cut through the dirt
Stepped across the old state line, one closer to the show
In the distance the brass is skipping across the waters of the world
It's easy to put down the past when the future's paved with gold

This is the Windy City Man
Gone are the days of the iron hand
Grounded, on fire, protect the noise
That's the Windy City Man
