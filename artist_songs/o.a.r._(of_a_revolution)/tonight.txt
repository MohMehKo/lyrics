I don't know what I'm doin tonight
And that's alright
I don't know what I'm doin with my life
And that's just fine fine yeah yeah

I don't know what we're singing tonight
But it feels alright
I got my backpack good, I got my shoes on tight
Going out tonight, yeah yeah

And I'll never lie again
And I'll never cry again
Cause I don't wanna be a falling star in your eye
I will never lie again

I don't know how you're feeling tonight
Tell me you're fine
Yeah, I know it's up in the air
I feel it too, it's right
And it's here tonight, yeah yeah

And I'll never lie again
And I'll never cry again
Cause I don't wanna be a falling star in your eye
Oh, I will never lie again

Its 10:00, where are your kids tonight
They're doin just fine, getting by tonight
Its 10:00, where are the kids tonight
They're feeling just fine, getting high tonight

I got this feeling in my bones
Yeah, it's time to run
I got one more thing on my mind, this hun
She gonna be just the one for me tonight
It's 10:00, we goin on out tonight
