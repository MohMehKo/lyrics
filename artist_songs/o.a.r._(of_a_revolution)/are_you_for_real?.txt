Oh oh oh oh
What do you know
How does it feel at the end of a rope
Feeling too hard
Something incomplete
Everything can change in direct of a beat
Are you for love
Are you for hate
Are you for anything your heart can create
Give me some time
Make me just feel
And I will come back to you with a steal
Oh then the voice came in
Softly said are you for real
Are you for real

Out on my I own
Looking for a throne
Used to be king now a king I'm on my own
I can't believe
Time kept to a T
Everything you thought wasn't real came real
And I could run
Baby to fun
Turned into the sight of the old man's run 
Yeah it's this gun
It's pointed in my back 
Got me looking back at this life this and that
Oh then the voice came through
Something that I had to feel
Are you for real
(Keep you're love on arrival)
(When it's gone then it's gone all the way)
Are you for real
(Keep you're love on arrival)
(When it's gone then it's gone all the way)
Are you for Real
(Keep you're love on arrival)
(When it's gone then it's gone all the way)
Are you for real
(Keep you're love on arrival)
(When it's gone then it's gone all the way)

And everybody run down
And we go where go anyway
Maybe I am drunk
Maybe I'll be jumped
Looking for my head but it won't come today
And all I really want
Is something to achieve
Everything could rest rest on my shoulders
I could never try
Looking in your eye
And tell you love isn't all that I got
Are you for real
(Keep you're love on arrival)
(When it's gone then it's gone all the way)
Are you for real
(Keep you're love on arrival)
(When it's gone then it's gone all the way)
Are you for Real
(Keep you're love on arrival)
(When it's gone then it's gone all the way)
Are you for real
(Keep you're love on arrival)
When it's gone then it's gone all the way

Keep you're love on arrival
When it's gone then it's gone all the way
Keep you're love on arrival
'Cause when it's gone then it's gone all the way
Keep you're love on arrival
When it's gone then it's gone all the way 
Keep you're love on arrival
When it's gone then it's gone all the way 
Yeah
Keep you're love on arrival
When it's gone then it's gone all the way
Keep you're love on arrival
When it's gone then it's gone all the way

Are you for real
(Keep you're love on arrival)
(When it's gone then it's gone all the way)
Are you for Real
(Keep you're love on arrival)
(When it's gone then it's gone all the way)

Keep you're love on arrival
When it's gone man it's gone all the way
Keep you're love on arrival
'Cause when it's gone then it's gone all the way
