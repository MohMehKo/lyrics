[B.o.B.:]
The world is a battlefield; the fight is a fireplace.
We train to sustain, so how much pain can you tolerate?
The goal is to dominate; competition annihilate.
We hunger for victory; it's the dish that we gotta taste.
The good life we chasing, my shoes on I laced them.
We don't get complacent cause each step is greatness.
A champion, we made it, it's my road, I paved it.
If you feel how I feel, you must feel amazing.

[O.A.R.:]
You’ve already won, you know it inside
And it’s not much longer ‘til we make it now.
We're all champions, we're all champions.
There's no giving up, the hunger inside
One day we gonn make it, you just stand up high.
You're a champion, you gotta know

[Chorus:]
We're all champions
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
We're all champions, we're all champions
We're all champions
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
We're all champions, we're all champions

[B.o.B.:]
It's all that I've ever known, it's all that I ever seen.
I came here with nothing but I'm a leave with a legacy.
A brand new and better me, belief is the recipe.
It ain't no second guessing when you thinking successfully.
Taking no for an answer isn't part of the deal.
You see the blood sweat and tears, we leave it all on the field.
We make our dreams reality, you can tell that it's real
Cause I'm a champion, I led a life I said I would lead.

[O.A.R.:]
You’ve already won, you know it inside
And it’s not much longer ‘til we make it now.
We're all champions, we're all champions.
There's no giving up, the hunger inside
One day we gonn make it, you just stand up high.
You're a champion, you gotta know

[Chorus:]
We're all champions
We're all champions, we're all champions
(That right, that right, nu-nu-number one)
We're all champions
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
We're all champions, we're all champions

[O.A.R.:]
Oh, who's gonna tell me that it's not my time?
Who's gonna tell me that the world ain't mine?
All of us rise up when it’s on the line
Looking for nothing cause it's all inside.
Under the weather on a midnight run
Fire, fire, I'm a champion.
Higher, higher, it's all I imagine.

[Chorus:]
We're all champions
(It don’t get much better than this)
We're all champions, we're all champions
We're all champions
We're all champions, we're all champions

[O.A.R.:]
Last chance to take this; there's no more life to bring this.
Hope is all we got to come, the stress, the doubt, time to eat at my soul.
We don’t made it so long to make it under.
Taste the, be strong, you’ve got my eyes closed.
I can see it, the screaming crowds
Lights keep flashing; it's everything we could imagine, yeah.

We're all champions, we're all champions.
We're all champions, we're all champions.

[B.o.B.:]
It’s all that I’ve ever known.
It’s all that I’ve ever known.
It’s all that I’ve ever known.
