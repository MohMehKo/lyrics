I was riding down the highway when I thought I 
Spotted someone in the road
I said, "You going my way?"
And he turned his head and said, "Man, I don't know."
So I asked about his government and he turned his head and then began to laugh
And I asked him, "what you running from?"
And he said, "My man, I'm running from my past."
And we laughed aloud, and sang aloud
And then we drank a brew
I didn't think a thought about Mr. Brown, he's through.
I heard the loud, marching sound, of a revolution coming through.
There's no need to come around unless you're true.
Someone in the road.

Well we kept on driving down that road for about an hour and half.
The way that we were moving left half myself
Reflecting in the past
Tired of endless talking, stopped the car and
Started walking down a path.
Lifted sprits to my heart,
Lord knows that anger never lasts.

And we laughed aloud, and sang aloud
And then we drank a brew
I didn't think a thought about Mr. Brown, he's through.
I heard the loud, marching sound, of a revolution coming through
There's no need to come around unless you're true.
Someone in the road.
