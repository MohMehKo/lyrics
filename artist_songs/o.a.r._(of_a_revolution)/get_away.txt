Is it me or does it seem that life just carries on?
Now was it him who said that life is just a song?
Now I don't know what will keep me on this little Earth
I just might use the love that's all in the dirt
But every damn time
That I see you
I say to myself
She ain't worth it
She ain't worth nothin I got
Ah no no
Nah nah

Was it you who said that my life is over?
Baby it was over from the very start
And did you say that I won't be around downtown tomorrow?
Ah yes I will with a hardened heart

But every damn time
That I see you
I say to myself
She ain't worth it
She ain't worth nothin I got
Ah no way
Na uh

She can have anything she wants
But she really doesn't know about the way she taunts
It's tearin me apart,
It's tearin me apart
Get Away, get up, and get away
