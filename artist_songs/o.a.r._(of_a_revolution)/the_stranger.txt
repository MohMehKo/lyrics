Crossing this country, I'm stalling
I'm coming down
Over my head, I'm falling
Will I be found?
I've had to be a million places at one
That's not me

I'm a stranger on the outside when
I'm not right next to you
I remember how to get there
Will you be there when I'm coming through?

Crossing this room to my lovely, my saving grace
Promise that time hasn't lost me
And don't turn away
I've had to be a million faces at one
That's not me
That's not me

I'm a stranger on the outside when I'm not right next to you
I remember how to get there
Will you be there when I'm coming through?
Take me back into your arms where I belong
There I'm no stranger to you

The mirror has broken
What do you see?
A million of you and a million of me
The future's unspoken
Who do you see?
The one on the outside
That's not me

I'm a stranger on the outside when I'm not right next to you
I remember how to get there
Will you be there when I'm coming through?
I'm a stranger on the outside when I'm not right next to you
I'm a stranger on the outside when I'm not right next to you
I'm a lonely man walking, searching for my home
Been a thousand years and her I am I'm all alone
I'm out looking for my lovely one to save the day
Here I come, I'm no stranger today
