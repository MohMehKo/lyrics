she takes it deep to her heart
right from the start
she talks softly over a glass of whine

now and again 
she is more than a friend
but don't you just throw me a line

say now it would be great
if she'd dedicate
just a minute from her precious time

said i'll give it a while 
but thats not my style
now how is that a crime

everyone says that i'm wild
pardon my french but i still know my child
and that wasn't it
i told her i needed some time from her daddy-o

i began walking
while she was still talkin
lookin for an exit sign

pardon my face 
but i am leaving no trace
cause i really haven't got the time 

well i began thinking
and my heart is just sinking 
looking for a place to go

well isn't it bad
how she'll treats you so bad
and u never really let her know

well everyone says that shes cryin
but i can't forget all the tiem i spent tryin
and that wasn't it 
i told her i needed some time from her daddy-o

and i know i know
what it feels like to be alone
i say now i know i know
what it feels like to be at home

i say i like i like
stoping to say hello
said its my life my life my life
why can't we take this slow, why can't we take this slow

why can't we take this slow

now i been thro the phases
and i walked thro the mazes
i'm sick and just a little tired

i'm sure it isn't fair 
but i'm not aware 
of the patience thats required

if i could have kissed her 
everytime that i misses her
i wouldn't be out the door

but now and again 
i sure need a friend
now isn't that what shes for

everyone says that i'm lyin
but i can't forget all the times she was cryin
and that wasn't it 
i told her i need some time from her daddy-o

and i know i know
what it feels like to be alone
i say now i know i know
what it feels like to be at home

i say i like i like
stoping to say hello
said its my life my life my life
why can't we take this slow, why can't we take this slow

baby take this slow
its my life my life
why can't we take this slow
