Got nothing to do
Ain't got no job
Ain't got no one to lose, yeah
And i got to find bob
Sometimes this life
I might sail away

It's kind of weird how shit goes down
It's kind of funky moving around
Sometimes this life
I might sail away
Might sail away, might sail away, might sail away, might sail away
Hey la-da-da-da-da, might sail away

People just need to wonder why
All the birds up in that great old big blue sky
And they just got to go and say
You know they got to
They got to, they got to, they got to, they go to sail away
Might sail away, might sail away, might sail away, might sail away
Hey hey, might sail away

I got a job
Still got no one to lose
Still got to find bob
Sometimes this life
I might sail away
Might sail away, might sail away, might sail away, might sail away
Hey la-da-da-da-da, might sail away

Sometimes this life
I might sail away
Might sail away, might sail away
Might sail away
