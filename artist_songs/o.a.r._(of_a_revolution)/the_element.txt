Yeah, I'm in the element
Who's to say it'll get much better
Yeah, when you've got everything
Who's to say it'll last forever

I'm on the beach, sun in my hands
Rays on the waves dancings like diamonds
Looking for peace here in the sand
Sounds of the world suddenly silent

Streelights are on again
Don't think I wanna come back in
I need to stay right where I stand
And wait for the sky to bend

Yeah, I'm in the element
Who's to say it'll get much better
Yeah, when you've got everything
Who's to say it'll last forever

I need to live this
Not be a witness
Yeah, I'm in the element
Oh, I'm in the element

I'm on the sceene sailing away
Chasing the light on the horizon
I can't believe everyone stayed
Now I'm alone far from the island

This time I won't forget
Lighthouse can't call me in
I'd rather stay out on the waves
And wait for the swell to end

And it's in my hands again

Yeah, I'm in the element
Who's to say it'll get much better
Yeah, when you've got everything
Who's to say it'll last forever

I need to live this
Not be a witness
Yeah, I'm in the element
Oh, I'm in the element

I'm unaware, don't know when I'll be here again
I'm a wanderer, it's my only road
Won't go home 'til I own what I came here for
I came here for

Yeah, make me feel like my life ain't over
Yeah, make me feel like I'm getting closer

Yeah, I'm in the element
Who's to say it'll get much better
Yeah, When you've got everything
Who's to say it'll last forever

I need to live this
Not be a witness
Yeah, I'm in the element
Oh, I'm in the element

I need to live this
Not be a witness
Yeah, I'm in the element
Oh, I'm in the element
