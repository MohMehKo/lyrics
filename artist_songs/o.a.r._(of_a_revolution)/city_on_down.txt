Well, in the end my friend, we will all be together again
Clutching onto my hand, in a valley we'll stand, just living again
And in a while we'll smile, march on another mile
On hallowed hills, attached to the land we'll be still
No one's ever gonna say a thing
And we'll be together, together again
Taking off to the city on down
Just a while ago my soul was confused, amused at what it did not know
Days went by, and amusement cried, I decide to let
My soul fly on by itself, pick happiness up and bring it back to the shelf
We'll be okay one day, in a valley we will stay
No more moving on
I knew it was right here all along
Won't have to hold your crown, no more looking around
Just holding you tight in the city on down
Just a while ago my soul was confused, amused at what it did not know
But days went by and amusement cried
I decide it's time, I got to move on now
But I was so scared
I was frightened, somewhat enlightened
So I changed shoes
Now I walk through a valley of color much better than the other
Way I did not know, but now we can be united
Miracle, miracle sighted, and I'm pulling it in
I know by now we can all walk together at a regular speed
Do you dare to be excited, are you somewhat delighted?
Are you aware somewhat delighted?
At what you did not know
Let's take it to the city on down
