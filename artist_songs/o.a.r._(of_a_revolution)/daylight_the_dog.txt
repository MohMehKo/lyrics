I'm looking for a stray dog to follow me home
I'm stepping off the A train ready to roam
Smoking underneath a cold rain before moving on
I'm looking for a stray dog to follow me home
Follow me home

Hoping for daylight to follow me
If you're lost in the dark get to where you can see
There is somewhere we're supposed to be
And you know
In a matter of time you set yourself free

I'm pulling out my pockets
Got a dollar or two
Changing my path home a dog on the loose
So where do I go?
When they know all about you
Here's your chance to kiss them all goodbye

Hoping for daylight to follow me
If your lost in the dark get to where you can see
There is somewhere we're supposed to be
And you know
In a matter of time you set yourself free

There is something you need to know
Charge the wall
Tear down the hull
Make a point to have a point of view
It doesn't matter what you say
And no, I can't come out to play
Because I've got something else to do

Hoping for daylight to follow me
If your lost in the dark get to where you can see
There is somewhere we're supposed to be
And you know
In a matter of time you set yourself free
