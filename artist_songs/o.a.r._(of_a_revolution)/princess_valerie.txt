This is the story of Valerie Rose
Tied up and weighted sleeping below
Once was a lass picking flowers by the road
This is the story of Valerie Rose

Afternoon Sunday dandelion sun
Here come that heat wave dust on the run
Along come a man out but a day
Gave her some candy and took her away

Hear her long lonely cry
From the bottom of a river that won't ever dry
Now it's too late for Valerie

Out come the hounds pickin' through the brush
Found that old rag doll she loved so much
Gone was the scent gone was the girl
That was the story of Valerie's world

Hear her long lonely cry
From the bottom of a river that won't ever dry
Now it's too late for Valerie

Hear her long lonely cry
From the bottom of a river that won't ever dry
Now it's too late for Valerie

Princess Valerie... Princess Valerie... Valerie...
