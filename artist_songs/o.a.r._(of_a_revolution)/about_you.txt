We watch the sky go dark
People getting colder
With walls around their hearts
But I know
You and I can shine
High above the buildings
In each others eyes, I think
About you
About you
About you
A thousand times a day
About you
About you
About you
A thousand times a day
I watch your body move
Poetry in motion
As you dance around my room
An angel in New York
A flower in this city
Growing wild inside my heart
I think
About you
About you
About you
A thousand times a day
About you
About you
About you
A thousand times a day
I just want to show you how I feel
Just want to show you
It feels like it’s just the beginning
It feels like I’ll never want again
Well it feels like
The world is spinning all around her
And all I can do is think
A thousand times a day
About you
About you
About you
A thousand times a day
About you
About you
About you
A thousand times a day
About you
About you
About you
A thousand times a day
About you
About you
I just want to show you
I just want to show you
I just want to show you
