Patiently, you slipped away from me
It's not alright, you couldn't put up no fight
But patiently, I'm not afraid
To miss you now that you're gone
To miss my friend for good
But patiently, you slipped away from me
We want you back
I miss you my friend, but so patiently

Patiently, I went home that night
And I sat down to write,
But I couldn't think of anything to write that night
Patiently, I heard about it late
You were gone before I said goodbye
You're gone now it's just too late
Patiently, you slipped away from me
We want you back
I miss you my friend, but so patiently
You fell into silence, I hate all this silence
It's leaving me patient
And this patience, has breeded such violence
Oh I hate all this violence
I miss you my friend, I'm waiting for you patiently

I'll never forget that night
As long as I live
On the way home from the city, I heard you were gone
Felt like something fell off me
I'm light, I'm free
Because the pain stopped
She had it, had to tell me
Got to her house, everybody was there
Even when you're gone
Bring us all together
And this patience, this silence,
You might be gone, but I feel you strong
And the patience, waiting in silence
Oh I hate all this silence
I miss you my friend,
Waiting for you patiently
Oh so patiently,
Oh so patiently
Oh, bring it back
Come on back
We need you back
Wait for you wait for you
Patiently
Come on back
We need you around
Waiting for you
Waiting for you
So patiently
