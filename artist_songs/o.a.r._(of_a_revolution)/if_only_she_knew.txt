if only she knew
what was going right,
if only she knew,
i would not be alone tonight.
if only she knew
what was going wrong
if only she knew
i would not be singing this song.
if only she knew
what would i do?
would i run?
maybe stick around just for fun
would i take you out just us two?
that would be grand
if only she knew

if only she knew what to do...
relax with you
and let myself get lost in your smile
well i could lose it all for awhile
oh my dear you know its true
i love you deep, if only you knew
well i would give it all to you
love you true if only you knew

if only she knew
what would i do?
would i run?
maybe stick around just for fun
would i take you out just us two?
that would be grand
if only she knew
