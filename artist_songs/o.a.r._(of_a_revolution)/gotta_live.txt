It's like a raindrop has fallen down on me
I hope it don't stop, I finally set myself free
I wanna be good, wanted to feel
That's fine enough to say but it don't make it real

Maybe I've been fighting just for nothing
But it's worth it in the end I feel
Laid up one night, tide in my eyes
Painting all the pictures on the back of my mind

Waiting for the shake down
I know it's coming, so I gotta lay it all on the line
'Cause all I want is just a good life
All I want is just a good life

But I gotta live like it is my last shot
Gotta live it up and down everyday
Gotta live if I wanna have a good life
Everyday gotta do more than I say

Gotta live like it is the last lime
Gotta live it up and down everyday
Gotta live, wanna have a good life
Let's do it now, would you show me how?
Gotta live

I must be losing another reason to feel alive
It's not for choosing, the path that I took is fine
'Cause I wanna be right, don't we all?
So we just walk around standing ten feet tall

Maybe we've been blinded, caught sleeping
But it's time for the rise up again
All we want is just a good life
All we need is just a good life

But we gotta live like it is your last shot
Gotta live it up and down everyday
Gotta live if you wanna have a good life
Everyday gotta do more than you say

Gotta live like it is the last lime
Gotta live it up and down everyday
Gotta live if you wanna have a good life
Let's do it now, would you show me how?
Gotta live

Maybe it's a state, a state that could be mine
I don't know I feel confused half of the time
But I remember when you told me real quick
"Son, look at your life, look back at it thick"

And then the thunder's clapping on the heels of Manhattan
I think it, it tends to happen from time to time
"Shake me up", said son
"Told me as you hold me, live this life every time"

You gotta live like it is your last shot
Gotta live it up and down everyday
Gotta live if you wanna have a good life
Let's do it now, I'm a show you how

Gotta live like it is your last time
Gotta give it up and down everyday
Gotta live if you wanna have a good life
Everyday do more than you say
Gotta live, live

Got to live more everyday
Do it when you say
Gotta live
