Tell me I'm dreaming
My feet are stone and my light is dim
Chasing this demon on his way down

Whatever happened? Whatever happened?

Spent the night out on the hill
And watched the world 
Sleep sound and still
And over mountains
Darkness will wash me over

Whatever happened? Whatever happened?
It's been a long way back 
From the edge of that
Saw the world from the hill
I'm right back where it started
And it still feels right
Like the very first time
I saw the world like a kid
Yesterday is over
Let's write another story tonight

City gates of rusted iron
Can't contain the light inside
So I spot this devil at the county line
And went no further

Whatever happened? Whatever happened?
It's been a long way back 
From the edge of that
Saw the world from the hill
I'm right back where it started
And it still feels right
Like the very first time
I saw the world like a kid
Yesterday is over
Let's write another story tonight

After all the time is gone
I'll have morning

It's been a long way back 
From the edge of that
When the world was a kid
I'm right back where it started
And it still feels right
Like the very first night
Saw the world like a kid
Let's write another story tonight
I saw the world from the hill
Let's write another story tonight
I saw the world like a kid
Let's write another story
Write another story tonight
