It's been such a long day
Followed by long nights
Sit here by myself
But it just don't feel alright
You've been talking to me
Everyone talking at me like

Try me
I'll let you live, I'll let you breathe
Try me
I'll pick you up and make you believe

You're surrounded and scared, ain't ya?
Nobody's there for you
Under it all they don't shine the way you do
But you're tangled up in
Everything wrong for you
Come on back to me
And I will make it be the one
Everyone talking at ya
Everyone coming at ya like

Try me
I'll let you live, I'll let you breathe
Try me
I'll pick you up and make you believe
Try me
I'll let you live, I'll let you breathe
Try me
I'll pick you up and make you believe

I know it's been such a long time
And I still don't let you in
I know it feels like a long time
But you're never coming back again
Are you ever coming back again?

It's been such a long day
Followed by long nights
Sit here by myself
And it just don't feel so right

Try me
I'll let you live, I'll let you breathe
Try me
I'll pick you up and make you believe
Try me
I'll let you live, I'll let you breathe
Try me
I'll pick you up and make you believe
Try me
I'll let you live, I'll let you breathe
Try me
I'll pick you up and make you believe
