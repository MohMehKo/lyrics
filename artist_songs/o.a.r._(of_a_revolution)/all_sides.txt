I don't want to be a movie star
I don't want to have my 15 minutes, wasting paper in a magazine
Like everyone, everyone, everyone
I don't want to be a politician
I don't want to be a talking man, always eager for the next election
Like everyone, everyone, everyone...

All sides then they say, whats next?
I wont ask for forgiveness
From all sides then they say, whats next? 
I wont ask for forgiveness...

I don't want to be a social problem, in the shadow of the next big thing
Wrong look, wrong clothes, wrong time, like everyone, everyone, everyone
I don't want to be no role model
I don't want to be the talking man
I just want to live my life like everyone, everyone, everyone...

From all sides then they say, whats next? I wont ask for forgiveness
From all sides then they say, whats next? I wont ask for forgiveness
From all sides then they say, whats next? I wont ask for forgiveness
From all sides then they say, whats next? I wont ask for forgiveness...

All the pretty things will come to pass, all the pretty things will come to pass,
all the empty fools they just wont last, they wont last...

From all sides then they say, whats next? I wont ask for forgiveness
From all sides then they say, whats next? I wont ask for forgiveness
From all sides then they say, whats next? I wont ask for forgiveness
From all sides then they say, whats next? I wont ask for forgiveness...

Don't want to be a movie star, don't want to be a politician
I just want to live my life like everyone...

From all sides then they say, whats next? I wont ask for forgiveness
From all sides then they say, whats next? I wont ask for forgiveness
From all sides then they say, whats next? I wont ask for forgiveness
From all sides say, whats next
Everyone...
