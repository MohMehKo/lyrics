now peter sat on the mountain top
northern wind blowing through his hair
now peter never took the time to stop
he just stood out there and stared
i said but peter didn't care about the air down there
he was looking right at the sun
well the sun said son don't you come around here
and peter then began to run
hey

now peter he never cried too much
he just looked out toward the west
he was dreaming of a land that was way over there
and dreaming of what comes next

but peter didn't care about the air down there
he was looking right out at the sun
and the sun said son come around here
and peter started to run

he said la-dan-dan-dan-dan-dan-dan-day
he said la-dan-dan-dan-dan-dan-dan-day
well, hey-oh

now peter started walking down the mountain
just runnin out toward the west
it was slippery like the water from a fountain
and peter thought that was best

cause he slid down there to the town over there
And the people just started to cry
And peter didn't care about the air
And peter was never shy

he said la-dan-dan-dan-dan-dan-dan-day
he said la-dan-dan-dan-dan-dan-dan-day
he said la-dan-dan-dan-dan-dan-dan-dan-dan-dan-dan-day
he said la-dan-dan-dan-dan-dan-dan-dan-dan-dan-dan-day

he sang out loud to a unified crowd
singing something about he thought he was
but the crowd didn't care about the air up there
and peter wasn't nothing but nothing

peter didn't care, he just looked over there
and the crowd was smiling back
he was singing at his heart and praying to his soul
that they would ask him back

he said la-dan-dan-dan-dan-dan-dan-day
he said la-dan-dan-dan-dan-dan-dan-day
well, hey-oh

now peter
was looking around to the back
mountain slipped from under his feet

he didn't really care about the air down there
he looked right at the sun
the sun said son don't you come around here
so peter then began to run

he said la-dan-dan-dan-dan-dan-dan-day
he said la-dan-dan-dan-dan-dan-dan-day
he said la-dan-dan-dan-dan-dan-dan-dan-dan-dan-dan-day
he said la-dan-dan-dan-dan-dan-dan-dan-dan-dan-dan-day
la-dan-dan-dan-dan-dan-dan-day
