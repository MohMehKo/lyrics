On the black rock is where i spend my time
writing a memory or writing a rhyme
thinking about what is right or wrong
On the black rock is where i like to go
After a long night comin home from the show
thats where i write my song all day long
the black rock
Sometimes, i just look around
taking the feeling coming out from the ground
thats just something i do sometimes
and then i just come out the door
taking the wind coming off of the shore
and thats just what im doing tonight

When you are on your own
not speaking out is like fighting alone
and that is the worst damn way to fight
and when you are scared no more
you reach your hand out and just open the door
and thats just what I'm doing tonight
