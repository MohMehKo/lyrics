You got it inside out
It's like you got it all wrong
The way that you pull me so strong
It's a shame that you're ever alone

Friday evening, middle of the fall
Trading glances here with strangers on the mall
But too much damage to recognize them all
And too much dust covered words that been written on the wall
You see I try and I try anyway
Try to get your eye everyday

Yeah, you got me inside out
Yeah, you got it all wrong
The way that you pull me so strong
It's a shame that you're ever alone
You got it upside down
Out of the valley we run
Standing on the burning hot sun
It's a shame that you're ever alone

Behind her smile, she's hiding everything
She's fighting battles that only her eyes were built to see
If you continue laying low you'll never rise
And you can't swim underwater if you never learn how to dive
And then she cry, then she cry everyday
She cries, and she cries anyway

Girl, you got it inside out
It's like you got it all wrong
It's like you got me so strong
Shame that you're ever alone
Yeah, you got it upside down
Out of the valley we run
Standing on the burning hot sun
It's a shame that you're ever alone

Inside out
Upside down
Right side up
Fill my cup

If you think you're nothing, you got it inside out
Go get something, turn it upside down
If you think you're nothing, you got it inside out
So go be something, turn it upside down

You got it inside out, say upside down
Say right side up, fill the cup
You got it inside out, say upside down
I'm up so low, fill my cup

You got me inside out, upside down
Right side up, I fill my cup

Inside out
