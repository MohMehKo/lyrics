She said ain’t the world lovely
Laying down here on a Sunday
Oh, it’s like all he ever wanted
Sunrise with the girl on his side
Said she’d never let ‘em go easy
Said he’d never let her hide
It’s all we got therefore we just can’t stop
Have to wait up ’til the morning drops

We going all night, all night
Waiting on a sunrise in our eyes
When everybody’s all right, all right
You gotta catch the sunlight sometimes

Who knows when these falling hours
Are gonna’ dry up with the flowers
She don’t care, baby got the power
Fall back give me love in stacks
A soul just a little bit brighter
Pain with the cold on the fire
It’s all we got therefore we just won’t stop
Used to count quarters now we on the block

We going all night, all night
Waiting on a sunrise in our eyes
When everybody’s all right, all right
You gotta catch the sunlight sometimes

Make ya say yeah
I love it when you say yeah

The calm that come before the break of dawn
Never really that calm at all
Quiet still, we watched the world mourn
Oh, witness as the darkness falls away

It’s like five a.m. me and my friends
Waiting on the sunrise come back again
Hold up quick, lights down I need to fix
Rays broken what we doing with it
We got to holler, holler, nothing but a dollar
Let’s slip in town and spread the light around
Like the holler holler, nothing but a dollar
Let’s slip in town and spread it all around

Oh, we going all night, all night
Waiting on a sunrise in our eyes
When everybody’s all right, we’re all right
We gotta catch the sunlight sometimes

We going all night, all night
Waiting on a sunrise in our eyes
When everybody’s all right, we’re all right
You gotta catch the sunlight sometimes
