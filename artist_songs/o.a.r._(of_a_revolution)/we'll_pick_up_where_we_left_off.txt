Somewhere in the party lies
We're hiding all our tears tonight
It's more than us just hanging out
We're making every second count

Nobody's good at letting go
And I don't mean to let it show
I was fine until I saw
Your suitcase by the door

Hey, don't say goodbye, just say goodnight
And we'll pick up where we left off
We'll say hello and welcome home
And we'll pick up where we left off

Light me up and fill my glass
Dancing while the cameras flash
Like tomorrow's just another day
And you never have to go away

In between those red balloons
Broken stars and yellow moon
Someone turned that music loud
Sing along and let it out

Hey, don't say goodbye, just say goodnight
And we'll pick up where we left off
We'll say hello and welcome home
And we'll pick up where we left off

Telling stories, making toasts
You know I'm gonna miss you most
Time will bring you back to me
Like we never skipped, skipped a beat

Singing, hey, don't say goodbye, just say goodnight
And we'll pick up where we left off
We'll say hello and welcome home
And we'll pick up where we left off

Hey, don't say goodbye, just say goodnight
And we'll pick up where we left off
We'll say hello and welcome home
And we'll pick up where we left off
