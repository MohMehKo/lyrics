That ivory tower's looking tattered and tired 'round the eyes
Ain't getting much sleep at night
My daddy told me politicians never learn the golden rule
Do unto others, as you'd have them do to you

But you go 'round and around it
You go over and under
I go through

Foot on the table, running car, and tuck my kids in at night
The American Dream in real life, yeah
My mom's an Angel, cigarette smoke like a halo 'round her hair
Sun is shining right behind her standing there

You go 'round and around it
You go over and under
I go through
You go 'round and around it
You go over and under
I go through

You break my legs, then make me walk
You seal my lips, and demand I talk
You blind my eyes, then ask me if I like what you drew
Yeah, you do

You go 'round and around it
You go over and under
I go through
Oh, through, go on

My kid he asked me, "daddy when you coming home to me from work?"
If I'm being honest, man, that hurt

So I go 'round and around it
I go over and under
He goes through

You break my legs, then make me walk
You seal my lips, and demand I talk
You blind my eyes, then ask me if I like what you drew
Yeah, you do

You go 'round and around it
You go over and under
I go through
I go 'round and around it
I go over and under
She's go through

We go 'round and around it
We go over and under
We go through
