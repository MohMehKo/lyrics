From night til dawn, you soldiered on, did ya?
Each day is a gift
But you lead us strong and kept us on, did ya?
Like each day is a gift
I never thought that I'd be here with you
Saying all these words that I have to
After all is said and all is done
I never meant to ever hurt no one
And nothing has to change
You and I are strange
Passing in the night between the darkness and the rain

At the crack of dawn, you grabbed my arm did ya?
Each day was a gift
You told me slow
Before I move on you must remember
Each day is a gift
I never understood it was for you
Could never be for me
This will have to do
Yet after all you've said and all you've done
I know you never meant to hurt no one
And nothing has to change
You and I are strange
Passing in the night between the darkness and the rain
Nothing has to change
You and I can be strange
Passing in the days between the morning and the rain
I can see you now, it's like you're never gone

From dusk til dawn, you soldiered on
Like each day was a gift
Oh you lead us strong but you couldn't hold on
And that's fine cause each day was a gift

I don't know when I'll be home
So save a place for me til I get there
I don't know when I'll be home
So save a place for me
