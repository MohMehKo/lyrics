It's 3 a.m. and i wanna go to bed
I got a lady runnin' through my head
Ran out of money, looking for a night shift
It's 3 a.m. and i want to go to bed

I know this lady, way down in my country
She is so pretty that my eyes throw disguises at me
An we will sit and wonder 'bout our future
But now i'm thinkin' that today sounds fine to me
Well i've been working five days full time
Ain't got no money but everything is goin' fine 
I've been tired in my head,
I've been tired in my head...

It's 3 a.m. and i wanna go to bed
I got a lady running through my hair
Ran out of money, looking for a night shift
It's 3 a.m. and i want to go to bed

I know this lady with eyes as blue as the sea
Now we would sit and stare directly through me
And that laugh would take me to my future
Throughout my past, there aint nothin left for me
Well i've been working five days full time
I've got no money but everything is goin' fine
But i've been tired in my head
Well i've been tired in my head...

Its 3 a.m. and i wanna go to bed
I got a lady runnin' through my hair
Ran out of money, looking for a night shift
It's 3 a.m., i want to go to bed...

i feel my lady yea
i feel my lady yeaaa
i feel my lady tonight my baby come to me 
and make my mind 
remind me where i can be 
so i can plan out my future
But i've been thinking five days full time
I've got no money but everything is goin' fine
i've been tired in my head
i've been tired in my head...

Its 3 a.m. and i wanna go to bed
I got a lady runnin' through my head
Ran out of money, looking for a night shift
It's 3 a.m., i want to go to bed she want in my head
just want to rest my head to bed 
she wont let me go
