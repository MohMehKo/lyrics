Come here and visit my world
Come here and visit my world
Dead history shining stars
Our love is the only way
Don't get lost cause i am waiting
Summer feelings are waiting, boy

You and me is more than a hundred miles
You and me is more than the grey sky
You and me is more than the lonely days
It's our time to go
Dance with me one more time

You and me is more than a hundred miles
You and me is more than the grey sky
You and me is more than the lonely days
It's our time to go
Dance with me one more time

Come here and visit my world
Dead history shining stars
Our love is the only way
Don't get lost cause I am waiting
Summer feelings are waiting, boy

You and me is more than a hundred miles
You and me is more than the grey sky
You and me is more than the lonely days
It's our time to go
Da-dance with me one more time

Dance with me one more time

You and me is more than the lonely days
It's our time to go
Da-dance with me one more time

You and me is more than a hundred miles
You and me is more than the grey sky
You and me is more
It's our time to go
Dance with me one more time
