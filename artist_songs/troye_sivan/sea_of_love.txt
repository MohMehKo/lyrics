Come with me, my love
To the sea, the sea of love
I want to tell you how much
I love you ooh oh a ooh

Do you remember when we met?
That's the time I knew you were my pet
I want to tell you how much
I love you ooh oh a ooh

Do you remember when we met?
That's the time I knew you were my pet
I want to tell you how much
I love you ooh oh a ooh

I love you, I love you, I love you
I love you...
