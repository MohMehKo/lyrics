Yesterday I heard the news
That 4 million Russian children are homeless
They've been abandoned by the people they trust
Now their cold and lonely lives are hopeless

Children of the world are dying
People say they care, they're lying
If this life was theirs, they'd be crying
Is it really fair we're not trying?

Yesterday I read the news
That 20 million Asian children are homeless
They've been abandoned by the people they love
They've been beaten down so hard they can't get up

Children of the world are dying
People say they care, they're lying
If this life was theirs, they'd be crying
Is it really fair?

Children of the world
People say they care, well they're lying
If this life was theirs, they'd be crying
Is it really fair we're not trying?

Life is beautiful for some
Life is beautiful for us
Life isn't beautiful for them
Maybe life can be beautiful again for them
