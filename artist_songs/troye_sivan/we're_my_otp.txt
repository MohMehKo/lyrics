Valentine's Day is creeping up on me
Still staring at you on my computer screen
Writing a fan fic in the middle of the night
'Cause this will bring us closer, right?

"You've never met them," the peasant cried
SHUT THE FUCK UP BITCH, DO YOU WANT TO DIE?!
I've told you before, are you deaf?
I've fallen in love with a GIF

OTP,
We're my OTP,
Baby you and me
We'd be so sexy

OTP,
We're my OTP,
Baby you and me
We'd be so sexy

Bieber fever, One Direction infection
Whatever floats your boat, what's your addiction?
And you, Tumblr, you make it so much worse
You make me feel the feels, RIGHT WHERE IT HURTS!

I'll love you always, I'll love you 5ever
I'll love you as much as I love Nutella... almost.

OTP,
We're my OTP,
Baby you and me
We'd be so sexy

OTP,
We're my OTP,
Baby you and me
We'd be so sexy

OTP,
We're my OTP,
Baby you and me
We'd be so sexy, oh

OTP,
We're my OTP,
Baby (We're my OTP baby!) you and me (OTP, OTP)
We'd be so sexy, oh

[Spoken:]
No, literally, the only thing that's stopping us from getting married is the fact that we haven't "met yet".
