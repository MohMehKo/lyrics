Take me back to the basics and the simple life
Tell me all of the things that make you feel at ease
Your touch, my comfort, and my lullaby
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night

I'm down to my skin and bone
And my mommy, she can't put down the phone
And stop asking how I'm doing all alone, alone
But the truth is the stars are falling, ma
And the wolves are out calling, ma
And my home has never felt this far

But all this driving
Is driving me crazy
And all this moving
Is proving to get the best of me
And I've been trying to hide it
But lately
Every time I think I'm better
Pickin' my head up, getting nowhere

Take me back to the basics and the simple life
Tell me all of the things that make you feel at ease
Your touch, my comfort, and my lullaby
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night
The truth is...

(I've been lying to them all
I don't need it anymore
Don't you worry about me
I'll be fine if I can breath
I've been hidin' for too long
Taking shit for how I'm wrong
How I'm wrong
Always wrong)
