Scared my love, you'll go
Spend my love, heart broke
So my love don't show
Scared my love, you'll go

Too good to be good for me
Too bad that that's all I need
Too good to be good for me
Too bad that that's all I need
All I need

Fingers walk your thigh
Breathe my love, get high
And oh, I'm so scared
Oh I'm so scared
It's just for tonight

So I take a sip, wait 'til it hits
That liquid guilt is on my lips
I'm wasted on you

Too good to be good for me
Too bad that that's all I need
Too good to be good for me
Too bad that that's all I need
Too good to be good for me
Too bad that that's all I need
Too good to be good for me
Too bad that that's all I need
All I need

So I take a sip, wait 'til it hits
That liquid guilt is on my lips
I'm wasted on you
(Wasted on you)

Too good to be good for me
Too bad that that's all I need
Too good to be good for me
Too bad that that's all I need
All I need
