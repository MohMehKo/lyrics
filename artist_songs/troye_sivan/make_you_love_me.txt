Well I can't make you love me, but I'll try
Oh the Lord knows how hard I'll try
I can't make you need me, but I'll try
Oh the Lord knows how hard I'll try

But when the su-u-u-un starts to set 
And when the ski-i-i-ies take your breath
And I need to sense you, right there
You just wave goodbye, wave goodbye

Well I can't make you love me, but I'll try
Until my dying breath, you know I'll try
I can't make you feel it, if it's not there
Only the Lord knows why it's not there

But when the su-u-u-un starts to set 
And when the ski-i-i-ies take your breath
And I need to sense you, right there
You just wave goodbye, wave goodbye

I can't make you love me, yeah
I can't make you love me 
(I can't make you love me)

But when the su-u-u-un starts to set 
And when the ski-i-i-ies take your breath
And I need to sense you, right there
You just wave goodbye, wave goodbye
(You just wave goodbye)
