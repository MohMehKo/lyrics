Wrapped my thoughts around your mind
Wrapped your body around mine

Play it back then press rewind
To when you traced your fingers drew my spine
Lost its beat and so I find
I starve my heart of touch and time

So what do I do now?
I don't keep love around
What do I do now?
I don't keep love around
What do I do now?
I don't keep love around, love around
Love around, love around

When we tried it, we were a fire with no smoke
Rags to riches but I'm addicted to being broken
Take my breath away, you know I'm bound to choke
When I close my eyes I still see your ghost

So what do I do now?
I don't keep love around
What do I do now?
I don't keep love around
What do I do now?
I don't keep love around, love around
Love around, love around

I don't keep love around
I don't keep love around
Ooh yeah, I don't keep love around
Love around
Love around

[Tkay Maidza:]
They can't stand, I handstand
I don't hold on right anymore
Pleased to meet you, I'm kinda' moved
But that last one was my antidote
Green eyes, become green times
But there is no first or a last chance
They're telling me to turn down
'Cause I'm so lit, recall flashdance?
Only A1, and I stay 1
And I'm counting out for that day when
Residuals become imminent
'Cause failure is not pivotal
They just be asking the same
Try switch it up, I switch lanes
No love in this world, I'm still sane
Right? Because that's enough?
When the lights on
And you don't keep love

[Troye Sivan:]
'Distance makes the heart grow fonder'
Said by someone stronger than me
So what do I do now?
Do now?
So what do I do now?
I don't keep love around anymore
I don't keep love around anymore
I don't keep, I don't keep
Love around
