June Haverly,
You always get your way,
But June Haverly,
Not today, no not today

You're on top of the world,
Just trynna stay on track,
And they'll kiss your feet while they stab your back,
And watch you started burn to blazing crying

June Haverly,
You always got your way,
But not today, no not today
No not today

June Haverly,
You're not to blame,
No not to blame
And June Haverly,
Don't be ashamed,
For all the pain

You're on top of the world,
Just trynna stay on track,
And they'll kiss your feet while they stab your back,
And watch you started burn to blazing crying

June Haverly,
We miss you so
Why'd you go?
Oh why'd you go?

You're on top of the world,
Just trynna stay on track,
And they'll kiss your feet while they stab your back,
And watch you started burn to blazing crying

June Haverly,
We miss you so
Why'd you go?
Oh why'd you go?
