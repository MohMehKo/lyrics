Can't keep my hands to myself
No matter how hard I'm trying to
I want you all to myself
You're metaphorical gin and juice
So come on, give me a taste
Of what it's like to be next to you
Won't let one drop go to waste
You're metaphorical gin and juice

Cause all of the downs and the uppers
Keep making love to each other
And I'm trying, I’m trying, I'm trying, I’m trying
All of the downs and the uppers
Keep making love to each other
And I'm trying, I’m trying, I'm trying, I’m trying

Is it too late now to say sorry 
Cause I’m missing more than just your body. Hey!
Is it too late now to say sorry 
Yeah I know, I know, that I let you down 
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now 

Sorry, yeah!
So sorry

My doctor say you're no good
But people say what they wanna say
And you should know if I could
I'd breathe you in every single day

Is it too late now to say sorry 
Cause I’m missing more than just your body. Hey!
Is it too late now to say sorry 
Yeah I know, I know, that I let you down 
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now 

Sorry, yeah!
So sorry
I'm sorry

Yeah I know, I know, that I let you down 
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now

Can't keep my hands to myself
