Oh and I, don't know how to feel
Just like that, 2013, it's been real
Oh and I, think I just shed a tear
2013, it's been a kick ass year

Miley went on twerked on stage,
Made the whole world fill with rage,
But she sold records, like she was taught
And then came around little old Lorde

Speaking of royals, they had a baby
And then came out - Mr. Tom Daley!
The world's realising it's not a choice
I'm still Troye, I just happen to like boys.
(What? I like boys, have you seen their butts? Exactly!)

Robin Thicke went to Number 1
Even though the song was sexist and dumb
Yeah that's right, I'm talking Blurred Lines
But oh shit wait, let's talk about Amanda Bynes!

Everybody says she went a bit koo-koo
Telling Drake he should murder her hoo-hoo
We say she's the one who's going cray,
But here we are asking What The Fox Say?

Oh and I, don't know how to feel
Just like that, 2013, it's been real
Oh and I, think I just shed a tear
2013, it's been a kick ass year

The US Government needed a break,
Probably to go do the Harlem Shake
Catching Fire was good, dudes
Got me as excited as the Dylan Sprouse nudes

The 1D boys said This Is Us
Beyonce dropped an album without a fuss,
Rest in peace to Nelson Mandela,
To you Madiba, we're indebted forever

Oh and I, don't know how to feel
Just like that, 2013, it's been real
Oh and I, think I just shed a tear
2013, it's been a kick ass year

(Now do the Harlem Shake)
Oh and I, don't know how to feel
Just like that, 2013, it's been real
Oh and I, think I just shed a tear
2013, it's been a kick ass year
