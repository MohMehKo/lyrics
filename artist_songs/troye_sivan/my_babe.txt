My babe
Don't stand no cheating
My babe

Oh yeah
She don't stand no cheating
My babe

Oh yeah,
She don't stand no cheating

She don't take none of that
Midnight creepin'
My babe

True little honey
My babe

My babe
I know she love me
My babe

Oh yes
I know she love me
My babe

Oh yes
I know she love me

Don't do nothin but
Kiss and hug me
My babe

True little baby
My babe
