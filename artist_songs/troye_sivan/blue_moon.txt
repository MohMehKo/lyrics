In my free, in my wild.
In my dark, oh we started.
Started to doubt, doubt this fire.
Lighting up our lives, and it kept me up at night.
Crash and burn is all I know,

Those three words, you were my first,
I can't help thinking...

Maybe you were my blue moon,
maybe I let go too soon.
Running from what could be,
so terrified of happy,
how did I come to lose...
My blue moon
My blue moon

Which one of us, went and fucked up?
You and me... I guess it was me.
Don't know a good thing when
it's right in front of me cause I'm so numb.
What have I become?
Oh, cause crash and burn is all I know.
I think that's why I made you go.
Those three words, you were my first,
I can't help thinking...

Maybe you were my blue moon,
maybe I let go too soon.
Running from what could be,
so terrified of happy,
how did I come to lose...
My blue moon
My blue moon
