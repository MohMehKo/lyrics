I think I know all about you 
Who you been 
Where you been 
What you been 
And I can't decide on your rollercoaster ride or your merry-go-'round 
Take me 'round and 'round 
And I'm waiting while you're breaking away 

And if I had to do it over, I'd see you again 
I'd do it right and when we fight I'd let you win 'cause my world is nearly nothing without you in it 
Should-a let it go 
Could-a let it go 
Could-a let you win 

I get a taste of the summer sun every time you walk into my door 
Yeah, we laugh and we tease 
Yeah, you're so easy but I ain't satisfied 'til I make you cry 
And I'm shaking while you're breaking away 

And if I had to do it over, I'd see you again 
I'd do it right and when we fight I'd let you win 'cause my world is nearly nothing without you in it 
Should-a let it go 
Could-a let it go 
Could-a let you win 

You know I'm right baby, most of the time 
Oh baby 
Yeah baby 
You think you're right baby, most of the time 
Oh baby 
Yeah baby 
There's no way (No way), no how (No how) I can live without you now 
Baby, I surrender 
Yeah, I'm throwin' in the towel 
Puttin' my hands up 'cause I need you now 

And if I had to do it over, I'd see you again 
I'd do it right and when we fight I'd let you win 'cause my world is nearly nothing without you in it 
Should-a let it go 
Could-a let it go 
Could-a let you win 
Let you win, let you win 
Let you win, let you win, let you win 
Let you win 
I give in 
Let you win 
Wanna see you again
