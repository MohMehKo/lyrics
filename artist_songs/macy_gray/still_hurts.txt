Looks like things ain't gonna work out quite the way we planned 
Got your bags at the door and now you're leaving me again (Oh baby, baby) 
And I play it cool like I don't care, that's just the way I am 
But inside I wish I had the nuts to ask you for another chance (Oh baby, baby) 
'Cause all I do is wish for you (All I do is wish for you) now that you are gone (Now that you are gone) 
Time should heal and pain should fade and I should move on (I should move on) 
But it still hurts, it still burns 
When it comes to love then I've got a, a lot to learn 
You ain't coming back like I want you to but baby, there's no getting over you and I still hurt 
Yes, I still hurt 
I smile when I look back on the way we were before 
Remember the life I had, the love when I was your girl (Oh baby, baby) 
Nowhere was as lovely as our own little world 
I can't believe I messed up 
I can't believe I'm not your girl 
'Cause all I do is dream of you (All I do is dream of you) now that you are gone (Now that you are gone) 
Time should heal and pain should fade and I should move on (I should move on) 
(Still hurts) It still hurts 
(Still hurts) 
When it comes to love then I've got a, a lot to learn 
You ain't coming back like I want you to but baby, there's no getting over you and I still hurt 
Yes, I still hurt 
I try to fight away this hold you have on me 
I pray, I kick, I scream, baby, I tried everything but I'm hopeless you see 
Stuck on a love that used to be 
Chasing the dream that maybe baby, you would come back to me 
But wait, still hurts, still hurts 
When it comes to love then I've got a, a lot to learn 
You ain't coming back like I want you to but baby, there's no getting over you and I still hurt 
Yes, I still hurt 
Well, it still hurts 
Yes, it still burns 
When it comes to love then I've got a, a lot to learn 
You ain't coming back like I want you to but baby (You ain't coming back), there's no getting over you 
Yes, I still hurt 
Yes, I still hurt (Still hurt, still hurt, still hurt, still hurt)
