When I was 10 I had a live in babysitter, she had a pet
Kangaroo wore big breasts and feathers. She gave me ice
Cream every time I screamed and hollered and I loved her till I 
Caught her sexing my father.

She gonna hurt you daddy never again, she wasn't a friend, so
I killed her. She gonna hurt you daddy never again she wasn't
A friend, so I killed her.

When I was 13 the plumber stopped by, the house was flooding
And no one knew why. Within no time at all he got
Rid of the water and I was grateful till I caught him plunging
My mother.

He gonna hurt you momma never again, he wasn't a friend, so
I killed him. He gonna hurt you momma never again he wasn't
A friend so I killed him, she gonna hurt your daddy never again,
She wasn't a friend, so I killed her. She gonna hurt you daddy 
Never again she wasn't a friend, so I killed her.

And I don't feel bad about it. Say what? And I don't feel bad
About it. These are my fondest childhood memories. I was just
A kid, so they let me go despite the murders that I did - all
Grown up now as u can see, my parents are still happily
Married thanks to me.
