[VERSE]
Ooooh baby I'm my own pedigree
I hang out sometimes, butit's only me with me
It's cool but lately I was wondering
Is this forever and how long will tha be you see

[CHORUS]
One night is all it took
One dance and I was hooked
One look for me to see that
You're esaily the one for me

[VERSE]
Billion of people on planet earth
You're lucky if you find one in your search for
Someone who's true, completes you, love devine
My search is over after all this time it took

[CHORUS]
One night is all it took
One dance and I was hooked
One look for me to see that
You're esaily the one for me
