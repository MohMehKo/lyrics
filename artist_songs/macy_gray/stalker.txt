People say that I'm your stalker, the way I follow you 'round 
You are the only thing that I talk about when I'm talking 
Say my affection (My affection) is too much, you say it's smothering 
And that may be so but who's gonna love you like I do if I go? 
Just like the ocean needs the water and the sea needs a breeze 
Baby, you need me 

I am your submissive ho, I am your desperate bitch and that's alright with me as long as I'm the one you kiss 
I drink you (Drink you), eat you (Eat you), I dream and my love is on fire 
Look away, look away 
Who else you gonna find with dreams like mine? 
Just like the ocean needs the water and the sea needs a breeze 
Baby, you need me (Baby, you need me 

Now baby, if you kick me out now, if you kick me out now, who's gonna wear your tattoo? 
Who's going crazy for you? 
Call you ninety times a day? 
Who's gonna freak you, freak you like the way...? 
And who gonna drive you home tonight? 

Yes you do 
You need me, yes you do 
Yes you do 
Yes you do 
Just like the ocean needs the water and the sea needs a breeze 
Baby, you need me 
Just like the ocean needs the water and the sea needs a breeze 
Baby, you need me 

You need me 
Yes you do 
You need me
