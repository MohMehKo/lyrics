All hail the higher, I'm higher every day and there is a will
There is a skill a powder a pill to make me stay that way.

Happiness for a day or 2, that's my limit I'm a junkie how
'bout you? Someday I'm gonna blow and when I do, happiness
for a day or 2.

Down here for worship I'm higher every day and how much I 
Pray how much I pray that I don't stay that way.

Happiness for a day or 2, that's my limit I'm a junkie how
'bout you? Someday I'm gonna blow and when I do, happiness
for a day or 2.

I was well on my way, yes I was well on my way to the
Sun - to fun.

Happiness for a day or 2, that's my limit I'm a junkie how
'bout you? Someday I'm gonna blow and when I do, I had
the happiness.

I want to know...

Happiness for a day or 2, that's my limit I'm a junkie how
'bout you? Someday I'm gonna blow and when I do, I had the
happiness just like you
