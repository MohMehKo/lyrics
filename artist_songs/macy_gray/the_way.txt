Hey baby
I called to say I gave up that narcotic
But ever since I quit, I ain't got much to say
And I found out that loving a man is overrated
Cause she's been nicer to me than you've been all day

I think of all I lost and all I gave away
And I bang my head and tears fall down my face
I'd like to make it up to all of you that I disappointed
But forgive me love, if I don't show up, I'm looking for the way

To the sky, to the rainbows
Baby, to them pearly gates (the way)
To the mountain top, to my super human state (the way)
And when I get there, will you be there? (the way)
Oh baby, will you be there? Uh-huh! (the way)

I think of all the mistakes that I made
The times I went, when I wish I had stayed
But just like Frank I can truly say
That "I did it my way", did it my way (the way)

I want it, I want it (the way)
I want it (ooh, ooh), I want it
All the people here, they look so happy and successful
Maybe I could be that way if only I knew (the way)

Gonna reside in my dreams, that's where I make it
Where the memory of me is never faded
And I wake up in a nightmare 'cause I
I still ain't satisfied, hey, the way

To the sky, take me to them pearly gates (to them pearly)
To the mountain top, to my super human state (superhuman)
To the rainbows, baby, to the love we make
Hey, yeah! They love! (the way)

To my one day, to my someday, yeah, yeah, yeah (the way)
Yeah, to the big ole' smile, to the big smile on my face (the way)
All the people here, they look so happy and successful (so happy and successful)
Maybe I could be that way if only I knew (I have) (the way)

Eh, ey, baby to the love we make
And will you be there? When I get there, by my side, baby?
Baby take my hand, yeah, yeah (oh)
And show me the way (the way)

I want it, I want it (the way)
I want it, I want it (take my hand and show me) (the way)
All the people here, they look so happy and successful
Maybe I could be that way if only I knew
All the people here, they look so happy and successful
Maybe I could be that way if only I knew
All the people here, they look so happy and successful
