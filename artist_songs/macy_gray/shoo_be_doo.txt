No words explain it
Babe I don't know how to say it
But it makes me shout

I don't know how to say
Baby ain't no word for this
I'm gonna shout it out

I'm hesitating
Don't know how to tell you
That I'm contemplating
Walking out on you

But it's so hard
It's so much that I like about you
At the same time I hate ya
You're always taken me through

Changes and all your rages
Is more than love
I don't know what you call this

No words explain it
Babe I don't know how to say it
But it makes me shout

I don't know how to say
Baby ain't no word for this
I'm gonna shout it out

I finally say it
You'll leave me before I leave you
Oh, my heart can't take it
I'm running after you

But it's so hard it's so much
That I wanna do to you
At the same time, I should shake ya
You're always putting me through

Changes and all your rages
Is more than love
I don't know what you call this

No words explain it
Babe I don't know how to say it
But it makes me shout

I don't know how to say
Baby ain't no word for this
I'm gonna shout it out

Baby you're taken
Whatever its name is
It's blowing up my heart
Changes
Baby I'll take them
Ain't not words for this

No words explain it
Babe I don't know how to say it
But it makes me shout

I don't know how to say
Baby ain't no word for this

No words explain it
Babe I don't know how to say it
But it makes me shout

I don't know how to say
Baby ain't no word for this
I'm gonna shout it out
