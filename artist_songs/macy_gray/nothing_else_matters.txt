So close no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters

Never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words I don't just say
And nothing else matters

Trust I seek and I find in you
Every day for us something new
Open mind for a different view and
And nothing else matters

I never cared for what they do
I never cared for what they know
But I know

So close no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters

I never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words I don't just say
And nothing else matters

I never cared for what they say
I never cared for games they play
I never cared for what they do
I never cared for what they know
But I know

Trust I seek and I find in you
Every day for us something new
Open mind for a different view and
And nothing else matters

I never cared for what they do
I never cared for what they know
But I know
I know
I know
I know
I know
