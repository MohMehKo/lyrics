Look at that boy he got everything
And when I get through he's gonna have me too
Oh mom I found a lover for me yeah
Oh mother sister brother found a lover for me yeah
And then I come to find out he got no romance (Ooooo)
When it comes to love, he's boo boo
He only gets excited when he hears bling bling yeah

Treat Me Like Your Money
Love Me, Need Me, Want Me
Take Me Wherever You Go
Worship Me Your Whole Life
Pray For Me At Night
Treat Me Better Than Anyone You Know
(Better Than Anyone You Know)

(Come Here Baby)

Look at me now I got everything
Been with that boy for awhile now
He gives me Bentleys gives me wedding rings
He gives me inspiration for the song I'm singing
And I have tried to teach him
How to make romance
But you can't buy love so he don't understand it
And every time he comes, he screams: finances!

Girl I love you like money cuz I love you a lot
Now Baby don't ask me because I don't know why
Cuz It's like that (what?) and that's the way it is
