If I had a solution I would
Cut the storm, stop the tears from falling down
But I don't know what to do about it
All I know is I could do without it

Where's the life, where's the love you promised?
I've been good like I should, now I miss sleep
I lose my head when I think about it
I pop the bottle and I drink about it

And I've been waiting for a long time
For the world to change to get it right
You up in the sky, hear me when I say

That I need you now
Yes I need you now
Need your heaven says more than I ever did
Things getting heavy now
Too much to carry now
And I need you now
I need you now

And I've been waiting for a long time
For the world to change to get it right
You up in the sky, hear me when I say

And I need you now
Yes I need you now
Need your heaven says more than I ever did
Things getting heavy now
Too much to carry now
And I need you now
I need you now

Should I shout it out, should I write it down
My heads to the ground so you can see me now
Lord send your blessings down
And don't forget me now
Cause I need you now
I need you now

Hey, hey

I've been good like I should

We're doing all we can
But our angels have given up and ran
And there's nothing I can say about it

And I need you now
Yes I need you now
Need your heaven says more than I ever did
Things getting heavy now
Too much to carry out
And I need you now
I need you now
Should I shout it out should I write it down
My heads to the grass so you can see me now
Lord send your blessings down
And don't forget me now
Cause I need you now
Cause I need you now
Yes I need you now
I need you now
Don't forget me now
I need you now
I need you now
I need you now

Lord send your blessings down
And don't forget me now
Ya don't forget me now
Don't forget me now

Don't forget me now
Don't forget me now

I've been good like I should
Oh ya, alright ok
Don't forget me now
Don't forget me now
Don't forget me now
Cause I need you now
