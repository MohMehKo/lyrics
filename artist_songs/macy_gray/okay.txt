[CHORUS]
I thought I'd die when you left 
But I'm stll taking a breath
I'm okay
Now I'm still here now you're gone and I'll keep singing my song 
I'm okay

[VERSE]
We been fighting, cussing screaming
Tell me love oh what's the reason?
I thought we loved each other so
Been throwing pots and pans not holding hands oh lover tis the season
That I've got to let you go
Shoulda known from the start that you'd tear up my heart, I'll never...

[CHORUS]
I thought I'd die when you left 
But I'm stll taking a breath
I'm okay
Now I'm still here now you're gone and I'll keep singing my song 
I'm okay

[VERSE]
You're bad at cheating
Thought you were different from them all
Now you gotta look your daughter in the eyes and tell her that her daddy's leaving
You're so stereotypical
Shoulda known from the start that you'd tear up my heart, I'll never...

[BRIDGE]
Get up girl and dry your tears it's messed up how he makes you feel
I know you don't wanna be lonely
And what you gonna do for money
But he's lying, cheating on you when you're trying to raise a family
Forget that
Fuck that
You can make it without him...
