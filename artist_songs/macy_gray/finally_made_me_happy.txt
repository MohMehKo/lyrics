Bet you thought I died when you went away,
Thought I'd get drunk in my sorrows and just drift away,
But things has changed from back in the day, beggin' you to stay,
Now I can't wait to see you back and see you leavin' today.

Baby, you finally made me happy,
When you walked out that door,
Baby, you finally made me happy,
When you walked out that door,
All the times you made me cry,
Now all I feel is joy,
And you finally made me happy, baby.

Walkin' through my door bringing jewelleries and stacks,
Tell me you give it all to me if I take you back,
But I'm in my bedroom, baby,
Moaning ooh ooh ooh ooh oooh baby,
That's my new lover under my covers, hollering uh uh uh.

Baby, you finally made me happy,
When you walked out that door,
Baby, you finally made me happy,
When you walked out that door,
All the times you made me cry,
Now all I feel is joy,
And you finally made me happy, baby,
Finally made me happy, baby.

Uuuuuh yeah-yea yeah,
Shoo-du-di-di-doo-doo-doo-dooooh, ooh,
Oouh oh, ooouuh eah, yeah yeah yeah yeaaah.

Finally made me happy,
When you walked out that door,

And you finally made me happy, baby,
Finally made me happy, baby (yeaaaah, yeah yeah yeaaah, ooooh ooooh)
