I get confused baby,
I even fall to pieces,
Living like an overloaded runaway train,
People think that I'm insane.
But I come down yeah,
Ooh when you come around,
All comes together, everything is clear,
Only with you my dear.

Like a voice without a song I ain't much good on my own,
But I sing with you baby, I sing with you.

Me with you,
Nobody in this world like me with you,
Me with you,
I am a groovy power, I am new,
Me with you,
And I am pretty I'm so pretty with you,
Me with you,
Only with you my baby,
Me with you.

People call me wildchild,
They tell me I'm going nowhere,
But maybe baby if they see me with you,
They know I'm coming through.
And I know who I wanna be,
Somebody better than me,
Somebody happy and so satisfied,
Someone like you with me.

Like a voice without a song I ain't much good on my own,
But I sing with you baby, I sing with you.

Me with you,
Nobody in this world like me with you,
Me with you,
I am a groovy power, I am new,
Me with you,
Mmh pretty, I'm pretty pretty with you,
Me with you,
Only with you my baby,
Me with you.

Nobody in this world like me with you,
Me with you,
I am a groovy power, I am new,
Me with you,
Mmh pretty, I'm pretty pretty with you,
Me with you,
Like feet with shoes yeah,
Me with you.

I walk on water,
I'm running farther,
I make the rockest fly.
Ain't no clouds in my sky,
Only joy in my ride.

Nobody in this world like me with you,
I am a groovy power, I am new,
Me with you,
And I am pretty I'm so pretty with you,
Me with you,
Only with you my baby,
Me with you,
Like feet with shoes, yeah,
Me with you,
Cars with tyres,
Streets with fire,
Me with you,
My heart's desire is to be with you,
Me with you,
Yeah, to be with you,
Me with you,
Only with you my baby,
Me with you,
Feet with shoes, yeah.
