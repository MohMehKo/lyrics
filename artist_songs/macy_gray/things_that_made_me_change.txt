Sure would like to see you and visit your big house in the sky. I
Wish you didn't have to leave us, but since you're gone the time
Sure does fly. So I don't get too attached too much anymore,
It's a different world and I'm a different girl.

All the rain and all the pain, I hope it's for the good 'cause
I know I'll never be the same. These are the things that made me
Change, I hope it's for the good 'cause I know I'll never be
The same.

So proud to have your baby till u up and left us alone. Would u
Care that it drove me crazy? I have to make it on my own. So I
Don't get too attached too much anymore it's a different world
And I'm a different girl.

All the rain and all the pain, I hope it's for the good 'cause
I know I'll never be the same. These are things that made me
Change, I hope it's for the good 'cause I know I'll never be
The same.

Pray the lord my soul to keep. I try to hang on to the best of me
But changes keep on changing me. I just want to love who I turn
Out to be. All the rain:don't quite understand it, can't quite
Handle it
