In the wintertime 
Keep your feet warm
But keep your clothes on and don't forget me
Keep the memories
But keep your powder dry too

In the summer by the poolside 
While the fireflies are all around you 
I'll miss you when I'm lonely 
I'll miss the sunshine too

Now don't forget me
Please don't forget me
Make is easy on me just for a little while
You know I think about you 
I hope you'll think about me too

When we're older a little slower
It doesn't matter now come on get happy 
'Cause nothing lasts forever
But I will always love you

Now don't forget me
Please don't forget me
Make is easy on me just for a little while
You know I think about you 
I hope you'll think about me too
