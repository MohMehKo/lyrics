Sure do like the way it's going down with you we could be
Together for years, and I'm ready to make that move cross
That line with we could put some joy in each other's tears.
l.o.v.e. don't sum it up for me it's much m.o.r.e. than any
world could mean.

Baby aaaaah 'cause it's going down - make me sing lala when
You come around - make me say ooooh weee when u look at
Me - baby aaaaaah 'cause it's going down and I'm speechless.

Practicing all day what to say to you, but it never seems to
Come out right, just to know the feeling is so perfect for me and
You and I want to feel it for the rest of my life. l.o.v.e.
Don't sum it up for me it's much m.o.r.e. than any word
Coul d mean.

Baby aaaaah 'cause it's going down - make me sing lala when
You come around - make me say ooooh weee when u look at
Me - baby aaaaaah 'cause it's going down and I'm speechless.

O it's fur sure, there is love then there is something more.
I'm hoping the music can express what I feel when you caress - 
Do you hear it when I scream your name when we're laying?

Sure do like the way it's going down with you we could be
Together for years
