hot like hot wings with hot chocolate in hell
cold like in my isolation cell
in the winter
while kissing mr. freeze
take the weather man
and blow him away
love is a desert and i need it to rain
you are so good at keeping me company

you are relating to a psychopath
your role model is in therapy
you must be real far gone
you're relating to a psychopath

noah's elephants are leaving the ark in eights
during the upside of my manic depressive state
crickets sing in 3 part harmony
i try to walk away
i choke and i stumble
i'm flying back so listen close when i mumble
that you are so good at keeping me company

you are relating to a psychopath
your role model is in therapy
you must be real far gone
you're relating to a psychopath

it never adds up when you do your math
you're relating to a psychopath
yes i'm real far gone
you're relating to a psychopath

medication is slow
and it's when it kicks in
that my mind chooses to go
my feel better begins
just when i get attached
it ends
it's insane
so i remain a psycho

1 2 3 4

cartoon figures dance in my head
i said
love is butter won't you be my bread
you are so good at keeping me company

you are relating to a psychopath
your role model is in therapy
you must be real far gone
you're relating to a psychopath

it never adds up when you do your math
you're relating to a psychopath
yes i'm real far gone
you're relating to a psychopath

oh a psychopath

i am demented
my mind is bendin'
my brain is twisted
baby keep me company

you must be a psycho too
love is butter won't you be my bread
that's what i said
psychotic
psychosis
my manic depressive state is great
on the upside
it's the love side

love is butter won't you be my bread
did you hear what i said
