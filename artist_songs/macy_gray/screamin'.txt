Gone crazy but I guess it don't matter since the work is gonna
End. Gonna make a change at least I'll try to - will they notice

So baby tell me when I'll see you again - it'll all be better.

All of my troubles they go away when you're on top of me loving

Miss my father - when will we get out the mess we're in? all I
Want to do is reach the sky - don't want to have to die to do that

All of my troubles they go away when you're on top of me loving

In each other's arms we're safe. 
Why don't we just stay that Way? - making love and loving all the time.
