Hey big rocker, could you shine the light? 
I have lost track of what's wrong from right 
It's days like these that I wanna die 
It's days like days like these that make me cry all day 
And I have to say that I don't know where I'm going 
And maybe if I had more money, maybe if I was more pretty... 
I'm going in circles when it hits me that I don't, I don't know where I'm going (Where I'm going) 
All you big rockers, stay hot, hot, hot 
Look at how they leave you when you're not, not, not 
And hey baby, if I comeback (I comeback), would you take me back
(Take me back) if I told you that I haven't changed a bit? 
Baby, would you go for it? (Would you go for it?) 
Would you take me back if I told you that? 
Oh baby 

Hey big world, it's me again 
I'm coming way back to be big again 
Gonna make it like it was in the beginning 'cause I'm missing all my fair-weather friend 
And since you let me go, wanna let you know that I don't know where I'm going 
And maybe if you knew about my history you wouldn't 've been such a big bitch to me 
I'm blinded by the light when I finally see that I don't, I don't know where I'm going (Where I'm going) 
And all you big rockers, stay hot, hot, hot 
Look at how they leave you when you're not, not, not 

And hey baby, if I comeback (I comeback), would you take me back
(Take me back) if I told you that I haven't changed a bit? 
Baby, would you go for it? (Would you go for it?) 
Would you take me back if I told you that? 
Oh baby 

Maybe if I had more money, maybe if I was more pretty... 
I'm going in circles when it hits me that I don't, I don't know where I'm going 
But I do know that I'm here to stay 
Been up, down and sideways 
No matter way I'll stay 
I'm staying 
(And hey baby) Comeback (If I comeback) 
Take me back (Take me back) if I told you that I haven't changed one bit? 
(Would you go for it?) Would you go for me? 
Take me back 
Oh baby 

(If I comeback) 
(Take me back) Take me back 
Yeah, I wanna tell you that 
(Would you go for it?) Would you go for me and take me back? 
Oh baby 

Oh baby 
Oh baby
