[Macy:]
I know a place all the beautiful people congregate
This is your invite to party
It will never end, so don't be late

Heaven ain't so far away
It's what you do, it's what you create
And you're winning when you feel it
Begin and you will feel it
Love yourself and now you're free

Go throw your head back, say, "Oh, yeah!" (From your heart)
Go throw your head back, say, "Oh, yeah!" (From your heart)
Mmm, baby, do you feel me? (From my heart)
Go throw your head back, say, "Oh, yeah!" (From your heart)
Oh, yeah (From your heart)
Oh, yeah (From your heart)
Go throw your head back, say, "Oh, yeah!" (From your heart)

[Keziah:]
We're gonna take you higher
Where all the lovin' people congregate
It's time to stop all the fighting
Set the whole world with the love we make, yeah, yeah, yeah

Heaven ain't so far away
It's what you do, it's what you create
And you're winning when you feel it
Begin and you will feel it
Love yourself and now you're free

Go throw your head back, say, "Oh, yeah!" (From your heart)
Throw your head back, say, "Oh, yeah!" (From your heart)
