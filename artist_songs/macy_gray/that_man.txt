We always rock around 
We always rock around 

We gonna rock around 
We always rock around 
I was so happy 'bout the love I found 'til I went to the library and I saw him 
Sayin', "Oh yeah 
Oh yeah, I want that man" 

He stole my heart and he's killing me softly 
He stole my heart and he's killing me softly 
She said, "Oh, if he's stealin' and killin' then he must be a black man" (A black man) 
He's my brand new Ferrari 
He's my piece of cake 
My personal president of the United States 

Hey baby, hey daddy, hey sugar, you sure are a looker in your bling-bling chain and your Gucci shades 
He got the custom Range Rover 
I think I'm comin' over, saying, "Oh yeah 
Oh yeah, I want that man" 

I'm gonna say it loud 
I'm gonna say it loud 
I was so happy 'bout the love I found 
See, I went to the museum and I saw him 

Oh yeah 
Oh yeah, I want that man 

He wrote me poetry and bought me a car 
He wrote me poetry and bought me a car 
She said, "Oh, if he wrote you poetry and bought you a car, he must be a nice man" 
He's my brand new Mercedes 
He's my piece of pie 
He's my very own personal jesus christ 

Hey baby, hey daddy, hey sugar, you sure are a looker in your bling-bling chain and your Gucci shades 
He got the custom Range Rover 
I think I'm comin' over, saying, "Oh yeah 
Oh yeah, I want that man" (That man) 

Hey baby, baby, I've been lookin' all over the world 
You be my man, I will be your girl 
I think together we could go real far 
Especially if we had a jet, private 
You can get it, you bet it 
Hey baby, baby, I've been lookin' all over the world 
You be my man, I will be your girl 

Extraordinary (That man) 
I wanna marry (That man) 
Hey daddy, hey sugar (That man), yeah, you sure are a looker (That man) 
When I look at you, all I have to say is, "That man"
