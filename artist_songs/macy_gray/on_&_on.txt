I've been drinking, I'm high 
I have a lot to say 
I never get so down as when you go away 
From the bottom of my heart, from the red of my blood, what I feel is real 
Baby, I'm in love 

I want cha, I need ya, I love ya (On and on and on) 
I wanna discuss the future 
Can't get enough (On and on and on) 
Your body baby, makes me... (On and on and on) 
I could (I could) go on and on 
On and on about how I feel about you (On and on with you) 

There's no end in sight 
I can't imagine what my life would be like 
I wanna talk about the future 
From the bottom of my heart, the red of my blood 
Baby, I'm in love 
(You) Yeah, summertime it's (You) 
Oh, winter time and it's you (You) baby (Yes you), all the time 
And you (You) stay on my mind 

I want cha (Ooh girl), I need ya (I love you baby), I love ya (I need you baby) 
(On and on and on) 
I wanna discuss the future (I love you baby) 
Can't get enough (I wanna talk about all things) 
(On and on and on) 
Your body baby (Your body), makes me... 
(On and on and on) 
I could go on and on 
(On and on) 
(On and on with you) 
I want cha, I need ya (Girl), I love ya (Girl) 
(On and on and on) 
I wanna discuss the future 
Can't get enough (On and on and on with you) 
When I see you wanna pull my skirt up, got me feeling like I'm 'bout to burn up 
Got me feeling high 
Baby, put your hands up 'cause baby, it's a hold-up 
So love me, I can make you love me 
Always into me 
You're what I want, what I need 
Love what you're doing to me 
I want cha (Yeah, I want ya baby), I need ya, I love ya (I need you baby) 
(On and on and on) 
I wanna discuss the future (I love ya baby) 
Can't get enough (On and on and on) 
Your body baby (Oh, your body makes me), makes me... (On and on and on) 
(On and on) I could (On and on) go on and on 
(On and on, on and on with you) 

Girl, your sight baby, hit me down, baby all the time 
On and on 
I wanna talk about the future, all night
