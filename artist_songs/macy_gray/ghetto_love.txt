Lately I been high stepping
I gotta lover who is ghetto for real
Take me to movies and he's carrying steel
Lord of the corner, king of the block
Lacing his lady with chinchillas and rocks
And he's all I want in my world

Ghetto Love
G-H-E-T-T-O
We get high together
G-H-E-T-T-O

Lately I been high stepping
Lord of my bod, king of my heart
Gangster by day, Hennesy passion by dark
They try to beat us but they can't
We don't give a fuck
They try to beat us but they can't
We don't give a fuck
And he's all I want in my world

Ghetto Love
G-H-E-T-T-O
We get high together
G-H-E-T-T-O

I never worry when he's gone till November
He taught me how to keep my hands on the trigger
