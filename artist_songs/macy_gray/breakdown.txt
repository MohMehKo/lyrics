This is my breakdown
Jesus hates me and the world with him
I'm nowhere to be found
And I've looked in all the places I've been
The sweetest one
And your arms are up and down
Your love all over
You are doing everything you wanted to
And I'm in love

So don't interrupt my sleep before you
Leave me baby, I'm dreamin' baby
Dreamin' that when I wake up
I see you baby, and I see you right now

Love broke your head back
Screamed out loud and God will hear you

Mud on my face
A broken back because I fell from his grace
No more give or take
I'm on my own even the devil has gone away
Our real love was on my arms once that's a real love
I'm by myself, bout to shoot myself
Cuz I can't help and I break down in love

So don't interrupt my sleep before you
Leave me baby, I'm dreamin' baby
Dreamin' that when I wake up
I see you baby, and I see you baby

Love broke your head back
Screamed out loud and God will hear you

This is my breakdown

So don't interrupt my sleep before you
Leave me baby, I'm dreamin' baby
Dreamin' that when I wake up
I see you baby, and I see you baby

Love broke your head back
Screamed out loud and God will hear you
