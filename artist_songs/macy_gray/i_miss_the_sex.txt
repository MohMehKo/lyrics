Say say say leaver, Yeah u left me alone
For a young bitch with a lighter skin tone
I wanna be her, when you've been home
You know Imma hold u tight, tell ya everything u do is right
But I know ya and I love ya and all the bullshit that u do
There's sunshine in my parlour now that I'm without you

But I... miss the sex,
Yeh I... miss the sex

Say say say reader, yeh you're reading it wrong
Extra extra, I'm the one you adore
Yeh yeh fever, I'm sick and alone
Ain't had a kiss like that since he been gone

But remember, he's a hitter, all the bullshit that he do
And there's sunshine in my parlour now that I'm without you

But I... miss the sex
And I... miss the sex

Say say say loser, how you choose her over me
I'm the one that's been through it all and I pay for everything
When you do her do you ever think of me
Then again do you ever think of me

He's a loser and he choosed her, Why am i still holding on
Cos there's sunshine in my parlour, ever since he's been gone

But I... miss the sex,
yeh I... miss the sex

Nobody do me like he do me, since he's been gone
Nobody kiss me like he kiss me, since he been gone
And I... miss the sex,
yeh there's sunshine in the parlour
Feeling good on the hour since he's been gone
But I miss the sex
