you must be smellin' cherries and strawberries and peaches
and plums
roses and dandelions

special lovin' on the nite I spent with you
it was the best that I've had lately
but it didn't mean anything
and I will be glad when you stop callin' me

harry
don't wanna be your girlfriend
but boy when you want the lovin'
come and see me harry

swore my ever lasting true love to you
said that I need ya I want ya didn't I baby
but I was just kiddin' 'round
and I will be glad when you stop callin' my house

harry
don't wanna be your girlfriend
but boy when you want the lovin'
come and see me harry

it's a shame harry
cause you such a beautiful thing harry
you tell em that you love and I bet you do
but love's not my thing right now harry
all I wanna do is swing
and when you're ready
I'm here for you

please harry
stop callin' me

harry
don't wanna be your girlfriend
but boy when you want the lovin'
feel free to come and see me harry
