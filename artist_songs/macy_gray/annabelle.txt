All I know of love is what they taught me
I loved all my guns until they shot me

My heart, so weak, so heavy, oh yeah
Kiss me, now leave me, my sweet torture

Annabelle Annabelle
I don't want you no more, don't come around here,
Annabelle Annabelle
I don't want you no more Annabelle

I looked so damm fine the day I met you
you went right through me and I let you

My heart, so weak, so heavy, oh yeah
Kiss me, now leave me, my sweet torture

Annabelle Annabelle
I don't want you no more, don't come around here,
Annabelle Annabelle
I don't want you no more Annabelle

I tried and I tried and I tried and I tried and I tried
(This is my quit day)
And I lied and I lied and I lied and I lied and I lied
(I said that yesterday)
I tried and I tried and I tried and I tried and I tried
(I'm quitting, I'm quitting, I'm fixing to quit)
And I lied and I lied and I lied and I lied and I lied
I'm in hell, Annabelle,
Up in hell

Annabelle Annabelle
I don't want you no more, don't come around here,
Annabelle Annabelle
I don't want you no more
Annabelle
