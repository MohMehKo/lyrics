It's a sad, sad day when the thing you love, my love, brings you to your knees, my love 
Beats you down and eats you up 'til you're nothing 
But they say, they say I'm to far left 
At least I ain't someone else 'cause I can't change it and it ain't strange if I'm just being myself 
The say I'm too far gone 
Well, I say that they're wrong 'cause who are they to say who I should be and where I'm goin' 
Am I goin' to heaven? (Am I goin' to heaven?) 
Am I goin' to hell? (Am I goin' to hell?) 
See, when I wake up in the morning, I just can't tell 
I can't help myself (I just can't tell) 
Some say I'm bad (Some say I'm bad) 
Some say I'm good (Some say I'm good) 
Some they think I'm just a psycho broad but I'm just misunderstood 
Yeah, I'm misunderstood 
So can somebody help me? (Help me, help me, help me) 
So can somebody help me? (Help me, help me, help me) 
(Help me, help me, help me) Somebody help me 
Really help (Help me, help me) 
(Somebody) Help me, help me, help me, help me 
If I change, change, change, if I switch off my delivery
(I switch off my delivery), will you, my love, remember me (Remember me) when I'm dead and gone 
They say I'm dead and gone, they say 
They say I'm to far left 
At least I ain't someone else 'cause I can't change it and it ain't strange if I'm just being myself (I'm just being myself) 
The say I'm too far gone (The say I'm too far gone) 
I say that they're wrong (I say that they're wrong) 
'Cause who are they to say who I should be and where I'm goin' (And where I'm goin') 
Am I goin' to heaven? (Am I goin' to heaven?) 
Am I goin' to hell? (Am I goin' to hell?) 
See, when I wake up in the morning, I just can't tell 
I can't help myself (I just can't tell) 
Some say I'm bad (I'm bad) (Some say I'm bad) 
Some say I'm good (Some say I'm good) 
Some they think I'm just a psycho broad but I'm just misunderstood 
Yeah, I'm misunderstood 
Hey, lets go, somebody help me? (Help me, help me), alright 
(Help me, help me) Will somebody help me? (Help me, help me, help me) 
((Somebody) Help me, help me, help me, help me) Reach out your hand and help me 
Oh, to lean, to lean on your shoulder now 
I tried to follow but it don't fit me 
See, I'm hard to swallow 'cause they don't get me 
And my soul is shifted 
I call it unique but I guess I don't know 
Oh, oh, so can somebody help me, help me, help me, help me (Somebody help me) 
Help me, help me, help me, help me 
(Somebody) Help me, help me, help me 
(Somebody) Won't you help me, help me, help me, help me now? 
Won't somebody help me, help me, help me, help me? 
Won't somebody help me, help me, help me, help me? (Fighting it your best chance) 
Won't somebody help me, help me, help me, help me? 
Won't somebody help me, help me? 
One two three four 
Somebody help me (C'mon) 
Somebody help me (Now c'mon baby) 
Somebody help me (You never let me down) 
Somebody help me (Sayin', "Please") 
Somebody help me (I'm sayin', "Alright") 
Somebody help me (I need your helpin' now) 
Somebody help me (Yeah, yeah, yeah) 
Somebody help me (Yeah, yeah, yeah) 
Somebody help me (I heard some crackers now) 
Somebody help me (I said, "Nuts to you") 
Somebody help me (You eatin' some dinner) 
Somebody help me (Something so "Hot") 
Somebody help me (I don't eat soul food) 
Somebody help me (And I'm gonna be so hot) 
Somebody help me (I need some....) 
Somebody help me 
Somebody help me (I need some....)
