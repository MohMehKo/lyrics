we need the honey like the bees
gimme sound
need to be touched by you but you're not around
forgiveness
please save some for me
wash me down
till I'm new
till I'm pleasing you
till I am nothing but true
please save a little for me
where is the forgiveness that you promised me
am I too late
gone astray
misplaced the keys to all my churches
seems I've chased all my angels away
so I bleed
gimme speed
while I'm running back to you
and I'll be nothing but true true
me you choose
see I was hopin' I could walk on your water with you

forgiveness
please send some down for me
where is the forgiveness that you promised me
am I too late
and I've learned to be still when the beast within me moves
and I'll be nothing but true
