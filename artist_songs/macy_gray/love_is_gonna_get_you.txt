I want too much to be with you
But I'm working night and day
I came all this way to see you
And you tell me you need space
Everyone I know is compatible with somebody I know
I can never get it right
And I don't know where to go
Stay away from me don't you ever leave me alone, NO

Love is gonna get you baby
Someday, one day, it will be
A good love that gets me
Love is gonna get ya baby
Someday, one day, I will find
Somebody for me

I have talked to all the experts,
all the psychics...I've loved
I have prayed for all the answers
To the game of love above
They all say it's unanimous
There's somebody for me
But none of them will tell me
When it is, where he might be
I want to be with you, I just won't to be alone.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah!

Love is gonna get you baby
Someday, one day, it will be
A good love that gets me
Love is gonna get ya baby
Someday, one day, I will find
Somebody for me

I believe in destiny
I believe it sets me free
Come and save me with your kiss
Been on my best behavior
Friends say I'm looking greater
Won't you, won't you, just save me with your kiss
Save me with your kiss
Won't you just save me with your kiss?

Love is gonna get you baby
Someday, one day, it will be
A good love that gets me
Love is gonna get you baby
Someday, one day, it will be
A good love that gets me
Love is gonna get ya baby
Someday, one day, I will find
Somebody for me
