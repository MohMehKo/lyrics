Everytime the phone rings I hope that is you
It's not you baby, it's not you baby
I find that, we are talking lesser and lesser
You don't hit me back when I text ya
And I don't need no glasses to see
That you are walking away from me
You are gone baby, you leave me you must be crazy
See I've got plenty to do, to keep my mind off from you

But baby it's the heart, that takes the hit
It won't forget, 
Baby, baby it's the heart
That wants you still
Always will
Baby...

I really thought by now that you would miss me
Yes you came up and trying to fix me
Is it the way that I dress, is I too jealous, 
was it my Grace Jones collection
But woo baby baby babe you should see me now
I wish you come over and see me now
You are gone baby, you leave me you must be crazy
See I've got plenty to do, to keep my mind off from you

But baby it's the heart, that takes the hit
It won't forget
Baby, baby it's the heart
That never meant
It won't bend
Baby baby...

I'm begging
Please don't you baby, don't baby
I'm begging
Please don't you leave, don't you leave
Don't you leave...

Baby, baby it's the heart
That knows you will
I know you will
Baby, baby it's the heart
That wants you still
Always will
Baby, baby it's the heart, that takes the hit
It won't forget
Oh baby, baby my heart
That loves you still
And always will
Baby, baby it's my heart
That loves you still
I love you still
Baby, baby my heart
It wants you still
Always will...
