It don't always come naturally
Sometimes you got to dig in the dirt to get what you need
What I need, I need is you
And I'm gonna all long to be with you. Yeah

Bang bang I want it
Shoot me down and I want it
When I tell him that I want it
He says louder
Bang bang I want it
Shoot me down and I want it
When I tell him that I want it
He says louder
Louder
Louder

Tell me baby do you love as hard as I do
Is there a lightning striking inside of you
Does the thunder roll
Does the fire keep you cool
Cause a hurricane is coming for you

Bang bang I want it
Shoot me down and I want it
When I tell him that I want it
He says louder
Bang bang I want it
Shoot me down and I want it
When I tell him that I want it
He says louder
Louder
Louder

For your love [x3]

More
I'll put my whole heart beating to
Oh oh cause I'm in it
I'll be there for you
To the finish
Going on
Are you in it
Are you in it
Louder

Is that what you need
Is that is that is that what you want
Is that is that is that what you need
Is that is that is that what you want
Is that is that is that what you need

Bang bang I want it
Shoot me down and I want it
When I tell him that I want it
He says louder
Bang bang I want it
Shoot me down and I want it
When I tell him that I want it
He says louder
Louder
