I made it to my space ship
And rising all day
I don't know that I don't know
So everything is going my way!
And when you fly by pick me up
I got the giggles
Baby I'm load to fun
So when you fly by, pick me up
I'm stoned!
Stoned stoned stoned

Silence, in the silence
I can't hear my friends
Lend on Moon, on the sky maroon
Singing all I do is win!
So when you fly by pick me up
I got the giggles
Baby I'm load to fun
So when you fly by, pick me up
I'm stoned!
Stoned stoned stoned stoned stoned

I stayed up all night just to look at you, baby
To feel your lightening and your thunder
And I smoke, I smoke but there's no forgetting you babe
Isn't that a wander? A wonder?
Where were last night?!
I was waiting for you, you, youuu
Stoned, I'm stoned
Stoned, I'm stoned
Stoned stoned stoned stoned stoned
