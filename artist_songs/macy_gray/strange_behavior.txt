[Macy]
This is the story,
about two people
in love.

We were happily married,
Until he waved a gun at me.
I said whats with all your strange behavior.

He said I love you babay
But you got a big insurance policy
And I really
Need the paper.

[Chorus]

Strange behavior by the sea. (se-e-e)
He'd be here
But he's deceased
Strange behavior

[Macy]
I had a big insurance policy
And he had a big insurance policy,
Too!

I said baby if you get a job
You would not have to shoot me now.
He said Oh My God Your such a hata.
But then he chickened out,
I took the gun and shot him down
Cuz I really need the papa.

[Chorus]

Strange behavior by the sea. (se-e-e)
He'd be here
But he's deceased
Strange behavior

[Macy]
What was I to do
Sometimes its me or you
I swear that I loved you baby
All I have to say so
I say so
cuz Im rich now

SHHHHHHHHH

Drove his body to the sea
Iissed him on his cold cheek
I said I guess I see you later

And the people all asking me
I say he'd be here but he deceased

Then I go and spend my papa-a
Oh oh oh

[Chorus]

Strange behavior by the sea. (se-e-e)
He'd be here
But he's deceased
Strange behavior

He'd be here
He'd be here

He's dead!
