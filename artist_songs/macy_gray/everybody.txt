Get on the dance floor and shake it with me
Well shut your mouth stop all that complaining
About the world and all the suffering
We are so sick of all your opinions 
Ain't what you say it's what you do with your guns

Do it like this and we do it like that
Takes more to win than a few good men
Everybody Everybody Everybody Everybody
Get up get out and do something,
go do your part start chipping in

YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH

Live for yourself and you will live in vain
You live for others you will live again
You're either enemy or you are the friend
You're talking talking we'll be glad when you're done
Ain't what you say it's what you do with your love

Do it like this and we do it like that
Takes more to win than a few good men
Everybody Everybody Everybody Everybody
Get up get out and do something,
go do your part start chipping in

YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH

Live for yourself and you will live in vain
You live for others you will live again
You're either enemy or you are the friend

Everybody Everybody Everybody Everybody
Get up get out and do something,
go do your part start chipping in
Everybody (Yeah Yeah)
