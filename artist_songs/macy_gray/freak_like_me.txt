sorry that I'm late
I been searchin' for something great
something to fill me up
he said join the club
then we made love till my body ached

and baby when you have the time
I wanna tell you what is on my mind
I gotta get it off
cause it's so heavy
after what we did the other night
I wanna be with you for all my life
I'm so glad you're a freak like me

someone be a true one
see the last one made me cry
all the time my love
he said join the club
and we make love till
my emotions rise

my emotions rise

and baby when you have the time
I wanna tell you what is on my mind
I gotta get it off
cause it's so heavy
after what we did the other night
I wanna be with you for all my life
I'm so glad you're a freak like me
love like I dream of
like they sing of in the beautiful song
feeling it deep tonight
and I'd rather die
than be without you when the morning comes
you make me feel like my search is done

baby when you have the time
I wanna tell you what is on my mind
I gotta get it off
cause it's so heavy
after what we did the other night
I wanna be with you for all my life
I'm so glad you're a freak like me
