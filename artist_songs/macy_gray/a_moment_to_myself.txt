I saw a rainbow earlier today 
Lately those rainbow be comin' round like everyday 
Deep in the struggle I have found the beauty of me 
God is watchin and the devil finally let me be 
Here in this moment to myself 
I'm gonna vibe with no one else 
There is a conversation I need to have with me 
It's just a moment to myself 

There're all looking at you, you're got everything to lose 
Get up and dance girl, sing your tu-rah-loo-rah-loo 
And quit bitchin bout how don't nobody really love you 
Spread your rubber lovin and it bounces back to you 
Here in this moment to myself 
I'm gonna vibe with no one else 
There is a conversation I need to have with me 
It's just a moment to myself 

Flowers are bloomin under gray skies and moons 
Seems like I'm winnin everytime I lose 
And the answer I been looking for been here all this time 
Spread your rubber lovin and it bounces back to you 
Here in this moment to myself 
I'm gonna vibe with no one else 
There is a conversation I need to have with me 
It's just a moment to myself
