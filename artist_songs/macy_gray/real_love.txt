I know why you hesitate, burned by all the fake lovers that you had before 
They put you down and gave you hate 
Don't believe the things they say 'cause baby, you're a dream, you're a score 
'Cause I would walk a million miles for you, just to visit you, baby 
And I'll show you a trillion stars, the Moon is ours 

Darlin', I, I'm everlasting 
I'm a sure thing 
I'm the master 
Giving you real, real, real love 
And it's yours for the asking 
I put everything after 
Giving you real, real, real love 

Baby, I will kiss you, even when you have the flu 
I'll be good to you when you're bad 
Love you, love you baby 
Lay you down and save you 
I'm you super hero 
I'm a fan, I'm a fan 
And I would walk a million miles for you, just to visit you, baby 
And I'll show you a trillion stars, the Moon is ours 

Darlin', I, I'm everlasting 
I'm a sure thing 
I'm the master 
Giving you real, real, real love 
And it's yours for the asking 
I put everything after 
Giving you real, real, real love 

Lonely baby (Baby ah), I have to be where you are (Be where you are) 
We are like a shooting star (Shooting star) 
Jump in my fast car 
Baby, I'll take you forever 
I'm making you mine, baby, for life (I'm making you mine), for life 

Darlin', I, I'm everlasting 
I'm a sure thing 
I'm the master 
Giving you real, real, real love (Real, real, real love) 
And it's yours for the asking 
I put everything after 
Giving you real, real, real love 
(Real love) 
Givin' ya, givin' ya, givin' ya (Baby I'm in love), givin' ya 
Giving you, giving you (Givin' ya, givin' ya, givin' ya), real, real, real love 
Giving you, I'm giving you (Givin' ya, givin' ya, givin' ya), real, real, real love 
I'm giving you (Givin' ya, givin' ya, givin' ya), real, real, real love
