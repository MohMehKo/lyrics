this track here may cause concern
for all ring leaders
why don't you listen and learn
love peace happiness once was strong
but due to society
even that's turned wrong

why?

don't be a dumb dummy
and disrespect mommy
why?
she put you on earth
and loved you since birth
and you

hey young world
the world is yours
hey young world
the world is yours
young world young world
young world young world

reward is a brainwashed kid gone wild
young little girls already have a child
bad company and now you've been framed
parents are hurting so hurted and ashamed
why?
hell lil kids don't follow these dopes
why?
don't be a fool like those who ditch school
it's yours

hey young world
the world is yours
hey young world
the world is yours
young world young world

get ahead
and accomplish things
you'll see the wonder and the joy life brings
don't admire thieves they don't admire you
their times are limited
and hardrocks too
listen be strong
and scream
woopie doo
go for yours
cause dreams come true
you'll make your mommy so proud of you too
and this is a message that the ruler rick threw

why?

(slick rick)
elders see our wise ones grow
interest in what their kid learned 'bout
seen how the offspring turned out
knowing you can now safeguard self
put upon an exciting path
you see immense pride they'll have

hey young world
the world is yours
hey young world
the world is yours
young world young world

don't discipline rule soundly
kids that we have lose boundaries
grow into what's called curse race lack independence
worst case imprisonment death near for
not what we brought kids here for
norals and values of sorts should be the first thing installed

believe it or not
god still shines on you
he guides you
and he watched you as you grew
stay out of trouble
when it comes insight
cause a man never loses a fight in god's sight
