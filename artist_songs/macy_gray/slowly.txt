Would it be so bad if we just stopped for a while
And enjoyed the thrills we could all be still let the world just pass us by
But it's all hurry hurry run run there's no time for this
We want more and more got to win got to score so afraid of what we'll miss
And it moves so fast
Nothing lasts
This too here will come to pass
Wanna spend my days away from all the fuss
Wanna spend them with you baby but you're in a rush

Slowly
Why can't we just take our time
Slowly
I wish that we could take our time

Yeah we're all getting older realize there's no fountain of youth
This is it came quick it's a lift it's a bitch it's your moment what you gonna do
Yeah time would you be a friend oooh bless us with the chance
To really grow up could you slow it up would you postpone the end
Cuz you move so fast
Nothing lasts
This too here will come to pass
Wanna spend my days away from all the fuss
Wanna spend them with you baby but you're in a rush

Slowly
Why can't we just take our time
Slowly
I wish that we could take our time

Cuz you move so fast
Nothing lasts
This too here will come to pass
And it flies and it rolls like the storms and the thunders
Stop and love me baby
Our days are numbered

Slowly
Why can't we just take our time
Slowly
I wish that we could take our time

Stop and love me baby
Our days are numbered
Take my time
Slow it down
Slowly
