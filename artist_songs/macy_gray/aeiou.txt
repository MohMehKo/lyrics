Why you gotta act this way babe
When you know my lovin' don't change?
Why you gotta make it all so hard? It's so simple
Long as there is breakfast in the morning
Good lovin' whenever you want it
You should know exactly how I feel

All I'm saying is:
I could try to find another guy
That would only be a waste of time
Nobody else can lay it down like you do

Hey, all my love is for ya
Every time I lay my eyes upon ya
I wanna do you good
Round and round and round and round, boy you don't stop
Oh baby I'm candy store
One for your all night longing
You got me baby
You go round and round and round
And round and round again

I know I've been gone a while but
All I do is think of your touch
Sometimes I even have to touch myself
It's that serious
And there you go, starting a fight
And I just wanna see you tonight
Let me show you just how I feel

All I'm saying:
I could try to find another guy
That would only be a waste of time
Nobody else can lay it down like you do (You do, you do)

Hey, hey, hey (Hey, all my love is for ya)
All my love is for ya
Every time I lay my eyes upon ya (Yeah)
I wanna do you good
Round and round and round and round, boy you don't stop
Oh baby I'm candy store (Candy store)
One for your all night longing (All night longing)
You got me baby (You got me)
You go round and round and round (You got me)
And round and round again

We're so good for one and other, baby can't you see?
Mama's down a ride (If it down a ride)
Won't you role with me? (Won't you come and role with me?)
True love ain't complicated, it's like your ABCs
Baby, you've got me, you've got me

(A) All my love is for ya
(E) Every time I lay my eyes upon ya, (I) I wanna do ya good
Round and round and round and round, boy you don't stop
(O) Oh baby I'm candy store
(U) One for your all night longing (Sometimes why?)
You got me baby (You got me baby)
You go round and round and round (Why you got to make it so hard?)
And round and round again

Hey, all my love is for ya (It's so simple)
Every time I lay my eyes upon ya (It's like your ABCs)
I wanna do ya (It's like your one two threes)
You go round and round and round and round
Boy you don't stop (Hey, don't stop)
Oh baby I'm candy store (Hey, don't stop)
One for your all night longing, you got me baby (You got me baby)

You go round and round and round
And round and round again (Baby I love you)
You go round and round and round
And round and round again (Baby I love you)
(Yeah, you go round and round and up and down)
