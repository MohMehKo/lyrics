When they come like left for day
I bet not in my head
And now I wanna be bigger, bein' here with you
It's not so hard to be
I can see in my dream, I know I'm gonna be better
My friends always say

[Hook]
My friends always say..ey..ae.
That every thing will be ok
But it don't always work out that way
Show in my famagam'
Me living in, cuz I'll remember when baby

[Chorus]
I am.., the top of my life
Everything is right, with you
After all that I'd been through (yeah)
I ain't try to loose
This times of my life, with you
When they come like left for day
I bet not in my head
And now I wanna be bigger, bein' here with you
It's not so hard to be

My friends always say

[Hook]
My friends always say...
That every thing will be ok
But it don't always work out that way
So here I am again,
Believin in, cuz I remember when baby

[Chorus]
