i have finally faced it
the well is dry
and we're not gonna make it
out of the war alive
he brings me close and says to me
lets make this a happy ending
and try to stay friends
but you see
if this love affair was happy
then it would not end

and i don't wanna be
one of your friends
if we must break up
then that's where it ends

so please don't come around
bringing me down
listening for your love
i don't hear a sound
please don't come around
bringing me down
tossin' and turnin'
my smile's upside down

don't invite me out to dinner
don't call me on the phone
you wanted to leave me baby
so won't you leave me alone

so please don't come around
bringing me down
listening for your love
i don't hear a sound
please don't come around
bringing me down
tossin' and turnin'
my smile's upside down

it's all or nothing
we'll be one or none
right now you need to know
that I cannot begin again
after what just happened
this ain't no tv show
my heart's completely broke
so...

so please don't come around
bringing me down
listening for your love
i don't hear a sound
please don't come around
bringing me down
tossin' and turnin'
my smile's upside down

and i miss your love baby
and i miss your lovin'
so stay away from me
