Why do you keep looking out the window?
Is it something left behind or never found?
Hmm, do I even want to know?
Oh, if you knew what I was thinking
I wonder if it'd even draw a dear
Oh, there's just one way to find out
Go, Go, Go

Did Sirens steal your heart when you were looking?
Where'd you learn to lie the way you do?
Look's like you made up your mind
I'd have to say I didn't see this coming
But who does?
You won't want to see me standing in the door
So
Go, Go, Go

[Joy:] I don't want to hurt you
[John:] Do you ever listen?
[Joy:] I don't want to run
[John:] You're not the only one
[Joy:] I don't want to touch you
[John:] I'm tired of being broken
[Joy:] Oh, Look what we've become!
[John:] Look what we've become
[Joy:] I don't even care
[John:] I don't really need you
[Joy:] I don't want to
Go, Go, Go

[Joy:] I don't want to go
[John:] I don't want to stay
[Joy:] I don't want to stay
[John:] I don't want to go
