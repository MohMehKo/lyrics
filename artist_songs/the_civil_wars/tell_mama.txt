You thought you'd found, found a good girl
One to love you and give you the world
Now you find that you’ve been misused
Talk to me, I’ll do what you choose
I want you to…

Tell mama all about it
Tell mama what you need
Tell mama
And I’ll make everything alright

That girl you had didn’t have no sense
She wasn’t worth all the time you spent
She had another man throw you outdoors
And now that same man is wearing your clothes

Tell mama all about it
Tell mama what you need
Tell mama
And I’ll make everything alright

She'd embarrass you anywhere
She’d let everybody know she didn’t care
But give me a chance, I’m beggin’ you
And I just wanna take care, take care of you

Tell mama what you need
Tell mama what you need
Tell mama and I'll make everything
I'll make everything,
I'll make everything alright
