Draw me a map that I can hold
Lines that tell me where to go
My head is full of lonely harmonies
And questions no one's asking me

Who's gonna take my hand, show me the way?
How long will I have to wait for someday?

It's not the sky I'm asking for
I'm just having trouble finding north
I've gone as far as I can go
Trying to find something that feels like home

Who's gonna take my hand, show me the way?
How long will I have to wait for someday?

One more sunset runs away
Becomes another yesterday
I'm still waiting

Won't someone wake me up, open these eyes?
Won't someone even try?

Who's gonna take my hand, show me the way?
How long will I have to wait for someday, someday?
