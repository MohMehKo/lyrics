Oh the grass is green
Everywhere but under me
Or so it seems

Got a wedding band
In the name of a wandering man
I love the best I can

Oh Henry, have you got something to tell me?
'Cause everybody's been sayin
You been runnin' around
Oh Henry, I know you wouldn't hurt me
Don't you know that we don't need
One more grave in this town

Boy if you're smart
You'll know you'll only have my heart
'til death do us part

Oh you and I both know
That at the end of that forbidden road
There's a six-foot hole

Oh Henry, have you got something to tell me?
'Cause everybody's been sayin
You been runnin' around
Oh Henry, I know you wouldn't hurt me
Don't you know that we don't need
One more grave in this town

When we wed, we said forever ever and a day
The whole town heard you promise to be true
So boy you're gonna only give your gypsy heart to me
If it's the last thing you do

Oh Henry, have you got something to tell me?
'Cause everybody's been sayin
You been runnin' around
Oh Henry, I know you wouldn't hurt me
Don't you know that we don't need
One more grave in this town
Oh one more grave in this town

Oh the grass is green
Everywhere but under me
