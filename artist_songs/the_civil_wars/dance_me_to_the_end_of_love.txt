Dance me to your beauty like a burning violin
Dance me through the panic 'til I'm gathered safely in
Lift me like an olive branch, be my homeward dove
And dance me to the end of love
Please dance me to the end of love

Oh let me see your beauty when the witnesses are gone
Oh let me feel you moving like they do in Babylon
Oh show me slowly what I only know the limits of
And dance me to the end of love
Please dance me to the end of love

La la, la la la, la la, la la la, la la, la la la

Oh dance me to the wedding now, oh, dance me on and on
And dance me very tenderly and dance me very long
We're both of us beneath our love, and both of us above
And dance me to the end of love, ooh
Won't you dance me to the end of love

La la, la la la, la la, la la la, la la, la la la
