I gave you all the love I got,
Gave you more than I could give
Gave you love,
I gave you all that I had inside
And you took my love, took my love

Keep crying (Keep crying), keep trying for you.
I Keep trying (I keep trying), I keep crying for you
This is no ordinary love, no ordinary love
This is no ordinary love, no ordinary love

Oh when you came around you brightened,
You brightened every day
With your sweet smile,
Oh didn't I tell you, all I got to give baby?

I keep crying, I keep trying
Oh I keep trying, keep trying for you
This is no ordinary love, no ordinary love oh oh
This is no ordinary love, no ordinary love oh oh oh
This is no ordinary love, no ordinary love oh oh oh oh
This is no ordinary love, no ordinary love, oh oh oh oh oh oh

I gave you all the love I got,
I gave you more than I can give,
Gave you love
