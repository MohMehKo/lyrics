There's a pub on the south side of town
Time stands still while there's still wine around
She's the one in the calico
The one who's always and never alone

Ooh, did she let him go or did the four winds blow him away?
Ooh, does she even know she's the girl with the red balloon?

Keep her glass full of cheap champagne
She will tell of the man with no name
Smoke and mirrors have done her in
She's in love and she won't be again

Ooh, did she let him go or did the four winds blow him away?
Ooh, does she even know she's the girl with the red balloon?

So lovely
So lonely
Floating away

Ooh, did she let him go or did the four winds blow him away?
Ooh, does she even know?..
Ooh, did she let him go, did the four winds blow him away?
Ooh, does she even know she's the girl, she's the girl with the red balloon?
