You forgot your grandmother’s scarf
As you walked away that day in the park
I watched you disappear into the city
Smaller and smaller you faded
That’s that

Say goodbye and don’t look back
So long to happy every after
You are my goodbye
Goodbye girl

I remember that look
The last one you gave me
A kiss on my cheek
As you were leaving
The last thing you said
Was “I’ll see you again”
But we both know we won’t
That’s that

Say goodbye and don’t look back
So long to happy every after
You are my goodbye
Goodbye girl

Never mind how long it lasted
You’re still the best thing
That never happened
You are my goodbye
Goodbye girl

Ooh I’ll move on
Yes I’ll move on
There is no use in chasing

Say goodbye and don’t look back
So long to happy every after
You are my goodbye
Goodbye girl

Never mind how long it lasted
You’re still the best thing
That never happened
You are my goodbye
Goodbye girl

Oh you’re still my goodbye
Goodbye girl
