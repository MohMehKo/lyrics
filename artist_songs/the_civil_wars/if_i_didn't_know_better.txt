If I didn't know better, I'd hang my hat right there
If I didn't know better, I'd follow you up the stairs
Stop saying those sweet things you know I like to hear
The horns are blowing louder, the bailiff's drawing near

Why do I keep drinking
Wasting my time on you?
If I didn't know better,
But, damn it, I do

There's a hole in what you're saying
I can plainly see you've a lover that's waiting
But, baby, you're right here with me

Oh you might as well be the devil,
Keeping me out past three

Well you're the one with that apple,
So, baby, you can't blame me

Oh, why don't you keep drinking?
Give me one night with you

If I didn't know better,
But, damn it, I do

Baby, I do

Oh baby, you're right here with me
Sweet daddy, you know I do
