D’Arline, hope this finds you well
There’s so much I’m dying to tell, but oh
That’s how it goes
Little things left unsaid
That I can’t keep in my head but oh
Just so you know
You’ll always be the only one
Always be the only one
D’Arline, what do I do now?
Can’t live with you or without, but oh
That’s how it goes
I could get over you
But please don’t ask me to
Just so you know
You’ll always be the only one
Even when you’re not
You’ll always be the only one
Even when you’re gone
You always said you want me to be happy
But happiness was having you here with me
You’ll always be the one that’s standing in my way
And that’s okay
You’ll always be the only one
You’ll always be the only one
D’Arline, if I only knew
