Look out, Ma
Look out, Pa
Look at that horizon
Somethin's out there kickin' up dust
Oh, it's comin' fast

Look out, Sister
Look out, Brother
River's gonna be risin'
Somethin' we've been waiting for
Oh, it's here at last

It's been a long time comin'
It's been a long time gone

Let's all sing
Let's all dance
Stomp our feet in that red clay
Come on out of those old brown fields
Watch 'em turn into gold

Watch 'em turn into gold

It's been a long time comin'
It's been a long time gone
It's been a long time comin'
It's been a long time gone

The wait is over
The winds have changed
And not a moment too soon
We've all done prayed for a single drop of rain
And now a storm's comin' through

It's been a long time comin'
It's been a long time gone
(Ooh) It's been a long time comin'
It's been a long time gone
