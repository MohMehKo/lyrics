I don’t want to talk right now
I just want your arms wrapped around
Me in this moment
Before it runs out

Oh, don’t say that it’s over
Oh, no say it ain’t so
Let’s let the stars watch
Let them stare
Let the wind eavesdrop
I don’t care
For all that we’ve got, don’t let go
Just hold me

I can’t pull you closer than this
It’s just you and the moon on my skin
Oh, who says it ever has to end
Oh, don’t say that it’s over
Oh, no say it ain’t so

Let’s let the stars watch
Let them stare
Let the wind eavesdrop
I don’t care
For all that we’ve got, don’t let go

Let’s let the stars watch
Let them stare
Let the wind eavesdrop
I don’t care
For all that we’ve got, don’t let go

Just hold
Just hold me
Just hold me
Just hold me
Just hold me
