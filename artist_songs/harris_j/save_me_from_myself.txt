I want it all
I want it now
Forget about the consequences
I know that it's bad, it's better to wait
But sometimes I can be selfish
And the only sound I hear is right now
And all my patience gets locked out
I know that it's wrong
And I want to change
I need You here with me

[Chorus:]
Allah, Allah, Allah
Save me from myself
Allah, Allah, Allah
Lord I need Your help
Allah, Allah, Allah
Save me from myself
Allah, Allah, Allah

Big lights pull me in every time
And it's so hard to break a pattern
But I see it clear, what's deep inside
Is the only thing that really matters
So tell me how, how to turn it around
Before my senses hit the ground
'Coz I know that's it's wrong
And I want to change
I need You here with me

[Chorus]

Save me from myself
'Coz I tripped and fell
And there is nothing, nothing
That I won't do
Oh, save me from myself
'Coz I need Your help
And now I'm running, running
Back to You
