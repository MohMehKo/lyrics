Jae Deen, Harris J
Yo, I'm dreaming big about it
So many days and counting
I got a blessing in my life, I couldn't live without it
So that means that I'm never doubting
No I'm never doubting, no!
And that's everyday
Jae Deen on this track, I’ve got Harris J
It's your biggest dream that means you’ve got to strive
I know you want it so bad just make du'a
Yeah, you want Paradise
'Cause everything ain't about this worldly life
You won't party or go club at night
Won't do bad things, no no ‘cause that ain't your type
Here's what you do
You’ve got to work hard ‘cause it's coming soon
So let me tell you one thing that will help you through
Just know that…

Taking one day at a time
I know it's not easy to do
It's what I want most from this life
