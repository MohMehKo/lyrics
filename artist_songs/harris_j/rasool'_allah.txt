Oh, you came into this life
Brought up as an orphan child
Through a time of deep despair, O Muhammad!
Your days at work began
As a fair and honest man
You showed just how much you cared

And one night in that cave
When the Archangel came
And your life in this world
Would never be the same

Rasool’Allah habib’Allah
Your light is always showing me the way
Rasool’Allah habib’Allah
I’m longing for the day I see your face

You brighten up my day
And in my heart you’ll stay
With every breath I take
I’ll never leave your way

Eyes that could light up any soul
You became the Chosen One
To proclaim the word of God, O Muhammad!
In the brightness of the sun
Or the stillness of the night
You would never ever stop

Being kind, giving hope
And serenity and love
To a divided world
That didn't have enough

Rasool’Allah habib’Allah
Your light is always showing me the way
Rasool’Allah habib’Allah
I’m longing for the day I see your face

You brighten up my day
And in my heart you’ll stay
With every breath I take
I’ll never leave your way

Rasool’Allah habib’Allah
Peace be upon you
Rasool’Allah habib’Allah
I really love you
Rasool’Allah habib’Allah
Peace be upon you
Rasool’Allah habib’Allah

Rasool’Allah habib’Allah
Your light is always showing me the way
Rasool’Allah habib’Allah
I’m longing for the day I see your face
Rasool’Allah habib’Allah
Your light is always showing me the way
Rasool’Allah habib’Allah
I’m longing for the day I see your face

You brighten up my day
And in my heart you’ll stay
With every breath I take
O Muhammad I will never leave your way
