Good life, good life
Allah I want to thank You for the good life

I want to wake up in the morning with the sun
Wear a smile, go out and have some fun
Going to take away the worries on my mind, oh
Put them to one side

‘Cause everyday is like a brand new story
With unwritten lines
And no matter the weather
It's going, going to be alright

I know my life ain’t perfect
But I don't have to worry
‘Cause I've got all that I need
Right here in my, in my life
I know my life ain't perfect
But I like the way it's going
‘Cause I've got all that I need
Right here in my, in my life

Thank You for the good life, good life
Allah I want to thank You for the good life
I leave it all in Your hands, oh
Thank You for the good life, good life
Allah I want to thank You for the good life

Hey, listen!
There are things in life that money just can't buy
Happiness and love don't have a price
All good people that surround me everyday, oh
I just appreciate

I love living in a brand new story
With unwritten lines
And no matter the weather
It's going, going to be alright

I know my life ain’t perfect
But I don't have to worry
‘Cause I've got all that I need
Right here in my, in my life
I know my life ain't perfect
But I like the way it's going
‘Cause I've got all that I need
Right here in my, in my life

Thank You for the good life, good life
Allah I want to thank You for the good life
I leave it all in Your hands, oh
Thank You for the good life, good life
Allah I want to thank You for the good life

It's about being thankful and trying to understand
That the more I learn I want to leave it all in Your hands
‘Cause I know You'll always take good of care of me
You’ve given me a good life, a good life each day

Good life, good life
Allah I want to thank You for the good life
Yes I want to thank You O Allah!
Thank You for the good life, good life
