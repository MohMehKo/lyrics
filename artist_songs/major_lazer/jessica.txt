My bathing suit is drying on the Porsche,
My mother is crying upstairs,
It's bad man, you badman,
And all I want is my Jessica,
Mine Jessica,
Mine Jessica,
Mein Hessikan,
Mein Hessikan
Mine, mine, mine, mine

You can let me off the leash,
I won't come near ya,
I won't come near ya,
Teach me to bark, teach me to speak,
I won't come near ya,
I won't come near ya
Some girls they call the shots,
Other girls might call you schatz
But Jessica, you're the girl - I love ya lots,
I love your locks, and your lox, and your lakhs

My physical looms on the schedule,
I want to be healthy for ya,
I hope it's not bad man, you badman,
Cause all I want is my Jessica,
Mi Jessica,
Mi Jessicita coronita essica,
Mein Jessikaner Jahtzenheimer Hessika,
Mine Jessica,
Mine Jessica

You can let me off the leash,
I won't come near ya,
I won't come near ya,
Teach me to bark, teach me to speak,
I won't come near ya,
I won't come near ya
Some girls they call the shots,
Other girls might call you schatz
But Jessica, you're the girl - I love ya lots,
I love your locks, and your lox, and your lakhs

Dein gesicht,
Und mein gesicht,
Könnten gute freunde sein,
Dein gesicht,
Und mein gesicht,
Könnten gute freunde sein,
Dein gesicht,
Und mein gesicht,
Könnten gute freunde sein

Teach me to bark, teach me to speak,
I won't come near ya,
I won't come near ya
Some girls they call the shots,
Other girls might call you schatz
But Jessica, you're the girl - I love ya lots
