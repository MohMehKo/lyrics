[Verse 1 - Ty Dolla $ign:]
The purple be coming in, the purple be coming in
The white girl got me turned up off the
The... they kicking in, the xan with just ten
I don't know how I'm getting on off in this bitch
Damn I prolly this bitch
Fuck it I just go home with this bitch
Or this bitch, or this bitch, or this bitch
You ain't getting money then don't say shit
I got a white Porsche on Forgiatos
Smell the kush and they gon follow
We be getting lit, getting lit
She say can you feel your face, no I can't feel shit
Na na na, on my mama
Need somebody to lean on
Lean on

[Verse 2 - MØ:]
What will we do when we get old?
Will we walk down the same road?
Will you be there by my side?
Standing strong as the waves roll over

[Pre-Chorus - MØ:]
But the nights are long
Longing for you to come home
All around the wind blows
We would only hold on to let go

[Chorus - MØ:]
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on
