All I want, yeah, only love, yeah, yo, Major Lazer

[Machel Montano:]
Hey DJ, bust a tune and then pull it up
If your cup's empty, fill it up
Spend more love, cause we can't get enough
Baby girl, just stop wine it up
If the party nah nice then me nah go
Just jump to the bass and the piano
Live like a vacation in Key Largo
Listen to scenario

We doing it larger than life, larger than life
Spread love and then let it fly,
Raise the levels, higher than high, yeah
And put your hands in the sky, hands in the sky
Major Lazer intensify,
Raise the levels higher than high,
Yeah, so stop, turn it up

[Ariana Grande & Machel Montano:]
Only love will make us ache (turn it up)
Only love is worth the chase (let's turn it up)
All my love, I know we're waiting for this
On the rocks up on the mountain tops

[Ariana Grande & Machel Montano:]
So leh we jump and show them, show them all my love
So leh we jump and show them, show them all my love
So leh we jump and show them, show them all my love
So leh we jump and show them, show them
Up on the mountain top

[Ariana Grande:]
All the rhythms in my heart lift me up and say
We're just a mess of broken people but we love the game
I would do anything for us. It's worth the pain
All the rhythms in my heart lift me up and say

[Ariana Grande & Machel Montano:]
Only love will make us ache (let's turn it up)
Only love is worth the chase (baby, let's turn it up)
All my love, I know we're waiting for this
On the rocks up on the mountain tops

So leh we jump and show them, show them all my love
So leh we jump and show them, show them all my love

You're always on my mind, oh, there'll come a day
Day where we can fly, reach the glory haze, oh, hey
High up in the sun in the brightest sky
Sun in the brightest sky

[Ariana Grande & Machel Montano:]
Only love will make us ache 
Only love is worth the chase
All my love, I know we're waiting for this
On the rocks up on the mountain tops

All my love is larger than life, larger than life,
All my love larger than life, larger than life,
All my love is larger than life, larger than life,
