Let me escape in your arms,
Baby I'm yours,
Baby I'm yours.
Love don't come easy at all,
I miss you so much,
I miss you so much.

Tell me, is this freedom, baby?
Chasing after danger, making my heart race.

Maybe if the stars align,
Maybe if our worlds collide,
Maybe on the dark side,
We could be together, be together.
Maybe in a million miles,
On a highway through the skies,
Someday soon we'll be together.

Maybe if the stars align,
Maybe if our worlds collide,
Maybe on the dark side,
We could be together, be together.
Maybe in a million miles,
On a highway through the skies,
Someday soon we'll be together.

He was a dreamer at heart,
Chasing the stars, chasing the stars.
Wings spread to the sun,
I miss you so much, I miss you so much.

Tell me, is this freedom, baby?
Chasing after danger, making my heart break.

Maybe if the stars align,
Maybe if our worlds collide,
Maybe on the dark side,
We could be together, be together.
Maybe in a million miles,
On a highway through the skies,
Someday soon we'll be together.

Maybe if the stars align,
Maybe if our worlds collide,
Maybe on the dark side,
We could be together, be together.
Maybe in a million miles,
On a highway through the skies,
Someday soon we'll be together.
