I wanna get out, babe
Take me, take me
Oh, we can get loud, yay
Crazy, crazy
Baby let's bounce, hey
Take me, take me now
Take me, take me now
Take me, take me

We are not mechanical
So love me like an animal

Live it up, live it up
Like we're in the wild
You and me, me
I want a love, want a love
They can hear from miles
Set me free, free
Put your hands on me
Moving to the beat
Live it up, live it up
Like we're in the wild
And we're free, free, free
In the wild, in the wi-ild
In the wild, in the wi-ild
In the wild, in the wi-ild
In the wild, in the wi-ild

When the jungle is sleepin'
All night, all night
Give me that heat wave
Alright, alright
It's a natural feeling
All night, all night, oh
All night, all night, oh
All night, all night (all night)

We are not mechanical
So love me like an animal

Live it up, live it up
Like we're in the wild
You and me, me
I want a love, want a love
They can hear from miles
Set me free, free
Moving to the beat
Put your hands on me
Live it up, live it up
Like we're in the wild
And we're free, free, free
In the wild, in the wi-ild
(In the wild)
In the wild, in the wi-ild
(Just you and me, you and me)
In the wild, in the wi-ild
In the wild, in the wi-ild
(in the wild)
In the wild, in the wi-ild
In the wild, in the wi-ild
(Just you and me, oh baby)
In the wild, in the wi-ild
