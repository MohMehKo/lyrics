A Christmas bell was crying, then Santa heard it say:
"I just can't seem to jingle and I can't go on the sleigh!"
Then Santa soon discovered the reason that it cried 
The bell that couldn't jingle, it had nothing there inside!

Then Santa said: "Jack Frost will bring my Christmas gift to you
And on Christmas Eve you'll jingle, just like you were brand new!"
Then Jack Frost froze a teardrop, so each time that it swayed 
The bell that couldn't jingle, it went jingling all the way!
Ooh, jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle all the way!
The bell that couldn't jingle, it went jingling all the way!

Then Jack Frost froze a teardrop, so each time that it swayed 
The bell that couldn't jingle, it went jingling all the way!
Ooh, jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle all the way!
The bell that couldn't jingle, it went jingling all the way!
