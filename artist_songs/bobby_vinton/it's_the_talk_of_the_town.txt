I can't show my face, can't go any place
People stop and stare, it's so hard to bear
Everybody knows you've left me
It's the talk of the town

Every time we meet, my heart skips a beat
We don't stop to speak though it's just a week
Everybody knows you've left me
It's the talk of the town

We sent out invitations to friends and relations,
Announcing our wedding day
Friends and our relations gave congratulations
How can you face them, what can you say?

Let's make up, sweetheart, we can't stay apart
Don't let foolish pride keep you from my side
How can love like ours be ending?
It's the talk of the town

Let's make up, sweetheart, we can't stay apart
Don't let foolish pride keep you from my side
How can love like ours be ending?
It's the talk of the town
(It's the talk of the town)
