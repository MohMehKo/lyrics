[Background:]
Ya, ya, ya, ya
You're a freshman
Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh

I am in love with a girl in my school
But I don't have a chance
Because I'm a freshman and she's a sophomore
She won't give me a second glance

There really isn't much difference in our age
Maybe just a year or two
What difference will it make if she is mine
When she's one hundred and I'm ninety-nine

[Background:]
You're a freshman

She is so pretty and she's just my type
She makes me flip my lid
Because I'm a freshman and she's a sophomore
She treats me like a kid

Her friends would say she's robbing the cradle
They would laugh at her
That's why my love doesn't have a chance
Because I'm a freshman and she's a sophomore

[Background:]
Ya, ya, ya, ya
You're a Freshman

[Background:]
She is so pretty and she's just your type

She makes me flip my lid

[Background:]
Because you're a freshman and she's a sophomore

She treats me like a kid

Her friends would say she's robbing the cradle
They would laugh at her
That's why my love doesn't have a chance
Because I'm a freshman and she's a sophomore

Ya, ya, ya, ya
You're a freshman
Ooooh, oooooh, ooooh, oooooh, ooooh
Ya, ya, ya, ya
You're a freshman
