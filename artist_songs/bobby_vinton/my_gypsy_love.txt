There's no greater love in all the world
Then what I feel for you
And there's nothing I wouldn't do
For my Gypsy Love

Love me now and never won't you please
You're my valley and my trees
My future and my memories
You're my Gypsy Love

Take me by your hand
To some distant, far-off land
Where we can lay
And love the day away

Hold me close and I'll tell you why
Time has a way of passing by
So until the day I die
Be my Gypsy Love

In a distant land
They'll be a band
And it will play
As sweet love our life away

There's no greater love in all the world
Then what I feel for you
And there's nothing I wouldn't do
For my Gypsy Love

Hold me close and I'll tell you why
Time has a way of passing by
So until the day I die
Be my Gypsy Love
