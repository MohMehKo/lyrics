Stuck in the traffic, late on the job again
My boss started yelling at me the minute I walked in
My head is aching and everythign I do is all wrong
But I know you can make it alright if I just make it home

It's been one of those days when I need one of your nights
I won't have to say what I need when we turn out the lights
I don't know how you know what do to but you sure do it right
It's been one of those days when I need one of your nights

Sometimes it feels like the day will just never end
Some days it feels like a fight that I'll never win
But when the world gets crazy and I want to leave it behind
I come home to you and you love it right ou tof my mind

It's been one of those days when I need one of your nights
I won't have to say what I need when we turn out the lights
I don't know how you know what do to but you sure do it right
It's been one of those days when I need one of your nights
