Hey!
Did you happen to see the most beautiful girl in the world?
And if you did, was she Polish, Polish?

Hey!
If you happen to see the most beautiful girl that walked out on me,
Tell her I'm sorry, tell her I need my baby
Won't you tell her that I love her?

I woke up this mornin',
Realized what I had done
I stood alone in the cold, gray dawn,
Knew I lost my mornin' sun

I lost my head and I said something
Now come the heartaches that the mornin' brings
I know I'm wrong and I couldn't see
I let my world slip away from me

So hey!
If you happen to see the most beautiful girl that walked out on me,
Tell her I'm sorry, tell her I need my baby
Won't you tell her that I love her?
