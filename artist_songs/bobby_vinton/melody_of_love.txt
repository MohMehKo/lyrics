I'm lookin' for a place to go so I can be all alone
From thoughts and memories
So that when the music plays I don't go back to the days
When love was you and me

[CHORUS:]
Oh, oh moja droga jacie kocham
Means that I love you so
Moja droga jacie kocham
More than you'll ever know
Kocham ciebie calem serce
Love you with all my heart
Return and always be
My melody of love

Wish I had a place to hide all my sorrow, all my pride
I just can't get along
'cause the love once so fine keeps on hurtin' all the time
Where did I go wrong?

[CHORUS]

Oh, oh, ("la-la's" [for the first line of chorus])
My melody of love
("la-la's" [for the first line of chorus])
My melody of love
("la-la's" [for the first line of chorus])
[FADE]
My melody of love
