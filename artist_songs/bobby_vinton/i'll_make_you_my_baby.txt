I wanna love you in a special way
And make you my baby
I'll find a way to please you every day
And make you my baby

Make you, make you my baby,
Kiss you, kiss you and maybe
You'll see, paradise is waiting for you and me
When I make you my baby (make you my baby)
When I make you my baby (make you my baby)

Kiss me and be my baby
Hold me, hold me and maybe
You'll see, paradise is waiting for you and me
When I make you my baby (make you my baby)
When I make you my baby (make you my baby)

I wanna love you in a special way
