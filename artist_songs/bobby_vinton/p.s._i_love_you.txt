Dear, I thought I'd drop a line,
The weather's cool, the folks are fine,
I'm in bed each night at 9:00
P.S. I love you.

Yesterday we had some rain,
But on the whole, I can't complain.
Was it dusty on the train?
P.S. I love you.

Write to the Browns just as soon as you're able,
They've been around to call.
I burned a hole in the dining room table,
Well, let me see, I guess that's all.
