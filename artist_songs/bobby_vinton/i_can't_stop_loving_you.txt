(I can't stop loving you)
I've made up my mind
To live in memory of the lonesome times
(I can't stop wanting you)
It's useless to say
So I'll just live my life in dreams of yesterday
(Dreams of yesterday)

Those happy hours that we once knew
Though long ago, they still make me blue
They say that time heals a broken heart
But time has stood still since we've been apart

(I can't stop loving you)
I've made up my mind
To live in memories of the lonesome times
(I can't stop wanting you)
It's useless to say
So I'll just live my life in dreams of yesterday

(Those happy hours) [x2]
(That we once knew) [x2]
(Though long ago) [x2]
(Still make me blue)
Still make me blue
(They say that time) [x2]
(Heals a broken heart) [x2]
(But time has stood still) 
Time has stood still 
(Since we've been apart) [x2]

(I can't stop loving you)
I said I made up my mind
To live in memory of the lonesome times
Sing a song, children
(I can't stop wanting you)
It's useless to say
So I'll just live my life of dreams of yesterday
(Of yesterday)
