Have you ever been lonely? 
Have you ever been blue?
Have you ever loved someone,
Just as I love you?
Can't you see that I'm sorry,
For each mistake I've made?
Can't you see I've changed dear?
Can't you see that I've paid?
Oh, be a little forgiving.
Take me back in your heart.
How can I go on living,
Now that we're apart?
If you knew what I'd been through,
You'd know why I ask you:
Have you ever been lonely?
Have you ever been blue?
Be a little forgiving.  
Take me back in your heart.
How can I go on living,
Now that we're apart?
If you knew what I'd been through,
You'd know why I ask you:
Have you ever been lonely?
Have you ever been blue?
