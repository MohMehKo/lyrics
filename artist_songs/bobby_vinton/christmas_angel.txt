[Chorus:]
Angel, angel, you're my Christmas angel
Sent to me from heaven above
Angel, angel, you're my Christmas angel
And you brought me love

I was blue beside the tree
On this day of joy,
Wond'rin' where the girl could be
For this lonely boy

Then, I looked up to the skies
With a silent prayer
Suddenly before my eyes,
You were standing there, oh

[Chorus]

All my dreams came true
No more winter tears because
Now I'm holding you

Promise me you'll never leave
Once the season's gone
Ev'ry night is Christmas Eve
From this moment on, oh

[Chorus]

(Angel, angel, you're my Christmas angel)
(repeat and fade out)
