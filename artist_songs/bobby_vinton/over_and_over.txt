If I had my life
To live over again
I would truly take you
For my love again

Oh how I'd love you 
Over and over [x2]
Over again
Yes I would love you 
Over and over [x2]
Over again

One lifetime isn't long enough
To be with you
I'd need more time 
To give this love of mine
That I have for you

Then I would love you
Over and over [x2]
Over again
Yes I would love you
Over and over [x2]
Yes over again
Over, over again
