So many times, you've heard
Those old familiar words
But if they've slipped your mind,
I'll say them one more time

I cherish you, my love
My heart is true, my love
Still true to you, my love
To only you, my love

If there's no other way
To say what I must say,
Then let my heart confess
You are my happiness

I cherish you, my love
My heart is true, my love
Still true to you, my love
To only you, my love

So many times, you've heard
Those old familiar words
But if they've slipped your mind,
I'll say them one more time

I cherish you, my love
