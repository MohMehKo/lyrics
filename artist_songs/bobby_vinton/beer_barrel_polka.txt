There's a garden, what a garden
Only happy faces bloom there
And there's never any room there
For a worry or a gloom there

Oh there's music and there's dancin'
And a lot of sweet romancin'
When they play the polka
They all get in the swing

Every time they hear that oom-pa-pa
Everybody feels so tra-la-la
They want to throw their cares away
And (Polish) ''Loopde shpay devashteva"

Then they hear a rumble on the floor
It's the big surprise they're waitin' for
And all the couples form a ring
Und miles around you'll hear them sing

Roll out the barrel, we'll have a barrel of fun
Roll out the barrel, we've got the blues on the run
Sing boom tararrei, sing out a song of good cheer
Now's the time to roll a barrel, cause the gang's all here

La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Hey, hey, hey
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Hey, hey, hey
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la

Now's the time to roll a barrel, cause the gang's all here

La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Hey, hey, SHAKE!
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Hey, hey, hey
La-la ...
