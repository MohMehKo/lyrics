Be sure it's true when I say, 'I love you'
It's a sin to tell a lie
Millions of hearts have been broken
Just because these words were spoken

I love you, yes, I do, I love you
If you break my heart I'll die
So be sure that it's true when you say, 'I love you'
It's a sin to tell a lie

I love you, yes, I do, I love you
If you break my heart I'll die
So be sure that it's true when you say, 'I love you'
It's a sin to tell a lie
It's a sin to tell a lie

[MONOLOGUE:] Now, ya better be sure that it's true when you say "I LUV ya."
Honey chile, don'tcha know it's a sin to tell a lie? Whole LOTTA hearts have been
Broken. Ya know why they were broken? Just for these foolish little words that
Were spoken. Ya know what they were? "I LUV ya, I LUV ya." Darlin', ya know
Doggone well I LUV ya and if ya break my heart I've GOT to die. So ya better be
Sure that it's true when you come runnin' up here sayin' "I LUV ya" 'cause it's a sin
To tell a lie.
