I'm sending you a big bouquet of roses,
One for every time you broke my heart

And as the door of love between us closes,
Tears will fall like petals when we part

I begged you to be different, but you'll always be untrue
I'm tired of forgiving, now there's nothing left to do

So, I'm sending you a big bouquet of roses,
One for every time you broke my heart

I begged you to be different, but you'll always be untrue
I'm tired of forgiving, now there's nothing left to do

So, I'm sending you a big bouquet of roses,
One for every time you broke my heart
One for every time you broke my heart
(Sending you a big bouquet of roses)
