All you have to do is touch my hand
To show me you understand
And something happens to me 
That's some kind of wonderful.
Any time my little world is blue 
I just have to look at you
And ev'ry thing seems to be some kind of wonderful
I know I can't express this feeling of tenderness
There's so much I want to say
But the right words just don't come my way
I just know when I'm in your embrace
This world is a happy place
And something happens to me
That's some kind of wonderful.
Some kind of wonderful, some kind of wonderful.
Some kind of wonderful, some kind of wonderful, 
Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.
Some kind of wonderful.
