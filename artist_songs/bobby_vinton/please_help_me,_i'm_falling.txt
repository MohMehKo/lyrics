Fallin, fallin'!

Please help me, I'm fallin'
In love with you;
Close the door to temptation,
Don't let me walk through!
Turn away from me, darlin',
I'm beggin' you to;
Please help me, I'm fallin'
In love with you;

I belong to another
Whose arms have grown cold,
But I promised for ever
To have and to hold!
I can never be free, dear,
But when I'm with you,
I know that I'm losin'
The will to be true!

Please help me, I'm fallin',
And that would be a sin;
Close the door to temptation,
Don't let me walk in!
For I mustn't want you,
But darlin' I do!
Please help me, I'm fallin'
In love with you.
