I'm so hurt
To think that you lied to me
I'm hurt
Way down deep inside of me

You said your love was true
And we'd never, never part
Now you want someone new
And it breaks my heart

I'm hurt
Much more than you'll ever know
I'm so hurt
Because I still love you so

But eventhough you hurt me
Like nobody else could ever do
I would never ever hurt you

I'm so hurt
Much more than you'll ever know
I'm so hurt
Because I still love you so

But eventhough you hurt me
Like nobody else could ever do
I would never ever hurt you
