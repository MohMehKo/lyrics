Sentimental me
Guess I'll always be
So in love with you
Don't know what to do
Sentimental me

A-dreamin' while I live
A-livin' just to give
All my love to you
No one else will do
Sentimental me (sentimental me)

A-reachin' for the moon
And wishin' on a star
On my honeymoon,
I wanna be where you are

Darlin', can't you see?
It was meant to be
I'm in love with you
Say you love me too
Sentimental me (sentimental me)

A-reachin' for the moon
And wishin' on a star
On my honeymoon,
I wanna be where you are

Darlin', can't you see?
It was meant to be
I'm in love with you
Say you love me too
Sentimental me

Oh, sentimental me
Ah, sentimental me
