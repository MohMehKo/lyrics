Other lips may borrow all my kisses
But you own my heart
What a hopeless situation this is
'Cause you own my heart

A heart you've mistreated and broken,
Tossed it around like a toy
You had your fun, now I'm one unhappy boy

Even though there's lots of girls around me,
You own my heart
Even though some other arms surround me,
You own my heart

If you decide to come back here
Or if we should stay far apart,
Remember, remember, you own my heart

You own my heart
You own my heart

And if you decide to come back here
Or if we should stay far apart,
Remember, remember, you own my heart

You own my heart
You own my heart

You own my heart
You own my heart
