Have I Told You Lately That I Love You
Well, darling, I'm telling you now
Have I Told You Lately That I Love You
Could I tell you once again some how
Have I told with all my heart and soul how I adore you
Well, darling, I'm telling you now

This heart would break in two if you refuse me
I'm no good without you, anyhow
Dear, Have I Told You Lately That I Love You 
Well, darling, I'm telling you now

Have I told you lately how I miss you
When the stars are shinning in the sky
Have I told you why the nights are long
When you're not with me
Well, darling, I'm telling you now

This heart would break in two if you refuse me
I'm no good without you, anyhow
Dear, Have I Told You Lately That I Love You 
Well, darling, I'm telling you now
