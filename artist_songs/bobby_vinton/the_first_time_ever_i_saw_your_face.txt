The first time ever I saw your face
I thought the sun rose in your eyes
And the moon and the stars were the gifts you gave
To the dark and the empty skies

The first time ever I kissed your mouth
I felt the earth move in my hand
Like the trembling heart of a captive bird
That was there at my command

The first time ever I lay with you
And felt your heart beat so close to mine
I knew our joy would fill the earth
And last till the end of time
And last till the end of time

The first time ever I saw your face
Saw your face, saw your face
Saw your face
