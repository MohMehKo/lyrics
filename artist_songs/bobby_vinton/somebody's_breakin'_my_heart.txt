I've been tryin' all night
With all of my might
To reason away
What I saw yesterday
But there's no use denyin'
Just as sure as I'm cryin'
It's true

[Chorus:)
Somebody's breakin' my heart in two
Somebody's paintin' my sunshine blue
Somebody's makin' a fool
Out of someone who loves her true
Somebody's breakin' my heart in two

Through a blur of a tear,
I could see very clear
The fool I had been
As I watched you with him
For the love in your eyes
Was as plain as the rain
On my face

[Chorus]
