When whippoorwills call and evening is nigh,
I will hurry to my Blue Heaven
A turn to the right, a little white light
Will lead you to my Blue Heaven

You'll see a smiling face, a fireplace, a cozy room,
A little nest that nestles where those roses bloom
Just Molly and me, and baby makes three
We're so happy in my Blue Heaven

You'll see a smiling face, a fireplace, a cozy room,
A little nest that nestles where the roses bloom
Just Molly and me, and baby makes three
We're so happy in my Blue Heaven
