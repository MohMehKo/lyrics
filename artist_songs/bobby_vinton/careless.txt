Careless
Now that you've got me loving you
You're careless
Careless in everything you do

You break appointments and think you are smart
If you're not careful, you'll break my heart

Careless
Now that my bridges all are burned
You're careless
Careless in things where I'm concerned

Are you just careless as you seem to be
Or do you just careless for me?

(Careless, oooooooooh)
You're careless
Careless in things where I'm concerned

Are you just careless as you seem to be
Or do you just careless for me?
