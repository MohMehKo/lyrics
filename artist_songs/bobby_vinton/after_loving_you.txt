After loving you, what else is there to do?
'Cause, honey, all the rest are gonna be second best
I know I'll go through life, comparing them to you
I'm no good to anyone after loving you (after loving you)

Your love can't be replaced with just another pretty face
And heartaches will remain for they can't be erased
Many loves may come along (come along), but they won't live up to you (live up to you)
I'm no good to anyone after loving you
