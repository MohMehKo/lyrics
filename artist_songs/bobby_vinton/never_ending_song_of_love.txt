I've got a never ending love for you from now on that's all I wanna do
From the first time we met I knew I'd have a never ending love for you
I've got a never ending love

After all this time of being alone
We can love one another feel for each other from now on
Feels so good I can hardly stand it
Never ending love for you from now on that's all I wanna do
From the first time we met I knew I'd sing my never ending song of love for you

After all this time
I've got a never ending love
