You dance at the discotheque
That's why you look such a wreck
Your face is pale you look drawn
Your clothes are dirty and torn
You've got that look in your eyes that says
You're half alive and you're lost inside
Meanwhile you're back in your cage
Ego'd out on the stage
Where the unconsciousness rules

You've got yourself in a bind
You don't know how to unwind
Your senses unsatisfied
Take you along on a ride
You've got a way and a stance that says
You'll dance the pants off of everyone
Then you go back on the floor
You got to get through the door
Where the unconsciousness rules.

You've lost a screw in your head
It shows the way you're led
Blind leading the blind
Nothing can stand in your way
You're living day after day
Where the unconsciousness rules.
