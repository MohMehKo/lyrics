I'm going down to the river gonna take me my rocking chair
Going down to the river gonna take me my rocking chair
And if those blues don't leave me
Gonna rock on away from here

(The reasons why I love you)

If you want me woman please don't act so shy
If you want me woman please don't pass me by
I love those sideways glances (Yeah)
Your shoulder and your thigh

(The reasons why I love you)
I see inside your eyes, the Baba's Sai
The reasons why I love you

So if you're still busy hiding what it is you've got
If you're frightened of losing what you like a lot
You may be cruising backwards
While thinking that you're not

(The reasons why I love you)
I see into your eyes, the Baba Sais
The reasons why I love you

So if you don't get the picture, you won't know what I feel
If you don't get the picture, then you won't have a depth of field
You may be going some place
Some place you've already been
