When sunshine is not enough
To make me feel bright
It's got me suffering in the darkness
That's so easy come by on the road-side
Of one long life-time

It's got me deep blue
You know I'm deep blue

When you stand there, watch tired bodies
Full of sickness and pain
To show you just how helpless you really are
When you get down to the truth
It hurts me

It's got me deep blue
You know I'm deep blue

When I think of the life I'm living
Pray God help me; give me your light
So I can love you and understand
This repetition that keeps me here
Feeling deep blue

It's got me deep blue
You know I'm deep blue
