You fly out as your smile wears thin
I sigh knowing the mess you're it
And you know that you can't get away
And you know that you can't hide it from yourself

Lonely days, blue guitar
There's no escape, can only run so far

I know something I ought to say
Stuck here, trying to find a way
And you know that you can't get away
And you know that you can't hide it from yourself

Lonely nights, traveling far
There's no escape, can only run so far
Lonesome tears, after dark
There's no escape, can only run so far

Ooh ooh

You fly out as your smile wears thin
I sigh knowing the mess you're in
And you know that you can't get away
And you know that you can't hide it from yourself

Lonely days, blue guitar
There's no escape, can only run so far
Lonely nights, traveling far
There's no way out, can only run so far
Lonesome tears, after dark
There's no escape, can only run so far

Ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
