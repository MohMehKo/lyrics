Swinging in the backyard
Pull up in your fast car
Whistling my name
Open up a beer
And you say "Get over here"
And play a video game

I'm in his favourite sundress
Watching me get undressed
Take that body downtown
I say you're the bestest
Lean in for a big kiss
Put his favourite perfume on
Go play a video game

[Chorus:]
It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth where you
Tell me all the things you wanna do
I heard that you like the bad girls, honey
Is that true
It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you
Baby, now you do

Singing in the old bars
Swinging with the old stars
Living for the fame
Kissing in the blue dark
Playing pool and wild darts
Video games

He holds me in his big arms
Drunk and I am seeing stars
This is all I think of
Watching all our friends fall
In and out of Old Paul's
This is my idea of fun
Playing video games

[Chorus:]
It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth where you
Tell me all the things you wanna do
I heard that you like the bad girls, honey
Is that true
It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you
Baby, now you do

[Chorus:]
It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth where you
Tell me all the things you wanna do
I heard that you like the bad girls, honey
Is that true
It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you
Baby, now you do
