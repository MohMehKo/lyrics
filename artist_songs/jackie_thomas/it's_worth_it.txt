[Verse 1]
We had the starry eyes
And everything aligned
Where did the butterflies go go go
We were the racing hearts
Couldn’t be torn apart
When did we turn into stone oh oh…
We fall so fast but we crash so slow oh ohh...

[Chorus]
But if we keep holding on
I know we’ll get back to the surface
Cause it’s worth it
If we keep holding on
I know that nobody’s perfect
But we’ll work it out

[Verse 2]
We were just ankle deep
Would of started to creep
There was no keeping it out out out
We were riding the waves
Surviving all the brakes
We didn’t think we could drown drown drown
And we tried to give it back
But we’re sinking down down down

[Chorus]
But if we keep holding on
I know we’ll get back to the surface
Cause it’s worth it
If we keep holding on
I know that nobody’s perfect
But we’ll work it out

[Bridge]
I don’t know how long I can hold my breath
But I’m not letting go yet
Cause I'm not ready
No I'm not ready to give up on us
Ooooohhhhhhh...
We fall so fast but we crash so slow oh ohh...

[Chorus]
But if we keep holding on
I know we’ll get back to the surface
Cause it’s worth it
If we keep holding on
I know that nobody’s perfect
But we’ll work it out
Hold on... Hold on... Its worth it!!
I know that nobody’s perfect
But we’ll work it out
