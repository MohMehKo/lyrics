Now here you go again
You say you want your freedom
Well, who am I to keep you down
It's only right that you should play the way you feel it
But listen carefully to the sound
Of your loneliness

Like a heartbeat drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost
And what you had
And what you lost

[Chorus:]
Oh, thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
They say women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean you'll know
You'll know

Now here I go again
I see the crystal vision
I keep my visions to myself
It's only me who wants to wrap around your dreams
And have you any dreams you'd like to sell
Dreams of loneliness

Like a heartbeat drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost
And what you had
Ooh, what you lost

[Chorus:]
Oh, thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
They say women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean you'll know

[Chorus:]
Oh, thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
They say women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean you'll know
You'll know
You'll know
Oh, you'll know
