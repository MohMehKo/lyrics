Can't help myself 'cause
I'm so used to you
Don't have the right
Just give me tonight
I'm waking up guilty
Got no capacity to leave me
Tell me to stop, oh
Don't tell me to stop, no

What am I doing touching you?
What am I doing to you?

I know we all bleed, but it's you that I'm hurting
Wish it didn't hit me so hard
I'll love you till the last goodbye
I know we all bleed, but it's you that I'm hurting
I've gotta let you go, don't I?
I'll love you till the last goodbye
The last goodbye

I feel so lonely
The dark's coming over me
I don't have the right
And I ain't gonna fight
Won't give you mourning
A few calls every now and then
Don't tell me to stop, oh
Don't tell me to stop, no

What am I doing touching you?
What am I doing to you?

I know we all bleed, but it's you that I'm hurting
Wish it didn't hit me so hard
I'll love you till the last goodbye
I know we all bleed, but it's you that I'm hurting
I've gotta let you go, don't I?
I'll love you till the last goodbye
The last goodbye

Can't help myself 'cause
I'm so used to you
I don't have a right
Just give me the night

Oh, what am I doing touching you?
What am I doing to you?

I know we all bleed, but it's you that I'm hurting
Wish it didn't hit me so hard
I'll love you till the last goodbye
I know we all bleed, but it's you that I'm hurting
I've gotta let you go, don't I?
I'll love you till the last goodbye
The last goodbye
The last goodbye
