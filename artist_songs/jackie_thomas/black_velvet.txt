Mississippi in the middle of a dry spell
Jimmy Rogers on the Victrola up high
Mama's dancing with baby on her shoulder
The sun is setting like molasses in the sky
The boy could sing, knew how to move, everything
Always wanting more, he'd leave you longing for

[Chorus]
Black velvet in that little boy's smile
Black velvet with that slow southern style
A new religion that'll bring you to your knees
Black velvet, if you please

Up in Memphis the music's like a heatwave
White lightning, bound to drive you wild
Mama's baby's in the heart of every school girl
Love Me Tender leaves 'em crying in the aisle
The way he moved, it was a sin, so sweet and true
Always wanting more, he'd leave you longing for

[Chorus:]
Black velvet in that little boy's smile
Black velvet with that slow southern style
A new religion that'll bring you to your knees
Black velvet, if you please

Every word of every song that he sang was for you
In a flash he was gone, it happened so soon
What could you do

[Chorus:]
Black velvet in that little boy's smile
Black velvet with that slow southern style
A new religion that'll bring you to your knees
Black velvet, if you please

[Chorus:]
Black velvet in that little boy's smile
Black velvet in that slow southern style
A new religion that'll bring you to your knees
Black velvet, if you please
Black velvet, if you please
Black velvet, if you please
