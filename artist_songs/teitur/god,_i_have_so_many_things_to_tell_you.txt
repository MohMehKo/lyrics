Mother nature hold me,
talk me off the ledge
I was raised to believe in
what the good book says

And sometimes i'm confused
and I don't know what to say
Maybe what I'm meant to do
is reach out and pray

God, I have so many things to tell you
I know you'll understand

The strength to surrender
brings sweet relief
I'm stronging off to let go
if you're ready to

I know that there's a heaven
beyond what I can see
I'm not asking for salvation
cause I already believe

God, I have so many things to tell you
I know you'll understand
I've been cynical,
I've been pointing fingers
left and right,
throw me a line
and save this drowning man

God, I have so many things to tell you
and God, I have so many things to tell you
I know you'll understand
