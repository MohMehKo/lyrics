You grabbed my hand and you lead me out.
Down the stairs among the Saturday crowds.
We caught the glimpse of a jealous stare.
We stole the night without a care.

And birds sang praise as we rushed by,
And now they've gone away before the leaves they die.
And baby you don't ever have to see me again
After what you've left me,
You don't owe me anything.

A-dumdumdum dumdumdadumdum...

And your face changed when we made love.
It took me places I sought like a dove.
In your eyes there were brooks and hills-
A thousand lives I have never lived.
The winds they blew from both sides then,
They brought us together where we'd never been,
And baby you don't ever have to see me again
Just carry the emotion like it was a golden ring

A-dumdumdum dumdumdadumdum...

Your room was tiny and very sparse
It was so real we could see the stars.
Your skin was soft like the sands of a beach
My fingers wrote a word for each.

And we talk like we're on the rainbow's end
And our voices turn to whispers ever now and then
But baby you don't ever have to see me again
After what you left me
You don't owe me anything.
