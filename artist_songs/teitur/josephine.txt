Dreamt I was back with the pirates and cats of my sommerville
The girl in the alphabet shirt covered in dirt lives on the hill

Well, my sweet Josephine,
Are you still racing stray dogs
Across the old stream?
My neighborhood queen,
Are you still kissing cowboys that cry, Josephine?

She stole, my grandmother's watch, a treasure to touch
To keep time to herself
Her mind, was a very big house, we got lost there for hours
Until August fell.

Well, my sweet Josephine
Are you still racing stray dogs
Across the old stream?
My neighborhood queen,
Are you still kissing cowboys that cry, Josephine?

You say you're alright, but Josie it's time
You gotta get your feet on the ground
But she says: "No, don't you see we have wings?
It's the funniest thing, it's just that no one knows."
No one knows, sweet Josephine...

Well, my sweet Josephine
Are you still racing stray dogs
Across the old stream?
My neighborhood queen,
Are you still kissing cowboys that cry, Josephine?

My neighborhood queen,
Are you still kissing cowboys that cry, Josephine?
