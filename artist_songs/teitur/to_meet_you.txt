It's five miles till I see my lover
I guess you could say that she's more than that
I've been sat in this seat now for hours
Reading my book like a map

Yeah these windows are crying
And this train is dying
To meet you

This train is filled with emotions
They all make me think about you
When we pass these old desert stations
I want to go there with you

It's four miles and counting
And my hands are shouting to meet you

To meet you is fine
For i know you're all mine
Waiting is nice, i can think of her eyes
These tracks can lead 
Just to one place
And your face
That i kiss and embrace when I meet you

I'm wondering if you will ever come with me
And we can play husband and wife 
We could waltz around this globe and its mystery
Then rest till the end of our lives

Yeah its 2 miles and closing 
And i'm overdosing on you

Dah da doo....to meet you
Dah da doo...to meet you

Yeah these windows are crying 
And this train is dying to meet you
