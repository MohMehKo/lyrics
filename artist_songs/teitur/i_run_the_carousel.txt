I run the carousel
With horses and tinkerbell
Late night by the canal

You wouldn’t notice me
I have a tendency
To blend with the music

I run the carousel

Children swirl around
Like drapes in a summertown
Husbands kindle their wives

Sometimes it tortures me
The envy and the jealousy
But I never panic

I run the carousel

Sometimes when the birds fly over
I look up, but I don’t want to go nowhere
Got lives to save under the open

Live as a mystery man
Sleep in a caravan
I love everybody

I run the carousel
