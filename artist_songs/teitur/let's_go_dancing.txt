Our minds run in circles
Racing around the resturant
They are searching for what more to say
To say what we realy want

Lets leave it like it is
And stop stearing at theese walls
Lets not go headlong to that distance
Where you cant come back at all

Lets go dancing
Waltz around the rumor mill
In your faded dress with daphodills
Lets go dancing, 
Let time stand still

Once your name was but a wisper
A simple wish upon that tongue
And staring at your shadow is like staring at the sun
And in this dark dark hour, you still illuminate a room.
Oh God give the power, we got to keep ourselves in tune

Lets go dancing, 
Waltz around the rumor mill
In your faded dress with daphodills
Lets go dancing, 
Let time stand still
