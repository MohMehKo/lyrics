I thought it would never end
We would always be friends
I didn't see it coming
Your book is wisely done
And you don't talk to me no more, never like you did before

In your great book I am the crook
You have given me a gun
And black glasses on
You make me do awful crimes
And say all the bad lines

In your great book
You got the good looks
In your great book

In chapter 2 
you admit I loved you
But the funniest part 
is where I'll break your heart
You'll have to leave the country to rise again from misery

I read it everyday
And you got things to say
You are reminding me of jazz
You are sometimes too fast
But that was then and this is now
I learned a trick or two somehow

In your great book
You got the good looks
In your great book

And you are the star
Oh yes you are
And I break your heart
Well of course I break your heart
Well of course I break your heart
Of course I break your heart
Well of course I break your heart
