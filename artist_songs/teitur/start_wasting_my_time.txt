I live for deadlines, 
dying for just a minute's peace. 
I swallow headlines, 
always running from the time police. 

Will I ever get used to this? 
Will I ever get used to this? 

Racing car driver, 
I'll beat you to the next light. 
Born again survivor, 
I never lose a dog fight. 

Start wasting my time. 
Let's rent a sad movie 
and drink some bad wine. 
And stare the sunset. 
Just make sure that I'm 
wasting my time. 

Will I ever get out of here? 
Will I ever get out of here? 

Everything you do 
seems to be in slow motion. 
It must be some voodoo. 
Could do with some of that potion. 

Start wasting my time. 
Let's do something stupid 
my partner in crime. 
Let's listen to Dido and Madonna. 
Just make sure that I'm 
wasting my time. 
Start wasting my time, 
'cos I've got too much on my mind. 
Give me no good reason why. 
Start wasting my time!
