You shake my nerves and you rattle my brain
Too much love drives a man insane
You broke my will, oh what a thrill
Goodness, gracious, great balls of fire

I pull my fingers and twiddle my thumbs
I'm real nervous, but it sure is fun
C'mon, c'mon baby, you drive me crazy
Goodness, gracious, great balls of fire

Kiss me baby! Oh it feels good
Hold me baby! I wanna love you like a lover should

You shake my nerves and you rattle my brain
Too much love drives a man insane
You broke my will, oh what a thrill
Goodness, gracious, great balls of fire
