I don't know you very well
I'll be the first to admit
I don't recall the situation
I just remember what i felt

All you do is make feel good
In a way i've never felt before
Now I can't stop thinking of you
I have a funny feeling
that you feel the same way too

Is almost too good to be true
I can't believe all this happening
It's only making sense inside me
and I don't know what to make of it

All you do is make me feel good
In a way I've never felt before
Now I can't stop thinking of you
Yeah you do something to me
I've actually been singing in the rain
