Can I call you if I'm back in town?
Leave a message when I'm southbound?
Could I please, could I please?
Won't be long till I'll be passing through,
Maybe three days, maybe two.

Could I see you one more time, if its ok if you don't mind?
I'm the shade of a shadow, baby.
Been thinkin' bout you tonight, how sweetly you bring light.
You're the ray of the sun, and I'm the shade of a shadow.

Of all the letters I never sent and all the time we haven't spent,
Could I please, could I please?
You always said I play games I know I'd lose,
You always said that's the life I'd choose. 

Could I see you one more time if it's ok if you don't mind?
I'm the shade of a shadow, baby.
Been thinkin bout you tonight, how sweetly you bring light.
You're the ray of the sun, I'm the shade of a shadow.

[repeat]

Could I please, could I please?
Could I please you?
