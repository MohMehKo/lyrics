My baby travels with a barstool
My baby travels with a barstool
Boy, she can sing, my baby!

My baby don't do the dishes
My baby won't do the dishes
Boy, she can sing, my baby!

Saw my baby's picture when she was a kid
Yeah, yeah, yeah she was always like this
She looks so sweet in the bar-room shadow
Blowin' off the roof, she's a flamin' arrow!

My baby doesn't have an address
My baby doesn't have an address
Boy, she can sing, my baby!

My baby writes a thousand letters
My baby writes a thousand letters
Boy, she can sing, my baby!

She's never in a hurry, but she moves so fast!
When she makes her promises, she makes them last!
