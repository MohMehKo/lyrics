If I say no, if I resist
If I don't give in to this
Would it be a lesson or a loss?

Suddenly I know what it's about
Thoughts come in, and words come out
Suddenly I'm not killing time
It's all over now

You get me
You get me

Like a beautiful song
You heard a million times
Like the rainbow's end
You can never find

You get me
You get me

If I say yes, if I let go
And face the consequence I'll know
Will it lead to living with regret?

Suddenly the walls are coming down
I won't be the same when I come around
Suddenly I am understood
It's all over now

You get me
You get me

Like a crimson sunset
Where the sky meets sea
Like no one alive
But lives in my dreams

You get me
You get me
You get me
You get me

Like a beautiful song
You heard a million times
Like the rainbow's end
You can never find

It's hard to ignore
And undeniable, too
This feeling inside
When I look at you

You get me
You get me
