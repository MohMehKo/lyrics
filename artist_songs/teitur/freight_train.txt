I was born my parents sun
From my first breath I was the one
Expected to hang on the moon

I learned to walk in my fathers shoes
I loved my mother like good boys do
I never rolled â€¦a freight train

I Scot the wind and gold for my home teen
I made and meet the great university
I home might hang on the poem om wall

I signed on to be a company man
It was all part of the master plan
I never rolled a freight train
I never saw the stars on Hollywood and vine 	

I never kissed the wrong girl 
I never got drunk in spain
No I never rolled a freight train

I fell in love with a debutant
I gave her a ring in a restaurant
I bought us a home in the right part of town

We had a sun he looked up to me 
I  said I love you but promise me you'll never say 
I never rolled a freight train
I never saw the start on  hollywood and  vine

I never kissed the wrong girl at the right time
I never got high in Spain
No i never rolled i never rolled
A freight train.
