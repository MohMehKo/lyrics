Catherine the waitress, 
if you only knew where my mind is.
"Is there anything you'd like?" 
If I could only tell you! 
You haven't even noticed me,
but, oh you are so good to me!

Catherine the waitress, 
I don't intend to seduce you.
I'm not a resident, I'm not a regular.
But if I lived here this would be my favourite bar!
Cross my heart and hope to die,
I'm not drunk, and I'm not high!

The accident happened one year ago, 
according to the lines in my hand.
A requiem is playing behind my eyes,
but you don't see it, Catherine, do you?
Do you? 

Catherine the waitress, 
if you only knew where my mind is.
"Is there anything you'd like?"
If I could only tell you.
You haven't even noticed me, 
but, oh you are so good to me!
