You've got sapphire eyes
but that's okay
I've seen that before
it's nothing new
You can look at me that way if you want
but don't let me fall in love with you

You've got one of those smiles
I've heard about
That can tear us all 
in two
Almost afraid to see you happy
I just might fall in love with you

Don't let me fall
Don't be so cruel
Don't let me fall
If I can't have you

When we touch
electricity gets through
It's a good trick if you can do it
to make me fall in love with you

Don't let me fall
Don't be so cruel
Don't let me fall
If I can't have you

You talk with tongues of angels
and there is grace in all you do
My heart aches to see you sway like that
Oh please, please, don't let me fall in love with you
Please, don't let me fall in love with you
Please, don't let me fall in love with you
