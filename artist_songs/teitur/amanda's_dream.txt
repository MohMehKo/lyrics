Can you say goodbye, without ever leaving?
That's some sad soul to keep
Amanda awakes in a moment believing
She's better off staying asleep
So she drives by the station 
Imaginin' somewhere
Sings a slow slow song

Now she's waiting at the stoplights
With no where to go
But in our town there's just one stoplight
Oh I wish she would know
There's a world outside her window
Anywhere the wind blows
Anywhere's Amanda's dream

She sits late at night by the light of a candle
Her wishes that never come true
Her hope gets so high they're too hard to handle
She stares as they fade out of view
And these song words have led her to nowhere
Cept a slow slow song

Now she's waiting at the stoplights
With no where to go
But in our town there's just one stoplight
Oh I wish she would know
There's a world outside her window
Anywhere the wind blows
Anywhere's Amanda's dream

Well she sleeps like a girl
But she wakes like a woman
She sleeps like a girl
But she wakes like a woman
Like a woman

Waitin at the stoplights with nowhere to go
But in our town there's just one stoplight
I wish she would know
There's a world outside her window
Anywhere the wind blows
Anywhere's Amanda's dream.
