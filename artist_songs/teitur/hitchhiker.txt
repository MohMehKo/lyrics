She was just a hitchhiker
That I picked up by the side of the road
What you did to me, what you put me through
What you did to me, what you put me through

Got no money, but I'll paint your picture
If I wake up to the morning sun

She was just a hitchhiker
I said my name was Christopher
She had mudstains on her shirt
I remember what I said to her

Called the police, put in a report
But no one has reported
Seeing my most wanted one

I was just a lonesome rider
Headed nowhere in particular
Have her picture awake in the night
Of promised landscapes in white on white

Called the police, put in a report
But no one has reported
Seeing my most wanted one
