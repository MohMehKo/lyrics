This afternoon,
I went fishing.
It would not be true to say
I did not catch a thing
The seaweed caught my hook
I had to cut my line
The rocks were slippery
The tides were too low
My dog it kept on barking
Because of the big waves
I had to go back home.

I saw a dead bird
In a creek, In a creek
I saw a dead bird.

I had to go back home
Because of the big waves
My dog it kept on barking
The tides were too low
The rocks were slippery
I had to cut my line
The seaweed caught my hook
I did not catch a thing.

It would not be true to say
I went fishing
This afternoon
