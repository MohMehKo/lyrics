Who is to say who wins or who loses
I sing to myself at the end of the day
When I know what the blues is
All my mistakes have become masterpieces

I was born in the goodness of grace
Because of faith, because of courage
Because of forgiveness
All my mistakes have become masterpieces

There comes a time
You must stay in the moment
While your heart's still bleeding

There comes a time
When you must walk away
Though your heart's still beating

Who is to say who wins or who loses
I sing to myself at the end of the day
When I know what the blues is
All my mistakes have become masterpieces
