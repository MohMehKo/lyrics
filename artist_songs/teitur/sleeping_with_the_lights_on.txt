I've been haunted by this old ghost before
I want to hear your voice you know it's been so long
Like a dancing wave you balance on the shore
It would feel so good to see your face again

I still sleep with the lights on
I still stay up late alone
I still love another one
I still sleep with the lights on

We both understand we've got no way back
Our love was strange in a strange land
We got broken wings we were bound to fall
Until the sun comes up you can hold my hand

I still sleep with the lights on
I still stay up late alone
I still love another one
I still sleep with the lights on

Take it easy, take it slow
Let's just watch the tides they grow
The wind is coming from the side
We are sleeping in the light

Feel like waking up in your house some day
Or eating of your hand like a bird astray
But nothing's gonna change, we'll still be the same
We've said what's to say, nothing's buried nowhere

I still sleep with the lights on
I still stay up late alone
I still love another one
I still sleep with the lights on
