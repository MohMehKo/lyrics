The joke is that we thought we were shooting a dog. 
We sure didn't see no man in that fog. 
It was just a boring day that we decided to betray. 
Me and him are outlaws now. 

There ain't no stopping now. 
They are coming to get us now. 
"You fired that shot and I simply had to watch. 
I am putting the blame on you!" 

He looked at me and we looked away. 
The fog was getting closer. 
Our gun was still smoking. 
We saw this as a token that we could still run away. 

Run, run away. 
There ain't no stopping now. 
I'll always run away. 
Run, run away. 
They are coming to get us now! 

Minutes later we came back. 
We would say that we had found this man in a crack. 
Something kept an eye on us, 
the eye that always watches us 
and we finally told the truth. 

A killer is a cold blooded one. 
Just like us, he shoots stray cats for fun! 
What happened there is beyond, I swear, 
we'd never aim to kill or scare! 
There ain't no stopping now! 

Run, run away. 
There ain't no stopping now. 
I'll always run away. 
Run, run away. 
They are coming to get us now!
