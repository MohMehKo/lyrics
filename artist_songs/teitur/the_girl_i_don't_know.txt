I'm in love with a girl I don't know
I carry her with me wherever I go
I walk these streets with her name in my shadow
All for the girl I don't know

And flags are waving proudly in the air

And I'm selling flowers on the square

And the evening turns to watch tomorrow
All for the girl I don't know

Before we said hello
It was just another day 
You must learn to love the rain
I said to the girl I don't know

And if she wonders tell her where I am

And then I am blindly finding my way through these lands

And tell her how I don't believe in sorrow
And fall for the girl I don't know

Before we said goodbye and the sky began to gray
You must learn to love the rain
So said the girl I don't know
