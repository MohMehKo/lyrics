I boarded the plane, thought I'd said all my goodbyes
Been no regrets, only sorry how time flies
A man next to me, says the city is so shallow
Me I'm looking down, I see a city full of souls

And I can hardly wait
To see those lights again
A part of me remains
I'm forever changed
You're always almost there
It's a love and hate affair
I believe them when they say
You never leave LA

I retraced the steps, of all the stars on the boulevard
No one thinks about, what it took to get that far
Others who have tried, they were only left there hanging
And all those broken dreams, could have filled up Laurel Canyon

These California skies
Put fire in my eyes
And I could drive for miles
With the ocean by my side
You're always almost there
It's a love and hate affair
I believe them when they say
You never leave LA

39000 feet, high above the ground
If I were in the driving seat
I could have turned this plane around

And I can't hardly wait
To see those lights again
A part of me remains
I'm forever changed
You're always almost there
It's a love and hate affair
I believe them when they say
You never leave LA
