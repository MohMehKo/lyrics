I always had the voice, and now I am a singer.
The audience grows silent when I open up my mouth.
I sing the words I've written every night before a crowd.
As if I were a poet or some legendary mind.

They wonder what I'm doing up there on the stage.
They stare at my posture and say I speak so well.
I sing about my loneliness and in return they thank me.
I had never meant to be a singer, but I'm slowly getting used to the idea.

I am a part of this whole movement that people come to see.
They drive for seven hours from all across the country.
We raise our voices in unison at the end of the show.
People break into tears for reasons I don't know.

They just try to understand me, and I sing to be loved.
