[English Translation:]

Without anyone knowing, without even me knowing
I don’t know when but you came into my heart
Tears fell yesterday and tears are falling again today
With my head down low, I’m looking at you

Love has come without you knowing
Without any reason, you’re in my heart
All alone, I repeat these words as I cry
Do you know?

The one word that you draw inside of me
The one word that is always hidden inside of me
I’m looking at you, I’m always by your side
But I can’t say the words I love you

Always be by my side, only you be by my side
Those words are still inside of me
All alone, I repeat these words as I cry
Do you know?

The one word that you draw inside of me
The one word that is always hidden inside of me
I’m looking at you, I’m always by your side
But I can’t say the words I love you

Words that my heart says
I love you more than myself
I want to love you

The one word that you draw inside of me
The one word that is always hidden inside of me
I’m looking at you, I’m always by your side
But I can’t say the words I love you
