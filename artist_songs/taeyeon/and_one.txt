[English Translation:]

Do you remember me, who was easily scarred, easily cried, easily got hurt?
I’m still like that, I’m still the same
I wonder how you will be when you see me like this

Even if you easily turn away, easily get farther apart
I know I won’t easily forget you
If you see me, still the same, still like this
You will call me a fool

I want and want you – and one more thing
I hurt and hurt but still, just once
Even if it wears out and wears out
Even if the tears don’t dry
If only we can go back to the beginning

There are times when I despise the moment we first faced each other
I’m like this sometimes even though I can’t breathe if I don’t allow myself to long for you

I want and want you – and one more thing
I hurt and hurt but still, just once
Even if it wears out and wears out
Even if the tears don’t dry
If only we can go back to the beginning

If, if you ever, at least once, in your life
If you sometimes have days where your heart aches because of me
If, at least once, in your life

And one more thing – remember this
Even if it’s only you, you should live properly

If, if you ever, at least once, in your life
If you sometimes have days where your heart aches because of me
If, at least once, in your life
