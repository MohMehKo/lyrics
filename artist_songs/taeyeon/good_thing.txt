Give me that, give me that good thing
가득 날 채우는 Good thing

뭐랄까 왠지 느껴지는 맘이
너를 자꾸 원하게 돼
이유가 뭔지도 알아챌 틈 없이 넌
내 시선을 파고들어 (No doubt)

뜨거운 숨을 쉬어 날 가둬버려도
Don’t wanna, wanna fight it
어느새 넌 내 안에

잠잠한 내 가슴에 번진 Good thing
끝없이 원해 널 More, more, more
어지런 내 머리 속 퍼진 Good thing
고칠 수 없어 그건 Love that good thing

That good thing

이상해 왠지 어색한 이 맘이
나쁘지가 않은 거야
넌 내 Desire 커져가 더 Higher
난 중독된 것 같아

시선은 단 하나 네게만 갇혀도
Don’t wanna, wanna fight it
감출 수가 없잖아

잠잠한 내 가슴에 번진 Good thing
끝없이 원해 널 More, more, more
어지런 내 머리 속 퍼진 Good thing
고칠 수 없어 그건 Love that good thing

[English translation:]

Give me that, give me that good thing
It fills me up fully, good thing

What should I say? This heart that
I feel keeps wanting you
No time to understand the reason,
you burrow into my gaze (No doubt)

I breathe hot breaths, even if I’m locked up
Don’t wanna, wanna fight it
Before I knew it you were inside of me

Spreading in my calm heart, good thing
I want you endlessly, more, more, more
Spreading in my dizzy head, good thing
I can’t fix that, love that good thing

That good thing

It’s weird, this awkward heart,
it’s not bad
You’re my desire, it grows even higher
I think I’m addicted

If I’m trapped just in your one gaze
Don’t wanna, wanna fight it
I can’t hide it

Spreading in my calm heart, good thing
I want you endlessly, more, more, more
Spreading in my dizzy head, good thing
I can’t fix that, love that good thing

That good thing
That good thing

Give me that, give me that good thing
It fills me up fully, good thing
Give me that, give me that good thing
I can’t escape it, good thing
You got it baby
Yeah, you got it baby
Oh no, no, no

It slowly spreads to you too, good thing
Want it like me, more, more, more
I can’t deny it for a moment, good thing
I can’t fix that, love that good thing

I got it, you got it
I got it, you got it
I got it, you got it
Good thing

I got it, you got it
I got it, you got it
I got it, you got it
You got that good thing
