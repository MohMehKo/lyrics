[Korean:]

오늘도 별처럼 네 마음을 따라
또 너의 곁을 맴돌지
Stop 난 어지러워 선명한 네 맘을
이젠 알고 싶어져

밤하늘에도 거리에도
전부 너의 모습이 가득한 걸
좀 더 시간이 필요하다면
또 널 기다리겠지만

Boy I can't cover up my heart
널 보면 난 웃음이 새어 나와
아무도 몰래 내게 스며들어
조금씩 커져 가는 맘 boy I can't cover up

Can't cover it up, can't
Can't cover it up, no
Can't cover it up, no
I just can't cover it up, come on
Can't cover it up, can't can't cover it up, no
커져 가는 맘 boy I can't cover up

난 조심스럽게 네 색깔을 입고
또 네 옆에 자릴 잡지
내 맘과 같은지 얼마만큼 인지
말을 해줘 yes or no

밤하늘에도 거리에도
전부 너의 모습이 가득한 걸
좀 더 시간이 필요하다면
또 널 기다리겠지만

Boy I can't cover up my heart
널 보면 난 웃음이 새어 나와
아무도 몰래 내게 스며들어
조금씩 커져 가는 맘 boy I can't cover up

Yeah, in my heart
언젠가 나의 곁에 와 줄 너와
달콤한 꿈을 꾸는 상상을 해
I want you 커져 가는 맘 boy I can't cover up

I said it, I said it (I love you, love you)
I mean it, I mean it (I love you, love you)
말하는 이 순간
후회한대도 너를 향한 진심인 걸

Boy I can't cover up my heart
널 보면 난 웃음이 새어 나와
아무도 몰래 내게 스며들어
조금씩 커져 가는 맘 boy I can't cover up

(Can't cover it up, can't
Can't cover it up, no)
언젠가 나의 곁에 와 줄 너와
(Can't cover it up, no,

달콤한 꿈을 꾸는 상상을 해
