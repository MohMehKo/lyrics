하나 둘씩 불이 꺼지면 홀로 남아
잠들지 못한 촛불과 함께 Yeah
유난히 눈부신 아침 햇살이
난 부담스러워
분주하게 걷는 사람들 틈 속

Put your hands on me,
put your hands on me, yeah

가끔 지쳐 숨이 찰 때면 Yeah
멈춰서 그 자리에 앉아
하늘을 또 바라봐 Yeah
Listen 우린 다 달라 같을 수 없잖아
똑같은 룰 속 열 맞춘다면
의미가 없지 재미도 없지
정답은 꼭 하나뿐이 아냐

다른 시선 속에도
그저 길을 잃어버린 어른아이
그런 눈빛 사이로 내게 전해온 Sign
점점 더 빨리 내게로

때로는 숨김없이
아주 작은 맘 조각까지 열고
Hands on me, put your hands on me, yeah
그 아픔만큼 강해진
맘 속 깊은 곳까지 닿게
Put your hands on me,

아직 꿈을 꾼 내게 그새 다가온 Sign
너의 그 Sign 점점 가까이 내게로

때로는 꼭 그렇게 미솔 담은
눈으로 내게 말해
Put your hands on me, put your hands on me

Hands on me, put your hands on me

As the lights turn off one by one, I remain alone
With candlelight that can’t fall asleep, yeah
Exceptionally shining morning sunlight,
it’s overwhelming for me
Among the people who walk busily,
I know I don’t fit in

Within differing gazes,
an adult child who has lost their way
Between those gazes a sign has come to me,
gradually closer to me

Once in a while, without hiding,
I open a very small piece of my heart
Hands on me, put your hands on me, yeah
As much as it hurts, it’s stronger,
so reach into a deep place in my heart
Put your hands on me,
put your hands on me, yeah

Sometimes I run out of breath from exhaustion, yeah
Stop and sit at that spot,
look at the sky again, yeah
Listen, we’re all different, we can’t be the same
If we fall in line within the same rules
There’s no meaning, no fun
There isn’t just one answer

Within differing gazes,
an adult child who has lost their way
Between those gazes a sign has come to me,
gradually faster to me

Once in a while, without hiding,
I open a very small piece of my heart
Hands on me, put your hands on me, yeah
As much as it hurts, it’s stronger,
so reach into a deep place in my heart
Put your hands on me,
put your hands on me, yeah

Put your hands on me, a warm touch of the hand
All of the long-term wishes
shine brightly in this moment
To me, who’s still dreaming, this approaching sign
That sign from you, gradually closer to me

Sometimes, filled with a smile,
you tell me with your eyes
Put your hands on me, put your hands on me
At the dream I longed for in my heart,
I will smile brightly even more
Put your hands on me,
put your hands on me, yeah

Put your hands on me, come on
Put your hands, hands
Put your hands on me, come on
Put your hands
Hands on me, put your hands on me
