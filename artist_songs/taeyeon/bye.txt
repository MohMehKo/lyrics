[English Translation:]

Please be happy.
I hope that you will always be someone who shines brightly.

Saying goodbye with a smile
A little more (sound of ball hitting) Now, it’s goodbye.

Farewell, we’re saying goodbye now.
My love, my precious person.

As hot as the suns rays,
you who hugs me.

While looking at you with brimming eyes, goodbye.
While smiling brightly, oh~ goodbye.

Farewell, precious person.
The beautiful and sparkling you who gives me light.

Goodbye, my love.
While looking at you, goodbye.
While looking at you a little more,
Goodbye.
