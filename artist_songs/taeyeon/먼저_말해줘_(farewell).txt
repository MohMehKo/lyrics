[English Translation:]

Liking that song
Liking that road, that’s not it, that’s not it,
I like the song we listened to together
Roads we used to walk together, it’s true

From the beginning, this ugly appearance,
I should’ve showed you my shabby self first

Tell me first
Not ambiguously but a bit more clearer,
Like a fool, I
Words that said to be well, words that said thank you

What do I do? I don’t know anything.

Without any reason,
Are people who walk alone like me?

Today, I won’t be embraced
I’ll turn back after seeing your face

Tell me first
Not ambiguously but a bit more clearer,
Like a fool, I
Words that said to be well, words that said thank you

Today, somehow to me
You look very unfamiliar
Please, so you can know me
Make it so you’ll understand

That’s right, truthfully, I
Watched you today, without you knowing

NEED U
Words that said to be well
Words that said thank you
What do I do, I don’t know anything

Now I can withstand,
But the last farewell is really disappointing
Goodbye
