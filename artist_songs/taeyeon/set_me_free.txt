[English Translation:]

The thing I suddenly remembered was your smile
I keep trying to erase it but it just gets clearer

Love
All of the stories we shared together
Now they are in the past

Set me free, let me be
Let me go so I can rest for a moment
Set me free, let me be
This isn’t right, like a fool, I keep laughing

The thing that suddenly passes by is the smile inside of me
I keep trying to bring it back but it just gets farther away

Love
Our happy moments were like precious stones

Set me free, let me be
The more I am in pain, the more you well up in my heart
Set me free, let me be
This isn’t right, like a fool, I keep shedding tears
