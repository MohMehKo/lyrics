[English Translation:]

There are so many things I can’t say
You never hear it even once
Someone that is shown in front of me
My love, it’s not that kind of love

Inside all those people in the world
To me, i was only able to see you
I’m standing only looking at you
I don’t know about the future after our love
At this moment I’ll embrace you like a young child

Even if your name becomes unfamiliar someday
My heart will keep it as memory
Even though a sad farewell is to come
Don’t think about that today
Inside all those people in the world
To me, i was only able to see you
I am standing only looking at you
I don’t know about the future after our love
I will hug you closer with warmth like a young child

It seems that I’m not alone
Today at that place
I’ll be there embraced by only you
