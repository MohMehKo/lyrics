누누이 말했지 사랑은 한순간
우연히 마주친 놀라운 그 시작
나를 감싸 줄래 우리 완벽해지게
갖고 싶은 건 난 가져야 하는 걸
조각조각 내 감정을
붙여 주는 넌 새로운 패턴
서로를 향해 보내온
비밀스런, 아슬한 Motion

Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh 넌 나만의 Fashion
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh 하나뿐인 Fashion

작은 곳 구김도 놓쳐서는 안 돼
나를 감당해 긴장해 뭐가 됐든 전부
내게 어울려 봐 좀 더 섬세해지도록
멈추지 말고 더 다가와도 좋아 Oh

이 키스에 널 더 안고파
그 감촉은 참 따뜻할 거야
가까운 이 침묵 속에
더 얽히는 우리 둘 시선

Ooh ooh ooh

더 화려한 건 다 필요 없어
너 하나로 충분한 나야
이 투명한 공기를 타고
내 맘은 널 향해 있어

[English translation:]

I’ve said it repeatedly, love is one moment
That surprising start when you meet by chance
Will you embrace me? So we’ll be perfect
What I want is what I need to have
Piece by piece, my feelings
are glued together, you’re a new pattern
Send toward one another,
a secretive, thrilling motion

Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh, you are my own fashion
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh, only one fashion

You can’t miss a wrinkle in a small spot
You need to deal with me, get nervous, whatever happens
Try to match me, become a bit more delicate
Don’t stop and come closer, I like it, oh

With this kiss, I want to hug you more
That touch will be so warm
Within this close silence,
both of our gazes entangle even more

Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh, you are my own fashion
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh, only one fashion

Never stop loving,
never stop loving you
Never stop loving,
never stop loving you
Never stop loving,
never stop loving you
Never stop loving,
never stop loving you

I don’t need anything even flashier,
you alone is enough for me
Riding this transparent air,
my heart is pointed toward you

Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh, you are my own fashion
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh, only one fashion

Never stop loving,
never stop loving you
Never stop loving,
never stop loving you
Never stop loving,
never stop loving you
Never stop loving,
never stop loving you
