Wrap your body around me so we are one
Wrap your arms and your legs and your hands and your tounge
Wrap your words and your life
Your feelings and pain
Wrap your cheatin's and your memories
Wrap your touch and your shame
Wrap your body around me
In you I will hide
Wrap your cold and your warm
Wrap your truth and your lies
Wrap your past and your plans
Wrap your secrets and hair
What you keep to yourself
And baby what you share
Wrap my body in you
Wrap your body around me so it feels like home
And where your heart is and your pictures
And your keys and clothes
Wrap your language and your places
Your sex and your taste
What you love and you hate
Wrap your body around me
Till it hurts I said
I wanna get lost in your news
And your bed
Tie me with your juices
Your tears and your sweat
Take me with your muscles
Your teeth and your scent
Wrap my body in you...
