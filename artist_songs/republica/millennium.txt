Everybody's talking 'bout a new beginning
A new place to drink in, a fast new boyfriend
A new science for a brand new century
A message to the future electronic holiday
Let the clock roll
So let the clock (the world is outside)
Roll (stars in the sky)
The clock hits midnight
Devil's hitting midnight
We hit midnight
New Year everything's gone quiet
Everybody's talking about a new space station
Your teeth falling out in the radiation
All your insurance and all your air miles
In gigantic computer millennium violence
Let the clock roll
So let the clock (the word is out now)
Roll (the sky's falling down)
The clock hits midnight
Devil's hitting midnight
We hit midnight
We hit midnight
New Year everything's gone quiet
Everybody suddenly thinks it's underground
To get into bands that split up in the 60's
Burn up the software learn that guitar
And get on the radio in America - yeah!
The clock hits midnight
Devil's hitting midnight
We hit midnight
New year everything's gone quiet
Clock hits midnight
Devil's hitting midnight
Rip it up midnight
New Year everything's gone quiet
