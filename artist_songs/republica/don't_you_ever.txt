Turn your head off, turn the nusic up
Dont't let it push you down
Out of hand get off
Don't ever think of him
Don't ever let him in
He'll go round and round and round
And make your head spin
He'll go round and round and round
And make your head spin
You're a big boy with a big mouth
Talkin big time just spit it out
Take the back seat till you feel alright
You get your own way, all day, every time
Love me hate me hurt me and break me
Want me take me but don't ever leave me
Don't you ever leave me don't you ever don't you ever
Push the boat out keep your feelings in
He tore your world apart, never start giving him
Don't promise anything
He'll see the state you've been
Hand on your heart, never lasts, didn't it
You got a small mind in a small town
Let your head spin give me the run around
I wish I didn't care, I wish I wasn't there
You get your own way, all day, everywhere
Want me take me but don't ever leave me
But don't ever leave me
I wish I didn't care
I wish I wasn't there
You get your own way
All day everywhere
Love me hate me hurt me and break me
Want me take me but don't ever leave me
Hate me hurt me and break me
Want me take me but don't ever leave me
Hate me hurt me and break me
Want me take me but don't ever leave me
(Don't you ever leave me)
Hate me hurt me and break me
Want me take me but don't ever leave me
