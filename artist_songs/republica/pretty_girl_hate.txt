She said she'd lie for you, 
She said she'd die for you
She said she'd fly in the sky, 
Said she'd cry for you
She said she's proud of you, 
And that she loves you too
Put on a show 'cos she knows, 
What you're going thru
She says I'm looking rough, 
I'm on a diet and stuff
And now it's all gone wrong, 
Oh she knows that it's tough
She says she'll do what she can, 
'Cos she's my Number One fan
Take advice don't fight, 
What he told her last night
Do you wanna know about us, 
She's got pretty girl hate
Funny how a so called friend, 
Delete everything she said
Apologies they come too late, 
She tells pretty girl lies
Every single time, 
She's got pretty girl hate
But then she changed her tune, 
In just one afternoon
Hates my guts won't stop, 
'Till I'm out the room
She let the rumours fly, 
She's got a devious mind
Attitude bitter fruit, 
And an evil eye
It's not a part of my life, 
She's got pretty girl hate
Funny how a so called friend, 
Delete everything she said
Apologies they come too late, 
She tells pretty girl lies
Black and white, All the time
You do everything in spite, 
Your jealousy
Is deep inside, 
Pretty girl
It's not a part of my life, 
Do you wanna know about it
She's got pretty girl hate, 
Funny how a so called friend
Delete everything she said, 
Apologies they come too late
She tells pretty girl lies, 
Black and white
All the time, 
You do everything in spite
Your jealousy, Is deep inside, 
She's got pretty girl hate
Every single time, 
Every single night
Every single time, She's got pretty girl
