Jimmy came down from the northwest, 
Said there's a couple of things
I wanna get off my chest, 
Like eat some food you're looking like a ghost
And how come you always hurt, 
The ones that you love most
I've pulled myself together, It tore us apart
I've been on the M1 for most of the night
You're born and then you live, then you die
You get one try and I've tried everything
A cannon's loose you were telling the truth
And I lied - caught offside - so don't say anything
And Jimmy said words I hadn't heard before
Like licentiousness and what about getting a job
But the blood in your body as you're coming down
It stings like the cold wind, 
That blows round your friends
You're born and then you live, then you die
You get one try and I've tried everything
A cannon's loose you were telling the truth
And I lied - caught offside - so don't say anything
Like a moon soaked summer night, 
On a rainy Westbourne Park day
We're together we're apart, 
Hell I'm crazy I'm wrong and you're right
You're born and then you live, then you die
You get one try and I've tried everything
A cannon's loose you were telling the truth
And I lied - caught offside - so don't say anything
You're born and then you live, then you die
You get one try and I've tried everything
A cannon's loose you were telling the truth
And I lied - caught offside - so don't say anything
Just try everything just try everything
