Get up, Alarm clock, Lip gloss, what a shock
Get dressed, front door, more stress what for?
Trapped in your world
You know you're trappped in your world
Lunch hour, fast food, telephone, more abuse
V.U. headache, cigarettes, coffee break
Trapped in your world
You know you're trappped in your world
(Come out of the darkness)
Come out of the darkness, over the tower blocks
Into the light
Go into the rush hour, out of the factory
Leave it behind
Turn on your TV., back to suburbia, every night
Come out of the darkness, over the offices, into the light
(Come out of the darkness)
Leave work, happy hour, too drunk by far
bus full, waterloo, fall asleep on the tube
Trapped in your world
You know you're trappped in your world
Vodka, lemonade, ashtrays, what a shame
Poor cow, sits alone, pubs close, go home
Trapped in your world
You know you're trappped in your world
(Come out of the darkness)
