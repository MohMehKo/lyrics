I want everything, I want everything
I want a limousine, a diamond ring
I want everything
I wanna taste the good life
I wanna sip from the golden cup
I wanna drink champagne in the early morning hours of the city nights
And if I stay out late
Don't wait up for me
One dove two hearts
A free ride to be who i wanna be
One life one vision 
Street life just for the hell of it
One dove two hearts
A free ride to be who i wanna be
One life one vision, one vision
I want the best of both worlds
I want total attraction
I want a piece of the cake
A piece of the action
I'm gonna take it to the limit
And get more than I bargained for
There's no regrets make no mistake
I gonna get what I want
Whatever it takes
And if I push too far don't wait up for me
One dove two hearts
A free ride to be who i wanna be
One life one vision
Street life just for the hell of it
One dove two hearts
A free ride to be who i wanna be
One life one vision, one vision
I wanna sip from the golden cup
I wanna drink champagne
I want everything
