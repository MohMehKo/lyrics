Marilyn baby, wants to be a pop star
She's seventeen, and very unhappy
Frankie baby, used to be a big fish
He's ethnic boy and aint got no money
And Holly wouldn't be so precious
If the beach bum beauties
Weren't so delicious in Hollywood
Who cares anyway?
Who really cares anyway?
Frankie baby, sees punks on the sidewalk
Freaks on the freeway
Someone blows a kid away
Have a nice day
And sweet sweet Marilyn
A streetwise heroine
A tricks, a fix, a fix, a tricks, a fix, a fix
She'll do anything
And Holly woudn't be so tragic
When everybody trips the light fantastic
In Hollywood
Who cares anyway? Who really cares anyway?
In the Hollywood bowl of serial killers
Who cares anyway?
Holly doesn't give a damn...
Holly doesn't give a damn...
Who cares anyway? Who really cares anyway?
In the Hollywood bowl of serial killers
