One more day on the roller coaster
If I scream they spin me faster
Everything gone backwards
And I, upside down
Stop me dead oh I think I'm falling
One more line and it will be morning
Hit the floor
So stop the traffic
Stop the clock, stop the lot
I wanna get off, i wanna get off with you
One more job in the supermarket
One more kick to get me started
Everyone get on board
This ship is sinking
Hanging out I don't want to be there
Took a train to another city
Chinese food in a tower frenzy
Why I'm here is mystery to me
So stop the traffic
Stop the clock, stop the lot
I wanna get off, i wanna get off with you
And like a speeding car you want more! more! more!
And like a rattlesnake I hate
I wanna get off, i wanna get off with you
And like a speeding car you want more! more! more!
And like a rattlesnake I hate
I wanna get off, i wanna get off with you
I wanna get off...
