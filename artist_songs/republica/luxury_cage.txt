Future you, 
Future me
You make the whole damn day feel longer
It's taking me over, It makes me feel older
Creature you, 
Creature me
I shed my coat, 
But it turned winter
Just look at the weather
It's raining forever
But I could stay, 
Stay in this luxury cage
Wouldn't that be great
I don't think so (I don't think so)
Yeah I could stay, 
Stay in this sparkling fake
Stay in this beautiful masquerade
I don't think so (I don't think so)
Future you, 
Future me
I shut myself out from the world now
The sounds getting so loud
You're making me spin round
But I could stay, 
Stay in this luxury cage
Wouldn't that be great
I don't think so (I don't think so)
Yeah I could stay, 
Stay in this sparkling fake
Stay in this beautiful waste of space
I don't think so (I don't think so)
Future you, 
Future me
I guess I'll have to set my sights higher
I'm too near a liar, It makes my feel tired
But I could stay, 
Stay in this luxury cage
Wouldn't that be great
I don't think so (I don't think so)
Yeah I could stay, 
Stay in this sparkling fake
Stay in this beautiful waste of space
I don't think so (I don't think so)
