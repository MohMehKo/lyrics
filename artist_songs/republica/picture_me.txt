Picture me, on a postcard
Picture me, on a magazine
Call me on my private number
You've got my photograph
On your bedroom wall
Picture me - Coz everybody wants her
On a postcard - She makes them smile
Picture me - And everybody needs her
On a magazine - Once in a while
Call me - Coz everybody wants her
On my private number - She makes them smile
You've got my photograph - And everybody needs her
On your bedroom wall - Once in a while
She is wanted, she is smart
She'll make you special
She's got it down to an art
She don't argue, she's on time
She is available
She'll make you feel fine
She is wanted, she is smart
She'll make you special
She's got it down to an art
She don't argue, she's on time
She is available
She'll make you feel fine
Picture me - Coz everybody wants her
On a postcard - She makes them smile
Picture me - And everybody needs her
On a magazine - Once in a while
Picture me...
