You took it all and you moved away
Now I'm living in a trailer by the interstate
Maybe the drinking made it worse
It got me through the night but the morning hurts
My god what have I done
We coulda had it all but I made you run

Oh where did I go wrong, I'm livin my life like a country song
Oh will I get it back, I'm livin like I'm in a Willie Nelson track
Its bad, so sad, I ended up losing everything I had
Love left town and my whole worlds gone
Livin my life like a country song

Maybe I stumble when I walk the line
But no ones gonna catch me on the other side
I've got no friends in low places
This country boys gotta make some changes
My god I'm so choked I'm banging on the door but the bar is closed

Oh where did I go wrong, I'm livin my life like a country song
Oh how did I screw up, spent last night in  my pickup truck
Its bad, so sad, I ended up losing everything I had
Love left town and my whole worlds gone
Livin my life like a country song

This is what I am and its okay
A rowdy ass redneck with a love for pain

Oh where did I go wrong, I'm livin my life like a country song (livin my life like a country song)
Oh will I get it back, I'm livin like I'm in a Willie Nelson track
Its bad, so sad, I ended up losing everything I had
I messed around and now you're gone
Livin my life like a country song (livin my life like a country song)
Oh where did I go wrong, I'm livin my life like a country song (livin my life like a country song)
Oh where did I go wrong, I'm livin my life like a country song
Its bad, so sad, I ended up losing everything I had
But love left town and my whole worlds gone
Livin my life like a country song
