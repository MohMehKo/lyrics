You could have let it be 
You could have let me bleed 
Instead it seems 
You keep 
Rubbing salt in the wound 
You could have let me heal 
I hate the way it feels 
Now I suffer still 
You're rubbing salt in the wound

Being dead must be better than this
Already hurts but you couldn't resist 
Moving on way too quick
An unexpected a way to end it 

Like a bullet that didn't go through 
It's stuck inside just like you
Makin' me hate like you always do
Now you're fucking him like we were nothing

You could have let it be 
You could have let me bleed 
Instead it seems 
You keep 
Rubbing salt in the wound 
You could have let me heal 
I hate the way it feels 
Now I suffer still 
You're rubbing salt in the wound

You're picking at my scars 
My world's been torn apart
Everywhere I turn there you are 
To humiliate me, you must hate me

When there's nothing left 
And I take my last breath 
Will I finally be at rest 
While you're both laughing, hope you're happy 

You could have let it be 
You could have let me bleed 
Instead it seems 
You keep 
Rubbing salt in the wound 
You could have let me heal 
I hate the way it feels 
Now I suffer still 
You're rubbing salt in the wound

It's burning, I can't take the pain I said
It's burning, I can't take the pain
Of when you're rubbing salt in the 
Rubbing salt in the wound

You could have let it be 
You could have let me bleed 
Instead it seems 
You keep 
Rubbing salt in the wound 
You could have let me heal 
I hate the way it feels 
Now I suffer still 
You're rubbing salt in the wound
