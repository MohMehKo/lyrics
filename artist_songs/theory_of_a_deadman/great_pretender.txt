Everybody has an imperfection
She is picture perfect to me
At first she had the sweetest intention
Now are you gunna believe
She's always had a secret to tell but
Why'd she keep a secret from me
Everybody likes to feel the infection
But are you ready to bleed

When my world is a lie (She is a trouble for me)

She is a great pretender
She wanted me to believe
She is a great pretender
So don't believe what you see

My baby's feeling so insecure now
She's got no reason to be
I want to touch I want to taste her body all now
She's got no use for me
On the knees any way that I wanted
She gives herself what she needs
Everybody is so sick of the silence
So are you ready to scream

Now my world is a lie (She is a trouble for me)

She is a great pretender
She wanted me to believe
She is a great pretender
So don't believe what you see

Open up your eyes (lies, lies, lies)
Open up my eyes

She is a great pretender
She wanted me to believe
She is a great pretender
So don't believe what you see

She is a great pretender (lies, lies, lies)
She is a great pretender
