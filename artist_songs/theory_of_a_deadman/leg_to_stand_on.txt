Get on your horse and ride

What she said to me you would never believe
Someone should have shot the messenger
Was like sticking needles in my eyes
She meant what she said, when I had nothing to lose
Tried to shake you awake but you would not move
Not on your life 'cause I'm on to your lies

Is it just my imagination or did you have me believe
You're not yourself and you're out of line
Is it just my medication or is it wearing away
I'm not myself and I'm out of time

Get on your horse and...

Today, you'd say the same for me
That every man is a prisoner
Was like sticking needles in my eyes
She said I would not feel a thing
Then she wore her goddamn wedding ring
Not on your life 'cause I'm on to your lies

Is it just my imagination or did you have me believe
You're not yourself and you're out of line
Is it just my medication or is it wearing away
I'm not myself and I'm out of time

You haven't got it, you haven't got it,
you haven't got a leg to stand on
You haven't got it, you haven't got it,
you haven't got a leg to stand on
You haven't got it, you haven't got it,
you haven't got a leg to stand on
You haven't got it, you haven't got the time

Is it just my imagination or did you have me believe
You're not yourself and you're out of line
Or is it just my medication or is it wearing away
I'm not myself and I'm out of time
So get on your horse and ride
Just get on your horse and ride
