When you come around I don't really know what to say
My mind is racing with thoughts that I can't erase
Like if we've had a house to call our own
If we had a little girl would she have your nose
This voice inside won't leave me alone

Cause I wonder if we could've made it last
I wonder if we gave it all we had
Or if our tempers got the best of us
I wonder if I could've been a better man
Maybe you'd be with me till the end
Cause even though we're said and done
I still wonder if you could've been the one
One, one, one

When you come around you always ask if I'm okay
I tell you that I'm fine yeah just like a guy would say
I know you know something's wrong
Cause you know me better than anyone
The truth is I never felt more alone

Cause I wonder if we could've made it last
I wonder if we gave it all we had
Or if our tempers got the best of us
I wonder if I could've been a better man
Maybe you'd be with me till the end
Cause even though we're said and done
I still wonder if you could've been the one
One, one, one

When you come around I don't really know what to say
I just really fucking miss you and that will never change

Cause I wonder if we could've made it last
I wonder if we gave it all we had
Or if our tempers got the best of us
I wonder if I could've been a better man
Maybe you'd be with me till the end
Cause even though we're said and done
I still wonder if you could've been the one
One, one
Could've been the one, you were the one, one
I still wonder if you could've been the one
