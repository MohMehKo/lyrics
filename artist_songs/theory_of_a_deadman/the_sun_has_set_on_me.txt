Everything has changed
But I just stay the same
Everyone's moved on
An echo of what remains
All the pretty things
They twinkle in the light
It chokes me up but you learn to live inside the darkness

The sun has set on me
The sun has set on me
The sun, it sets me free
The sun has set on me

Like tears in the rain
No one'll notice
A fear I can't explain
No one cares
If only I could see a smile
Before I face the black
But the light is gone
I've learned to live inside the darkness

The sun has set on me
The sun has set on me
The sun, it sets me free
The sun has set on me

I wish that I could feel
I think I'd like the pain
But none of this is real
Cause I don't feel a thing

The sun has set on me
The sun has set on me
The sun, it sets me free
The sun has set on me
