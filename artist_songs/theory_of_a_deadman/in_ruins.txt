We're trying to pick up the pieces
My flag's waving defeated
Living room's like a battlefield
Too many wounds we can't heal
Now I think we realize
We were seeing through blind eyes
This was always gonna happen
So why are we so sad then

Now it's all gone
How do we move on
What a disaster, with nothing after
Swept off our feet
With nothing underneath
Oh we had it all, but now we watch it fall
Faaaaaall (in ruins)
Now we watch it fall
Faaaaaall (in ruins)
Now we're in ruins

It's been so long since this made sense
Cause now it's ending senseless
It's been so long since it was alright
Thought I'd have you my whole life
And now our dreams ain't so sweet
We only talk when we're fighting
We were doomed from the beginning
We don't get our happy ending

Now it's all gone
How do we move on
What a disaster, with nothing after
Swept off our feet
With nothing underneath
Oh we had it all. but now we watch it fall
Faaaaaall (in ruins)
Now we watch it fall
Faaaaaall (in ruins)
Now we're in ruins

I give up
I give in
I surrender 
To it
We were strong
Not strong enough
Lost our love
Spilled our blood

Now it's all gone
How do we move on
What a disaster
With nothing after
Swept off our feet
With nothing underneath
Oh we had it all, but now we watch it fall
Faaaaaall (in ruins)
Now we watch it fall
Faaaaaall (in ruins)
Now we're in ruins

I give up
I give in
I surrender 
To it
We were strong
Not strong enough
Lost our love
Spilled our blood
