No chance, that's what you got
Up against a machine too strong
Pretty politicians buying souls from us are
Puppets
Won't find their place in line
But tie a string around your finger now, boy
Cause it's, it's just a matter of time

(Cause you got)
No chance, no chance in hell (you got)
No chance, no chance in hell (you got)
No chance, no chance in hell (you got)
No chance, no chance in hell

Manipulation
It's a game of porn and strings
Little puppets making moves
Making people change
Politics and money
Are your pleasure and your pain
And the broken never notice as
Their souls wash down the drain

(Cause you got)
No chance, no chance in hell (you got)
No chance, no chance in hell (you got)
No chance, no chance in hell (you got)
No chance, no chance in hell

Come on, come on
Come and get it
Come on, come on
Come and get it

(Cause you got)
No chance, no chance in hell (you got)
No chance, no chance in hell (you got)
No chance, no chance in hell (you got)
No chance, no chance in hell
