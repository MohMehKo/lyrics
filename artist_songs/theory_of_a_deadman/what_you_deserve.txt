You try to string me up
You can never get the best of me
Well I've never been to California
And I'll never care if I get there anyway

Don't ever lose your morals
Since I could never fill that hole
And I never burned your letters
But I think I'll like you better
When you get what you deserve

You try to take control
You can never get the best of me
Well I've never been to Tijuana
And I never care if I get there anyway

You never lost your marbles
Since I could never fill that hole
And I never burned your letters
But I think I'll like you better
When you get what you deserve

Give it some time to sink in
Just give me some time to figure it out
Just give me some time to think here
Just give it some time
and you'll get what you deserve

You'll get what you deserve, you'll get what you deserve
You'll get what you deserve, you'll get what's coming
You'll get what you deserve, you'll get what you deserve
You'll get what you deserve, you'll get what's coming
You'll get what's coming

Give it some time to sink in
Just give me some time to figure it out
Just give me some time to think here
Just give it some time and
you'll get what you deserve
