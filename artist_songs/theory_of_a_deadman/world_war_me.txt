Wooh oh oooh this is world war me
Wooh oh oooh I will never find peace, I'm the only enemy

I'm the king of doubt, I fight it out all on the inside
I'm the poster child of denial, there's nothing I can't hide
I'm punching holes in walls because, I let it build up way too long, sabotage
Everything I ever had, and now I'm seeing red, there is no one else to blame, but the voices in my head

Wooh oh oooh this is world war me
Wooh oh oooh I will never find peace
I look into the mirror and I hate what I've become
'Cause I'm the only casualty from damage that I've done
I'm the only enemy in world war me

I know you tried to show me the light, I feed on the darkness
I've lost control, I'm down in a hole, I'm broken and helpless
The noose is getting tight, so tight, will I make it through the night
It's time to surrender to myself and crawl out of this hell, the battles in my head, there is nobody else

Wooh oh oooh this is world war me
Wooh oh oooh I will never find peace
I look into the mirror and I hate what I've become
'Cause I'm the only casualty from damage that I've done
I'm the only enemy in world war me

How do you run away when you're the enemy
Knowing there's no way out, nothing's gonna save me now

Wooh oh oooh this is world war me
Wooh oh oooh I will never be free

Wooh oh oooh this is world war me
Wooh oh oooh I will never find peace
I look into the mirror and I hate what I've become
'Cause I'm the only casualty from damage that I've done
I'm the only enemy in world war me
