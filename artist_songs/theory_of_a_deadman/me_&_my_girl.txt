Well I know that everything's alright
When she's with me tonight
Me and my girl, we're the modern day Bonnie and Clyde
Oh it's just the two of us
Sitting around we like to talk about 
Getting married one day
Kids runnin' around 
I never knew, pains me to see
That all this time I've been sleeping with the enemy

It was me and my girl
(It was me and my girl)
It was me and my girl
(It was me and my girl)

Now things are all fucked up
Instead of kissing her lips I wanna staple them shut
Me and my girl are done cuz nobody tried
Oh it's just the two of us
Sitting around we liked to fight about
All these things, we could've done without it
And now I know, it pains me to see
That all this time I've been sleeping with the enemy

It was me and my girl
(It was me and my girl)
It was just me and my girl
(It was just me and my girl)

Now I know
Now I see
All this time I've been sleeping with the enemy
It was me and me and my girl

The more that we struggle 
The harder it seems
Fix what was broken
And live out our dreams

It's just the two of us
It's just me and my girl
Just me and my girl
It's just me and my girl
It's just the two of us
Just the two of us
And that's the way it was
It's just me and my girl
Just me and my girl
It's just me and my girl
And now it ain't the two of us
The two of us
And now it ain't the two of us

It was me and my girl
(It was me and my girl)
It was me and my girl
(It was just me and my girl)

Now I'm caught, it's better for me
All this time she was sleeping with the enemy
It was me and my girl
It wasn't meant to be
It was me and my girl
She was never meant for me
It was me and my girl
Was never meant to be
It was me and my girl
She was never meant for me
It was me and my girl
And that's the way it was
