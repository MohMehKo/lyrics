Welcome to the panic room!

Running out of air, ain't seen the light of day
Living life scared, so I hide myself away
Chaos all around, be quiet, just be calm
I'm better off alone like I have been all along
I don't know why, but I'm trapped inside

Welcome to the panic room, it's my dark place
Lock myself away from you and I can't escape
When you've got nothing to lose paranoia sets in
And no matter what you do, I'm never gonna let you in
Panic, panic 
Welcome to the panic room! 

Like a spider I will crawl, back into my hole
I'm scratching at the walls, but I have nowhere to go
I'm adjusting to the dark, forget about the pain
Am I really that afraid or am I just insane?
You don't know why but you follow me inside

Welcome to the panic room, it's my dark place
Lock myself away from you and I can't escape
When you've got nothing to lose paranoia sets in
And no matter what you do, I'm never gonna let you in
Panic, panic 
Welcome to the panic room! 

Suffocating, I can't breathe
Hallucinating, walls closing in on me!

Panic, panic, panic, panic, panic, panic [x4] 

Panic! 
Panic! 

Welcome to the panic room, it's my dark place
Lock myself away from you and I can't escape
When you've got nothing to lose paranoia sets in
And no matter what you do, I'm never gonna let you in

Welcome to the panic room (panic room), it's my dark place
Lock myself away from you (away from you) and I can't escape
When you've got nothing to lose paranoia sets in
And no matter what you do, I'm never gonna let you in
Panic, panic
Welcome to the panic room!
