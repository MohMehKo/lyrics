Roll the dice, play your cards,
Break the rules, that's who you are,
Whoever said play it safe never played the game.
Too many players but too many pawns,
So many judges say what's right or wrong,
Let them jump into the fire if they want to play (play).

'Cause it's a deadly game that we play as we live our lives,
When we say what is on our minds,
Play it now before the game is over.

Two simple rules the devil hands us,
Make your mistakes, but no second chances,
Every time we stand up is another chance to fall (fall).

'Cause it's a deadly game that we play as we live our lives,
When we say what is on our minds,
Play it now before the game is over,
'Cause it's a deadly game that we play as we live our lives,
When we say what is on our minds,
Play it now before the game is over.

Judgment day calls in on markers,
Haunted hell and it's getting darker,
As they carry you away, you wonder what went wrong (wrong).

'Cause it's a deadly game that we play as we live our lives,
When we say what is on our minds,
Play it now before the game is over,
'Cause it's a deadly game that we play as we live our lives,
When we say what is on our minds,
Play it now before the game is over... over... over
