You've been going the wrong way, on a one way ride
You've been taking the wrong pills, you've been swallowing mine
It don't matter what she says, well you know it's a lie
She packed her suitcase, with everything of mine

Well she don't think the way that I do
I never thought she'd make it through
She don't need the things that I do
She'd rather leave than take it

You take a look in the mirror
To see you're losing your mind
You've been taking the wrong advice
Well you've been following mine
It don't matter what she says, well you know it's a lie
She packed her suitcase, with everything of mine

Well she don't think the way that I do
I never thought she'd make it through
She don't need the things that I do
She'd rather lose than fake it
Well she don't think the way that I do
I never thought she'd make it through
She don't need the things that I do
She'd rather leave than take it

Well she don't think the way that I do
I never thought she'd make it through
She don't need the things that I do
She'd rather leave than take it
Well she don't think the way that I do
I never thought she'd make it through
She don't need the things that I do
She'd rather leave than take it
She only knows just how I feel
She only knows just how to fake it
She only knows how I feel
She only knows just how to fake it
