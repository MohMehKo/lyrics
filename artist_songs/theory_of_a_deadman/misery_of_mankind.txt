All you wanna do is stuff your face and be annoying
All you wanna do with me is fight, fight, fight, fight
All you ever do is make excuses, God you're boring
All you wanna do with me is fight, fight, fight, fight
Use everything you've got inside, you still don't find the courage
Stick your tail between your legs and go

Oh you're just a man of straw, you think you know it all?
You're just a king without a throne

It's like it's all a bad dream, nothing is as it seems
This is a nightmare awake, and you're the one to blame

You're putting us through hell, you set us up to fail
You've gone and proved to be the misery of mankind
You've gone in way too deep, you won't admit defeat
But in the end you'll be the misery of mankind

Ay, ay, ay, ay, mankind

All you wanna do is sit around and point the finger
Everything you say to me's a lie, lie, lie, lie
Even when you leave your ego stays behind to linger
Everything you say to me's a lie, lie, lie, lie

All you really do to me is prove that you're a deadbeat
You left us all out in the cold

Oh what happened to a thing called trust? I think we've had enough
It's time for you to head on home

It's like it's all a bad dream, nothing is as it seems
This is a nightmare awake, and you're the one to blame

You're putting us through hell, you set us up to fail
You've gone and proved to be the misery of mankind
You've gone in way too deep, you won't admit defeat
But in the end you'll be the misery of mankind

Ay, ay, ay, ay, mankind

Misery

It's like it's all a bad dream, nothing is as it seems
This is a nightmare awake

You're putting us through hell, you set us up to fail
You've gone and proved to be the misery of mankind
You've gone in way too deep, you won't admit defeat
But in the end you'll be the misery of mankind

You're putting us through hell, you set us up to fail
You've gone and proved to be the misery of mankind
You've gone in way too deep, you won't admit defeat
But in the end you'll be the misery of mankind

Ay, ay, ay, ay, mankind
