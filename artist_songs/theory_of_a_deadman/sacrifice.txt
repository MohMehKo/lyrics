No I don't need a reason to be breathin 
Just here doin what I can 
No I don't want a family who would damn me 
and resent everything I am 
I don't need to prove to all the ones who 
Feel that I need to fit in 
No I won't ever tell you that i failed you 
I'd rather start life over again 

No I'm sorry to say 
There'll be no sacrifice today 

No I can see it clearly 
Why you feel me 
Why you got to bring me down 
No I don't want to fight you 
Just to spite you 
But I'm not afraid to take you out 

No I'm sorry to say 
There'll be no sacrifice today 

Everybody expects me to break 
but i'll never break down again 
Everybody expects me to give up 
but you'll never see me givin in 
Everybody wants me to lose 
but i'll never lose who I am 

No I'm sorry to say 
There'll be no sacrifice today [X2]

Everybody expects me to break
