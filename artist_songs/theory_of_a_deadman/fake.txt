You ride on a road driven down on a crooked mile
Cause your leaven your home for a girl with a crooked smile
Well I think that you've been fooled all along
You've been nothin' but weak at being strong
You'll just fit right in it's to late
So join the club and spit right in my face

I can't stand all the shit I take
You're such a
You're such a fake
You don't care who's heart you break
You're such a
You're such a

Loser is a label that you give yourself
Well at least you know what you are if nothing else
You go and blame it on me but you mine as well
Blame it on the bourbon and that whiskey smell
So be a man and say it to my face
Tell me to put that slut back in her place

I can't stand all the shit I take
You're such a
You're such a fake
You don't care who's heart you break
You're such a
You're such a fake

I can't stand all the shit I take
You're such a
You're such a fake
You don't care who's heart you break
You're such a
You're such a

I can't stand all the shit I take
I can't believe you spit right in my face
I can't stand all the shit I take
I can't believe you spit right in my face
Spit right in my face

I can't stand all the shit I take
You're such a
You're such a fake
You don't care who's heart you break
You're such a
You're such a
