As I sit in this coffee shop
Halfway through your note, I had to stop
Right near the end, the letter read

Maybe when I leave I'll lead a life less empty
Maybe we were waiting way too long to end this soap opera story
You'll accept just half of all these consequences
Maybe then that's when I'll finally say I'm sorry

Why didn't you, why didn't I, why couldn't we, I wonder why

She called me up the other day
And thank god I knew exactly what to say
You left me with this note and I quote from this note you wrote

Maybe when I leave I'll lead a life less empty
Maybe we were waiting way too long to end this soap opera story
You'll accept just half of all these consequences
Maybe then that's when I'll finally say I'm sorry

Why didn't you, why didn't I, why couldn't we, I wonder why
Why didn't you, why didn't I, why couldn't we, I wonder why
Why didn't you, why didn't I

Maybe when I leave I'll lead a life less empty
Maybe we were waiting way too long to end this soap opera story
You'll accept just half of all these consequences
Maybe then that's when I'll finally say I'm sorry
Whyd idn't you, why didn't I, why couldn't we, I wonder why
Maybe then that's when I'll finally say I'm sorry
Whyd didn't you, why didn't I
