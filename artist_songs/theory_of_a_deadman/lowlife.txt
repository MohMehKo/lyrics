You know I'll be the one who gets fallin' down drunk
At my neighbor kid's soccer game
I've got an '82 Fiero with a car seat in the middle
Broken down on the Interstate
I've got a beer-stained t-shirt looking like Joe Dirt
Something 'bout me just ain't right
I'm a cash-stealing, drug-dealing loser without any feeling
Getting trailer trash tonight

[Chorus:]
'Cause I'm a low life, and I'm loving it
I've got the whole damn world in the palm of my hand
I'm a low life, so fucking deal with it
No you can't change something that you don't understand

I'm thrilled to be a hillbilly,
Hate to have to deal with me
Probably just end in a fight
No sleeves, can't read, doesn't even phase me
Naked, sleeping like a baby tonight

[Chorus]

Living it up, living it up
Being a low life
[X3]
Living it up, living it up

A gun-packing, bitch-smacking, mess with me it's gonna happen
Loving life living in sin
Passed out on the floor, sorry just to work no more
Giving up, on giving in

Ah fuck it

'Cause I'm a low life, and I'm lovin' it
I'm never gonna change as long as I live
I'm a low life, so fuckin' deal with it
'Cause deep down I really know everyone is

'Cause we're low lives, and we're lovin' it
We got the whole damn world in the palm of our hand
'Cause we're low lives, so fuckin' deal with it
No you can't change something that you don't understand

Living it up, living it up
Being a low life
