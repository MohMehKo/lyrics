Shadow

Please take my body
Take my state o’ mind
Fool me with a cheap surprise
Gets me every time
Please take a second to wash away the pride
Don’t even leave me with an emptiness inside

I am nothin’

Under the ocean lies my bitterness
(Lies my bitterness)
Sea of desperation leaves no evidence
(Leaves no evidence)
Give me the bottle
Filled with turpentine
(Filled with turpentine)
Take me from this hell I have
And leave this world behind

I am nothin’

See me fade away
Watch me disappear
Lost without a trace
I’m everything I fear
Can anyone find a way
To help me 
Cause I’m nothing but a shadow

I feel so wounded
Kick me when I'm down
I search the dirt below 
And look at what I found

I... I am nothin’

See me fade away
Watch me disappear
Lost without a trace
I’m everything I fear
Can anyone find a way
To help me 
Cause I’m nothin’ but a shadow
Cause I’m nothin’ but a shadow
I…
I…
I…
I…
