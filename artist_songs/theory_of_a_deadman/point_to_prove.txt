The country's gone to hell
But believe me I didn't do it
You left me all alone
And now they call me stupid

Didn't think it would take this long
to see the things that you've been doing
Didn't think I could wait this long
to make the point that you've been proving

Just when you think you've found a friend
That's when they call you stupid
Just when you think that life is dull
That's when they call you pathetic

Didn't think it would take this long
to see the things that you've been doing
Didn't think I could wait this long
to make the point that you've been proving
Didn't think it would take this long
to see the things that you've been doing
Didn't think I could wait this long
to make the point that you've been proving

I wish we all could make it
I wish we all could make it
I wish we all could make it
I wish we all could try, try, try

Didn't think it would take this long
to see the things that you've been doing
Didn't think I could wait this long
to make the point that you've been proving
Didn't think it would take this long
to see the things that you've been doing
Didn't think I could wait this long
to make the point that you've been proving
The point that you've been proving
The point that you've been proving
