All we hear is noise
Like we ever had a choice
Life's a never ending void
So what'cha gonna do about it?

All we hear is static
In a constant state of panic
We're pissed off and abandoned 
So what'cha gonna do about it?

Take those horns, throw them up
Show them we don't give a fuck

We like our hair down, volume up
Kick like a machine gun
Cold beer, stage dives
Scream along all night
Metal brings us to our knees
Motherfucking therapy
Wear it like a scarlet letter
It's what brings us all together
Hit the floor, turn it up
Everybody ready?
'Cause when it comes to music
We all lose it when it's heavy

They'll push you to the edge
'Til all you see is red
'Cause tonight we raise the dead
That's what we're gonna do about it

We'll burn this mother down
We've all had it now
We all want it loud
So what'cha gonna do about it?

Take those horns, throw them up
We live for it, it's in our blood

We like our hair down, volume up
Kick like a machine gun
Cold beer, stage dives
Scream along all night
Metal brings us to our knees
Motherfucking therapy
Wear it like a scarlet letter
It's what brings us all together
Hit the floor, turn it up
Everybody ready?
'Cause when it comes to music
We all lose it when it's heavy

Take those horns, throw them up
Show them we don't give a fuck

We like our hair down, volume up
Kick like a machine gun
Cold beer, stage dives
Scream along all night
Metal brings us to our knees
Motherfucking therapy
Wear it like a scarlet letter
It's what brings us all together
Hit the floor, turn it up
Everybody ready?
'Cause when it comes to music
We all lose it when it's heavy
