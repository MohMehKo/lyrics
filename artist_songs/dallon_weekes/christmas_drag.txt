Another Christmas without you
That makes it two in a row
Just wrap me up like a present
I'll tie you up with a bow

I'll just stay gone until New Years
Or I won't come back again
Oh, how I wish it was last year
When we were still best friends

Christmas is a drag sometimes
Please say next year that you will be mine
And all you've got to do
Is say that I love you
And Christmas this next year will be fine

Christmas is a drag sometimes
Please say next year that you will be mine
And all you've got to do
Is say that I love you
And Christmas this next year will be fine
Will be fine
It will be fine
It'll be so fine, fine, fine
