Oh, lights are shining down, but
I feel dead
The sickly sweet holidays keep
Me in bed

But when I'm awake
I'm crying every day
I wish that you were here
When Christmas comes this time each year

I'll wrap you up and send you
To myself
I don't want anything from
Anyone else

I'm sitting in my room
Dreaming of you
I can't wait 'til you get here
When Christmas comes this time each year

I'm feeling better since you
Returned my calls, so
String up some Christmas lights
Let's deck these halls

I've one more thing to say
Don't ever go away
Oh, I'm glad you're here
When Christmas comes this time each year
...
