It's often told
December's cold and January too
And February starts that way 
Till I get home to you

Valentine,
Would you be mine?
If the circumstances would align 
Cause I'll be waiting on you,
Till the sky turns black
Give me a heart attack,
Valentine 

Valentine, if I may,
I'd like to rewind back to the day
When we were so very young 
Oh, I'll be waiting on you,
Till the sky turns black
Give me a heart attack,
Valentine,
Valentine
