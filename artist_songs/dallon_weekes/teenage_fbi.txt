Someone tell me why
I do the things
That I don't wanna do?
When you're around me,
I'm somebody else

Someone tell me why
I act like a fool
When things don't go my way
When you're around me
I'm somebody else

And there is good reason, I guess
For having it once gone too far
When you clean out the hive,
Does it make you wanna cry?
Are you still being followed
By the Teenage FBI?

Someone tell me why
Someone tell me why
Someone tell me why
I do the things
That I don't wanna do?

When you're around me,
I'm somebody else

Someone tell me why
Someone tell me why
Someone tell me why
