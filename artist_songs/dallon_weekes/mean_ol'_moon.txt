Mean ol' moon
It must be fun
To shine upon me
As I come undone
Till I'm all alone
Beneath the sun
You mean ol' moon

With your beam
You led the way
And found me love I thought was
Here to stay
Till you went and took
My love away
You mean ol' moon

Oh you mean ol' stars above
The games that you play with me
I could find some happiness
If all of my nights were cloudy

Mean ol' moon
I hope it's true
You've taken all the light that's left in you
And saving it up for you know who
You mean ol' moon

You mean ol' moon
