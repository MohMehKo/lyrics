Another year's over
The snow starts to fall
Just like you would if you ended it all
But tonight's not the night
If only you'd answer my calls

Please pick up now

Oh no
Another Christmas alone!
I would talk you down
If you would answer your phone

Please
Don't
Jump

Another year's over
You're spent on the floor
You burn all the pictures
You hang from your door
You've got family and friends
But you don't really talk anymore

Just like last year

Oh no
Another Christmas alone!
I would talk you down
If you would answer your phone

Please
Don't you dare
Jump

Don't you
'Cause it's Christmas!

Oh no
Another Christmas alone!
I would talk you down
If you would answer your phone

Please
Don't you dare
Jump

Don't
Don't you
Ah ah ah

Oh no
Another Christmas alone!
I would talk you down
If you would answer your phone

Please
Don't
Jump

Don't jump
