Too cool for school and more jaded than me
Tell us again how you don't watch MTV
Black at night
A rockstar in tight pants
Tight... pants?

What else can we do Iggy Pop dance?

Elbows at your hips, hands into fists
Just shake it, shake it

Thrift store shopping, underground music
Light socket hair, out on a trip
Pretty undies, girlies
Tight pants (tight pants) tight pants!

What else can we do Iggy Pop dance?
Shake it, ooooh yeah shake it
Elbows at your hips, hands into fists
Just shake it, shake it

What else can we do Iggy Pop dance?
Shake it, ooooh yeah shake it
Elbows at your hips, hands into fists
Just shake it (ooh) shake it
