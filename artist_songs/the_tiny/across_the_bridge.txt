Cross the bridge, go downtown
Cross your heart 'cause what I've found is stories told a reason to grow old
Free escapes were torn down
Burnin' hearts were left inside to hear this vicious sound
And they burned down to the ground

But I still don't know is this for real
Yet it still my hear can always feel
Still don't know is this for real
When colors they seem to fade when I am around

Neighbors never recognized
The guy upstairs wore no disguise
He is a see through as it seems
I know he is ignoring me
And I wish that I could go with him
And feel the strength he has within
And then make you understand
That I don't know what is the plan

But now I've seen his footprints on the ground
Across the bridge and down the street and downtown
