Woke up this early, 
but only to figure out 
the reason why I'm still around. 
Waiting for thoughts 
to resolve and become authentic, 
still I don't know what to say.

Please lift your hand of my chest 
'cause I can't breathe with your love locked so tight around me. 
My love, it isn't as brave as yours, love. 
I've learned to rather be safe than sorry.

Fearless of lust, there you lie in my bed 
and don't hear how I am howling your name. 
Wishing for you to wake up 
and tell me to rearrange my mind.
I'm not the same as I was.

Please pull my brain out of my head 
'cause I can't love with my thoughts wrapped so tight around me. 
My love, it isn't as brave as yours, love. 
I've learned to rather be safe than sorry.

You say that I should have learned by now
that my telepathic screams won't meet you while you sleep, 
but still I try, so

Please peel my skin of my flesh 
'cause I can't love with myself wrapped so tight around me. 
My love, it isn't as brave as yours, love. 
I've learned to rather be safe than sorry, so
please pull my brain out of my head 
'cause I can't love with my thoughts wrapped so tight around me. 
My love, it isn't as brave as yours love. 
I've learned to rather be safe than sorry.
