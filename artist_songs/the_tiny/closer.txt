Now I'm thinking maybe I was stoned
I felt my feet lift off the ground
And my heart was screamin' at my bones
I need you closer

As he's in the middle of the street
Then I pretend he's mine to keep
Cars are runnin' fast on both sides of his head
His eyes say, "Closer."

Closer, closer

I met him when the sun was down
The bar was closed, we both have had no sleep
My face beneath the streetlamp, it reveals what it is
Lonely people seek

Closer, closer
Closer, closer

And you're close enough to lose
Close to the point where you know that your mind
It cannot choose
Close enough to lose
Close enough to lose your heart

Now I'm thinking maybe I was stoned
I felt my feet lift off the ground
And my heart was screamin' at my bones
I need you closer

Closer, closer

You met me when the sun was down
And the bar was closed, we both have had no sleep
My face beneath the streetlamp, it reveals what it is
Lonely people seek

Closer, closer
Closer, closer

Then you're close enough to lose
Close to the point where you know that your mind
It cannot choose
Close enough to lose
Close enough to lose your heart
