Everything is free now
That's what they say
Everything I ever done
Gonna give it away

Someone hit the big score
They figured it out
That we're gonna do it anyway
Even if it doesn't pay

I could get a straight job
I've done it before
I never minded working hard
It is who I'm working for

Or I could get a tip job
Gas up a car
Or try to make a little change
Down at the bar

'Cause everything is free now
That's what they say
And everything I ever done
Gonna have to give it away

'Cause someone hit the big score
They figured it out
That we gonna do it anyway
Even if it doesn't pay

Everyday I wake up
Am humming this song
And I don't need to run around
I can just stay at home

And sing this little love song
For the love in myself
If there's something that you wanna hear
You can sing it yourself

'Cause everything is free now
That's what I say
Everything you ever done
Gonna give it away

'Cause someone hit the big score
They figured it out
That we gonna do it anyway
Even if it doesn't pay

'Cause everything is free now
